[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:20.880]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:20.880 --> 00:34.560]  jones on this friday september 18th 2015 i'm david night your host we're going to
[00:34.560 --> 00:38.800]  be joined by alex jones on the next segment he's going to give you an update on the money bomb i can
[00:38.800 --> 00:43.920]  tell you that we sincerely appreciate all the support that you've given us over the last couple
[00:43.920 --> 00:49.680]  of days it's a hesitate for a moment to give the date as it seems like all the days are running
[00:49.680 --> 00:56.800]  together for all of us here the crew especially in the back has been working 24 7 to get this done
[00:57.680 --> 01:03.040]  those of us who are here on the on the air have put in a lot of hours but especially the crew
[01:03.040 --> 01:07.120]  in the back they've been working around the clock so we appreciate their hard work and we
[01:07.120 --> 01:12.320]  appreciate you standing with us and we're going to give you an update on that with alex jones
[01:12.320 --> 01:16.000]  when we come back from the break of course we're also going to have paul joseph watson joining us
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.120]  today he's going to talk about a story that we have up on info wars dot com top mom muslim
[01:22.160 --> 01:27.920]  immigrants should breed with europeans to quote conquer their countries he says europeans have
[01:27.920 --> 01:34.480]  lost their fertility i think it's uh he's actually kind of right the question is why
[01:34.480 --> 01:41.600]  are families so small in europe i remember mark stein who's a canadian pretty much a neocon i don't
[01:41.600 --> 01:46.080]  agree with him on on many issues but on demographics he had it right he wrote a book a few years ago
[01:46.080 --> 01:53.760]  called america alone and in that he talked about the size of families of europeans versus muslims
[01:53.760 --> 02:00.320]  versus third world countries of course he chalked it all up to just sociological change i think
[02:00.320 --> 02:06.640]  that's a big part of it as well but i think that many people are not looking at the deliberate
[02:06.640 --> 02:12.080]  things that are done to our food and water supply that reduce our fertility we've talked about that
[02:12.080 --> 02:18.320]  a great deal here at info wars that is certainly a part of the equation that transcends social issues
[02:18.320 --> 02:24.720]  transcends religion but we're also going to talk about how the goal of this imam and many people
[02:24.720 --> 02:28.720]  as we understand as we look at this massive wave of immigration we need to understand there's
[02:28.720 --> 02:33.040]  humanitarian crisis we need to understand the origin of that crisis that was something's just
[02:33.040 --> 02:38.320]  glossed over in the discussion that we have with our political leaders they don't talk about the
[02:38.320 --> 02:45.120]  origins of this how we created this and we decided that we were going to overthrow the Assad regime
[02:45.120 --> 02:51.200]  in syria we began the war we let the fire we created the humanitarian crisis it would have been
[02:51.200 --> 02:57.360]  much larger much sooner if we hadn't stood against it and we thank you for standing with us for
[02:57.360 --> 03:02.640]  spreading the information as we discovered the sarin false flag attacks many other things that
[03:02.640 --> 03:07.600]  were done to try to push this war it isn't that obama didn't want to prosecute this war obama
[03:07.600 --> 03:12.560]  do anything the military industrial complex wants him to do it's one of the ways that he's betrayed
[03:12.560 --> 03:16.880]  his base one of the things that we look at when we look at this presidential race is we need to
[03:16.880 --> 03:23.040]  understand how if we get invested personally in a presidential candidate as we saw with obama
[03:23.040 --> 03:28.560]  eight years ago as we're now seeing with donald trump and we don't vet the person and their policies
[03:28.560 --> 03:34.960]  that we're going to get something very similar to what we've got with obama whether it's a democrat
[03:34.960 --> 03:40.160]  or republican thomas hall has an editorial we're going to talk about that today about now is not
[03:40.160 --> 03:46.400]  the time to get emotionally involved with a man we need to focus on issues we need to understand
[03:46.400 --> 03:51.760]  that if we're really going to change these problems it's an information problem we have low
[03:51.760 --> 03:57.920]  information voters who are following the crowd getting irrationally exuberant to put it in the
[03:57.920 --> 04:03.760]  phrases of alan greenspan about a particular candidate we need to grab them by the lapels we
[04:03.760 --> 04:10.000]  need to show them the documentaries get them to a different news source let them see what is going
[04:10.000 --> 04:17.120]  on in reality and then we need to act on the issues not coalesce around a man but coalesce
[04:17.120 --> 04:22.080]  around issues there's a story we're going to be covering today ram paul asked 100 000 pastors
[04:22.080 --> 04:28.720]  to help mobilize the grassroots to defund planned parenthood don't cynically just dismiss this as
[04:28.720 --> 04:34.960]  a campaign move this is something that we really need to see happen whether it's being led by a
[04:34.960 --> 04:39.760]  political candidate or whether he's being led by other people we've got jaryl salenti starting occupy
[04:39.760 --> 04:43.920]  peace this weekend we talked him as part of the money bomb we need to coalesce around the important
[04:43.920 --> 04:48.640]  issues we need to work at the local level and to do that you need information stay with us
[04:48.640 --> 04:52.160]  we're going to be back we've got a lot of information a lot of guests wane madson's
[04:52.160 --> 04:54.800]  going to be joining us paul joseph watson is going to be joining us
[05:00.240 --> 05:07.360]  there's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now and if you're wondering how on
[05:07.360 --> 05:13.840]  earth we ever got in this situation well i'll tell you how when the democrats showed their true colors
[05:13.840 --> 05:20.000]  you got angry and you elected republicans and then when the republicans showed their true colors
[05:20.000 --> 05:27.040]  you got angry and elected democrats and when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt
[05:27.040 --> 05:33.680]  and that neither side were looking out for your best interest you acted like they were crazy but
[05:33.680 --> 05:40.800]  the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different
[05:40.800 --> 05:48.800]  results that's why it is vitally important that you wake up america and break the matrix info wars

[08:04.880 --> 08:18.400]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[08:21.760 --> 08:27.120]  jones here with my co-host david night thanking all the info warriors who the last few days
[08:27.120 --> 08:35.040]  made history by donating to the 2015 operation money bomb war chest we have raised close to a
[08:35.040 --> 08:42.400]  million dollars that is absolutely essential to beam via satellite to thousands of u h f v h f
[08:42.400 --> 08:48.160]  and cable stations around north america and all the way down into central america the world is
[08:48.160 --> 08:53.200]  hungry for the message of liberty and one of the favorite refrains of our founding fathers
[08:53.200 --> 08:59.200]  was that all the evil men and piracy to flourish is that good men and women do nothing so we're
[08:59.200 --> 09:04.480]  not claiming that we're going to save the world by doing this but together taking action in little
[09:04.480 --> 09:12.160]  ways small ways big ways huge ways we are going to change the course of history what the globalist
[09:12.160 --> 09:18.640]  are doing is incredibly unpopular it's illegal it's tyrannical whether it's harvesting baby parts
[09:18.640 --> 09:24.560]  worldwide and china selling organs whether it's the forced inoculation agenda planetary wide
[09:24.560 --> 09:29.280]  whether it's funding radical islamic groups to destabilize areas of the world it's all
[09:29.280 --> 09:34.160]  criminal and it's all run by the same people so because we've done the research because we know
[09:34.160 --> 09:39.920]  who the enemy is it's our responsibility to not just sit here and reach 20 30 million people a
[09:39.920 --> 09:46.160]  week so we're launching the first phase of a program to eventually have satellites covering
[09:46.160 --> 09:53.440]  free to air the entire populated world and we've built the team now with david night and the other
[09:53.440 --> 09:58.400]  reporters and anchors and the journalist and the investigative researchers and the writers
[09:58.400 --> 10:02.960]  to really give the globalists around with their money we're about to update info wars.com and
[10:02.960 --> 10:07.520]  prisonplanet.com with new more modern designs we're about to launch a lot of new things here
[10:07.520 --> 10:12.640]  but i just wanted to thank all of you who did donate who bought the products in the last two
[10:12.640 --> 10:17.680]  days because you've raised almost a million dollars but it's been three years since we've
[10:17.680 --> 10:23.280]  had a fundraiser and i want to actually reach our goal of a million dollars we need to do it
[10:23.280 --> 10:27.520]  to be able to get a couple more reporters some of the more expensive equipment we need we've paid
[10:27.520 --> 10:32.000]  for the satellite we've paid for the close captioning we've paid for a lot of the groundwork
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.480]  to get this going we're already up on the satellite affiliates are already tuning in
[10:36.480 --> 10:43.120]  already signing on right now so thank god and thank all of you but now we need to go to that next level
[10:43.120 --> 10:48.720]  to ensure that over the next 12 months we're able to complete this operation and my plan is to then
[10:48.720 --> 10:54.800]  make it self-sufficient and we'll never have another fundraiser again we may it was three years
[10:54.800 --> 11:00.080]  since i had another one we want to again not be under the control of sponsors not be under the
[11:00.080 --> 11:06.560]  control of outside advertisers we want to be independent selling high quality products that
[11:06.560 --> 11:12.000]  you believe in that you use that you like but occasionally we do come to you to ask us to
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.080]  help bring this operation to the next level but you've got to feel really good right now
[11:16.080 --> 11:20.960]  knowing that you've done that and we've pretty much reached our goals but in the interest of that
[11:22.160 --> 11:29.200]  we want to extend the sales massive sales of upwards of 20 off free shipping you name it on
[11:29.200 --> 11:36.560]  hundreds of items at info or store.com you can also call 888-253-3139 we're going to run that
[11:36.560 --> 11:43.920]  through friday saturday into sunday at six o'clock central standard time david's going to be hosting
[11:43.920 --> 11:49.120]  the sunday show this weekend and when it ends we will have to turn off those specials because
[11:49.120 --> 11:55.680]  we're contractually through some of these suppliers unable to continue to offer some of these products
[11:55.680 --> 12:01.520]  at the prices we're offering uh because it hurts the competition a little too much so again i want
[12:01.520 --> 12:07.440]  to thank you all i want to invite you to double down on this revolution against tyranny or if
[12:07.440 --> 12:11.920]  you haven't donated or if you haven't checked out the great products at info or store.com i
[12:11.920 --> 12:16.720]  want to invite you to check it out david night you've been here three years we don't use teleprompters
[12:16.720 --> 12:21.280]  we don't script this i just called you in here five minutes ago and said i want to thank everybody
[12:21.280 --> 12:27.520]  i want to encourage them to be part of this this is historic what we're doing and i wanted you i'm
[12:27.520 --> 12:31.920]  telling you now to speak to what it's been like for you being here three years and where you see
[12:31.920 --> 12:37.200]  the info war going from this point because you didn't win a contest five years ago you entered
[12:37.200 --> 12:42.640]  but out of that we offered to hire you you move your family down here from the carolinas and i
[12:42.640 --> 12:46.960]  want you to share your experience teleprompter free unscripted of what it's been like and have a
[12:46.960 --> 12:51.840]  message for folks but most importantly i wanted to thank you as representative of the listeners
[12:51.840 --> 12:56.400]  who don't just stand as i've said beside us but at the heart of what we're doing david night was a
[12:56.400 --> 13:00.960]  listener and a family man and a business owner and engineer and he pulled up stakes and came down
[13:00.960 --> 13:06.240]  here and now he's hosting the show now he's reaching tens of millions and so he's a microcosm
[13:06.240 --> 13:11.920]  of what supporting ideas does evil's only winning because good men and women haven't got off the
[13:11.920 --> 13:16.080]  bench in the fight so david i want you to close this out spend a few minutes but i love you and
[13:16.080 --> 13:20.960]  your family and i appreciate you thank you so amazing to work with such great people thank you
[13:20.960 --> 13:27.040]  so much and i i can tell you that what i've seen here in this amount of time is how alex is pouring
[13:27.040 --> 13:33.360]  this back into expanding the information outreach we're not sitting on a horde of gold like some
[13:33.360 --> 13:38.800]  kind of a dragon he is investing this i've seen massive changes not only expansion of the number
[13:38.800 --> 13:42.880]  of personnel but also expansion in the studios that we've put there which is essential for us
[13:42.880 --> 13:48.080]  to be able to reach out to people to have something that looks professional people won't tune in and
[13:48.080 --> 13:52.160]  listen to if you're trying to reach somebody that's never heard this message before you've got a lot
[13:52.160 --> 13:56.400]  of obstacles in front of you because they've never heard these this kind of information before
[13:56.400 --> 14:01.840]  they're getting a very different story from the uh the planned information that's coming out of the
[14:01.840 --> 14:05.840]  mainstream media and so when we hit them with very different information if we look extremely
[14:05.840 --> 14:10.720]  different that's very difficult for us to reach them so we have to have a certain way to present it
[14:10.720 --> 14:15.600]  we have to have certain ways that we can reach out to people that's what i've seen alex doing is
[14:15.600 --> 14:22.160]  investing in this all out as i said before when we saw what happened uh with sandy hook we knew
[14:22.160 --> 14:26.240]  what was going to be done with this we knew this was a massive push to take away the second
[14:26.240 --> 14:30.960]  amendment we know how important all of our rights are but we know that the second amendment
[14:30.960 --> 14:36.080]  is guaranteeing these other rights as well and i remember how it was it was like this money bomb
[14:36.080 --> 14:41.920]  effort for a couple of weeks at the very beginning it was around the clock pushing back against this
[14:41.920 --> 14:46.400]  what can we do how can we expose where they're going with this what they're doing with this
[14:46.400 --> 14:51.040]  so we've seen this happen over and over again it's going to happen again there's been multiple
[14:51.040 --> 14:56.640]  times since i've been here that we have made a difference you passing our information along
[14:56.640 --> 15:01.360]  you being a subscriber to the nightly news when we were fighting against these expansions in the
[15:01.360 --> 15:06.800]  war in syria when they had the false flag attacks with the sarin gas we explained that to people
[15:06.800 --> 15:11.280]  we were leading the fight and explaining to people what was really going on there now it's
[15:11.280 --> 15:16.640]  breaking that our government has been working with chechen rebels bringing them and training them
[15:16.640 --> 15:22.240]  and injecting them into syria going back to 2012 mainstream media is reporting that now
[15:22.240 --> 15:27.040]  reporting the fact that we have american troops on the ground in syria a day after everybody
[15:27.040 --> 15:31.520]  was saying it's so dangerous and provocative that putin is saying he's going to put russian troops
[15:31.520 --> 15:37.600]  there so it's very important it has real world consequences for all of us to understand what
[15:37.600 --> 15:42.960]  is behind this what is happening that's why it is imperative for all of us to understand what's
[15:42.960 --> 15:48.640]  going on and to warn our neighbors what's going on there's been so many issues on which info wars
[15:48.640 --> 15:53.440]  has been a real game changer what we've made a real difference with you with your support that's why
[15:53.440 --> 15:58.720]  it's vital for you to join with us and support us now thank you so much for standing with us
[15:58.720 --> 16:04.000]  thank you so much for your support let's get that last bit of effort to finish this off
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.080]  for info wars nightly news and for the alex jones radio show i'm david night

[24:18.720 --> 24:26.080]  2015 we have a couple of stories up on info wars dot com 2000 migrants arriving in sweden every day
[24:26.080 --> 24:32.480]  will this country turn into an islamic caliphate well that's what some top imams hope it will happen
[24:32.480 --> 24:37.280]  they we're going to play a video for you in just a moment i'm going to narrate it it's in a foreign
[24:37.280 --> 24:41.120]  language i'm going to narrate to you what he has to say of course paul just wants and has an article
[24:41.120 --> 24:48.480]  about that paul is going to be joining us in the next segment to talk about that as well as this
[24:48.480 --> 24:55.520]  story we see all the story about the clock kid and we have a story up on info wars i come from
[24:55.520 --> 25:01.760]  steve watson is this a fake hate scenario did they set this whole thing up is the clock kid
[25:01.760 --> 25:07.760]  for all a big setup the muslim's kid's father is a prominent anti islamophobia activists
[25:07.760 --> 25:13.600]  police knew there was no danger but they arrested him anyway look if you take a look at the first
[25:13.600 --> 25:18.560]  it sounds kind of ridiculous right we've seen this happening over and over and over again
[25:18.560 --> 25:23.520]  in the schools with guns we've seen kids as leon macadoo pointed out the other night during the
[25:23.520 --> 25:28.560]  money bomb she said we've seen kids uh suspended from school because the teacher said you ate
[25:28.560 --> 25:34.720]  your pop tart into the shape of a gun or you drew a gun on a sheet of paper so we're going to suspend
[25:34.720 --> 25:40.640]  you this kid created something that looked very much like a suitcase bomb if you look at the
[25:40.640 --> 25:44.960]  article you can see the pictures of it it's a briefcase it's got electronic components it's
[25:44.960 --> 25:50.560]  got a circuit board in it it's got a um it's got a clock in it all this kind of stuff i mean it looks
[25:50.560 --> 25:57.680]  like the kind of props that they would use in an episode of 24 for a bomb okay so this is not
[25:58.240 --> 26:02.880]  drawing a picture of a gun it's not pointing your finger at somebody and going pow pow like we used
[26:02.880 --> 26:07.360]  to do all the time when i was in school it's not eating your pop tart into the shape of a gun and
[26:07.360 --> 26:13.680]  of course this guy is an activist about islamophobia so he sends his muslim kid to school with something
[26:13.680 --> 26:17.440]  that looks like a suitcase bomb and then when they make a big deal out of it's like you're
[26:17.440 --> 26:22.880]  picking on us but then it gets even more important because now we've got zuckerberg with facebook
[26:22.880 --> 26:27.840]  and we've got obama inviting him to the white house did he ever ever invite any of these kids
[26:27.840 --> 26:32.800]  who are picked on for all these trivial issues in the paranoid schools did he ever invite any of
[26:32.800 --> 26:38.000]  them to the white house of course he didn't of course he didn't now the dad says mohammad will
[26:38.000 --> 26:44.160]  not be returning to public school he says i want to make sure this never happens again
[26:44.160 --> 26:51.280]  to another child globally globally globally yeah see they have that agenda it's a global agenda
[26:51.280 --> 26:57.520]  it's an islamic agenda to take over the country now we got a a kid in georgia who comes back and
[26:57.520 --> 27:03.360]  blasts the white house for this this is a georgia teen who went to youtube this weekend or just this
[27:03.360 --> 27:08.160]  week i should say because this is a more recent story than that and blasts obama for this is
[27:08.160 --> 27:14.400]  kids a conservative he's done other videos this particular video has hit over uh 330
[27:14.400 --> 27:20.240]  view thousand views at this point in time and of course he says why are you doing this and of course
[27:20.240 --> 27:28.080]  what there's a lot more to it than just obama trying to cow cow to muslims it's interesting
[27:28.080 --> 27:34.080]  that in a question and answer session in a public event trump has been excoriated because a guy
[27:34.080 --> 27:39.920]  stood up and says hey we've got obama who's a muslim he's not even a citizen and i want to
[27:39.920 --> 27:44.240]  ask you about these camps that are being built everywhere and everybody says wait a minute
[27:44.240 --> 27:50.720]  wait a minute donald trump should have dressed that guy down the daily mail says there's outrage
[27:50.720 --> 27:56.240]  as donald trump fails to correct an ignorant supporter who stood up and said obama is a muslim
[27:56.240 --> 28:03.840]  not even american and obama they said john mccain did that back in 2008 trump said the real issue
[28:03.840 --> 28:09.920]  is obama's war on christians and that's that is true that is true he said that in response
[28:09.920 --> 28:15.280]  to that he didn't apologize listen if you want to know about obama's background you need to
[28:15.280 --> 28:20.720]  take a look at the movie that came out a couple years ago called the act of killing it's kind of
[28:20.720 --> 28:26.240]  a quasi art film quasi documentary quasi acting this out they talked to some guys who were part of
[28:26.240 --> 28:34.080]  the death squads of the indonesian government that was allied with the cia it was essentially a
[28:34.080 --> 28:40.560]  marriage that mirrored the family that obama grew up in his dad was part of this ruthless regime
[28:40.560 --> 28:46.080]  that the cia supported there and continues to support for decades this continues to remain
[28:46.080 --> 28:50.800]  there these guys were talking about how they brought people in and executed them cold-hearted
[28:50.800 --> 28:55.600]  killers bragging about it they at first they went in and they started talking to some villagers
[28:55.600 --> 28:58.640]  and they started getting some pushback from the government there but then they found some of the
[28:58.640 --> 29:02.640]  guys who had actually done the killing were more than happy to talk about it they're more than happy
[29:02.640 --> 29:08.880]  to call themselves gangsters you have to understand that obama grew up in this country with somebody
[29:08.880 --> 29:15.520]  who was part of that ruthless regime somebody who was his mother was part of the cia family her
[29:15.520 --> 29:20.320]  her parents were cia she was hanging out in the place where the cia people always hang out in
[29:20.320 --> 29:25.680]  these foreign countries that's the environment where he grew up when he went to school in a madrasa
[29:25.680 --> 29:29.840]  he grew up in that country you want to talk about anchor babies talk about anchor presidents talk about
[29:29.840 --> 29:36.400]  menschurian candidates regardless of what his technically legal situation is that was the
[29:36.400 --> 29:40.960]  environment he grew up in that's why he's hostile to america that's why he's hostile to christianity
[29:40.960 --> 29:45.920]  that's why he's hostile to our constitution he just he despises this country we've got another
[29:45.920 --> 29:51.440]  article about how he wants to make it possible we're only large they will be right on the run
[29:52.320 --> 29:55.120]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[33:28.000 --> 33:32.400]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this friday september 18 2015 i'm david night your
[33:32.400 --> 33:36.960]  host and like greg allman sometimes i do feel like i'm tied to the whipping post you're gonna
[33:36.960 --> 33:41.440]  feel like it too if obama has his way because he's got about another year and a half to go
[33:41.440 --> 33:46.640]  so we may be all excited about the gop debates and think yeah we're going to get a new big
[33:46.640 --> 33:51.520]  brother but you know what he can do a lot of damage in the next couple of years a lot of
[33:51.520 --> 33:56.560]  damage has happened in just the last couple of months in europe for example we have massive
[33:56.560 --> 34:00.720]  waves of immigrants that are coming in people are trying to deal with that particular problem
[34:00.720 --> 34:06.400]  they don't even have time most of them to really take a close look at the origins of that problem
[34:06.400 --> 34:11.600]  of course there is a massive humanitarian issue there we can aid people in the country though
[34:11.600 --> 34:16.640]  one of the first things we could do to aid them is to stop fermenting the war you didn't hear
[34:16.640 --> 34:24.960]  any talk during the gop debate about the confessions of the top isis military commander about how he
[34:24.960 --> 34:31.440]  was trained by the u.s military how the u.s military was bringing in chechen muslims who
[34:31.440 --> 34:35.280]  had been fighting the russians bringing them into syria three years ago you didn't hear about that
[34:35.280 --> 34:41.280]  did you you didn't hear about how we equip arm and train these people how we created this force
[34:41.280 --> 34:48.240]  just like we created al qaeda initially as the mujahideen no this is something that's just organically
[34:48.240 --> 34:53.520]  sprung up and we have to respond to it a similar situation i think maybe happening there's an
[34:53.520 --> 34:58.000]  article on info wars dot com from steve wasen that we just mentioned the last segment is this whole
[34:58.000 --> 35:05.840]  thing with the suitcase bomb kid the clock kid as they call him is that whole thing a setup joining
[35:05.840 --> 35:12.000]  us now is paul joseph wasen we want to talk about a video as well as these other issues a video that
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.040]  was put out by a top imam and this is an article by paul joseph wasen muslim immigrants should
[35:17.040 --> 35:22.560]  breed with europeans to quote conquer their country thank you for joining us paul joseph wasen good to
[35:22.560 --> 35:27.280]  be back david uh before we talk about this let's just give people a little bit of a sample of this
[35:27.280 --> 35:31.680]  video it's up on the article that you put up it's in a foreign language so we're going to run this
[35:31.680 --> 35:35.440]  up here and i'm going to read the subtitles to people we're gonna play a little bit of that so
[35:35.440 --> 35:41.200]  they get a feel for it and then we'll read them and talk about some of the what he actually says
[35:41.200 --> 35:48.880]  so let's let's run that video guys he says the infidels want to torment us they want to be they
[35:48.880 --> 35:54.880]  want us to be humiliated the Quran says the jews and the christians will never be pleased with you
[35:54.880 --> 36:04.720]  but we will never follow their religion this dark night will be over soon we will trample them
[36:04.720 --> 36:16.160]  underfoot a la willing germany is not compassionate country that wishes to absorb refugees from
[36:16.160 --> 36:22.480]  syria and iraq and palestinian refugees and the levant and elsewhere you know what neither
[36:22.480 --> 36:27.200]  are the saudi arabians he's not going to say that europe has become old and decrepit now here's the
[36:27.200 --> 36:33.600]  key part here they see europe is old decrepit he says they need human reinforcements no force
[36:33.600 --> 36:40.640]  is more powerful than the human force of us muslims oh muslims the germans say in their economic
[36:40.640 --> 36:49.920]  reports that they need 50 000 young workers that's exactly it let's go back to paul joseph
[36:49.920 --> 36:56.080]  watson that's a flavor paul of what he's saying and of course he's making a demographic argument
[36:56.080 --> 37:01.840]  he's he's saying that europe is weak it's dying and you know quite frankly that's true if we look at
[37:01.840 --> 37:07.360]  the demographics as i pointed out earlier mark stein the canadian ultra conservative had pointed
[37:07.360 --> 37:11.600]  out that birth rates were falling so dramatically in europe that for example the italians who used
[37:11.600 --> 37:16.320]  to be one of the have have one of the highest birth rates they now have a birth rate that is so low
[37:16.320 --> 37:21.760]  it's just barely above one so that population in italy the uh indigenous italian population
[37:21.760 --> 37:26.640]  is being cut in half every generation meanwhile you have third world countries especially muslim
[37:26.640 --> 37:33.120]  countries where they have an average of five children per family uh as if they come in and
[37:33.120 --> 37:38.240]  any great numbers and this was written maybe a decade 15 years ago they come in in any great
[37:38.240 --> 37:45.600]  numbers what he talked about was europe becoming arabia your comments paul well this is what the
[37:45.600 --> 37:50.240]  muslim imam went on to say at the end of this video which was during a speech at the alaskan
[37:50.240 --> 37:56.560]  mosque in jr he said quote they wish that we were dead but they have lost their fertility he's talking
[37:56.560 --> 38:03.760]  about europe so they look for fertility in our midst we will give them fertility we will breed
[38:03.760 --> 38:10.160]  children with them because we shall conquer their countries he goes on to say whether they like it or
[38:10.160 --> 38:15.600]  not americans italians germans and the french will be forced to take refugees and quote we
[38:15.600 --> 38:20.240]  shall soon collect them in the name of the coming caliphate we will say to you these are our sons
[38:20.240 --> 38:25.600]  feed them or send them or we will send our armies to you so he said that during a speech and
[38:26.320 --> 38:31.680]  you made the point he's basically everything he says is true this might be a sendiary which it is
[38:32.400 --> 38:38.640]  but you mentioned italy for example they had a birth rate of around two children per couple
[38:38.640 --> 38:48.640]  back in 1960 now it's 1.3 now if you take that 1.3 figure over the next 45 years italy's native
[38:48.640 --> 38:56.000]  population is going to halve in just 45 years similar case with germany they they're losing
[38:56.000 --> 39:05.440]  100 000 people annually so we're being told absolute lies and bonk about this refugee crisis being
[39:05.440 --> 39:11.280]  about you know humanitarian compassionate you know all based on feelings that's why germany's
[39:11.280 --> 39:18.000]  bringing in 800 000 asylum seekers before the end of the year as this imam says that's completely
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.520]  false they're bringing them in because they need the cheap labor because in the west governments
[39:23.520 --> 39:28.880]  have not incentivized not encouraged their populations to have children like they have
[39:28.880 --> 39:34.560]  done in the middle east and other areas and that's for numerous different reasons one of the main
[39:34.560 --> 39:41.920]  ones is as the west has become more secular children have become increasingly viewed as a burden
[39:42.480 --> 39:48.640]  in the present and not to secure the future of the population of that particular country
[39:48.640 --> 39:54.560]  so europe is completely dying out that's why they need to bring in these hordes of migrants for
[39:54.560 --> 40:02.080]  cheap labor it has nothing to do with many cases with syrian refugees um half of the syrian refugees
[40:02.080 --> 40:08.880]  coming in well it's about 50 that are syrian but of those 50 90 can't even prove that they're syrian
[40:08.880 --> 40:15.360]  in some areas so this is being completely exploited by economic migrants to flee to the welfare
[40:15.360 --> 40:21.200]  havens of countries like sweden and germany and according to these islamic preachers they're gonna
[40:21.200 --> 40:27.120]  do it to conquer the countries that those are his words not mine and in fact if you go into the
[40:27.120 --> 40:33.680]  Quran it states quote and whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many
[40:33.680 --> 40:39.920]  locations and abundance so there are several sections in the Quran which um encourage muslims
[40:39.920 --> 40:45.760]  who emigrate to other non-muslim countries as a form of stealth jihad and we've talked about
[40:46.320 --> 40:51.840]  about that in the past we've covered articles about it so shocking statements but he's telling the
[40:51.840 --> 40:57.040]  truth basically we're being told that this is all about compassionate humanitarianism when it's not
[40:57.040 --> 41:02.560]  they're bringing in these huge amounts of refugees migrants to fill cheap labor and it's going to
[41:02.560 --> 41:07.840]  have terrible consequences in terms of social cohesion in europe which we're already beginning
[41:07.840 --> 41:12.400]  to see oh absolutely you know you mentioned several different factors there we've got cheap labor
[41:12.400 --> 41:17.520]  we've got supporting the welfare state ponzi scheme and of course there's the divide and conquer
[41:17.520 --> 41:21.280]  aspect of it the cheap labor and the divide and conquer are the sorts of things that we see
[41:21.280 --> 41:25.840]  the governments want to divide and conquer to control the people the corporations want cheap
[41:25.840 --> 41:31.840]  labor and the people there at the lower level from those who are at the very top we're pushing
[41:31.840 --> 41:35.280]  for a globalist government i think those people are looking at saying well you know if we could
[41:35.280 --> 41:39.200]  keep this welfare state going because you know we need workers at the bottom to support people
[41:39.200 --> 41:43.360]  who are on social security the retirees and that sort of thing people need to understand
[41:43.360 --> 41:47.920]  that the first place they had social security was in germany and was put in by a bismarck
[41:47.920 --> 41:54.400]  he picked the age of 65 because that was the life expectancy they didn't expect to pay anybody
[41:54.400 --> 41:59.600]  anything they wanted you to pay into this ponzi scheme and again it's a ponzi scheme because
[41:59.600 --> 42:04.000]  you have to keep it doesn't pay for itself you have to keep getting more and more people
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.320]  into the scheme to keep it going that's one of the reasons that they're looking for this and
[42:08.320 --> 42:12.560]  of course the the cheap labor but paul we look at the divide and conquer aspect of this as these
[42:12.560 --> 42:17.440]  refugees are coming up through syria going in through hungry if we look at the the geography
[42:17.440 --> 42:22.720]  of this they're coming up through hungry the eastern european countries those countries were
[42:22.720 --> 42:28.560]  on the front line of the conflict with islam hundreds of years ago a thousand years ago
[42:28.560 --> 42:34.000]  they knew what that was like they've also suffered under the privations of socialism
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.440]  they're not interested in having this massive influx of people who cannot be assimilated
[42:39.440 --> 42:45.280]  who they are aware of in their history has been a a source of conflict within their countries
[42:45.280 --> 42:50.560]  that's one of the reasons why they're closing their borders yeah that's that's what's happening
[42:50.560 --> 42:56.000]  in the case of hungary of course the hungarian prime minister victor orban came out a few weeks ago
[42:56.000 --> 43:03.360]  and said europe is based on christian foundations and principles moving in potentially millions of
[43:03.360 --> 43:08.320]  people who aren't assimilated who have a different culture who follow a different religion that's
[43:08.320 --> 43:14.560]  going to have a massive impact on social cohesion he was called xenophobic by the new york times
[43:14.560 --> 43:20.160]  and others simply for making that point and as he said it's also about how these european countries
[43:20.160 --> 43:26.880]  like hungry are being punished for defying the eu it's all about centralizing power under the
[43:26.880 --> 43:33.520]  eu to the point where sovereign nations have no control over their own border policies so whereas
[43:33.520 --> 43:41.200]  countries like the united kingdom have got optouts others are wedded into this eu superstate bureaucracy
[43:41.200 --> 43:46.240]  where they have to go along with anything that comes out of germany so it's that it's a power
[43:46.240 --> 43:50.960]  struggle between these countries who are trying to reclaim some of their sovereignty and the eu
[43:50.960 --> 43:56.400]  which is forcing them to go along with it but even now germany of course they rolled out the red
[43:56.400 --> 44:02.160]  carpet over the first couple of weeks as this migrant crisis you know went from being a trickle
[44:02.160 --> 44:08.560]  to a to a deluge basically but even now germany's reimposing some of the border controls and how
[44:08.560 --> 44:13.840]  could they not have known that this is what would happen you roll out the red carpet you say
[44:13.840 --> 44:18.320]  you know we've got benefits we got welfare we've got housing there are reports that they're now
[44:18.320 --> 44:24.320]  kicking out elderly homeless people who are being given temporary social housing in germany
[44:24.320 --> 44:29.920]  german citizens to accommodate these migrants and now germany suddenly doubles back and says oh now
[44:29.920 --> 44:34.640]  we're going to reimpose some border controls and crack down on this well it's a bit too late now
[44:34.640 --> 44:41.520]  hundreds of thousands have gotten more or on their way and i'm getting emails from people in germany
[44:41.520 --> 44:46.720]  who live near these migrant centers we've already talked about before the schools in germany that
[44:46.720 --> 44:51.760]  are banning girls from wearing shorts so as not to offend muslim migrants and provoke attacks
[44:52.320 --> 44:58.080]  now people who live in what in many cases are just small villages and towns these aren't major city
[44:58.080 --> 45:03.200]  metropolitan areas they live near these new migrant camps that have just been constructed
[45:03.200 --> 45:07.440]  to house all these incoming migrants over the past few weeks and they say that
[45:08.320 --> 45:12.320]  because bearing in mind these aren't prisons i mean they're allowed out of these camps
[45:12.320 --> 45:17.920]  they're saying that hundreds of men are just congregating on street corners because again
[45:17.920 --> 45:22.960]  there's no plan to assimilate them they're just being allowed to roam around and congregate
[45:22.960 --> 45:28.000]  and people are scared young girls their wives they're scared of going out because there are
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.800]  literally hundreds of men just stood around in certain areas of these villages and towns
[45:32.800 --> 45:39.760]  there was another guy in finland who sent me a message and he basically said look they they
[45:39.760 --> 45:45.360]  changed the local bar into a migrant camp there are there are like a hundred men there because
[45:45.360 --> 45:52.080]  bearing in mind the un's own figures say that 72 percent of these migrants are men only 13 percent
[45:52.080 --> 45:58.080]  women and 15 percent children so this lie that it's all syrian families is completely bogus and
[45:58.080 --> 46:05.520]  this finished guy just said to me i have a blonde wife i have two blonde blue eyed children and i
[46:05.520 --> 46:13.680]  have a shotgun and that's you know oh my god that sounds racist look at sweden 1400 percent increase
[46:13.680 --> 46:19.520]  in rapes since they opened their door to mass immigration yes because again there's no assimilation
[46:19.520 --> 46:25.360]  plan so people are frightened people are not going out they're not they don't dare to go near these
[46:25.360 --> 46:31.040]  migrant centers you know schools in germany are now saying don't offend the migrants or provoke attacks
[46:31.040 --> 46:37.680]  we had a an incident in berlin yesterday where um a jihadist tried to stab a police woman they had
[46:37.680 --> 46:43.120]  to shoot him so people are frightened and people are gearing up because you can't just flood small
[46:43.120 --> 46:48.080]  villages full of hundreds of men from a completely different culture and not have problems i mean
[46:48.080 --> 46:52.480]  that's completely naive to suggest that exactly they're standing around they don't have anything to
[46:52.480 --> 46:57.200]  do i think there's a lot of things that we can see in this paul in terms of microcosm and in terms of
[46:57.200 --> 47:01.600]  how quickly this thing has gotten out of control that have parallels for americans here in this
[47:01.600 --> 47:05.920]  country with our open borders we've been talking about this things have been accelerating for us
[47:05.920 --> 47:14.160]  here in america but we see with this rapid movement throughout europe we can see what is happening there
[47:14.160 --> 47:19.040]  you talked about incentives and we talk about building a wall here the republicans are talking
[47:19.040 --> 47:22.880]  about doing that i think it's very telling for people take a look at what happened in in hungary
[47:22.880 --> 47:27.760]  where they put up razor wire they're shooting water cannons at these people tear gas nevertheless
[47:27.760 --> 47:33.600]  they came through the razor wire as these people were fighting them if you give people an incentive
[47:33.600 --> 47:40.640]  whether it is destroying their home country and then offering them uh the this um uh these these
[47:40.640 --> 47:45.920]  incentives of the welfare state that's what's going on right now we see that uh in spades in europe
[47:45.920 --> 47:50.160]  but essentially that's what's going on in central and south america as well we've got a war going on
[47:50.160 --> 47:56.960]  there the drug war that has killed more people than have died in afghanistan it's a lower slower
[47:56.960 --> 48:00.800]  simmering war that's been going on for a long time but we're destroying their countries nevertheless
[48:00.800 --> 48:06.640]  and then at the same time we offer them the incentives these incentives of a welfare state
[48:06.640 --> 48:12.880]  of a free college essentially getting a uh in state tuition anywhere you want to go as an illegal
[48:12.880 --> 48:16.880]  and of course american citizens don't get that kind of discretion where they go to school and
[48:16.880 --> 48:21.120]  they're telling us here just like they're telling the people in europe these are all children and
[48:21.120 --> 48:27.680]  they're not children if they can get through this uh this this multi-thousand-mile journey
[48:27.680 --> 48:33.280]  they're being escorted by people perhaps traffickers but the definition of children that obama has
[48:33.280 --> 48:39.040]  put out there is people up to the age of 31 those are the dreamers age so this is all predicated
[48:39.040 --> 48:44.240]  on a lie but we have to understand that we cannot interdict with force when we create
[48:44.240 --> 48:48.320]  a war of destruction in their countries where we deliberately destroy their countries and then
[48:48.320 --> 48:54.640]  offer them incentives to emigrate into the west no and this is a point that we've touched upon
[48:54.640 --> 48:59.760]  many times and it's still absent from the mainstream media narrative which is don't destabilize
[48:59.760 --> 49:04.880]  secular governments in the middle east and put jihadists into power it's very simple and yet
[49:04.880 --> 49:10.080]  they keep doing it over and over again and many of these syrian refugees at least the legitimate
[49:10.080 --> 49:14.720]  ones want to return to syria they don't want to stay in europe because they had a relatively
[49:14.720 --> 49:21.440]  high standard of living in syria so yeah that this could it offer its source don't give bombs and
[49:21.440 --> 49:27.840]  weapons to jihadists invest in these countries keep them stable and improve their quality of life
[49:27.840 --> 49:32.480]  and then we wouldn't have a migrant crisis in the first place let me ask you about another
[49:32.480 --> 49:38.400]  article that's up on info wars dot com to comment on this uh this course is your brother's article
[49:38.400 --> 49:43.920]  questioning whether or not the clock kid was a setup from the very beginning his father is an
[49:43.920 --> 49:49.920]  islamic phobic activist see he's an activist to counter islamophobia he says i want to make
[49:49.920 --> 49:56.880]  sure that this type of thing is shut down globally and so we've got obama inviting him into the
[49:56.880 --> 50:03.680]  white house because he made a clock that looked very much like a suitcase bomb your comments paul well
[50:03.680 --> 50:09.440]  this is one of those social justice warrior issues that they've all seized upon and first of all
[50:10.480 --> 50:16.080]  why you know reward him for this clock but with an invitation to the white house it doesn't even
[50:16.080 --> 50:20.480]  look like a clock no somebody if i bought that in a store and they said it was a clock i'd take it
[50:20.480 --> 50:27.280]  back i mean it it's not a clock as i said before it looks like a prop from uh 24 you know the uh
[50:27.280 --> 50:32.720]  anti-terrorism it looks like a cheap like suitcase bomb i'm sorry but it does so now there are
[50:32.720 --> 50:38.800]  questions about was it all a setup because his dad is this islamophobic activist the point i made
[50:38.800 --> 50:44.160]  was the kid who chewed out a pop tart into the shape of a cock he didn't get an invite to the
[50:44.160 --> 50:49.200]  white house people suspended for wearing american flag t-shirts they don't get invitations to the

[54:06.640 --> 54:20.640]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david i we're talking to paul joseph watson the u k we've
[54:20.640 --> 54:26.720]  been talking about his articles at info wars icon a toppy mom saying muslim migrants should
[54:26.720 --> 54:33.440]  breed with europeans to conquer their countries and of course he correctly points out that the europeans
[54:33.440 --> 54:39.680]  and i would say also to a lesser degree but certainly it is still there americans have lost
[54:39.680 --> 54:44.640]  their fertility we've seen many people argue that there's a sociological charge to it a
[54:44.640 --> 54:49.520]  part to that that's all that it is i think that is a part of it i don't think that's all there is
[54:49.520 --> 54:54.960]  to it paul i think that it's also what they're putting in our food and our water as well what
[54:54.960 --> 55:02.320]  do you think well from what i can recall writing about this in the past the figures are crazy it's
[55:02.320 --> 55:08.320]  something like a 14 percent decline in sperm count in men in a certain european country since
[55:08.320 --> 55:15.440]  the late 80s so it's been going on for you know 20 plus years um and there could be there could be
[55:15.440 --> 55:20.240]  medical causes for that yeah it's a lot of salt i think it's not only sociological but i think it's
[55:20.240 --> 55:25.440]  actually physiological in terms of that and we've mentioned many times when they put uh florida
[55:25.440 --> 55:28.960]  when they put other things in our food it's deliberate that they put this stuff in there
[55:28.960 --> 55:35.920]  yeah so we've seen declining sperm counts for for at least two decades now and then you add in the
[55:35.920 --> 55:42.320]  sociological aspect where children are increasingly seen as a financial burden they're not seen as
[55:42.320 --> 55:48.560]  providing joy and happiness and stability and securing the future not only of your family your
[55:48.560 --> 55:55.120]  lineage but the population of your country as we've become more decadent and more nihilistic in the
[55:55.120 --> 56:01.360]  west um not not just because of secularism but just generally you know people people are having
[56:01.360 --> 56:07.120]  kids later and later people used to have kids in their early 20s you know 25 30 years ago
[56:07.120 --> 56:11.840]  they're waiting longer and longer and having less kids and people are dying out europe's dying out
[56:11.840 --> 56:19.200]  europe uh italy is a 1.3 level the replacement rate is 2.1 when nowhere near that in most european
[56:19.200 --> 56:24.480]  countries so we're dying out and they're bringing in bringing in masses of illegal immigrants to try
[56:24.480 --> 56:29.760]  and get cheap labor they're doing it for other reasons another story that i've got coming up
[56:30.720 --> 56:37.520]  is people smugglers uh in these middle eastern countries are targeting uh would be economic
[56:37.520 --> 56:44.400]  migrants not refugees from syria migrants from surrounding countries with information websites
[56:44.400 --> 56:51.360]  that promise them quote free blonde swedish girls and taxpayer funded luxury treatment
[56:51.360 --> 56:58.480]  and if they pay these people smugglers to help them reach scandinavia so i'm guessing a lot of
[56:58.480 --> 57:06.000]  those quote free blonde swedish girls won't be consensual given sweden's 1400 percent
[57:06.000 --> 57:13.440]  rising rates since the 70s since they had mass immigration and again that's not a racist fact
[57:13.440 --> 57:23.040]  it's an actual fact that 73 percent or more of these culprits are listed as quote foreign as an
[57:23.040 --> 57:27.920]  immigrant even though you know less than 10 percent of the population in sweden is immigrant so they've
[57:27.920 --> 57:33.920]  got a massive problem with muslim rape gangs we had it in britain with the rotherham rape gang
[57:33.920 --> 57:40.320]  which was covered up by the government because they said it was politically incorrect to try and go
[57:40.320 --> 57:45.840]  after these rape gangs that were grooming young girls up in the northern english town of rotherham
[57:45.840 --> 57:51.280]  where i used to live so we've got a huge problem with this and it's only going to get worse now
[57:51.280 --> 57:56.640]  that they're bringing in bringing in potentially millions of muslim migrants over the next 10
[57:56.640 --> 58:02.160]  20 years absolutely of course if you point out a statistical fact showing the explosion in
[58:02.160 --> 58:07.440]  rapes in sweden with with massive immigration they push back and and say you're xenophobic
[58:07.440 --> 58:12.480]  you're racist and i think that's a big part of what's going on with this clock situation i think
[58:12.480 --> 58:19.520]  this clock kid quite frankly paul is the tawana brawley of islam we all remember that she's the
[58:19.520 --> 58:25.280]  person that al sharpton used to make himself a celebrity now obama is doing the same thing

[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:34.080]  2015 Wayne madson is going to be joining us in the next segment we're going to talk to him about
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:40.000]  the republican debate and a variety of issues of course the other thing that happened this week was
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.400]  the federal open market committee of the federal reserve they had been selling a story essentially
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:50.960]  that implied they were going to raise interest rates they've been lowering them for quite some
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:58.720]  time as a matter of fact since the economic crash back in 2008 they want to say that that was all
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:03.280]  george w bush's fault i think it was really predicated by the federal reserve i'm not
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:09.520]  saying that bush was a great president by any means but we need to understand that it is the
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:15.600]  federal reserve and the bankers that they that bush and others have complicitly let do this that
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:24.720]  are really manipulating the economy we had in the debate a silly silly question that i think the
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:31.440]  candidates should have stood up and said we're trying to discuss serious issues in this country
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:38.880]  i refuse to answer that question who should be the new face on the ten dollar bill understand
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:47.360]  that they have destroyed 99 percent of the value of the dollar who cares what clown face they put
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:53.040]  on it it has a purchasing price of a penny a hundred years ago since we created the federal reserve
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:57.040]  so the federal reserve comes out and says that they're not going to raise interest rates wall
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:02.800]  street fell this morning about one percent they had been uh stocks had been rising on anticipation
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.240]  that the federal reserve would raise interest rates there you go you know bad news for the
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:11.600]  country is always good news for wall street evidently uh asian stocks however were higher they are
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:18.800]  happy that it looks like this uh extend and pretend is going to go on a little bit longer
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:24.960]  they have now uh this economic bubble has dodged another pen another story this up on info wars
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:31.600]  dot com new york police department union president patrick lynch says only police are qualified to
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:37.040]  judge the actions of the police citizens are increasingly being removed from the decision
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:42.080]  making process that's right they're going to do whatever they wish along those lines we're
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:48.000]  going to talk about what was not mentioned in the gop debate and that of course is the war on
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.120]  private property that goes by the name of the war on drugs you would think perhaps wouldn't you
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:03:00.160]  that the gop that is all about private property and taxes uh that's one of the few rights that they
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:07.120]  seem to recognize and yet through ronald reagan's uh civil asset forfeiture program
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:12.720]  since that's been in place they have been stealing people's property law enforcement
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:17.680]  is basically funding themselves and many jurisdictions and now that there's a pushback
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:23.200]  in california and some other states to try to rein in this literal highway robbery this literal
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:28.240]  theft by the police they've turned this is the way it corrupts our government to have prohibition
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:33.440]  it's turned the police into outright thieves that's the way many of them fund their departments
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.320]  as i mentioned you don't get due process that's guaranteed you're not convicted in a court of
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:43.840]  your peers instead what they do is they seize your property never charging you with a crime
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.240]  they call it civil which means that you have to take them to court and sue them civilly
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:55.040]  in order to get your property back that's one of the lies about this that it's a civil action the
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:00.000]  other lie is that they charge the property itself with committing a crime but of course
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  whether it's that or whether it's the abuse that is committed on citizens both of those are being
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.400]  driven from the federal government from homeland security by the department of justice by others
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:18.320]  who are now trying to stop any blocking of civil asset forfeiture they're now trying to stop any
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:25.520]  accountability of police who are out of control as we've mentioned many times the police like any
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.360]  other profession is going to have good people and it's going to have bad people in it frank
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.720]  serpico said that he said you're always going to have bad people the question is how what do you
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:42.000]  do do you purge the bad people or do you defend them if you purge them you improve the system if
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.760]  you protect them you create systemic corruption and that's what we have with the new york police
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.480]  union saying nobody is going to judge us but the police there you go we'll be right back
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:05:03.200]  with Wayne Madden stay with us breaking now at info wars dot com top imam muslim migrates should
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:07.840]  breed with europeans to conquer their countries chic muhammad a'id recently gave a speech and
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.920]  when she asserted that muslims should use the migrant crisis to breed with european citizens
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:16.080]  to conquer their countries a'id stated that european countries were not rolling out the
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.920]  red carpet for migrants because they were compassionate but because europe was in dire need
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.480]  of a new source of labor soon we will trample them underfoot a la willing he said the imam
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.680]  statements directly echo a philosophy born in the early 20th century called the collergy plan
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:35.040]  devised by an austrian diplomat named richard codenhove collergy he writes the band of the future
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:39.760]  will be of mixed race today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:44.720]  of space time and prejudice the eurasian negroid race of the future similar in appearance to that
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:49.280]  of ancient egyptians will replace the diversity of peoples with the diversity of individuals

[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:28.720]  to info wars dot com we're going to talk to him he recently spoke to a 9-11 conference in the northeast
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:34.800]  he's going to talk to us about 28 pages dot org as well as what we were just talking to
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:40.800]  paul joseph whatson about he has uh information about uh what's going on in the northeast with
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:46.640]  massive immigration from muslims we have massive immigration from all over the world into the
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.160]  united states and of course the problem is that there's no effort to try to assimilate anyone
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:57.280]  we have this article from the new york times today which is saying the white house campaign
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:02.080]  urges legal immigrants to become voting citizens this is something we've been telling you for a
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:07.600]  very long time but i guess now you can believe it since the new york times is saying that okay
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:12.320]  they were conspiracy theorists when we said that obama is opening up the borders to bring in
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:17.360]  immigrants who will vote for him and he's going to register them uh make it possible for them to
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:22.720]  vote before the next election we were telling you that because we are not conspiracy theorists
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:30.160]  we're conspiracy analysts okay and the conspiracy is on obama's side okay it's not in our mind
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:36.320]  we're telling you this a very long time we were telling you that the us was equipping and training
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:40.960]  isis it's now being reported by the mainstream media all over the place totally ignored in the
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:47.600]  GOP debate of course but what they're saying about this uh urging legal immigrants to become
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.680]  voting citizens obama is doing far more than that of new york times reports white house
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:56.240]  officials announced start of a nationwide campaign on thursday to encourage legal immigrants to
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:00.720]  become american citizens they say it could add millions of voters to the electorate and time
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:05.040]  for the presidential election next year of course everybody admits and understands that they will
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:10.160]  all be voting democrat for the most part 8.8 million legal residents they say in the country
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.880]  are eligible eligible to become citizens white house officials say they were trying to make it
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:20.400]  easier to complete the final steps for citizenship you know they the first steps are you just walk
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:26.960]  over an open border because he's incentivized a massive welfare state for you done things
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.680]  like a war on drugs in your country to destroy your economy to make it incredibly violent and
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:36.480]  then and then come over here because we got this pot of gold on the other side of the river so
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:42.640]  those are the first steps the final steps are this they will offer practice tests on cell phones for
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:47.040]  the civics exam that immigrants must pass and i guess the question is is that going to be in
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:52.240]  english or is that going to be in any their choice of 80 languages like they get their choice of
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:57.200]  education they also say that they will hold preparatory workshops in rural areas applicants
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:02.640]  will also be able to pay the fee still a hefty 680 dollars they say that's all it costs to come
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.800]  into america and become a citizen it costs nothing to come into america but you know if
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:12.400]  you want a citizenship you can buy it for 680 dollars and pass a test that they will help you
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:18.720]  pass and oh by the way you can put that now on a credit card you know citizenship and welfare
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.520]  with the easy payment plan they said the white house is working with regional immigrant groups
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:29.760]  as well to organize more than 70 citizenship workshops and 200 naturalization ceremonies
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:34.720]  in the coming week alone and they're getting high name celebrity profiles like finando

[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:23.280]  tell us about the 911 conference that you were speaking at last week well the theme of this
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:29.680]  year's conference and it was in new york at the west park presbyterian church on the west side of
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:40.800]  manhattan and it concentrated on these 28 still classified pages from the joint congressional
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:50.240]  inquiry on the failures of intelligence before 911 now the former chairman of the senate intelligence
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:58.480]  committee senator former senator bob graham of florida has urged the administration to release
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:05.440]  these 28 pages as have a bipartisan group of senators and members of the house including senator
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:12.880]  ran paul senator from new york kirsten jillabrand senator ron widen democrat from
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:20.000]  oregon and on the house side republican representatives walter jones uh thomas massie
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:27.040]  of kentucky and uh democratic representative steven lynch of massachusetts and um
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:34.480]  um look the release of these pages is not going to solve the crime of 911 but it's certainly
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:44.400]  going to start opening up some doors uh to allow 911 researchers to proceed with the uh what what
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:52.240]  the 911 commission failed to do was investigate the reasons and the cause of 911 all they had
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:58.560]  all they had to offer was what the country had to do to further uh destroy our our bill of
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:04.480]  rights our constitutional rights so uh it's a step it's a step in the right direction some
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.840]  people think it's a diversion that was not the theme at the conference we of course heard from
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:19.040]  author from uh and and uh professor lance to haven smith from florida state university who
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:25.280]  of course has done an awful lot on uh not conspiracy theory but as you mentioned earlier
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:33.040]  conspiracy analysis and he considers these types of crimes to be called uh that he calls them
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:41.200]  state crimes against democracy or scat scad um so honestly when we have them selling us a
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:46.880]  national security state which has become a religion post 911 you know yesterday was
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:53.440]  constitution day i tweeted out wane i said you know we we enacted a a constitution a declaration
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:16:02.640]  of independence to declare our independence from kings but post 911 our rulers used that to publicly
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:08.000]  shred the constitution and declare their independence from a rule of law if they are going to do that
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:14.240]  here we are 14 years later they won't tell us what they said they did wrong we can't know about that
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.800]  but we're supposed to trust them we're supposed to turn over all of our freedoms we're supposed to
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.520]  overturn and destroy the legal system we're supposed to overturn and destroy law enforcement
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:28.400]  that we used to have in this country to the however they say to do this because they just
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:34.240]  invoke the magic words of national security i talked to thomas drake who's one of the nsa
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:41.360]  whistleblowers and he said look before 911 they were deliberately telling people downplaying any
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:47.920]  uh any intel that they would get about terrorism they didn't want them looking at that now we can
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:51.840]  draw our own conclusions about that he's not going to draw the conclusions for people but he
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:56.160]  will tell people what was going on with that they were deliberately downplaying it and then
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:02.640]  immediately after 911 they play that up to completely remake everything we need to see
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:07.680]  what they don't want us to see that's one of the key things that has happened of course has been the
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:12.240]  secret government that doesn't tell us anything that they're doing we don't have a right to know
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.600]  anything about what our government is doing whether it's trade treaties we're not stakeholders
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:21.040]  anymore they've made that very clear we need to see what their so-called incompetence is even if
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:26.080]  it's their official story because we've seen lie after lie after lie and their official conspiracy
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:32.880]  theory right and and we also heard from uh john perkins who of course his seminal work uh
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:38.960]  confessions of an economic hitman uh really exposed the deep state and he spoke a lot about
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:44.480]  what uh he used to be involved with on behalf of the wall street bankers and the central intelligence
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:50.080]  agency and overthrowing foreign governments and suggest that that's absolutely what occurred on
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:18:00.960]  911 so uh this uh sort of discipline uh of research is starting to i i i think uh go it's
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:06.960]  going mainstream the other important thing is uh the presidential candidates are starting to
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:13.200]  they're starting to ask them questions about where they stand on releasing the 28 pages apparently
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:19.680]  carly fiorina was asked and she said she's in favor of it and uh jeb bush of course was asked
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:27.040]  about it and he said he didn't know what the 28 pages were of course we would get that from him
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:33.680]  or he hasn't really come clean on what he what he was doing on 911 himself and he was asking where
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:40.080]  his brother marvin was like hey yeah yeah well jeb also wants margaret thatcher on the us
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:46.720]  ten dollar bill i think that jeb jeb is very confused and once again shows what happens
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:51.840]  when there's a lot of incest and a blue blood family from uh originally from kinetic it
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.920]  well you know when he said margaret thatcher goes well of course that'd be illegal but what the heck
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:01.680]  and uh as my son said yeah since when has the law ever constrained anyone in the bush family
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:06.640]  that's that's that's not even a joke anymore i mean that's the reality of it you know they call him
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.600]  as he said they they call me jeb i earned that that was i thought the best line from the very
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:16.240]  first jlp debate i i still want to know and that'd be the question i would ask him is that what does
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:21.760]  it mean to be a jeb and how does one earn that title all right he won't even use his last name
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:28.320]  he uses jeb with the next formation point following it sort of reminds me of that uh the guy the the
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:34.320]  rock star who came up with this weird symbol and he said i'm the rock star formerly known as prince
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:40.880]  so i guess jeb is the politician formerly known as bush that's right well we all know why he would
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:56.800]  want to avoid that last name stay with us we're going to be right back with wane madson

[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:42.640]  pretty much understand was a big mistake everyone except jeb bush that is because jeb bush defended
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:47.040]  this and he says you remember here's a quote from the transcript you remember the rubble
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:51.440]  the rumble i think is what it says it says that on the transcript i don't know i'm assuming he's
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:56.720]  saying the rubble but that might be a bushism or it might be a typo in the transcript you remember
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:02.480]  the rumble or the rubble he said you remember the firefighter with his arms around it i guess that's
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:09.040]  rubble then he sent a clear signal that the united states would be strong and fight islamic terrorism
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:16.720]  and he did keep us safe my brother did do you think he kept us safe wane or have we become
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:23.120]  much much more at risk with what's gone on in the middle east as well as what's gone on in our own
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:26.800]  country the overthrow of the rule of law the militarization of the police the destruction
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:31.600]  of the constitution of the legal system all of those things have made us more dangerous in my
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:36.880]  opinion i would imagine you would agree yeah well jeb of course has been opposed to the
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:42.960]  legalization of marijuana in the state of florida yes probably because he wants more of it for himself
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:49.520]  it sounds like he's smoking a lot of it because i i don't know how in the world this guy could say
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:56.640]  his brother w kept us safe and and using the uh the the symbology of the collapse
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:03.040]  uh world trade center uh is not the way to say that his brother kept us safe because
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:10.080]  other ignored repeated warnings about the terrorist uh yeah attack we know that from uh
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:18.240]  from from a national security council uh documents and and all kinds of reports beforehand so and the
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:23.040]  stand down of norad on that day i mean they had a complete collapse of all the system so his brother
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:30.400]  kept us safe you know his brother was re it was uh more interested in my pet goat in a second class
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:38.080]  second great class in sarasota florida if i recall correctly and and uh basically uh uh you know when
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:43.600]  dick chaney said don't come back to washington until later on in the day bush who for i guess
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:49.680]  forgot he was commander in chief decided to go hide in a hole in the ground in in uh outside
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:54.720]  Omaha nebraska so yeah he wasn't asking where's norad you know for a hundred minutes it's like
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:58.160]  hey what you know where the norad plains no no you know that's one of the things that uh
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:04.480]  uh goreva doll said he said uh of course related to al gore family his dad was highly connected
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:09.440]  and the military had set up the norad defense system he said i knew there was something
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:14.720]  phony about this because it didn't scramble any planes for an hour and a half nothing happened
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:22.400]  i mean obviously this is a stand down and obviously these failures were not only a obvious lie he
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:26.880]  can't defend the lies of the bush administration to get us into a right even if you start with the
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:33.600]  lies about 9 11 going to iraq was another set of fresh new lies that they piled on top of that
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:42.160]  absolutely and and this is why uh people like bush uh jeb bush says what 28 pages he knows full
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:48.320]  well what's in those 28 pages he knows it points the finger directly at at bandar prince bandar
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:54.160]  the saudi ambassador to washington during 9 11 who was so close to his family the bush family
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:29:00.560]  they call him bandar bush uh and when and when you open when you peel back that onion uh layer
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:05.520]  you're going to find out not only was prince bandar involved but other key members of the
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:10.960]  saudi government and lindsay grand sort of who's opposed to the release of the 28 pages kind of
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:17.200]  slipped up a couple weeks ago when he said uh release of those pages would would uh put our
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:24.960]  relationship with our allies use the plural term allies in the middle east region in jeopardy well
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:30.480]  from what i've gathered and of course nobody can talk about what's in the 28 pages members of congress
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:36.640]  can't even take notes no there you go yet again we see that stay with us uh if can you stay with us

[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:09.200]  to conquer their countries chic muhammad ayid recently gave a speech in which he asserted that muslim
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:13.440]  should use the migrant crisis to breed with european citizens to conquer their countries
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:17.360]  ayid stated that european countries were not rolling out the red carpet for migrants because
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:21.680]  they were compassionate but because europe was in dire need of a new source of labor soon we will
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:27.120]  trample them underfoot a la willing he said the imam statements directly echo a philosophy born in
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:32.240]  the early 20th century called the collergy plan devised by an austrian diplomat named richard
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:37.520]  codenhof collergy he writes the band of the future will be of mixed race today's races and classes

[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:48.560]  city that's what we've been told by the gop endlessly pushing isis this kind of you know
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:55.680]  you know listen to lindsay graham isis justifies everything that they do we can destroy the rule

[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:07.200]  that's the magic word that and national security just wave those words around with a magic wand
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:12.720]  and they have cart block to do anything they want we're going to talk about the phony narrative
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:17.200]  that we're being fed on isis i want to break down this history get some commentary from
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:21.840]  wane madson who analyzes this from an intelligent standpoint this has been a long
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.640]  long trail of information that we've gotten before we do i just want to let you know again
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:33.360]  about the hourly special that we have here is 25 percent off survival shield x2 nascent iodine and
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:37.280]  dna force these are the things that we've been doing as part of our money bomb we've extended
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:42.320]  the free shipping of the money bomb we are now extending the process of doing some hourly specials
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:49.120]  throughout the show this will end in this hour again dna force is an exclusive antioxidant formula
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:57.200]  loaded with a compound bio pqq backed by 175 clinical studies listen we are proud of the
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:02.480]  ingredients of our products unlike the people who are selling you food with gmo and are going to
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:08.000]  congress to try to prevent them from telling people what's in their products we want you to
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.280]  know what's in our products we want you to know about things like bio pqq look it up look at the
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:19.440]  reviews see what this does for people what these clinical studies have shown see what other people
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:24.960]  are saying with reviews that are on our site we don't hide our ingredients we're proud of them i
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:28.640]  would think that people in a market environment whether they're selling food whether selling
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:34.240]  supplements they would want to put stuff in for a competitive advantage that consumers would want
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:39.440]  but that's not the way our food system typically works that's why you need to be careful about what
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:45.280]  you get that's why you need to get supplementation they've taken good stuff like iodine out of the
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:51.280]  food supply they try to sneak in things like gmo they know people don't want and they don't want
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:56.080]  to have that put on the label but we are proud of what are in what's in our ingredients again
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:03.360]  you can get dna force as well as survival shield x2 nascent iodine both 25 off with this hourly
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:08.720]  special that set our store and again there's a lot of discounts still set up on things that we've
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:15.920]  not sold out of yet brain force 20 off silver bullet 20 off oxy powder and secret 12 that's
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:22.720]  our b12 formulation those are both 15 off free shipping we are going to keep that through midnight
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:26.960]  tonight and alex has extended these money bomb specials until we hit the million dollar mark
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:34.720]  but we have a special just for this hour 25 off survival shield x2 and dna force wane just before
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:40.880]  they had the debate there was an article from mclatchy that was put up on the drudge report i
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:45.520]  would think that the gop candidates would look at the drudge report that jake tapper cnn would look
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:52.080]  at it but of course there was no mention whatsoever about the revelations that the us military trained
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:59.040]  the top isis commander and this follows a long train of revelations that have been coming out
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:03.600]  for a couple of years that we've been covering you've been covering a new american has an article
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:08.320]  about this they say first there was admission that obama's anti isis coalition had funded
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:14.080]  an armed various terrorist groups in syria that went on to become isis that was joe biden admitting
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:19.360]  that when he spoke at harvard he admitted that then we had the u.s. joint chiefs of staff chairman
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:25.920]  martin demsey said in senate testimony that suny arab dictators and obama's anti isis coalition
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:30.560]  were not only supporting isis they were funding it then we found out from a freedom of information
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:38.320]  act uh request in 2012 the u.s. defense intelligence agency pointed out that western powers and their
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:44.000]  islamic dictator allies were supporting islamic terrorists and that they wanted to see a fundamentalist
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:51.760]  islamic state created in east syria finally we had the former chief of the da the defense
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:57.600]  intelligence agency go on television spill the beans on obama's willful support to islamic
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:01.920]  terrorists while distancing himself from the policies and so this last revelation that we got
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:07.760]  from mclatchy which came the day of the debate and was completely ignored about how we trained
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:14.880]  the top isis commander all of this is being completely ignored and we have to do everything
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:21.840]  to get rid of isis your comments wane well not only that yesterday we had general austin the
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:28.240]  commander of the u.s. special operations command when asked uh during uh his testimony before the
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:34.480]  congress uh how many of these moderates syrian rebels have you trained and he said four or five
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:41.360]  five it is you know we've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on training these so-called
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:47.120]  moderate rebels in syria and he said we've trained four or five yeah there we have not trained any
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:53.040]  mod there are no moderate syrian rebels there may be a few but they're living courtesy of the u.s.
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:39:00.800]  taxpayer in four star hotels in istanbul an anchor at turkey uh they're not fighting the any wars
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:08.000]  against asides government from the the bar at the intercontinental hotel in istanbul uh so
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:15.600]  we had patreus the other day the convicted criminal david patreus uh suggested the u.s. ally with
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:21.680]  al-qaeda he says it's just what a week before the 9 11 observance and he says we should ally
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:27.920]  with al-qaeda to fight isle i got news for this general patreus who who who was nothing more than
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:34.320]  a pencil sharpening general a paper pusher uh he didn't see much combat and when he did see
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:41.760]  get close to it in iraq he helped actually train what became al-qaeda in iraq and that morphed into
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:48.960]  when they went into syria that morphed into isle or isis uh which means there is no difference
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:55.600]  between al-qaeda and isle uh he he apparently doesn't know that maybe that's why he became the head
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:03.280]  of the cia my dog would do a better job as a cia director than david patreus yet we hear uh john
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:09.520]  mccain and lindsay graham always referring to this convicted criminal patreus as my they always say
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:14.560]  our dear general patreus i'm waiting for the three of them that goes start shopping for furniture
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:21.680]  together at ikea uh you know the the the thing is and we the current director of the cia is even
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:28.720]  worse john brennan who was the cia direct uh station chief in riyadh in the 90s he's rumored to have
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:34.960]  converted you know he went to he went to fordham so he went to a jesuit college but the word is he
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:42.640]  actually converted to uh to now there's a real question that should be asked uh he a former
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:49.120]  fbi agent said that brennan converted to islam and he was actually paid the made the pilgrimage
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:54.960]  to mecca really yeah so his name should be el hajj john brennan he made the pilgrimage
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:41:02.320]  and uh and he's the single handedly has has uh given the saudis everything they want uh
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:10.400]  he's he's been providing uh weapons to uh isil in iraq and syria and al qaeda and at the al
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:17.600]  nusra front and the khorasan group all these radicals and and yet when asked how many moderates
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:23.680]  the us is trained in syria the head of the special operation command said four or five
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:28.560]  that's because all the training and money is going to them to the isil group the beheaders the
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:34.640]  rapists the kidnappers uh the murderers and the people that blow up these these ancient
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:41.680]  relics that have survived thousands of years but just can't survive it another cia funded group
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:46.000]  well of course we have been allied uh since they created the petro dollar we've been allied with
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:53.920]  saudi arabi the most repressive the most fundamentalist of any of the islamic regimes the wahhabi's
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:59.120]  the wahhabiists there in uh saudi arabia they have more beheadings than isis and with everybody
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:03.840]  being concerned about the humanitarian crisis that's going on with this war in syria did you hear
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:10.560]  anything in the gop about saudi arabia's invasion of yemen and targeting civilians in yemen their
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:15.600]  southern neighbor i didn't hear anything at all about that uh wane no and we and we know this
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:21.520]  saudi's have been lobbying against the release of those 28 pages uh and helping them as a pack
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:27.520]  because when lindsay graham said it it'll harm us relations with other allies in the region
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:31.760]  well i've heard through the great mind people have read that report the other allies he's
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:36.800]  referring to as kuwait remember the country we the old man bush went in and saved from saddam
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:42.960]  hussein cut cutter where we have two major u.s military bases and of course israel which is
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:50.720]  a absolute ally uh of saudi arabia because yes they want to jointly attack iran the truth be
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:57.200]  said iran is one of the most moderate uh nations in the middle east it should be our natural ally
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:02.720]  they're fighting they're fighting al qaeda they always have they helped they tried to help us
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:08.080]  fight al qaeda in afghanistan i don't think we took full advantage of that offer because
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:16.080]  uh cheney and his neo cons would never do any kind of business with iran so uh it's a it's
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:21.120]  it's a mess you know when donald trump says our you know our our policy in the middle east is a
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:26.720]  mess he's he's right he just has the wrong he has the wrong solutions i'm afraid for it uh
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:31.200]  because he doesn't understand the mess but he does at least he understands it's a mess he doesn't
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:35.360]  know why there's a mess and what caused the mess well certainly what you're talking about with
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:40.240]  iran should be one of our natural allies of course you know everybody wants to think about
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:45.520]  israel and the arab's is being antithetical to each other two opposites but as we see over and
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:50.880]  over and again what is sold to us as polar opposites are always on the same side that's the way our
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:56.480]  government the way the cia operates things and so as you pointed out israel and uh saudi arabia
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:01.760]  the arab's are are working to try to take out iran and and other groups and they're working against
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:07.360]  the best interests of the united states but of course saudi arabia has the leverage over us of
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:12.400]  the petro dollar that's the way that nixon and kissinger set all this up once they took us off
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:17.040]  the gold standard after britain woods then they said okay our new leverage is going to be the petro
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:23.120]  dollar we're going to work with the saudis and the saudis are joined at the hip with the cia i
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:27.680]  think it's very important for people to understand we've had situations with the iranians they want
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:34.880]  to portray them in the mainstream media as being these radical crazy people and yet we shot down a
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:40.560]  civilian airliner of iran and they didn't do anything about it what would we have done if it had been
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:45.520]  reversed of course we know exactly what would have happened many people don't understand what's going
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:50.640]  on in iran they don't understand the history that we had prior to the ayatollah khamenei
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:56.320]  coming to power as a reaction to the shah of iran that we put in there and of course you know we
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:02.320]  overthrew their government under mosa day or the cia coup they had an incredibly repressive regime
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:07.680]  wane when i was in college there were a lot of iranian students and the engineering curriculum
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:12.640]  that were there they were protesting with masks over their face because they were concerned about
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:16.960]  repercussions at home with the savak and i said well what's that what's that about and they were
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:21.760]  telling me about what the savak who was trained by the cia what they were doing at home and it's like
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:27.440]  i can't believe that are at that point in time that was kind of my awakening as to how repressive
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:33.120]  and brutal our government can be with these coups and the governments that they institute
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:38.640]  there so people americans have no understanding of what happened in iran prior to the takeover
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:44.880]  of the american embassy they don't have a historical context that's correct and i mean you look at the
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:50.800]  history of us middle east policy and they talk about blowback and we certainly saw the blowback
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:57.840]  in so many respects uh the moot that supporting the mujahideen against the soviet union in afghanistan
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:04.800]  when in fact that was the breeding ground where uh where osama bin laden and his cohorts became so
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:12.880]  powerful uh there was never any issue between them in the salles because the salles would pay them
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:19.440]  money so they would never attack inside the kingdom uh and and and we've been just led astray by all
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:26.400]  these uh bought and paid for politicians and the media the media has been absolutely uh
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:31.520]  disgusting on this and and now we see the media instead of asking these candidates during these
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:40.000]  the base legitimate questions we see basically what was predicted by the the 1970s movie network
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.760]  uh the presidential campaign has been turned into a reality tv show where you don't have
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:51.200]  political people behind the scenes you know coming up with questions you got hollywood
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:56.560]  director saying get the camera on this one get the camera on that one and it's just a big hollywood
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:47:03.680]  production uh it's it's a complete waste of time uh i i wouldn't even watch that debate because um
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:08.800]  you know if i want to see that i'll go back and watch rewatch the movie network which uh was
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:12.720]  way ahead of its time you know it was interesting one of the one of the stories that came out that
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:17.280]  that was pretty funny wane was uh bernie sanders they had some of the tweets that he was putting
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:22.960]  out trolling the republicans while this is going on and i i i strongly disagree with bernie sanders
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:28.320]  i'm not supporting bernie sanders as a presidential candidate but what he had to say about the gop
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:34.000]  debate was spot on this is what he had to say when he said war war war when do we get to the other
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.520]  major priority tax breaks for billionaires then he said trump what a pleasant humble person can't
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:44.640]  stop saying kind and generous things about his fellow republicans and he says uh finally says
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:49.120]  okay let's vote for reagan he sounds better than any of these other guys i mean that's basically it
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:53.840]  personal invectives mostly from donald trump and that's what jake tapper was doing he said he
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:57.760]  come to people and say well you know donald trump said this about you what what do you think about
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:03.600]  that i mean it's like some kind of a silly high school instigator you know trying to pit one person
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:08.560]  against the other but then the rest of it was ronald reagan and let's go to war with the rest of the
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:14.400]  world right and it's no different than what fox did in the last debate they're both seeing huge
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:20.160]  ratings as a result of these debates but people are not being educated what should happen is
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:25.760]  the debate should go back to the legal women voters it should go back into a regular political
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:33.440]  debate format uh standard debate rules should apply uh if they have a problem with that go back
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.640]  and look at the nixon kennedy debate what was moderated by howard k smith that can be done
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:43.760]  again and it isn't going to get ratings it's not going to entertain people but it's going to maybe
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:48.800]  start educating people about uh the choices they have in the next election because people right
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:56.880]  now are being entertained and not educated and and and i i believe that in the in the older debates
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:03.600]  from years gone past the networks ate the advertising time they they actually ran a debate
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:09.920]  without uh commercial breaks because they thought it was uh in the public interest to educate the
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:16.480]  voting public that's all been lost with this crazy uh hollywood uh because you gotta realize
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:23.680]  both fox news and cnn are not owned by news companies they're owned by entertainment uh
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:30.320]  conglomerates oh yeah that's right yeah and five of them now yeah yeah exactly well it was it was
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:34.480]  reported and they were even admitting it before that what they wanted where it was conflict so
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:38.960]  they could get some sound bites so they could get an audience it is a reality tv show i call it
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:45.120]  celebrity big brother every four years we get to elect another big brother and uh this is just
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:49.120]  just like that structure where they take one guy goes out every couple of weeks and we've
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:54.960]  already had uh uh rick perry get voted out of celebrity big brother so now we will see this
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:50:00.080]  this gradual attrition and this can go on quite some time with this large a field they can they
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:04.960]  can be taking them out uh one at a time the one thing the only thing that really changed between
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.600]  the two bit the the between the two debates the first one at fox and the second one at cnn was
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:16.240]  that instead of the anchor uh putting themselves up there and and going head to head with uh
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:21.040]  donald trump what they try to do is mix up donald trump with the other other candidates instead of
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:26.080]  like like uh meghan kelly uh aimed her lip gloss at donald trump is that you don't like women do
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:30.080]  you know start a fight personal fight with him but that's essentially what's happening it is a
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:34.160]  reality shows one of the reasons why donald trump is doing so well he's done reality shows for a
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:39.760]  very long time he's been very successful he knows exactly how to do that yes right and the other
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:45.040]  thing you're doing they're taking they're taking uh candidates who do the earlier you know the the
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:54.000]  kitty debate and and and subjectively putting them into the the uh the adult debate and what's
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:58.320]  what's the ground rules for that they put carly fiorina up there we're out of time thank you so

[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:16.720]  and as we're ending up talking about the debate i want to play you this clip from the debate because
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:21.360]  although there's a lot of nonsense from the debate i think there is still important things
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:26.560]  that we can glean from it again the discussion about the vaccines their safety their efficacy
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:32.080]  and most importantly informed consent and your freedom those were all topics that got touched
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:39.760]  on let's hear that clip from the debate hey let's go to what they're saying right now because
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:44.080]  donald trump is making an epic statement about the connection of autism and vaccines and i've
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:49.200]  seen it and i had my children taking care of over a long period of time over two or three
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:54.240]  year period of time same exact amount but you take this little beautiful baby and you pump
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:55:00.080]  i mean it looks just like it's meant for a horse not for a child and we've had so many
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:04.720]  instances people that work for me just the other day two years old two and a half years old the
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:10.960]  child a beautiful child went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:16.960]  fever got very very sick this is great he's doing a great job i only say thank you donald i'm in favor
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:23.920]  of vaccines i kind of say thank you for this same amount thank you just in in little and that's what
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:30.400]  i said earlier i agree on that excellent i think you're going to see a big impact on autism doctor
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:42.960]  carl you're going to hear ben carson jump in nailed it good job he didn't backtrack i like that that's
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:43.680]  right okay doctor oh yeah trust me because i'm a doctor come on i don't want to hear that yeah i don't
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:49.120]  hear that i can read the stuff myself dr ben carson right read the constitution jerk if you're
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:54.640]  going to run for president there's no autism associated with vaccinations but it is true
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:56:00.960]  that we have been approved by our paid off scientists period of time paid off by big pharma
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:07.040]  now recognize that and i think are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:11.840]  done and i think that's all i'm saying jake that's all i'm saying now they're saying autism is caused
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:16.000]  by hey let's understand they went after the other yeah let's understand we have such a thing called
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  informed consent unless we're they're slaves too one of the greatest one of the greatest medical
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.720]  discoveries of all time where the vaccines particularly for smallpox and if you want to
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:29.680]  read a story it's called the speckled monsters an amazing story it was all done voluntarily
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:35.520]  but people came in by the droves george washington wouldn't let his wife visit until she got vaccinated
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:40.640]  so i'm all four vaccines but i'm also for freedom i'm also a little concerned about how they're
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:45.520]  bunched up my kids had all of their vaccines and even if the science doesn't say bunching up
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:50.160]  the problem i ought to have the right to spread my vaccines out a little bit at the very least that's
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:58.960]  right all right that's the point you know what i disagree with rand paul on vaccines but he nailed
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:05.120]  it because as a president what his responsibility is is not to decide even if he is a doctor his
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:09.680]  responsibility is not to decide what's the best for us to make us do it right his responsibility
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:14.720]  to make sure he maintains our freedom to make that decision it's my job as a person to decide if i
[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:19.600]  want to have a beer if i decide if i want to go smoke pot if i want to take a vaccination it's up to
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:26.160]  me to decide what goes in my body that's right not some president not some dictator who thinks they
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:30.400]  can tell me what i can or can't do that's right it should be up to me that's the freedom that's what
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:34.720]  america's supposed to be about and just like karsten he's like yeah maybe we should space him out a
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:38.320]  little bit more but what about all the people who took him before that who are suffering the ill
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:43.920]  effects of having these things bang bang bang come through uh right in such a tight and you're not
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:48.880]  going to hear all these people who are now singing the praises of vaccines even ram paul and huckabee
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:52.720]  you're not going to hear them talking about when they talk about polio polio polio you're not going
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:58:02.240]  to hear him talking about sv 40 simian virus number 40 which was put into the vaccines adulterating
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:09.040]  the vaccines exactly causing and they admitted this causing cancer they still continue to use it
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:14.720]  even after they knew they'd contaminated the vaccines with it again that was live coverage of
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:19.920]  our debate our coverage of the live debate as part of the money bomb that was uh i was there
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:24.480]  with jacari jackson leon macadoo and joe biggs were commenting on the debate as it happened
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:29.920]  again that was sv 40 that they put into the polio vaccine that everybody wants to use as the poster
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:35.920]  child it's our decision the science is not settled because the vaccines are not settled
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:42.320]  they're constantly changing them stay with us we'll be right back thank you for listening to gcm

[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:27.280]  texas alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today we're going
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:33.600]  to be playing some more clips from the live debate coverage that we had as part of the money bomb
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:39.200]  that was the gop debate with cnn before we get to that we're going to play those in the next
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:43.760]  segment before we get to that there's some breaking news that came out today we had
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:49.360]  information about hillary's state department lawyer we find out that there are some emails
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:56.240]  where they are sending an email saying destroy these classified banghazi emails this is reported
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:00.240]  by wnd they say another jolting disclosure in the hillary clinton email scandal the state
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:06.080]  department asked her lawyer to destroy all electronic copies of an email with classified
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:11.920]  information on the banghazi terrorist attack they say clinton attorney david kendall refused the
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:17.840]  request from undersecretary of state for the management for management rather patrick f kennedy
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:22.160]  citing requests by congress and other investigators to preserve her records in other words she said
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:28.160]  they said we've had congress and investigators ask us not to destroy this but you and the state
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:33.920]  department are asking us to destroy these banghazi emails how about that that's one of the reasons why
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:39.760]  her popularity is plummeting of course there's been no debates on the democrat side hillary clinton
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:45.760]  has been working with her allies in the democrat party hierarchy to make sure that doesn't happen
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:52.000]  meanwhile joe biden is biden his time i guess that's what he's biden his time he's going to wait i
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:59.040]  think until for his formal announcement until just before the first caucuses and primaries he'll be the
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:04.640]  fresh new replacement we've seen hillary clinton lose a massive purge of 20 of her popularity
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:10.640]  where did that go did it go to bernie sanders no it went to joe biden who hasn't even announced
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:16.560]  now we have this article that came out yesterday uh off of the drudge report national review reports
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:24.320]  that uh josh alcorn who joined the draff biden super pack uh mse mb ms mbc headline the story
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:31.440]  draff biden just got real well he was talking on a uh train on abtrak train from new york to
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:38.640]  wellmington he was talking very very loudly and everyone could uh no one could avoid hearing him
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:44.400]  in the cafe car and what he said was i am a hundred percent that joe is in but of course
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:49.680]  i think he's going to be crafty i think he's going to uh joe biden his time and he is going
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:55.360]  to wait until just before uh the primaries to announce that and i quite frankly think that
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:03:01.200]  there is a movement within the democrat party to get rid of hillary clinton i think she's
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:07.760]  got some pretty sharp elbows i think they are essentially criminals with a lot uh on on other
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:14.640]  people and many people would like to see them out of the way i think uh joe biden also has a lot
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:19.600]  of connections within the democrat party but i don't think they're the kind of blackmailing
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:24.000]  connections that hillary clinton and bill clinton are likely to have now one of the interesting
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:29.840]  things that came up with this was hillary clinton said she can't name a single top accomplishment
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:35.680]  she was asked directly by wolf blitzer in her first live interview of the campaign so it hasn't
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:40.720]  been any any debates at all on the democrat side there hasn't even been a live interview of hillary
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:46.480]  remember how everybody is amazed at how they are so closed mouth no questions are allowed at her
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:54.000]  book tour everybody has to stay back at a distance very very very controlled and it makes the democrats
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:00.880]  i think wonder is she really up to a campaign is she really up to a debate well when she was asked
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:06.400]  in her very first live interview of the campaign season with wolf blitzer on cnn on thursday
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:11.040]  uh he says uh what name your number one accomplishment and uh she kind of stambered
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:15.120]  and she didn't really have an answer she said instead that anyone who's interested in her
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:23.040]  accomplishments should read my book hard choices my son lance said well maybe that's because her
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:29.840]  sole accomplishment uh is to have hired a ghost writer so i guess even hillary will have to read
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:36.960]  the book to find out what accomplishments that ghost writer fabricated for her because all we
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:43.840]  can see is a criminal in office stay with us we're going to be right back with some more clips of the
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:05:01.200]  g.o.p debate as well as some comments we'll be right back
[02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:19.680]  out what he labels anti-islamic activity what better stunt than the cinder kid to school with
[02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:24.480]  a look-alike bomb to later claim he was racially profiled political commentator pamela geller
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:28.880]  revealed that mohammed has been looking for publicity and chances to fight against islamic
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:33.920]  phobia for a long time and he gained the opportunity this past week going as far as the claim his son
[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:38.720]  was tortured by law enforcement also if you look at photos of the so-called suitcase clock the kid
[02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:43.200]  brought to school it looks just like a suitcase bomb it doesn't seem weird to you that obama was

[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:57.360]  that have merged in the last couple of days about the comments that carly fiorina had and of course
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:03.440]  we look at the economic news today the stock market had an immediate negative reaction to the
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:07.840]  fact that the federal reserve did not raise interest rates it dropped up opened up this morning all
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:13.440]  the exchanges in the united states were down about 1% but let's look at some other economic news
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:19.840]  there's an article from zero hedge this is why hula packard just fired another 30 000 people and he
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:25.120]  writes remember when hula packard announced that it would fire 58 000 people this last February
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:31.520]  just so the company could spend even more billions of dollars in stock buybacks to make its shareholders
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:38.320]  filthy or rich well he points out that now they are going to fire another 30 000 an additional
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:45.360]  30 000 hula packard is going down the drain folks and this is his comment and i think it's a great
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:52.160]  comment i want to read this from zero hedge he says and so dear 30 000 formerly well paid
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:11:00.320]  computer engineers and technicians welcome to the fast food recovery precisely and i have to say
[02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:06.560]  that carly fiorina is the perfect example of the peter principle maybe we should start calling it the
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:11.760]  paula principle in her particular case as donald trump rightly pointed out she had made a disaster
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:16.400]  of the company that she was at before hula packard when she went to hula packard when they finally
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:22.640]  fired her after it was five or six years that she was there they drove her out the stock had tanked
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:28.560]  over 50 percent in other words put this in perspective when we look at the economic crisis
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:35.200]  in greece what happened to the greek banks after they were shut down for a couple weeks what happened
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:40.640]  with the depressed financial expectations for the greek banks was essentially what happened to
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:46.800]  hula packard while calling carly fiorina was their ceo so she wants to run on that as an
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:52.720]  accomplishment she ran on that as an accomplishment and was rejected for senator in california so
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:59.520]  now she's trying to fail up again uh going uh for the presidency now one of the things that she
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:06.320]  was lauded for by the uh neocon press like fox news and just fawning over her and of course
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:12.720]  nika brzezinski uh as a big new brzezinski's daughter just loved carly could not say enough
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:19.760]  kind things about carly fiorina so brzezinski's daughter loves her uh fox news loves her but
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:24.880]  planned parenthood doesn't love her they said she she uh the conservative press is talking
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:29.760]  about what a great job she did calling planned parenthood out well quite frankly i don't think
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:35.760]  she did quite frankly these planned parenthood videos this investigation is done by the uh
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:42.880]  center for medical uh progress that expose there is some horrendous stuff that is done there real
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:50.080]  stuff is done there but it feeds the narrative that it is phony when you elaborate on what was shown
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:56.960]  when you take one questionable uh edit that they did out of all of these videos that they
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:02.000]  did there was one questionable edit where they showed some other footage that was not part of
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:08.800]  their expose and edited that in for effect and they had a narration there i think that was
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:14.320]  a mistake for them to do it but it was a much bigger mistake for carly fiorina to talk about
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:20.560]  that incident and that incident alone and make that into a fictional account you don't need to
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:25.440]  lie about it you don't need to elaborate on it you don't need to fabricate something that wasn't
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:32.160]  there the real truth is bad enough and we undermine the case when we do that i don't think she
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:36.960]  deliberately meant to undermine it but she did not do a great job of defending this because
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:42.640]  plant parenthood came out with this letter to her today this open letter dear miss farina last
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:46.320]  night in the republican primary debate you challenge people to watch videos of plant parenthood which
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:51.360]  you said included graphic and disturbing images that you described i'm writing to tell you directly
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:57.600]  that your claims are completely false that the video footage you described simply does not exist
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:03.600]  literally there is no such scene of any heavily edited widely discredited videos that have been
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:08.080]  released by anti-abortion extremists your statements last night while vivid and attention
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:16.160]  getting were completely untrue exactly she fabricated it just like she fabricated her tenure
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:21.920]  at hewlett packard and there's something else that she fabricated to in order to propagate
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:27.680]  this failed war on drugs let's play this clip about her daughter where she talks about her
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:36.000]  daughter dry dying from a drug overdose it's been done over and over again christie by people like
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:41.360]  you hope that i am the only person on this stage who can say this but i know there are millions
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:46.720]  of americans out there who will say the same thing my husband frank and i buried a child
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:54.400]  to drug addiction oh my god so we want to invest more yeah what kind of drug or what i don't know
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:15:01.200]  i agree with states rights but we are misleading young people when we tell them that marijuana
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:06.720]  is just like having a beer it's not and the marijuana kids okay let me let me chime in here
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:13.360]  how many people have buried a child or a family member or a parent because of the war on drug
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:19.760]  because police swatheed killed them innocent people even people who were smoking something
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:24.640]  recreationally should that be a death sentence in america and we need to understand that this
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:31.760]  war on drugs came from a united nations agenda just like agenda 21 they created an agenda in 1961
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:36.560]  complete with four schedules schedule one drugs were drugs that said they had no medical use
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:42.320]  whatsoever marijuana was put into that and the fact that they have medical marijuana exemptions
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:47.200]  puts a lie to the fact that marijuana is still a schedule one but it goes worse than that worse
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:52.480]  than that we have two constitutional amendments out of 20 something that are about prohibition we
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:56.880]  had one that made alcohol prohibited alcohol that didn't help anybody we have people who are dying
[02:15:56.880 --> 02:16:01.840]  every year from alcohol overdoses college students every fall will go to college get away from their
[02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:07.760]  parents and overdose on alcohol we could tell sob stories about that it's a very sad situation
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:12.640]  but alcohol prohibition did not stop it it made it worse right and it was done though with a
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:18.320]  constitutional amendment because we used to have people that gave a flying whatever about
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:21.600]  the constitution we don't have anybody like that anymore they could care less with some of the
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:26.800]  constitution where's your constitutional amendment the constitutional amendment with with with ten
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:32.080]  and with nine those amendments say that the government doesn't have any powers that weren't
[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:36.400]  directly given to them we just had these guys quote that about certain issues but not about
[02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:41.760]  the war on drugs not about the un's war on drugs this is a un agenda that these conservatives
[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:46.880]  are pushing on you it has killed millions of people in america and across the world far more
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:52.160]  than that look at the war in in mexico that is a war on drugs you want to talk about all the violence
[02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:57.840]  coming across let's talk about the roots and the war on drugs that war on drugs these people have
[02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:02.960]  pushed from the un has created the violence in mexico tens of thousands of people have died
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:06.400]  there more people have died there than if in afghanistan you want to talk about these dangerous
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:11.200]  drug cartels coming across they were created by our war on drugs that's the truth of what's going on
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:17.280]  here far worse than what they're talking about rand paul did a great job with that it's great to see
[02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:23.760]  him lay that that that down on jeb bush and on chris christie the privilege of jeb bush
[02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:30.560]  and the criminality of that prosecutor chris christie that disgusting yeah the war on drugs has
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:36.880]  definitely destroyed a lot of families and and it's almost worse than uh lindsay graham
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:42.880]  and you can hear that was our live coverage of the debate the other night again that was uh joe
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:47.760]  biggs leon macadoo jacari jackson and as she's talking about how she lost her daughter you could
[02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:52.640]  hear joe biggs go oh no are you talking about marijuana we all know that it wasn't a death
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:58.880]  from marijuana what was her what did her daughter die from well it was reported the next day i did
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:03.520]  some research and this is something that uh international business times uh pointed out they
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:09.680]  said who is lori and fiorina carly's stepdaughter who died of a drug overdose well she battled
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:14.800]  addiction what was she fighting it wasn't an overdose from marijuana surprise surprise guess
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:22.000]  what it was she battled addiction to prescription drugs and alcohol and bulimia she battled with
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:28.400]  that for a very long time in her life carly fiorina wrote about that in her book called rising to
[02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:37.040]  the challenge but listen her daughter died in 2009 after 38 years of the failed war on drugs it made
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:42.080]  absolutely no difference to her daughter's life it has not made any difference to anybody else's
[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:47.840]  life but we've had a lot of people as i pointed out who have been shot to death by swat teams who
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:53.600]  have been killed in this prohibition war we used to see during alcohol prohibition uh people writing
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:59.280]  up and down the streets on the running boards of the model t's shooting people with the tommy guns
[02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:04.560]  we have something far worse than that it's been going on for a much longer time than that and i
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:10.720]  have to say if carly fiorina wants to take the tragedy of her daughter and make that a pity
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:16.560]  party for herself use that to inject her into the prohibition debate she needs to take some
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:21.840]  responsibility about what she did in her own family's life where was she in her daughter's life
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:28.240]  was she rising in hula packard or was she rising to the challenge of those around her her loved
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:34.960]  ones that is really where this war on drugs is going to be won or lost by families by those
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:41.280]  people who love you who know you it is not going to be won by the billy club who in the trench
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:46.960]  in and the drug prohibition war we're going to talk about this more when we come back but that's
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:53.520]  the kind of phony debates that we saw from the hero of the mainstream media carly fiorina stay
[02:19:53.520 --> 02:20:03.200]  with us we'll be right back so i found out the other day that at guns80.com a lot of people don't

[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:40.080]  talking about when we talked to uh paul joseph Watson of course there are social and cultural
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:46.320]  reasons that we are seeing the population decline in the west i believe and and of course as
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:51.280]  Watson pointed out we see massive decrease in sperm count and other issues there's bpa that the
[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:57.200]  plastic that so many of our food and drinks are packaged in as well as other things that are being
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:03.040]  put into the food supply and whether you believe it's deliberate or not it is causing a massive
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:10.320]  effect and as part of the money bomb we had uh gucciardi and uh dr group um anthony gucciardi
[02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:17.520]  talking to dr group about why we're seeing such a revolution with people taking control of their
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:21.040]  health taking an interest in their nutrients here's what they had to say as part of the money bomb
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:26.640]  why do you think we have such tangible success in the health realm i feel like every day there's a
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:31.360]  new story every single day there's a new health success there's a new victory against monsanto
[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:35.840]  or against some of the cmf stuff every single time i go on the news we have a major victory in
[02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:42.480]  health field because it's the truth i mean it's it's it's undeniably the truth we know for a fact
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:47.760]  the electromagnetic frequencies are damaging to the body you know we come out with solutions for
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:53.360]  that we know for a fact anybody can go look at vaccines and flu shots if they do it a small
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:57.600]  amount of research and not believe what they're hearing through mainstream media we know it's
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:04.640]  a fact that they damn the amount that is are given to a child is extremely damaging to that child
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:10.320]  we know that artificial colors and sweeteners are damaging there's been enough studies as time
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:15.600]  progresses we know that the damaging effects of pesticides around uh glyphosate you know all of
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:22.560]  these things genetically modified organisms people are becoming educated we know the damaging
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:29.280]  effects and we're making progress because people are actually avoiding those things the big companies
[02:27:29.280 --> 02:27:34.960]  never wanted to change the big you know craft the bisco all those companies pepsi who just
[02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:41.440]  bought suja juice for you put a bought a big steak and suja juice organic all the big companies
[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:48.560]  are realizing now because of consumer demand that they need to start going chemical free too
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:52.160]  because no one's going to buy their products anymore it's exactly what we wanted and what
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:55.600]  we've been asking for for years it's true we're completely dominating the market and voting with
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:28:02.160]  our dollar you know i bet we're gonna look back in 50 even 10 20 30 40 years and say what were we
[02:28:02.160 --> 02:28:06.720]  thinking you know because we feel like we have a responsibility right now to push all this and
[02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:11.840]  change all this and some people agree and some people say you're crazy in like 20 to 30 years
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:17.520]  maybe 50 we're gonna look back and say how could we have ever thought that this was safe what did
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:22.560]  we do just like in the 40s and 50s where they had like radiation rings and stuff like oh get your
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:27.520]  radiation ring it's really good for you it enhances your health and it cures cancer and stuff obviously
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:31.200]  giving you cancer that's what it's going to be like it's going to say it's we're going to say
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:36.400]  things like the FDA said that was heart healthy the FDA said that was good for you the FDA said
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:42.320]  the RDA of vitamin C was what we're going to be taking hundreds of thousands of the RDA of these
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:46.720]  vitamins and nutraceuticals and it's going to be like no big deal no one's even going to ask questions
[02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:50.800]  so at that point we're going to understand it's going to be like knowing that drinking water is
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:56.320]  good we're going to be like we drank water with what in it and you we do right right granddad you'd
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:29:01.840]  really turn on a tap and pharmaceuticals will be in your water what the heck you know i think arsenic
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:06.800]  the number one cancer causing in the most toxic chemical fluoride number two toxic chemical known
[02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:12.560]  to man was in your water supply like Rome what was going on pipes they had no idea and some people
[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:17.040]  would say hey maybe we shouldn't use these lead lead constructs to funnel all the water through it
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:21.040]  maybe that's why we're going insane not to mention we drink two two bottles of wine every night
[02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:24.240]  and we're like oh shut up you're insane you don't know what you're talking about that's how
[02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:28.480]  that's how i feel right now i feel like it's at a certain point we're just going to realize
[02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:36.800]  what's going on and again that was anthony gucciardi and dr group from our money bomb and

[02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:09.760]  suitcase bomb to class is looking more and more like a staged event the father of the kid Muhammad
[02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:15.120]  el-assam muhammad is a known islamic activist who has previously engaged in several stunts to call
[02:30:15.120 --> 02:30:19.760]  out what he labels anti islamic activity what better stunt than the senior kid to school with
[02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:24.560]  a look like bomb to later claim he was racially profiled political commentator pamela geller
[02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:28.960]  revealed that muhammad has been looking for publicity and chances to fight against islamic
[02:30:28.960 --> 02:30:34.000]  phobia for a long time and he gained the opportunity this past week going as far as the claim his son
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:38.560]  was tortured by law enforcement also if you look at photos of the so-called suitcase clock the
[02:30:38.560 --> 02:30:43.280]  kid brought to school it looks just like a suitcase bomb it doesn't seem weird to you that obama was

[02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:34.080]  extended the specials as part of the money bomb until we reach the million dollar level we're very
[02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:38.960]  close to that we're also very close to selling out on a lot of these products like x2 in spite of
[02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:44.240]  that they have continued the free shipping till midnight tonight and they've actually put on as
[02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:52.800]  a special for the show uh survival shield x2 as well as dna force both are 25 off as part of the
[02:34:52.800 --> 02:34:58.240]  hourly show special this is something that we're doing throughout the uh throughout the money bomb
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:02.720]  and we sold out of several of the products that are there those that remain as you can see there on
[02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:08.880]  the screen we have a lot of products that are still 15 to 20 off we have this show special
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:14.160]  of survival shield x2 which will sell out this weekend no question about it as well as dna force
[02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:19.520]  are both 25 off now i want to go back to the debate because of course we were talking to
[02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:25.920]  wane madson and he said it is absolutely a ridiculous scenario there was a lot about it that
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:31.200]  was ridiculous as we talked about celebrity big brother aspects of it trying to create a conflict
[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:35.920]  so they could get sound bites from it a lot of silly questions especially especially at the very
[02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:41.760]  end remember the question where they asked people about uh who should be the new face on the ten
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:46.240]  dollar bill uh the treasury department has said that they're going to put a woman on the ten
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:51.760]  dollar bill currently we have alexander hamilton and it was very interesting to hear of course
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:57.520]  there's a lot of silly answers my wife my mother all this other kind of stuff at trivializing
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:04.080]  this whole process as if it wasn't trivialized enough make it even more trivial but it was
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:07.760]  interesting i thought to hear ted Cruz and what he had to say he says i wouldn't change the ten
[02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:13.920]  dollar bill i changed the 20 i'd take andrew jackson off and i'd leave alexander hamilton
[02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:19.920]  where he was now if you know your history you know that alexander hamilton fought against most of
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:24.240]  the other founding fathers fought against thomas jefferson who said the central bank would be the
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:30.000]  ruin of our country and it has been he fought against thomas jefferson now alexander hamilton
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:36.240]  wanted a central bank they were able to get one and when that charter started came up for renewal
[02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:43.600]  during uh andrew jackson's uh uh presidency he said i will kill the central bank or it will kill
[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:46.960]  me and you know what they nearly did there was an assassination attempt on his life many people
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:51.360]  believe that that was motivated by the bankers who wanted to keep that central bank there but he
[02:36:51.360 --> 02:36:57.440]  nevertheless stopped the renewal of the central bank charter and we did not have a central bank
[02:36:57.440 --> 02:37:05.440]  for a very long time not until it was recreated in 1913 as the private federal reserve and as we
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:11.120]  have seen jefferson's predictions of the ruin of our country came true but i found it very
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:16.560]  interesting and i thought that was one serious aspect there of that ridiculous exchange when
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:22.560]  ted cruise said yeah he liked alexander hamilton but he didn't like andrew jackson exactly what you
[02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:29.040]  would expect from somebody whose wife is a goldman sacks banker that has always been one of my
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:34.320]  major concerns about ted cruise as well as its qualifications to actually even run for presidency
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:42.400]  in terms of uh uh being a uh citizen as defined by the constitution now looking at the transcript
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:46.320]  to the debate and it was a very long debate everybody was talking about how long it was uh
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:50.560]  donald trump was joking he says i think it was longer than gone with when how long was
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:55.680]  gone with the win it was over it was about three hours long incredibly long as many people pointed
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:38:01.600]  out um the uh transcript was longer than the hamlet uh unfortunately it didn't everybody
[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:07.360]  committing suicide just joking uh i did a word search of the transcript because it says
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:12.560]  hundred you know 150 200 pages long depending on your uh your font size i looked up i thought you
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:18.240]  know they talk anything at all about civil asset forfeiture you know just stealing people's private
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:22.640]  property without charging them with a crime finding them guilty any of that kind of stuff
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:26.800]  making you sue them to get your property back no no because that's part of the war on drugs we
[02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:31.680]  don't really want to talk about the government stealing people's private property even if
[02:38:31.680 --> 02:38:37.440]  you're republicans who are all about financial freedom there are some groups like freedom works
[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:43.040]  that are now tackling civil asset forfeiture head on but not any of these people except for
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:47.600]  rand paul he has introduced both legislation to stop that but of course it wasn't talked about in
[02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:51.600]  the debate they didn't give him a chance to talk about that and none of the other candidates are
[02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:58.160]  interested whatsoever in the issue the misjusted the injustice and the uh subversion of our
[02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:02.880]  constitution with civil asset forfeiture did they talk about liberty no not really uh there
[02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:08.160]  were three mentions of the word liberty in there uh we had rubio and carly freerina talking about
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:12.640]  actually carly freerina had a great line one nation under god individual liberty and justice
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:15.920]  for all i i don't know if she said that with her hand over her heart as far as the pledge
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:20.880]  allegiance but that's how she mentioned liberty and talked about lady liberty rubio said yeah
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:25.280]  we all have the right to live here in freedom and liberty but of course he didn't explain
[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:31.040]  exactly how he's going to restore that to us after they've stolen it uh mike huckabee mentioned
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:37.120]  liberty in terms of religious liberty only he's interested in one half of the first amendment
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:41.760]  he did talk somewhat about the tenth amendment uh several of them mentioned the tenth amendment in
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:48.320]  various uh contexts but of course ronald reagan ronald reagan yes it was in the reagan library
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:52.960]  and they did have a final question uh where everybody they went down the line talking to
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:57.200]  everybody well ronald reagan changed the world how would the world change if you were ronald
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:40:01.440]  reagan and so of course there were a lot of mentions about that but in terms of the candidates
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:08.240]  themselves interjecting it into the debate of course jeb led jeb bush used ronald reagan four
[02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:16.880]  times as a bulwark uh to support himself uh besides saying that um uh he was he mentioned it in
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:22.080]  conjunction with putting margaret thatcher on the uh ten dollar bill but he also used it to
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:27.680]  essentially say uh i'm on the side of ronald reagan when he's talking to uh donald trump
[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:35.120]  uh jake tapper uh used it a uh a couple of times to try to convince the candidates to
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:40.480]  buy into climate change he said you know uh how reagan asked uh are you on this because
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:46.800]  reagan wanted to have insurance policies on things uh walker who is a cousin of bush used
[02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:53.680]  it three times so they're not a averse to using ronald reagan but we need to go back and we need
[02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:59.520]  to look at what ronald reagan did in terms of insurance policies did he really support the
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:06.400]  constitution or did he throw the second amendment under the bus when his friend was shot in the
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:13.360]  assassination attempt to pra to pass the brady bill we also see civil asset forfeiture mandatory
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:17.840]  minimums which have created a prison state in the united states did anybody talk about the
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:22.480]  private prisons here in america how we have more people in prison than china does even though we
[02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:28.480]  have many times uh the population of china and of course many of these things were done in the
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:34.080]  name of the war on drugs as we played carly fiorina talking about her daughter who died
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:40.400]  because of the war on drugs and she had it had nothing to do with the war on drugs her daughter
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:46.880]  died from struggles that she had with alcoholism and from prescription drugs and she interjected
[02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:54.480]  that as part of the discussion about the legalization of marijuana very disingenuous exactly
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:42:00.560]  the same way that she interjected the uh statements about uh what was going on with the
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:06.320]  planned parenthood uh statements again completely off the cuff and understand that when you're
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:10.960]  talking about prescription drugs and many people like to talk about marijuana being a gateway
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:15.840]  drug uh joe was just saying that to me i was going to say that marijuana was a gateway drug so we
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:22.400]  could we could talk about this understand that the gateway for her daughter was doctors and the
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:28.640]  medical community and the dangerous far more dangerous than marijuana the dangerous pharmaceutical
[02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:35.120]  prescription drugs but of course alcohol is one of the most dangerous drugs that we have available
[02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:40.640]  to us one of the most addictive drugs that we have available to us and yet prohibition could not stop
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:49.360]  that but it was done legally once upon a time it's not just a tenth amendment issue as ran paul was
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:55.760]  pointing out to chris christy i want to play this uh back and forth between uh ran paul jeb bush and
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:43:00.320]  chris christy on the issue of marijuana because there were a lot of great issues that were brought
[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:06.560]  up by ran paul in the context of this debate hey hang on joe let's let's hear what uh what's going
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:09.680]  on about this question about marijuana this is a different kind of question let's hear this really
[02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:14.560]  damaged our inner cities not only do the drugs damage them we damage them again by incarcerating
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:19.040]  them and then preventing them from getting employment over time so i don't think that the
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:23.920]  federal government should override the states i believe in the tenth amendment and i really will
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:29.520]  say that the states are left to themselves i want to give that now they're gonna go to christy i
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:33.840]  guarantee you call the hypocrite uh an opportunity to respond do you want to identify that person
[02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:38.080]  well i think if we left it open we could see how many people smoked pot in high school
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:43.120]  is there somebody you were specifically thinking of well you know the thing is that you was talking
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:48.400]  about me yeah i was talking about that's what i wanted to say but i wanted to make it easier for
[02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:53.760]  him yeah and i just did governor bush please so 40 years ago i smoked marijuana uh and i admit it
[02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:57.520]  i'm sure that other people might have done it now this is the true confessions part of the reality tv
[02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:05.360]  show my mom's not happy that i just did that's true but here's the deal he should have lost his
[02:44:05.360 --> 02:44:10.080]  right to vote he should have been put in jail for 20 years the epidemic of drugs it goes way beyond
[02:44:10.080 --> 02:44:15.280]  marijuana what goes on in colorado as far as i'm concerned that should be a state decision but if
[02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:20.400]  you look at the problem of drugs in this in this society today it's a serious problem ran you know
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:24.480]  this because you're campaigning in new hampshire like all of us and you see the epidemic of heroine
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:29.440]  the overdoses of heroine that's taking place people's families are yes coming from afghanistan
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:35.440]  yeah which is why we're the government to play protecting and guarding those opium fields right
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:42.880]  no vacuum there except in uh some noses and uh uh uh hypodermic needles right yeah drug courts to
[02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:48.640]  give people a second chance that's the best way to do this but let me respond the thing is is that
[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:54.240]  in florida governor bush campaign against medical marijuana that means that a small child like morgan
[02:44:54.240 --> 02:45:00.160]  hens that has 500 seizures a day is failing on nine traditional medications is not allowed to use
[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:04.960]  cannabis oil and that if they attempt to do that in florida they will take the child away they will
[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:08.880]  put the parents in jail yes and that's what that means if you're against allowing people to use
[02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:14.240]  medical marijuana you'll actually put them in jail reaction to the current circumstances kids who
[02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:20.080]  had privilege that's a lie to go to jail but the poor kids and our cities go to jail i don't think
[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:25.120]  that's fair and i think that we need to acknowledge it and it is hypocritical to still want to put
[02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:29.200]  poor people in jail i don't want to put poor people in jail random might vote you here's the deal you
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:34.240]  oppose the people in jail when the legislature passed the bill to deal with that very issue
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:38.080]  more people in jail than china does and we've they've got four times the population five times
[02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:42.160]  the population of many people under mandatory minimum it was the first step toward not his
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:47.920]  daughter Colorado place yeah not his daughter not him no but that means you'll put people in jail
[02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:52.240]  i want to put sick people in jail but of course when he uses it recreationally it has no consequences
[02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:56.240]  that's true go ahead christine please you know i i enjoyed the interplay thank you gentlemen i just
[02:45:56.240 --> 02:46:01.440]  say this i'm the prosecutor you know first off i want for everybody in jail is the first state in
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:08.320]  the nation that now says if you are a non-violent non-dealing drug user that you don't go to jail
[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:12.960]  for your first offense you had a mandatory treatment for your first you see i think i'm pro
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:17.840]  mandatory treatment for people to be polite for more than just the time in the womb this is it gets a
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:22.400]  lot tougher when it's not his fault it doesn't have any control it's the spoon's fault the spoon
[02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:29.040]  and fork forces way into his mouth and we should tell him he is now he is now a result of the war
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:34.160]  drugs has been having you know these dangerous spoons and forks coming on i think we should ban
[02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:39.360]  spoons and forks so we can stop obesity because it's not about self-control that's right what about
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:44.960]  chopsticks and straws though okay let's hold that right there is as uh joe biggs pointed out and
[02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:49.760]  joe biggs is going to be joining us in the fourth hour christy as well he's going to be talking about
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:53.840]  let's let's pull this down guys uh joe biggs is going to be joining us in the fourth hour he has a
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:59.280]  guest who's going to be talking about practical aspects of self-defense so he's going to be taking
[02:46:59.280 --> 02:47:05.040]  over the show in the fourth hour the point that joe biggs is making and that many of us have made
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:10.080]  over time is of course it's about self-control it is a psychological issue it's a medical issue
[02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:15.760]  it's a spiritual issue it is not a law enforcement issue you cannot stop alcohol by law enforcement
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:22.080]  we realize that once upon a time and you can talk about the practical aspects of it you can talk
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:25.600]  about the medical aspects of it and ram paul did a great job of talking about that you said you
[02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:30.240]  know when you got somebody who's suffering 500 epileptic seizures a day the only thing that
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:35.520]  solves that is cannabis well in recognition of that here in texas we have had the first exception
[02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:40.560]  for medical marijuana and it was for that very condition and you know the interesting thing
[02:47:40.560 --> 02:47:47.440]  dr carson since you're a neurologist neurological specialist and since you are a specialist with
[02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:53.680]  epileptic seizures maybe you might be interested as to what the major cause of these runaway
[02:47:53.680 --> 02:47:58.320]  epileptic seizures are when people have these continuous seizures that they can't stop and
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:03.120]  the only effective medication is marijuana you know where those typically coming from
[02:48:03.120 --> 02:48:09.520]  those are adverse reactions to vaccines maybe you might want to look at some of the epidemiological
[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:14.640]  studies and find out what's going on with that but you might also want to look at the law not
[02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:19.920]  only are we talking about informed consent with vaccines but we're also talking about the constitution
[02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:25.760]  and it goes beyond the 10th amendment when ran paul says chris christie is not going to be allowed
[02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:31.360]  to just go in and say i don't like the law that the people in colorado passed it's more than just
[02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:38.320]  that the ninth and the tenth amendment made it very clear that the only power that the federal
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:44.560]  government had was what had been deliberately and explicitly given to them in the constitution
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:48.800]  the ninth amendment the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:56.320]  construed to deny or disparage others that are retained retained by the people that includes
[02:48:56.320 --> 02:49:03.120]  what i use for medicine that means that the fda cannot withhold cancer drugs for me if i want to
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:07.600]  try to take that from pharmaceutical companies if there's some experimental drug i'm dying of
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:14.240]  cancer i shouldn't have the fda stand there and tell me whether i or my family can take that drug
[02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:18.480]  that should be my decision my informed consent i should be able to look at those studies and
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:23.280]  decide if i want to do that the same thing is true about marijuana whether it's to treat these
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:28.960]  massive continual seizure seizures as a result of a adverse reaction to a vaccine
[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:33.920]  whether it's used to treat something like glaucoma or as some people believe that it's
[02:49:33.920 --> 02:49:39.280]  effective in treating cancer that should be my decision the tenth amendment divides power says
[02:49:39.280 --> 02:49:44.480]  powers not delegated to the us by the constitution nor prohibited to it by the states are reserved to
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:49.440]  the states respectively or to the people so they're talking about that as well but here is the big
[02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:54.880]  elephant in the room of prohibition for the republicans and that is the eighteenth amendment
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:59.040]  you realize that when we decided that alcohol was such a dangerous drug that we needed to try to
[02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:04.800]  prohibit it for the greater good you realized at that point what was required by a government
[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:09.520]  that obeyed the constitution that still had respect for the constitution was the eighteenth
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:14.800]  amendment we had to have an amendment to prohibit alcohol where is your marijuana prohibition
[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:19.840]  amendment where is your heroin prohibition amendment where do you get the authority to
[02:50:19.840 --> 02:50:25.520]  prohibit medical drugs from people fda you do not have it the eighteenth amendment and the
[02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:30.800]  21st amendment which repeal the eighteenth amendment stand in testimony to the illegitimacy
[02:50:30.800 --> 02:50:36.400]  of the war on drugs but of course we know that because they're just directly stealing people's
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:43.040]  property as part of civil asset forfeiture locking people up for vast amounts of time
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:49.120]  for the prison industrial complex that's the sad state of affairs we have in america stay with us

[02:53:18.720 --> 02:53:23.680]  was an invasion of privacy soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit cards

[02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:23.440]  alex david thank you so much i'm incredibly humbled by our listeners and our supporters
[02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:29.760]  and they're just amazing action in the last 48 hours we're so close to a million dollars
[02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:33.440]  sounds like a lot of money but the globalists have trillions they've stolen from us they've
[02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:38.080]  debased our currency they've attacked our cultures they've destroyed our sovereignty but we're fighting
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:44.080]  back and info wars there's just one manifestation of that resistance and that's why i get humbled
[02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:48.800]  when i talk to listeners on the street is why i get humbled when i see david night you know moving
[02:54:48.800 --> 02:54:53.360]  his whole family down here three years ago believing in the fight against jeremy uh and you know
[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:57.280]  selling a successful business to come down here and do this it really humbles me so i want to
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:04.640]  thank everybody i'm joining you via audio skype six months ago i agreed to go to a family wedding
[02:55:05.520 --> 02:55:12.240]  in oma on the brassica of any place it's raining up here so that's why i'm gone the day after
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:16.320]  the money bomb because i agreed to this wedding it seems like the only time that i travel these
[02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:21.280]  days is when i'm going to go into a wedding but i've got family from texas and others get married
[02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:26.560]  all over all over the country just a few months ago it was uh kalamazoo michigan i was there for
[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:32.160]  a wedding with buckley and you know that's the great day life goes on families coming together
[02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:36.960]  that's why we fight against the tyrants who are targeting humanity when i was in the oma airport
[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:42.000]  this morning i was supposed to fly out yesterday but american airlines glitch was a glitch versus
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:47.920]  said the flight was delayed then it was canceled like night at night uh but i i had this epiphany in
[02:55:47.920 --> 02:55:51.920]  the oma hall airport or actually the dimmer airport connecting over to oma hall this morning
[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:56.400]  that i'm going to be talking about more on the sunday show uh with david dine and then of course
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:56:02.880]  i'll be back sunday by showtime but he'll be co-hosting with me and i just had this epiphany
[02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:08.400]  that we'll be discussing in the future because this information is so important it's also hiding in
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:13.360]  plain view i don't want to just halfway put it out here and not do a good job breaking it down but
[02:56:13.360 --> 02:56:18.880]  i'm extremely humbled to be here uh everybody's got my commitment that we will not back down from
[02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:23.920]  the truth we will tell the truth till the very end and we will defeat these globalists we will take
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:30.400]  action against them and it's just so exciting to see what we've done so far and just to imagine
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:35.520]  four hours of the radio slash tv show that you're listening to right now and then an hour at nine
[02:56:35.520 --> 02:56:41.840]  of the nightly news and the sunday show beamed all over the world phase one is north america
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:48.560]  reaching stations uh all over these different regions it's so exciting to know that people
[02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:55.600]  won't just have cnn or rt to tune into internationally uh or maybe japanese you're very dry news
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:57:01.200]  that's international as well they will have info wars and what we're talking about and people respond
[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:07.680]  to it because it's common sense it's not rocket science it's common sense it's pro human it's
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:13.120]  pro freedom and i look at the new world order doing everything they can to bring down the west
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:18.720]  right now uh bring in the most radical muslims you can imagine openly saying we're coming for your
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:24.400]  women we're coming for your freedom you're weak we're going to enslave you ha ha ha but the west
[02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:29.600]  will wake up from its self-induced trance the west will wake up to how it's being destroyed
[02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:35.200]  and the west will lead the world once again out of this new dark age that we see coming down i'm
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:42.000]  not enemies with the poor pathetic fort foundation run radical muslims but i'm glad they feel so
[02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:47.040]  arrogant to see us on our knees right now so pathetic to openly brag your daughters or ours
[02:57:47.040 --> 02:57:51.520]  we're going to conquer you we're going to convert you by the sword ha ha ha because they've been
[02:57:51.520 --> 02:57:56.480]  told by the globalists this is their prize they've been told this is their promise uh they are being
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:58:02.480]  manipulated as well the truth is the globalists want to steal the promise of basic human interaction
[02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:09.920]  the family itself basic procreation basic biology just like monsanto and archer daniels
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:15.680]  want to steal seeds and plants creating new seeds in that eternal cycle that god created
[02:58:15.680 --> 02:58:22.640]  they blasphemously create the terminator genes where the seeds don't grow more plants this is
[02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:28.400]  a globalist monopoly on life the ultimate corporate monopoly takeover we as free humans
[02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:34.400]  have a right to stay no to it and to resist and humanity is only now understanding their peril
[02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:39.840]  and the chain reaction has begun and i can tell you now the new world order in the end will only
[02:58:39.840 --> 02:58:45.120]  make humanity stronger their attempt to take over society and civilisation and dumb us down and

[03:04:16.240 --> 03:04:23.840]  the uk express saying what would happen if isis got weaponized bubonic plague and the question is
[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:28.960]  where would they get that weaponized bubonic plague well that would be from the department of defense
[03:04:28.960 --> 03:04:34.080]  the pentagon as we pointed out earlier this week they've been shipping it out over standard

[03:05:00.160 --> 03:05:05.840]  dot com top imam muslim migrants should breed with europeans to conquer their countries chic
[03:05:05.840 --> 03:05:09.840]  mohammed aide recently gave a speech in which he asserted that muslim should use the migrant
[03:05:09.840 --> 03:05:15.040]  crisis to breed with european citizens to conquer their countries aide stated that european countries
[03:05:15.040 --> 03:05:18.880]  were not rolling out the red carpet for migrants because they were compassionate but because europe
[03:05:18.880 --> 03:05:23.680]  was in dire need of a new source of labor soon we will trample them underfoot a la willing he said
[03:05:23.680 --> 03:05:29.520]  the imam statements directly echo a philosophy born in the early 20th century called the collergy plan
[03:05:29.520 --> 03:05:34.880]  devised by an austrian diplomat named richard codenhoe collergy he writes the band of the future
[03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:39.600]  will be of mixed race today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing
[03:05:39.600 --> 03:05:44.560]  of space time and prejudice the eurasian negroid race of the future similar in appearance to that
[03:05:44.560 --> 03:05:49.120]  of ancient egyptians will replace the diversity of peoples with the diversity of individuals

[03:08:18.880 --> 03:08:25.280]  joe biggs and today we have an awesome segment for you planned today i'll be talking to erin cohen
[03:08:25.280 --> 03:08:32.080]  of sage dynamics purpose driven training now what he does is he goes to different locations and trains
[03:08:32.080 --> 03:08:37.920]  people on different scenarios possibly an active shooter how to react if you're in your car and
[03:08:37.920 --> 03:08:42.880]  someone approaches you welcome to the show erin how are you doing today i'm doing good i wish so
[03:08:42.880 --> 03:08:46.480]  pretty awesome man it's good to have you on here i've been watching a lot of your videos
[03:08:46.480 --> 03:08:51.680]  getting amped up uh taking a lot of the information you put out there and uh taking that at home and
[03:08:51.680 --> 03:08:57.520]  doing some of my training open up my mind to different uh scenarios that you bring up uh one
[03:08:57.520 --> 03:09:02.560]  of the videos i really liked is how you talked about how uh to draw your weapon and fire with your
[03:09:02.560 --> 03:09:08.640]  non-dominant hand can you talk to us a little bit about that for people who uh a scenario such as a
[03:09:08.640 --> 03:09:14.000]  woman who's getting out of her car she's a concealed carrier uh you know weapons holder she's got her
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:18.720]  weapon on the left side she's left hand dominant so she automatically goes to grab the groceries
[03:09:18.720 --> 03:09:23.840]  with her left hand what can a person like that do to protect themselves if an attacker approaches them
[03:09:23.840 --> 03:09:29.840]  well there's there's obviously a hundred thousand possible variables in any kind of self-defense
[03:09:29.840 --> 03:09:35.680]  situation so it's really hard to game it but i try to teach people uh techniques that it basically
[03:09:35.680 --> 03:09:41.280]  provides you the tool and based on the problem you choose the tool you build problem um and you
[03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:45.200]  brought up a really good point people being left handed or right handed they tend to use that dominant
[03:09:45.200 --> 03:09:50.400]  hand to carry whatever it is they're carrying um and especially these days it's very often you see
[03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:56.640]  people completely empty handed they've either got a cell phone or you know a bag or groceries or
[03:09:56.640 --> 03:10:02.000]  take out or what have you um the easiest solution to situation like that is to make sure that if
[03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:05.840]  you're going to carry something you don't carry an object in a way that's going to actually attach
[03:10:05.840 --> 03:10:10.160]  that object to yourself especially men men are really big on trying to take all the groceries in
[03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:16.240]  one trip uh be it into this be it out of the store or into the home we try to carry everything at once
[03:10:16.240 --> 03:10:21.760]  because you know economy and movement but that does complicate accessing your firearm in a
[03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:28.080]  self-defense situation um when i'd use uh i do use that particular scenario a lot in some of my
[03:10:28.080 --> 03:10:32.560]  classes where i'll actually have grocery bags on the range full of whatever i can throw in there
[03:10:32.560 --> 03:10:38.960]  that adds some significant realistic weight to it and then let people kind of feel the delay
[03:10:38.960 --> 03:10:42.080]  they're going to experience in accessing their weapon if they carry things long
[03:10:43.200 --> 03:10:45.600]  yeah so i'm going to stand up real quick i'm going to show everybody one of the
[03:10:45.600 --> 03:10:50.000]  tricks that i saw from one of your videos if you guys want to go in so i'm left-hand dominant and
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:53.920]  this is something i learned from watching one of his videos so as you can see i have my gun
[03:10:53.920 --> 03:10:59.760]  holstered here on the left side and uh what he was talking about is say you're holding a bag right
[03:10:59.760 --> 03:11:06.080]  here you got your right hand free you go in over here pull the gun up rotate it over your stomach
[03:11:06.080 --> 03:11:09.920]  and then push into fire and that's something i learned from watching one of his videos something
[03:11:09.920 --> 03:11:14.560]  i would have never thought about because a lot of times you don't think about those different
[03:11:14.560 --> 03:11:20.160]  scenarios it could possibly pop up so that's a great tool i think just to learn how to use
[03:11:20.160 --> 03:11:25.040]  your weapon with your non-dominant hand and when you go to a firing range don't just shoot with
[03:11:25.040 --> 03:11:29.280]  your dominant hand switch it over go to your non-dominant hand learn how to draw with both
[03:11:29.280 --> 03:11:35.280]  that way you can be prepared as well definitely so i've got an article right here i want to talk
[03:11:35.280 --> 03:11:38.800]  about and it'll segue over into one of the main topics i would like to discuss with you
[03:11:38.800 --> 03:11:44.720]  uh it's a new article out says pentagon says no guns for recruiters hide behind partitions
[03:11:44.720 --> 03:11:49.360]  instead the pentagon has decided against arming recruiters and the wake of the chattanooga
[03:11:49.360 --> 03:11:55.360]  terror attack that killed five soldiers instead of guns officers will get desks desk partitions
[03:11:55.360 --> 03:12:03.360]  so this is a soft target we have uh recruiters who won't be armed they're a soft target and that can be
[03:12:03.360 --> 03:12:09.600]  something that turns into an active shooter scenario and i've watched some of your videos on
[03:12:09.600 --> 03:12:14.560]  active shooter scenarios and uh found it very interesting how you talked about where to be
[03:12:14.560 --> 03:12:19.680]  in a hallway if there's a a gunman coming at you he's shooting and then there's going to be people
[03:12:19.680 --> 03:12:26.320]  running at you can you kind of go over how to what to what to kind of think about what to look for
[03:12:26.320 --> 03:12:30.800]  what are the possibilities of what's going to happen when someone starts shooting uh the point
[03:12:30.800 --> 03:12:36.080]  the the unique nature of an active shooter situation and it's something that other instructors
[03:12:36.080 --> 03:12:42.160]  kind of key into as well is you've got generally of two categories of criminal activity you have
[03:12:42.160 --> 03:12:46.880]  a profit crime which means there's actually they're coming there to gain ownership of something
[03:12:46.880 --> 03:12:51.680]  would be at money or whatever then you have a personal crime where someone actually has a
[03:12:51.680 --> 03:12:55.920]  grudge against someone it's crime of passion so to speak and then you have random acts of violence
[03:12:55.920 --> 03:13:00.160]  which are i would consider what an active shooter would fall under they're literally just going there
[03:13:00.160 --> 03:13:05.280]  to kill people now they may have an ideology that's backing them up they may have a a religious or
[03:13:05.280 --> 03:13:10.080]  a political motivation but those things are actually kind of irrelevant because they don't
[03:13:10.080 --> 03:13:15.760]  actually help you in an academic or an active since prevent the shooting so it's it's nice
[03:13:15.760 --> 03:13:20.560]  information because people love motive but motive in most cases doesn't actually help you prevent
[03:13:20.560 --> 03:13:28.400]  the next situation there is no way to prevent an active shooting without the use of firearms
[03:13:28.400 --> 03:13:33.520]  there just isn't there's no social change you can enact that's going to stop certain people from
[03:13:33.520 --> 03:13:37.680]  just having that mental snap and deciding they want to shoot people in this category or this
[03:13:37.680 --> 03:13:44.400]  category so the best way to be prepared is to be armed and because the second minute recognizes
[03:13:44.400 --> 03:13:50.000]  our natural right of self-defense you have a moral and ethical responsibility to be as well
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:57.360]  trained as you can be to operate that firearm be it protecting yourself and protecting those
[03:13:57.360 --> 03:14:03.520]  that you choose to protect the military dov it's either department of navy or department army driven
[03:14:03.520 --> 03:14:07.840]  because they're both very conservative what they're doing and i kind of read between the lines when
[03:14:07.840 --> 03:14:11.040]  they put out policies like that is what they're basically admitting to is they're not willing
[03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:19.040]  to invest the time to train their people correctly it's a lot different training an 18 year old to
[03:14:19.040 --> 03:14:25.040]  go over and fight in iraq and it is training a seasoned nco recruiter on how to work at handgun
[03:14:25.040 --> 03:14:29.520]  in a close quarter situation so what they're basically saying is we don't have the money or
[03:14:29.520 --> 03:14:33.360]  the time to train these guys to use handguns so we're just going to go ahead and help for the best
[03:14:34.480 --> 03:14:38.320]  so i was watching one of your videos and i thought it was really interesting you were talking about
[03:14:38.320 --> 03:14:43.440]  a scenario where there's an armed shooter you're in a school we'll say and you're standing in the
[03:14:43.440 --> 03:14:49.120]  hall in the hallway and uh you've got your gun on you what's happening someone starts shooting
[03:14:49.120 --> 03:14:53.040]  what's going to happen all those people are going to start running away from the shooter right
[03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:56.800]  and you said ideally yeah they're going to either run away from the shooter or if the
[03:14:56.800 --> 03:15:01.680]  shooter is blocking the only exit to the room it's it's highly possible that they'll try to run kind
[03:15:01.680 --> 03:15:06.800]  of part around him and to get to that exit but generally a hallway situation everyone is going
[03:15:06.800 --> 03:15:12.480]  to go away from the sounds of gunfire or away from the sights of violence so okay so you are
[03:15:12.480 --> 03:15:17.440]  the person in the hallway and you have your concealed carry okay what are you going to do
[03:15:18.160 --> 03:15:21.760]  you've got people running towards you you're not going to stand in the middle of the hallway right
[03:15:21.760 --> 03:15:27.120]  no i'm going to move to i'm going to move to the one of the two walls and the reason for that being
[03:15:27.120 --> 03:15:31.360]  is if you're standing in the middle you can have people passed by your left side and your right
[03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:34.960]  side which is obviously going to affect your ability to travel down that hallway because
[03:15:34.960 --> 03:15:39.440]  you're going against flow traffic and it's going to compromise your control of your weapon system
[03:15:39.440 --> 03:15:44.880]  so for me i would move to one of the other walls to allow people to pass by me just on one side
[03:15:44.880 --> 03:15:51.200]  preferably on my sports side so my weapon is between me and the wall but again the situation
[03:15:51.200 --> 03:15:55.840]  may not allow you to set yourself up in the most ideal situation but one of those two walls is
[03:15:55.840 --> 03:16:00.240]  going to allow you to move against flow traffic a lot more effectively yeah exactly so i'm going
[03:16:00.240 --> 03:16:04.400]  to stand up again real quick and this is one of the things i was seeing so you've got your gun
[03:16:04.960 --> 03:16:08.480]  you're going for it and you're standing in the middle of the hallway like this and you've got
[03:16:08.480 --> 03:16:12.160]  your you know your position you're getting ready to start firing people start running at you so
[03:16:12.160 --> 03:16:16.240]  what he's saying is you've got your dominant hand your firing arm you're going to go over here and
[03:16:16.240 --> 03:16:21.120]  lean to a wall and put your shoulder up against that wall now what that's going to do is prevent
[03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:26.640]  people from running in between you and the wall so you've created this area where people have to
[03:16:26.640 --> 03:16:30.560]  run and come around you and you're not standing in the middle of that hallway where people are
[03:16:30.560 --> 03:16:34.960]  running at you and you're trying to get that shooter and take him out so there's no longer a
[03:16:34.960 --> 03:16:39.520]  threat so you're going to put yourself and move down that hallway with your shoulder against the
[03:16:39.520 --> 03:16:44.720]  wall so people will go around you and it'll prevent civilians from getting hurt also keep them
[03:16:44.720 --> 03:16:48.880]  from knocking you over and giving you a better chance to take out the threat is that correct
[03:16:48.880 --> 03:16:54.880]  yeah and and another huge thing is if you choose to get involved because it is a choice it's
[03:16:54.880 --> 03:16:59.120]  obviously for some of us it's going to be a moral or ethical portion to get involved because
[03:17:00.160 --> 03:17:04.880]  you know especially real pro 2a people the ones that take training and practice really seriously
[03:17:04.880 --> 03:17:08.960]  and they have a really good head on their shoulders they tend to be those kind of people that help
[03:17:09.600 --> 03:17:13.840]  and you're going to have just that natural unconscious subconscious convulsion to want to
[03:17:13.840 --> 03:17:18.240]  help but what's more important than being able to run the gun effectively is let people know
[03:17:18.240 --> 03:17:22.160]  that you're actually there to help one thing that I see that does not get practiced nearly enough
[03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:26.800]  in any class not just active shooter related but any class whatsoever verbal commands being able
[03:17:26.800 --> 03:17:30.800]  to verbalize your intent let people know that you're actually there to help because if you just
[03:17:30.800 --> 03:17:35.200]  draw a gun and all they see is a firearm now they feel like there's a shooter in front of them
[03:17:35.200 --> 03:17:38.960]  and a shooter behind them and that can completely complicate the situation and it might endanger
[03:17:38.960 --> 03:17:42.640]  your safety as well yeah exactly because those people are going to see you they might run into
[03:17:42.640 --> 03:17:47.520]  the actual person that's trying to actually do harm that's definitely a great point I try to keep
[03:17:47.520 --> 03:17:52.480]  it simple I just you know repeat as loud as you can use your outdoor voice where is he I'm here
[03:17:52.480 --> 03:17:58.480]  to help I'm here to help where is he try to get any kind of information you can it's going to happen
[03:17:58.480 --> 03:18:04.080]  pretty quick pretty fast most active shooter situations are over in the single digits when
[03:18:04.080 --> 03:18:10.240]  it comes to minutes but they're predominantly stopped by citizens they're not stopped very often
[03:18:10.240 --> 03:18:14.400]  by law enforcement because usually the shooter has either run at ammunition run out of motivation
[03:18:14.400 --> 03:18:18.800]  or self-terminated by the time law enforcement arrives so what got you interested in doing this
[03:18:18.800 --> 03:18:23.440]  kind of training I you know I read in your profile I actually had a chance to meet you
[03:18:23.440 --> 03:18:30.080]  about a month or so ago at a head down event in Georgia and got to talk a little bit and
[03:18:30.720 --> 03:18:35.120]  told me about your website and all that you used to be in the army you were 31 delta tell everyone
[03:18:35.120 --> 03:18:41.040]  what that was no I was 11 brother you were what I was an 11 brother oh you were I thought it said
[03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:46.560]  31 delta on your profile my bad now that might be one of my other instructors okay okay so you're
[03:18:46.560 --> 03:18:53.360]  11 brother that was infantry so you've taken that you've you've converted from combat overseas to
[03:18:53.360 --> 03:18:59.520]  purpose driven training here in the civilian sector well I I kind of dabbled in every field I
[03:18:59.520 --> 03:19:04.880]  I started I went into the military 17 and I was infantry and then I left the military and went
[03:19:04.880 --> 03:19:08.240]  into private security contracting and I left private security contracting went into law
[03:19:08.240 --> 03:19:15.120]  enforcement so I've I've seen all three sides of your traditional gun driven professions
[03:19:15.920 --> 03:19:22.080]  but what I guess what I experienced was that like the people outside of the military and
[03:19:22.080 --> 03:19:25.840]  outside of law enforcement to a certain degree the people who are facing the situations where
[03:19:25.840 --> 03:19:30.880]  training is the the biggest lacking I would say that of the worst quality is is just the
[03:19:30.880 --> 03:19:37.280]  citizen the actual everyday American they do not get the training and obviously you know it's not
[03:19:37.280 --> 03:19:41.040]  like it's occupation required you know you don't sign up to be an American and have to take a gun
[03:19:41.040 --> 03:19:45.280]  class like so it's it's up all right we're gonna go to break really quick Aaron we'll be back yeah

[03:24:54.720 --> 03:24:59.920]  today so erin let's get back to you there's a different part of the active shooter scenario
[03:24:59.920 --> 03:25:05.040]  that's going to happen that you have to get used to now you talked about when you draw your weapon
[03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:10.400]  is to clearly say in a loud voice that i'm here to help where's the shooter now you have another
[03:25:10.400 --> 03:25:14.640]  part that's going to be injected into the situation you're going to have law enforcement show up
[03:25:14.640 --> 03:25:20.640]  so how do you as a concealed carrier you're in there trying to help now how do you interact with
[03:25:20.640 --> 03:25:26.960]  law enforcement once they've been brought into the situation well it the stars would have to
[03:25:26.960 --> 03:25:33.200]  perfectly align uh for you to engage the shooter at the same time law enforcement is showing up
[03:25:33.200 --> 03:25:37.600]  and engaging the shoot the timelines just aren't going to be the same law enforcement i mean physics
[03:25:37.600 --> 03:25:42.080]  is what it is it's going to take law enforcement time to respond and shooters tend to choose soft
[03:25:42.080 --> 03:25:47.200]  targets that do not have law enforcement response in the immediate area they may not think so much
[03:25:47.200 --> 03:25:50.640]  about where this close police station but they are going to think about okay is there going to be cops
[03:25:50.640 --> 03:25:55.120]  at this place and if the answer is no that's probably going to be a viable target the thing
[03:25:55.120 --> 03:25:59.840]  that people have to remember is when law enforcement does get on scene you need to obey every single
[03:25:59.840 --> 03:26:04.560]  command they give you without hesitation because they do not know who you are they do not know that
[03:26:04.560 --> 03:26:10.240]  you were the guy who helped they won't know that until later often depending on how far away the
[03:26:10.240 --> 03:26:14.000]  officer is or i should say how close the officer is to when he's dispatched he may not even know
[03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:18.640]  the nature of the call by the time he arrives because it takes time for the dispatchers to get
[03:26:18.640 --> 03:26:22.480]  that information that they're responding units it may be a disturbance call it may just be a
[03:26:22.480 --> 03:26:25.920]  shots fired call they may not actually know what they're dealing with when they show up so they're
[03:26:25.920 --> 03:26:31.360]  going to see a plainclothes individual somebody in just everyday clothing with a firearm um so
[03:26:31.360 --> 03:26:36.640]  obviously you have to and i can't stress that enough oh they all command so even they're going to
[03:26:36.640 --> 03:26:39.200]  they're they're going to have you put your gun down if you haven't already done that they're going
[03:26:39.200 --> 03:26:43.920]  to prone you out they're probably going to handcuff uh in fact i would i'd almost guarantee that that
[03:26:43.920 --> 03:26:48.480]  doesn't mean you're going to be arrested you go to prison but it's going to help protect yourself
[03:26:48.480 --> 03:26:52.880]  and the officers themselves as well as anyone else who's in the situation who's involved in the
[03:26:52.880 --> 03:26:58.640]  situation so i can't stress that enough obey all verbal commands it's going to be okay it's just
[03:26:58.640 --> 03:27:03.120]  going to take time for them to actually sort out exactly what happened and what you're involved in
[03:27:03.120 --> 03:27:10.000]  it was so right now personally what is your go to uh say sidearm that you like to carry
[03:27:10.640 --> 03:27:17.920]  i carry an agency arms glock 19 or glock 17 their field edition it is a customized glock handgun
[03:27:18.480 --> 03:27:25.280]  yeah i just picked up uh this is a zev uh zev custom right here it's a glock 19 gen 3 i got the
[03:27:25.280 --> 03:27:30.160]  uh i carried zev some years ago they make a good gun yeah so i got this from georgia optics and also
[03:27:30.160 --> 03:27:36.480]  have the viridian x5l uh light and laser combo on the bottom as well so i like it i've been shooting
[03:27:36.480 --> 03:27:41.440]  it a lot i just put the uh brand new uh fulcrum trigger on it today actually and i'm gonna go out
[03:27:41.440 --> 03:27:46.880]  and shoot that later on this afternoon um so another thing i want to talk about uh as well
[03:27:46.880 --> 03:27:51.600]  before we go to break here in the next couple minutes is tell us about stage dynamics what kind
[03:27:51.600 --> 03:27:57.280]  of training do you do well and i kind of got into that before the last break uh once i decided to
[03:27:57.280 --> 03:28:02.240]  leave full-time law enforcement teach full-time and the decision kind of happened before that uh i
[03:28:02.240 --> 03:28:06.880]  i looked at all the skill sets what's most likely to happen all the way to what's least likely to
[03:28:06.880 --> 03:28:12.640]  happen and what i realized is there's a lot of training out there that that some ex-law enforcement
[03:28:12.640 --> 03:28:16.000]  risk military trainers be like well civilians don't even know that and me as an instructor i don't
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:21.440]  know a business telling a citizen what he can and can't know my job is to make sure he's proficient
[03:28:21.440 --> 03:28:27.280]  in the basics and slowly work him work his way up to the least likely situation most likely
[03:28:27.280 --> 03:28:30.960]  situation is probably going to be a self-finished shooting in very close quarters but does that
[03:28:30.960 --> 03:28:36.320]  mean a citizen doesn't have the right or should never experience or train using a rifle with
[03:28:36.320 --> 03:28:41.680]  a plate carrier and a helmet and all that i mean is it more likely to need that year probably not
[03:28:41.680 --> 03:28:45.920]  but since it's on the table i think everyone should have a right to access that training we
[03:28:45.920 --> 03:28:50.160]  should be as proficient as possible they're firing on so we start with the most likely we work our
[03:28:50.160 --> 03:28:53.680]  way towards least like that i've made a couple enemies doing it that way i've got a couple of
[03:28:53.680 --> 03:28:58.000]  my former law enforcement friends or some of my mentors that are kind of yeah you really don't
[03:28:58.000 --> 03:29:03.040]  need to be teaching stuff like that to citizens but i i there's a very very short list of things
[03:29:03.040 --> 03:29:08.000]  involved in the military law enforcement community that cannot be tailored to the citizen's lifestyle
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:11.680]  and i think if the knowledge is there and it can help save one someone's life there's no reason
[03:29:11.680 --> 03:29:15.760]  they shouldn't know one of the things i always think about is you know i see a lot of people
[03:29:15.760 --> 03:29:20.480]  they go out to get their chl that's a great responsibility to have because number one you're
[03:29:20.480 --> 03:29:24.880]  held to a higher standard you've been through the classes you're you know they're going to look at
[03:29:24.880 --> 03:29:30.400]  you in the court of law as someone who has more training who's read the laws so you've got to
[03:29:30.400 --> 03:29:36.320]  take it from just shooting targets to thinking outside the box using the training that you guys
[03:29:36.320 --> 03:29:41.440]  at sage dynamics provide so we're going to go to break again we'll be back in just a little bit i'm
[03:29:41.440 --> 03:29:51.120]  joe biggs with the info wars overdrive hour thank you we're on the march the empires on the run

[03:30:00.160 --> 03:30:07.040]  there's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now and if you're wondering how
[03:30:07.040 --> 03:30:13.040]  on earth we ever got in this situation well i'll tell you how when the democrats showed their true
[03:30:13.040 --> 03:30:19.280]  colors you got angry and you elected republicans and then when the republicans showed their true
[03:30:19.280 --> 03:30:25.920]  colors you got angry and elected democrats and when anyone suggested to you that both parties
[03:30:25.920 --> 03:30:32.000]  were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best interest you acted like they
[03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:39.200]  were crazy but the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again
[03:30:39.200 --> 03:30:46.160]  and expecting different results that's why it is vitally important that you wake up america

[03:34:08.880 --> 03:34:15.120]  there who have helped make this money bomb the success it is today now erin let's talk about
[03:34:15.120 --> 03:34:20.800]  a different scenario i've watched in your videos where you talk about how to protect yourself how
[03:34:20.800 --> 03:34:26.080]  to react if you're in your car because being in your car is one of the most vulnerable places to be
[03:34:26.080 --> 03:34:30.640]  tell us something that or give us people uh give the people out there something to think about
[03:34:30.640 --> 03:34:35.600]  if they find themselves in a situation where they're being attacked maybe at an ATM or their car stopped
[03:34:35.600 --> 03:34:40.000]  at a red light at two o'clock in the morning the things you have to think about where you
[03:34:40.000 --> 03:34:44.000]  should place your gun should you have it whole search should you have it outside the clip or
[03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:52.080]  outside the belt inside all that um just general preparedness inside the vehicle um obviously
[03:34:52.080 --> 03:34:56.080]  keep attention to those mirrors find a way that'll keep at least some degree of situation
[03:34:56.080 --> 03:35:01.280]  awareness so you can know as much ahead of time that something may be happening uh and and as
[03:35:01.280 --> 03:35:05.360]  gun carriers we we also have a bigger responsibility to be the bigger person in any kind of dispute
[03:35:05.360 --> 03:35:11.280]  if you accidentally cut someone off or someone just thinks you cut them off apologize because
[03:35:11.840 --> 03:35:16.560]  by engaging in an argument you may escalate into a situation where you're forced to use your firearm
[03:35:16.560 --> 03:35:21.360]  when it's simply apologizing could avoid the situation altogether yeah now and when you're the
[03:35:21.360 --> 03:35:24.640]  one that uh injects that and you're the one that creates that then you're the one that's going
[03:35:24.640 --> 03:35:28.880]  to be held responsible because you're the consultant you have no right to self-defense
[03:35:28.880 --> 03:35:35.680]  in a situation that you create so as far as staging goes me personally i'm a hundred meters
[03:35:35.680 --> 03:35:40.160]  both way kind of guy i put my seatbelt on about a hundred meters after i leave river i'm going
[03:35:40.160 --> 03:35:43.760]  and i take my seatbelt off about a hundred meters before i get there so if something happens i've
[03:35:43.760 --> 03:35:48.880]  already cleared that seatbelt i'm dominant left hand so for me seatbelts don't really get in my
[03:35:48.880 --> 03:35:53.120]  way until it's time to get out of the vehicle i can draw my weapon access my firearm no problem
[03:35:53.120 --> 03:35:58.000]  seatbelt on as a right-handed shooter if you're a hip carry guy you may have to clear the seatbelt
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:02.880]  or at least navigate that lap belt before you can get to your firearm when i get in the vehicle i
[03:36:02.880 --> 03:36:07.600]  tuck my shirt behind my gun so it's exposed it's access now some states will not allow you to do
[03:36:07.600 --> 03:36:12.720]  that some states will um that you obviously have to know your local laws and it's just impossible
[03:36:12.720 --> 03:36:19.920]  for me to keep up with all 50 states uh concurrently but when it comes to shooting inside the vehicle
[03:36:19.920 --> 03:36:24.480]  uh the windows are going to cause some deflection they're also going to take a lot of the potency
[03:36:25.040 --> 03:36:29.200]  muzzle velocity off around so if you find yourself in a situation you have to engage from
[03:36:29.200 --> 03:36:33.440]  inside the cabin uh the biggest thing to know is that you're going probably going to have to shoot
[03:36:33.440 --> 03:36:37.520]  a few more rounds and you think you might just be able to clear that glass out of your way or
[03:36:37.520 --> 03:36:42.000]  drive a hole through the glass especially to the windshield uh in order to create an effective
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:47.840]  bullet path where you're getting on and i'd say uninterrupted hits on your bad guy um but again
[03:36:47.840 --> 03:36:52.800]  the car itself is a weapon uh if if i find myself in a situation where the vehicle still has mobility
[03:36:52.800 --> 03:36:57.040]  if i can drive up onto a sidewalk into a parking lot or if i can pull into a suicide lane or if i
[03:36:57.040 --> 03:37:03.280]  can back into something any way i'm able to move the vehicle i'm going to it's when i can't move
[03:37:03.280 --> 03:37:08.640]  from the vehicle that the gun is going to be my primary means self-defense so what's some uh
[03:37:08.640 --> 03:37:12.880]  different scenarios you just recently came down to texas and i was trying to get out that way
[03:37:12.880 --> 03:37:16.960]  some different things popped up i wasn't able to make out uh make it out there but uh what's
[03:37:16.960 --> 03:37:20.800]  some of the different training scenarios that you're teaching right now currently what are people
[03:37:20.800 --> 03:37:27.440]  asking you to uh to help them out with uh the industry tends to trend last year handgun classes
[03:37:27.440 --> 03:37:31.440]  were really popular this year has been mostly rifle people won a lot of rifle classes and i
[03:37:31.440 --> 03:37:37.360]  think it's probably going to trend back in the handgun next year um the biggest thing is to
[03:37:37.360 --> 03:37:45.120]  focus on what's most likely most likely situations how how uh proficient is your drawstring how quickly
[03:37:45.120 --> 03:37:49.440]  can you access your weapon how quickly can you access your weapon and start delivering aim fire
[03:37:49.440 --> 03:37:54.800]  on a close range threat uh you're close your your threats are more likely than not going to be closer
[03:37:54.800 --> 03:38:00.000]  than they are further away now being able to shoot at distance is super important but the difference
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:05.360]  between shooting up close and shooting far away is time the closer my threat is to me the less time
[03:38:05.360 --> 03:38:09.840]  i have to deal with them and probably the less options i have available so being able to shoot
[03:38:09.840 --> 03:38:14.960]  effectively in close quarters is hugely important it's not magic or ninja science it's just being
[03:38:14.960 --> 03:38:20.080]  able to run the fundamentals so to speak of the gun at real life speed and do so effectively in a
[03:38:20.080 --> 03:38:25.040]  very very small margin distance of time now once you get proficient at that you can start building
[03:38:25.040 --> 03:38:30.560]  your way towards greater and greater and greater and greater distances um but i think just being
[03:38:30.560 --> 03:38:35.120]  able to access the gun efficiently from a seated a standing on your back on your side in the field
[03:38:35.120 --> 03:38:39.680]  position just being able to draw the gun from anybody position you may find yourself in um is
[03:38:39.680 --> 03:38:44.560]  a really good place to start once you understand the basic safety operations of the firearm
[03:38:44.560 --> 03:38:48.480]  and you know how to load it how to unload it how to fix malfunctions those that that's obviously
[03:38:48.480 --> 03:38:53.120]  very important too but accessing the weapon to me especially if you care you can seal it's hugely
[03:38:53.120 --> 03:38:57.280]  important that should be the first self-defense step that you take it really start practicing that
[03:38:58.480 --> 03:39:03.120]  now uh i i just talked to ryan smith a minute ago i actually had him on the other night for my
[03:39:03.120 --> 03:39:07.760]  three hour segment and uh he told me that you're going to be jumping on board with arm citizens
[03:39:07.760 --> 03:39:14.000]  united to help so tell me a little bit about that well arm system united is is is uh what i think is
[03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:20.800]  a a less uh politically driven i feel like it's a more socially driven activist group for two a
[03:39:20.800 --> 03:39:26.880]  rights um they're not going to have the same degree or risk of capitulation that you get from
[03:39:26.880 --> 03:39:32.400]  organizations like the nra i'm a lifetime nra member i'm an nre le instructor but i don't feel
[03:39:32.400 --> 03:39:37.520]  that they are best representing my rights as a second amendment citizen uh we still have the
[03:39:37.520 --> 03:39:42.000]  1986 gca like we got rid of the assault weapons ban but that's because the sunset was written into it
[03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:48.800]  the nra had nothing to do with that the nra hasn't fixed anything or really repealed anything uh as
[03:39:48.800 --> 03:39:55.520]  far as is really in recent history so for me i look at the younger organizations such as arm
[03:39:55.520 --> 03:40:00.400]  citizens united is a group that once they get their feet underneath them and really become a powerhouse
[03:40:00.400 --> 03:40:04.800]  in the two a community they're going to be the kind of group that's able to push back against
[03:40:04.800 --> 03:40:09.760]  this stuff that the nra is just kind of accepted as well this is just how things are and i don't
[03:40:09.760 --> 03:40:14.080]  think you know that the second amendment wasn't written with restrictions it was written as this
[03:40:14.080 --> 03:40:19.600]  is your rights so we need to get back to that you know the bolset act has been repealed for quite
[03:40:19.600 --> 03:40:26.880]  some time now yet we still have the nfa and i think that's unacceptable all right so uh guess
[03:40:26.880 --> 03:40:31.840]  what uh donald trump has now come out with his position and stands on the second amendment
[03:40:31.840 --> 03:40:36.480]  it says donald tray uh donald j uh trump believes in the right to keep him bare arms the second
[03:40:36.480 --> 03:40:40.320]  amendment to our constitution is clear the right of the people to keep him bare arms
[03:40:40.320 --> 03:40:46.240]  shall not be infringed upon period so if you guys want to go to his website you can go read more
[03:40:46.240 --> 03:40:51.760]  about that also like i said earlier the money bomb has been extended on till sunday there's a lot of
[03:40:51.760 --> 03:40:56.640]  great specials still going on we want to thank all of you out there now erin what's a good way for
[03:40:57.360 --> 03:41:03.600]  people to contact you tell me about your website what it is and what it is that you're you're
[03:41:03.600 --> 03:41:07.360]  going to be able to do if someone calls you and maybe get them out there to help them out oh i'm
[03:41:07.360 --> 03:41:13.840]  uh website is sage dynamics dot org you can find my youtube channel youtube board slash
[03:41:13.840 --> 03:41:19.680]  sage dynamics i'm on instagram at sage dynamics twitter at sage dynamics i think that's all my
[03:41:19.680 --> 03:41:24.800]  social media i run classes all over the nation i got to actually have a vehicle to plant defense
[03:41:24.800 --> 03:41:29.440]  class coming up next weekend here in the atlanta area so lots left in that that's going to be a
[03:41:29.440 --> 03:41:33.840]  live fire from the vehicle we're going to shoot through real cars and go over all the techniques
[03:41:33.840 --> 03:41:37.440]  and skills you need for defending yourself in that in a vehicle or firearm with a handgun
[03:41:38.320 --> 03:41:43.920]  but i also have classes you know nationwide i'm building my 2016 calendar i'll actually make it
[03:41:43.920 --> 03:41:49.200]  back out to texas at least twice so hopefully you can make it to one of those and i also do
[03:41:49.200 --> 03:41:53.360]  munitions training which is force on force it allows you to physically experience as close as
[03:41:53.360 --> 03:41:58.560]  we can get it training the physiological and psychological stuff you go through in a gunfight
[03:41:58.560 --> 03:42:03.200]  or you make it tell us more about that then give us a little bit more in depth on what that training
[03:42:03.200 --> 03:42:09.120]  is like well i i really think it's the bridge between what's artificial and what's real because
[03:42:09.120 --> 03:42:12.720]  on a live fire range we're shooting paper we should we should train to shoot people but we
[03:42:12.720 --> 03:42:17.280]  have to deal with paper so we can only make live fire so realistic because they're safety concerns
[03:42:17.280 --> 03:42:22.000]  ammunition allows people to take live guns convert them to fire as ammunition around and shoot
[03:42:22.000 --> 03:42:27.680]  actual people so depending on the the value of the role player whoever's playing the bad guy
[03:42:27.680 --> 03:42:32.960]  the more he puts into making the scenario believable the better training you're going to get out of
[03:42:32.960 --> 03:42:37.120]  it and it's a really good way to dispel a lot of myths when it comes to how you're able to shoot
[03:42:37.120 --> 03:42:41.440]  accurately under stress and how people may behave under stress when you start shooting at them and
[03:42:41.440 --> 03:42:46.720]  they're shooting back i think that people should train on both sides of the house as much as possible
[03:42:46.720 --> 03:42:51.120]  live fire is priceless you have to know how to fire a live firearm but the force on force training
[03:42:51.120 --> 03:42:56.960]  allows you to do things that you just cannot do with live fire they do you do you do ever a
[03:42:56.960 --> 03:43:00.880]  stress training anything like that stress shooting where you go out you do like a hundred push-ups
[03:43:00.880 --> 03:43:07.440]  you get people to do that i include some physical exertion in my classes but the physiological
[03:43:07.440 --> 03:43:12.240]  things that you encounter under just doing push-ups is not close to what you're going to encounter in
[03:43:12.240 --> 03:43:16.880]  an actual real-life stressful situation it does teach you how to shoot under stress unfortunately
[03:43:16.880 --> 03:43:22.720]  it's a different kind of stress your body becomes psychologically fatigued and then you support it
[03:43:22.720 --> 03:43:27.520]  doesn't often become physically fatigued unless you're actually in a hands-on physical fight so
[03:43:27.520 --> 03:43:30.800]  how do you how do you prepare people then how do you prepare people for the mental stress that
[03:43:30.800 --> 03:43:35.600]  will be involved in i've i've seen heart rates up until up into the 200 beats per minute in
[03:43:35.600 --> 03:43:40.640]  simulation classes now again heart rate is only a speedometer it's not the engine but it does get
[03:43:40.640 --> 03:43:46.560]  it gives people the psychological aspect of a real use of force and count having been in the real
[03:43:46.560 --> 03:43:51.280]  thing and use munitions for a long time i can tell you it's the closest you can get it's not quite
[03:43:51.280 --> 03:43:55.920]  the same but it's closer than anything i've ever done on a life heart rate so what are some of the
[03:43:55.920 --> 03:44:01.040]  different scenarios that you do in your simulation training do you do indoors live yeah i do i do
[03:44:01.040 --> 03:44:06.160]  indoors i do low light i do home defense i do vehicle defense i do response to active shooter
[03:44:06.880 --> 03:44:11.360]  a bunch of different classes cover those avenues and i try to tailor the scenarios because every
[03:44:11.360 --> 03:44:14.160]  student's going to go through a number of scenarios i try to tailor them to their individual life
[03:44:14.160 --> 03:44:17.680]  always ask students what is it you do for a living what are your what are kind of your habits
[03:44:17.680 --> 03:44:22.720]  where are you most likely to encounter a situation just to best prepare them because of their daily
[03:44:22.720 --> 03:44:27.680]  habits because i mean i get students in classes ever from trauma surgeons to guys that deliver
[03:44:27.680 --> 03:44:31.520]  carpet for a living now and there's there's honorable positions but they're going to experience
[03:44:31.520 --> 03:44:35.760]  different things in their lives so i have to kind of tailor things as much as i can to their
[03:44:35.760 --> 03:44:40.960]  individual life stuff now i have a lot of people that'll tweet me and ask me uh how they can protect
[03:44:40.960 --> 03:44:45.920]  themselves at their home you brought up home invasion what are some steps that people can take
[03:44:45.920 --> 03:44:50.640]  at home they're laying in bed it's two o'clock in the morning they hear a bump what are some actions
[03:44:50.640 --> 03:44:54.480]  that these people can kind of take a scenario they can play over in their mind so maybe they
[03:44:54.480 --> 03:44:59.840]  have a better chance of surviving if something does happen uh biggest thing if you do not have to
[03:44:59.840 --> 03:45:05.200]  leave the room don't uh if you live and it's just you or it's just you and a loved one and you have
[03:45:05.200 --> 03:45:09.360]  no kids then you don't really have a reason to leave that bedroom you can wait till the bad guy
[03:45:09.360 --> 03:45:13.040]  comes to you because you know where he's not but you don't know where he is he's not in the
[03:45:13.040 --> 03:45:16.720]  bedroom with you so you actually don't know where he is in the house you always want to fight from
[03:45:16.720 --> 03:45:22.800]  real estate that you own now if you do have kids then your primary focus is going to be go to get
[03:45:22.800 --> 03:45:29.120]  the kids and then bring them back to your room and i and really it's hard for me to answer that as a
[03:45:29.120 --> 03:45:33.680]  cafeteria style answer where one size fits all without knowing the individual knowing the size
[03:45:33.680 --> 03:45:39.520]  of the home and i gotta be honest people need to start thinking about not the two a.m bump of the
[03:45:39.520 --> 03:45:44.880]  night but the two at the 2 p.m knock on the door home defense doesn't mean you have the luxury of
[03:45:44.880 --> 03:45:48.160]  knowing when it's going to happen it could happen at two in the afternoon when the bad guy kicks in
[03:45:48.160 --> 03:45:52.320]  that back door it could be you and then your wife's in the kitchen the bad guy's on the other side
[03:45:52.320 --> 03:45:56.720]  of her so now you have a loved one in between you and the bad guy you need to start thinking about
[03:45:56.720 --> 03:46:00.480]  things like that as well home invasions and burglaries are two totally different things all
[03:46:00.480 --> 03:46:05.200]  right so so let's talk about that scenario then there's a knock on the door during uh in the
[03:46:05.200 --> 03:46:08.880]  middle of the afternoon you're home alone how do you open the door do you open the door do you
[03:46:08.880 --> 03:46:12.800]  peek around do you put your foot down in front of the door so it can only open a certain amount of
[03:46:12.800 --> 03:46:19.440]  inches um again it's it's going to depend on the nature of things where you live obviously an
[03:46:19.440 --> 03:46:23.360]  apartment building you're afforded a great degree of anonymity and if you're not expecting anyone
[03:46:23.360 --> 03:46:26.800]  to come by it's going to be really weird for that knock so i'm already going to be a little
[03:46:26.800 --> 03:46:30.800]  suspicious people's are great but if i'm on the other side of the people i can tell if you're
[03:46:30.800 --> 03:46:36.080]  looking through it or not despite the light yeah find somewhere in your house if possible where you
[03:46:36.080 --> 03:46:40.720]  can get an angle on that door to physically see the person and if you're going to answer the door
[03:46:40.720 --> 03:46:44.880]  don't walk up the door to do it they can hear you talking to them probably from further deeper
[03:46:44.880 --> 03:46:49.040]  in the room so if you say who is it from the kitchen and they keep the door in you've at least
[03:46:49.040 --> 03:46:55.280]  got some distance to work with so you're saying people well what if you are going to open the
[03:46:55.280 --> 03:46:59.600]  door have you ever tried or have you ever done this before usually when i open the door i try to
[03:46:59.600 --> 03:47:05.040]  put my foot right there at the base of that floor board so if someone tries to hit it and nudge it
[03:47:05.040 --> 03:47:09.680]  at least i can do something i mean you're you're a pretty decent size guy so that would probably
[03:47:09.680 --> 03:47:13.920]  work out for you depending on the size of the person on the other side of the door but it's
[03:47:13.920 --> 03:47:18.320]  not something i would recommend for a lot of people because if someone puts a lot of weight into that
[03:47:18.320 --> 03:47:22.640]  door it's you're going to be it's going to be easier for them to push than it is for you to push back
[03:47:22.640 --> 03:47:26.000]  they're going to have the leverage because they're going to put their whole body weight into it and
[03:47:26.000 --> 03:47:30.640]  you could actually end up significantly injured using that technique door stops are a great idea
[03:47:30.640 --> 03:47:34.480]  you can buy on the home depot they're really cheap made out of rubber little isosleak triangle
[03:47:34.480 --> 03:47:38.320]  looking thing yeah have one of those close by that if you have an unexpected knock on the door you
[03:47:38.320 --> 03:47:41.760]  can kick that out kick it right underneath the door as soon as you open it that small crack
[03:47:43.120 --> 03:47:46.400]  so then you can interact with that person through the small crack in the door if you have to open
[03:47:46.400 --> 03:47:50.320]  the door and if they do decide to try to bum rush into the house it's going to be significantly
[03:47:50.320 --> 03:47:54.960]  harder for them to do now the training you said you do you in inseminations do you do
[03:47:54.960 --> 03:48:00.800]  stuff like that and home evasion scenario yeah i have a two-day home defense course that goes over
[03:48:00.800 --> 03:48:05.840]  everything i try to cover as many variables as possible in those two days so you do training
[03:48:05.840 --> 03:48:11.200]  as far as drawing your weapon going forward what are some of the things you suggest for
[03:48:11.200 --> 03:48:16.160]  people who are at home where they should store a weapon should they have one upstairs downstairs
[03:48:16.160 --> 03:48:21.040]  where's the ideal place they kind of have just so people can think about it well if you have
[03:48:21.040 --> 03:48:26.800]  children then you need a quick access safe next to the bed but i'm a huge proponent of home carry
[03:48:26.800 --> 03:48:31.760]  anytime you're awake and at the house uh as often as possible carry the gun on you just like
[03:48:31.760 --> 03:48:36.160]  you would out in the general public with your ccw or your cpl or whatever your state calls your
[03:48:36.160 --> 03:48:40.000]  concealed license there's no reason not to have the gun on you and the advantage of having the gun
[03:48:40.000 --> 03:48:43.920]  on you if you have children is you don't have to worry about setting it down somewhere and then
[03:48:43.920 --> 03:48:47.520]  having access to it especially if they're really young and they still don't understand firearm
[03:48:47.520 --> 03:48:53.120]  safety so if you home carry anytime someone knocks on the door anytime you hear a bump or anything
[03:48:53.120 --> 03:48:56.160]  you need to investigate you're already armed you don't have to rush to the bedroom to get
[03:48:56.160 --> 03:49:01.360]  your gun or rush to the the den or the office or wherever you store your firearms uh me personally
[03:49:01.360 --> 03:49:06.720]  i home carry and then when it's time to go to bed the gun goes next to the bed because i have kids
[03:49:06.720 --> 03:49:11.600]  but if i did i have one of those quick access pistol boxes now do you ever do any training
[03:49:11.600 --> 03:49:17.200]  with family members as far as a mother and a father who have a child tell me a little bit
[03:49:17.200 --> 03:49:22.400]  about that because there's a lot of people who always uh ask me questions i'm a father i'm carrying
[03:49:22.400 --> 03:49:27.600]  for the first time what can i do to be safe around my child and how can i introduce how can
[03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:32.320]  i introduce weapons to my child once they get older you know to where i feel they're comfortable
[03:49:33.040 --> 03:49:38.240]  yeah i'm actually working on a class specifically for parents of small children or couples or
[03:49:38.240 --> 03:49:41.920]  friends basically a couple in kids class that's probably what i'm gonna end up calling it just
[03:49:41.920 --> 03:49:46.480]  because that's a good name but when you have to protect a child especially a child you have to
[03:49:46.480 --> 03:49:50.720]  carry a very small child that your your self-defense dynamic totally changes you have
[03:49:50.720 --> 03:49:55.840]  different concerns you have different focuses and you have different problems you're gonna have with
[03:49:55.840 --> 03:50:01.120]  with self-defense and it's really kind of hard to get into that in a short period of time but if
[03:50:01.120 --> 03:50:04.480]  you're working with a stroller or a baby carrier or something like that a lot of my students a lot
[03:50:04.480 --> 03:50:09.920]  of my regular alumni have small children and i don't but i think about the problem because
[03:50:09.920 --> 03:50:14.480]  because of my customer base because of my student base and i've gotten a lot of priceless feedback
[03:50:14.480 --> 03:50:20.160]  from some of my my oldest alumni who have smaller children on on how to develop techniques it'll allow
[03:50:20.160 --> 03:50:25.200]  someone carrying a child to be able to defensively protect their child and their loved ones as as
[03:50:25.200 --> 03:50:32.800]  they move away from threat but it's it's really hard to get into two-dimensional descriptions of
[03:50:32.800 --> 03:50:37.760]  that all right we're gonna go to break really quick uh thank you for listening to the info wars

[03:54:45.680 --> 03:54:51.200]  bomb has become you guys are amazing i love talking to you guys on twitter facebook everything
[03:54:51.200 --> 03:54:56.480]  like that being able to interact and hear what you guys have to say now let's get back to erin
[03:54:56.480 --> 03:55:02.960]  and talk about what people should do as far as training day-to-day training as someone who's
[03:55:02.960 --> 03:55:09.840]  going to be concealed carry or just to have the knowledge uh there's a big difference between
[03:55:09.840 --> 03:55:14.560]  training and practice training is where you receive proper techniques from a verified
[03:55:14.560 --> 03:55:18.880]  instructor and practices where you practice those techniques to proficiency you can't
[03:55:18.880 --> 03:55:23.760]  technically get training from a one-way communication source like youtube i consider everything i do
[03:55:23.760 --> 03:55:28.160]  on youtube as a training supplement or a practice supplement it's something to look at to give you
[03:55:28.160 --> 03:55:32.080]  a new way of thinking of things but it's not necessarily a replacement for actually going
[03:55:32.080 --> 03:55:38.320]  to someone who teaches people self-defense uh for a living uh and people say well i own a gun
[03:55:38.320 --> 03:55:43.920]  that i'm fine well if you own a set of medical tools you are not a surgeon you just have a set
[03:55:43.920 --> 03:55:48.480]  of medical tools and i kind of look at firearms in the same way it's a very professional driven
[03:55:48.480 --> 03:55:53.280]  skill set so you should seek out a professional to at least get you a basic skill set that you
[03:55:53.280 --> 03:55:57.600]  can then build on you don't have to train constantly you should train as often as you could as many
[03:55:57.600 --> 03:56:03.360]  different subjects as you can but i don't feel like you're doing yourself a really big favor
[03:56:03.360 --> 03:56:07.840]  by just owning a firearm and going to the range and shooting paper every now and then you really have
[03:56:07.840 --> 03:56:13.200]  to seek out a verifiable reputable instructor uh someone who can provide you with a different way
[03:56:13.200 --> 03:56:16.320]  of seeing things a different way of thinking of things or for those that live in an urban area
[03:56:16.320 --> 03:56:20.960]  who only have access to indoor ranges at least taking a class will allow you to practice techniques
[03:56:20.960 --> 03:56:27.040]  and train under techniques that you don't normally get to do so do you ever do you ever have people
[03:56:27.040 --> 03:56:31.520]  contact you and say hey can you come in and check my home can you come in and check my place of
[03:56:31.520 --> 03:56:36.880]  business to see if we're up to par tell me a little bit about that process how that works well it's
[03:56:36.880 --> 03:56:42.160]  not uh an advertised service i offer but if someone contacts me and has genuine concerns about it
[03:56:42.160 --> 03:56:46.880]  especially for my alumni i'm more than happy about i'm not a home security expert as far as
[03:56:46.880 --> 03:56:50.160]  like electronics and glass break and motion sensors and things like that go but i don't
[03:56:50.160 --> 03:56:54.880]  understand physical security so i can go in and identify weak points in the home identify things
[03:56:54.880 --> 03:56:59.520]  that might need to be adjusted to prevent uh forceful entries into especially in the business
[03:56:59.520 --> 03:57:05.760]  world to change employee behaviors to minimize the chances of a break in or a hostile situation
[03:57:05.760 --> 03:57:11.200]  or any kind of forceful felony that's going to take place when the business is open um it's really
[03:57:11.200 --> 03:57:15.200]  as simple as coming in and thinking like criminal how would i as the criminal where are the weak
[03:57:15.200 --> 03:57:21.360]  points that i would exploit and then i have to strengthen people in that area all right well
[03:57:21.360 --> 03:57:26.560]  today i've got to say man you've been a fantastic guest and hopefully we can get you back on here
