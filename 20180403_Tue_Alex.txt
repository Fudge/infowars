[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and we are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:29.000 --> 00:36.000]  Russia is demanding a meeting between President Putin and President Trump.
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  President Trump has already met with Theresa May four or five times.
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  He's already met with the French president a couple of times.
[00:41.000 --> 00:47.000]  He's already met with the Chinese president multiple times in China and in the US.
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.000]  He's already met with hundreds of world leaders, but not with Russia.
[00:52.000 --> 00:58.000]  Even at the height of the Cold War, there were meetings with the Russian dictators.
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  Putin is not a dictator in my view, but even if he was, they should be meeting with him.
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  That's a big story we're going to be looking at.
[01:05.000 --> 01:11.000]  A meeting with Putin, if it happens soon, would involve a different Trump.
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  Another headline, Russia presses Trump for White House meeting with Putin.
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000]  It's already been what?
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  15 months, 16 months since Trump has been in office.
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  This is unprecedented.
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  We're going to be looking at Trump outraged over Mexico migrant caravan
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  and mainstream media is trying to act like corporate media is trying to act like it's weird
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  that if you have the UN and Soros and the regular groups that organize the caravans across the ocean
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  and through the Middle East, through Turkey and Eastern Europe,
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  it turned out to be a trickle, then a flood, then a torrent, 10 million plus military aged men
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.000]  just the last four or five years.
[01:50.000 --> 01:59.000]  This is a corridor being broken through Central and South America into the United States.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  And they're saying our demands are no borders.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  Our demands are we're allowed to take over your entire society.
[02:07.000 --> 02:15.000]  DrudgeReport.com is linked to our breakdown of this with the group's demands.
[02:15.000 --> 02:22.000]  It is very, very, very important. We'll go over the outrageous demands of the group when we come back.
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  And then I was going to air this last Thursday, but I said, you know what, I'm going to wait.
[02:26.000 --> 02:33.000]  That way we can really promote it.
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  We're going to air some of the Ted Nugent interview that's now on infowars.com.
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  Even if you're awake and know about the Second Amendment, you name it.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  This is information warfare using the truth.
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  Promote that Ted Nugent interview. It is powerful. It's pure Americana.
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  It's called Firestorm, the Ted Nugent interview. It's on infowars.com right now.
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  We tweeted it out at Real Alex Jones. I've asked Paul to tweet it.
[02:52.000 --> 02:58.000]  I'm asking all of you to tweet it out as well. So that's coming up.
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.000]  And then we're going to continue on looking at the other news.
[03:03.000 --> 03:12.000]  Reported Florida Shooter discussed Ala Akbar on Instagram and how that was all the early news coming out.
[03:12.000 --> 03:22.000]  That even mainstream media linked to and looked at a routine practice and how we published a retraction.
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.000]  And we also didn't just publish a retraction.
[03:25.000 --> 03:32.000]  We had an editor's note and followed all the Texas statutory rules and removed the photo of the individual that was not Cruz.
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  We never even said the person's name. Well, Infowars has been sued for that.
[03:37.000 --> 03:48.000]  And they claim that statutorily that we never did the retraction, but the retraction and the correction is there as well.
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  So we're going to be looking at that whole situation and how shoddy this is.
[03:53.000 --> 04:01.000]  Even lawyers in BuzzFeed and the Daily Beast said, this is a really flimsy lawsuit and they could get sued for this.
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  Why'd they do that?
[04:03.000 --> 04:12.000]  Well, it's because it's about creating the branding that Infowars equals lawsuit or Infowars is fake news.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  That's what it is.
[04:14.000 --> 04:20.000]  And then they have as exhibits in here other people's websites and not even stuff we linked to.
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  They've got one thing in there that we did post, but then they show an exhibit from someone else's website.
[04:25.000 --> 04:32.000]  So it's just full of holes like all of these because there's really not anything real to attack us on.
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.000]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down as well today.
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.000]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  We'll be right back on the other side of this global transmission.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  And believe me, we are the tip of the spear. That's why we're under attack.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  That's why we need your support, your prayers.
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.000]  We know you're doing it more than ever, so I salute you and thank you. Stay with us.
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.000]  Infowars Life's cutting edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon,
[05:33.000 --> 05:41.000]  but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon
[05:41.000 --> 05:53.000]  for maximum prebiotic effect.
[05:53.000 --> 06:01.000]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[06:01.000 --> 06:08.000]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones,
[06:08.000 --> 06:14.000]  who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[06:14.000 --> 06:23.000]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[06:23.000 --> 06:34.000]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[06:34.000 --> 06:44.000]  And then they began to weaponize them and they began to have some of their allies within the internet world,
[06:44.000 --> 06:52.000]  like infowars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[06:55.000 --> 07:04.000]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[07:04.000 --> 07:20.000]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[07:20.000 --> 07:27.000]  Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are at war with America,
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  they're at war with nation states, they're at war with Christianity.
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  They're at war against everything that's free and open.
[07:34.000 --> 07:42.000]  And their main captain is a horrible, evil, 89-year-old, 88-year-old Nazi collaborator named George Soros.
[07:42.000 --> 07:53.000]  And the left is on the left, they are a criminal combine that seeks the overthrow of culture and the enslavement of producers.
[07:53.000 --> 08:03.000]  And the ultra-rich are tax-exempt, outside the nation state, international and above the law.
[08:03.000 --> 08:10.000]  And they are trying to destroy President Trump, they're trying to destroy Infowars, they're trying to destroy the Free Press.
[08:10.000 --> 08:19.000]  And I, quite frankly, am honored to be right at the center of their attacks because they know what we're talking about
[08:19.000 --> 08:31.000]  is absolutely on target dealing with the globalist operation, their program and how to stop them.
[08:31.000 --> 08:35.000]  We're going to get into Russia, presses Trump for a White House meeting with Putin, that's really important.
[08:35.000 --> 08:42.000]  The big interview, Firestorm, the Ted Nugent interview is finally up, it's on Infowars.com right now.
[08:42.000 --> 08:57.000]  But the first big thing I want to cover when we get to the next segment is Trump threatens to cut off aid to Honduras over big caravan.
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  Trump declares DACA dead urges Congress to act on border.
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  South Texas Border Patrol agents overwhelmed by illegal border crossers.
[09:06.000 --> 09:13.000]  Caravan releases list of demands and expects Trump to comply.
[09:13.000 --> 09:21.000]  Open the borders to us because we are as much citizens as the people of countries where we are and or travel.
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  That's globalism right there, that's direct UN.
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  Who do you think runs the UN Refugee Operation out of Honduras?
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.000]  That's where it was actually based, they would decide from Central and South America who could come into the U.S.
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  and tell the State Department under Obama via UNESCO who could come in.
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  And there are migrants coming in out of Africa, the Middle East, you name it, into Honduras as the staging point.
[09:42.000 --> 09:49.000]  You can look that up until Trump killed it about a year ago now, six months into office, five months into office.
[09:49.000 --> 09:56.000]  If you remember, the UN ran the refugee program and the State Department took orders from it.
[09:56.000 --> 10:03.000]  And this is just like Soros opened up those arteries through Turkey, out of the Middle East, through Syria.
[10:03.000 --> 10:17.000]  The Syrian invasion was as much a migrant invasion through Syria in a takeover by the Islamists and the globalists as it was for the invasion of Europe.
[10:17.000 --> 10:24.000]  And of course the Zodiac boats by the hundreds a day coming into Italy dumping off the folks out of North Africa.
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.000]  And then the EU now wants a navy to stop the Italian navy turning back the invaders.
[10:30.000 --> 10:37.000]  And the EU said a few months ago, we will start attacking your ships.
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  So here it is. Caravan through Mexico is one of the largest in 10-year trek history.
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.000]  Third Mexican town welcomes migrant caravan 400 miles closer to U.S.
[10:49.000 --> 10:54.000]  They pledge to continue on even though the Mexican government says it will disband the caravan.
[10:54.000 --> 10:57.000]  But organizers say some of its members will continue north.
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.000]  So this is about busting our government open, our sovereignty open.
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  It's all the UN plan to invade the first world with the third world,
[11:06.000 --> 11:14.000]  not to empower the third world, the globalists have been completely using and abusing and dominating and controlling
[11:14.000 --> 11:22.000]  by financing left-wing and right-wing governments. The UN, the IMF comes in and will do the leftist funding generally.
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.000]  And the U.S. and others come in and do the right-wing funding, but it's all controlled.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  They're all consolidates power.
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  Remember Perkins went public with the confessions of an economic hitman.
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  Now it was left and right control, but it was all the same thing.
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  So that's where we are dealing with this.
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.000]  We're going to be playing some of those clips and getting into Trump and getting into their unbelievable demands.
[11:45.000 --> 11:53.000]  But what's interesting is that the media is acting like Trump's a weirdo or some type of delusional rube
[11:53.000 --> 12:01.000]  because the president is obsessed with this and pointing this out.
[12:01.000 --> 12:09.000]  This is a direct UN globalist invasion operation that they've already done in Europe.
[12:09.000 --> 12:18.000]  And once they bust it open, once they open a hole up, they will collapse the entire country.
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  Then they'll use the giant new groups they brought in political leverage.
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  So more on that and their demands in the next segment.
[12:26.000 --> 12:33.000]  Then I'm going to get into the latest false lawsuit against him for a worse file yesterday.
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.000]  Hey, I got a two-week rest this time. It wasn't a couple in a week.
[12:37.000 --> 12:40.000]  And again, I'm being honest with the listeners.
[12:40.000 --> 12:47.000]  All of these lawsuits are according to multiple law firms I've checked with the complete trash grade.
[12:47.000 --> 12:53.000]  He got penny stocks, he got junk stocks, he got blue chips. This is junk stocks.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  I mean, the filings, 90% of them aren't even accurate. It's other people's websites, other quotes.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  It's just a demonization of info wars.
[12:59.000 --> 13:07.000]  And even the Daily Beast and others have quotes and they're saying there's major slapback provisions here.
[13:07.000 --> 13:13.000]  You can scroll into the article. There's no lawsuit here. This is really dangerous.
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  The people that filed it, why did they do it?
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.000]  And it turns out we did do the correction, retraction before the 30-day deadline.
[13:21.000 --> 13:30.000]  And we did remove it the day of not three weeks later when we got their letter about an image of Nick Cruz
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  that was all over the media that wasn't Nick Cruz. It was a guy in a communist shirt.
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.000]  We're not going to show the guy. We didn't even say his name. Other people did.
[13:39.000 --> 13:45.000]  We said, allegedly, the guy's name wasn't even known out there until he went to the media,
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  made an issue out of it, attached his name to it.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  And so we've been singled out. And I'm sad that happened to them and all the rest of them.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  You have a right to wear a hammer and sickle shirt if you want to in America.
[13:56.000 --> 14:03.000]  And that individual is not Cruz, the shooter.
[14:03.000 --> 14:10.000]  But it just shows how under state law we have the retraction in and we had the removal before we even got the letter.
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  We had the removal and then everybody else still has it up.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  But it's us that gets sued and the lawyers look at that and they say, yeah, there's not a lawsuit here.
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.000]  But there is a PR stunt for the law firms.
[14:22.000 --> 14:28.000]  And maybe these plaintiffs don't know, but they better have signed documents from these law firms
[14:28.000 --> 14:37.000]  that when there's the slapback suit, even the Daily Beast says the classic slapback,
[14:37.000 --> 14:43.000]  all these groups that they've got a serious problem.
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  So we're going to talk about that coming up as well.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  But this is because the global is fierce.
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  Now that said, we've got it in this special today.
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]  It is your financing of this broadcast that makes all of this possible.
[14:56.000 --> 15:02.000]  And we don't take a ton of money to beat each one of these, but it takes money to then do the slap suit and get the money back.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  So it's going to take a lot of money because there's a lot of lawsuits.
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  There's a lot of money and I need everybody to get products you already need.
[15:08.000 --> 15:14.000]  High quality air filtration, water filtration, books, videos, t-shirts, thousands of great items and the supplements.

[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  When you get it with the real red pill and brain force on top of 50%,

[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  Available at infowarslife.com
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  Introducing pollen block.
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[19:10.000 --> 19:17.000]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[19:22.000 --> 19:26.000]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials,
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.000]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.000]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[19:41.000 --> 19:47.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[19:47.000 --> 19:51.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[19:54.000 --> 20:23.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[20:23.000 --> 20:30.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:30.000 --> 20:36.000]  Well, we took a major beach head in the swamp, and Trump is doing his best job to deliver.
[20:36.000 --> 20:39.000]  I don't think any of us can do as good a job as he's done.
[20:39.000 --> 20:42.000]  It's easy to be encultured and constantly criticized.
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  I think there's a role there to hold feet to the fire,
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.000]  but Trump doesn't need his feet held to the fire.
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.000]  He's getting as much done as he can, not being a dictator.
[20:52.000 --> 20:58.000]  Now, that said, what the president is a dictator of, or the executive, is the borders with farmers.
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.000]  They don't have the rights of citizens, and people don't in any other nation in the world,
[21:03.000 --> 21:08.000]  except the EU, where they're collapsing into North Africa and into the Middle East,
[21:08.000 --> 21:11.000]  with all the nightmares that come with that.
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  But this caravan has been going on for 10 years,
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  bringing people in from different parts of the world into the United States.
[21:18.000 --> 21:23.000]  And that's the point I've been making, is that Honduras is the staging ground
[21:23.000 --> 21:29.000]  of the UN Refugee Resettlement Program in Central America.
[21:29.000 --> 21:37.000]  It's the main base to bring in African and Islamic, European, you name it,
[21:37.000 --> 21:42.000]  illegals that could pay money to get into the US.
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  Not a lot of Chinese coming in, but remember, it was about four years ago, three years ago,
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.000]  the head of South Khan,
[21:49.000 --> 21:53.000]  head of South Khan,
[21:53.000 --> 22:01.000]  came out and warned everyone and said, Al Qaeda and ISIS are coming into the US through Honduras.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  You can search into that.
[22:03.000 --> 22:10.000]  General in charge of South Khan, Aida Al Qaeda coming in through Central America.
[22:10.000 --> 22:18.000]  And then you read where they're coming into, it's Honduras.
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  So that's why you look at these migrants, and most of them aren't even Hispanic.
[22:23.000 --> 22:28.000]  A lot of them are Arabic, black, you name it, because they have come here from other parts of the world.
[22:28.000 --> 22:34.000]  There it is, Islamic State and Infiltrate US, who Caribbean and South America general says.
[22:34.000 --> 22:43.000]  Scroll down a little bit. I want to read that Washington Post article, please. Thank you.
[22:43.000 --> 22:49.000]  About 100 people have joined the Islamic State militant group from countries in the Caribbean and South America,
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.000]  and existing human settling networks are in place that could allow them to infiltrate the United States.
[22:53.000 --> 22:59.000]  They return, said Marine General John F. Kelly, chief of the Southern Command.
[22:59.000 --> 23:02.000]  I wonder what Trump's getting all his intel to stop this now.
[23:02.000 --> 23:09.000]  The Senate Armed Services Committee, the networks are so efficient that if a terrorist or almost anyone wants to get into the country,
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  they just pay the fare.
[23:11.000 --> 23:19.000]  Now, the reason I just had them search into that, that was what, three, four years ago, when he was not in the executive branch.
[23:19.000 --> 23:24.000]  But the military, the head of South Khan, I don't just say these things.
[23:24.000 --> 23:29.000]  I don't just say the UN has its base down there, or it was being run by Peter Sutherland, who just died a few months ago,
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  the head of the UN refugee program.
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  What I'm telling you that is, yeah, there's a map right there.
[23:35.000 --> 23:44.000]  The Washington Post showing how people are streaming into Syria to invade,
[23:44.000 --> 23:52.000]  and then streaming back out into Europe, Africa, and Central and South America into the U.S.
[23:52.000 --> 24:00.000]  Terrorists from groups beside ISIS crossing U.S.-Mexico border, U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis says,
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  and even Politifact has to admit that's true.
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.000]  Of course, they lie most of the time, so you know it's ultra-true.
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  So that's what's going on here.
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.000]  And then you read the out-of-control, redonkulous demands,
[24:14.000 --> 24:20.000]  and you look at how the president's being criticized for, quote, being obsessed with this.
[24:20.000 --> 24:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can put the London Guardian articles where Mexico pours pepper sauce down your nose if you're lucky,
[24:30.000 --> 24:36.000]  if you're not, they really hurt you, and they torture you if you are an illegal.
[24:36.000 --> 24:42.000]  And if you help an illegal, they are known to kill you.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  And that's come out in documentaries.
[24:44.000 --> 24:50.000]  They take people basically in slaughterhouses, and they hang you up by chains, and they beat you in the legs,
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  and then they slit your throat.
[24:53.000 --> 24:59.000]  Now, I don't want to slit the throats of coyotes, smugglers.
[24:59.000 --> 25:03.000]  I don't want to shoot Tabasco up their noses either.
[25:03.000 --> 25:09.000]  But the Mexican government also knows that the coyotes have killed over 100,000 people conservatively
[25:09.000 --> 25:13.000]  on just the border with Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, California.
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.000]  I mean, they have found already over 100,000 people the last decade,
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  and they think there's probably five times that.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  I mean, they are robbing these people.
[25:22.000 --> 25:23.000]  They are abusing these people.
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  It is horrible.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  I want to see these countries industrialized.
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.000]  I want to see them first world.
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  I want to see Mexico beautiful everywhere like it is in some spots.
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  In first world, I'll go move down there.
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  I'm not afraid of brown people.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  I'm afraid of brown people turned into leftists that hate my guts, just like white leftists.
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  But that's the reality of where we are.
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  And then you get these insane demands.
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.000]  It's crazy.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  But if you look at this caravan, the media will focus on maybe one woman out of 100,
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  but I've watched the videos closely, just like the North African invasion.
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  It's like, we'll see one woman.
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  The media focuses on that, who sent over as a tokenism.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  This isn't women and children.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  This is men.
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.000]  They've been organized by Soros and the UN, and they are setting a migration wave chain
[26:15.000 --> 26:21.000]  to implode the U.S. and sink this lifeboat, not just the others.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  I don't blame these men wanting to come here.
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  There's a woman right there.
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  I don't blame these people wanting a better future.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  I get it.
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  But the point is, is that they're being used as a weapon.
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  Listen to this, and you listen to this globalist rhetoric.
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  Open the borders to us, because we are as much citizens as people of countries
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  where we are and travel.
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  I'm going to read the rest of the insane demands that are right out of globalism
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  and give you their mission.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  It's on infowars.com, newswars.com, and linked on drugsreport.com.
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  You've got the most complete coverage.
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.000]  Now, I'm going to plug again, because I tend to plug like once an hour.
[26:59.000 --> 27:06.000]  And I need to, Google kicked us off via Adroll last year.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  That cost us about $5 million.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  And then I thought, oh, well, we'll ramp up some other online advertising by next year,
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  but it just didn't ever get back to that number.
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  It got up to about $2 million.
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  We're bringing in, that sounds like a lot, not when you got 100 crew members
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  and built this infrastructure.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  So I was looking at this year while we're not bringing in as much,
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.000]  and it's because of that Google advertising ban last year.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  Talk about draconian.
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.000]  So we're back at that point.
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  I need everybody to understand you really need to take turmeric for your family,
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  you and your children.
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  You really need the colloidal silver we've got in your medicine cabinet.
[27:38.000 --> 27:39.000]  You really need brain force.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  You really need the real red pill.
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  They make people's lives so much better.
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  These are the most cutting edge supplements where the leading competitors put five,
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  seven times the markup on it.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  We don't do that.
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  We don't have a 700% markup.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  We have a 100% markup.
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  That means, again, if it costs $10, we sell it for $20.
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.000]  After the marketing and all the expenses, I mean, nobody sells quality products.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  We use four different major suppliers, top labs.
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  None of them can believe we put this much product in.
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  These are all the very best products and they're great and they're amazing.
[28:13.000 --> 28:14.000]  We've got the biggest sales.
[28:14.000 --> 28:20.000]  We've run a long time, 50% off the real red pill, the seven day challenge.
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  It takes about seven days to kick in.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  You've got 50% off brain force plus, we rarely do that.
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  It's 50% off and you get free shipping when you get those two together.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  We can get them individually, 50% off.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  They go together like a horse in carriage.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  Brain force takes 30 minutes to kick in.
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  You've got the body's ultimate tumor formula back in stock, 25% off.
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  Those purchases are what funds this operation.
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.000]  MFullWarsLive.com, MFullWarsStore.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[28:47.000 --> 28:52.000]  These all have thousands of reviews. When we have a combo, there's no reviews because it's a new combo.
[28:52.000 --> 29:18.000]  At least you can read those reviews for yourself and your family.
[29:22.000 --> 29:32.000]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.000]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[29:51.000 --> 30:00.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX. That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[30:00.000 --> 30:03.000]  I want to plow into all of this.
[30:03.000 --> 30:09.000]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that
[30:09.000 --> 30:18.000]  when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from MFullWarsStore.com,
[30:18.000 --> 30:22.000]  you are funding the revolution. I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[30:22.000 --> 30:26.000]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at MFullWarsStore.com.
[30:26.000 --> 30:30.000]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver
[30:30.000 --> 30:33.000]  and with high-quality atomic iodine.
[30:33.000 --> 30:36.000]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.000]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[30:38.000 --> 30:41.000]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[30:41.000 --> 30:45.000]  MFullWarsLife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[30:45.000 --> 30:49.000]  And your person of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.000]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[30:52.000 --> 30:55.000]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are.
[30:55.000 --> 31:24.000]  And they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[31:24.000 --> 31:25.000]  Thank you.
[31:25.000 --> 31:30.000]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans.
[31:30.000 --> 31:35.000]  The super blue is awesome. And thank you so much, Alex, for the MFullWarsLife products.
[31:35.000 --> 31:38.000]  They are quality. I can't wait to get some more.
[31:38.000 --> 31:41.000]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[31:41.000 --> 31:42.000]  Absolutely.
[31:42.000 --> 31:47.000]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women
[31:47.000 --> 31:50.000]  understand that there's bigger problems going on.
[31:50.000 --> 31:55.000]  And if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[32:20.000 --> 32:24.000]  We can make it better. Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[32:24.000 --> 32:27.000]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  It's $19.95 right now.
[32:29.000 --> 32:34.000]  So you get an incredible top of the line Neutropic for $19.95.
[32:34.000 --> 32:39.000]  Believe me, when we're selling it for $35 on average, we need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation
[32:39.000 --> 32:41.000]  in the face of the globalists, the rest of it.
[32:41.000 --> 32:44.000]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[32:44.000 --> 32:51.000]  I want to shell it all out before the big supply comes in and I want people that haven't tried BrainForce to try it and find out why.
[32:51.000 --> 32:53.000]  It's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews.
[32:53.000 --> 32:54.000]  It's amazing.
[32:54.000 --> 33:18.000]  InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsLive.com or AAA-2533139.
[33:24.000 --> 33:50.000]  All right, I'm going to get into the demands of the U.N. funded, the best-admitted, globalist caravan organization
[33:50.000 --> 33:54.000]  that leads people into the United States.
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.000]  They have similar groups obviously in Europe out of Syria.
[33:57.000 --> 34:03.000]  That's why it was important to bring down Syria during the last five-year civil war because even though they never fully toppled the government
[34:03.000 --> 34:13.000]  or the system, they were able to get corridors into Turkey who then took the select groups and put them into Europe.
[34:13.000 --> 34:23.000]  Erdogan has threatened to use them as a weapon system to, quote, burn down Europe if they don't let Turkey parties and most European countries are parliamentary.
[34:23.000 --> 34:28.000]  So you know there's maybe 5, 10% of the population Islamic groups are.
[34:28.000 --> 34:37.000]  Erdogan can then direct them and throw elections either way when you've got 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15 different parties.
[34:37.000 --> 34:45.000]  That's how Merkel still stays in power even though her party's 30-something percent of the voters and the seats.
[34:45.000 --> 34:55.000]  There's so many other parties and then they keep making coalitions because her party's still in control so they can give money to the other groups and basically buy off their leaders.
[34:55.000 --> 35:00.000]  So that's how you can have minority rule in something like a parliamentary system.
[35:00.000 --> 35:03.000]  That's why parliamentary systems are very, very dangerous.
[35:03.000 --> 35:09.000]  That's why our system, I believe, is superior but we'll get more into that and their demands.
[35:09.000 --> 35:22.000]  But Nico, the lead producer, pointed out to me during the break, he goes, you know, you never talk about the studies and you never get into these products where we're able to get into studies about them and their ingredients.
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.000]  Why don't you do that?
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  I said, what do you mean?
[35:24.000 --> 35:29.000]  He goes, well, you just say the amazing benefits of turmeric and bodies is the strongest out there.
[35:29.000 --> 35:36.000]  It has a 95 percent curcumin and rate leading competitors, 3 percent because they just don't care.
[35:36.000 --> 35:37.000]  It's just watered down crap.
[35:37.000 --> 35:42.000]  Ours is the strongest we believe you can get.
[35:42.000 --> 35:48.000]  That's why we have a limited supply of it in right now because we couldn't even get enough to have it at the 95 percent rate, which is the highest recorded out there.
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.000]  We want the highest.
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.000]  Here's an article daily mail.
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  Is turmeric really a wonder drug for migraines?
[35:56.000 --> 36:04.000]  The spice which has been a staple in India and Southeast Asian meals for thousands of years has become hugely popular in recent years for its many health benefits.
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  From lowering heart disease risk to clearing up bad skin.
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.000]  Increasingly, it's also been seen as a way to relieve head pain, sinus issues.
[36:14.000 --> 36:19.000]  Its active ingredient has an anti-inflammatory effect and is a strong antioxidant.
[36:19.000 --> 36:27.000]  Here, researchers, doctors and nutritionists, way on the science behind it, decide whether turmeric really is a wonder drug that can cure or prevent migraines.
[36:27.000 --> 36:33.000]  Research on whether turmeric and curcumin, and again that's curcuminoids, can cure or prevent migraines.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  It has been mixed and it just goes into it.
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.000]  But it goes on migraines characterized by throbbing and pulsating pain.
[36:39.000 --> 36:45.000]  In fact, millions of people registered dietary nutritionists and it goes into all the different perspectives, different issues.
[36:45.000 --> 36:56.000]  But what we know is, it is an amazing anti-inflammatory that migraines are associated with inflammation on the brain, just like Alzheimer's, so many other issues.
[36:56.000 --> 37:13.000]  And all I know is, with allergies and things, if I take my bodies, if I take the pollen block, it goes from me having a pounding headache during the really, really bad seasonal distress times to feeling pretty good.
[37:13.000 --> 37:16.000]  My problem is, I forget to take it.
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  And it's the same thing.
[37:18.000 --> 37:25.000]  When I take the X2, when I'm tired and got to keep working, I don't have that third cup of coffee, you know, at six or seven at night.
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.000]  I have a brain force.
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  Now, if I take two brain force, I've become a jerk.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  But it is strong.
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  It's totally different than coffee.
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.000]  It's all natural.
[37:34.000 --> 37:35.000]  It's amazing.
[37:35.000 --> 37:45.000]  And I am plugging here because they are going over us with a fine-toothed comb, trying to shut us down just like they're trying to shut down the president.
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  He has thousands of lawsuits against him.
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.000]  And it's total harassment.
[37:50.000 --> 37:51.000]  We have this stuff.
[37:51.000 --> 37:58.000]  And even, even again, Buzzfeed and the Daily Beast and others say, yeah, this is very frivolous.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  It's going to be a slapback.
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  He can definitely shoot the person back.
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.000]  This is bizarre.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  They say that we didn't do the retraction within the 30 days.
[38:08.000 --> 38:15.000]  We did a retraction and a correction.
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  And they don't care.
[38:17.000 --> 38:25.000]  They're just moving ahead because the Democratic Party up at the top, farm stuff out, contacts people, gives them lawyers, and then does this.
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.000]  They don't know, and I'll find out in the discovery.
[38:30.000 --> 38:38.000]  People are being told that there's slapback provisions that are very, very strong for the person that files the suit, and not just have to pay attorney's fees, but pay serious damages.
[38:38.000 --> 38:44.000]  And there it is, even in the Daily Beast.
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  Let's go up a couple of paragraphs.
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  I'll actually read where they talk about it.
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  I'll just read it from my article out here.
[38:49.000 --> 38:50.000]  This is the part.
[38:50.000 --> 38:55.000]  We also accused Parkland school shooters, Sue's Alex Jones, for info or information.
[38:55.000 --> 39:01.000]  Again, we never, document cam is the easiest way to do this.
[39:01.000 --> 39:15.000]  We never said the guy's name was Pitcher was circling the internet news articles as Cruz, as Nicholas Cruz weeks before we ever got a letter.
[39:15.000 --> 39:23.000]  The day of the shooting on Valentine's Day, we took his picture down once the real picture of Cruz came out just just hours later.
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  And that's all there.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  And they just send a lawsuit.
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  You didn't take it down.
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.000]  You didn't retract.
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.000]  Correct.
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  Yeah, we did under Texas code.
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  It's thrown out summary judgment.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  And then you read the lawsuit though.
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  It's got all this other stuff that wasn't from our website.
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  And we know where it's from.
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  It's from 4chan other sites.
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  And they're just saying it's us.
[39:44.000 --> 39:51.000]  And my own lawyers said this is a political stunt just like all the others to associate you with lawsuits and lies and failure.
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  When the Democratic Party is collapsing, CNN is collapsing.
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  Bank Street media has already gone bankrupt.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  All the big major newspapers are up for sale.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  The New York Times is propped up by a Mexican kingpin.
[40:04.000 --> 40:14.000]  He's been associated with all sorts of issues.
[40:14.000 --> 40:25.000]  You've got Bezos and he just lost $30 billion last week for all the stuff he's involved in controlling the failed Washington Post using it as a weapon, who by the way, celebrating this against us, but even the daily beast in here.
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  And I'm not going to say the name of the guy whose picture got wrongly associated with this.
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.000]  We took it down.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  We corrected it.
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  We apologized when no one else did. It was on thousands of sites.
[40:35.000 --> 40:42.000]  But the media picking this up is the first time I've ever heard of this guy's name.
[40:42.000 --> 40:50.000]  The claim that we popularize his name is not true.
[40:50.000 --> 40:57.000]  And it goes into it here in the article.
[40:57.000 --> 41:03.000]  Ken White, a First Amendment litigator at Brown, White and Osborne said the suit had run afoul of Texas state law.
[41:03.000 --> 41:09.000]  Oh, yeah, because we have the correction, retraction.
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  The 30 days right there.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  That's totally it's gone.
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  It's crazy Tom.
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  It continues.
[41:17.000 --> 41:27.000]  The core of the lawsuit that info wars falsely accused Mr. Fontaine of being the shooter states a very plausible claim for defamation and intentional influx of emotional distress.
[41:27.000 --> 41:36.000]  White told the Daily Beast the problem is, is that the complaint buries that core wrong into a general attack on info wars and Alex Jones and their fans.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  That's a huge political statement.
[41:38.000 --> 41:43.000]  It's like the Georgetown lawsuit that might make for good press, but it's dangerous.
[41:43.000 --> 41:44.000]  White continued.
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  He's a very respected lawyer, by the way, that's why even the Daily Beast had to quote him.
[41:48.000 --> 41:51.000]  Texas has a very strong anti slap law.
[41:51.000 --> 42:08.000]  If info wars can frame the lawsuit as being more broadly about the content of its speech in general, or about the speech of a third party commentators for whom info wars is not responsible under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the plaintiff faces a real risk of anti slap ruling.
[42:08.000 --> 42:22.000]  And then it goes into the slap or strategic lawsuit against public participation, refers to strategic frivolous lawsuits designed to silence particular categories of speech in the DC suit against me.
[42:22.000 --> 42:31.000]  That's what's so crazy by Georgetown, which lawyers have never seen a free speech lab do this because it's taxpayer funded.
[42:31.000 --> 42:36.000]  It says they want to silence me and stop all my speech.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  And then I'm a horrible person and it says a bunch of stuff.
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  I didn't say that that defames me.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  And this suit says that stuff too.
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.000]  That's what's that's what's next level folks.
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.000]  They really think that the Democrats and stuff they're going to get rid of free speech and then it goes into all this.
[42:50.000 --> 42:59.000]  They admit that's what this is, is to shut up what we're doing and saying by misrepresenting something we did that we didn't do.
[42:59.000 --> 43:07.000]  In full wars life is launching its newest product. We're really, really proud of it. It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[47:02.000 --> 47:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. Resistance to Tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[47:22.000 --> 47:43.000]  So Infowars is right up there at the highest level of being under attack. We're under more attack than Laura Ingram, we're under more attack than Sean Hannity, we're under more attack than anybody but the President and Drudge Report.
[47:43.000 --> 48:05.000]  Now Drudge doesn't get attacked a lot in the open but at the Federal Elections Commission and at the congressional level and at the FCC level, they have said they want to shut him down and take him over and in the George Soros documents and the U.N. documents, they are more obsessed with Drudge than even myself and they want to silence him.
[48:05.000 --> 48:15.000]  So he's got the really serious hidden stuff but people know Drudge is just links and there's occasional commentary and exclusives so they know people don't buy going after him.
[48:15.000 --> 48:21.000]  He isn't a good target for going after free speech so that the attacks on him are covert.
[48:21.000 --> 48:41.000]  Now there it is, FCC Chair warns that conservative media like Drudge Report and Sean Hannity will face a regulation. That's because they came within one vote of shutting Drudge down saying he was involved in campaigns so it really is incredible.
[48:41.000 --> 49:00.000]  Now speaking of being under attack, it's on infowars.com, it's on newswars.com. I saw some of Jim Carrey's art about a week ago and I actually went to a site and spent about 10 minutes looking at it and I got to say some of his art I would say is really, really good.
[49:00.000 --> 49:16.000]  And then I was going to invite him on the show and you know I know he doesn't like the broadcast and see if he wanted to have a debate because I mean I know good art when I see it he is a good political cartoonist.
[49:16.000 --> 49:24.000]  Well Jim Carrey attacks Alex Jones and Sean Hannity in latest art piece.
[49:24.000 --> 49:34.000]  Once you show the one supposedly with Trump and Stormy Daniels that's a good one too. Again we're a radio show, we also simulcast on TV if you're listening to us driving down the road and you're going what do you mean look at this, look at that.
[49:34.000 --> 49:45.000]  We have live streams at infowars.com forward slash show. But please whatever you do, I mean you got to admit that's good art.
[49:45.000 --> 49:54.000]  Please support our local affiliates as well and spread the word about those. But there's a new attack piece and we'll get into it in a moment.
[49:54.000 --> 50:03.000]  But Jim Carrey's a funny guy he was married to McCarthy and I think it's his son with her or maybe he was just married to her she has an autistic son she's been on before I've been on her show.
[50:03.000 --> 50:18.000]  But you know vaccines are damaging people the documents are in the facts are in and I'm somebody that's exposing that and I'm exposing chemicals in the water and I'm exposing globalism and I'm exposing the Arab Spring and really bad stuff.
[50:18.000 --> 50:26.000]  So Carrey gets up there and talks about the Illuminati and the New World Order and I've never really reached out to him because I kind of tune Hollywood out.
[50:26.000 --> 50:36.000]  But I want to know if it's all an act or if he's really that crazy.
[50:36.000 --> 50:44.000]  I don't know what he's up to but I would like to challenge him to come on the show. You know Roseanne Barr says I woke her up she came on few times years ago.
[50:44.000 --> 50:54.000]  She's been talking to Daria she says she'll come on and I am interested in celebrities when they're controversial when they have something interesting to say when they're going against the grain.
[50:54.000 --> 51:05.000]  Carrey has done that some in his career but now he's not he seems to be establishment and tries to be ironic and you know gets up there and talks about the meaning of life and how empty Hollywood is.
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.000]  Well I agree with him on that front.
[51:08.000 --> 51:25.000]  I think he should come on the broad jest Jim Carrey attacks Alex Jones Hannity and latest art piece meanwhile corporate media dying as info wars is exploding and that's why they're suing us and lying about us and misrepresenting us.
[51:25.000 --> 51:33.000]  Is there dying Hollywood's dying the establishment's dying mainstream media has already collapsed and they want to drag us into their hole. Here's the deal.
[51:33.000 --> 51:40.000]  You could shut everything down I've got you take it three four years even if you succeed with these suits which they're not going to.
[51:40.000 --> 51:46.000]  And I could just declare bankruptcy and step right over to a new company and work for it.
[51:46.000 --> 51:51.000]  And then legally and lawfully run operations and expose the globalist and get a salary.
[51:51.000 --> 52:03.000]  The only way you're going to shut me up is killing me or demonizing my name so much that you then get governments to the platform and Alex Jones is Prasada non grata and is blocked from the Internet.
[52:03.000 --> 52:13.000]  Which they can do with these bots and these these algorithms and systems where they'll ban a video and then we try to re upload it and it's banned we try to re upload another account it's banned.
[52:13.000 --> 52:22.000]  That's the AI systems they've got in place that would really allow massive censorship and that's why we all need third party platforms and individual platforms that are independent.
[52:22.000 --> 52:29.000]  Our own and other patriot platforms to fight the establishment Matt Drudge is absolutely right he was always right we should get out of the.
[52:29.000 --> 52:37.000]  Internet ghettos and now I know he was right two and a half years ago when he visited I said well maybe Matt we should use the big platforms to build our own.
[52:37.000 --> 52:44.000]  He said it's too late for that on on air and off air he said you've got to leave now before the center ships complete.
[52:44.000 --> 53:01.000]  And you've got to have all your talent all your energy and all your articles off their system now before the big clampdown comes or you won't have the big enough platform to challenge it and then they'll come after your platform itself which they're now doing so.
[53:01.000 --> 53:07.000]  We're here this is the real fight for free speech the real fight for America I'm gonna get back into news but.
[53:07.000 --> 53:16.000]  Hollywood funny man Jim Carrey tweeted out a drawing of info was founder Alan Jones wrestling Fox host Sean Hannity.
[53:16.000 --> 53:20.000]  Suggesting their pro liberty views are as fake as WWE rumbles.
[53:20.000 --> 53:25.000]  Now I really believe in free speech of the second amendment private property my god look how great it is compared to other countries.
[53:25.000 --> 53:32.000]  I mean I live here bro if you believe wrestling is real you may believe Fox News info wars and the robotic drones of Sinclair broadcasting.
[53:32.000 --> 53:40.000]  What is Sinclair broadcasting with its talking points had to do with us I mean mainstream media's who's robotic.
[53:40.000 --> 53:45.000]  And it just goes on here ladies and gentlemen.
[53:45.000 --> 53:54.000]  But wrestling doesn't harm viewers performers like Sean Hannity and Alex Jones should join the WWE where their hyperbole will do less damage to the culture.
[53:54.000 --> 54:00.000]  The other human features Hitler giving a Nazi salute suggesting info wars Alex Jones news paddle a fascist authoritarian ideology.
[54:00.000 --> 54:10.000]  Which in reality is emanating from the lettuce culture such as their constant attacks against the first and second amendments.
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  Well there you go it just goes on from there.
[54:13.000 --> 54:20.000]  See the art up on info wars dot com will tweet it out to hey I see this is a badge of honor.
[54:20.000 --> 54:27.000]  That caring. He might be on our side trying to be ironic and getting people to pay attention to what's going on.
[54:27.000 --> 54:31.000]  I mean there's something weird going on or it could just be completely insane.
[54:31.000 --> 54:37.000]  But I remember his attack on.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  One of my.
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.000]  True Hollywood icons because of how hard he worked for the soul rights movement and how hard he worked.
[54:43.000 --> 54:51.000]  The second member Charlton Heston who was very very nice to me the few times he came on and.
[54:51.000 --> 54:58.000]  Spent most of his fortune flying around on his private jet speaking to high schools colleges going on talk radio fighting for the second amendment.
[54:58.000 --> 54:59.000]  He's such a patriot.
[54:59.000 --> 55:07.000]  He was involved in civil rights movement in the late 40s when nobody was not this late 60s when it was cool and you know all that had already happened.
[55:07.000 --> 55:14.000]  And it just sick how you know carry attacked him viciously and made fun of him.
[55:14.000 --> 55:21.000]  So maybe he's just a total scumbag I don't know but he's done some mixed bag stuff it just just truly sad.
[55:21.000 --> 55:29.000]  But there you go a Hitler salute us Jim Carrey says so so we must be Hitler.
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.000]  We must be bad.
[55:32.000 --> 55:42.000]  Now if you compare David Hogg Hitler when he's clicking his heels and giving a fashion salute you get kicked off YouTube but.
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.000]  I guess some public figures are more equal than others huh.
[55:46.000 --> 55:54.000]  All right I did not get to it yet we will get to it with Matt Bracken former Navy SEAL counterterrorism experts predicted so much of what's happening I'll get into Trump's response to the caravan.
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.000]  The 10th such caravan we just know about it now because Trump is opposing it and expose it will give you their demands.
[55:59.000 --> 56:11.000]  I'll get into the latest Russian news there's so much but I want to just say this so the sink sink is not normally just rattle on audience radio affiliates TV affiliates thank you for your support.
[56:11.000 --> 56:17.000]  We're all in this together and they admit that if they can take down info wars they can take us all down so.

[56:26.000 --> 56:30.000]  But they've cut off the sponsors they've blocked us advertising on Google.
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  They have filed.
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.000]  13 lawsuits we've beaten six hour.
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  Got seven to deal with.
[56:41.000 --> 56:46.000]  None of them have teeth but one and that one's got rotten teeth and we're close to dealing with that one.
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  I'm going to DC next week.

[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  We are back live we have Matt Bracken joining us to talk about this whole illegal alien globalist funded caravan that Trump standing up against that the media is flipping out about.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  Also have a flashback upon info wars dot com by Ben Warren Mexico threatened to flood the US with illegals have not given favorable NAFTA deal.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  And now Trump is saying you're not going to have one side of deal.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  Mexico has begun to help flood and open up its border with Guatemala which is crazy.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  The national security of either country because in Mexico's got its problems in certain zones.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  It's on the high end of third world countries and it's got some of the prettiest places some of the best food.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  In the world some of the best art.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Some of the you name it.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  So the best step in the world comes from Mexico and.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  Then open themselves up to Guatemala.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  And right down into Honduras and all that is insane.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  Ever been to Honduras I have.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  Frightening.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  Ever been to Guatemala.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  I have terrifying.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  Terrifying.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  Very beautiful.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  Volcanoes and parents everywhere but I mean it is it is it is it is dangerous.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  It's like the whole country is like the worst parts of Mexico City.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  So there's nowhere safe in Guatemala there's nowhere safe in Honduras there's nowhere safe as you go south in Venezuela.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  And the UN is trying to open a corridor up up the railways.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  We've seen this before Obama opened it up.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  This is the tent such caravan by this group.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  So that's coming up in the next segment.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  You know I don't believe that there's secret elites that are space aliens I know the elites believe they're channeling evil spirits are off world entities and I think that's the Bible it's demons but.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  You look at Zuckerberg.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  He does look like a space alien.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  Headline Jones thinks Zuckerberg's a space alien with humanoid slaves on Mars never said that never joke that never said any of that.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  Look at this Cruz challenger raises staggering 6.7 million.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  That's way more than Cruz is raised.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  I mean the Democrats are on the war path and if we just get on the war path rule we're going to turn the country around get the economy fixed but they knew that they artificially shut the economy down to make people dependent.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  That's their globalist operation.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  That's their modus operandi.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  And so that's why they're so crazy.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  And that's why they're pushing so hard and that's why.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  They want to hurry up and get control again because they can't have this economy succeed.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  They can't have the family succeed.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  They can't even succeed.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  They have to have poverty to have control.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  Dem see hope in the land of Sheriff Joe.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  So it's just crazy and all these Republican establishment people have retired.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  So the Democrats have a chance to win.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  Breaking.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  We have a drudge siren.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is exactly what I had Matt Bracken on.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  I was going to ask Matt Bracken, should we put the military on in a civil emergency?
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  And that is just last segment.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  The president is a dictator when it comes to the border and non-citizens Trump sending military to the border.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  Have the writer screenshot that and get that headline out right now on infowars.com.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  So we have a siren, daily caller.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  Trump, we will guard our border with the military.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, it is on right now.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  Trump, we will guard our border with the military.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  President Donald Trump said today, the US military will be used to guard the US-Mexico border.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  We're going to guard our border with our military.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  So please, let's post a blurb of the daily caller and then I want to tweet out a box of the live feed and put it on Facebook.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  Let people know this just broke and we're covering live right now.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  Trump's announcement to put the military on the border to stop the globalist UN attempt to bust our nation wide open.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  This is the Info War.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  You are the front lines.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  You are the hope.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  You are the resistance.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  Please stay with us.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  We will continue to press the attack.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have it in Fuller's life.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  It take hours.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  It's stronger.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  It's back in stock.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  It's got the preglonone.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  So you can upload it.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  Our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine 4 to 5 toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  That's a spray you do.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  You can also swallow it.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake,
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  Well, it only happens every once in a while.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  But right now, we've got a big siren at drudgereport.com.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  I'm tweeting it out right now at Real Alex Jones and at Prison Planet with Paul Watson.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  Trump sending military to the border, caravan, vows march, a confrontation.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  Drudge is also linked to the group's demands that we're also going to be covering.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  This is pure UN, pure George Soros, Peter Sutherland. There are no borders.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  You must accept me, but I'm going to be directed by the UN.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  Then I'll be a voting block inside your country of globalism for collectivism controlled by the globalist, a domesticated controlled group.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  So let's go ahead and go over some of this article.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  Then we're going to go to Matt Bracken, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  Trump will guard our border with our military.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  U.S. Border Patrol agents detain undocumented immigrants from Central America after capturing them in a great group orchard.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  That's the photo they've got.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  We're going to be guarding our border with our military.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  That's a big step, Trump told reporters.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  We're going to get the video in a moment.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  Gather at the White House.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  We cannot have people flowing into our country illegally disappearing and by the way never showing up for court.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  Well, they give them like two, three year notices.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  They go be here in two years.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  The president's comments appear to take aim at the current U.S. policy which requires border agents to catch and then release family units who arrive at the border for non-contagious countries.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  But they let the contagious through with the border patrols on public with that.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  The plague, TB, you name it.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  He also said he spoke with Secretary of Defense James Mattis about the use of military to guard the border.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  In recent days, Trump has reportedly tweeted about a caravan of illegal immigrants making their way from Honduras to the U.S. border via Mexico.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  The president has threatened to end the NAFTA agreement in Mexican government and not stop the caravan.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  Mexican authorities responded to Trump's Sunday threat to kill NAFTA by pledging to disband the caravan and allow some transmitters to apply for asylum in Mexico.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  And it goes on. The organization, however, said many members of the group continue marching north to the U.S.-Mexican border if they claim asylum and are with a family unit.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  They legally must be released into the interior of the country.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  So this is the 10th time that this group has done this.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  So the president absolutely needs to mobilize not just the National Guard.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  He needs to ask the states to call up their state guards under the governors, and then they need to be put under federal command in an emergency like this.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  And that's totally constitutional.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  So that's basically the militia needs to be called out.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  And now in modern parlance, that's the National Guard and your state guard.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  That's what needs to be done right now.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  This is a classical attack to break up our sovereignty.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  As I said, we're five years behind Europe.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  And they've been doing this in Europe for six, seven years under Obama three years ago.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  They launched the beginning of it, calling it the children crisis.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  Only 17% were under the age of 18.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  Many of them had fake ID cards.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  Just like they have 25-year-old men in ninth grade in Sweden, raping little girls or getting them as their wives.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  And it turns out in the news they're 25 with beards.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  And they say, oh, I'm a little boy. I'm 13.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  That's how all this is operating and continuing.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  Back, Mexico threatens to flood U.S. with illegals have not given a favorable nap to deal infowars.com.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  So that's from last year.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  This is all happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  Now joining us is Matt Bracken, best-selling author, counterterrorism specialist,
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  former Navy SEAL, who's been predicting so much of this.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  We'll get into their demands coming up.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  This is classic globalism.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  But what do you think the president should do?
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  What do you think he's probably planning to do?
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  We know General Kelly was the former head of Southcom.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  He warned of this five years ago and warned Obama this was coming.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  So we know it's a U.N. globalist plan.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  Kelly pointed out that it was the U.N. running the refugee program out of Honduras
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  that was already in control of our State Department via Obama's executive orders that Trump has now rescinded.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  But they seem to be striking back and they intend to trigger with a trickle a flood.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  Matt Bracken.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  Yeah, this is a very important test, but I think that they're playing into Trump's hand.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  I think that Trump is going to be able to make a great show of force at the border.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  I think that maybe Ann Coulter was the first that I know of that started talking about using the military to build the wall.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  In fact, you don't really need a wall.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  A wall is nice, but it has some disadvantages.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  It takes way longer to build.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  It's very expensive.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  You really just want a big trench and a road.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  You just need multiple fences the way that the Israelis did it.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  You only use the wall where the Israeli border goes right through a built up urban area
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  where you have to build a physical obstacle where there's a building on each side of the street with a big obstacle down the middle.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  But out in the countryside, all you need are multiple fence systems with a patrol track in between.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  It's actually better than a wall because you can see the invaders massing on the other side.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  The wall gives them room to build a tent city or anything else in the shade right on the other side of the border.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  The biggest advantage, though, of a fence is speed.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  This isn't rocket science.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  You have contractors that are in the United States building this stuff to ship over to Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  It's made to come out of a containerized unit.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  You can put the container on the back.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  That's what the US put up around Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia and, as you said, these big rollout fences.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  Then you just have repair crews ready when people try to cut through them.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  The federal government already owns the 100 feet at the border.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  Almost all of the border, except in a few places with really tough topography,
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  almost all of the border already has a vehicle path that runs parallel to the border.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  If Trump doesn't, all he's got to do is cite the Constitution.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  Article 4 section 4, the President is obliged to give all of them paraphrasing
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  to ensure that all of the states have a Republican form of government,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  meaning that a state can't just vote in a tyrant and then get rid of the Constitution.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  But the President is also told that he must secure all of the states against invasion.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  Something that bugs me to no end is we always surrender on the language.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  An invasion, when we think of an invasion, we think of Normandy or Okinawa or Iwo Jima.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  This is a classic usurpation.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  As you said, in the Constitution, the President, when it comes to invasions and things on the border, is a dictator.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  That's the executive branch's main purview is the border, so he has massive power at the border.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  In history, it's not that often that you have a massive Normandy invasion.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  Much more common and much more permanent and dangerous is a demographic stealth invasion.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  The Roman Empire, this is in the late Roman Empire, I think like in the 400s,
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  the Roman Empire was taken down by refugees.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  The Visigoths were fleeing from the Huns.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  They moved into the Roman Empire.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  They were told, you can come, but don't bring your weapons.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  They brought the weapons anyway.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  And not long after that, they were attacking and sacking Rome.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  Well, let's be clear, it took a hundred years, and they put the Germans and the Visigoths in control.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  They brought them into the Roman Senate.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  They did it all, but in the end, they still sacked it and all burned it down.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  And history is repeating, you're right.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  Most of the time, it is collapsing areas, collapsing regions that cause huge migrant floods that ends up collapsing civilizations.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  Or it can be deliberate.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  In the Islamic form of conquest, they call it hijra.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  Sometimes you see it's called hijra, but hijra, they have mosques in America called the hijra mosque.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  Hijra means demographic invasion.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  We're coming to take you over.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  We're not doing it one horseback with swords this time.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  We're doing it with bringing in refugees.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  All of the women have five or six kids each raised in an insulated Islamic little enclave to be pure Islamic,
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  to not consider themselves to be American, to consider themselves pioneers of Islam.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  They're to plant the Islamic flag and spread their enclave out until Sharia rules the entire world.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  And that's what's happening?
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  That's the hijra invasion.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  That's what's happening in Europe.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  They admit it is a Islamic invasion.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  Yes, and right now, it's Honduras.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  These people are the pawns currently.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  If you read their open letter, it's all full of communist garbage talking about the collective and so forth.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  So you know who's behind this, it's an alliance right now in the world between the Islamic jihad forces
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  and the left wing.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  They don't call themselves communists anymore, but they are.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  The leftists, they together are supporting this globalist takeover of the world.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  And America is the biggest obstacle in their way.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  That's right.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  Let's look at their unbelievable globalist UN slash communist demands.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  It's right out of the central Politburo on the other side.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  See our full range at quantumharvest.net.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  It's a no brainer.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  A big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors,
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  Get the original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  Call or click 1-877-99-Berkey or bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  Hear that?
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV,
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  even when you're miles away.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  Security is a mindset, and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  FakeTV.com
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  It's been sold out for months, and now it's back.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  It's Myco ZX Plus.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  Lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed to your contract with an even bigger,
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  organic manufacturer and producer.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  Scalability.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  But now, we're able to go at 30% off to $27 instead of $39.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  50% off, because there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient, Myco ZX.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  Now, it's the other side of the equation.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  Everybody thinks about probiotics, and how great they are for your gut,
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  But more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  Yeast mold creates slime walls.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there,
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it,
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Myco ZX Plus,
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  now from the InfoWars store.

[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  Just one pill with every high protein meal
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids,
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates,
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  Use Carnivore by InfoWarsLife.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  Now, Matt Bracken originally wanted to come on about something
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  that in all his years on my show and doing his own broadcasts and things,
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  he's never said we're under this much peril,
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  and that's in the next segment.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000]  He has really been accurate in predicting other false flags
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  and other staged events and other events that they've allowed to happen
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  or fomented the atmosphere and the climate where they know statistically
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  it's going to happen.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  And then they don't let a good crisis go to waste,
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  so that's coming up in the critical next segment.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  He sent me some very important notes here that we're going to be going over,
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  and I absolutely concur with what he's saying,
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  so that's going to be coming up.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  Here is the President just 20 minutes ago speaking to reporters
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  about putting military on the border and being prepared to do it.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  Here it is.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  Mexico has got to help us at the border.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  They're not going to help us at the border.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  It's a very sad thing when you do countries.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  Mexico has got to help us at the border,
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  and a lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of Chaca,
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  and we're going to have to really see that a great chance
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  for Democrats to do it and a great, great chance,
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  but we'll have to take a look.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  But Mexico has got to help us at the border.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  They flow right through Mexico.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  They send them into the United States.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  Can't happen that way anymore.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  That's the first clip from about three hours ago.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  We've got the other clip.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  We're going to play that coming up of him talking about the military,
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  but we just read you the quote.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  But here's another clip of when we caught drugs coming across the border.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  The first time that Biggs even went down there,
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  then they even tried to break into their hotel rooms and stuff,
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  so I pulled them out.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  The Texas border with, obviously, marijuana being brought across.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  The FBI came and met with us about it and confirmed it was.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  But the issue is, you know, the types of bundles that are used.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  There may have been some cocaine as well, or heroin,
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  but that was mainly marijuana.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  The media said it was fake, that there's no drugs coming across.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  Here's that video.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  So while with it, you probably read it.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  It was in Drudge, who's great, by the way.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  Drudge is amazing.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  But the story in Drudge and Biggs Store, it's all over the placement.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  They're swimming across and big bags of stuff, drugs swimming across the river.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  Swimming right across.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  We just caught these guys coming across the border.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  They're jumping in, they just jumped in and around.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  They're coming up one, two, three, four.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000]  They have big satchels.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  And actually, the camera crew or the reporters were petrified
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  because they thought they were going to be killed
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  because they're showing this on camera.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  They were carrying bags of stuff that was drugs.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  Thank you.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help Uncripple America.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  You will be attacked for coming on, and we know you know that.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  Thank you.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  So let's get a little bit in before we get to the really big news.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  Let's get into their list of demands that I've got here in my stack.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  I mean, you talk about communism, and we'll put that on screen.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  It's linked on GrudgeReport.com, our article,
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  Going Over Their List of Demands.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  Let's go ahead and talk about those, Matt Bracken.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  Yeah, this, we are seeing already what happens
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  when a state is demographically invaded.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  California is the test case.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  It's already passed the point of no return, I would consider.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  When you get enough foreign invaders into the country
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  and they gain enough political influence,
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  they basically then will open the door
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  for all of the other invaders following behind them.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  And that's California today.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  This invasion march, the 1,200, so supposedly 1,200, it might be more,
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  they're not going to go into Arizona.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  It looks like they're going to hook a left.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  They're not walking.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  They're on buses and things like that.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  They're going to head for California border,
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  where Jerry Brown might, who knows,
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  he might put obstacles in the way of the federal government.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  It might be a kind of like almost a pre-Civil War Fort Sumter moment
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  if you have California state police ordered to hinder
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  the movement of federal forces up to the border
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  in order to allow this asylum march to march into Cali.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  I wrote this book in 2006,
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  and like a lot of my books, people at the time think
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  it's a lot of hyperbole, but this is what we're seeing right now.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  And it's not going to get better.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  Now, you show the Southwest, which is La Raza and Machia,
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  funded by the CIA and the Big Foundations,
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  teaching liberation theology in Mexico in the U.S. for 50 years.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  It's just total liberation theology, CNN on Easter,
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  published a bunch of liberation theology,
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  and you read what they say here.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  It says, open the borders to us because we are as much citizens
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  as the people of countries where we are and our travel.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  That's just classic U.N. world government stuff.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  We demand of Mexico and United States that they respect our rights
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  as refugees and our right to dignified work
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  and to be able to support our families, the statement reads.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  The second demand is that we open the borders to us
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  because we are as much citizens as you are.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  Frankly, immigration wouldn't be a hotbed political issue,
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  America, and would be the second statement was true.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  And then it goes into more of what they're demanding.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  Our mission is to provide shelter and safety
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  to migrants and refugees in transit,
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  accompanying them in their journey
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  and together demand respect for our human rights,
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  says the group's Facebook page.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  But I can't come to your country and get anything free.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  Our dream is to build solidarity bridges among peoples
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  and turn down border walls imposed by greed,
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  but not in China or North Korea or Venezuela
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  where you arrest everybody and take your property.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  In the face of this clear PR stunt orchestrated by the leftist
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  advocates, Trump has already shut down any notion
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  of letting the caravans in the US.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  Bracken, what do your gut tell you this is going to end up?
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  I think that this can work to Trump's great benefit
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  depending on how he handles it because it's such an overreach.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  Just like the Supreme Court justice coming out
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  against the Second Amendment, I think it's overreach.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  People get overconfident.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  They share their hands.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  They tip their hands too soon.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  And this is a chance, I think, for Trump
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  to put some serious force at the border
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  and then never remove it.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  He could start with the 10 miles either side
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  of where this march plans to cross,
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  put up the barrier, and just leave it and extend it from there.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  What the border patrol needs is a physical barrier,
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  whether it's a wall or a multiple fence system.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  What the Democrats and the Rhinos have done
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  over the last 20 years is keep the border wide open,
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  which forces the border patrol to defend in depth
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  going back 20, 30, 40 miles running around open desert
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  playing keystone cops.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  If you have an actual physical barrier,
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  which 90% of the border has virtually a meaningless barrier,
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  something you can step over,
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  then if there is a barrier, there's something
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  for the border patrol to stand behind and watch.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  When there's no barrier, they have to guard 20 miles
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  into the hinterland.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  It's a fool's errand.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  It's made that way.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  That's why the people that want open borders
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  always talk about technology
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  because they can put on a demonstration.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  It looks good.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  Then they can turn it off.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  A physical barrier, they can't switch off,
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  and that's why they won't allow it.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  It would work.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  That's why they don't want it.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  But wouldn't an anti-trump ditch
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  in front of barbed wire and then a road
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  and then more barbed wire behind that?
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  I mean, that's what we really need, right,
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  is to have a ditch dug in front of it.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  But you don't even need a ditch,
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  and it depends on the terrain, whether it's rock or what,
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  but you don't even need a ditch.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  Anything like that is going to take way more time.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  They can pull a wire fence off the back of a truck
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  miles per day, miles per day, and then just improve it.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  Once there's a physical barrier, multiple fence system,
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  which can be done in weeks.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  Hungary did it.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  I mean, Hungary.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  We're the United States.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  And Hungary had to because it was under a UN invasion,
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  all orchestrated by the UN, by Soros, by all of them.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  And the German government saying, come on, come on, come on.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  Come on, baby.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  We'll be right back with Matt Bracken and the big news.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  Then the Ted Nugent exclusive interview premiered.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  Stay with us.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine,
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors,
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000]  pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  Get the original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration,
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  Big Berkey, and now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  using code GCN.

[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  If you or someone you care about loves outdoor adventure,

[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000]  InfoWars Live! Rain Force Plus is our number one selling product
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000]  by Leaps and Bounds, and for a good reason.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000]  new tropics were, what were most popular, what were best,
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000]  Then we cut the price, because leading competitors
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  have five to seven times markup.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000]  We only have 150%.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  Then it helps funder operation.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  That means we've got a 25% markup, and we've got it paired
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000]  with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  Rain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  But the two go together.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  and free shipping with the combo at infohorselife.com.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  But it's got to end in a couple days,
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000]  because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000]  infohorselife.com to get your Brain Force Plus
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000]  and real red pill today.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000]  Good, brother.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  We used a lot of them and made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000]  own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots,
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000]  they've got a ton of money there.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000]  First from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000]  and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff,
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000]  just cover that up for a while,
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  but then burn you out in my experience,
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000]  goes right to the source.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.000]  Visit infohorselife.com today to secure your super male vitality
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:01.000]  and other powerful products from InfoHorselife.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000]  Let's go to Debit in Florida. Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000]  Great. Hey, thank you so much.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  Listen, I have bought your product and I got to say they're amazing.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got caveman,
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:18.000]  super male vitality, secret swell, vitamin interfusion,
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  I've got the body armor.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  Wow, thank you. You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  Are you super cynical as you like best?
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000]  I really like the vitamin interfusion, to be honest.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000]  It's amazing.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000]  That's really incredible. I drank it in the morning and I swear to you,
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000]  I felt incredible. I haven't felt sweet.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  My morning was fantastic and I love you guys.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  I love the InfoHorses crew and I just want to,
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000]  yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  who's on the fence, just buy it.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000]  We'll love it. I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000]  at infohorselife.com. It's the win-win, infohorselife.com.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:30.000]  I just talked to my lawyer during the break.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  They had other experts look at this very closely.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  This latest lawsuit against us, we filed the correction
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  under the state statute so there's no, you know,
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  expansive damages and normally they get thrown out of court
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  and we did not say the person's name in the photo
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  and we removed it within a day of it being up
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  when other sites didn't. What am I talking about?
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  Falsely accused Parkland shooter,
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  Suze Alex Jones, InfoHorses for defamation.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  The day of the shooting when nobody had Nick Cruise's photo,
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  it was all over TV, all over the press.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  This is a potential person because on the Facebook,
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  didn't have the man's name.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  We took it down within a day and we retracted it.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  But they said under state law, we didn't retract.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  Funny, we got the registered letter, we got the retraction,
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  we got the date, we got it all.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  And then they have lawyers that are highly respected
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  telling the Daily Beast, this might make for good press,
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  but it's dangerous. White continued.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  Texas has very strong anti-slap law.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  InfoHorses can frame the lawsuit as being broadly
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  about the content of a speech in general
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  or about the speech of third party commentators
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  for whom InfoHorses are not responsible
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  The plaintiff faces a real risk of anti-slap ruling.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  And that's one of the top lawyers out there.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  My lawyer is one of the top lawyers in that area as well.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  And he'll be, his name's known, but he'll be emerging
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  in a press conference very soon next week.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  I'm going to leave it at that because he's writing up
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  the press release right now for some reasons
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  that I can't announce at this point.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  But the suit also said that, again,
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  that we had never retracted. We did.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  And of course, that is Ken White,
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  First Amendment Litigator at Brown, White, and Osborne
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  said the suit could run afoul of Texas law.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  And went on to say, boy, are they telling these plaintiffs
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  that they're the ones that are going to get sued?
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  I mean, that's what I'm telling you, folks.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  I'm not just putting a good face on this.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  Every one of these lawsuits,
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  my lawyers have never seen anything like it.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  And other law firms, I've reached out now
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  to like seven different law firms
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  just to get different opinions on all these lawsuits.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  And they go, yes, we've never seen anything like these.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  We're not bragging for the rest of the hour.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  We'll have plenty of time to get in this big story.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  But as people understand, the attack on the First Amendment
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  that's happening right now is insane
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  because there'll be a 50-page filing,
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  a 70-page filing, an 80-page filing, a 20-page filing.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  And I'll just say, Alex is a white supremacist
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  and Alex hates everybody.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  And he says no one died at Parkland.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  And he said that, you know, this guy who was a photographer
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  killed the girl and set it all up.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  And then none of us ever said that.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  They don't give exhibits.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  It's the most insane defamation ever.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  But they think in court, generally this is the case,
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  that defamatory statements are protected.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  So what the media is doing is they're defaming me
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  with these lawsuits every week.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  They'll get slapped down on summary judgment,
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  but they don't care because I got to get lawyers.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  I got to look at it.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  I got to show up in court.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  I got to do it.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  And it costs money.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  But even liberal lawyers are going,
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  I wouldn't show this to some of the top liberal lawyers in Austin.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  There's some of the top of the state.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  And they said, yeah, this is really dangerous.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  And we're surprised the ACLU isn't on your side.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  We're like, well, we're talking to them.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  And they actually are going to be in some amicus briefs and things.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  That's going to be announced soon.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  But they are on our side because A,
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  we never said this stuff and B,
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  these lawsuits filed by Georgetown ends the First Amendment.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  And I love how the Daily Beast says,
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  it's unclear how infowars will defend itself
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  and they did not immediately respond.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  All these people five minutes before they publish an email comes in,
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  sometimes as it publishes and says,
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  do you want to comment to our article?
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  Because again, under lawsuit code, they have to get a comment.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  But they're not getting comments for any of these
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  because if they had got my comment,
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  I'd have said we were already retracted that
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  and we already removed it under state statute,
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  basically blocking a lawsuit.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  You can still file it, but it goes nowhere.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  There's no damages.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  They never get our quote because they don't want the quote.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  They want to just run ahead with the BS.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  So infowars is winning.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  Infowars is expanding.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  CNN is collapsing.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  MSNBC is collapsing.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  Globalism is falling apart all over the world.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  This is all to make it look like we're losing,
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  so the left thinks they're winning.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  But they see us as the number one enemy.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  I'm asked Matt Bracken why.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  Then we're getting into his big story.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  I'll have the floor for the balance of the hour.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  But that's why earlier I got into mainstream news,
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  Associated Press Daily Mail today
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  about the amazing benefits of turmeric for inflammation
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  in the body and so many other areas.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  We have the strongest curcumin and rated of any company
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  tested out there, according to the big companies
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  we went and had this produced by.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  And we have the test, all of it, a 95 curcuminoid rating.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  95% of the active chemical in body's ultimate turmeric formula,
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  95% of what's in the turmeric is the active ingredient.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  This is supercharged, concentrated in an organic process
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  that's patented.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  Anti-inflammatory support, flexibility support,
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  joint support, you name it.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  And it's 25% off.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  It's been sold out.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  It's back in stock.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  It's all there at infowarstore.com.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  We're ending the special on Brainforce and the special
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  on the real red pill that go together today.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  50% off and free shipping.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  infowarstore.com.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  But we need to sell a lot of product at these types of sales.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  So please see how great Brainforce is or stock up on it.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  And we have a new product that's going to roll out today,
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  but I've been so busy.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  I haven't gotten to it yet.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  It's amazing as well.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  I'll tell you about that a little bit later in the next hour
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  before we premiere this Ted Nugent interview.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  I have another guest joining us as well.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  Dr. Jordan Corsi is popping in.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  I probably want to keep dragging a little bit longer,
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  so let's push Corsi back 10, 15 minutes if we can.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  Then I'm going to open the phones up as well.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  But we've come out with the big containers
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  of the super blue silver solution with iodine.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  It's called technically because my dad's a dentist
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  and all that immune gargle,
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  but you can swallow this as well at the dosages that are there.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  And it's got an amazing patented type of special colloidal silver.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  And it's got the iodine and so much more.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  We're really, really proud of this.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  This will end up being, again, extremely popular.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  Nano silver, peppermint essential oil,
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  and of course iodine,
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  and of course the colloidal silver.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, the silver, the nano silver.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  So, this is amazing.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  And this is for, I mean, I use this now to gargle every day.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  And it's amazing.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or triple eight,
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  We're going to go to break and come back for three segments.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  I'm going to give Matt Bracken the absolute floor
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  to give you a presentation here
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  on what he believes is the most enormous danger
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  to the Republic and our freedom right now,
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  and that we are in the most extreme peril we've ever been in.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  And I totally agree.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  The enemy's going for broke.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  So, get ready.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  On the other side,
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  Trump just announced troops on the border.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  I haven't gotten out the tails yet.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  That's good.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  I don't want them to know exactly what's going to happen.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  But I would call out the state guard.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  I would pull the troops out of Syria, which he says he's doing,
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  and send them there because you've got these caravans coming.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  And he's absolutely right.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  They're going to try to go to California,
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  where they have a big political uprising against the military
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  and against the federal government.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  And I think that's where the troops should be deployed.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  California is ignoring federal law.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  It's telling MS-13 gang members when ISIS is coming,
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  they're in open rebellion saying resist.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  That is federal government's jurisdiction.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  If the feds want to just set up random checkpoints on a highway,
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  I say arrest them.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  Unless they've got an active shooter or a guy with a bomb
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  or something that is coming down the road,
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  then that's an emergency.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  And you've got probable cause.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  You've got suspicion.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  But the feds can do whatever they want on the border,
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  whatever they want on the border, to non-citizens.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  And that's a fact.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  And we are so nice to immigrants in this country,
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  and we're being attacked by a foreign globalist force.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  This is happening.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  This isn't rhetoric.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  And our first amendment is under attack.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  And our second amendment, so again,
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  I know that about one and a half percent of our audience
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  goes and buys products.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  And you're the folks pulling the whole wagon.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  And I love everybody else out there that spreads the link.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  You name it.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  But folks, go look at the five-star reviews.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  We have the best supplements.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  Things that really are great and will change your life.

[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  experience daytime drowsiness.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  But with the rapid speed of life,
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000]  we need to be able to keep up the pace.

[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  The antioxidants found in cell force

[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  and other free radicals.

[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  We're selling it for $2 a product in it.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  Sell it for $60.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  It's $19.95 right now.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  So you get an incredible top of the line Neutropic for $19.95.

[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  and to face the global threat of it.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  and I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it

[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  Our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  and iodine fortified toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  that's a spray you do.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  You can also swallow it.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  and a lot more.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsLife.com
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  but it's other people that aren't awake
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  And thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  I'm going to shut down the Second Amendment, the First Amendment,
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  the Tenth Amendment, the Ninth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  The Governor and many of the mayors of California are in open sedition
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  and revolt against our Republican form of government
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  and I see so many leftists even on TV going.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  Why is it a Republican form?
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  We're a Democrat too.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  Republican means we're a Republic
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  and that we have the people in charge
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  and that we have a separation of powers
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  and that there is a federalist system and there is a state system
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  and they're balanced
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  and the federal government has control of the borders
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  and when the states and the cities particularly say
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  we're going to block federal agents with warrants, arresting criminals,
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  that is sedition.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  That is go to jail. Boom.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  And it's just crazy we've gotten to this point
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  but this is the globalist and their model,
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  the same things being done in Europe.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  So Matt Bracken believes and I agree with him,
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  he's got a detailed report right here in front of me
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  that they're planning something really, really big
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  with a false flag involving David Hogg
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  that we pray for.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  We don't want anything to happen to him,
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  just like Obama that turned him into a martyr
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  and I totally agree with his analysis.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  He has predicted the other globalist events
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  and other triggered events.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  So Matt Bracken in this segment, the next and the next,
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  you've got the floor.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  I'll bring in and out of breaks but you've got the floor.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  Break this down, this emergency alert,
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  maximum danger as you send your report to me
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  that you wanted to cover.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  I totally agree and that we are now,
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  you don't like to be hysterical, you're not,
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  but you're saying this is either a false flag
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  or a guided flag.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  Explain what that means.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  Well, I wouldn't say, you know,
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  categorically I wouldn't state there is an FBI agent
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  out there who's going to do a false flag
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  assault rifle massacre.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  But when time after time after time,
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  the FBI keeps so-called dropping the ball.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  You know, you have to wonder when they know
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  that these lunatics are, you know,
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  triggered and prepared and ready to go into action,
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  somehow they don't take the call.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  You know, somehow the local law enforcement in Broward,
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  same thing.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  They had some very kind of mysterious drills,
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  shooter drills at that school that they've never had before.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  The next thing you know, they're having this massacre.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  So I'm not saying that there was a federal agent
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  pulling the trigger.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  They stand down, they stand down,
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  just like Garl and an FBI agent,
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  looked on as the jihadis pulled up,
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  he knew what they were planning and let them shoot everybody
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  or try to shoot everybody.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  He more than let them do it.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  He followed them there,
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  which would be to run interference in case they were stopped
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  for speeding or something like that
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  along the way from Arizona to Garl and Texas.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  And he had a camera.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  He was prepared to film it.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  And the working supposition that I have is that
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  he was trying to become a known,
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  famous American jihadi.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  And this video would be his cred
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  that he was going to allow a massacre to happen in Texas,
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  which would have killed the Dutch leader that he had actually left,
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  but the terrorists didn't know that,
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  but also Pam Geller and Robert Spencer of Jihad Watch
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  and other people.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  They were going to let this happen.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  You have to understand something.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  Even though federal agents and others take an oath
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  that offend the Constitution against all enemies,
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  foreign and domestic,
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  what they've really been taught in college
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  and then moving into the FBI with their entrance exam
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  is social justice.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  The Constitution to them is a joke.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  It's something that they have to work around
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  until they can just get rid of it.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  But when you hear the ends justify the means,
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  this is a communist tenet.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  They use another phrase now that means the same thing.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  By any means necessary.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  You have the goal of a socialist utopia,
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  which you have to force on people
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  because we're too stupid to realize it's for our own good.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  So they have to force this socialist utopia on us,
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  but they can't do it until they get rid of the first two amendments,
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  which they're working on very hard.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  So these social justice warrior FBI agents,
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  like the despicable creep that followed the terrorists to Garland
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  to film a massacre of Americans and foreign guests,
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  intentionally letting this happen.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  That was the plan. No question about it.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  I think that if they knew that there was a psycho
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  getting ready to fire into a concert or a stadium,
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  they might just let the phone drop and not take the call.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  Just pretend they never heard about it.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  Well, we know what happened in Broward County.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  We know what happened in San Bernardino.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  In Operation Fast and Furious itself was a massive
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  false flag operation.
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  For months before agent Brian Terry was killed,
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  for months, Holder, Hillary Clinton, and others
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  were going on the talk shows saying that,
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  oh, 90% of the weapons in Mexico that are found at murder scenes
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  came from American gun shops. It's our fault.
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  This was the false narrative that they were spinning.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  At the same time, they were pumping, you know,
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  send the automatic AKs and AR-15s into Mexico.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  No plan to track them did not inform the Mexican government,
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  which is an act of war.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000]  So a law enforcement project behind this other than
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  get Mexicans murdered with American weapons.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  So anybody that says, oh, Matt Bracken, you're a hysteric.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  Our wonderful FBI would never do anything like that.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  It wasn't just the ATF involved in Operation Fast and Furious.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  It was ATF and FBI from California to Texas.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  And let's remember Cheryl Atkinson of CBS News just to back you up.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  She got the documents that the ATF agents were saying,
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  why are we doing this?
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  They said, because we're going to blame the Second Amendment. Now, shut up.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  Right. So these social justice warrior FBI agents,
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  they've been taking their oath with their fingers crossed behind their back
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  to defend the Constitution.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  They consider the Constitution an archaic white man slavery relic,
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  and they've got to force us into their socialist utopia for our own good.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  Well, we're on to them. That's why I wrote this book 15 years ago.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  I put it on a Kindle free run today since I know I'd be on today.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  I can only do that like the day before for the next day.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  So when I get called on short notice, I can't do it.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  But today this book's free on Kindle,
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  and I hope as many people as possible viewing this can download it.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  That's the enemy in foreign and domestic by Matt Bracken.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  Right. Free on Kindle.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  That one starts in a stadium on opening day with a massacre,
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  an assault rifle massacre.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  The Patsy who was killed is a veteran who had sent threatening letters
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  to the VA and had sent a lot of crank threatening letters.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000]  So he's a perfect Patsy.
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  He's taken out of a VA hospital, killed at the scene,
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  and it's all to basically destroy the Second Amendment.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  Well, let's cut to the chase,
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  and then you'll walk over the facts.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  I've read your analysis.
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  You sent me wanting to come on about this,
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  but it's spot on.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  They are setting up the atmosphere to wind somebody up,
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  let it happen or actually do it,
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  and that the David Hogg thing and all this is just a primer
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  to then when the big attack comes,
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  and we know Vegas they stood down for as well,
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  that they're really going to push to have civil unrest
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  or move Trump.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  So kind of define what you think's coming,
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  then walk through the facts for us.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  Well, at the macro globalist level,
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  taking it above American politics,
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  it doesn't really matter to them whether we have a Second Amendment or not.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  What they would like to see is America torn apart in a bloody civil war.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  If America is involved in a civil war,
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  we won't be dealing with Korea,
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  we won't be dealing with Russia or China.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  We will be tearing ourselves up right here inside of these 48 states
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  in continental United States.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  That removes America from the world stage as a superpower.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  At the end of that civil war,
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  there may or may not be an American republic.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  There may be regions or factions.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  We may devolve into an anarchical state.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  So for the people that consider America,
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  the American republic to be the greatest obstacle
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  to their globalist, socialist, utopian vision,
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  socialists plus Islamists,
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  just having America blow itself up would be perfect.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  So it's not like, oh, Matt,
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  well, why would they want to see the First Amendment gone
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  or forget about that, rise above that,
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  just to have America detonate a hand grenade
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  and drop the hand grenade at its feet would be perfect.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  So right now, we've got an attack that's happening
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  on multiple phases, multiple lines.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  And you can see what's building in the next phase.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  And you're dead on.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  They've already launched their civil war.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  They call it a civil war.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  They've had Rob Reiner say it's a civil war.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  They said they want to overthrow the whole system.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  They want to have a program of breaking the country down
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  before rebuilding it later.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  And once we fall during this destabilization,
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  then the EU, then communist China, then the globalist,
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  they can all make their moves for global expansion
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  and total control.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  Right.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  And people say, oh, come on.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  China's never going to invade America.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  Maybe not.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  They might have their own problems.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  If America is in collapse,
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  the rest of the world will have major problems
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  at the same time.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  But the globalists don't care because they're ideological.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  They want control.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  It's their religion.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  Globalism, socialist globalism is their religion,
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  which is why they're easy allies with Islamists,
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  which is another form of totalitarianism.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  So they both have the mutual enemy of a free United States
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  of America, which they need to destroy.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  And it's happening on multiple phases.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  That's what the deep state coup is all about.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  This was the Strock and McCabe's insurance policy,
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  which if Trump won, which he did, thank God,
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  to then hamstring him like Gulliver tied down
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  by the Lilliputians, Trump doesn't have a free hand
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  because he's only an inch away from impeachment
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  if he loses the 2020 midterms or the 2018 midterms.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  But yeah, this is a very dangerous time.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  And while we're all looking at the deep state coup
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  and this invasion caravan.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  We need to look at the entire big picture of the whole globe
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  from 40,000 feet.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  Wait for the big stadium massacre or the concert massacre
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  or for somebody like David Hogg to be assassinated,
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  which would turn him into Martin Luther King plus Don.
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  The reason info wars life has five star ratings
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  on major third party sites is because I want products
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  I'm going to use for my family.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  I take this.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  My family takes this.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000]  And then it funds the operation.
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000]  But the most hardcore, truthful information
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  you're going to find anywhere.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000]  So what you find in our news is the same thing
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  If I ever forget to take them,
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  like I'm having noticeable difference.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  I don't feel good.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  that was life changing for me.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  I had a few bottles at my house
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  So obviously the super female is amazing.
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  I love it.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  The nascent iodine is essential.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  that I would suggest it's nascent iodine,
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  It's got a five star rating.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.000]  It's a win-win at infowarslife.com.
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.000]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000]  They use their schools to teach children
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000]  that their president is another Hitler.
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000]  They use their movie stars and singers
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000]  and comedy shows and award shows
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.000]  to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000]  And then they use their ex-president
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000]  to endorse the resistance.
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  All to make them march, make them protest,
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  make them scream racism and sexism
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000]  and xenophobia and homophobia
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.000]  to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports,
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000]  bully and terrorize the law-abiding
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000]  until the only option left
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  is for the police to do their jobs
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000]  and stop the madness.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:31.000]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000]  The only way we stop this,
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  the only way we save our country
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:39.000]  and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  with a clenched fist of proof.
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:57.000]  and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000]  We're going to hear some big excerpts
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000]  of the Ted Nugent exclusive interview,
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  Firestorms, when I'm calling it.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.000]  And it's the best Ted Nugent interview ever.
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000]  It's really the medicine America needs.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000]  It's up on infowars.com.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  I know you guys and gals are all awake.
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000]  Get it out to everybody, you know.
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000]  It's on infowars.com. It's free.
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  It's an hour and a half long. It's amazing.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  Inside his house, out there shooting, talking to him, his wife.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  It's in depth. It's amazing.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  It's on infowars.com.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  The Democrats have run full page ads
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  in the New York Times calling for Civil War.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  They'll overthrow the president.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  Rob Reiner has said we're in a civil war.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  You got hashtag hunt Republicans.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  You've got all the calls for violence.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  You've got Jim Carrey coming out in this photo
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  we can put up on screen if we can.
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  This new painting showing nothing but white people
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  smiling myself and Sean Hannity.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  Now how racist is that to say white people are all racist
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  and they're bad and expand that?
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000]  That's not the expanded photo.
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  Click on it. I want to show that's not the expanded either.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  It's a weird thing. I just really want it.
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  I really want to just go to that Twitter and click the image.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000]  There you go. There you go.
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  So that's it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  So I'm going to hand over the rest of this segment
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  the next to Matt Bracken who's getting into the climate,
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  the preparations, everything.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000]  The way they're building up hog, like he's God,
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  the way you can't criticize hog.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  And I agree. I've said that before Bracken
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  I wanted to bring this up.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  I've said, man, if the globalists set him up as a martyr
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  and then all the things he's pushed
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  and then we've got hog out there
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  and no one's challenged it on his own Reddit
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000]  saying that he wants to come back as a...
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  Well, that's Prince Charles and Prince Philip
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  want to come back as a virus to kill you.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  He says he wants viruses, you know, basically
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  in mosquitoes to reduce population,
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  billions of people.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  It's just a crazy globalist religion.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  So we only got a few minutes here.
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  Ten minutes to that segment for you to finish up.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  But getting into the globalist religion,
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  you're sort of getting into that.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000]  This really is their religion.
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  It's just pulled down the West, attack Christianity.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  They'll ally with anything as long as it's anti-Western.
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  It's like their little baby ducks
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  that imprinted on hating America in progress.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  Yeah, at the top of this pyramid,
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  and it goes back hundreds of years,
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  what was the guy's name?
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  I think it's Adam Weisskopf.
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  Adam Weisskopf, Engelstadt University,
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  absolutely Cecil Rhodes.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  Right, before the French Revolution,
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  the Illuminati already existed.
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  They grafted themselves into France.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  They were kicked out of Germany.
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  He came to France, started the Jacobins,
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  which were just named for a hall that they met in.
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  The Jacobins then kicked off the bloody French Revolution.
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  You know, they...
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  They contrived an artificial food shortage
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000]  using speculation
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  that they could then blame one,
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  you know, the free market system,
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  the Catholic Church, et cetera,
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  in order to spur their bloody
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  French Revolution,
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  the revolution of the guillotine,
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  you know, people's collectives,
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  the committees of public safety.
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  It's interesting, the French Revolution,
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  the people that brought out the guillotines,
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000]  they were called the Committee of Public Safety.
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  That's why we always hear we need to get rid of our firearms
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  for public safety.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  Every dictator, before they take away the firearms,
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  they say that it's in the name of public safety,
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  that the Turks disarmed the Armenians
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  before they slaughtered them,
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  that the Nazis disarmed the Jews
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  and others before they slaughtered them.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  There's a meme going around
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  that says, you know, why gun control?
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  Because armed people won't get on
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000]  boxcars voluntarily.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  You know, and that's the long game.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  You know, going back to the very beginning
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  with the Illuminati,
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  Weisskopf also considered
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  naming instead of the Illuminates,
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  he was going to name it the Hive Society,
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  where you have
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  a cast of super queen bees
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  that are going to run all the drones.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  We're the drones.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  So you have these giant brainiacs
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  that know all and see all.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000]  They're going to run society
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  for the benefit of us moron drones
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  that can't be trusted
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  to make the right decisions.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  So that's what they've always perceived
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  is that society is a hive
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  and it has to be run
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  perfectly from the top
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  by the leaders, the elite cast.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  And what they see
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  with the bitter clingers, us deplorables,
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  we're rowing the wrong way.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  They have to force us to row
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  the right way.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  We're supposed to be the drones. They're the gods.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  And so the insurers decided to make us
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000]  dumb as they can control us.
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  You're absolutely right. The Illuminati was set up
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  to enslave everybody,
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000]  the ultimate class,
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000]  but they sold to the general public as
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  working together and having no classes.
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000]  I'm so excited. The new product
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  at m4warslife.com
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000]  in a glass bottle, two month servings
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000]  filled to the brim,
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000]  filled to the absolute top,
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000]  the real red pill.
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000]  This is a heart and brain pill,
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000]  a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it,
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000]  but boy does it stimulate
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000]  because it's beyond that.
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000]  I just went off
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000]  what I saw medical doctors
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  prescribing to their patients,
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000]  but it wasn't prescription,
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000]  but they were charging people $100, $200
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000]  for the formulae.
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000]  And I came up with our own formula
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000]  working with some scientists and developers.
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  Non-GMO made right here in America
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000]  120 capsules.
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000]  And ladies and gentlemen,
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000]  you add the preglenone to it,
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000]  which is the precursor to all the hormones
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000]  that your body has to have to even
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000]  take the hormones in your glands.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000]  It is amazing.
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000]  Red pill now available
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000]  at m4warsstore.com
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:06:17.000]  and your purchase fugs the operation.
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000]  All right, Matt Bracken,
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000]  author, antiterrorism expert,
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000]  former Navy SEAL really smart guy.
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000]  He is breaking down,
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000]  and I've got this write-up he sent me
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000]  that he wanted to cover.
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000]  This 10 minutes we have,
[02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000]  just go over this because you lay it all out
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  and it absolutely would be the move I would make
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000]  if I was the globalist.
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000]  Just like we said, the season of false flags
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000]  is here right before Vegas.
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000]  The stand downs are here.
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000]  We're not saying nobody got killed.
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000]  The checks that are there
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000]  turned off, and I've talked to CIA,
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000]  FBI contacts, they say absolutely
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000]  Islamists, absolute stand down.
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000]  And these sources have been
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000]  spot on in every piece of information we've gotten.
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  And we know they're trying
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000]  to get EMPs into the Middle East.
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000]  They're firing ICBMs
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000]  in the whole Civil War between Iran
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000]  and Saudi Arabia that have
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  tried to target Riyadh.
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000]  Word is they've got smaller ICBMs
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000]  they can put EMPs on.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000]  The time we're in right now,
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000]  they're targeting LA, Riyadh,
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  and other areas
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000]  that they had uprisings planned
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000]  for an EMP to hit Israel.
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000]  I was told about that plan, and then suddenly
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000]  I did see the spontaneous uprisings
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000]  of the Palestinians, but I guess
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  whoever was planning the EMPs probably got taken out.
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000]  Matt Bracken, let's go
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000]  50,000 foot view, 100,000 foot view here.
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000]  It's not just about America,
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  but the globalist want the country taken out.
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000]  It's not even so much about taking it over.
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000]  They want it to be neutralized,
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000]  they want it to be industrialized,
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000]  and Trump's trying to bring the country back,
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000]  so how will they use a false flag
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000]  to derail things?
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000]  The way that I look at it,
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000]  the Second Amendment is not the target.
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000]  Of course, it's a preliminary target,
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000]  but it's a step.
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000]  It's an uprising mobilizer
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000]  to get their people in the streets.
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000]  To get a reaction, what they want
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000]  is a civil war, a dirty civil war
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000]  to turn America into something
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000]  in the 70s, assassinations,
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000]  IEDs,
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000]  something that's important
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000]  to realize, unlike countries
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000]  in South America and the Middle East,
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  in those countries, the elites
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000]  live in fortified
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  condo complexes, things like that,
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000]  walled complexes with great
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000]  security out to rifle range.
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  They don't leave unless they're in an SUV
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  armada,
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000]  but in the United States,
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000]  the people that run our government,
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000]  the senior executive service, the SES
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  grade, used to be nicknamed
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000]  super grades. They're above
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000]  GS-15 level. They're the generals
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  that never go away. They're the civilian
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000]  clothes-wearing generals of the
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000]  bureaucracy. They are the deep
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000]  state, the SESs.
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000]  The SESs do not live like they would
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000]  if they lived in Brazil or in
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000]  Columbia in a fortified compound.
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000]  They live in Bethesda, Chevy Chase,
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000]  False Church, Virginia,
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000]  in beautiful homes, but where you can
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  go to their driveway. If a
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  civil war kicks off in this country,
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  our elites, not just the senior
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  executive service, but corporate
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  titans, etc., their lives
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000]  will be turned upside down because
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  they don't have rifle range protection.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  This is a country, it's almost
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  a perfect storm. This is a country
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  like Switzerland where
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  a large percentage of the country
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000]  could walk into their gun safe
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  today, open their gun safe,
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  blindfolded, pull out a rifle
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  and hit a mailbox
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000]  400 yards away standing up.
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  This is hard for liberals
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  to fathom. They mistake
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  conservative
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000]  lack of reaction for weakness
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000]  that we're just weak and afraid to resist them.
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  What they're mistaking is our
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  deep Judeo-Christian
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  forbearance and tolerance.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  But there are millions of Americans
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  that right now can walk out
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  and hit a mailbox-sized target
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  400 yards away.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  Instead of running around bitching and playing
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  they're making preparations in case they have to
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  and that's the issue you're getting at is.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  But like William Benny, he was the equivalent of a two-star general
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  heading up the NSA technical division.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  There's also patriots on the inside
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  that get and understand
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  what a tenderbox this is
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  already and are trying to de-escalate things.
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  But Soros is trying to throw fuel
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  on the fire. But you're absolutely right
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  if they continue to push this
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  in the battle space, they're the ones
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  wanting a violence of a war. We're not saying that
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  we should be publicly listing
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000]  the individuals and groups
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  and the governing civilian
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  commander class
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000]  that is to blame
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  for this if they kick it off.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  We shouldn't have a dumb civil war with the cops
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  or with a bunch of brainwashed minority folks
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  or white folks.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  We should understand this was
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  a shaken-back operation and people
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  should be talking about who is the globalist
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  in my city and where do they live
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  just in case we
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  know where they're at.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  Once this kicks off
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000]  it will be almost impossible to stop
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  because the people
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  that are the big decision makers, they'll have to flee.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  It's going to be a bloodbath
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  if this happens.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  I would say that the vast majority
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  of the people that march in the feminist marches,
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  the gun control marches,
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  they're what I call
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  they're just useful idiots, well-intentioned
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  useful idiots.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  In the case of the children's crusade
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  I call them youthful idiots, well-intentioned
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  youthful idiots like David Hogg.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  He might get his wish
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  of immortality, but it will be as a martyr to
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  move away. Let's talk more about that.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000]  They're going to spin it that we want David Hogg dead, that's the last thing we want.
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  I agree it would be a good globalist
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  move for them
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  to attack.
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  Did you see the two black folks that were
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000]  connected to the army out of Texas
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000]  up in Boston caught with a bunch
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  of hand grenades and guns and they called the police
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000]  on themselves?
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  Oh my gosh, you didn't get any attention.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  Guys pulled that up for Monday
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  a group arrest with guns
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  and hand grenades in Boston. They were right over
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  the children's march, the anti-gun march
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000]  and they had hand grenades and guns
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  and all this. It got almost no attention.
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000]  They called the police on themselves, had a surveillance camera
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000]  in the hotel to see what the police would do
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  said they were secret government agents
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  but won't say what and the guy does have a DoD
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000]  handgun license
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  and all this other crazy stuff.
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  See, that got almost no attention.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  What do you think that is?
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  Well, sometimes you have these like what
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  they call red cell teams that are testing
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  security.
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  Sometimes these red cell teams can be bogus
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  or sometimes
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000]  that can be a cover in case they're discovered.
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  Oh, we were just doing a security check.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  You know, if they feel like
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  they've been compromised, their fallback
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  cover for action is, oh, we were doing
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  a private security check
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  just to show we were
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  going to put it on the media how lax the security
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  was. That's if they figure
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  that they were compromised along the way.
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  So yeah, we're in very perilous times.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  The globalists pushed on every track
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  that they can. What they're trying to do is
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  keep us too busy, you know, like playing
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  whack-a-mole.
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  Meanwhile, we're being set up for the big one
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  which will be something like a concert or a stadium
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  massacre. It will be
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000]  by globalists
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  against globalists.
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  Or they will, some right-wing lunatic
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  will be known and then
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  allowed to carry out the attack
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  because it suits their narrative.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000]  Remember, they believe the ends justify
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  the means. Like Mal said,
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000]  you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  You know, we're just a bunch
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  of dumb drones and for our own good
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  they've got to manipulate us
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  and get us running like a herd of sheep right off
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000]  a cliff. And I just want
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  people not to take
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000]  at first face value
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  if they see somebody like
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000]  a David Hogg assassinated,
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000]  you know, probably up close like Indira Gandhi
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  or Anwar Sadat.
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  But if they see that, don't accept
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  the initial explanation. It'll turn out to be
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  some, you know, right-wing militia
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  Kuk that did it and he's killed at the scene,
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000]  you know, which is like the plot
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  of this novel sort of
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000]  opens in a stadium massacre.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  But this is the kind of thing we're being geared up.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  The reason I wrote that novel is to try
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  to de-escalate the chances of
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  it ever happening by saying, look fellas,
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  it won't work because we won't believe it.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  You know, you're going to have to think of something else
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  other than an assault rifle massacre.
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  Well, after Las Vegas
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000]  and the church in Texas and so forth,
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  I'm not saying that the FBI
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  does these things. I'm saying they might
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  not exactly be pursuing them with all due diligence.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  Either that or the most
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  incompetent bunch on the history of the planet.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  Let me ask you this real quick. The Pulse Night Club,
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  Pulse Night Club, the guys' fathers,
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  FBI informants. And the other guy connected
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  to the FBI as well. Why do you think
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  they're attacking Info Wars so much
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  and are almost as obsessed with us as they are
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  Trump? What are they so scared of?
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000]  Well, you're ahead,
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000]  like me, I mean,
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000]  I can relate to this. When you're ahead
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  of the herd, you know,
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  even a lot of people in the herd will say,
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  oh, he's too far
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  out. Well, our vision might be a little
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  further ahead of the herd. They need
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  to snip us out. They need to
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  blot us out.
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  They can't steer the herd and stampede
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  that herd towards the buffalo jump
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000]  if there's somebody over here saying... Exactly.
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  They don't want us there stopping the stampede,
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000]  stopping their psychology
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000]  agenda, because they know we've derailed
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  their operations over and over again.
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  Which is easy to do. The public doesn't already buy
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  any of it. We just play on anomalies and it's game over.
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  Right. That's right.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000]  We've blown... We've been scared for a buffalo
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  jump and we're pointing out that the Indians
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000]  with the blankets are not, you know, the friends
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  of the buffaloes. I can tell you, Matt, Info Wars
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000]  itself with our audience and all our guests,
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  we've blown over 60 major globalist
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  operations. Big ones.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  Some of them billion-dollar operations. We've blown
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000]  them sky-high. Enemiesfireanddomestic.com.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  Thank you, Matt Bracken. We love you.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  We'll be right back with Dr. Jerome Corsi.

[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000]  Heart disease is on the rise
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000]  clogged arteries, high blood pressure
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000]  and high cholesterol levels may not be
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  fully detected by you. But the symptoms
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  are there. Loss of energy, blood
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000]  sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation

[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000]  introducing pollen block
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000]  we have found an extraordinary new
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000]  natural way to alleviate
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  seasonal distress symptoms including
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  promoting clear nasal and sinus
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  passageways, eye comfort
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000]  and respiratory function.
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  In the 1960s
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000]  researchers in France noticed that people
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:22.480]  its less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:25.280]  They began studying this effect in published trials,
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:28.440]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:30.760]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:33.480]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:36.080]  Polymobloc is natural and effective.
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:37.840]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:39.520]  In fact, current research has found
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:42.880]  that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:45.200]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:47.840]  and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:50.480]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.

[02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:55.560]  and grab a pack of our Polymobloc chewable tablets.
[02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:02.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:20.400]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:23.360]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:28.040]  from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:30.600]  Well, President Trump is speaking live
[02:20:30.600 --> 02:20:34.360]  with representatives, leaders of the Baltic nations,
[02:20:34.360 --> 02:20:36.120]  Hungary, you name it.
[02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:38.160]  Those countries have been classically dominated
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:40.840]  by the Austrian-Hungarian Empire,
[02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:43.760]  or they have been dominated by Russia,
[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:45.120]  and he's meeting with them.
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:47.720]  But he's also just said, he's live right now,
[02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:50.360]  but he just said, let's back up a few seconds if we can,
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:53.960]  the president just said that during the break,
[02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:55.600]  that he wants to work with Russia.
[02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:57.360]  Well, Putin knows he's meeting with them,
[02:20:57.360 --> 02:20:59.240]  and he said, listen, we want to meet right now.
[02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:03.600]  You've already met with all of these other foreign leaders
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:05.400]  that are much smaller countries than us,
[02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:06.720]  you're not meeting with us,
[02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:09.600]  you're being bullied into not having any day time.
[02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:12.040]  So this is a good thing Trump just said.
[02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:15.360]  Donald Trump has met with the enemy of Russia,
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:17.440]  collusion, it's his own Justice Department,
[02:21:17.440 --> 02:21:20.280]  so they're trying to spin all that right now.
[02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:25.000]  Let's go ahead and go to the president while he's speaking.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.320]  And you can, and I know you're nodding yes,
[02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:30.480]  because everyone agrees when they think about it.
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:32.920]  Strong energy, the United States,
[02:21:32.920 --> 02:21:37.920]  my opponent was into other forms of energy like windmills.
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:41.160]  We're very strong on energy,
[02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:44.240]  we're essentially now energy independent,
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:46.080]  we're an exporter of energy.
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:49.480]  That is not a positive for Russia,
[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:52.160]  but it's certainly a positive for the United States.
[02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:55.560]  We just passed a $700 billion military budget
[02:21:55.560 --> 02:22:00.000]  next year, $716 billion, the largest ever passed.
[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:01.960]  We are going to have a military stronger
[02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:04.440]  than we've ever had before by far.
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:09.520]  That's not exactly a great thing for Russia,
[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:11.160]  but that's the way it is.
[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:14.160]  We're gonna have the strongest military that we ever had.
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:16.360]  NATO, NATO was delinquent,
[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:18.040]  they were not paying their bills,
[02:22:18.040 --> 02:22:18.880]  they were not paying,
[02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:21.080]  a lot of states as we discussed,
[02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:24.720]  they were not paying what they should be paying.
[02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:29.080]  Since I came in, many, many billions of dollars additional
[02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:30.920]  have been paid by countries that weren't paying,
[02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:32.560]  and now they're paying.
[02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:35.200]  And they will have to pay more, frankly,
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:36.720]  they're gonna have to pay more.
[02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:40.520]  So there are many things that I've done,
[02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:43.120]  and not only the 60 diplomats,
[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:47.680]  Germany did four, France did four, we did 60.
[02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:51.000]  There's nobody been tougher on Russia,
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:52.120]  and with that being said,
[02:22:52.120 --> 02:22:55.440]  I think I could have a very good relationship
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:22:56.560]  with President Putin.
[02:22:56.560 --> 02:22:58.720]  I think it's possible I won't,
[02:22:58.720 --> 02:23:00.240]  and you will know about it.
[02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:02.360]  Believe me, this room will know about it
[02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:04.120]  before I know about it.
[02:23:04.120 --> 02:23:05.720]  It's a real possibility
[02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:07.760]  that I could have a good relationship.
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:09.120]  And remember this,
[02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:11.400]  getting along with Russia is a good thing.
[02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:14.800]  Getting along with China is a good thing.
[02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:16.440]  Getting along with other countries,
[02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:17.920]  including your three countries,
[02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:20.040]  is a good thing, not a bad thing.
[02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:23.120]  So I think I could have a very good relationship
[02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:25.760]  with Russia and with President Putin,
[02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:27.840]  and if I did, that would be a great thing,
[02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:29.640]  and there's also a great possibility
[02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:31.560]  that that won't happen.
[02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:33.360]  Who knows?
[02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:34.960]  Okay, thank you.
[02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:36.120]  Okay, another one.
[02:23:36.120 --> 02:23:37.600]  If I may, Marianne,
[02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:39.440]  I would also like to contribute a little bit
[02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:40.480]  to your first question.
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:41.640]  As I reminded you all,
[02:23:41.640 --> 02:23:43.080]  we could trust the judgment
[02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:45.600]  of United States administrations and people,
[02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:47.600]  even while we were occupied.
[02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:49.040]  We could trust your judgment
[02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:50.640]  when we regained independence
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:53.440]  and seek membership of NATO, for example.
[02:23:53.440 --> 02:23:56.600]  We could, because we are on a common foundation.
[02:23:56.600 --> 02:23:58.520]  You can walk around them all and read.
[02:23:58.520 --> 02:23:59.800]  It's all written there.
[02:23:59.800 --> 02:24:02.240]  This foundation, our compass for both,
[02:24:02.240 --> 02:24:04.600]  and therefore I trust the judgment of President Trump
[02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:06.920]  and his administration on that matter too.
[02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:10.240]  Now on your concrete question on air defense.
[02:24:10.240 --> 02:24:14.400]  Yes, we did discuss the deterrence capacity necessary
[02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:17.920]  to make sure that our deterrence is believable
[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:20.400]  to everybody who might want to question it.
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:21.800]  But you know, equal partners
[02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:23.560]  don't come to talk to each other this way,
[02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:26.520]  that I come here to Washington to ask for visa freedom,
[02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:28.480]  or I come here to ask for, let's say,
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:30.440]  may you support me for this or for that?
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:32.160]  I'll stop right there.
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:35.280]  Estonia is a NATO globalist puppet state,
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:37.400]  constantly claiming Russia's doing stuff to him
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:39.600]  and trying to start some war.
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:42.840]  Again, this is just the endlessness,
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:45.920]  and Trump has been bullied on the few failures
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:49.000]  in a not meeting with Putin,
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:50.920]  which he should have met with him.
[02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:53.000]  He should have probably met with England,
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:54.000]  probably should have met with Canada,
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.320]  he was his neighbors, Mexico,
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:57.920]  that's, you know, and then met with Russia,
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:00.920]  then China, the EU, down the line, Japan.
[02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:02.240]  Instead, we're a year and a half
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:05.840]  into the presidency almost, and never met with Putin.
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:09.000]  I mean, he's seen him at G7 and G20 events
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.320]  and shook his hand, but they're like,
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:11.880]  oh, he was sitting across the table
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:14.560]  and waved at him and said something, what was it?
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:16.680]  This idea that the president can't even talk
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:17.800]  to foreign heads of state,
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:19.840]  it's a separate branch of government.
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:22.320]  He's supposed to be talking to it.
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:25.920]  So the way they've paralyzed talking to Russia,
[02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:28.360]  I have no Russian stocks, I'm not involved in Russia,
[02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:31.520]  I'm not like Hillary getting $100 million plus from it,
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:33.800]  or Mueller on tarmacs giving him uranium,
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:34.840]  imagine if Trump had done that,
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:37.480]  they'd crucify him, they'd hang him by his toes.
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:42.480]  But Putin's watching Trump meet with these Baltic nations,
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:46.320]  some of which are good, some of which are neutral,
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:50.000]  some of which don't like us, some of which are globalists,
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.760]  some of which are EU puppets,
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:54.160]  he's like, you gotta meet with me.
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:57.440]  So Trump really is paralyzed on the optics of meeting
[02:25:57.440 --> 02:25:59.160]  with Putin, and I think he should have probably met
[02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:02.400]  with Putin first, made a big joke out of it,
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:06.120]  and said, we're about to massively increase
[02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:08.360]  our energy output, and that's gonna mess you up, Vlad,
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:10.200]  and I'm gonna beef up our military,
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:11.560]  but we wanna work with you,
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:13.000]  we're not gonna try to take over these countries
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.320]  on your border, but instead, that's not happening.
[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:18.320]  This is one I think Trump's failings, quite frankly.
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:19.640]  But doctors room, of course, he joins us,
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:20.920]  we'll talk about this in the next segment,
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:23.760]  we've got some other things, but you were the guy
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:27.200]  that first said 80% of the bots that came out of Russia,
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:28.520]  and there was a very small amount of them,
[02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:30.520]  were actually pro-Hillary, that's now all been confirmed,
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:32.440]  running protests for Michael Moore,
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:36.160]  it's really outrageous how the Democrats had been
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:38.200]  heavily selling out to anybody that would pay them,
[02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:41.080]  like a $10 whore, and had gotten some Russian money,
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:43.280]  but what is your real view on this,
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:44.440]  and how long will this go?
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:46.640]  Because Trump really is starting to
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:49.640]  provocatively build up troops on Russia's border,
[02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:52.320]  really cut things off, really push Russia around,
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:53.840]  he's sending up to China some too,
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:55.360]  but they're actually in our life,
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:58.040]  they're actually running our business, as you know.
[02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:00.040]  I just don't see the big fault with Russia,
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:02.960]  not a Russophile, I just see it as a giant red herring
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:05.040]  to the globalist threat here inside our country,
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:07.400]  that's orchestrating the caravan, the invasion,
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:08.320]  all of this crap.
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:13.120]  Well, I think Alex, it's clear that the Democrats
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:15.120]  created this whole Russian narrative,
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:18.640]  because Hillary and Putin, as I show in killing
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:20.720]  the deep state, were being paid,
[02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:23.040]  they were virtually on the payroll of Putin,
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:26.000]  and they wanted to divert attention from the money
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:29.480]  they were getting for selling military technology
[02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:33.720]  to Russia under reset, and the Uranium One deal.
[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:36.680]  I detail the bank accounts where they got the money,
[02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:40.720]  the offshore accounts where Putin was paying Hillary
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:44.640]  and Podesta, and the oligarchs,
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:47.120]  they organized crime figures that were involved.
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:50.320]  I mean, of course it's normal for us to talk,
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:51.640]  as for the President of the United States,
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:53.480]  to talk with the head of Russia,
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:55.560]  and the idea that Democrats have engaged
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:58.680]  in this reverse McCarthyism is absurd,
[02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:02.040]  it's bizarre, and Donald Trump, I think,
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:04.600]  is now proven there was no Russia collusion,
[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:06.720]  I believe Mueller's out of gas,
[02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:08.680]  and it's time for Donald Trump to normalize
[02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:11.000]  our relationships with all countries in the world,
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:11.960]  including Russia.
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:13.760]  So you agree with me that, I mean,
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:16.400]  how many months are we into the administration right now?
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:18.040]  Well, we're into the second year,
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:20.920]  and I agree with you entirely that this is,
[02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:24.760]  you know, it's beyond time, it's past time,
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:28.120]  for us to be, for Trump to be having a summit
[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:31.280]  with Putin, you know, Obama did it,
[02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:32.120]  and he knew for his time,
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:33.120]  and he promised he had greater flexibility.
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:35.720]  And it would let Trump take control of the narrative
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:37.520]  during a two or three-day summit,
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:38.960]  he could totally take control of the narrative
[02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:40.960]  and kill it all at once, he should have done it,
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:43.040]  two or three months in, he should have done it,
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:46.920]  it's crazy, I just know Trump's wrong on this.
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:48.200]  Well, the right back, ladies and gentlemen,

[02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.080]  Go ahead.
[02:29:59.080 --> 02:30:01.200]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:02.640]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do
[02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:03.600]  and being a patriot,
[02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:06.000]  and doing your best to save America,
[02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.840]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots
[02:30:07.840 --> 02:30:11.600]  to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:14.120]  And as a longtime Infowars listener,
[02:30:14.120 --> 02:30:15.600]  I want to say thanks

[02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:29.640]  And thank you so much, Alex,

[02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:40.720]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion

[02:32:00.480 --> 02:32:02.160]  by leaps and bounds and for a good reason.
[02:32:02.160 --> 02:32:03.680]  Going back about five years ago, we
[02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:06.000]  did research on what top selling duetropics were,
[02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.600]  what were most popular, what were best, what people liked.
[02:32:08.600 --> 02:32:10.560]  And we made it even stronger.
[02:32:10.560 --> 02:32:13.120]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors
[02:32:13.120 --> 02:32:15.640]  have five to seven times markup.
[02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:17.960]  We only have 150%.
[02:32:17.960 --> 02:32:19.400]  Then it helps funder operation.
[02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:22.240]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:25.520]  That means we've got a 25% markup.
[02:32:25.520 --> 02:32:29.000]  And we've got it paired with the real red pill
[02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:30.640]  that takes about seven days to kick in.
[02:32:30.640 --> 02:32:32.480]  Brainforce takes about 30 minutes.
[02:32:32.480 --> 02:32:36.000]  But the two go together, it's the mind and body challenge.
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.920]  They're both 50% off individually.
[02:32:38.920 --> 02:32:42.880]  Or together, they're 50% off and free shipping
[02:32:42.880 --> 02:32:45.480]  with the combo at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:47.360]  But it's got to end in a couple days
[02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:50.640]  because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.

[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:25.160]  That's why they're going after us.
[02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:27.080]  We're going to be back with a new video.
[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:29.160]  And we're going to be back with a new video
[02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:32.240]  because that's why they hate us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:34.080]  That's why they're going after us.
[02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:35.400]  My lawyers have looked at it.
[02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:37.080]  We've had a totally new, it's been two weeks
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:43.720]  since they did one, just fraudulent, not reality-based lawsuit.
[02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:46.200]  We retracted it.
[02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:48.200]  We took the image down.
[02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:49.560]  Everybody else had it up there.
[02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:51.880]  We did it before them of a guy that wasn't Nick Cruz.
[02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:53.280]  It was on the news, it was Nick Cruz.
[02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:55.080]  We said this is allegedly Nick Cruz.
[02:33:55.080 --> 02:33:57.400]  Didn't say the name of the guy that it was.
[02:33:57.400 --> 02:33:59.760]  From Susus saying we didn't retract, we didn't remove,
[02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:01.680]  we have it all, it was removed, retracted,
[02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:03.200]  registered mail.
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:06.600]  And then they put this big screen in the article,
[02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:09.400]  in the filing, that top lawyers have looked at it.
[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:11.240]  It's even the Daily Beast even admits it and says,
[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:12.640]  Jones can sue them for this.
[02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:16.760]  They don't have a case, but he can sue them anti-slapback.
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:22.040]  So it's just funny how they even get me licking my lip.
[02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:24.240]  Like once a year, I might lick my lip on air.
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:25.840]  They have like that freeze-framed.
[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:27.520]  It's just all like, it's like you're fighting a bunch
[02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:29.960]  of junior high students, but it takes money
[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:32.280]  to even beat fake lawsuits.
[02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:33.680]  And then I gotta do this slapback.
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:35.680]  I gotta sue these people.
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:38.040]  Just so the next person that gets induced
[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:40.120]  by the law firms to file a lawsuit
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:41.920]  that doesn't have merits knows I'm gonna have to sue them.
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:43.480]  It's like, take a lot of money.
[02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:44.800]  That's the first amendment.

[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:30.240]  Okay, Dr. Corsi, the time we have,
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:31.840]  because the Ted News interview is coming up,
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:33.000]  and then Paul Watson.
[02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:36.200]  What else is on the radar with QAnon?
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:38.240]  Trump is striking back at the deep state,
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:39.880]  saying we'll put military on the border.
[02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:43.680]  The Soros, UN-funded invasion force,
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:45.920]  like Europe, to get that first corridor through,
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:47.760]  to show them get through successfully,
[02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:49.760]  then it triggers everything.
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:51.400]  Shouldn't Trump, just under the Constitution,
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:54.800]  put the military on the border of California?
[02:37:54.800 --> 02:37:56.840]  They're involved in sedition.
[02:37:56.840 --> 02:37:57.920]  The American people are behind him,
[02:37:57.920 --> 02:37:59.240]  the Constitution's behind him,
[02:37:59.240 --> 02:38:00.200]  sovereignty's behind him,
[02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:01.800]  it's time to break the back of California
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:03.280]  on their sedition.
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:04.880]  Well, I agree, I mean,
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:09.040]  QAnon last night on a series of polls predicted
[02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:12.880]  that President Trump would put the military on the border.
[02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:15.120]  I had, in a poll, he said that there'd be
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:19.160]  a new immigration bill, that there's gonna be a wall,
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:21.880]  and military start, in other words,
[02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:24.200]  the opportunity to defend the border
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:27.480]  from this invasion from Mexico is the beginning
[02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:29.560]  of Trump's use of the military.
[02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:31.000]  Remember, QAnon's been predicting,
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:34.520]  and I've been saying, and writing about for extensively,
[02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:38.160]  that the end game here, the counter attack,
[02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:40.400]  that Trump is now beginning,
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:42.840]  which I detail in the killing of the EAP State,
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:45.440]  is gonna end up in military tribunals,
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:47.160]  has gotten up with military tribunals,
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:50.080]  that will ultimately press treason charges
[02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:53.400]  against both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:57.680]  And I see every sign, and QAnon was telegraphing it last night,
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:01.040]  that we're going to now see, this is the first use,
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:03.160]  but by no means the last use,
[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:04.800]  of the military by Donald Trump.
[02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:09.800]  Have the globalists not walked right into the trap here?
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:12.840]  Yes, entirely.
[02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:15.120]  I mean, Trump is very good at turning this around,
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:17.760]  and the other thing that QAnon last night
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:20.520]  was really applauding was the appointment
[02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:25.520]  of this John Huber from Utah as a outside prosecutor
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:30.800]  to work with the Inspector General, Michael Horowitz.
[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:34.080]  Q was pointing out some very important points,
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:35.800]  namely number one,
[02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:40.400]  Huber and Horowitz can initiate grand jury indictments
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:42.120]  and prosecutions,
[02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:46.960]  and a Huber begins with the 470 investigators
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:49.200]  that Horowitz already has working.
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:51.960]  So it gets a month long head start,
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:53.960]  and the mission is gonna be
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:55.840]  to investigate the Department of Justice
[02:39:55.840 --> 02:39:59.520]  and the FISA war and process.
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:01.720]  And I think it's gonna mean that people like
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:05.920]  even Comey had better lawyer up
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:08.400]  and better recognize on this tour,
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:10.560]  he was either lying to Congress when he said
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:14.600]  the Fusion GPS was a unauthorized
[02:40:14.600 --> 02:40:17.320]  and not able to be validated document,
[02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:21.280]  or when he used it three times to get FISA court approval
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:23.920]  to do electronic surveillance of Donald Trump's campaign,
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:25.520]  one time or the other he was lying,
[02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:27.440]  there are legal consequences of it,
[02:40:27.440 --> 02:40:30.480]  and Huber and Horowitz are on it.
[02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:32.120]  Everything Comey says on this book tour
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:33.440]  can be used against him.
[02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:37.760]  But the crazy thing is Mueller is now looking
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:42.120]  at the UAE, Saudi Arabia, looking at England,
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:43.840]  looking at all this stuff that has nothing to do
[02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:46.000]  with his purview of looking into Russia,
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:47.400]  there's nothing there.
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:51.760]  So how can he then do a drag net over the entire planet?
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:52.960]  As we know during any election,
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:55.120]  there's outside groups that are gonna pump money in.
[02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:58.240]  The Clintons, it was hundreds of times what Trump ever did,
[02:40:58.240 --> 02:40:59.760]  but they're gonna find something
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:00.680]  in their presidential campaign,
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:01.800]  not that Trump even did it.
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:05.600]  How can Mueller just have the biggest drag net in history?
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:08.960]  Well, Kenan says basically Mueller's out of gas,
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:10.840]  and I've been saying this for repeatedly.
[02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:14.000]  I mean, first of all, the only indictment against Russians
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:18.560]  are these 13 wacky Russians that posted some social media.
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:21.640]  Justice says they did not impact the election
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:22.480]  and Trump was campaign.
[02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:24.480]  And they admit that over 80% of their activity
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:26.640]  was pro-Hillary, they were just mercenaries.
[02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:30.200]  Precisely, and what Mueller's gotta worry about,
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:32.760]  and I think this, and also Rosenstein,
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:37.600]  is the cover-up they did on the uranium bribery scheme,
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:42.360]  that the Russians bribing in the uranium industry,
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:44.120]  the whistleblower William Campbell,
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:45.760]  Sure, folks know that's all coming out.
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:48.800]  So obviously Mueller's desperate.
[02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:49.760]  And Mueller is desperate.
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:54.760]  I think the, picking up Ted Malik at the airport,
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:57.840]  coming in from Boston to celebrate the holidays
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:00.120]  Easter with his wife's family,
[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:02.360]  separating him from his wife,
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:05.480]  seizing his cell phones, issuing him a subpoena.
[02:42:05.480 --> 02:42:07.520]  This is disgraceful, thug behavior.
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:11.160]  And by the way, we broke all of that.
[02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:13.040]  Three days before the media had to report it,
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:14.760]  and they gave us no credit.
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:16.440]  I mean, they admitted that you were the guy that broke it,
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:18.680]  but then didn't even say it was infowars.com.
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:19.640]  Thank you, Dr. Corsi.
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:20.960]  We'll talk to you again in the next few days.
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:21.920]  God bless.
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:22.840]  We're going to break.
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:25.000]  Thank you, amazing things happening.
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:26.240]  A bunch of the videos we shot
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:27.480]  that were just little short clips
[02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:28.640]  of the Ted Nugent interview.
[02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:32.000]  Got a million views, half million views, two million views.
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.480]  One of them has a million, 100,000 views.
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:37.640]  And that's how Ted Nugent will put it on screen for folks.
[02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:40.840]  Ted Nugent proves a shotgun is deadlier than an AR-15.
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:42.640]  But we want the big interview itself
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:43.760]  to get millions of views.
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:46.880]  And that's Firestorm, the Ted Nugent interview.
[02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:50.000]  It's posted in full at infowars.com.
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:51.720]  We're going to hear an excerpt of it straight ahead,
[02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:54.160]  but please email it out, make it go viral.
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:57.640]  We've taken thousands of years of known research
[02:42:57.640 --> 02:42:59.800]  and put it together with our own four years
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:03.120]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:04.560]  that God gave us through Mother Nature
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:05.840]  to detoxify the body.
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:07.880]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:10.720]  Toxic, metal, and chemical defense support.
[02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:12.160]  It's made in the USA.
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:14.960]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:17.720]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:19.000]  and it supports the info war.
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.120]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:23.320]  This is the formula that I personally
[02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:24.800]  have been taking for over a year.
[02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:27.960]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[02:43:27.960 --> 02:43:30.840]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:32.800]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:35.720]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:38.400]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean
[02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:40.360]  and as focused as you can be
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:43.280]  because we need you, the remnant of America,
[02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:45.640]  to reignite those brush fires the next level
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:47.640]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:49.880]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together,
[02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:50.920]  we're changing the world.
[02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:52.520]  Now it's time to change our bodies
[02:43:52.520 --> 02:43:55.080]  with Z-Shield and infowarslife.com.
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:57.440]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:43:57.440 --> 02:43:58.800]  and I make it really easy.
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:00.560]  We went out and looked at what the top
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:03.080]  new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:05.720]  for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:08.800]  And we created a stronger formula
[02:44:08.800 --> 02:44:10.640]  than some of the best selling formulas out there.
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:11.480]  It's very simple.
[02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:12.960]  We went out and looked, look, what is the top?
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:13.880]  What is the best?
[02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:15.120]  We'll just put even more product in,
[02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:15.960]  we'll make it better.
[02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:18.280]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it,
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:19.480]  sell it for 60 bucks.
[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:22.280]  We put $10 in it and sell it for 30 bucks.
[02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:24.480]  It's $19.95 right now.
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:26.640]  So you get an incredible top of the line
[02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:29.600]  new tropic for $19.95.
[02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:31.920]  Believe me, when we're selling it for $35 on average,
[02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:34.640]  we need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation
[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:35.800]  in the face of the global, the rest of it.
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:38.400]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:39.600]  coming in in two weeks.
[02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:42.800]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:45.000]  and I want people that haven't tried BrainForce
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:46.440]  to try it and find out why.
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:49.000]  It's got 6,000 plus five star reviews.
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:52.520]  It's amazing, infowarstore.com, infowarslive.com

[02:45:26.760 --> 02:45:30.320]  which influence every cell, tissue, and organ in the body.

[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:07.640]  It's the other equation in probiotics.

[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:46.680]  and remembering that it's not just you
[02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:47.520]  that's already awake,
[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:49.200]  but it's other people that aren't awake
[02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:50.920]  and it's so essential to spread the word.
[02:46:50.920 --> 02:46:52.600]  Again, thank you so much for being part
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:54.280]  of the Second American Revolution.
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:02.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:02.240 --> 02:47:04.240]  I love it.
[02:47:04.240 --> 02:47:05.240]  I love it.
[02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:06.240]  Alex Jones.
[02:47:06.240 --> 02:47:07.240]  Yeah.
[02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:10.240]  The cure to fake news.
[02:47:10.240 --> 02:47:14.240]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:16.240]  And the disease hates us.
[02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:19.240]  That's why it's after us more than anybody except Trump.
[02:47:19.240 --> 02:47:22.240]  I got to tell you, I am honored.
[02:47:22.240 --> 02:47:23.240]  I love it.
[02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:24.240]  I love it.
[02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:25.240]  I love it.
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:26.240]  Alex Jones.
[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:27.240]  Yeah.
[02:47:27.240 --> 02:47:28.240]  The cure to fake news.
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:31.240]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:32.240]  I am honored.
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:34.240]  I am really honored.
[02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:36.240]  I get mad at myself.
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:38.240]  We don't fight hard enough or drop the ball sometimes,
[02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:40.240]  but it always turns into something good.
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:41.240]  It's our hearts in the right place.
[02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:44.240]  I want to air just the first few minutes of the Ted Nugent piece.
[02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:45.240]  It's so powerful.
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:49.240]  Firestorm, the Ted Nugent interview, infowars.com.
[02:47:49.240 --> 02:47:51.240]  I was just looking up there in the last few breaks.
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:53.240]  Just a little clips of the interview we put out
[02:47:53.240 --> 02:47:56.240]  have more than 15 million views on YouTube alone.
[02:47:56.240 --> 02:47:59.240]  But of course, the big hour and a half awesome documentary
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:02.240]  will probably get like 500,000 unless you get it out to everybody.
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:05.240]  It's a weapon in the fight for the Second Amendment.
[02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:06.240]  But look at this.
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:10.240]  I was looking at Google during the break to see what they're up against
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:13.240]  and to see how they're responding to us exposing
[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:18.240]  the fact that they're anti-Easter, anti-Christian.
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:25.240]  And they've got up here John Harrison, a clockmaker.
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:26.240]  Okay, great.
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:28.240]  So they celebrate a clockmaker.
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:32.240]  They usually celebrate communists or whatever.
[02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:37.240]  And they're doodle, but they wouldn't promote any Christian holidays
[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:39.240]  like Easter or Christmas.
[02:48:39.240 --> 02:48:42.240]  And it just goes on and on from there, just like Apple.
[02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:45.240]  I mean, these people are anti-Christian for no reason.
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:47.240]  It's the Christian cultures.
[02:48:47.240 --> 02:48:49.240]  You'll have one African tribe that's Christian
[02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:52.240]  and they'll have literally 500 times the wealth of the animus tribe
[02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:55.240]  across the river who are the exact same genetic group
[02:48:55.240 --> 02:48:58.240]  but are shrinking each other's heads.
[02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:01.240]  Christianity, if really practiced according to the Bible,
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:03.240]  is what built civilization.
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:06.240]  Even if you don't believe in God, it's like,
[02:49:06.240 --> 02:49:07.240]  why is the left against it?
[02:49:07.240 --> 02:49:09.240]  Because the left wants the globalist to be God
[02:49:09.240 --> 02:49:10.240]  and it stands in the way.
[02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:11.240]  They love Christmas.
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:13.240]  Google refuses to recognize Easter.
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:15.240]  All right, enough said of that.
[02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:16.240]  Paul Watts is coming up.
[02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:18.240]  I'll introduce him with a critical announcement
[02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:23.240]  on the latest Democrat Party sloppy, false lawsuit filed against us.
[02:49:23.240 --> 02:49:24.240]  So that's coming up.
[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:26.240]  But right now, here's a little bit of Ted Nugent
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:28.240]  and the intro too.
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:30.240]  Firestorm.
[02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:59.240]  Music
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:03.240]  Dogs are running.
[02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:06.240]  Music
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:08.240]  We're at Ted Nugent's amazing Texas ranch
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:11.240]  and I feel like I'm following the white rabbit down the rabbit hole.
[02:50:11.240 --> 02:50:14.240]  There he is right up ahead of us.
[02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:15.240]  It's good to be in America.
[02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:16.240]  It's good to be in Texas.
[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:18.240]  It's good to have a second amendment
[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:21.240]  even though these bastards are trying to steal our Nantinbarth ride.
[02:50:21.240 --> 02:50:23.240]  We're gonna win with a stand-up or not and stop us.
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:26.240]  Thanks to folks like Ted Nugent and all of you out there.
[02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:29.240]  We have the right to keep and bear arms, not just the king.
[02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:30.240]  The people.
[02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:32.240]  We the people have the right to keep and bear arms.
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:33.240]  You try and take away from us.
[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:34.240]  We'll shoot you.
[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:38.240]  I'm kind of hesitant to even share this information.
[02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:40.240]  But once again, information is knowledge.
[02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:41.240]  Knowledge is power.
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:45.240]  Power is the capability of correcting law.
[02:50:45.240 --> 02:50:47.240]  I'm usually dead on the boat.
[02:50:47.240 --> 02:50:50.240]  I'm actually sweating to Ted Nugent watching.
[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:51.240]  My name is Ted Nugent.
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:54.240]  I'm entering my 70th rock and roll year of the American Dream.
[02:50:54.240 --> 02:50:56.240]  My 70th hunting season.
[02:50:56.240 --> 02:50:58.240]  I got 14 grandkids and seven wonderful kids
[02:50:58.240 --> 02:51:00.240]  and the most beautiful dangerous wife in the world.
[02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:02.240]  The greatest hunting dogs in the world.
[02:51:02.240 --> 02:51:05.240]  I have machine guns and everything I want in life.
[02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:07.240]  The best sounding band,
[02:51:07.240 --> 02:51:10.240]  the best grinding rhythm and blues rock and roll band in the world.
[02:51:10.240 --> 02:51:12.240]  We have reached critical mass
[02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:15.240]  and I'm walking every greasy gory rhythm and blues
[02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:16.240]  most out and made it up.
[02:51:16.240 --> 02:51:17.240]  Yeah!
[02:51:17.240 --> 02:51:20.240]  The people who hit me are here because I'm so happy.
[02:51:20.240 --> 02:51:23.240]  Alright folks, inside Ted Nugent's awesome ranch
[02:51:23.240 --> 02:51:26.240]  with his great wife and family, this is America.
[02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:28.240]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:51:34.240 --> 02:51:35.240]  Everybody want coffee?
[02:51:35.240 --> 02:51:36.240]  Sure, we love some.
[02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:38.240]  Alright, here's some good f***ing Nugent Java.
[02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:39.240]  And I'm not kidding.
[02:51:39.240 --> 02:51:41.240]  This isn't Tom Petty's coffee.
[02:51:43.240 --> 02:51:46.240]  My coffee is the only coffee that's holistically coefficient.
[02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:51.240]  I like this good cup of joe, man.
[02:51:51.240 --> 02:51:57.240]  News coffee brought to you by Stay On Point.
[02:51:57.240 --> 02:51:59.240]  Now take a slug of that, Jones.
[02:51:59.240 --> 02:52:00.240]  Yes, sir.
[02:52:00.240 --> 02:52:01.240]  Some serious stuff.
[02:52:01.240 --> 02:52:04.240]  Start by kissing my dead dog's left nut.
[02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:06.240]  And here's the boss.
[02:52:06.240 --> 02:52:07.240]  Man, that is rich.
[02:52:07.240 --> 02:52:08.240]  Hey, how are you?
[02:52:08.240 --> 02:52:09.240]  Hey, it's awesome to meet you.
[02:52:09.240 --> 02:52:11.240]  Talk to you for a phone, but soon to see in person.
[02:52:11.240 --> 02:52:12.240]  Yeah!
[02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:13.240]  Thanks for having us here home.
[02:52:13.240 --> 02:52:15.240]  Yeah, thanks for being here.
[02:52:15.240 --> 02:52:16.240]  Thank you.
[02:52:16.240 --> 02:52:17.240]  Glad to finally meet you.
[02:52:17.240 --> 02:52:18.240]  No, no, no.
[02:52:18.240 --> 02:52:19.240]  Boys, you're welcome.
[02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:21.240]  You're in a hospitable environment here.
[02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:23.240]  Don't give me this polite b***h.
[02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:24.240]  What's I let you on my ranch?
[02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:25.240]  You're my friends.
[02:52:26.240 --> 02:52:31.240]  And as friendly as I am, I'm prepared to kill each other.
[02:52:33.240 --> 02:52:36.240]  The most important thing we can say, if I do say so myself,
[02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:39.240]  and I just have to know what that most important thing is,
[02:52:39.240 --> 02:52:43.240]  before we get into the disaster that surrounds us,
[02:52:43.240 --> 02:52:45.240]  the dishonesty that we have.
[02:52:45.240 --> 02:52:47.240]  You should celebrate the good stuff.
[02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:52.240]  There are so many great Americans out there
[02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:55.240]  that get up early and bust their a**
[02:52:55.240 --> 02:52:57.240]  and live by the truth, logic and common sense
[02:52:57.240 --> 02:52:59.240]  that we celebrate and promote.
[02:52:59.240 --> 02:53:02.240]  It is alive and well across this country.
[02:53:02.240 --> 02:53:03.240]  And here's to them.
[02:53:03.240 --> 02:53:08.240]  At the feed mill, at the hardware store,
[02:53:08.240 --> 02:53:10.240]  at the grocery store, at the coffee shop,
[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:14.240]  at the schools, at the churches, everywhere I go.
[02:53:14.240 --> 02:53:17.240]  It's like truth, logic and common sense.
[02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:19.240]  Second Amendment absolutists,
[02:53:19.240 --> 02:53:22.240]  earning your own way, saving for a rainy day,
[02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:25.240]  giving to the needy instead of expecting Uncle Sam
[02:53:25.240 --> 02:53:26.240]  to take care of them.
[02:53:26.240 --> 02:53:28.240]  So what you and I live by is not rare.
[02:53:28.240 --> 02:53:32.240]  It is a protein ubiquity across this country.
[02:53:32.240 --> 02:53:34.240]  And they're trying to steal it because they're desperate
[02:53:34.240 --> 02:53:36.240]  and know that they've lost the culture war.
[02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:37.240]  They really have.
[02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:42.240]  And academia, media, the hell,
[02:53:42.240 --> 02:53:44.240]  the government itself in Hollywood,
[02:53:44.240 --> 02:53:50.240]  in my 70 years of clean and sober radar in my world around me,
[02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:53.240]  I watched the dumbing down of America manifest itself
[02:53:53.240 --> 02:53:56.240]  in all things liberal, Democrat, Rhino,
[02:53:56.240 --> 02:53:59.240]  anti-constitutional, infringement, oath violation
[02:53:59.240 --> 02:54:01.240]  that is running amok.
[02:54:01.240 --> 02:54:06.240]  But in spite of that, I'm living the American dream every day.
[02:54:06.240 --> 02:54:09.240]  I hunt, I fish, I shoot, I make music, I tour,
[02:54:09.240 --> 02:54:12.240]  I do charity work, I hang with working-hard,
[02:54:12.240 --> 02:54:13.240]  playing-hard Americans.
[02:54:13.240 --> 02:54:18.240]  So the positive spirit is still soaring across this country.
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:20.240]  I gotta tell you, I know you did thousands of interviews
[02:54:20.240 --> 02:54:22.240]  during the election and everybody gets credit,
[02:54:22.240 --> 02:54:24.240]  but if you hadn't worked your ass off so hard,
[02:54:24.240 --> 02:54:25.240]  I don't know the front-point got in.
[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:28.240]  I don't remember sleeping in 2016.
[02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:32.240]  What I did is I focused on the...
[02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:34.240]  they called Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,
[02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:37.240]  the reliably blue states every time they reported.
[02:54:37.240 --> 02:54:39.240]  What a nasty thing to say.
[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:42.240]  The reliably blue states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania.
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:44.240]  So I focused my attention on those three states
[02:54:44.240 --> 02:54:47.240]  and I wallpaper and carpet bomb the media
[02:54:47.240 --> 02:54:52.240]  scolding the conservatives the licensed hunters of those states,
[02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:54.240]  800,000 per state.
[02:54:54.240 --> 02:54:57.240]  And I scolded them that they didn't vote for McCain and Romney.
[02:54:57.240 --> 02:54:59.240]  You can't blame them, really,
[02:54:59.240 --> 02:55:02.240]  because McCain and Romney didn't represent anything
[02:55:02.240 --> 02:55:04.240]  that we believe in.
[02:55:04.240 --> 02:55:06.240]  But by not voting for McCain and Romney,
[02:55:06.240 --> 02:55:08.240]  they gave it to Barack Obama.
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:09.240]  They got all the judges.
[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:11.240]  Yeah, I went really nuts on them.
[02:55:11.240 --> 02:55:13.240]  And I didn't do it alone,
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:16.240]  but that was the driving force in those reliably blue hell zones
[02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:18.240]  because those states are not reliably blue.
[02:55:18.240 --> 02:55:21.240]  In fact, it's important to talk about the positive.
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:23.240]  You look at a map of America, a political map,
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:25.240]  and it's just red as can be,
[02:55:25.240 --> 02:55:29.240]  except for the little blue high-crime smudges
[02:55:29.240 --> 02:55:32.240]  of liberal Democrat insanity,
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:34.240]  where liberal Democrats have,
[02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:37.240]  literally, brainwashed people
[02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:39.240]  to think that they don't have to earn their own way
[02:55:39.240 --> 02:55:42.240]  and that self-defense is not desirable
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:44.240]  and unarmed helplessness in gun-free zones
[02:55:44.240 --> 02:55:46.240]  will somehow keep us safe.
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:47.240]  And if you think about it,
[02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:50.240]  those little cancer spots across the red-blooded map
[02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:53.240]  know that their time is running out.
[02:55:53.240 --> 02:55:54.240]  They admit that.
[02:55:54.240 --> 02:55:56.240]  My favorite thing is not that you and I
[02:55:56.240 --> 02:55:58.240]  and everybody I know agree
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:00.240]  with the magic truth in common sense.
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:03.240]  My favorite thing is watching liberals and Democrats
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:06.240]  attempt to make their points on television
[02:56:06.240 --> 02:56:09.240]  and not knowing how stupid they look.
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:12.240]  They are the masters of shooting themselves in the foot.
[02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:15.240]  So if you and I were to have a date with God,
[02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:17.240]  which, by the way, I think we do,
[02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:20.240]  and we said, God, could you design our foil?
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:22.240]  Could you design someone
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:26.240]  who could actually look so obnoxious
[02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:30.240]  and dishonest and unkempt
[02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:33.240]  to counter what we believe in?
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:34.240]  I already did.
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:35.240]  My name is Michael Moore.
[02:56:35.240 --> 02:56:36.240]  Exactly.
[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:37.240]  Nancy Pelosi.
[02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:38.240]  Or Hillary Clinton.
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:39.240]  Or Hillary Clinton.
[02:56:39.240 --> 02:56:40.240]  Or Barack Obama.
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:41.240]  Or Eric Holder.
[02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:43.240]  My favorite is, I think, the Democrats,
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:46.240]  when they put forth the Pelosi's and the Boxers
[02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:49.240]  and especially the Maxine Waters and the Sheila Jackson Lees
[02:56:49.240 --> 02:56:52.240]  that struggle to form syllables,
[02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:54.240]  I couldn't have gone to central casting
[02:56:54.240 --> 02:56:57.240]  because I thought, could you create a big dirt bag
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:56:58.240]  to represent the...
[02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:00.240]  Or the guy from Georgia that thinks islands float.
[02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:01.240]  Perfect.
[02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:02.240]  Exactly.
[02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:03.240]  Let him talk.
[02:57:03.240 --> 02:57:04.240]  Give him the microphone.
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:07.240]  My fear is that the whole island
[02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:12.240]  will become so overly populated
[02:57:12.240 --> 02:57:17.240]  that it will tip over and capsize.
[02:57:17.240 --> 02:57:18.240]  Sacred is the second amendment is.
[02:57:18.240 --> 02:57:20.240]  The first amendment is not important
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:22.240]  because we can say what we want.
[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:24.240]  It's because idiots can say what they want
[02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:27.240]  so the rest of us can go, gosh, that's an idiot.
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:29.240]  So I think we're in a good place right now.
[02:57:29.240 --> 02:57:35.240]  And I think the fact that the left is so brain dead
[02:57:35.240 --> 02:57:36.240]  and comfortably...
[02:57:36.240 --> 02:57:37.240]  I want to come back with more of this,
[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:38.240]  the full interviews on M4.
[02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:41.240]  It's a perfect video except I'm in the shot too much.
[02:57:41.240 --> 02:57:43.240]  I kept telling him, stop putting me in the shot.
[02:57:43.240 --> 02:57:45.240]  God, that pumpkin head.
[02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:49.240]  Let's go to Devin in Florida.
[02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:51.240]  Devin in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:57:51.240 --> 02:57:52.240]  Great.
[02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:53.240]  Hey, thank you so much.
[02:57:53.240 --> 02:57:56.240]  Listen, I have bought your product
[02:57:56.240 --> 02:57:57.240]  and I got to say they're amazing.
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:57:58.240]  Thank you.
[02:57:58.240 --> 02:57:59.240]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it
[02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:01.240]  because I've got caveman,
[02:58:01.240 --> 02:58:04.240]  superman vitality, secret swell,
[02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:05.240]  vitamin and infusion.
[02:58:05.240 --> 02:58:07.240]  I've got the body armor.
[02:58:07.240 --> 02:58:08.240]  Wow, thank you.
[02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:10.240]  You're the type of lesser that makes it all possible.
[02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:12.240]  Which dude for surgical does you like best?
[02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:15.240]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest.
[02:58:15.240 --> 02:58:16.240]  That's amazing.
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:17.240]  That's really incredible.
[02:58:17.240 --> 02:58:19.240]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you,
[02:58:19.240 --> 02:58:20.240]  I felt incredible.
[02:58:20.240 --> 02:58:21.240]  I haven't felt sweet.
[02:58:21.240 --> 02:58:24.240]  My morning was fantastic and I love you guys.
[02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:27.240]  I love the InfoWars through and I just want to,
[02:58:27.240 --> 02:58:30.240]  yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody
[02:58:30.240 --> 02:58:33.240]  out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[02:58:33.240 --> 02:58:34.240]  We'll love it.
[02:58:34.240 --> 02:58:36.240]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[02:58:36.240 --> 02:58:38.240]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find
[02:58:38.240 --> 02:58:40.240]  in our products at infowarslife.com.
[02:58:40.240 --> 02:58:50.240]  It's a win-win at infowarslife.com.
[02:59:10.240 --> 02:59:30.240]  It's a win-win at infowarslife.com.
[02:59:30.240 --> 02:59:52.240]  It's a win-win at infowarslife.com.
[03:00:00.240 --> 03:00:05.240]  Man, I love this Van Halen song.
[03:00:05.240 --> 03:00:10.240]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:00:10.240 --> 03:00:16.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:16.240 --> 03:00:19.240]  Love the guitar right here.
[03:00:19.240 --> 03:00:21.240]  But still, Ted News is better.
[03:00:21.240 --> 03:00:27.240]  Sorry, crank it up for a minute.
[03:00:27.240 --> 03:00:29.240]  All right, let's go back to a little bit more
[03:00:29.240 --> 03:00:30.240]  about what we're going to do.
[03:00:30.240 --> 03:00:31.240]  It's on infowars.com.
[03:00:31.240 --> 03:00:32.240]  We'll come back with Paul.
[03:00:32.240 --> 03:00:34.240]  I've had The New York Times, The Washington Post,
[03:00:34.240 --> 03:00:36.240]  all these fake news organizations call wanting a statement
[03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:38.240]  on their latest lawsuit against me.
[03:00:38.240 --> 03:00:39.240]  Let's follow your state.
[03:00:39.240 --> 03:00:40.240]  I'll give you that statement briefly.
[03:00:40.240 --> 03:00:41.240]  On the other side of the break,
[03:00:41.240 --> 03:00:43.240]  I'm not going to call you guys
[03:00:43.240 --> 03:00:45.240]  because I've sat there and tested out where I call
[03:00:45.240 --> 03:00:47.240]  like 10 of them and they don't quote you a bit.
[03:00:47.240 --> 03:00:50.240]  They just act like they've talked to you.
[03:00:50.240 --> 03:00:53.240]  They just, because I always counter them properly
[03:00:53.240 --> 03:00:55.240]  so they don't actually put the quotes in there.
[03:00:55.240 --> 03:00:58.240]  But I'll give them their statement coming up here
[03:00:58.240 --> 03:01:00.240]  in just a few minutes and Paul Watson,
[03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:02.240]  from her botanic majesties, England,
[03:01:02.240 --> 03:01:03.240]  will be joining us.
[03:01:03.240 --> 03:01:05.240]  But let's a little bit more of Ted Nugent
[03:01:05.240 --> 03:01:09.240]  and the special report on infowars.com, Firestorm,
[03:01:09.240 --> 03:01:11.240]  the Ted Nugent interview.
[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:13.240]  The first amendment is not important
[03:01:13.240 --> 03:01:15.240]  because we can say what we want.
[03:01:15.240 --> 03:01:17.240]  It's because idiots can say what they want
[03:01:17.240 --> 03:01:20.240]  so the rest of us can go, gosh, that's an idiot.
[03:01:20.240 --> 03:01:22.240]  So I think we're in a good place right now.
[03:01:22.240 --> 03:01:27.240]  And I think the fact that the left is so
[03:01:27.240 --> 03:01:31.240]  brain dead and comfortably numb with political correctness
[03:01:31.240 --> 03:01:33.240]  and fake news and dishonesty,
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:35.240]  that they're doing a better job than we are.
[03:01:35.240 --> 03:01:37.240]  No, I agree.
[03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:39.240]  Since we're here getting the second amendment,
[03:01:39.240 --> 03:01:42.240]  we're seeing right now the biggest purge online
[03:01:42.240 --> 03:01:45.240]  of conservative sites, veteran sites, gun sites,
[03:01:45.240 --> 03:01:48.240]  shooting clubs, Christian sites.
[03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:49.240]  I've never seen such a purge.
[03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:51.240]  I've been thrown off.
[03:01:51.240 --> 03:01:53.240]  I won't mention any names now
[03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:55.240]  in hopes that the negotiations can continue
[03:01:55.240 --> 03:01:59.240]  and move forward on an honest level.
[03:01:59.240 --> 03:02:03.240]  But I have been thrown out by the biggest promoters in the world
[03:02:03.240 --> 03:02:06.240]  because I'm on the board of the NRA.
[03:02:06.240 --> 03:02:09.240]  And I promise you, if I was recently arrested
[03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:11.240]  for heroin distribution,
[03:02:11.240 --> 03:02:14.240]  they would have not thrown me off exactly.
[03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:18.240]  But because I'm on the board of the Family Grassroots Organization
[03:02:18.240 --> 03:02:21.240]  of the National Rifle Association that stands for self-defense,
[03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:26.240]  I've been thrown off tens of millions of dollars in revenue.
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:29.240]  Look at all the claims that I'm a child molester,
[03:02:29.240 --> 03:02:32.240]  a draft dodger, that I diss the Native Americans.
[03:02:32.240 --> 03:02:34.240]  It's all lies.
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:36.240]  What nasty things, especially my relationship
[03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:38.240]  with the Native Americans.
[03:02:38.240 --> 03:02:41.240]  I've been invited to almost every Native American tribe
[03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:45.240]  to teach their children the native lifestyle
[03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:48.240]  of clean and sober, hands-on conservation,
[03:02:48.240 --> 03:02:53.240]  self-sufficiency, hunting, fishing, outdoor conservation,
[03:02:53.240 --> 03:02:56.240]  shared sweat lodges with their spiritual leaders.
[03:02:56.240 --> 03:03:02.240]  Since the 60s, I have been given felonious eagle feather war bonnets
[03:03:02.240 --> 03:03:05.240]  by the elders of numerous tribes
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:07.240]  because I, in my song Great White Buffalo
[03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:10.240]  and in my promotion of conservation, especially bow hunting,
[03:03:10.240 --> 03:03:13.240]  they feel a kinship, a blood brotherhood there with me.
[03:03:13.240 --> 03:03:17.240]  So meanwhile, the Native Americans and I are spiritual blood brothers,
[03:03:17.240 --> 03:03:21.240]  so the Huffington Post claims that I called him unclean vermin.
[03:03:21.240 --> 03:03:25.240]  Then some people actually fell for it.
[03:03:25.240 --> 03:03:28.240]  So you can see that as I say these things,
[03:03:28.240 --> 03:03:31.240]  as nasty and horrific and dishonest as they are,
[03:03:31.240 --> 03:03:33.240]  you notice I'm still smiling.
[03:03:33.240 --> 03:03:35.240]  It is a panicked purge because I agree with you,
[03:03:35.240 --> 03:03:38.240]  they know that culturally they've lost the soul of America.
[03:03:38.240 --> 03:03:42.240]  I mean, you go to the Rolling Stone Articles attacking UNI this week,
[03:03:42.240 --> 03:03:45.240]  they'll get one or two comments,
[03:03:45.240 --> 03:03:48.240]  your side has thousands per story, so it's mine and 50 times the traffic.
[03:03:48.240 --> 03:03:51.240]  So I'm saying, you're right, they have had a cardiac arrest,
[03:03:51.240 --> 03:03:54.240]  they're falling apart, but I don't want to underestimate their counter.
[03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:55.240]  No, no, we don't.
[03:03:55.240 --> 03:03:58.240]  It doesn't mean that we are complacent by any stretch of the matter.
[03:03:58.240 --> 03:04:00.240]  All right, folks, so full interviews up there,
[03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:03.240]  but notice the same lies we've dealt with, the same lies he's dealt with,
[03:04:03.240 --> 03:04:06.240]  but calling us Nazis, calling us all this doesn't work anymore.
[03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:11.240]  So now it's lawsuits and the lawsuits are defamation
[03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:15.240]  because you can defame in court in a court document,
[03:04:15.240 --> 03:04:17.240]  but that's then why the suits get thrown out,
[03:04:17.240 --> 03:04:18.240]  but they don't care.
[03:04:18.240 --> 03:04:23.240]  The left just wants to get the attention every time they file a fake lawsuit
[03:04:23.240 --> 03:04:26.240]  and like a simulated victory,
[03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:29.240]  like they keep calling Trump a white supremacist or a rapist, none of it's true.
[03:04:29.240 --> 03:04:32.240]  They just think if they say it enough, you'll believe it,
[03:04:32.240 --> 03:04:35.240]  and their own followers do believe it because they're losers, but not us.
[03:04:35.240 --> 03:04:39.240]  So the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the LA Times,
[03:04:39.240 --> 03:04:41.240]  I mean, there's hundreds of them calling,
[03:04:41.240 --> 03:04:43.240]  wanting me to give them a quote on this new lawsuit.
[03:04:43.240 --> 03:04:49.240]  So I will give you the quote right now on the other side,
[03:04:49.240 --> 03:04:51.240]  and then that'll be it.
[03:04:51.240 --> 03:05:20.240]  You desperate criminals.
[03:05:21.240 --> 03:05:26.240]  InflAWarsLife's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality,
[03:05:26.240 --> 03:05:29.240]  organic, and clinically studied ingredients.
[03:05:29.240 --> 03:05:33.240]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon,
[03:05:33.240 --> 03:05:39.240]  but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria
[03:05:39.240 --> 03:05:44.240]  throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.

[03:06:14.240 --> 03:06:27.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Watson's about to take over from the United Kingdom
[03:06:27.240 --> 03:06:30.240]  with huge breaking news, but I've had the Washington Post, the New York Times,
[03:06:30.240 --> 03:06:34.240]  the Chicago Tribune, the LA Times, you name it, they've all called wanting a comment.
[03:06:34.240 --> 03:06:40.240]  And I noticed that the Daily Beast and all the rest of them sent a comment yesterday
[03:06:40.240 --> 03:06:45.240]  while it was on air five minutes after they followed their stories.
[03:06:45.240 --> 03:06:49.240]  They were obviously written weeks ago.
[03:06:49.240 --> 03:06:51.240]  And the headline is from the Daily Beast,
[03:06:51.240 --> 03:06:57.240]  falsely accused Parkland shooter, Suze Alex Jones, InflAWars for defamation.
[03:06:57.240 --> 03:07:01.240]  Never said the guy's name, picked up what thousands of other news outlets did,
[03:07:01.240 --> 03:07:04.240]  saying this reportedly could be Ted Cruz.
[03:07:04.240 --> 03:07:08.240]  We said some sites are saying this is Ted Cruz.
[03:07:08.240 --> 03:07:10.240]  See, I can't even, I'm teleprompter-free,
[03:07:10.240 --> 03:07:12.240]  but then that causes derailments here occasionally.
[03:07:12.240 --> 03:07:14.240]  Nicholas Cruz.
[03:07:14.240 --> 03:07:17.240]  Now Ted Cruz will shoot me, but unintentional.
[03:07:17.240 --> 03:07:19.240]  It's just hilarious.
[03:07:19.240 --> 03:07:21.240]  And that's what happens when you're teleprompter-free.
[03:07:21.240 --> 03:07:23.240]  Folks, you'll get names wrong and things.
[03:07:23.240 --> 03:07:26.240]  That's why Paul Watson does hours of preparation before he goes live on air.
[03:07:26.240 --> 03:07:31.240]  No, but seriously, let me start back over.
[03:07:31.240 --> 03:07:34.240]  I have been asked by the New York Times, the Washington Post,
[03:07:34.240 --> 03:07:38.240]  the LA Times, hundreds of publications have called yesterday and today,
[03:07:38.240 --> 03:07:42.240]  asking for comments on the latest lawsuit that was filed yesterday,
[03:07:42.240 --> 03:07:48.240]  dealing with Nicholas Cruz, the reported shooter in the Parkland massacre
[03:07:48.240 --> 03:07:53.240]  from Valentine's Day in February of 2018.
[03:07:53.240 --> 03:08:03.240]  And the suit deals with Reddit and Facebook and Twitter and 4chan.
[03:08:03.240 --> 03:08:05.240]  Everybody's saying this is on the Facebook.
[03:08:05.240 --> 03:08:06.240]  This is on the Twitter.
[03:08:06.240 --> 03:08:09.240]  This is Nicholas Cruz, reportedly.
[03:08:09.240 --> 03:08:14.240]  And we said this is Nicholas Cruz, allegedly.
[03:08:14.240 --> 03:08:16.240]  We didn't even say the name of the guy that it was,
[03:08:16.240 --> 03:08:20.240]  but it was a gentleman wearing a hammer and sickle shirt.
[03:08:20.240 --> 03:08:25.240]  And so that night, we figured out that, no, here's the photo of Nick Cruz.
[03:08:25.240 --> 03:08:26.240]  He's a different person.
[03:08:26.240 --> 03:08:30.240]  We removed the photo and updated the site, like the New York Times does.
[03:08:30.240 --> 03:08:31.240]  CNN, you name it.
[03:08:31.240 --> 03:08:36.240]  They're updating them all the time, changing headlines.
[03:08:36.240 --> 03:08:41.240]  And then we retracted it as well within the 30-day limit under Texas statutory law
[03:08:41.240 --> 03:08:44.240]  to basically, if they did file a lawsuit, it would get thrown out.
[03:08:44.240 --> 03:08:47.240]  That didn't matter because, as my lawyers have pointed out,
[03:08:47.240 --> 03:08:51.240]  it's all a PR stunt where they say all these false things about us
[03:08:51.240 --> 03:08:54.240]  in the lawsuit that we haven't done or we haven't said,
[03:08:54.240 --> 03:08:56.240]  just like in the other lawsuits,
[03:08:56.240 --> 03:09:01.240]  that my lawyers aren't worried, will actually ever win.
[03:09:01.240 --> 03:09:02.240]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:05.240]  It's just designed to have Alex Jones associated with the term lawsuit,
[03:09:05.240 --> 03:09:07.240]  and it's really an attack on free speech.
[03:09:07.240 --> 03:09:11.240]  And a lot of top lawyers are now coming out watching this phenomenon,
[03:09:11.240 --> 03:09:13.240]  even lawyers that, you know, a lot of liberal support,
[03:09:13.240 --> 03:09:16.240]  even the Daily Beast has a lawyer saying,
[03:09:16.240 --> 03:09:19.240]  this is lawsuits against people that filed it.
[03:09:19.240 --> 03:09:22.240]  You guys are in your filing, which is very dangerous,
[03:09:22.240 --> 03:09:24.240]  saying we don't like his speech,
[03:09:24.240 --> 03:09:27.240]  and you list all these horrible things I've supposedly done.
[03:09:27.240 --> 03:09:29.240]  Most of it's not even true, but in law,
[03:09:29.240 --> 03:09:31.240]  that's not the issue, even if it was true.
[03:09:31.240 --> 03:09:33.240]  It's what I've currently done.
[03:09:33.240 --> 03:09:39.240]  So you destroy your whole argument in that process.
[03:09:39.240 --> 03:09:42.240]  I mean, if somebody sees it all over the news
[03:09:42.240 --> 03:09:44.240]  that this is purported to be a photo of the shooter,
[03:09:44.240 --> 03:09:48.240]  we say alleged, and then we take it down and say it's a mistake,
[03:09:48.240 --> 03:09:50.240]  statutorily, we don't have an issue.
[03:09:50.240 --> 03:09:53.240]  Just like I said, Ted Cruz earlier coming in, not Nick Cruz,
[03:09:53.240 --> 03:09:55.240]  wasn't on purpose, I corrected it.
[03:09:55.240 --> 03:09:57.240]  I'm not saying Ted Cruz is the shooting there.
[03:09:57.240 --> 03:09:58.240]  I'm teleprompter free.
[03:09:58.240 --> 03:10:00.240]  We've got a document cam shot, maybe.
[03:10:00.240 --> 03:10:06.240]  Over here, there's Paul Watson's over here on the TV.
[03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:07.240]  There he is.
[03:10:07.240 --> 03:10:09.240]  And then go over it.
[03:10:09.240 --> 03:10:12.240]  There's no teleprompter.
[03:10:12.240 --> 03:10:14.240]  You've got them saying Trump military border clip ready.
[03:10:14.240 --> 03:10:16.240]  We're going to play that in a minute.
[03:10:16.240 --> 03:10:19.240]  And you've got the clock and you've got some phone numbers.
[03:10:19.240 --> 03:10:20.240]  That's it.
[03:10:20.240 --> 03:10:21.240]  There is no teleprompter.
[03:10:21.240 --> 03:10:24.240]  So I'll sit here and go.
[03:10:24.240 --> 03:10:28.240]  Well, you know, we got the shooter wrong saying Ted Cruz.
[03:10:28.240 --> 03:10:33.240]  I mean, Nicholas Cruz, but it's not intentional to do harm.
[03:10:33.240 --> 03:10:34.240]  That's the standard of the law.
[03:10:34.240 --> 03:10:38.240]  You don't win those suits, but it's the harassment suits
[03:10:38.240 --> 03:10:41.240]  that are called slap suits that almost every state has passed
[03:10:41.240 --> 03:10:43.240]  laws to stop.
[03:10:43.240 --> 03:10:47.240]  And those are much bigger dollar numbers for who files them
[03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:52.240]  and the plaintiffs that sign on to them.
[03:10:52.240 --> 03:10:55.240]  And all the suits against us, our lawyers say,
[03:10:55.240 --> 03:10:57.240]  and I've kept the other counsels saying, no,
[03:10:57.240 --> 03:10:59.240]  you will win a slapback on this.
[03:10:59.240 --> 03:11:01.240]  You'll get attorney's fees and the money back,
[03:11:01.240 --> 03:11:03.240]  but we got to beat the suits first.
[03:11:03.240 --> 03:11:05.240]  Then we got a false suit.
[03:11:05.240 --> 03:11:07.240]  And so tee up the next group here.
[03:11:07.240 --> 03:11:09.240]  And even the Daily Beast in the article,
[03:11:09.240 --> 03:11:11.240]  false accused partner shooter,
[03:11:11.240 --> 03:11:13.240]  Sue's Alex Jones, they published the guy's name.
[03:11:13.240 --> 03:11:14.240]  We never did it.
[03:11:14.240 --> 03:11:15.240]  No one connections to this guy.
[03:11:15.240 --> 03:11:17.240]  We were moved at the day of we retracted.
[03:11:17.240 --> 03:11:18.240]  They say we didn't retract.
[03:11:18.240 --> 03:11:20.240]  Well, we have the register letter and the retraction
[03:11:20.240 --> 03:11:21.240]  and everything else.
[03:11:21.240 --> 03:11:24.240]  So again, it's all, it's all just not true.
[03:11:24.240 --> 03:11:27.240]  And they put in the lawsuit and the exhibits other people's
[03:11:27.240 --> 03:11:29.240]  websites and statements that aren't even our website.
[03:11:29.240 --> 03:11:32.240]  You can see it's not ours.
[03:11:32.240 --> 03:11:35.240]  And it's the sloppiness that's so scary.
[03:11:35.240 --> 03:11:40.240]  So you want a statement mainstream medium.
[03:11:40.240 --> 03:11:41.240]  You're dying.
[03:11:41.240 --> 03:11:42.240]  You've fallen apart.
[03:11:42.240 --> 03:11:44.240]  New York Times is propped up by Carlos Slim.
[03:11:44.240 --> 03:11:45.240]  The, you know, the big kingpin.
[03:11:45.240 --> 03:11:47.240]  We're just guy in Latin America.
[03:11:47.240 --> 03:11:50.240]  Washington Post is owned by Bezos lost $30 billion last year
[03:11:50.240 --> 03:11:52.240]  as the public finds out his taxpayer funded.
[03:11:52.240 --> 03:11:54.240]  You guys are on sinking ships.
[03:11:54.240 --> 03:11:57.240]  So my four bears went and fought and died and got killed
[03:11:57.240 --> 03:11:59.240]  and dropped bombs on Germany.
[03:11:59.240 --> 03:12:00.240]  So we'd be free.
[03:12:00.240 --> 03:12:03.240]  I just got to have leftist file fake lawsuits against me.
[03:12:03.240 --> 03:12:05.240]  And a few liberals try to beat me up on the street
[03:12:05.240 --> 03:12:06.240]  or dump coffee on my head.
[03:12:06.240 --> 03:12:08.240]  I'm doing just fine.
[03:12:08.240 --> 03:12:11.240]  We didn't defame anybody intentionally.
[03:12:11.240 --> 03:12:13.240]  That was the fourth thought intensity harm.
[03:12:13.240 --> 03:12:16.240]  We corrected when we found who the shooter was.
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:17.240]  We removed it.
[03:12:17.240 --> 03:12:21.240]  We, we followed the statute, but didn't stop them from filing.
[03:12:21.240 --> 03:12:38.240]  So it continues here to say Mr. White, who is a speech lawyer,
[03:12:38.240 --> 03:12:42.240]  Ken White, First Amendment litigator at Brown White
[03:12:42.240 --> 03:12:45.240]  and said the suit could run a file of Texas law.
[03:12:45.240 --> 03:12:48.240]  And the core of the suit, White told the Daily Beast,
[03:12:48.240 --> 03:12:52.240]  the problem is that the complaint buries the core wrong
[03:12:52.240 --> 03:12:56.240]  in a general attack on Info Wars and Alex Jones and their fans.
[03:12:56.240 --> 03:12:59.240]  This might make for good press, but it's dangerous.
[03:12:59.240 --> 03:13:00.240]  Oh yeah.
[03:13:00.240 --> 03:13:01.240]  You bet.
[03:13:01.240 --> 03:13:06.240]  White continued, Texas has a very strong anti-slaps suit and law.
[03:13:06.240 --> 03:13:09.240]  If Info Wars can frame the lawsuit as being more broadly
[03:13:09.240 --> 03:13:12.240]  about the content of its speech in general,
[03:13:12.240 --> 03:13:15.240]  or about the speech of a third party commenters
[03:13:15.240 --> 03:13:18.240]  for Info Wars is not responsible under section 230
[03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:20.240]  of the Communications Easy Act,
[03:13:20.240 --> 03:13:26.240]  the plaintiff faces a real risk of anti-slap ruling.
[03:13:26.240 --> 03:13:29.240]  Slap or strategic lawsuit against public participation
[03:13:29.240 --> 03:13:33.240]  refers to strategic frivolous lawsuits designed to silence
[03:13:33.240 --> 03:13:36.240]  particular categories of speech like Monsanto does.
[03:13:36.240 --> 03:13:39.240]  Different states have different types of laws on the litigation.
[03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:42.240]  Governor Rick Perry signed Texas Anti-Slap Law in 2011
[03:13:42.240 --> 03:13:44.240]  and it had the support of the American Civil Liberties Union.
[03:13:44.240 --> 03:13:48.240]  The Texas Trial Law Association, the number of free speech advocates,
[03:13:48.240 --> 03:13:52.240]  and it goes on to say, oh, they didn't immediately respond
[03:13:52.240 --> 03:13:53.240]  Info Wars.
[03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:54.240]  Yes, you want us to.
[03:13:54.240 --> 03:13:56.240]  You want to act like, again, for your own legal reasons
[03:13:56.240 --> 03:13:58.240]  that you talk to me.
[03:13:58.240 --> 03:14:01.240]  So there's my response, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:14:01.240 --> 03:14:02.240]  And you're such yellow journalists.
[03:14:02.240 --> 03:14:05.240]  You'll turn around and say, I accused Ted Cruz of me and the shooters
[03:14:05.240 --> 03:14:07.240]  just as I messed the name up, Teleprompter Free.
[03:14:07.240 --> 03:14:08.240]  That's what you do, frauds.
[03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:13.240]  But I corrected it 10 seconds later, just like we did this.
[03:14:13.240 --> 03:14:18.240]  So they just hoped to pile enough of these on that I'm like,
[03:14:18.240 --> 03:14:19.240]  I'll just care about money.
[03:14:19.240 --> 03:14:20.240]  I'm going to go away.
[03:14:20.240 --> 03:14:22.240]  I will never go away until I'm dead.
[03:14:22.240 --> 03:14:24.240]  And then my work and stuff will live on.
[03:14:24.240 --> 03:14:28.240]  So that's that.
[03:14:28.240 --> 03:14:32.240]  We have our correction clarification posted before the deadline.
[03:14:32.240 --> 03:14:33.240]  You can go read it.
[03:14:33.240 --> 03:14:35.240]  We have the screenshots and all of it.
[03:14:35.240 --> 03:14:37.240]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[03:14:37.240 --> 03:14:40.240]  But they say we didn't retract or we didn't do all that.
[03:14:40.240 --> 03:14:44.240]  So my lawyers looked at it and they said, no, it's a PR stunt.
[03:14:44.240 --> 03:14:47.240]  And they feel sorry for the plaintiff.
[03:14:47.240 --> 03:14:49.240]  I feel sorry for him.
[03:14:49.240 --> 03:14:52.240]  He poses for photos with a hammer and sickle shirt on because he thinks
[03:14:52.240 --> 03:14:54.240]  he's getting a big fat payday.
[03:14:54.240 --> 03:14:59.240]  And all he's going to get is justice because we have no other choice.
[03:14:59.240 --> 03:15:05.240]  I'm not a litigious person, but I got to let people know that when you
[03:15:05.240 --> 03:15:09.240]  shine on to sue me and it's, it's frivolous, you're going to have stuff
[03:15:09.240 --> 03:15:10.240]  come back at you.
[03:15:10.240 --> 03:15:14.240]  So I figured that out with Shabbani and I signed the non-disclosures.
[03:15:14.240 --> 03:15:18.240]  I can't get into it, but that was the first dominant fall.
[03:15:18.240 --> 03:15:27.240]  And I realized they want to just say I settled a lawsuit when let's
[03:15:27.240 --> 03:15:33.240]  just say the grass got greener after it for me.
[03:15:33.240 --> 03:15:36.240]  They just wanted me to say I was guilty with the tens of millions of
[03:15:36.240 --> 03:15:40.240]  dollars of fake advertising that could be out there that no Muslims
[03:15:40.240 --> 03:15:43.240]  ever raped anybody and no refugees ever came in.
[03:15:43.240 --> 03:15:46.240]  And Muslims are the sweetest people since cupcakes were invented.
[03:15:46.240 --> 03:15:47.240]  Please support the broadcast.

[03:15:53.240 --> 03:15:58.240]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[03:15:58.240 --> 03:16:02.240]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share
[03:16:02.240 --> 03:16:04.240]  in each other's medical expenses.
[03:16:04.240 --> 03:16:09.240]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and 347 for families.

[03:16:11.240 --> 03:16:13.240]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[03:16:13.240 --> 03:16:14.240]  See guidelines.
[03:16:14.240 --> 03:16:17.240]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[03:16:17.240 --> 03:16:19.240]  Go to libertyoncall.org.
[03:16:19.240 --> 03:16:22.240]  That's libertyoncall.org.
[03:16:22.240 --> 03:16:23.240]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:16:23.240 --> 03:16:26.240]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[03:16:26.240 --> 03:16:29.240]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals,
[03:16:29.240 --> 03:16:33.240]  BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses,
[03:16:33.240 --> 03:16:34.240]  and much more, right?
[03:16:34.240 --> 03:16:36.240]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[03:16:36.240 --> 03:16:39.240]  Get the original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.

[03:17:49.240 --> 03:17:56.240]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:17:56.240 --> 03:17:57.240]  And I make it really easy.
[03:17:57.240 --> 03:18:01.240]  We went out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy
[03:18:01.240 --> 03:18:04.240]  for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[03:18:04.240 --> 03:18:09.240]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[03:18:09.240 --> 03:18:10.240]  It's very simple.
[03:18:10.240 --> 03:18:11.240]  We went out and looked, what is the top?
[03:18:11.240 --> 03:18:12.240]  What is the best?
[03:18:12.240 --> 03:18:13.240]  We'll just put even more product in.
[03:18:13.240 --> 03:18:14.240]  We'll make it better.
[03:18:14.240 --> 03:18:20.240]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60, we put $10 in it, and sell
[03:18:20.240 --> 03:18:21.240]  it for $30.
[03:18:21.240 --> 03:18:23.240]  It's $19.95 right now.
[03:18:23.240 --> 03:18:28.240]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new tropic for $19.95.
[03:18:28.240 --> 03:18:30.240]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[03:18:30.240 --> 03:18:32.240]  We need that $15, $20.
[03:18:32.240 --> 03:18:35.240]  We make to fund this operation in the face of the globalists, the rest of it.
[03:18:35.240 --> 03:18:38.240]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[03:18:38.240 --> 03:18:41.240]  I want to shell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[03:18:41.240 --> 03:18:45.240]  And I want people that haven't tried BrainForce to try it and find out why.
[03:18:45.240 --> 03:18:48.240]  It's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews.
[03:18:48.240 --> 03:18:49.240]  It's amazing.
[03:18:49.240 --> 03:19:15.240]  It's amazing.
[03:19:15.240 --> 03:19:41.240]  It's amazing.
[03:19:41.240 --> 03:20:07.240]  It's amazing.
[03:20:07.240 --> 03:20:33.240]  It's amazing.
[03:20:33.240 --> 03:20:59.240]  It's amazing.
[03:20:59.240 --> 03:21:25.240]  It's amazing.
[03:21:25.240 --> 03:21:51.240]  It's amazing.
[03:21:51.240 --> 03:22:17.240]  It's amazing.
[03:22:17.240 --> 03:22:43.240]  It's amazing.
[03:22:43.240 --> 03:23:09.240]  It's amazing.
[03:23:09.240 --> 03:23:35.240]  It's amazing.
[03:23:35.240 --> 03:24:01.240]  It's amazing.
[03:24:01.240 --> 03:24:27.240]  It's amazing.
[03:24:27.240 --> 03:24:53.240]  It's amazing.
[03:24:53.240 --> 03:24:58.240]  So Fox News put out this article quoting my tweet, quoting my article,
[03:24:58.240 --> 03:25:01.240]  which was written earlier in the day, or in fact the day before,
[03:25:01.240 --> 03:25:06.240]  basically saying, why does Google have a doodle for every obscure,
[03:25:06.240 --> 03:25:13.240]  woke, progressive, far-left person, activist, whatever, or event imaginable,
[03:25:13.240 --> 03:25:14.240]  but not for Easter?
[03:25:14.240 --> 03:25:17.240]  Why did they have absolutely nothing?
[03:25:17.240 --> 03:25:22.240]  No doodle, no recognition for Easter Sunday or Easter Monday, the entire Easter period.
[03:25:22.240 --> 03:25:25.240]  There was nothing, absolutely nothing.
[03:25:25.240 --> 03:25:27.240]  James Woods, the actor, picked up on this.
[03:25:27.240 --> 03:25:28.240]  He retweeted my tweet.
[03:25:28.240 --> 03:25:32.240]  He said, they loathe Christians, plain and simple.
[03:25:32.240 --> 03:25:34.240]  So again, this is becoming an issue.
[03:25:34.240 --> 03:25:36.240]  We heard the James De Moor case.
[03:25:36.240 --> 03:25:39.240]  We heard the stories out there where, you know, people would literally get booed and
[03:25:39.240 --> 03:25:41.240]  heckled because they were white.
[03:25:41.240 --> 03:25:42.240]  What is the policy?
[03:25:42.240 --> 03:25:46.240]  What is the outlook of one of the biggest corporations in the world,
[03:25:46.240 --> 03:25:50.240]  one of, if not the most powerful corporation in the world?
[03:25:50.240 --> 03:25:52.240]  That's a pretty big issue.
[03:25:52.240 --> 03:25:55.240]  What their corporate philosophy is, because it reflects on the world,
[03:25:55.240 --> 03:25:59.240]  it reflects on the people who use their services, which number in the billions.
[03:25:59.240 --> 03:26:00.240]  Pretty big deal.
[03:26:00.240 --> 03:26:02.240]  Pretty big deal.
[03:26:02.240 --> 03:26:04.240]  So then we had this.
[03:26:04.240 --> 03:26:06.240]  Oh, by the way, before I get into it.
[03:26:06.240 --> 03:26:10.240]  Google has previously devoted a doodle to Yuri Kochiyama,
[03:26:10.240 --> 03:26:14.240]  a communist activist who said she admired Osama bin Laden.
[03:26:14.240 --> 03:26:16.240]  She gets a doodle.
[03:26:16.240 --> 03:26:19.240]  Easter Christians, they get nothing.
[03:26:19.240 --> 03:26:23.240]  Okay, so they'll honor communist activists who admire terrorists,
[03:26:23.240 --> 03:26:25.240]  but not Easter, not Christians.
[03:26:25.240 --> 03:26:29.240]  So then CNN's Andrew Kaczynski comes out, who by the way,
[03:26:29.240 --> 03:26:33.240]  was the guy who threatened to dox the individual who created the Trump CNN
[03:26:33.240 --> 03:26:34.240]  wrestling meme.
[03:26:34.240 --> 03:26:35.240]  He's a nice guy.
[03:26:35.240 --> 03:26:39.240]  He came out and said this, this article, which features quotes from an info wars
[03:26:39.240 --> 03:26:42.240]  editor and a pizza gate hoaxer, notes the final graph,
[03:26:42.240 --> 03:26:44.240]  notes in the final paragraph.
[03:26:44.240 --> 03:26:47.240]  Google doesn't do doodles for religious holidays.
[03:26:47.240 --> 03:26:49.240]  Embarrassing.
[03:26:49.240 --> 03:26:50.240]  Okay.
[03:26:50.240 --> 03:26:53.240]  So he's claiming that Google didn't do a doodle for Easter,
[03:26:53.240 --> 03:26:56.240]  because it never does doodles for religious holidays,
[03:26:56.240 --> 03:27:00.240]  except it did literally a month ago.
[03:27:00.240 --> 03:27:07.240]  This is a CNN reporter spinning fake news to smear Christians calling me
[03:27:07.240 --> 03:27:12.240]  embarrassing when he can't even check back one frigging month on Google's
[03:27:12.240 --> 03:27:18.240]  official website, which had a doodle for the Hindu Holy Religious Festival.
[03:27:18.240 --> 03:27:19.240]  It's called Holy.
[03:27:19.240 --> 03:27:21.240]  It's a religious festival.
[03:27:21.240 --> 03:27:22.240]  It's a Hindu festival.
[03:27:22.240 --> 03:27:24.240]  They had a doodle for it a month ago.
[03:27:24.240 --> 03:27:26.240]  It's on their own website.
[03:27:26.240 --> 03:27:28.240]  So Kaczynski, your research is terrible.
[03:27:28.240 --> 03:27:30.240]  See me after class.
[03:27:30.240 --> 03:27:33.240]  You're perpetuating fake news.
[03:27:33.240 --> 03:27:35.240]  So then someone else responded to his tweet.
[03:27:35.240 --> 03:27:38.240]  They said the Fox News article he has linked has a statement from Google
[03:27:38.240 --> 03:27:43.240]  that directly mentions the Hindu, the Holy Doodle, the Hindu Religious Festival.
[03:27:43.240 --> 03:27:45.240]  Yeah.
[03:27:45.240 --> 03:27:49.240]  And he says, how are you able to breathe consistently while being this utterly stupid?
[03:27:49.240 --> 03:27:55.240]  Well, I'm able to breathe consistently because the Holy Hindu Festival is a religious festival.
[03:27:55.240 --> 03:27:57.240]  You see, Google isn't going to tell you that.
[03:27:57.240 --> 03:28:02.240]  But if you go on the Wikipedia page for the Holy Festival, it says, quote,
[03:28:02.240 --> 03:28:05.240]  Holy is an ancient Hindu religious festival.
[03:28:05.240 --> 03:28:11.240]  You can go on a telegraph article and read about how, quote, they perform religious rituals.
[03:28:11.240 --> 03:28:13.240]  So yes, Google had a religious doodle.
[03:28:13.240 --> 03:28:17.240]  That is a religious festival on their homepage a month ago.
[03:28:17.240 --> 03:28:19.240]  CNN is lying about it.
[03:28:19.240 --> 03:28:21.240]  Kaczynski is lying about it.
[03:28:21.240 --> 03:28:23.240]  All these brainwashed followers of his are lying about it.
[03:28:23.240 --> 03:28:27.240]  And yes, it's important because Google is one of the biggest corporations in the world.
[03:28:27.240 --> 03:28:29.240]  They have vast influence.
[03:28:29.240 --> 03:28:31.240]  They're corporate philosophy.
[03:28:31.240 --> 03:28:33.240]  How they look at Christians.
[03:28:33.240 --> 03:28:35.240]  It is of importance.
[03:28:35.240 --> 03:28:37.240]  So yes, of course, it's of importance.
[03:28:37.240 --> 03:28:42.240]  What's on their homepage during one of the biggest Christian religious festivals on the calendar.
[03:28:42.240 --> 03:28:44.240]  So yes, it matters.
[03:28:44.240 --> 03:28:48.240]  We'll be back on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show info wars dot com.
[03:28:48.240 --> 03:29:04.240]  We'll be back on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show info wars dot com.
[03:29:19.240 --> 03:29:28.240]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.

[03:29:49.240 --> 03:29:53.240]  That's libertyoncall.org.
[03:29:53.240 --> 03:29:56.240]  I want to plow into all of this.
[03:29:56.240 --> 03:30:02.240]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that.
[03:30:02.240 --> 03:30:11.240]  When you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com.
[03:30:11.240 --> 03:30:13.240]  You are funding the revolution.
[03:30:13.240 --> 03:30:15.240]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear.
[03:30:15.240 --> 03:30:19.240]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[03:30:19.240 --> 03:30:27.240]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[03:30:27.240 --> 03:30:29.240]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[03:30:29.240 --> 03:30:32.240]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[03:30:32.240 --> 03:30:34.240]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[03:30:34.240 --> 03:30:39.240]  Infowarslife.com or triple-A2533139.
[03:30:39.240 --> 03:30:46.240]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[03:30:46.240 --> 03:30:49.240]  And that's who they are and they know we know who they are.
[03:30:49.240 --> 03:31:11.240]  And they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[03:31:11.240 --> 03:31:20.240]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:31:20.240 --> 03:31:31.240]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:31:31.240 --> 03:31:45.240]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:31:45.240 --> 03:31:48.240]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:31:48.240 --> 03:31:53.240]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[03:31:53.240 --> 03:32:01.240]  InfoWarslife is launching its newest product. We're really, really proud of it. It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[03:32:36.240 --> 03:32:44.240]  Bodies sold out in a month. Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with. It's sold out for another month and a half.
[03:32:44.240 --> 03:33:07.240]  We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out. And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber. Get yours today at InfoWarslife.com.
[03:33:14.240 --> 03:33:23.240]  Here is the big video I promised it went up about an hour ago. Huge important video. Please share it. This is the truth about social media. Let's roll it.
[03:33:23.240 --> 03:33:35.240]  Weren't we all a lot happier before social media existed? Is social media stripping us of our basic humanity, stunting our intellect, making us depressed, and irreparably damaging personal relationships?
[03:33:35.240 --> 03:33:45.240]  One of Facebook's earliest executives dropped a bombshell when he admitted that social media was programming its users and destroying the fabric of society.
[03:33:45.240 --> 03:33:56.240]  I feel tremendous guilt. It literally is a point now where I think we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works. That is truly where we are.
[03:33:56.240 --> 03:34:06.240]  Your behaviors, you don't realize it, but you are being programmed. It was unintentional, but now you've got to decide how much you're willing to give up.
[03:34:06.240 --> 03:34:15.240]  Social media was designed to be addictive. It provides the same kind of dopamine hit that you get from smoking, drinking, alcohol, or gambling.
[03:34:15.240 --> 03:34:26.240]  We know that engagement with social media and our cell phones releases a chemical called dopamine. That's why when you get a text, it feels good.
[03:34:26.240 --> 03:34:34.240]  We've all had it where you're feeling a little bit down or feeling a bit lonely, and so you send out 10 texts to 10 friends, high, high, high, high, high.
[03:34:34.240 --> 03:34:45.240]  Because it feels good when you get a response, right? It's why we count the likes. It's why we go back 10 times to see if my Instagram is growing slower.
[03:34:45.240 --> 03:34:52.240]  Did I do something wrong? Did they not like me anymore? The trauma for young kids to be unfriended, right?
[03:34:52.240 --> 03:34:58.240]  Because we know when you get it, you get hit with dopamine, which feels good. It's why we like it. It's why we keep going back to it.
[03:34:58.240 --> 03:35:07.240]  It is the exact same chemical that makes us feel good when we smoke, when we drink, and when we gamble. In other words, it's highly, highly addictive.
[03:35:07.240 --> 03:35:13.240]  We're so addicted. Our brains sometimes fall as into thinking a dopamine hit is imminent when it isn't.
[03:35:13.240 --> 03:35:16.240]  I'm talking about phantom vibration syndrome.
[03:35:16.240 --> 03:35:23.240]  This means those people think the phone is vibrating when it's really not, and psychologists say these fake phone couples are all in your head.
[03:35:23.240 --> 03:35:32.240]  Those who are big-time talkers on the phone or who use the phone to text or tweet a lot, well, they say they feel these fake phone calls more often.
[03:35:32.240 --> 03:35:34.240]  And so do people who are anxious or insecure.
[03:35:34.240 --> 03:35:43.240]  Next time you're in a car driving down a busy street, look out the window. Notice how many young people have their heads buried in their phones.
[03:35:43.240 --> 03:35:52.240]  Even in an environment where there are potential threats, obstacles, and things of interest to observe and absorb, they still can't tear themselves away.
[03:35:52.240 --> 03:35:59.240]  This addiction has overridden their basic survival mechanism of being aware of their surroundings in an open environment.
[03:35:59.240 --> 03:36:02.240]  That's how addicted they are.
[03:36:03.240 --> 03:36:05.240]  I mean, look at the one on the right.
[03:36:05.240 --> 03:36:07.240]  Do you have to make faces when you take selfies?
[03:36:07.240 --> 03:36:09.240]  Wait, one more now.
[03:36:10.240 --> 03:36:11.240]  Better angle.
[03:36:13.240 --> 03:36:14.240]  Oh, check it. That come on okay.
[03:36:14.240 --> 03:36:17.240]  That's the best one of the 300 pictures I've taken of myself today.
[03:36:17.240 --> 03:36:20.240]  Every girl in the picture is locked into her phone.
[03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:26.240]  Every single one is dialed in. Welcome to parenting in 2015.
[03:36:26.240 --> 03:36:30.240]  They're all just completely transfixed by the technology.
[03:36:30.240 --> 03:36:34.240]  Why are millennials particularly vulnerable to social media addiction?
[03:36:34.240 --> 03:36:41.240]  Because their parents and daycare instilled in them an endless, desperate compulsion for validation.
[03:36:41.240 --> 03:36:43.240]  This is the me, me, me generation.
[03:36:43.240 --> 03:36:47.240]  This is the generation with the lowest self-esteem ever.
[03:36:47.240 --> 03:36:51.240]  Hence the constant need for reassurance that they exist.
[03:36:51.240 --> 03:36:54.240]  What fulfills that need? Social media.
[03:36:54.240 --> 03:37:03.240]  This is a generation whose natural coping mechanisms are so eroded, they've adopted rampant narcissism as a form of stress relief.
[03:37:03.240 --> 03:37:05.240]  Where is that narcissism most rewarded?
[03:37:05.240 --> 03:37:07.240]  You guessed it. Social media.
[03:37:07.240 --> 03:37:12.240]  Likes, shares and retweets are to a millennial what a pacifier is to a baby.
[03:37:12.240 --> 03:37:17.240]  It's literally infantilizing our brains. It's regressing us back to infanthood.
[03:37:17.240 --> 03:37:21.240]  And what's another trait of infanthood? Short attention spans.
[03:37:21.240 --> 03:37:24.240]  Our attention spans have been decimated by social media.
[03:37:24.240 --> 03:37:28.240]  We're kept in a perpetual state of distraction and disruption.
[03:37:28.240 --> 03:37:35.240]  This constant influx of new information prevents our brains from being able to process that info and send it into long-term memory.
[03:37:35.240 --> 03:37:39.240]  Do you ever wonder why your memory seems so much worse than it used to be?
[03:37:39.240 --> 03:37:46.240]  If you're constantly distracted by new information, you can't devote the required attentiveness to any one subject.
[03:37:46.240 --> 03:37:49.240]  So everything is just a superficial snapshot.
[03:37:49.240 --> 03:37:54.240]  Some of you probably got distracted 30 seconds into this video and started reading the comments.
[03:37:54.240 --> 03:37:58.240]  Our brains adapt physically to our changing environment.
[03:37:58.240 --> 03:38:00.240]  This is called neuroplasticity.
[03:38:00.240 --> 03:38:06.240]  Social media and the internet in general has rewired our brains to make us only capable of shallow thinking.
[03:38:06.240 --> 03:38:15.240]  Studies also show that the more distracted you are, the more difficult it is to feel empathy, another casualty of social media.
[03:38:15.240 --> 03:38:24.240]  Social media also causes depression because people are seeing the carefully curated highlight reels of other people's amazingly interesting lives.
[03:38:24.240 --> 03:38:28.240]  And feeling inadequate and lonely when they compare it to their own.
[03:38:28.240 --> 03:38:35.240]  An added irony is that while millennials use social media to alleviate their stress, it's actually causing them more stress.
[03:38:35.240 --> 03:38:43.240]  The University of Queensland study found that quitting Facebook for just five days led to a noticeable drop in cortisol levels.
[03:38:43.240 --> 03:38:51.240]  Social media can also be blamed for the obsession with identity politics that's tearing apart the fabric of civil discourse.
[03:38:51.240 --> 03:38:54.240]  Real-world experience forms rounded characters.
[03:38:54.240 --> 03:38:58.240]  Social media draws us away from the real world.
[03:38:58.240 --> 03:39:04.240]  This vacuum of real-world experience causes confusion and identity crisis.
[03:39:04.240 --> 03:39:06.240]  Hence, 75 different genders.
[03:39:06.240 --> 03:39:14.240]  There's even a link between the rise in smartphone and social media use and the emergence of college campus snowflakes.
[03:39:14.240 --> 03:39:23.240]  It short circuits the brain and we're starting to find that it has actual cognitive consequences, one of them being this sort of pervasive background home of anxiety.
[03:39:23.240 --> 03:39:27.240]  Now the canary in the coal mine for this issue is actually college campuses.
[03:39:27.240 --> 03:39:32.240]  If you talk to mental health experts on college campuses, they'll tell you.
[03:39:32.240 --> 03:39:41.240]  Along with the rise of ubiquitous smartphone use and social media use among the students on the campus came an explosion of anxiety-related disorders.
[03:39:41.240 --> 03:39:50.240]  Students who are bathed in this constant background home of anxiety are so emotionally brittle, they're triggered by anything.
[03:39:50.240 --> 03:39:54.240]  The positives of social media? Well, everyone has a voice.
[03:39:54.240 --> 03:40:05.240]  And while in principle this allows for the democratization of information, in practice it equates to billions of retogs sharing pictures of their food and hurling vial insults at strangers for having the wrong opinion.
[03:40:05.240 --> 03:40:13.240]  It equates to maniacal witch-hunt mobs destroying people's reputations and careers because they said something deemed offensive.
[03:40:13.240 --> 03:40:22.240]  And yes, I'm painfully aware of the irony of someone who has forged an identity partly thanks to social media lecturing you about how terrible social media is.
[03:40:22.240 --> 03:40:26.240]  But this is as much an instructional video for me as it is for you. We're all addicts.
[03:40:26.240 --> 03:40:32.240]  We need to modify our behavior before it modifies us permanently.
[03:40:32.240 --> 03:40:35.240]  We have to escape this electronic ghetto.
[03:40:35.240 --> 03:40:37.240]  Here's a few things we can all do now.
[03:40:37.240 --> 03:40:40.240]  Turn off all non-essential notifications on your phone.
[03:40:40.240 --> 03:40:48.240]  Try and make a routine of only checking your messages and emails a maximum of five times a day, less if possible.
[03:40:48.240 --> 03:40:50.240]  Use the internet like your parents use the internet.
[03:40:50.240 --> 03:40:53.240]  Go on there to do what you intend to do, then get off.
[03:40:53.240 --> 03:40:56.240]  Don't get distracted by a hundred different strands.
[03:40:56.240 --> 03:40:58.240]  Don't surf the web.
[03:40:58.240 --> 03:40:59.240]  Try and be disciplined.
[03:40:59.240 --> 03:41:02.240]  Respect the value of your own time.
[03:41:02.240 --> 03:41:04.240]  Don't charge your phone next to your bed.
[03:41:04.240 --> 03:41:09.240]  Don't be pressured to check all the messages on all your accounts as soon as you wake up.
[03:41:09.240 --> 03:41:13.240]  Leave your phone in a different room to the one you're in at every opportunity.
[03:41:13.240 --> 03:41:18.240]  And if it's not absolutely essential for your career, just get off social media entirely.
[03:41:18.240 --> 03:41:24.240]  There's no point in being a public figure if you don't get any of the benefits of being a public figure.
[03:41:24.240 --> 03:41:32.240]  If you implement these changes and I've got to implement them too, you'll be far happier, more productive and a better person to be around.
[03:41:32.240 --> 03:41:38.240]  You'll be free of the background hum of anxiety and depression that social media perpetuates.
[03:41:38.240 --> 03:41:42.240]  2018 is being described by some as the year of the Neoludite.
[03:41:42.240 --> 03:41:46.240]  An underground backlash against technology is brewing.
[03:41:46.240 --> 03:41:52.240]  More people than ever are beginning to feel that technological progress is not always beneficial.
[03:41:52.240 --> 03:41:55.240]  Violent anti-tech attacks are increasing.
[03:41:55.240 --> 03:41:59.240]  According to American philosopher John Zazan, something is going on.
[03:41:59.240 --> 03:42:06.240]  Zazan was a controversial supporter of the ideology of Ted Kaczynski, the unibomber, although he condemned his actions.
[03:42:06.240 --> 03:42:14.240]  Kaczynski thought technological change had destabilized society, made life unfulfilling, and caused massive psychological suffering.
[03:42:14.240 --> 03:42:21.240]  While Kaczynski's response was deplorable, you'd be hard-pressed to deny that some of his fears have been realized.
[03:42:21.240 --> 03:42:26.240]  Professor Zazan thinks the emergence of another unibomber is inevitable.
[03:42:26.240 --> 03:42:31.240]  Others even fear the rise of Luddite terror groups to rival Islamic jihadists.
[03:42:31.240 --> 03:42:40.240]  But before we allow fringe extremists to fill the void, we need to reassert control over our impulses, our emotions, and the very structure of our brains.
[03:42:40.240 --> 03:42:49.240]  Social media is turning us into addicts, and it's time to change our habits before we all become hopeless junkies.
[03:43:10.240 --> 03:43:13.240]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:43:13.240 --> 03:43:17.240]  Cardivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:43:17.240 --> 03:43:20.240]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[03:43:20.240 --> 03:43:27.240]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[03:43:27.240 --> 03:43:35.240]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:43:35.240 --> 03:43:42.240]  Cardivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[03:43:42.240 --> 03:43:46.240]  Don't let a meal go to waste. Use carnivore by InfoWarsLife.
[03:43:46.240 --> 03:44:06.240]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now. That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:44:16.240 --> 03:44:20.240]  It's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids, so you can upload it.
[03:44:20.240 --> 03:44:29.240]  Our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine 4-5 toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[03:44:29.240 --> 03:44:31.240]  That's a spray you do. You can also swallow it.
[03:44:31.240 --> 03:44:36.240]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high-quality silver, and a lot more.
[03:44:36.240 --> 03:44:38.240]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[03:44:38.240 --> 03:44:44.240]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsLife.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake,
[03:44:44.240 --> 03:44:48.240]  but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[03:44:48.240 --> 03:45:15.240]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:45:18.240 --> 03:45:24.240]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans.
[03:45:24.240 --> 03:45:29.240]  The super blue is awesome, and thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWarsLife products.
[03:45:29.240 --> 03:45:35.240]  They are quality. I can't wait to get some more, and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[03:45:35.240 --> 03:45:36.240]  Absolutely.
[03:45:36.240 --> 03:45:44.240]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on,
[03:45:44.240 --> 03:45:49.240]  and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:45:53.240 --> 03:46:00.240]  InfoWarsLife Brainforce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[03:46:00.240 --> 03:46:04.240]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling new tropics were,
[03:46:04.240 --> 03:46:08.240]  what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[03:46:08.240 --> 03:46:17.240]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup. We only have 150%, and then it helps fund our operation.
[03:46:17.240 --> 03:46:28.240]  Well, now it's 50% off. That means we've got a 25% markup, and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[03:46:28.240 --> 03:46:33.240]  Brainforce takes about 30 minutes, but the two go together. It's the mind and body challenge.
[03:46:33.240 --> 03:46:43.240]  They're both 50% off individually, or together they're 50% off, and free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:46:43.240 --> 03:47:04.240]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these best sellers are about to sell out InfoWarsLife.com to get your Brainforce Plus and real red pill today.
[03:47:13.240 --> 03:47:21.240]  The Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:21.240 --> 03:47:27.240]  We are back. It is the final segment of The Alex Jones Show, a room with our insurers coming up next.
[03:47:27.240 --> 03:47:36.240]  But I first want to direct you back to InfoWarsStore.com because, again, we're under a sustained attack on a weekly basis with lawsuit after lawsuit piling on top of one another.
[03:47:36.240 --> 03:47:47.240]  So please continue to support us by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com. We have Brainforce Plus at 50%, 50% off for a limited time only.
[03:47:47.240 --> 03:47:54.240]  Again, that is our Neutropic brand. It helps with concentration, mental acuity, and memory. It really works.
[03:47:54.240 --> 03:48:02.240]  Everyone in Silicon Valley is doing it. This is a big frontier of mental performance supplementation right now.
[03:48:02.240 --> 03:48:13.240]  It's called Neutropics, and ours is called Brainforce Plus. It's available for 50% off at InfoWarsStore.com, where we also have bodies back at 25% off.
[03:48:13.240 --> 03:48:18.240]  This is the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support.
[03:48:18.240 --> 03:48:27.240]  We don't even mention the mood enhancement benefits of turmeric, which has been proven in peer reviewed scientific studies to have those benefits.
[03:48:27.240 --> 03:48:35.240]  We've got it back in stock at 50% off right now at InfoWarsStore.com, as well as a bunch of other products available right now.
[03:48:35.240 --> 03:48:40.240]  Please continue to support this network. We're not dependent on outside sponsors.
[03:48:40.240 --> 03:48:50.240]  So we can't be targeted by the kind of boycott campaign that you saw Laura Ingram over at Fox News be targeted by with David Hogg and that whole witch on outrage mob.
[03:48:50.240 --> 03:49:02.240]  They can't get us that way. Apparently they've just chosen to file frivolous lawsuit week after week to kind of create this crisis mentality that we're going down even though we win every single lawsuit.
[03:49:02.240 --> 03:49:09.240]  But they can celebrate, and it actually comes down to it. We thrive. We prosper. We actually get bigger. Keep going. Keep going. Well done.
[03:49:09.240 --> 03:49:16.240]  Please continue to support us though. We're only able to keep going with your support by getting the product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:49:16.240 --> 03:49:25.240]  Now let's get into some more of this news right now. Big poll out today from Monmouth University, and this is up on BrightBot.com.
[03:49:25.240 --> 03:49:37.240]  77% believe traditional media guilty of fake news. That is absolutely huge. The vast majority of Americans believe mainstream media outlets report, quote, fake news.
[03:49:37.240 --> 03:49:49.240]  Now, of course, the mainstream media, the legacy media itself, right at the statement before the election, even before, contrived that hysteria, contrived that moral panic of fake news.
[03:49:49.240 --> 03:50:04.240]  And oh, how delicious, how hilarious it is to see how much it's blown back in their faces to the point where 77% of Americans, this is out of 800 respondents say that the mainstream media puts out fake news.
[03:50:04.240 --> 03:50:13.240]  83% of those question believe that special interest groups intentionally seek to implant the mainstream news cycle with false information.
[03:50:13.240 --> 03:50:19.240]  And 87% believe that those same forces influence social media such as Facebook, as well as YouTube.
[03:50:19.240 --> 03:50:29.240]  So the vast majority of the American people know that this whole fake news scandal, which was created to try and discredit, to try and demean alternative news outlets.
[03:50:29.240 --> 03:50:39.240]  So let's not deny that there are fake news outlets that deliberately put out misleading information, false information, which they know not to be true.
[03:50:39.240 --> 03:50:50.240]  But the Stanford University study, other studies proved that that did not have any kind of significant impact on the US election, had no significant impact on Brexit.
[03:50:50.240 --> 03:51:07.240]  The problem is far, far tinier than they made it out to be. They were butthurt at the fact that they're losing, at the fact that the political paradigm, the current climate is shifting against their favor in terms of the popular revolution that swept Europe over the past three years.
[03:51:07.240 --> 03:51:20.240]  They created this conspiracy theory that it was all due to fake news. No evidence for it. When you actually look at the figures, it hasn't had a big impact. But it has had a big impact in blowing back on them, which is why it's so hilarious.
[03:51:20.240 --> 03:51:32.240]  Which is why now this whole, you know, this hysteria over Sinclair Broadcasting and that fake news package that they put together criticizing fake news is kind of funny because they're using it today.
[03:51:32.240 --> 03:51:41.240]  Look at what the conservative right wing Sinclair Broadcasting does, because CNN would never have a consensus which they enforce throughout their news organization, would they?
[03:51:41.240 --> 03:51:51.240]  Oh, no. They don't hire people based on their political beliefs. They don't fire people based on their political beliefs. How many Trump supporters who were working for CNN?
[03:51:51.240 --> 03:51:56.240]  Because they tried to feign some kind of balance. How many of those have been fired since the election?
[03:51:56.240 --> 03:52:08.240]  So don't try and pretend that you don't have a bias. Everybody has a bias. We have a bias. We're just honest about it. We admit to it. You don't. You pretend to be neutral and impartial.
[03:52:08.240 --> 03:52:17.240]  Jim Acosta literally screaming out at Trump every time he gets the chance. He's not a neutral reporter. He's not an impartial journalist. He's an activist.
[03:52:17.240 --> 03:52:34.240]  CNN has become an activist news organization, which is fine, but just admit to it. Okay. You are the fake news. This has blown back in your faces and it's absolutely hilarious, which is why you're now trying to censor everyone else and literally lobbying to have our YouTube channel shut down.
[03:52:34.240 --> 03:52:47.240]  Because you're so nervous that there will be a slight chance of competition. CNN is way bigger than Infowars. It dwarfs us in terms of size, money, income, employees, whatever way you want to look at it.
[03:52:47.240 --> 03:52:56.240]  So why are they so nervous? Why do they attack me on a regular basis? If we were so inconsequential, just ignore us.
[03:52:56.240 --> 03:53:09.240]  They don't because they're nervous because their average viewer is age 60 years old. They're dying. They're literally dying. They're not resonating with people anymore. They can't get one show in the top 20.
[03:53:09.240 --> 03:53:22.240]  And they blame us for that. No, it's your content. It's your bias. It's your fake news, which is why 77% of Americans now believe that the mainstream media puts out fake news. Well done on that narrative.
[03:53:22.240 --> 03:53:30.240]  That works out great for you, didn't it? Idiots. Malaysia to punish fake news with six year prison sentences. Now, isn't this interesting?
[03:53:30.240 --> 03:53:43.240]  Because we've seen this out of the European Union as well. Authoritarian regimes and political bodies hijacking this contrived hysteria about fake news to prosecute to punish political dissidents.
[03:53:43.240 --> 03:53:53.240]  Isn't that interesting? The authoritarian regimes would catch on to something created by the legacy media establishment in the United States.
[03:53:53.240 --> 03:54:07.240]  Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's government approved a law banning the malicious spread of false news. Again, completely subjective term, reporting on Monday instituting penalties of up to six years in prison and $125,000.
[03:54:07.240 --> 03:54:17.240]  Six years in prison for somebody who's probably would unwittingly post fake news, the very definition of which is completely subjective.
[03:54:17.240 --> 03:54:35.240]  I've talked about earlier, they were saying Google does not recognize religious festivals. It never has. That's why it didn't recognize Easter. BS. One month ago, they recognized the Hindu holy religious festival with a doodle on their homepage.
[03:54:35.240 --> 03:54:47.240]  Okay, that's CNN putting out fake news. Anyone going to get in trouble for that? Andrew Kaczynski did not retract it when I got on Twitter pointed out he was completely wrong. Didn't retract it. Just ignored it.
[03:54:47.240 --> 03:55:01.240]  Nothing happens when they put out their fake news. And as I document as I was highlighted in my video about a month ago, their fake news is way more damaging than some crappy little blog in some fringe obscure corner of the Internet.
[03:55:01.240 --> 03:55:13.240]  Their fake news literally starts wars, literally gets people killed. Why do you think we're in a cold war again with Russia because of their fake news and in my country because of fake news about this poison attack?
[03:55:13.240 --> 03:55:26.240]  Their fake news is the most damaging you could ever imagine. No consequences whatsoever. Now Malaysia. Now these other authoritarian regimes are punishing people for putting out fake news.
[03:55:26.240 --> 03:55:38.240]  Authoritarian regimes glomming on to that contrived hysteria tells you everything you need to know about the true agenda behind fake news, the hysteria created by the mainstream media in the first place.
[03:55:38.240 --> 03:55:54.240]  Now on Twitter earlier, Christian privilege was trending as well as hashtag lover Muslim. So we've got Christian privilege trending. We've got this article out of campus reform. I think it is a college fix actually.
[03:55:54.240 --> 03:56:13.240]  University event aims to combat Christian privilege. George Washington University Diversity Workshop is to be held four days after Easter. They will host a training session for students and faculty that teaches Christians, especially white ones, because they have to sprinkle a little bit of racism in there too, obviously, as well as anti-Christian bigotry,
[03:56:13.240 --> 03:56:29.240]  quote, receive unmerited perks from institutions and systems all across our country. Right, really. So Christian privilege is that the privilege to be discriminated against mocked and derided by major academic institutions like George Washington University,
[03:56:29.240 --> 03:56:40.240]  by dominant cultural institutions like the entire breadth and width of the social media sphere, Twitter, Facebook, whatever, you've seen the tweets and the mainstream media, which gives them all protection.
[03:56:40.240 --> 03:56:54.240]  Is that what they mean when they talk about Christian privilege? Or are they talking about the privilege of Christians in Islamic countries, in Middle Eastern countries across the world, who are being persecuted like no other religion on Earth?
[03:56:54.240 --> 03:57:13.240]  Is that the Christian privilege they're talking about? They're talking about Christian slaves being forced to pay jizya tax in these Middle Eastern countries, being killed, being beheaded, being forced to flee the areas in which they've lived for decades and decades, being humiliated and belittled while all that's happening by people in the West.
[03:57:13.240 --> 03:57:27.240]  Is that the Christian privilege that you're talking about? Is that why it's trending on Twitter? Absolutely disgrace. I'm not even a Christian. Christians are the most persecuted religion in the world, fact, and they're belittled.
[03:57:27.240 --> 03:57:35.240]  They're ridiculed. They're humiliated at the same time in the West by the dominant cultural institutions by the media. Is that your Christian privilege?
[03:57:35.240 --> 03:57:43.240]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour. War Room with Owen Shryer coming up in 4Wars.com. Don't go away.
[03:58:06.240 --> 03:58:13.240]  Now, it's the other side of the equation. Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides.
[03:58:13.240 --> 03:58:26.240]  But more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace. Yeast mold creates slime walls. And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[03:58:26.240 --> 03:58:35.240]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall. Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
