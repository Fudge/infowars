[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:30.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.840 --> 00:39.880]  welcome my friends welcome it is Wednesday the 10th day of March 2010
[00:39.880 --> 00:46.240]  we're gonna be live here for the next four hours on Friday Jesse Ventura
[00:46.240 --> 00:52.360]  joins us for a full hour to talk about his new book his TV show and a lot more
[00:52.360 --> 00:59.200]  and today coming up in the next hour Dick Russell his co-author will be
[00:59.200 --> 01:06.820]  joining us we're gonna go through American conspiracies you may have heard
[01:06.820 --> 01:13.280]  that name before I'm really looking forward to the interview also the
[01:13.280 --> 01:20.720]  Huffington Post invited a section of the book to be published in their online
[01:20.720 --> 01:25.840]  publication they'd already published part of a previous chapter on government
[01:25.840 --> 01:31.280]  drug dealing but when they put up the piece about 9-11 truth it was taken down
[01:31.280 --> 01:35.360]  in a few hours and a message put up there that 9-11 conspiracy theories are
[01:35.360 --> 01:42.700]  presiding on grata they are not allowed so we'll talk about these attempts at
[01:42.700 --> 01:47.260]  censorship because hey it's there it's their website they can do what they want
[01:47.260 --> 01:53.900]  but once they invite something and then bring it on and then slap it down it's
[01:53.900 --> 02:01.380]  a pretty serious issue not as serious as what's happening in the Congress the
[02:01.380 --> 02:09.340]  sergeant and arms office putting out an email yesterday the drugs report was
[02:09.340 --> 02:17.380]  placing viruses on people's computers complete and total lime I even had my
[02:17.380 --> 02:22.180]  IT savvy wife go look at the drugs report and see if it was doing any
[02:22.180 --> 02:26.380]  cookies or putting anything on our computer it's not true only thing drugs
[02:26.380 --> 02:31.260]  has got running on that is an auto refresh every 25 minutes refreshes the
[02:31.260 --> 02:33.460]  page
[02:34.300 --> 02:39.260]  total line but but see that's a microcosm and now the Senate's backed off
[02:39.260 --> 02:44.860]  last night name they've had to admit that okay drudges and putting viruses on
[02:44.860 --> 02:49.100]  people's computers it's the same thing though with people that try to access
[02:49.100 --> 02:53.700]  info wars dot com prison planet dot com in libraries government buildings
[02:53.700 --> 02:58.980]  government provided Wi-Fi and many cities around the world you pay for it
[02:58.980 --> 03:03.820]  with tax money but since it's free they're giving it back to you they
[03:03.820 --> 03:09.780]  censor it and it says oh this site promotes hate or this site promotes
[03:09.780 --> 03:14.300]  extremism or this site has dangerous information or this site isn't safe to
[03:14.300 --> 03:21.180]  visit blocked and we see this more and more if I see it examples every day I
[03:21.180 --> 03:28.020]  saw a blog spot article critical of Larry Silverstein and the control
[03:28.020 --> 03:31.180]  demolitions of the World Trade Center towers and all the insurance he took out
[03:31.180 --> 03:40.980]  on it and there was a Google message up in front of it that this has been flagged
[03:40.980 --> 03:49.140]  by a community is dangerous so this is a taste of more to come and we see the
[03:49.140 --> 03:52.220]  Australian system that they've now put into law they're trying to implement it
[03:52.220 --> 03:56.900]  where if anyone complains on your website it's just banned nationwide no way
[03:56.900 --> 04:02.780]  to get off the list and and and your authoritarian systems Stalin's Russia
[04:02.780 --> 04:11.660]  Hitler's Germany Mao's China little designated cattle tails can just send you
[04:11.660 --> 04:16.860]  to a gulag and the system just clicks their heels whenever little attack dogs
[04:16.860 --> 04:23.500]  point you out like a pointer like a bird dog and you go on the no-fly list you
[04:23.500 --> 04:29.100]  go on the no-gun buy list you go on the no-worklist and they turn loose armies
[04:29.100 --> 04:35.900]  of sniveling control freaks well on top of that we got another distributed
[04:35.900 --> 04:40.060]  denial of service attack yesterday and I always find it's interesting the way
[04:40.060 --> 04:45.780]  these come in it was the same type of denial of service attack we got last
[04:45.780 --> 04:52.740]  April when we were exposing the swine flu at a key juncture and it came out of
[04:52.740 --> 04:57.180]  the same distribution system so we'll we'll talk about that today as well
[04:57.180 --> 05:02.140]  gee Edward Griffin's also coming on in the last hour major world crisis away
[05:02.140 --> 05:07.260]  from having a totalitarian type of system the main event is the the wholesale

[08:06.060 --> 08:12.780]  radio network okay I've got a lot of really important news from around the
[08:12.780 --> 08:17.660]  world and here in the United States G Edward Griffin is joining us in the last
[08:17.660 --> 08:22.180]  hour co-author of Jesse Ventura's new book American conspiracies Dick Russell
[08:22.180 --> 08:27.420]  is on with us in the next hour they had an article that they were requested to
[08:27.420 --> 08:32.100]  publish in the Huffington Post censored on 9-11 truth that is coming up and a
[08:32.100 --> 08:36.420]  lot more but before I forget to get to this because I saw this two days ago
[08:36.420 --> 08:43.380]  when I first heard this on news radio 590 k lbj and it's now in the Austin
[08:43.380 --> 08:48.060]  American statesman today and the reason this is important for the rest of the
[08:48.060 --> 08:56.220]  country is the fact of our investigation about art a saveta is borne out in this
[08:56.220 --> 09:05.980]  article very slick politician very nice very charming very intelligent comes on
[09:05.980 --> 09:12.700]  the show whenever we request him to come down but absolutely unconstitutional
[09:12.700 --> 09:19.780]  activities he spearheaded two years ago warrantless blood draws first they have
[09:19.780 --> 09:24.420]  these rubber stamp fake warrants like national security letters similar what
[09:24.420 --> 09:28.620]  homeland security uses for roving wiretaps just rubber stamps and then they
[09:28.620 --> 09:32.620]  went to the Texas legislature and had them pass a law that they can take blood
[09:32.620 --> 09:39.880]  without a warrant I was talking to a former Austin judge well one of my
[09:39.880 --> 09:43.340]  lawyers and he was just saying the judges are all just shaking their heads
[09:43.340 --> 09:48.540]  and it goes on from there shutting down a gun show at the orders of the ATF
[09:48.540 --> 09:56.260]  without a law so I researched our days of theta and when he was with the chips
[09:56.260 --> 10:03.380]  the California Highway Patrol he blew the whistle on supposed corruption in
[10:03.380 --> 10:10.700]  the chips with the feds now sometimes that's a good thing but then he got
[10:10.700 --> 10:17.780]  fast-tracked by this federal think tank that vets police chiefs and then tell
[10:17.780 --> 10:23.500]  cities will give you more federal funds if you put this guy in and he literally
[10:23.500 --> 10:30.340]  is a basically a federal officer he's and here it is today I have several
[10:30.340 --> 10:35.300]  articles on it this is from impact news Austin police chief art a saveta is
[10:35.300 --> 10:42.060]  running for Dallas police chief Austin police chief art a saveta recently
[10:42.060 --> 10:46.260]  applied to lead Dallas's police team as chief along with six other finalists
[10:46.260 --> 10:52.020]  from around the nation and of course who chose the finalist not the people of
[10:52.020 --> 10:57.100]  Dallas not even the city council recruited by the police executive
[10:57.100 --> 11:03.420]  research forum in Washington DC a saveta said the move did not come as a
[11:03.420 --> 11:07.620]  response to dissatisfaction with his role in Austin but sees the position as a
[11:07.620 --> 11:12.220]  new opportunity I'm extremely happy and deeply love the city and the department
[11:12.220 --> 11:16.140]  a saveta said in a phone interview believe me I'm extremely torn it's been
[11:16.140 --> 11:21.980]  an emotional 24 hours so you know the issue is this guy's gonna end up high
[11:21.980 --> 11:28.620]  level justice department that's how it works and he will probably end up being
[11:28.620 --> 11:35.860]  chosen as Dallas police chief because he's so slick so smooth and he can make
[11:35.860 --> 11:41.300]  the public love warrantless blood draws he can really sell the public on the
[11:41.300 --> 11:48.180]  police state and he gets the police to dress nicer and be more polite as they
[11:48.180 --> 11:52.340]  violate your rights and the and I liked him the first six months he was in
[11:52.340 --> 11:55.660]  because he actually punished some bad cops here in Austin that were shooting
[11:55.660 --> 11:59.380]  innocent people in the back and things I was saying wow you know I like this guy
[11:59.380 --> 12:04.860]  but boy it's just it's bad news you know why can't Austin why can't Dallas why
[12:04.860 --> 12:10.460]  can't Washington DC why can't LA why can't Santa Fe New Mexico or Detroit
[12:10.460 --> 12:14.580]  Michigan have a police chief from the city that's how it always was until 50
[12:14.580 --> 12:19.980]  years ago now almost every chief in the country and I've had police officers
[12:19.980 --> 12:25.700]  on like Colonel Craig Roberts also army veteran to talk about his experiences in
[12:25.700 --> 12:31.420]  Oklahoma and Tulsa and other places and they just bring in these feds and so you
[12:31.420 --> 12:37.380]  can have cops and national surveys 98% in the last big law enforcement survey
[12:37.380 --> 12:40.500]  believe that there should be less gun laws and believe the Second Amendment is
[12:40.500 --> 12:47.540]  good 98% of cops are right on that issue but they've got this type of
[12:47.540 --> 12:53.820]  leadership like Art Acevedo and I haven't even tried to get him in lately
[12:53.820 --> 12:57.300]  because I mean what's the point of having some slick politician come in here
[12:57.300 --> 13:09.780]  and basically bend me over no and so Matt one of our IT guys said we ought to
[13:09.780 --> 13:14.100]  have another protest down at the police station where we rent you halls and go
[13:14.100 --> 13:18.500]  down there and in inviting that will pay his way up to Dallas but you know
[13:18.500 --> 13:25.500]  Dallas is my hometown and he'll fit in nicely there for six years it's been in
[13:25.500 --> 13:30.340]  the newspapers up there that the police have knock-and-talks and they for some
[13:30.340 --> 13:32.540]  reason only do it in wealthy neighborhoods they found people are more
[13:32.540 --> 13:35.820]  polite and didn't let him in and they just come and knock and say man may we
[13:35.820 --> 13:40.820]  come in and inspect your guns now this has been going on for a decade around
[13:40.820 --> 13:44.380]  the country six years in Dallas and then it turns into things like Boston and
[13:44.380 --> 13:49.420]  DC and Chicago where they actually come and force their way in without warrants
[13:49.420 --> 13:54.620]  that was actually in the news last year just unspeakable unconstitutional
[13:54.620 --> 14:00.380]  activity so Art Acevada will fit in nicely up in Dallas shutting down their
[14:00.380 --> 14:05.340]  gun shows illegally under federal orders and taking blood on the side of the
[14:05.340 --> 14:10.580]  highway and you know look for Art Acevada in Homeland Security soon if he
[14:10.580 --> 14:14.900]  gets into Dallas or it's only matter of time to another big top 10 city what
[14:14.900 --> 14:20.660]  Dallas is number five in the country he'll move on from that next springboard
[14:20.660 --> 14:25.340]  to the Justice Department the ATF something like that and so he will
[14:25.340 --> 14:29.780]  definitely end up being a powerful general in the New World Order's Army but
[14:29.780 --> 14:36.820]  remember Acevada remember decades from now remember what how you sold out I
[14:36.820 --> 14:43.460]  mean is it worth it what you've done but he became a little federal darling
[14:43.460 --> 14:52.740]  what was it seven years ago in California and you know there's so much
[14:52.740 --> 14:56.900]  police corruption in California the types of things that he exposed were
[14:56.900 --> 15:02.340]  pretty pretty small and you'll always notice that the feds always go in and
[15:02.340 --> 15:06.940]  take over police departments and then things get ten times worse oh we're
[15:06.940 --> 15:11.300]  here to fix things we're here to take care of it then it only gets worse so
[15:11.300 --> 15:17.580]  total federalization I've been touched by how warmly I've been embraced by both
[15:17.580 --> 15:23.100]  the APD and the community we serve but I think in my career you're tenuous at
[15:23.100 --> 15:27.140]  best on a good day the lifecycle of a police chief is most major cities is
[15:27.140 --> 15:31.460]  three to five years and that is quickly approaching for me I owe it to my family
[15:31.460 --> 15:38.260]  and myself to explore this career possibly and keep my options open but
[15:38.260 --> 15:44.900]  don't worry again it's not the people of Dallas that are choosing this guy no
[15:44.900 --> 15:50.820]  the six police chiefs are recruited by the police executive research forum in
[15:50.820 --> 15:57.620]  Washington DC and the feds choose through this quasi government think tank
[15:57.620 --> 16:02.900]  with all these government officials sitting on it they decide who absolutely
[16:02.900 --> 16:06.700]  will trample the Bill of Rights and Constitution who licks the boots of
[16:06.700 --> 16:12.100]  federal agents stomping on the Constitution are they so Vada send him
[16:12.100 --> 16:16.460]  to the top well he'll probably be on this board in 10 15 years when he
[16:16.460 --> 16:29.500]  retires and it just expands out from there how these individuals operate
[16:29.500 --> 16:38.820]  that's why in Time Magazine Newsweek Fox News CNN everywhere Bill O'Reilly's
[16:38.820 --> 16:43.860]  attacking him but I'm supposed to like it well because Bill O'Reilly's on Fox he
[16:43.860 --> 16:51.060]  must be good attacking Stuart Rhodes of Oathkeepers attacking Sheriff Mack I mean
[16:51.060 --> 16:56.820]  what does Sheriff Mack do he goes around the country highly decorated Sheriff
[16:56.820 --> 17:02.060]  did a lot of great work as a lawman before that stood up went to the Supreme
[17:02.060 --> 17:11.060]  Court overturned an unconstitutional background check gun registration so
[17:11.060 --> 17:13.620]  they just changed it over to the instant check so they could continue their
[17:13.620 --> 17:19.820]  unconstitutional activity and he goes around to Sheriff's around the country
[17:19.820 --> 17:24.300]  he told the New York Times that it was this show that really introduced him to
[17:24.300 --> 17:29.620]  the nation and that's great that's what this broadcast is for that that's when
[17:29.620 --> 17:32.980]  suddenly he got all these huge speaking engagements to thousands of people
[17:32.980 --> 17:37.060]  every day or two in different cities of the country getting good Sheriff's
[17:37.060 --> 17:40.900]  elected let's say we're not going to let the feds come in here and violate the
[17:40.900 --> 17:45.100]  Bill O'Reilly's and Constitution you've got to follow state and county law it's a
[17:45.100 --> 17:50.580]  jurisdictional issue that's why they're demonizing him because he's the
[17:50.580 --> 17:56.900]  opposite of art Acevedo so you got the feds coddling and under their dark wings
[17:56.900 --> 18:01.020]  art Acevedo and by the way I've noticed with a lot of police chiefs they weren't
[18:01.020 --> 18:05.180]  born in this country art Acevedo is from Cuba and he claims he doesn't like
[18:05.180 --> 18:08.380]  Fidel Castro but let me tell you that sounds like something Fidel Castro do
[18:08.380 --> 18:14.860]  shut down a gun show without a law or take blood without warrants I think him
[18:14.860 --> 18:19.180]  growing up in Cuba a little too much of that authoritarian system rubbed off on
[18:19.180 --> 18:24.740]  him see we can't have a police chief from Austin Texas we can't have one from
[18:24.740 --> 18:31.060]  West Texas in Austin or South Texas or North Texas we've got plenty of if it's
[18:31.060 --> 18:36.100]  a quota system Hispanic officers from Texas whose families go back to the

[26:58.700 --> 27:03.260]  launched this last week officially but I haven't even posted a banner for people
[27:03.260 --> 27:08.180]  that might not have found the article that has the contest rules three
[27:08.180 --> 27:13.100]  contest fifteen thousand dollars in prizes no second or third place there's
[27:13.100 --> 27:18.140]  just three prizes ten thousand dollar prize for one contest three thousand for
[27:18.140 --> 27:22.620]  another and two thousand for the other find out about all the contest again
[27:22.620 --> 27:28.460]  info wars officially launches a naked body scanner protest contest you go out
[27:28.460 --> 27:34.100]  have a protest demonstration stunt as long as it's legal and you shoot video
[27:34.100 --> 27:42.220]  of it posted to YouTube send it to us and April 10th coming up in 30 days from
[27:42.220 --> 27:48.620]  today that is when the contest closes you've got to have it in by then and

[27:55.740 --> 27:59.380]  three winners here on the air I'll probably end up also getting the winners
[27:59.380 --> 28:03.780]  on but that's not part of the contest so fifteen thousand dollars but no matter
[28:03.780 --> 28:09.620]  how you demonstrate or get involved or post videos you win because it educates
[28:09.620 --> 28:14.300]  people against the naked body scanners that are in danger of being removed from
[28:14.300 --> 28:18.220]  airports and many airports are saying no to them not just in the u.s. or Canada
[28:18.220 --> 28:22.340]  but also in England Europe I mean we keep pushing on this the establishment
[28:22.340 --> 28:25.620]  counts on us to get mad at first and then kind of shut up and go along with it no
[28:25.620 --> 28:29.460]  we've got to just continue to push continue to educate people continue to

[36:03.460 --> 36:09.380]  you can't have an ad for your gun shop this is part of them intimidating us
[36:09.380 --> 36:13.100]  that our guns are dirty in the second minutes evil oh but when we see cops in
[36:13.100 --> 36:17.380]  black masks driving around in armored wheeled tanks with microwave or sound
[36:17.380 --> 36:21.420]  guns beating people with belly clubs for no reason or police dogs attacking
[36:21.420 --> 36:25.620]  old women at the G20 or troops jumping out of cars and grabbing activists for
[36:25.620 --> 36:30.220]  no reason and speeding off with them the G20 admitted they were doing it the
[36:30.220 --> 36:35.540]  media thought that was a hoax it was so third world or sci-fi police state then
[36:35.540 --> 36:41.180]  later it came out no it's real and they said those were just private contractors
[36:41.180 --> 36:45.380]  in army uniforms well that's even worse don't worry it wasn't the army it was
[36:45.380 --> 36:51.380]  private contractors oh just snatching people off the street and now they've
[36:51.380 --> 37:00.500]  got a bill in Congress the belligerent act the enemy belligerent act that says
[37:00.500 --> 37:04.100]  for any intelligence purposes or any reason designated by the president or
[37:04.100 --> 37:07.580]  his designates you can be secretly arrested held interrogated never given
[37:07.580 --> 37:17.300]  a trial now they already have similar language in the enemy combatant act but
[37:17.300 --> 37:24.620]  this is out in the open maple wood Matt Carmel is a card-carrying member of the
[37:24.620 --> 37:28.580]  National Rifle Association that implies like it's a card-carrying member of the
[37:28.580 --> 37:33.300]  communist who lives here a left-leaning suburban basin it's not left leading
[37:33.300 --> 37:36.420]  you're a bunch of people who are into being disarmed slaves worshiping
[37:36.420 --> 37:42.380]  government socialism and being disarmed you're not a left-leaning suburb you're
[37:42.380 --> 37:47.660]  a un-american leaning group of chicken-necked cowards who have a
[37:47.660 --> 37:54.420]  religion of being disarmed weaklings who love being victims you're a cult
[37:54.420 --> 38:01.820]  leaning suburb the cult of slavery you enjoy your slavery Matt Carmel is a
[38:01.820 --> 38:05.180]  card-carrying member of the National Rifle Association who lives here a left
[38:05.180 --> 38:12.540]  leaning suburban basin with annual be about peace days oh yeah big supporters
[38:12.540 --> 38:17.300]  of Obama launched all these new wars I love how Obama says oh I'll draw the
[38:17.300 --> 38:21.300]  troops down in a year then a year later I'll draw them down in a year then a
[38:21.300 --> 38:25.900]  year later I'm gonna draw them down in a year and then the few that do leave
[38:25.900 --> 38:30.620]  Iraq it sent to new countries I mean you gotta love it oh yes you're so about
[38:30.620 --> 38:36.700]  peace he has had polite differences of opinions over the years evidenced by
[38:36.700 --> 38:42.100]  signs on his front lawn reading I'm the NRA and I vote but now he's clearly
[38:42.100 --> 38:45.980]  miffed Carmel a licensed gun dealer applied to sponsor a team in the local
[38:45.980 --> 38:49.740]  Babe Ruth Cal Ripken baseball league using the name of his business
[38:49.740 --> 38:57.660]  Constitution Arms just sponsored by Constitution Arms no that's dirty he was
[38:57.660 --> 39:04.460]  rebuffed arbitrary capricious and unfair Carmel said of the perceived slight the
[39:04.460 --> 39:09.900]  perceived slight it's perceived I know it's it happened I don't like being
[39:09.900 --> 39:15.380]  pigeonholed it all started in October when Carmel an NRA certified pistol
[39:15.380 --> 39:19.860]  instructor and licensed firearms dealer sent a letter to the South Orange
[39:19.860 --> 39:24.020]  Maplewood Baseball Committee which oversees 120 softball and baseball teams
[39:24.020 --> 39:31.380]  with a 1,250 children ages 5 to 15 since his 10-year-old son Kalman has played
[39:31.380 --> 39:36.500]  the season before Carmel wanted to put up 300 feet to sponsor the team himself
[39:36.500 --> 39:41.500]  but an 8 to 1 vote the volunteer committee said thanks but no thanks and
[39:41.500 --> 39:44.180]  then it goes on
[39:47.740 --> 39:52.020]  oh boy and then they have quotes about this isn't something good for children
[39:52.020 --> 39:56.100]  to see that's right they've got to learn how to be disarmed and slaves to the
[39:56.100 --> 39:59.820]  foreign banks we've all got to be trained how to submit and every major
[39:59.820 --> 40:03.580]  public school has unannounced drills where the cops come in and scream we're
[40:03.580 --> 40:07.780]  gonna kill you we're homeschoolers to make kids hate homeschoolers and in the
[40:07.780 --> 40:10.740]  weird psychology the parents don't get mad when their kids come home with soiled
[40:10.740 --> 40:15.220]  underwear in a closed to catatonic state they say why they have the drill they
[40:15.220 --> 40:19.340]  were homeschoolers and the parents call the school and they say we have to do
[40:19.340 --> 40:25.140]  these drills the terrorists may hit learned helplessness I remember in
[40:25.140 --> 40:32.900]  1999 it's actually in police state to the takeover we got videos and photos out
[40:32.900 --> 40:36.940]  of Missouri where they would have the elementary school students put their
[40:36.940 --> 40:41.220]  hands behind their heads and get on buses before Columbine and they were
[40:41.220 --> 40:44.780]  taken to a quote FEMA center then it came out the Washington Post seven years
[40:44.780 --> 40:48.860]  ago that FEMA does have a plan nationwide to take your children in the
[40:48.860 --> 40:52.820]  inventive emergency and you better believe it you've got to come to the
[40:52.820 --> 40:56.860]  center unarmed so you can be processed in I mean they've built this
[40:56.860 --> 41:00.260]  infrastructure and they've got lots of excuses and they're slowly trying to sell
[41:00.260 --> 41:06.060]  to the public all right let me get into some censorship news and I'm gonna get
[41:06.060 --> 41:12.780]  into what's happening with the economy and more plus a key article written by
[41:12.780 --> 41:16.660]  Paul Joseph Watson I'm gonna get to this in the third hour today we don't have a
[41:16.660 --> 41:22.380]  guest on perversion is fine so long as you're in a position of authority
[41:22.380 --> 41:28.380]  prisonplanet.com and it's a devastating article everyone needs to read this all
[41:28.380 --> 41:32.900]  over the England the US you name it people are now arrested for taking
[41:32.900 --> 41:38.740]  photos of their daughters in bikinis in the pool there's no law they don't care
[41:38.740 --> 41:46.220]  they arrest you the juries are so brainwashed they convict now they're
[41:46.220 --> 41:49.380]  arresting people for showing pictures of their children in the bathtub from the
[41:49.380 --> 41:54.100]  chest up no see they're teaching you that everything that's normal is evil
[41:54.100 --> 41:58.220]  meanwhile Watson has all these examples in England in the US with cameras in the
[41:58.220 --> 42:03.340]  toilets in the showers with the naked children being recorded by the government
[42:03.340 --> 42:06.780]  and shared across state lines with each other because that's who these people
[42:06.780 --> 42:11.300]  are the government employs pedophiles puts them in power protects them because
[42:11.300 --> 42:15.220]  they'll do anything to have access to kids and they set the precedent we're
[42:15.220 --> 42:18.460]  gonna watch you at home over the laptop the government issued we're gonna watch
[42:18.460 --> 42:24.580]  you in the showers we're going to try to arrest people if they take photos of
[42:24.580 --> 42:28.500]  their children in public now I mean your child could be wearing a three-piece
[42:28.500 --> 42:31.180]  suit and be at a park you take a photo of the police run up and say are you a
[42:31.180 --> 42:35.500]  pedophile that's because they're pedophiles and they want your children
[42:35.500 --> 42:42.020]  see this this is like an inquisition ladies and gentlemen perversion is fine
[42:42.020 --> 42:45.460]  so long as you're in a position of authority and you may not believe me
[42:45.460 --> 42:48.460]  that they videotape your daughters in the showers or that they watch you over
[42:48.460 --> 42:52.980]  the laptops Watson has links to all the mainstream articles you see how many
[42:52.980 --> 43:02.820]  links he's got one two three four five six seven links to mainstream news about
[43:02.820 --> 43:12.220]  it so isn't that perfect they well you saw the case on ABC News a few weeks ago
[43:12.220 --> 43:17.940]  where a highly decorated soldier his wife sends him a photo of what was it
[43:17.940 --> 43:22.500]  their five-year-old daughter in a bikini playing in a pool and he has been
[43:22.500 --> 43:30.140]  arrested or a family member in Arizona I'm only using cases that got a lot of
[43:30.140 --> 43:37.740]  attention the two and three-year-old wrapped in towels but they're crowding
[43:37.740 --> 43:41.060]  together you know you said your kids crowd together take a picture they're
[43:41.060 --> 43:47.060]  crowding together and so because their shoulders are touching your kids are gone
[43:47.060 --> 43:52.460]  we're the government but meanwhile the government is recording their naked
[43:52.460 --> 43:56.260]  bodies all over the country and I've been seeing this for more than a decade
[43:56.260 --> 44:01.340]  they've got cameras in the bathrooms in the showers everywhere and they do what
[44:01.340 --> 44:06.260]  they want they watch you at home they listen to your phones without warrants
[44:06.260 --> 44:15.820]  they are the stinking government the demonic potbellied government and this
[44:15.820 --> 44:22.580]  is the new inquisition I've got articles again out of New Jersey for some reason
[44:22.580 --> 44:27.660]  but also out of California where you buy more than 500 rounds of ammo in one
[44:27.660 --> 44:32.060]  case it was boxes of 22 shells you buy them 500 that's nothing that's not
[44:32.060 --> 44:38.140]  illegal ATF shows up at your door any excuse to harass people any excuse to
[44:38.140 --> 44:42.180]  come after the American people they've got unlimited funds for that but the
[44:42.180 --> 44:45.180]  underwear bomber of the State Department's ordered by the CIA to let him
[44:45.180 --> 44:50.820]  on the plane because they use that as the excuse to crack down on you and your
[44:50.820 --> 44:55.620]  family so this article perversion is fine so long as you're in a position of
[44:55.620 --> 45:03.500]  authority key article up on the site right now okay on the censorship front
[45:06.860 --> 45:18.660]  you know one week before we released the Obama deception the FBI shut up at my
[45:18.660 --> 45:24.020]  office then the FBI's were calling around my office and they wouldn't say
[45:24.020 --> 45:32.820]  why they were here and they sent me a subpoena for some IP addresses but in
[45:32.820 --> 45:35.700]  the subpoena it said you can't talk about it I talked to my lawyer he said I
[45:35.700 --> 45:39.940]  could probably challenge that but it's just best to you know pick my battles
[45:39.940 --> 45:43.820]  so I had to go on air and say the FBI is here they're asking about the Obama
[45:43.820 --> 45:48.900]  deception I don't know what it's about but I can't talk about it people said
[45:48.900 --> 45:53.540]  oh the FBI wasn't there it's a lie then it came out Associated Press wired
[45:53.540 --> 45:58.620]  magazine threat level and other publications was literally in hundreds of
[45:58.620 --> 46:04.260]  papers I mean it was just all over the country that some idiot was it in
[46:04.260 --> 46:09.900]  Virginia went on the site posted a cop's name that shot that black guy in the
[46:09.900 --> 46:14.620]  back and cold cold blood and then lied about it on the on the dark train
[46:14.620 --> 46:19.260]  platform in Oakland and he posted the guy's name and address and said go
[46:19.260 --> 46:27.380]  after him and his family and that guy went to prison and rightfully so
[46:27.380 --> 46:30.860]  regardless of how bad that cop was you don't say go after his family you leave
[46:30.860 --> 46:38.820]  people's families alone well then I could talk about it I mean if we tell you
[46:38.820 --> 46:42.980]  something's going on folks it's going on and I got a few emails I saw some of
[46:42.980 --> 46:46.460]  the comments most people noticed they had trouble getting on info wars but
[46:46.460 --> 46:52.660]  mainly prison planet TV was down about four hours yesterday off and on I mean
[46:52.660 --> 47:00.420]  if we tell you we've been a hacked we have you know I mean we tell you we're
[47:00.420 --> 47:03.980]  being blocked in New Zealand and Australia on many IPs it later came out
[47:03.980 --> 47:07.900]  in the news we were if we tell you the cyber security bill says that they're
[47:07.900 --> 47:10.820]  going to completely take over the internet shut down freedom of speech we
[47:10.820 --> 47:14.340]  told you that three months ago it's now in wire magazine it's now on the Wall
[47:14.340 --> 47:19.820]  Street Journal headline cyber security the end of the open internet taxes
[47:19.820 --> 47:25.420]  internet IDs censorship cast Sunstein now people didn't would not go read the
[47:25.420 --> 47:29.460]  bill they said I was making that up some people and then now the bills out and
[47:29.460 --> 47:36.940]  finally the news reports on it and people are finally getting freaked out but
[47:36.940 --> 47:41.740]  right before the and obviously what was happening was they were using the
[47:41.740 --> 47:46.460]  subpoena as a way to call my other employees and ask about the Obama
[47:46.460 --> 47:51.100]  deception whether that was the spookus or what I had to release it five days
[47:51.100 --> 47:55.100]  early because I mean you got the FBI here you got the FBI calling you've got
[47:55.100 --> 47:58.380]  them saying well well we want these IP addresses but we won't tell you what
[47:58.380 --> 48:01.940]  this is about now tell me about the Obama deception you have a problem with
[48:01.940 --> 48:07.460]  Obama and then calling people random extensions in my office we knew
[48:07.460 --> 48:11.020]  something was going on because we didn't even know what the subpoena dealt
[48:11.020 --> 48:22.340]  with well here it is Alex Jones websites under massive attack the last time
[48:22.340 --> 48:26.380]  this happened was right during the peak of the swine flu hysteria in Mexico when
[48:26.380 --> 48:30.100]  I was saying it was fake it was staged I was posting government documents how in
[48:30.100 --> 48:33.860]  January they were planning to stage the whole thing I got a secret state of
[48:33.860 --> 48:40.420]  Texas internal memorandum directly from a state official here in Austin with the
[48:40.420 --> 48:43.420]  name of the doctors at the board meeting where the feds were telling him we
[48:43.420 --> 48:47.580]  were really at level five going to level six and that all hell was going to
[48:47.580 --> 48:50.260]  break loose and I said I don't know if this is real or not I mean the
[48:50.260 --> 48:53.580]  documents real I don't know whether the feds really think this or this is part
[48:53.580 --> 48:57.780]  of their fear mongering to federalize things quietly but as soon as that came
[48:57.780 --> 49:04.500]  out we got hit with a distributed denial of service attack on all the sites all
[49:04.500 --> 49:12.060]  the big ones info wars prison planet this one was at prison planet dot TV now
[49:12.060 --> 49:17.860]  because it comes out of Japan and South Korea and Australia that doesn't mean
[49:17.860 --> 49:22.340]  it's from there most of the big hacks of this type with distributed denial of
[49:22.340 --> 49:25.060]  service are done because they have the best internet connections over there for
[49:25.060 --> 49:29.620]  some reason I mean you look at a map of the best internet connected countries
[49:29.620 --> 49:34.180]  in the world it's in Asia it's not the US we're way down the list and we have no
[49:34.180 --> 49:41.260]  way of telling where it came from but Paul Watson points out that we've
[49:41.260 --> 49:45.300]  already beefed up the servers more yes we have software in there that once we
[49:45.300 --> 49:50.540]  recognize you know that there's thousands of computers doing thousands of
[49:50.540 --> 49:56.180]  requests a second that that's not normal person on a on prison planet dot TV I
[49:56.180 --> 50:02.020]  mean it's a hundred percent it was an attack and the attack of course is meant
[50:02.020 --> 50:06.180]  to shut down one of our supply lines of funding in this operation this is a
[50:06.180 --> 50:09.820]  military operation against the New World Order a peaceful info war but
[50:09.820 --> 50:15.860]  nonetheless it we're fighting for our lives here that's why it's important for
[50:15.860 --> 50:20.060]  you even if you don't use it and it's a great value great information
[50:20.060 --> 50:24.060]  thousands of videos all my films my book Paul Watson's book the live TV show
[50:24.060 --> 50:29.380]  we simulcast for at least half of the radio show every day usually more we
[50:29.380 --> 50:33.700]  premiere my films at prison planet dot TV to I'm coming up next month
[50:33.700 --> 50:38.460]  premiering there you need to support it because see the enemies attacking it
[50:38.460 --> 50:47.380]  because they don't want us to have support so in protest to this hack I'd
[50:47.380 --> 50:51.460]  like to be able to say we got 500 new members today the present planet dot
[50:51.460 --> 50:56.540]  TV 15 cents a day do it one month 595 and that supports us unless it's
[50:56.540 --> 51:00.260]  expand what we're doing stand up against this hack become a present planet dot

[51:43.140 --> 51:45.820]  issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the
[51:45.820 --> 51:49.340]  people than a standing army hi Ted Anderson I'm placing a silver dollar in a
[51:49.340 --> 51:55.020]  book explains our monetary system call for your copy 800-686-2237 it's time to

[52:03.180 --> 52:07.380]  nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[52:07.380 --> 52:12.380]  chance to not relive history as it finishing off this agenda they'll be
[52:12.380 --> 52:16.500]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I have tremendous influence
[52:16.500 --> 52:21.340]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think
[52:21.340 --> 52:26.660]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention fall of
[52:26.660 --> 52:31.300]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[52:43.380 --> 52:48.900]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[54:07.500 --> 54:12.220]  yeah it looks like the same group that launched the distributed denial of
[54:12.220 --> 54:22.140]  service attack last April launched this one but we put more measures in place so
[54:22.140 --> 54:26.460]  instead of having trouble for two days last time it's still going on somewhat
[54:26.460 --> 54:31.740]  or we're under attack right now the bigger sites don't go down because we
[54:31.740 --> 54:35.700]  beefed them last year now we're beefing prison planet dot TV and that takes a
[54:35.700 --> 54:43.460]  lot of money it in this office is over $400,000 a year we've had consultants
[54:43.460 --> 54:47.300]  and we've got the best deals for accompanying our size for the amount of
[54:47.300 --> 54:55.700]  bandwidth we buy what is it 100 terabytes a month 100 terabytes of
[54:55.700 --> 55:03.340]  bandwidth a month and that doesn't count all the other backup servers so you can
[55:03.340 --> 55:12.060]  imagine how big these attacks are if systems that can theoretically almost
[55:12.060 --> 55:17.540]  take unlimited traffic have problems because they know how to target servers
[55:17.540 --> 55:22.620]  that are in front that actually serve out the site versus the media so it's
[55:22.620 --> 55:26.940]  very important to realize that we're being censored all over the world in
[55:26.940 --> 55:32.460]  libraries and government facilities and corporations and on Wi-Fi systems that
[55:32.460 --> 55:36.060]  we're being demonized that we've been put in databases as dangerous sites to go
[55:36.060 --> 55:40.420]  to sites that have viruses sites that have cookies we have none of that we
[55:40.420 --> 55:43.580]  don't have cookies any of you that know how to check that you can look in one
[55:43.580 --> 55:47.540]  second people appreciate that about info wars prison planet prison planet dot
[55:47.540 --> 55:52.060]  TV it's just all these lies any lies that can be told they're told and it's
[55:52.060 --> 55:54.980]  the same thing happened to the drudge report yesterday and now the sergeant
[55:54.980 --> 55:58.020]  arms has had to retract it and say okay there are no viruses on the drudge report
[55:58.020 --> 56:04.140]  there are no why would drudge do that that's ridiculous and destroy his media
[56:04.140 --> 56:08.580]  empire it was just made up they just lied about the drudge report because
[56:08.580 --> 56:12.580]  he's the main guy out there exposing the global warming fraud and the healthcare
[56:12.580 --> 56:15.980]  fraud and they know that all the major media reads it and goes off the drudge
[56:15.980 --> 56:20.140]  report and now he's posting our articles and they've been forced to admit it was
[56:20.140 --> 56:24.900]  a lie they put it out don't visit the drudge report it puts viruses on your
[56:24.900 --> 56:30.580]  computer and now the sergeant of arms admits oh no actually we downloaded fake
[56:30.580 --> 56:34.460]  security system you know those ads that say download the security system that's
[56:34.460 --> 56:42.540]  what was putting viruses on their computers so this is going on all over
[56:42.540 --> 56:49.020]  the place just attacking any alternative media demonizing it demonizing the
[56:49.020 --> 56:54.060]  internet you know one guy killed somebody that he met off of craigslist so
[56:54.060 --> 56:59.020]  we need to censor control craigslist or one person gets killed because some
[56:59.020 --> 57:04.180]  teenage girl gets conned at a meeting with a killer in England on Facebook so
[57:04.180 --> 57:09.340]  you know the internet's bad no it's the bad people out there and folks should be
[57:09.340 --> 57:14.540]  more widely women shouldn't go meet people they don't know off of the
[57:14.540 --> 57:18.780]  internet but instead of telling women not to do that they just say we're
[57:18.780 --> 57:23.420]  better do something about the internet it's dangerous another form of media
[57:23.420 --> 57:26.860]  censorship is the Huffington Post Huffington Post back when New World
[57:26.860 --> 57:30.820]  Order came out a year ago that film for IFC asked me to write an article I didn't
[57:30.820 --> 57:37.380]  do it because I figured it would be censored and I figured right they
[57:37.380 --> 57:41.420]  published part of a chapter about government drug dealing last week for
[57:41.420 --> 57:47.420]  Jesse Ventura's new American conspiracies and then yesterday morning for an
[57:47.420 --> 57:54.580]  hour they posted a section from American conspiracy on 9-11 and then it was
[57:54.580 --> 57:58.980]  taken down and it says the Huffington Post editorial policy laid out in our
[57:58.980 --> 58:03.020]  blogger guidelines prohibits the promotion and promulgation of conspiracy
[58:03.020 --> 58:09.340]  theories they would tell Galileo that the earth was the center of the universe
[58:09.340 --> 58:12.700]  and call them a conspiracy theorist if he said no the earth orbit of the Sun
[58:12.700 --> 58:21.300]  including those about 9-11 such as we have removed this post as such and they
[58:21.300 --> 58:27.420]  removed it but you can read what Ventura wrote at info wars.com can read the
[58:27.420 --> 58:31.380]  censored material Huffington Post since Ventura article to the memory hole so
[58:31.380 --> 58:34.820]  see the system is losing all credibility they're getting desperate to

[1:08:17.860 --> 1:08:24.540]  2010 the next 50 minutes or so in this hour we're joined by the co-author of
[1:08:24.540 --> 1:08:28.980]  several of Jesse Ventura's books Dick Russell he also wrote the bestseller
[1:08:28.980 --> 1:08:33.420]  don't start the revolution without me when I got an advanced copy of this book
[1:08:33.420 --> 1:08:37.980]  a month ago I was very impressed with it I think it's Ventura's best book and
[1:08:37.980 --> 1:08:42.620]  I've read don't have time to bleed and I've also read of course don't start
[1:08:42.620 --> 1:08:46.700]  revolution without me I remember four years ago giving Ventura my documentary
[1:08:46.700 --> 1:08:51.780]  films he said yeah my son's already educated me some on this but I'm very
[1:08:51.780 --> 1:08:58.580]  honored to be at least part of Ventura's latest education in reality he's
[1:08:58.580 --> 1:09:03.380]  always been a rebel always question the system an amazing individual so I don't
[1:09:03.380 --> 1:09:06.780]  want to say that Ventura's son and myself woke him up but we certainly
[1:09:06.780 --> 1:09:13.020]  contributed to him having a crash course in the true reality that the
[1:09:13.020 --> 1:09:17.860]  establishment media calls conspiracy theory I mean I remember 2002 I was
[1:09:17.860 --> 1:09:21.500]  saying Saddam didn't have WMD's I was having former weapons inspectors on
[1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:27.860]  former top CIA analyst on Iraq on and the media was calling me and my and other
[1:09:27.860 --> 1:09:34.500]  guest conspiracy theorist and I mean here's an ABC news article I was on a
[1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:37.980]  roller-rovera Saturday US military wanted to provoke war with Cuba
[1:09:37.980 --> 1:09:42.220]  military drafted plans to terrorize US cities to provoke war with Cuba stage

[1:10:01.180 --> 1:10:05.020]  she said how dare you make these allegations these are not allegations

[1:10:20.260 --> 1:10:25.700]  manual I mean here's ABC news stage terror attack plans but they don't care
[1:10:25.700 --> 1:10:29.700]  they just call it conspiracy theory and I've been watching Ventura on on the
[1:10:29.700 --> 1:10:34.420]  today show and on other programs we've got them posted up an info wars dot com
[1:10:34.420 --> 1:10:38.780]  and prison planet dot com all those different videos and they always say
[1:10:38.780 --> 1:10:42.340]  well this is your opinion or this is your conspiracy theory and Ventura says
[1:10:42.340 --> 1:10:47.020]  no I may speculate the starting or the end of a chapter but everything in
[1:10:47.020 --> 1:10:50.660]  here is government documents and provable information and it is an
[1:10:50.660 --> 1:10:55.540]  encyclopedia of really Ventura's research and Dick Russell's research as
[1:10:55.540 --> 1:11:02.100]  well Dick's been researching true reality for a long time so I want to walk
[1:11:02.100 --> 1:11:05.020]  through some of the chapters and for the rest of the hour Dick Russell and the

[1:12:21.660 --> 1:12:26.980]  reading notes this is Jesse Ventura's best book in my opinion and we are very
[1:12:26.980 --> 1:12:32.560]  honored to have Dick Russell co-author and researcher with Ventura on with us
[1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:38.140]  dick good to have you here thanks Alex good to be with you today is this your
[1:12:38.140 --> 1:12:43.460]  favorite Ventura book well I really enjoyed working with him on his on the
[1:12:43.460 --> 1:12:47.100]  book the autobiography the memoir of his years as governor and then what
[1:12:47.100 --> 1:12:52.140]  happened after that when he went to Harvard and and was you know censored
[1:12:52.140 --> 1:12:55.860]  basically taken off the air at MSNBC because he was quote too controversial I
[1:12:55.860 --> 1:12:59.940]  mean that was a lot of fun and that was the book that don't start the revolution
[1:12:59.940 --> 1:13:04.020]  without me but this one American conspiracy that is really close to my
[1:13:04.020 --> 1:13:09.460]  heart and his and and for many many years I've been in researching saving
[1:13:09.460 --> 1:13:13.940]  material on these subjects and did some fresh interviews along with Jesse did
[1:13:13.940 --> 1:13:19.100]  also for this book and so yeah I mean I'm thrilled to have it out there and
[1:13:19.100 --> 1:13:24.660]  he's a he's masterful on TV and believes the deeply in that we've got to get the
[1:13:24.660 --> 1:13:27.660]  truth out about a lot of the things that the government's been covering up for
[1:13:27.660 --> 1:13:32.580]  many many years and so it's great to have collaborated with him on this well
[1:13:32.580 --> 1:13:37.660]  dick this is a hardcore book I mean I've read it now almost twice I've almost
[1:13:37.660 --> 1:13:41.700]  gone through it a second time and I agree with the analysis in this book
[1:13:41.700 --> 1:13:45.620]  there's deep research here because I've been researching this for 16 years 14 on
[1:13:45.620 --> 1:13:51.460]  air and you know I'm kind of a one of the grand Pubos of this whole quote
[1:13:51.460 --> 1:13:55.260]  genre as the media would call it it's really just investigating reality and
[1:13:55.260 --> 1:14:00.140]  I mean you guys aren't pulling any punches here and we see Jesse Ventura
[1:14:00.140 --> 1:14:04.980]  getting more and more hardcore I mean that's the only word well yeah I mean
[1:14:04.980 --> 1:14:13.180]  he is and it's a kind of scary to me I mean the fact that when you look at the
[1:14:13.180 --> 1:14:18.660]  history of the last you know especially 40 50 years really starting you know
[1:14:18.660 --> 1:14:21.740]  with the CIA getting so much power in the 50s but then with the Kennedy
[1:14:21.740 --> 1:14:26.740]  assassination on through these various events and you look at what's really
[1:14:26.740 --> 1:14:30.700]  been really been going on in the country leading up you know finally
[1:14:30.700 --> 1:14:35.180]  culminating with the the years of George W. Bush and and the two stolen
[1:14:35.180 --> 1:14:39.940]  elections and nearly a third and then the cover up around 9-11 and I mean it's
[1:14:39.940 --> 1:14:45.700]  it's a it is indeed heavy-duty and I know that Jesse told me at one point that
[1:14:45.700 --> 1:14:50.780]  his wife Terry was kind of scared by the whole thing and and you know but I
[1:14:50.780 --> 1:14:54.900]  feel like it's crucially important for the American people to to take an
[1:14:54.900 --> 1:14:59.140]  alternative view to realize that what we're what we've been told all these
[1:14:59.140 --> 1:15:03.620]  years is not necessarily the accurate truth what we read in the history books
[1:15:03.620 --> 1:15:07.820]  what the kids are being taught and so you know it's time for time for this
[1:15:07.820 --> 1:15:12.780]  alternative picture to emerge and for people to start raising questions that
[1:15:12.780 --> 1:15:20.020]  they they hadn't had before well cutting right to the bone here the
[1:15:20.020 --> 1:15:23.780]  establishment in literally hundreds of publications a week and I'm sure you've
[1:15:23.780 --> 1:15:27.780]  noticed this deck is panicking they're saying these conspiracy people are
[1:15:27.780 --> 1:15:32.700]  taking over the whole culture it's crazy no one believes the mainstream media or
[1:15:32.700 --> 1:15:37.580]  the government anymore these people are nuts there's no world government there's
[1:15:37.580 --> 1:15:41.660]  no government drug dealing there's no lying about WMD's and they're only
[1:15:41.660 --> 1:15:47.020]  digging the hole deeper for themselves they can't set the parameters of reality
[1:15:47.020 --> 1:15:51.940]  anymore and and so there's a total loss of confidence in the system and the
[1:15:51.940 --> 1:15:57.020]  system is only resorting to more name-calling and that that old trick of
[1:15:57.020 --> 1:16:01.420]  calling its conspiracy theorist isn't working anymore well yeah I think that's
[1:16:01.420 --> 1:16:05.260]  true I mean starting with the Kennedy assassination where you know you have all
[1:16:05.260 --> 1:16:08.780]  these these the only books they're going to get reviewed by the establishment
[1:16:08.780 --> 1:16:11.700]  media are the ones that come out and say that yeah the Warren Commission was right
[1:16:11.700 --> 1:16:16.980]  and Oswald did it alone but the fact is I think the last figure I saw was 75 to
[1:16:16.980 --> 1:16:20.780]  90% of the American people don't believe that but they know it was some kind of
[1:16:20.780 --> 1:16:25.140]  conspiracy and you start there with this terrible event that really changed the
[1:16:25.140 --> 1:16:30.020]  course of American history back in 1963 and you go on up to today and and you
[1:16:30.020 --> 1:16:34.580]  know the fact is the public is getting wise to this and and and yet the media
[1:16:34.580 --> 1:16:38.100]  of course are going to continue to which are mostly corporate owned as as I'm
[1:16:38.100 --> 1:16:41.460]  sure most of your listeners know are going to continue to promulgate to
[1:16:41.460 --> 1:16:46.580]  promulgate the fact or not the fact but promulgating the notion the false notion
[1:16:46.580 --> 1:16:52.900]  that the none of these things have ever happened now did you work on this book in
[1:16:52.900 --> 1:16:56.340]  the US with Ventura or did you do this down at the beach it seems he told me
[1:16:56.340 --> 1:17:01.140]  you were down there visiting with him in Mexico yeah well both I have been
[1:17:01.140 --> 1:17:04.860]  especially for our first book together we did a lot of that in Mexico I would go
[1:17:04.860 --> 1:17:08.740]  to I have a place there my friends do that I stayed and sometimes in the
[1:17:08.740 --> 1:17:13.180]  winter and and was there for six months for the first book and we would meet
[1:17:13.180 --> 1:17:16.740]  every week and I would interview him and then transcribe the tapes and we put
[1:17:16.740 --> 1:17:20.300]  the book together like that for this book I did more of it in the US because
[1:17:20.300 --> 1:17:24.060]  this is where my files are and then you know I would communicate on the phone
[1:17:24.060 --> 1:17:28.620]  and I would go out to Minneapolis in this case that area where he lives and
[1:17:28.620 --> 1:17:35.940]  we would go over things together when we were shooting conspiracy theory out in
[1:17:35.940 --> 1:17:39.460]  California I came into the hotel and was checking in and Ventura came up
[1:17:39.460 --> 1:17:43.660]  behind me was checking in at the same time and and we were talking and he said
[1:17:43.660 --> 1:17:48.220]  Alex I just got back from Alaska my head is spinning this stuff just gets
[1:17:48.220 --> 1:17:53.500]  deeper and deeper and again I mean Ventura 30 years ago knew about the JFK
[1:17:53.500 --> 1:17:58.540]  situation so it's not like he's just now waking up but to see him opening up to
[1:17:58.540 --> 1:18:02.580]  the full research and really digging into it he told me that when he's down in
[1:18:02.580 --> 1:18:08.940]  Mexico he on average reads 15 books or so and Jesse really is becoming a what
[1:18:08.940 --> 1:18:12.740]  the media would call a conspiracy theorist well I guess that's true of
[1:18:12.740 --> 1:18:16.740]  course you know as he said and I'm sure he'll tell you when you have my leader
[1:18:16.740 --> 1:18:21.300]  in the week you know he's what he wants it is the fact that in a hundred years
[1:18:21.300 --> 1:18:26.260]  from now when people people realize that there was an alternative view then
[1:18:26.260 --> 1:18:30.820]  then what we're getting in the Orwellian history books and you know and
[1:18:30.820 --> 1:18:35.100]  he's very dedicated you know reader I mean he does indeed study he's an
[1:18:35.100 --> 1:18:40.300]  extremely intelligent man he's a very creative thinker clearly you know far
[1:18:40.300 --> 1:18:43.420]  beyond most people who've been in just the wrestling arena otherwise it would
[1:18:43.420 --> 1:18:47.500]  never have been elected governor of Minnesota and and so he really does pay
[1:18:47.500 --> 1:18:53.060]  attention to to to these things and and you know I think is is making a real
[1:18:53.060 --> 1:18:59.460]  difference with putting his views out there well I have a variant on that and
[1:18:59.460 --> 1:19:02.300]  that's what I told Texas Monthly in this month's issue at the end of the
[1:19:02.300 --> 1:19:06.620]  article I don't just want people in a hundred years and that's important I want
[1:19:06.620 --> 1:19:11.900]  people in 20 years because we lay out just how illegitimate and unaccountable
[1:19:11.900 --> 1:19:16.340]  this power structure is globally that as things get worse and worse we put out
[1:19:16.340 --> 1:19:20.620]  an alternative view of what really happened so that people understand the
[1:19:20.620 --> 1:19:23.860]  type of tyranny and corruption we're dealing with so we have a chance to
[1:19:23.860 --> 1:19:27.540]  remove it well of course so do I otherwise there's no reason to do the book
[1:19:27.540 --> 1:19:32.020]  really now I mean you know the book is hopefully gonna catch the attention of
[1:19:32.020 --> 1:19:35.860]  a lot of people and make people think in a different way than maybe they did
[1:19:35.860 --> 1:19:42.340]  before they read it sure I'm hoping that that's true as we speak Dick Russell
[1:19:42.340 --> 1:19:47.860]  co-author researcher with Jesse Ventura on the new already bestseller American

[1:24:09.780 --> 1:24:14.900]  Nick Russell, Jesse Ventura, New York Times best-selling author American
[1:24:14.900 --> 1:24:18.740]  conspiracies he's our guest I want to get into different chapters in the book
[1:24:18.740 --> 1:24:21.460]  with you dick today and I appreciate you spending time with us I know you're
[1:24:21.460 --> 1:24:26.260]  busy but I was pretty well actually I wasn't that shocked but when you emailed
[1:24:26.260 --> 1:24:29.500]  us yesterday to let us know and I appreciate you doing that that the
[1:24:29.500 --> 1:24:34.780]  Huffington Post had sent the Ventura article into the Orwellian memory hole
[1:24:34.780 --> 1:24:39.900]  what happened there yeah it was a very bizarre to me very bizarre thing that
[1:24:39.900 --> 1:24:44.180]  happened the Huffington Post had asked for for a series of you know pieces with
[1:24:44.180 --> 1:24:48.180]  to run with excerpts from the book over the next couple of weeks and the first
[1:24:48.180 --> 1:24:53.780]  one was fine it was about you know the whole drug situation and and of course
[1:24:53.780 --> 1:24:58.180]  Jesse has commented publicly that he'd like to see marijuana legalized for
[1:24:58.180 --> 1:25:02.940]  example and you know it would take care of a lot of the problems with that we're
[1:25:02.940 --> 1:25:07.900]  seeing with big money and all of that but what happened with the second piece
[1:25:07.900 --> 1:25:12.780]  the second piece was on was called what really happened on September 11th and the
[1:25:12.780 --> 1:25:17.020]  intro to it was simply reporting the fact and Jesse and I worked on this
[1:25:17.020 --> 1:25:20.140]  together that you know while you didn't say anything about it in the mainstream
[1:25:20.140 --> 1:25:23.980]  media there was this conference in San Francisco a couple weeks ago where more
[1:25:23.980 --> 1:25:27.980]  than a thousand architects and engineers signed a petition demanding that
[1:25:27.980 --> 1:25:32.220]  Congress started new investigation into the destruction of the three the twin
[1:25:32.220 --> 1:25:36.220]  towers and building seven on September 11th okay and then it cuts to an excerpt
[1:25:36.220 --> 1:25:39.460]  from the book getting into the just raising the question you know could
[1:25:39.460 --> 1:25:43.820]  there have been something other than those hijacked planes that brought down
[1:25:43.820 --> 1:25:47.780]  the towers and and could there have been controlled demolition involved okay so
[1:25:47.780 --> 1:25:52.980]  this gets this goes up on the Huffington Post yesterday morning on the front
[1:25:52.980 --> 1:25:58.340]  section picture of me and Jesse and then in the toward the then suddenly later in
[1:25:58.340 --> 1:26:01.860]  the morning it's moved to the back and I went to check it I don't know around
[1:26:01.860 --> 1:26:06.180]  11 o'clock in the morning yesterday and there was this disclaimer and it said
[1:26:06.180 --> 1:26:10.060]  editors note the Huffington Post editorial policy laid out in our blogger
[1:26:10.060 --> 1:26:13.580]  guidelines prohibits the promotion and promulgation of conspiracy theories
[1:26:13.580 --> 1:26:19.140]  including those about 9-11 as such we have removed this post so all it was
[1:26:19.140 --> 1:26:23.100]  left with a 65 comments that had already come in from people in response to it
[1:26:23.100 --> 1:26:28.780]  and you know it really stunned me and made me think wow the Huffington Post I
[1:26:28.780 --> 1:26:33.620]  mean I admire Ariana Huffington and and generally what they do with with this
[1:26:33.620 --> 1:26:37.420]  and even the you know this internet blog is suddenly who's talking to these
[1:26:37.420 --> 1:26:42.660]  people is this order coming down from on high or what's really going on so
[1:26:42.660 --> 1:26:49.100]  Mark Crispin Miller put out the piece and and you know got into the fact of
[1:26:49.100 --> 1:26:52.660]  what what had happened and and I but I was really shocked by it and it just
[1:26:52.660 --> 1:26:56.900]  makes you wonder what how far does all this go I mean you got the mainstream
[1:26:56.900 --> 1:27:00.660]  media which won't even cover any of this stuff certainly will not review the book
[1:27:00.660 --> 1:27:04.740]  and then this happens on the Huffington Post I mean what do you think well there
[1:27:04.740 --> 1:27:10.500]  are peer-reviewed as you know Dick journals of scientists of physicists
[1:27:10.500 --> 1:27:15.060]  going over building sevens collapse NISS has had to admit after years of
[1:27:15.060 --> 1:27:19.180]  denying it it was freefall they say thermal expansion they don't know why
[1:27:19.180 --> 1:27:23.700]  this happened no other steel buildings ever did this you have a thousand
[1:27:23.700 --> 1:27:28.260]  architects and engineers in an international web telecast meeting to put
[1:27:28.260 --> 1:27:32.620]  on their evidence you have depending on how you look at the number two or number
[1:27:32.620 --> 1:27:37.140]  three guy in the Japanese government right under the president of the diet
[1:27:37.140 --> 1:27:41.580]  who we've had on before being demonized in the Washington Post right you have
[1:27:41.580 --> 1:27:45.540]  former German defense minister Andres von Bülow saying clearly this was a
[1:27:45.540 --> 1:27:51.060]  staged event and you have all these questions they can't just come out and
[1:27:51.060 --> 1:27:57.580]  say that oh it's a conspiracy theory wherein depending on the poll 36 to 84
[1:27:57.580 --> 1:28:02.540]  percent in scientific polls it it varies widely don't believe the official
[1:28:02.540 --> 1:28:07.260]  story and you have six of the 10 9-11 commissioners saying that there was a
[1:28:07.260 --> 1:28:11.420]  lot of deception and cover-up that was going on well yeah the 9-11 Commission I
[1:28:11.420 --> 1:28:15.380]  think has been shown even in the recent book by this guy farmer who was part of
[1:28:15.380 --> 1:28:18.740]  it that you know there's a huge cover-up on the level of the Warren
[1:28:18.740 --> 1:28:22.260]  Commission if not worse and you know they that they would only examine the
[1:28:22.260 --> 1:28:26.940]  evidence that led to the conclusion that they had already preconceived and that
[1:28:26.940 --> 1:28:32.020]  the the Bush administration had appointed the Zell account or to run it who was
[1:28:32.020 --> 1:28:37.500]  was you know one of their people I mean you know what's going on I mean you can
[1:28:37.500 --> 1:28:43.820]  if you if you think about it to say that the 9-11 attacks were done by bin
[1:28:43.820 --> 1:28:47.660]  Laden and these are these 19 members of Al Qaeda isn't that a conspiracy theory I
[1:28:47.660 --> 1:28:51.740]  mean we weren't Bush and Cheney putting out a conspiracy theory really I mean it
[1:28:51.740 --> 1:28:56.620]  just makes no sense to me that that the Huffington Post would react this way I
[1:28:56.620 --> 1:29:02.780]  have never in eight years of 9-11 truth seen the media demonizing 9-11 truth
[1:29:02.780 --> 1:29:08.420]  spending more time on 9-11 truth like they are now to the point that I said
[1:29:08.420 --> 1:29:11.020]  in the last three months I believe they're gonna stage attacks on government
[1:29:11.020 --> 1:29:16.260]  buildings that's in Northwoods fake shootings and try to demonize 9-11
[1:29:16.260 --> 1:29:19.820]  truth because they kept saying 9-11 truth is violent and we'd never been
[1:29:19.820 --> 1:29:23.780]  violent and I saw them getting the public ready for it and so while all it
[1:29:23.780 --> 1:29:28.220]  happens but when we come back I want to ask you Dick Russell why is the system
[1:29:28.220 --> 1:29:32.780]  so scared of 9-11 truth and asking questions generally then I want to
[1:29:32.780 --> 1:29:36.780]  walk through some of the chapters in the book and ask you what you think the
[1:29:36.780 --> 1:29:40.940]  best chapters are the most informative or the most well-documented chapters are
[1:29:40.940 --> 1:29:46.140]  in the book he is the co-author of two books with Jesse Ventura and his
[1:29:46.140 --> 1:29:50.740]  latest is American conspiracies he's Dick Russell joining us now long

[1:33:36.620 --> 1:33:42.420]  other evening demonizing 9-11 truth and they said 9-11 truthers claim that the
[1:33:42.420 --> 1:33:47.340]  9-11 Commission says that there were questions but that's not true and they
[1:33:47.340 --> 1:33:52.500]  cut to Lee Hamilton saying no it was quite conclusive everything total lie
[1:33:52.500 --> 1:33:56.860]  six of the ten are in newspapers have written books farmer one of the head
[1:33:56.860 --> 1:34:01.460]  lawyers says it was all a fraud the Pentagon was quote in a criminal cover
[1:34:01.460 --> 1:34:04.620]  up that there should be criminal investigations that's in the Washington
[1:34:04.620 --> 1:34:11.100]  Post but nightline thinks you're so stupid that they sit there and deceive
[1:34:11.100 --> 1:34:16.140]  you and then they showed a clip from American conspiracies author Jesse
[1:34:16.140 --> 1:34:24.300]  Ventura on conspiracy theory his TV show number one on cable above all the
[1:34:24.300 --> 1:34:29.660]  major news shows on all the other cable shows except for Fox number one news
[1:34:29.660 --> 1:34:34.740]  show on true TV number one above all the networks except for Fox really number
[1:34:34.740 --> 1:34:38.940]  two overall but number one for a new show out of the gates and maybe Ventura
[1:34:38.940 --> 1:34:42.020]  will have news for us on the TV show whether it's been picked up I mean I
[1:34:42.020 --> 1:34:46.620]  know but I'm not going to say he probably won't say so we'll just leave it
[1:34:46.620 --> 1:34:51.260]  till we'll leave the good news or the bad news whatever the news is for the
[1:34:51.260 --> 1:34:56.740]  future but but that's why the system is losing so much credibility because many
[1:34:56.740 --> 1:35:00.500]  Americans have read 9-11 commissioners saying there was a cover-up there were
[1:35:00.500 --> 1:35:05.180]  lies dick I mean doesn't the system understand what they're doing to
[1:35:05.180 --> 1:35:09.980]  themselves with this type of continued deceit and in the piece they demonized
[1:35:09.980 --> 1:35:14.500]  Ventura saying these conspiracy theories are getting so popular even Jesse
[1:35:14.500 --> 1:35:21.860]  Ventura is doing it well you know yes sir yes you're it doesn't surprise me I
[1:35:21.860 --> 1:35:29.660]  mean you got to figure that that that you know that me my phone is seems to be
[1:35:29.660 --> 1:35:35.220]  losing its juice here but I can use yeah I can hear you dick do you have a
[1:35:35.220 --> 1:35:44.380]  landline you can pick up let me this is the only landline I've got Alex if you
[1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:51.940]  call me back in in let's see what should we do I'm gonna put you on hold and let
[1:35:51.940 --> 1:35:56.340]  you handle with my producers okay thank you thank you that's why when I get set
[1:35:56.340 --> 1:35:58.820]  up to be a guest on coast to coast to him or something even though I've been
[1:35:58.820 --> 1:36:03.860]  going on for five years six years they will say you're on a landline correct
[1:36:03.860 --> 1:36:10.580]  and you're on a not a not a cordless because number one cordless is don't
[1:36:10.580 --> 1:36:15.900]  have as good audio and they run out on you on air so that's a 101 that we ask
[1:36:15.900 --> 1:36:22.860]  guest and then we will avert many of these problems but regardless it's
[1:36:22.860 --> 1:36:28.060]  technology and this is just what goes on seems like phone quality and electronics
[1:36:28.060 --> 1:36:36.580]  quality just keeps going down and down and down as a society let me go ahead
[1:36:36.580 --> 1:36:43.180]  since we're doing this now and shift gears into some other subjects Jesse
[1:36:43.180 --> 1:36:50.460]  Ventura again will be joining us for a full hour off a hard line from his home
[1:36:50.460 --> 1:37:05.100]  in Minnesota on Friday okay continuing it's not just the censorship of Jesse
[1:37:05.100 --> 1:37:08.020]  Ventura's article it's not just the calls for internet censorship it's just
[1:37:08.020 --> 1:37:14.940]  not the distributed denial of service attack that we were under yesterday and
[1:37:14.940 --> 1:37:20.700]  continuing into today there is an attempt as Cass Sunstein at the White
[1:37:20.700 --> 1:37:26.220]  House says to restrict free speech period and that's because the system now
[1:37:26.220 --> 1:37:30.420]  admits that quote conspiracy theories are taking over it's not conspiracy
[1:37:30.420 --> 1:37:35.180]  theories it's a loss of confidence in the system from lies about WMD's and
[1:37:35.180 --> 1:37:40.620]  lies about banker bailouts and stolen elections and the CIA crashing airplanes
[1:37:40.620 --> 1:37:45.500]  full of pure cocaine in Mexico the people know the truth we've got dick
[1:37:45.500 --> 1:37:49.420]  Russell back dick you you heard the point I was making before your phone
[1:37:49.420 --> 1:37:55.900]  cut out about again the system really seems to be panicking right now well
[1:37:55.900 --> 1:38:00.900]  yeah I mean there's good reason for it I mean people are finally starting to
[1:38:00.900 --> 1:38:05.700]  wake up and realize that indeed if the Bush administration would take us under
[1:38:05.700 --> 1:38:10.940]  false pretenses into the war in Iraq obviously in 2000 the Supreme Court
[1:38:10.940 --> 1:38:14.900]  handed them the election and there was a lot more going on than that a lot of
[1:38:14.900 --> 1:38:19.740]  questions being raised about September 11th and whether at the very least I
[1:38:19.740 --> 1:38:24.020]  mean all the warnings at least we know that publicly that the mainstream
[1:38:24.020 --> 1:38:28.260]  media couldn't avoid that that the there were so many warnings coming in that
[1:38:28.260 --> 1:38:31.780]  something was going to happen that were cheap completely ignored by the Bush
[1:38:31.780 --> 1:38:36.900]  people whether they then orchestrated it of course that's a taboo question but
[1:38:36.900 --> 1:38:39.940]  very much an open question in my mind but the fact is that most of the
[1:38:39.940 --> 1:38:44.180]  corporate media will not look at these things just as they've never looked at
[1:38:44.180 --> 1:38:47.980]  the earlier assassinations and whether there were more than Oswald and
[1:38:47.980 --> 1:38:52.420]  Sirhan and James Earl Ray and involved and and that's what the course we're
[1:38:52.420 --> 1:38:56.060]  trying to do in American conspiracies is bring these things more into the light
[1:38:56.060 --> 1:39:00.140]  and at least to have people thinking about it and raising questions that
[1:39:00.140 --> 1:39:05.420]  you're just not going to see done in the mainstream media so where do you see
[1:39:05.420 --> 1:39:09.100]  this going as more and more of the public discover they've been lied to and
[1:39:09.100 --> 1:39:13.140]  the establishment media and government and corporate line is you're a
[1:39:13.140 --> 1:39:17.380]  conspiracy theorist well I think things are getting are getting more and more
[1:39:17.380 --> 1:39:21.860]  polarized I mean people really should be calling for new investigations into
[1:39:21.860 --> 1:39:25.900]  what happened I'm not saying that there's going to be a legitimate
[1:39:25.900 --> 1:39:31.220]  response to this but if enough people do it and you know are ready to take to
[1:39:31.220 --> 1:39:35.460]  the well I would say take to the streets you know for for some kind of real
[1:39:35.460 --> 1:39:40.020]  action and to get the truth out about what's what what we've been told and
[1:39:40.020 --> 1:39:44.020]  also you know in terms of getting out there and pushing for the health care
[1:39:44.020 --> 1:39:47.100]  reform for doing something about global warming all these things I believe
[1:39:47.100 --> 1:39:51.700]  should be getting much more of a citizen response and right now I guess we're
[1:39:51.700 --> 1:39:56.500]  just all many of us are too comfortable to do it but I think people's eyes are
[1:39:56.500 --> 1:40:00.380]  being opened and you know it's going to get interesting in the next few years
[1:40:00.380 --> 1:40:05.420]  we'll see dick separately you know Jesse did an investigation of supposed
[1:40:05.420 --> 1:40:09.220]  man-made global warming and he believed in it as well like you just said you do
[1:40:09.220 --> 1:40:14.620]  and that's fine you're welcome to your your research in your opinion but then
[1:40:14.620 --> 1:40:19.220]  he did find massive evidence of them cooking the books and climate gator you
[1:40:19.220 --> 1:40:24.140]  concerned about that well here's what I'm concerned about I you know I'm more
[1:40:24.140 --> 1:40:27.860]  much more concerned about the the fact that a lot of these big oil and coal
[1:40:27.860 --> 1:40:32.940]  companies have bought and paid scientific experts you know who are coming
[1:40:32.940 --> 1:40:36.940]  out and claiming that that the very strong evidence that the international
[1:40:36.940 --> 1:40:41.180]  panel for climate change and others that have have come to that that it's very
[1:40:41.180 --> 1:40:44.940]  real but they've bought these guys they're they're hired guns and to me
[1:40:44.940 --> 1:40:48.660]  that's a much bigger conspiracy I mean you know I don't believe in cap and
[1:40:48.660 --> 1:40:53.180]  trade legislation or a solution is going to is going to make that much of a
[1:40:53.180 --> 1:40:57.500]  difference and yes I've read and certainly companies like Goldman Sachs
[1:40:57.500 --> 1:41:00.820]  are planning to make a killing off this and I'm I'm opposed to that I don't
[1:41:00.820 --> 1:41:05.940]  think it's a real solution but you know it is it is a very real situation and
[1:41:05.940 --> 1:41:10.020]  something that we got to be a be hip to and and looking to do something about
[1:41:10.020 --> 1:41:13.980]  dick Russell co-author with Jesse Ventura of don't start the revolution
[1:41:13.980 --> 1:41:17.580]  without me a New York Times bestseller and already a bestseller only
[1:41:17.580 --> 1:41:24.780]  officially out since Monday so we're three days in American conspiracy dick
[1:41:24.780 --> 1:41:29.020]  bottom line we do have serious environmental crises from my research
[1:41:29.020 --> 1:41:33.140]  like genetic engineering open-air planning of these pharmacological crops
[1:41:33.140 --> 1:41:37.820]  but I see nothing being done about that instead a called a tax carbon dioxide
[1:41:37.820 --> 1:41:44.580]  that plants breathe but it expanding on the book there's so many alternate views
[1:41:44.580 --> 1:41:51.180]  of history so much evidence of government lies in a many of the pillars of
[1:41:51.180 --> 1:41:57.860]  historical development how did you guys pick the 14 chapters that you wrote
[1:41:57.860 --> 1:42:04.980]  about the book well I think they were the most clear example of cover-up and
[1:42:04.980 --> 1:42:10.700]  of major events that have changed the course of our American history and you
[1:42:10.700 --> 1:42:13.420]  know what we could have looked at other things we could have taken on maybe you
[1:42:13.420 --> 1:42:16.300]  have follows or you know I'm not saying that there's there are not other
[1:42:16.300 --> 1:42:20.900]  important subjects to be looked at but these seems like the ones that that
[1:42:20.900 --> 1:42:24.980]  really make a huge difference in all our lives and for example the stolen
[1:42:24.980 --> 1:42:32.140]  elections of recent years that allowed the Bush administration to turn and from
[1:42:32.140 --> 1:42:35.300]  my research it doesn't matter whether you see yourself as a conservative or
[1:42:35.300 --> 1:42:40.060]  liberal if an election is stolen it's stolen and there's no doubt the 2000
[1:42:40.060 --> 1:42:46.420]  2004 elections were rigged let's talk about that chapter in the book yeah I
[1:42:46.420 --> 1:42:50.340]  think that chapter has some of the the new evidence that's really going to be
[1:42:50.340 --> 1:42:55.060]  compelling to people you know I'll tell you a personal story I I ran into John
[1:42:55.060 --> 1:43:00.940]  Kerry of course he ran for president in 2004 at a at a fundraiser thing in
[1:43:00.940 --> 1:43:04.140]  Boston and I I talked to him for a little bit and I asked him if he was
[1:43:04.140 --> 1:43:08.140]  aware because I had done a piece with Bobby Kennedy Jr. in Enrolling Stone
[1:43:08.140 --> 1:43:12.940]  about about the electronic voting machines and the theft of the election
[1:43:12.940 --> 1:43:16.860]  and and he said I know I won the election but by the time my lawyers he went on
[1:43:16.860 --> 1:43:21.780]  could come up with a smoking gun in Ohio it was too late so you know I thought
[1:43:21.780 --> 1:43:25.900]  after that was well if Kerry knows this and how come he's never spoken out
[1:43:25.900 --> 1:43:29.060]  publicly about it I mean it wouldn't this be something that you'd at least want
[1:43:29.060 --> 1:43:33.780]  the American people to know in my research into this and working with
[1:43:33.780 --> 1:43:39.300]  Governor Ventura on it we came across this this really interesting story of a
[1:43:39.300 --> 1:43:44.300]  guy named Michael Connell who was the IT guy the computer guy the expert for
[1:43:44.300 --> 1:43:51.540]  Carl Rowe for some years and strong evidence and I interviewed several people
[1:43:51.540 --> 1:43:55.700]  about this and there's a lawsuit in Ohio that bring brought him into it as well
[1:43:55.700 --> 1:44:02.660]  that he was directly involved in rigging the 2004 election in Ohio with
[1:44:02.660 --> 1:44:06.060]  which of course decided the election and then you had Secretary of State
[1:44:06.060 --> 1:44:09.700]  Blackwell who was very much involved with the Bush people and in doing this
[1:44:09.700 --> 1:44:14.660]  and that they had this I'm not going to get into all the details of computer you
[1:44:14.660 --> 1:44:17.980]  know what they call a man in the middle plan but they had this whole system set
[1:44:17.980 --> 1:44:22.980]  up where they could they could send the votes from the various Ohio precincts
[1:44:22.980 --> 1:44:27.420]  or districts to a voting machine out in Chattanooga, Tennessee run by another
[1:44:27.420 --> 1:44:32.460]  operative they could have apparently been then for sending this on to even to the
[1:44:32.460 --> 1:44:36.060]  war room in the White House but they were changing votes that night and
[1:44:36.060 --> 1:44:40.380]  that changing them in such a way that Bush was going to win Ohio at least to
[1:44:40.380 --> 1:44:44.900]  technically speaking and this guy Connell continued to work for the
[1:44:44.900 --> 1:44:52.420]  Republican Party and as late as 2008 not too long before the election he was
[1:44:52.420 --> 1:44:57.700]  called before this called into court to give a deposition in this case that
[1:44:57.700 --> 1:45:03.620]  had been brought by some people in Ohio about what had happened there and he
[1:45:03.620 --> 1:45:09.380]  was stonewalling to some degree but apparently ready to talk and there's
[1:45:09.380 --> 1:45:14.540]  pretty strong indications that Carl Rowe who was saying a week before the 2008
[1:45:14.540 --> 1:45:19.900]  election that McCain still pulled this out that when Connell was
[1:45:19.900 --> 1:45:25.380]  called in to give a deposition the day before the election that they decided
[1:45:25.380 --> 1:45:29.100]  hey wait a minute you know we can't go forward with this plus Obama's probably
[1:45:29.100 --> 1:45:33.660]  got too big a lead if we if we try to steal this one too with Connell and
[1:45:33.660 --> 1:45:36.460]  others but if we're going to the computers we're going to be found out
[1:45:36.460 --> 1:45:40.820]  but so suddenly the night before Rowe wrote a column indicating saying that
[1:45:40.820 --> 1:45:45.700]  no Obama is going to win by a relative landslide so there was a there was a
[1:45:45.700 --> 1:45:49.540]  possibility they were going to try to steal that election too and then what
[1:45:49.540 --> 1:45:52.820]  happens to Mike Connell about a month later and he's flying back in his
[1:45:52.820 --> 1:45:56.940]  private plane from Washington DC to Ohio where he lived and the plane goes
[1:45:56.940 --> 1:46:02.620]  down under very suspicious circumstances and Connell is killed so rack that up
[1:46:02.620 --> 1:46:06.540]  with another mysterious death in this whole process of which there have been
[1:46:06.540 --> 1:46:12.580]  many you know dating back to the Kennedy assassination service absolutely let's
[1:46:12.580 --> 1:46:17.140]  get into some of the other sections your government is dealing drugs that's a
[1:46:17.140 --> 1:46:22.780]  bold statement but it's it's absolutely part of historical fact even the 1996
[1:46:22.780 --> 1:46:27.980]  CIA Inspector General testified to Congress that was the case and the
[1:46:27.980 --> 1:46:32.580]  crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s but let's get into that chapter a little
[1:46:32.580 --> 1:46:37.500]  bit here yeah well it really goes back you know to the to the formation of the
[1:46:37.500 --> 1:46:42.740]  CIA and and bringing heroin out of Southeast Asia to fund are there a lot
[1:46:42.740 --> 1:46:46.780]  of their activities working with the big mafia drug lords like Lucky Luciano back
[1:46:46.780 --> 1:46:50.180]  during World War two when they were still the OSS then of course during
[1:46:50.180 --> 1:46:54.660]  Vietnam there was this whole Golden Triangle in Southeast Asia where again a
[1:46:54.660 --> 1:47:00.340]  lot of money for covert operations was was being you know funneled through and
[1:47:00.340 --> 1:47:04.860]  also making some private fortunes for for some of the agency people places like
[1:47:04.860 --> 1:47:08.300]  the Nugent Hand Bank for example my people might remember that they were
[1:47:08.300 --> 1:47:12.980]  channeling funds through that bank for covert ops the all drug money and then
[1:47:12.980 --> 1:47:17.900]  the Iran Contra years it's public record that although they didn't want to get
[1:47:17.900 --> 1:47:21.620]  into it too much in those Iran Contra hearings which by the way Lee Hamilton
[1:47:21.620 --> 1:47:25.820]  was one of the chairs of the guy who ended up chairing the 9-11 Commission
[1:47:25.820 --> 1:47:30.540]  Iran Contra fair was was very much involved with the Contras you know
[1:47:30.540 --> 1:47:35.500]  being funneled or being funded by by drug money that the Oliver North and
[1:47:35.500 --> 1:47:39.140]  others were helping raise for them so you know I mean this has been going on a
[1:47:39.140 --> 1:47:43.300]  long time and Gary Webb people may remember him he's the journalist who
[1:47:43.300 --> 1:47:49.220]  broke the story in the San Jose Mercury news about the the crack you know a
[1:47:49.220 --> 1:47:54.100]  connection and he had a new book coming out of the vindicating everything he
[1:47:54.100 --> 1:47:57.700]  previously said so they shotgun him twice in the head and the local police
[1:47:57.700 --> 1:48:02.820]  said it was suicide that's right well Gary Webb was found dead I don't know
[1:48:02.820 --> 1:48:07.780]  the details of it but but yeah it was it was allegedly suicide and of course he
[1:48:07.780 --> 1:48:11.860]  was before that the media just destroyed him you know it came out and did this
[1:48:11.860 --> 1:48:16.020]  whole series of articles that that he was supposedly blowing smoke and and you
[1:48:16.020 --> 1:48:19.140]  know the fact is that he'd come out with something that was absolutely right on
[1:48:19.140 --> 1:48:24.180]  that the drug gangs and in LA were very involved with the with the CIA with this
[1:48:24.180 --> 1:48:29.140]  thing and you know then you had the whole BCCI the Bank of Crooks and
[1:48:29.140 --> 1:48:33.940]  Criminals really scandal and a little bit later and right up to today where
[1:48:33.940 --> 1:48:39.660]  where you've got a situation where in Afghanistan biggest you know opium
[1:48:39.660 --> 1:48:44.500]  growing area in the world for heroin coming into this country
[1:48:44.500 --> 1:48:49.140]  Pakistani intelligence service being very involved along with the president's
[1:48:49.140 --> 1:48:53.940]  brother in Afghanistan with the drug trade and of course Mexico where you
[1:48:53.940 --> 1:48:58.420]  know we're supposedly fighting this this war on drugs but the fact fact is
[1:48:58.420 --> 1:49:02.940]  that you know how many people have been killed between December 2006 and the
[1:49:02.940 --> 1:49:07.340]  spring of 2009 more than 10,000 people were killed in those drug wars in
[1:49:07.340 --> 1:49:13.700]  Mexico and you know they I mean this and this is all about again a lot of
[1:49:13.700 --> 1:49:16.460]  people look in the other way while fighting over the turf I mean you've
[1:49:16.460 --> 1:49:20.220]  got that and that's what's so incredible about this book I mean I study this
[1:49:20.220 --> 1:49:25.340]  stuff constantly and I find most books you know boring or not accurate
[1:49:25.340 --> 1:49:30.740]  information this is really gold information this is blue chip writing
[1:49:30.740 --> 1:49:35.940]  that we're talking about here and and it's it's again so bold I mean you're
[1:49:35.940 --> 1:49:39.180]  learning about how they kill a lot of people that prominently oppose them I
[1:49:39.180 --> 1:49:45.140]  would imagine you've gotten the willies a few times or you know the chills have
[1:49:45.140 --> 1:49:47.980]  you ever gotten spooked dick knowing you were writing this book and it was
[1:49:47.980 --> 1:49:51.420]  coming out because you get into the Wall Street conspiracy ripping everybody
[1:49:51.420 --> 1:49:56.740]  off by design you get into the secret plan to destroy democracy freedom here
[1:49:56.740 --> 1:49:59.980]  in the United States with the shadow government and continuity of government
[1:49:59.980 --> 1:50:06.460]  I mean this book covers it all well yeah it doesn't and yes it's it's I wouldn't
[1:50:06.460 --> 1:50:11.460]  say it makes me rest easy to have put it out there but you know I feel that the
[1:50:11.460 --> 1:50:15.820]  truth is important and the truth is based on a lot of facts that are out
[1:50:15.820 --> 1:50:20.220]  there that somebody needed to put together and and you know I back I wrote
[1:50:20.220 --> 1:50:23.820]  two books on the Kennedy assassination and spent a number of years researching
[1:50:23.820 --> 1:50:28.060]  that and and back in those days in the 1970s especially yeah I know I was
[1:50:28.060 --> 1:50:33.140]  swallowed by the CIA and other people and you know I'm not a paranoid type of
[1:50:33.140 --> 1:50:36.940]  person but this is what happened you know I should have talked more about you
[1:50:36.940 --> 1:50:41.060]  today while you were with us I mean yeah you're one of the most well researched
[1:50:41.060 --> 1:50:45.460]  and respected JFK researchers out there I actually read one of your books
[1:50:45.460 --> 1:50:49.180]  something like 10 years ago I'd even forgotten that I mean I knew that you
[1:50:49.180 --> 1:50:52.700]  were a JFK researcher and author but it's just you've got such a huge body of
[1:50:52.700 --> 1:50:57.220]  work and now another book American conspiracies with Dick Russell available

[1:54:11.620 --> 1:54:15.340]  dick Russell on separately for a full hour sometime just on his JFK
[1:54:15.340 --> 1:54:19.540]  investigation because if they're lying about 9-11 lying about JFK lying about
[1:54:19.540 --> 1:54:24.380]  government drug dealing what else are they not lying about another line about
[1:54:24.380 --> 1:54:28.020]  basically everything I mean it's come out government documents that I've had
[1:54:28.020 --> 1:54:33.780]  the army watching me Ron Paul but they go to our events and spy on us that
[1:54:33.780 --> 1:54:39.340]  Homeland Security spying on even little churches mainline groups
[1:54:39.340 --> 1:54:46.340]  Co-and-Tel Pro that came out in the 70s all of this is going on today and finish
[1:54:46.340 --> 1:54:49.900]  up talking about some of the things that happened to you when you were writing
[1:54:49.900 --> 1:54:58.220]  treatises on JFK well I had a guy named Richard Nagel who was a CIA had been a
[1:54:58.220 --> 1:55:03.060]  CIA contract agent and and also worked for the Russians and he was one of my
[1:55:03.060 --> 1:55:06.980]  main sources and never told me everything he knew but told me enough and
[1:55:06.980 --> 1:55:11.180]  oh I got it's a long story but I get we can talk about it some other time on the
[1:55:11.180 --> 1:55:16.500]  air but well toward the end of 1995 anyway he was found dead the very day
[1:55:16.500 --> 1:55:19.660]  that a subpoena from the assassination records review board appeared in his
[1:55:19.660 --> 1:55:24.900]  mailbox and and that took me up a great deal because I had just given us a talk
[1:55:24.900 --> 1:55:28.020]  the week before that the review board had listened to and then decided to
[1:55:28.020 --> 1:55:32.180]  subpoena him and all his records and interview him and suddenly he's he's no
[1:55:32.180 --> 1:55:36.380]  longer with us and so man obviously things things like that happening give
[1:55:36.380 --> 1:55:44.580]  one pause absolutely in fact we forget what was it 78 that Congress found a
[1:55:44.580 --> 1:55:49.580]  probable conspiracy they said 98% didn't they well yeah they came out
[1:55:49.580 --> 1:55:53.620]  with an official published report that there was a probable conspiracy to the
[1:55:53.620 --> 1:55:56.820]  assassinate president Kennedy directly contradicting the Warren Commission
[1:55:56.820 --> 1:56:01.140]  oh you wouldn't know that today because you know Bibliosi comes out with his
[1:56:01.140 --> 1:56:05.140]  book big book saying the Warren Commission was right and that's the book
[1:56:05.140 --> 1:56:09.300]  that gets all the review attention along with the Posner's book conspiracy books
[1:56:09.300 --> 1:56:12.980]  quote-unquote don't even get reviewed by the mainstream media I don't think
[1:56:12.980 --> 1:56:17.300]  either of my books was ever given a big review so you know that's just the way
[1:56:17.300 --> 1:56:22.900]  it is and it has to happen by by word of mouth really and people talk to their
[1:56:22.900 --> 1:56:25.460]  neighbors and saying hey you you want to know the truth about what happened to
[1:56:25.460 --> 1:56:31.300]  check this out yeah well you've certainly risk your life and I'm gonna ask
[1:56:31.300 --> 1:56:37.020]  Ventura question Friday I've never asked him and I'm gonna ask you this now on
[1:56:37.020 --> 1:56:41.260]  record because I told the DC madam to do this on record on air and she said on
[1:56:41.260 --> 1:56:45.300]  record I'll never commit suicide she told her landlord I'm being tracked they
[1:56:45.300 --> 1:56:49.780]  may try to kill me they did let me let's get it on record dick you're never
[1:56:49.780 --> 1:56:53.780]  planning to commit suicide no I'm not that's absolutely right I would never
[1:56:53.780 --> 1:56:59.940]  plan it to commit suicide and so if they find you with a God forbid a empty
[1:56:59.940 --> 1:57:05.300]  bottle of sleeping pills are I mean that was they killed you I would say
[1:57:05.300 --> 1:57:10.340]  that's true hopefully that won't happen well you you know reading some of the
[1:57:10.340 --> 1:57:15.460]  people originally involved in in the JFK criminal investigation down in
[1:57:15.460 --> 1:57:19.900]  Louisiana Garrison and others they did make the point it's important on record
[1:57:19.900 --> 1:57:25.060]  to stay public to stay visible and to tell people I'm not planning to kill
[1:57:25.060 --> 1:57:30.900]  myself and I want to say that today about Alex Jones because you know it
[1:57:30.900 --> 1:57:34.900]  seems like 30 years ago they did pretty much kill everybody that criticized him
[1:57:34.900 --> 1:57:38.860]  now they don't kill as many people I think because they realize that whack-a-mole
[1:57:38.860 --> 1:57:43.820]  technique isn't working anymore dick well that could be and they certainly 30
[1:57:43.820 --> 1:57:47.500]  years ago they killed David Ferry in the Garrison investigation in George DeMoren
[1:57:47.500 --> 1:57:52.340]  Shield as opposed to a side in in when the House committee was just about to
[1:57:52.340 --> 1:57:57.580]  interview him and he'd been Oswald's buddy and handler I interviewed DeMoren
[1:57:57.580 --> 1:58:02.300]  Shield a couple of times and at one point I remember his wife calling it
[1:58:02.300 --> 1:58:05.780]  screaming out well we of course we know it was a vast conspiracy they didn't
[1:58:05.780 --> 1:58:11.140]  ever elaborate however and he was never allowed to we're about to go to break
[1:58:11.140 --> 1:58:14.980]  into five more minutes with you but separately we actually first had the
[1:58:14.980 --> 1:58:18.900]  audio tape and aired it here Rolling Stone covered the transcript what do you
[1:58:18.900 --> 1:58:24.300]  think of E Howard Hunt's deathbed confession you know I don't really know
[1:58:24.300 --> 1:58:28.140]  what to make of it exactly because Howard Hunt is somebody that I never put a
[1:58:28.140 --> 1:58:33.020]  lot of stock in whether he was gonna be telling the truth or writing another
[1:58:33.020 --> 1:58:36.860]  fiction novel of which he wrote many and he worked at a CIA for a lot of years and
[1:58:36.860 --> 1:58:43.020]  certainly involved in the watergate stay there got a break got a break thank

[1:59:12.940 --> 1:59:16.900]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[1:59:16.900 --> 1:59:21.060]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather

[2:00:45.620 --> 2:00:51.140]  back on just about JFK in the next few months but separately here real quick a
[2:00:51.140 --> 2:00:55.940]  few of the other chapters the Wall Street conspiracy and chapter 13 and
[2:00:55.940 --> 2:01:01.900]  chapter 14 the secret plans to end American democracy yeah well you know
[2:01:01.900 --> 2:01:05.740]  the wall with star with the Wall Street one I mean that was really doing
[2:01:05.740 --> 2:01:10.180]  research into just what happened a little over a year ago and when the big
[2:01:10.180 --> 2:01:15.020]  bailout went down and how come Goldman Sachs and AIG got away with murder
[2:01:15.020 --> 2:01:20.700]  basically and it looks like things like AIG's ties to the CIA going way back
[2:01:20.700 --> 2:01:26.660]  into the you know into the 1940s and and beyond and and Goldman Sachs very
[2:01:26.660 --> 2:01:32.940]  mysterious stuff too the secret plans to destroy American democracy you know
[2:01:32.940 --> 2:01:37.460]  it's there for people to to put the pieces together which is what Governor
[2:01:37.460 --> 2:01:42.060]  Ventura and I tried to do with this chapter get them to certain things that
[2:01:42.060 --> 2:01:46.460]  went on the books during the Bush years especially the continuity of government
[2:01:46.460 --> 2:01:53.740]  plans for martial law something called end game which you know again as part of
[2:01:53.740 --> 2:01:59.060]  the whole land security I love these code names you know vibrant response and
[2:01:59.060 --> 2:02:04.140]  Excalibur and I wonder you know who's making this stuff up and end game into
[2:02:04.140 --> 2:02:08.980]  the Republic is that's what it spells out that an incredible book briefly the
[2:02:08.980 --> 2:02:18.180]  Malcolm X chapter amazing or the conspiracy by the CIA against Nixon
[2:02:18.180 --> 2:02:22.860]  yeah well the conspiracy by the CIA against Nixon was with a fascinating
[2:02:22.860 --> 2:02:27.780]  thing to look at because so many of the players in the Kennedy assassination
[2:02:27.780 --> 2:02:33.620]  come up again in the Watergate days and Nixon of course talking about quote the
[2:02:33.620 --> 2:02:38.060]  whole day of big thing in all of those tapes including the smoking gun tape
[2:02:38.060 --> 2:02:41.900]  that's really an acronym according to Haldeman his chief of staff for the
[2:02:41.900 --> 2:02:45.860]  Kennedy assassination and Nixon wanted to know what does the CIA know about the
[2:02:45.860 --> 2:02:49.340]  assassination now why he wanted to know that was it because he had some
[2:02:49.340 --> 2:02:52.740]  involvement in it he wanted to know what they had on him or was it because he
[2:02:52.740 --> 2:02:56.340]  wanted to have the goods on the CIA I don't know the answer to that but well
[2:02:56.340 --> 2:02:59.340]  we know he was in Dallas and it looks like his fingerprints were on it but go
[2:02:59.340 --> 2:03:03.180]  ahead well yeah I mean he was there for a Pepsi Cola bottlers convention and
[2:03:03.180 --> 2:03:07.740]  before that he worked on the CIA mafia plots to get rid of Castro and when he
[2:03:07.740 --> 2:03:11.820]  was in the Eisenhower administration so how much Nick when did Nixon know what
[2:03:11.820 --> 2:03:16.780]  Nixon when did he know it is very much a an open question but I laid out the
[2:03:16.780 --> 2:03:21.300]  evidence in that chapter as to how all of this seems to tie back a lot of it
[2:03:21.300 --> 2:03:27.460]  anyway to September November 22nd 1963 and and Nixon's attempt to get at the
[2:03:27.460 --> 2:03:32.180]  CIA records on this and the CIA then going after Nixon in retribution and a
[2:03:32.180 --> 2:03:35.340]  lot of you know the burglary was a setup I mean whether they left the tape on the
[2:03:35.340 --> 2:03:39.860]  door the court had worked for the agency so it hunt they were obviously trying to
[2:03:39.860 --> 2:03:46.580]  uh... lady and lady I mean you know this this thing was not what it was made to
[2:03:46.580 --> 2:03:51.900]  appear whether the woodward Bernstein thing is is but what we would like to
[2:03:51.900 --> 2:03:55.820]  believe I don't know I mean people you know the Washington Post is an organ of
[2:03:55.820 --> 2:04:01.260]  the CIA yeah well certainly they've had their ties over the years and so of the
[2:04:01.260 --> 2:04:06.340]  New York Times so of Life Magazine I mean let's be honest about it and I lay some
[2:04:06.340 --> 2:04:09.300]  of that out in this new book too well dick we're going to have you back in the
[2:04:09.300 --> 2:04:13.260]  next month or so we'll get into the Malcolm X area we'll get into JFK the
[2:04:13.260 --> 2:04:17.020]  murder assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King again we only scratch the

[2:07:04.380 --> 2:07:08.340]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[2:07:08.340 --> 2:07:12.620]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[2:07:12.620 --> 2:07:16.900]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[2:07:16.900 --> 2:07:21.220]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[2:07:21.220 --> 2:07:25.180]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:07:25.180 --> 2:07:29.900]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[2:07:29.900 --> 2:07:33.980]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[2:07:33.980 --> 2:07:37.980]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[2:07:37.980 --> 2:07:41.780]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[2:07:41.780 --> 2:07:44.500]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from

[2:08:10.100 --> 2:08:15.780]  okay I'm gonna get it is some very important news right now and we're
[2:08:15.780 --> 2:08:17.740]  gonna open the phones up throughout the hour
[2:08:17.740 --> 2:08:23.100]  jebra griffin is joining us next hour we are live it is the 10th day of march
[2:08:23.100 --> 2:08:32.540]  2010 on this Wednesday edition I want to read this article or much of it that
[2:08:32.540 --> 2:08:40.900]  Paul Watson has written perversion is fine so long as you're in a position of
[2:08:40.900 --> 2:08:46.940]  authority is the prison planet dot com headline schools can install cameras in
[2:08:46.940 --> 2:08:54.500]  bathrooms and spy on kids via laptops but parents treated as pedophiles for
[2:08:54.500 --> 2:09:00.620]  taking innocent photographs of their own children yet another story about a
[2:09:00.620 --> 2:09:04.900]  school installing surveillance cameras in bathrooms reminds us that while
[2:09:04.900 --> 2:09:08.380]  parents are treated as pedophiles for taking photographs of their own
[2:09:08.380 --> 2:09:12.900]  children any perversion whatsoever is acceptable as long as it's conducted by
[2:09:12.900 --> 2:09:18.380]  those deemed to be in a position of authority headline sky television news
[2:09:18.380 --> 2:09:22.580]  that's fox in England outraged parents have hit out at a school in
[2:09:22.580 --> 2:09:29.180]  Birmingham after pupils discovered cctv cameras in bathroom toilets and the
[2:09:29.180 --> 2:09:36.100]  u.s. they're in showers youngsters at grace academy in Clemsley wood claim they
[2:09:36.100 --> 2:09:40.100]  returned from half term to find staff had installed the cameras without
[2:09:40.100 --> 2:09:44.100]  notifying them and their parents and always comes out well we don't have to
[2:09:44.100 --> 2:09:49.060]  tell your stinking parents the report points to another recent case in Britain
[2:09:49.060 --> 2:09:54.540]  were to school in solford film children in various stages of undress changing in
[2:09:54.540 --> 2:10:01.340]  their gym kit and I guess that's the British word for their gym locker
[2:10:01.340 --> 2:10:08.020]  continues here parents slam the move as a total invasion of privacy and many
[2:10:08.020 --> 2:10:11.100]  students refused to use the bathroom but the school claimed that installing
[2:10:11.100 --> 2:10:14.420]  cameras to watch children in the most intimate setting possible was perfectly
[2:10:14.420 --> 2:10:19.620]  normal because children want to feel secure with the big fat perverts watching
[2:10:19.620 --> 2:10:24.020]  them so as long as it's done in the name of safety and security watching children
[2:10:24.020 --> 2:10:27.180]  in bathrooms is acceptable like the naked body scanners for everybody
[2:10:27.180 --> 2:10:31.180]  perhaps child molesters who are caught with kitty porn should use the defense
[2:10:31.180 --> 2:10:36.140]  that they were merely watching videos of children to make them feel secure but
[2:10:36.140 --> 2:10:40.500]  we're forgetting the golden rule you're only allowed to engage in such behavior
[2:10:40.500 --> 2:10:46.180]  if you happen to be ascribed some position of authority we have reported on
[2:10:46.180 --> 2:10:49.460]  numerous cases of school officials installing cameras in school bathrooms
[2:10:49.460 --> 2:10:54.140]  in the u.s. Canada you name it which also allow perverts to spy on children in
[2:10:54.140 --> 2:10:59.220]  various stages of undress compare this with the case of Kevin guarantee
[2:10:59.220 --> 2:11:04.860]  shwoon a man who dared to take photographs of his own son in public
[2:11:04.860 --> 2:11:09.940]  riding a toy train at the mall
[2:11:10.540 --> 2:11:18.140]  shwan was promptly interrupted by a security thug who accused him of being
[2:11:18.140 --> 2:11:23.220]  a pedophile the man was then approached by police officer and threatened with
[2:11:23.220 --> 2:11:27.620]  arrest for having the temerity to get upset about the situation of course the
[2:11:27.620 --> 2:11:33.020]  fact that shwan and his son were simultaneously being filmed by a
[2:11:33.020 --> 2:11:38.300]  plethora of shopping malls cctv cameras is beside the point big brother is
[2:11:38.300 --> 2:11:42.260]  allowed to watch us but we can't even record our own offspring without being
[2:11:42.260 --> 2:11:47.180]  lectured about how we're potential child molesters by those in petty positions
[2:11:47.180 --> 2:11:51.500]  of authority see the message is the entire public are a bunch of criminal
[2:11:51.500 --> 2:11:57.660]  scum government is good and it's not just school corridors and bathrooms where
[2:11:57.660 --> 2:12:01.380]  kids are being spied on perhaps the most shocking aspect of the recent case in
[2:12:01.380 --> 2:12:05.820]  Philadelphia and then it came out it was everywhere else basically or the school
[2:12:05.820 --> 2:12:10.900]  district issued laptop computers to 1,800 students taxpayer paid for
[2:12:10.900 --> 2:12:17.740]  according to the news across two high schools and then use concealed cameras
[2:12:17.740 --> 2:12:21.860]  within the machines to spy on students and their parents without their
[2:12:21.860 --> 2:12:26.900]  knowledge or consent when they were at home is the fact that school officials
[2:12:26.900 --> 2:12:30.780]  did not attempt to hide the scandal they bragged about it again they're
[2:12:30.780 --> 2:12:34.740]  breaking your will they engage in incredible criminal activity just out
[2:12:34.740 --> 2:12:40.940]  in the open in a PBS news clip the assistant principal in the Philadelphia
[2:12:40.940 --> 2:12:45.780]  case shows a reporter how much to his own amusement he spies on kids via their
[2:12:45.780 --> 2:12:49.900]  laptops and even takes pictures of them and see that's what's so incredible is
[2:12:49.900 --> 2:12:54.100]  the school was bragging I saw what you did in your bedroom last night they
[2:12:54.100 --> 2:12:58.300]  think that's normal they they think we're just gonna accept well okay that
[2:12:58.300 --> 2:13:02.980]  that's fine just like Google announced four years ago yeah we're using the
[2:13:02.980 --> 2:13:06.100]  cameras in your and the microphones built into your computers to watch you
[2:13:06.100 --> 2:13:12.140]  and listen to you they just throw it out there like it's nothing I always like
[2:13:12.140 --> 2:13:21.620]  to mess with them and take a picture chuckles the person and it goes on ladies
[2:13:21.620 --> 2:13:27.620]  and gentlemen with the alarming spectacle if a child molester had been
[2:13:27.620 --> 2:13:31.660]  caught installing software on laptops that enables him to watch and record
[2:13:31.660 --> 2:13:35.740]  children there would be outrage but again when someone in a petty position of
[2:13:35.740 --> 2:13:40.740]  authority does it it's normal and good this cult-like mental illness that
[2:13:40.740 --> 2:13:46.300]  anything done by an authority figure is acceptable strikes at the very root of
[2:13:46.300 --> 2:13:51.220]  everything that's wrong with our society today the broader argument is that
[2:13:51.220 --> 2:13:55.780]  schools across the western world are now beginning to resemble prisons as
[2:13:55.780 --> 2:14:02.180]  children are surveilled policed and even arrested as criminals for the most
[2:14:02.180 --> 2:14:08.500]  benign adolescent behavior like doodling on a desk has happened to a 12-year-old
[2:14:08.500 --> 2:14:14.100]  Queen's student Alexa Gonzalez recently regular drug raids strip searches and
[2:14:14.100 --> 2:14:19.620]  lockdowns all in cul-cate within the school the notion that they are a prison
[2:14:19.620 --> 2:14:27.580]  a prisoner a big brother from an early age continuing anyone who can afford to
[2:14:27.580 --> 2:14:31.460]  get their children out of the school system and place them in a well-run
[2:14:31.460 --> 2:14:36.460]  private school or better yet homeschool their kids would be insane not to do so
[2:14:36.460 --> 2:14:40.860]  in the current climate for those who can't afford to do so you're going to
[2:14:40.860 --> 2:14:44.260]  have to spend a lot of time with your children in an attempt to reverse the
[2:14:44.260 --> 2:14:48.420]  psychological conditioning they are being bombarded with on a daily basis in
[2:14:48.420 --> 2:14:55.340]  the prison camps without bars that now pass for schools in many parts of the
[2:14:55.340 --> 2:15:01.020]  western world I'm going to call Watson in fact get Watson on during the break go
[2:15:01.020 --> 2:15:03.540]  ahead and get him on hold I want to talk to him in four minutes when we go to
[2:15:03.540 --> 2:15:09.940]  break I want him to add on here the naked body scanners and I want him to
[2:15:09.940 --> 2:15:13.220]  also add the Google watching because I really want to promote this article
[2:15:13.220 --> 2:15:15.900]  get it out to everybody because I think it breaks down a lot of what's
[2:15:15.900 --> 2:15:19.300]  happening and as I mentioned earlier here's the United Nations but again
[2:15:19.300 --> 2:15:23.460]  they're playing the part of the good guys airport body scan breaches rights UN
[2:15:23.460 --> 2:15:29.140]  expert says a UN expert on Tuesday said the growing use of full body scanners in
[2:15:29.140 --> 2:15:34.460]  airport security was a breach of individual rights
[2:15:34.460 --> 2:15:45.980]  Martin Schwinnen the UN special rapporteur I guess is the word on the
[2:15:45.980 --> 2:15:50.340]  protection of human rights said that in the fight against terrorism scanners
[2:15:50.340 --> 2:15:58.380]  were both ineffective means of prevention and an excessive intrusion into
[2:15:58.380 --> 2:16:01.820]  individual privacy use of full body scanners which reveal graphic details
[2:16:01.820 --> 2:16:05.900]  of the human body including the most private parts of it very easily is a
[2:16:05.900 --> 2:16:09.260]  violation of human rights he told journalist would be a violation of
[2:16:09.260 --> 2:16:12.580]  human rights in respect to everyone but there are particular sensitivities in
[2:16:12.580 --> 2:16:18.020]  respect to women certain religions certain cultural backgrounds and so it
[2:16:18.020 --> 2:16:22.580]  goes on we got a lot of airline executives saying that they are against
[2:16:22.580 --> 2:16:28.580]  this as well but again we're going to come back from break and start taking
[2:16:28.580 --> 2:16:31.700]  phone calls interspersed with news throughout the rest of the hour before
[2:16:31.700 --> 2:16:36.020]  G ever Griffin joins us the toll-free number to get involved with us on air

[2:17:09.020 --> 2:17:13.620]  parents medical records go online without consent parents confidential
[2:17:13.620 --> 2:17:18.300]  medical records are being placed on a controversial NHS database without their
[2:17:18.300 --> 2:17:22.260]  knowledge doctors and leaders have warned well I mean they take your baby's
[2:17:22.260 --> 2:17:32.140]  blood at birth and don't even tell you what's happening when people like myself
[2:17:32.140 --> 2:17:35.780]  expose it for 14 years they say we're conspiracy theorist and now it's just
[2:17:35.780 --> 2:17:39.300]  all admitted why are they coming out now I want to ask listeners this if the
[2:17:39.300 --> 2:17:41.940]  callers want to comment why are they coming out now and saying we're
[2:17:41.940 --> 2:17:45.620]  watching you with laptops and it's perverted when somebody else does it but
[2:17:45.620 --> 2:17:50.060]  it's not when we do it why are they coming out admitting world government
[2:17:50.060 --> 2:17:53.300]  now why are they coming out admitting they're taking our blood secretly for
[2:17:53.300 --> 2:17:56.740]  DNA databases why are they coming out and taking blood at checkpoints without
[2:17:56.740 --> 2:18:01.580]  warrants suddenly in England and the US why are they suddenly saying they want
[2:18:01.580 --> 2:18:04.580]  to censor the internet why are they suddenly saying they want to force us
[2:18:04.580 --> 2:18:08.660]  to take microchips and first passing laws where your dogs and cats have to
[2:18:08.660 --> 2:18:14.180]  have them all over the country and also in England why are they openly saying
[2:18:14.180 --> 2:18:17.100]  they're going to put all these new taxes on us and don't seem to care that
[2:18:17.100 --> 2:18:20.220]  everybody in every major poll is getting extremely angry we'll be

[2:24:16.860 --> 2:24:23.300]  others but drudge report has linked to us again that will pull up the actual
[2:24:23.300 --> 2:24:27.740]  drudge report show people a shot of that drudge report malware accusation
[2:24:27.740 --> 2:24:35.820]  coincides with cybersecurity agenda and again the sergeant of arms has now
[2:24:35.820 --> 2:24:39.700]  admitted I'm gonna have a note added up here that this was all a line that they
[2:24:39.700 --> 2:24:43.020]  were just told that there was malware on it and it's not on the drudge report
[2:24:43.020 --> 2:24:50.380]  just not true and this is the same thing companies businesses governments
[2:24:50.380 --> 2:24:55.820]  universities high schools pay for these databases that have tens of thousands
[2:24:55.820 --> 2:25:00.780]  of internet sites names in them and info wars.com and prison planet.com is in
[2:25:00.780 --> 2:25:05.620]  almost all of these and that's why in colleges and companies and public
[2:25:05.620 --> 2:25:10.540]  schools and now on government-issued Wi-Fi that is used in many cities you
[2:25:10.540 --> 2:25:15.860]  can't get to our websites because we've been listed as hate as extremism as
[2:25:15.860 --> 2:25:23.700]  malware as porn as hacking sites there's nothing about how to hack on our sites
[2:25:23.700 --> 2:25:28.140]  there's not even bare-breasted women on our sites unless it's a photo of the
[2:25:28.140 --> 2:25:34.500]  news and naked body scanners there is no hate but even I mean what is the
[2:25:34.500 --> 2:25:38.060]  definition of hate it's whatever they want it to be but again first they
[2:25:38.060 --> 2:25:44.220]  censor Nazis who people don't like and then they can censor everybody this is
[2:25:44.220 --> 2:25:53.140]  how they operate this is how they get their job done and they're now doing it
[2:25:53.140 --> 2:25:57.100]  to the drudge report I mean if they can do it to drudge report the biggest news
[2:25:57.100 --> 2:26:02.660]  site in the world the biggest news site I mean in every radio station I've worked
[2:26:02.660 --> 2:26:06.780]  in when I'm in other news organizations that are interviewing me you see drudge
[2:26:06.780 --> 2:26:12.700]  report on computers I mean everybody checks the drudge report and he mainly
[2:26:12.700 --> 2:26:16.140]  links to mainstream news he does link to prison planet.com he does have a
[2:26:16.140 --> 2:26:19.980]  permanent link to info wars.com he's linking to us every week now we really
[2:26:19.980 --> 2:26:24.620]  appreciate the mega traffic as if prison planet wasn't growing fast enough very
[2:26:24.620 --> 2:26:30.180]  very exciting drudge report malware accusation coincides with cyber security
[2:26:30.180 --> 2:26:35.500]  agenda and I'll be playing a clip of Senator Inhofe talking about this before
[2:26:35.500 --> 2:26:41.820]  the hour ends but this is a big big issue and we have the White House with
[2:26:41.820 --> 2:26:45.980]  Cass Sunstein calling for more and more censorship will probably beef because
[2:26:45.980 --> 2:26:48.780]  Kurt writes four or five great articles a day he's a workhorse that's a great
[2:26:48.780 --> 2:26:52.540]  job but now this article is getting so much attention Watson on the drudge link
[2:26:52.540 --> 2:26:56.060]  one's gonna add another article to bottom about the wider agenda Cass Sunstein
[2:26:56.060 --> 2:27:00.720]  these web filters and things that are going on. Pat in California Pat you're
[2:27:00.720 --> 2:27:05.700]  on the air. Hey Alex what I think is they're basically on the run to push
[2:27:05.700 --> 2:27:10.100]  whatever they can now Obama's talking about let me see give an amnesty to all
[2:27:10.100 --> 2:27:15.700]  the illegals but I just want to ask a quick question I'll get off on HR 875 the
[2:27:15.700 --> 2:27:20.500]  food bill which no one paid attention to is that where the executive order for
[2:27:20.500 --> 2:27:24.260]  Obama is to stop the fishing which I think people should be really aware
[2:27:24.260 --> 2:27:27.540]  about the fishing aspect I'll let you answer and I got to go thanks a lot
[2:27:27.540 --> 2:27:33.060]  Alex. Thank you I've got that bill number here I can't remember it from memory it
[2:27:33.060 --> 2:27:38.300]  was ESPN no no that wasn't a bill that was an executive order and but it doesn't
[2:27:38.300 --> 2:27:41.420]  have the executive order number in the article but I've seen the executive
[2:27:41.420 --> 2:27:46.380]  order we printed it off yesterday it's in one of these stacks give me a wide
[2:27:46.380 --> 2:27:50.300]  this is only one week of news here I've got to clean the desk give me a wide
[2:27:50.300 --> 2:27:55.060]  document cam shots people get an idea of just how insane this this is one week
[2:27:55.060 --> 2:28:00.020]  of news and information but I don't have that executive order in front of me but
[2:28:00.020 --> 2:28:04.500]  it would put federal restrictions on all fishing including angling and streams
[2:28:04.500 --> 2:28:07.980]  and rivers and lakes that's on record that's what the World Wildlife Fund has
[2:28:07.980 --> 2:28:13.700]  sponsored his executive order who's who pushed him to do it says it's for
[2:28:13.700 --> 2:28:19.540]  separately natural news and others who are great sources have reported that the
[2:28:19.540 --> 2:28:26.900]  McCain supplement bill is dead and we did cover that bill the last month that
[2:28:26.900 --> 2:28:31.700]  mirrors the Codex Alimentarius see they agree at the UN level on carbon taxes
[2:28:31.700 --> 2:28:36.580]  or restricting vitamins and minerals or on environmental rules or on military
[2:28:36.580 --> 2:28:40.300]  rules or terrorism rules or surveillance rules and then they get the nation
[2:28:40.300 --> 2:28:45.540]  states to pass corresponding laws but no I don't have the McCain bill number in
[2:28:45.540 --> 2:28:49.900]  front of me either but that's on record that it does that Canada without even
[2:28:49.900 --> 2:28:53.700]  passing a law just put the regulation in effect last month and that was the
[2:28:53.700 --> 2:28:57.980]  headline the Toronto Star that pharmacies and health food stores told
[2:28:57.980 --> 2:29:05.820]  not to sell supplements period that aren't approved by the government and so
[2:29:05.820 --> 2:29:09.980]  there's I mean it's just an absolutely incredible announcement that this is
[2:29:09.980 --> 2:29:13.380]  happening let's go ahead well we're gonna go to break or come back with
[2:29:13.380 --> 2:29:18.060]  Dwayne Brian Terry John and others the toll-free number to join us again is 1

[2:33:20.940 --> 2:33:26.780]  here in just a moment but I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up because I don't
[2:33:26.780 --> 2:33:29.900]  really pay attention to the affiliates we're on I know it's growing my leaps and
[2:33:29.900 --> 2:33:35.140]  bounds a lot of big 50,000 watt AM's a hundred thousand watt FM starting to pick
[2:33:35.140 --> 2:33:38.700]  us up a lot of little stations as well they're all precious because we reach
[2:33:38.700 --> 2:33:42.820]  out to people but I don't know it was about a year ago I got a call by what
[2:33:42.820 --> 2:33:47.060]  the vice president of XM who just wanted to talk to me before they tested the
[2:33:47.060 --> 2:33:53.140]  show out and put three hours of the Friday show on Saturdays and I have heard
[2:33:53.140 --> 2:33:57.540]  myself on XM and then now they're gonna be picking up and they started last
[2:33:57.540 --> 2:34:03.900]  night an hour of the daytime show what eight to nine central and I got a bunch
[2:34:03.900 --> 2:34:08.580]  of emails and saw comments on YouTube saying I'm a liar that we're not on XM
[2:34:08.580 --> 2:34:13.020]  well last night I have serious and owned by the same company but last night
[2:34:13.020 --> 2:34:17.060]  actually went over to a friend's house who has XM sat there tuned it in listen
[2:34:17.060 --> 2:34:20.500]  to it and while I was listening to it Ted called up because I asked him get to
[2:34:20.500 --> 2:34:25.460]  the bottom of this he said I'm in my car I got an XM membership here you are and
[2:34:25.460 --> 2:34:29.980]  I said no I'm already listening so that's the level of the disinformation
[2:34:29.980 --> 2:34:33.820]  against this program that people just go out and say everything we say is a
[2:34:33.820 --> 2:34:38.340]  lie we are on XM not that it's even that big of a deal we're thankful we like it
[2:34:38.340 --> 2:34:42.700]  it's exciting it shows the mainstream knows that our time has come this
[2:34:42.700 --> 2:34:46.220]  information can't be stopped that's why they're letting Ventura on television
[2:34:46.220 --> 2:34:51.060]  that's why all this is happening because all the polls show but upwards of 90
[2:34:51.060 --> 2:34:55.460]  percent believe the government killed Kennedy upwards of 84% in a New York
[2:34:55.460 --> 2:34:58.780]  Times Angus and Reed poll believe the official story of 9-11's a lie the
[2:34:58.780 --> 2:35:04.460]  lowest polls 36% let's say 36% believe that I mean you know the system knows
[2:35:04.460 --> 2:35:08.940]  they can't cover this up anymore now they're not put me on 400 stations like
[2:35:08.940 --> 2:35:13.740]  Glenn Beck or 600 like Limbaugh but the point is they are testing the waters so
[2:35:13.740 --> 2:35:18.300]  people should get the XM subscription so they can listen so that the
[2:35:18.300 --> 2:35:23.620]  market shows people want that so all four hours go on so I briefly wanted to
[2:35:23.620 --> 2:35:29.340]  bring Ted Anderson on that yes this radio show is on XM Ted Anderson yeah
[2:35:29.340 --> 2:35:34.780]  sure as Monday through Friday on channel 158 I tuned it in last night it was on
[2:35:34.780 --> 2:35:39.460]  from 8 o'clock to 9 o'clock Central Standard Time and then on Saturdays it
[2:35:39.460 --> 2:35:45.620]  comes on and on channel 165 and that's on from 5 o'clock Central Time tell 8
[2:35:45.620 --> 2:35:49.820]  o'clock Central Time they don't have you up on the schedule yet it still says
[2:35:49.820 --> 2:35:54.740]  Bruce Williams up there when Bruce retired they put you in there that will
[2:35:54.740 --> 2:35:58.180]  be changed very soon because we're working real closely with them they
[2:35:58.180 --> 2:36:01.780]  have to get into there you know do their internet brand again said last week he
[2:36:01.780 --> 2:36:06.060]  thought they were going to change the the channel on the Saturday show too so
[2:36:06.060 --> 2:36:09.780]  that may cause the confusion as well it could if that does happen that could
[2:36:09.780 --> 2:36:13.980]  cause some confusion but right now at this point in time it shows on the
[2:36:13.980 --> 2:36:18.820]  schedule that you're on 165 on Saturday so well I'll keep you posted on that
[2:36:18.820 --> 2:36:24.460]  let you know but yeah indeed that's you know another testimonial feather in the
[2:36:24.460 --> 2:36:29.540]  cap if you will as to show people how well the Alex Jones show is doing it's
[2:36:29.540 --> 2:36:33.180]  because they pick up a lot of lesser interesting shows you know that give
[2:36:33.180 --> 2:36:38.460]  variety and different news angles but I mean for them to pick up my show which
[2:36:38.460 --> 2:36:44.100]  is seen as the most radical and the most dangerous and oh my gosh when you talk
[2:36:44.100 --> 2:36:47.300]  about how you talk to some of the big networks and big station owners they go
[2:36:47.300 --> 2:36:51.420]  yes we know Alex Jones gets ratings we know he's a powerful talk show host but
[2:36:51.420 --> 2:36:57.500]  you know this guy is just too radical that's that's that's the problem I mean
[2:36:57.500 --> 2:37:02.340]  I've been running into that ever since I've been producing your show and I got
[2:37:02.340 --> 2:37:07.540]  to tell you Alex makes me darn proud to be able to stand by it like we have I do
[2:37:07.540 --> 2:37:13.340]  I run into a block wall I was KSTP was one of them they sell our time I said
[2:37:13.340 --> 2:37:16.740]  good let me buy it on who's the show that's right usually you usually we
[2:37:16.740 --> 2:37:20.340]  don't pay for our time but just to just as a test they wouldn't even let you pay
[2:37:20.340 --> 2:37:24.500]  to put me on know exactly that's what I'm talking about I mean just absolute
[2:37:24.500 --> 2:37:28.940]  block wall I mean not that it really matters because we don't pay to be on
[2:37:28.940 --> 2:37:33.140]  XM to be clear yeah I mean the internet the internet has grown to be such a
[2:37:33.140 --> 2:37:38.460]  great valuable tool to go for a delivery mechanism for shows like yours that
[2:37:38.460 --> 2:37:44.660]  it's you know the terrestrial radio is dying you know I mean I I watched the
[2:37:44.660 --> 2:37:48.140]  the clear channel station here locally they've they've actually got a
[2:37:48.140 --> 2:37:52.540]  conglomerate of seven different stations here in Minneapolis and they've had to
[2:37:52.540 --> 2:37:57.500]  read they've had to reduce the size of their staff and and and get out a
[2:37:57.500 --> 2:38:03.100]  leasing space and it's just shrinking on them while we're growing so that just
[2:38:03.100 --> 2:38:06.460]  tells you what's going on and I think there's gonna be more and more of these
[2:38:06.460 --> 2:38:10.900]  stations that will buckle and they'll take your show and finally the people
[2:38:10.900 --> 2:38:16.020]  the United States will get the truth and that's what matters absolutely because
[2:38:16.020 --> 2:38:20.780]  what we talk about is becoming so mainstream out there I mean look at
[2:38:20.780 --> 2:38:25.340]  Ventura the number one show on true TV beat out all the other cable news
[2:38:25.340 --> 2:38:31.220]  channels except for Fox showing that the people are hungry for alternative
[2:38:31.220 --> 2:38:34.100]  information I said I want to go to calls I don't want to hold you too much
[2:38:34.100 --> 2:38:39.900]  longer but briefly gold has you know in the last month been up what over 70
[2:38:39.900 --> 2:38:44.340]  dollars it's been holding around that range and you still have some great
[2:38:44.340 --> 2:38:48.780]  deals on gold and silver that you bought at the previous lower price when it was
[2:38:48.780 --> 2:38:53.340]  down at about a thousand fifty five dollars an ounce and you've got a free
[2:38:53.340 --> 2:38:58.060]  international news a free international forecaster newsletter that you're
[2:38:58.060 --> 2:39:01.460]  offering with that Frank tell folks briefly about that yeah that's the
[2:39:01.460 --> 2:39:06.100]  Frank at two hundred and sixty one dollars and sixty one cents that is such
[2:39:06.100 --> 2:39:10.220]  a deal Alex I mean if you take the hundred and fifty nine dollars that a
[2:39:10.220 --> 2:39:14.540]  cost to buy that your subscription for a year off of that price we're at about
[2:39:14.540 --> 2:39:18.940]  five hundred and twenty dollars an ounce for gold and you know I mean
[2:39:18.940 --> 2:39:22.980]  everybody knows that you'd have to turn the clock back ten years to be able to
[2:39:22.980 --> 2:39:26.860]  buy gold at five hundred twenty dollars an ounce so if you haven't taken
[2:39:26.860 --> 2:39:30.180]  advantage of that if you didn't hear about this deal call us at one eight
[2:39:30.180 --> 2:39:34.860]  hundred six eight six two two three seven and do it because you're just not
[2:39:34.860 --> 2:39:38.700]  going to get a better deal on gold than that the British sovereigns are three
[2:39:38.700 --> 2:39:42.900]  eighteen they're a good buy to the twenty dollar liberty I haven't met
[2:39:42.900 --> 2:39:46.420]  thirteen sixty three right now I'm gonna be able to hold them for a little bit
[2:39:46.420 --> 2:39:51.580]  they are at fourteen hundred normally I mean now I have got them on my regular
[2:39:51.580 --> 2:39:55.860]  sheet they're about fourteen hundred and fifty bucks so thirteen sixty three for
[2:39:55.860 --> 2:39:58.660]  a twenty dollar liberty is really a steal to us so if you're looking for
[2:39:58.660 --> 2:40:04.500]  something like that the Montana Silver Rounds Lakota's you know it's I picked
[2:40:04.500 --> 2:40:08.780]  up a lot of that stuff the prices shot up like you said it did we've seen
[2:40:08.780 --> 2:40:11.900]  eleven hundred and twenty three today and we've seen as low as eleven hundred and
[2:40:11.900 --> 2:40:17.140]  one but wide fluctuating day but I can tell you right now the I think the
[2:40:17.140 --> 2:40:21.340]  verdict is pretty well up everybody in the entire United States knows that we're
[2:40:21.340 --> 2:40:26.140]  in trouble and gold is a way better idea than sitting on paper investments and
[2:40:26.140 --> 2:40:30.780]  and fiat currency that's for sure absolutely and when you call the
[2:40:30.780 --> 2:40:33.780]  brokers just tell them what you want tell them it's the Alex Jones special and

[2:41:12.140 --> 2:41:17.660]  thanks for holding thanks Alex let's talk to you I've called you once before
[2:41:17.660 --> 2:41:23.980]  regarding the swine flu issue I have to mention I saw Jesse Ventura the other
[2:41:23.980 --> 2:41:28.580]  night on Larry King and it was interesting the Larry King was trying to
[2:41:28.580 --> 2:41:33.580]  talk Jesse Ventura into reneging with some of his or going back on some of
[2:41:33.580 --> 2:41:39.900]  his issues and and Jesse Ventura wouldn't fall for it but additionally I
[2:41:39.900 --> 2:41:42.460]  wanted to talk about some of the issue brought up like why are these things
[2:41:42.460 --> 2:41:47.300]  happening like the internet sensor the health scare cameras everywhere police
[2:41:47.300 --> 2:41:53.580]  towers like that and my I don't know how you feel about this but my issue is that
[2:41:53.580 --> 2:41:58.060]  I think the administration the Obama administration and previous Clinton
[2:41:58.060 --> 2:42:02.020]  Bush and the others have just felt that the American people are going to roll
[2:42:02.020 --> 2:42:06.180]  over too easily and I think they're trying to intimidate us into just
[2:42:06.180 --> 2:42:10.540]  accepting this information without the fact that people are going to rise up
[2:42:10.540 --> 2:42:14.300]  eventually and they're training us incrementally to accept more and more I
[2:42:14.300 --> 2:42:18.060]  totally agree with you I didn't have a chance to watch all the Larry King I
[2:42:18.060 --> 2:42:21.900]  watched it's like 30 minutes long I watched like 10 minutes how was he
[2:42:21.900 --> 2:42:26.900]  trying to get Jeff Ventura to reneg on things but I'm being specific well he
[2:42:26.900 --> 2:42:31.860]  was he was going back to just mentor his book and he was taking out excerpts and
[2:42:31.860 --> 2:42:36.460]  saying well how do you feel about this issue and I don't you think that oh
[2:42:36.460 --> 2:42:41.780]  maybe the health scare was overrated and Jesse would fall for it and he said no
[2:42:41.780 --> 2:42:46.700]  I said this is all government propaganda and a hoax and he wouldn't fall for
[2:42:46.700 --> 2:42:52.380]  Larry King's jibes oh he was saying the swine flu was a hoax yeah yes absolutely
[2:42:52.380 --> 2:42:56.100]  that's the thing Ventura when I first met him four years ago was somewhat
[2:42:56.100 --> 2:42:59.980]  informed but now I know him really well and spend a lot of time with him he
[2:42:59.980 --> 2:43:04.580]  really knows what he's really learning fast and he's such a prominent figure
[2:43:04.580 --> 2:43:09.100]  and he gets on all these big TV shows and he's just doing a lot of good I
[2:43:09.100 --> 2:43:13.540]  disagree with a few issues like legalizing the illegals because I know
[2:43:13.540 --> 2:43:16.540]  that's part of the globalist plan he thinks it's just a freedom issue I
[2:43:16.540 --> 2:43:19.900]  disagree with him on you know I mean you heard his co-author still believes in
[2:43:19.900 --> 2:43:23.980]  man-made global warming but but we won't Jesse up about that so very exciting
[2:43:23.980 --> 2:43:29.460]  Dwayne thanks for the call cherry and Tennessee you're on the air hey Alex hey
[2:43:29.460 --> 2:43:34.220]  buddy I'm man enjoy your show what question I have two questions about the
[2:43:34.220 --> 2:43:40.420]  body scanners first question is is it mandatory or can you offer a pat down
[2:43:40.420 --> 2:43:44.860]  second question is do we have a list of the airports that are used in the
[2:43:44.860 --> 2:43:54.420]  things okay in England first they said it'd be voluntary now it's mandatory same
[2:43:54.420 --> 2:43:59.860]  thing here they're now saying it first it'll be let me put that around first
[2:43:59.860 --> 2:44:04.660]  they say it's voluntary then they say it becomes mandatory England has already
[2:44:04.660 --> 2:44:10.620]  done that and at first in England and the US all run and managed by the same
[2:44:10.620 --> 2:44:14.940]  type people it's all incremental conditioning it's like dog training or
[2:44:14.940 --> 2:44:20.060]  or how you break a horse how you domesticate an animal they just by
[2:44:20.060 --> 2:44:26.060]  degrees gets you into it so first they say oh what three four years ago they
[2:44:26.060 --> 2:44:30.340]  put in some body scanners at a few airports around the country Boston Logan
[2:44:30.340 --> 2:44:35.340]  and a few others then they a year and a half ago ordered several billion dollars
[2:44:35.340 --> 2:44:42.700]  worth and announced 100 plus airports then 214 airports would be getting them
[2:44:42.700 --> 2:44:48.980]  but then you may have an airport 10 or 15 20 terminals in some cases only a few
[2:44:48.980 --> 2:44:54.220]  of the terminals got them at I think it's more than 40 airports have now put
[2:44:54.220 --> 2:44:58.300]  them in last number I saw last week now they're talking about you know you see
[2:44:58.300 --> 2:45:04.660]  headlines you know 11 more airports get it and another article 16 more get it
[2:45:04.660 --> 2:45:10.500]  but they intend to put them in 200 that's the Homeland Security Report 214
[2:45:10.500 --> 2:45:14.260]  airports that's an airport of any size and in the first wave they just want to
[2:45:14.260 --> 2:45:20.940]  get them in the 214 at one or two of the terminals by terminal I mean security
[2:45:20.940 --> 2:45:25.500]  checkpoint at that terminal like take Austin Bartstrom I think they only have
[2:45:25.500 --> 2:45:29.700]  what three security checkpoints but then you go to something like Chicago I
[2:45:29.700 --> 2:45:35.220]  mean I don't know how many Chicago has but it's a giant labyrinth same thing
[2:45:35.220 --> 2:45:40.860]  with LAX same thing with JFK I mean these are just huge huge huge facilities
[2:45:40.860 --> 2:45:46.500]  but no they do intend to put them in all major airports and now because of Joe
[2:45:46.500 --> 2:45:49.340]  Stack flying into the building they were already calling for it but but now
[2:45:49.340 --> 2:45:53.460]  they're really pushing it they want body scanners what will first metal
[2:45:53.460 --> 2:45:57.060]  detectors then body scanners at small airports that'll bankrupt them you got
[2:45:57.060 --> 2:46:00.540]  15 little planes you know the people can barely pay for it some little tiny
[2:46:00.540 --> 2:46:05.060]  runway outside Austin or outside wherever you live they won't be able to
[2:46:05.060 --> 2:46:10.340]  pay for it they want general aviation private pilots or charter jets at the
[2:46:10.340 --> 2:46:14.340]  airports the bigger ones to make you go through it they want to put them in all
[2:46:14.340 --> 2:46:17.700]  the federal courthouses and have put them in quite a few courthouses in the
[2:46:17.700 --> 2:46:21.500]  US the first being Denver but we learned it was more now they've got mobile
[2:46:21.500 --> 2:46:26.580]  Homeland Security trucks with brain scanners body scanners x-rays that
[2:46:26.580 --> 2:46:30.300]  are going to herd people through at highway checkpoints and at shopping
[2:46:30.300 --> 2:46:36.100]  malls and at football events and at concerts did you see me or hear me
[2:46:36.100 --> 2:46:41.780]  play that Homeland Security video clip on Monday no I missed it well there was
[2:46:41.780 --> 2:46:45.740]  an article written about it at prison planet calm the point is this is going
[2:46:45.740 --> 2:46:50.180]  to be everywhere and they've announced it I appreciate your call let's go ahead
[2:46:50.180 --> 2:46:58.340]  and jam in another call here let's talk to John John and Ohio you're on the
[2:46:58.340 --> 2:47:04.860]  air I heard part of the dick Russell interview there and I wanted to make a
[2:47:04.860 --> 2:47:09.740]  few points towards the end there before it was cut off he was talking about the
[2:47:09.740 --> 2:47:15.300]  hard hunt and here you have a smoking gun deathbed confession of always the
[2:47:15.300 --> 2:47:20.140]  leading candidate for being sort of the on-the-spot field operative for the
[2:47:20.140 --> 2:47:24.460]  Kennedy assassination he ran assassinations worldwide on record right
[2:47:24.460 --> 2:47:29.100]  exactly and because it wrote some fictional books that's the stock and
[2:47:29.100 --> 2:47:34.740]  trade of the CIA is to lie when you have witnessed against self-interest totally
[2:47:34.740 --> 2:47:40.300]  different than the lies that the CIA that's like Ian Fleming of MI5 well it
[2:47:40.300 --> 2:47:45.820]  was MI6 he was OSS before that wrote the James Bond novels you look at
[2:47:45.820 --> 2:47:50.460]  operation done mockingbird how the CIA if you look at Google that up our people
[2:47:50.460 --> 2:47:53.980]  can see how all of the media all the leading networks all of the media
[2:47:53.980 --> 2:47:57.540]  New York Times Washington Post the rest of it completely collaborated with the
[2:47:57.540 --> 2:48:03.820]  CIA and framing up the Soviet Union for conspiracies coming out your ears yet
[2:48:03.820 --> 2:48:07.780]  these same people that say that there's no conspiracies required you to believe
[2:48:07.780 --> 2:48:11.900]  all of these conspiracies as long as it was a country where there was a Soviet
[2:48:11.900 --> 2:48:18.420]  Union Cuba Libya Iraq Iran Venezuela they're involved in conspiracies you
[2:48:18.420 --> 2:48:21.540]  you better believe it but if you say an element within the secret government in
[2:48:21.540 --> 2:48:26.020]  this in this country is involved in it well we'll have a nice handy psychiatric
[2:48:26.020 --> 2:48:31.860]  pathological that's like Iran and Iraq they said they have secret WMD programs
[2:48:31.860 --> 2:48:36.140]  and they have all these and then it turned out it was all lies but that's a
[2:48:36.140 --> 2:48:41.060]  real conspiracy theory but then that's okay but then you have well here's an
[2:48:41.060 --> 2:48:46.780]  example I was on CBC yesterday they actually aired it today they said they
[2:48:46.780 --> 2:48:50.420]  were airing today let's go pull up that guy's show on the CBC and see if it did
[2:48:50.420 --> 2:48:57.380]  air guys please and I talked about the White House memo the Downing Street
[2:48:57.380 --> 2:49:04.300]  memo how it's admitted the government admits that they lied about the WMD's
[2:49:04.300 --> 2:49:08.700]  fix the intelligence around the war that they knew that Saddam didn't have them
[2:49:08.700 --> 2:49:11.940]  and they had another guy come on after I was on because I could hear it on the
[2:49:11.940 --> 2:49:17.140]  ISDN line they didn't disconnected and say I made that up again they call you a
[2:49:17.140 --> 2:49:23.820]  conspiracy theorist for saying that they lied about WMD's John and the other
[2:49:23.820 --> 2:49:28.900]  thing that dick was talking about was he was surprised that having a post was
[2:49:28.900 --> 2:49:33.300]  doing a job on it if you look back to the history of this of the CIA's a
[2:49:33.300 --> 2:49:38.380]  propaganda they always love to use up fake liberal friends fake liberal
[2:49:38.380 --> 2:49:42.620]  magazines and others as an excuse for their cold war anti-communist anti-
[2:49:42.620 --> 2:49:46.540]  Soviet propaganda because it would be more believable and even more than the
[2:49:46.540 --> 2:49:51.260]  right wing they the New Republic and many others were secretly collaborating
[2:49:51.260 --> 2:49:56.980]  with the CIA to frame up us into the Vietnam War so what I'm getting at is
[2:49:56.980 --> 2:50:02.780]  that I think that he's a little naive things like NPR somehow have this
[2:50:02.780 --> 2:50:08.300]  reputation that they're an alternative CNN and Fox when actually the head
[2:50:08.300 --> 2:50:14.460]  of the all CIA foreign propaganda radio propaganda Kevin Close was for many many
[2:50:14.460 --> 2:50:20.420]  years the head of a chairman of NPR they just tell the same war-mongering
[2:50:20.420 --> 2:50:25.540]  rambashing rack bashing lies in a softer soccer mom voice to make it sound
[2:50:25.540 --> 2:50:30.980]  somehow more moderate and I think that people have got to get rid of this
[2:50:30.980 --> 2:50:36.620]  broad branding because I think Colin Powell served that he was depicted as
[2:50:36.620 --> 2:50:41.460]  a moderate he lined his teeth off at the United Nations to drag us into this
[2:50:41.460 --> 2:50:45.220]  war and the Bush you're changing administration said they couldn't have
[2:50:45.220 --> 2:50:50.100]  done it without him Obama's got that same kind of oh I mean Obama is just
[2:50:50.100 --> 2:50:54.940]  bush three all right great points I appreciate your call but at the same
[2:50:54.940 --> 2:50:58.700]  time the Soviets had all their disinformation and propaganda as well
[2:50:58.700 --> 2:51:04.500]  let's be fair about that they're right back you just might be only a few meals
[2:51:04.500 --> 2:51:08.660]  away from anarchy look at the recent world events and even the economic

[2:52:12.660 --> 2:52:16.220]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[2:52:16.220 --> 2:52:21.300]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[2:52:21.300 --> 2:52:26.700]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention fall
[2:52:26.700 --> 2:52:31.620]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[2:52:31.620 --> 2:52:35.980]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[2:52:43.700 --> 2:52:49.260]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[2:54:37.780 --> 2:54:42.540]  agenda and you've got the capital telling the staffers don't visit the drug
[2:54:42.540 --> 2:54:47.720]  report it'll put viruses on your computer total slander total lies this is
[2:54:47.720 --> 2:54:53.680]  is something they use to demonize the Internet. And it's similar to what's going on where
[2:54:53.680 --> 2:54:57.280]  they have all these databases they sell to companies and government that list thousands
[2:54:57.280 --> 2:55:03.720]  of websites like infoawards.com and prismplanet.com as hate sites so that they can restrict people's
[2:55:03.720 --> 2:55:08.240]  access to it. Let's go ahead and go to this clip of Inhofe, a great clip from CNS News
[2:55:08.240 --> 2:55:09.240]  that we linked to.
[2:55:09.240 --> 2:55:13.360]  An email was sent to several Senate offices Tuesday saying that the Sergeant at Arms is
[2:55:13.360 --> 2:55:18.240]  urging them not to view the website the Drudge Report because it is linked to viruses on
[2:55:18.240 --> 2:55:23.960]  congressional computers. The Sergeant at Arms was not available for comment, but CNSNews.com
[2:55:23.960 --> 2:55:30.560]  spoke to Senator James Inhofe who says there is no evidence of a link between the two.
[2:55:30.560 --> 2:55:35.320]  An email went out saying that the Sergeant at Arms is suggesting that people do not
[2:55:35.320 --> 2:55:40.880]  visit, people within the Capitol do not visit the Drudge Report specifically because it's
[2:55:40.880 --> 2:55:46.160]  linked to viruses on congressional computers. Do you have any evidence of this?
[2:55:46.160 --> 2:55:49.700]  Well, none whatsoever. It doesn't surprise me though because Drudge comes out with really
[2:55:49.700 --> 2:55:54.860]  good stuff and we want them to access the Drudge Report. We're on the Drudge Report
[2:55:54.860 --> 2:55:59.240]  about half the time. Every time there's something that is really noticeable and that somebody
[2:55:59.240 --> 2:56:05.920]  needs to cover, Drudge is right there. I suspect somebody was trying to make it look as if
[2:56:05.920 --> 2:56:11.440]  there's a virus there to discourage people from using Drudge. Then somehow I guess someone
[2:56:11.440 --> 2:56:17.480]  in the Capitol got a hold of it and said yes, we're advising you not to use it. Just today
[2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:22.400]  they backed down. So I think that maybe we were right all the time and that there's not
[2:56:22.400 --> 2:56:29.400]  a problem and we would encourage people to continue to use Drudge. That's a great source.
[2:56:29.400 --> 2:56:34.080]  And why do you think initially they would pinpoint the Drudge Report in this email?
[2:56:34.080 --> 2:56:37.560]  Oh, I would think that because Drudge gets on things. You know, remember it was Drudge
[2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:41.480]  who started the whole Monica Lewinsky thing and that ended up being right. I can name
[2:56:41.480 --> 2:56:45.960]  a lot of things that Drudge found out about first. So let's just give them the opportunity
[2:56:45.960 --> 2:56:53.200]  to keep working and that way we learn a lot quicker by having access to the Drudge Report.
[2:56:53.200 --> 2:57:02.200]  However, the Liberals, the extremists, they don't want to the information that he has
[2:57:02.200 --> 2:57:06.520]  because he's a man of truth and most of them don't want the truth.
[2:57:06.520 --> 2:57:12.600]  The original email said, quote, please try to avoid Drudge Report and whitepages.com websites
[2:57:12.600 --> 2:57:18.000]  for now. The SAA believes these two websites are responsible for the many viruses popping
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:22.880]  up throughout the Senate. A follow up email was sent out late Tuesday afternoon directly
[2:57:22.880 --> 2:57:28.160]  from the Sergeant at Arms, not specifically mentioning the Drudge Report, saying, quote,
[2:57:28.160 --> 2:57:32.680]  our information security operations center has observed a significant increase in the
[2:57:32.680 --> 2:57:37.800]  number of Senate computers affected by fake security software that is malicious and does
[2:57:37.800 --> 2:57:43.960]  nothing to secure online information. Nicholas Balacy, cnsnews.com, the capital.
[2:57:43.960 --> 2:57:49.160]  Well, I tell you, CNS News is a great job and I really like Inhofe, but he says it's
[2:57:49.160 --> 2:57:56.440]  a liberal issue. We've seen Republicans demonizing the Internet, not Inhofe. We've seen calls
[2:57:56.440 --> 2:58:01.040]  by some of the Bush administration people in Congress. They had hearings about censoring
[2:58:01.040 --> 2:58:05.240]  the web, but this is a dirty trick against the Drudge Report. And again, I've been saying
[2:58:05.240 --> 2:58:10.240]  it for more than a year, Drudge Post, all the big articles about world government. He talks
[2:58:10.240 --> 2:58:16.960]  about the New World Order now. He talks about the naked body scanners. He is consistently
[2:58:16.960 --> 2:58:22.800]  really doing a good job, just like Lou Dobbs, just like Andrew Napolitano. I want to praise
[2:58:22.800 --> 2:58:29.240]  good people that happen to be somewhat mainstream media. I want to praise Glenn Beck. I saw him
[2:58:29.240 --> 2:58:34.760]  do a great news report last Friday about brainwashing in schools. You know, he's come out in support
[2:58:34.760 --> 2:58:39.440]  of Iceland. I just wish he didn't backstab all the time, but he's doing a little bit
[2:58:39.440 --> 2:59:05.800]  better
[2:59:05.800 --> 2:59:10.800]  influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[2:59:10.800 --> 2:59:15.800]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:59:15.800 --> 2:59:18.800]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[2:59:18.800 --> 2:59:23.800]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty,
[2:59:23.800 --> 2:59:25.800]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:59:25.800 --> 2:59:29.800]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches,
[2:59:29.800 --> 2:59:31.800]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[2:59:31.800 --> 2:59:36.800]  Today it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C.,
[2:59:36.800 --> 2:59:39.800]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[3:00:15.800 --> 3:00:20.800]  Well, G. Edward Griffin really needs no introduction.
[3:00:20.800 --> 3:00:23.800]  He is an icon of the liberty and freedom movement,
[3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:30.800]  a relentless fighter against collectivist, control freak, parasites everywhere.
[3:00:30.800 --> 3:00:33.800]  We're going to cover a range of issues with G. Edward Griffin today,
[3:00:33.800 --> 3:00:36.800]  and take your phone calls. Everybody holding.
[3:00:36.800 --> 3:00:41.800]  1-800-259-9231 will be interspersing calls throughout the interview,
[3:00:41.800 --> 3:00:43.800]  including coming up in the next segment.
[3:00:43.800 --> 3:00:46.800]  And you can comment on whatever issue you bring up.
[3:00:46.800 --> 3:00:49.800]  But G. Edward, I wanted to ask you this.
[3:00:49.800 --> 3:00:52.800]  Why are they coming out in the open about world government?
[3:00:52.800 --> 3:00:55.800]  Why are they admitting that public schools are using laptops
[3:00:55.800 --> 3:00:58.800]  they give the students to watch them and their parents at home?
[3:00:58.800 --> 3:01:04.800]  Why are they, I mean, are the parasites going crazy on power trips,
[3:01:04.800 --> 3:01:06.800]  which we see throughout history?
[3:01:06.800 --> 3:01:10.800]  Or is there a method to their madness to try to just overwhelm us
[3:01:10.800 --> 3:01:14.800]  by throwing it in our face, trying to acclimate us?
[3:01:14.800 --> 3:01:15.800]  Well, that's a good question.
[3:01:15.800 --> 3:01:18.800]  I think, like so many issues in that category,
[3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:21.800]  there probably is no one single answer that's correct.
[3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:24.800]  I think there are several that probably fit in.
[3:01:24.800 --> 3:01:28.800]  You know, these are the people that are pretty much pulling the big levers.
[3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:33.800]  Aren't as smart, I don't think, as we sometimes tend to give them credit for,
[3:01:33.800 --> 3:01:36.800]  but I think they're very cunning and they're very agile
[3:01:36.800 --> 3:01:40.800]  so that they are able to take advantage of the twists and turns on the stream
[3:01:40.800 --> 3:01:42.800]  as they're coming down on the ramp.
[3:01:42.800 --> 3:01:45.800]  They don't really plan that they're going to go on the left side of the boat
[3:01:45.800 --> 3:01:47.800]  until they really get there, you know.
[3:01:47.800 --> 3:01:50.800]  But they're agile enough to get around it.
[3:01:50.800 --> 3:01:52.800]  So whenever issues come up, they say,
[3:01:52.800 --> 3:01:55.800]  okay, how are we going to make lemonade out of these lemons?
[3:01:55.800 --> 3:01:57.800]  And they do pretty good at that.
[3:01:57.800 --> 3:02:01.800]  I think though certain answers do become kind of obvious,
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:07.800]  one is that the closer they get to the goal line, the less possible it is
[3:02:07.800 --> 3:02:10.800]  to conceal the fact that they're heading for the goal line.
[3:02:10.800 --> 3:02:14.800]  You know, once you get right there, you can see the horses coming on the home stretch.
[3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:16.800]  Oh, here they are. This is the end of the race.
[3:02:16.800 --> 3:02:19.800]  So they might as well come right out and be open about it
[3:02:19.800 --> 3:02:21.800]  because there's no way to conceal it in the first place.
[3:02:21.800 --> 3:02:24.800]  And secondly, the thought that comes to my mind is that
[3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:29.800]  the conditioning of the American mind has been going on for so long
[3:02:29.800 --> 3:02:32.800]  and people have become so passive.
[3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:38.800]  And so timid about all of this, that they're standing in awe
[3:02:38.800 --> 3:02:40.800]  and in amazement, think, golly, look at this.
[3:02:40.800 --> 3:02:42.800]  It's happening, isn't it?
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:46.800]  They don't have this power of righteous indignation to really do much about it.
[3:02:46.800 --> 3:02:48.800]  They're just sort of fascinated by it.
[3:02:48.800 --> 3:02:50.800]  So you're saying deer in the headlights.
[3:02:50.800 --> 3:02:52.800]  Yeah, deer in the headlights, exactly.
[3:02:52.800 --> 3:02:55.800]  Thanks for cutting that short because that's the perfect summary of it.
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:02:59.800]  So the two main answers to that question.
[3:02:59.800 --> 3:03:02.800]  What about the term conspiracy theorist?
[3:03:02.800 --> 3:03:06.800]  I mean, I was on a radio show and I was told I was a conspiracy theorist
[3:03:06.800 --> 3:03:10.800]  that the White House and Downing Street memos that are even mainstream news admit
[3:03:10.800 --> 3:03:14.800]  Bush and Blair premeditatedly lied about WMDs.
[3:03:14.800 --> 3:03:17.800]  They weren't wrong about it. They lied about it.
[3:03:17.800 --> 3:03:20.800]  And the establishment just says, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:22.800]  I don't see that working anymore.
[3:03:22.800 --> 3:03:24.800]  I mean, it seems to destroy their credibility.
[3:03:24.800 --> 3:03:26.800]  Well, it's working less and less, isn't it?
[3:03:26.800 --> 3:03:29.800]  Because more and more people have gotten used to that phrase, too.
[3:03:29.800 --> 3:03:33.800]  I kind of think that, you know, in the American Revolution,
[3:03:33.800 --> 3:03:38.800]  the British called the colonists who resisted, they called them a bunch of Yankees.
[3:03:38.800 --> 3:03:40.800]  But that was an insult.
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:43.800]  And, you know, a bunch of Yankees meant that they didn't know anything.
[3:03:43.800 --> 3:03:45.800]  They never had any education.
[3:03:45.800 --> 3:03:47.800]  They didn't even know their right foot from their left foot,
[3:03:47.800 --> 3:03:50.800]  which they had to put hay and straw in their shoes
[3:03:50.800 --> 3:03:54.800]  so they could march to the tune of hay foot, straw foot, because they didn't know the left from right.
[3:03:54.800 --> 3:03:59.800]  So they derided the soldiers and the colonists and the patriots.
[3:03:59.800 --> 3:04:01.800]  They called them Yankees.
[3:04:01.800 --> 3:04:05.800]  Yankee Doodle came to town, you know, and that was a song of derision.
[3:04:05.800 --> 3:04:08.800]  But after a while, the Yankees sort of picked it up and said,
[3:04:08.800 --> 3:04:12.800]  hey, okay, call us the Yankee. Well, I guess we're Yankees.
[3:04:12.800 --> 3:04:17.800]  So I'm beginning to think the same thing is happening to the word conspiracy theorist.
[3:04:17.800 --> 3:04:22.800]  Now there's a certain pride I see creeping into the vocabulary.
[3:04:22.800 --> 3:04:25.800]  But gee, Edward, maybe someday in the future, you know,
[3:04:25.800 --> 3:04:28.800]  when we defeat the New World Order in 50 years or 20 years,
[3:04:28.800 --> 3:04:32.800]  there'll be a national baseball team called the conspiracy theorist.
[3:04:32.800 --> 3:04:34.800]  I think that's a good idea.
[3:04:34.800 --> 3:04:38.800]  Well, you know, when I get that thrown at me and it happens more often than not,
[3:04:38.800 --> 3:04:41.800]  I usually just say, well, I don't think I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[3:04:41.800 --> 3:04:44.800]  I like to think of myself as a conspiracy historian.
[3:04:44.800 --> 3:04:48.800]  And let's talk about the history instead of the theory.
[3:04:48.800 --> 3:04:52.800]  Let's talk about the history of government conspiracies that are on record.
[3:04:52.800 --> 3:04:56.800]  Then let's get into what's happening to the banking system worldwide,
[3:04:56.800 --> 3:04:59.800]  the economy, and phone calls with G. Edward Griffin.
[3:04:59.800 --> 3:05:02.800]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:05:02.800 --> 3:05:04.800]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones.
[3:05:04.800 --> 3:05:06.800]  I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:05:06.800 --> 3:05:09.800]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[3:05:09.800 --> 3:05:12.800]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[3:05:12.800 --> 3:05:15.800]  by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[3:05:15.800 --> 3:05:19.800]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[3:05:19.800 --> 3:05:23.800]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[3:05:23.800 --> 3:05:26.800]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[3:05:26.800 --> 3:05:31.800]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[3:05:31.800 --> 3:05:35.800]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products,
[3:05:35.800 --> 3:05:39.800]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[3:05:39.800 --> 3:05:44.800]  with the Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided,
[3:05:44.800 --> 3:05:46.800]  making production fast and simple.
[3:05:46.800 --> 3:05:50.800]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today
[3:05:50.800 --> 3:05:54.800]  and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:05:54.800 --> 3:06:00.800]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[3:06:00.800 --> 3:06:05.800]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:06:05.800 --> 3:06:09.800]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:06:09.800 --> 3:06:15.800]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[3:06:15.800 --> 3:06:20.800]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:06:20.800 --> 3:06:25.800]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[3:06:25.800 --> 3:06:29.800]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:06:29.800 --> 3:06:32.800]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[3:06:32.800 --> 3:06:36.800]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[3:06:36.800 --> 3:06:41.800]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:06:41.800 --> 3:06:44.800]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:06:44.800 --> 3:06:46.800]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[3:06:46.800 --> 3:06:50.800]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[3:06:50.800 --> 3:06:52.800]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[3:06:52.800 --> 3:06:56.800]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[3:06:56.800 --> 3:07:01.800]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[3:07:01.800 --> 3:07:04.800]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[3:07:04.800 --> 3:07:10.800]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:07:10.800 --> 3:07:16.800]  Anyone placing food orders on the large volume production run scheduled for the week of March 22nd
[3:07:16.800 --> 3:07:19.800]  can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[3:07:19.800 --> 3:07:23.800]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders,
[3:07:23.800 --> 3:07:25.800]  they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[3:07:25.800 --> 3:07:27.800]  That's buy three, get one free.
[3:07:27.800 --> 3:07:30.800]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[3:07:30.800 --> 3:07:34.800]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food
[3:07:34.800 --> 3:07:38.800]  passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[3:07:38.800 --> 3:07:41.800]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[3:07:41.800 --> 3:07:46.800]  Another example, buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[3:07:46.800 --> 3:07:51.800]  You've got to go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime

[3:08:25.800 --> 3:08:28.800]  All right, we've got 52 minutes left.
[3:08:28.800 --> 3:08:30.800]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest.
[3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:34.800]  G. Edward Griffin is a writer and documentary film producer for 45 years
[3:08:34.800 --> 3:08:39.800]  and has been exposing the hidden agenda now that's out in the open of the world government.
[3:08:39.800 --> 3:08:42.800]  Well known because of his talent for researching difficult topics
[3:08:42.800 --> 3:08:45.800]  and presenting them in clear terms that all can understand.
[3:08:45.800 --> 3:08:50.800]  With many successful titles to his credit, he has dealt with such diverse subjects as archaeology,
[3:08:50.800 --> 3:08:55.800]  the Federal Reserve System, international banking, terrorism, internal subversion,
[3:08:55.800 --> 3:08:58.800]  U.S. foreign policy, the Supreme Court, and the United Nations.
[3:08:58.800 --> 3:09:01.800]  His better known works include the creature from Jekyll Island,
[3:09:01.800 --> 3:09:05.800]  moles in high places, the open gates of Troy, no place to hide,
[3:09:05.800 --> 3:09:09.800]  the capitalist conspiracy more deadly than war.
[3:09:09.800 --> 3:09:12.800]  Perhaps we'll talk about the capitalist conspiracy today
[3:09:12.800 --> 3:09:17.800]  and explain why we always see big bankers and oligarchs and industrialists
[3:09:17.800 --> 3:09:22.800]  behind communist movements and why they're pushing for government-run healthcare
[3:09:22.800 --> 3:09:26.800]  and big government and the green tax takeover today.
[3:09:26.800 --> 3:09:29.800]  But G. Edward, we started getting into conspiracies.
[3:09:29.800 --> 3:09:33.800]  When three guys decide to rob a bank, that's a conspiracy.
[3:09:33.800 --> 3:09:37.800]  And when somebody conspires to murder their spouse, it's a conspiracy.
[3:09:37.800 --> 3:09:45.800]  If, I mean, people conspire in a non-criminal way to open a sandwich shop.
[3:09:45.800 --> 3:09:49.800]  I mean, it's insane for the government and the media to say,
[3:09:49.800 --> 3:09:52.800]  all these other countries and people are involved in conspiracies,
[3:09:52.800 --> 3:09:55.800]  but our government, it's never involved.
[3:09:55.800 --> 3:10:00.800]  Powerful people don't get behind closed doors to try to expand their power.
[3:10:00.800 --> 3:10:04.800]  Well, yeah, anybody that scoffs at the concept of conspiracy today,
[3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:09.800]  I kind of feel sorry for them because I know that their brains have been captured
[3:10:09.800 --> 3:10:11.800]  in some way by the propaganda.
[3:10:11.800 --> 3:10:14.800]  And it also tells me that they have never read a history book
[3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:19.800]  because any cursory glance at history produces the realization
[3:10:19.800 --> 3:10:22.800]  that history is driven by the action of conspiracy.
[3:10:22.800 --> 3:10:27.800]  I don't think there's a single major event in history that wasn't centered around
[3:10:27.800 --> 3:10:31.800]  dozens if not hundreds of conspiracies, large and small.
[3:10:31.800 --> 3:10:35.800]  It's the nature of man.
[3:10:35.800 --> 3:10:38.800]  It's certainly the nature of man when he's in a position
[3:10:38.800 --> 3:10:42.800]  to acquire great wealth or power through conspiracies.
[3:10:42.800 --> 3:10:47.800]  And of course, at the apex of that little chart of how you can gain control
[3:10:47.800 --> 3:10:50.800]  of great wealth and power, it is the government.
[3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:54.800]  And so we find most of the big conspiracies of history centered in government.
[3:10:54.800 --> 3:10:58.800]  So people who say, well, yeah, you can find conspiracies in industry,
[3:10:58.800 --> 3:11:03.800]  conspiracies in advertising, companies are always being taken to court
[3:11:03.800 --> 3:11:06.800]  or conspiracy to defraud the public and so forth.
[3:11:06.800 --> 3:11:08.800]  But they say, oh, not in government, as you just mentioned.
[3:11:08.800 --> 3:11:12.800]  Well, actually, a government is the most likely place for a conspiracy to be found
[3:11:12.800 --> 3:11:16.800]  because tremendous profit and the benefit pay off.
[3:11:16.800 --> 3:11:19.800]  So anyway, people who are scoff at conspiracy, I understand them.
[3:11:19.800 --> 3:11:24.800]  I just have to laugh internally thinking, well, these people have a little more to learn.
[3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:28.800]  But in time, they will learn it and they'll be saying somewhere down the line
[3:11:28.800 --> 3:11:33.800]  that, well, I've been telling you all along that there are conspiracies out there, you know.
[3:11:33.800 --> 3:11:36.800]  But it's our job to educate and to present the facts
[3:11:36.800 --> 3:11:39.800]  so that people can come to that conclusion themselves,
[3:11:39.800 --> 3:11:42.800]  not because we said so, not because we labeled it a conspiracy,
[3:11:42.800 --> 3:11:47.800]  but just label out the history of what happened, who did it, and document it.
[3:11:47.800 --> 3:11:49.800]  And then they'll say, by golly, that's a conspiracy.
[3:11:49.800 --> 3:11:55.800]  Well, G. Edward, I do a lot of interviews like you do to magazines,
[3:11:55.800 --> 3:11:59.800]  newspapers, I was on CBC radio yesterday, and they said,
[3:11:59.800 --> 3:12:01.800]  how did you come upon these views?
[3:12:01.800 --> 3:12:04.800]  How did you become a conspiracy theorist?
[3:12:04.800 --> 3:12:06.800]  And it's the same answer you just gave.
[3:12:06.800 --> 3:12:08.800]  My parents are big readers.
[3:12:08.800 --> 3:12:13.800]  My mom was a history major in college and, you know, my dad's a physician.
[3:12:13.800 --> 3:12:17.800]  And I learned early on that history books were more entertaining
[3:12:17.800 --> 3:12:21.800]  by the time I was about 12, and my son's now the same way at seven.
[3:12:21.800 --> 3:12:26.800]  That's his favorite thing is children's, and he's now even reading adult history books
[3:12:26.800 --> 3:12:30.800]  and encyclopedias and things, you know, that hunger for knowledge.
[3:12:30.800 --> 3:12:36.800]  Any period, any culture, any empire, that's all it is, is conspiracies.
[3:12:36.800 --> 3:12:41.800]  That's why these empires and Caesar and others always set up police states,
[3:12:41.800 --> 3:12:45.800]  because there were always people conspiring in their own government to overthrow them.
[3:12:45.800 --> 3:12:50.800]  So it's just asinine to say there aren't conspiracies afoot.
[3:12:50.800 --> 3:12:55.800]  What are some of the more famous conspiracies that have been proven to be real?
[3:12:55.800 --> 3:13:02.800]  Well, I guess the, you know, Etube, Routet, we all know about the Roman conspiracy,
[3:13:02.800 --> 3:13:06.800]  the assassination that took place there, their conspiration.
[3:13:06.800 --> 3:13:10.800]  I'm just, I wasn't prepared for that question, but that would be a fun thing to assemble.
[3:13:10.800 --> 3:13:15.800]  I remember back in, I think it was the 50s or maybe the 60s,
[3:13:15.800 --> 3:13:21.800]  there was a lot of television coverage and news coverage to exposing the mafia,
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:26.800]  the mafiosa and the coast of Nostra in the United States and around the world.
[3:13:26.800 --> 3:13:29.800]  Well, heck, that's a conspiracy. Everybody acknowledges that.
[3:13:29.800 --> 3:13:31.800]  You know, it doesn't take long.
[3:13:31.800 --> 3:13:37.800]  If you really are looking for a conspiracy to study, all you have to do is go down to your local courthouse
[3:13:37.800 --> 3:13:40.800]  and sit there and listen to cases for a day or two, and you'll find out that,
[3:13:40.800 --> 3:13:45.800]  I'm going to guess that probably 10% or 15% of them involve conspiracies.
[3:13:45.800 --> 3:13:47.800]  Conspiracies are all over the place. They're the norm.
[3:13:47.800 --> 3:13:53.800]  Families conspired to steal the inheritance away from the primary inheritor.
[3:13:53.800 --> 3:14:02.800]  Corporations conspired to defraud the public and pharmaceutical companies conspired to hide scientific evidence
[3:14:02.800 --> 3:14:04.800]  that shows that their drugs are killing people.
[3:14:04.800 --> 3:14:08.800]  You can just go. There's no trouble finding conspiracies.
[3:14:08.800 --> 3:14:11.800]  Well, let's go back to the mafia. That's the best example I've ever heard.
[3:14:11.800 --> 3:14:12.800]  I hadn't thought of that.
[3:14:12.800 --> 3:14:17.800]  Here you have Jagger Hoover, who was clearly being blackmailed by the mafia,
[3:14:17.800 --> 3:14:21.800]  getting up in speeches and saying there's no such thing as La Cosa Nostra,
[3:14:21.800 --> 3:14:24.800]  and then researching those cases, because it's so interesting.
[3:14:24.800 --> 3:14:29.800]  I've probably read 15 books or more and watched a lot of television programs like most people about it.
[3:14:29.800 --> 3:14:36.800]  You had less than 30 mafia families in Italy, in Greece, in Western Europe, in Eastern Europe,
[3:14:36.800 --> 3:14:46.800]  and in North America controlling the opium trade, the cocaine trade, prostitution, gambling, olive oil importation.
[3:14:46.800 --> 3:14:55.800]  These were just 30 families or less, but then government and giant private corporations
[3:14:55.800 --> 3:15:02.800]  and U.S. intelligence agencies with trillions of dollars of funding since the National Security Act of 1947,
[3:15:02.800 --> 3:15:07.800]  operating in total secret, doing whatever they want. You mean powerful, avarice-filled people
[3:15:07.800 --> 3:15:11.800]  aren't going to move into those positions, even if it was founded good, which it wasn't.
[3:15:11.800 --> 3:15:15.800]  You mean they're not going to move in and take power?
[3:15:15.800 --> 3:15:23.800]  You mean there's not a blue blood Yale group on record that founded the CIA almost purely of skull and bones?
[3:15:23.800 --> 3:15:30.800]  That's mainline New York Times to fully take over the mafia and then knock off the Italian mob.
[3:15:30.800 --> 3:15:34.800]  Yeah, there's no question about this. We're talking about history now.
[3:15:34.800 --> 3:15:39.800]  This is not difficult to document that there's always been a very close working relationship
[3:15:39.800 --> 3:15:47.800]  between the coast of Nostra, the mafia, and government so-called security agencies.
[3:15:47.800 --> 3:15:50.800]  In fact, there's some people that move back and forth.
[3:15:50.800 --> 3:15:56.800]  Some of the most fascinating information that's come out, in my opinion, regarding the Kennedy assassination,
[3:15:56.800 --> 3:16:07.800]  is that there appears to be a very close operational team put together, partly involving the Chicago mob
[3:16:07.800 --> 3:16:15.800]  and partly involving government agencies, primarily into the direction of the CIA, but not necessarily limited to the CIA.
[3:16:15.800 --> 3:16:18.800]  There was a merger there and these people worked together.
[3:16:18.800 --> 3:16:22.800]  They might compete once in a while. Sometimes they work together.
[3:16:22.800 --> 3:16:28.800]  When you come away from that, you put the book down, you put down the magazine or the newspaper or whatever source,
[3:16:28.800 --> 3:16:33.800]  and you stare into space and all of a sudden you say, oh my gosh, I see now why they work together.
[3:16:33.800 --> 3:16:35.800]  They have the same mentality.
[3:16:35.800 --> 3:16:40.800]  These are the people that have created a crime syndicate inside our government.
[3:16:40.800 --> 3:16:43.800]  Our government has been taken over by a crime syndicate.
[3:16:43.800 --> 3:16:47.800]  Once that hits you, I mean it's really a blow for a guy like me.
[3:16:47.800 --> 3:16:54.800]  I was raised, you know, a very patriotic kid. I thought America was the land of the free and the home of the brave
[3:16:54.800 --> 3:16:57.800]  and I had heard all of this and I know that it was at one time,
[3:16:57.800 --> 3:17:04.800]  but I never realized that through most of my younger years that the America I knew and the America I had revered
[3:17:04.800 --> 3:17:09.800]  was gradually being stolen by this organized syndicate, this crime syndicate.
[3:17:09.800 --> 3:17:16.800]  So anyway, that's a harsh reality and I don't expect many people to say, oh yeah, he's got it.
[3:17:16.800 --> 3:17:21.800]  They'll probably think this guy's crazy, but I guarantee you once you start reading some of those history books
[3:17:21.800 --> 3:17:25.800]  and really looking behind the scenes, you're going to come to that conclusion.
[3:17:25.800 --> 3:17:33.800]  Well, I have read no exaggeration, more than 100 books, mainline history books on World War II,
[3:17:33.800 --> 3:17:39.800]  and the declassified Nazi files of how Hitler got the power, then what he did to secure power.
[3:17:39.800 --> 3:17:46.800]  All he was doing was constantly trying to stop the communist conspiracy in the government.
[3:17:46.800 --> 3:17:49.800]  He was constantly trying to stop the Freemason conspiracy.
[3:17:49.800 --> 3:17:55.800]  He was even suspicious of Catholic groups because he didn't think he fully controlled them, though some backed him.
[3:17:55.800 --> 3:18:03.800]  And it's all about him securing his power structure from the other mafias that were in the government.
[3:18:03.800 --> 3:18:10.800]  Well yeah, gangs often have to do that. They're always worrying about each other. They unite sometimes
[3:18:10.800 --> 3:18:16.800]  because the common enemy in a way is the public because they've got to fleece the public,
[3:18:16.800 --> 3:18:21.800]  so they'll sometimes cooperate on that. But people are fighting for turf.
[3:18:21.800 --> 3:18:25.800]  I don't think it's much different than street gangs in a big city.
[3:18:25.800 --> 3:18:28.800]  Yeah, they often compete with each other.
[3:18:28.800 --> 3:18:33.800]  Amazing, G. Edward Griffin. I've got a lot of questions to throw out, a lot of different angles and places to go.
[3:18:33.800 --> 3:18:39.800]  I want to come back and take a few calls just to mix it up a bit because we usually wait till the end for calls.
[3:18:39.800 --> 3:18:43.800]  But then I want to talk about all the exciting things that are happening right now
[3:18:43.800 --> 3:18:50.800]  and the explosive growth curve of the awakening we're seeing and where you see that going.
[3:18:50.800 --> 3:18:54.800]  We've got a minute or so. Start getting into it now if you can.
[3:18:54.800 --> 3:19:00.800]  Well yeah, that probably would benefit from a little thought, but what the heck, let's just jump in and swim.
[3:19:00.800 --> 3:19:12.800]  There's no doubt that there is a very rise in public awakening of the fact that their own government has been taken over
[3:19:12.800 --> 3:19:17.800]  or heavily influenced by this criminal syndicate that I've been talking about.
[3:19:17.800 --> 3:19:24.800]  They're beginning to realize that the politicians and the bureaucrats in Washington that we generally refer to as our government
[3:19:24.800 --> 3:19:33.800]  really consist of people and that these people have loyalties that are not to the Constitution and not to the people of the United States.
[3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:41.800]  They have loyalties to their inner group. They have loyalties to the concept of internationalism, what they finally call the New World Order.
[3:19:41.800 --> 3:19:48.800]  These people are running the show. I mean there are teams supposedly and yet they're really playing for the other side
[3:19:48.800 --> 3:19:52.800]  and people are waking up to that. The question is what are they going to do about it?
[3:19:52.800 --> 3:19:57.800]  Alright, stay there. We're going to come back and continue to discuss this with G. Edward Griffin.
[3:19:57.800 --> 3:20:12.800]  We'll give you his websites as well and take your calls.
[3:20:28.800 --> 3:20:35.800]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[3:20:35.800 --> 3:21:01.800]  Herb Kay was right. His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[3:21:01.800 --> 3:21:07.800]  This is not a drill. Repeat. This is not a drill.
[3:21:07.800 --> 3:21:09.800]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[3:21:09.800 --> 3:21:16.800]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[3:21:16.800 --> 3:21:21.800]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[3:21:21.800 --> 3:21:26.800]  You'll learn step by step battle-hardened techniques where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them.
[3:21:26.800 --> 3:21:33.800]  How to create the perfect hiding place as well as the places you should never hide your guns under any circumstance.
[3:21:33.800 --> 3:21:40.800]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[3:21:40.800 --> 3:21:57.800]  But listen up. For security reasons the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[3:21:57.800 --> 3:22:12.800]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:22:12.800 --> 3:22:36.800]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:22:36.800 --> 3:23:04.800]  As the economy continues to decline,
[3:23:04.800 --> 3:23:10.800]  patriots across a nation are preparing for the worst.
[3:23:10.800 --> 3:23:15.800]  The world is changing fast. Are you fully prepared?
[3:23:15.800 --> 3:23:18.800]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[3:23:18.800 --> 3:23:29.800]  At www.patriotfood.com we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and 6 varieties of canned meat for half price.
[3:23:29.800 --> 3:23:40.800]  For survivalistseeds.com we now offer 50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over 10,000 heirloom seeds.
[3:23:40.800 --> 3:23:45.800]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[3:23:45.800 --> 3:24:00.800]  www.patriotfood.com and www.survivalistseeds.com.
[3:24:00.800 --> 3:24:16.800]  What are we going to do about it?
[3:24:16.800 --> 3:24:41.800]  I think that's another prototype of what the rest of the world should do.
[3:24:41.800 --> 3:24:52.800]  I don't think that these guys thought of themselves as conspirators.
[3:24:52.800 --> 3:25:00.800]  They thought of themselves as being shrewd businessmen and in a weird way being high-minded citizens.
[3:25:00.800 --> 3:25:04.800]  They really thought that they were putting together a system.
[3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:12.800]  Although it was to their benefit, it was going to be good for the country.
[3:25:12.800 --> 3:25:15.800]  It took me a while to come to that conclusion.
[3:25:15.800 --> 3:25:19.800]  That's what David Rockefeller says in a lot of internal minutes that have come out.
[3:25:19.800 --> 3:25:25.800]  We bankers, no best. We need to, eugenics is good. We're going to take over for you.
[3:25:25.800 --> 3:25:27.800]  You don't know what's best for you.
[3:25:27.800 --> 3:25:37.800]  Exactly. That's the collectivist's mind. They really believe that stuff and it's clear when you read their letters and internal memos.
[3:25:37.800 --> 3:25:41.800]  They didn't think they were conspirators because they didn't think they were doing anything wrong.
[3:25:41.800 --> 3:25:49.800]  They certainly weren't doing anything illegal because they were drafting the law that would make their plan quite legal.
[3:25:49.800 --> 3:25:58.800]  They were doing perhaps what we should be doing is meeting and saying, okay, let's draft a piece of legislation that unravels some of the old legislation.
[3:25:58.800 --> 3:26:02.800]  You mean commoners writing legislation?
[3:26:02.800 --> 3:26:07.800]  Well, maybe not commoners. Maybe we're common, but I don't think we're too common.
[3:26:07.800 --> 3:26:11.800]  I wish there were more of us. Then I'd say yes, commoners.
[3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:21.800]  But no, I think that brings up a really good point because there's sort of an implied expectation among a lot of newly awakening people that, well,
[3:26:21.800 --> 3:26:27.800]  we've got to get 51% of the population on board before anything can happen because this is a democracy, isn't it?
[3:26:27.800 --> 3:26:30.800]  And the majority must rule and all of that.
[3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:38.800]  But the reality is that always throughout history and certainly throughout American history, the country has been led by a very small people.
[3:26:38.800 --> 3:26:43.800]  Percentage-wise, way less than 3% of the population have always led this country.
[3:26:43.800 --> 3:26:48.800]  And that's true of every country in the world. The others would just go along with whatever...
[3:26:48.800 --> 3:26:57.800]  And that's why the conspirators are so scared of us because I'd say we conservatively have 15% that are now really hardcore awake and all the polls show that,
[3:26:57.800 --> 3:27:01.800]  and 60%, 70% that are really upset and ready to be awakened.
[3:27:01.800 --> 3:27:05.800]  Well, that's true, but the rest of that formula is the catch.
[3:27:05.800 --> 3:27:10.800]  It's not just the numbers. Yes, well, I would say we have 15% or maybe more.
[3:27:10.800 --> 3:27:15.800]  But the other part of the equation is where are these people? Who are they? What power do they have?
[3:27:15.800 --> 3:27:20.800]  Well, our 15% doesn't hold enough power to match their 1%.
[3:27:20.800 --> 3:27:27.800]  Because the collectivists have burrowed into all the honeypots, like parasites, and they're up there greedily running everything,
[3:27:27.800 --> 3:27:34.800]  and they see us waking up so they go, hire SWAT teams, build armored fortresses, scan them, control them.
[3:27:34.800 --> 3:27:43.800]  They're waking up and we're sucking off of them. No! We're collectivists. We're saving you from global warming.
[3:27:43.800 --> 3:27:47.800]  I love that, Alec. You ever think of going into show business?
[3:27:47.800 --> 3:27:51.800]  I'm sorry I was having some fun.
[3:27:51.800 --> 3:27:55.800]  Yeah, it is fun, but it's pretty accurate too, amazingly so.
[3:27:55.800 --> 3:28:00.800]  They probably don't sound hysterical, but possibly inside their head, they're thinking that way.
[3:28:00.800 --> 3:28:09.800]  But that is it, exactly. Our 15% or 20% and it's growing just can't match their 1% or half a percent,
[3:28:09.800 --> 3:28:14.800]  because as you say, they're in all the honeypots. They're in what we call the power centers of society.
[3:28:14.800 --> 3:28:19.800]  They control the government. They control the military. They control the media.
[3:28:19.800 --> 3:28:27.800]  So that gives that 1% a tremendous lever of power over the rest of the population.
[3:28:27.800 --> 3:28:33.800]  So back to the question, what do we do about it? We have to become influential in those same honeypots.
[3:28:33.800 --> 3:28:38.800]  We have to move into those areas of influence. That's what we should be doing.
[3:28:38.800 --> 3:28:43.800]  Not just saying, oh my goodness, we ought to do this and write a good paper on all these things.
[3:28:43.800 --> 3:28:46.800]  Well, gee, Edward, do you think there, and we'll talk more about solutions when we come back and go to calls,
[3:28:46.800 --> 3:28:50.800]  but clearly, and they even say this is some of their white papers, Cass Sunstein at the White House,
[3:28:50.800 --> 3:28:54.800]  that because we're waking up, because we're trying to take over the states peacefully,
[3:28:54.800 --> 3:29:00.800]  because we are going with the long view of history that you and others have rightfully called for as historians,
[3:29:00.800 --> 3:29:05.800]  they are now racing to the finish line and trying to put their control grid in
[3:29:05.800 --> 3:29:10.800]  to try to checkmate us before we build up enough of our initiative to defeat them.
[3:29:10.800 --> 3:29:18.800]  That's it, exactly. And there's some debate as to whether or not they've already reached that point.
[3:29:18.800 --> 3:29:25.800]  I don't think they have, but I think they're very close to it. I mean, the two colors of sovereignty
[3:29:25.800 --> 3:29:34.800]  are monetary sovereignty and military sovereignty, whether racing right now to get rid of American monetary sovereignty
[3:29:34.800 --> 3:29:40.800]  and whether the military is really sovereign or not. It's up for debate too, but it's certainly no debate.
[3:29:40.800 --> 3:29:43.800]  Stay there. Let's come back and talk about it.
[3:29:43.800 --> 3:29:48.800]  And to transfer all our laws over to the UN and regional government ships, G. Edward Griffin,
[3:29:48.800 --> 3:29:51.800]  one of those evil people straight ahead.
[3:29:51.800 --> 3:30:18.800]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:18.800 --> 3:30:22.800]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders,
[3:30:22.800 --> 3:30:26.800]  they'll ship a fourth week of food free. That's buy three, get one free.
[3:30:26.800 --> 3:30:29.800]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[3:30:29.800 --> 3:30:33.800]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food,
[3:30:33.800 --> 3:30:37.800]  passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[3:30:37.800 --> 3:30:40.800]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[3:30:40.800 --> 3:30:50.800]  Another example, buy nine months worth of food and get three months free. You've got to go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[3:30:50.800 --> 3:31:00.800]  Or call 800-409-5633. Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[3:31:02.800 --> 3:31:06.800]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:31:06.800 --> 3:31:10.800]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:31:10.800 --> 3:31:15.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[3:31:15.800 --> 3:31:21.800]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[3:31:21.800 --> 3:31:26.800]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:31:26.800 --> 3:31:36.800]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:31:36.800 --> 3:31:42.800]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and their arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:31:42.800 --> 3:31:49.800]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[3:31:49.800 --> 3:32:00.800]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:32:01.800 --> 3:32:08.800]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[3:32:08.800 --> 3:32:14.800]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[3:32:14.800 --> 3:32:21.800]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[3:32:21.800 --> 3:32:26.800]  Alchivision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[3:32:26.800 --> 3:32:34.800]  Using alkalision pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[3:32:34.800 --> 3:32:39.800]  Simply put, 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[3:32:39.800 --> 3:32:44.800]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[3:32:44.800 --> 3:32:50.800]  Order your bottle of Alchivision Plasma pH drops now by going directly to Alchivision.com.
[3:32:50.800 --> 3:32:57.800]  That's A-L-K-A-Vision.com, or by calling 269-409-1776.
[3:32:57.800 --> 3:33:09.800]  Music
[3:33:09.800 --> 3:33:14.800]  We're going back to G. Edward Griffin here in just a moment, and then straight to your phone calls.
[3:33:14.800 --> 3:33:16.800]  Always great to have him spending time with us.
[3:33:16.800 --> 3:33:23.800]  We're going to give you some of his websites as well, full of solutions, free videos, articles you name it,
[3:33:23.800 --> 3:33:29.800]  and an organization, Freedom Force International, trying to organize for the long view, the long haul.
[3:33:29.800 --> 3:33:35.800]  Because as Ron Paul and others have said, as the oppression intensifies, more people are going to be looking for solutions.
[3:33:35.800 --> 3:33:37.800]  And the establishment puts out counterfeit solutions.
[3:33:37.800 --> 3:33:41.800]  They even have written books about this to try to control opposition.
[3:33:41.800 --> 3:33:43.800]  William F. Buckley taking over the conservative movement.
[3:33:43.800 --> 3:33:46.800]  We see the Republicans taking over the Tea Party.
[3:33:46.800 --> 3:33:50.800]  Obama creating a fake coffee party, stealing our idea of two months ago.
[3:33:50.800 --> 3:33:53.800]  But ours was to truly take back the Tea Parties.
[3:33:53.800 --> 3:33:56.800]  This is Obama creating really an illegal alien party.
[3:33:56.800 --> 3:33:57.800]  We've analyzed it.
[3:33:57.800 --> 3:33:58.800]  It's mainly illegal aliens.
[3:33:58.800 --> 3:34:00.800]  But now they call it the coffee party.
[3:34:00.800 --> 3:34:01.800]  Oh, we're the true Americans.
[3:34:01.800 --> 3:34:07.800]  We're 10,000 illegal aliens out here with an Obama operative, and the media is like, it's so grassroots.
[3:34:07.800 --> 3:34:08.800]  Lying to everyone.
[3:34:08.800 --> 3:34:10.800]  We're going back to G. Edward Griffin here in just a moment.
[3:34:10.800 --> 3:34:17.800]  But I want to tell you about one of the sponsors that's made today's radio show possible, Front Sight Firearms Training.
[3:34:17.800 --> 3:34:20.800]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[3:34:20.800 --> 3:34:27.800]  Dr. Ignatius Piazza is offering a five days of firearms training at their Perump, Nevada facility.
[3:34:27.800 --> 3:34:30.800]  The no-drill instructor tough guy attitude place.
[3:34:30.800 --> 3:34:31.800]  Awesome.
[3:34:31.800 --> 3:34:32.800]  It's a family event.
[3:34:32.800 --> 3:34:33.800]  Two-day, five-day, four-day events.
[3:34:33.800 --> 3:34:37.800]  But if you do the five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute
[3:34:37.800 --> 3:34:42.800]  and secure a 30-stake concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar, it's very inexpensive, great value.
[3:34:42.800 --> 3:34:48.800]  If you act fast, he will give you a Springfield Armory XT pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:50.800]  It is not enough to just own firearms.
[3:34:50.800 --> 3:34:52.800]  You need to know how to use them.
[3:34:52.800 --> 3:34:56.800]  Also, a lot of great free stuff on the Front Sight website, FrontSight.com.
[3:34:56.800 --> 3:34:57.800]  And a newsletter.
[3:34:57.800 --> 3:34:58.800]  Check it out today.
[3:34:58.800 --> 3:35:01.800]  FrontSight.com at the front of your firearm.
[3:35:01.800 --> 3:35:02.800]  The Front Sight.
[3:35:02.800 --> 3:35:04.800]  FrontSight.com.
[3:35:04.800 --> 3:35:06.800]  Check them out today.
[3:35:06.800 --> 3:35:07.800]  Okay.
[3:35:07.800 --> 3:35:10.800]  Oh, by the way, we are being hacked again.
[3:35:10.800 --> 3:35:17.800]  We were hit with a distributed denial-of-service attack last year on Info Wars and Prison Planet
[3:35:17.800 --> 3:35:23.800]  when we were exposing the swine flu at the height of the government hysteria, now proven to be a hoax.
[3:35:23.800 --> 3:35:28.800]  And we were hit yesterday, and it took down Prison Planet.tv for about three hours.
[3:35:28.800 --> 3:35:30.800]  There was some other stuff going on with the other sides.
[3:35:30.800 --> 3:35:31.800]  We beefed those up.
[3:35:31.800 --> 3:35:32.800]  It wasn't too bad of a problem.
[3:35:32.800 --> 3:35:37.800]  They're now hitting us again since about one o'clock today, about an hour and a half ago.
[3:35:37.800 --> 3:35:38.800]  But we've beefed it up.
[3:35:38.800 --> 3:35:42.800]  People can still get on, watch the films, watch the live show right now.
[3:35:42.800 --> 3:35:45.800]  Simulcast at Prison Planet.tv and Living Color.
[3:35:45.800 --> 3:35:49.800]  And read my book, Paul Watson's book, all the accesses there.
[3:35:49.800 --> 3:35:57.800]  So counter this attempted censorship by getting a Prison Planet.tv membership, six years up and running in April coming up.
[3:35:57.800 --> 3:35:59.800]  Okay, going back to G. Edward Griffin.
[3:35:59.800 --> 3:36:02.800]  G. Edward, when I was doing my David Rockefeller imitations, I was interrupting you.
[3:36:02.800 --> 3:36:06.800]  So you were talking about solutions to kick out the parasites.
[3:36:06.800 --> 3:36:10.800]  I think number one, my job is to expose them for the criminal parasites they are.
[3:36:10.800 --> 3:36:12.800]  The citizens need to do that to awaken more.
[3:36:12.800 --> 3:36:23.800]  But with the awakened mass we have, we have to start moving into the power centers to re-infuse the Bill of Rights Constitution and rugged individualism.
[3:36:23.800 --> 3:36:24.800]  Please continue.
[3:36:24.800 --> 3:36:25.800]  Well, that pretty well sums it.
[3:36:25.800 --> 3:36:28.800]  All I can do is cover the same ground, Alex.
[3:36:28.800 --> 3:36:37.800]  The fact of the matter is that humans have this instinct to follow and to cluster into groups and follow leaders.
[3:36:37.800 --> 3:36:39.800]  And we have this herd instinct.
[3:36:39.800 --> 3:36:40.800]  There's no denying it.
[3:36:40.800 --> 3:36:49.800]  And so we tend to follow the opinion leaders of our country or the political leaders of our country.
[3:36:49.800 --> 3:36:54.800]  Before we make up our minds, we say, well, what do they say about this on the news?
[3:36:54.800 --> 3:36:55.800]  You know what that sort of thing?
[3:36:55.800 --> 3:36:58.800]  It's silly, but everybody has that instinct.
[3:36:58.800 --> 3:37:07.800]  And so our opponents have figured that out long ago and they decided, OK, we'll just be the leadership of all of these power centers and opinion-forming groups.
[3:37:07.800 --> 3:37:11.800]  And then 1% or less of us can control the other 99%.
[3:37:11.800 --> 3:37:12.800]  No problem.
[3:37:12.800 --> 3:37:13.800]  And they're right.
[3:37:13.800 --> 3:37:17.800]  Actually, that's the way it's always done, but they have perfected it.
[3:37:17.800 --> 3:37:20.800]  They've made a real science out of it here in this country.
[3:37:20.800 --> 3:37:27.800]  And so the solution is not just to say, my goodness, what are we going to do with the solution is to reverse that process.
[3:37:27.800 --> 3:37:36.800]  We have to go into those areas of influence and become the new leaders and replace the old leaders.
[3:37:36.800 --> 3:37:37.800]  That's all there is to it.
[3:37:37.800 --> 3:37:39.800]  There is no other solution.
[3:37:39.800 --> 3:37:48.800]  The idea that, well, if we can just find one man, one man like Ron Paul or somebody else and put him in the White House, that'll take care of everything.
[3:37:48.800 --> 3:37:50.800]  Well, that's nonsense.
[3:37:50.800 --> 3:37:59.800]  One man, first of all, is not going to get elected if you've got all of the media against him and the educational system against him and all the unions against him.
[3:37:59.800 --> 3:38:02.800]  And everybody's against these organizations, I should say.
[3:38:02.800 --> 3:38:08.800]  Maybe the people would be for him, but the people would be convinced that he doesn't stand a chance because of what the media says.
[3:38:08.800 --> 3:38:09.800]  And so forth.
[3:38:09.800 --> 3:38:16.800]  So you could never get the man elected into the White House in the first place without having some influence of these other power centers.
[3:38:16.800 --> 3:38:26.800]  But even if you did take that example, just a hypothetical example, he wouldn't be able to do anything because he'd be blocked on every side.
[3:38:26.800 --> 3:38:28.800]  And by the way, Ron Paul has said that.
[3:38:28.800 --> 3:38:35.800]  He said he's just a focal point of education to run other campaign for liberty type people at the state and federal level.
[3:38:35.800 --> 3:38:41.800]  And that it's all part of a process and that it's the power of the people that is going to do this.
[3:38:41.800 --> 3:38:51.800]  And then you take it one step further and say that even if he were not blocked and that he could do great and wonderful things,
[3:38:51.800 --> 3:38:56.800]  he wouldn't because the kind of guy we're talking about would want to follow the Constitution.
[3:38:56.800 --> 3:39:02.800]  And the Constitution says that the president doesn't do anything except follow the orders of Congress.
[3:39:02.800 --> 3:39:03.800]  And that's what he has said.
[3:39:03.800 --> 3:39:05.800]  That's the problem.
[3:39:05.800 --> 3:39:06.800]  That's exactly the problem.
[3:39:06.800 --> 3:39:12.800]  And so we say, well, let's put a man in a white horse in charge and just let him be a dictator for us.
[3:39:12.800 --> 3:39:14.800]  No, no, no, no.
[3:39:14.800 --> 3:39:17.800]  It doesn't work that way or we don't want it to work that way.
[3:39:17.800 --> 3:39:31.800]  So we're back to the drawing board, which is the only way to solve this problem in my view is to ride the wave of this mass educational awareness that you and I and others are trying to create.
[3:39:31.800 --> 3:39:41.800]  And then out of the mass numbers that come forth, there will be maybe 1% of those people who will say, by colleague, I'm going to go into politics,
[3:39:41.800 --> 3:39:46.800]  or I'm going to stand up at my union meetings, or I'm going to become influential here and there.
[3:39:46.800 --> 3:39:48.800]  I'm going to be part of the new leadership.
[3:39:48.800 --> 3:39:51.800]  And that is when things finally begin to happen.
[3:39:51.800 --> 3:39:54.800]  And that's going to take a little time, but it's a proven formula.
[3:39:54.800 --> 3:40:00.800]  We know it'll work and I'm happy to say that right now I'm convinced it is going to work.
[3:40:00.800 --> 3:40:03.800]  Continue.
[3:40:03.800 --> 3:40:05.800]  Well, how do I think it's going to work?
[3:40:05.800 --> 3:40:07.800]  I see it already happening.
[3:40:07.800 --> 3:40:14.800]  We get letters all the time, emails, phone calls from people saying, you know, we've decided to follow your advice.
[3:40:14.800 --> 3:40:21.800]  We ran for city council six months ago and, lo and behold, we won.
[3:40:21.800 --> 3:40:28.800]  And somebody will say, well, I've decided this year I'm going to declare my candidacy in the congressional seat in my district.
[3:40:28.800 --> 3:40:36.800]  Yes, it's held right now by a very staunch, well-known political figure, but nobody really likes them.
[3:40:36.800 --> 3:40:40.800]  It's just that nobody has a choice, so we're going to offer a choice.
[3:40:40.800 --> 3:40:43.800]  Well, this is just the beginning of that kind of thing.
[3:40:43.800 --> 3:40:48.800]  Once every year, we have thousands of people making that kind of a decision.
[3:40:48.800 --> 3:40:57.800]  And if they have the smarts of being able to organize a well-run, well-thought-out and well-funded political campaign,
[3:40:57.800 --> 3:41:00.800]  that starts to happen and it is starting to happen now.
[3:41:00.800 --> 3:41:09.800]  But once this wave becomes large enough, I think that's the point at the tipping point, but we can restore the republic.
[3:41:09.800 --> 3:41:11.800]  And let's be clear about this.
[3:41:11.800 --> 3:41:19.800]  We lost nine out of ten, conservatively, of the battles against the British during that seven-year war,
[3:41:19.800 --> 3:41:24.800]  but it was the perseverance and with a few little victories like Trenton,
[3:41:24.800 --> 3:41:30.800]  then that began the shift of momentum as people began to realize they did have power.
[3:41:30.800 --> 3:41:31.800]  They could win.
[3:41:31.800 --> 3:41:32.800]  So take a Debra Medina.
[3:41:32.800 --> 3:41:36.800]  She runs for governor, gets 19 percentage points out of nowhere.
[3:41:36.800 --> 3:41:41.800]  That spurred masses of other people to start running in their states.
[3:41:41.800 --> 3:41:47.800]  So we may not win every time, but we're out there getting the message out, just like Ron Paul didn't win in 2008,
[3:41:47.800 --> 3:41:56.800]  but it got the real issues out there about the inflation tax, the wars that conservatives don't have to be warmongers.
[3:41:56.800 --> 3:41:59.800]  He won the CPAC straw poll.
[3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:06.800]  But the bigger issue is once we support patriot candidates and if they start flip-flopping, you've got to drop them immediately.
[3:42:06.800 --> 3:42:12.800]  There has to be a code that we don't just run and then start getting some power and flip-flop.
[3:42:12.800 --> 3:42:14.800]  If that happens, you've got to drop somebody.
[3:42:14.800 --> 3:42:20.800]  You've got to go with people that are steadfast and have proven that they won't waffle, that they won't give in.
[3:42:20.800 --> 3:42:22.800]  But take the global warming hoax.
[3:42:22.800 --> 3:42:24.800]  It's completely collapsing.
[3:42:24.800 --> 3:42:26.800]  The masses are waking up to it.
[3:42:26.800 --> 3:42:27.800]  The establishment doesn't care though.
[3:42:27.800 --> 3:42:30.800]  They say they're going ahead with it, but so that fight will continue.
[3:42:30.800 --> 3:42:33.800]  But we're seeing that we're gaining momentum.
[3:42:33.800 --> 3:42:34.800]  We're getting purchase.
[3:42:34.800 --> 3:42:36.800]  We're getting a toehold.
[3:42:36.800 --> 3:42:37.800]  We're having successes.
[3:42:37.800 --> 3:42:39.800]  The flu was exposed as a fraud.
[3:42:39.800 --> 3:42:41.800]  Record numbers of people said no.
[3:42:41.800 --> 3:42:50.800]  The Wall Street Journal reported the lowest level ever for both seasonal and the swine flu shot and, lo and behold, less flu.
[3:42:50.800 --> 3:42:52.800]  Because we know the flu shots giving people the flu.
[3:42:52.800 --> 3:42:53.800]  Many studies show.
[3:42:53.800 --> 3:42:56.800]  We're seeing victories against so far the healthcare bill.
[3:42:56.800 --> 3:42:58.800]  It's completely unpopular.
[3:42:58.800 --> 3:43:00.800]  The Democrats are destroying themselves if they pass it.
[3:43:00.800 --> 3:43:04.800]  But the point is we do see the momentum really shifting.
[3:43:04.800 --> 3:43:15.800]  Well, yes, I'm glad you brought that up because although I think we all can take a great encouragement from that, there's an area involved in that issue that is generally being ignored.
[3:43:15.800 --> 3:43:27.800]  And it scares the heck out of me, which is that under these conditions it is extremely easy for someone from the other side to provide false leadership.
[3:43:27.800 --> 3:43:45.800]  I can tell you that, well, what's an example, the Federal Reserve system, by which I know a little, it was actually sold to the American people, not entirely, but partially, because the very people who drafted the Federal Reserve
[3:43:45.800 --> 3:43:49.800]  pretended that it was, that they were opposed to it.
[3:43:49.800 --> 3:43:55.800]  In other words, they led their own opposition to make sure that the opposition would fail.
[3:43:55.800 --> 3:43:57.800]  And who is that today?
[3:43:57.800 --> 3:43:59.800]  It's Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin.
[3:43:59.800 --> 3:44:01.800]  I mean, clearly they're the Judas Iscariots.
[3:44:01.800 --> 3:44:02.800]  Exactly.
[3:44:02.800 --> 3:44:05.800]  I would certainly say that's an easy choice, but they're out there.
[3:44:05.800 --> 3:44:15.800]  And some of them, I'm sure that there are some of them that could come on your radio show and agree with everything you say and agree with everything I say and say a few other good things.
[3:44:15.800 --> 3:44:18.800]  And yet they could be just planning to get elected.
[3:44:18.800 --> 3:44:25.800]  So that people would say, ah, we got a good man elected, yet they won't do anything. They'll buckle, as you say.
[3:44:25.800 --> 3:44:34.800]  And that points to the fact that when we say that they're going to buckle or they're going to switch, it's because we've never asked these candidates what they really believe.
[3:44:34.800 --> 3:44:36.800]  We've seen what they said.
[3:44:36.800 --> 3:44:38.800]  We've heard what they said.
[3:44:38.800 --> 3:44:42.800]  We said, well, they're against the swine flu charade.
[3:44:42.800 --> 3:44:45.800]  They want to get us out of the war in the Middle East and so forth.
[3:44:45.800 --> 3:44:48.800]  Well, heck, Obama said that.
[3:44:48.800 --> 3:44:51.800]  But, you know, what they say is not important.
[3:44:51.800 --> 3:44:52.800]  It's what they do.
[3:44:52.800 --> 3:44:55.800]  And nobody's asking these candidates, what do they believe?
[3:44:55.800 --> 3:44:56.800]  What are their principles?
[3:44:56.800 --> 3:44:58.800]  What's their ideology?
[3:44:58.800 --> 3:45:04.800]  And that's where I come into the fore, because, as you know, with Freedom Force, we're totally focused on ideology.
[3:45:04.800 --> 3:45:10.800]  We have a creed of freedom, and we want our candidates who are going into office to say, yes, this is my creed.
[3:45:10.800 --> 3:45:11.800]  I believe this.
[3:45:11.800 --> 3:45:12.800]  These are not issues.
[3:45:12.800 --> 3:45:14.800]  These are principles, you know?
[3:45:14.800 --> 3:45:19.800]  I believe, you know, that the individual is more important than the group.
[3:45:19.800 --> 3:45:24.800]  And that the individual must not be sacrificed in the name of the group.
[3:45:24.800 --> 3:45:26.800]  That's a firm principle, you know?
[3:45:26.800 --> 3:45:31.800]  And we believe that all laws should apply to all groups of people equally.
[3:45:31.800 --> 3:45:33.800]  Not any exceptions.
[3:45:33.800 --> 3:45:34.800]  None.
[3:45:34.800 --> 3:45:35.800]  Zilch.
[3:45:35.800 --> 3:45:36.800]  Zilch.
[3:45:36.800 --> 3:45:37.800]  Nunca.
[3:45:37.800 --> 3:45:38.800]  You know, this is a principle.
[3:45:38.800 --> 3:45:44.800]  Well, anybody that says, yes, I believe that, would have to vote against all of this.
[3:45:44.800 --> 3:45:47.800]  Nunca's progressive income tax, for example.
[3:45:47.800 --> 3:45:49.800]  Does that treat all groups equally?
[3:45:49.800 --> 3:45:50.800]  No.
[3:45:50.800 --> 3:45:56.800]  It starts out from the very beginning to treat those who are making more money in a different class than those who are making less money.
[3:45:56.800 --> 3:46:01.800]  And those who have got certain political connections can get exemptions that other people cannot.
[3:46:01.800 --> 3:46:05.800]  If you're married and you've got 25 kids, you don't have to pay any tax.
[3:46:05.800 --> 3:46:09.800]  Whereas if you're not married and you have 25 kids, you do pay tax and so forth.
[3:46:09.800 --> 3:46:12.800]  This doesn't treat everybody the same.
[3:46:12.800 --> 3:46:17.800]  So anyway, my point is that now is the time for a lot of candidates to come forth,
[3:46:17.800 --> 3:46:22.800]  and they'll speak very brilliantly against all of the bad things that are going on.
[3:46:22.800 --> 3:46:26.800]  It's time to ask them, oh wait, okay, now we know what you're against.
[3:46:26.800 --> 3:46:27.800]  Now, what do you believe?
[3:46:27.800 --> 3:46:29.800]  What are you for?
[3:46:29.800 --> 3:46:30.800]  What are your principles?
[3:46:30.800 --> 3:46:33.800]  What kind of a new system are you going to create?
[3:46:33.800 --> 3:46:35.800]  And then just sit back and see what they say.
[3:46:35.800 --> 3:46:36.800]  All right.
[3:46:36.800 --> 3:46:38.800]  G. Everett Griffin, always amazing having you on.
[3:46:38.800 --> 3:46:41.800]  I want to take some calls here in the last 14 minutes we have,
[3:46:41.800 --> 3:46:44.800]  but fire out the websites for new listeners.
[3:46:44.800 --> 3:46:53.800]  Well, the commercial website where we sell books and videos and recordings is called realityzone.realityzone.com.
[3:46:53.800 --> 3:46:55.800]  You find about 100 different items there.
[3:46:55.800 --> 3:47:00.800]  But our think tank site where we talk about issues like we're discussing today,
[3:47:00.800 --> 3:47:04.800]  that's our organizational site for Freedom Force International.
[3:47:04.800 --> 3:47:10.800]  And the URL for that is freedomforceinternational.org.
[3:47:10.800 --> 3:47:16.800]  So that's the place I hope people will go and spend some time reading about these ideological issues.
[3:47:16.800 --> 3:47:17.800]  Absolutely.
[3:47:17.800 --> 3:47:19.800]  Let's go to Brian in Texas.
[3:47:19.800 --> 3:47:20.800]  You're on the air with G. Everett Griffin.
[3:47:20.800 --> 3:47:22.800]  Go ahead.
[3:47:22.800 --> 3:47:23.800]  How are you doing, Alex?
[3:47:23.800 --> 3:47:25.800]  Good, go ahead.
[3:47:25.800 --> 3:47:29.800]  Actually, one thing I wanted to mention, I think one thing you guys are,
[3:47:29.800 --> 3:47:32.800]  what we need to do is really take the wind out of the sails of these guys.
[3:47:32.800 --> 3:47:34.800]  Instead of using an elite to describe them anymore,
[3:47:34.800 --> 3:47:39.800]  we need to take that back out of any description of these guys because...
[3:47:39.800 --> 3:47:41.800]  The parasite criminals.
[3:47:41.800 --> 3:47:43.800]  The ruling criminals.
[3:47:43.800 --> 3:47:47.800]  Well, no, I just mean as far as correcting other individuals when we hear them saying it in the common day,
[3:47:47.800 --> 3:47:50.800]  even as far as like Obama's...
[3:47:50.800 --> 3:47:54.800]  Yeah, well, they call public servants authorities officials, and I always point that out.
[3:47:54.800 --> 3:47:56.800]  G. Everett, do you have a comment on that?
[3:47:56.800 --> 3:47:58.800]  Amen. That's about it.
[3:47:58.800 --> 3:48:00.800]  How about the king parasites?
[3:48:00.800 --> 3:48:01.800]  They make a big difference, don't they?
[3:48:01.800 --> 3:48:05.800]  And I think your caller's right. Brian is right. We give them too much respect.
[3:48:05.800 --> 3:48:06.800]  Well, what's a good term for them then?
[3:48:06.800 --> 3:48:12.800]  A king parasites, mafia rulers, illegitimate scum.
[3:48:12.800 --> 3:48:14.800]  I mean, what do you call them?
[3:48:14.800 --> 3:48:16.800]  I guess it depends on the occasion.
[3:48:16.800 --> 3:48:18.800]  You don't want to offend people.
[3:48:18.800 --> 3:48:20.800]  The object is not just to spit out...
[3:48:20.800 --> 3:48:22.800]  But what do we call the ruling class?
[3:48:22.800 --> 3:48:23.800]  The ruling criminals?
[3:48:23.800 --> 3:48:27.800]  What's wrong with the ruling class?
[3:48:27.800 --> 3:48:32.800]  Then let people decide for themselves whether they're criminals, you know?
[3:48:32.800 --> 3:48:37.800]  I think sometimes we tend to force our editorial conclusions on people.
[3:48:37.800 --> 3:48:42.800]  I think we'd probably be better off if we just stuck more with the historical facts
[3:48:42.800 --> 3:48:45.800]  and let people put the twist to it that they want.
[3:48:45.800 --> 3:48:47.800]  Okay, good point. Anything else, Brian?
[3:48:47.800 --> 3:48:51.800]  Yeah, I actually had one other point I wanted to ask G. Edward directly.
[3:48:51.800 --> 3:48:53.800]  The release of this, and Alex, you touched on it earlier in the week.
[3:48:53.800 --> 3:48:57.800]  Adam Kedon issue, if they found him, they didn't find him.
[3:48:57.800 --> 3:49:01.800]  Do you think that's a pretext of them trying to gain sympathy for homeland security
[3:49:01.800 --> 3:49:07.800]  to come in and start going after tea party goers, conspiracy theorists, things like that?
[3:49:07.800 --> 3:49:09.800]  I think so. Go ahead, Alex.
[3:49:09.800 --> 3:49:10.800]  No, no, go ahead.
[3:49:10.800 --> 3:49:16.800]  Well, I think so. Yeah, they want to keep that mentality of fear always present.
[3:49:16.800 --> 3:49:21.800]  So they've got to talk about terrorist threats and red alerts and yellow alerts and so forth.
[3:49:21.800 --> 3:49:23.800]  That's constantly there.
[3:49:23.800 --> 3:49:26.800]  Well, Governor Ridge admitted in his book last year they issued fake alerts.
[3:49:26.800 --> 3:49:27.800]  Thank you, Brian.
[3:49:27.800 --> 3:49:28.800]  Thank you, Brian.
[3:49:28.800 --> 3:49:32.800]  And by the way, that's a violation of the Patriot Act to issue a fake terror threat.
[3:49:32.800 --> 3:49:36.800]  Let's talk to Doug in Tennessee. You're on the air, Doug.
[3:49:36.800 --> 3:49:39.800]  Hey, Alex, I want to deal with what Brian said.
[3:49:39.800 --> 3:49:45.800]  We need to stop calling them authorities and stop telling them that they have authorities.
[3:49:45.800 --> 3:49:46.800]  They're beyond their authority.
[3:49:46.800 --> 3:49:48.800]  They have power, but they don't have authorities.
[3:49:48.800 --> 3:49:53.800]  But I watched a video the other day that really inspired me.
[3:49:53.800 --> 3:49:55.800]  It's called The Solution.
[3:49:55.800 --> 3:49:58.800]  It's on YouTube, The Solution by Schaefer Cox.
[3:49:58.800 --> 3:50:04.800]  And you can find it also on LincolnCountyWatch.org and what they're doing.
[3:50:04.800 --> 3:50:07.800]  Good. Do you have a question for Robert Griffin?
[3:50:07.800 --> 3:50:09.800]  Well, this is the solution he was talking about.
[3:50:09.800 --> 3:50:11.800]  You know, what do we do?
[3:50:11.800 --> 3:50:19.800]  And what they're doing up there in Fairbanks, Alaska is setting up their own court and having
[3:50:19.800 --> 3:50:21.800]  a common law court.
[3:50:21.800 --> 3:50:25.800]  And they also have a militia for enforcement.
[3:50:25.800 --> 3:50:32.800]  And they have a call in line where people can call like a 911 type situation when their
[3:50:32.800 --> 3:50:36.800]  rights are being violated by even police officers.
[3:50:36.800 --> 3:50:40.800]  Well, I don't want to pass judgment on this, but I've seen this a hundred times a hundred.
[3:50:40.800 --> 3:50:43.800]  This is very dangerous what you're talking about.
[3:50:43.800 --> 3:50:44.800]  There is a common law.
[3:50:44.800 --> 3:50:50.800]  Our courts set up through the state constitutions are supposedly carrying it out, but they're
[3:50:50.800 --> 3:50:51.800]  not.
[3:50:51.800 --> 3:50:52.800]  But we'll talk.
[3:50:52.800 --> 3:50:56.800]  We'll get G. Edwards Griffin's take on what you just talked about on the other side.
[3:50:56.800 --> 3:51:06.800]  We'll be right back.
[3:51:06.800 --> 3:51:10.800]  Afraid to answer it?
[3:51:10.800 --> 3:51:14.800]  Did you know that debt settlement bankruptcy and attorneys will cost you about 10 times
[3:51:14.800 --> 3:51:17.800]  more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[3:51:17.800 --> 3:51:19.800]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[3:51:19.800 --> 3:51:21.800]  They are expensive payment plans.
[3:51:21.800 --> 3:51:26.800]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment plan?
[3:51:26.800 --> 3:51:30.800]  Zero debt in 90 days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed.

[3:52:07.800 --> 3:52:10.800]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:52:10.800 --> 3:52:15.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[3:52:15.800 --> 3:52:19.800]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress.
[3:52:19.800 --> 3:52:21.800]  And they really are calling the shots.
[3:52:21.800 --> 3:52:26.800]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:26.800 --> 3:52:29.800]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[3:52:29.800 --> 3:52:36.800]  The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:52:36.800 --> 3:52:38.800]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:40.800]  They're asking for more matches.
[3:52:40.800 --> 3:52:43.800]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:52:43.800 --> 3:52:45.800]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[3:52:45.800 --> 3:52:50.800]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[3:54:55.800 --> 3:55:17.800]  We love you.
[3:55:17.800 --> 3:55:26.800]  Well, I'm certainly not an expert on that, Alex, but I do have two rather strong thoughts on it.
[3:55:26.800 --> 3:55:32.800]  I think they're dangerous because although the people who are forming them today appear to be well-motivated,
[3:55:32.800 --> 3:55:38.800]  they appear to be reacting in righteous indignation, which I'm glad to see that,
[3:55:38.800 --> 3:55:46.800]  reacting against all the bad things that are being done by their national and regional governments.
[3:55:46.800 --> 3:55:52.800]  Still, they go out and they form these courts and these militias, but they have no rules.
[3:55:52.800 --> 3:56:00.800]  They have no limitations. They're really like a lynch mob in a way.
[3:56:00.800 --> 3:56:06.800]  There's no limit to their power, and really what they're doing is they're advocating the formation of a government.
[3:56:06.800 --> 3:56:15.800]  This is the essence of government, to use organized force to compel other people to comply with what you want them to do.
[3:56:15.800 --> 3:56:20.800]  Although they're sure in their mind that what they want other people to do is right,
[3:56:20.800 --> 3:56:26.800]  I don't see any rules and regulations. I don't see any constitutions. I don't see any limitations on their power.
[3:56:26.800 --> 3:56:29.800]  Well, no, they're going to say they're following the common law and the Constitution.
[3:56:29.800 --> 3:56:36.800]  My issue is the states are chartered by the people. We have the state constitutions.
[3:56:36.800 --> 3:56:40.800]  The counties are created through that. The cities are chartered by that.
[3:56:40.800 --> 3:56:45.800]  Are they so veta without a law? Can't go shut down a gun show?
[3:56:45.800 --> 3:56:49.800]  The only way these courts have any basis is a citizen's arrest.
[3:56:49.800 --> 3:56:54.800]  When you have lawless police operating outside the common law shutting down a gun show,
[3:56:54.800 --> 3:57:01.800]  the citizens have an innate right to say no to it, but the problem is the criminal government's going to come after you.
[3:57:01.800 --> 3:57:12.800]  The other issue is that even if all these constitutional issues were solved, how are they going to enforce it sooner or later?
[3:57:12.800 --> 3:57:19.800]  They're going to have to be able to get in the trenches and shoot it out with the established so-called authorities.
[3:57:19.800 --> 3:57:25.800]  They're playing a new game now. They're trying to say that they're a new government to the big mafia government
[3:57:25.800 --> 3:57:27.800]  instead of taking the system of the government back.
[3:57:27.800 --> 3:57:33.800]  All I'm saying is, folks, don't play in traffic. I think it's fine if you have committees and meetings
[3:57:33.800 --> 3:57:39.800]  and videotape it and hand out the citizen's commission verdict and then go to the grand jury with it.
[3:57:39.800 --> 3:57:46.800]  I think it's great to investigate or sue politicians. How many times have we read about these citizen courts
[3:57:46.800 --> 3:57:49.800]  and they go off and do something and then it turns into a nightmare?
[3:57:49.800 --> 3:57:58.800]  I like your expression, don't play in traffic. It's very dangerous. I don't think people have thought it all the way through.
[3:57:58.800 --> 3:58:05.800]  I've written a little bit on vigilante action and that's very close to this topic.
[3:58:05.800 --> 3:58:13.800]  Vigilantes have a very interesting history in America and generally it's a positive history, believe it or not.
[3:58:13.800 --> 3:58:23.800]  Vigilantes usually spring up when their local sheriff or some local government official who has duly authority has been abusing.
[3:58:23.800 --> 3:58:27.800]  G. Edward, we're out of time. I want to thank you for coming on but I want to add this.
[3:58:27.800 --> 3:58:35.800]  Covert vigilanteism has done some good. The issue is these people think by saying they have a court that makes it legal.
[3:58:35.800 --> 3:58:39.800]  If you're going to be a vigilante, you better watch your butt and be secretive.
[3:58:39.800 --> 3:58:42.800]  G. Edward, great job. Thanks for coming on with us.
