[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:05.000 --> 00:09.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:09.000 --> 00:14.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  Just like individual lives.
[00:26.000 --> 00:32.000]  That's because the planet orbits around the sun every 365 days, as you know,
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.000]  and generates the life on this planet.
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.000]  Is the main engine, the main energy source for life on this planet.
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.000]  And so one year has come and gone and died, literally died.
[00:46.000 --> 00:54.000]  And a new year has now begun in many time zones around the world 24 hours ago.
[00:54.000 --> 01:04.000]  And we are now into 2014, truly momentous year with all that is happening.
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.000]  It is the first day of January 2014.
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.000]  And we are hurtling into the battle, the fray, with the New World Order.
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  And we're going to be here for, again, the next three hours.
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.000]  We have John Bowne in Full Wars Nightly News Reporter and also radio producer,
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.000]  joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  Yesterday, he shot a report on 360 in Austin and filed that report this morning.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  Shot on his iPhone 4, I believe.
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  And it was a woman standing right beside her burning car on her cell phone.
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  Everyone driving by, not even caring.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  And then even some people on YouTube, this went right to YouTube today.
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.000]  It's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com are like big deal, you know.
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  People didn't stop because the fire is no big deal.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  And of course, John didn't catch it right away because he's yelling at her
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.000]  before he even turns the camera on, get away from the car.
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  He had to park down the street and run towards her.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  And so he ran about 200 yards, you know, towards her yelling, get away from the car.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  By the time he turns it on, you could see her about 10 feet away.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  And then she starts walking towards him about 50 feet as he meets her.
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  And she's still on her phone, obviously calling the fire department.
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  But the reason I mention this is not even our top story, it's just important.
[02:27.000 --> 02:34.000]  It ties into this mindset where they're fracking with such corrupt practices
[02:34.000 --> 02:41.000]  across the United States that the well water is catching on fire.
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.000]  There's safe ways to frack, by the way.
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.000]  There's that family that have come and gone and passed that were petroleum geologists,
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  you name it, people that work for refineries.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  There are very safe ways to do this.
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  But when you have this modern age, an example is BP,
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  and you have British Petroleum doing things like ordering
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  three different engineering companies that were all on site at the Deepwater Horizon.
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  Don't pour concrete in what they call mud, a mix, in as you drill
[03:15.000 --> 03:21.000]  so it doesn't back pressure and blow out and cause an undersea, you know,
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.000]  red-a-dare type explosion.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  Just dump water on top of it.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  That'll save us, you know, $15 million a day, I think was the number.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  And that was the head people in England calling the head people in Houston.
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  And then they literally had to fire multiple heads of crews
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  and send in other companies that were there as contractors to do it
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  because all the engineers said, this is going to explode.
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  And the engineers knew the math, knew the science,
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.000]  it was one of the deepest wells ever drilled, 30 plus thousand feet.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  They knew what was going to happen.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  But the delusional executives just knew they'd make more money
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  if they didn't have to spend the money on the concrete and the mud
[04:01.000 --> 04:07.000]  that was being premixed on the ground and then brought out to sea on big ships.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  And so they didn't want to have $15 million a day of that being dumped in the hole.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  $15 million a day.
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  All the transcripts of the radio chatter was recorded and logged.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  And they said, no, I'm not going to do it. You're relieved. You do it.
[04:22.000 --> 04:23.000]  This is going to explode.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  They actually had fist fights that came out later in court on the drilling rig.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  When people were ordered to do it, they're like, that's insane.
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  And people began to punch each other in the faces
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  because they knew they were about to blow up the oil rig.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  And it killed a bunch of people, folks.
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.000]  Killed people on land, killed all those fish, all the rest of it.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  This is the mental illness out there, the insanity.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information
[05:04.000 --> 05:06.000]  concerning you and your family's health.
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the northern hemisphere
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  Radiolactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[05:26.000 --> 05:32.000]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[05:44.000 --> 05:50.000]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[06:02.000 --> 06:06.000]  All of your filtration in one system, portable on the go.
[06:06.000 --> 06:10.000]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[06:10.000 --> 06:16.000]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilic acid
[06:16.000 --> 06:21.000]  advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic
[06:21.000 --> 06:27.000]  with new aqua medics advanced media, a removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[06:27.000 --> 06:30.000]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates.

[06:34.000 --> 06:40.000]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides,
[06:40.000 --> 06:45.000]  chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilic acid,
[06:45.000 --> 06:49.000]  the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[06:56.000 --> 07:00.000]  or by calling 888-253-3139.
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  The facts are in. The studies are legion.
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  and cognitive ability of the American people.
[07:10.000 --> 07:14.000]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.000]  Simple, dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[07:19.000 --> 07:23.000]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet,
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.000]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLife fluoride shield formulation,
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body,
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  but a whole host of toxic substances.
[07:41.000 --> 07:46.000]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.000]  Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[07:53.000 --> 07:58.000]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWars at the same time.
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[08:00.000 --> 08:18.000]  2014, Ag, we can hear the sirens.
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[08:25.000 --> 08:41.000]  The globalist are gathering in their masses just like witches at black masses.
[08:41.000 --> 08:45.000]  They are sorcerers of death's construction.
[08:45.000 --> 08:51.000]  That's a good way to describe the New World Order.
[08:51.000 --> 08:56.000]  As the war machine keeps turning.
[08:56.000 --> 09:02.000]  Death and hatred to mankind.
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  Poisoning.
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.000]  Poisoning their rain wash minds.
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are transmitting worldwide.
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  This is the first transmission that I've done in the new year.
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.000]  It is the first day of January 2014.
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  It's going to be live here for the next three hours.
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  Then InfoWars Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.000]  We have one of our reporters in here with breaking news on brain fog and zombiosis
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  that we're seeing intensify across the public.
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  People walking off the end of bridges into the ocean on their iPhones.
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.000]  People watching others be beaten until they're given concussions.
[09:43.000 --> 09:44.000]  Teeth knocked out broken ribs.
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.000]  No one helping them.
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  Police not helping them during racial attack.
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  Knockout games intensifying nationwide.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  Thanks to MSNBC race war promotion.
[09:55.000 --> 10:00.000]  Just so many incredible stories that we're going to be breaking down new,
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.000]  very important NSA developments where a new NSA document confirmed to be accurate
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  leaked out in the Snowden cache.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  Shows the NSA with their training slides, their PowerPoint slides,
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  calling the public zombies, making fun of everyone
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  and really, who didn't know that 1984 wouldn't come in 1984?
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  I mean, it's amazing.
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.000]  NSA slides with images of the Apple computer at making fun of everyone
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.000]  because we are the enemy.
[10:34.000 --> 10:41.000]  This is an open culture of naked tyranny in our faces, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.000]  And again, I want to thank you so much for joining us on this worldwide edition.
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  The first day of the new year, John Baum will be popping in at the bottom of the
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000]  hour in studio.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  We're going to air his report.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  He shot on the streets yesterday where a woman is just standing,
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  literally one or two feet from a burning car on the side of the highway
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  and no one is stopping to help her.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  No one is telling her get back.
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  And by the time he got the camera out running up to her,
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  she's about 10, 15 feet away and walking towards him.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  But the point is, is that there are people on YouTube saying,
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  hey, he shouldn't have stopped and helped her.
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.000]  She was fine.
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  It's okay to stand by a burning car that later completely was engulfed in flames
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  and that John Baum has video of from about 200 yards away.
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  And cars are driving right by the burning car before the fire department got there
[11:28.000 --> 11:29.000]  like they didn't care.
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  And I know that stretch of 360.
[11:31.000 --> 11:36.000]  There's a fire department about a mile away from there.
[11:36.000 --> 11:37.000]  But it's rush hour traffic.
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.000]  People run about 30 miles an hour on a normally 65 mile an hour road
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  just driving right by a burning car.
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  I mean, I see a burning car up ahead.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  I'm going to get on the shoulder.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  I'm going to even drive across the shoulder go the other way,
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  especially they got my kids with me.
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  Because you see one with Zardy got flame coming out of the bottom of it
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.000]  and smoke everywhere.
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  It's going to blow up when those gas tanks boil.
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  And again, this feeds into everything we're talking about
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  about this nation of spectators.
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  And you see this in other authoritarian countries like China
[12:07.000 --> 12:08.000]  where people will not render.
[12:08.000 --> 12:09.000]  I was a case.
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  That's going to be 10 years ago now where an Austin cop got hit by a car
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  at the corner of a four-way stop with his car sitting there.
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  He'd gotten out somebody run into him.
[12:19.000 --> 12:20.000]  It was like 45 minutes.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  He won't anyone even call the police.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  And he later died.
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  I mean, I see a cop, an old lady, a black guy, a white guy.
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  I don't care who you are, you know, run over in the side of the road.
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  I'm going to pull over and help you.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  And it's not because I'm some hero, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000]  It's a normal.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  I want you to help me.
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  And this is the spirit of tyranny we're dealing with.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  Just absolutely apathetic.
[12:43.000 --> 12:44.000]  Don't care.
[12:44.000 --> 12:50.000]  Don't care if Fukushima is belching out radiation.
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  Don't care if 90 plus percent of the reactors in the U.S. are leaking.
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  Don't care if fracking is being done so sloppily all over the country
[12:57.000 --> 13:05.000]  that water out of the local tap, out of the local water facility,
[13:05.000 --> 13:11.000]  also out of the wells is catching on fire.
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  It just goes on and on and on how people don't care anymore.
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  That's what comes with evil.
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.000]  Ah, those aren't babies.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  Kill 52 million of them in abortion.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  Ah, those aren't humans in Iraq.
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.000]  Kill a million of them with a fake war and cutting off their food in Madison.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  Oh, you know, whatever, a sod's a piece of garbage.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  Let Al Qaeda blow up all the churches.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  I don't care.
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  I care about me.
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  Those fools think that when you only care about yourself,
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  ah, let that lady's car burn.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  Let her stand right next to the car.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  Those people cared so little about her.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  They were delusional and were driving right by it,
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  slowing down to like five miles an hour from 30 miles an hour.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  There's video of this, looking at the burning car.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  A foot from it.
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  You're a foot from a car in your car
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  and you drive up and look at the black smoke you're breathing.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  Oh, look at the black smoke.
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  Let me drive right by that.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  And there's a woman standing
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  a foot and a half, two feet from it.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  And the car later blows up and there's pieces everywhere.
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.000]  And then people on YouTube think, we're weird.
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  And there's like a 20% negative vote on it.
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.000]  We usually have 97% support
[14:21.000 --> 14:30.000]  because the idea of having a brain is now illegal.
[14:30.000 --> 14:37.000]  We try to warn people about all this stuff.
[14:37.000 --> 14:46.000]  And it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  Because they think those of us that are warning everybody
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  that the ship's already gone into an iceberg,
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  that we made the ship hit the iceberg.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  So if they deny that we've hit an iceberg,
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  we magically, then we'll all be okay.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  But we've already hit the iceberg politically,
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  socially, culturally.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  I'll tell you what's wrong with people.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  They are a nation of mega spectators,
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  a world of spectators,
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  literally plugged in through their optic nerves
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.000]  and via audio as well
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  into the false reality
[15:21.000 --> 15:28.000]  of a proto-matrix system of television, movies, HD, 3D, all of it.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  And then the entire system is weaponized
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  and layered with different systems of propaganda,
[15:36.000 --> 15:42.000]  programming, overt, covert, messages, subliminal, on record,
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  hammering the general public's minds.
[15:46.000 --> 15:52.000]  And we are living in an incredible, dystopic science fiction movie.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  That's what's going on.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  The culture's been weaponized.
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  The media's been weaponized.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  The schools have been weaponized.
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  The police have been militarized.
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  The entire culture is turning in on itself.
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  And the globalists know how evil nature works.
[16:07.000 --> 16:08.000]  They're evil themselves,
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.000]  but they are programming the types of Deccan and evil they want
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.000]  into people so that they will not stand up for themselves
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  or anybody else as we are reclamated,
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.000]  as we are spiked, as we are removed,
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.000]  as we are decimated, as we are dumbed down,
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  as we are literally turned into soylent green.
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  You know they're passing laws in Europe
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  and trying to pass them in states like Florida
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  where you cannot be cremated because of the carbon it puts out
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.000]  and you cannot be buried because that takes up land use.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  You have to be dissolved in acid
[16:42.000 --> 16:45.000]  that is then turned into fertilizer
[16:45.000 --> 16:50.000]  and put on crops to produce corn that is fed to cows.
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.000]  Now just so you know, that is soylent green.
[16:54.000 --> 17:01.000]  110%.
[17:01.000 --> 17:06.000]  And the guys just found a CNBC article showing that.
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  So this is what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  We are going into a soylent green situation
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  and I get some areas that are overpopulated.
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.000]  I get there's a lot of toxic industries.
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  I get it, but the globalists are blocking all the new clean systems
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  and they decided not to build a better world.
[17:20.000 --> 17:21.000]  That's hard to do.
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  It's easier just to help screw everything up
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  so at least you're in control of it.
[17:25.000 --> 17:30.000]  They're directing all the sins and all the degeneracies
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  and all the corruptions and all the mental illnesses
[17:33.000 --> 17:39.000]  into directed human streams of evil
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  like you fire fire hoses at mountain sides
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.000]  to then pan for gold or other extractions,
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  other aggregates, other alluvials that you want.
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  And they're just using the harnessed evil
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  of the worldwide beast system.
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  All the corruption, all the wickedness
[17:57.000 --> 18:01.000]  focused like a laser beam, like a particle beam
[18:01.000 --> 18:08.000]  against humanity.
[18:08.000 --> 18:09.000]  And that's right.
[18:09.000 --> 18:14.000]  They've now released new NSA documents admitting
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.000]  that of course Steve Jobs and Apple and Al Gore
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  were with the NSA from the beginning.
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  And of course they called their users zombies.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  I mean, what do you think the head of Facebook
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  calls his users dumb efforts?
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.000]  He goes, our users trust us in the meeting
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  and he said they're all a bunch of dumb efforts
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  and then started laughing.
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  And that's who these people are, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:36.000 --> 18:47.000]  I got taken to a party by a rock star during a private party.
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.000]  They had the whole floor area of a hotel
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.000]  and there were high level executives there.
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  And I'm not going to say anything about it
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  because I was told obviously, yeah, I know you're seeing this.
[18:59.000 --> 19:03.000]  I took you to see it, but don't say anything about specifically who they were.
[19:03.000 --> 19:04.000]  So let's do it vague.
[19:04.000 --> 19:09.000]  And they all knew who I was and they were all just animated,
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.000]  hopping around on power trips,
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.000]  literally just laughing at everyone.
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  Even laughing at the people that were there.
[19:19.000 --> 19:23.000]  I mean, it is just, these people are horrible.
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  But I'm going to tell you something, folks.
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  You're the folks who will stand next to a burning car.
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.000]  I'm talking to mainstream people.
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  You're the people that think I'm a weirdo
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  because I'm upset and my listeners are upset.
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.000]  Now, it's 2014.
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  We've got huge news on 40,000 new laws,
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  pedophilia being promoted in the U.S. and Italy,
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  transgender kindergartners allowed to pick bathrooms.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  That's so they can sexualize the kids.
[19:47.000 --> 19:48.000]  That's coming up.
[19:48.000 --> 19:49.000]  That's on drudgerport.com.
[19:49.000 --> 19:53.000]  Also on drudgerport.com, the top story in the middle column,
[19:53.000 --> 19:59.000]  Nuke Fear, feds order 14 million dosages of potassium iodide.
[19:59.000 --> 20:02.000]  And we're going to tell you what that's about.
[20:02.000 --> 20:03.000]  Some important information.
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk
[20:05.000 --> 20:08.000]  and his team of patriots over at MyPatriots Supply.
[20:08.000 --> 20:11.000]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment
[20:11.000 --> 20:13.000]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[20:13.000 --> 20:16.000]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[20:16.000 --> 20:21.000]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[20:21.000 --> 20:25.000]  MyPatriots Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[20:25.000 --> 20:30.000]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  American men and women.
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.000]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  from MyPatriots Supply.
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  Go to MyPatriotsupply.com.

[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  That's 800-593-6273.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  Which side are you on?
[24:26.000 --> 24:37.000]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[24:37.000 --> 24:44.000]  Now coming up for 40 minutes in the third hour, we're going to look at the state of nuclear reactors
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.000]  here in the U.S. but also in Europe, Japan, U-Namen, the latest developments on Fukushima
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.000]  where they are trying to clean up the site and it's actually generating more radiation.
[24:53.000 --> 24:59.000]  But there's an article up on DrudgeReport.com.
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.000]  Right in the middle column, top story in the middle column,
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.000]  Nucphere feds order 14 million dosages of potassium iodide.
[25:10.000 --> 25:16.000]  And if you actually read it, they ordered 14 million packages of it, of the IOSAT.
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.000]  We sell it at 4store.com.
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  And in emergencies, you know, it's better than nothing.
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  Nace and I, from all my experts, is the way to go.
[25:25.000 --> 25:30.000]  But they've ordered 14 million of these and they're not saying why,
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  but we're going to be talking about that in more detail.
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.000]  But Watson, in his article, goes over the history.
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.000]  The funny thing is, Gucciardi was already writing an article about this this morning
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  without even talking to Watson.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  It shows how we're on the same page.
[25:44.000 --> 25:51.000]  The fed biz site about FEMA camps, where they're hiring guards for reeducation centers,
[25:51.000 --> 25:56.000]  who do not have processed social security numbers and daycare centers in the FEMA camps
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  where they keep your kids.
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.000]  I mean, it's all there.
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  The billions of bullets, the drones, all the stuff that didn't even classify.
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.000]  Millions of dollars for paper targets of children where they train to shoot kids.
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  We find it all right here.
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  Do you imagine what's classified?
[26:11.000 --> 26:14.000]  We just have MSNBC come out and go, there's no FEMA camp.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  There's no internment camp.
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  There's no army training manuals for reeducation centers,
[26:21.000 --> 26:26.000]  even though we can find it all at the fedbizops.gov.
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  Because they're supposed to have free open bidding process.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  The truth is, most of it's totally rigged,
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  but at least that part of the law makes it where you can see what the public bids are.
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.000]  Including on classified projects, they'll just have the declassified part, but just off that,
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.000]  we can then go ferret around and find stuff out.
[26:45.000 --> 26:54.000]  That's how we already survived in the last year while we couldn't buy AK-47, AMO 7.62, what, 3.9?
[26:54.000 --> 27:01.000]  All of it was they were buying up all the other calibers so that we couldn't get them.
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  Tens of millions of AK-47s, the semi-autos.
[27:06.000 --> 27:13.000]  I mean, per order, just millions and millions of rounds of every caliber you can imagine,
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  every strange caliber that no one even uses.
[27:15.000 --> 27:20.000]  They're just putting in huge warehouses to drive up prices and to make it unavailable.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  They've shut down all the lead smelters in the U.S.
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  The last one's shut down this week.
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  It shuts down, I guess today, but it closed last week,
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  but officially is shut today under law.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  It's just total shutdown of America.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  Total shutdown of anything they don't want you to have access to.
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  So we're going to be talking about that with Anthony Gucciardi,
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  but the story is up on infowars.com.
[27:41.000 --> 27:49.000]  It's linked in red, and it's the second story there in the featured news area.
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.000]  Now the third story there in the featured news story.
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  Some of the other news we're going to be breaking down.
[27:55.000 --> 27:59.000]  How to address growing poverty, more confiscation by government.
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  Kurt Nemo's article, video.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  Woman stands by burning car, example of sheep-like zombie population.
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.000]  Another one, duping the left, New York mayor, is a total minion of the Clintons.
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.000]  And that's well known, but it's okay because he's married to a black lady,
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  so everything he must do is all right.
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  I mean, it just never ends.
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  We've also got articles up there about the media trying to cover up racial attacks
[28:22.000 --> 28:26.000]  against whites that are really intensifying men and women in public.
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  And the police will not respond, just like when they had groups of, quote,
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  minority men raping women in mass over and over again the last 20 years in New York.
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.000]  And then finally on helicopter video of 100, 200 men just raping women.
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.000]  The police stand down because political correctness is king.
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  And as long as it's a white devil getting raped by a couple hundred men
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  and getting their job broke while their husband gets beat to death,
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  that's a good thing.
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  You understand that?
[28:54.000 --> 28:59.000]  That has to be allowed because only whites could ever do anything racial and bad.
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.000]  You understand that?
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  That's important for everybody to know, and I agree with that.
[29:02.000 --> 29:07.000]  I think that if 200 Puerto Rican men want to rape a woman and kill her,
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  that's all right if she's white.
[29:09.000 --> 29:13.000]  I think if black people want to target white folks in a mall and nobody comes to their aid
[29:13.000 --> 29:19.000]  and they break bones and break legs and break ribs and knock teeth out
[29:19.000 --> 29:22.000]  and the police stand down, I think that's what should happen.
[29:22.000 --> 29:26.000]  I think the black people should go to the malls with ice picks.
[29:26.000 --> 29:27.000]  That makes sarcastic.
[29:27.000 --> 29:28.000]  I better not say that.
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  It'll actually be, Alex said do it.
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  Now this is sick, ladies and gentlemen.
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.000]  This is sick.
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.000]  And it's just like the Klan going out and finding some black guy dragging him to death.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  But you'll never hear a word about it.
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  Now it's a sacrament.
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  Good job MSNBC.
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  You really are doing a great job destroying our culture.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  We'll be right back.
[30:18.000 --> 30:23.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[30:23.000 --> 30:30.000]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.

[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[30:37.000 --> 30:39.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[30:39.000 --> 30:44.000]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[30:48.000 --> 30:52.000]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[30:58.000 --> 31:00.000]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[31:00.000 --> 31:07.000]  In the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine.
[31:07.000 --> 31:11.000]  A practice now banned in nations around the world.
[31:11.000 --> 31:13.000]  Guess what else is in a halogen family?
[31:13.000 --> 31:16.000]  Fluoride. Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[31:16.000 --> 31:22.000]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[31:22.000 --> 31:27.000]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record.
[31:27.000 --> 31:33.000]  Reports documented a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[31:33.000 --> 31:36.000]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[31:36.000 --> 31:42.000]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[31:42.000 --> 31:48.000]  You will find survival shield nascent iodine exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[31:48.000 --> 31:53.000]  Infowars life survival shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[31:53.000 --> 32:00.000]  I take it every day. That's infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[32:00.000 --> 32:03.000]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[32:03.000 --> 32:08.000]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[32:08.000 --> 32:15.000]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[32:15.000 --> 32:21.000]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.
[32:21.000 --> 32:25.000]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[32:25.000 --> 32:30.000]  You've got the life straw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[32:30.000 --> 32:35.000]  The K-Tor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[32:35.000 --> 32:39.000]  Strategic relocation third edition by Joel Scousum.
[32:39.000 --> 32:41.000]  When disaster strikes by Matthew Stein.
[32:41.000 --> 32:46.000]  TheraSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[32:46.000 --> 32:49.000]  Hand crank shortwave AMFM radios.
[32:49.000 --> 32:53.000]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at infowarshop.com.
[32:53.000 --> 32:56.000]  And your purchase makes our info war possible.
[32:56.000 --> 33:11.000]  We're getting prepared. Are you infowarshop.com?
[33:11.000 --> 33:17.000]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[33:17.000 --> 33:23.000]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[33:23.000 --> 33:27.000]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[33:27.000 --> 33:31.000]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[33:31.000 --> 33:34.000]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[33:34.000 --> 33:36.000]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[33:36.000 --> 33:41.000]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days, rolling through your neighborhood.
[33:41.000 --> 33:46.000]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.000]  The guns will be taken. No one will be able to be armed. We will take all weapons.
[33:49.000 --> 33:52.000]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.000]  It has really brainwashed people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[33:56.000 --> 34:00.000]  Enough. Enough. Enough. Enough.
[34:00.000 --> 34:04.000]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.000]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[34:08.000 --> 34:16.000]  And as KSLA News 12 Jeff Beall discovered, the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem. Us.
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.000]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents,
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.000]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.000]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.
[34:29.000 --> 34:36.000]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[34:36.000 --> 34:41.000]  Black Hawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[34:41.000 --> 34:53.000]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[34:53.000 --> 34:59.000]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[34:59.000 --> 35:12.000]  I am in my apartment, sir. I am inside. I have two words for you. Predator drones. You will never see it coming.
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.000]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras, parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.000]  hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[35:24.000 --> 35:29.000]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[35:29.000 --> 35:38.000]  We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down if you want to commentate on it.
[35:38.000 --> 35:48.000]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[35:48.000 --> 35:55.000]  The Revolution is at my door. To the start, to the end.
[35:55.000 --> 36:02.000]  There's no way that we have to live without the hate never in their heart.
[36:02.000 --> 36:08.000]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[36:14.000 --> 36:23.000]  And folks, it is Thursday the ninth day, Thursday the ninth day of January 2014.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  And you heard rebroadcast for the first 30 minutes. I apologize for that.
[36:27.000 --> 36:34.000]  That happened. I'll just be honest with the audience out there because I was just too angry and upset to even go on air.
[36:34.000 --> 36:40.000]  By a combination of things, it wasn't just bearing my uncle yesterday that I was very close to.
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.000]  No, this has happened to me before where I just look at all the news and what's happening.
[36:45.000 --> 36:53.000]  And then my inability to fight the New World Order at a level that's effective, it's just incredibly frustrating.
[36:53.000 --> 37:00.000]  That's why people call in saying you're doing a great job. You might as well be stabbing me with flaming hot ice picks.
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  Because, I mean, this is a real war, ladies and gentlemen.
[37:04.000 --> 37:12.000]  And this is a real enemy we face. And it's very painful to see humanity in such bad situation and getting worse by the minute.
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.000]  And evil just absolutely running wild.
[37:15.000 --> 37:20.000]  And then to know that we're in the thick of a battle here.
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  And quite frankly, I'm not doing that good of a job.
[37:24.000 --> 37:31.000]  And I feel guilty that I don't do a good job. And you know, whether that's right or wrong, that's how I feel.
[37:31.000 --> 37:38.000]  But it's basically like being in the middle of a battle with piles of dead bodies, men, women and children, you name it.
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.000]  And I'm up here trying to fight these people as hard as I can and folks are telling me what a great job I'm doing.
[37:44.000 --> 37:56.000]  Listen, the enemy is coming down on us on every level. And we've got to explain to people where we are in the world,
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.000]  why we're here and where we're going and who's behind this.
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.000]  We've got to lay out the players. We've got to lay out the facts.
[38:04.000 --> 38:11.000]  We've got to communicate and report to our friends and family what's happening.
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.000]  Who the enemy is, historically what's unfolding and the fact that we can beat them.
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  I mean, here's the issue.
[38:17.000 --> 38:32.000]  I've seen our reportage up on infowars.com and prismplotted.com and drugreport.com carrying at the 1400% increase in radiation hotspots found on San Francisco beaches.
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.000]  And then I see the comments in there and on YouTube saying, well, why is this new? Why is this important?
[38:37.000 --> 38:47.000]  And that's a minority of people, but it shows the mindset of radiation wave hitting the United States. That's why we're out in California and on the West Coast.
[38:47.000 --> 38:56.000]  That's why I sent reporters with Geiger counters to confirm what the health department confirmed increased radiation.
[38:56.000 --> 39:08.000]  So we're there to point out the radiation is increasing from Fukushima clearly and other sources and it's in the seafood and it's all over the place.
[39:08.000 --> 39:23.000]  And then we're also there to point out that the dominant so-called establishment media isn't even a media at all and is a state run media and that we the real media are going to overthrow their tyranny with the truth.
[39:23.000 --> 39:31.000]  And this indicts the establishment that they're not covering what's going on out there.
[39:31.000 --> 39:43.000]  This indicts the power structure that they covered up Fukushima and they covered up what happened there on record.
[39:43.000 --> 39:54.000]  Three years later, it's all known to be a giant lie and that people are dying all over Japan from it. And there's a huge cover up going on.
[39:54.000 --> 40:12.000]  And now radiation from the air, sea and land getting carried across the ocean, floating in on debris, swimming in inside marine wildlife is coming across and hitting the West Coast at increasing levels.
[40:12.000 --> 40:18.000]  The major university studies are out. Fox News has covered it. CNN has covered it, but they've just mentioned it.
[40:18.000 --> 40:26.000]  Well, increased radiation waves are now going to be arriving in the first four months of 2014. That was reported back in November.
[40:26.000 --> 40:34.000]  But we don't know if that's going to be harmful when obviously it is harmful.
[40:34.000 --> 40:47.000]  These are the same people that have covered up Agent Orange and GMO and DU and so many other issues like the World Trade Center dust.
[40:47.000 --> 40:55.000]  And all I'm trying to do is expose the government cover up that is taking place. And I am genuinely upset about this.
[40:55.000 --> 41:08.000]  I am genuinely angry about it. But it's beyond anger. It is a gripping consciousness of awareness.
[41:08.000 --> 41:16.000]  And I see how childlike the general public is and how easily duped and tricked and manipulated by the establishment.
[41:16.000 --> 41:26.000]  And it makes me sick. I mean, I can't look at Ariana Huffington's face that just popped up on info wars dot com.
[41:26.000 --> 41:35.000]  Ariana Huffington has now come out and is trying to organize the globalist together to create quote alternative new media to push their establishment bills and disinformation.
[41:35.000 --> 41:48.000]  And I look at that demonic narcissist enjoying her fascism feeding on the public. And it makes me begin to real with not even hatred or anger, but with absolute disgust.
[41:48.000 --> 41:57.000]  I don't want to focus on her. I don't want to look at her. I don't want to know about her. I don't want to study all her lies and fraud and evil and deceit and manipulation.
[41:57.000 --> 42:08.000]  But I have to to defeat these people. And I'm sick of them. And I just wish you knew what black hearted enemies they are of you and your family and how sworn to evil they are.
[42:08.000 --> 42:18.000]  Absolutely dedicated to your enslavement. Absolutely in rage with hate for anything good. I mean, these people are abomination desolations.
[42:18.000 --> 42:35.000]  These people are actual enemies of all that is good. And that's the bottom line. And so for me, this isn't some 10 minutes of hate like 1984, where I just hate some foreign enemy, the Russians or the Chinese.
[42:35.000 --> 42:41.000]  And then meanwhile, the enemies right here taking over our lives.
[42:41.000 --> 42:50.000]  I have to look at the real enemy and study them every day. And I'm not whining here on air. I'm telling you why I literally couldn't go on air and was going to leave.
[42:50.000 --> 43:05.000]  And then just said, I can't quit. There's too much news. I got to go cover it. But then what is the point of even being here? Because I'm just going to start complaining about everything.
[43:05.000 --> 43:15.000]  Oh, it's just painful to see our entire civilization turned over to evil.
[43:15.000 --> 43:29.000]  And whereas the globalists see uninformed childlike arrested development populations, and they see victims, they see prey to be fed upon.
[43:29.000 --> 43:44.000]  They see these these these minions. And it is fundamentally upsetting to me because their fall is my fall and my children's fall and the fall of our civilization and the fall of everything that's good.
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.000]  And that's what's happening scientifically.
[43:48.000 --> 44:06.000]  You know, I'm aware of the cell phones and the tracking and the GMO and the culture of evil and the world and the flesh. I can't even resist it.
[44:06.000 --> 44:18.000]  I can't look at Joe Biden or Obama. I can't look at Boehner. I can't look at Chris Christie.
[44:18.000 --> 44:33.000]  I can't look at the average Hollywood people all swollen and and and petty and that everyone worshipping him. I mean, it is it is just it is so unbelievable.
[44:33.000 --> 44:43.000]  And if people were just aware of this, we could turn the tide very, very quickly. That's what makes me so angry. So enough of my complaining.
[44:43.000 --> 44:49.000]  There is a lot of important news and information to go over here today.
[44:49.000 --> 45:04.000]  Here's some of the news up on info wars.com. White House says record low temperatures caused by global warming increased radiation found near Redwood Forest.
[45:04.000 --> 45:21.000]  Ariana Huffington courts global elite in effort to undermine alternative media by Curt Nimmo. New radioactive hotspots found on California Beach with video racist storm over video black toddler spouting obscenities.
[45:21.000 --> 45:32.000]  Pentagon agency admits it began stockpiling potassium iodide due to Fukushima. At least the Pentagon is telling the truth about their purchases, not the other 14 million.
[45:32.000 --> 45:41.000]  Ford executive. We know everyone who breaks the law. Thanks to our GPS in your car. Yeah, all the new cars Ford Chevy Toyota.
[45:41.000 --> 45:47.000]  They all have GPS and tracker boxes in them that you paid for in the cost, even though you don't know they're in there.
[45:47.000 --> 45:56.000]  And they're preparing to now feed all that data to the police and the insurance companies. And it's beyond 1984.
[45:56.000 --> 46:03.000]  And I warned people about this a decade ago and they were like, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist, even though I had all the government documents that were public.
[46:03.000 --> 46:11.000]  I mean, again, that's what's so frustrating about all this is this stuff is all right out in the open that they put poison in the water and say it's to brain damage us and give us cancer.
[46:11.000 --> 46:20.000]  They should all be strung up. But it's the establishment. So it's like, oh, it's for your teeth.
[46:20.000 --> 46:30.000]  It's so frustrating. Meanwhile, we're all hearing about the New Jersey governor who had his gangster staff close a bridge because people wouldn't give him a deal.
[46:30.000 --> 46:44.000]  He wanted, of course, that's how government works. Whenever they were going to have a railway and toll road referendums in the last, I don't know, 15 years here in Austin over and over again, they always randomly the day of the event shut down lanes on 35 and lanes on
[46:44.000 --> 46:54.000]  Congress and lanes on South Lamar. And I talked to city people with the police and they said, no, we're just told to do this and we think it's to shut the roads down because we're not even doing any construction.
[46:54.000 --> 47:11.000]  Yeah, no kidding. That's how gangster government works. That's what Cloward and Piven is. They shut down all your life, your business with red tape and then they can swim free. They're free as a lark to fly through the sky.
[47:11.000 --> 47:20.000]  What's the aviators prayer? You guys print that up for me. Thanks. They can do whatever they want.
[47:20.000 --> 47:34.000]  It's your bound down. You're chained down to these criminals. I mean, look at Christie, open borders, anti-gun, globalist. He cuts some government funding to give bankers bailouts and that was called conservative.
[47:34.000 --> 47:44.000]  Now the Chamber of Commerce is declaring this will be the year of immigration reform. That's getting rid of national sovereignty, unlimited immigration to drive down wages and have a voting block.
[47:44.000 --> 47:52.000]  Rush Limbaugh is correct when he says that GOP leaders will cave into big business.
[47:52.000 --> 48:06.000]  Canner and Bonner say they quote want reform, drafting a set of immigration principles, financial economic blow for American workers. Yeah, no kidding. That's in the LA Times.
[48:06.000 --> 48:12.000]  And by the way, that's not going to end up helping the people in Mexico or 80% of the immigrants.
[48:12.000 --> 48:23.000]  It's going to make sure we're all like Mexico totally collapsed and the globalists are off on their 40,000 acre ranches and armed compounds with helicopter pads.
[48:23.000 --> 48:31.000]  And once they break us and make us poor like Mexico, there's almost no way to ever get out of it. And we're almost there.
[48:31.000 --> 48:41.000]  We're almost there. They've almost got us there. And we've got a chance to turn things around. That's what's so frustrating is that we have a chance to turn things around.
[48:41.000 --> 48:47.000]  But we've got to have a fighting spirit. We've got to get the focus and realize what's happening.
[48:47.000 --> 48:52.000]  You know, why are we sending reporters to the West Coast?
[48:52.000 --> 49:03.000]  Well, because it's been confirmed by alternative media and then picked up by a few local newspapers that they've got 500 to 1400 times increased radiation levels than what it previously was.
[49:03.000 --> 49:12.000]  And there's all different forms of radioactive stuff, natural being found at higher levels, unnatural. It's in the seafood. What's going on?
[49:12.000 --> 49:24.000]  People should be aware of all this radiation. We should investigate it. We should ask why the media is not covering it to force them to cover it, but to also discredit them for the fact that they're basically state run media.
[49:24.000 --> 49:28.000]  That's why we have reporters out in California.
[49:28.000 --> 49:33.000]  That's why we're breaking all of this information down.
[49:33.000 --> 49:43.000]  I'm here on air to tell you GMO has traits stacked into it that kill insects that eat it. And they tell you that's safe to eat.
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  That has pesticides and herbicides engineered into it.
[49:47.000 --> 49:58.000]  And then in all the rodent, guinea pig, rats, mice studies, it ends up absolutely devastating the first generation, decimating the second and annihilating the third.
[49:58.000 --> 50:04.000]  Third generation mammal studies across the board because it's designed like this on purpose.
[50:04.000 --> 50:11.000]  You get almost complete infertility, tumors, hair growing out of the mouth, genitals on top of the head.
[50:11.000 --> 50:17.000]  Just total toxic, avenger level mutations.
[50:17.000 --> 50:25.000]  After birth, it's not even mutations in utero. They're mutating like a science fiction movie as they grow up.
[50:25.000 --> 50:32.000]  And maybe you like having your brain on the outside of your head. Maybe you like having your genitals hanging underneath your chin like you're a turkey.
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  But the whole point is that this is real.
[50:35.000 --> 50:42.000]  Okay, I'm not putting a bad face on it. We're in a science fiction nightmare situation that counts on you not being aware of it, a literal matrix.
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  And we need to get fired up, get angry, get focused. And that's why I'm here.
[50:46.000 --> 50:53.000]  But I just am disgusted by the vampires that are running this. All of them. They all know exactly what they're doing.
[50:53.000 --> 51:00.000]  These people want to murder you and your family and take their time doing it. Now what are we going to do about it?

[54:21.000 --> 54:50.000]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen. Later today, our reporters who are out in California are going to be visiting the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant.
[54:50.000 --> 54:55.000]  To check and see if it has increased radiation levels that aren't being reported.
[54:55.000 --> 55:08.000]  That's why you can have 91% of US reactors leaking according to the United Nations studies that came out in the last two years is because the media will not report on increased radiation now.
[55:08.000 --> 55:14.000]  They are good, little lap dogs, and they do what they're told when they're told.
[55:14.000 --> 55:24.000]  In fact, our media wouldn't even say that melamine was bad when the Chinese were executing corporate officials for allowing melamine into their formula.
[55:24.000 --> 55:32.000]  Over here, they had the FDA come out and say melamine in low levels isn't bad for you, even though it causes kidney failure.
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  So what? We want to put little kids on dialysis and make more money.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  I mean, big deal.
[55:37.000 --> 55:47.000]  So the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a 63MWE boiling water reactor owned by Pacific Gas and Electric Company and probably about 130 today or so.
[55:47.000 --> 55:58.000]  They're going to be on the show live to give us a report that's 130 central from Humboldt and across the bay on the beach across the bay.
[55:58.000 --> 56:06.000]  So we're just drawing attention to increased radiation levels out there showing that the government and the media will not tell you what's going on.
[56:06.000 --> 56:32.000]  We were mainly going out there because, again, they reported in November, Fox News, Associated Press on major university studies working with NOAA and other international groups on Pacific buoys and readings that major debris fields and new waves of radiation from the ongoing meltdowns at Fukushima
[56:32.000 --> 56:38.000]  and the water being pumped over to keep it cool that goes into the Pacific Ocean will be hitting in January of 2014.
[56:38.000 --> 56:48.000]  Well, now it's January 2014 and the reports came up of increased radiation levels on the west coast.
[56:48.000 --> 56:57.000]  And so when the local health department confirmed it, but put it is not a big deal, we decided to send our reporters out there to check and see if they found the same thing.
[56:57.000 --> 57:04.000]  They found the same levels or higher because there's different people that have done tests.
[57:04.000 --> 57:09.000]  They found 1000 plus times what they say is a normal level.
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.000]  Other groups have found 1400 times the government found 500 times.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  The issue is this needs to be investigated.
[57:16.000 --> 57:19.000]  This needs to be looked at.
[57:19.000 --> 57:31.000]  And that's the issue that we are here covering on air today.
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.000]  And I want to open the phones up on the news.
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.000]  Obama donor to head IRS Tea Party targeting investigation.
[57:39.000 --> 57:47.000]  Yeah, why don't you have John Gotti head up the investigation of the Gambino crime syndicate.
[57:47.000 --> 57:53.000]  And then we're going to look at how they want to get rid of the borders entirely and just completely break the nation once and for all.
[57:53.000 --> 57:58.000]  And we can talk about the whole Chris Christie diversion if you want.
[57:58.000 --> 58:06.000]  I mean, I think it's important it should be reported on it shows the arrogance and the hubris, but in the final equation compared to all the other arrogance, it's nothing.
[58:06.000 --> 58:16.000]  But it's the kind of thing can capture the public's attention that they would shut down multiple lanes of a key bridge to punish a another government and a population.
[58:16.000 --> 58:20.000]  And for not doing what they want.
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.000]  I mean, Chris Christie is a disgusting gangster pig.
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.000]  I don't say he's a pig because he's job of the huts brother.
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  I say that because the guy is a piece of trash.
[58:31.000 --> 58:37.000]  And that's what the Republican blue blood Carl Rove leadership wants to give America to run against Hillary.
[58:37.000 --> 58:41.000]  So she sends up being president.

[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  800-259-9231 is the toll free number to join us today here on air.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  If you just tuned in, we are live on this Thursday, ninth day of January, 2014.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  And I wasn't trying to be overtly, overly dark last hour.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  That's just what comes out when you study what the establishment's doing, who they are.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  They have been given over to corruption for so long that only people that enjoy evil could do the things they're doing.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  Just watching them has deranged me to a certain extent.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  I mean, I'll be honest with you.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  Just, just, just sitting here watching what they do, watching what they engage in, seeing the different things that they do has absolutely, I think the word scarred my mind.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  And I don't get mad at people that are in denial because I realize it's too scary for them to admit to themselves.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  And that's the secret that evil has always been able to get over on the individual and groups is that we just can't imagine it's really that bad.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  And it's almost like rude or intrusive to talk about the bad things that are going on.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  So let's just paper it over, let's just deny it.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  And then that's what allows the evil to grow and grow and grow like a giant wall of slime until the dam breaks and then the whole civilization implodes.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  And that's the issue I wanted to get into with you today and cover the news is that we've already seen a collapse of morals.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  We're seeing a collapse in the value of the dollar.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  We're seeing depressionary type things happening in many regions of the country in the world.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  We're seeing the papering over of the facade wearing thin and people are really starting to get the fact that we've been betrayed.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  But what do you think is going to happen when the next level of the collapse comes into play?
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  I mean, the government is gearing up for urban warfare, domestic roundups, FEMA camps, financial collapse, armoring all their facilities, social security facilities.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  All the places where people will be coming wanting money.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  And they wouldn't be doing that if there wasn't a plan just look at them the third world over and over again to implode everything for six months or a year.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  And use the ensuing social unrest as the pretext to bring in stabilization forces, which I will want even if they stage the implosion and the social unrest.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  I'm not going to want people to burn down cities. I'm not going to want society to break down.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  And so we will welcome the troops and then they'll be seen as heroes, but then they'll never leave.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  And then we fully converted over to the new civilization, which is a devolving, imploding tyranny of a civilizational development.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  I mean, what do you call a scientific application of tyranny through a technocracy where you consolidate the resources and build hyper technological centralized reservation towers.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  While the rest of the civilization is poisoned culturally, physically, spiritually and denigrated and brought down.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  I guess you call that neo feudalism or hyper neo technocratic feudalism. I guess it'll be the term that that I would have to use.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  And I'm sitting here watching them build it. Their blueprints are public.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  They're building the giant dehumanization grid. You can already see that they fed our legs into it.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  Now it's chopping us up towards the hips and I'm desperately trying to pull myself and my family out of it and I don't have the strength.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare? Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism and every other major disease?
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design. We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information. I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born. MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men and women.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach, and that's why I stock my pantry with high quality storeable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at InfowarsLife.com. This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed. Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee. Available at infowarslife.com.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're into the second hour on this live Thursday, 9th to day of January.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  9th to day of January, 2014. Transmission, we're going to open the phones up on any issue you wish to discuss.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us. You can read our breaking reports on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  We've sent our great reporters and film teams out to California, and they found thousand times increased radiation in the beach areas outside San Francisco.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  We have maps of the beaches and GPS coordinates and all of that up on Infowars.com in the articles on those subjects.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  We've gone to the Golden Gate Bridge and found only slightly increased radiation levels. They've now been at the Humboldt nuclear power station and have not found increased radiation levels.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  I'm thinking about some of the other places I'm going to send them in the Bay Area before we then send them on up the coastline to check other areas of the west coast. Then we're going to send them back down to the southern area of California after they go up to Seattle.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  The reason we're out there is major university studies, Fox News and others covered it. In fact, I have those articles right here. We'll actually put those back up on screen for folks.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  The reason we're there is for the stories that came out back in November, wave of radiation from Fukushima will be 10 times bigger than all of the radiation from nuclear tests combined.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  We then go through the other reports that Fox News reported back in November that they were set coming up in the first four months of this year to have increased radiation levels from Fukushima hitting the west coast of the United States.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  That's why we're there, breaking that down and giving people numbers. There's Anthony Gucciardi's article, government media cover up Fukushima radiation, wave hitting the US, a radiation level spike, and mutated wildlife washes ashore.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  Government and media promote delusion, saying that it might be plastic utensils that put off the radioactive release.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  In fact, I think it's important we go back to that Fox News article from November for folks that radioactive wave to reach US in New Year and they asked, is it safe?
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  Well, we can't know that because there's not any real debate scientifically going on. There's not any real media coverage going on.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  You would think that that's something that would be covered. There's the headline. Is it safe radioactive Japanese wave nears the US?
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  And then it goes over the government and university studies saying that it's set to hit in early 2014. Well, we're there and the health department is confirming in San Francisco that the level has gone up.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  Fukushima locals have also been talking about the fact that they're having health problems as well, but their media continues and the government to a great extent to whitewash that.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  So that's why we're covering that. There's a lot of other news breaking and unfolding on those subjects at the same time.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  Here is some of the articles that are up on info wars dot com.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  White House says record low temperatures caused by global warming.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  I'm going to be getting into that report. John Planetary regime Holdren, that's the guy that says put poison in the water in his own book, Eco Science, insults our intelligence with more quack science.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  Increase radiation found near Redwood Forest. We have that report.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  Ariana Huffington again courts the global elite in effort to undermine alternative media. They're creating new fake synthetic astroturf alternative media with Bill Gates and others.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  Also, a new radioactive hotspots found on the California beach.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  Racist storm over video of black toddler spouting obscenities. We obviously can't play that.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  But the video is up on info wars dot com. Depending on agency admits it's begun stockpiling potassium iodide due to Fukushima.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  Ford exec says we know everything and that everyone who breaks the law thanks to our GPS in your car.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  I mean, this is just total criminality where they're all in your face bragging about how they spy on you.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  And if you're waiting for an economic collapse, just look at what is happening to Europe.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  We're going to be breaking all that down today after I take some of your phone calls here.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  Some of the news that is also out there at places like drugs report dot com.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  There's an outbreak of nightmare bacteria in Illinois. Sturs worry. Yeah, that's the kind of stuff that probably killed my uncle.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  Borrowers hit social media hurdles as the social media spreads information.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  There's an Olympic security alert in southern Russia. Security alert in southern Russia as bodies found in bomb rigged cars.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  And that looks like the cars didn't get remote controlled their destination on time.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  The old trick in the book is to drive a car, park it, put a dead body in it, and then detonate it and say a suicide bomber did it.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  Then you can blame it on the patsies. That's usually a false flag sign to see something like that.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  All right, continuing here with the news. First North American death from bird flu.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  Again, we already mentioned this, but it's just incredible person heading up IRS investigation, an Obama donor.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  Just total open criminality in your face. Just normalizing it.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  Colorado pot smokers fight for right to fly with marijuana.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  Resident introduces weed and food pairing menu, hash oil explosion. Mames kills, destroys homes.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  You know, here's my deal. You have a right to be a pothead and you have a right to smoke pot.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  I don't think you should be put in jail. I'm against the drug war and I always have been before it was cool.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  But there's also people that abuse it and who it's their whole world and all they care about is marijuana and no other liberties, no other freedoms.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  And that's why George Soros is promoting marijuana legalization is because he thinks it's going to pacify the public.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  But what they're doing is they're making it legal, but also illegal where they could still throw you in jail when they feel like it.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  As the fake drug war just rolls on.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  But it is very, very, very, very frustrating to see all of this unfolding.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  The good news is we're in the fight. People are beginning to wake up and we can turn the tide against this.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  But people have to really understand there is a conscious criminal attempt to just normalize all this corruption, to just flaunt all of this garbage in everyone's face.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  California, as you know, is one of the most bankrupt states in the United States after Michigan and Illinois.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  And Governor Jerry Brown sent proposed billions more in new spending.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  Amazing.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  Let's go ahead and let's take some phone calls here.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  Let's talk to Scott in Michigan. Scott, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  Yeah, Alex. First, I'd like to definitely tell you I understand your frustration.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  Most people say they've had it up to here and they put their hand below their chair.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  They say they had it up to F in here and they put their hand up to their forehead.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  My arm isn't long enough anymore, man. I'm right there with you.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  So what do we do about it? I say we get aggressive with the globalist. We just expose them and call them out as crooks.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  Yep, and that's exactly what my second part is. I need to break a couple of radio rules and give my name and phone number, but I swear.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  I'm not going to let you do that, man, because if I let you, then everybody will do it and people will give out fake numbers.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  It's not that I don't think you're a real person. If I let you, then everybody will start doing it, and then somebody will say my name's John Johnson,
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  and then he'll give out his ex-wife's phone number to harass her, and his name's not really John Johnson. You understand?
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  Yep, yep, fully understand. Can you give me, put me on hold and take my number and have me maybe come back as a guest for a short segment?
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  That way I can do the same thing over a segment.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  I can't really screen calls and do this administrative secretary stuff on air, bro. I mean, I just, I need a vacation, quite frankly.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  Yeah, thank you for the call. We don't really screen your calls, so it makes for really cool calls because neat people can get in who have a lot of really interesting info,
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  but then they want me to diagnose their illness on air or help them with their kids that are being stolen on air, and again, it's that thing of being in a lifeboat that's sinking,
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  everyone trying to clamor on board, and you know, I just, it's not a radio rule. You can't call in and give your name and phone number out because we don't know who you are,
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  and there's a reason. I mean, it would basically be illegal, or let's just say this, I could be held civilly liable.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  There's been a lot of cases of this where people call up and give out fake phone numbers, or say there's somebody who they aren't, and I'm not saying you're saying that,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  and the people get mad at me when I let them do that, when, when, if you were in my position, you couldn't do that.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  So we'll go to break now and try to come back and take calls again, 800-259-9031.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  And you know, sometimes it's good for me to just say, here's the topic, we're going to talk about this because we tend to get good callers when we do that.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  I guess I ask for it when I say, calling about whatever you want, you know, if people have a political idea or something, they should put it on a website,
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  present the idea, and then say who they are, give their number that way, and then if your idea is interesting, people will end up contacting you.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  But I mean, there's nowhere on earth you can just call into a national radio show and say, you know, call me, contact me, I want to go get organized here.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  They do have some shows like that on local rural radio, where you can call and say, I got a 1992 John Deere tractor, good, good tires on it, and I'm willing to sell it for $5,000,
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  and people can write to me at P.O. Box, and then you can do it that way.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  Or I'm going to be down at the swap meet tomorrow, and you can come on down to that.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000]  This show is not based on that.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000]  Hi, folks. Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:09.000]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:17.000]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed, and the Charlottes willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding. They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men and women.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach, and that's why I stock MyPatriot with high quality, storable foods from MyPatriot Supply.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  By now, you may know that a Bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that's easily transferred from person to person over the Internet. No bank needed.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited, or closed. Plus, a large number of businesses and merchants already accept Bitcoins, and Bitcoins are easily exchanged for dollars, euros, and more.

[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  All the leaves are brown, leaves are brown, and the sky is gray.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  California Greens
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  California Greens. Well, the good news is we're not finding increased radiation levels everywhere.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  We didn't find them at the Goldigate Bridge. They were slightly elevated. We didn't find them at the Humboldt Nuclear Power Plant where you'd expect to find it.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  But we did find it in the Redwoods and different beach areas around San Francisco. So very, very interesting. And of course, the radioactive waves are continuing to come in.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  We're going to have reports at the bottom of the next hour from our crew on the ground as we attempt to see how bad the situation is.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  But the good news is it's not radioactive across the board. Most of this is probably natural radiation contamination out of fissures in the Earth.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  There's natural radon and other things down in there. But radon and other natural forms of radiation are increasing across North America like never before seen in the studies I was reading just a few days ago.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  Another question, why is this happening? And of course, there is some Fukushima radiation there, but nothing like it is in Japan itself.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  So this is a positive thing so far for a lot of folks out in California and on the rest of the West Coast. We're going to continue to track up the coast.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  But hopefully we find other areas that aren't contaminated as well. But let's go back to your phone calls now. Let's talk to Julio in Illinois. You're on the air.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  Good morning, Alex. Happy New Year to you. We're going through some crazy times, my friend. We really are.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  It's just so amazing, really, to see not only the elevated radiation levels out in the Pacific Northwest, but we're getting radiation levels here in the Midwest.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  I'd be sure to say we're getting radiation levels all throughout the country on unusual amounts of radiation levels. My friend, my buddy who helped me in genetically modified society out of St. Louis, Michael Janich, he helped put out a video where he tested the snow.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  He just put out a video yesterday. I think it was like 69.4 levels of radiation in the snow. He tested some salmon seafood patty, and there's radiation levels in that.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  And it's so interesting, Alex, you said your crew was out at a nuclear facility owned by PG&E Pacific Electric and Gas Company. And when I did my documentary last year, which I submitted for your contest, Genetically Modified Society, I was able to speak to people with knowledge from PG&E that they themselves are conducting
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  weather modification programs and geoengineering programs. I spoke to Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democrat out of Rhode Island, who constantly talks about, oh, we need to do something about climate change.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  Oh, we need to do something. It's our fault. He admitted to me that he knows and is aware of geoengineering programs taking place in the U.S.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  A member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Mark Levy, told me during a conference call that, yes, indeed, the president is aware of geoengineering programs, although he won't endorse it publicly because of the controversial nature that it involves.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  He will endorse it through a surrogate like the National Academy on Sciences, which just did a closed-door meeting conference in Irvine, California back in December. You know, the National Weather Service, the director lied to me through my face at the conference telling me, oh, there's no
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  weather modification programs going on. If there is, it's done by private corporations. When the government themselves, the Federal Aviation Administration, is permitting all geoengineering programs taking place in the skies, Alex.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  This is a huge cover-up going on. And, you know, we're only at the tip of a sphere in terms of exposing these geoengineering programs.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  Well, what you're saying is absolutely on target. And I've seen your documentary and I've done the research as well. And there's all this geoengineering going on. There's all this genetic manipulation going on.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  There's all this weather modification happening. All this manipulation by the shadow corporate government worldwide that is literally turning us all into guinea pigs.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  They had this long history of lethal testing. And as you said, we've had articles that have gone nationwide on infowars.com showing citizen activists with Geiger counters, showing very high levels of radioactive increases coming from the snow,
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  coming from areas in Kansas, Unanimate, Missouri, back when Fukushima first hit. They found high levels in the milk, the food, Unanimate. But it was just back of the newspaper.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  It was a very, very minor situation for the establishment media. But for us, it's a big deal because they have this history of covering up things that are devastating because they could care less about us.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:50.000]  And then it allows industry and governments to be so incredibly toxic and to get away with everything. It's lawlessness by the establishment. More calls coming up.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:11.000]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:23.000]  Guess what else is in the halogen family? Fluoride. Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here. In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record, reports documented, a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  Bottom line, iodine is important. Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:53.000]  You'll find survival shield nascent iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com. InfoWarsLife survival shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  The facts are in. The studies are legion. Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.000]  Simple, dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLife fluoride shield formulation,
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:39.000]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body,
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  but a whole host of toxic substances. Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:54.000]  I use fluoride shield every day. Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:01.000]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWars at the same time. That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  I'll tell you right now, folks. The reason we're in California is we know the radiation levels are increasing.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  We know that the University studies are showing that there is increased radiation coming in in new waves.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  Will you guys bring me that Fox News article that we printed earlier on that? Thank you.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  The one we had earlier that was from November? Okay, thank you. It's been added to that stack? Okay, fantastic.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  There it is. Yeah, that's out of salon Fukushima radiation set to hit US by 2014. Thank you.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  And then we'll go to some of the phone calls. But the issue is that's why we're there to draw attention to this and to see if that's really the case.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  And to try to ask why the media in California is not covering any of that. Thank you.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  That says, is it safe? Radioactive Japanese wave nears the United States.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  And then now we have this new article that just broke up on InfoWars.com by Anthony Gucciardi.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  Fukushima madness plant decontamination system shuts down amid failure.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  As the Fukushima nightmare continues under the wing of plant operator Tepco,
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  the blatant incompetence of the highly deceptive corporation is once again apparent following a complete shutdown of the plant's decontamination system.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  The very same system responsible for handling the mass amounts of radioactive water around Fukushima that Tepco originally promised would be entirely decontaminated by the end of 2014.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  And instead of fulfilling their promise to decontaminate the plant's radioactive water by the end of 2014,
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  Tepco now insists that it needs another entire year to finish the job and this system shut down certainly will not help in reducing that time.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  According to media sources and Tepco official statements, the failure of the advanced liquid processing system may take a long time to restart.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  What's worse, however, is that there is, this is not the first time the system has been shut down due to failure.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  And it's the same thing with vaccines. They call them safe and effective. They use that term.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  That's like saying cocaine is safe and effective or arsenic is safe and effective or jumping off a cliff without a parachute.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  Tower jumping is safe and effective. They're lying to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  And again, it's this delusional attitude they want to foist on people, but they're also themselves smoking their own dope.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  It's what I'm trying to say. And it's very, very, very, very frustrating.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  I'm going to carry, in Washington, carry her on the air. Go ahead.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  Hey, hey, I'm sorry to hear about your uncle and your cousin.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  Oh, no, no, thank you. Well, they've gone on to be with Lords. Thank you. What you calling about today, sir?
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  I got two comments that people don't know. You know that they put equivalent to a gag order in Japan.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  They're not talking about anything that's going over there. Ten-year prison sentence automatic.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  Yeah, they signed an executive order via the diet there, Congress, what, three weeks ago?
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  Yeah. And not only that, but do you know that China stopped all importation of all shellfish on the West Coast, including the last?
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  I did know that, yes.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  And I got one favor to ask you.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  Sir, can I plug my YouTube site?
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  Okay. It's called the Kerry Helms Boots.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  If they put that in there, and that'll take them to...
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  In 1992, I take the... I want the Boots Randolphs nightclub in Nashville.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  And I take this whole show with his permission, and I put it on YouTube.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  And the reason why I use Helms for the last name is I was Bobby Helms' manager for the last 21 years.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  Interesting. Anything else, sir? What do you think about the whole Chris Christie situation and shutting down a bridge to get back at someone?
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  Yeah, I don't like that guy. I don't like him at all.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  I don't have it. I don't know who next, you know, run for president. I guess he didn't turn, and I would start running for Christ's sake.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  Yeah, he'd be probably better than them.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  All right. Thank you so much for calling in.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  Christie fires aid in bridge scandal as U.S. opens inquiry.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  Justice Department is Governor Chris Christie apologized to the people of New Jersey on Thursday saying that he was embarrassed and humiliated by revelations that a top aide and other close associates ordered lane closures on the George Washington bridge deliberately snarl traffic as an act of political vengeance.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  He said he fired that aide, Bridget Ann Kelly, a deputy chief of staff whom he called stupid and deceitful.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  Revolations became public yesterday when a series of emails and tech show that members of the administration and others were deeply involved contradicting the governor's own earlier public statements on the matter.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  Oh, yeah, he ordered it, folks. That's what this is all about. That guy's a total thug.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  I am heartbroken that someone I permitted and I'm sure is getting Swiss bank account money now to fall on the sword. I am heartbroken that someone I permitted to be in the circle of trust for the past five years betrayed that trust.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  He said in a somber and humbling news conference, Mr. Christie fielded pointed questions for almost two hours.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  He acknowledged that he would have to work to restore the trust of the people.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  I'm a very sad person today. He said a person close to me betrayed me. Oh, yeah, right.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  Folks, what about when they don't build new roads in the state of Texas because all the money basically goes to build toll roads.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  That then they charge the public for using.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  It was like Obama came out a few days ago and was saying it's wrong to not extend all these unemployment benefits.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  You know, it's wrong to say that it encourages people not to work that we that you see unemployment for two, three years.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  It's very mean spirited. He was countering Rand Paul.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  And you know what's really mean spirited? What's mean spirited is deindustrializing the country and devaluing the dollar and setting up a system where only the insiders can operate.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  And trying to bring in more unskilled labor to drive down wages even more.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  That's what is really hurting people. So again, they cut your legs off and give you a pair of crutches.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  And so they always use roads and the shutdowns of roads and all of this. It's all social engineering. It's all I'm in control.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  I'll shut the road down if I if if I want to. This is what they do.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  The Queen of England. I've told this story probably 20 times and I witnessed it when I was there in 2005 days after London bombing to cover it.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  And we wrote around on one of those big double decker famous red buses so I could shoot footage B roll footage from my film Terror Storm.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  We would have this on video and the Asian lady with a British accent who was the tour guide on the top said you're you have free speech in England but do not criticize our Queen or you can be arrested.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  That's actually on the books. They just can't enforce it because it's so criminal.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  And she said today this road and that rotor closed at her pleasure to show that she owns the city of London and its roads.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  And I didn't even know that and went and looked it up later and my dad was like oh you didn't know that she shuts down major rivers and major canals randomly to exercise her power.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  And she shuts down random roads every day in London to show that she owns the roads.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  I didn't even know that and I've read a lot of history books. We should look up the history of that again and do a report for the Nightly News or the radio tomorrow about how the Queen shuts down roads like Chris Christie
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  and then tie it in but oh when she does it she's wearing a Miss America crown. She's the chief.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  I mean you laugh at pygmies and people wearing headdresses and stuff and jumping around the fire. It's the same deal. The Queen and Big Regalia with a scepter and a giant crown on her head and everyone bows to them.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  And oh let me go to England and courtesy and bow to you and kiss your hand. And then people get mad at Dennis Rodman.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  They get mad at Dennis Rodman because he is a complete idiot and a buffoon and obviously drunk out of his mind on television.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  But he goes over there to be with Kim Jong-un because he pays him millions of dollars with his moron entourage and talks about how great and like do you know why?
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  They're like well this man got detained for no reason. Do you know why he did?
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  And they're like yeah he had a Bible. So Dennis Rodman is defending people being disappeared because they had a Bible.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  Well he ought to run a public school in the U.S. that basically already happens to you here.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  So separation church and state means you can't have a Bible anywhere period.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  So it's easy to hate on Dennis the joke Rodman but that's not even the issue.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  I was watching CNN last night and they just kept going over how pathetic he is and how sting gets money from dictators and Uzbekistan or whatever.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  And isn't it terrible these people get millions of dollars to perform for dictators.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  And there was CNN on record because of Amber Lyon going public and others where foreign governments will pay up to $400,000 per episode for a news program about their country
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  as a payoff to not have negative news of them killing political activists and stuff.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  They're CNN who gets paid off to cover up the mass murder then criticizing the one country they're allowed to criticize in North Korea
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  because I guess they haven't made payments to CNN feeling good about themselves when they are a hundred times worse than Dennis Rodman.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000]  And as a guy that has a news division has a radio show.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  Imagine when I was driving back last night thinking about this from East Texas.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  I was frustrated wanting to call my reporters and wake them up to say hey somebody do a report on this because that's the torture of my job is I'm not as a radio host TV host news guy person trying to build a better media platform with the word out.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  I'm tortured by how many ideas I have of the hypocrisy that I can never deploy to expose the hypocrisy.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  So thank God I've got this radio show where I can get on air and I can talk about all this stuff at least I can talk about it and point the hypocrisy out.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  So briefly this broadcast is listed supported and when you get a nightly news subscription and infowarsnews.com or prisonplanet.tv.

[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  And I was talking to my cousin's girlfriend last night, really classy, nice lady.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  She's been waiting for years, but she's never listened to my show till one of her coworkers, she's in medical management, gave her last year is username and passcode to log on.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  She goes, oh, I know that guy. That's my boyfriend's cousin.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  And now she's a fan of the show.
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  And on her lunch break, watches the show at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  And she was telling me about stuff I had on the show last week.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  So there I was at my aunt's house out in the East Texas country side after his burial last night, talking to her.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  And then about how then she shared the passcode with somebody else.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  Now they're watching it.
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  And now the whole office on their lunch or large portions of it, listen to the audio feeds, the free audio feeds and download the free iPhone apps.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  And then how from she works for a big company, how an IT guy came by to work on their computers.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  And he said, what are you listening to there?
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  And she said, Alex Jones, he goes, well, now I respect you.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  And by the way, when somebody tells me something like that, it's humbling.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  It's humbling to hear that people respect me.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  And then I want to do a good job for you.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  I want to cover all the news.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  I want to, you know, to try to fight the tyranny.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  And some shows are really effective and good and others aren't.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  We're trying, I'm killing myself here, folks, to literally try to fight these people as hard as I can.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  And I don't know why I'm just saying that.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  It's just that that's all I think about is, is, is how real this is and the responsibility.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  And I just wish more people out there in America who are halfway awake realize that you're just as important as I am or more so.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  In fact, you're more important.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  You need to not thank me and not tell me what I need to do.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  I need you to spread the word.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  I need you to take action.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  And by the way, that's happening.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  And that's an incredibly positive thing.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  We couldn't have done any of this without you.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  Take the info wars life products, the high quality Chiapas, high mountain, organic, grown in or the volcanic soil.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  We couldn't have done that without you.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  High quality folks are loving it.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  We couldn't have developed the fluoride shield with the nascent iodine and the five other key ingredients to help detoxify your body without your support.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  And it's been a big success.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  We're, we're able to fund our operations.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  I should thank God for that.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  The blessings are incredible.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  And then of course we've got the survival shield, which is sold out, but the truck gets here next week.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  So effectively it really isn't sold out to get your order.

[01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:20.060]  they are?
[01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:22.940]  It's true, and he can email you the test results.

[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:51.340]  Hey, here's the deal, at least we're awake and there's a large group of us that know
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:56.860]  what's happening, and we've got to spread the word and we've got to fight the incredible...
[01:54:56.860 --> 01:55:01.020]  Now, what's the word for it?
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:08.100]  It's beyond apathy, it's almost like folks have given up in society and it just upsets
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:12.460]  me to see the poverty, it upsets me to see a system trying to make us poor to politically
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:17.220]  control us and admitting in their own white papers that's the plan and then seeing Obama
[01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:23.380]  up there on TV claiming he wants people to have prosperity and to see the globalist,
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:27.660]  the Chamber of Commerce that promoted NAFTA and GATT and all these other things in our
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:32.900]  deindustrialization now promoting totally open borders, which will just devastate the
[01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:33.900]  country.
[01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:38.700]  I mean, if Switzerland let everybody in, they would have incredibly low standard of living
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:43.700]  and they would be a collapsed society, but they only let people that are scientists or
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:50.060]  inventors or who are successful in and who have money, so the place is just incredibly
[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:54.100]  nice.
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:59.180]  And again, then you can use a wealthy country like that to build up the countries around
[01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:02.060]  them, like Libya was doing to the rest of Africa.
[01:56:02.060 --> 01:56:06.660]  You don't bring Libya down to bring up Africa, you don't bring down South Africa that was
[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:10.180]  doing better than the rest of Africa to build up the rest of Southern Africa.
[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:15.160]  You have big rich countries with high standards that then build up the standards of others
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:17.580]  in a free market system, that's the economics.
[01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:22.220]  You don't have the reverse where you lower your standards and transfer wealth to those
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:26.180]  countries, that's the liberal version of globalism, that's not what's happening.
[01:56:26.180 --> 01:56:30.300]  You transfer your wealth to the globalist who control the third world, who use that
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:37.940]  to then leverage you out in economic takeover.
[01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:43.540]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jane, thanks for holding, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:51.540]  Hey, Alex, how you doing today, I used to be a decontact for the nuclear plants, I worked
[01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:58.380]  nuclear outages and I've actually worked with this stuff and decontamination.
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:02.580]  If we would have walked up, if we were in a plant and we would have walked up on an
[01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:09.580]  area suddenly with the increase in radiation levels that you guys are finding, we would
[01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:16.100]  have stopped where we were, we would have gotten our meters, checked it out and at 100
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:24.420]  mAh an hour, I've seen on one of your reports that they were showing 152 mAh an hour, that
[01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:27.780]  would be considered a high rad area.
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:34.860]  We would post it and then we would check for loose contamination, if we found loose contamination
[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:38.860]  then we would look for airborne contamination.
[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:47.100]  My question here, your people, I don't like this stuff and I was very careful with it,
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:52.620]  we can have some protection but do you guys have like a rad tech or what's called an
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:54.980]  HP technician with your people?
[01:57:54.980 --> 01:57:59.780]  Well listen, here's the deal, the mainstream media won't go out there and cover it, the
[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:04.420]  government won't go out there and cover it, this stuff's already all over the place.
[01:58:04.420 --> 01:58:09.580]  So we're simply drawing attention, I mean we're lead suits, we're going up to the Red
[01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:14.540]  Woods now, hi Park Ranger, I'm in a lead suit, we don't know where we're going to find it
[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:19.660]  and according to the physicists and people I've talked to, they're saying 150 or 200
[01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:25.620]  levels, you'd have to be there months for it to have an effect but I guess you're saying
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:32.180]  that's a media whitewash, so explain it more to me when we come back in one minute, don't
[01:58:32.180 --> 01:58:39.100]  hang up Jane, that's what Dr. Busby says, he says any of this isn't good for you but
[01:58:39.100 --> 01:58:44.100]  it's raining on us, it's in the snow, I mean it's in Missouri.
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:51.020]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:55.260]  My friends Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning
[01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:57.300]  you and your family's health.
[01:58:57.300 --> 01:59:01.020]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere
[01:59:01.020 --> 01:59:04.460]  from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:08.540]  Radiolactive contamination is now in most of the food supply, there's only two ways
[01:59:08.540 --> 01:59:13.580]  to avoid this, move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent
[01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:14.580]  iodine.
[01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:17.420]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:22.460]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and
[01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:23.460]  your family.
[01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:26.620]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:31.220]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent
[01:59:31.220 --> 01:59:35.580]  iodine, exclusively available at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:41.220]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[01:59:41.220 --> 01:59:46.860]  Survival Shield nascent iodine, secure your super high quality nascent iodine today at
[01:59:46.860 --> 01:59:48.860]  InfowarsLife.com.
[01:59:48.860 --> 02:00:18.380]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[02:00:19.380 --> 02:00:25.940]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:29.380]  Chris Jordan just made a really good point, I'm going to cover it in the next segment
[02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:30.380]  after your phone calls.
[02:00:30.380 --> 02:00:36.060]  He said, could the big spikes, which are in the news, of natural radiation right on other
[02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:42.420]  things around the country, could it be associated with not fracking like I was saying, because
[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:43.420]  that can bring it up?
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:45.100]  I'm sure that's part of it.
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:49.940]  But more than that, the super volcano that's all of Yellowstone that would destroy the
[02:00:49.940 --> 02:01:02.460]  entire United States, the top scientists have said on record, just imagine the levels of
[02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:06.860]  natural radiation bound in the earth that are released during big volcanic eruptions
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:11.500]  or during earthquakes, and then think about that super volcano and all the bubbling sulfur
[02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:17.540]  and all the bubbling gases that are coming out, I bet that's part of why all over the
[02:01:17.540 --> 02:01:20.940]  United States they're getting radioactive snow, you name it.
[02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:22.740]  I bet it's the volcano.
[02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:26.660]  Now, certainly some of it's Fukushima, but all I know is radiation levels are going
[02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:28.460]  up all over North America.
[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:33.100]  And so that's why we're investigating and starting out with our crew on the West Coast
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:37.100]  is a good way to draw attention to it, show that experts come out of the woodwork and
[02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:38.820]  so we can have physicists on.
[02:01:38.820 --> 02:01:43.220]  And so people pay attention to this issue, and so we can set the agenda of talking about
[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:45.020]  real things, not diversions.
[02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:49.660]  Now we're talking to Jane in Florida, and she says she was a nuclear decontamination
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:58.860]  technician and that she thinks the levels of 250 millirads, or however you're technically
[02:01:58.860 --> 02:02:03.660]  supposed to describe it, is really dangerous.
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:07.300]  But according to the physicists and people we've had on, they're saying it would take
[02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:10.260]  months being around that for it to have any discernible effect.
[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:12.660]  I mean, it's coming down in the snow.
[02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:15.020]  This stuff's happening all over the place.
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:18.540]  And sure, you live in a house that has radon gas, it can kill you, you know, over a few
[02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:22.540]  years if you don't know about a radon, leak coming up from a fissure in the earth.
[02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:27.740]  Austin, Texas has a ton of radon, because the limestone and the old volcanoes, there's
[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:32.060]  three of them that surround Austin, three extinct volcanoes, but they're not really
[02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:33.060]  completely extinct.
[02:02:33.060 --> 02:02:38.340]  So, so quantify, Jane, what you're saying about the radiation readings that we showed.
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:44.820]  Well, at 250 m or an hour, we would not be allowed to hang out in that area at all.
[02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:45.820]  Oh, no, I agree.
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:49.660]  The physicists have been saying that they should be warning people not to swim in the
[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:50.660]  ocean there.
[02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:52.540]  So, that's why we're there.
[02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:58.540]  Yes, yes, but the way I was taught, I was taught back in the old days when we were
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:04.220]  taught that this stuff was really dangerous for us and out at the nuclear plants, they
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:09.700]  have areas, like I said, sectioned off and they tell us we're not allowed to go to base.
[02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:14.060]  And I can't remember because it's been so long since I've been out there.
[02:03:14.060 --> 02:03:21.940]  I know anything greater than 1000 m or an hour, that would require a special MRP would
[02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:26.980]  have to be an HP continuous coverage, you'd have to have somebody there with you at all
[02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:27.980]  time.
[02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:34.300]  As you said, that was the old days, now the EPA says radiation's not bad for you, George
[02:03:34.300 --> 02:03:38.180]  Mombiat says that we should be thankful for Fukushima, that's a quote.
[02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:42.940]  And so, in the new age of death, it's a good thing.
[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:50.100]  Well, I come from old school and they originally taught me you do not want to get this stuff
[02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:51.780]  inside of you.
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:57.660]  And in the middle of my time in the nuclear industry, they changed the rules and they
[02:03:57.660 --> 02:04:02.820]  took our respirators away from us and said, dose, dose, dose, no matter whether it's
[02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:03.820]  contamination.
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:06.140]  Hold on, I'm going to hold you over because I read about this and I'm going to show some
[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:07.540]  articles when we come back.
[02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:12.780]  I want to give you the floor to talk about your work, what you did, where you were.
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:16.580]  And because, I mean, I can tell you're telling the truth because I've done some layman research
[02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:20.980]  on this and yeah, by the mid 80s, they began to just say, you know what, don't worry about
[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:22.620]  radiation, it's not bad.
[02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:27.420]  And don't wear respirators and don't worry about it and so what they've done is they've
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:33.460]  unofficially raised what they say is safe, just like DU in 1990.
[02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:35.900]  Before that, they wouldn't let them use DU and they said, you know what, go ahead and
[02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:36.900]  use it.
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:41.980]  And now they're like, don't wear a mask, don't decon, this stuff's good for you.
[02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:46.220]  Oh, the whole SEAL team had to form kids, well, that's all right.
[02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:48.460]  It's good.
[02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:49.460]  We love you.
[02:04:49.460 --> 02:04:50.460]  So stay there.
[02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:53.580]  I'm going to come back, James, if you tell your whole story and break this down for folks.
[02:04:53.580 --> 02:04:54.580]  This is important to understand.
[02:04:54.580 --> 02:04:58.020]  Yeah, I know, I'm telling my reporters not to hang out in these areas, even though the
[02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:01.140]  government says it's safe.
[02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:06.420]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers, the prognosis for the entire planetary
[02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:09.220]  economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:15.300]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:16.300]  to the global takeover.
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:22.260]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.
[02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:25.860]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:30.940]  We've got the LifeStraw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.

[02:06:10.140 --> 02:06:14.180]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:18.540]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:23.820]  We have now managed to secure these sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:37.500]  heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:41.780]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[02:06:41.780 --> 02:06:44.380]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:34.540]  Generals gathered in them myself could increase radiation levels across the United States
[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:39.500]  being caused by the giant super volcano that's becoming active in Yellowstone we're going
[02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:45.820]  to talk about that coming up after calls and going over the news Jane is talking about
[02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:51.780]  how she was a nuclear decontamination technician nuclear power plants for a long time and how
[02:08:51.780 --> 02:08:55.620]  and she's going to give you a timeline because I'm actually aware of what she's saying I've
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:08:59.740]  researched it what she's saying is accurate and true is I want you to hear from an expert
[02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:04.620]  that then they started saying oh no radiation is no longer dangerous a dose is a dose is
[02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:10.500]  a dose go ahead and don't wear respirators don't worry about higher levels of radiation
[02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:15.260]  it's no big deal and they're now officially saying they're going to raise the radiation
[02:09:15.260 --> 02:09:19.500]  levels of what they say is safe and that's now been done just like they wouldn't let
[02:09:19.500 --> 02:09:26.700]  the troops use the pleaded uranium for a 30 40 year history of it being developed in
[02:09:26.700 --> 02:09:32.860]  the late 40s in the nuclear weapons industry and then by 1990 they said you know what go
[02:09:32.860 --> 02:09:39.740]  ahead and let the US military use it and then now they use it at shooting ranges now it's
[02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:46.460]  used in forklifts now it's in airplane parts it's just everywhere it's almost like they're
[02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:50.460]  aliens running things that really live in a radioactive environment and they want us
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:55.460]  to make things radioactive I'm not really saying that I don't believe that before Rachel Maddow
[02:09:55.460 --> 02:10:01.580]  plays that clip I'm saying that's the level of you look for logic you look for a reason
[02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:05.820]  why would you do this why would you contaminate your own environment why would you crap in
[02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:11.740]  your own nest why would you destroy your children's future and it's really that maybe they're
[02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:19.940]  controlled by BLZ bub the old red tailed space alien and of course I'm being somewhat sarcastic
[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:26.860]  there but that's really what this comes down to whether whatever cosmology you put on it
[02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:31.980]  these people are bad news and here's some of those articles radiation alerts hit us cities
[02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:39.300]  that sound of world net daily last year in December as huge increases popped up all over
[02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:47.180]  the United States all over the United States it lists them here and Reno Nevada and California
[02:10:47.180 --> 02:10:59.060]  and Utah and just Western cities but also Eastern cities and Midwestern cities 456 compared
[02:10:59.060 --> 02:11:09.780]  to what they claim the regular levels 15 to 20 to 30 numbers of 279 222 and we're finding
[02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:16.220]  stuff over a thousand which is what the local local radiologist people are going out there
[02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:20.420]  with our counters and then the health department's like yeah well we found 500% increase but we're
[02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:24.740]  not going to investigate it it's no big deal it's this attitude of don't investigate that's
[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:29.340]  why I've been harping on this now I've got a bunch of other breaking news here that we
[02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:35.260]  need to get to but we'll do that after we after we take some of these calls I mean let me
[02:11:35.260 --> 02:11:40.700]  just give you a taste of what's coming up swearing toddler in thug video taken into protective
[02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:47.660]  custody by the CPS the Nebraska toddler who are you repeated a slew of profanities in
[02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:52.620]  an online video has been taken into child protective custody Omaha police said Wednesday
[02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:56.460]  while authorities found nothing criminal the video officials with the Omaha police
[02:11:56.460 --> 02:12:00.740]  child victim unit Nebraska child protective services took the infant and three other
[02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:05.620]  children into custody the police department said on its Facebook page the joint investigation
[02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:14.500]  found safety concerns the statement said in the video the diaper child is bombarded with
[02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:19.580]  obscenities and racial slurs by the adults around him the African-American toddler knocks
[02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:24.660]  down a chair and gives nearly as good as he gets responding to some of the comments with
[02:12:24.660 --> 02:12:32.260]  an upraised middle finger and telling one of the adults to shut the bleep up the adults
[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:41.420]  laugh and prompt him to repeat other crudities well this is what happens when children raise
[02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:47.740]  children this is the arrested development of the gangster culture but the issue is do
[02:12:47.740 --> 02:12:51.700]  you want to have your kids taken if they get seen cussing because kids learn this stuff
[02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:56.260]  from other children as well and now surely this video looks like it's going to be a bad
[02:12:56.260 --> 02:13:02.940]  house you could say that that is reasonable suspicion probable cause to investigate the
[02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:09.820]  problem is the history of the CPS especially in Omaha boy do you know about that running
[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:15.980]  a giant republican party pito ring out of Omaha with the CPS you name it and that came
[02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:23.020]  out in court certified the biggest pedophile ring in government ever found led back to
[02:13:23.020 --> 02:13:30.420]  Boys Town led back to led back to Penn State I remember Senator DeKamp big republican former
[02:13:30.420 --> 02:13:40.660]  CIA guy black ops Vietnam on my show a decade plus before Penn State broke saying they had
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:45.700]  a pedophile ring in Penn State and me shutting him down on air in fact those recordings are
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:51.700]  out there because he didn't have proof of that I didn't want to get sued and so you
[02:13:51.700 --> 02:14:01.140]  know the and of course later it came out the whole point here is that we're here talking
[02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:06.060]  about Chris Christie shutting down a road and being caught lying obviously to get back
[02:14:06.060 --> 02:14:11.420]  at his political enemies I mean you look at that bloated gangster thug up there defending
[02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:17.780]  himself but doing these fake apologies I mean it's just horrible but the corruption runs
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:21.340]  much much deeper than that ladies and gentlemen you know they bust some New York governor
[02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:26.420]  for visiting hookers I mean give me a break folks they'll bust you for visiting hookers
[02:14:26.420 --> 02:14:31.820]  they'll bust you for not paying a thousand dollars your taxes but when you commit the
[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:37.340]  big mega crimes they're so big you can't be brought down because it's too big to fail
[02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:41.900]  these pedophile rings these banker rings these narcotics trafficking rings these these
[02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:47.060]  radiation trafficking rings the nuclear power industry they're too big to fail when they
[02:14:47.060 --> 02:14:54.460]  fail oh let's build more reactors and so we've got those reports there we've got some other
[02:14:54.460 --> 02:15:00.260]  news first H5N1 avian flu death in North America that's a big deal from CNN we're gonna be breaking
[02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:06.140]  that down but let's go back and go to Jane then we'll go to Raider and Jack and Chris
[02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:11.660]  and Mark and others that are patiently holding but Jane until the break in five minutes you've
[02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:16.900]  got the floor tell folks about yourself what you saw how they now say radiation safe when
[02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:20.500]  they didn't say that in the past and from somebody that did this your perspective on
[02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:25.620]  what's happening well I'll tell you what when I first got into the business I started at
[02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:32.780]  the bottom and I worked my way up and one time we had to clean out a slump a slump area
[02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:38.140]  and it was designated clean I did not like the survey so halfway into it now this is
[02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:43.980]  stuff for liquid stuff for taking out putting in a 55 gallon barrel drum halfway through
[02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:50.740]  I decided to take another sample I took the sample up to where the HP's are the rad text
[02:15:50.740 --> 02:15:56.900]  to to get a reading on it and as soon as I stepped through where the meters were every
[02:15:56.900 --> 02:16:01.260]  single single one of those meters went off and all I could do at that point was just
[02:16:01.260 --> 02:16:06.940]  step back and hold what I had I wasn't allowed to to put it down I wasn't allowed to move
[02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:12.620]  I wasn't allowed to do anything and this caused a big stink up into the plant and plant ended
[02:16:12.620 --> 02:16:19.220]  up being fine I'm not going to say which plant it was but I ended up because I found
[02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:24.940]  that and this was going up out into the ocean because I found that I ended up cleaning toilets
[02:16:24.940 --> 02:16:31.940]  all for two months because because they faced a hefty fine so it's not that you know they
[02:16:31.940 --> 02:16:37.340]  they did not want it known that it was going out into the ocean and this kind of stuff
[02:16:37.340 --> 02:16:42.860]  I worked at another plant one time one of their tanks out back was leaking and it was
[02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:48.860]  leaking into the ground and they were as fast as possible trying to replace that soil because
[02:16:48.860 --> 02:16:55.420]  there the NRC was going to come in and they didn't want to get busted and everybody works
[02:16:55.420 --> 02:17:01.860]  with them because we none of us wanted to lose our jobs this stuff is going on continuously
[02:17:01.860 --> 02:17:08.980]  continuously and I'll never get back on in the nuclear field after this phone call well
[02:17:08.980 --> 02:17:15.100]  you've got a lot of courage and it's come out that it's a whole culture of cover-ups
[02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:20.700]  and now they're just mainlining the cover-ups to mainstream dinosaur media and government
[02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:27.820]  and that's such the table for just incredible disasters doesn't the people that you want
[02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:33.620]  to get in touch with Alex to help you to give you truth about what's really out there don't
[02:17:33.620 --> 02:17:39.580]  go to the house people that like the HP that you would get from the actual house go to
[02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:45.340]  the contractors every nuclear outage they have they bring contractors from around the
[02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:50.500]  country they bring them in those contractors are the ones that you want to give you what's
[02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:54.300]  really going on they have the experience the house tax I'll be honest with you I'm not
[02:17:54.300 --> 02:17:59.460]  talking about they haven't made easiest it's just like working for the county you kick
[02:17:59.460 --> 02:18:05.060]  back you don't do anything you get paid for it and it is the contractors to travel around
[02:18:05.060 --> 02:18:09.900]  and do these different outages you want to senior HP senior rad tech I think is what
[02:18:09.900 --> 02:18:15.540]  they're calling them nowadays that's the one that you want to get a hold of to give you
[02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:20.260]  an indication to tell you what you guys are walking into you at least want to know what
[02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:29.580]  you're walking into before you walk into it that's all I'm saying I'm you know I just
[02:18:29.580 --> 02:18:37.220]  learned to respect the stuff absolutely and the local radiation detector manufacturer
[02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:44.860]  who went out there and found levels 1400 times said do not swim do not go in that area it's
[02:18:44.860 --> 02:18:50.740]  dangerous what you're saying is exactly what he said we went to the same area found a thousand
[02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:58.660]  a thousand times what the regular background level generally is and so again this is another
[02:18:58.660 --> 02:19:05.900]  illustration of 30 years ago this would have been a big news story now it's just we're

[02:24:35.660 --> 02:24:44.540]  on the air how you doing alex good all right i have a kind of a question to ask you on
[02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:50.140]  reference to a previous show you were talking about you said that at the bottom of the rabbit
[02:24:50.140 --> 02:24:57.420]  hole is pure evil and coming for as a faithless soldier and a religious person i think the
[02:24:57.420 --> 02:25:03.900]  lord has a kind of allowed this evil to persist now i want to ask you what do you think has
[02:25:03.900 --> 02:25:11.100]  caused this to be brought on us this type of evil well the fact that we don't fight evil
[02:25:11.740 --> 02:25:16.460]  and that we've embraced it and i really think aborting 50 plus million people
[02:25:17.980 --> 02:25:23.180]  here and then tens of millions in other countries the lie that that's not a human the lie that
[02:25:23.180 --> 02:25:29.340]  it's disposable we made all of ourselves disposable and opened ourselves up at that moment
[02:25:29.340 --> 02:25:35.500]  and with the sun slipping upside down do you think it's just gonna we're gonna plunge
[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:40.780]  deeper into the rabbit hole or do you think there's a bottom we're gonna break through or
[02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:45.740]  is this just the beginning i think it's uh just the beginning
[02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:56.380]  and why do you think that because the people are gonna have to be judged and god doesn't
[02:25:56.380 --> 02:26:01.260]  and from my experience even actually generally do something to you god just steps back and
[02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:06.940]  removes the hedge of protection so that evil can have its way with you we open the door to evil
[02:26:06.940 --> 02:26:14.700]  god steps back and lets the evil in because we have free will and so it's like the song
[02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:22.940]  from the band i think it's called the order of death it's this is what you want this is what
[02:26:22.940 --> 02:26:28.300]  you get we've got that in the computer and that that's really what it is and and you know even
[02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:33.820]  before my cousin died my uncle died and great uncle died in the last four months even before
[02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:37.180]  all those others that have been i was having a feeling of dread and i still have it it's not
[02:26:37.180 --> 02:26:44.060]  over my family dying and that string of you know hard knocks it's it's the cultural things i see
[02:26:44.060 --> 02:26:49.740]  and all the signs i see and the things that are going and government gearing up for collapse and
[02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:58.700]  and government not caring anymore and corporations not caring anymore and and really a real spirit
[02:26:58.700 --> 02:27:05.900]  of wanton destruction and i think we're entering a really bad area of the cycle and those of us
[02:27:06.460 --> 02:27:11.100]  that are good people and love justice and love god who aren't just Pharisee bible thumpers that
[02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:17.500]  hide their mega churches and feel good all day and you know are on power trips of arrogance and
[02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:22.860]  narcissism i mean a lot of so-called christians you run into or that are Pharisees they're more like
[02:27:23.660 --> 02:27:32.780]  arrogant narcissist on self-righteous power trips who who don't ever see any of the real
[02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:36.540]  corruption or problems they just want to feel self-righteous and better than everybody
[02:27:37.660 --> 02:27:43.020]  those people have got a really rude awakening with everything is coming down the road i mean at
[02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:48.620]  least worldly people who've given into the system uh you know will admit that the whole world's going
[02:27:48.620 --> 02:27:53.020]  to hell in a handbasket so you might as well have fun riding it down at least they're honest
[02:27:53.900 --> 02:28:00.460]  it's these lukewarm yuppies and trendies and fake christians and they oh they like obama because
[02:28:00.460 --> 02:28:05.660]  he's loving and fights racism and the world's doing good and they're the moral people and you're not
[02:28:05.660 --> 02:28:10.700]  in global warming's real so you better pay carbon taxes to them and they're the authority they have
[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:16.460]  the high ground and everyone else is a piece of trash but them and but then oh listen to you talking
[02:28:16.460 --> 02:28:23.980]  about the radiation or listen to you talking about and and those people always buy into the hype machine
[02:28:23.980 --> 02:28:34.300]  too and i think vanity vanity in the final equation and and and and the self-serving
[02:28:34.300 --> 02:28:41.740]  arrogance of the world is the grease that's going to skid everything going over the edge and i mean
[02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:47.420]  look i'm just going to tell you i've always said i think we've got more time before the big collapse
[02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:51.980]  and war and all this i don't i don't think we did unless there's a major reprieve of this civilization
[02:28:51.980 --> 02:28:57.740]  this society and people really hit their knees and and and and repent even if you're not a bad person
[02:28:57.740 --> 02:29:03.740]  we all need to repent for just being part of this whole thing i think 2014 is going to be
[02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:11.340]  super bad i mean uh do any of you out there not feel it i mean does anyone listening to me who's
[02:29:11.340 --> 02:29:18.620]  awake not feel the dread of drums drums in the deep they are coming uh anything else call her
[02:29:19.980 --> 02:29:27.260]  yeah um well this was kind of a separate issue i'm a frequent listener and i don't i know you
[02:29:27.260 --> 02:29:32.220]  don't screen calls but i think maybe in this year you might need to change that policy because as
[02:29:32.220 --> 02:29:39.100]  i've been listening past the past couple years it seems like you get calls that just uh are intended
[02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:46.620]  to rile you up mess with your head or clearly like you know uh you know government workers stay there

[02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:58.940]  now i'll tell you what it is whenever i give out the number on a specific subject like let me
[02:33:58.940 --> 02:34:05.820]  hear from military personnel or let me hear from radiation workers or let me hear from truck drivers
[02:34:05.820 --> 02:34:11.420]  we can fill the phones up with incredible callers when i just say wide open phones whatever you want
[02:34:11.420 --> 02:34:17.100]  we're not screening calls it's going to be people calling in with an agenda or people calling in
[02:34:18.300 --> 02:34:22.860]  who are off work that day sitting back drinking beer i mean quite frankly a lot of times i say
[02:34:22.860 --> 02:34:28.220]  are you have you been drinking and they go yeah or on the sunday show i can tell when somebody's
[02:34:28.220 --> 02:34:34.700]  been smoking pot i go you're stoned right now they're like yeah sure am and you know what that's
[02:34:34.700 --> 02:34:40.940]  part of the reality of the show but we probably should use this platform better sometimes like i
[02:34:40.940 --> 02:34:48.140]  should have thought let's open the phones up for former or current nuclear power plant workers or
[02:34:49.180 --> 02:34:54.300]  submarine workers nuclear submarine folks so they could call in and give their take on what's
[02:34:54.300 --> 02:34:58.380]  happening because i can have nuclear physicists on and i can have but really getting people that
[02:34:58.380 --> 02:35:04.300]  work in and around this that's what's really important to do so maybe tomorrow for 30 minutes
[02:35:04.300 --> 02:35:10.540]  or an hour i'll open the phones up and go to their calls and get people on who have worked in all this
[02:35:12.140 --> 02:35:18.780]  because we have such a great pool of intelligent great people out there it does kind of insult
[02:35:18.780 --> 02:35:24.220]  their intelligence sometimes to then just have a free for all and let anybody do what they want
[02:35:24.860 --> 02:35:29.260]  which nobody doesn't talk radio but i do things a little bit different
[02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:33.820]  but separately from that
[02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:40.700]  i don't want to spend too much time talking about the callers here today but jack finish your point
[02:35:42.300 --> 02:35:46.300]  oh well i have one other point i was just saying that you should maybe keep an eye on here
[02:35:46.860 --> 02:35:51.180]  the callers and also make a maybe do some background checks on your staff if you don't
[02:35:51.180 --> 02:35:56.620]  already do that my other point is with this legalization of marijuana i used to have people
[02:35:56.620 --> 02:36:04.460]  calling him uh stone and whatever um i know i spoke talk for about our stone for seven years
[02:36:04.460 --> 02:36:10.220]  and just recently decided it's just because it's uh not really the most healthiest choice to do for
[02:36:10.220 --> 02:36:17.260]  your mind um but through that seven years being stoned i've uh met some interesting people and
[02:36:17.260 --> 02:36:23.660]  one of them works for this uh giant medicinal farm on the west coast in california and he openly
[02:36:23.660 --> 02:36:29.820]  told me that they're spraying benzos and all sorts of pharmaceuticals on that crop so all how you're
[02:36:29.820 --> 02:36:35.500]  saying that uh the feds are using this is another form of control that's very likely because uh
[02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:43.020]  this is not the same hippy stuff from the 70s and 60s continue on that line
[02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:51.020]  well i met this guy you know just um you know how it is like you meet people around here and there
[02:36:51.020 --> 02:36:56.780]  and started talking to him and uh you know we're exchanging stories about this and that and he
[02:36:56.780 --> 02:37:02.540]  told me about how he used used to work for this huge grow up outside of LA and uh this was a couple
[02:37:02.540 --> 02:37:10.220]  years ago when medicinal was just kind of starting to spread in that area and uh if you're a smoker
[02:37:11.100 --> 02:37:15.260]  you can kind of realize that you know not only are there different strains but also
[02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:20.940]  when you're smoking it the actual burning process kind of changed now where there's kind of like
[02:37:20.940 --> 02:37:27.580]  a crackling um different taste and you know they kind of attribute that to the nutrients they put
[02:37:27.580 --> 02:37:32.780]  in the soil when they're growing this stuff indoors but he openly said that yeah they're putting a
[02:37:32.780 --> 02:37:38.940]  bunch of crap in their fertilizers and nutrients but they're also spraying the plants with uh some
[02:37:38.940 --> 02:37:43.900]  unknown chemicals and he said that there were crops that they were spraying and there were
[02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:48.140]  separate crops that they would keep in a completely separate area that they wouldn't spray and they
[02:37:48.140 --> 02:37:53.580]  wouldn't cross contaminate now i hear you very interesting i appreciate your call that's the
[02:37:53.580 --> 02:38:01.900]  type of investigative report we should do because when you look at governments and the globalist
[02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:09.340]  mindset of a technocratic scientific elite the whole world is a petri dish is a laboratory
[02:38:09.340 --> 02:38:16.300]  and we are getting pigs living on this scientific reservation and so the question is what aren't
[02:38:16.300 --> 02:38:22.140]  they manipulating what aren't they studying what aren't they trying to dominate as hyper control freaks
[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:32.060]  and since the 50s when they began to deploy cia produced lsd on the college campuses that's declassified
[02:38:33.180 --> 02:38:39.420]  they have been adding things to marijuana hallucinogens you name it putting it on the
[02:38:39.420 --> 02:38:48.780]  street as test by the 50s they would put pcp in the marijuana and ship it into the black
[02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:53.180]  neighborhoods i mean that's been in congress so you wonder why black neighborhoods still today
[02:38:53.180 --> 02:39:03.500]  have the taste for pcp loaded marijuana that's because uncle sam gave them gave them the the
[02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:13.820]  sugar tooth for it and when you look at this everyone i know that smokes pot on a basis of
[02:39:15.260 --> 02:39:22.220]  hitting it really hardcore has been fundamentally altered and brain damaged by it and look i'm
[02:39:22.220 --> 02:39:28.620]  not one to talk i've drunk my fair share of liquor okay i don't like marijuana i like liquor and i've
[02:39:28.620 --> 02:39:32.700]  had battles up and down with it i mean i don't drink a ton but i like to drink i like to relax
[02:39:32.700 --> 02:39:37.020]  and turn my brain off because believe me if i don't drink a few beers or a few glasses of wine at
[02:39:37.020 --> 02:39:44.860]  night or a couple vodka and tonics i mean i cannot go to sleep i cannot quit thinking about this
[02:39:44.860 --> 02:39:52.700]  and i get it's not even depressed it's more uh just just totally sick of the information and
[02:39:52.700 --> 02:39:57.180]  i can't quit thinking about it and i have all these great ideas when i'm away from work and i
[02:39:57.180 --> 02:40:01.180]  want to do all this work and so look i'm not knocking people like to recreationally drink
[02:40:01.180 --> 02:40:05.820]  some wine or smoke some pot but the pot that was around in the 60s is not the pot that's around
[02:40:05.820 --> 02:40:11.580]  today it's been genetically engineered many of the top strains to be much more powerful
[02:40:13.420 --> 02:40:18.620]  people say they do drugs sometimes to test them i do smoke marijuana and i'm on record
[02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:26.060]  about once a year literally as a broadcaster to be able to tell people how powerful it is
[02:40:26.060 --> 02:40:33.980]  and and i have i have i have tried i don't think i'll even do it again i mean i've smoked pot
[02:40:33.980 --> 02:40:40.780]  in the last two years one time where i couldn't get out of the chair i was in two hits off a
[02:40:40.780 --> 02:40:47.180]  marijuana cigarette ladies and gentlemen and let me tell you let me tell you i'm against throwing
[02:40:47.180 --> 02:40:51.260]  people in jail for this stuff because it's the government controlling it to begin with and it's
[02:40:51.260 --> 02:40:59.580]  all a big racket but there's a reason they're legalizing it a the war on drugs has been exposed
[02:40:59.580 --> 02:41:03.260]  they can move on to all the other drugs they're they're putting on the streets to put you in
[02:41:03.260 --> 02:41:07.980]  jail with that they've lost the fight over marijuana almost every cop out there has smoked it before
[02:41:07.980 --> 02:41:13.260]  almost every judge out there has smoked it before old-fashioned marijuana on records a lot better
[02:41:13.260 --> 02:41:19.020]  for you than alcohol so they're losing that battle all they do is pivot over and then take it over
[02:41:19.020 --> 02:41:25.340]  to tax it and regulate it and then to make it a pharmaceutical and they're adding all sorts of
[02:41:25.340 --> 02:41:29.820]  stuff to it you see marijuana is already in the hallucinogen class it's psychotropic
[02:41:31.820 --> 02:41:37.500]  and they want people docile not fighting back not thinking for themselves and that marijuana is the
[02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:44.460]  perfect thing for that marijuana is the perfect thing to deploy against the public so let's get
[02:41:44.460 --> 02:41:50.460]  this straight i'm for drug decriminalization i know the drug war is a fraud i've been doing this for
[02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:56.540]  18 years back when that was not popular 18 years ago but i want to add i do not endorse the drug
[02:41:56.540 --> 02:42:07.580]  culture i do not endorse marijuana i think it's bad and that's what i have to say on the subject
[02:42:07.580 --> 02:42:14.940]  i mean there are some people that can smoke it responsibly and not turn into vegetables
[02:42:16.380 --> 02:42:23.340]  but most people can't do it and again if you've got a government constantly caught
[02:42:23.340 --> 02:42:28.220]  jacking the entire food supply jacking the water what do you think they're going to put in the
[02:42:28.220 --> 02:42:34.940]  marijuana and i've talked to high-level people on the go in the green triangle the emerald triangle
[02:42:34.940 --> 02:42:41.580]  and in northern california and others they all pay off the police they all pay off the government
[02:42:42.700 --> 02:42:47.740]  they're allowed to operate planes come over and spray it they're told keep your mouth shut
[02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:55.500]  it's not a defoliant it's not an agent orange chemical it's not periquad they're spraying it
[02:42:55.500 --> 02:43:03.660]  with stuff and it could be bill gates nano vaccine that they've patented rolling out you don't know
[02:43:03.660 --> 02:43:08.860]  that's the thing the government has unlimited funding and our money and our wealth to put
[02:43:08.860 --> 02:43:13.260]  stuff in the water the food everywhere and they are obviously targeting the marijuana
[02:43:14.700 --> 02:43:16.460]  because i'm going to tell you something folks
[02:43:20.220 --> 02:43:23.820]  if i can't get out of a chair it's a hardcore drug
[02:43:26.060 --> 02:43:33.020]  okay because i've got an extreme tolerance and not even from using drugs
[02:43:33.020 --> 02:43:37.340]  for whatever reason i've tried to put me to sleep before for surgery it took nine times
[02:43:37.340 --> 02:43:41.180]  the normal level a hospital record i was waking up they had to restrain me
[02:43:41.820 --> 02:43:46.220]  literally attacking the people sawing into my leg fixing a compound break i had
[02:43:47.900 --> 02:43:53.660]  i was 16 then so if i can't get out of a chair for an hour and a half two hours when i smoke pot
[02:43:53.660 --> 02:43:59.580]  let me tell you this stuff's bad now grabbing a kid and throwing them in juvenile hall well
[02:43:59.580 --> 02:44:04.220]  they'll learn to use 100 drugs and giving them a record so they can't no no no that's an even
[02:44:04.220 --> 02:44:11.340]  greater crime i'm just saying kids do you think it's cool to smoke pot all day no it's not what's
[02:44:11.340 --> 02:44:17.100]  cool is to hike up a mountaintop and get an endorphin rush when you hike three miles you know
[02:44:17.100 --> 02:44:22.700]  up a trail and then conceive for 50 miles around you what's great is to paint a beautiful painting
[02:44:22.700 --> 02:44:28.860]  or to make a film or beautiful music or to be successful and be honorable you have normal drugs
[02:44:28.860 --> 02:44:34.780]  in your brain and that's what you want that's what you go after so again my move against the drug
[02:44:34.780 --> 02:44:41.660]  war is not an endorsement of the drug culture i cannot stand the drug culture i cannot stand drug
[02:44:41.660 --> 02:44:49.740]  people marijuana a hundred percent is a gateway drug into everything else they use that truth though
[02:44:49.740 --> 02:44:53.180]  is a way to then throw the book at you when that only makes you get more into the culture
[02:44:53.180 --> 02:45:00.220]  alcohol is a gateway into all this stuff pharma kia humans have been putting things into our
[02:45:00.220 --> 02:45:08.700]  bodies since the first days of our species you can watch blue jays get in a tree and eat
[02:45:08.700 --> 02:45:13.420]  china berries after they've gone ripe and they have alcohol in them and get drunk and literally
[02:45:13.420 --> 02:45:21.740]  fall on the ground are you going to arrest the blue jay no you shouldn't arrest people for
[02:45:21.740 --> 02:45:28.540]  chemicals in their body that is as old as humanity it's as old as drinking alcohol
[02:45:29.740 --> 02:45:34.940]  but you should be able to criticize it because the drugies get real mad when i talk like this
[02:45:35.500 --> 02:45:38.300]  and it's because it's destructive and i don't like it
[02:45:42.140 --> 02:45:46.620]  so this is what we're dealing with ladies and gentlemen what does a dolphin use to get high
[02:45:46.620 --> 02:45:52.460]  a toxic puffer fish that makes them lapse into a trance like state that's right dolphins like
[02:45:52.460 --> 02:45:59.420]  to take hallucinogens they've got a brain bigger than ours and one side of it is always awake
[02:45:59.420 --> 02:46:05.020]  even on the other side sleeping pretty neat now are we going to arrest the dolphins because they
[02:46:05.020 --> 02:46:12.140]  like to get high no you got to be honest with kids and about how destructive this stuff can be but
[02:46:12.140 --> 02:46:17.260]  see they want to put them on all the pros act drugs all the adderall speed stuff is even worse
[02:46:17.260 --> 02:46:21.500]  than marijuana worse than cocaine let me tell you i've looked at the molecules i've interviewed
[02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:32.460]  medical doctors adderall stuff like that riddlin louvox that stuff is way worse than cocaine folks
[02:46:33.820 --> 02:46:37.100]  they're probably not gonna ever get enough money to kill themselves on cocaine
[02:46:37.100 --> 02:46:44.780]  gaming for long periods can make you hallucinate and have seizures that's in major studies
[02:46:44.780 --> 02:46:49.580]  we're all being programmed look you don't just get programmed with drugs they're programming you with
[02:46:50.140 --> 02:46:55.660]  viruses they're programming you with nano tech they're programming you with chemicals in the air
[02:46:55.660 --> 02:47:01.580]  they're there and this whole new world order brave new world read brave new world read brave new
[02:47:01.580 --> 02:47:10.220]  world revisited nonfiction is about taking us over with drugs and not even using drugs to empower
[02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:14.460]  the human species i'm not even saying you can really do that there's some evidence that
[02:47:15.340 --> 02:47:22.700]  psilocybin mushrooms and yes if you can get pharmaceutical lsd can boost iq massively the
[02:47:22.700 --> 02:47:27.180]  problem is is that the average person may not be able to handle that especially if they've got
[02:47:27.180 --> 02:47:32.300]  life issues and other things i mean that's what i'm telling you folks this isn't a game the bible
[02:47:32.300 --> 02:47:40.060]  says pharmacia is of the devil and is of sorcerers and don't take it well what do you call the pharmacy
[02:47:41.100 --> 02:47:47.660]  mind-altering pharmacia it opens your mind up to a lot of things and a lot of scientists think
[02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:52.380]  that it's not actually boosting your brain it's only opening your brain up to areas that were
[02:47:52.380 --> 02:47:59.260]  already there you weren't in touch with and opening you up to other things that are around you and
[02:47:59.260 --> 02:48:03.420]  that's why people that try to get you know witches you name it take it to make contact with the other
[02:48:03.420 --> 02:48:09.580]  side and whether you believe that physically exist or exist another dimension it exists in your
[02:48:09.580 --> 02:48:16.300]  mind so as might as well be real that's what women in the broom is running around the fire
[02:48:16.300 --> 02:48:26.540]  here taking the hemlock taking the other hallucinogenic drugs the nightshade the
[02:48:28.220 --> 02:48:33.420]  mistletoe and by the way folks don't take that stuff you take too much your heart will explode
[02:48:34.780 --> 02:48:37.660]  people talk about hallucinogens there's a loose uh
[02:48:38.700 --> 02:48:45.500]  buckhorn buck eyes it's just everywhere i mean i can go out with a book on plants and get
[02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:51.340]  blasted out of my brain in 20 minutes i can leave this office drive to the woods and i can show you
[02:48:51.340 --> 02:48:57.900]  hallucinogens growing everywhere i can take them home like a witch and stew them up in my black pot
[02:48:57.900 --> 02:49:03.260]  piece of this piece of that and then i'll see the devil if i want to that's all this stuff is and
[02:49:03.260 --> 02:49:09.980]  they're jacking it in the food the water the pot the pharmaceuticals they're deciding what to put in
[02:49:09.980 --> 02:49:15.900]  you ladies and gentlemen they're deciding how to program you they're deciding what to do and you
[02:49:15.900 --> 02:49:21.420]  take hallucinogens now and all these other drugs and the synthetic ones with the with the electromagnetic
[02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:27.500]  stuff in the televisions for 50 years they've had monkeys chained up different generations of monkeys
[02:49:27.500 --> 02:49:31.980]  putting them on drugs and then hitting them with electromagnetic radiation hitting them with
[02:49:31.980 --> 02:49:36.940]  television frequencies radio frequency they're testing it and now they're all doing it to us
[02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:44.780]  we're being bombarded and that's why you see people becoming evil breaking down acting strange
[02:49:44.780 --> 02:49:50.700]  acting weird because it's going on everywhere we're being tested on we're being manipulated this is

[02:55:12.540 --> 02:55:18.140]  for all this illegal garbage they put in there and then they tell you by the way we're doing it
[02:55:18.140 --> 02:55:24.140]  to hide it in plain view so that you think it's normal i've noticed this hunting uh quail dove
[02:55:24.140 --> 02:55:30.620]  uh pheasant you name it if you literally walk around like you're doing nothing with the kind
[02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:36.700]  of the rifle shotgun down by your side like you're not hunting they will come right out
[02:55:36.700 --> 02:55:41.180]  and they will not fly away you can shoot them but if you're looking like a predator and got
[02:55:41.180 --> 02:55:47.740]  the gun like this they flee and that's basically epigenetics where they took 10 generations of
[02:55:47.740 --> 02:55:53.660]  chickens i'm gonna do a whole report on this and bread of indoors never seen anything outside and
[02:55:53.660 --> 02:56:01.020]  took the 10th generation or was the 11th generation put them in a room with a fake sky over it
[02:56:01.900 --> 02:56:07.580]  and had a cloud go by had a plane go by had the shape of a person go by chickens didn't care
[02:56:08.620 --> 02:56:16.860]  have a hawk fly by they all freak out and run away because genetically there's an actual memory
[02:56:16.860 --> 02:56:22.940]  this has been proven transmitted into higher order animals everything they do in this world
[02:56:22.940 --> 02:56:28.540]  is to block your instincts your archetypal instincts that are already there that guides you
[02:56:28.540 --> 02:56:32.860]  they've gotten rid of all of our old rituals they've replaced them with destructive rituals
[02:56:32.860 --> 02:56:40.140]  we're being programmed ladies and gentlemen scientifically and i'm like a throwback caveman
[02:56:40.140 --> 02:56:44.620]  freaking out black black black black black uniforms checkpoint black black mid-government
[02:56:44.620 --> 02:56:49.020]  read their documents read their documents i mean it's not like i'm special or something our enemies
[02:56:49.020 --> 02:56:54.460]  are sitting there openly saying they're coming after us openly saying they're enslaving us
[02:56:54.460 --> 02:57:00.860]  putting us on drugs to dumb us down and make us biological robots the ones that they allow to live
[02:57:02.060 --> 02:57:07.980]  and and then i'm going my god we're under attack but the people have already been raised indoors
[02:57:07.980 --> 02:57:12.940]  so long domesticated that they're like listen to that word oh listen to that word oh it's not really
[02:57:12.940 --> 02:57:23.420]  a chicken it's more like a parrot imitation it's a chicken with a with a parrot voice and i realize
[02:57:23.420 --> 02:57:28.300]  i'm just an old-fashioned instinctive person enemies openly announced they're drugging me and
[02:57:28.300 --> 02:57:33.420]  attacking us i'm like oh well you are the enemy i will oppose you but the general public has been
[02:57:33.420 --> 02:57:40.940]  in a laboratory experiment of arrested development and not going through rituals and rites of passage
[02:57:40.940 --> 02:57:46.620]  they've done everything to arrest women and men's development and they only allow you to have rites
[02:57:46.620 --> 02:57:51.660]  of passage if you work in the government or the military or the police or go have a fake
[02:57:51.660 --> 02:57:57.100]  ride of passage at a football game you know the chickens all get to sit there and be in a real war
[02:57:57.100 --> 02:58:01.340]  and a real battle and be real men and cheer for their knights out there on the field instead of
[02:58:01.340 --> 02:58:06.460]  ever being real men and they're literally children i talked to major executives that know how to run
[02:58:06.460 --> 02:58:13.500]  operations but they admit they're children and just don't care and they're happy to be children
[02:58:13.500 --> 02:58:19.980]  that's the other thing they've never had their rites of passage and i realize this this weekend
[02:58:19.980 --> 02:58:25.020]  my son's really smart and really cool and smarter than i am but i've sheltered him too much he needs
[02:58:25.020 --> 02:58:30.780]  the right of passage that's why they're trying to get rid of letting kids fight you know and is
[02:58:30.780 --> 02:58:35.980]  because and and and hardcore sports is they don't want the rites of passage you must have the rites
[02:58:35.980 --> 02:58:42.220]  of passage to activate the ancestral memories
