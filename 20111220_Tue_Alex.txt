[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:32.900]  Texas Alex Jones well you knew the attacks on Ron Paul we're going to kick
[00:32.900 --> 00:37.400]  into high gear now that in Iowa and other states he's in first or second in
[00:37.400 --> 00:42.920]  all the major polls but now the Iowa governor there was public and
[00:42.920 --> 00:48.040]  establishment Rhino big government individual is coming out and saying
[00:48.040 --> 00:55.200]  ignore Iran Paul win and he himself is trying to derail the Iowa caucuses and
[00:55.200 --> 01:00.160]  claiming that it's Ron Paul's fault and saying it's going to be discredited
[01:00.160 --> 01:06.000]  forever now to try to make Iowans hate Ron Paul which I guess means hate
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.720]  themselves because they're supporting him I mean you talk about mind control
[01:10.720 --> 01:17.560]  you talk about selling trendiness and what's in style being a slave being in
[01:17.560 --> 01:22.320]  debt being lied to supporting banker bailouts supporting all these illegal
[01:22.320 --> 01:25.840]  wars supporting the overthrow of the Bill of Rights the Constitution and they
[01:25.840 --> 01:31.280]  always say the troops want more war and of course in every major poll over 70
[01:31.280 --> 01:36.040]  percent are against it and Ron Paul gets over 70 percent of the donations from
[01:36.040 --> 01:40.200]  Democrats and Republicans compared to the other candidates it's the same thing
[01:40.200 --> 01:44.520]  you know the troops love war and want more the troops don't like you but the
[01:44.520 --> 01:50.400]  facts don't show that oh my gosh Ron Paul is discrediting the Iowa caucuses I
[01:50.400 --> 01:54.920]  have the quotes right here oh my goodness this is going to destroy Iowa's
[01:54.920 --> 01:59.360]  importance and you know whose fault it is it's that Ron Paul what they're
[01:59.360 --> 02:04.840]  saying to you in a mind control game is here hold this hand grenade and you're
[02:04.840 --> 02:08.600]  like Wiley coyote I guess when a road owner gives him the hand grenade he's
[02:08.600 --> 02:13.840]  like oh thank you and then sits there and it blows up are we that stupid the
[02:13.840 --> 02:18.520]  globalists are almost out of bullets they're almost out of bullets but and
[02:18.520 --> 02:23.320]  they try to destroy Rand Paul and it backfired but in this case they could
[02:23.320 --> 02:27.080]  have some success on this unless we really expose what they're doing because
[02:27.080 --> 02:32.240]  there's nothing mainline Republicans are more into than going to their fake
[02:32.240 --> 02:36.040]  church and thinking it's the end of the world and ever fighting corruption or
[02:36.040 --> 02:42.480]  tyranny and basically just going with whoever Fox News tells them and they're
[02:42.480 --> 02:46.560]  like Newt Gingrich is for global government open borders and carbon
[02:46.560 --> 02:52.160]  taxes and Obamacare he's the sensible one and you're like but that doesn't
[02:52.160 --> 02:57.560]  make any sense they're like but Fox News says it and if a Republican governor
[02:57.560 --> 03:02.760]  says it you're going to destroy our state's reputation if you vote for Ron
[03:02.760 --> 03:07.680]  Paul he's a bad nasty man for being right all these years about everything and
[03:07.680 --> 03:11.880]  staying the course and always voting the way he said he would and it's just
[03:11.880 --> 03:15.360]  terrible he's gonna win we told you he didn't exist and he was a piece of
[03:15.360 --> 03:20.600]  garbage and everything else but but now just ignore the win and they go on to
[03:20.600 --> 03:26.880]  say Paul poses an existential threat to the state's cherished kickoff status
[03:26.880 --> 03:33.000]  it's his fault he's gonna destroy it and the little specialness of Iowa
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.520]  Republicans and oh don't ruin my little power trip of being a Republican
[03:37.520 --> 03:43.240]  Iowa voter in the caucus well I'll have to vote against him save these
[03:43.240 --> 03:47.480]  Republicans because he has little chance to win the GOP nomination that same
[03:47.480 --> 03:51.320]  mantra he'll never win Iowa he'll never win New Hampshire surging all the
[03:51.320 --> 03:55.720]  polls same thing they tried with Rand I mean the Democrats had people dress up
[03:55.720 --> 04:00.360]  as racist and run around once he got the nomination the Republicans tried some
[04:00.360 --> 04:04.480]  of the same stuff banker bailout you know big big banks just poured money into
[04:04.480 --> 04:09.040]  his competition but they failed because we've passed that flux point that
[04:09.040 --> 04:14.760]  Rubicon at which they're so discredited that if they say something about you
[04:14.760 --> 04:20.000]  horrible people are they have enough basic instinct and common sense to go you
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.920]  mean the lying corrupt system that's been caught lying thousands of times and
[04:24.920 --> 04:29.360]  got us into this mess they're saying he's bad and oh my gosh I better not go
[04:29.360 --> 04:35.680]  there but I mean here's the spectacle it's up at info wars.com prison
[04:35.680 --> 04:39.960]  blinded calm it's up it drudge has the headline Iowa governor ignore Ron Paul

[08:18.880 --> 08:25.760]  day of December 2011 and here are the headlines for Politico and others will
[08:25.760 --> 08:31.080]  Ron Paul kill the Caucasus out dare him run for office in America he's gonna
[08:31.080 --> 08:36.440]  ruin everything so that's the new attack strategy claim that he is just a
[08:36.440 --> 08:40.280]  horrible person trying to influence people and telling them don't throw your
[08:40.280 --> 08:44.480]  vote away don't throw your vote away don't don't discredit Iowa I mean new
[08:44.480 --> 08:50.160]  levels of them trying to invoke trendiness in people and the self-fulfilling
[08:50.160 --> 08:55.760]  prophecy of resistance is futile you can't have Ron Paul but it shows just
[08:55.760 --> 09:00.360]  like with Rand Paul that this is boomeranging back on them so that's
[09:00.360 --> 09:05.760]  coming up here's Politico will Ron Paul kill the Caucasus Iowa governor comes
[09:05.760 --> 09:11.400]  out and it says ignore Ron Paul win ignore our state and says our state is
[09:11.400 --> 09:16.920]  discredited and then blames it on Ron Paul that'd be like going to a party
[09:16.920 --> 09:21.840]  climbing up on top of the table defecating in the punch bowl and then
[09:21.840 --> 09:26.000]  pointing your finger at someone else as everybody knows you just did it and
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.120]  saying he did he pooped in the punch bowl and that's what the Iowa governor's
[09:31.120 --> 09:35.520]  done he's climbed up to the Iowa Caucasus punch bowl which is the most
[09:35.520 --> 09:40.200]  important the kickoff of the election it's the start of everything and Ron
[09:40.200 --> 09:44.400]  Paul's in pole position getting ready a week and a half away from this and if he
[09:44.400 --> 09:53.560]  wins it he's he's he's gonna be half a revolution around the track ahead of the
[09:53.560 --> 09:59.040]  competition the vast majority of the time if you win the Iowa caucus you end
[09:59.040 --> 10:04.680]  up getting the nomination of the party and he is up there saying this
[10:04.680 --> 10:08.600]  discredits our state this discredits everything and it's Ron Paul's fault
[10:08.600 --> 10:13.400]  when it's just a total totally made up as they've always said he can't win and
[10:13.400 --> 10:16.800]  they've always said he isn't going anywhere when he's in first second or
[10:16.800 --> 10:22.200]  third place in every pole in the last six months we've shown you studies
[10:22.200 --> 10:27.840]  scientific studies Pew research breakdowns of that from Texas universities
[10:27.840 --> 10:34.120]  we've had the anthropologist slash sociologist statisticians in we've gone
[10:34.120 --> 10:38.640]  over it Ron Paul gets the shortest amount of time in the debates everything
[10:38.640 --> 10:43.840]  stacked against him but the people know the game is rigged so they want Ron
[10:43.840 --> 10:49.560]  Paul and the system plays this game of saying no you can't have that fish so
[10:49.560 --> 10:52.880]  you take your kids to get fish at the at the pet store and they want some really
[10:52.880 --> 10:57.480]  expensive exotic fish or you know some saltwater fish you're like no that's a
[10:57.480 --> 11:04.200]  saltwater fish we have a freshwater but I want that fish but the issue and they're
[11:04.200 --> 11:09.320]  saying no Ron Paul is a saltwater fish no he's not ladies and gentlemen okay
[11:09.320 --> 11:13.480]  he's the perfect fish for the Republic and they won't let us have him in the
[11:13.480 --> 11:16.520]  fish tank man I'm coming up with some weird analogies on the top of my head
[11:16.520 --> 11:21.360]  here the others are a bunch of dead fish a bunch of dead New World Order sharks
[11:21.360 --> 11:26.480]  with one-way eyes soulless minions who've proven themselves servants of the New
[11:26.480 --> 11:31.520]  World Order I mean look at Mitt Romney wrote Obamacare supports carbon taxes
[11:31.520 --> 11:36.920]  supports amnesty and open borders and then even worse if it's possible
[11:36.920 --> 11:42.240]  Newt Gennrich open a luminous world government into the family end of
[11:42.240 --> 11:50.240]  America New World Order speeches carbon taxes Hillary Care supporting oh yes
[11:50.240 --> 11:55.120]  his own little version of it on and on and on he's loyal opposition to the New
[11:55.120 --> 11:58.440]  World Order that's what he is and I can't even go over all the things
[11:58.440 --> 12:05.040]  Gennrich supports it's mind-blowing and what do we have happening here what do
[12:05.040 --> 12:12.760]  we have going on we have Politico AP Reuters the talk show host all attacking
[12:12.760 --> 12:18.700]  him saying Ron Paul is ruining Iowa and ruining the state's importance and now
[12:18.700 --> 12:23.200]  they're telling the voters that you know what Ron Paul is ruining our state
[12:23.200 --> 12:28.000]  is the kickoff he's discrediting us as the fact that whoever wins Iowa
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.200]  normally wins the nomination except in what two cases the last hundred years
[12:32.200 --> 12:38.680]  or more and I tell you it's just terrible what he did and Ron Paul sitting
[12:38.680 --> 12:43.320]  there a man of honor a man of integrity saying the same thing 30 years ago that
[12:43.320 --> 12:47.240]  he said today although we're putting a video together showing that in speech
[12:47.240 --> 12:51.040]  as he gave TV appearances interviews he did right here in Austin Texas on
[12:51.040 --> 12:56.760]  Access TV in 1988 about drug prohibition government drug dealing New
[12:56.760 --> 13:04.560]  World Order government engineering AIDS virus we've got it all dug up I mean
[13:04.560 --> 13:09.520]  Alex Jones that's what he is is a medical doctor veteran only guy on the
[13:09.520 --> 13:13.360]  congressional baseball team never knock a home run the list goes on and on just
[13:13.360 --> 13:20.560]  a great all-around family man and he is the prototype of Alex Jones and I got
[13:20.560 --> 13:24.240]  to say the prototypes better than the modern thing isn't he so the point is
[13:24.240 --> 13:29.480]  but we all do the best we can is that they are scared to death of him he they
[13:29.480 --> 13:35.560]  are scared to death of him and they do not know what to do and so they're
[13:35.560 --> 13:41.720]  playing this mind game this this insulting game it's like when I saw those
[13:41.720 --> 13:46.040]  news articles in the last few days Bloomberg weekly standard all attacking
[13:46.040 --> 13:51.760]  the fact that Alex Jones is a supporter of Ron Paul and Ron Paul will not
[13:51.760 --> 13:57.240]  disavow him and goes on his radio show and for good reason Ron Paul warns of
[13:57.240 --> 14:03.040]  military to be on the streets and so does Jones they are unstable and insane
[14:03.040 --> 14:07.960]  just vicious attacks that's just a few of them and then meanwhile in the very
[14:07.960 --> 14:11.600]  same publications there's articles about well they have gotten rid of posse
[14:11.600 --> 14:14.520]  common taught us and we'll be putting trips on the streets and citizens can
[14:14.520 --> 14:18.720]  be secretly arrested and disappear but it's all for our security meanwhile these
[14:18.720 --> 14:26.400]  men are insane Ron Paul is insane he says that the government brings in
[14:26.400 --> 14:31.360]  narcotics and then Bloomberg linked to Ron Paul giving a speech about it and an
[14:31.360 --> 14:37.920]  article we wrote it's almost like they're patriots or something and are
[14:37.920 --> 14:41.680]  like publishing this stuff thinking their masters won't realize because I know
[14:41.680 --> 14:44.800]  this has happened in some cases I've been told by the scenes that actually
[14:44.800 --> 14:48.080]  when they then link to us people go and see the truth because every comment on
[14:48.080 --> 14:52.360]  the Bloomberg article every comment of hundreds and I read through most of them
[14:52.360 --> 14:56.360]  I couldn't believe it at like 5 a.m. this morning when I woke up hundreds and
[14:56.360 --> 15:00.160]  hundreds of comments we're all seeing right through them because they the
[15:00.160 --> 15:04.960]  the Bloomberg article attacking myself and Ron Paul linked to a data page with
[15:04.960 --> 15:08.440]  all the congressional c-span hearings admitting government drug dealing and
[15:08.440 --> 15:13.280]  the aircraft crashing Reuters full of cocaine the CIA and the CIA being caught
[15:13.280 --> 15:18.640]  over and over again and all the reports and everything Ron Paul's talking about
[15:18.640 --> 15:24.200]  I mean Ron Paul is talking about admitted things that came out in the 60s 70s 80s
[15:24.200 --> 15:31.600]  90s and right through to today and it's so ham-fisted when the system attacks us
[15:31.600 --> 15:36.760]  that you're like do they really think people are buying this Ron Paul believes
[15:36.760 --> 15:41.120]  the military is being trained to deploy America this is the type of unstable
[15:41.120 --> 15:44.560]  craziness that we deal with and that's why it's good that they're gonna try to
[15:44.560 --> 15:49.240]  bar him from some of the future Republican debates because this man is
[15:49.240 --> 15:55.320]  absolutely dangerous and then they link to info wars com with just links
[15:55.320 --> 16:04.120]  everywhere to mainstream news admitting it so now they're trying this new game
[16:04.120 --> 16:10.000]  which is a twist on the old game of saying Ron Paul we're all very prideful
[16:10.000 --> 16:16.160]  in Iowa or a hundred plus years the nation has looked to Iowa first as a
[16:16.160 --> 16:22.240]  bellwether as who was gonna have the starting position and who was favored
[16:22.240 --> 16:27.080]  to win and in 80 plus percent of the time that person has gotten the
[16:27.080 --> 16:31.600]  presidential nomination against the incumbent presidential candidate but
[16:31.600 --> 16:36.520]  not anymore I was discredited but wait it's worse it's worse in fact I have the
[16:36.520 --> 16:42.440]  articles right here it's worse it will discredit all of the primaries because
[16:42.440 --> 16:48.560]  he might win those two it'd be like if a boxer got in the ram is that he can
[16:48.560 --> 16:51.880]  never win he's the underdog and he gets up there and in two or three rounds and
[16:51.880 --> 16:55.920]  ox the other guy out there like well that discredits this fighter that
[16:55.920 --> 17:05.280]  discredits his this entire arena and this entire boxing system it'd be like
[17:05.280 --> 17:09.080]  of a team on the Super Bowl and they said well this discredits the NFL forever
[17:09.080 --> 17:15.240]  that dirty team that won the Super Bowl they've discredited everything coming
[17:15.240 --> 17:19.640]  from behind and winning something must be wrong I mean this is the mind game and
[17:19.640 --> 17:23.400]  so Iowans are like oh my gosh it's all over talk radio all of the news it's
[17:23.400 --> 17:27.520]  the talking point don't vote for Ron Paul because if he wins it discredits
[17:27.520 --> 17:33.120]  Iowa and our pride don't do it to be trendy vote for a good globalist Mitt
[17:33.120 --> 17:40.200]  Romney Newt Gingrich all the other candidates have fallen because people
[17:40.200 --> 17:44.160]  learn who they are Ron Paul everybody knows who he is and so the establishment
[17:44.160 --> 17:49.000]  Republicans that vote for the bailouts and the open borders and everything else
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.160]  all this garbage who voted for the TSA to grab your wife's breast and stick
[17:53.160 --> 17:57.920]  their hand down your pants and put you in microwave ovens these globalist
[17:57.920 --> 18:03.240]  traders bought and paid for for chicken feed think that we're so weak minded and
[18:03.240 --> 18:07.680]  think Iowans are so weak minded I mean listen to this will Ron Paul kill the
[18:07.680 --> 18:15.240]  caucuses Politico well I tell you Gary Allen a true Patriots son started
[18:15.240 --> 18:19.680]  Politico Gary Allen who wrote Nunder called conspiracy and he is in friends
[18:19.680 --> 18:26.040]  with Ron Paul they've got to be ashamed of what of looking down from heaven what
[18:26.040 --> 18:30.720]  his son has done with Politico it is such a nasty establishment rag it makes
[18:30.720 --> 18:33.960]  me want to throw up I know there's a few good reporters there that I've talked to
[18:33.960 --> 18:38.520]  off record but their their Ron Paul savaging is is just
[18:38.520 --> 18:43.720]  disgusting the alarms are sounding in Iowa conservatives
[18:43.720 --> 18:50.080]  yes you mean Rhino globalist and Republican elites in the state are
[18:50.080 --> 18:54.640]  divided over who to support for the GOP nomination but they almost uniformly
[18:54.640 --> 18:58.320]  expressed concern over the prospect that Ron Paul and his army of activist
[18:58.320 --> 19:02.440]  supporters may capture the state's only 12 nomination contest an outcome many
[19:02.440 --> 19:07.360]  fear would do a reputable harm to the future role of the first in the nation
[19:07.360 --> 19:13.040]  caucuses the spin rooms the bar rooms the online forums but what to do about
[19:13.040 --> 19:18.520]  Ron Paul conversation has become pervasive as Paul show him on or near the
[19:18.520 --> 19:24.520]  top just weeks before the January 3rd vote Paul poses an existential threat to
[19:24.520 --> 19:31.160]  the state's cherished kickoff status oh he look what he did in the punch bowl he
[19:31.160 --> 19:38.640]  went out and fought with ideas and is winning it's so horrible oh my gosh say
[19:38.640 --> 19:42.240]  these Republicans because he has little chance to win again that mind control I
[19:42.240 --> 19:46.200]  again it normally he'd be when they say well that's the leader of nomination but
[19:46.200 --> 19:50.640]  no he can't win he's ruining it so they go on to say Iowa will never be the same
[19:50.640 --> 19:56.920]  it'll be hated no Iowa will be known as projecting Ron Paul into the number one

[24:33.800 --> 24:38.360]  of Iowa like their children oh don't vote for that Ron Paul you know you'll be
[24:38.360 --> 24:43.040]  discredited oh my gosh that Ron Paul wrote that AIDS might have been
[24:43.040 --> 24:46.400]  manufactured to kill black people and you know why he wrote that in his
[24:46.400 --> 24:51.800]  newsletter it's because he doesn't like black people yes and Ron you his son
[24:51.800 --> 24:56.520]  worships aqua Buddha and kidnaps women of course all of that proven wrong having
[24:56.520 --> 24:59.840]  people dress up like hay seeds in Kentucky from the Democratic challenger
[24:59.840 --> 25:08.440]  and running around saying racist things and I've already seen headlines Ron Paul
[25:08.440 --> 25:14.040]  supporter calls black people monkeys I saw that as a national news headline
[25:14.040 --> 25:20.160]  yesterday so you can just go out into the street and randomly find some crazy
[25:20.160 --> 25:27.240]  person and I guess have them say a crazy person say Obama wants to eat white
[25:27.240 --> 25:32.400]  babies and if a crazy person says it oh Obama's guilty because the guy said you
[25:32.400 --> 25:36.760]  know that Obama should eat white babies I mean this is the biggest guilt by
[25:36.760 --> 25:41.560]  association crud that I've ever seen but that's not working so now they're
[25:41.560 --> 25:47.160]  going into oh my gosh I mean think about on the surface of it how asinine it is
[25:47.160 --> 25:52.640]  to have the governor come out and say our caucuses are discredited and Iowa is
[25:52.640 --> 25:59.600]  going to lose its place as the most important you know political kickoff
[25:59.600 --> 26:09.960]  point in the United States a central central pillar of the political system
[26:09.960 --> 26:17.680]  in this country he's saying that to terrorize the political process and to
[26:17.680 --> 26:24.120]  engage in dirty tricks he is introducing that idea and trying to violate
[26:24.120 --> 26:29.160]  and listen to me carefully our Republican form of government trying to
[26:29.160 --> 26:33.880]  tamper with the election with an incredibly dirty trick in fact get me
[26:33.880 --> 26:36.640]  Paul Watson on the line I know Lord mocked it's coming up I want to get
[26:36.640 --> 26:40.000]  Watson on the line right now and and the work or and then I could talk to Kurt
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.040]  Nemo Aaron Dykes Steve all of me to get on this because looking at this it this
[26:45.040 --> 26:51.680]  really is sabotage and wait it gets worse the anonymous group which is
[26:51.680 --> 26:56.480]  whoever the government wants to say they are it's just a honeypot to set people
[26:56.480 --> 27:01.400]  up anonymous says that they're gonna attack the caucuses and then gives no
[27:01.400 --> 27:08.840]  reason why and now the FBI has to come in and oversee the tallying there at the
[27:08.840 --> 27:12.840]  different caucuses as they added up because it's an old-fashioned voice
[27:12.840 --> 27:17.360]  vote but they'll tabulate that and the government will oversee I guess the
[27:17.360 --> 27:23.640]  computer the calculator where they added up oh because that because the cutout
[27:23.640 --> 27:28.100]  group anonymous which is a domestic you know term like al-Qaeda is this fake
[27:28.100 --> 27:32.280]  Muslim cutout that they can you know use as a sock puppet to menace people and
[27:32.280 --> 27:40.320]  take their liberties now oh my gosh the GOP is so concerned AP reports Iowa GOP
[27:40.320 --> 27:46.240]  worried by hacker threat to caucus vote and now because they've associated
[27:46.240 --> 27:50.800]  anonymous with all these good causes and there's good people involved in it who
[27:50.800 --> 27:55.080]  took the bait just like Occupy Wall Street is just this blanket cutout where
[27:55.080 --> 28:00.240]  they can then project the establishment can whatever they want on to anybody
[28:00.240 --> 28:04.520]  that's part of that diverse group who arrives can't they say well arrive at
[28:04.520 --> 28:10.440]  this street corner if you want to you'll fight for liberty and freedom and then
[28:10.440 --> 28:13.200]  the government's waiting there to do something horrible and blaming on you
[28:13.200 --> 28:17.520]  when you show up that's basically what these anonymous cutouts are that's what
[28:17.520 --> 28:21.120]  so dangerous about them that's why you put your John Hancock on the
[28:21.120 --> 28:25.440]  Declaration of Independence and be public never run around in the dark in a
[28:25.440 --> 28:29.120]  militia with people saying we're doing stuff that's illegal we might have to
[28:29.120 --> 28:33.080]  get ready for war with the government that's a fed you're being led by a fed
[28:33.080 --> 28:36.600]  who's trying to see if he can trick you to do something or just get enough fake
[28:36.600 --> 28:40.920]  evidence on you to put you on the news if you want to train as a militia
[28:40.920 --> 28:47.000]  secretly to defend the Republic that's one thing but but it needs to be people
[28:47.000 --> 28:52.160]  you know and trust as Ron Paul said his newsletters a long time ago and then you
[28:52.160 --> 28:56.520]  don't talk about offensive action as Ron Paul said never shoot first defend
[28:56.520 --> 29:01.600]  your family but if you want to be a public organization that's above board
[29:01.600 --> 29:07.040]  and has soup kitchens for people and wears urban camo a suit and tie that's
[29:07.040 --> 29:11.600]  the way to go and tell people train for military readiness to fight criminals
[29:11.600 --> 29:16.040]  tyrants the government says get ready for the border to collapse and 30
[29:16.040 --> 29:19.320]  million more illegals to pour in they're getting FEMA camps ready as if the
[29:19.320 --> 29:25.280]  government can do that it's the old posse system that's what we need civil
[29:25.280 --> 29:29.840]  defense and civil defense is above board and good and wholesome they got rid of
[29:29.840 --> 29:33.520]  civil defense because they don't like the idea of the citizens working with the
[29:33.520 --> 29:38.240]  legitimate government they want to have a mercenary globalist far in takeover of
[29:38.240 --> 29:42.600]  this country and let me tell you it's up to us to get the word out on what this
[29:42.600 --> 29:46.840]  Iowa governor's doing trying to discredit our electoral process and then
[29:46.840 --> 29:52.400]  blame it on Ron Paul in a false flag we're on the march the empires on the

[33:54.920 --> 33:59.320]  regulations are has said Cass Sunstein those of us that do not believe in
[33:59.320 --> 34:03.800]  anthropogenic global warming man may global warming but they've simply moved
[34:03.800 --> 34:09.720]  to a new weapons system because that that propaganda has been discredited to
[34:09.720 --> 34:14.720]  any climate change being abnormal and the only thing that is normal is change
[34:14.720 --> 34:19.400]  and a constant state of it and have shifted to sustainable development smart
[34:19.400 --> 34:23.760]  growth that was always the next phase and here in Austin it's selective
[34:23.760 --> 34:31.760]  enforcement the when you leave as a former mayor here you then literally
[34:31.760 --> 34:37.000]  take over private banks that control the land you stole here in Austin Texas
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.920]  they've taken more than 50,000 acres of people's property on average five years
[34:40.920 --> 34:44.120]  after stealing it in an environmental land grab because they can't get it
[34:44.120 --> 34:47.640]  federally they just do it locally and that's what sports in anger said two
[34:47.640 --> 34:51.560]  years ago Copenhagen he said we'll just go to the governors and the mayors and
[34:51.560 --> 34:56.040]  county commissioners and they come in they seize the land farms ranches the
[34:56.040 --> 35:01.680]  development zones and then have their environmental boards remove the
[35:01.680 --> 35:06.520]  restrictions after it's in government trust and then it's sold to them
[35:06.520 --> 35:11.440]  publicly I mean this is crime out in the open well it's what the Chinese are
[35:11.440 --> 35:15.120]  revolting against and taking over major towns and cities in China over the
[35:15.120 --> 35:19.640]  communist party taking property and then later giving it to themselves I mean it
[35:19.640 --> 35:24.720]  is just brazen criminality they look 99% of the people at the mid and high
[35:24.720 --> 35:29.100]  levels of environmentalism are just wicked control freaks who are stealing
[35:29.100 --> 35:32.840]  property I've been to smart growth conferences I've talked to them and I'll
[35:32.840 --> 35:35.760]  say I know you're just doing to get property and when the cameras off they'll
[35:35.760 --> 35:38.840]  look at me see you bet it is and you're not gonna stop us don't get out of my
[35:38.840 --> 35:42.440]  way I mean these are hard and then they'll be in for the news like oh I'm so
[35:42.440 --> 35:46.600]  liberal oh it's for the earth but behind the scenes are like shut up Jones I
[35:46.600 --> 35:53.440]  mean they're just nasty nasty people and when you see them laughing at you and
[35:53.440 --> 35:56.160]  I've been in elevators with them before I've been at restaurants when they walk
[35:56.160 --> 36:00.200]  over in front of people and say how's it going Jones you're not gonna stop us
[36:00.200 --> 36:03.800]  it's normal to have a government that decides on development and control
[36:03.800 --> 36:08.960]  society and that's the way it is these are I mean Lord Monk has been beat up by
[36:08.960 --> 36:15.440]  police before on video I mean this is what they do I video later of in
[36:15.440 --> 36:19.440]  California and other areas people try to speak politely at city council now and
[36:19.440 --> 36:23.200]  are being arrested or threatened with arrest if they criticize government
[36:23.200 --> 36:30.480]  anyway they say that is not allowed police sees them so it's happening but
[36:30.480 --> 36:33.080]  after we talk about this and get a quick update from our monster I'm gonna get
[36:33.080 --> 36:36.840]  his take because he's also run for high office he's been in the highest levels
[36:36.840 --> 36:40.320]  top advisor to Margaret Thatcher award-winning journalist in his own
[36:40.320 --> 36:46.760]  right but you know he stood for high office in in Scotland and they just
[36:46.760 --> 36:50.560]  totally ignored him there and they've done that blackout with Ron Paul but it
[36:50.560 --> 36:56.280]  hasn't worked and so now they're saying if you if you let him win Iowa you have
[36:56.280 --> 37:01.600]  discredited the electoral process which is an attack on the election system and
[37:01.600 --> 37:04.960]  I've got a report coming out very soon on that's we'll get his take on that but I
[37:04.960 --> 37:10.360]  saw a Fox News article that was basically telling us a week later what
[37:10.360 --> 37:15.360]  Moncton itself is going to happen at Rio coming up here they are openly saying
[37:15.360 --> 37:19.840]  and they admit here they will take over development manufacturing everything
[37:19.840 --> 37:24.880]  through the rubric of sustainable development which the EPA says in
[37:24.880 --> 37:28.880]  documents allows them the power to do anything they're not going to try to
[37:28.880 --> 37:32.880]  argue fake science now they're just going to say for the earth or for the
[37:32.880 --> 37:38.120]  trees you can't build in here in Austin number one Lord Moncton they will now the
[37:38.120 --> 37:45.240]  tree is bigger than 10 inches around up to 15 to 20 of different variants and you
[37:45.240 --> 37:49.200]  go to them for the voodoo they won't let them build 10 15 20 30 40 story
[37:49.200 --> 37:52.600]  high rises which actually if you believe there's no room are quote sustainable
[37:52.600 --> 37:57.160]  unless you're an insider now if you pony up and pay them off and give their wives
[37:57.160 --> 38:01.600]  jobs they're just open crooks then you can cut down whatever you want but if
[38:01.600 --> 38:07.640]  you've got ugly haggard trees and you're offering to plant trees on the roof
[38:07.640 --> 38:13.920]  doesn't matter they say no unless you bow to them and pay them whatever they
[38:13.920 --> 38:16.200]  want and then if they've got a better offer you're not going to get it
[38:16.200 --> 38:19.480]  anyways just like General Electric can build all the new power plants they
[38:19.480 --> 38:22.840]  want everybody else is being shut down so General Electric comes and says you're
[38:22.840 --> 38:26.560]  going to be shut down in one month sell dust for nothing and people are like
[38:26.560 --> 38:30.640]  here's the power plant and the prices are doubling they're laughing they are a
[38:30.640 --> 38:35.240]  criminal mafia now I know I'm ranting here because this is a time to rant this
[38:35.240 --> 38:40.480]  is brazen authoritarianism but they aren't dressed up in a Hitler outfit so
[38:40.480 --> 38:47.920]  people don't recognize it these are conscious demons Lord Moncton joins us
[38:47.920 --> 38:52.240]  he is the British politician public speaker former newspaper editor and a
[38:52.240 --> 38:56.080]  redditary peer formerly a member of the Conservative Party Moncton has been the
[38:56.080 --> 39:01.640]  head of the policy unit for UK Independence Party and goes on there and I
[39:01.640 --> 39:04.640]  just can't break down his entire he was the head of but the policy unit number
[39:04.640 --> 39:08.600]  10 Downing Street he also worked for the universe the Sunday Telegraph today on
[39:08.600 --> 39:13.000]  the evening standard and UKIP.org or Science and Public Policy.org sir I'm
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.800]  ranting and I appreciate you joining us and giving us your time it's just to see
[39:16.800 --> 39:20.760]  them engaging in these crimes it's becoming outrageous and now that you
[39:20.760 --> 39:23.920]  and others have exposed them they're upping the ante and declaring total
[39:23.920 --> 39:27.560]  power over everything and they say they don't care what Congress or Parliament
[39:27.560 --> 39:34.960]  does they rule well of course in the end in a democracy like America where no
[39:34.960 --> 39:41.080]  legislative power is supposed to go anywhere except Congress Congress can
[39:41.080 --> 39:47.320]  take that power back it can say to the EPA enough is enough no more missing
[39:47.320 --> 39:51.800]  about if you want to exercise this kind of authority you have to have a statute
[39:51.800 --> 39:56.080]  to do that you haven't got one and we're shutting you down and actually now the
[39:56.080 --> 40:00.280]  EPA probably does more harm than good and it should actually be abolished it's
[40:00.280 --> 40:06.320]  no longer a useful organization and what is happening the mistake they've made
[40:06.320 --> 40:11.640]  is that they have tried to politicize science itself I've said this before but
[40:11.640 --> 40:18.280]  it bears saying again science is a search for objective truth it can't be
[40:18.280 --> 40:22.880]  politicized you can pretend to politicize it for a time but in the end
[40:22.880 --> 40:29.000]  the truth pokes through one of my favorite examples of this is when Hitler
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.920]  didn't like the fact that Einstein a Jew had invented the theory of relativity
[40:34.920 --> 40:42.040]  and so he got a hundred scientists loyal to the regime of the consensus let's
[40:42.040 --> 40:47.240]  call them to produce a book which was called a hundred scientists against
[40:47.240 --> 40:51.000]  Einstein and Einstein who had had the sense to leave Germany by then it was
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.760]  safely in the United States was asked by the press what he thought about this
[40:54.760 --> 41:00.760]  and he said gentlemen it's really very simple if I am wrong it will only take
[41:00.760 --> 41:06.000]  a single paper by one scientist to demonstrate that doesn't matter how
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.720]  many scientists you line up in a row that's not how science is done he said
[41:10.720 --> 41:14.720]  and of course that's exactly the position wherein now you have the
[41:14.720 --> 41:21.200]  scientists lining up with the state the authorities the EPA saying the climate
[41:21.200 --> 41:24.160]  is all terrible it's all gloom and doom we're going to set the world on fire
[41:24.160 --> 41:30.800]  publicly on the payroll publicly on the payroll but they're being caught out
[41:30.800 --> 41:34.720]  because it isn't happening remember that famous climategate email from the
[41:34.720 --> 41:38.560]  original batch of emails this one by Kevin Trenberth who's right at the heart
[41:38.560 --> 41:42.600]  of the scare one of the people that is perpetrating what I increasingly think
[41:42.600 --> 41:49.200]  is looking rather like fraud and what he said privately in his email to his
[41:49.200 --> 41:55.120]  colleagues was there has been no global warming for a decade we cannot explain
[41:55.120 --> 41:59.880]  why it is a travesty that we can't that's what they're saying to each other
[41:59.880 --> 42:04.440]  privately they know that this has all gone wrong they know their sums are
[42:04.440 --> 42:10.000]  incorrect and they simply can't bear to let go breaking news I often do this on
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.920]  your show I now have access to the first three major chapters that are being
[42:14.920 --> 42:20.440]  written for the next IPCC quinquennial assessment report do out in somewhere
[42:20.440 --> 42:23.680]  towards the end of next year or the beginning of the year after that and
[42:23.680 --> 42:29.400]  yet again they're trying to pretend that the amount of global warming we can
[42:29.400 --> 42:33.080]  expect to get if we double the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by the end of
[42:33.080 --> 42:36.760]  this century which we will whatever they try to do about it they're trying to say
[42:36.760 --> 42:42.760]  that will cause three or four or even five Celsius of warming kind of seven
[42:42.760 --> 42:49.560]  eight nine ten Fahrenheit well the answer is no it won't it'll cause at most
[42:49.560 --> 42:54.880]  half of that probably more like a third of that but they're still desperately
[42:54.880 --> 42:59.960]  clinging by their fingernails to this bogus story even though it's now quite
[42:59.960 --> 43:04.880]  clear that the climate isn't responding in the way they predicted and let me give
[43:04.880 --> 43:10.520]  you a little vignette from Durban which illustrates how cheesily they're trying
[43:10.520 --> 43:14.840]  to cheat on the data and they're succeeding in fooling your average
[43:14.840 --> 43:19.520]  politician who knows absolutely no science I ran into in the corridors
[43:19.520 --> 43:23.600]  there the secretary general of the world meteorological organization a guy
[43:23.600 --> 43:28.280]  called Michel Jarreau and I said to him I've just heard you interviewed and you
[43:28.280 --> 43:32.760]  were saying that the science is solid this is the new speak for the sciences
[43:32.760 --> 43:36.480]  settled they're now saying the science is solid and I said but on the question of
[43:36.480 --> 43:40.920]  what's called climate sensitivity how much man-made global warming are we
[43:40.920 --> 43:45.000]  going to get question I said the science is very far from solid it's
[43:45.000 --> 43:50.040]  becoming quite evident now that we've had no global warming for a decade the
[43:50.040 --> 43:54.320]  numbers are just not coming out the way you said they would and the fact is
[43:54.320 --> 43:58.200]  there are very good reasons in the peer-reviewed literature why we now know
[43:58.200 --> 44:03.320]  it's not going to warm at the rate which the IPCC is trying to pedal and upon
[44:03.320 --> 44:07.760]  which the entire scare rests and he said oh well the trouble with you is he said
[44:07.760 --> 44:12.400]  you date all your graphs from 1998 when there was a big spike in global warming
[44:12.400 --> 44:18.480]  because of a natural event the El Nino of that year and I said no I don't don't
[44:18.480 --> 44:23.040]  try to change the subject stick to the point he said well you have to go back
[44:23.040 --> 44:29.720]  not 10 years but 30 years and I said no you don't you have to go back 60 years
[44:29.720 --> 44:36.080]  so as to cancel out both the warming and the cooling phase of the great ocean
[44:36.080 --> 44:41.120]  oscillations a 60 year cycle in the climate and if you go back only 30 years
[44:41.120 --> 44:45.760]  you're capturing only the warming half and then you say that's all man-made
[44:45.760 --> 44:51.640]  warming no it isn't a lot of its natural you have to go back 60 years and he was
[44:51.640 --> 44:56.440]  furious that I knew that and he said I'm not going to stand around listening to
[44:56.440 --> 44:59.760]  lectures from you I said well I've made a very simple point I've said what I want
[44:59.760 --> 45:03.760]  to say what do you want to say well he didn't really want to say anything very
[45:03.760 --> 45:09.880]  much he was furious that he'd been caught out in this very devious way of
[45:09.880 --> 45:15.120]  trying to present things to say you have to go back to say 1976 that's when the
[45:15.120 --> 45:20.960]  natural warming from the Pacific decadal oscillation began and it ended in
[45:20.960 --> 45:24.680]  2001 let me stop you Lord Moncton you always get into science with these
[45:24.680 --> 45:29.600]  people but you know from the club of Rome and the rest of it that the UN set up
[45:29.600 --> 45:34.320]  it's about power grabs and population reduction and of course he didn't want
[45:34.320 --> 45:38.640]  to talk to you because he knows I'm telling you I obviously you've attacked
[45:38.640 --> 45:42.200]  them on the science and that's good because they wear this laurel of paid
[45:42.200 --> 45:46.680]  off scientists and say oh peer reviewed but at the end of the day it's about a
[45:46.680 --> 45:52.200]  power grab I'm telling you in Austin you don't build anything unless they say I
[45:52.200 --> 45:57.720]  live under a supreme Soviet nonsense though is to fight them on the science
[45:57.720 --> 46:03.160]  and on the economics these are the two battlegrounds where they do not have
[46:03.160 --> 46:07.160]  control because the facts are not no I understand that so let me ask you this
[46:07.160 --> 46:10.880]  let me ask you this then let me ask you this what about the big announcement
[46:10.880 --> 46:14.120]  then you've gotten the internal documents you know what's going to be in
[46:14.120 --> 46:17.680]  this new Rio thing coming up Fox News says they've got some of the same
[46:17.680 --> 46:23.080]  information and and and are reporting that the EPA rather than back off is
[46:23.080 --> 46:27.720]  planning to just start shutting everything down well that of course is
[46:27.720 --> 46:32.480]  what the EPA will do while Obama is still in the White House and at least in
[46:32.480 --> 46:36.160]  America you can do something about that you can vote out your leaders and vote
[46:36.160 --> 46:40.240]  in a new one we can't do that here in the UK because our leaders are the
[46:40.240 --> 46:44.320]  unelected commissars of the European dictatorship we have no control over
[46:44.320 --> 46:49.280]  them whatsoever and they have just made a complete mess of the whole of Europe's
[46:49.280 --> 46:53.000]  finances that's now washing over into the rest of the world and you heard it
[46:53.000 --> 47:00.760]  here first Greece will go into formal hard default on March the 12th so if you
[47:00.760 --> 47:04.640]  want to short the euro make yourself a little money from mid-February onwards
[47:04.640 --> 47:11.000]  that would be a good thing to do these people their arrogance has long surpassed
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.920]  their abilities and not only on financial matters but also on climate
[47:15.920 --> 47:20.840]  matters these people don't know what they're doing and they're trying to grab
[47:20.840 --> 47:25.480]  more and more power because otherwise people will find out and sack them well
[47:25.480 --> 47:29.480]  the time is now coming where it's becoming blindingly obvious as far as the
[47:29.480 --> 47:34.440]  climate is concerned that we do not have a problem on anything like the
[47:34.440 --> 47:38.200]  scale they've been trying to pretend it's quite quite clear that climate
[47:38.200 --> 47:42.840]  simply isn't changing fast enough anything like fast enough to match their
[47:42.840 --> 47:47.560]  original yes sir Lord Monkton I mean I mean respectfully obviously you've done
[47:47.560 --> 47:50.960]  more than anybody to fight them and expose them I agree with you facing them
[47:50.960 --> 47:55.000]  on the science but I'm saying they then they just make up new lies then we've
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.880]  got to expose those and clear that they're discredited my point is the
[47:59.880 --> 48:05.360]  mafioso nature of government insider shutting down coal plants in Europe in
[48:05.360 --> 48:09.600]  the United States that aren't part of the inside club I think that point is
[48:09.600 --> 48:14.720]  particularly devastating the proof that this is just a mafia demanding
[48:14.720 --> 48:19.520]  environmental protection money if you want the ability to engage in any human
[48:19.520 --> 48:25.560]  activity the statements by this UN coterie of villainous vermin openly
[48:25.560 --> 48:31.000]  stating they want a post-industrial world these are just just just they are
[48:31.000 --> 48:37.680]  unspeakably wicked and they're dangerous but the way to deal with them is to
[48:37.680 --> 48:42.320]  meet them head-to-head on the facts and that's what I've been very quiet it is
[48:42.320 --> 48:45.480]  why they're so angry with me you know you Google Monkton you see these hate
[48:45.480 --> 48:49.880]  this hate mail from all over the world generated by these people to try to
[48:49.880 --> 48:53.800]  destroy the reputations of anyone who dares to argue with them but I'm still
[48:53.800 --> 48:59.800]  here and the reason is that they know that in the end on the science I am
[48:59.800 --> 49:03.920]  trying to get it right while they are trying to get it wrong but they are
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.280]  conscious authoritarian I'm more likely to get it right because at least I'm
[49:08.280 --> 49:11.560]  trying to sure but I mean they are from your research conscious
[49:11.560 --> 49:17.160]  authoritarians oh of course they are these are people who would like is the
[49:17.160 --> 49:21.360]  old phrase from the comic books world domination you know they're like the
[49:21.360 --> 49:25.920]  meekon in the dandere comics and we remember those who wanted world
[49:25.920 --> 49:30.440]  domination of course they do they are comic strip characters and they would
[49:30.440 --> 49:36.480]  love to take the world over using the environment as sort of green fig leaf to
[49:36.480 --> 49:41.280]  hide behind but in the end this is failing this is the great thing Alex
[49:41.280 --> 49:45.400]  it's failing it's failing because they dared to try to politicize science and
[49:45.400 --> 49:51.880]  the economics to for that matter it's actually 20 to 100 times cheaper to sit
[49:51.880 --> 49:57.560]  back enjoy the sunshine and do nothing than it is to try to do anything at all
[49:57.560 --> 50:02.640]  to try to make global warming go away it really is cheaper just to leave it alone
[50:02.640 --> 50:06.720]  and people are beginning to work this out the scientific literature in the
[50:06.720 --> 50:11.200]  economic journals is near unanimous in saying there's no point in spending any
[50:11.200 --> 50:14.840]  money on trying to make global warming go away just money down the drain if you
[50:14.840 --> 50:20.000]  do and gradually even the dimmest politicians are beginning to realize
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.400]  that this is just a waste of money at a time when there isn't a lot of money in
[50:24.400 --> 50:27.920]  the kitty to waste you know you've got America going bust Britain going bust
[50:27.920 --> 50:34.040]  Europe going bust because of extravagant overspending by exactly this class and
[50:34.040 --> 50:38.920]  environmental policies shutting down our industry which is all of that it all
[50:38.920 --> 50:42.560]  contributes to the loss of tax revenue which makes the government's figures a
[50:42.560 --> 50:47.040]  great deal worse so in the end some very hard choices are going to have to be
[50:47.040 --> 50:51.360]  made quite soon by the electorate and they're going to have to say do we want
[50:51.360 --> 50:55.840]  to vote in a party which buys all this environment just stay there sir tell us

[54:15.120 --> 54:18.960]  hoppy heidelberg the head of the federal grand jury who discovered that it
[54:18.960 --> 54:24.600]  was a inside job to blame conservatives and libertarians for the terror attack
[54:24.600 --> 54:29.360]  he's going to be joining us talking about the new film a noble lie which is
[54:29.360 --> 54:33.560]  the only really professionally produced film on the subject of Oklahoma City
[54:33.560 --> 54:39.560]  available at info wars dot com by the way sold out everywhere else we've got
[54:39.560 --> 54:44.560]  them stockpile to get them out to people and also on top of it you can get the
[54:44.560 --> 54:51.120]  everything special all 18 of my films 70 plus percent off 99 95 normally 300

[54:57.200 --> 55:01.000]  areas you can't but regardless it's a great gift of freedom gift of truth and
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.880]  it financially supports our operation that undoubtedly is at the tip of the
[55:04.880 --> 55:08.920]  spear fighting the globalist now going back to Lord Christopher Monkton who's
[55:08.920 --> 55:12.360]  they had a public policy at the UK Independence Party the fastest growing
[55:12.360 --> 55:18.200]  party in the UK because they oppose globalist tyranny England has over 70
[55:18.200 --> 55:21.440]  percent of its laws made by unelected bureaucrats now the bureaucrats are
[55:21.440 --> 55:25.320]  saying to Europe you're going to give up whatever rights you had and give it to us
[55:25.320 --> 55:29.400]  through the fraud the banksters have induced but something happened James
[55:29.400 --> 55:33.960]  Cameron who said he won't let the British people or the people of the UK
[55:33.960 --> 55:40.720]  vote on on getting out of the euro he's now suddenly voting on euro power grab
[55:40.720 --> 55:47.320]  so what's happening Lord Monkton very very interesting this is the influence
[55:47.320 --> 55:53.320]  of the United Kingdom Independence Party because 83 of David Cameron's back
[55:53.320 --> 55:58.280]  benches rebelled against him in a vote on Europe a few weeks ago in the House of
[55:58.280 --> 56:05.200]  Commons and he began to realize that he is out of touch with his party on this
[56:05.200 --> 56:09.680]  issue and if he stayed out of touch with it until the next election and UKIP is
[56:09.680 --> 56:15.880]  still there standing against him then we will take enough votes from his right
[56:15.880 --> 56:20.800]  wing if you like to make sure that he cannot ever win a general election with
[56:20.800 --> 56:24.160]  an overall majority couldn't do it last time because we took enough votes away
[56:24.160 --> 56:29.000]  from him the same will happen still more so this time now that everybody can see
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.680]  that the European project has dismally and abjectly failed and so he is
[56:34.680 --> 56:42.040]  beginning to run scared and when Angela Merkel and Nicola Sarkozy of Germany and
[56:42.040 --> 56:48.400]  France respectively were absolutely intransigent in the negotiations and
[56:48.400 --> 56:54.200]  wouldn't make any concessions at all to him even though Britain isn't even in the
[56:54.200 --> 57:00.960]  euro and should not therefore be asked to submit its own budgets for approval by
[57:00.960 --> 57:08.040]  these unelected commissars he finally realized that if he wanted to stay as
[57:08.040 --> 57:12.520]  leader of the Conservative Party he was going to have to raise his game on the
[57:12.520 --> 57:18.640]  European question and so he voted against the entire new treaty that we're
[57:18.640 --> 57:24.120]  going to bring in to allow the EU's commissars to put their sticky fingers
[57:24.120 --> 57:29.080]  all over our national budgets they can't do that because he has vetoed it one
[57:29.080 --> 57:34.600]  veto prevents any of these changes from happening and he for once found the guts
[57:34.600 --> 57:38.560]  to do this and it was a very good thing of course you can imagine how the
[57:38.560 --> 57:44.280]  mainstream press treated it here they said that we had isolated ourselves from
[57:44.280 --> 57:48.720]  Europe well of course now it's the other way around Europe has isolated itself
[57:48.720 --> 57:55.160]  from us by setting up essentially a fraudulent currency which has now about
[57:55.160 --> 58:01.040]  the value of monopoly money or Mickey Mouse money and it has failed and so
[58:01.040 --> 58:05.920]  David Cameron has realized he now needs to keep Britain out of any more
[58:05.920 --> 58:10.400]  expenditure on this nonsense going to be very very expensive putting the
[58:10.400 --> 58:15.000]  European Union's finances right well this is key Lord Martin will not be
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.640]  required to pay for it all right stay there we're gonna come back with five
[58:17.640 --> 58:20.880]  more minutes with you and I know you wouldn't say that you have a date when
[58:20.880 --> 58:24.680]  Greece is gonna basically default and all this if you didn't incredible

[58:27.960 --> 58:31.240]  guest if you want to visit his website it's excellent send it to your friends

[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:19.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:29.960]  Alex Jones well he is a frontline fighter and the most prolific exposing
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.200]  the globalist collectivist the Thoritarians he's Lord Christopher
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.920]  Monkton only got five minutes left with him finishing up on Europe if there was
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.840]  ever any doubt for anyone that it was a Thoritarian out of control when they
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.040]  make proclamations of you will wave all remaining sovereignty to us EU
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:51.240]  bureaucratic police will physically seize money to pay it you know we will
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:55.680]  put all new environmental controls in shutting down everything I mean just in
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.920]  von Roopie looking all crazy saying global governance global governance I mean
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:04.960]  it's so obvious what they're doing and then run by the mega banks that have
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.720]  engaged in all the fraud waging war against all the other free market
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:13.960]  banks and brokerage firms trying to take them over I mean here's the proof of
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.840]  the authoritarianism Lord Monkton well what they're doing is they are indeed
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:24.400]  trying to take democracy away forever the governing class in Europe and to a
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:29.920]  large extent in America has got tired of having to face re-election
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.280]  Lord Monkton Skype we just lost it and that was key information he was
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.680]  covering we've got to get him reconnected I may have to come back out to the
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:42.760]  break and then and get Heidelberg on it 15 after something because this is too
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.760]  important yeah that's it I mean look they're saying they're gonna censor the
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:51.000]  internet the government the media are getting together because the dominant
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.160]  dinosaur media is dying it's a perfect storm they're talking about secret
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:02:01.640]  arrest they're talking about grabbing American citizens the manuals aren't
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:06.000]  about al-qaeda it's all about American citizens and global warming skeptics and
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.600]  as Lord Monkton said they're getting tired of standing for election and I
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.480]  wanted to be able to finish that point because it is so important every
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.680]  generation ends up facing some form of tyranny and what we're facing is very
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:25.320]  nasty but it isn't a Mussolini or a Stalin running around in a clown outfit it
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:30.360]  is and we know what that looks like like a Charlie Chaplin movie when you made
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:34.680]  fun of them but now these people in suits all creeping around in a bureaucratic
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:41.880]  way beavering away like termites as Lord Monkton would say and we lost him on
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:46.520]  the Skype there and again I'm wound up ladies and gentlemen you've got to get
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:51.200]  wound up about this you've got to get out of your morass and we are doing that
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.080]  that's why before they thought they could just barrel through with all this
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:03:01.520]  regardless but now if they were gonna let the free press the alternative
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.360]  press still be there because they thought well nobody listens to them
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:08.360]  nobody listens to Ron Paul nobody listens to Alex Jones now because they
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:13.120]  realized that we are supplanting them exponentially they've lost some of the
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:16.600]  arrogance in the hubris five years ago I'd say man I hope they continue with
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:20.400]  this hubris because we're really making inroads against these people and they're
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.340]  really arrogant up there and don't understand it now they still kind of got
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:28.600]  the arrogance but they're concerned and they think well we'll just crush them
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.720]  and I Lord Monkton I'm sorry your Skype cut out finishing up with the where
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:37.600]  you left off of they don't want to stand for reelection no that's right they
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:42.340]  would like to just be in power forever and that's what the transfer of
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:47.960]  government away by treaty from elected hands in your Congress to unelected
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:53.680]  hands at the UN means and so what you have to start doing is preparing your
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:00.280]  friends in Congress to vote against any treaty that comes out of Rio de Janeiro
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.440]  or Qatar later in the year this biodiversity thing is just another
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.800]  excuse for a power grab by the usual suspects and Congress must not ratify
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:18.120]  any such treaty get on to your senator now and say look enough is enough they
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.880]  got the global warming thing long wrong now they're going to get the sustainable
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:26.400]  development and biodiversity thing wrong as well there's no scientific basis
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:31.840]  for giving up our democracy it is time for all this nonsense to stop okay I
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.000]  know you're very busy sir but since we lost a few minutes with you I'd like to
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.400]  briefly go to break and come back for a few more minutes and finish up or with
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.520]  the exactly what they're doing in Europe what this as you said a week and a half
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:47.160]  ago they're just gonna announce total power grab like you know in response to
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:51.360]  being exposed fleeing forward and then briefly Ron Paul and the different
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:55.040]  tactics they're using to try to block people from voting for them I want to
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:05:00.160]  get your view on that straight ahead then hoppy heidelberg coming up
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:08.880]  you may be arrested tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:13.640]  become reality it really says that the state is God the United States is now
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:18.280]  recognized globally is one of the most impressive police states on earth this

[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:35.240]  the new film a noble lie is out the first official in a well-produced eye
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:40.280]  witness film that's come out since the tragic events and you see the
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:44.160]  establishment gearing up to blame domestic groups for a new event that is
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:47.560]  what the globalists are going to try undoubtedly so we've got to expose this
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:50.920]  paradigm right now now I've got a big news blitz coming up in five minutes
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:54.560]  because I spent most the first 30 minutes on Ron Paul we're gonna get Lord
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.520]  Monkton's take on that because he's been at the highest levels of the British
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:01.320]  government and also run for election in Scotland had them try similar things but
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:06.120]  finishing up with the point that you were making about Europe is trying to go
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:10.640]  authoritarian they don't even deny that on Bloomberg TV they say well they have
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.800]  to do it to fix things and they're gonna get rid of sovereignty and then and
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.480]  basically where others failed to conquer Europe the megabanks have done it
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:25.520]  and and the bureaucracy now rules and it looks like Von Rumping and others are
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:29.960]  still quite arrogant even as things implode underneath them Lord Monkton
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:33.280]  well yes they're taking full advantage of this by saying well of course the only
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:38.240]  reason why this happened is that we didn't have enough power of course it
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.240]  happened because they already had too much power but they're just twisting it
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:46.400]  and turning it around so this it's the same story in Europe with the Europe as
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:51.640]  it is with the UN and the climate these are a concerted effort indeed the EU's
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:57.480]  advisors are telling the UN how to draft its biodiversity treaty in such a way
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.600]  that it takes advantage of all the tricks the EU has learned for instance
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:07.520]  you can put the treaty into place and then it self-amends without having to
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.760]  get the ascent of all the parties it means you start with the stub of a
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:14.360]  treaty and then the bureaucrats can make up anything they want from then on they
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.080]  have absolute power they've done this in Europe and they're planning to do it
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:25.040]  with this biodiversity treaty as well and the only way to stop it is not to
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:29.960]  ratify it in the first place and the United States has got to be very clear
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:34.960]  about this this will be profoundly deeply damaging to the West in general
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:40.880]  and to the United States in particular a great Satan these are the people who
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:46.280]  want to destroy the United States they're using the UN as the weapon to do it
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.640]  and the United States I mean at least half of the United States unfortunately
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:55.720]  is a party which is perfectly happy to go along with this final destruction of
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:01.320]  everything that your founding fathers wanted to set up and resist and it's
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.400]  so draconian I mean they're openly in our newspapers saying it's for the earth
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:10.280]  your power prices will now double in the next two years and they say it with a
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:14.840]  straight face and meanwhile all the jobs are moving to Mexico and China because
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:18.640]  we can't even have power to run factories and they just giggle at us and
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:24.080]  the same bureaucrats then own shares in the factories in China and and it's like
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:35.000]  a sacrament to destroy your country and the real worry that I have is that the
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.800]  two leading contenders at the moment for the Republican nomination are deeply
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:44.920]  unsound on this whole global warming and environmental sex question you've got
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:49.520]  newt gingrich who's been a sort of closet greenie in and out of the closet
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:56.160]  for years he sat on that settee with what's her name Pelosi to talk about
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.360]  global warming enthusiastically and then you have Mitt Romney who's even worse
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:07.920]  I mean these two are totally unfit to hold office because they don't see what
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:12.720]  it is that the U.N. and its various friends among the Democrats are planning
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:17.520]  to do to America and they're not going to defend America and its constitution
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:23.400]  against this dangerous onslaught from the people who are trying to bring the
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:29.280]  West down forever and impose a global communist or fascist dictatorship it
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.480]  doesn't matter what kind of label it's totalitarian either way and again as we
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:37.400]  often say Alex people listening in may think isn't this all terribly extreme
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:41.960]  what they're saying yes it is because that's what's actually going to happen
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:46.680]  we've already seen it in Europe Britain is no longer a democracy oh we have all
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:50.520]  the trappings we have an election every five years doesn't make any difference
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:55.680]  because five things my laws at 83% of our laws according to official German
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:00.560]  estimates are made for us by the unelected commissar of the bureaucrat of
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:06.080]  the European Union Lord Montyn what's going to happen to America too once the
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:13.000]  U.N. gets this biodiversity treated through so Rio must not succeed well
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  they're definitely on the defensive right now but as you said they just
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.760]  metastasize into something new but looking at this it's similar to what we
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.760]  have here where the EPA just does whatever at once outside of law and is
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:33.320]  now announced that under the rubric of biodiversity they can do anything and
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.960]  and you know you're saying Gennrich and others are just ignorant I know you're
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:44.480]  being polite well they're fully conscious of it they understand I mean I'm
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.600]  saying you're that's right and so unfortunately I mean in many ways I
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:51.360]  rather like newt gingrich I know him quite well I see him quite a bit but
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:58.920]  I'm afraid on this issue he is so fatally ill advised that he would make a
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:02.720]  most terrible mess as president because he would buy into all this garbage and
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:07.040]  because the republicans in Congress tend to be loyal to their president they
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:11.080]  would vote for this garbage too you need to have a president in the White House
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:16.160]  who simply says to all this environmental nonsense draw a line under it
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:21.480]  enough is enough but as you said as you said the working classes what is your
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:25.640]  estimate because I've seen variants from different ribs but is it not in the
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:30.360]  tens of billions what has been spent selling the lie of man-made global
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:35.360]  warming we're in the hundreds of billions now it's it's I mean 80 billion
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:40.160]  has been spent by the United States alone on this Europe has probably spent
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:44.520]  another 40 billion I mean we're looking very very serious amounts of money
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:49.440]  taxpayers money at a time when these governments are all bust anyway this is
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.800]  extraordinary thing they go on and on squandering cash on this
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:57.520]  environment garbage well that's because it's the global government religion
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:00.680]  that's why Romney and that's why again rich support and that's why they're
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:04.880]  endorsed by the republican rhinos is because this is what the ruling class
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:08.120]  wants to be able to shut down any competition that isn't part of the
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:11.920]  little inner coterie and then meanwhile it covers up for real
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:17.160]  environmental concerns that are going on instead they run around chasing
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:21.760]  phantoms of carbon dioxide this was completely manufactured but in closing
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:27.440]  Ron Paul is is is winning in Iowa winning in other states and so for the
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:31.520]  first time the governor and others have have reportedly according to Politico
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:36.120]  come out and said if you vote for Ron Paul because it's an old-fashioned you
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:41.560]  know vote in the counties yeah in these groups that that it discredits it is that
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:47.000]  not an attack on the electoral process to say vote for him and you discredit
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:54.360]  Iowa and our electoral system is they're saying that you the people no
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:58.520]  longer have the right to decide anything we will tell you what is good for you
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:02.840]  now that's not what the founding fathers of your constitution wanted they
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:08.040]  wanted to make sure that every man had his vote and that that vote would decide
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.680]  the kind of government you've got and the kind of president you've got and if
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.960]  people want to vote for Ron Paul that is their choice and they should have the
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:21.280]  absolute right to exercise it and nobody should come along and say but this
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:25.120]  would be an abuse of the electoral process of course it isn't it is your
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.920]  right to vote for who you want to vote for and if Ron Paul is the one person
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:35.040]  currently front-running who isn't buying into all this in viral garbage then
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:39.400]  he's the one you should vote for I don't think it's worth voting for
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:47.800]  Gingrich or for that Mormon fellow Romney while they continue to buy this
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.800]  drink the environmental Kool-Aid once they come off the Kool-Aid different
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:55.640]  matter but while they're on it then these are people who essentially are
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:17:00.480]  haters of America there's no other way of putting it these are people who want
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:06.880]  to destroy your democracy destroy your constitution and take away in doing so
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:13.000]  your democracy your right to choose for yourself what laws that shall be made
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.640]  for you and what taxes shall be imposed upon you yet these people would hand
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:22.200]  all that away to the unelected bureaucrats of the UN and of course as you
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:26.440]  rightly say in the big bank who are very close in with the UN it's all a nice
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:30.840]  little cozy arrangement together with the ordinary people coming nowhere and
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.560]  that is what's got to change and if Ron Paul is a spokesman for that then Ron
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.800]  Paul is the person you vote for well I mean here's another example here's
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.520]  Christian Science Monitor now polls are coming out showing Ron Paul the lead in
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.300]  the next key state New Hampshire I don't I mean the system is going to go
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:50.000]  completely crazy because they tried to destroy his son with a bunch of dirty
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.120]  tricks in Kentucky in the Senate race last year it didn't work I know you've
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:00.280]  been at the end of a lot of dirty tricks we've got to certainly pray for Ron
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:04.600]  Paul pray for you of course everybody else is standing up against these people
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:09.920]  but I think the big mega banks and the UN crowd have bitten off more than they
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:14.240]  can chew and the sleeping giant that is the you know the free people of the
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:19.920]  West is beginning to rise and I'm seeing fear in them I think they are now
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:24.280]  frightened of the people that's why they're so desperate to run this power
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:30.000]  grab through quickly before the people have quite spotted what's going on it's
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.920]  going to be a lot of well-meaning people who buy into this environmental stuff
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:39.160]  because rightly they say we want to exercise a sensible stewardship of the
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:43.040]  planet we don't want to make an undue mess of it and therefore they are
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.800]  predisposed if you'd like to believe anything that's told to them in that
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:51.760]  direction but now a lot of ordinary voters have you know there's a kind of
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:56.360]  common sense in ordinary voters that's the whole Constitution is built on the
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:00.680]  idea but the voters have a common sense that the governing class doesn't have and
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:05.880]  so the voters are going to have to really assert themselves at this coming
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:10.040]  election they're going to have to turn Obama out of the White House I'm sorry

[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:15.320]  some of the news this is the type of stuff coming out right now this is out
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:19.920]  of Christian Science Monitor what if Ron Paul wins Iowa and New Hampshire too and
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.840]  then it gets into the fact that more and more he's going into first place in
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:29.080]  Iowa New Hampshire and the system's completely panicking so the different
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:35.000]  politicos in Iowa are quoted in the end political saying that he's going to ruin
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.600]  the state and you know ruin their record and and discredit their caucus their
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:49.720]  people voting on who Republican voters have sent to the caucus to represent them
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:53.840]  the people get together in the Republican Party they vote they send their
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.400]  people to their caucus in their little towns they all vote with their hands
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:03.120]  they count it all up but now the feds are coming into town to oversee because
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:08.200]  the anonymous threatened to hack it all you need is a public tallying they're
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:11.080]  gonna have trouble though because each caucus will look at their numbers and
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:16.680]  so there's no telling what the establishment's gonna do but Ron Paul
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:23.240]  does need a lot of security if they see him really building and know that he's
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:27.440]  gonna create so much attention to liberty during the campaign even if they
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:31.560]  plan on trying to steal elections with the general computerized vote later they
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.280]  could pull something even though it's incredibly obvious with a lone nut who's
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:40.000]  let out of some government psychiatric facility just to try to shut this down
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.880]  but they also know that could cause a revolution anyway you slice it
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:49.000]  resistance is victory as long as Ron Paul's ready to be torn apart in the
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.480]  media and even physically attacked and he is he's in the arena he's a champion
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:59.800]  he's a champion I was watching some Morton Downey Jr. clips I'd seen a year
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:05.200]  ago of him Ron Paul back in the 80s on there with all these idiots yelling at
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:08.240]  him and how Ron Paul was jumping out of his seat and yelling at him back when he
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:15.400]  was younger I guess Ron Paul's a little more like Alex Jones than we thought but
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:19.120]  we're gonna put a compilation of that stuff together soon and do a special
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:24.280]  piece on it but alright I'm spending too much time with the Ron Paul thing I
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:28.280]  already covered in the first hour it's just will Ron Paul kill the caucuses you
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:33.360]  heard Moncton I mean that is pure arrogance by the system saying we decide
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:40.440]  how you vote you you if you do vote for him the governor reportedly says then
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:48.840]  that ignore the vote I mean think of the arrogance ignore my state and look at
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:53.320]  the second runner up which will be Mitt Romney who the newspapers on the
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:59.080]  globalist are endorsing Mr. Carbon tax I mean think of that arrogance if Ron Paul
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:04.080]  wins ignore our state Ron Paul is this crediting our state which is saying our
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:10.720]  voters are bad I mean what an arrogant blob and of course he's launched his
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:15.160]  salvo they'll try to deny it now and play politics again it's like I said the
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:19.000]  NDAA doesn't have secret arrest for citizens in it and now that it's passed
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.960]  oh yeah it does what's wrong with that military will be dropping by real quick
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:28.240]  and getting wake go it worked it's not an assault come out of your hands up you
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:31.760]  walk out you get shot they say it's alright more of you come out they walk

[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:43.080]  how they killed them how they did it but the whole time not an assault not an
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:47.080]  assault people want to believe it's not an assault okay I'll come out oh good
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:59.640]  come on out come on out this is not an attack don't run we are your friends oh
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:04.240]  my gosh it is amazing but don't worry the Iowa GOP is worried about hacker
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:10.200]  threat to caucuses mmm and there's a worst-case scenario investigators don't
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:14.200]  know what the threat is authentic but has nonetheless led the state party to
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:18.560]  confront worst-case scenarios their fear and Iowa caucus marked by hackers who
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.480]  corrupt the database used to gather votes and crash the website used to
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:25.960]  inform the public about results that could shape the campaign for the White
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:32.200]  House also see then the hackers attack so Ron Paul one but we're not sure it's
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:36.400]  all confused and they'll count on you not knowing that each county has the
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:41.280]  tally by hand vote and anybody with a calculator could sit there and do the
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:44.720]  number it's like oh we got the tabulations now we've got to have
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:51.600]  experts because the hackers hit it oh the dirty people wearing Guy Fox mask oh
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:58.840]  my gosh oh it's terrible I mean you can see what they're doing remember they
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:02.920]  launched Stuxnet Israel and the US did on Iran I said watch they're gonna blame
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:06.600]  the freedom of the internet on it even though the government midst they launched

[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.960]  internet shutting down whoever they want offensively preemptively because of
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:26.560]  Stuxnet and they think you're morons the government admits they launched it in
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.320]  conjunction with Israel but they got to start shutting down our freedom because

[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:51.560]  not this subject you cannot get this on the air because they do not want you
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:56.600]  knowing about COG Jesse Ventura TV show that I advised on the FEMA camps got
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:01.000]  shut down after it aired one time and Congress and homeland security threatened
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:06.020]  time Warner and then they threatened their subsidiary true TV because we
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:09.980]  documented the threat fusion centers the FEMA camps the spy grids the end of
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:14.080]  Posse commentators they had a former FBI agent in there blowing the whistle now
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:18.840]  works for the ACLU mr. German it was the most credible of all the episodes
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:23.280]  they've had and you know because they're all serious subjects but some of us
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:26.520]  kind of entertainment wise because that's how they lighted on TV this thing
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:32.200]  was so hardcore because I basically you know did the research for about 70% of
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:36.040]  it of course was in it that they did it got taken off television and erased off
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:42.480]  DVRs so now we have on the Homeland Security website the original contract
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:46.160]  from May thanks to a listener pointing it out to us yesterday where they put
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:50.400]  out the contracts to have a general contractor and Halliburton got it and
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.640]  it's all there all the subcontractors everything it's all right there and it's
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:58.880]  a new article and it needs to get out to everybody it's homeland security moves
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:03.120]  to manned FEMA camps on December 6 we reported on a document originating from
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:06.800]  the Halliburton's the city area KBR describing services KBR is looking to
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.160]  farm out the subcontractors the document was passed on this by a state
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:14.960]  government employee complete with phone numbers and everything our research has
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:18.160]  since discovered another document that further reveals the ongoing effort by
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:21.600]  the government to establish FEMA camps they've built them now they're moving to
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:25.160]  have people who are paid to be on standby to man them first time we've ever
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:28.920]  seen this happening and you saw DHS announced last Friday we wrote an
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:33.760]  article about that preparing for massive influx of a collapse of Mexico get
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:38.000]  emergency camps ready so they're getting ready for really total economic
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.200]  collapse is the point and this article goes over all of this so there should be
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:47.440]  a debate about this but they don't want you to know about it so that article is
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:50.280]  at info wars.com here's some of the other stuff we've got we're going to our
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:55.520]  guest regulators seek ban of cell use in cars even hands-free wall street
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:00.640]  journal I mentioned this last week this is from December 14 and I see emails
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:05.200]  saying this can't be true yes the feds want to ban using hands-free which is
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:08.920]  totally safe to talk in your car next I guess they're saying you can't talk in
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:12.360]  your car and the and more frightening the feds are saying they want to track you
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:16.320]  in real time be your cell phone to make sure you're not talking on it so it's
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:21.320]  just an excuse at prior restraint to surveil you so regulators seek ban on
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:26.800]  use in cars of even hands-free and then we've got some other reports here they're
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:32.320]  not trying to see Iran carried out 9-11 and they had a federal judge say so but
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:36.680]  never any discussion of Saudi Arabia were 15 of the 19 so-called hijackers
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:40.000]  came from our gallant little ally we're gonna go to our guests in a moment I
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.560]  just want to add here that this broadcast is listeners supported but
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:49.560]  that's a side issue when I see a film like a noble lie Oklahoma City 1995 with
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.840]  myself in it but more importantly Jane Graham survivor of the attack a
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:59.240]  hoppy Heidelberg cop of the year Terrence Hickey's mother and so many
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:03.120]  others the inventor of the neutron bomb saying that there were clearly bombs
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:06.920]  inside general Benton K. Parton former head of Air Force weapons development
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:11.200]  Brigadier General saying the same thing since day one it's all there the first
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:16.480]  and only professional and mom you know a current film there's been a some made
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.920]  at the time that were great and got the word out that had good information there
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:24.160]  but I spent 40 minutes in road to tyranny a three-hour film on it it's
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:29.320]  good it was the best work till that day this is really a masterpiece and it's
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:33.280]  available at info wars.com you support the filmmakers and our outfit when you
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:37.720]  do that a noble lie Oklahoma City 1995 show it to your pastor give it to police
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:42.480]  officers give it to your sheriff when I was in the SWAT team headquarters in
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:47.160]  Travis County about 10 years ago they came in with during citizens
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:51.640]  communications kind of threatened me I threatened to sue them it became a big
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.520]  article on the newspaper they apologized and invited me over to the SWAT team
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:59.240]  headquarters across the street from the county commissioners and when I walked
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:06.440]  in there I saw Waco the rules of engagement that shows the flare
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:11.080]  flames the feds killing the people and I saw Oklahoma City documentaries
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:15.760]  exposing it so and they're like look we just told to go over there we're good
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:18.920]  guys and then later the lieutenant told me he was a patriot and they found it
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:24.640]  about that and fired him Lieutenant Beck was his name but all of that happened
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:28.600]  and so I'm just telling you this stuff has an effect you show this to police
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:32.840]  they're gonna wake up because this was a big false flag the prototype of 9-11 so

[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:07.240]  Chris Emery who we had on last week and it's it's it's great to have Hoppy
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:10.360]  Heidelberg back with us he's been on four or five times in the last 16 years that
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:14.840]  I've been on air but and he's been through so much you know to tell the
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:19.160]  truth but but I want to get different people on survivors grand jurors police
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:23.760]  officers you know mothers but we actually have a police officer who's
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.680]  actually been threatened we may be able to get on one of the ones they didn't
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:31.120]  kill just to illustrate for you for the people that were there what really
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:34.080]  happened and how this was blamed on the anti-globalist movement and the
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:36.960]  states rights movement and then of course there's all the White House memos
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:40.200]  and things saying they sure need another one it would sure be great there was a
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:45.000]  new Oklahoma City I'm very nasty how dumb they think we are to publicly talk
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.560]  about this so he was the grand jury foreman and he investigated evidence
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.120]  surrounding the Oklahoma City bombing and then of course so we have mr. Emery
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:56.840]  with him as well joining us gentlemen I could ask a lot of questions here but I
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:00.760]  want to welcome you both back and until we go to break in 10 minutes instead of
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:05.520]  me just throwing out the first questions you guys start talking about
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:10.960]  whatever you think is most important Alex the first thing I want to do is make
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:15.200]  a correction there I was not the foreman of the grand jury if I had been it
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:19.240]  would have been a completely different outcome let's see I'm going back from a
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:23.480]  decade plus so my memory gets foggy I apologize and no problem I just want to
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:27.400]  make that clear that because they kept bringing that up well you're not the
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:30.480]  foreman you can't demand this and you can't demand that's where I got it in my
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:34.160]  brain but yeah how long is the business we talk something like five six seven
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:38.280]  years oh at least yeah okay so hoppy hoppy was on the the grand jury please
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:45.800]  continue well they handed us when they called us back in December 94 to come
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:50.400]  in and then they excused the people who couldn't serve and then they drew out of
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:54.640]  the hat the names of the people that we're gonna serve and then they gave us a
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:59.400]  handbook called the grand jury's handbook and I took mine home and I went
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:04.080]  through it first highlighting it and then I came back and underlined with red the
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:08.560]  most salient highlighted parts and I understood that thing I could have
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:14.080]  taken a quiz on it and made a hundred I understood that book and I didn't realize
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:19.240]  that they didn't hadn't read the book and didn't understand it and were not
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:24.440]  going to go by it at all so the first day that of course I'd been on the grand
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:29.360]  jury since January 95 but the other grand jury there's two sitting grand jury
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:33.440]  is all the time in Oklahoma City there's one it serves from January to
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:38.240]  January and one from July to July well the July jury wasn't gonna have time to
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:42.640]  do this so we caught it and we started I don't remember what it was Mayor Jen
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:48.640]  but anyway the very first day that we started hearing evidence I call it that
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:55.760]  on the bombing they told us that we couldn't question witnesses well that's
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:00.880]  crazy I mean that's the whole purpose of a grand jury hearing like that is for
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:04.920]  grand jurors to be able to question witnesses so I showed them in the book
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:13.160]  where that I could question witnesses and that I planned to and finally they
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:17.160]  we came to a compromise we just had to call it off for a while and they came
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:21.200]  to a compromise said okay you can question and I was the only one that was
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:25.740]  allowed to question you can question but you have to submit your questions in
[01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:30.960]  advance well of course the book that was bull the book didn't say that but I
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:35.480]  was smart enough to know that that's not really a big deal I'll submit one
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:40.280]  question and then based on the answer to that question I'll come with the rest of
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:45.480]  the questions I have so I got around the one question rule and I got around the
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:50.080]  given them in advance the question rule the biggest problem was there wasn't
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:56.040]  any question these people that they brought in to testify knew nothing there
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:45:02.600]  was no questions really to ask of them they would testify that they saw Tim
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:08.200]  McVader gun show five years ago what big deal that hadn't that was not relevant
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:13.920]  at all to Oklahoma City in fact none of the testimony that I heard in that
[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:18.360]  grand jury room was relevant to Oklahoma City it was all about stuff that
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:25.160]  happened months and years before and it was just a dog in pony show and I
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:29.360]  finally complained to them I said look you're not bringing any witnesses in
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:33.920]  here know anything here's it here's witnesses that I want they said okay
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:39.120]  when we get through you give us your list of witnesses and we'll call them and
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:45.000]  I believe them which was not very smart I should have known better so when they
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.560]  were through with their witnesses they brought in the bill for us to sign and
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:53.400]  I never got to call any of my witnesses so that's when I wrote the judge your
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:57.160]  letter and told him what had happened I said they promised me I could call
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:01.760]  witnesses they didn't allow it here's the list of witnesses that needed to be
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:10.480]  called and I want you to make this happen well again I wasn't completely
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:14.800]  aware just how high this thing went but there's there wasn't any way I was going
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:21.000]  to get a federal judge to back me on this I realize now and so it took them
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.160]  about two or three weeks to decide what to do about my letter and then they
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:32.800]  decided they just couldn't grant me my wish to call in actual witnesses because
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:38.480]  I could have proven right away that the truck bomb is not possible for a truck
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:42.000]  bomb to blow up that building yeah they couldn't let you bring in Jane Graham
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.800]  who saw government agents planning bombs and thought they were telephone
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:49.360]  repairmen yeah you couldn't call the former head of Air Force weapons
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:53.480]  development you couldn't call Terrence Yege the police officer that saw it all
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:57.800]  I mean you couldn't call for actual witnesses they wanted you to just talk
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:03.800]  to random people that fit into their anti-patriot anti-right wing propaganda
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:08.240]  system well that's right and that's why the judge they finally decided that the
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:12.800]  judge just needed to fire me so he just wrote me a letter and said your services
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:17.200]  are no longer needed and if you don't keep your mouth shut you're going to
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:26.560]  prison and each outburst will be a separate event and you will have to serve
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:34.600]  your prison terms in order one after the other not at the same time so it was
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:38.920]  kind of a joke and I as soon as I got the letter out of the mailbox from the
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:46.280]  judge I faxed it to channel four K for the TV station here and that just blew
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:53.480]  the lid off of everything I mean that's tyranny with a capital T when they say
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:57.600]  we'll throw you in irons if you ask any questions that's exactly right and of
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:01.400]  course later on it got even worse they got even you know more threatening but
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:05.920]  the judge all he could threaten to do was just to put me in jail now tell us
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:10.600]  about the other threats the FBI visit all of it well the FBI came down a
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:15.440]  couple of times maybe in three I don't know but I remember two cases they came
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:23.440]  down and the one occasion that was the funniest is I was sitting my desk is in
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.880]  a bay window right there in front of the house so as they pull up and stop and you
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:32.960]  know who it is because the car they're driving is obvious motorpool and so when
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:37.520]  these guys get out the guy on my side the passenger side it got out took his
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:43.840]  pistol out of his holster his shoulder holster and stuck it in the waistband
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:50.080]  of his pants and then buttoned his suit jacket over the pistol so I watched
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:54.520]  all that with interest and so they came in and of course he was a bad guy they
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:58.080]  do this just like a TV show you got a good guy and a bad guy and a good guy
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:03.480]  he's real nice to you and and once he's come to help you see and a bad guy he's
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:08.360]  come to threaten you and and if the good guy doesn't have any luck so when the
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:12.720]  good guy wasn't having any luck why the bad guy just stood up unbutton his
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:18.240]  jacket and exposed that pistol in his belt and I was supposed to be afraid I
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:21.760]  guess is what it was they were it was some sort of emphasis I mean I was
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:25.920]  supposed to get some sort of message and I and and you can guess I guess what
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:29.560]  the message was supposed to be but I thought it was the silliest thing I'd
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:37.200]  ever seen and I just laughed at them and they finally just had to leave because
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:43.400]  they weren't getting anything done and I guess they liked playing along with the
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:47.040]  people that killed all those kids because I know it's funny for you but
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:51.400]  we've got to remember Terrence Yeke got tortured to death in fact we might need
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:54.520]  to investigate exactly who those guys were that came to your house because
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:59.440]  somebody's gonna brandish a firearm on a you know a nice gentlemanly person like
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:03.160]  yourself who knows what else they'll do yeah well of course I was supposed to
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:06.680]  think they were authorized to kill me but I knew better than that that's not
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:12.400]  the FBI's that's not their job that's a different well they do that quietly yeah
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:16.440]  they do that once they've got you off in custody yeah so the next time they came
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:20.560]  out they sent a lady out and that made it interesting I thought well what the
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:24.760]  heck are they gonna accomplish with this sweet-looking little old girl and she
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:31.560]  turned out to be the pepper she was mean it she was mean as a snake and she said

[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:34.360]  a noble lie is there with him in studio and this is so important and I'm gonna
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:38.520]  ask hoppy later I mean I'm sure he's seen the different democratic strategist and
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:42.240]  people of course the guy that helped cover up Oklahoma City is now the
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:46.160]  attorney general Eric Holder who was caught running a false flag in the
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:50.360]  Mexico if he's creeped out by all these different statements if he hasn't seen
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:53.800]  and we can pull him up but they're like yeah the president needs an Oklahoma
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:57.680]  City to look strong and get the people behind him and you know we know it
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:01.960]  helped Bill Clinton that's why I'm really revisiting this now this film came
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:06.600]  out at a perfect time it's a godsend that needs to be seen but hoppy so you
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:09.640]  were telling us about the little whippersnapper but see you're a nice
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:13.760]  guy you've got a tyrant at your house trying to intimidate you the judge tried
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:17.320]  to intimidate you they're way outside the law they would love to live in North
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:21.840]  Korea I mean this is the plague to liberty and you're just being the
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:24.960]  oh well but she was quite a whippersnapper because you're a real
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:29.280]  American but please continue yeah she said do you know how much trouble you're
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:34.240]  in I said no but I bet that's what you're here for to tell me and and the
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:37.920]  other guys want to laugh in and that just kind of ruined the whole thing
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:42.120]  because I kept making them laugh and they finally just had to leave I said to
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:46.480]  tell y'all what y'all go home and tell them you just scared the hell out of me
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:52.160]  if they ever call I'll back you up and they just had to laugh and leave but
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:56.720]  anyway the little gal didn't get a whole lot done you are something else
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:01.840]  Chris Henry I tell you hoppy Hodlberg's a treasure isn't he he certainly is when
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:05.360]  I first met him my hoppy you can correct me if I'm wrong but I think we spent
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:08.480]  almost five hours sitting at your kitchen table just talking about the case
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:12.720]  what you went through and I was just trying to get some memory back this
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:16.920]  morning on the way to the studio about that first meeting after I left his house
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:21.640]  Alex I pulled over to the side of the road and it took me probably a full 30
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:25.880]  minutes just to soak in what I had to learn from him this guy's a treasure it's
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:29.240]  unbelievable wealth of information about the case we're about to go to break we
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:32.520]  have all the breaks at this end of the hour I'm the start of the hour but hoppy
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:37.760]  but you know tell us what you've learned impart that knowledge on record of what
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:42.440]  really happened from your research in Oklahoma City well you have to go back
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:47.760]  to 93 when the anti-terrorist bill was before Congress and they couldn't get it
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:55.000]  passed so they had the 93 World Trade Center attempt to knock the towers down
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.160]  and of course that was a failure because the FBI ran that operation according to
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:06.520]  the New York Times and it failed and they didn't get the legislation passed so
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:12.720]  they waited a couple of years they did some homework they canvassed a bunch of
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:17.360]  federal buildings to try to decide which one would do them the best job work the
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:21.480]  best for them and they settled on Oklahoma City because we were the only
[01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:26.800]  federal building with a daycare center in it and they thought well now the
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:31.440]  pictures of those little babies bodies in the paper every morning and on the
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:36.760]  six o'clock news at night would probably get this bill passed for us and it
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:41.920]  turned out they were correct so that's why we won over Denver the finalists
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:46.880]  were where Oklahoma City Denver and Phoenix but Oklahoma City won because
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:52.840]  they had the daycare center oh absolutely Veritas on a silver platter
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:58:04.240]  please continue okay later on they sent some people down with with more serious
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:11.400]  threats people that were much more mysterious in nature that didn't claim
[01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:19.920]  to have any official capacity I could guess who they were speaking for stay
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:22.840]  there we got to go to break in one minute we'll come back with the other
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:27.480]  mysterious threats that and remember these are real threats my friends you
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:30.520]  know what happened to Terence Yeggy we'll talk about that his mother's in the
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:34.440]  film they tortured him something fierce to to find out what evidence he had he
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:37.360]  was the hero that drug a bunch of people out of the building third hour
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:45.360]  straight ahead government sponsored terror you are listening to GCN visit
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:54.960]  gcnlive.com today hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:59:00.120]  century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:04.280]  off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:09.600]  I've determined its influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:15.120]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:19.000]  pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:24.000]  the criminal off-short cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.120]  ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:31.640]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:36.880]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:25.960]  Austin Texas Alex Jones well hobby Heidelberg was called in on the federal
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:30.160]  grand jury and he thought he'd actually ask some real questions it was on the
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:33.400]  news there were other bombs in the building witnesses said they'd seen
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:37.000]  feds in their plant and bombs it's all over the news there you know well I
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.480]  think I'll ask some questions then and over the last 50 years or so they've
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:47.120]  turned jury's grand juries in more and more to kept creatures who are told
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:52.000]  what to do and that's not how the Bill of Rights Constitution and our system of
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:55.720]  government works and that's what jury notification is about is rediscovering
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:59.560]  that these citizen rule books that are nailed out free with all of the orders
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:03.160]  at info wars dot com break all that down for you and we've got top
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:06.360]  constitutional law scholars on to break it down but this is a short segment long
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:13.120]  segment coming up hobby Heidelberg and Chris Henry are a guest so you were
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:16.280]  getting to all the different you know FBI coming brandishing guns and you said
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:27.760]  more threats came yes and I was told that if I filed a lawsuit that everything
[02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:31.920]  would be forgiven I could live everything it'd be fine if I didn't
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:39.160]  file a lawsuit and as you'll recall Glenn Wilburn did file a lawsuit and did
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:46.960]  not survive so it was not an empty threat and it didn't bother me a whole
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:51.280]  lot because it was I'm gonna sue Caesar and Caesar's court I mean come on I
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:57.960]  wouldn't gonna sue anybody and so that was the end of that threat it didn't
[02:01:57.960 --> 02:02:01.760]  really matter they were still scared of you calling witnesses and it being on
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:07.320]  record yeah well yeah they're scared of anything you know and then you know got
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:11.120]  the helicopter treatment later but that's it that's that's a little
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:15.160]  different story all I know you know was it you know was it you know Western
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:18.520]  Southern you folks don't like to talk about things that have happened to them
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:23.160]  but you've got to tell us the rest of the story of what happened to you the
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:26.280]  other forms of harassment because I've gotten the helicopter treatment so is
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:33.440]  my family yeah well they started flying three helicopters over my house once a
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:39.800]  week and they would circle my house very low until I came out and acknowledged
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:47.960]  their presence so they could go on and the message I assume was that we want
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:54.000]  you to know we know where you live and any night we chose to we could drop a
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.040]  bladder of gasoline on the roof in your house and shoot it with a flare and burn
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:04.000]  you and your family to death that was the message I understood the message I
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:08.640]  wasn't terribly worried about the message because people that do a lot of
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:14.440]  threatening aren't as likely to act as people who don't bother to threaten
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:18.120]  first they just act yeah I've said anybody doesn't think of my family
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:21.800]  there's not gonna be any threats mate I will guarantee that and you know what
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:24.840]  do they think is gonna happen as they keep killing people and intimidating
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:29.320]  don't they know people are gonna start responding back I mean we know where
[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:34.480]  they're at as well well yeah but they have they think they've got all the
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:38.720]  power because they've got the military might and they don't fear us because we
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:48.560]  as of yet have not offered to resist the way you have to well that's because
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:51.560]  discretion is a greater part of valor but the same thing happened for decades
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:57.120]  before 1776 hoppy yeah well we're cut basically we're in the same shape we
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:04.240]  were then you know the court the crown was doing sending out agents to eat out
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:08.000]  our substance and all of that that's exactly what's going on right now I
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.800]  mean the EPA every government agency you can think of their job is to eat out
[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:18.520]  our substance to break us they're determined to destroy the middle class
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:23.480]  and they're well on the way when they double and triple the price of food and
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:28.600]  fuel they've got you because you can't do without either one and you're not
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:34.320]  gonna have the money to do anything else even if you even if you have the
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:37.280]  money to afford food and fuel you're not gonna do anything else and it's gonna
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:41.000]  get to the point where you can't even afford well stay there hoppy long

[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:10.640]  because there's a war on for your mind
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:26.440]  okay we are back and if you just joined us
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:36.800]  Hoppy Heidelberg was a grandeur for the federal case in Oklahoma City and they
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:40.040]  wouldn't call anybody connected to it they wouldn't call all the witnesses
[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:43.920]  that were on the news saying they saw feds at McVeigh planting gray sticks of
[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:47.240]  butter they wouldn't call Terrence Yeke and the other police that showed up
[02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:51.600]  minutes into it they wouldn't call the I mean the governor said they were there
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:55.160]  and saw bombs removed them and we have all these newscast they're in the film
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:09:00.560]  a noble lie and he was trying to ask these questions and he went to the judge
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:03.920]  and the judges said you're off of this you're gone even though grandeurs are
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:08.840]  supposed to be running things not the other way around and then the FBI keep
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:12.160]  coming to his house and you know opening their shirts up and showing him a
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:16.560]  firearm stuck in the you know the waistband threatening him and then
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:22.120]  helicopters flying around in his house multiple times a week threats and then
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:27.240]  he was told don't file your lawsuit against this you're gonna end up dead
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:33.480]  all will be forgiven and then another gentleman did and ended up dead now
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:37.280]  remember cop of the year got killed other people got killed I've talked and
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:41.480]  we're gonna try to get him on the show police officers who've been threatened
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:45.240]  Colonel Craig Roberts has talked about this who was also a Tulsa police officer
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:51.440]  Tulsa detective who they sent out there separately an army lieutenant colonel
[02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:55.000]  and before that famous Marine Corps sniper who wrote a bunch of best-selling
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.360]  books on sniping the point is all of this went on they even tried to set up
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:03.600]  Colonel Roberts a couple times you for all sorts of things and we're
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:08.200]  investigating him for terrorism because he dared talk about this now years
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:12.240]  after he's off the Tulsa police force they come to him and apologize but
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:15.240]  that's all a side issue Craig Roberts a lot of great characters up there in
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:21.480]  Oklahoma Marine Corps sniper Colonel in the army Tulsa police department SWAT
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:25.760]  team leader helicopter pilot back one time the helicopter broke down over
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:28.640]  Tulsa and he'll tell you the whole story again an inch and a half shorter after
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:32.800]  the crash from his spine compressing but side issue going back to Hoppy
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:38.840]  Heidelberg all this is going on bring us up to how how were you given the message
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:43.720]  you're saying shadowy figures not FBI threatening with guns now that you're
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:48.280]  gonna be dead if you file a lawsuit on us tell us what the lawsuit was gonna
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:51.720]  concern I know we've talked about over the years but my memories even foggy on
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:56.800]  this hobby and then you know more about the helicopters what they look like and
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:08.680]  then Mr. Wilbur and what happened to him well the lost my training thought
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:12.960]  asked me a question a lot of questions yeah well let me let's get into the
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:18.440]  shadowy figures okay this guy wasn't he didn't have on a coat and tie he had on
[02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:23.480]  Levi's and boots but he was obviously not a cowboy turned out he was an
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:27.320]  attorney I did a little homework later and found out who he was he was an
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:34.200]  Oklahoma City attorney and he was trying to pretend to be my friend and my
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:43.760]  associate and be a cowboy and all of that but his approach much lighter much
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:51.640]  softer no threats exactly but his approach was way more serious than the
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:58.360]  guys that were trying to be bad so I knew pretty much where the message was
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:03.480]  coming from it didn't concern me because I didn't know and I still don't know
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:07.640]  that I had a lawsuit lawsuit for what sue the judge for kicking me off the
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:12.760]  jury I don't know that that's not his he didn't have the authority to do that I
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:17.200]  don't know what was the point of suing them I wasn't gonna sue so I ignored it
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:20.920]  it didn't bother me I wasn't worried about it and the helicopter thing didn't
[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:26.840]  start till sometimes later before we finish I want to do two points that
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:31.240]  come from general part and I don't have to do them right now but there's two very
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:36.520]  important I'm gonna write that down two points on part and we can also part yeah
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:39.560]  yeah I'm gonna write that down but continuing with the threats because
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:43.560]  that's evidence of the criminality but but but specifically was it like I'm
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:48.560]  your friend but you're not gonna live if you go with this lawsuit everything
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:52.120]  will be forgiven because you said that earlier
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:13:02.160]  well he didn't know he was smooth this guy was not he knew how to work it he
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:07.080]  was good that's why we that's why he was sent he was good he was a matter of
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:16.120]  fact he was not threatening is a very nice friendly tone of voice but that's
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:20.920]  what made it so creepy exactly I knew exactly that this man was for real he
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:25.040]  wasn't sent there to blow smoke or anything like that he was just gonna
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:34.920]  tell me exactly how it was gonna be and if I didn't like it okay it didn't
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:40.840]  really bother me he was a nice guy his threat was empty not because they
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:45.160]  wouldn't do it it was empty because I had no interest in filing a lawsuit
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:50.280]  because I didn't have any I didn't have anything in mind I mean what what was
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:52.960]  well there was some type of suit they were concerned about and we could talk
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:56.440]  about that later now particularly with the helicopters what do they look like
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:01.320]  unmarked well yeah they were unmarked I've heard all the stories about the
[02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:05.840]  black helicopters and everything and I will admit that it up high against a
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:12.640]  blue sky they were so dark they look black but they got down so low right in
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:17.560]  my yard right around my house that I that they were a very dark green is what
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:21.200]  they were they weren't really black they were the mine they're there are black
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:27.720]  helicopters but mine were a very dark green helicopter yeah so that's FEMA or
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:33.000]  an auxiliary of it okay I don't know but I could look directly not directly I
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:36.840]  mean but they didn't get down so low they's gonna crash but I look right at
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:42.840]  the pilots you know we had eye contact every time and I don't know they may
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:45.800]  have come when I wouldn't there time or two and I didn't come out I don't know
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:50.480]  that but I know that all the times that I came out they circled till I came out
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:55.840]  and then once I waved them off they went on always three of them always came from
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:15:01.840]  the same direction always left in the same direction so now specifically though
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:07.760]  tell us about the gentleman and who he was who did file a lawsuit oh Glenn
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:12.080]  Wellburn was an accountant here in Oklahoma City and he lost two grandchildren
[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:17.520]  in the daycare center and he's pretty sharp he was pretty sharp he figured out
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:21.760]  right quick that this was all bogus and you know nothing that government said
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:25.840]  could hold water it is there's something wrong with it so he went
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:33.760]  investigating and he eventually got his daughter who had standing because it was
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:38.560]  her children that were killed got his daughter to file a lawsuit against Tim
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:48.240]  McVay this is kind of odd but what it did it gave him the opportunity to pursue
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:54.720]  documents that they didn't want to give up nor did they want to say we don't want
[02:15:54.720 --> 02:16:04.160]  to give up so it had the potential of being a problem and therefore they knew
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:09.000]  that the girl would not pursue the lawsuit if they got rid of her dad and
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:16.640]  so when they got rid of Glenn why the lawsuit went away and then he went away
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:20.760]  too and he well yeah he went away first and then the lawsuit went away how did
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:26.360]  he go away I forget cancer pancreatic cancer that was one of the worst ways to
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:31.120]  pass away Glenn passed on I believe a day or two after the McVay trial the
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:36.000]  federal trial verdict was read and Charles has an incredible story of how
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.040]  Glenn just literally couldn't stand up straight and was crying in Charles's
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:44.760]  arms this is I believe a few days before he passed on and wanted Charles to
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:49.080]  continue on because Glenn knew deep down inside that whoever murdered his
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:52.000]  grandkids were getting away literally with cold-blooded murder and he didn't
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:56.520]  want that to happen and they do as declassified have those fast acting
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:16:59.960]  cancers that's that's down been declassified and there's been a lot of
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:06.160]  other deaths so what about Terrence Yeke well Terrence Yeke of as we said last
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:10.280]  Friday that he passed on a year and three weeks after the bombing it was in
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:15.920]  May 1996 was on a Tuesday and he actually had turned he was 30 years and
[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:21.920]  six months old just a few days shy of that as you know his death was was
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:26.000]  horrible he had gone out to retrieve some records at a storage locker
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.160]  coincidentally enough he'd shared with Dr. Charles Chumlee who passed away in a
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:35.560]  very suspicious plane accident in the fall of 1995 that's a whole other
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:38.880]  story for another time we don't want to take up your your radio show we can tell
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:43.000]  that or you can tell it tonight yeah he was helping investigate too yes in fact
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:48.600]  Dr. Chumlee was Terry's back doctor I mean like you said many times Alex you
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:52.480]  couldn't make this up the the people that cross paths we're talking about one
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:55.880]  or two's degree of separation with all of the key players in this investigation
[02:17:55.880 --> 02:18:00.000]  not six or seven degrees they were just once or two removed from knowing each
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:04.480]  other I talked to Dr. Chumlee's son about three years ago he would not talk to me
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:08.120]  in person talked a few times on the phone asked me not to call him back he
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:11.480]  said he appreciated what we were doing on the film but he really he didn't feel
[02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:14.760]  comfortable with pursuing any other information that's how scared he had
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:19.240]  his son I mean I mean here's the deal a certain point if somebody killed my dad
[02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:24.120]  I mean I'm not making threats here people are gonna die and I think America
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:29.200]  used to be like that and so the system wouldn't act like this this much but I
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:34.200]  mean what is it like for you guys living so close to it or what's it like
[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:38.840]  watching Eric Holder on TV I mean let's talk about Eric Holder's role in all
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:44.080]  this well of course I wouldn't aware I mean I knew that it was a federal
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:52.160]  operation obviously but I wouldn't aware of Eric Holder's interest in this and I
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:59.360]  am not done any homework on that and really have no personal knowledge of
[02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:03.920]  Eric Holder's interest in the Oklahoma City bombing what we have Alex we've
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:07.240]  got cover the Jamie Garellic of course her signatures on the 9-11 Commission
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:11.000]  report and she's on the the group photo and on the inside jacket cover that
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:14.880]  book she was actually serving under the Justice Department number two under
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:18.960]  Janet Reno Eric Holder served in the lateral position at Jamie Garellic so
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:22.400]  you see these people rear their ugly heads so to speak on a judicial level
[02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:26.440]  they're coming back in time and time again because they know they got literally
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:29.680]  got away with murder it was Jamie Garellic that we found out was actually
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:34.360]  barking the marching orders out to the Oklahoma DA's office within days after
[02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:38.280]  the bombing on speakerphone yelling at the top of her lungs telling how the DA
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:41.560]  was going to investigate this case who they were going after who they were
[02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:46.760]  gonna ignore and that was it there was no no basically now why do we even have
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:50.680]  course but I mean I mean the the lawsuits that Jesse Trineau and others
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:54.920]  have filed they've gotten the emails from Holder where he's in control of the
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:58.280]  cover-up and he's saying things like this is our number one priority in the
[02:19:58.280 --> 02:20:04.720]  Justice Department this is D-Day cover this up just like Fast and Furious just
[02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:08.120]  there was a Kenny Trenidus murdered and we have the internal documents you've
[02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:13.760]  seen them Jesse has sent them a PDF internal emails from Holder's top
[02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:18.120]  lieutenants and his underlings his legal assistance everybody was on the same
[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:23.240]  page as far as how that investigation was going and Jesse basically said I
[02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:26.760]  believe an eight-page letter to Patrick Leahy who was in charge of the Senate
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:30.480]  subcommittee that was in charge of the hearings to basically approve Holder's
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:36.200]  approve appointment and Leahy refused to to respond to Jesse Trenidu and the
[02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:40.040]  fact that he had that letter all of the facts were laid out it's like Jesse was
[02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:45.240]  completely ignored what about what about Larry Potts they had the
[02:20:45.240 --> 02:20:50.200]  deputy FBI director he said that he was in Dallas and then he he claimed that he
[02:20:50.200 --> 02:20:55.320]  flew Southwest Airlines there world on alien others I broke this but it was
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:20:58.480]  also on some local papers I know and they turned out because of storms that
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:02.280]  day those flights didn't exist and then the receipts came up that he was there
[02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:05.680]  the day before and of course that's what witnesses had said they'd seen I mean
[02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:09.800]  that's that's a pretty big deal right there you guys got any comments on that
[02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:14.040]  I'm reading a memo actually that was put out by a colleague of ours that helped
[02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:19.160]  us with the film early on Danny Coulson was the FBI agent very peculiar
[02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:22.960]  situation there I got to talk to how was Larry Potts hiding because I'm going
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:28.600]  from memory it is this is amazing I actually was in the archives in Austin
[02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:33.080]  working with Wendy painting on looking at a lot of the defense team papers Larry
[02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:36.480]  Potts was actually best friends with Eric Holder and there's an article in the
[02:21:36.480 --> 02:21:39.320]  Dallas Morty News we stumbled across going through all of these boxes of
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:45.700]  papers Larry actually Eric Holder recused himself from prosecuting the
[02:21:45.700 --> 02:21:50.040]  Ruby Ridge case because Larry Potts was one of the the chief lieutenants in
[02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:55.440]  there since they were best friends Holder one of his few instances of having
[02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:58.720]  some ethics had to recuse himself from that these guys knew each other from
[02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:02.160]  way back was Larry Potts then ended up calling the shots according to Terry
[02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:07.320]  Nichols for Tim McVeigh and McVeigh was upset because Potts took him off script
[02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:11.040]  he changed the plans completely within a few hours before the bombing happened
[02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:14.560]  exactly I've forgotten more about this than most people will ever learn but I've
[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:18.120]  I've seen the copies the hotel receipts the government's had to admit that that
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:21.600]  was the case so it was Colson who we have the receipts from that what Marriott
[02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:26.080]  and then it's Larry Potts and the affidavits and the other witnesses who's
[02:22:26.080 --> 02:22:31.280]  there running the operation correct these people man blowing up daycare centers
[02:22:31.280 --> 02:22:39.520]  I mean they're just absolute demons what is it like for you hoppy just
[02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:46.560]  continuing to know this and watching these people walking around well it's
[02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:56.200]  been so long and I'm getting so old that there's not much shock value anymore I
[02:22:56.200 --> 02:23:03.360]  understand everything that I need to understand I know who's who and who does
[02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:11.160]  what for whom therefore there's not much new under the sun that I could learn
[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:17.960]  it would worry me of course anybody would be worried about what's going on but I
[02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:23.200]  know exactly what's going on in the world today and who's in charge of trying to
[02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:29.720]  get it to happen but because I'm a Christian I know that they're gonna
[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:36.040]  have a problem they can't get everything done they won't done unless God lets them
[02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:41.400]  and I'm not sure he's gonna lie or all the bad things they've got planned to
[02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:50.000]  happen so excuse me that's really my yeah that's kind of prime I'm backed up to
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:55.760]  the wall and I'm done about all I can done and do and I've got to leave it up
[02:23:55.760 --> 02:24:00.040]  to these younger men and just leave it up to God to take care of it and I'm
[02:24:00.040 --> 02:24:04.600]  just kind of retiring well that's what I've heard I heard a lot of people that
[02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:10.960]  are in a noble lie that this is this is time to write off in the sunset well it's
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:19.400]  it's my time just being diagnosed with something nobody wants to have and I
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:23.880]  plan to beat it but nevertheless I will be occupied with that for the next few
[02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:29.800]  months and and won't have any time to I'm glad we're getting this done because
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:35.000]  I don't know how many more opportunities we might have well it'll be
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.960]  commercial free tonight on the news and Aaron Dyches is doing it so you'll have
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:41.360]  the complete floor for 30 minutes an hour as long as you guys want I don't
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:45.680]  want to exhaust you I didn't know this hobby that you have something that
[02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:48.600]  nobody wants to get but we'll all certainly pray for you what have you
[02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:54.400]  been diagnosed with cancer I don't I believe that words are very powerful and
[02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:59.040]  therefore I hesitate to put certain things in words I hear you I hear you
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:02.880]  we'll all pray for you my friend now now you wanted to get into the bombs itself
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:06.480]  which is really at the heart of the issue and general Parton who came
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:09.640]  immediately when he saw it on the news columns at the back blown out with
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:14.200]  black points that columns right up by the truck not damaged I mean that's and
[02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:20.880]  then the newscasting bombs are being removed wow so break that down well
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:26.240]  this is the one thing that I needed to blow this thing wide open if I could have
[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:30.040]  got a hold of if I could have gotten general part now I knew I wanted structural
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:35.280]  engineers I wanted to know how strong these columns were designed how much
[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:41.360]  pounds per square inch of pressure could they survive I didn't know that I
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:48.200]  couldn't know that and without calling the engineers and the builders and
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:53.600]  everything of the building itself I learned later that the columns who were
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:59.600]  designed to withstand 3,500 pounds per square inch of pressure I learned later
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:10.120]  from general Parton that you can calculate how fast blast pressure decreases by
[02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:16.920]  dividing it by the distance cubed so it's real short let's say for arguments
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:23.960]  sake that the closest column to the truck was 10 feet away now it's easy to say
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:28.160]  and the government said that the ammonium nitrate bomb that was set off
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:33.240]  which we don't necessarily believe but anyway they claim it generated 500,000
[02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:39.320]  pounds per square inch of pressure well 500,000 pounds is certain enough to blow
[02:26:39.320 --> 02:26:48.880]  away a 3500 pound design column the problem is the distance when you cube
[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:53.240]  the distance and divide that into the pounds per square inch here's what we
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:27:02.560]  get we got 500,000 over the distance 10 feet cube 10 to 10 to 10 10 10 depends
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:08.600]  100 10 to 100 a thousand you got 500,000 over a thousand you divide a thousand
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:14.440]  into 500,000 you got 500 now we got a whole different ballgame now we got a
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:23.720]  3500 pound column and we only got 500 pounds of pressure so that proves beyond
[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:30.080]  the shadow of doubt that it was physically impossible for any truck bomb
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:35.040]  assuming it had ammonium nitrate in it any bomb that the government said it was
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:42.320]  impossible for it to blow down even one column much less go all the way east down
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:46.560]  the front of the building and then turn and go into the building and take out
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:51.680]  all those columns down on the east end so what happened was physically
[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:58.520]  impossible what McVay was convicted of is physically impossible all of that I
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:06.440]  could have proven if I had had the right witnesses as a grandeur and expanding
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:10.280]  on that I'm going from memory on this because I don't go off notes I go off
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:14.080]  memory and I didn't want to use to be but it wasn't a controlled demolition
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:17.920]  incorporated that blew up the majority of the building that was left they
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:22.720]  wouldn't let anybody get in and look at it and then on top of that they then
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:26.840]  buried it a Wacken Hut landfill and poured concrete in with the chunks but
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:30.200]  all and then of course it was a controlled demolition incorporated that
[02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:37.960]  helped do the work at the 9-11 site is that correct for my memory hoppy you
[02:28:37.960 --> 02:28:43.600]  may we have Chris may know that I don't know we have we have photos of CDI
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:47.800]  employees with their t-shirts at the the bomb site within about three days
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:51.480]  before was demolished oddly enough it was the same day that James Nichols was
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:55.640]  released from federal custody in Detroit and he was held up there on purpose for
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:29:00.160]  30 days so he wouldn't get out and support efforts such as hoppy and the
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:04.320]  day he in fact he called me before Terry's state trial and said the morning I
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:08.480]  got out of a federal custody in downtown Detroit at the federal courthouse was the
[02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:12.040]  morning that they blew up the Murr building and he was really upset because
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:15.120]  he wanted to be down here to find out the truth we should talk about that when
[02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:18.600]  we come back I mean we know from the witnesses and and documents that have
[02:29:18.600 --> 02:29:22.680]  come out we pretty much know how they did this and it's just horrible and and
[02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:26.960]  of course the motive but I want to get from hoppy again the motive also from
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:32.920]  Chris Emery but oh it's creepy having to go on air and talk about government
[02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:38.760]  people who many of them are still in government fact even more powerful and
[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:42.440]  have to talk about them but you know what you know what they killed those
[02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:45.760]  kids and if they can kill those kids and get away with they can kill anybody's
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:49.360]  kids we got to bring them to justice we're only gonna do that standing up to
[02:29:49.360 --> 02:29:56.600]  them we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[02:32:07.400 --> 02:32:11.440]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:32:11.440 --> 02:32:15.360]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:19.360]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:32:19.360 --> 02:32:23.920]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:27.960]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:31.760]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:32:31.760 --> 02:32:35.360]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:39.760]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:32:39.760 --> 02:32:42.880]  insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power
[02:32:42.880 --> 02:32:46.560]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:50.560]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[02:32:50.560 --> 02:32:54.560]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun

[02:33:01.600 --> 02:33:12.720]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:22.480]  half measures have gotten us to the place we're at
[02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:29.920]  watching what we say wanting to be polite being afraid has brought us all
[02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:33.680]  into grave danger when you give into tyrants when you buy into their
[02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:37.840]  propaganda when you ignore your lion eyes and your gut
[02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:42.720]  you manifest tyranny you allow the worst in society to take over
[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:46.320]  and it was oklahoma city that finally got me to go down and start my local
[02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:50.480]  access tv show that led to a local radio show
[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:54.800]  then a syndicated radio show and filmmaking and i have reached
[02:33:54.800 --> 02:33:57.760]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of
[02:33:57.760 --> 02:34:02.160]  people conservatively and i'm just an average person
[02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:05.920]  who has a conscience and knows that really wicked
[02:34:05.920 --> 02:34:10.160]  murderers and criminals have to be exposed a lot of people think you can
[02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:14.080]  just choose to say oh that's not true and then that
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:17.040]  gives your conscience rest and some people don't even have a conscience
[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:20.400]  nowadays and you notice society is degenerating
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:23.680]  you know i have a wi-fi of three children and i know full well the
[02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:28.320]  globalist are capable of anything people ask me then why do you do
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:32.720]  what you do because there's no future if we
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:35.920]  don't stand up to these people and i'm not worried about my future even my
[02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:39.440]  wife or my children's future as much as i'm worried about humanity and it's
[02:34:39.440 --> 02:34:42.720]  not because oh i'm some great perfect moral person
[02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:46.240]  it's because i understand these basic truths
[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:50.320]  when you get a government that starts setting off rice tag fires false flags
[02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:54.320]  you're in trouble and now we're a nation
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:57.920]  that pushes torture secret arrest preemptive war
[02:34:57.920 --> 02:35:02.480]  federal goons grope our children stick their hands down babies diapers
[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:05.760]  strip naked old ladies and they tell us that's okay
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:09.600]  i played clips on the news last night of four senators going we want to scare
[02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:12.240]  people we want us citizens to be scared when we're
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:15.520]  going to torture them and we want them i mean i didn't know this was in the
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:20.400]  debate on the ndaa until caller called we played it last night
[02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:23.680]  and you're a citizen you asked for a lawyer lindsay graham says
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:27.520]  oh no lawyer for you and when you realize the federal government at that
[02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:30.400]  level these guys are on the national security you know
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:35.120]  panels and things they all know about 9-11 they all know about oklahoma city
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:38.320]  i mean they're up there they hate america they hate freedom
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:42.320]  these people are mousy tongues hitlers they just
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:46.640]  are a bunch of old wicked men and they think it's real funny
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:49.840]  to go out and blow up a building they think we're gonna show this down the
[02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:52.240]  nightly news i've shown it before even glenn beck
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:54.640]  earlier this year said the government's getting ready for a new
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:56.800]  oklahoma city to blame it on domestic groups
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:00.720]  because they put out all these memos at the white house and top
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:04.400]  advisors saying man it sure helped us a new one would sure be great mr
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:08.240]  president i mean there's not one millimeter of
[02:36:08.240 --> 02:36:14.400]  of paper thin veiled statement there that's how dumb they think we are
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:18.960]  that's how control the fbi and cia and nsa and police are
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:22.240]  i've cornered the police chief here in austin and others and i've said you know
[02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:25.440]  about this stuff and they just go i just can't believe it and they have fear in
[02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:27.600]  their eyes i talked to the travis county swat team
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:31.040]  years ago and i said you know this stuff's going on they're like yeah we do
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:33.840]  and then of course they must have been under surveillance because they you know
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:40.480]  set them up and fired the leadership but you know what again at a certain point
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:46.480]  you've got to say no to this evil you've got to say no to it
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:50.560]  and you've got to get past your fear and own it and say i've made my decision
[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:54.080]  that's the end of it you do what you're going to do i leave it to god
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:59.120]  exactly what hoppy said it doesn't mean you don't do anything anymore
[02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:02.320]  it means you say i'm giving it to god and god you tell me what to do and take
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:04.880]  action on this and i don't want to start preaching i don't keep them right to the
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:07.360]  end of the show we have a 30 minute break and we're going to tape a long
[02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:10.480]  interview uh and uh you know recap everything tonight on the
[02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:14.240]  nightly news and get to some of those clips and documents but
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:18.160]  this is a decision you've got to make and if you think this is all there is in
[02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:24.000]  the world and it's all about tv dinners and beer and football games and you
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:27.280]  know what so what about those kids getting blown up and forget what the
[02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:31.760]  witnesses inside said the survivors you want to just own the lie take the
[02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:34.640]  great delusion and say oh we're a bunch of cooks
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:38.240]  you make your decision then you make your decision you'd be with the timid
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:41.520]  cowards and the people that go along with it
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:44.480]  i mean i understand the military mind that did this it's a gambit that's a
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:50.800]  3000 year old chess move from eastern uh what is persia today
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:56.800]  you sacrifice a pawn in an early move to manipulate your enemy into a larger
[02:37:56.800 --> 02:38:00.000]  stratagem to where you can defeat them and it's the old thing of send in a
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:03.600]  hundred cavalry to draw up the larger army they'll all be killed but you're
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:06.000]  going to you're going to save 10 000 of your troops
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.000]  in that move by killing a hundred but those are men that signed up to go
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:13.760]  and and and and and and die and it still
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:17.600]  really should not be part of the laws of war because once you do that
[02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:22.400]  well it's collateral damage yeah we'll kill a million iraqis for their oil
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:27.840]  why not kill the little children in that daycare center and make sure that bomb
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:32.560]  was parked right there and have their care people ready to get those shots
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:36.560]  when the heroes go in to save the kids and the and the murderers sit outside
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:40.160]  and even set up their own federal patsy mcvay gentlemen i'm going to shut up i
[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:44.080]  want to get into mcvay how this ran the affidavits by
[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:48.320]  nickles what we know the individuals orchestrating this who they plan to
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:51.360]  blame it on and of course thank god some of the bombs didn't go off
[02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:55.440]  because then their plan didn't go according to you know the the
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:59.840]  best laid plans of mice and men often
[02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:03.680]  go astray but i mean other points you want to make or speaking to why you've
[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:06.240]  gone public chris emory i mean you learned about
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:09.760]  oklahoma city and and and and have fought it and risked your
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:13.920]  life hoppy was in the middle of it and ran smack dab into the new world order
[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:17.200]  but i think that's a good place here hoppy why have you done what you've done
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:21.040]  versus other people you know we would call you exceptional i know you would
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:23.360]  just say you're a decent person who does what's right
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:26.800]  and and what's led you to do this chris and if you had any threats because i
[02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:30.240]  know you've talked to police officers and others that have been threatened
[02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:34.000]  great hoppy well i you know i just don't understand
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:41.200]  i guess i'm just built different but i don't understand people
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:45.760]  just look in the other way when something bad happens i just don't
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:50.880]  understand that i mean i wouldn't allow a child to be killed if
[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:55.520]  i was in the area and i saw a guy attacking a woman or a child
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:59.040]  i wouldn't have to know who they were to try to defend them
[02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:05.920]  i mean that's just something men do i i don't understand all of my fellow
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:11.680]  members of the grand jury i most of them did not have sufficient
[02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:17.200]  background information or intelligence to be on that jury and that's a
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:21.040]  different story but even the ones that did and
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:24.640]  there had to be somebody else on that smart enough to know what's going on
[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:28.720]  but they didn't dare stick their head up from behind the log
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:33.760]  and i just don't understand that because you know there's a little saying
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:38.560]  that's just simple as it can be you know that i've heard all my life
[02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:42.480]  all it takes for evil to triumph is for the good people to do nothing i mean
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:47.120]  that's a simple little saying but it's just as true as it can be
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:50.960]  and if if people will stand up and say hey
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:55.440]  i'm not going to put up with that then maybe somebody else will stand up and
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:59.120]  you did and pretty soon if you could get everybody to stand up
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:03.680]  you could make it work but there there just
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:09.680]  too many people out there that i don't know whether it's a lack of education
[02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:15.040]  a lack of genes genetic structure a lack of intelligence or what but i don't
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:18.640]  understand people that won't stand up for what's not right
[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:22.880]  well it's mind control it's the television i've told the story you see it
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:25.920]  all the time where a man dies of a heart attack or is dying in a
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:29.280]  in a walmart and people walk by him for an hour an austin cop
[02:41:29.280 --> 02:41:33.280]  got run over a few years ago and bled to death for over an hour and no one helped
[02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:36.080]  him i saw a woman choking once in a restaurant
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:39.920]  no one would help her and i had to push him out of the way through the heimlich
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:43.520]  and they were angry saying no wait for police and i'm like i didn't say hey
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:46.640]  idiot she's going to die before the police get here
[02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:51.360]  and i'm not exceptional i mean i i took swim team for four or five years and
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:54.720]  they had to fire department come by and you know uh for those that wanted to
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:57.520]  take it and took a basic life-saving thing i mean if i'm
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:00.880]  choking i want somebody to help me i mean americans didn't used to be like this
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:05.280]  they're in a trance hoppy uh comment on that or we'll get a
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:13.200]  comment from chris emory um cognitive dissonance is what i call it
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:18.080]  uh people are trained by the public school system
[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:23.600]  and other forces to accept certain things as
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:29.920]  absolute truths and anytime something doesn't fit
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:34.960]  inside that box their own personal box of absolute truths
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:38.960]  if it doesn't fit inside that they simply can't
[02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:44.080]  accept it now anybody that's gone to a concert
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:48.880]  and heard those instruments tuning up getting ready for the concert
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:53.520]  understands what dissonance is i mean it's the most terrible sound you've
[02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:56.640]  ever heard well actually each one of those
[02:42:56.640 --> 02:42:59.840]  instruments is playing what it's supposed to play
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:04.960]  there does not play in the same order so it's not till a concert starts and they
[02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:09.920]  all play in the same order that a understandable tune
[02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:15.120]  comes out of all those instruments and the same thing with information
[02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:20.000]  if you're not able to put together information
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:24.400]  then you'll never be able to hear the concert
[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:28.720]  all you're able to hear is the is the tuning up the dissonance
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:33.360]  and people that can't think outside the box as they say
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:37.280]  people that don't have the independent thought or the capacity
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:42.160]  to understand or the willingness to accept the truth and the bible says
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:44.800]  that nobody will believe the truth in the end
[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:52.000]  and i see that everywhere uh people it just they just can't do that
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:56.560]  and it's sad well i was about to add it's worse than that in many cases
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:59.920]  they know the information they think if they choose
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:03.920]  to say the government didn't carry out 9-11 or or or Oklahoma City
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:07.440]  or Gulf of Tonkin even though it's admitted to be staged that somehow that
[02:44:07.440 --> 02:44:11.040]  makes it true i've had engineers smart people
[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:15.040]  uh sit there and look me right in the eye you know they'll confront me first
[02:44:15.040 --> 02:44:18.960]  and say uh you know i like what you do in some areas but
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:21.760]  but you know it's impossible that the government can do 9-11 i said well
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:25.280]  what about Tuskegee experiment all this what about this evidence of 9-11 he
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:28.720]  said oh i hear what you're saying but i choose not to believe it
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:32.320]  do you understand what i'm saying and i said yeah i understand you think you
[02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:39.280]  just make a decision and that that you know that makes it so i mean that is
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:42.640]  that is willful mind control and that is cowards
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:46.560]  that are so cowardly at least a run of the mill coward says i'm a coward
[02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:50.320]  i'm gonna run from this evil and you know go hide in your shame i i get that i
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:54.240]  mean i'm not even mad at those people okay you're scared you're scared of the
[02:44:54.240 --> 02:44:57.360]  scary men coming and getting you hey you're gonna die anyways but nobody's
[02:44:57.360 --> 02:44:59.600]  gonna live forever i'm not gonna live on my knees
[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:03.520]  i but i'm not mad at a straight-up coward but these people these men and
[02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:07.040]  women that are so cowardly they do a mind flip
[02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:10.720]  and say i just choose not to believe it that is a coward's coward
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:13.920]  chris emory your comments on why you've done what you've done
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:17.520]  right after i had met with craig roberts he gave me a set of blueprints that
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:21.680]  southwestern bill had supplied to a lot of the um litigants the people that
[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:24.480]  were suing for insurance claims and so forth
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:29.440]  and on the second floor what convinced me to really push ahead on this was
[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:34.160]  there was a a layout of the deceased and it listed four babies in cribs against
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:36.320]  the front window they were less than four months
[02:45:36.320 --> 02:45:39.040]  old and as the saying goes here in oklahoma city
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:42.480]  oh hell no we're not going to give up until we find out what happened
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:45.360]  who butchered these kids who killed these people when they were going about
[02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:48.720]  their business on a normal work day and yanked them out of this life and the
[02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:51.600]  life hereafter and they dared to lie about this
[02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:55.040]  we're better than that and it's people like hoppy and yourself the guys in my
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:57.680]  film crew i'm really proud to to be able to work with you
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:02.960]  and this is this is a true american here absolutely and if you look at it
[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:06.640]  what we do now is going to be a testament to future generations
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:11.040]  and the fact that we've exposed oklahoma city hoppy from day one
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:14.640]  and general part and others and and and jane graham and the victims
[02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:17.760]  the fact that we've exposed other false flags they're always trying to
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:20.720]  resuscitate it but once the genie's out of the bottle
[02:46:20.720 --> 02:46:24.800]  look at what happened with kurt haskell and his wife both lawyers
[02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:29.280]  they see a sharp-dressed guy getting the underwear bomber christmas day guy on
[02:46:29.280 --> 02:46:32.400]  the plane arguing demanding and so powerful
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:35.200]  he was able to order security to let him on without a passport
[02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:38.800]  then they witnessed the whole thing happen they tell the public the media
[02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:42.320]  says they're full of it and then later the state department admits
[02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:45.280]  yeah the u.s government ordered us to help get him on the plane
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:49.760]  i mean the fact is is we are people who are awake and love the truth we're
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:53.520]  everywhere now and when you murderers try to nuke something or
[02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:56.160]  blow something up and dance around as our saviors
[02:46:56.160 --> 02:46:59.920]  everybody knows where to look we know about your lies about wmd's
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:04.800]  we know about you now robin cook uh in england went public with the lies
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:07.840]  saying not 11 was staged they killed him right after that
[02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:12.320]  in england i mean the point is that we are exposing one of their favorite
[02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:15.680]  tricks and they don't like it
[02:47:15.680 --> 02:47:21.520]  you got any other comments no i you're right on the money elix
[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:25.040]  there is only one other thing i would say but i don't know what much time we
[02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:29.680]  have plenty of time okay the second point
[02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:36.240]  that general parton made that's easily understood and very important
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:42.640]  when you when blast pressure pushes when blast pressure pushes against a steel
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:46.720]  reinforced column and it pushes that column over
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:53.440]  it does break the concrete but it only bends the steel bars
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:48:00.800]  inside the concrete if the columns in oklahoma city
[02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:07.440]  had been downed by blast pressure the reinforcing steel rods
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:13.200]  inside those columns would still be there and just bent over
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:16.800]  parton said those steel rods had been cut
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:20.400]  you see the blast points only imperial storm trippers are so precise
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:24.000]  yeah so there's no there's a big difference and i do this in a
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:29.040]  demonstration sometimes i'll take two pencils i'll break one with my hands i'll
[02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:32.800]  saw one in half with it with a little uh
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:40.000]  paxall blade and i will ask anybody in the audience if they could not
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:44.000]  put those halves back together again correctly
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:47.840]  and everybody you mean you can look and see which one
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:53.600]  that's that i brought with my hands because it's so irregular and so
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:56.880]  shattered looking and then the one that i cut is so smooth
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:01.840]  it's anybody can put that back together and why anybody can't understand
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:05.600]  that when those columns when that steel
[02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:09.200]  rebar inside the column was actually cut
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:12.320]  those had to be cutting charges on the column itself
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:16.320]  that was not blast pressure and well you can see the video in the photos there's
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:21.040]  even blast points right there um expanding on that
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:26.080]  why why do you think from your deep research chris and hoppy
[02:49:26.080 --> 02:49:28.480]  why didn't they just go with the truck bomb that probably would have killed
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:31.120]  some of the kids and then you know still good for them
[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:34.400]  to be able to get our guns and demonize patriots and blaming on us
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:38.000]  and make people forget about wake up but but but but why
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:41.520]  why have them going and wire it all up and all that i mean i guess they just
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:44.160]  wanted to kill more federal federal employees
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:48.320]  well because of 93 see they weren't careful enough they weren't fair enough
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:51.680]  in 93 and they didn't get the terrorist bill passed
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:57.040]  so they planned if every bomb that was inside the building would have gone off
[02:49:57.040 --> 02:49:59.840]  it would probably have leveled the whole building and that's what they were
[02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:04.080]  looking to do because they were looking for maximum body count
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:09.280]  to get the legislation passed there was a an officer with army cid
[02:50:09.280 --> 02:50:12.800]  we couldn't get him on uh it's it's basically the military version of the
[02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:16.720]  fbi we couldn't get him on camera he refused to talk but he did
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:19.760]  relay this to a member of the bombing committee right after the bombing
[02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:23.040]  committee was formed that he showed up on the crime scene within about three
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:27.600]  hours he was given his id in a hard hat and he started asking questions to atf
[02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:31.760]  an fbi once they knew that he was there to look at it objectively
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:35.360]  that was his job in the vietnam war he had to assess bomb damage
[02:50:35.360 --> 02:50:38.560]  and they kicked him off they said don't you say a word we know where your
[02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:42.480]  daughter goes to school we know where your wife works and that was it
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:45.760]  yeah right there you know where my daughter works well you didn't i mean
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:50.160]  right then man i tell you what just scum filth of the earth
[02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:53.760]  and they ship guns into mexico to blame the second amendment our government is

[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:23.200]  one other point i want to bring up i was hopping over just discussing this
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:26.960]  uh during break howard superior was the gentleman that was calling for another
[02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:30.480]  oakland city bombing i believe recently and in the last year or so
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:33.280]  he actually served in the city council here in oakland city for a while was

[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:42.640]  director larry potz with igi while igi is pretty much a hit squad it's
[02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:45.680]  it's uh retired we know this and i have no problem saying this on the air
[02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:49.760]  retired fbi agents folks that pretty much went off uh off the
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:53.840]  the script and uh they had an office down here in oakland city
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:57.600]  howard superior will work for that firm and so you you see how these people
[02:56:57.600 --> 02:57:02.880]  just have a they're circling back they have it boils down to they have no
[02:57:02.880 --> 02:57:06.400]  regard for human life that's who we're dealing with all the time here in oakland
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:10.240]  city alex trying to research his case uh so i empathize with you when you get

[02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:18.000]  and it's it's plain as day this is a poorly written script for a
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:23.520]  a uh the twilight zone a movie and they just they never say cut the tape
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:28.720]  keeps rolling it always that's the way it is and only our denial empowers it as
[02:57:28.720 --> 02:57:32.720]  hoppy said evil men and tyrants flourish when good men and women do nothing
[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:37.360]  that's all they need to flourish and we empower them by our cowardice by our
[02:57:37.360 --> 02:57:42.080]  weakness by our laziness and it's going to get and you're right people
[02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:47.120]  connected to it are i think we're so dumb hoppy that that they sit there and go
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:50.960]  man a new Oklahoma city would sure help us in the biggest newspapers in the

[02:58:14.400 --> 02:58:17.840]  bright people and it never occurred to me that they
[02:58:17.840 --> 02:58:21.360]  wouldn't be smart enough to figure out what i was telling them
[02:58:21.360 --> 02:58:25.280]  and i was shocked when they didn't believe a word i said
[02:58:25.280 --> 02:58:31.600]  well no no they were smart enough to lie to themselves because they're cowards
