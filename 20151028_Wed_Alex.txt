[01:14.680 --> 01:19.080]  back to John Locke Enlightenment philosopher and the father of classical
[01:19.080 --> 01:24.520]  liberalism Sir William Blackstone 18th century judge and politician described
[01:24.520 --> 01:28.480]  this right as an auxiliary right supporting the natural rights of

[03:15.440 --> 03:19.920]  in attitude toward firearms I just returned from a gun rights meeting in
[03:19.920 --> 03:23.720]  Belgium and I can attest that all over Europe people now want the means to

[04:01.720 --> 04:06.760]  compassionate migration what we are observing and experiencing worldwide is
[04:06.760 --> 04:11.760]  a coordinated shift away from developed countries operated by republics where

[08:16.560 --> 08:27.360]  radio network
[08:27.360 --> 08:32.560]  well it's being called the most serious military confrontations with China
[08:32.560 --> 08:38.960]  since the Korean War we're trying to use North Korea as their proxy the
[08:38.960 --> 08:43.880]  situation in the South China Sea and the Spratly Islands China basically
[08:43.880 --> 08:47.000]  threatening military action if any aircraft or ships come back through
[08:47.000 --> 08:53.040]  that area the United States is promising to do just that we have big
[08:53.040 --> 08:57.000]  developments in Ukraine huge developments in Syria across the board the
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.400]  world is moving into deepening crises but our top stories today deal with
[09:03.400 --> 09:11.240]  political correctness because this is the true cultural conscious tyranny that
[09:11.240 --> 09:17.440]  is meant to end free speech as we know it and demonize all human activity then
[09:17.440 --> 09:25.680]  laws are to be passed restricting banning fining feeing demonizing anyone
[09:25.680 --> 09:32.960]  that dare questions the official narrative these are just some of the
[09:32.960 --> 09:40.480]  politically correct headlines today 5 plus 5 plus 5 equals 15 is wrong the
[09:40.480 --> 09:46.360]  equivalent of saying 2 plus 2 equals 4 is wrong according to common core you
[09:46.360 --> 09:55.560]  must add it up 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 equals 4 not 2 plus 2 they tell you how
[09:55.560 --> 10:00.280]  to do the math and make it as confusing as possible and as illogical as possible
[10:00.280 --> 10:08.760]  as the test scores continue to drop 5 plus 5 plus 5 equals 15 is wrong it
[10:08.760 --> 10:14.880]  needs to be 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 parents outraged after student penalized
[10:14.880 --> 10:20.760]  for correctly answering math questions and the school is defending it this is
[10:20.760 --> 10:27.920]  not the onion this is not satire Walmart after one tweet complained of
[10:27.920 --> 10:33.720]  Israeli soldier costume being sold and they sell a bunch of other military
[10:33.720 --> 10:38.680]  costumes there's nothing to do with racism after one complaint saying in
[10:38.680 --> 10:45.680]  Israeli uniform is racist just just just the existence of it Walmart has
[10:45.680 --> 10:51.000]  banned it and again the big corporations always bow down to political
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.520]  correctness because it's it's their culture of oppression and so they want
[10:54.520 --> 10:59.040]  to show how much power you have when you engage in political correctness and then
[10:59.040 --> 11:05.800]  that dovetails with this CNN report the article on common core is at info wars
[11:05.800 --> 11:11.840]  dot com CNN what's wrong with this Caitlyn Jenner Halloween costume and it
[11:11.840 --> 11:18.360]  says the best-selling Halloween costume is Caitlyn Jenner and that it's
[11:18.360 --> 11:24.200]  transphobic really I mean I could be Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton Barack
[11:24.200 --> 11:29.240]  Obama for Halloween wouldn't mean I was being racist or anti-woman or
[11:29.240 --> 11:34.360]  anti-man whatever the big topic of the year is that ends up being the top
[11:34.360 --> 11:42.200]  Hollywood pitch in the type of shows they produce the movies they make South
[11:42.200 --> 11:46.000]  Park the Simpsons they've all been making fun of Caitlyn Jenner are they
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.160]  being transphobic but it doesn't matter you're allowed to say you don't like the
[11:50.160 --> 11:56.800]  hype of the brave wondrous beautiful fantastic Caitlyn Jenner I mean it's
[11:56.800 --> 12:03.800]  all a Kardashian stunt I'm sick of the Kardashians being force-fed and it's
[12:03.800 --> 12:09.160]  not that I find Kim Kardashian ugly I don't find her the most beautiful I'm
[12:09.160 --> 12:15.440]  just sick of the force-feeding my kids will be into a fad my daughters will be
[12:15.440 --> 12:19.520]  into a fad for six months then after that they're sick of it too they were into
[12:19.520 --> 12:24.480]  Frozen they watched it three times they wanted the lunchboxes last year now I
[12:24.480 --> 12:31.120]  can chase them around the house with a Disney coloring book people say I
[12:31.120 --> 12:34.320]  thought you don't support Disney and boycott them I've said I try to stay
[12:34.320 --> 12:39.520]  away from it now because of their open anti-gun stance and their captain
[12:39.520 --> 12:42.760]  America going after the Tea Party and the rest of it yes I there is a total
[12:42.760 --> 12:48.200]  boycott on for Disney productions and products unless I'm going to see one with
[12:48.200 --> 12:57.440]  the crew to analyze it but let's shift gears off of that now it's hateful if
[12:57.440 --> 13:04.120]  you are Caitlyn Jenner I've never been in drag in my life but if it illustrates
[13:04.120 --> 13:07.280]  something I might just do it I'm thinking about I was talking about it
[13:07.280 --> 13:15.200]  this morning with my personal trainer I might actually put a beard on to make it
[13:15.200 --> 13:19.280]  even more obnoxious like police academy and I may actually go out on the streets
[13:19.280 --> 13:25.240]  of Austin on Halloween night as Caitlyn Jones and then demand that I be given an
[13:25.240 --> 13:30.800]  ESPN courage award how'd that work out for ESPN they just laid off 300 people
[13:30.800 --> 13:36.680]  their ratings are suddenly plunging in the last two months and it's not just the
[13:36.680 --> 13:41.520]  number of homes there in where people are unsubscribing see people want to even
[13:41.520 --> 13:44.920]  though sports is a controlled paradigm even though sports has become the new
[13:44.920 --> 13:50.480]  religion at least people are competing and at least it's about human focus will
[13:50.480 --> 13:56.560]  and endurance and it is a very masculine field as well but they've tried to
[13:56.560 --> 14:00.760]  demonize and feminize but women themselves want to go watch men play
[14:00.760 --> 14:05.520]  more than female sports I personally like women playing volleyball and tennis
[14:05.520 --> 14:09.320]  and things like that I'll be honest that's the kind of sports I personally
[14:09.320 --> 14:15.280]  like to watch but most my buddies like to watch football NHL you know stuff like
[14:15.280 --> 14:18.520]  that basketball and I like basketball because it's more entertaining it's
[14:18.520 --> 14:24.200]  fast-moving what I'm getting at here is that people don't want to see a courage
[14:24.200 --> 14:30.240]  award be given to Caitlyn Jenner not because he was an Olympic athlete
[14:30.240 --> 14:38.840]  decades ago but because he put a wig on I mean I'm sorry it isn't that he thinks
[14:38.840 --> 14:43.400]  he's a woman I personally care less it's that he looks like a barracuda crossed
[14:43.400 --> 14:50.960]  with a stamping turtle wearing a wig and so if they gave Marilyn Monroe a
[14:50.960 --> 14:56.240]  lifetime achievement award for courage what did she do that took courage I find
[14:56.240 --> 15:01.880]  Marilyn Monroe very attractive in her heyday it's just it's just sick how
[15:01.880 --> 15:08.440]  everything is so rigged and and now they bombard us with this and then when
[15:08.440 --> 15:12.160]  people make a joke out of it they say oh you're in trouble it's kind of like
[15:12.160 --> 15:17.000]  that Melissa Harris Perry clip in fact let's cue that back up that we played
[15:17.000 --> 15:24.560]  so much yesterday where they've got the pundits on the show saying Paul Ryan's
[15:24.560 --> 15:27.760]  a great speaker it's good that Democrats are supporting him no it's not
[15:27.760 --> 15:34.840]  Nancy Pelosi Harry Reid the usual suspects Barack Obama he's a really great
[15:34.840 --> 15:39.600]  guy and he's also a hard worker to get legislation passed and Melissa Harris
[15:39.600 --> 15:44.240]  Perry says whoa whoa whoa let's talk about racism here and that blacks were
[15:44.240 --> 15:49.720]  slaves that's the hard work going on here just injecting racial division and
[15:49.720 --> 15:57.160]  racial slavery identity on to anybody and everybody there's a new video up on
[15:57.160 --> 16:04.320]  info wars.com that Paul Watson wrote about and it's too arrogant new black
[16:04.320 --> 16:12.600]  Panther Party type guys in their military outfits harassing what looks like a
[16:12.600 --> 16:21.240]  20-year-old Japanese tourist and telling her she's racist into they will
[16:21.240 --> 16:28.400]  physically attack her if she uses the word that none there speak the n-word
[16:28.400 --> 16:36.440]  that were bombarded with by gangster hip-hop culture and of course Japan the
[16:36.440 --> 16:41.320]  Japanese have anything to do with black slavery Japanese women particularly are
[16:41.320 --> 16:47.560]  stereotypically sweet and nice Japan has the lowest crime rate in the world even
[16:47.560 --> 16:54.280]  safer than Switzerland that has the lowest crime rate in Europe when there's
[16:54.280 --> 16:58.560]  an earthquake or a fire there's even less crime that there's almost no crime in
[16:58.560 --> 17:06.200]  Japan the Japanese are all about not insulting anybody this woman doesn't
[17:06.200 --> 17:13.200]  speak a word of English and they keep saying are we the n-words and she all
[17:13.200 --> 17:17.240]  she knows is hip-hop culture that's super popular in Japan and she's like yeah
[17:17.240 --> 17:22.800]  yeah I'm your friend she's obviously wanting to be picked up she obviously
[17:22.800 --> 17:26.440]  thinks it's really cool that there's guys in camo then they start saying we're
[17:26.440 --> 17:33.680]  gonna physically attack you and point their fingers so she leaves see how
[17:33.680 --> 17:37.000]  this Melissa Harris Perry stuff gets projected on everything Paul Ryan's a
[17:37.000 --> 17:40.520]  hard worker he'll get lots of stuff passed for the Democrats yeah but let's
[17:40.520 --> 17:47.520]  not forget white slavery as if a white man could be a hard worker this is an
[17:47.520 --> 17:52.360]  entire cultural chip on the shoulder takeover where people don't know history
[17:52.360 --> 17:58.400]  reading writing arithmetic basic social skills they just know how to get
[17:58.400 --> 18:02.640]  lectured by Melissa Harris Perry who wants to ban our guns says you're racist
[18:02.640 --> 18:06.840]  if you don't support Obamacare and the end here's the final equation she knows
[18:06.840 --> 18:18.240]  full well what she's doing I mean she is really screwing her audience over so
[18:18.240 --> 18:23.640]  now hard worker means that you're demeaning black slaves so no one can
[18:23.640 --> 18:27.960]  ever be a hard worker no one can ever succeed in anything because the world is
[18:27.960 --> 18:39.040]  stopped in 1865 in a few southern states forever every few weeks I see in
[18:39.040 --> 18:45.960]  St. Louis and surrounding areas where there's these communities of Eastern
[18:45.960 --> 18:50.320]  Europeans that never hardly saw a black person where they're from certainly
[18:50.320 --> 18:55.520]  didn't only slaves they were all surfs just 150 years ago themselves slaves and
[18:55.520 --> 18:59.360]  they get shot they get killed and the people it's doing it say because you're
[18:59.360 --> 19:06.120]  white slaves I mean this is crazy town we're gonna skip this network break I'm
[19:06.120 --> 19:08.640]  getting better about not doing this but I'm skipping this one because I want to
[19:08.640 --> 19:14.600]  play this Melissa Harris Perry clip just one more time before I get back into the
[19:14.600 --> 19:19.880]  latest news here it is but let's be fair if there's somebody who is a hard worker
[19:19.880 --> 19:24.400]  he goes to Washington is Paul Ryan not only works the Republicans but Democrats
[19:24.400 --> 19:27.160]  you know it's what very well that I work on the immigration issue trying to get
[19:27.160 --> 19:30.240]  Republicans to support immigration reform Paul Ryan is somebody who has
[19:30.240 --> 19:33.360]  supported immigration reform has to work with somebody like Luis Gutierrez
[19:33.360 --> 19:37.240]  Luis Gutierrez is very respectful speaks highly of Paul Ryan this is
[19:37.240 --> 19:41.560]  somebody who's trying to govern I feel you but but I just want I just want to
[19:41.560 --> 19:44.800]  pause on one thing because I don't disagree with you that I actually think Mr.
[19:44.800 --> 19:48.520]  Ryan is a great choice for this role but I want us to be super careful when we
[19:48.520 --> 19:54.880]  use the language hard worker because I mean I actually keep an image of folks
[19:54.880 --> 20:00.040]  working in cotton fields on my office wall it was a reminder back up to the
[20:00.040 --> 20:09.200]  start of her again understand she is claiming territorial control 360 domination
[20:09.200 --> 20:16.320]  of all language she is claiming territorial control over any language
[20:16.320 --> 20:23.400]  you use anything you say until there is no speech and that's what Atlantic
[20:23.400 --> 20:29.000]  Monthly and Jerry Seinfeld and countless other liberals have pointed out is that
[20:29.000 --> 20:35.160]  there basically is no free speech now on these campuses and the young people are
[20:35.160 --> 20:40.520]  competing with each other to see who can destroy more language who can call
[20:40.520 --> 20:45.680]  people out who can dominate and control it's a bunch of bullies ignorant
[20:45.680 --> 20:50.960]  bullies of every race color and creed who have joined this political correctness
[20:50.960 --> 20:56.040]  cult and now it's going into overdrive you're not going to dress as Caitlyn
[20:56.040 --> 21:03.000]  Jenner well that's it I am you are not going to use brown paper bags yes I am
[21:03.000 --> 21:09.240]  you are not going to use the word mother or father yes I am you are not going to
[21:09.240 --> 21:12.440]  defend yourself yes I am you are not going to criticize Obamacare we'll
[21:12.440 --> 21:17.680]  call you racist well you know what go ahead I don't care they have a new
[21:17.680 --> 21:23.840]  giant article I'm going to cover in the next segment out from the Southern
[21:23.840 --> 21:28.920]  Poverty Law Center demonizing the conspiracy myths and bemoaning how
[21:28.920 --> 21:34.520]  dangerous they are and how they're taking over why the imaginary situation of
[21:34.520 --> 21:45.680]  agenda 21 it's called margins to the mainstream the imaginary paradigm that
[21:45.680 --> 21:51.400]  there is an agenda 21 restrict resources the imaginary conspiracy theory
[21:51.400 --> 21:58.480]  that there is a move to go after the right to keep bare arms and you read it
[21:58.480 --> 22:06.040]  they're trying to begin buffalo reality buffalo the police departments and sit
[22:06.040 --> 22:09.760]  there with a straight face and say they're worried armored vehicles are
[22:09.760 --> 22:19.200]  being delivered to fight the tea party and gun owners they're worried that
[22:19.200 --> 22:23.040]  there's a move to restrict American energy they're worried there's a plan to
[22:23.040 --> 22:26.760]  come after their guns they're worried that common core is meant to dumb their
[22:26.760 --> 22:31.880]  kids down they admit that's what it's meant to do and create compliant
[22:31.880 --> 22:37.200]  servile people that don't have common sense so let's go back to Melissa Harris
[22:37.200 --> 22:42.760]  Perry the one that says your kids belong to her and then they do they're
[22:42.760 --> 22:46.560]  teaching kids as young as five how to not be male or female and how it's bad to
[22:46.560 --> 22:51.760]  have a mommy or daddy or say boy or girl or he or she they are putting in the
[22:51.760 --> 22:55.400]  weird transgender bathrooms to confuse everyone and make that the center of
[22:55.400 --> 22:59.640]  life debating that and confusing children they're giving your children
[22:59.640 --> 23:02.880]  forced inoculations without parental consent they're giving them abortions
[23:02.880 --> 23:06.720]  without parental consent many areas but you got to fill out a consent form to go
[23:06.720 --> 23:14.840]  to the planetarium or the zoo or to the lake or to the park or to the museum so
[23:14.840 --> 23:19.640]  they are our conquerors when you look at Melissa Harris Perry it's not that she's
[23:19.640 --> 23:27.000]  strong it's that we're weak that we would let a sharp-eyed aggressive mafia
[23:27.000 --> 23:36.520]  done a maven of language death of cultural death a purveyor of dark age a
[23:36.520 --> 23:47.200]  purveyor of destruction of freedom a pusher of 21st century book burning the
[23:47.200 --> 23:54.120]  very annihilation of the language itself true in sock reducing it reducing the
[23:54.120 --> 24:03.160]  IQs reducing the minds reducing the semantical lexicon until rebellion
[24:03.160 --> 24:08.640]  against the globalist would be as unthinkable as sheep rebelling against
[24:08.640 --> 24:15.400]  the practice of eating mutton and with the dumb down kids out there today you
[24:15.400 --> 24:20.600]  try to tell some 18-year-old that quote from Bertrand Russell who they call a
[24:20.600 --> 24:26.240]  liberal and they don't even know what mutton is so let me translate it for
[24:26.240 --> 24:29.600]  them they'll dumb you down so far where you can't even understand what I'm
[24:29.600 --> 24:35.840]  saying and all you do is cynically laugh at it because you've been given a
[24:36.880 --> 24:43.520]  hypnotic programming suggestion to laugh at your own destruction and to laugh at
[24:43.520 --> 24:48.480]  your own stupidity and so for you to stand up against your own enslavement
[24:48.480 --> 24:54.240]  would be as ridiculous a sheep fighting back against the rancher when he takes
[24:54.240 --> 24:58.040]  them in yearly to pick the ones that are going to be slaughtered because they're
[24:58.040 --> 25:01.960]  sheep you can't communicate with them they're not human they don't understand
[25:01.960 --> 25:07.880]  complex issues and they follow their little leader who's the Judas sheep the
[25:07.880 --> 25:12.600]  Judas goat who's trained to lead them into the pin even though they hear the
[25:12.600 --> 25:17.240]  screaming they smell the blood they smell the urine they smell the pheromones
[25:17.240 --> 25:22.440]  of sheep being hauled up by their hind legs and having their throat slit before
[25:22.440 --> 25:29.080]  they're butchered they still will follow that leader the biggest the strongest
[25:29.080 --> 25:33.320]  that every year they trust that leads them when the food gets put out that
[25:33.320 --> 25:39.040]  leads them away when the wolf shows up they follow that Judas goat Melissa
[25:39.040 --> 25:43.640]  Harris Perry Barack Hussein Obama Michael Moore to the end because it feels
[25:43.640 --> 25:49.480]  good they like being chumps they like being failures they like their
[25:49.480 --> 25:53.800]  unemployment doubling in six years they like being fed fluoride and cancer
[25:53.800 --> 26:01.400]  viruses they like GMO they like dying every few days I hear some parent I was
[26:01.400 --> 26:10.320]  at the gym yesterday and I heard somebody talking going oh it's terrible oh
[26:10.320 --> 26:16.920]  my gosh and then the ladies friend said what happened oh such and such as baby
[26:16.920 --> 26:23.600]  just died it was it was just a year old and it died yeah she she's written a
[26:23.600 --> 26:29.400]  letter to everybody about it it died of SIDS and I couldn't help but I said oh
[26:29.400 --> 26:31.840]  you know they're not supposed to really die of that after a few months and I
[26:31.840 --> 26:36.680]  said that didn't exist till the 80s they used to take people's kids they should
[26:36.680 --> 26:39.960]  take people's other children when they had a sudden infant death they claim it
[26:39.960 --> 26:42.880]  was shaken baby remember that they go yeah you don't hear about that anymore
[26:42.880 --> 26:48.760]  first I get them to admit to something that they know I go yeah you want to ask
[26:48.760 --> 26:53.280]  them if they went in for their second round of shots then because you know
[26:53.280 --> 26:58.840]  SIDS is closely associated in Australian government studies and others with the
[26:58.840 --> 27:04.800]  sudden death and one woman goes yeah I think I've heard about that I said
[27:04.800 --> 27:08.480]  yeah I don't mean to get in your business you're just talking about a dead
[27:08.480 --> 27:15.760]  baby you might want to look into it for yourself and warn some people and all
[27:15.760 --> 27:21.040]  the time I hear people talking about yeah I talked to Bob and there he hadn't
[27:21.040 --> 27:26.440]  been to working about a week yeah they're their babies in the hospital I'll
[27:26.440 --> 27:32.520]  say how old's that baby is the toddler yeah 18 months well yeah they did say
[27:32.520 --> 27:39.920]  that well how do you know that and I said how do I know that I said you better
[27:39.920 --> 27:48.160]  look into most autistic children or boys about 80% roughly 81% putting on the
[27:48.160 --> 27:56.800]  country and they almost always go into the autistic decline at 18 months after
[27:56.800 --> 28:02.440]  they don't talk for a few days and lay in bed the hospital if you take them
[28:02.440 --> 28:06.360]  right back they'll say oh that's just a normal side effect just keep them in
[28:06.360 --> 28:09.760]  bed they're gonna be fine while that brain swells up and it bleeds in there
[28:09.760 --> 28:18.000]  getting that lobotomy feels real good we've had the nurses on it's come out
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.120]  in the news as well that they get those er's ready with those preemie seven
[28:23.120 --> 28:25.920]  months eight months six months they're fine they're breathing they're getting
[28:25.920 --> 28:29.760]  better and after they're there a couple days two days the doctor comes in and
[28:29.760 --> 28:34.760]  says it's time to give them the inoculations full regimen seven shots
[28:34.760 --> 28:41.400]  and the nurses beg they say doctor go back to the bioethics board they're
[28:41.400 --> 28:47.640]  gonna stop breathing some are gonna die and the doctor says you know policy and
[28:47.640 --> 28:51.540]  they get in their shots at some some die on the spot others go on the
[28:51.540 --> 28:57.120]  respirators but a lot of them can't make it because we're a loving country we're
[28:57.120 --> 29:03.520]  a good country and Melissa Harris Perry let's let's have her take us out to
[29:03.520 --> 29:08.080]  break teaching us about the slaves when we're all slaves here she is I feel you
[29:08.080 --> 29:11.520]  but I just want I just want to pause on one thing because I don't disagree with
[29:11.520 --> 29:15.280]  you that I actually think mr. Ryan is a great choice for this role but I want us
[29:15.280 --> 29:19.480]  to be super careful when we use the language hard or come back by the
[29:19.480 --> 29:22.960]  whole thing I did but just everything is a globalist attack pattern you got to
[29:22.960 --> 29:26.160]  be super careful about what language you use your self-censor everything's evil
[29:26.160 --> 29:30.120]  just shut up and don't talk only say what she says and she talks about the
[29:30.120 --> 29:33.720]  role he's playing we he's an operative playing a role to keep the
[29:33.720 --> 29:36.800]  republicans suppressed for their takeover but he's also got to play the
[29:36.800 --> 29:40.360]  role the evil white male so we've got to inject we hear about a white person
[29:40.360 --> 29:49.540]  slavery to keep blacks on the plantation here we go we're on the march the
[29:49.540 --> 29:56.480]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.120 --> 30:02.800]  while many restaurants are cracking down on patrons who pack heat one
[30:02.800 --> 30:06.920]  restaurant is giving discounts to concealed carriers following a robbery
[30:06.920 --> 30:11.720]  paparou owner Art Bouvier announced on Facebook Saturday night that an armed
[30:11.720 --> 30:15.600]  robber had walked in threatened his employees and stolen money I have a
[30:15.600 --> 30:19.440]  gun and I'm going to need all the money out of your registers the robber said
[30:19.440 --> 30:23.640]  after the thief had made off with the money the owner took to social media to
[30:23.640 --> 30:28.000]  announce that until further notice your concealed carry license earns you 25
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.440]  percent off your meal when you dine in he went on to say these folks are our
[30:32.440 --> 30:36.400]  extended family and I do not take kindly to them being harassed in this
[30:36.400 --> 30:40.440]  manner hoping to thwart future robberies Bouvier stated that he would use
[30:40.440 --> 30:44.400]  every tricky nose to protect his extended family and reiterated the
[30:44.400 --> 30:49.400]  decision is his to make he was quoted stating my restaurant my wall my
[30:49.400 --> 30:53.400]  business I can give discounts to whomever I please you can find more

[34:01.240 --> 34:07.240]  Jones coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas Austin and I'm gonna try
[34:07.240 --> 34:13.440]  to get to this in the final segment of this hour it's gotta be well it's 60
[34:13.440 --> 34:19.640]  pages long margins to the mainstream by Mark Potock that's the director of
[34:19.640 --> 34:26.240]  the Southern Poverty Law Center under the founder and Don Terry and it is the
[34:26.240 --> 34:31.120]  script with which you will hear all other media that is establishment and
[34:31.120 --> 34:36.080]  the police that have been federalized will use against us and it is
[34:36.080 --> 34:44.040]  incredible it says no one's coming for your guns there is no agenda 21 just
[34:44.040 --> 34:49.200]  none of it's true but it's got some great graphics they put together for it
[34:49.200 --> 34:53.160]  that we're going to use as part of satire and add our own text to in the
[34:53.160 --> 34:57.080]  next week and cover but there's no world government the federal reserves not
[34:57.080 --> 35:02.560]  private it's not giving trillions to insiders but what's crazy is all of this
[35:02.560 --> 35:06.920]  is now come out we've been vindicated the reason we've gone from the margins
[35:06.920 --> 35:12.960]  to the mainstream is because everyone's seen the common core handouts in a
[35:12.960 --> 35:17.320]  whole bunch of different states that say two plus two equals five fuzzy math
[35:17.320 --> 35:20.760]  everybody's heard Obama say you didn't build your business everybody's heard
[35:20.760 --> 35:25.480]  him say they want to ban all our guns then they go in to say that I said that
[35:25.480 --> 35:31.720]  martial law would happen during Jade Hill and then I was discredited but they
[35:31.720 --> 35:36.160]  don't have any quotes of me saying it or video
[35:39.080 --> 35:42.920]  we talked about how they're continuing to try to train our military to take on
[35:42.920 --> 35:48.560]  American people and that's admitted then they say the NAU is Mexico and Canada
[35:48.560 --> 35:52.520]  conquering the US and destroying it we don't say that we say all of our
[35:52.520 --> 35:58.400]  countries are being conquered by offshore globalist via secret treaties and see
[35:58.400 --> 36:03.040]  that's even in Rolling Stone and Town Hall and the Wall Street Journal and the
[36:03.040 --> 36:08.600]  Financial Times the truth is we're the tip of the spear and not in full wars
[36:08.600 --> 36:12.960]  calm or drudge report calm or world that daily calm I'm not saying we're the end
[36:12.960 --> 36:16.880]  all be all but we're at the tip of the spear with you the people they didn't go
[36:16.880 --> 36:21.200]  on to say there's not a move for Sharia law in Europe of this country they then
[36:21.200 --> 36:25.280]  say there's not a move to bring in radical Islamists for Balkanization when
[36:25.280 --> 36:31.560]  you all look at the news in Europe millions total badland record rapes I
[36:31.560 --> 36:37.160]  mean you know in many areas the Middle East it is the culture that if a woman
[36:37.160 --> 36:41.400]  doesn't have a hood on her head you're allowed to rape her in Saudi Arabia you
[36:41.400 --> 36:48.160]  can rape a woman a man's wife and if he doesn't follow complaint the woman goes
[36:48.160 --> 36:56.080]  to jail but the feminists don't say a word they come out and criticize us and
[36:56.080 --> 37:02.360]  call us Islamophobic these people are sick they hate the West and they are
[37:02.360 --> 37:10.320]  despicable look into okc in Elohim City and the lawsuits and what came out in
[37:10.320 --> 37:18.560]  court with Jesse Trinadu investigating his dead brother and Carol Howell the FBI
[37:18.560 --> 37:24.120]  informed in Elohim City you want to know how deep the rabbit hole goes southern
[37:24.120 --> 37:29.480]  poverty law centers more than meets the eye they're not a bunch of trendy
[37:29.480 --> 37:36.320]  liberals out there trying to stop racism they're a hardcore brigade meant to
[37:36.320 --> 37:39.960]  bring down free speech of this country in our second amendment and meant to
[37:39.960 --> 37:43.240]  identify millions of veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians and
[37:43.240 --> 37:48.800]  Christians to lock us up during a civil war they mean business and then they
[37:48.800 --> 37:54.840]  need to be watched very closely so that's coming up
[37:54.840 --> 38:02.080]  Leanne McAdoo will be popping in during the fourth hour with David Knight she's
[38:02.080 --> 38:05.640]  followed a bunch of very important reports that are up on info wars.com
[38:05.640 --> 38:12.560]  and prisonplanet.com and she joins us from outside St. Louis where they have
[38:12.560 --> 38:19.800]  the Manhattan Project waste to a great extent dumped and there is a giant
[38:19.800 --> 38:25.000]  multi-year fire burning into the landfill and now toxic sludge has been
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.760]  spilling out we of course have Geiger counters and we send those we're about
[38:29.760 --> 38:33.960]  to find out but the point is they admit it's radioactive waste out there and
[38:33.960 --> 38:38.800]  she's trying to find out exactly what's going on she volunteered to go there we
[38:38.800 --> 38:44.320]  didn't send her there's the headline is underground fire smolders your radioactive
[38:44.320 --> 38:49.320]  waste EPA dismisses concerns just like they did Fukushima just like Japan did
[38:49.320 --> 38:54.500]  so we see this over and over again Leanne McAdoo thank you so much for
[38:54.500 --> 38:58.800]  joining us give us a report on what you've seen so far well that's right
[38:58.800 --> 39:02.800]  Alex I'm here in fluorescent Missouri which is a suburb of St. Louis we've
[39:02.800 --> 39:06.360]  met with some families here this morning that we're talking about that
[39:06.360 --> 39:12.560]  very thing you were just mentioning they're trying to fight to prove and we
[39:12.560 --> 39:17.360]  have a Skype issue sorry Leanne go ahead and start back over going over the
[39:17.360 --> 39:21.880]  generation all right we're gonna reconnect with her and continue on from
[39:21.880 --> 39:32.000]  this point now again ladies and gentlemen this just goes to the culture
[39:32.000 --> 39:40.040]  that we have or anything that's a serious danger to society is ignored and
[39:40.040 --> 39:45.920]  anything that is petty and mindless and a distraction is put on a pedestal
[39:45.920 --> 39:50.680]  nationwide don't you dare have any Halloween parties or costume parties
[39:50.680 --> 39:55.160]  because being a cowboy being a Native American being a geisha girl from
[39:55.160 --> 40:01.440]  Japan is racist and is evil and is horrible but if you want to radiate
[40:01.440 --> 40:07.280]  Japan and then cover up what's happened and then cover up the radiation coming
[40:07.280 --> 40:11.520]  across the United States and raining down on people well then everything say
[40:11.520 --> 40:16.280]  okay well we're figuring out what's going on with Leanne and some other issues I
[40:16.280 --> 40:22.400]  want to air a compendium of special reports that they did for the nightly
[40:22.400 --> 40:30.480]  news her and her good friend Ms. Robin because it was their idea to try to
[40:30.480 --> 40:34.160]  check out the claims that we were making and what listeners were saying
[40:34.160 --> 40:41.720]  about the survival shield combined of course with the liver shield and what
[40:41.720 --> 40:46.080]  that would do they did the six-day cleanse on top of juicing as well and
[40:46.080 --> 40:53.200]  the six-day cleanse is up on info wars life.com and you take the oxy powder
[40:53.200 --> 40:56.520]  four to six tablets a day just high-level oxygen that releases in your
[40:56.520 --> 41:01.640]  intestines upper and lower intestine you take the liver shield it's a proprietary
[41:01.640 --> 41:07.280]  product in water four times a day with apple cider vinegar and then on the
[41:07.280 --> 41:11.720]  sixth day you drink seven ounces of virgin olive oil when you go to bed at
[41:11.720 --> 41:16.000]  night and lay on the side that your liver's on your right side for at least
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.200]  an hour and then most people in the morning have spectacular results when
[41:20.200 --> 41:26.200]  green and black stones come out I say most people almost like 98% we talked
[41:26.200 --> 41:29.800]  to have results within two days most of them the next morning me it was a day
[41:29.800 --> 41:34.120]  and a half later at night it wasn't the next day it was the next night's day so
[41:34.120 --> 41:40.120]  about day and a half two days later and they went out they did it and this is
[41:40.120 --> 41:44.160]  the results since we have Leon on I'm a meaner to air this for days because
[41:44.160 --> 41:50.240]  right now we have 25% off the liver cleanse pack that is a big discount on
[41:50.240 --> 41:54.080]  the already discounted products that's oxy powder with the liver shield then
[41:54.080 --> 41:58.680]  you just buy the apple cider vinegar at the store and the virgin olive oil and
[41:58.680 --> 42:03.160]  you are good to go you want to supercharge it even more which most
[42:03.160 --> 42:10.520]  people don't need to do you get the epsom salts take a few caplets of that
[42:10.520 --> 42:17.960]  that night as well along with the olive oil and then it really gets crazy so
[42:17.960 --> 42:24.200]  that is all coming up in this report then we'll come back with Leanne Mcadoo
[42:24.200 --> 42:37.040]  here it is
[42:37.040 --> 42:41.960]  hi everybody well myself and Emmy Robin are here we're getting ready to do the

[43:53.560 --> 43:57.880]  lie and then the cravings have come on like I said on day three it's always
[43:57.880 --> 44:01.280]  towards the end of the day of course when I was driving over here yes here

[44:11.000 --> 44:15.640]  yeah it's just it's it's it's weird day three for some reason no matter how
[44:15.640 --> 44:19.520]  many times I cleanse and I've cleansed a lot day three I always just get the
[44:19.520 --> 44:23.200]  strangest craving we're not using pharmaceutical drugs we're not you know
[44:23.200 --> 44:26.480]  I've seen so many posts that people getting their gallbladders taken out
[44:26.480 --> 44:30.080]  and people don't understand like it's not like your wisdom teeth like your
[44:30.080 --> 44:34.360]  gallbladder is a huge horse organ along with your liver that cleanses your body
[44:34.360 --> 44:40.360]  and you can't just take that out because it helps cleanse the body so why not
[44:40.360 --> 44:43.880]  try a cleanse and get rid of the stuff in the gallbladder as promised we are
[44:43.880 --> 44:48.200]  checking in for day four of the info wars like liver shield cleanse I gotta say
[44:48.200 --> 44:52.720]  Emmy you were right day four I feel tremendous woke up this morning feeling
[44:52.720 --> 44:58.960]  really light a lot of clarity I had no hunger pains and I actually felt like I
[44:58.960 --> 45:02.520]  was floating through the grocery store everyone was sort of looking at me like
[45:02.520 --> 45:07.520]  oh pardon me oh excuse me and I wasn't in there cute or anything like it just was
[45:07.520 --> 45:12.920]  like I feel like I am glowing and you're not even that hungry right no not at all
[45:12.920 --> 45:16.920]  I didn't even want to eat today because I felt so good yeah so obviously this
[45:16.920 --> 45:21.160]  cleanse for me has really showed me that it is all about retraining our brain
[45:21.160 --> 45:26.000]  like I said how can you resist tyranny if you can't resist the taco stand now if
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.640]  you want to see our before and after photos I think they said they've got
[45:28.640 --> 45:33.960]  them ready like I said mine are before and almost after because I'm not done
[45:33.960 --> 45:39.920]  with my flesh but you can see those if you go to info wars.com forward slash
[45:39.920 --> 45:47.480]  show whoa Emmy I was I promise you I promise you I was not sticking out in
[45:47.480 --> 45:51.320]  that first picture I just literally was relaxed and even in the second picture I
[45:51.320 --> 45:57.560]  was relaxed but like looking really crazy in my back side no I know I can see
[45:57.560 --> 46:02.040]  the muscles in my stomach it's nuts in my legs I feel like my legs look skinnier
[46:02.040 --> 46:07.760]  I don't know I started off it like a I mean for my height I'm almost 5'9 so I
[46:07.760 --> 46:12.200]  started off at relatively healthy weight because I had done the liver cleanse in
[46:12.200 --> 46:15.400]  July and then I went straight into working and on a production for three
[46:15.400 --> 46:18.920]  months where I was working 18 hour days on my feet doing like eight miles a day
[46:18.920 --> 46:21.880]  so I mean I wasn't super out of shape but when I started that first liver
[46:21.880 --> 46:25.600]  cleanse I was pretty out of shape so that before you said you're actually at the
[46:25.600 --> 46:30.760]  lowest weight of your well in a decade I guess yeah pretty much I'm almost back
[46:30.760 --> 46:34.360]  to where when I was a fitness model which would they have do they have mine
[46:34.360 --> 46:38.960]  before and almost afters are we gonna hold those off oh my goodness gracious

[46:51.460 --> 46:55.840]  little roll oh my god this is so embarrassing there's that little roll

[47:41.960 --> 47:44.480]  was going to be
[47:46.880 --> 47:51.880]  and ladies and gentlemen we are back live broadcasting worldwide lining up
[47:51.880 --> 47:56.080]  some of the skypishes with Leanne she'll be filing reports there as well and
[47:56.080 --> 48:02.240]  joining us coming up in the fourth hour we can get those questions answered was
[48:02.240 --> 48:07.800]  their increase radiation levels on the Geiger counter a b what are the locals
[48:07.800 --> 48:11.840]  saying how much sludge has come out I know her eyes were watering burning other
[48:11.840 --> 48:15.400]  locals were saying it was painful quite frankly I don't even like having our
[48:15.400 --> 48:21.920]  reporters near this type of thing but she did live in st. Louis for years and so
[48:21.920 --> 48:25.880]  she wanted to go back and actually check into it because she lived near
[48:25.880 --> 48:30.960]  there for many years to the middle of a populated area with a fire burning
[48:30.960 --> 48:37.600]  underground for several years now getting into the area that has the
[48:37.600 --> 48:44.800]  radioactive waste now continuing with some of the other news that we have here
[48:44.800 --> 48:52.920]  Europeans scramble for guns amid Islamic immigrant invasion long guns sold out
[48:52.920 --> 48:57.120]  and this is in the German newspapers it's in the Czech newspapers we have
[48:57.120 --> 49:03.840]  links in articles done by McKell fail and Kurt Nemo and Max Slavo and others
[49:03.840 --> 49:09.920]  where local news is reporting and showing columns in some cases of more
[49:09.920 --> 49:19.200]  than 10,000 people marching down country roads into towns and cities and again in
[49:19.200 --> 49:26.440]  some of the more backwards primitive radical Islamic areas it's a fact that
[49:26.440 --> 49:32.320]  women are still sold in slavery blacks are still sold in slavery very racist
[49:32.320 --> 49:36.280]  against black people in northern Africa because the Arabs invaded and took it
[49:36.280 --> 49:41.400]  over that's why in Libya Al Qaeda has been killing the blacks who have a right
[49:41.400 --> 49:45.760]  to be in Africa obviously coming can the blacks be anywhere I mean can the
[49:45.760 --> 49:51.520]  Europeans be anywhere and now in some countries like Austria and a few others
[49:51.520 --> 49:58.240]  you can get special permits to get shotguns but the problem is gun ownership
[49:58.240 --> 50:02.320]  is so low it's being reported that in Austria and other countries they've
[50:02.320 --> 50:10.080]  sold out of guns already 70,000 guns have been sold this year alone in Austria I
[50:10.080 --> 50:18.000]  saw the numbers that's more than 20 times what was sold previously so the
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.600]  police are reporting most of them are women who are scared of being raped
[50:22.600 --> 50:27.280]  that is coming up also a new sickening video yesterday they were talking about
[50:27.280 --> 50:31.160]  trying to keep the babies heads intact to sell their brains now Planned Parenthood
[50:31.160 --> 50:35.720]  of Texas of Austin they actually get taxpayer money in Travis County only
[50:35.720 --> 50:41.080]  County in Texas where they get Planned Parenthood gets your money in property
[50:41.080 --> 50:47.000]  tax as part of the hospital district laughing abortionist says we pull out
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  baby hearts after abortion just for fun it's cute talking about how they still
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.440]  beat remember my dad cutting out like snake hearts and stuff when I was a kid
[50:56.440 --> 51:03.680]  and showing how they kept beating isn't it you earthquake floods winter storms
[51:03.680 --> 51:07.720]  prolonged power outages or war each of us have had that moment when we
[51:07.720 --> 51:11.680]  recognize that we need to be better prepared we typically do the same thing
[51:11.680 --> 51:15.280]  we start with food storage then we address the need for water but have you
[51:15.280 --> 51:19.560]  considered heat storage I'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are
[51:19.560 --> 51:23.720]  some things for you to consider how will I keep my family warm the standard
[51:23.720 --> 51:27.320]  answers are firewood coal or propane but the problem with that if you need to be
[51:27.320 --> 51:32.480]  on the move is you can't take it with you another concern there may come a time
[51:32.480 --> 51:36.280]  when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may even
[51:36.280 --> 51:40.840]  come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly
[51:40.840 --> 51:45.760]  than you think for these answers go to fortress clothing comm again fortress
[51:45.760 --> 51:50.600]  clothing comm has the answers to your heat storage dilemma don't get stuck in
[51:50.600 --> 51:59.440]  the cold fortress clothing comm you'll never be cold again my name is bill

[52:03.720 --> 52:08.480]  network in the world and I paid for this airtime because I have an important
[52:08.480 --> 52:13.800]  message to the American people there's a change coming that the government isn't
[52:13.800 --> 52:19.720]  telling you about this change has deep implications for life in America from
[52:19.720 --> 52:24.640]  where you shop to the doctors you visit and the family you want to protect look
[52:24.640 --> 52:31.040]  I've made predictions like this before thing is I was right then to a few years
[52:31.040 --> 52:37.920]  ago I warned that housing prices would collapse they did before that I warned
[52:37.920 --> 52:44.840]  that comm companies would crash they did those who listened had a chance to save
[52:44.840 --> 52:49.120]  themselves but this has nothing to do with the stock market this will affect
[52:49.120 --> 52:53.720]  us all you can watch the video for free right now by going to dollar danger
[52:53.720 --> 53:00.680]  comm again that's dollar danger comm atmospheric aluminum mercury exposure
[53:00.680 --> 53:05.400]  estrogen toxins from plastics microwaves from cell phone to smart meters and low
[53:05.400 --> 53:09.520]  quality foods all combined to create conditions for the very high incidence of
[53:09.520 --> 53:13.640]  disease in our society now more than ever we all need to be consuming those
[53:13.640 --> 53:17.240]  foods and herbs that epigenetically signal the cells of our body to produce
[53:17.240 --> 53:22.000]  energy create proteins and detoxify when we properly support our bodies then

[54:21.720 --> 54:51.240]  you know I was thinking about this broadcast this morning
[54:51.240 --> 55:00.120]  and it's ugly sometimes it's powerful sometimes it's goofy but I'll tell you
[55:00.120 --> 55:06.520]  this it's real what you get here on air is what you get behind the scenes when I
[55:06.520 --> 55:09.920]  get up here and I'm angry about what's happening it's not a it's not an act
[55:09.920 --> 55:17.520]  okay I am genuinely upset about the takeover of society I am genuinely
[55:17.520 --> 55:20.760]  upset about the dumbing down in the public I am genuinely concerned about
[55:20.760 --> 55:24.320]  the divide and conquer and I know you are as well and look none of us are
[55:24.320 --> 55:27.960]  perfect I know that all of us feel like in our hearts we should be able to fix
[55:27.960 --> 55:32.240]  this but we can't God's gonna have to help us do that but we've got to take
[55:32.240 --> 55:36.760]  action and I think God will take us the rest of the way but
[55:37.640 --> 55:41.400]  listening to Melissa Harris Perry say it's racist to say somebody's a hard
[55:41.400 --> 55:47.760]  worker it's all about the control of reality the control of words and if you
[55:47.760 --> 55:55.920]  can say the Caitlyn Jenner gets the 2015 courage award above everybody else in
[55:55.920 --> 56:00.240]  sports you can say whatever you want it's about doing ridiculous things out in
[56:00.240 --> 56:05.680]  the open in our face we're gonna get Leanne McAdoo back on soon I appreciate
[56:05.680 --> 56:08.600]  her courage going to cover this I didn't really want to send her but she wanted
[56:08.600 --> 56:14.960]  to go hot spot near nuclear waste has St. Louis residents on edge that's CBS
[56:14.960 --> 56:22.400]  News there is a growing fear in suburban St. Louis community over a
[56:22.400 --> 56:26.880]  potential threat buried in the ground a local landfill contains nuclear waste
[56:26.880 --> 56:31.440]  and just three football fields away a hot spot has been burning underground in
[56:31.440 --> 56:39.120]  a second landfill to hear that hot spot and they've tried to go over there with
[56:39.120 --> 56:43.600]  the Geiger counter and have been run off by the EPA and I'm sitting the message
[56:43.600 --> 56:47.360]  Leanne she doesn't want her at the hot spot she doesn't need to go over
[56:47.360 --> 56:52.240]  the stuffs coming out of the ground just get at the general area and and then
[56:52.240 --> 56:56.880]  there's metrics where of it's up just a little bit hundreds yards away you can
[56:56.880 --> 57:05.000]  bet it's higher right where the hot spot is and the point is they dump toxic
[57:05.000 --> 57:09.280]  waste and radioactive waste all over the place there and the hot spot is it
[57:09.280 --> 57:16.800]  mean it this is CBS News been leaching into the rest of the landfill but what
[57:16.800 --> 57:22.480]  makes me mad is that again 90 plus percent of the 400 commercial reactors in
[57:22.480 --> 57:27.320]  the world 440 something are leaking they don't care they don't retire them they
[57:27.320 --> 57:32.280]  store the waste on top the reactors it's crazy the University of Texas has a
[57:32.280 --> 57:36.800]  reactor in north Austin and an old one underneath the University of Texas from
[57:36.800 --> 57:42.440]  the 50s and I tell the average yuppie there's a nuclear reactor underneath it
[57:42.440 --> 57:45.920]  that by the way still running you can't ever completely shut them down and they
[57:45.920 --> 57:53.200]  look at me like I'm a man for Mars and it's not like I'm even saying this is
[57:53.200 --> 57:56.800]  the end of the world having a nuclear reactor in downtown Austin it's that
[57:56.800 --> 58:01.920]  the public doesn't even know it's there so if there ever was a problem they just
[58:01.920 --> 58:10.800]  tell them it didn't exist I'm sick of it and I'm just sick of how soft the public
[58:10.800 --> 58:15.480]  is but we've had it good so long that's why we've got this position myself
[58:15.480 --> 58:19.440]  included I'm a slob as well none of us are perfect I need to do more in the

[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.920]  alex joe's
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:33.600]  well CNN saying we should restrict Caitlyn Jenner Halloween costumes because
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:42.280]  it's trans transphobic and there's a big moves to give racist or sexist
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:48.680]  Halloween costumes one-star ratings and of course next is ban them and what are
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:59.120]  they saying that is well a geisha girl a cowboy a Mexican anything you know one
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.720]  of the most popular things at frat houses I was never in a fraternity but I
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:07.600]  went to some of the parties is Mexican food tequila you're wearing some
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:13.560]  burrows and getting drunk kind of like you can have a barbarian party there's
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:23.800]  nothing's no slight on Mexicans but they even banned them at Hispanic clubs and
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:28.480]  that's why they're now saying that basically anything and everything is
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:38.480]  sexist boy and girl man and woman any culture at all is bad having fun is
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:43.080]  bad but being targeted by the globalist having all of our rights taken being
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.840]  spied on having our right to self-defense being taken having our
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.560]  national sovereignty being conquered by secret international treaties that's all
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:59.840]  okay and CNN gets up there and lectures us about how Halloween is racist let me
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:05.280]  tell you what Halloween really is since it's coming up it is an amalgamation of
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:15.960]  druidic beginning of winter basically rituals fall and winter rituals where
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:22.160]  humans were sacrificed along with cattle and other valuables and the
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:30.160]  Catholics superimposed a saint's day over human sacrifice rituals going on in
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.520]  the continent of Europe but also in what is the United Kingdom today and that's a
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.560]  fact and I tell adults this and they go you're kidding and I can show them the
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:42.720]  encyclopedia Britannica I was talking to somebody this morning and they're
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.560]  like you're you're kidding that they really threw babies and men women and
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:51.960]  children into fires yes they burned up the king's son sometimes if they wanted
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:57.280]  to in a burning man in a wicker man that was the way nobility was sacrificed
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:02.560]  just like the Aztecs did it and people go the Aztecs kill people I thought that
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:08.640]  was only in movies I mean the public is wickedly ignorant wickedly ignorant
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:14.800]  beyond ignorant dangerously moronic and I'm not again on a power trip saying
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:23.200]  this it's it's layers of baloney on top of layers of garbage on top of layers of
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:38.400]  Bravo Sierra because Halloween itself in the modern sense since the 1950s was a
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:45.160]  corporately created superimposed resurrection of the pagan roots to
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:48.760]  sell a bunch of products and create something as big as Christmas to make
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:55.120]  money off of that that was on the temporal money economic level above
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.480]  that
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:05.800]  show and Sam Hayne the night before all saints day day of the dead whatever you
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:15.720]  want to call it in European culture is about bringing back the occult and
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.360]  masquerading in front of everyone now I'm not saying day of the dead November
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:25.280]  second isn't it is a satanic holiday that is about your ancestors and things
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.840]  like that remembering the dead I'm talking about the European version of it
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:37.600]  is a child sacrifice satanic worship I don't want to say devil worship or even
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:43.560]  satanic let's just say the horned god you know the wickets and people sit there
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.240]  and lecture folks and go we're not into any devil worship we're not into
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:51.520]  bloodletting how dare you backwards Christian take you may not be but where
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:56.640]  your religion comes from was all about human sacrifice and stop denying it

[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:11.760]  and propaganda that's going on in these debates people need to understand we're
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:15.360]  not doing this to promote any one particular candidate because we know at
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.040]  top levels that these guys rent a lot of them are pretty much fixed horses just
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.440]  like Trump has said himself picks up the phone at three in the morning he calls
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:25.600]  whoever the candidate is he says hey I need you to do this favor for me then
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.800]  they hop up and do it he's saying that the political system is broken and I
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.640]  could not agree more with that we're doing this more as a way to educate the
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:36.040]  general public about the left-right paradigm and how you don't have to choose
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:41.040]  between a Republican and a Democrat it's going to be on CNBC and they say that
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.640]  some of the hot issues that they'll be talking about this time around are gonna

[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:26.440]  well George Norrie broadcast on over 600 AM and FM stations across the United States
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:30.920]  of course he's on XM serious and is arguably the number one or number two
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:35.840]  most listened to broadcast not just in the United States but across the world
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:41.720]  and I can attest to that we are so blessed to have someone who's open-minded
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.840]  to exposing the globalist and who promotes the Bill of Rights and
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:51.520]  Constitution that reaches so many people he also covers a lot of fun stuff and
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:58.480]  unsolved mysteries and things on the broadcast as well but I personally have
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:05.920]  experienced the coast to coast AM.com effect when I'm out in the public when
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:10.800]  I was down in Alpine and Big Bend last weekend spending some time hiking around
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:17.000]  the desert I ran into a lot of listeners and so many of them said I learned
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.440]  about you with George Norrie and when he comes on every three four months I
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.800]  always mention that because we've got to be very thankful for the fact that George
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:32.320]  13 14 years ago when coast-to-coast AM and its other great host legendary
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.640]  hosts like Art Bell were not really getting in to the New World Order world
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:45.040]  government global government RFID smart meters vaccines cashless societies
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:52.000]  George Norrie was and boy when he first had me on it was on ABC News CNN C-SPAN
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:59.080]  within a day that how dare him have Alex Jones on and this was a frightening
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:06.160]  interview and this was crazy because back then no one would report that I'd
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:12.680]  snuck into Bohemian Grove they even broke in someone broke in and stole the
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:18.840]  tapes out of the British television networks hotel I then mailed it not
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:24.720]  once not twice but three times to their LA studios at World of Wonder and those
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:32.880]  tapes were erased erased we finally mailed it to one of their homes and
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:41.320]  they got them now imagine they were saying this did not exist how far we've
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:48.600]  come just yesterday it was in Bloomberg and a bunch of other publications that
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:54.400]  indeed Citibank is going to make you retina scan to cash checks get money buy
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:59.080]  and sell basically and once they do that you think Bank of America want to
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:02.680]  charge you $5 every time you use your ATM is bad or you use your debit card or
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:06.080]  credit card it's going to get a lot worse it'll track everything we do it'll
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.720]  shut down underground economies it is a nightmare scenario and now it's here and
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:15.880]  on hundreds of fronts I went up with the phones up at the bottom of the hour how
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:21.480]  many things that you hear on info wars or on coast-to-coast AM that were just
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:28.080]  outlandish and crazy 15 years ago 10 years ago five years ago that are now
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:33.600]  admitted they admit in army manuals now the FEMA camps they now admit global
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:41.160]  government they now admit forced inoculation they now admit so much of
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.520]  this is out in the open and we have the southern poverty law center margins to
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:51.200]  the mainstream to demonize myself and others and they say we're crazy we think
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:55.080]  they're coming after our guns well they admit they are we we think there's a
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.640]  UN agenda to restrict energy the UN has a target of cutting world energy
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:04.080]  consumption by half in the next 10 years so they're really playing to folks's
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:08.680]  ignorance but it doesn't work that's why it's margins to the mainstream I want
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:12.160]  to ask George Norrie this question I've asked him before but ask it again not for
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:17.200]  lack of news we're in a sea of incredible news and these are scripted
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:23.520]  interviews I mean I'm just coming at George with my questions I respect what
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:31.200]  he has to say what are we gonna do as what we've covered becomes mainstream
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:37.520]  news they admit this stuff's going on but then still demonize us it isn't
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.760]  working though because as they admit margins to the mainstream the systems
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:45.800]  being discredited and those of us that were out in the wilderness are now
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.920]  being brought in by the people and being respected that's quite a
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.200]  responsibility but I don't know what the establishment's gonna do I mean four
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:58.040]  years ago George you had myself on others you covered how our governments
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:04.200]  were arming al-Qaeda and then ISIS and what really happened it been gauzy you
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:10.600]  had that within weeks of it happening so did I almost no one else did we're not
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:14.760]  bragging it's just a fact that our perspective on the world is so much
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:18.120]  more accurate than what you call mainstream because they're there I mean
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:25.080]  ESPN wouldn't even report on deflate a gate that's one reason they're losing
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:29.200]  viewers I mean when it gets to a point where things are so sanitized so
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:34.520]  controlled what is the dinosaur media gonna do George Norrie
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:42.120]  you know Skype is such a wonderful thing but I'm almost convinced we've got an
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:46.400]  internal Skype problem because we couldn't have Leon on earlier and now we
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:51.120]  can't have George on so I want to go to telephones until we've revamped had some
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:56.160]  experts in we've got the professional Skype system we've had consultants in
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:01.720]  but I want to venture that something's rotten in the state of Denmark we do have
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.080]  George Norrie we'll try one more time and then go to phone George that was my
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.200]  big long intro thank you for coming on with us and I did hear your intro then
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:15.040]  all of a sudden you were taken away from me Alex very strange watching your feed
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.680]  my friend no no it's probably just the internet but seriously George I mean the
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:22.600]  big question what is the establishment gonna do now that everything they say
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:28.160]  is basically taken as pure bull well let me tell you what's been going on since
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:32.400]  we've been doing this for 13 years and you've been doing this even longer
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:38.800]  things have fallen right into our lap social networking has exploded the
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:45.240]  internet has exploded as you said I'm on 600 plus radio stations around North
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:52.040]  America all those things have come into each other and they continue to grow and
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:59.160]  so what I think they are facing is the knowledge that they simply can't stop
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.280]  this anymore well they probably could have stopped it a long time ago they
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:08.280]  can't stop it anymore it's gotten too big and now they just have to write it out
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:14.120]  with us and they are petrified that we are bringing the truth out to the public
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:19.440]  and people are beginning to realize we're not gonna take it anymore we are
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:25.120]  fed up with getting a spoon fed story from either a mainstream media or from
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.720]  government and they're gonna investigate themselves now and now with the
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:34.680]  alternative media and programs like coast to coast and what you do Alex on
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:41.520]  info wars and prison planet people get their information immediate fast and
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:46.360]  very very accurate and that's what's beginning to happen and those power
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:52.240]  brokers can't stop it anymore and now they're trying to figure out how do we
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:58.880]  work within that system and that's what they're trying to figure out what are
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:05.240]  you focused on right now well right now we're besides doing ghost to ghost this
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:10.200]  Friday on Halloween and having some fun we are looking at just about everything
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.240]  that's been going on yes you just mentioned the city bank is going to
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:22.200]  experiment with retina and in eyes for ATMs I think de bold the great black box
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:29.080]  voting company is going to make the the ATM machines and market those that's
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:33.720]  that's an amazing so we're looking at that story we're handling a lot of things
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:38.760]  that are going on internationally we are concerned about what's going on
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:43.040]  between the United States and China you know with the ships getting closer to
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:47.080]  what they call territorial waters there's just there's something going on
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:54.040]  here and the economy still is not as robust as people think or say because
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:17:00.080]  we still see a lot of people unemployed retail sales are still marginal and you
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:04.400]  know there's a lot of concern about what's going on our our EI stores just
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:08.560]  yesterday announced they're not going to open up on Black Friday they've told
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:13.080]  their employees hey take Thursday off take Thanksgiving off take Friday off
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:17.240]  we're not going to do it so lots of things are going on we're we're looking
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:23.560]  at everything as you know coast-to-coast was primarily the paranormal show the
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:29.520]  UFO show and you can't just do that anymore there are way too many things
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:34.800]  going on that cut to the chase of what we're going through as people that we
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:40.200]  have to handle as you mentioned the vaccines the political system there's
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.560]  the big debate today in Boulder Colorado we can talk about that and some of our
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:49.000]  thoughts on the presidential election but we are looking at everything that's
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.640]  going on on this planet right now because you have to for us as talk show
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:59.480]  hosts we would be irresponsible if we just dabbled with the fluff and didn't
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:02.440]  get into the meat of what and boy there's plenty of meat and I'm glad you
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:06.520]  raised the China situation because that is so big I haven't even been covering
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:12.520]  that enough because it's just so over the top it it's hard to analyze China as
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.920]  you know fire to sea launch missile from a submarine a few years ago off the
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:22.920]  coast the media tried to spin it and say it wasn't a missile there's a headline
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:26.680]  mystery missile launch off coast of California caught on tape near Los
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:29.720]  Angeles it later leaked from the Pentagon that it was the communist
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.560]  Chinese and a threat they've been coming into the California and the Alaskan
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:37.840]  territorial waters and then those are our waters China and I've talked a lot
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:41.160]  experts they don't have a claim to the Spratly area they are building
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:45.000]  artificial islands they are claiming they control that South China Sea area
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.200]  this is a power grab and our government does a lot of power grabs too but you
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.040]  know when they're on the wrong they're on the wrong of you you were a naval
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:58.680]  officer you know not just a TV award-winning what Emmy award-winning
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:05.920]  reporter but from your expertise from your expertise what do you think's going
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:09.000]  on with this China situation I mean they're now as you know threatening
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.360]  military action this is escalating well China as you know they are our biggest
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:19.680]  debt holders I mean they have well over four trillion dollars in debt that they
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:27.680]  own I'm not sure that if you let money to somebody Alex that you'd want anything
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:32.800]  to happen to them because they become a debt holder and you know eventually hey
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:37.400]  you'll get paid and everything will be fine in this situation with China if
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:42.040]  China goes to war with us or we go to war with them that's going to be an
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:48.160]  economic disaster for them so they're tippy-toeing around the situation there's
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:53.560]  no question China is flexing its muscles it wants these islands that the
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:58.080]  Philippines claim might be theirs it wants islands that the Japanese say
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:05.040]  belong to them I think China has its eyes on Taiwan are we gonna go to war
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:10.640]  over Taiwan even though we've promised the Taiwanese will step in and bail you
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:15.000]  out if something happens lots of things are going on but I think you're right I
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.960]  think China is flexing its muscles and they're pushing and they're trying to
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:24.880]  push and see how far can we push before the United States tries to push back
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:29.640]  we're playing these little games as we do with the Russians close flybys and
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:34.960]  things like that what concerns me is that mistakes happen we've seen it
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:41.520]  before it's happened then it'll happen in the future military makes mistakes
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:46.840]  planes do something wrong they go off course anything could happen to trigger
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:52.120]  what could very well be a third-world war if you look at what's happening around
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:58.640]  the world right now and the tensions everywhere from Syria to Israel to where
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:04.720]  the Palestinians are there's too much going on right now and what a better
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:08.960]  way to put it all together than a third-world war and something's going
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:15.560]  on I feel it I hope it doesn't happen but I think we need to be ready for this
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:19.880]  well undoubtedly you were on with us two years ago a year ago six months ago and
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:24.800]  said everybody you talked to feels this ominous tick-tock towards something
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:30.240]  bigger it's now Richard Crescendo we've got proxy wars with Russia proxy wars
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:34.040]  in Syria the West caught backing the bad guys in the Middle East
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:40.160]  communist China moving into Africa controlling 96% of rare earth minerals
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:44.600]  I'm not really worried about Russia they're not expanding in my view it's
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:48.680]  China I'm worried about I'm not romanticizing our government either but
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:53.720]  when you talk about censorship the communist Chinese government is heavily
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:57.920]  involved in what Hollywood puts out now they won't accept movies of their market
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:02.480]  unless it's been pre-approved like the Martian where the Chinese basically save
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:07.840]  our space program and not the Russians it's just crazy to see Chinese communist
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:14.080]  propaganda involved in American politics I bet the Chinese love the Martian
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:19.000]  movie in that segment when the Chinese did come and bail us out and save the
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:27.680]  save Matt Damon you know common sense tells you that another world war would
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:32.080]  be catastrophic for the entire planet there are too many countries that have
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:38.000]  nukes right now and they have that capability of using them from North
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:45.480]  Korea to Pakistan to India to Israel to China to us to Russia too many nations
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:51.440]  have the capability of destroying this planet and it just takes one lunatic to
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:56.160]  do this I forgot North Korea you talk about lunatics that that guy's capable
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:03.080]  of doing anything so we are surrounded by lunatics craziness it's just crazy you
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:07.200]  know as Howard Beale said in the movie network that you so eloquently quoted
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:11.240]  in Toronto when we were there you know people are mad as hell and they're not
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:16.400]  going to take it anymore because the world has gone crazy and I'm in St.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:22.720]  Louis right now I'm down in my bunker studio and I can sense it from people
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.480]  out there they're just fed up Alex they want to be left alone they they want to
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:30.960]  be in their homes have their car go to and get their little jobs and come home
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:36.400]  and just be left alone and I think that's happening to Americans all over the
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:40.640]  country these days you know I didn't think of that your skype's working lands
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:44.880]  Macadoo is there in St. Louis right now her skype's breaking up but she's out
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:48.840]  there at the landfill where they've got all that nuclear waste and of course for
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:52.440]  those that don't know there's a huge cave complex there in St. Louis you've got
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:57.000]  offices there broadcast from there part of the year when you're not out in LA but
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.640]  George Norrie just to add to the apocalyptic atmosphere in the world
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.600]  with the economy and the derivatives and the open borders and the collapsing
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:10.800]  countries for much of the world we're already in a depression we see
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:15.000]  softening job numbers manufacturing numbers Yellen says at the Fed they'll
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:21.480]  continue QE because of that what is it like though to be close to underground
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:27.480]  fires approaching the giant nuke waste dump and they are very very close to
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:34.040]  where I am the airport which is near Bridgestone is where this landfill dump
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:39.280]  is and by that dump which is underground the fires burning underground
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:46.200]  believe it or not has been doing it for years is this nuclear waste dump and the
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:51.360]  fire is getting closer and closer and closer well we did a national story on
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.080]  that a couple weeks ago and the St. Louis media has been doing it as well
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:00.360]  but it's starting now to get national recognition and the EPA is finally
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.960]  involved in this trying to figure out how are they going to handle this back
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:11.160]  during the 1940s when we were creating the atomic bomb St. Louis was a very
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:17.080]  influential city with scientists and people like that working on the Manhattan
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:24.240]  Project and they used a lot of land here for dump and it's it's couldn't get
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:29.080]  into the water supply it could be a disaster now we've seen what happened
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:34.160]  in Fukushima where the experts are now beginning to say that there's a higher
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:39.120]  incidence of cancer among children I think that same thing could happen here
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:45.160]  that landfill dump from where I am sitting right now Alex is about 15
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:52.160]  miles away that's 15 minutes in a car that's not far at all but I really feel
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:56.960]  sorry for the people who live in that community and in that area because
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:03.040]  that's pretty heavily populated and I mean it is absolutely a biblical
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:08.640]  proportion nightmare if that fire gets to that waste dump which is bad all by
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:14.000]  itself but if the fire gets to that nuclear waste dump God knows what could
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:20.280]  happen well that's my issue with nuclear power is that if they contained it
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:23.280]  right if they developed it right I wouldn't be against it but they don't
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:27.520]  retire reactors up to 30 years they're falling apart they're having more and
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:32.840]  more leaks so the answer of the Japanese US government EU governments as you know
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:38.640]  is to just say we're turning the alarms off or okay higher radiation levels are
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:42.960]  now safe we're raising the allowable levels and just saying oh don't be
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.200]  conspiracy theorist then that makes me worry about other technologies that make
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:53.200]  atomic technology you know 80 years old look tame look at the Hadron collider
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:57.600]  look at what a lot of scientists say create a black hole a strangelet a chain
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:01.080]  reaction explosion and the other scientists say well it might but it's a
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:05.720]  low probability we're still gonna do it I'm not against progress but you've
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.880]  talked a lot about this on your radio show I call it that Atlantean moment
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:13.280]  whether Atlantis was real or not and I tend to think it was real Plato was a
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.160]  real historian he said it was they were advanced they did something it
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:22.000]  blew up their entire huge island that was a small continent and rained pieces
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.600]  of it down across the world according to the ancients well regardless of whether
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:30.400]  it was real or not aren't we now pretty much the new Atlantis and are
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:34.920]  approaching that Atlantean moment well there's no question about it the nuclear
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:39.440]  power plants many of them have been built on earthquake fault lines it's
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:44.560]  crazy I mean it just doesn't make any sense and as you know if the power goes
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:49.960]  out and those generators eventually have a certain time life to it you need to
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:55.880]  cool those rods those radioactive rods and if you can't do it because the
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:01.840]  powers got out as happened in Fukushima you are headed for a nightmare and those
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:07.960]  possibilities are all out there so why we continue to build these plants when
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:14.440]  you can harness energy from the Sun and a very cheap creative way is beyond me
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:20.520]  I mean what I would do is I would build huge solar panels put them up in space
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:27.320]  and beam down signals to generators and to almost like capacitors that will
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:31.720]  store energy here in the United States I mean the Sun is going to be around for a
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.880]  long long time let's take advantage of it well as you know a lot of top
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:39.920]  engineers and scientists say that plan is one of the better plans now George you
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:42.440]  don't like talking about yourself but one reason I called you to book you on
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:46.440]  the show and I appreciate you coming on is I saw articles a few weeks ago several
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:50.880]  of them Business Insider World Net Daily a couple others that George Norrie is
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.880]  thinking about running for president so we come back from break I want to ask
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.160]  you about that I want to shift gears into one of your big passions and it's
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:02.920]  one of mine as well really because I've been listening to you on it is EMP
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:08.200]  whether it be a Carrington event from the Sun or whether it be artificial the
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:13.400]  latest on your movement with others that I know has got a lot of filmmakers a lot
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:17.920]  of people in Congress involved I'm in a film coming out pretty soon that's been
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:22.200]  produced with the Norrises and others that gets into this I can't wait to
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.600]  show folks the trailer it's pretty powerful but there are movements to try
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:32.040]  to protect this planet asteroids how do you see this civilization becoming a type
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:37.120]  one civilization George Norrie host of Coast to Coast AM Coast to Coast AM

[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:58.960]  saying that it is transphobic if you have a Caitlyn Jenner costume so they
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:04.000]  force feed a cultural icon try to make us obsess on something that maybe 1% of
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.800]  the population is involved in in this cultural hijacking try to make our kids
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:12.760]  learn all about it and I'm not attacking anybody but this is force
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:19.400]  feeding or even South Park is sick of it she's she's given all these awards
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:23.960]  courage awards and then you want to be that person at Halloween and they say
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:28.480]  no you can't and you can't be a cowboy or a geisha girl you can't wear a
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:34.600]  sombrero you can't be a Native American because I mean they've canceled in Austin
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:41.440]  yoga studios having eastern themed parties on Halloween where people dress
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:47.600]  up in eastern clothes that's like saying you can't have a party with togas it's
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:53.920]  anti-greeks no it's not it's it's a cultural party but it's like Melissa
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:35:01.000]  Harris Perry said on MSNBC two days ago she said you can't say Paul Ryan's a
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:06.800]  hard worker that takes away from black slaves what it is an attack on speech
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:11.480]  itself George I want to get into your discussion of running for president I
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:15.920]  want to get into how you launched this new dating site paranormal dating site
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:19.160]  I want to get into some fun stuff as well obviously and then open the phones
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:22.280]  up the toll-free number to join us your questions or comments for the great
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:32.200]  George Norrie 800-259-9231 800-2599-231 but first off I know you're
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:36.520]  nonpartisan but you do promote the First Amendment what do you think's going on
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:40.320]  with political correctness where they're saying don't say mother or father don't
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:45.960]  say he or she because just being a he or she might hurt somebody else this isn't
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:53.240]  tolerance this is saying that we must adopt whatever new bizarreness we're
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:59.640]  told to you know banning brown paper bags in Seattle how far is this gonna go
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:03.960]  we see the calls for restricting the drudge report we see calls in Congress
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:08.240]  for restricting free speech on talk radio is this the establishment's
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.560]  response to the fact that they can't compete with us in the arena and the
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:16.520]  free market of ideas oh there's no question about it I mean you can't even
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:21.880]  say God in school anymore without some teachers going ballistic doing all kinds
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:26.800]  of things with Matt George you know Matt was a pioneer he was the one that
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:31.480]  broke some huge stories a long time ago and used the internet in a very effective
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:36.480]  way to do that you can't muffle him I mean what are they afraid of with things
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:42.840]  like that but I mean we have become so concerned about stepping on special
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:48.480]  interest groups and we have forgotten morality and what this country was all
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:52.920]  about and I think it's just crazy Alex we've got to get back to our grassroots
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:58.440]  again as a nation and do things that are just common sense right I mean which
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:04.840]  we're not doing anymore the presidential push to try to get me to run for office
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:09.600]  you are you are absolutely right I am nonpartisan I am not a Republican I'm
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:14.280]  not a Democrat I'm probably more a libertarian but I'm generally
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:18.640]  independent however if you're gonna run for president in the United States you
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:22.920]  really have to be a Democrat or Republican on those parties look they're
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:26.960]  about the same right but you have to do that because that's what garners the
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:31.520]  biggest votes there has been a group that has asked me and wanted me to push
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:39.440]  for this to run on on my platform for several reasons one is got a lot of
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:44.680]  common sense I have been a talk show host and a media person since I was 19
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:53.080]  years old and what I have seen worldwide wherever I've gone is that nobody is
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:59.600]  doing things with a common sense for people and my campaign had I jumped into
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:05.240]  the news would have been to develop programs based on what would help
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:11.080]  Americans and that would be to do away with the internal revenue service to go
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:16.560]  to more of a fair tax based on a sales tax helping people who don't make a lot
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:21.200]  of money so that they would get cash vouchers but to do away with you wouldn't
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:25.880]  even have to file an income tax anymore our defense as you said I've been in the
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:31.600]  Navy nine years as a naval officer we cannot continue to occupy all these
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:37.600]  other countries there are some countries that simply do not work with like we do
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:43.080]  you cannot make them a democracy we saw what happened in Libya in Iraq where
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:47.520]  Saddam Hussein though he wasn't a Boy Scout and make no mistake about that at
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:52.360]  least kept the lid on that country look what's happened to it now it's fallen
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:57.960]  apart Afghanistan it's fallen apart every Syria we're getting involved in that
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:03.360]  it's falling apart every place we go these countries have fallen apart we
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:10.200]  learned nothing from Vietnam so what I would propose as a commander in chief is
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:15.480]  that we no longer become the aggressors but the defenders of people's rights
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:20.360]  around the world we would have the greatest military ever I would continue
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:25.280]  to spend on new technology and building up our armed forces but we're not going
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:29.360]  to occupy countries anymore you know we're we're going to help the world I
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:36.960]  mean if the Boko Haram group in Africa is maiming children and stuff we're
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:40.560]  gonna go in there and stop that that's what we should be doing we shouldn't be
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:47.400]  occupying countries and taking over economically we got to get jobs back in
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.760]  the United States we've got to get manufacturing back here we have to
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:55.040]  create an incentive for corporations to want to stay here and we're not doing
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:59.840]  any of that healthcare throw this thing out the window yes if you need a new
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.520]  kidney Alex you shouldn't be denied because you can't afford it but for
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:07.200]  crying out loud let's not force feed insurance policies down people's
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:13.040]  throats and everything else I mean so everything needs to be revamped and so
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:17.720]  I did I did consider that it's getting late the clock is ticking I would have
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:22.320]  to take a leave from coast to coast and I'm not sure I want to do that but I
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:27.200]  probably could get the nomination the Democratic nomination and then I'd
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:33.760]  even have to run off against Mr. Carson or Mr. Trump or maybe even Jeb Bush
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.840]  well George you've got the listeners tens of millions of them that would
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:40.900]  actually come out and support you your smart guy you destroy them in the
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:48.160]  debates I mean I tell you you would actually have a shot but regardless you'd
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:53.880]  be able to inject a lot of information into the debates I would just be afraid
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:58.920]  they'd try to shut you out and keep you out and so then it wouldn't be effective
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:02.880]  but if you could get in the debates if you could get out there on the road if
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:06.560]  you've got the coverage you'd be a real contender and then it would be worth it
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:10.680]  just to be able to reach a new audience but I tell you you've got tens of
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:14.680]  millions of people turning in right now and so many times you've helped inform
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:18.080]  the public on the model states health emergency powers act force
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:23.720]  inoculations you've helped expose the whole panoptagon spy grid I mean the
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:28.600]  second amendment issues you've defended the GMO crops you've exposed with the
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:33.120]  guest I mean you've been a game changer that key word that key compound word
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:39.440]  over and over again and we would be a very busy administration Alex and and
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:44.480]  another thing that I would do is build my cabinet with the best people I could
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:48.440]  care less what political party they came from you know I'm not going to pick all
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:54.360]  Democrats I would pick people who are the best at what they do that's good
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:42:00.840]  management management puts in people who are good not bad and what we're
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:04.160]  happening now as you're doing all these political favors and we're putting in
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:08.880]  people if I'm if the Republican wins they're all Republicans who get into a
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:15.000]  cabinet I would pick the best people from all walks of life to get involved in
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:20.480]  building a country that we were once proud of George Washington did he wanted
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:26.080]  political parties outlawed well that's pretty pretty dramatic but you know he
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:32.200]  probably was right I would insulate the power grid immediately I would get a
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:36.640]  budget of two billion dollars to protect our power grid from what you had just
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.440]  mentioned an EMP attack which is an electromagnetic pulse attack somebody
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:46.360]  detonating a nuke in the atmosphere which blankets the country and shuts us
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:51.600]  down or an X flare from the Sun which happened in the 1800 shut down the
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:56.800]  telegraph system it could happen again today if we get hit directly with a big
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:02.200]  flare from the Sun and bark my word one day that will happen we have got to get
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:10.000]  our power system insulated or we are up a creek this country and this planet
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:15.680]  cannot survive without power and electricity you're off the air I'm off
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:20.880]  the air your ATMs don't work you can't pump gasoline they are predicting
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:27.360]  William Forston in his books one second after they're predicting that 90% of the
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:32.880]  Americans would die within one year within one year if the power grid goes
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:37.400]  down and I think those numbers are pretty accurate well I'm not particularly
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:42.080]  worried about a foreign enemy using an EMP and I know it could be done it could
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:46.480]  lock knockout limited areas cause a lot of carnage over thousands of square
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:51.640]  miles and for years but if you look at a Carrington event as you know that's
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:56.800]  happened before with the Sun and we know it happens routinely I mean that is a
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:01.320]  probability not it if but when it's going to blow out large sections of our
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:05.720]  power grid and it could be continent-wide even worldwide for folks that
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:08.440]  don't know what a Carrington event is George you're an expert on it with all
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:12.560]  the guests you've interviewed tell them how serious this is a Carrington event
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:18.440]  is very serious and again back in the 1800s so we had a major league X flare
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:23.680]  from the Sun which fried the only electrical system we had at the time and
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:30.120]  that was our telegraph system it cooked it it was so big that the metal in the
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:37.320]  railroad blinds all started melting it was it was unbelievable if us if one
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:44.200]  that size hit us today we're done it's it's all over we've got to insulate it
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:48.120]  they're estimating about two billion dollars would protect the grid from
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:53.680]  these two kinds of events EMPs or X flares come on for what they spent on
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:59.920]  bailouts this is chump change let's fix the power grid and keep this country
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:08.400]  going during times of crises sounds like I'm running doesn't it well I tell you
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:11.680]  it just makes me basically be speechless to think about this I want to go to
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:16.840]  some phone calls George Norrie is our guest separately what do you think about
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:23.160]  Donald Trump in your gut and where do you think he's gonna be in this whole
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:26.520]  Republican nomination do you think he's gonna get it do you think Carson's
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:33.360]  really beating him in some national polls I think what we might have is and
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:39.880]  I'm saying this based on instinct and you know political knowledge I think the
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:46.320]  Trump influence is gonna wait I think it's happening now he hit a plateau and
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:51.480]  I think it's coming down now I think the reality of who is Donald Trump and what
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:56.320]  does this all mean is starting to sit in the only alternative it appears right
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:02.280]  now is Ben Carson I think that's gonna wane too as some of my guests have
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:07.760]  predicted all along Jeb Bush comes in through the backdoor and it will
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:12.960]  probably get that Republican nomination and as ludicrous as it might sound three
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:18.400]  years and I mean another Bush three times and he's so far behind in the polls
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:24.720]  but I think he's got that possibility and as for the Democratic side even though
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:29.240]  Bernie Sanders is showing some strength I think Hillary my prediction will get
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:34.920]  that nomination and so you may end up still with a Hillary Jeb Bush runoff
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:41.480]  and there you go I mean is right and it shows how to touch the establishment as
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:45.040]  they try to force feed these two groups the vacation together that call each
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:49.040]  other family that have foundations together I mean we're not North Korea
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:53.680]  where we have a redditary leaders we're not England no not at all why don't you
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:58.520]  do a poll for me on the info wars throw my name in against Hillary and Bernie
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:02.360]  Sanders and let's see what the where the numbers show that's a great idea let's
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:06.520]  put an info wars poll up I asked Curt and Emma to do that or who I know Kurt runs
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:13.120]  the poll but right now as soon as we can who would you vote for of these choices
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:20.400]  and let's say George Norrie Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders who would you
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:25.400]  vote for on the Democratic ticket if that was your only choice who would you
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:28.520]  vote for a Democratic ticket just leave it like that Bernie Sanders Hillary
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:33.200]  Clinton George Norrie and I would imagine with our audience about 95%
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:38.280]  will be saying George Norrie but I can't do it on coast to coast because
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:43.240]  it's too skewered for me but yours may be a little different but you might be
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:46.840]  right that's a great idea and then we'll publish the results that's right give it
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:50.920]  to Matt Drudge if he puts it up as a headline that I'm beating them in your
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:55.720]  info wars poll well then maybe I may take it take it now that's an idea
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.960]  drudge I guarantee you enter the race he would put up a poll and then say who
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:03.480]  do you support George Norrie or these other people you know I could also I've
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:08.880]  done this before I've gone to Zogby I've gone to New York Times poll Mason
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:13.520]  Dixon we've paid for seven or eight polls for them to be conducted as
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:16.880]  newsmakers and to actually get those answers I could go out and do a poll of
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:20.960]  those three to scientific to see what folks would say and I have a sneaking
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:25.920]  suspicion that you'd even win in one of those just hitting the general public
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:31.040]  let's go to some phone calls here let's talk to Frank in North Carolina you're
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:34.040]  on the air with George Norrie
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:39.280]  I call gentlemen you know my understanding is that the CIA actually
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:45.920]  created or at least popularized the term conspiracy theorist as a way basically
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:49.720]  to you know discredit anybody that questioned the official establishment
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:57.960]  view or story accounting of things and you know you look into you know they
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:02.040]  say well these people they're attacked basically the people in our government the
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:05.600]  president Obama Bush whoever it's going to be you know they're attacking
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:10.520]  criticize for incompetence and having bad ideas lack of experience you know all
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:17.600]  these things when in actuality they're really probably more successful than we
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:21.840]  think in carrying out the chess moves of their master sure no absolutely no is
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:26.160]  that like it's an aptitude and at the top it's not an aptitude it is a program
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:31.640]  being implemented now they do some inept things nobody's perfect but I tend to
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:35.120]  really but yes it was declassified decades ago the term conspiracy theorist
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:40.560]  was deployed in the 60s against people that question government George your
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:45.160]  comments on that yeah Frank is absolutely correct Alex I mean it was
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:50.760]  organizations like the CIA that established the conspiracy theorist
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:55.880]  topic and title to discredit everybody to make everybody sound like they were
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:01.760]  strange and wackos and as you know when I heard that phrase back 13 years ago as
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:06.480]  I was getting into coast-to-coast I too felt that way to me it sounded like other
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:10.320]  than the Kennedy assassination story I thought you know you talk about these
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:14.240]  conspiracies and things that are going on these people are a little strange
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:20.440]  well it took a while several years doing the program where I realized that no
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:24.880]  no no it's the people who believe in the conspiracy theories who are the smart
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:30.400]  ones who are the accurate ones and I think this has backfired on the CIA there's
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:33.440]  no doubt about that I think it has and certainly they try to give attention to
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:38.280]  the most whacked-out schizophrenics online and really some sad people you know
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:42.160]  think the world is flat and the Easter bunnies are real but they're not
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:46.960]  indicative of us for you know myself for 20 years talking about the NSA and then
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:51.160]  Snowden comes out and says it and as a hero but then the establishment still
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:55.920]  says that I'm a kook because I was 18 years ahead of Snowden we'll be back
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:00.680]  with George Norrie and more calls communist China freely allows the sale

[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:12.080]  important message to the American people there's a change coming that the
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:17.560]  government isn't telling you about this change has deep implications for life
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:22.320]  in America from where you shop to the doctors you visit and the family you
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:27.600]  want to protect look I've made predictions like this before thing is I
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:33.600]  was right then too a few years ago I warned that housing prices would collapse
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:40.800]  they did before that I warned that dot-com companies would crash they did
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:46.400]  those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing to do
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:50.600]  with the stock market this will affect us all you can watch the video for free

[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:54.560]  on the air go ahead hi Alex thanks for having me on again I just wanted to say
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:58.440]  George I think it's a great idea for you to run for the Democratic ticket and
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:02.920]  what you could do is strike a deal with Trump if you win he could be your VP if
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:10.120]  he wins you could be his you know I was actually thinking if I got elected if I
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:18.340]  ran of picking hold on now Condoleezza Rice she had marching orders during the
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:21.480]  Bush administration so many of the things that happened then were not her
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:29.040]  fault but she is a sharp person and you know she skews the women vote she skews
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:34.880]  the African-American vote and she's a smart person might not be a bad
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:40.160]  selection as VP what do you think and she gave and she gave Willie Brown the
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:47.080]  warning not to fly before 9-11 so my goodness George you are something else
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:52.360]  Adam I appreciate your call let's talk to Kevin and Florida you're on the air
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:57.520]  go ahead with George Norring thank you Alex my actual actually fellow
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:02.000]  conspiracy theorist there's some in good company my actual question for George
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:08.960]  was how much aviation and or medical and scientific technology that we're using
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:14.400]  right now have we gained from like extraterrestrial information that we
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:18.400]  have found out because if it seems to me like there's too much credible
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:23.600]  information from guys like Jesse Marcel and Bob Lazar who actually are quoted
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:27.920]  the same they witness these things that we did all that we're doing right now
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:32.180]  with scientific and aviation technology on your on our own I just wanted to get
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:37.480]  you take on that and of course the late Philip Corso military expert and he had
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:43.120]  been in the military all his career he was assigned the project of giving the
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:49.600]  reversed engineer technology to companies back after the Roswell episode to
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:54.760]  get them to work on things like laser technology and chips and things like
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:59.440]  that for computers I think if one is a believer in extraterrestrial
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:04.720]  visitations and in this vast universe there's no question in my mind that we've
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:08.520]  been visited the Zacharias-Sitchin theory that we may have been seated by
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:14.480]  ETs very probable I think that we've gotten some technology I don't think it's
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:18.640]  one of those kinds of deals where they say here we're gonna give you this
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:23.920]  technology now let us abduct all these people I think this probably came as a
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:30.080]  process of as of us finding some crashed craft sure so it's not Eisenhower at
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:33.160]  area 51 hanging out with him thank you Kevin I want to get one more in before
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:37.440]  George's got to go with about a minute and a half real fast Sean go ahead from
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:45.800]  Michigan yeah yeah I found some strange stuff when I googled my last name
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:51.000]  because I I ended up finding out I'm a grandchild of project paper clip the
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:57.720]  top this is a Hadron collider is my last name he's amazing we got a jump here
[01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:01.160]  what about the Hadron collider in closing we talked about earlier but I mean
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:08.400]  that's just kind of an Atlantis example isn't it George it sure is the Hadron
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:14.200]  collider may have been developed to get great information about the universe
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:18.840]  but let's hope they don't make a mistake and create a wormhole that'll gobble us
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:23.800]  all up Alex beyond belief comms where folks can find your TV show everybody
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:26.400]  knows about the radio show but the TV shows a big hit as well beyond belief
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:30.480]  calm George thank you so much for spending all this time with us look
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:33.440]  forward to hanging out again when you in person like we did at your show in
[01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:39.800]  Toronto thanks my friend love you Alex we'll be back third hour seconds away
[01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:48.960]  here's your big report on silencers the Genesis will they be legalized without a federal stamp when cells
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:53.960]  become toxic they die early and aging sets in no one has put together a formula
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:58.280]  that focuses directly on brain health nerve growth factors and optimizing your
[01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:03.560]  cellular energy at the same time just one of the key compounds bio PQQ is
[01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:07.040]  backed by major clinical studies you want the best that's out there at the

[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:25.320]  probably notice I've been more focused less brain fog more energy and it's
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:29.000]  because a brain force there's always hidden additives in your food even organic
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.840]  food as hidden additives staring at the computer all day working doing good
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:34.840]  you're still damaging your brain ultimately we've all been dumbed down to
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:37.840]  some degree it doesn't have stimulus it doesn't have garbage in it it has
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:41.760]  natural things that do it clean you will find a brain force and other game
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:49.800]  changing products at info wars life calm or call 888 253 3139
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:55.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:59:55.840 --> 02:00:06.920]  we have you right there
[02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:17.920]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in occupied North America.
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:28.920]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:40.920]  The time to choose sides has come. We are the resistance. We are the InfoWars.
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:47.920]  This is Joe Biggs with infowars.com. Now we're standing outside of the silencer shop in Austin, Texas.
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:51.920]  Now there's word that there's a bill on the table. It's called the Hearing Protection Act.
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:57.920]  They could possibly pass to allow you, the consumer, to go out and just purchase a silencer.
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:00:59.920]  Now there's a lot of people out there when they hear the term silencer.
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:05.920]  They automatically think, hitman, some kind of special operation, super sneaky squirrel guy,
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:12.920]  popping out of the woods, shooting people. But actuality, really, all it is for is to protect your hearing.
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:14.920]  So we're going to go in here, we're going to speak to the owner of the shop,
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:18.920]  find out what he thinks about this new bill, if he thinks it's going to pass or not,
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:22.920]  and just kind of give a little information about the silencer industry.
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:26.920]  So if this does pass, that's going to be great for business, obviously.
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:27.920]  Oh, absolutely, yes.
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:29.920]  But do you think something like that's going to pass at all?
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:36.920]  I think eventually it will. I think this current law that they're proposing is more of a, you know,
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:40.920]  getting the word out there, making people aware of the issue.
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:45.920]  I don't think it'll pass in the near term, but I think five to ten years from now it could.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:50.920]  This market right now is really in the grand scheme of things, pretty tiny.
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:53.920]  You know, politically, it doesn't matter a whole lot,
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:55.920]  because there aren't enough silencers out there for it to matter.
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:59.920]  I think what's going to get silencers out of the NFA faster than anything else
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:01.920]  is just the fact that there will be more silencers.
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:05.920]  And right now, the way this market's growing, I think within five to ten years,
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:09.920]  we'll hit that critical mass where I think lawmakers will have to pay attention.
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:12.920]  I think that's the point, it's going to come out of the NFA.
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:16.920]  And then, you know, with a friendly administration and the politics lining up,
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:17.920]  I think they could come out.
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:20.920]  One of the things that they put in this law, the Hearing Protection Act,
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:23.920]  that I think is important is the tax credit.
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:26.920]  So essentially, if this law were to go into effect,
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:31.920]  basically everybody who purchases a suppressor after October 22nd of this year
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:35.920]  will get a $200 tax credit to essentially refund them for the $200 tax.
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:37.920]  I think that's one of the best things to win into the law.
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:42.920]  And the other thing I think people should consider is the American Suppressor Association
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:44.920]  is really the group behind this.
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:47.920]  And I think anybody who could support that, the ASA,
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:49.920]  I think they're doing really, really good work.
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:52.920]  So on a day-to-day basis, you said you get quite a few people,
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:54.920]  how many people are coming through and actually buying these?
[02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:57.920]  We sell roughly $3,000 a month.
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:00.920]  So for someone out there that doesn't really know about silencers,
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:04.920]  give us, you know, an example of what they do, how they're helpful
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:10.920]  and kind of get people away from that whole, you know, sniper mentality hitman.
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:14.920]  You know, realistically, silencers, first of all, they are not silent, right?
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:18.920]  They do quiet the firearm down to a level where they're safe to shoot
[02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:20.920]  without hearing protection a lot of times.
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:22.920]  They are great for new shooters.
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:24.920]  They're great for reducing recoil.
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:28.920]  They're really, really good for improving accuracy.
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:33.920]  Overall, I mean, basically think of it as instead of wearing the earmuffs on your head,
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:34.920]  you're putting them on the gun.
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:37.920]  It's just a lot more comfortable to shoot with a silencer.
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:40.920]  So if I wanted to go and buy silencer,
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:42.920]  what kind of steps would I have to go through right now?
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:44.920]  Not having, I just moved to Texas.
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:46.920]  I'm a new buyer. This would be a first time.
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:48.920]  What do I have to go through to be able to do that?
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:50.920]  You know, the process is actually pretty simple.
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:53.920]  For most people, I won't go into the details here.
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:56.920]  Most people would register using a trust.
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:59.920]  We fill out all the paper. We submit everything to the ATF.
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:02.920]  There's really nothing really for the customer to do at all.
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:04.920]  Other than just provide a copy of their trust.
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:08.920]  And then there's a $200 tax and a waiting period, which can vary right now.
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:09.920]  It's around four months.
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:13.920]  We have information about all of this on our website at silencershop.com.
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:15.920]  I really, I think that's probably the first place to go
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:18.920]  and then visiting the American Suppressor Association's website as well.
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:20.920]  All right. Well, thank you. Well, there you have it.
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:22.920]  We're here at the silencer shop.
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:33.920]  I'm Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[02:04:52.920 --> 02:05:02.920]  Wednesday night is the third GOP presidential debate in Boulder, Colorado
[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:04.920]  at the Coors Event Center.
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:07.920]  Will the candidates be forced to drink a can every time they say,
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:09.920]  Ronald Reagan?
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:10.920]  There you go again.
[02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:14.920]  Only a thousand people will be allowed in the center that seats 11,000,
[02:05:14.920 --> 02:05:17.920]  but you can join Alex Jones and the info wars team
[02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:20.920]  for live coverage and live commentary during the debate.
[02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:23.920]  This debate will be limited to the economy.
[02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:26.920]  While they'll talk about where the government's money comes from,
[02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:29.920]  will anyone ask them where their money comes from?
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:33.920]  And while they talk about where the government's money goes,
[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:37.920]  will they talk about how the government robs people with civil asset forfeiture,
[02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:41.920]  with crony capitalism, with bank bailouts, with secret corporate trade agreements
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:43.920]  and Federal Reserve manipulations?
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:45.920]  Probably not.
[02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:46.920]  But we will.

[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:31.280]  HITLER TOOK THE GUNS, STOLIN TOOK THE GUNS, MALT TOOK THE GUNS, AND ELCASTRO TOOK THE GUNS,
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:40.680]  YOU GO SHOVEZ TOOK THE GUNS, 1776 WILL COMMENCE AGAIN IF YOU TRY TO TAKE OUR FIRE ARMS, THE
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:09:02.000]  REPUBLIC WILL RISE AGAIN WHEN YOU ATTEMPT TO TAKE OUR GUNS, THE ANSWER TO 1984 IS 1776,
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:26.680]  YOU'RE LISTENING TO THE ALEX JONES SHOW. Max Kaiser, host of RT, BBC, Al Jazeera, you name it,
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:35.400]  join us, he is Max Kaiser.com, he of course is one of the inventors of one of the modern systems
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:42.600]  of trading and developed the Hollywood Stock Exchange. Look at the headlines, we've got the
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:47.560]  tie into what he's going to be breaking down today. Nine of world's biggest banks join to form
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:53.760]  blockchain partnership. We have the announcement by Citibank, they want to move to retina scanning
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:10:01.640]  for your banking activities. Eurozone crosses Rubicon as Portugal's anti-euro left banned from
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:11.200]  power. Has it become impossible to prosecute white-collar crime? Another report out of Bloomberg,
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:15.800]  yeah they've gotten rid of almost all the white-collar crime fraud investigators at the IRS,
[02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:21.680]  and only deploy them against the Tea Party. So whoever is anti-globalist, be a conservative or
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:27.880]  liberal, they get targeted here in the United States and around the world. And we have the
[02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:32.960]  EU dictatorship of private banks sucking these countries dry and saying we're going to directly
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:39.560]  tax your bank accounts with bail ins. And Janet Yellen is continuing QE Unlimited because of
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:47.320]  quote weakening job data. We see reports of a calm before the storm in October and most analysts
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:53.520]  now are saying okay the bond market's in trouble, the Chinese aren't buying US debt, how much debt
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:58.880]  can the private Federal Reserve monetize? We've got huge military flare-ups with the Chinese in
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:05.120]  the Spratly Islands, China threatening military action, really unprecedented developments with
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:11.160]  the West overthrowing Ukraine a year and a half ago, moving proxy armies in, the West being caught
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:17.040]  running Al Qaeda and ISIS. This has all the makings according to mainline historians of the kickoff
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:23.840]  of World War I or World War II. I'm not saying that's happening. I'm simply saying governments
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:27.520]  deploying armored vehicles to every town, they're digging in, they're getting weapons,
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:32.760]  billions of bullets, shangler enemies the Tea Party that's against globalism. The TPP was signed
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:38.960]  two and a half weeks ago, the details are still secret. We're going under world government,
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:47.200]  it is an incredible time to be alive. The best of times, worst of times, folks are waking up, but
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:53.920]  at the same time, people are digging in more to the ignorance. Now, we go to break in nine
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:58.440]  minutes or eight and a half minutes. I'm going to give Max Kaiser the floor to break down the
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:02.240]  economic outlook and all the different angles we just broke down and then we're going to come back
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:06.200]  from break and I'll have more questions, but Max Kaiser joining us via audio Skype. Thank you.
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:13.640]  Hey, Alex, great to be back on. Yeah, well, obviously Janet Yellen just came out with her news
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:20.880]  that she's not going to do anything with interest rates. And of course, that was only a 4% chance
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:26.960]  that she would raise interest rates for the very simple reason that you cannot taper a Ponzi
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:33.080]  scheme. You know, you've got $200 trillion in debt around the world. So if Janet Yellen raises
[02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:37.600]  interest rates, then all these banks would become immediately insolvent. So what does this mean
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:44.840]  for folks? This means that the money that's being used to pay off the elite, they are running out
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:53.800]  of tricks on Wall Street. And so they are bringing in negative interest rates, which means that you
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:58.720]  are going to be charged to keep money at the bank. They're just going to take money right out of your
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:03.880]  bank. They call it negative interest rates. And for this reason, there's a lot more interest now
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:11.280]  in gold, silver and cryptocurrencies. All of them are now trading above their 200 day moving
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:18.480]  averages. A lot of people are now revisiting gold, silver and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:25.720]  Startcoin because they want to get out of the banking system that they see is on fire and
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:34.120]  imploding. Over 50% of all the sovereign bonds in Europe right now of the two year bonds have a
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:41.600]  negative yield. That's right. 50% of the sovereign bonds in Europe are now negative yield. That means
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:46.360]  that they just confiscate your wealth. So this is coming to America. It's coming to Britain. And
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:52.160]  people, as you've been saying on your show for quite some time, it's better to be a day early than
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:57.000]  a day late when it comes to protecting yourself against all the shenanigans. So that's clearly
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:04.520]  kind of the big news of the day. And to help people, Alex, I am giving away free money today
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:12.160]  at startcoin.com. As a matter of fact, if you go to startcoin.com, I'm giving away free money to
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:18.760]  your listeners all day as a way to introduce them to cryptocurrencies, which I think is the only
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:25.440]  way to preserve your wealth. We see it happening in China right now. Millions of Chinese people are
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:31.160]  now extremely worried that these bankers are starting to confiscate their wealth and they're
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:37.120]  moving their money out quickly. And this is why we're seeing these prices now starting to move
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:44.360]  aggressively. Other than that, if you look across the financial ecosphere around the world,
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:53.840]  clearly, the reports that we're doing and the reports that you're doing are getting people in
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:15:01.640]  Washington very nervous. I see John McCain now is openly calling to shut RT down. You know,
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:07.920]  you get the pressure over there. Your shop, I know Matt Drudge is being pressured. You know,
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:12.840]  he's been on your show talking about it. So is RT. RT is being pressured every day. We get
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:17.480]  notices from the regulators from the State Department that they're coming after us. They
[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:22.640]  want to shut the Kaiser report down. They want to take us off the air. But we're going to keep
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:28.600]  doing it, Alex, because there's nobody. John McCain, you know, he's not going to stop me. Nobody's
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:39.120]  going to stop me because people deserve this information. Max Kaiser continuing along that
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:45.360]  line. Give us the big picture on where the world economy is right now. How big a deal it is that
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:51.360]  the Chinese are now for about four months not buying U.S. treasuries and are in fact dumping
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:56.400]  them and now making military threats because I'll say this, the U.S. has 180 bases, should have
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:01.360]  started a war with Russia, shouldn't have funded ISIS. But I've looked at the Spratly Island issue.
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:06.360]  It's in major dispute. China is building artificial islands and is being very, very
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:10.680]  threatening and has been entering into our territorial waters. So give me your take on that.
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:19.240]  Yeah. Well, China, you're right. They're selling U.S. Treasury bonds and they are buying gold
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:27.560]  and they have allied with Russia and Iran in a major flashpoint in the world right now called
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:37.160]  Syria and the U.S. and her allies are mucking it up tremendously in Syria and the whole world is
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:43.640]  bearing witness to the fact that the U.S. was supporting ISIS and the worst of the worst of the
[02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:51.800]  terrorists and Russia, China, Iran. These countries are actually stepping in to fill the leadership
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:59.480]  gap and the propaganda of coming out of the U.S. is being made a mockery out of it and also here
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:05.800]  in the U.K. the BBC every single night, they've come a laughing stock because they simply parrot
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:10.280]  all of the talking points that the U.S. State Department gives the BBC, they just repeat them,
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:19.960]  ad nauseam and it's just become a hellacious shell of what the BBC used to be and they're quite
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:23.560]  nervous about it. But yeah, that's right. So they're selling a lot of bonds because they
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:29.960]  recognize that the U.S. dollar is the victim of all this quantitative easing and all this money
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:34.600]  printed. When Janet Yellen prints a lot of money or when the ECB prints a lot of money
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:39.480]  or the Bank of Japan prints a lot of money, what does that do to the stock of money and
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:43.800]  circulation? It dilutes its value. Your purchasing power goes down. So the only way that they can
[02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:49.480]  keep that ball rolling to keep the mirage in place is to buy back their own bonds, buy back their
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:55.480]  own securities, but they don't have a, it's not a limitless game. The Federal Reserve Bank is now
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:59.640]  in trillions of dollars worth of this paper on their balance sheet, but it doesn't end. I mean,
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:05.960]  it has to end at some point. So they realize that they're looking down both barrels of a
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:12.360]  currency collapse and so the smart money like Russia, China and even Iran, they are buying
[02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:18.280]  gold or buying gold aggressively as we've been reporting on your show. But this is a game that
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:26.040]  cannot go on forever. And we definitely now see the telltale signs of fatigue. When they're actually
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:32.840]  going into negative interest rates, that would be the final signal to pair yourself. There's
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:39.080]  nothing behind negative interest rates except for outright confiscation like they did in 1933
[02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:43.160]  where they confiscated people's gold. That would be the next step. They just shut down your bank
[02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:48.600]  account and just say, look, the elites need your money. I'm sorry. You don't have access to it anymore.
[02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:54.280]  And it's all over. And that's coming. So and negative interest rates are the last major
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:19:03.560]  warning signal to get out of the bank. Well, Max Kaiser is our guest and you notice I'm shutting up
[02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:10.760]  because I really want to get his in depth analysis and his serious reporting. Max, when you talk
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:15.800]  about people like Dent or you talk about people like Schiff, he's right up there at the top with
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:21.640]  accurate predictions. We've been in a global implosion for several years. They say we've
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:27.960]  been in a great position that Max Kaiser is wrong. Well, no, Max Kaiser was right saying that China,
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:32.200]  he said six months ago, would stop buying our treasuries. Well, it took three months longer
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:39.560]  than he said. We're here. And he's right about nine times out of 10, whereas CNBC is wrong about
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:44.840]  nine times out of 10 on purpose. So I really want to pick his brain on where he thinks things are
[02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:52.040]  going. Leanne McAdoo will pop in live as well for five minutes on the melting down radioactive

[02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:22.200]  Max Kaiser of MaxKaiser.com joins us. Max, you know I'm not tooting your horn. It is true
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:27.640]  that different guests have predicted different pieces of this. You predicted the downturn
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:35.000]  earlier than it was admitted. You predicted that they would start not buying US treasuries and
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:41.800]  then at first that would actually look like they were bolstered as other people running
[02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:47.480]  and start buying them. But now it's come true. Where do you see the interest rates going now?
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:54.120]  It was in CNBC today, negative. You said here two years ago, six months ago, it's on your site.
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:57.640]  You predicted negative interest rates. What does this signify?
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:02.360]  Right. Yeah, I did say that there would, we would see negative interest rates
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:13.000]  and that at the time was seen as an impossibility and yet it has come. The collapse that I've been
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:20.040]  talking about and other guests have been talking about is being delayed because you have around
[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:29.080]  the world big central banks working together to buy their own bonds. They issue a bond and then
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:37.160]  they buy it back. They are monetizing their own debt and this is what we see every single time
[02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:43.320]  or currency collapses. The difference today in 2015 than in previous eras is that this is the
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:49.320]  first time in history you've got all the major central banks around the world working, coordinating
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:57.160]  together because you do have a world governor. You do have treaties like TPP which gives a select
[02:26:57.160 --> 02:27:04.760]  group of corporations sovereignty over any state. So they are able to coordinate globally their
[02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:12.680]  central bank activities so they have been able to delay this comeuppance if you will in the
[02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:19.080]  markets where finally the paper currencies and over the past 300 years the number of paper
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:25.240]  currencies that have survived is exactly zero. None of them have survived. The average lifespan
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:32.040]  of a paper currency is less than 30 years and this is going to be the case going forward and
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:38.360]  but negative interest rates was at the time was seen as heresy as impossible. We now have them
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:43.080]  in places like Sweden they're already starting to roll these out on and the retail environment.
[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:49.160]  When you go to the bank they are now starting to take money out of your account. Sure wasn't
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:53.560]  Switzerland first two years ago starting this? In Europe different countries in Europe they've
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:59.080]  gone in and out of this and now it's becoming more of a general trend all over Europe and soon
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:05.960]  it'll just go global. We've seen it in outright confiscation obviously in places like Cyprus.
[02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:12.600]  We saw confiscation in Greece and then this is a form of confiscation. It's called negative
[02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:16.360]  interest rates. They'll tell you there's an economic theory behind it. They'll tell you that
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:22.280]  this is needed to support what we hope to be growth and we're supporting jobs and we have these
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:28.120]  academics who will tell you why their PhD that they wrote supports this idea and why it's healthy
[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:33.160]  for everybody but at the end of the day it's just confiscation. They're just taking money out of
[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:40.280]  your account because the debt is so huge hundreds of trillions of dollars that they've run out of
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:46.200]  ways to pay that debt and now they're just stealing the money outright. So in these banks
[02:28:46.200 --> 02:28:53.080]  there's a place where it's extremely unsafe to do business with these banks. So you've got right
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:59.160]  now I will alert you to what's happening in the crypto space because I was the first person on
[02:28:59.160 --> 02:29:03.880]  your show to talk about cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin but what's happened in the last year is
[02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:10.200]  two years ago crypto coins and Bitcoin were laughed at particularly on Wall Street but now
[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:16.440]  Wall Street is getting in on the game. American Express is now introducing a crypto coin. Citibank
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:22.920]  is introducing Citicoin. All the banks in London are experimenting with cryptocurrencies but we
[02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:30.120]  have a problem because their cryptocurrencies are centralized cryptocurrencies. That's my next
[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:35.720]  question. Max Kaiser, sit back, relax, three minute break then Makado comes on for a few minutes to
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:41.000]  give us an update. We're coming right back to you. We want to hear from you how you think this shakes
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:45.720]  out and how people protect themselves in this volatile environment. We'll look at military
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:30:00.920]  operations as well and take phone calls. Stay with us. Coming up this Wednesday the 28th from
[02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:06.440]  7 to 10 p.m. Central Info Wars is going to be here live analyzing the Republican debates. A look
[02:30:06.440 --> 02:30:11.880]  at all the BS and propaganda that's going on in these debates. People need to understand we're not
[02:30:11.880 --> 02:30:16.520]  doing this to promote any one particular candidate because we know at top levels that these guys are
[02:30:16.520 --> 02:30:21.160]  at a lot of them are pretty much fixed horses just like Trump has said himself. He picks up the phone
[02:30:21.160 --> 02:30:24.840]  at three in the morning he calls whoever the candidate is he says hey I need you to do this
[02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:28.760]  favor for me then they hop up and do it. He's saying that the political system is broken and I
[02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:33.720]  could not agree more with that. We're doing this more as a way to educate the general public about
[02:30:33.720 --> 02:30:38.200]  the left-right paradigm and how you don't have to choose between a republican and a democrat.
[02:30:38.200 --> 02:30:42.440]  It's going to be on CNBC and they say that some of the hot issues that they're going to be talking
[02:30:42.440 --> 02:30:46.920]  about this time around are going to be taxes, retirement, spending, and job growth. So stay

[02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:16.760]  and max keiser.com with more of his analysis and hopefully more of his predictions because we want
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:21.320]  to see what it thinks is coming in the future because he's been pretty darn accurate on most
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:26.920]  of his predictions in the past after we talked to leon macadoo here is a clip of one of many
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:33.640]  reports her and josh owens have filed outside st lewis at the big manhattan project site now i
[02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:38.680]  told him i said i don't want you going to this unless you really volunteer it's not my idea it
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:44.120]  was leon's but she's a tough cookie she went out there and it's been burning for two years but now
[02:34:44.120 --> 02:34:49.080]  it's getting into the radioactive area the good news is is it was only about double what the
[02:34:49.080 --> 02:34:54.280]  normal background radiation is and that could happen on a sunny day with the geiger counters
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:59.800]  jakari found fish that had 10 times the normal 14 times the normal in san francisco the media
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:05.560]  didn't believe it sent reporters out there this is two years ago and they said yeah we found that
[02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:10.680]  the army went and confirmed jakari's readings we never claimed to be professional you know
[02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:16.280]  radiologists we had professional geiger counters and a field meter and we just you know that were
[02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:23.000]  calibrated and we showed the numbers and then the army went out and confirmed it and it caused a
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:28.520]  debate so here's a clip of one of her reports when she was right outside the fire zone within
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:33.800]  a hundred yards yesterday here it is i just got a phone call from don chapman she's the founder of
[02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:41.400]  just mom's stl as well as st louis rad waste legacy dot com she called to let us know that right now
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:48.040]  the landfill is experiencing a leachate leak it's huge dawn what's going on there's 10 to 11 000 gallons
[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:53.880]  of leachate leaking right now back in the field down there leachate is very toxic it's from the
[02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:58.440]  landfill it's created from the burning superfund materials and garbage that are occurring right
[02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:05.400]  next to you it's it we understand that a force main broke and the leachate 10 again 10 to 11 000
[02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:11.160]  gallons of it leaked that's what you're smelling right now you're smelling the actual uh odors
[02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:15.320]  and emissions from that leachate right and we're not going to be able to stay here too long because
[02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:21.080]  i'm literally feeling burning sensation in my chest so this leachate uh you call it
[02:36:21.080 --> 02:36:27.800]  uh dump what it like dump juice basically uh but this is the radioactive material that's here in
[02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:36.680]  this landfill now leak 10 000 gallons and by the way i mean the crew you know went out there i think
[02:36:36.680 --> 02:36:40.920]  they need respirators not just mass she the locals on with paper mass i guess that might help a little
[02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:45.400]  bit but the issue here is these things are all over the country we spent a few minutes with leanne
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:49.560]  she's followed a bunch of reports and we're going back to max keiser of max keiser dot com but this
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:54.120]  for me is indicative of the establishment not caring look at fukushima look at all these other
[02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:58.760]  examples leon your skype was breaking up too bad earlier thank you for spending so much time out
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:03.960]  there i've kind of told you i want you to get out of the area but you're still back there on top
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:09.880]  of the radioactive hill of waste that's starting to leak leon macadam well we actually uh alex
[02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:14.200]  that's right we are back here at the west lake landfill i know i know you told us to fall back
[02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:18.600]  but we we wanted to come get some geiger counter readings of our own just for our own personal
[02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:23.000]  peace of mind uh happy to report that on this side of the perimeter everything is fine we're
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:28.600]  getting them in the high 40s of course we'll probably be fine the issue is for the families
[02:37:28.600 --> 02:37:35.720]  that have to be here every single day encountering that toxic material now as you can see behind me
[02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:42.440]  this is the leachate this is where the leachate is stored and it's leaked more than 10 000 gallons
[02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:47.720]  yesterday what what happens with leachate it's kind of a water that's pumped through the landfill
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:54.360]  um and it's it's absorbs some of the undesirable particulates in the landfill which a lot of
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:58.840]  people complain about it because of you know it'll cause pollution things like that the issue here is
[02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:04.040]  that this particular landfill there is radioactive material so this is what the families are concerned
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:09.640]  about is how are you allowing this to you know leak into the air and things like that if if we know
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:15.160]  that there is now a radioactive material here on this site and i talked to you privately earlier
[02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:19.400]  you were pretty emotional like we're talking to people with their informed children uh there's
[02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:25.800]  neighborhoods around this uh report that to folks you know it has been a very emotional here we've
[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:29.640]  got some reports that are going to be coming up later uh where we actually got to sit down with
[02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:35.400]  some of these families and there is a huge cancer cluster in the area it's not from this particular
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:43.160]  landfill but it's from the same manhattan project waste that has been dumped all around this city
[02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:47.880]  in many different areas and so uh we're we've spoken with people who are actually involved
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:54.760]  there at malincrot chemical works uh their parents died their um their children have died
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:39:00.040]  and then also we are speaking speaking with people who uh were playing around in the creek
[02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:05.160]  in the 80s when a lot of the material in the soil the sediment was being moved and shuffled around
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:11.640]  when they were trying to create new subdivisions little did they know that there was 240 thousand
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:17.640]  industrial waste barrels buried underneath that ground where the waste was from the manhattan
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:22.520]  project and so they were just putting pushing the sediment around these families they're planting
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:27.160]  gardens in their yard thinking they're doing good feeding their children fresh fruit and vegetables
[02:39:27.160 --> 02:39:34.520]  and now there is a huge cancer cluster in the area uh this area alone has 300 000 people and 45 cases
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:40.120]  of appendix cancer which just to put that in perspective you should see maybe one in a hundred
[02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:45.640]  thousand here it's just it's outrageous all sorts of cancers like i said birth defects um
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:51.240]  autoimmune disease sure and so we need to take this seriously because these manhattan project sites
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:56.360]  are all over the nation well exactly and again you've got 90 plus percent of the 440 something
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:40:00.040]  reactors worldwide leaking i'm gonna ask max keiser about this in a moment i know he's been
[02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:06.440]  passionate on it we've got all these other uh research reactors at universities that are leaking
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:11.160]  and now they just cover it up when it leaks the EPA as you know you reported yesterday
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:15.880]  is just saying oh we're not worried about it it's no big deal and just what is the attitude of the
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:20.840]  establishment to dump this type of garbage you filed five reports i know you've got some other
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:24.200]  interviews you're going to do and then you're going to come on back leon because we don't want you to uh
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:30.120]  you and josh to suffer the same fate as those locals i think the bottom line is people should
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:36.600]  research where they live right and try to not live close to these toxic landfills even if the government
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:41.400]  says it's nutritious absolutely and that's what the families are fighting for is just to keep better
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:46.200]  track of this so people can know if they're moving into these communities they didn't even know that
[02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:51.800]  there was um the manhattan project was being worked on in st louis until a few years ago these families
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:55.880]  they wouldn't have bought their homes here if they knew that they were building are going to build
[02:40:55.880 --> 02:41:02.760]  right next to a radiological waste no the community was not told if they had lead paint in their homes
[02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:08.600]  they would have to be told but they weren't even they had no idea and so it's just very frightening
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:13.240]  and like i said you know this is all across the country and a lot of people don't understand why
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:19.560]  they're coming up with these rare cancers why they're 30 years old 35 years old dying from cancer
[02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:24.920]  or why their children are born with brain tumors you know that you see in 70 year old men so it's
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:29.160]  it's a pretty big deal and they're just trying to get the government and the state government
[02:41:29.160 --> 02:41:34.760]  to do something about it because this is going to happen to this next generation of people
[02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:39.000]  with this waste right now that's right leon and be sure i know you already said i have this set up
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:43.480]  don't let us bug you with these live broadcasts because we can air all this later in the week
[02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:48.680]  and next week get those interviews with those parents i mean fukushima happened four plus years ago
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:52.920]  they said we were conspiracy theorists to say that it would hurt children now they admit
[02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:57.640]  the rates of cancer thyroid cancer in children are some of the highest in the world
[02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:03.400]  within 100 miles of fukushima so this attitude of just calling people conspiracy theorists
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:09.320]  is such a serious crime by these elites and it really frightens me to think who's running things
[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:14.760]  leon macadoo and josh elwin's great job when are you planning to come back to austin we'll be flying
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:19.240]  back thursday night so we'll we'll see you there friday i'll be doing the info wars nightly news
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:24.840]  all right well let's have you and josh in studio on friday leon thank you so much thank you well
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:29.640]  there goes leon macadoo i appreciate max keiser uh giving a part of his interview for that because
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:35.160]  her skype wasn't working or our skype wasn't working earlier it was working now important info max
[02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:40.440]  i think this ties in to the derivatives into everything else that the establishment has
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:46.520]  never been perfect but they're more reckless than ever with derivatives and toxic waste and
[02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:53.000]  hadron colliders and wars with china and russia in the middle east i mean you what do you think's
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:57.000]  going on with the establishment and i want you to get in more into where you think the economy's
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:04.760]  going well i talked to you about my my theory what i call interest rate apartheid and we all
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:10.600]  know what apartheid is when you have a portion of the population put into a ghetto essentially
[02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:17.080]  and they are deprived basic services and we've seen this famously in south africa and in other
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:24.600]  places but an interest rate apartheid is where you have uh some of the population able to borrow
[02:43:24.600 --> 02:43:31.320]  money at zero percent and make bets in the financial markets and if those bets are paid off they can
[02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:37.080]  keep the profits but if the bets go bad then they get bailed out by the state that's what happens to
[02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:42.120]  the people living on the right side of the interest rate apartheid wall if you're living on the wrong
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:48.200]  side of the interest rate apartheid wall then you are borrowing money on your credit card is 16 percent
[02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:53.880]  you're engaged with credit with the payday lenders who might charge you an annualized rate of 3000
[02:43:53.880 --> 02:44:00.360]  or 4000 percent if you admit if you're exactly it's it's it's atrocious uh if you miss the payment
[02:44:00.360 --> 02:44:05.720]  you get charged you get nickle and dime you get harass on the highway it's you know seizures of
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:11.320]  wealth on the highway etc so this is the interest rate apartheid so if you unless you're able to
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:16.680]  borrow money at zero percent and i mean a million ten million five million fifty million no questions
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:22.680]  asked then you're living in a ghetto you live in the wrong side of this whole economic bandango
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:27.480]  and you are living like a second or third class citizen so everyone listening to your show should
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:31.640]  ask yourself this question can i go out and borrow ten million dollars at zero percent interest right
[02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:40.680]  now and if the answer is no then welcome to the ghetto if i want to buy a house i've got to pay
[02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:45.800]  and i've got good credit six percent interest seven percent interest and i've got to put 20 30 percent
[02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:51.800]  down that i don't even have i mean it's crazy and people would think i'm quote wealthy of course i'm
[02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:58.760]  not i mean imagine getting 50 million dollar loan at zero percent interest how do you enter that club
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:03.480]  max kaiser's well i mean okay so you're buying a house you'll pay six percent what have you
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:10.520]  now look at uh firm like black rock on wall street they're buying a whole um development in manhattan
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:17.720]  with thousands of units and they'll get a total tax break their cost of funding will be under zero
[02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:23.960]  percent it'll be less than zero percent they'll get a tax abatement and they'll get all these properties
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:30.360]  essentially for uh way below market value uh and that's because they live on the right side of the
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:34.200]  interest rate apartide wall they know the right people they go to the right meetings they make
[02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:38.840]  the right bribes i think if you ask me how do you get on the right side of this it comes down to
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:45.400]  bribery just like any other tin pot dictatorship like america or any other dick you know dictatorship
[02:45:45.400 --> 02:45:50.280]  it's all about bribes these guys know who to bribe and when i was working on wall street
[02:45:50.280 --> 02:45:54.520]  to get the good deals you had to bribe the compliance officer you had to bribe the
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:59.240]  national sales manager you had to bribe the regional sales manager this is the way business
[02:45:59.240 --> 02:46:06.440]  has done in america today unfortunately it's no longer ameritocracy it's it's really degraded into
[02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:13.240]  an economy based on bribes kickbacks insider trading which is legal if you're a washington
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:17.720]  senator or congressman you don't you don't have to comply with insider trading laws
[02:46:17.720 --> 02:46:26.120]  and you're just gifted money as long as you rubber stamp military actions and as long as you rubber
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:34.600]  stamp every god forsaken policy and low interest rates and corruption you get the big fat juicy
[02:46:34.600 --> 02:46:39.560]  reward look at nancy pulhose or any of these people in washington they when they they become
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:44.440]  multi-millionaire simply because they're corrupt and they just yeah she showed up worth less than
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:50.520]  a million and last time i saw she's worth like 188 million i think but that's not the real scam
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:57.480]  i'm saying her husband made billions look at eric holder former attorney general of the united
[02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:02.600]  states he's now back on wall street working for a wall street firm milking it for millions tens of
[02:47:02.600 --> 02:47:09.720]  millions probably a hundred million dollars he's he's the guy who said i'm sorry but these banks
[02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:15.480]  are too big to prosecute now there's a theory going around wall street that if your crime is
[02:47:15.480 --> 02:47:20.920]  complicated enough then no jury will be able to understand it so therefore you're innocent
[02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:28.120]  this has just been borne out by several cases where juries were told about bankers committing
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:33.880]  massive fraud and when they got through explaining what the fraud was using derivatives etc the jury
[02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:38.280]  couldn't make any sense of it because it's ultra complicated so they said well then i guess they're
[02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:44.360]  innocent this goes back to the dot com bubble the 2000 era frank quattrone he worked at a bank called
[02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:52.440]  swiss uh credit swiss he was caught red-handed engaging in a scam called laddering ipos it's
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:58.360]  an old trick on wall street he was caught red-handed he went before the jury they argued their case
[02:47:58.360 --> 02:48:02.600]  and they concluded that well the juries do stupid to understand this so we're gonna he's free he's
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:09.160]  innocent by virtue of stupidity of the american people and now it's just gone systemic almost
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:13.320]  every single banker in the world now go to a court and say well what how did you steal the money
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:18.600]  well we use an out of the money butterfly put spread and hedged it with a futures contract wrapped
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:22.760]  in a credit default swap and that's how we did it the jury will say what does that mean and the
[02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:27.560]  judge will say you're innocent because you're too stupid this guy's innocent go go to get an MBA
[02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:34.440]  go get a doctorate to finance and come back in 30 years well i've always said corruption is able
[02:48:34.440 --> 02:48:39.400]  to hide in complexity and that's exactly what's going on with these derivatives i mean you really
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:44.680]  look at them they're just incredibly complex frauds so they can sell them hundreds of times over
[02:48:45.480 --> 02:48:49.320]  but at its basis it's a fraud selling the same house more than once
[02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:54.920]  selling the same more mortgage more than one person let's dig into that let's dig into that
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:59.400]  a little bit a little bit because you you're absolutely correct that selling the same thing
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:05.480]  more than once is fraud and it's at the root of these problems in on wall street there's a term
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:12.200]  called hypothecation where you are using securities as collateral for loans the reason why london
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:19.560]  is the center the global center for all the major financial scandals aig made off the london whale
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:26.760]  leeman brothers is because only in london do they provide for infinite rehypothecation and when you
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:32.840]  define what that means it means that you can sell the same security in infinite number of times to
[02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:40.440]  an infinite number of of clients you could and so therefore you can imagine that there's quite a
[02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:46.440]  bit room for fraud why did leeman go under because if you looked at their books you discovered that
[02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:52.760]  they had assets that they had sold a hundred or two or three hundred times now when those people
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:57.960]  come to collect they can't all get their money right so it's an ultimate Ponzi scheme but it's
[02:49:57.960 --> 02:50:02.920]  legal it's legal in the city of london that's why all countries and all major banks outsource
[02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:08.920]  their major crime to the city of london because it has the most lacked regulatory environment of
[02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:14.360]  any jurisdiction in the world i want to go to break in this next little six minute segment
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:18.680]  hopefully do five more in the next hour before we hand the baton to david night to get to steven

[02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:35.080]  depression max it never got out of depression it's just you had a sugar high from a real
[02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:42.280]  state bubble but now that's popping again well even mainstream media now says okay stuff's bad
[02:50:42.280 --> 02:50:47.720]  but we've always known it's never really gotten better unless you're part of the select chosen
[02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:53.240]  inside corporations and groups but now they're all having to get armored redoubts and dig in
[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:57.000]  and have escape plans i mean that doesn't sound like winning to me we'll be back

[02:54:08.760 --> 02:54:13.480]  writers did and of course I'm demonized in the report Southern Poverty Law Center
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:20.280]  has come out and says quote conspiracy theories originating on the extreme right
[02:54:20.280 --> 02:54:24.920]  have invaded American political life and that's not good for democracy Southern Poverty Law Center
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:30.120]  and they basically call for restricting free speech SPLC calls parents against common core
[02:54:30.120 --> 02:54:36.040]  conspiracy terrorist SPLC attacks the first amendment that's some of the key reports up on
[02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:41.960]  info wars.com so it's very very important Max Kaiser I want to go to some phone calls right now but
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:47.560]  whether it's people on the left or the right speech is being restricted all over Europe right now
[02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:54.440]  we're seeing it here and I think that's part of this gulag casino economy you've warned about
[02:54:55.720 --> 02:55:00.120]  well look what's going on in Portugal they just had an election the left one most of the votes
[02:55:00.120 --> 02:55:05.560]  but the government the ECB the unelected bureaucrats of the eurozone came in and said we're not going
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:11.720]  to respect those results so that's right that's mainstream news that it's a dictatorship basically
[02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:17.880]  I have it right here right it's a dictatorship so it's a and they respond they answer to the TPP
[02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:23.240]  and other global I mean what you talked about New World Order for years uh you know it's hard to
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:30.040]  argue that we're not now living in this corpocracy where these corporations have sovereignty over
[02:55:30.040 --> 02:55:36.920]  any state we just saw and let's listen to this the president has banned the left from power
[02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:45.320]  okay well that's the london guardian saying doesn't say the government's become dictatorial and
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:50.600]  banned the new elected government that wants to leave the EU they just say the left's been banned
[02:55:50.600 --> 02:55:56.280]  from power right and for those listeners that will say well that's good because i'm a right wing guy
[02:55:56.280 --> 02:56:00.360]  well you know next week it'll be the right wing is banned from power it doesn't matter if you're
[02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:05.640]  left or right your power as as an individual is being banned sure they got right wing germans
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:11.000]  trying to get out of the EU they're trying to ban them right now you're right so it's the only buddy
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:16.440]  that has any power you know get back to my interest rate apartheid if you can borrow unlimited amounts
[02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:22.040]  of money at zero percent interest rate no one can compete you can buy assets you can buy power you can
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:27.320]  bribe people and you create this one percent or one tenth of one percent that becomes a global
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:31.880]  club talk you're absolutely dead on target dion in illinois dion you're on the air with max keiser
[02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:38.040]  yeah max i want to know where is the united states going to go through hyperinflation
[02:56:38.040 --> 02:56:44.120]  like venezuela and don't the central banks favor inflation instead of deflation
[02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:50.120]  that's a good question yeah well first of all this inflation question is kind of interesting
[02:56:50.120 --> 02:56:56.520]  particularly in the united states because or or here in britain they'll say that the inflation
[02:56:56.520 --> 02:57:03.320]  number might be one negative one percent or at zero percent or maybe one percent but if you go
[02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:07.160]  into the grocery store you'll notice that over the past couple of years all the package goods
[02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:13.640]  the prices that remain the same but the servings inside those package goods are ten percent less
[02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:18.440]  twenty percent less thirty percent less there's a story out right now you can do a search for it
[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:23.960]  where the company called soda stream they're selling the exact same product the exact same size package
[02:57:23.960 --> 02:57:28.920]  but it's seventy percent less product now that's hyperinflation that's hyperinflation right there
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:33.000]  you're just paying seventy percent more for that product so it's it's what's it's called shrink
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:38.200]  inflation sure it's a stealthy inflation now the question is do wouldn't they prefer inflation
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:45.240]  to pay their debts and the answer is that look in viewed in that way of course it's better to be
[02:57:45.240 --> 02:57:49.880]  able to pay your debts off with ever decreasing money the value of your money is constantly
[02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:55.640]  going down yes but we live in a in a world where these big banks and central banks no matter how
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:58:01.400]  much money is being created or pumped up the balance sheets of these big banks still are
[02:58:01.400 --> 02:58:06.680]  collapsing and they're still aggregating more debt and that is what we call deflation so if you
[02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:11.480]  want to get down to the nitty gritty here we live in a a world where we have deflation in a macro
[02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:14.680]  sense on the bank's balance sheets that's what i've always said it wouldn't you call it like
[02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:20.280]  hyperstack inflation you could do that sure hyperstack inflation is as good a term as any
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:23.800]  i haven't said that for years because the real economy shrinks you get paid less but things
[02:58:23.800 --> 02:58:28.760]  cost more the ultimate screw job it's not supposedly able to happen in a real market

[03:00:01.240 --> 03:00:07.800]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[03:00:07.800 --> 03:00:13.800]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network let's move quick now through your calls with bill
[03:00:13.800 --> 03:00:20.760]  brandon tubius and a few others bill you're on the air from california with max kaiser okay and
[03:00:20.760 --> 03:00:26.440]  are you there yes i am this i have a theory that since our money is going to be worth actually
[03:00:26.440 --> 03:00:30.600]  nothing and i keep getting these credit cards let me back it up a second um my wife and i're
[03:00:30.600 --> 03:00:36.120]  both retired living on a fixed income we have no hard assets in our names so they can't come after us
[03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:40.680]  why not take all these bank credit cards i have run them up gotten by all the food i want the guns
[03:00:40.680 --> 03:00:45.720]  i want whatever else else i want what are they going to do about it in the end they can't take
[03:00:45.720 --> 03:00:50.680]  anything from me right yes but they're trying to change the laws to bring back debtor prisons max
[03:00:50.680 --> 03:00:57.240]  kaiser well the caller is is correct i but i would suggest that to make that effective
[03:00:57.880 --> 03:01:04.360]  do an online campaign and get 10 20 30 million people to do it at the same time then you win
[03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:08.200]  yeah because they're getting all this free money and trying to pass an honest get to us
[03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:13.960]  i mean i i never endorse something like this is kind of sounds immoral but if it is fiat money
[03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:21.000]  from these crooks why not screw them i agree but for an individual to do it the odds are not in
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:25.960]  their favor but if that individual started a campaign online and said on this date in three
[03:01:25.960 --> 03:01:32.200]  months from now i want a million or 10 million people to do exactly what he described then he
[03:01:32.200 --> 03:01:37.320]  would have an enormously powerful message being sent to the crooks but then they could argue that
[03:01:37.320 --> 03:01:42.600]  you were organizing a fraud and maybe indict you for racketeering i mean but alex you and i
[03:01:42.600 --> 03:01:46.520]  have this conversation before when you have a revolution you're going to break a few eggshells
[03:01:46.520 --> 03:01:51.240]  no i get it i get it i understand it i just fundamentally don't like not paying a debt
[03:01:51.240 --> 03:01:56.200]  off but i get it's all fraud and fiat to begin with and it's kind of like in another fictional
[03:01:56.200 --> 03:02:02.280]  event that they use is debt you see i mean you talk about gun rights because you're concerned
[03:02:02.280 --> 03:02:10.840]  about people with guns i'm saying that the true evil is being perpetrated using debt no i get
[03:02:10.840 --> 03:02:16.200]  it's weaponized it's weaponized that that's what i'm saying you need to load those debt bullets
[03:02:17.560 --> 03:02:20.920]  all right bill interesting point very interesting point brandon in florida go ahead
[03:02:20.920 --> 03:02:29.880]  max um basically my question was how are they going to sugarcoat uh these negative interest
[03:02:29.880 --> 03:02:35.400]  rates to american um like how are they going to get that to be in our interest you know besides
[03:02:35.400 --> 03:02:39.880]  maybe saying that it's going to stimulate the economy but if you know everyone found out like
[03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:44.440]  you said that they're going to be basically just taking money out of your account just for having
[03:02:44.440 --> 03:02:49.160]  it i mean how is that going to pass well it's a good good question so i mean opens up two or
[03:02:49.160 --> 03:02:54.760]  three points here remember there was a confiscation done in 1933 they confiscated people's gold and
[03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:59.800]  they put all that gold as something called forks and they just digitally grab it out from your bank
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:04.360]  under these new executive orders for economic emergencies but so so we know that yeah so
[03:03:04.360 --> 03:03:08.920]  how do they sugarcoat it i think there's two ways to sugarcoat it number one as you point out it'll
[03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:15.560]  be sold as a temporary measure that we need to finally break the back of this depression
[03:03:15.560 --> 03:03:20.280]  and get the economy back on feet so it'll be presented like that it's a one-time bail in
[03:03:20.280 --> 03:03:26.120]  of your bank account if you don't do it you'll lose everything right in 1971 nixon said it'll
[03:03:26.120 --> 03:03:31.880]  be a short term measure for america to close the gold window and take off our obligations in the
[03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:37.720]  gold market of course that has been with us now for over 40 years the second way is for there to
[03:03:37.720 --> 03:03:44.680]  be concerted propaganda so they need a scapegoat and obviously russia in rt is the scapegoat
[03:03:44.680 --> 03:03:50.760]  with john mccain uh out there you know saying close down rt etc so they need a scapegoat russia
[03:03:50.760 --> 03:03:55.960]  is emerging as the scapegoat du jour and so the politically and economically they'll hit you from
[03:03:55.960 --> 03:04:01.800]  both ends that's right we gotta jump max excellent points as usual so buy us in oregon quick question
[03:04:01.800 --> 03:04:08.920]  final question for max keiser yes comment to max our jury is is a backbone of our entire system
[03:04:08.920 --> 03:04:13.160]  and a little caveat to what he was saying about the stupidity of the public basically in the jury
[03:04:13.160 --> 03:04:19.640]  system is simply that uh it's supposed to be a jury of our peers and a jury of our banking peers
[03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:26.200]  of good moral standing would have been able to convict that man i that's that's that's true
[03:04:27.240 --> 03:04:33.080]  but you know the jury process a system is highly corrupt as well if you watch any of these top
[03:04:33.080 --> 03:04:37.560]  shows they bring in all kinds of consultants and they're constantly figuring out ways to rig
[03:04:37.560 --> 03:04:42.920]  the jury and before i go alex let me point out that if you ever saw that film idiocracy
[03:04:42.920 --> 03:04:51.240]  which points to how stupid america can get it was set in the year 2015 absolutely it was supposed
[03:04:51.240 --> 03:04:55.480]  to be like 20 200 and something but it's actually happened you're right max we'll talk to you soon

[03:08:07.880 --> 03:08:16.680]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david
[03:08:16.680 --> 03:08:20.120]  knight your host in this fourth hour wrap-up jacari jackson is going to be joining me at
[03:08:20.120 --> 03:08:24.520]  the bottom of the hour we're going to have some reports from leon macadoo on the site of a toxic
[03:08:24.520 --> 03:08:31.800]  waste dump in st louis that uh there is a fire nearby that's what happens when you have the
[03:08:31.800 --> 03:08:35.720]  government cleaning up your environment we've talked about what happened with the uh gold mine
[03:08:35.720 --> 03:08:43.080]  that the epa exploded causing a massive massive dump of toxic waste into rivers that spanned over
[03:08:43.080 --> 03:08:47.560]  a couple of states in the course we've got the blm trying to steal people's land here in texas
[03:08:47.560 --> 03:08:53.720]  we covered that last night on the nightly news i was really i i read a long excerpt from governor
[03:08:53.720 --> 03:08:59.080]  abbott's letter to the blm because i thought it was the quality of something you would see
[03:08:59.080 --> 03:09:04.440]  from the founding fathers and i'm i'm serious i'm i'm genuinely not impressed with politicians
[03:09:04.440 --> 03:09:08.520]  uh if you listen to me very much you'll know that i'm very cynical i'm very cynical about
[03:09:08.520 --> 03:09:13.240]  the presidential candidate so we have uh when it comes to politicians but i've said over and over
[03:09:13.240 --> 03:09:19.560]  again we need to have someone at the state level who understands respects the constitution obeys
[03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:25.320]  the constitution that will stand up for our rights when the federal government steps across the line
[03:09:26.520 --> 03:09:32.600]  our founders gave us a government of checks and balances because they knew the greatest danger
[03:09:32.600 --> 03:09:39.800]  was consolidation concentration of power which is what we've seen and we've seen these abuses come
[03:09:39.800 --> 03:09:45.320]  as the power has been concentrated what we need to have are informed jurors we need to have a
[03:09:45.320 --> 03:09:51.320]  citizenry who will stand up and watch the back of their fellow citizens in court whether it's the
[03:09:51.320 --> 03:09:54.760]  federal government or whether it's the state government or the local government that's outlined
[03:09:54.760 --> 03:09:59.800]  we need to have fully informed juries that's very important but we also need to have state
[03:09:59.800 --> 03:10:05.240]  nullification and so that letter if you haven't seen that letter you need to see what governor
[03:10:05.240 --> 03:10:09.480]  abbott wrote to them and said you're just stealing people's property they've worked here for generations
[03:10:09.480 --> 03:10:14.760]  i'm not going to allow you to do that you took an oath to the constitution and that constitution
[03:10:14.760 --> 03:10:19.800]  you took an oath to prohibits you from doing this so it's good to see that i thought that was very
[03:10:19.800 --> 03:10:23.960]  positive news of course we're going to have the debate coverage live tonight as part of the info
[03:10:23.960 --> 03:10:30.440]  wars nightly news we're going to have live coverage and commentary of the third gop debate it's going
[03:10:30.440 --> 03:10:34.040]  to be on the economy jacari jackson is going to be joining me at the bottom of the hour we're going
[03:10:34.040 --> 03:10:38.760]  to give you some previews about some of the things that may be talked about tonight and of course
[03:10:38.760 --> 03:10:43.240]  some of the things that they won't talk about the things that we will talk about and i have to say
[03:10:43.240 --> 03:10:49.160]  too that i've seen a couple of people write comments and say you guys are are talking over
[03:10:49.160 --> 03:10:53.400]  the debate and it's like yeah we do play the debate and then we do talk over it at some points
[03:10:53.400 --> 03:10:58.120]  in time and we play subtitles so that we know what they're saying so that you can see what
[03:10:58.120 --> 03:11:01.480]  they're saying and of course you can listen on another device if you want to listen to the
[03:11:01.480 --> 03:11:07.400]  debate live but you need to understand this is kind of a mystery science 3000 debate we give
[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:13.640]  it the respect that it's due and we also if you want to think of it think of it as the commentary
[03:11:13.640 --> 03:11:18.840]  track on a dvd that's probably the best way to to think about that they're constantly talking
[03:11:18.840 --> 03:11:23.240]  and we're constantly talking we do let them talk occasionally when they get on to actually
[03:11:23.240 --> 03:11:28.840]  a policy issue but we're there to make commentary and that's what we do now i looked at the news
[03:11:28.840 --> 03:11:34.120]  today and you know it was just a week ago that we had back to the future day uh october 21st
[03:11:34.120 --> 03:11:40.280]  2015 where everybody was that was the day in the back to the futures trilogy the second one where
[03:11:40.280 --> 03:11:46.200]  they went 30 years in the future from 1985 and i looked at this story that's been covered on a
[03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:55.000]  number of news or places daily males got it the uh new york daily news has got it there's this
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:58.680]  kid skateboarding and i thought you know this is what would really have happened
[03:11:58.680 --> 03:12:04.680]  to marty mcfly if he had come 30 years in the future he would have had a police officer
[03:12:05.480 --> 03:12:11.320]  tackle him off of his skateboard throw him on the ground jump on him put a choke hole on him
[03:12:11.320 --> 03:12:19.080]  pepper spray him because skateboarding is illegal now okay so not only do we make something that
[03:12:19.080 --> 03:12:26.920]  isn't a crime and to a crime but then of course we go over the top with force with brutality even
[03:12:26.920 --> 03:12:32.120]  using things that could kill someone in this particular instance you have a new york cop
[03:12:32.680 --> 03:12:39.080]  locking his arms around a guy who is his name is uh yibin mu 22 years old locking it around his head
[03:12:39.080 --> 03:12:43.240]  taking him into the ground in the center of columbus circle in new york city on sunday
[03:12:43.240 --> 03:12:49.560]  he put this youtube video of of it happening you can hear people in the uh in the park saying yo yo
[03:12:49.560 --> 03:12:54.360]  here we go again says another person and he says uh he was charged with resisting arrest
[03:12:55.400 --> 03:13:00.040]  you look at this he's not resisting arrest but resisting arrest for what i mean shouldn't you
[03:13:00.040 --> 03:13:05.960]  have to be breaking a law if you're if you're getting arrested but disorderly conduct and
[03:13:05.960 --> 03:13:11.800]  failure to comply with posted signs just because it is so important to not have people
[03:13:12.760 --> 03:13:19.880]  writing skateboards i remember back in 1985 literally we had a business and we had some
[03:13:19.880 --> 03:13:23.960]  kids in the neighborhood of your likes to who would like to skateboard around the retail center
[03:13:23.960 --> 03:13:28.680]  i had no problem with it but even then we had cops who would chase them and it's like hey this is
[03:13:28.680 --> 03:13:32.600]  private property i pay the rent on this property if i don't mind if they're skateboarding on the
[03:13:32.600 --> 03:13:37.000]  sidewalk we didn't have people walking on the sidewalk in any numbers and they weren't causing
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:40.360]  a problem nobody was complaining about it but they were getting harassed by the police trying to
[03:13:40.360 --> 03:13:45.720]  grab them and uh we would let them duck into our into our business and hide in the back from the
[03:13:45.720 --> 03:13:50.200]  police because it's not a crime they weren't doing anything to hurt anybody as a matter of fact one
[03:13:50.200 --> 03:13:54.600]  of these guys became one of our longest term employees who was salutary in at the high school
[03:13:54.600 --> 03:14:04.520]  he was a good kid and these police and the way they're acting in night in 2015 versus 1985 is
[03:14:04.520 --> 03:14:09.640]  just insane and of course we have this new article on info wars dot com no charges against a cop
[03:14:09.640 --> 03:14:14.840]  involved in a controversial shooting of a teen and a federal lawsuit the family family says the
[03:14:14.840 --> 03:14:21.480]  teen was shot in the side and in the back you can see that article up on info wars dot com
[03:14:21.480 --> 03:14:25.640]  right now they say no criminal charges will be filed against a south carolina cop who killed a
[03:14:25.640 --> 03:14:33.000]  19 year old during a drug stain because you know we've got to do this war on drugs thing that hasn't
[03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:39.320]  worked for 44 years but let's not stop trying let's just keep doing the same thing over and over
[03:14:39.320 --> 03:14:44.840]  again even though we get no results from it that truly is insanity it's murder it's theft it's
[03:14:44.840 --> 03:14:50.280]  corruption it's illegal because there is no authority to show me the amendment i'll say this every
[03:14:50.280 --> 03:14:54.760]  time we talk about this show me the amendment that gives them the authority to prevent anything
[03:14:55.480 --> 03:15:01.400]  they needed an amendment to prohibit alcohol the fda wants to prohibit your medical drugs
[03:15:01.400 --> 03:15:05.800]  they need an amendment as well they just assert that they have the authority we've let them get
[03:15:05.800 --> 03:15:09.560]  away with it it's time we say you know what we're going to read the constitution we're going to
[03:15:09.560 --> 03:15:14.760]  enforce the constitution you don't have authority to do any of this stuff that you're doing the fda
[03:15:14.760 --> 03:15:19.240]  the dea people want to look at this and say where is the constitutional amendment for your authority
[03:15:19.240 --> 03:15:25.880]  there is none and then of course as i talked to zoltan isfan the humanist who came in the other day
[03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:32.600]  it was interesting right after that conversation that this story came up a salon worker
[03:15:33.240 --> 03:15:40.040]  praised cryotherapy then froze to death during a treatment and see this is what i think really
[03:15:40.040 --> 03:15:46.600]  comes up with people who have a blind trust and trendy technology and i think that's one of the
[03:15:46.600 --> 03:15:51.400]  worst things that we can do is to look at every piece of technology that comes along and just
[03:15:51.400 --> 03:15:55.880]  say hey you know we're going to i want to give it a try because that that would just be great
[03:15:55.880 --> 03:16:03.880]  imposing the most rosy scenario possible outcomes no actually if it's something to do with my health
[03:16:03.880 --> 03:16:10.360]  and i would think that you know as i talked to zoltan isfan yeah he was into implants he was
[03:16:10.360 --> 03:16:14.840]  into brain you know implants into his arm he was into implants into his head and it's like
[03:16:14.840 --> 03:16:20.760]  you might want to look at the people who came up with this idea look at their long history look
[03:16:20.760 --> 03:16:26.760]  at where they're going this is an idea coming from darpa this is about government control
[03:16:27.400 --> 03:16:33.560]  and it may have immediate health effects to you as well i mean it was designed to do that but
[03:16:33.560 --> 03:16:37.240]  of course they put a beard on it they say i know these brain implants are just to help
[03:16:37.240 --> 03:16:45.720]  help veterans with ptsd in this story of this cryotherapy this salon worker had just tweeted
[03:16:45.720 --> 03:16:50.440]  out how great it was shortly before she died and they show a tweet here somebody else saying
[03:16:50.440 --> 03:16:56.360]  hey i'm going to test the cryotherapy chamber i'm taking the ice bath into the future ice bath
[03:16:56.360 --> 03:17:02.120]  into the future there you go maybe it's an ice bath into eternity yeah that's where a lot of
[03:17:02.120 --> 03:17:09.720]  this creepy tech is going we also have another gwhiz technology article here and i see this
[03:17:09.720 --> 03:17:15.720]  increasingly from wired magazine it used to be that only popular science would just look at everything
[03:17:15.720 --> 03:17:21.400]  that came out whether it was from darpa in the military industrial complex or from a private
[03:17:21.400 --> 03:17:25.960]  company and everything is just great never have a problem with any of this stuff i'm sure there's no
[03:17:26.600 --> 03:17:30.840]  question about the side effects or anything now we see this from wired magazine it's like
[03:17:30.840 --> 03:17:37.400]  they're under some kind of new editorial leadership here cars that talk to each other are much easier
[03:17:37.400 --> 03:17:41.160]  to spy on that's about as much as you're going to see them push back anymore and they're talking
[03:17:41.160 --> 03:17:47.240]  about talking cars this is v2v it's what they call it what the department of transportation
[03:17:47.240 --> 03:17:52.600]  calls it v2v vehicle to vehicle communication and of course they were going to come out with
[03:17:52.600 --> 03:17:57.160]  mandatory regulations at the end of 2015 now the feds are going to introduce their mandatory
[03:17:57.160 --> 03:18:03.000]  regulations the end of this year they're trying to accelerate it yeah that's right obama doesn't
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:09.960]  just fast track globalist trade treaties he's also fast tracking ways to control and monitor
[03:18:09.960 --> 03:18:14.360]  everything you do in terms of your transportation that's going to take a couple of years even after
[03:18:14.360 --> 03:18:18.440]  they come out with these mandated regulations it'll take a couple of years before you're going to be
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:24.600]  forced to pay for this in your cars and they will probably force you to get it retroactively
[03:18:24.600 --> 03:18:30.040]  they may grandfather it in but they may force you to buy some devices for your existing cars
[03:18:30.040 --> 03:18:35.000]  and they say of course it promises to drastically reduce collisions and traffic jams but it will
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:41.400]  come at a cost to your privacy a car that never shuts up will be a lot easier to track that's
[03:18:41.400 --> 03:18:45.640]  even coming from wired magazine they say researchers in the netherlands in germany have found they
[03:18:45.640 --> 03:18:49.640]  can use just a few thousand dollars worth of equipment to track a vehicle that's submitting
[03:18:49.640 --> 03:18:55.160]  the so-called connected vehicle wireless communication proposed for future vehicle to vehicle
[03:18:55.160 --> 03:18:59.960]  communications with only two five hundred and fifty dollar devices strategically planted at
[03:18:59.960 --> 03:19:04.680]  intersections they were able to follow unique signatures on cars radio communications and
[03:19:04.680 --> 03:19:08.200]  they say what's going to happen is this car is going to be going down the road and like i said
[03:19:08.200 --> 03:19:12.840]  many many times before yeah they're talking cars and they're going to be talking about you they're
[03:19:12.840 --> 03:19:18.760]  going to be saying i'm alice here's my location this is my speed this is my direction here's my
[03:19:18.760 --> 03:19:24.200]  address if you want to send me a ticket here's who i am if you want to raise my insurance rates
[03:19:24.200 --> 03:19:30.840]  and oh by the way nsa and uh the rest of the geospatial intelligence looking at your activity
[03:19:30.840 --> 03:19:35.960]  based intelligence your human domain analytics you if you want to map me and know everything
[03:19:35.960 --> 03:19:41.320]  that i'm doing so you can put me into your pre crime matrix turn me over to your algorithms
[03:19:41.320 --> 03:19:45.960]  and see what pops up here's all of my information i mean what could be better than that what we're
[03:19:45.960 --> 03:19:52.440]  going to talk about the southern poverty law center when we come back they're pushing back against us
[03:19:52.440 --> 03:19:55.880]  essentially going down point by point we're going to talk about a few of the things that
[03:19:55.880 --> 03:20:03.560]  they're saying and why they're so scared we'll be right back earthquake floods winter storms
[03:20:03.560 --> 03:20:08.760]  prolonged power outages or war each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to
[03:20:08.760 --> 03:20:13.480]  be better prepared we typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the
[03:20:13.480 --> 03:20:19.160]  need for water but have you considered heat storage i'm talking about staying warm in the cold here
[03:20:19.160 --> 03:20:24.600]  are some things for you to consider how will i keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood
[03:20:24.600 --> 03:20:29.400]  coal or propane but the problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with
[03:20:29.400 --> 03:20:34.840]  you another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of
[03:20:34.840 --> 03:20:40.520]  war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly
[03:20:40.520 --> 03:20:46.040]  than you think for these answers go to fortress clothing dot com again fortress clothing dot

[03:25:19.560 --> 03:25:24.280]  now this report from the SPLC listen to the beginning of this listen to how this starts at
[03:25:24.280 --> 03:25:29.880]  the very top when i immediately when i saw this and read these two things i thought yeah and i
[03:25:29.880 --> 03:25:35.240]  think you'll see what i mean conspiracy theories originating on the extreme right have invaded
[03:25:35.880 --> 03:25:41.000]  american political life and that's not good for democracy not actually it's not good for the southern
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:46.280]  poverty law center when you say that when they say that they've invaded american political life and
[03:25:46.280 --> 03:25:52.040]  they write this massive report i mean look at how big this thing is when they say it's invaded american
[03:25:52.040 --> 03:25:58.840]  life in other words people understand that it's true this has credibility it has street credibility
[03:25:58.840 --> 03:26:03.880]  it's far more credible than the government's stories and that's a problem for them so they
[03:26:03.880 --> 03:26:07.480]  have to try to push back on this and they start out with a quote from francis bacon
[03:26:08.040 --> 03:26:14.680]  and this is a quote they say there's nothing makes a man suspect much more than two no little
[03:26:14.680 --> 03:26:18.040]  and i look at that and i thought well okay that's kind of our cake language
[03:26:19.320 --> 03:26:22.600]  and i thought are they using the word suspect as a verb or a noun
[03:26:24.120 --> 03:26:29.320]  you know do i do i suspect what the government is doing is a verb uh because uh
[03:26:29.960 --> 03:26:35.720]  hey i know that the government official story is a constantly changing lie they're known liars
[03:26:35.720 --> 03:26:41.000]  we've seen them lie constantly and they give us one improbable impossible story after the other
[03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:46.200]  let me give you a quote from you want to quote francis bacon fine let me quote you what's your
[03:26:46.200 --> 03:26:51.960]  like home said or arthur conan dole actually and he said once you eliminate the impossible
[03:26:52.680 --> 03:26:58.280]  which is typically what the government is telling us then what's left no matter how improbable
[03:26:58.280 --> 03:27:04.280]  is the truth we call ourselves truthers what's the opposite of truthers liars liars in the
[03:27:04.280 --> 03:27:08.680]  government they have to work hard to hide this information from the public that's one of the
[03:27:08.680 --> 03:27:14.680]  things that makes them suspicious okay that's one of the things that makes us suspect this is a fact
[03:27:14.680 --> 03:27:20.920]  that they are working so hard to hide everything from us they give us lies and just look at the
[03:27:20.920 --> 03:27:25.400]  circumstances around vengazi or look at the circumstances around the recent hospital shooting
[03:27:25.400 --> 03:27:31.480]  in afghanistan with vengazi we were told that it was a filmmaker this little obscure ridiculous
[03:27:31.480 --> 03:27:36.360]  film that nobody had ever heard of they actually wound up jailing the guy and we were told that
[03:27:36.360 --> 03:27:41.000]  was what was behind it i mean just one lie after the other and then of course the fact
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:46.040]  that they jail any whistleblowers who expose their criminal actions or maybe kill them
[03:27:47.160 --> 03:27:52.360]  okay and of course they would they would love to jail or kill snowden how many times have you
[03:27:52.360 --> 03:27:59.160]  seen people go on national tv saying that they would love to kill or jail snowden left and right
[03:27:59.720 --> 03:28:04.040]  left and right folks because just as i pointed out last night the nightly news daily beast has
[03:28:04.040 --> 03:28:10.120]  become the biggest cheerleader for drone wars for sass nation strikes i mean just absolutely
[03:28:10.120 --> 03:28:14.280]  disgusting article and i won't go back into that again you can look at last night's nightly news i
[03:28:14.280 --> 03:28:19.080]  talked about it in the on the news on sunday as well i believe but of course even though they
[03:28:19.080 --> 03:28:25.960]  jail people who expose their crimes no one in the government ever goes to jail for any crimes okay and
[03:28:25.960 --> 03:28:31.000]  neither do their partners you know you don't send anybody in the irs to jail yeah maybe they will
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:35.880]  impeach the head of the irs we'll see what happens the gop is finally trying to do something with
[03:28:35.880 --> 03:28:39.480]  that but of course law's learner they said oh we're not going to prosecute her we're the justice
[03:28:39.480 --> 03:28:46.200]  department the justice department the justice department that refused to prosecute hsbc after
[03:28:46.200 --> 03:28:50.520]  being caught multiple times even after they were put on probation they went out and they caught them
[03:28:50.520 --> 03:28:57.320]  again laundering money for the senilea drug cartel el chapo the guy that everybody was so concerned
[03:28:57.320 --> 03:29:04.040]  about breaking out of prison well they had he had his own special window that was set up by hsbc
[03:29:04.040 --> 03:29:09.320]  just for money laundering and of course you have ubs and many others who are laundering money for
[03:29:09.880 --> 03:29:16.040]  drug cartels for terrorist organizations but the justice department obama's justice department
[03:29:16.040 --> 03:29:22.520]  says it wouldn't serve public interest for these people to go to jail so this is the splc and of
[03:29:22.520 --> 03:29:31.480]  course the splc whose founder morris deis only involvement in the civil rights struggle in 1960s
[03:29:31.480 --> 03:29:38.040]  was to defend the coup cluck's clan for a massive amount of money that splc i did a report on that
[03:29:38.040 --> 03:29:46.360]  once called the profits pr o f i t s the profits of hate yes splc is spewing its hate stay with
[03:29:46.360 --> 03:29:50.840]  us we'll be right back with jacquard jackson we're on the march the empires on the run

[03:33:16.680 --> 03:33:21.960]  fourth hour news wrap up joining me in this half hour is jacarie jackson welcome jacarie thank you
[03:33:21.960 --> 03:33:26.840]  david now i was just talking about this southern poverty law center article i would say article
[03:33:26.840 --> 03:33:32.280]  it's a massive book here going down point by point the kind of stuff that we've been covering here
[03:33:32.840 --> 03:33:36.920]  pretty extensively i thought it was interesting like i said when i looked at this and they said
[03:33:36.920 --> 03:33:41.320]  nothing makes a man suspect more than to know little and i thought hmm are they talking about
[03:33:41.320 --> 03:33:47.560]  that as being a verb or noun and of course i talked about why we suspect them as a verb
[03:33:47.560 --> 03:33:51.080]  okay why we suspect what the government tells us but of course what they're trying to do
[03:33:51.080 --> 03:33:57.960]  is turn everybody who disagrees with the government into a suspect noun okay that's
[03:33:57.960 --> 03:34:02.040]  what this is all about that's what we're seeing with the strong cities network just like the
[03:34:02.040 --> 03:34:07.960]  southern poverty law center this strong cities network that was announced at the un with the
[03:34:07.960 --> 03:34:13.240]  attorney general is something that is initiative think tank that started in europe they're also
[03:34:13.240 --> 03:34:18.200]  going to be involved in in running that and just like the southern poverty law center if you want
[03:34:18.200 --> 03:34:24.520]  to look up the terms radical islam what you will find is not any any articles about what radical
[03:34:24.520 --> 03:34:31.480]  islam is doing in the united states instead what you will see are articles saying anybody that talks
[03:34:31.480 --> 03:34:36.920]  about radical islam islamic islamic phobic okay or xenophobic if you're talking about that you're
[03:34:36.920 --> 03:34:43.320]  islamic phobic nothing at all about what radical islam is doing and of course both of those are
[03:34:43.320 --> 03:34:47.400]  true i mean there are people who are xenophobic okay but there's also reasons to be concerned
[03:34:47.400 --> 03:34:52.040]  about that if you talk exclusively about one of these basically what you're doing is you're
[03:34:52.040 --> 03:34:56.760]  manipulating people and we know that's precisely what the southern poverty law center has been doing
[03:34:56.760 --> 03:35:01.560]  and that's exactly where morse these has hung out he's he set out the entire civil rights movement
[03:35:01.560 --> 03:35:07.880]  of the 1960s the only involvement was to defend the Ku Klux Klan when they went in and burned buses
[03:35:07.880 --> 03:35:13.480]  and beat protesters they set out the rest of it and then jump back in in the 1970s after he had
[03:35:13.480 --> 03:35:18.680]  done a direct mail campaign for McGovern he thought hey i could make a lot of money and so what he did
[03:35:18.680 --> 03:35:23.400]  was he worked for the McGovern campaign got a mailing list of about 700 000 people and then
[03:35:23.400 --> 03:35:29.160]  reinvented himself as not somebody who was now an ally of the Klan like most of the southern
[03:35:29.160 --> 03:35:33.880]  democrats had been like morse these had been in the 1960s he had been an ally as a southern
[03:35:33.880 --> 03:35:41.080]  democrat of the Ku Klux Klan then he comes out as their sworn enemy you know uh david the thing
[03:35:41.080 --> 03:35:45.880]  i noticed about this article i took a glance at it earlier today like i said it's it's quite dense
[03:35:45.880 --> 03:35:49.720]  it's going to take some time to go through but they were talking about you know alex and trying
[03:35:49.720 --> 03:35:54.520]  to link him into these anti-government groups and the thing that's interesting about me whether we
[03:35:54.520 --> 03:35:59.320]  talk about police brutality or you know NSA spying or all these other things that are currently going
[03:35:59.320 --> 03:36:05.400]  on in the country a lot of people are speculated or have speculation about the activities and the
[03:36:05.400 --> 03:36:11.160]  intentions of the federal government right now as opposed to you know what's going on in the streets
[03:36:11.160 --> 03:36:15.160]  because they say it's anti-government to question the government but you know when you see these
[03:36:15.160 --> 03:36:20.040]  videos that come out every day of police brutality so if you want if you say you want police reform
[03:36:20.040 --> 03:36:24.040]  is that being anti-government if you see these stories about the NSA spying you say i won't
[03:36:24.040 --> 03:36:29.000]  stop the NSA spying is that being anti-government whether it's you know drones or drugs or any of
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:33.400]  these other things that continue to happen they just act like if you have any type of criticism
[03:36:33.400 --> 03:36:37.720]  or even knowledge of these things in the first place you just some weird conspiracy theories
[03:36:37.720 --> 03:36:41.880]  because you're actually concerned about things that happen in the real world yeah exactly and
[03:36:41.880 --> 03:36:45.480]  and the very first one of these and they go through like 10 12 of these different ones the
[03:36:45.480 --> 03:36:53.080]  very first one here is number one common core is a plot against our children i mean they had
[03:36:53.080 --> 03:36:58.040]  some pretty bad timing because it just broke in the news all over the place that kids are getting
[03:36:58.040 --> 03:37:05.000]  marked as wrong when they say uh three fives equals 15 other ones you write down five threes equals
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:08.360]  15 if they're trying to teach the multiplication we got something called the commutative principle
[03:37:08.360 --> 03:37:11.960]  oh they don't want to tell them that they don't want to talk about that but as you're saying
[03:37:11.960 --> 03:37:17.240]  with that article we do have kids article splc calls parents against common core conspiracy
[03:37:17.240 --> 03:37:22.200]  theories yeah now we've documented this extensively talking about uh how they want to say two plus two
[03:37:22.200 --> 03:37:28.200]  equals uh you know whatever six twelve whatever number they they want it to be and now we see more
[03:37:28.200 --> 03:37:32.120]  and more of this of people being marked wrong in their tests because they do their math in the
[03:37:32.120 --> 03:37:36.200]  correct way this is like and we've seen the articles previously you need to come with those
[03:37:36.200 --> 03:37:40.840]  friendly numbers whatever that means you know just just the most ridiculous things that you
[03:37:40.840 --> 03:37:46.200]  could imagine absolutely absurd and of course going back to uh the 1980s charlotte isabee who
[03:37:46.200 --> 03:37:50.360]  was in reagan's department of education reagan should have shut down the department of education
[03:37:50.360 --> 03:37:54.280]  he said he was going to shut it down it had just been created by jimmy carter it was less than four
[03:37:54.280 --> 03:38:00.360]  years old he could have killed that in the cradle and he should have but nevertheless it continued
[03:38:00.360 --> 03:38:05.000]  on charlotte isabee saw what was going on she dropped out and with phyllis schlafly the two of
[03:38:05.000 --> 03:38:10.760]  them wrote a book called the deliberate dumbing down of america oh of course that's a right wing
[03:38:10.760 --> 03:38:15.640]  conspiracy theory nobody's trying to make the kids stupid nobody's trying to dumb down our children
[03:38:15.640 --> 03:38:21.560]  and then you look at this kind of stuff five plus five plus five equals 15 no that's wrong
[03:38:21.560 --> 03:38:25.640]  well david you even see it on mainstream television they have that show are you smarter than a fifth
[03:38:25.640 --> 03:38:30.280]  grader you know where adults go out there and they can't answer you know regular basic math
[03:38:30.280 --> 03:38:35.320]  and then we always see those comparisons of a grade school math 50 years ago as opposed to
[03:38:35.320 --> 03:38:40.280]  it is today and a lot of people have difficulties solving these problems so whether it's deliberate
[03:38:40.280 --> 03:38:44.920]  or not there has been a dumbing down in the united states of america well there was the article we're
[03:38:44.920 --> 03:38:47.320]  going to have the presidential debate tonight we're going to talk about that there was the
[03:38:47.320 --> 03:38:53.560]  article that came out this weekend or the end of last week saying that donald trump has uses
[03:38:53.560 --> 03:39:01.480]  in his speeches a fourth grade level of communication yeah they score these things and of course
[03:39:02.200 --> 03:39:09.320]  there's a reason he does that because that they found that the dumber your speeches are
[03:39:09.320 --> 03:39:13.560]  the more popular you are okay that the ones who are doing the worst or the ones who had
[03:39:13.560 --> 03:39:19.080]  the speeches rated at the highest grade level and let's not even talk about what george washington
[03:39:19.080 --> 03:39:24.200]  wrote that would be an 18th grade level not a fourth grade level so yeah it is a deliberate
[03:39:24.200 --> 03:39:28.920]  dumbing down and when the southern poverty law center says no you know the common core is just
[03:39:28.920 --> 03:39:35.160]  a set of standards there's no curriculum there's no test it's like absolute baloney absolute what
[03:39:35.160 --> 03:39:40.200]  is it if it's not curriculum what is it if it's not test if you have a test and they admit oh yeah
[03:39:40.200 --> 03:39:44.280]  they're coming up a common core test we all understand anybody that's been involved in
[03:39:44.280 --> 03:39:49.640]  education uh my wife has a master's degree and many people my family taught i went to school
[03:39:49.640 --> 03:39:55.560]  actually and uh anybody that's been in school knows that if you define the tests you define
[03:39:55.560 --> 03:40:00.920]  the curriculum and you can use these national tests to impose your curriculum even on private
[03:40:00.920 --> 03:40:06.280]  schools and that's the essence of this so just even the very first one i mean really bad timing
[03:40:06.280 --> 03:40:14.200]  from the splc on this absolutely absurd now earlier in the show we had lienne macadoo calling in live
[03:40:14.200 --> 03:40:20.440]  from st louis and of course she is at a hot spot near a nuclear waste near st louis and there is a
[03:40:20.440 --> 03:40:26.360]  landfill fire that is raging towards that radioactive waste here's a short overview
[03:40:26.360 --> 03:40:31.960]  that she posted that you can see on info wars dot com lienne macadoo reporting for info wars dot
[03:40:31.960 --> 03:40:36.840]  com i'm here in st louis missouri as you can see it's a very rainy day i'm standing just outside
[03:40:36.840 --> 03:40:42.680]  of the radioactive west lake landfill it's located in a densely populated suburb of st louis
[03:40:42.680 --> 03:40:50.600]  50 000 tons of highly radio toxic uncontained nuclear waste lies just beyond that fence it's
[03:40:50.600 --> 03:40:57.000]  st louis's nuclear legacy remnants from the cold war but if that wasn't bad enough there is a simmering
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:41:03.960]  underground fire in an adjacent landfill just about a thousand feet away and that fire is creeping
[03:41:03.960 --> 03:41:10.200]  ever closer every single day to the nuclear waste of course if the fire reaches the nuclear landfill
[03:41:10.200 --> 03:41:16.280]  that has the possibility to release a toxic plume of radioactive smoke into the air threatening the
[03:41:16.280 --> 03:41:22.040]  residents here in st louis those residents are growing increasingly concerned an evacuation plan
[03:41:22.040 --> 03:41:27.640]  was just sent home with school children warning parents what to do in the event that one of these
[03:41:27.640 --> 03:41:34.120]  radioactive plumes is released that includes sheltering in place or evacuating the area entirely
[03:41:34.120 --> 03:41:38.680]  we're going to be here for the next few days covering this state of emergency as well as the
[03:41:38.680 --> 03:41:43.320]  epa's response to what they're going to be doing with this nuclear waste we're going to be interviewing

[03:43:27.720 --> 03:43:33.880]  and when you eat all these toxins if you ate mcdonald's nuggets 20 years ago that had
[03:43:34.840 --> 03:43:40.760]  plasticizers in them your gallbladder and your liver doesn't know what to do so the liver basically
[03:43:40.760 --> 03:43:48.280]  excretes that into the gallbladder and it holds it just google gallbladder stones and it's disgusting
[03:43:48.280 --> 03:43:54.280]  but you need to look at it and when you finally get filled up with these it bursts or it gets
[03:43:54.280 --> 03:43:59.640]  infected they've got to remove it and we'll scroll through these there's even grosser ones
[03:43:59.640 --> 03:44:05.160]  like let's scroll down on average they're green or black if they're black they're really old and toxic
[03:44:05.160 --> 03:44:13.640]  they're generally green and this stuff's meant to be passed out of you but we eat such artificial food
[03:44:14.920 --> 03:44:19.560]  that it doesn't these are way beyond kidney stones you name it you also have liver stones
[03:44:22.120 --> 03:44:27.640]  and medical doctors won't tell you on average hey flush your liver they'll just say hey your liver
[03:44:27.640 --> 03:44:31.880]  sick it's going to get progressively worse we're going to get you on a list for a liver transplant
[03:44:31.880 --> 03:44:37.800]  it is unbelievable we're showing these disgusting images so
[03:44:38.520 --> 03:44:43.080]  about a year and a half ago Anthony Guciardi just said man i just did a doctor ribs liver cleanse
[03:44:43.080 --> 03:44:48.520]  the one he recommends and he's developing this proprietary stuff he's testing on himself right
[03:44:48.520 --> 03:44:55.080]  now you really got to do it the results are dramatic after six days and i'm like no way no
[03:44:55.080 --> 03:44:59.480]  way i'm doing it i don't believe that there's giant black or green balls in my gallbladder
[03:44:59.480 --> 03:45:05.640]  and this is how ignorant i am how does the apple cider vinegar organic with the oxy powder and
[03:45:05.640 --> 03:45:11.720]  with the liver trucks over to six day cleanse how does it then when you take the olive oil at the end
[03:45:11.720 --> 03:45:17.000]  lay on your side for an hour as you go to sleep why does it then have the the gallbladder release
[03:45:17.000 --> 03:45:24.120]  what you should do and this is what our proprietary research led us to do back starting in the early
[03:45:24.120 --> 03:45:30.200]  90s when we were looking at the best ways to cleanse the liver was to develop an herbal formula that
[03:45:30.200 --> 03:45:36.280]  contains herbs that will help soften or break down these globules or these stones in the liver and
[03:45:36.280 --> 03:45:41.880]  the gallbladder and that's really what the first five days is for that's where you mix the bottle
[03:45:41.880 --> 03:45:46.760]  of liver shield you pour the whole bottle in a gallon of distilled water and then you drink four
[03:45:46.760 --> 03:45:53.400]  eight ounce glasses a day of that four or five days at the same time though you're also using the
[03:45:53.400 --> 03:45:58.760]  apple cider vinegar and that's going to be the the liver flush kit that we put together exclusively
[03:45:58.760 --> 03:46:05.240]  for info wars you know viewers and the people and again you can find that information on info
[03:46:05.240 --> 03:46:10.840]  wars life dot com we have 25 off the liver cleanse pack you can see that video you can
[03:46:10.840 --> 03:46:16.920]  see exactly how to do a liver cleanse and you can save 25 off of the liver cleanse pack right now
[03:46:16.920 --> 03:46:23.080]  now jacari there's an article up today about a wi-fi device that can see people through
[03:46:23.080 --> 03:46:27.960]  concrete walls and quite frankly i've seen this technology in articles about this before the
[03:46:27.960 --> 03:46:35.000]  fact that they can use the wi-fi signals that are going through your house essentially to image you
[03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:41.400]  inside of your house people just don't realize how vulnerable we are how easy it is to surveil
[03:46:41.400 --> 03:46:50.280]  everything that we want to do from people who may not have exactly honorable intentions okay but
[03:46:50.280 --> 03:46:57.000]  that's that's just one aspect of it but of course the big enchilada is going to be the information
[03:46:57.000 --> 03:47:01.640]  that all the social media sites and google are all collecting on us all the time everything we do on
[03:47:01.640 --> 03:47:07.320]  the internet yes and now what they're doing is they're using this new bill syssa as a club over
[03:47:07.320 --> 03:47:12.040]  the head of all these social media companies tell us about that that's exactly right i have this
[03:47:12.040 --> 03:47:16.440]  article from vox you can find this on any um any news site but i like this one because they start
[03:47:16.440 --> 03:47:21.640]  off with this big picture of diane feinstein who you know david i'm a huge fan of the senate just
[03:47:21.640 --> 03:47:26.360]  passed a bill that could help the nsa spy on you and they have a nice picture of mrs feinstein right
[03:47:26.360 --> 03:47:31.400]  there on the front and talks about on tuesday the senate passed legislation that supporters say could
[03:47:31.400 --> 03:47:36.520]  boost internet security by encouraging companies to share information about online threats with one
[03:47:36.520 --> 03:47:42.840]  another and with the government and it passed 74 to 21 but a little bit down in the article
[03:47:42.840 --> 03:47:47.640]  they mentioned this not everybody is a fan of it and says it doesn't have very much support
[03:47:47.640 --> 03:47:53.240]  among security experts in the private sector and two leading technology industry trade groups
[03:47:53.240 --> 03:47:58.600]  representing giants like google apple and microsoft that are targets by hackers more than anybody
[03:47:58.600 --> 03:48:04.120]  else on the internet oppose it so you think about this david i i believe a google and apple i'm not
[03:48:04.120 --> 03:48:09.000]  sure about microsoft these were all mentioned in the prism scandal and now they're saying that we
[03:48:09.000 --> 03:48:12.600]  don't want to share our information with the government now you could say you know they
[03:48:12.600 --> 03:48:16.040]  have trade secrets whatever they don't want people looking up their skirt but maybe it's a little
[03:48:16.040 --> 03:48:20.360]  bit more than that and they just realized that they don't want their privacy to be violated just
[03:48:20.360 --> 03:48:25.240]  like it's being violated for us just like you said uh with the uh the image on the wi-fi scanner
[03:48:25.240 --> 03:48:29.880]  you also have the cia director bragging about how he's going to spy on you through your dishwasher
[03:48:29.880 --> 03:48:34.280]  and as i was saying about diane feinstein who is a cheerleader on this i also have this other
[03:48:34.280 --> 03:48:39.320]  article yeah we can look at that and let me just interject here too you know we mentioned this thing
[03:48:39.320 --> 03:48:43.720]  about oh people can look at you even through concrete walls and people kind of look at that
[03:48:43.720 --> 03:48:48.200]  and go oh that's kind of that's kind of bad that's kind of creepy just like when tom maybe went around
[03:48:48.200 --> 03:48:52.680]  with a boom mic yeah and and people on the street as they're talking on the phone or they're talking
[03:48:52.680 --> 03:48:56.280]  on a bench and he sticks a microphone in their face and they're like hey get away from me or when
[03:48:56.280 --> 03:49:00.520]  alex went into google and he sticks a camera in front of their face and they're sitting in front
[03:49:00.520 --> 03:49:05.000]  of a laptop that is recording everything that they're saying so it's just not having people
[03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:10.120]  realize where this is but i think one of the things the the companies like google and facebook and
[03:49:10.120 --> 03:49:15.880]  all these companies they're starting to get worried that people are going to i think certainly not
[03:49:15.880 --> 03:49:20.840]  the younger people but older people are starting to get concerned about this violation of privacy
[03:49:20.840 --> 03:49:25.000]  i think they think that that could hurt them to do that for them to have to do that plus they
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:31.160]  don't want to have to turn over all this information and become essentially a spy network for the
[03:49:31.160 --> 03:49:36.680]  government they've been able in the past to say hey uh i i can't give you all this information
[03:49:36.680 --> 03:49:41.160]  because this is i could get sued by these people now they're saying no no no you're not going to
[03:49:41.160 --> 03:49:46.680]  get sued so hand it over hand it over right now okay and if you don't we're going to come after you
[03:49:46.680 --> 03:49:51.400]  basically threatening them that way so they don't want to be the guy in the middle but that's the
[03:49:51.400 --> 03:49:55.160]  way the government has rolled with this third party collection of data that's what's so dangerous
[03:49:55.160 --> 03:49:59.800]  about all of this oh yeah even we've seen with the social media sites they said we won't give
[03:49:59.800 --> 03:50:04.600]  your private information to the government unless they come and ask for it yeah but some of them have
[03:50:04.600 --> 03:50:08.760]  held out twitter has held out in some cases many of these others as we've seen with the snowden
[03:50:08.760 --> 03:50:13.560]  documents have been on with this from the very beginning like microsoft shortly after that google
[03:50:13.560 --> 03:50:18.040]  came in apple was one of the last holdouts i think they probably didn't come in until steve jobs
[03:50:18.040 --> 03:50:22.600]  was gone it looked like about the time that they came on board with the nsa was about the time that
[03:50:22.600 --> 03:50:27.640]  tim cook took over so you have these different companies that have had different attitudes
[03:50:27.640 --> 03:50:33.000]  toward it but they are basically going to be at the beck and call of the nsa of the fbi of all
[03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:38.120]  these things so it's going to be a huge business cost to them even if it doesn't harm them from a
[03:50:38.120 --> 03:50:42.680]  public perspective so of course they don't want to have that that's the thing that that we all have
[03:50:42.680 --> 03:50:48.680]  to be concerned about though is that we need to understand how dangerous this is and how pervasive
[03:50:48.680 --> 03:50:53.960]  this is and now they have green-lighted it for everything stay with us when we come back jacar
[03:50:53.960 --> 03:50:57.560]  and i are going to talk about what's going to happen tonight we're going to have live coverage

[03:53:08.600 --> 03:53:13.400]  better prepared we typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the need
[03:53:13.400 --> 03:53:19.000]  for water but have you considered heat storage i'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are
[03:53:19.000 --> 03:53:24.360]  some things for you to consider how will i keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood
[03:53:24.360 --> 03:53:29.320]  coal or propane but the problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you
[03:53:29.320 --> 03:53:35.080]  another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war
[03:53:35.080 --> 03:53:40.280]  there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly
[03:53:40.280 --> 03:53:45.800]  than you think for these answers go to fortress clothing dot com again fortress clothing dot

[03:54:16.600 --> 03:54:20.520]  we're going to talk about tonight's debate in this segment and of course we're going to be covering
[03:54:20.520 --> 03:54:25.080]  that live with live commentary alex jones is going to be joining us and the rest of the info
[03:54:25.080 --> 03:54:31.640]  wars crew will be commenting on the debate tonight this third gop debate will focus on the economy
[03:54:32.440 --> 03:54:38.680]  and the elephant in the gop room is going to be this budget deal that bainer has just cut with
[03:54:38.680 --> 03:54:47.000]  obama you need to understand that when bainer back in 2011 when they first did uh some of the
[03:54:47.000 --> 03:54:53.320]  the first deal with president obama they have increased according to cns news nearly four
[03:54:53.320 --> 03:55:00.120]  trillion dollars in debt back at that point in time back in march fourth 2011 the federal debt
[03:55:00.120 --> 03:55:08.280]  was just over 14 trillion dollars then we had the debt ceiling raise you know 16 trillion 17
[03:55:08.280 --> 03:55:14.600]  trillion do i hear 20 trillion yes it's like an auction between bainer and obama you know we've
[03:55:14.600 --> 03:55:18.680]  really got now i guess we ought to have a new game show instead of let's make a deal we could have the
[03:55:18.680 --> 03:55:23.720]  trend 20 trillion dollar pyramid because that's what this whole thing is it's a pyramid scheme
[03:55:23.720 --> 03:55:27.400]  that's basically what it is it's a game show now it's a ponzi yeah and of course yeah we've got the
[03:55:28.040 --> 03:55:32.280]  multiple levels of game shows we got the celebrity big brother which is all about the personalities
[03:55:32.280 --> 03:55:38.280]  between these guys but the thing they're not going to talk about is this massive massive debt that
[03:55:38.280 --> 03:55:43.000]  john bainer is doing and of course the amazing thing about this too when we talk about bainer
[03:55:43.000 --> 03:55:47.560]  is we've got this speakerhouse race which is going to be taking place tomorrow and it's not even a
[03:55:47.560 --> 03:55:53.000]  race this is going to be a selection they have he's already selected his successor when his previous
[03:55:53.000 --> 03:55:58.200]  selected uh successor stepped down he immediately stopped that election and so now he's got somebody
[03:55:58.200 --> 03:56:03.640]  else paul ryanow and they're going to have uh he's going to be the new speaker and that's going to be
[03:56:03.640 --> 03:56:07.880]  a deal tomorrow and people aren't even paying attention to this and this is something that is
[03:56:07.880 --> 03:56:14.360]  going to affect us as much as the presidency which is another year off and you can see how this affects
[03:56:14.360 --> 03:56:19.160]  us because you can see what bainer has done with obama to get this 20 trillion dollar debt as the
[03:56:19.160 --> 03:56:23.480]  new american points out he did an in run around the usual house procedures that's what bainer does
[03:56:23.480 --> 03:56:27.400]  all the time he went over the heads of numerous committee chairman to deal directly with the
[03:56:27.400 --> 03:56:33.080]  white house in essence the deal emasculates the sequester cuts that were built into the law back
[03:56:33.080 --> 03:56:39.720]  in 2011 back four trillion dollars ago it gives obama a blank check to fund his government through
[03:56:39.720 --> 03:56:44.520]  the end of the second term expands military spending and all this other stuff that's precisely
[03:56:44.520 --> 03:56:50.280]  what they're doing again with the trade treaties i i'll be surprised really if they talk much about
[03:56:50.280 --> 03:56:54.680]  that except just oh yeah free trade is great for us they're not going to talk about the globalist
[03:56:54.680 --> 03:56:58.520]  aspects of it they're not going to talk about the secret aspect of it they're not going to talk about
[03:56:58.520 --> 03:57:03.960]  the fact that it was republicans who gave obama a blank check on these trade agreements carry and
[03:57:03.960 --> 03:57:07.480]  everybody who gets up and complains about this or we're spending money on that you have to understand
[03:57:07.480 --> 03:57:12.520]  just as you said they have a blank check to do whatever they want yeah that includes spy on you
[03:57:12.520 --> 03:57:17.640]  or includes you know put all these uh military vehicles on the streets so it always comes back
[03:57:17.640 --> 03:57:21.800]  to something these things just didn't happen overnight it's a process and this is a look
[03:57:21.800 --> 03:57:26.680]  into that process yeah it's just amazing he's going to do this bainer is going to do this
[03:57:26.680 --> 03:57:32.600]  this is a two-year deal he did it over so-called conservative opposition although they haven't
[03:57:32.600 --> 03:57:38.280]  opposed him on who he wants as speaker and of course we know that paul ryanow pushed for this
[03:57:38.280 --> 03:57:43.560]  fast-track trade authority he has pushed for open borders he's pushing for everything that they want
[03:57:43.560 --> 03:57:49.560]  for global governance but as bainer says i'm going to leave ryanow with a clean barn he says i don't
[03:57:49.560 --> 03:57:52.760]  want to leave him with a dirty barn i want to clean the barn up a little bit before he gets out of
[03:57:52.760 --> 03:57:57.000]  here well you know what if he wants to get the excrement out of the barn he needs to start with
[03:57:57.000 --> 03:58:02.920]  paul ryanow the biggest piece of bs in the congress right now tonight we're going to be talking about
[03:58:02.920 --> 03:58:07.000]  issues that they won't talk about like where do they get their money we're going to talk about
