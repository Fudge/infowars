[00:26.440 --> 00:33.240]  vote set for tomorrow to make obama king but first john bounds report on the
[00:33.240 --> 00:37.680]  attack on the second amendment that they've now launched around 9 p.m.
[00:37.680 --> 00:42.520]  charleston south carolina time horror ensued at the emmanuel african
[00:42.520 --> 00:46.720]  Methodist Episcopal church on wednesday a church immersed in an american
[00:46.720 --> 00:51.520]  historical past involving freedom of religion rebellion and oppression as
[00:51.520 --> 00:56.920]  america grew from its reconstruction roots attacked by modern society's ills
[00:56.920 --> 01:01.800]  a lurking sickness that is completely ignored as the clear exploitation of
[01:01.800 --> 01:06.720]  the hearts and minds of good americans goes unchecked within hours guns and
[01:06.720 --> 01:11.440]  white people were being blamed hours after that on the heels of getting his
[01:11.440 --> 01:16.080]  trans-pacific partnership nearly to the finish line a trade initiative written
[01:16.080 --> 01:20.440]  by corporate lawyers and designed to bypass our government and rights to a
[01:20.440 --> 01:24.880]  world government run by big banks president obama backed up the fools
[01:24.880 --> 01:29.240]  rhetoric of gun confiscation to the nation it is in our power to do something
[01:29.240 --> 01:39.840]  about it i say that recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot
[01:39.840 --> 01:44.320]  of those avenues right now obama has armed himself with a far more powerful
[01:44.320 --> 01:48.640]  weapon than a gun he has executive orders and he means to use them
[01:48.640 --> 01:52.840]  regardless of the fact that gun violence is dropped by 49 percent in the
[01:52.840 --> 01:58.720]  past 20 years 56 percent of americans believe gun crime is worse today than it
[01:58.720 --> 02:05.680]  was 20 years ago well who can blame them from 2007 to 2013 there were 16.4
[02:05.680 --> 02:11.320]  average mass shootings per year as opposed to 6.4 shootings annually from
[02:11.320 --> 02:18.120]  2000 to 2006 according to fbi crime statistics there were 1043 casualties
[02:18.120 --> 02:24.120]  and wounded americans as a result of these attacks from the year 2000 to 2013
[02:24.120 --> 02:29.520]  well maybe president obama is right then no he's wrong the facts are right
[02:29.520 --> 02:34.600]  facts that blatantly show he is ignoring major factors contributing to the
[02:34.600 --> 02:39.080]  increase there are key players to blame at work here the pharmaceutical
[02:39.080 --> 02:43.960]  companies being public enemy number one psychiatric drugs have contributed to
[02:43.960 --> 02:49.280]  nearly every mass shooting incident in the last 20 years but you won't find
[02:49.280 --> 02:53.680]  obama blaming them they gave him 20 million dollars just for his 2008
[02:53.680 --> 02:58.720]  campaign alone the other culprit is gun-free zones 92 percent of mass
[02:58.720 --> 03:03.000]  shootings since 2009 occurred in gun-free zones according to the crime
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.840]  prevention research center which created a study as a response to the
[03:06.840 --> 03:11.800]  statistically misleading every town for gun safety study blaming all white

[03:27.920 --> 03:32.240]  white america must answer for could be the most racist piece of garbage I've
[03:32.240 --> 03:35.960]  read in recent memory insinuating it is the fault of the right-wing media
[03:35.960 --> 03:41.000]  claiming white men and white families are violent and saying all white america
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.920]  is violent I can't help but challenge the author
[03:43.920 --> 03:49.720]  chauncey de vega to a debate just go look at the data chauncey black folks are
[03:49.720 --> 03:55.960]  killing black folks and white folks are killing white folks but when it comes to
[03:55.960 --> 04:00.880]  black on white and vice versa blacks double the number of whites but I
[04:00.880 --> 04:04.600]  digress the US government has been trying to take black folks guns for a
[04:04.600 --> 04:08.600]  long time but black folks aren't gonna sit idly by and listen to the president's
[04:08.600 --> 04:13.040]  rhetoric and neither is the rest of America as Obama's border amnesty
[04:13.040 --> 04:17.720]  unleashes more criminals onto American streets criminals fleeing countries where
[04:17.720 --> 04:22.880]  guns are illegal last year I reported how NC fire was tabulating the full blown

[08:40.200 --> 08:45.280]  beginning because it's true I cannot believe the position I'm in the position
[08:45.280 --> 08:54.960]  you're in the position this whole planet is in my life is basically somewhere
[08:54.960 --> 09:01.280]  between ecstasy and agony best of times worst of times there is so much
[09:01.280 --> 09:10.360]  fantastical things going on so many incredible developments culturally the
[09:10.360 --> 09:16.680]  information we have at our fingertips the just amazing discoveries life is
[09:16.680 --> 09:27.320]  incredible but hiding behind all that good is a rapidly growing cancerous
[09:27.320 --> 09:48.320]  metastasizing viral goo that is basically cultural historical fraud and its
[09:48.320 --> 09:55.080]  systems based on deception based on thievery based on disinformation based
[09:55.080 --> 10:03.000]  on dumb down populations that is the scourge of humanity we need to be at our
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.920]  highest level operating to be able to not destroy ourselves we need to be
[10:07.920 --> 10:13.720]  absolutely tuned into our better angels not our bad ones and the ruling class is
[10:13.720 --> 10:21.720]  so greedy to control and dominate the future and wall us off from it as they
[10:21.720 --> 10:29.920]  play savior of the world that we don't have a lot of hope right now on the
[10:29.920 --> 10:36.000]  course we're on that much is clear the build-up of NATO arms on the Russian
[10:36.000 --> 10:44.560]  border is unparalleled mainline historians military analysts German members of
[10:44.560 --> 10:53.920]  their military their top staff are all on record saying this is insane regardless
[10:53.920 --> 10:58.280]  of what side you're on I'm not on either side I'm on the side of humanity not
[10:58.280 --> 11:07.080]  wanting to destroy ourselves and in the midst of that removing the army of
[11:07.080 --> 11:14.240]  northern Virginia Robert E. Lee battle flag you would think is the only story
[11:14.240 --> 11:22.520]  in the country or Caitlyn Jenner nothing against Caitlyn Jenner nothing
[11:22.520 --> 11:28.800]  against the battle flag it's a distraction though overall but within
[11:28.800 --> 11:35.440]  the whole battle flag discussion you get a window into the abject ignorance of
[11:35.440 --> 11:41.720]  the public across the board including Southerners who were obsessed with the
[11:41.720 --> 11:47.920]  League of the South I've studied history they don't even know what really went on
[11:47.920 --> 11:57.600]  I mean it is an ocean of idiocy an ocean of ignorance and I'm not on some
[11:57.600 --> 12:04.280]  high horse here saying this I'm just very frustrated by it it's like a
[12:04.280 --> 12:21.440]  physical punch in the stomach a physical attack when I get up in the
[12:21.440 --> 12:30.760]  morning or I'm reading the news in the evening and I get the word that Obama
[12:30.760 --> 12:40.760]  trade as it's called has advanced out of the Senate committee it's already past
[12:40.760 --> 12:46.560]  the house and it's set to pass the Senate tomorrow that makes me physically
[12:46.560 --> 12:55.000]  nauseous like I got a phone call that a dear family member is on life support and
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.320]  the average trend you'll say why do you care fast track smash track things have
[13:00.320 --> 13:05.240]  always been corrupt just go along with it there's nothing you can do no things
[13:05.240 --> 13:09.760]  haven't always been like this when people have a laissez faire attitude they
[13:09.760 --> 13:17.160]  get conquered and enslaved every single time and we are being conquered by very
[13:17.160 --> 13:28.120]  wicked globalist it's not like we've got conquerors that are bringing us aqueducts
[13:28.120 --> 13:38.280]  and language and medicine and agrarian society we're being conquered by
[13:38.280 --> 13:52.120]  exterminist globalist that Hitler was just a spin-off of it's ridiculous and
[13:52.120 --> 14:06.640]  there are 48 Republicans that are going to vote with Democrats in the Senate to
[14:06.640 --> 14:15.280]  pass fast track the Republicans have a majority in the Senate and a large
[14:15.280 --> 14:20.600]  portion of them almost all of them are set to vote on it with a minority of
[14:20.600 --> 14:28.040]  Democrats and and this is suicidal to the country there is no doubt it's
[14:28.040 --> 14:32.680]  illegal there is no doubt it's tyrannical we have three subsections of 28
[14:32.680 --> 14:37.600]  WikiLeaks won't release the others there's got a bunch of gun control and
[14:37.600 --> 14:42.880]  stuff they like in it and open borders and everything else but senator sessions
[14:42.880 --> 14:47.440]  has seen it Walter Jones has seen part of it it's thousands of pages you have
[14:47.440 --> 14:54.920]  to go in and read it one page at a time it's nightmarish and it's set to pass
[14:54.920 --> 15:02.960]  right now tomorrow here's the headline we're gonna play the video from the
[15:02.960 --> 15:06.520]  Senate floor last chance to stop fast-track senator sessions a blast
[15:06.520 --> 15:13.520]  ugly facts let's go ahead and go to the powerful breakdown from the Senate
[15:13.520 --> 15:19.240]  floor as he warned the public yesterday here it is why do we have to create a
[15:19.240 --> 15:26.560]  transnational union an institution that has a power as I will explain to the
[15:26.560 --> 15:31.760]  impact the laws of the United States of America it's not necessary according to
[15:31.760 --> 15:37.240]  the trade representative who's negotiating and advancing this
[15:37.240 --> 15:42.480]  legislation on behalf of president Obama and he's advocating for it it will be a
[15:42.480 --> 15:50.280]  living agreement and that means that the entity itself the commission will then
[15:50.280 --> 15:57.240]  be entitled to make it say different things eliminate provisions it doesn't
[15:57.240 --> 16:03.080]  like add provisions it does like in fact the commission is required to meet
[16:03.080 --> 16:08.840]  regularly and to hear advice for changes from outside groups from inside
[16:08.840 --> 16:15.440]  committees of the commission so that they can update the situation to change
[16:15.440 --> 16:23.280]  circumstances it is a breathtaking event it says it's designed to promote the
[16:23.280 --> 16:29.200]  international movement of people services and products basically the same
[16:29.200 --> 16:38.160]  language used to start the European Union in fact I have referred to it as a
[16:38.160 --> 16:43.800]  nascent European Union I don't think that's far off base just a trade
[16:43.800 --> 16:51.480]  agreement with one friend and ally South Korea it's 12 nations in the Pacific as
[16:51.480 --> 16:56.920]  soon as that is inked we've been told and brought forward for passage in the
[16:56.920 --> 17:01.200]  Congress and historically if we give trade promotion authority the
[17:01.200 --> 17:08.280]  agreements have always passed that are presented once that one done we will have
[17:08.280 --> 17:14.920]  a transatlantic agreement and it's transatlantic agreement I suppose also
[17:14.920 --> 17:21.400]  will have some sort of commission a transatlantic union with powers that
[17:21.400 --> 17:28.160]  discipline and set rules outside the powers of the United States Congress back
[17:28.160 --> 17:31.960]  it up about a minute this is so epic I don't want to interrupt it I'm gonna
[17:31.960 --> 17:35.360]  play it up to the break come back with more of it this is one of the main
[17:35.360 --> 17:40.040]  leaders of the Senate a guy who leaked the amnesty bills three separate times
[17:40.040 --> 17:44.280]  they even tried to censoring for it but the rules say they really couldn't do
[17:44.280 --> 17:52.200]  that senator sessions is a super patriot so is Rand Paul they're not perfect but
[17:52.200 --> 17:57.200]  compared to the others I mean they're just absolutely night and day and here
[17:57.200 --> 18:05.520]  he is talking about the Atlantic Union merging the North American Union with the
[18:05.520 --> 18:11.440]  Asian Union with the EU that's the trilateral plan that Barry Goldwater
[18:11.440 --> 18:17.600]  warned of and we're the reason he says it's breathtaking
[18:18.440 --> 18:25.440]  breathtaking shocking over the top in fact when I sit here and and and watch
[18:25.440 --> 18:30.880]  this I catch myself not breathing because it's shocking America is being
[18:30.880 --> 18:40.200]  conquered right now by secret boards and we can't even see it it's epic I got a
[18:40.200 --> 18:50.680]  big vocabulary man but it's epic epic epic epic breathtaking and the reason
[18:50.680 --> 18:53.480]  we're in so much trouble is the average American doesn't even know this is going
[18:53.480 --> 18:59.560]  on and just goes trade deals it's not a trade deal it's Congress transferring
[18:59.560 --> 19:04.880]  what little power it's got left into the hands of the president to commit us to
[19:04.880 --> 19:08.320]  an international agreement run by the very same people that founded the
[19:08.320 --> 19:15.040]  European Union as a trade deal in secret England and the UK were brought
[19:15.040 --> 19:19.320]  into this thing 20 something years ago and never got a vote it's taken close to
[19:19.320 --> 19:25.200]  30 years just to get to the point where England is going to get in the UK a vote
[19:25.200 --> 19:29.400]  on whether to stay in the EU or not they never voted to get in it that's what
[19:29.400 --> 19:34.680]  this is they don't tell you it's a takeover it is a takeover of free speech
[19:34.680 --> 19:40.640]  of our guns of our borders and just flood the country with third world labor
[19:40.640 --> 19:46.760]  and drive everything down raise the taxes when the ultra rich are exempt it
[19:46.760 --> 19:53.200]  is a hellish race to the bottom this elite are the same people arming ISIS
[19:53.200 --> 19:57.560]  to run around killing Christians I mean they are ultimate villains beyond any
[19:57.560 --> 20:03.280]  movie you'll ever see it's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with
[20:03.280 --> 20:08.280]  the industry leader my patriot supply once you try them you'll know why so
[20:08.280 --> 20:11.840]  many Americans like you have made them part of their emergency preparedness

[24:15.840 --> 24:21.600]  why this is so important because it really shows ignorance 360 across the
[24:21.600 --> 24:24.680]  board I'm gonna give you my breakdown on it I'm gonna give you my take I'm gonna
[24:24.680 --> 24:29.680]  give you the facts the way it really is and what this is really all about but
[24:29.680 --> 24:34.480]  right now let's go back to the big issue at hand our country being conquered by a
[24:34.480 --> 24:41.240]  foreign secret conglomerate and it's hardly even a news item and they act
[24:41.240 --> 24:46.760]  like we're traitors because we don't want to go along with it absolutely
[24:46.760 --> 24:51.480]  incredible this is how countries die on the 21st century world government that
[24:51.480 --> 24:56.760]  the Pope just called for last week is upon us here it is well it's not just a
[24:56.760 --> 25:04.160]  trade agreement with one friend and ally South Korea it's 12 nations in the
[25:04.160 --> 25:09.320]  Pacific as soon as that is inked we've been told and brought forward for
[25:09.320 --> 25:13.640]  passage in the Congress and historically if we give trade promotion
[25:13.640 --> 25:20.960]  authority the agreements have always passed that are presented once that one
[25:20.960 --> 25:27.560]  done we will have a transatlantic agreement and this transatlantic agreement
[25:27.560 --> 25:33.760]  I suppose also will have some sort of commission a transatlantic union with
[25:33.760 --> 25:39.080]  powers to discipline and set rules outside the powers of the United States
[25:39.080 --> 25:44.640]  Congress and then there's going to be a services agreement that's already been
[25:44.640 --> 25:49.720]  talked about it's been leaked somebody leaked it that are other two are secret
[25:49.720 --> 25:54.560]  and can't be seen by the American people some of my colleagues have been
[25:54.560 --> 25:59.520]  saying that the trade promotion authority that the president is so
[25:59.520 --> 26:04.920]  desperately seeking he's been hammering and bludgeoning his members in the
[26:04.920 --> 26:10.000]  Senate and the House to get them to not vote their conscience but vote with what
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.160]  he wants they say we should pass it because it restricts the power of the
[26:15.160 --> 26:22.480]  president well give me a break if this were true why would the president want
[26:22.480 --> 26:28.520]  it figure do all this he wants to do without Congress why are they doing it
[26:28.520 --> 26:33.400]  anyway it's secret the entire purpose of fast track is for Congress to
[26:33.400 --> 26:39.360]  surrender its power to the executive branch for six years legislative
[26:39.360 --> 26:43.680]  concessions include control over the content of the legislation the president
[26:43.680 --> 26:50.000]  negotiates it he brings it back we can amend it he controls the content of it
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.720]  possible the power to fully consider the lack of a five seconds and the power
[26:53.720 --> 26:57.280]  the globalists will amass through their puppet president that's why the
[26:57.280 --> 27:00.640]  Republicans are going along with it they want that power for four years
[27:00.640 --> 27:05.520]  Obama will just have it for two the power that will be amassed by that
[27:05.520 --> 27:11.880]  combine will be almost impossible to reverse I mean you already were run by
[27:11.880 --> 27:18.240]  globalist but this is the coup de grace the final blow this is the coup d'etat
[27:18.240 --> 27:24.760]  which is French for coup d'etat that's a joke let's go back to this just over the
[27:24.760 --> 27:30.080]  top information happening this is how republics die with a trade deal and a
[27:30.080 --> 27:35.520]  bunch of lawyers that's secret and then we get subsections of it and it's so
[27:35.520 --> 27:41.360]  draconian I can't believe they're doing this I mean they're bold but you got a
[27:41.360 --> 27:46.480]  bunch of folks worried about battle flags and Caitlyn Jenner and playing
[27:46.480 --> 27:50.240]  with their iPads all day we are a conquered people make no mistake we're
[27:50.240 --> 27:54.440]  already conquered that's something like this could even be attempted this is
[27:54.440 --> 27:59.960]  gang raping the country by cold-blooded globalist that all over the third world
[27:59.960 --> 28:05.800]  they'll just come in under deals take over a river a water supply a reservoir
[28:05.800 --> 28:10.160]  and they'll quadruple prices overnight and let all the crops die and just
[28:10.160 --> 28:15.680]  bankrupt everything for five ten years and come in and take it over famous
[28:15.680 --> 28:19.000]  cases of that all over the world I mean you want to be brutalized by globalists
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.120]  while they fly around above you and jets and helicopters laughing at you because
[28:23.120 --> 28:26.720]  they love you so much they love you that you know because they want to give you a
[28:26.720 --> 28:32.120]  sex change they just sit back laughing at all this you're all done all of you

[29:05.040 --> 29:09.200]  break with sessions and we'll come back over the content of the legislation the
[29:09.200 --> 29:14.400]  president negotiates it he brings it back we can't amend it he controls the
[29:14.400 --> 29:20.360]  content of it the power to fully consider the legislation on the floor it's
[29:20.360 --> 29:26.120]  filed on one day voted the next day to keep debate open and the polish is just
[29:26.120 --> 29:29.120]  we're gonna come here isn't vote we're gonna come back and I'm gonna shut up

[34:10.560 --> 34:14.200]  Union by stealth and they are establishing the Pacific Union by stealth
[34:14.200 --> 34:20.000]  and already merging all three together once they merge the three they then

[37:10.040 --> 37:13.880]  downtown with blue non-threatening walls and they have their doors open and
[37:13.880 --> 37:18.400]  haven't had free cupcakes and couches and look we're non-threatening and all
[37:18.400 --> 37:22.520]  these unpaid interns who are going to be stars and the police chief and the mayor
[37:22.520 --> 37:27.680]  come in the police chief rides around the driverless car and it's all fun and
[37:27.680 --> 37:34.760]  as humans are phased out Google secretly testing self-driving cars in Texas
[37:34.760 --> 37:39.120]  multiple sightings confirm autonomous vehicle being used on public roadways
[37:39.120 --> 37:45.200]  and this is how conditioned I've gotten I walked out in the parking lot about
[37:45.200 --> 37:49.240]  three weeks ago and one drove white right by and I went oh there's one of those
[37:49.240 --> 37:52.400]  Google cars that's been caught stealing passwords and jacking in everybody's
[37:52.400 --> 37:55.840]  computers and I went wait a minute there's nobody in it as it turned the
[37:55.840 --> 38:01.400]  corner and I looked for my keys in my pocket but I'd gone out there to sign
[38:01.400 --> 38:05.560]  a delivery I'd gone out the back to talk to some folks and I didn't have my keys
[38:05.560 --> 38:10.880]  and then some of the other crew told me they saw it again so we've got imperial
[38:10.880 --> 38:15.360]  probe droids they're already in most states driving around already without
[38:15.360 --> 38:20.280]  people in them and the Don Salazar got the documents it's up on info wars.com
[38:20.280 --> 38:29.640]  and no one was told about it see but don't worry the mayor and police chief
[38:29.640 --> 38:35.040]  were told and text dots running and it's a dream because they're gonna tax you
[38:35.040 --> 38:41.280]  by the mile well you know self-driving cars are safer you know sorry you got to
[38:41.280 --> 38:46.020]  pay more insurance to be human driver and already they're phasing us in they're
[38:46.020 --> 38:50.040]  already phasing us in where our cars are already basically self-driving but
[38:50.040 --> 38:55.880]  but but it's something fancy you pay extra for oh I get to thumb print with
[38:55.880 --> 39:00.520]  the Mercedes to get in it oh oh the car someone send the brakes on the car saw
[39:00.520 --> 39:05.160]  it didn't it break for me oh it told me and it all sounds great but studies are
[39:05.160 --> 39:08.080]  already out showing just a few years into this it's already making us where
[39:08.080 --> 39:11.840]  we're not good drivers we don't know how to back up we don't know how to look
[39:11.840 --> 39:17.040]  both ways we're reliant and they came out this week or Friday and announced yes
[39:17.040 --> 39:21.040]  we're programming the co the self-driving cars the future to kill you if it's
[39:21.040 --> 39:25.200]  gonna save someone else it'll decide and the Watson computer will decide who
[39:25.200 --> 39:28.520]  doesn't get treatment and dies that was illegal just a few years ago but now
[39:28.520 --> 39:33.040]  it's okay because the computer decides not just the bioethics board and the
[39:33.040 --> 39:37.200]  bioethics board sit back and say well we can't get in trouble now and we turn
[39:37.200 --> 39:40.880]  grandma off and don't give her water when she's begging for it or don't give a
[39:40.880 --> 39:47.800]  veteran health care because the computer said so see but it's programmed by the
[39:47.800 --> 39:51.840]  globalist and then they got the New York Times endorsing the zeitgeist
[39:51.840 --> 39:56.880]  movement and you know fresco and all these socialists and communists who
[39:56.880 --> 40:00.960]  call themselves futurists who are all living sports stadiums plastic sports
[40:00.960 --> 40:04.920]  stadiums there'll be no more money and the robots will assign us our work it's a
[40:04.920 --> 40:13.000]  utopia no it's a hellhole the end of free will hope it's an underground
[40:13.000 --> 40:17.280]  movement endorsed by the New York Times of the UN isn't it cute and trendy sit
[40:17.280 --> 40:23.240]  around in black suits and and talk with simpering voices about re-educating
[40:23.240 --> 40:29.480]  Alex Jones and how cute it is and they have an arrogance towards the dumb down
[40:29.480 --> 40:33.160]  public when I come out and say how dare you live on air say I'll have to be
[40:33.160 --> 40:39.240]  re-educated they go we never said that apologize when it's on audio you will be
[40:39.240 --> 40:43.600]  re-educated you will be re-educated well that's a horrible authoritarian statement
[40:43.600 --> 40:49.360]  I never said that I control reality you don't obama cares free I mean this is
[40:49.360 --> 40:55.280]  how these people operate and they're just ushering in a hell that is the end of
[40:55.280 --> 40:59.760]  them as well but they like to make believe they're part of the power
[40:59.760 --> 41:08.200]  structure so let's go back to senator sessions and the move to ram through TPP
[41:08.200 --> 41:15.640]  tomorrow call the Senate call their local offices physically go into their local
[41:15.640 --> 41:21.920]  offices physically call in to talk radio in your area and say hey cover this as
[41:21.920 --> 41:25.840]  while we're busy talking about Charleston which is very suspect and while
[41:25.840 --> 41:30.040]  we're busy focusing on all this other stuff with their moving NATO arms in to
[41:30.040 --> 41:35.000]  fight the Russians unprecedented escalation Europe is melting down
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.360]  financially we're going under world government the Pope's calling for it I
[41:39.360 --> 41:44.840]  mean this is crazy and by the way this is a normal response to get upset to all
[41:44.840 --> 41:50.520]  this let's go back to senator sessions so the legislation on the floor it's
[41:50.520 --> 41:55.440]  filed on one day voted the next day the power to keep debate open until
[41:55.440 --> 42:00.240]  Senate cloture is invoked on any other legislation you have to get cloture
[42:00.240 --> 42:06.520]  vote so together on TPP TTIP and TISA these three trade agreements that we
[42:06.520 --> 42:12.040]  know are going to be advanced on the fast track represent the goal of
[42:12.040 --> 42:19.240]  advancing the unrestricted global movement of goods and people and services
[42:19.240 --> 42:24.360]  stop again there's no way I can't interrupt this because everything he
[42:24.360 --> 42:31.200]  says is so key just as you kept the fastest growing libertarian patriot
[42:31.200 --> 42:34.480]  party in the EU you say well why don't they just vote themselves out of
[42:34.480 --> 42:41.200]  existence because they are ceremonial and can only pass things that are in
[42:41.200 --> 42:47.920]  accordance with the EU charter and the bureaucracy it's now over 90% of UK laws
[42:47.920 --> 42:53.720]  are set by it and then you find out the EU bureaucrats made themselves tax
[42:53.720 --> 43:03.040]  exempt the new royalty in fact it's on my phone I sent it to Beggs last night we
[43:03.040 --> 43:12.080]  were texting he got back from his work vacation in Hawaii visiting friends and I
[43:12.080 --> 43:22.400]  sent Beggs this photo of the king of Kuwait with the Duke of Edinburgh
[43:22.400 --> 43:27.320]  Prince Philip and the Queen of England absolutely sickening of them and their
[43:27.320 --> 43:33.840]  top hats holding his hand I wanted to tweet this out and say this is why we're
[43:33.840 --> 43:37.720]  in so much trouble this is the exact same thing as North Korea but we've learned
[43:37.720 --> 43:42.400]  about on to it because of red carpets and trumpets being blown it's a sick
[43:42.400 --> 43:46.720]  joke here here's my phone guys I want buckly to get that off and tweet it out
[43:46.720 --> 43:51.680]  I can tweet it but I'm busy talking I keep forgetting to do it I mean that is
[43:51.680 --> 43:54.280]  that is everything wrong with the world right there and I mean it is an
[43:54.280 --> 43:58.760]  anachronism of them dressed up in the in their suits their their their their
[43:58.760 --> 44:05.640]  19th century 18th century top hats with another guy in a clown outfit and you
[44:05.640 --> 44:08.840]  won't hear a word out of the feminist you won't hear a word out of the
[44:08.840 --> 44:12.160]  establishment about getting rid of royalty getting rid of the Saudi
[44:12.160 --> 44:16.520]  princes you know where they kill women for no reason you'll only hear about
[44:16.520 --> 44:22.280]  Western men being bad all day because Western men are virtuous and good and
[44:22.280 --> 44:26.840]  helped build the basic freedoms we have worldwide and brought you the printing
[44:26.840 --> 44:32.720]  press and the Renaissance and Newtonian physics and everything else it must be
[44:32.720 --> 44:38.800]  destroyed because it's virtuous it's the highest standard so it's got to be
[44:38.800 --> 44:43.280]  pulled down in every form of squalor and evil and patheticness that we fought
[44:43.280 --> 44:48.440]  and our ancestors fought has to be pulled down and erect because it can't
[44:48.440 --> 44:52.760]  exist freedom can't exist because people will lust after it it has to be
[44:52.760 --> 44:57.640]  removed from the world while we all sit poor squalor all the elites that they're
[44:57.640 --> 45:02.880]  in top hats in giant armored palaces with troops guarding them and then
[45:02.880 --> 45:08.280]  they're outgoing the Paul socialism is the answer male supremacy is evil I am
[45:08.280 --> 45:16.320]  the queen oh prince boo boo I mean it is such as fraud let's go back to the clip
[45:16.320 --> 45:22.000]  of sessions warning of the imminent takeover of this country the European
[45:22.000 --> 45:29.600]  Commission this is how they started how they were formed explains so the
[45:29.600 --> 45:36.080]  European Commission has is explaining now Tisa the second I presumably the
[45:36.080 --> 45:41.360]  second major trade agreement that would be submitted after the Pacific
[45:41.360 --> 45:46.280]  agreement yeah and we move to the Pacific use the boss European realm it's the
[45:46.280 --> 45:52.440]  command base this is how they explain what it means quote Tisa is open to all
[45:52.440 --> 45:57.920]  WTO members World Trade Organization members who want to open up trade in
[45:57.920 --> 46:04.160]  services China and Uruguay have asked to join the talks the EU supports their
[46:04.160 --> 46:09.000]  applications Tisa of course is the services agreement and apparently it'll
[46:09.000 --> 46:16.520]  be worldwide anybody even China he runs it could be in the European Union
[46:16.520 --> 46:23.400]  Commission specifies that this services agreement Tisa will be modeled on the
[46:23.400 --> 46:30.080]  general agreement on trade in services gets and this provide insights into how
[46:30.080 --> 46:35.720]  Tisa will affect US immigration procedure when the United States became a
[46:35.720 --> 46:42.800]  member of the WTO in 1994 it signed on to the GACs and committed to issue
[46:42.800 --> 46:50.400]  certain numbers of work visas each year immigration visas Congress's ability to
[46:50.400 --> 46:56.360]  control the United States temporary entry programs has therefore been curtailed
[46:56.360 --> 47:02.520]  as it would open up the United States to foreign lawsuits in an international
[47:02.520 --> 47:09.760]  tribunal in other words they made an agreement on immigration visas on the
[47:09.760 --> 47:19.120]  work ideas as part of GACs and the WTO and it violates and complicates our
[47:19.120 --> 47:26.000]  ability to enforce American immigration law what about this union what kind of
[47:26.000 --> 47:34.040]  powers is it talking about I'm of the belief since the present hasn't been a
[47:34.040 --> 47:39.080]  strong advocate of trade and his supporters many of them oppose this
[47:39.080 --> 47:46.040]  kind of trade agreement I'm becoming to believe that the primary part of his
[47:46.040 --> 47:52.880]  understanding of the importance of this legislation and why he's breaking arms
[47:52.880 --> 48:00.480]  and heads over it is the union this international commission that has powers
[48:00.480 --> 48:06.200]  that he believes will allow him to advance our agenda he will join it
[48:06.200 --> 48:12.440]  the trade deals back it up 20 seconds this is key sessions is so slick how he
[48:12.440 --> 48:18.200]  just lays it out calmly and nicely but very subtly and I'm not criticizing him
[48:18.200 --> 48:20.680]  because it's different strokes for different folks we people to hardcore
[48:20.680 --> 48:28.120]  blow the alarm the way this works is if you are a state politician you graduate
[48:28.120 --> 48:32.920]  to the regional union level when you sell out your constituents if you're a
[48:32.920 --> 48:40.000]  federal level you graduate directly from the regional to the global body and
[48:40.000 --> 48:46.760]  and you bet your bottom dollar Obama violated article one section nine that
[48:46.760 --> 48:53.080]  no member of the cabinet or the president will sit on a foreign legislative
[48:53.080 --> 49:01.040]  or governing body and he was the head for his round of the UN Security Council
[49:01.040 --> 49:05.600]  and that's why they had Henry Kissinger and all these other globalists they're
[49:05.600 --> 49:09.760]  sighing and and looking like they were having orgasms and I don't mean to use
[49:09.760 --> 49:13.240]  that just to be shocking we played the video of them at the UN of New York
[49:13.240 --> 49:20.240]  gasping and Kissinger going oh and then going this was our dream to do this I
[49:20.240 --> 49:26.440]  mean it was so illegal to have a president become the head of the UN
[49:26.440 --> 49:31.240]  jointly not the secretary general that's a puppet the head of the Security
[49:31.240 --> 49:37.600]  Council it's in my film fall the Republic it is overwhelming and in that film
[49:37.600 --> 49:46.120]  we talk about the TPP made six years ago go watch it it's free online only has
[49:46.120 --> 49:50.000]  like 10 million views between all the sites that have it very sad but now
[49:50.000 --> 49:56.320]  fifty-something million like Obama deception 14 million one view one channel
[49:56.840 --> 50:01.520]  buy it on DVD if you want it to support us in fallwarstore.com I'm skipping this
[50:01.520 --> 50:05.720]  network break stations shouldn't cover it up just our break love our stations
[50:05.720 --> 50:08.480]  I'm just pointing that out some stations I'm told my listeners still do it so
[50:08.480 --> 50:13.680]  people wonder why I'm talking and it just cuts off quite frankly I just can't
[50:13.680 --> 50:17.680]  go to break at times like this because it you know the stations will skip the
[50:17.680 --> 50:20.720]  news when there's a big terror attack or a mass shooting I mean I just like
[50:20.720 --> 50:25.360]  skipping the you know the breaks all the time because it's just so incredible
[50:25.360 --> 50:31.920]  this is the fall of our Republic we're witnessing and the president wants to go
[50:31.920 --> 50:39.520]  on to be like Barroso who sold out his country sold out Spain and Portugal he
[50:39.520 --> 50:44.880]  was involved in both going to had the EU Commission Obama wants to go on to head
[50:44.880 --> 50:49.480]  it and believe me Bill Clinton has said he wants to be the head of the UN I
[50:49.480 --> 50:54.560]  mean that's what this is all about Tony Blair said it and Tony Blair is a UN
[50:54.560 --> 51:01.960]  envoy to the Middle East that's all this is that they're selling us out so they
[51:01.960 --> 51:08.200]  can captain the new global government that's a giant screw job operation let's
[51:08.200 --> 51:15.600]  go ahead and go back to sessions is it that we're talking about I'm of the
[51:15.600 --> 51:20.640]  belief since the president hasn't been a strong advocate of trade and his
[51:20.640 --> 51:25.960]  supporters many of them oppose this kind of trade agreement I'm becoming to
[51:25.960 --> 51:33.480]  believe that the primary part of his understanding of the importance of this
[51:33.480 --> 51:41.320]  legislation and why he's breaking arms and heads over it is the union this
[51:41.320 --> 51:47.360]  international Commission that has powers that he believes will allow him to
[51:47.360 --> 51:52.640]  advance agendas so for too long the United States is in and in the trade deals
[51:52.640 --> 51:58.960]  on the promise of economic bounty only to see workers impoverished industries
[51:58.960 --> 52:05.000]  disappear manufacturing jobs decline and we've been on a steady decline in
[52:05.000 --> 52:10.680]  manufacturing jobs and that's just part of a 30-something minute speech we got
[52:10.680 --> 52:15.560]  some clips for you it's up on info wars.com and I suggest you get it out
[52:15.560 --> 52:20.360]  to everybody I mean has America just given up like people know they're being
[52:20.360 --> 52:25.520]  screwed over but they just think oh we can't stop this we've been stopping this
[52:25.520 --> 52:29.360]  they've been trying to pass this for about four years they cooked it up ten
[52:29.360 --> 52:35.360]  years ago you know they started the TPP merger it's called the Asian Pacific
[52:35.360 --> 52:39.880]  Union and then the agreement to bring you into it is the TPP and then it
[52:39.880 --> 52:44.400]  merges with the NAU and that's secret treaty from 2005 you know every time I
[52:44.400 --> 52:48.480]  mentioned that it was in the Dallas Morning News it was in the Waco paper and
[52:48.480 --> 52:51.760]  it was World Net Daily covered at Info Wars covered at Drudge covered at the
[52:51.760 --> 52:56.760]  time but 2005 Bush met in secret with the Sente Fox and Paul Martin the leaders
[52:56.760 --> 53:02.040]  of Canada and Mexico at Waco and they signed a secret treaty and it and it was
[53:02.040 --> 53:06.080]  in the news that well you can't see it and I cover that in my film Endgame and
[53:06.080 --> 53:08.760]  people would you'll call me and say come on you think they signed a secret
[53:08.760 --> 53:14.320]  treaty making an NAU just like this is secret so at least we've come a long
[53:14.320 --> 53:18.480]  way where folks at least know this is secret and they know it's going on I've
[53:18.480 --> 53:22.400]  had a deal of the uphill battle of folks just saying there is no global union
[53:22.400 --> 53:25.480]  there is no global government you know because now we've gone so far down the
[53:25.480 --> 53:29.440]  rat hole down the sewage pipe that the Pope's running around saying we need
[53:29.440 --> 53:33.720]  global government to enforce carbon taxes so at least we can have an open
[53:33.720 --> 53:39.200]  debate about this now the raping has gotten them so far down the line with
[53:39.200 --> 53:45.080]  the gang rape here that folks at least now know they've been been over a barrel
[53:45.080 --> 53:49.040]  and let me tell you when they get all this through Katie by the door they're
[53:49.040 --> 53:52.640]  gonna devalue the dollar and all the other major currencies we're gonna go
[53:52.640 --> 53:56.320]  overnight from rich to poor and it's gonna be a hellish police state with
[53:56.320 --> 54:00.760]  crime all over the place and that's why all the money is getting out of Israel
[54:00.760 --> 54:06.200]  and the United States Israel is set to go down and shows the United States and
[54:06.200 --> 54:10.200]  you may hate Israel a lot of you it's the cause celeb the sexy thing with the
[54:10.200 --> 54:15.680]  left and everybody else hey fine but just know when Israel's been basically
[54:15.680 --> 54:22.800]  quasi removed it'll still be there but it'll be a UN state the radical Muslims
[54:22.800 --> 54:25.200]  will still be running around cutting Christians heads off and everything else
[54:25.200 --> 54:30.280]  I want to get to this special report on the dangers of not having a cleansed
[54:30.280 --> 54:34.040]  gallbladder brought to you by info wars life calm we'll come back in the next
[54:34.040 --> 54:37.080]  hour that a lot of big guests coming up today I'll tell you about that after this
[54:37.080 --> 54:51.080]  video but this is brought to you by info wars life calm and when you eat all
[54:51.080 --> 54:58.000]  these toxins if you ate McDonald's nuggets 20 years ago that had plasticizers
[54:58.000 --> 55:02.600]  in them your gallbladder and your liver doesn't know what to do so the liver
[55:02.600 --> 55:07.520]  basically excretes that into the gallbladder and it holds it just Google
[55:07.520 --> 55:13.640]  gallbladder stones and it's disgusting but you need to look at it and when you
[55:13.640 --> 55:17.520]  finally get filled up with these it burst or it gets infected they've got to
[55:17.520 --> 55:22.360]  remove it and we'll scroll through these there's even grosser ones like let's
[55:22.360 --> 55:26.560]  scroll down on average they're green or black if they're black they're really
[55:26.560 --> 55:33.520]  old and toxic they're generally green and this stuff's meant to be passed out
[55:33.520 --> 55:39.040]  of you but we eat such artificial food that it doesn't these are way beyond
[55:39.040 --> 55:46.040]  kidney stones you name it you also have liver stones and medical doctors won't
[55:46.040 --> 55:50.120]  tell you on average hey flush your liver they'll just say hey your liver sick
[55:50.120 --> 55:53.560]  it's gonna be progressively worse we're gonna get you on a list for a liver
[55:53.560 --> 56:01.120]  transplant it is unbelievable we're showing these disgusting images so about
[56:01.120 --> 56:03.440]  a year and a half ago Anthony Gucci already just said man I just have a
[56:03.440 --> 56:08.440]  doctor ribs liver cleanse the one he recommends and he's developing this
[56:08.440 --> 56:14.000]  proprietary stuff he's testing on himself right now you really got to do it the
[56:14.000 --> 56:18.280]  results are dramatic after six days and I'm like no way no way I'm doing it I
[56:18.280 --> 56:21.960]  don't believe that there's giant black or green balls in my gallbladder and
[56:21.960 --> 56:26.680]  this out ignorant I am and he's like look at it online I'm not looking at it
[56:26.680 --> 56:31.800]  online it's not like that grosses me out I don't want to go there well finally
[56:31.800 --> 56:34.960]  about six months ago they convinced me to do it I personally think everybody
[56:34.960 --> 56:38.920]  should go through a liver cleansing if you haven't done one and then take the
[56:38.920 --> 56:42.120]  for example the liver shield can be taken two different ways it could be
[56:42.120 --> 56:46.600]  taken as a liver support formula where you just take a couple dropper foals but
[56:46.600 --> 56:51.480]  that's not going to purge the liver and remove all that stuff from it in order
[56:51.480 --> 56:55.200]  to do that you have to do the six day walk through how the liver works the
[56:55.200 --> 56:58.280]  different types of cleanses with you and give you the floor but I'm asking a lot
[56:58.280 --> 57:04.080]  of selfish questions here up front how does the apple cider vinegar organic
[57:04.080 --> 57:09.120]  with the oxy powder and with the liver trucks over to six day cleanse how does
[57:09.120 --> 57:12.960]  it then when you take the olive oil at the end lay on your side for an hour as
[57:12.960 --> 57:17.720]  you go to sleep why does it then have the gallbladder release well this is
[57:17.720 --> 57:22.680]  something that I that is a very controversial issue and but results
[57:22.680 --> 57:26.600]  speak for themselves I mean hundreds of thousands of people have done this and
[57:26.600 --> 57:30.720]  it dates back even a thousand years drinking oils to cleanse and purge the
[57:30.720 --> 57:35.840]  liver actually the Greeks and the over in India with Ayurvedic medicine have
[57:35.840 --> 57:40.000]  done it the same way but how it works is what you should do and this is what our
[57:40.000 --> 57:46.000]  proprietary research led us to do back starting in the early 90s when we were
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.920]  looking at the best ways to cleanse the liver was to develop an herbal formula
[57:50.920 --> 57:55.920]  that contains herbs that will help soften or break down these globules or
[57:55.920 --> 57:59.160]  these stones in the liver and the gallbladder and that's really what the
[57:59.160 --> 58:03.880]  first five days is for that's where you mix the bottle of liver shield you pour
[58:03.880 --> 58:07.720]  the whole bottle in a gallon of distilled water and then you drink four
[58:07.720 --> 58:13.200]  eight ounce glasses a day of that for five days at the same time though you're
[58:13.200 --> 58:17.560]  also using the apple cider vinegar and that's gonna be the the liver flush
[58:17.560 --> 58:23.680]  kit that we put together exclusively for info wars you know viewers and the

[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:06.960]  video that's where you mix the bottle of liver shield you pour the whole bottle
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.360]  in a gallon of distilled water and then you drink four eight ounce glasses a day
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:16.960]  of that four or five days at the same time though you're also using the apple
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.760]  cider vinegar and that's going to be the the liver flush kit that we put
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:26.520]  together exclusively for info wars you know viewers and the people that want to
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:32.040]  support the you know the info war so basically that you want you do that for
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.600]  five days and of course you want to eat fairly healthy you don't want to be
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:39.080]  putting a bunch of chemicals and toxins into your body but then on day five is
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:44.240]  when you actually do the olive oil and in when you you do epsom salts and the
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:51.120]  epsom salts that you drink will actually help relax the the bile duct and make it
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:57.000]  a lot more elastic so any of the stones can pass through there or the globules
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.160]  the toxic globules and then when you lay on your you drink the olive oil you lay
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:05.840]  on your right side where because your liver is on the right side and those
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.600]  or that heavy oil ends up absorbing down through your intestinal lining and
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.720]  going into the liver and it kind of works like oil pulling which is a big
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.200]  thing now that it was on Dr. Ross with the coconut oil where you swish it in
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.600]  your mouth and oil has an affinity for toxic substances and absorbs some of
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:29.240]  those and when you do the liver cleanse you will actually form also little oil
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:35.120]  globules as well so the reason why you take during the ox the flush the liver
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:39.480]  flush the reason why you take oxy powder at the same time is because you want to
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.760]  be able to flush that out of the system because when the liver dumps all those
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:47.560]  toxic balls and rocks and all that toxic buildup that's been in there for years
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:51.000]  and years and years you want to have something to flush it out of the
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:57.400]  intestines infowarslife.com you flush your carburetor got a flush your
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:04.640]  gallbladder former CNN host and gun control advocate Pierce Morgan has
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:10.120]  called for all white people who use the n-word to be thrown in jail the debate
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:15.080]  began yesterday shortly after president Barack Obama used the n-word during an
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:22.120]  interview about racism on the WTF with Mark Marin podcast racism racism we are
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:29.360]  not cured of clearly and it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:35.280]  public that's not the measure of whether racism still exists or not shortly
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:39.680]  after the interview the term n-word quickly began trending on Twitter which
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:44.080]  later resulted in Pierce Morgan's response to jail all white people who
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:49.040]  use the term so I guess since Pierce Morgan failed in his attempt to take
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:54.840]  away our second amendment now it looks like his eyes are on the first and you

[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:33.080]  today the Max Kaiser joins us on the economy just since I've had him on I've
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:38.040]  seen a whole bunch of Democratic Party and White House connected hit pieces for
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:42.240]  media matters you name it doing the old tried and trusted thing they would do
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:47.720]  back in the 1990s the Clinton Library of course was forced to release via
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:54.360]  four-year earlier this year to the Western Journalism Center thousands of
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:58.200]  pages of documents and in there we see the Clintons right when they were
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.360]  elected ordering the media in private meetings to call anyone that criticize
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:09.320]  them conspiracy theorist and how to attack them saying they make money off
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:14.280]  of their conspiracy theories and there are not one not two not three but many
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:18.760]  more than that I can't even count them all today articles about how I'm making
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:25.600]  all this money and we're seeing the direct Clinton talking points right
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:32.440]  there my gosh Alex brings in more than $10 million a year why you couldn't run
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:37.320]  this operation in New York City for $50 million a year and it's not bad if I
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:42.920]  make money but the main reason we run this is to stop the globalist to stop
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:48.640]  TPP to stop the open borders to stop the gun control the Clintons can raise
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.400]  hundreds of millions of dollars from third-world dictators giving money their
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:55.200]  foundation and ship weapons to them after they're paid off they can steal money
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:00.200]  from Haitian kids and that's okay because they're the Clintons but I try to
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:04.360]  raise enough money to pay for 50-plus employees to send them all over the
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.440]  world to pay for the servers the building the insurance the lawyers the
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:14.880]  loss all of it we are an incredibly moral organization but also capitalist
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:19.720]  though I got a little bit of money saved in case I get sued or case I get
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:25.200]  put in prison or killed or whatever for my family you bet I do but I'm not gonna
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:30.360]  be guilted into the idea that it's bad that we have a media organization but
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:34.480]  that's what the Clintons did and that's their talking point I'll be on national
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.880]  TV and they'll go yeah you just want to make money and I'm like well what do you
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:45.760]  do as Fox or CNN or MSNBC investigative report Nightline Jones building media
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:52.560]  Empire tiny compared to what they do and done selling good products directly to
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:57.280]  our audience high quality nutraceuticals high quality non-GMO seeds high
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:02.680]  quality Patriot apparel of course we are capitalist most revolutionaries rob
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:07.240]  banks and stagecoaches you know like some of the founders did and and Rob
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.160]  British ships to to fund the revolution that'd be moral quite frankly at this
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:16.960]  point but I'm not gonna do that so see the old revolutionaries could could
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:23.440]  could could you know rob a a British gold delivery and that's patriotic but
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:28.160]  I'm here selling high quality products competitively at info or store.com and
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:32.960]  Amazon.com and everybody else is allowed to sell stuff but me because the
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:39.360]  moral high authority says it's bad Brian Williams can get ten million dollar
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:48.040]  contract extension to a lot of the public but that's what he's paid not the
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:53.800]  money we've got to make to pay for the infrastructure I mean quite frankly I
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:59.600]  plow almost when they would attack me I'm going to Larry Nichols 15 16 17 years
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:06.040]  ago I only had four or five employees and when I was so neurotic and such a
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:12.560]  purist and actually listen their propaganda I would be in a working class
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:17.960]  neighborhood with a working class car and would put like 98% of the money in
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:22.160]  back into the operation because I wanted to fight the tyranny I didn't do it
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:25.840]  because I was guilted but but still it felt good because of how they were
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:29.400]  trying to guilt me to think well I really don't keep any money then I
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.040]  thought you know what I'm gonna hire a bunch of people I'm gonna really go for
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:35.560]  broke I'm gonna try to really change history it's my responsibility and you
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.960]  know what you don't like it I'm gonna get a decent car and I'm gonna live in a
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:42.680]  nice house for my kids and you know what you want to do the Democrats and
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:46.680]  others I'm gonna go ahead and expand and really be successful and get five times
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:51.360]  bigger how's that sound because I'm not going to sit here and watch you crooks
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:55.920]  that are selling our country out to the TPP and gutting our borders and and
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:00.480]  destroying our language and taking over and be guilted by you scum you are
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:09.040]  sick you are absolutely sick and they play these mind games Jones is scaring
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:16.600]  you about the TPP because he wants to make money what I was offered contracts
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:20.920]  to make way more money than I make now to sell out to the system I've been
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:26.760]  approached by the biggest networks there are out there and offered to be where
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:31.560]  Glenn Beck was before he even existed I was approached by three of the biggest
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:37.320]  networks and they told me though we're gonna control what you say we will add
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:42.280]  it's editorial control and basically final cut and I said I can't control what
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:46.800]  I say I just tell the truth well don't you want a five million dollar a year
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.680]  contract and that isn't five million dollars you got to pay all the bills and
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:55.080]  got to pay payroll and got to pay for the servers that's five million dollars in
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:00.840]  my pocket I'm so moral it's disgusting because I'm not gonna sell people out
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.160]  it's nothing special that I did that except in a nation of traders I guess
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:08.440]  it is I couldn't sleep at night if I did that and get up on the radio and lie to
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:13.080]  people and tell them there's no new world order and sit there and tell them
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:16.760]  there's no FEMA camps and sit there and tell them all this stuff and I mean I
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.480]  will not be part of it and the truth is I and you the audience and our guests
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:25.200]  were going to Larry Nichols have changed the destiny of things you listen to
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:30.160]  Rush Limbaugh Glenbeck Sean Hannity and all of them we forced them to admit
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:33.640]  global government and a corporate takeover we forced the whole thing out
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:39.160]  in the open and I'm so proud of that that's what I was after my goal they say
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:45.120]  fortune favors the bold that's the SAS slogan well my fortune's freedom for
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.120]  myself and my family and being an honorable person there's nothing wrong
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:52.360]  with being successful as long as you didn't screw somebody to do it in fact
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:57.840]  that's how you build an economy I'm proud of people that create an invention or
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:03.040]  build a company and or or or develop systems or write a book or play music
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.760]  and become wealthy they're the people that buy houses and buy cars and go to
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:11.560]  restaurants and get their hair done and send their kids to college you want
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:16.320]  wealthy people but it's the wealthiest royalty and globalist who are exempt

[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:56.520]  inside the deepest areas of the Arkansas power structure you don't get into
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:59.520]  the Arkansas power structure at least then without being part of the Dixie
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:04.600]  Mafia which I'd call quasi-criminal I mean the Dixie Mafia operates right
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:08.120]  here in Austin most of its legitimate now it's some of the biggest names in the
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:12.520]  city made their money in the Dixie Mafia shipping you know the liquor that was
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:17.040]  produced in Little Rock and Hot Springs all over the country Al Capone's main
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:22.120]  headquarters was there so it's really just part of American culture and I had
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:27.400]  family on my dad's side who were you know liquor runners in Texas that were in
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:30.280]  the Dixie Mafia but he was a high-level member of the Dixie Mafia
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:34.600]  Clinton comes out of the Dixie Mafia and the CIA Nichols also did special
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:38.400]  operations which is classified I know he can get into some of that and I've kind
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.680]  of been running over him here today because I got all mad by these news
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.360]  articles not really mad just just incensed and I wanted to just throw out
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:48.560]  that he was there and then made a break with the Clintons when they started
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:54.160]  getting into really nasty stuff like killing kids so kind of a real life
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:58.840]  Tony Montana joins us who wouldn't do the evil things and helped expose their
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:02.520]  whole agenda and warned that Hillary was coming and now he's here to try to
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:07.800]  expose the whole thing Larry Nichols Larry Nichols.com it's a third-party
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:12.120]  site but I guess he endorses it and he's gonna try to republish his book right
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:15.680]  now and he also gives out his home number and his address if you want to
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.280]  support him he lost everything by fighting these people now he's a great
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:24.040]  patriot and going up against the establishment right now is absolutely
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:29.720]  key so Larry Nichols thank you so much for coming on with us. Hey Alex thank you
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:36.040]  and by the way I loved what you were talking about at the beginning folks
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:42.480]  let me tell you I as you'll recall Alex with the Clinton Chronicles and the
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:47.200]  Circle Power they sold something like between all the L20 million and Jeremiah
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:53.400]  the M60 million huge huge numbers of those things and I in the interest of
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:57.680]  trying to make sure nobody could discredit me and say I was doing it for
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:03.240]  money never took one dime and they offered me big money but I wouldn't take it
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:10.080]  the sad thing was Alex I read all over the world that I was taking the money
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.280]  anyway I should have taken it because they said I wasn't I took the licks
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.360]  absolutely I think we should spend if I'm gonna skip this break to give you
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:22.120]  more time spend some time on who Larry Nichols is and how you got into the
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:26.200]  Clintons and what you did because you were one of the good guys on the inside
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.240]  that was the point I was trying to make was you don't even get into the power
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:35.240]  structure without being part of it well outside I just cannot say I was one of
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:38.720]  the good guys I was in the middle of it I did the nasty things I did the dirty
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:46.160]  things I'm it compared to them I'm it compared to them oh yeah yeah you had to
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:51.200]  go something where I was in there it was my job I was a handler for Bill Clinton
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:56.640]  and when they first started running for office I was the marketing man I guess
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:01.040]  you'd say for them it was my job to keep them out of trouble it was my job to
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:07.320]  know everything and to be in a position to fix it whatever it was I had to fix
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:14.720]  it by the way Alex today what they know you get a call from natural inquire and
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:21.400]  they said make for Nicholas so what do you know the chef that was killed or
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:28.600]  died you know the white-ass chef and I said buddy they're not even in the race
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:35.020]  good and these mysterious deaths start all over again and that's something Alex
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:39.000]  here they go again absolutely give me a favor talk talk talk right into your phone
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:46.320]  for me Larry oh I'm sorry and you want to talk folks about money and risk let me
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:51.680]  tell you what Alex Jones Rick let me tell you what anybody risk that comes out
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:56.480]  against these guys it's a good way to end up even though I don't say they kill
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:00.400]  people but the people that support them the people that make billions off of
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:05.920]  them they tend to business on their own and that was one of the things I learned
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:10.120]  and then all of a sudden how's that a place called the archetype of element
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:17.480]  financial authority and there Alex it was there that I discovered a hundred
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:26.360]  million a month coming into a place called Mina Arkansas to a man named Dan
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:33.840]  Lassiter and they were smuggling cocaine in and laundering the money from the
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:40.440]  agency I was working at now included in that cabal was Dan Lassiter bit friends
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:47.880]  best friend of his we went to jail Don Tyson Tyson food y'all remember him right
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.840]  and we have Alex remember when I came out telling about the chicken trucks all
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.680]  in cocaine yes you got threatened that's how he was able to leverage and take
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:04.200]  over the entire poultry market worldwide worldwide when Bill Clinton was elected
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:10.160]  president Alex Don Tyson and Tyson kicked in food was a little regional
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:17.280]  company and then boom then you got Ron Brown bless his heart he got involved
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:24.480]  with helping Tyson take over Alaskan fisheries he ends up dead and by the way
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:28.720]  even the Air Force coroner said he was shot in the head with a 45 that even
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:36.880]  came out on this I've got the x-ray I've got two well two makers came to see me
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:43.400]  and they were the ones that did the actual autopsy there was a sergeant Alex
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:47.160]  that was on that plane she was like a stewardess can't remember her name right
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:56.160]  now now when they got to the airplane boat she was sitting on a stump and she
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:03.640]  was folded over crying and the rescue people came to her she walked to the
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:09.040]  helicopter and was taken back to the emergency room at the air base
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:15.640]  however when the helicopter landed at the air base there in Germany she was
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:25.360]  dead now oddly enough her brain stem was completely severed now Alex you know
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:32.040]  most of y'all know she could not have her brain stem severed and be sitting on
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:38.440]  the stump and walk to the elevator to the helicopter can't do it the brain
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:43.480]  stem being severed the military operation we grabbed changed the back
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:51.960]  bed and spin real fast so yeah you know this is gonna be a ride I never work
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:56.640]  to get Alex I think she was a two remember the gentleman that I had that

[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:19.640]  cut his hands cut his feet off cut his head off down to the brain stem set
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:24.880]  himself in fire with gasoline and put himself in the dump and the state
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:32.040]  medical examiner ruled it a suicide didn't he sure it is that's what I
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.680]  told that reporters and inquiry said I never heard that I said yeah well you

[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:02.120]  drugs are coming back in now so I'm doing this work at the same time I'm a
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:09.360]  handler for Bill and Hillary it was just the way the industry was in that day so
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:13.640]  I would go get involved with the conquerors come back and while I was
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:18.440]  back coming off I'd be with Bill Bill like to hear all the war stories some
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:24.760]  of which I made up but he liked to hear them I just drove him crazy and I became
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:30.920]  more and more involved and then Hillary hated and she hated Dick Moore she
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:39.920]  hated me more and Hillary folks in that day I don't know who today she said me
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:47.480]  now I'm really in that day she was ACDC it was hard enough to cover up for the
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:54.600]  affairs of Bill but it was extremely difficult to cover up for Hillary in her
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:01.320]  lesbian affairs and it was tough and she was tough she's a butch and queer
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:08.560]  affairs lesbian affairs she's the male dominant and buddy she is dominant and
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:16.160]  Bill Clinton said time and time again he had had more women or she had had more
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:22.000]  women than he had and Alex will remember the time just tell you what kind of
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.240]  woman this was Hillary Clinton two secret service agents in the White House
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:30.480]  started all this racket up to the living quarters they go up there's stuff
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:34.160]  breaking they don't know whether to go in because you're not supposed to but
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:40.560]  things were breaking they barged in and there it was still reached in bed with
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:46.680]  Markey poached you know my court that bond they read that together and they'll
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:49.800]  pull up the chair and wanted to watch and Hillary was throwing a strange
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:58.200]  lamp set that's the sick old people we call the Clintons it's actually quite
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:02.480]  interesting well remember the FBI agent that was in the White House that even
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:06.880]  took exposed that they had crack pipes and Mao Zedong ornaments on the
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:11.280]  Christmas tree and again it just shows who goes to the trouble to desecrate a
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:17.440]  Christmas tree it just shows they're deviant yeah and look guys I'm not here
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:23.320]  to smear them what I'm here to do is give you a character profile of these
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:29.280]  people because it's up to us you know Alex it's up to your audience three four
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:33.840]  million people that's how many you got cuz I'm in there talk to all of them you
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.920]  got three four million people that's the only we gotta stop them with and you
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:43.760]  gotta know who they are well you know it's one thing of Hillary's in bed with
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:47.920]  a bunch of women you know obviously that's all come out now you were the
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:51.760]  first to talk about it but Clinton settled the lawsuits where he rapes the
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:59.560]  women and he brutally does it that's right Bill Clinton is a sexual deviant
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:07.480]  folks sexual beaded he's not just a good old boy chasing women no he's sick he is
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:13.480]  sick and I hate to tell you all that Hillary is sick and the only thing I
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:20.560]  can tell most of you at this point I'm glad she did what she did in the
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:25.280]  Benghazi here and when she said what difference doesn't make their day the
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.840]  job's all what Hillary was that's Hillary and I'll tell you most of you
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:35.480]  don't remember the endless hearing after hearing after hearing when Hillary
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:43.600]  said I can't recall I don't remember she would remember Alex you'd remember
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:50.120]  everything to the end dictate and then we get to this one-minute segment that
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:55.560]  might be incriminating and she didn't remember and people didn't know what was
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:03.840]  going on well we trained them to know in a court of law folks if you say yes or
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:12.960]  no you can be proven commit a lie perjury if you say you don't know nobody
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:17.680]  on earth can prove what you can or can't remember in fact and that's what we
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:23.640]  trained Hillary to do that's what she did and she walked in those hearings and
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:30.640]  by the way folks in case you don't know Hillary was so mean and so dishonest so
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:38.520]  deceitful that she worked on the prosecution game after Richard Nixon
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:44.920]  but they kicked her off because she was so unprofessional that's right Larry

[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:50.240]  Larry Nichols the consummate insider to help get the Clintons wind up for the
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:53.920]  power structure of Arkansas which Arkansas more than any state is run by
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:59.360]  the Dixie Mafia major newspapers TV everything either part of that inside
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:03.560]  group or you don't operate in business basically that's why they love the
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:08.320]  Clintons because you either love the mafia don or you're done you've got who
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:13.000]  Clinton's mother was lady of the night all of it notice she died right when he
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.320]  started running for office or right when he's about to get elected like
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:22.080]  Obama's grandma all the rest of them and these are ruthless people that will do
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:27.280]  anything for power and they get off on it and that's why they want full control
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:30.320]  I'm gonna go inside their psychology I forgot to tell Larry he's doing a great
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:33.280]  job at his phones lower than it was last time to try to really get in on that
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:39.240]  Mike and to understand their psychology it's not fun to go up against these
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:44.800]  people but we're going to lose everything if we don't the Republicans are
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:48.520]  voting with the Democrats tomorrow to pass TPP that makes the president a
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:52.480]  dictator and brings us into the world government the Pope called for world
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:57.400]  government last week the Clintons are just really nasty characters in all
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:03.320]  this that know where the bodies are buried for the larger global mafia and
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:09.440]  they will do anything they're told but if I was the elite I wouldn't even put
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:13.320]  them in there as bad as the elite are because they'll double cross them I mean
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:16.040]  they are dangerous from what I know we'll see if Larry Nichols disagrees with
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:19.640]  that Larry didn't ask me to do this he's trying to get his book republished it
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:24.840]  was a bestseller he's working on some other things you know he is risking his
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:29.440]  life doing this and if folks want to support him or folks want to write him
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:32.720]  a letter or folks want to work with him he's trying to organize people to get
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:37.440]  him you know on more shows to expose the Clintons you can write to Larry Nichols
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:46.080]  58 Kingston Drive Conway Arkansas 72034 Larry Nichols 58 Kensington Drive
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:52.320]  Conway Arkansas 72034 Larry Nichols comms the third-party site but he
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:57.480]  endorses it for what last time I heard we can ask him on air but you need to
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:03.360]  understand folks that we're a platform for all these other activists and
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:07.960]  patriots and people that are under attack as well I don't want to mess with
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:13.160]  the Clintons when they were in I was called in I was told don't talk about
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:17.520]  Waco don't talk about the Clintons don't talk about all this stuff or you're
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:22.720]  gonna be fired off I had the number one talk show in town at 24 but on the air
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:27.280]  three years by then I already started a little syndicated show out of my house
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:34.440]  thank God and they fired me then they physically attacked me they didn't say
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:37.360]  this is a message from the Clintons they said quit talking about Waco quit
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:41.460]  messing with that you know judge I was having demonstrations they have the
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:46.320]  Klan come out against me this is all on video and they really run a lot of
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:51.840]  underground stuff because you're dealing with the Dixie Mafia interface with
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:58.040]  these globalist I mean it is truly a sickening symbiosis and I want to get
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:01.760]  Larry Nichols take on what Hillary will do when she gets in because if you think
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:07.800]  Obama's been bad he's been quasi run by the Clintons Katie bar the door they
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:13.160]  like to crush good people they like to go after folks that stood up against them
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:19.280]  they are truly wicked people and remember Hillary laughing about Gaddafi
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:25.040]  destabilizing Africa putting al Qaeda in charge I came we saw we killed him so
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:29.280]  we'll talk to Larry Nichols here in a moment I would appreciate it folks would
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.120]  pray for this broadcast pray for our affiliates support our local sponsors
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:38.280]  become a local sponsor put a billboard up for info wars.com if you've got the
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:42.400]  money this is the time when if good men and women take action in little ways and
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:47.800]  big ways and medium-sized ways they may even get into power and it may be the
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:50.920]  beginning of the end of these people because Obama already worked the country
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:54.760]  I've imagined Hillary but they are incredibly arrogant but the good news
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:38:00.240]  is we've had the CIA whistleblowers on famous ones Tosh Plumlee who want to get
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:07.800]  back on and many others and the military Colonel Shaffer Admiral Moore former
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:13.240]  chairman of the Joint Chiefs countless others Benton K. Parton the list goes on
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:19.480]  and on who have woken up the military so the good news is the military is one of
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:23.840]  the most awaited groups and they're beginning to understand what's
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.600]  happening a lot of local police are as well it's why they want to federalize
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:31.120]  things this is very serious but it's very important to also go to info wars

[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:54.320]  beyond that talk about what they'll do if they get full control this is clearly
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:57.440]  their end game they want to graduate to the world government level Bill Clinton
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:04.480]  has said that Obama has said that and then getting into why do you expose them
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:07.280]  when you could have just stayed in with them when was the moment when you'd
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:11.200]  already done all this dirty stuff that you had that come to Jesus moment that
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:16.000]  Saul of Tarsus moment on the road to Damascus because I know I'm risking my
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.880]  life I mean it's there's a level in me that says don't do this that I have to
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:24.400]  get past every time especially when they're getting ready to run for office
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:30.880]  and they're heating up that says listen you know you got the sort of Damocles
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:35.640]  there but I it's in my gut I can't go on living if I don't fight them I can't
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:39.360]  sell out to fear plus they're gonna take over everything and destroy our
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:45.920]  country we've somebody's got to say no I mean I think it comes down to that why
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:54.120]  do you fight them Larry Nichols and I was marketing director and handling
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:41:00.200]  everything and I found out that cocaine was being shipped into Mina and it was
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:05.480]  being laundered by the state group that I was covering up for and I realized
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:10.480]  Alex said if my daughter got hooked on cocaine she and Chelsea are the same age
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:16.040]  played together if she got hooked on cocaine I couldn't live with myself and
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:21.480]  we found out my dad was dying of lung cancer something I'm doing now myself
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:28.000]  but at that time to be honest Alex I couldn't live with my father the salt of
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.880]  the earth nor his son was as terrible as I was and I just made my decision I
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:37.640]  reached out touch touch the floor I was sitting in a chair and I touched the floor
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:44.680]  with my fist and I said God I'm at the bottom ain't nothing but up from here and
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:49.680]  I got after it now I didn't intend for it to be quite the marathon that it
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:55.760]  became I didn't intend to be in every newspaper TV magazine article in the
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:59.920]  free world I didn't intend for all that but that's where it ended up and we're
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:07.800]  not done yet Alex the reason all of you must fight all of you you gotta come to
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:14.360]  the terms Alex did folks they're gonna take it they're gonna take it you're
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:21.360]  gonna fight them at some point you're either gonna be in submission and it's
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:25.800]  gonna be too late to fight that's it I just can't submit and be bound I just my
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:30.120]  instinct is I got to fight them well that's where you are now and folks
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:39.480]  listen to me please you can get hold of me through an email at Nichols live at
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:48.000]  AOL.com thanks to you Alex the gentleman Ken Cartier, Ken Cartier said he had
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.840]  helped me and make sure he answered all the emails and got them to me fantastic
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:58.240]  never had that before and then we're redoing the genies have the bottle why
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:02.360]  do the genies have the bottle folks because it I wrote it to take it
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:09.200]  exactly what they would do how they do it why they do it and you'll know ahead
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:14.440]  of time and that's how we grow your audience Alex you know when I'm in
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:20.040]  telling all these people and I guarantee it's been a lot I've been telling
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:26.360]  people gosh guys we've got to spread the word in the biggest mistake Alex we as
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:31.400]  conservatives that have seen the life mate if somebody says well hey what do
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:35.400]  you think about that Hillary and then Alex we just OD and tell them everything
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:40.200]  we know and I'm split second or I start rolling back in your head and calling
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:47.080]  those conspiracy nuts I am going to tell you remember Alex what we did before the
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:53.880]  scandal a week we're going to tell you every week one thing that you're going
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:59.160]  to tell people that ask you and then you're going to prove it that week and
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:04.680]  you're going to say whoa how did you know that and Alex I gave my phone
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:10.480]  number four four oh eight nine seven oh six one one and everybody said good
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:14.840]  God you put your number out you know when Alex Jones is program that's risky
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:22.760]  you don't get a lot of calls but okay Alex your audience was reverent they were
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:29.480]  not abusive respectful it's an honor oh it's an honor to have this audience it's
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:34.880]  it's because I get pretty obnoxious and they're really amazing people let me
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:40.400]  ask you this question because I know that moment many times when it'll be like
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:43.400]  two three in the morning because I'm not afraid right now but sometimes I wake
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:46.560]  up in the middle of the night and I go look at my children in the moonlight and
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:51.440]  I just think my god how to ever get into all this this is so dangerous this is so
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:55.280]  real we know how real it is when we get the death threats the attacks we see it
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:02.000]  and it's that exact thing I'll just get down on my knees and realize that if I
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.600]  give into these people and if I back off and if I ever even take one move
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:11.240]  towards not going all the way it's a sellout and my soul's on the line I
[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:16.440]  realize that but what about the general public that's in a malaise and never had
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:20.360]  that decision come to them in their heart where where where you're you're
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:24.680]  convicted by God that's what it is or conscious whatever atheists want to call
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:29.120]  it you're convicted by it and then you got to make the decision a lot of people
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:32.680]  I know have never had that conviction and I think the most important is we need
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:37.280]  to convict America's heart to realize folks you think stuff's bad now look at
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:42.680]  how it's all speeding up I mean we are in deep you know what we are in it and
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:46.760]  it's I mean how bad's it gonna get Larry in your gut know everything you know
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:50.880]  how bad is it gonna get of these people get full power again because I could
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:53.920]  just see on their faces they're going for broke hell they'll probably start
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:58.040]  nuclear war with the Russians they're crazy they're crazy I'll take exactly
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:04.560]  how it's gonna be 2016 if we don't get together if we don't draw people to this
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:08.880]  program and grow an audience and about audience I mean an audience another
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:15.200]  shows to put it in your book put it in the book 2016 to be the last damn
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:21.520]  election this country ever had now there'll be election like you but I don't
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:31.600]  say that Russia but there won't be any elections after 2016 and I can prove it
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:38.320]  and I will prove it we'll prove it Alex we'll prove the folks I'm telling you
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:44.440]  Hillary is about power do you understand you know now all of you have
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:49.480]  to spend money they got through that foundation why would somebody Alex 70
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:55.720]  years old with all that money why wouldn't they just go out to pasture
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:05.920]  power dictatorial power are you still there yes I am I'm just saying I'm
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:09.560]  telling you it's power and the Clinton's are getting worse aren't they I mean they
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:17.200]  seem to get more evil as time goes on for yourself think about it don't you
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:22.600]  know they need that job the president like they need to hold me in they're
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:28.440]  missing something folks this isn't this is a dynamic duo had I not have lived
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:36.560]  with him lived in the house with him had I not have been there and seen it you
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:42.640]  don't realize these people aren't Mr. and Miss America this is the most
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:50.560]  dysfunctional couple you've ever ever ever met number one Chelsea that's a
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:58.120]  heart to Bill's credit Chelsea's not Bill's kid that's web Hubble's kid and
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:05.480]  I proved it now there's credit he raised her treated her like a father
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:10.120]  Hillary be gone you're into that don't you Alex we've talked to Larry Patterson
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:14.240]  Roger parents state police security guard she'd be on six weeks on the road
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:20.240]  come back and pat her on the head like a dog you never say anything to her these
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:28.560]  people these people won't your soul I know it sounds crazy y'all I know it
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:36.080]  does but you what do I have to do what if I got to give up I had given up our
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:43.960]  home I had given up everything my family has ever had and you tell me for
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:49.840]  what they'll what they'll die get out of it huh why does a man do that why does a
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:53.840]  man look at his family at night it can't keep the tears back because I've
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:58.520]  destroyed it why does a man do that
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:01.960]  you know money there
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:06.240]  well it's because you know that you can't join with the evil and we how do
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:10.360]  we get America in the world to force them to make the choice the Bible says
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:14.520]  you were lukewarm I spit you out of my mouth America is lukewarm it's why
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:20.520]  either join with the evil or don't all right that's that's where it is it's an
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:26.800]  either or we're in the ultimate either or game if so then so because of Alex I
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:32.400]  have this lady that's going to reprint the genius out of the box it's be done
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:40.840]  in a month now you can go get this folks you can go to listen up audio books
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:49.400]  calm and get your list name on the list and Alex this book is about how they do
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:56.560]  what they do and you have to know they're going to do exactly what I tell
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:01.440]  them to do it's the Clinton it's the Clinton playbook it's the playbook
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:06.840]  anything and what frustrates them I don't know if you remember it but a couple
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:12.880]  weeks ago that ABC guy called the guy they be shocked in his name on fair you
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:16.560]  know went to this gathering there's been plenty so what do you think Hillary's
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:21.440]  problem to be that it on who do you think the top three people you know
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:25.400]  Hillary will have to worry about me said Larry Nichols Larry Nichols Larry
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:30.160]  Nichols and not in that order I saw that on the New York Times is attacking you
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:34.720]  for folks that don't know who you are most do why I'm I know they've shot at
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:38.240]  you threaten you done a lot of stuff to you when we come back we know they want
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:40.800]  to get you they could I wonder why I'm so alive while you're so live it's
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:44.680]  probably God plus they don't want to make us martyrs but some of their idiot
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:48.960]  supporters might come after us but that'll probably blow up in their face
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:53.760]  now the answer is what Jim Garrison said stay in the light stay in the light

[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:02.960]  mobs only Italians right that's what I heard on TV because the media doesn't
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:08.520]  stereotype things this is mind control I'll get into the whole battle flag of
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:13.360]  northern Virginia it's not the Confederate flag it's known by that I'm gonna
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:15.960]  break down what's behind that because if they can ban that they can ban
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:19.960]  everything folks it's about getting rid of language I don't have a dog in the
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:23.720]  fight here at the point is that's what it's about one raise it races crazy

[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:30.240]  audience been on for 20 years we reach over 18 million people a week conservatively
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:33.760]  we count YouTube on other platforms that's who we touch with the videos the
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:38.160]  radio show the TV show everything it's a very scary number and I'm not here
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:41.240]  bragging about the show I'm just saying what Larry Nichols is saying is true now
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:46.400]  it's much more dangerous what I do than it's ever been and in the still of the
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:51.680]  night and that quiet place the most time a lot of you know atheists ask me I see
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:54.560]  the emails the comments remember sick of hearing about God you know we want the
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:58.760]  info or libertarians or whatever but please shut up about it hey listen all
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:03.720]  the psychological blanket or whatever when you have responsibility in children
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:07.480]  and when you're messing with killers and you're messing with people that are
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:13.040]  taken over I couldn't do this without my relationship with God okay because I
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:17.240]  fear God doing the wrong thing like Larry Nichols feared making his daddy feel
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:22.640]  bad that's an extension an example of that he didn't want to do that in front
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:28.760]  of God or his dad and to continue down the road because he had a conscience and
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:31.840]  we're dealing with people that don't have a conscience and when you fight these
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:35.640]  people all day long you realize when you don't have a conscience or you give
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:41.320]  yourself away you go to rock bottom of evil you become a demon and so we're
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:44.320]  fighting demons whether it's archetypal or whatever you want to call it we're
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:49.480]  fighting demons and the evil is growing no one can deny that and that's why I
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:53.680]  talk a lot about God because when it's in the still of the night and I wake up
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:59.000]  and my flesh says you got to stop doing this man you're in danger how like back
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:02.400]  when I used to drive a car 150 miles an hour and I and you know I said you know
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:05.120]  what I'm growing up I got you know my wife's pregnant I better stop driving
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:10.840]  fast it's the same thing it's a danger will Robinson you got to quit right now
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:19.400]  and it's the same thing but in my mind God touches me and says listen you think
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:21.120]  about all these innocent people they've killed what we're going to do to
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:24.440]  everybody you've got to stand against them and then I have comfort only got
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:27.360]  about three minutes left Larry Nichols closing comments and we'll get you back

[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:03.400]  again next Wednesday if you can do it former CNN host and gun control advocate
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:08.520]  Pierce Morgan has called for all white people who use the n-word to be thrown
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:13.720]  in jail the debate began yesterday shortly after President Barack Obama used
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:19.040]  the n-word during an interview about racism on the WTF with Mark Marin
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:27.200]  podcast racism racism we are not cured of clearly and it's not just a matter of
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:34.440]  it not being polite to say that's not the measure of whether racism still exists
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:38.880]  or not shortly after the interview the term n-word quickly began trending on
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:43.360]  Twitter which later resulted in Pierce Morgan's response to jail all white
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:48.760]  people who use the term so I guess since Pierce Morgan failed in his attempt to
[02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:54.680]  take away our second amendment now it looks like his eyes are on the first and

[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:19.920]  an extension of what began in the old one it is patterned itself after every
[02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:23.800]  dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of

[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:35.120]  and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:40.920]  every one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:51.880]  is an enemy and truth is a menace this is mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:56.640]  hours on earth he's a citizen of the state but will soon have to be eliminated

[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:03.040]  knowledge is power you know I don't want to have to take on Hillary Clinton her
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:07.240]  people were at Bilderberg she's the one Jeb Bush is the ringer I'd be against him
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:13.760]  as well but she's the one just like Obama was the one seven years ago they're
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:17.720]  dangerous they're they're the worst to go up against but you have to make a
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:24.400]  decision in life what you stand for and I'm just having flashbacks to going up
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:32.680]  against the Clintons at a very low level 16 17 years ago and how disgusting that
[02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:39.640]  experience was but at the end of the day I feel good I feel strong I feel brave and
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:44.840]  any fear I have only makes me stronger and it's transmuted into strength and
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:49.520]  honor but I want to believe in the people of this country and the people of the
[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:54.320]  world to say no to war with Russia no to arming ISIS to run around murdering
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:58.640]  non-radical Muslims and Christians no to destabilizing the planet no to the
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:04.760]  megabanks no to the moves to turn us into a prison economy they're gonna try to
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:09.400]  pass the TPP tomorrow I almost got champagne I only did that one other
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:13.280]  time when we got the Copenhagen Treaty shot down for carbon taxes got the
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:23.760]  secret document that it doubled taxes on the third world blew that up but I knew
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:31.800]  they'd be be back but we'll be back to this is an eternal fight and the reason
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:37.680]  evil is taking over is people decided they can just be spectators you're not
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:42.320]  even alive when you just roll over to this dehumanization and look at all the
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:48.360]  Democrats are the ones trying to shoot down TPP it's cut and dry they're going
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:51.720]  against their own president it gives the president dictatorial power to let
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:55.040]  foreign groups do whatever they want the three sections we've got are a giant's
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:57.480]  crew job
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:05.120]  and there are the Democrats doing the right thing and the Republican
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:11.800]  leadership a bunch of scum going along with it it makes me want to turn the
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:19.640]  desk over pull my hair out I mean do you understand folks if they can do this
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:29.680]  they can do anything we do have Max Geyser okay good this we're still
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:32.320]  working his Skype was down and we're trying to get around it and just get
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:39.000]  him on the phone that's fine I wanted to play this clip and get into the whole
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:42.720]  Confederate flag thing regardless of what you think about the Confederate flag
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:51.240]  the northern Virginia army battle flag which then became the personal flag that
[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:56.280]  signified Robert E. Lee the hero of the South that's what it symbolizes had
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:59.840]  nothing to do with slavery he didn't like slavery criticized that he was a top
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:03.680]  northern general the command on a West Point they wanted him to run for
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:07.880]  president of the United States his father was a super famous top general
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:11.040]  right-hand man to George Washington probably a better general than Washington
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:17.320]  he was one of the most popular people when he died in the north and and yeah
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:20.520]  of ne'er-do-wells and others have got it to be hateful other people it's about
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:27.400]  pride the South was reconstructed and put under a living hell for ten years and
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:34.280]  it became a symbol of defiance against that but it's being banned and the
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:42.120]  governor's calling for it to be banned just as a feel-good stunt and they're
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:45.000]  not gonna stop there it's gonna be other symbols and other things and people
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:58.000]  saying pull down statues of civil war heroes I mean it's just insane the war
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.480]  was never even about slavery it's just all made up in mainline history books
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:05.920]  they admit it was a just a side issue
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:10.600]  Christians in the north and the south were against slavery and they got it
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:15.840]  banned all over the world started in England Catholics and Protestants got
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:21.800]  it banned slavery still goes on in many areas where Christians aren't in
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:26.200]  control but if the public thinks it's Western culture that invented slavery
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:35.400]  it's Western culture that ended slavery if the historical ignorance of the
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:40.040]  public is mind-boggling and now the president I watched how they got O.J.
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:44.800]  Simpson off playing racism they'd get up and use the n-word over and over again
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:49.320]  no against incendiary and then notice the media blurbs the the the n-word when
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:52.680]  the president says it hey it's the president isn't he allowed to say it
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:15:00.200]  he's black supposedly and of course jacari did an excellent report zero
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:02.600]  hedge did one as well breaking down there are more slaves a day than ever
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:06.720]  before and there and people think every time I say we've got it in white
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:09.840]  slavery I get emails going don't you care about black slaves white slavery
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:21.000]  means sexual that's the term it's had for about a thousand years sex slavery is
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:26.600]  called white and then they've got the hardcore black slavery has nothing to do
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:33.800]  with blacks it's like white magic black magic it means they're really harsh type
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:40.760]  and Christians ended slavery in Europe a thousand years ago except in Germany it
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:44.880]  was serfdom in other areas they changed the name and so they had to have a new
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:48.520]  group to grab and so they started going and grabbing Africans and taking them
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:51.520]  to the Caribbean where Christians weren't because they wouldn't put up with it
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:58.240]  but I mean the public is just ignorant about all of this and it's very very
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:02.560]  frustrating and now we have the president running around using the n-word
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:06.240]  rubbing salt in the wound because it's all they've got to create a political
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:11.200]  diversion let's go ahead and play that clip that's still part of our DNA that's
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:18.640]  passed on and we're not cured of it racism racism we are not cured of clearly
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:25.640]  and it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say public that's not
[02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:34.800]  the measure of whether racism still exists or not I mean you talk about
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:41.080]  bull see we now think our rights is to have a sex change paid for by tax
[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:49.000]  payers or our right is to be able to pay for illegals to have free health care
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:52.600]  no a right is that you have your private property can be left alone to do
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:56.520]  whatever you want as long as it hurts somebody else and so they're taking all
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:16:59.960]  of our real rights collectively right now I mean we're going under foreign
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:05.560]  world government right now and you would think the only thing that exists on
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:15.480]  this planet is Jenner or the Confederate
[02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:21.720]  battle flag and regardless what you think about it the distortion of
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:25.200]  everything is mind-blowing now I wanted to get Max Kaiser on we were able to
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:28.000]  get him we're going to break here in a few minutes because he's been warning
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:34.960]  for about three years of a world bond meltdown he predicted it would happen
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:38.480]  by last winter there were some jitters then but it didn't happen it's bold to
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:41.560]  set a date but he's had a lot of predictions come true it certainly is
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:45.040]  the biggest bubble ever well now a hundred and forty billion dollar bond
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:49.240]  fund is going to cash as it braces for bond market collapse we'll tell you who's
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:52.720]  saying that we've got a lot of other analysts saying it turmoil coming to the
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:56.320]  markets prepare for bear markets and bonds Ron Paul
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:18:01.680]  Warren Buffett's basically saying the same thing Europe is having a move
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:06.000]  towards bank runs they're wanting to restrict cash and have bail ins I mean
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:14.360]  something this way wicked comes Max Kaiser where are we right now hey Alex
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:20.520]  Jones it is a pleasure to be back with you now let's talk about the bond
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:27.200]  apocalypse as you mentioned I was a bit early in my call I was looking for this
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:31.240]  last year you know this has been something people have been talking about
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:36.840]  for a number of years because the way to get out of all of the financial
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:42.720]  problems over the past 20 years has always been to quote extend and pretend
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:48.840]  which means wrap it all up in a fresh bond and offer it again but with a lower
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:52.800]  interest rates and with a longer maturity date and this has been going on
[02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:57.640]  for many years but now we're at the end game the globe now has two hundred
[02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:02.720]  trillion dollars of debt and keep in mind that the total GDP of the world is
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:06.560]  roughly 60 trillion but I thought derivatives were over two quadrillion
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:13.480]  well the GDP versus the debt the actual debt on the books not derivatives
[02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:19.640]  but the real debt is 200 trillion yeah 200 trillion dollars in actual debt not
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:23.040]  in the shadow banking system with the derivatives and all the stuff that they
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:26.920]  don't count but the actual debt that people count the national debt corporate
[02:19:26.920 --> 02:19:30.680]  debt all this debt mortgage debt two hundred trillion dollars with the debt
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:36.120]  there's a huge amount of debt and as a lot of pundits are now saying we're at
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:41.000]  the point where you simply can't add any more I'd stay there it's really important
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.800]  information Max Kaiser comm thank you for joining us Max Kaiser we're gonna look
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:48.960]  at this I mean look he said we were gonna have the baby when it was 10 months

[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:10.400]  led back at interest forcing taxes to service debt this capitalism or was
[02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:13.720]  Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a
[02:20:13.720 --> 02:20:16.920]  greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army Ted Anderson

[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:09.040]  about drug drug dealers that they cut the cocaine with some something like you
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:13.680]  know whatever baby baby laxative or whatever they put in there to make the
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:19.560]  kilo appear like five kilos or 10 kilos now what's happened in the bond market is
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:25.120]  that 20 years ago you had a certain amount of triple A rated sovereign
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:31.600]  government debt the good stuff pure government triple A rated bond but for
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:36.760]  20 years now they keep adding junk bonds to the mix they put the junk bonds in our
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:40.080]  pension funds they put the junk bonds in our corporations they put the junk
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:45.120]  bonds in our municipalities so when you cut any drug dealer knows if you cut cut
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:48.920]  cut cut cut eventually you end up with nothing you can't sell it it's garbage
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:52.840]  and that's where the bond market is today it's been cut so many times with
[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:58.640]  junk bonds and garbage and false accounting and misallocation that now
[02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:03.320]  the global bond market is it completely polluted is nothing that nobody wants
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:07.800]  on these sovereign bonds anymore to give you an idea how bad the situation is the
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:16.360]  US 10-year Treasury bond hasn't traded the yield hasn't been this low for 240
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:20.840]  years that's right the entire history of America there's never been a period where
[02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:26.360]  the bonds have been so hated what about the United Kingdom well in the 300 years
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:31.400]  since the Bank of England similar situation they've never had the yield
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:37.000]  at these low levels because nobody wants this paper anymore no matter how much
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:42.520]  they force them to buy it and and what we're seeing in my view Alex is that
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:48.680]  the social unrest the violence in America and around the world is the
[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:54.760]  result of a financial dislocation and a financial problem so when people say
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:59.160]  well when's the big collapse coming the answer is that it's happening right now
[02:26:59.160 --> 02:27:03.520]  that's what all this violence is about it's about towns and municipalities and
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:08.520]  societies falling apart they can't pay their bills anymore the sewage is being
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:12.080]  turned off there's basic services are being turned off here in London there's
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:16.760]  firing firemen policemen teachers they're being forced out of London because
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:22.080]  they've run out of money now the bond dealers the people who create those
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:27.960]  bonds the 200 trillion dollars worth of debt to hide the fact that society is
[02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:32.080]  breaking apart they get a fee and they are fabulously wealthy you mentioned
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:36.240]  Warren Buffett he's a good example he's in the business of selling the bonds
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:40.920]  he's in the business of expanding the debt so he gets wealthy but everyone else
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:45.960]  is falling apart and we see this incredible rise of violence in my view
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:50.240]  it's beyond the race question the race question is the smokescreen the real
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:53.760]  truth is that you've got a cadre of bankers on Wall Street in the city of
[02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:59.120]  London here in London who have destroyed the economy and people don't know where
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:04.880]  to turn they become violent and the race motivation is a smokescreen for class
[02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:11.280]  war between bankers and everybody else and and so and we see it now in the bond
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:14.480]  markets falling apart so what does that mean to the average person that means
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:20.280]  that interest rates which are the inverse of a bond price start to go up so
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:24.240]  your mortgage suddenly goes up and we know real interest rates are starting to
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:29.280]  creep up but the elite still give themselves zero percent interest so
[02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:34.760]  they can consolidate power at a real detriment to the real economy but they
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:38.720]  don't seem to care and then put out false economic numbers telling us
[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:43.160]  everything's peachy keen how long can this go on well we've seen a couple of
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:48.400]  examples of different scenarios so in Iceland they said no to the bankers they
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:51.880]  let their currency collapse and they've restarted their economy and now they're
[02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:56.600]  the fastest growing economy in Europe in Greece they are going to do a deal with
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:29:00.880]  the European Central Bank on the IMF to do this extend and pretend they're going
[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:04.520]  to load them up with more debt anyway and they're going to be continue being a
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:08.800]  vassal state to Germany and the ECB in the IMF so they're going to use debt
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:13.760]  slavery in Greece that's what it looks like Greece was was the fast looks like
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:19.520]  they're going to fail in standing up to the slave masters at the IMF they are
[02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:23.000]  not going to do in Iceland so they will continue being a slave so that the
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:28.040]  European Central Bank essentially absorbs all of Greece's debt they'll take
[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:32.400]  on another you know four or five hundred billion explain it to us long
[02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:36.040]  segment coming up and I agree with you the collapse has been incremental for a
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:41.360]  while it's going quicker now will there be some big events like Ron Paul's
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:47.720]  talking about Max Kaiser's our guest I'm Alex Jones stay with us Max Kaiser

[02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:20.600]  look I don't want to get in arguments with people out there about the use of
[02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:24.520]  words I don't get into debates about evolution or how life got on the planet
[02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:29.160]  I don't take the interpretation of preachers about how old the earth is and
[02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:33.000]  I'll take the interpretation of quacks scientists saying life just spontaneously
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:39.160]  began and it's the same thing when I use terms like a new age I don't mean that
[02:33:39.160 --> 02:33:44.840]  the new agey sense I mean we're coming to an end like iron age bronze age stone
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:52.760]  age work industrial age computer age we're coming to the end of an age all
[02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:57.920]  these mega bubbles all the corruption government gearing up with
[02:33:57.920 --> 02:34:02.240]  corporations to suppress people during the crisis ministry of defense Pentagon
[02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:11.120]  reports it's all admitted to a learned person liberal just means well-learned in
[02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:16.760]  the ancient text I'm a super liberal in that I'm into information I'm into how
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:19.840]  things work I don't think to be the smartest guy around but when the globalist
[02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:23.000]  have written thousands of books and publications telling us exactly what
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:26.360]  they're gonna do I can get up here and tell you what's coming and then it
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:29.800]  happens it doesn't mean it happens exactly how we said or when but in the
[02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:37.240]  general sense we're we're dead on in that dead reckoning spectrum some people
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:44.320]  act like Max Kaiser and myself or Ron Paul are trying to implode things no if a
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:48.840]  woman's nine months pregnant or waters broke you can say hey I bet she goes into
[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:54.960]  labor the next few days it ain't rocket science you looked at Zimbabwe 15 years
[02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:57.880]  ago when they started hyper accelerating their printing presses they had a boom
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:01.680]  at first every economist said that's gonna cause hyperinflation and total
[02:35:01.680 --> 02:35:06.200]  implosion it's a failed state now same thing with Weimar Germany same thing
[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:13.800]  with Mexico the value on their currency Argentina I mean the laws are not
[02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:17.000]  suspended they've just figured out ways to prop it up and I'll give the
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:24.920]  analogy of my best friend growing up we went to the hospital over a cut toe I
[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:31.360]  think it was he got an infection got into his guts got into his bloodstream
[02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:34.640]  killed him and I was there at the hospital had to golf the radio they said
[02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:40.080]  he's taken a turn for the worse I went off the radio I went over there and they
[02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:44.120]  were waiting for his dad to get here from Dallas driving like a 90 miles an
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:48.400]  hour and the nurses said look he's he's gonna die if we don't keep giving
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:51.480]  adrenaline he's gonna die and they said we think we give adrenaline one more
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:55.600]  time I keep my life for about an hour and he was on a respirator but he was
[02:35:55.600 --> 02:35:58.840]  conscious looking at me and I went in there the first they wanted me to get
[02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:02.800]  him to fight and everything and he was you know trying to fight but he couldn't
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:05.320]  talk the thing down his throat you'd see him in his eyes looking at me and
[02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:08.800]  tears come out his eyes but man I was there right for his dad got there they
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:11.760]  gave him that last thing with adrenaline it jacked him up for a while and then his
[02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:15.680]  eyes went glazed they looked at him and they said he's dead they took him off
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:19.760]  the respirator that night I remember sitting in there he was peacefully dead
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:26.080]  this country and this world economy is dead already it's on a respirator of QE
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:30.200]  unlimited and all I know is the elites are building bunkers and running to the
[02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:35.360]  hills I told you that first it's in the news now and I talked to big wigs this
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:38.440]  week a lot of them not just the two I talked to over the weekend now I've
[02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:42.160]  talked to more and there is a hysteria in the elite and you're seeing it in the
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:46.560]  news now now I hope the bubble doesn't pop now this is to be so painful but it
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:51.560]  can't go on forever I had a shift on yesterday and he said no we need to pop
[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:54.380]  it before it gets bigger it's more dangerous Max Kaiser you've got the
[02:36:54.380 --> 02:36:59.160]  floor for the next 12 14 minutes or so you were going over you know they keep
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:02.320]  cutting the cocaine they keep cutting the bonds down to where it's nothing but
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:07.240]  talcum powder now people are realizing that folks keep buying us bonds because
[02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:11.520]  they know if it goes under everything goes under but at some point it's like
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:17.880]  a snake eating itself I mean it's craziness and then the general yuppie
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:23.240]  public just thinks everything's wonderful because you know they can watch
[02:37:23.240 --> 02:37:29.000]  Caitlyn Jenner or whatever his name is I mean I'm not against Caitlyn Jenner I
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:33.320]  just don't care I mean it's mental illness that we promote all the stuff
[02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:36.480]  that doesn't matter at the end of the day and Confederate battle flag fights and
[02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:41.240]  just we're fighting over who polished the silverware the best on the deck of the
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:48.200]  Titanic's what I'm getting at and I look at this economy like my friend dead
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:52.480]  already or it's kind of use the wrath of con analogy a spot goes in to fix the
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:55.680]  reactor and you want Kirk wants to go in to save him and they grab and they say
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:37:58.960]  look you know he'll dive I don't get him out they go look he's dead already I
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:02.800]  don't know how long till Spock hits the ground but I mean he's leaning over right
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:07.400]  now his skins burned off I mean and then the people sitting there at us it's not
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:11.200]  bad it's not bad you're a liar you're a fair monger and we're just looking at
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:15.400]  weapons moving in with NATO to have war with Russia our government's so crazy
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:18.840]  they fund al-Qaeda to murder every Christian they find I mean we've got
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:24.200]  really evil people in charge and and and every instinct I've got is just get off
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:28.480]  the air get out of here roll over to the globalist and just run with my family
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:32.400]  but I'm not gonna do that max and I'm a hundred percent Sam what I believe what
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:36.320]  I see happening how long can this go on what is the state of the world what will
[02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:41.080]  the accelerated meltdown look like well first of all I have to ask there are
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:47.160]  people who confuse you with a new age incense burning a beer and stock sandal
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:56.040]  wearing yoga vatic master I'm shocked up in Texas worshiping crystals no no
[02:38:56.040 --> 02:38:59.240]  what I'm getting at is I say we're coming to the end of an age clearly
[02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:06.800]  clearly the end of an age you know like like they have to fund themselves they
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:15.120]  sell bonds right and what's happened is that they have starting to buy their
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:19.040]  own bond because nobody then nobody else nobody else wants to buy them out
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:23.240]  there so they're buying their own bonds because if they stop buying their own
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:30.040]  bond then the bond market collapse and interest rates go high and everything
[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:35.880]  falls apart like it did in 2008 so 2008 everything came to a dead stop and
[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:41.320]  suddenly there they printed $60 trillion the debt of the globe went from 140
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:45.720]  trillion to 200 trillion they printed 60 trillion dollars to essentially buy
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:51.960]  back their own mistakes the theory is why do they do this well the theory is
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:55.520]  that we're going to fake it till we make it you know we're going to keep
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:40:00.640]  interest rates low and this is going to get people to start businesses and wages
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:04.040]  are going to go higher and taxes are going to go up and once we get those
[02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:09.560]  taxes we're going to pay down this debt well it hasn't happened in seven years
[02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:15.160]  there hasn't been enough tax revenue to pay down the debt therefore the debt
[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:20.080]  keeps on going higher and higher and at some point you just have a
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:26.200]  capitulation where there's nobody left there's no greater fool left there's
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:30.200]  no more room to buy to eat your own vomit essentially is what the central bank
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:36.840]  is doing and and you have a repeat of 2008 but it just is much worse because
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:41.720]  there was never any reform a Barack Obama in my opinion the greatest failure of
[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:45.760]  his presidency is that when he took office he bailed out the bankers instead
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:50.360]  of bailing out Main Street he could have very easily bailed out Main Street he
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:54.480]  could have bailed out the mortgage holders not the mortgage underwriters and
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:58.400]  this whole crisis could have been averted after maybe two and a half years
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:04.000]  of a gut-wrenching adjustment we would now be expanding people would be a lot
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:09.800]  more hopeful and we wouldn't see this race you know violence erupt because
[02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:15.760]  people would be too busy making handover fist money and the United States would
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:20.400]  be a world leader instead he bailed out the bankers he left Main Street to rot
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:24.560]  so you have municipalities infrastructure potholes bridges just
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:28.800]  crumbling and that's because they're greedy and wanted to implode so they
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:32.760]  can buy it up for pennies on the dollar but only a suicide banker of the term
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:37.280]  you coined would do that because the conflagration is so incredibly dangerous
[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:42.320]  there's so many suicide bankers now there's another like every week there's
[02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:45.800]  another banker because they feel so ashamed of being in that industry and
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:49.840]  participating in financial terrorism that either they just outright kill
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:53.280]  themselves out of embarrassment to be associated with the likes of Jamie
[02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:57.480]  Diamond or Lloyd Blank fine or they just blow themselves up because you know
[02:41:57.480 --> 02:42:02.880]  that they've lost their mind but when you give guys unlimited credit at zero
[02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:05.880]  percent interest and every time they make a mistake the government bails them
[02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:10.800]  out you know you're encouraging psychosis on a mass scale well I just
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:14.280]  agree with you I think most of these hundreds of bankers dying a year being
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:20.720]  murdered well you know in the case of JP Morgan you know when you work for them
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:23.560]  and I worked on Wall Street for many years you know when you do a life
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:28.720]  insurance contract it's in the name of the firm not the name of your family so
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:33.640]  if you're dead the firm gets the death benefit not your family aren't these
[02:42:33.640 --> 02:42:38.520]  guys the biggest gangsters ever you told the story was a JP Morgan calling up or
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:42.920]  was it Goldman Sachs and said listen you give us our billion dollars or we're
[02:42:42.920 --> 02:42:46.760]  gonna kill you and I my understanding is that he threatened to kill John
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:50.920]  Corzine during the MF global scandal they got paid the billion dollars ahead
[02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:56.120]  of any other creditor but totally broke the law that's a completely unlawful
[02:42:56.120 --> 02:42:59.840]  act of security listen in there I've been there at the highest levels of some
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:03.640]  major business and also Hollywood when you get in these rooms with these guys
[02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:08.400]  they are beyond gangsters out of movies and they really do I mean that's who
[02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:14.480]  they are the public is so naive well the public doesn't have any sense that
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:19.720]  there are victims to these financial crimes but I in my view the way society
[02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:24.120]  is breaking apart America is because the economy is breaking apart America so it
[02:43:24.120 --> 02:43:28.520]  I don't make doesn't make sense to say well when is the big bond bubble gonna
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:33.600]  collapse because by then if you're not prepared it'll be too late and during
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:38.200]  this interim period all of these portions of society are breaking down
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:42.520]  anyway so this is happening right now it's happening in real time it's
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:48.280]  here so it's not about the absolute moment when you suddenly have a bond
[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:53.600]  apocalypse and there's another 2008 like scenario if you're not completely
[02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:57.720]  prepared at that point you know you will it'll be too late but you should know
[02:43:57.720 --> 02:44:03.120]  that you're already experiencing a degradation in your society in your
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:07.120]  country because of the massive quantities of wealth that have been stolen
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:13.560]  by the folks that we've been talking about except for a few chosen cities a
[02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:22.520]  few chosen areas like Austin Texas like some areas of Orange County you drive
[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:26.680]  around the country having all over it it looks like a bombed-out third-world war
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:30.480]  zone compared to what it looked like decades ago when I went on road trips
[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:34.560]  across this nation I mean this country becomes generational so now you've got
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:40.240]  the whole generation people that are just now 20 21 22 who have don't know
[02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:45.200]  anything different so they grew up without their expectations are that
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:48.600]  America is a second-world country that America is a third-world country they
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:54.200]  never they have no memory of America from even the 1980s and when I started
[02:44:54.200 --> 02:44:58.920]  working on Wall Street in the 1980s America the wages in America were still
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:02.920]  relatively quite high you could have a single family breadwinner you could have
[02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:06.280]  people going to school without incurring huge amounts of debt you could get a
[02:45:06.280 --> 02:45:13.240]  decent I walked on onto a brokerage firm in 1983 got a job on the spot and became
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:17.720]  very very successful pretty quickly without any training in that field
[02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:21.640]  whatsoever because the opportunities were there there were many firms on Wall
[02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:26.320]  Street now they've all been either gone bankrupt or been taken over now you only
[02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:30.040]  have two or three were firms on Wall Street there's a me Merrill Lynch has
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:33.880]  now been taken I was talking to a well-known a former owner of a large
[02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:37.920]  brokerage company that managed billions and he just said you know about six
[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:43.800]  months before 2008 he sold it all got out and he said because the writing was
[02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:47.640]  already on the wall that the regulators would shut you down even if you followed
[02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:51.400]  all the rules because they were run by the big three brokerage houses that were
[02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:55.560]  consolidating and it's a massive barrier century and it's all corny
[02:45:55.560 --> 02:45:59.120]  capitalism so you know when I was working on Wall Street in the early 80s
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:04.600]  there was stories of shoe shine boys who who got their broker's license and
[02:46:04.600 --> 02:46:08.320]  became incredibly successful you never hear about stories like that anymore
[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:11.520]  because all those avenues toward progress have been completely shut down now
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:16.600]  it's now a closed shop but the way it was back in the 50s and 60s where it was
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:19.960]  the old boys and it was all very controlled and because that's where the
[02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:24.920]  access of the money is when the Fed print a hundred billion dollars you know
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:31.640]  away just or a trillion dollars it's distributed through the primary dealer
[02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:35.720]  system there's I think 18 primary dealers they're on Wall Street they're big
[02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:38.560]  names that you would be familiar with they're the ones to get the money first
[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:43.680]  and then their job is to distribute the money by selling reselling the bonds and
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:47.040]  reselling securities so if you have a job at one of those groups one of those
[02:46:47.040 --> 02:46:50.280]  firms and there's only a few where you can get an they're more institutional
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:53.280]  oriented they're not retail oriented but if you're working inside one of those
[02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:57.040]  firms you're literally given you know I mean you walk into the office every day
[02:46:57.040 --> 02:47:01.360]  and the government gives you a million bucks and they say can you resell this
[02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:06.480]  million bucks and keep you know keep 50 60 thousand bucks for yourself and we're
[02:47:06.480 --> 02:47:10.600]  gonna do this every single day for the next five years that's your job just
[02:47:10.600 --> 02:47:14.880]  restyle what we just gave you and you make $50,000 a day you take about an
[02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:19.120]  hour I mean what about Wall Street if you work more than two hours a day you
[02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:24.200]  know you are an idiot because at that point there was it was during that
[02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:28.320]  incredible bull market of the 1980s and this money was pouring in like crazy
[02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:32.600]  then it's not the same anymore but in the bond market though in the sovereign bond
[02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:36.320]  market the government bond market the thing that's keeping this titanic
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:42.640]  partially afloat is huge and it's free money they just give it to these guys
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:51.480]  when will the adrenaline stop working and and how do we kill over it she has
[02:47:51.480 --> 02:47:59.160]  this like a 2008 nothing changed to stop the problems of 2008 and what happened
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:04.040]  in 2008 is that banks stop trusting each other so they stop lending to each
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:08.480]  other so you have a credit freeze credit is no longer moving so you have
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:13.640]  essentially everything comes to a halt and money very quickly runs out the
[02:48:13.640 --> 02:48:17.560]  actual cash in the system there's not really actually any cash I mean the
[02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:22.640]  cash at the ATM machine that kind of cash it's a miniscule compared to the
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:28.000]  electronic cash the electronic cash is probably 98 99% of all cash none of that
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:31.920]  becomes available only the physical stuff in the ATMs is available that runs
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:36.560]  out in three or four days now it's gone and now you're sitting there with no
[02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:42.200]  cash no access to cash and the system is frozen so then you have a completely
[02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:46.320]  different reality you have people that could listen to your show that have
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:54.120]  something to trade for they've got you know some gold from silver you know I
[02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:57.280]  mean what do you make of Texas one against cold back from the New York
[02:48:57.280 --> 02:49:02.120]  private Fed and the Germans and everybody stupid you know I mean the guy
[02:49:02.120 --> 02:49:09.480]  who was behind that very long-standing Wall Street stalwart the name escapes me
[02:49:09.480 --> 02:49:13.520]  but he's from a long line Texas family the name I'll think of it's second we
[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:17.000]  hang up but you know he's the one who put that in place that he knows the
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:21.640]  writings on the wall these the insiders know that like the Roadrunner cartoon
[02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:25.160]  when Wiley Coyote is running off the cliff there's a few seconds where he's
[02:49:25.160 --> 02:49:29.240]  still up there in the air but in his pounding his legs and he looked at him
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:32.880]  he say hey dude you know you've run out of a cliff you know you're you're about
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:37.640]  to collapse that's what the insiders know where we've got the Wiley Coyote
[02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:43.720]  moment so the Texas is very wisely have repatriated so has Austria so has
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:49.120]  Russia's buying thousands of tons of gold Germany hasn't China China's been buying
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:53.320]  gold Germany already has a lot of gold the insiders are buying and accumulating
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:58.440]  the gold Texas doing a very smart move by by doing it you know you got to look
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:04.560]  at that and if that is not telling you something you are not well you're not
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:08.000]  listening you're not listening to what's happening okay well obviously the
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:11.320]  collapse has already begun in the third world millions more starving every year
[02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:15.200]  riots all over the planet it hasn't completely hit here yet but the waters
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:19.400]  rising towards our higher islands that are really just mountains that you know
[02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:23.640]  here on the bottom of the sea sticking up above the surface is there bigger
[02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:30.320]  moments where the collapse accelerates well I mean you remember 2008 it was not
[02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:37.760]  that long ago the entire world economy had come to a grinding halt and you had
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:45.400]  every bank on Wall Street was facing insolvency and there was panic and they
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:49.080]  got together and they said okay we're all going to work together except for
[02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:51.880]  Lehman Brothers Lehman Brothers because they wouldn't tell us about it in the

[02:53:13.040 --> 02:53:17.360]  such a thing as electronic pickpocketing what is that well apparently many of
[02:53:17.360 --> 02:53:20.960]  the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them
[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:25.160]  called RFID the transmitter banking information to card readers when we pay
[02:53:25.160 --> 02:53:29.280]  unfortunately a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the
[02:53:29.280 --> 02:53:32.480]  city scanning people collecting their credit card numbers and personal
[02:53:32.480 --> 02:53:37.040]  information without us knowing it wow that sounds scary since you're getting a

[02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:44.720]  and post them on Facebook and Twitter rebel flag controversy why not just ban

[02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:59.400]  which they want to distract us from the social unrest and make it racial Google

[02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:24.160]  about that I was getting into the economy in gold and all things that are
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:28.520]  happening but what about now NATO saying they're gonna have a logistics
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:35.240]  commandos fighter bombers directly in Ukraine attacking the Russians I mean
[02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:38.960]  this this and it's not even a big news item it's just like all we're sick of
[02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:44.800]  hearing about Ukraine big deal it really is mental illness what are the
[02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:49.200]  establishment people thinking Max Kaiser or is this threat of war meant to
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:54.360]  prop up the financial system somehow the Ukraine that we know you can't pay back
[02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:57.720]  our loans but we're gonna give you the money anyway and then they turn around
[02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:01.480]  tell Greece that you can't pay back the loan so we're not gonna give you any
[02:56:01.480 --> 02:56:06.280]  money well you know so why is the IMF Christine Lagarde why are they
[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:11.080]  dictating global geopolitics they're not elected body nobody put them in
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:15.120]  charge they're just a bank this is an example of what we're saying where the
[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:20.240]  bankers take over and they start dictating policy so they're saying I'm
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:26.480]  F is saying to Greece you have to starve you have to be Germany's debt slave then
[02:56:26.480 --> 02:56:30.640]  they turn around to Ukraine and say oh we love you Ukraine we love you here's
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:38.360]  all the money we know you can't pay back well so why what's the double standard
[02:56:38.360 --> 02:56:43.840]  there there's no explanation why you in Ukraine is totally control Ukraine and
[02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:46.680]  they're giving it to Joe Biden son I mean you're gonna put my there's no
[02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:50.200]  chance of a zillion you're ever gonna see any of that back at least at Greece
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:56.240]  they have some kind of you know economy with olives and tourism it isn't
[02:56:56.240 --> 02:57:02.640]  saying now you were you just a moment ago you were talking about truck drivers
[02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:07.200]  you know these Google cars the auto-driving cars you know that the
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:13.200]  number one job in 39 states in America is truck driver so imagine when these
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:18.400]  self-driving trucks take to the highway that's the number one job in 39 states
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:23.080]  in America that's gonna be a huge wave of unemployment on top of the current
[02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:29.200]  unemployment that just means more violence more unrest more tension why
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:34.240]  it will for what purpose who does it serve who's writing these and is it
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:39.760]  knucklehead ideas into their policies makes no sense do five more minutes
[02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:42.280]  with us because I forgot to get to the point you wanted to cover experimenting

[02:57:46.040 --> 02:57:54.040]  tech crunch you sent me and Max Kaiser JP Morgan big article about that says
[02:57:54.040 --> 02:58:00.280]  that he is the devil incarnate oh yeah I said that the devil incarnate is the
[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:06.760]  life masters I made that point I was up in Belfast and life masters is trying to
[02:58:06.760 --> 02:58:12.680]  control Bitcoin and as you know a big Bitcoin supporter and now she is in
[02:58:12.680 --> 02:58:16.820]  league with some very unscrupulous people and they're trying to take over
[02:58:16.820 --> 02:58:21.160]  Bitcoin so the battle is on the fight is on it's Max Kaiser versus life masters
[02:58:21.160 --> 02:58:25.680]  once again after we battled in the silver market now we're battling in the
[02:58:25.680 --> 02:58:30.640]  Bitcoin market she is by far of all the corrupt bankers on Wall Street that have

[03:00:07.720 --> 03:00:13.280]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network it's that little
[03:00:13.280 --> 03:00:18.640]  customary extra five minutes I do that's pretty much internet only when the
[03:00:18.640 --> 03:00:24.880]  main broadcast is over it's kind of like a palate cleanser bites of sherbert
[03:00:24.880 --> 03:00:31.440]  finishing up with Max Kaiser info wars dot com Max Kaiser dot com can follow him
[03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:35.960]  on Twitter by going there to that side Max everything's getting more and more
[03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:41.520]  game you brought up the driverless cars time magazine others have said get rid
[03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:44.880]  of humans driving robots are better well how about kill all the humans and say
[03:00:44.880 --> 03:00:48.360]  robots are better it's like this anti-human view of the elite is
[03:00:48.360 --> 03:00:54.840]  translating down but globalism destroys the market it's consolidating and then
[03:00:54.840 --> 03:00:58.080]  these globalists just think they're gonna run off to their armored redoubts and
[03:00:58.080 --> 03:01:06.200]  be safe forever they're crazy genocism techno eugenics they are we they're
[03:01:06.200 --> 03:01:10.560]  creating the master race of robot slaves so I mean getting back to Ukraine for a
[03:01:10.560 --> 03:01:14.240]  second any nine-year-old or the internet connection can see after five minutes
[03:01:14.240 --> 03:01:19.280]  that Ukraine is being run by Nazis and the IMF is mostly owned by the America
[03:01:19.280 --> 03:01:25.440]  so America supports Nazi in the Ukraine simultaneously the IMF is saying well
[03:01:25.440 --> 03:01:29.480]  the you know Greece has to restructure in a way that pleases Germany and and
[03:01:29.480 --> 03:01:33.720]  Germany by the way is still they're filling the source from the original
[03:01:33.720 --> 03:01:38.360]  Nazis so you know the Nazi theme is running quite quite rampant through the
[03:01:38.360 --> 03:01:44.920]  IMF right now well the year was a Nazi project it we have no kidding so it is
[03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:51.320]  the Greeks are understandably upset but you know they I like many people before
[03:01:51.320 --> 03:01:57.320]  when you have an economic collapse you suddenly if you lose most of your
[03:01:57.320 --> 03:02:00.920]  ability to fight back that's why in America right now people still have the
[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:05.040]  ability to fight back against the real the real oppressors to vote with their
[03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:10.200]  dollars on the street fighting each other over silly silly stuff they really
[03:02:10.200 --> 03:02:13.720]  don't understand what the threat is and they're not organizing in a way that was
[03:02:13.720 --> 03:02:17.920]  going to meaningfully preserve the freedoms that they have come to enjoy
[03:02:17.920 --> 03:02:21.880]  and it's really sad to see that I can see it clearly because I'm not in the
[03:02:21.880 --> 03:02:26.080]  United States so I get to look at it from a kind of a big picture view but
[03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:31.640]  yeah I can see that on an interesting and basis town towns man man woman woman
[03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:36.640]  there they're engaged in these little fights that are going there and there
[03:02:36.640 --> 03:02:42.400]  was sleepwalking into tyranny I'll say that America is sleepwalking into
[03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:48.120]  tyranny very sad but it looks irreversible at this point and the
[03:02:48.120 --> 03:02:51.200]  establishment has made the conscious decision to do it what do you make of
[03:02:51.200 --> 03:02:57.400]  TPP and the arrogance that they're about to pass it tomorrow well TPP just
[03:02:57.400 --> 03:03:03.320]  gives you throw the keys of the castle to a bunch of corporations that are
[03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:07.240]  eugenic eugenicists who are known to live every country they get to the
[03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:12.600]  ground yeah month the Monsanto is the pure eugenicism pure eugenics Monsanto
[03:03:12.600 --> 03:03:17.240]  they're a huge the copyright cartel you know is really putting up a good fight
[03:03:17.240 --> 03:03:22.400]  right now I'd say the D number one threat to the monopolists right now is
[03:03:22.400 --> 03:03:28.800]  Kim dot com Kim dot com is putting together a new company called Megan
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:34.440]  that and Megan that is going to challenge the internet by introducing a new
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:39.720]  internet that's going to run on the spare capacity of people's smartphones by
[03:03:39.720 --> 03:03:44.920]  the way Kim invited Leanne out there before he even announced that and it
[03:03:44.920 --> 03:03:49.800]  never happened I need to get an update from Leanne McAdoo but yeah well this
[03:03:49.800 --> 03:03:55.280]  going to be a completely encrypted internet he he is he has gone to war
[03:03:55.280 --> 03:03:58.680]  with the copyright lobby and the copyright lobby is very ugly and
[03:03:58.680 --> 03:04:02.760]  pernicious out there in Hollywood and you know he's making big strides he's
[03:04:02.760 --> 03:04:07.320]  got some legal victories just saying what they are Hollywood is run by the
[03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:13.840]  Italian and Jewish mafia to run by the copyright cartel who believes that they
[03:04:13.840 --> 03:04:20.360]  have perpetual ownership of ideas and that if you if we talked about this
[03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:25.480]  before once they have perpetual ownership on all ideas if you so much as
[03:04:25.480 --> 03:04:29.360]  put a word like Disney in an email you're gonna get a bill oh yeah they're
[03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:33.040]  openly saying that exactly and then and then this Panopticonic surveillance
[03:04:33.040 --> 03:04:37.280]  great everybody loves is meant to tax and track you at every level and again
[03:04:37.280 --> 03:04:41.160]  you just got a bunch of mafia's Dixie mafia's everything is running wild it's
[03:04:41.160 --> 03:04:46.200]  all digital so it's all easy to track the databases the cost of you know the the
[03:04:46.200 --> 03:04:51.680]  cost of tax collecting storage digital transmission and digital processing over
[03:04:51.680 --> 03:04:56.160]  the past 30 years has collapsed and that's why they want taxes for a unit in
[03:04:56.160 --> 03:05:01.840]  Utah where they can sort every single email and thank you max great job
