[00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:44.105]  It is September 4th, 2019 on this Wednesday, live edition.
[00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:58.175]  And it's with heavy heart that I have to tell you that I am now having to think about ways to trigger an initiative to begin the impeachment of Donald John Trump, the 45th President of the United States.
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.741]  Very, very grave situation.
[00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:02.942]  And when I woke up at 5 a.m.
[00:01:02.942 --> 00:01:15.247]  this morning and saw the article on InfoWars.com and went to the Washington Post and read it, and then I did two plus hours of research, and I knew what I had to do.
[00:01:15.247 --> 00:01:28.273]  I had to come on air today and throw down the gauntlet to President Trump and just lay it out that we are not going to go quietly into that dark night of technocracy.
[00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:39.856]  Now I want to be clear, President Trump may not actually be supporting what I'm about to announce, that they say he is supporting.
[00:01:39.856 --> 00:01:58.642]  But regardless, he's got people in his administration that are supporting it, and if they are not reeled in, then it's clear the President is playing a double game.
[00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:16.346]  Now, all yesterday, I talked about, does President Trump know when he releases the Pentagon and DARPA against, quote, memes, that that's mainly his supporters?
[00:02:16.346 --> 00:02:21.190]  And they're even calling Mitch McConnell in the DARPA statements, Moscow Mitch.
[00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.292]  I mean, this is the outside globalist group destroying the country.
[00:02:24.292 --> 00:02:28.214]  And Trump's doing nothing to block the funding of this.
[00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:30.216]  In fact, he's got some people in his administration
[00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:32.422]  Running around cheerleading it.
[00:02:32.422 --> 00:02:34.424]  But that's not where we're going today.
[00:02:34.424 --> 00:02:44.151]  That's in the same... wheelhouse.
[00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:48.114]  Now, I've done massive preparation for this broadcast.
[00:02:48.114 --> 00:02:49.655]  Let me show folks an overhead shot, please.
[00:02:49.655 --> 00:02:50.956]  I want to show folks.
[00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:51.637]  Yeah, pull back for me.
[00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:52.898]  I want a wide overhead shot.
[00:02:52.898 --> 00:02:56.400]  A wide overhead shot's kind of with my head right here, so you can see all the articles.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.101]  Yeah, that's what I want.
[00:02:57.101 --> 00:02:58.122]  I want to ask for that.
[00:02:58.122 --> 00:02:58.382]  Thank you.
[00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:07.529]  When I come back, I'm going to tell you what Trump's done.
[00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:09.890]  And what's being proposed.
[00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.252]  The headline is live on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:03:13.252 --> 00:03:26.121]  And we're going to add the live feed of the show into the article covering this that's linked up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:03:26.121 --> 00:03:29.763]  But when I come back, we're going to cover it.
[00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.211]  Now, Paul Watson's article's strong, but it's not strong enough.
[00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:41.196]  He'll be joining us at 15 after.
[00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:46.900]  Trump administration considering social credit score system to determine who can buy a gun.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:55.345]  Now, when you actually read the proposal, it's so many times worse than that, that it's staggering.
[00:03:55.345 --> 00:03:59.188]  It's not just the end of the process and a digital red flag.
[00:04:00.603 --> 00:04:24.501]  It is a consortium of psychologists and psychiatrists in DARPA, with a new agency they're setting up called HARPA, where all of your smart devices listen to you in live time, which they're already doing, but they admit it in the paper, and report back to big tech that runs it for the shadow government.
[00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:35.834]  All they did was basically get everybody to opt in the last 20 years to social media into the NSA to waive your rights.
[00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:38.055]  And now they're dropping the hammer on us.
[00:04:38.055 --> 00:04:43.358]  And Trump is reportedly set to push this.
[00:04:43.358 --> 00:04:44.639]  So this is their coming out.
[00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.660]  Now that you know they're listening to you, think of that scandal.
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.861]  Now this is their coming out.
[00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:52.664]  Well, they're just gonna say, yeah, that's right.
[00:04:52.664 --> 00:04:57.190]  By the way, your social score gets downgraded if you don't carry a smartphone so they can listen to you.
[00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.372]  That means they can't trust you.
[00:04:59.455 --> 00:05:04.658]  It's been a year since InfoWars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:12.582]  We had over 5 million views when we got banned, and we're credited with getting Donald Trump elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[00:05:12.582 --> 00:05:20.546]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable to block the signal.
[00:05:20.546 --> 00:05:21.586]  And it's now here.
[00:05:21.586 --> 00:05:22.347]  Banned.Video.
[00:05:23.347 --> 00:05:37.921]  Banned.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are still available.
[00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:41.785]  Watch your favorite content from media personalities banned by big tech.
[00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:42.926]  Works on every device.
[00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:45.769]  Take your shows on the go with banned.video.
[00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:52.334]  Watch live shows, on-demand content, and join in on the conversation from anywhere with Band.Video.

[00:05:56.317 --> 00:05:57.077]  Band.Video.
[00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:09.647]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:09.647 --> 00:06:20.911]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:20.911 --> 00:06:30.914]  So, I'm sure all of you have noticed in the last six months there have been thousands of articles and TV news programs saying, hey, it's true.
[00:06:33.278 --> 00:06:43.823]  Over 40 different home assistants, including smart speakers in your boat, or your car, or your RV, or your home, are listening to you.
[00:06:43.823 --> 00:06:47.584]  And in many cases, there's now cameras on these devices.
[00:06:47.584 --> 00:06:48.945]  They're watching you.
[00:06:49.946 --> 00:07:06.132]  And they're reporting it all back to big tech and to AI and to whole teams of people that are specifically going into the recordings and listening to key parts of it because keyword is all recorded and put into a text file that's then searchable.
[00:07:06.132 --> 00:07:09.194]  Now that's beyond 1984.
[00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:16.056]  And we've had all these big tech heads come out in the last week and say, you know, it's really not a big deal.
[00:07:16.056 --> 00:07:17.797]  We need to just accept
[00:07:19.608 --> 00:07:26.051]  That you're being listened to and you're being watched and there's no such thing as privacy.
[00:07:26.051 --> 00:07:29.933]  And they're coming out saying, and yes, your smart TV is listening to you and watching you.
[00:07:29.933 --> 00:07:36.737]  And yes, all the new speakers you buy and your dishwashers, just everything has a microphone in it.
[00:07:36.737 --> 00:07:40.279]  Just like they have the CIA said a decade ago, we'll watch you via your dishwasher.
[00:07:41.292 --> 00:07:42.934]  None of this stops crime.
[00:07:42.934 --> 00:07:44.836]  None of this stops terrorists.
[00:07:44.836 --> 00:07:57.350]  This is all used to spy and control the population and put into giant algorithms to then track populations and be able to manipulate populations and be able, with a global social credit score,
[00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.031]  To control your every movement.
[00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:03.752]  Already tens of millions of flights cancelled.
[00:08:03.752 --> 00:08:06.734]  Two and a half million people not allowed to ride on a train or a bus.
[00:08:06.734 --> 00:08:13.257]  The Chinese government said this year you won't be able to move two feet outside your door if you haven't submitted.
[00:08:13.257 --> 00:08:16.279]  And then of course you submit and it's always more and more and more they want.
[00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:17.139]  So why?
[00:08:17.139 --> 00:08:18.080]  Why am I so upset?
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.421]  Why am I so concerned?
[00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:24.463]  The story's up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:08:24.463 --> 00:08:26.524]  It's also at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:26.524 --> 00:08:28.665]  But the easiest place to find it is DrudgeReport.com.
[00:08:30.455 --> 00:08:33.597]  We've also added a live feed to this broadcast.
[00:08:33.597 --> 00:08:36.458]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us in the next segment.
[00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:44.763]  We're going to be laying all of this out, but you need to share this so we have a chain reaction and resist, because here's what I'm getting at.
[00:08:44.763 --> 00:08:49.246]  We have a right and a duty to know we're being listened to and being watched.
[00:08:49.246 --> 00:08:59.432]  We need to know these big predatory companies have lied to Congress, lied to us, lied to everyone, and are doing it because, and I'm going to show you the proof, this is an admitted
[00:09:01.289 --> 00:09:10.680]  ARPA DARPA program adopted as US policy in 1962.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:17.709]  And they laid out the social media system, how they would launch it by 2000, how they would have a Facebook,
[00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:40.035]  I'm going to show you all the public documents and how finally they would make all these systems so addictive that you will give up on your family, give up on your neighbors, and become completely habitualized to a quote, symbiosis with computers and a merger with machines.
[00:09:40.035 --> 00:09:41.315]  Remember NBC News.
[00:09:42.506 --> 00:09:44.128]  A week and a half ago.
[00:09:44.128 --> 00:09:46.472]  Cyborgs will replace humans and remake the world.
[00:09:46.472 --> 00:09:53.002]  James Lovelock says humans will be obsolete by this generation and will be extinct.
[00:09:54.753 --> 00:09:56.314]  That's the first paragraph.
[00:09:56.314 --> 00:10:14.828]  So understand, those building this architecture are building all of this to lower your IQ, to make you lonely, to make you alone, to make you not have an attention span, and to cause you to have basically narcoleptic-style brain disorders that are exploding more than 50,000 percent.
[00:10:14.828 --> 00:10:16.089]  Last number I saw.
[00:10:16.089 --> 00:10:18.891]  The public is in a trance zombie state.
[00:10:18.891 --> 00:10:21.233]  Stand around at the mall or grocery store, look at most people.
[00:10:21.233 --> 00:10:22.493]  They look like dead zombies.
[00:10:23.374 --> 00:10:28.617]  Go to a rodeo or some right-wing event, people's eyes are on fire and they're awake and they're alive.
[00:10:28.617 --> 00:10:32.719]  This whole leftist culture is about domestication and spiritual death.
[00:10:32.719 --> 00:10:36.320]  Now, let me get to the big news.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.482]  I don't go after Trump to get brownie points with people.
[00:10:39.482 --> 00:10:42.103]  I don't hedge my bets to get the left off my back.
[00:10:42.103 --> 00:10:46.405]  They're gonna come after me regardless because I'm against their anti-human project.
[00:10:46.405 --> 00:10:49.467]  But Trump, The Washington Post reports,
[00:10:51.121 --> 00:11:07.606]  And that doesn't mean it's true, but it means the proposal's been brought to him repeatedly, is considering, and it's one of his best friends who is proposing it to him, that we know is true, with Ivanka Trump quarterbacking it, to have all devices listen and watch.
[00:11:07.606 --> 00:11:20.050]  Now they're already doing it, but you ever wonder how they're going to come out with it, instead of all this bad PR, because they're having to admit they're doing it, because of terms of service, because of lawsuits, because of us first breaking it, 2004, with the documents from Google?
[00:11:24.906 --> 00:11:27.948]  Think about that, 15 years ago.
[00:11:27.948 --> 00:11:29.009]  So what are they going to have to do?
[00:11:29.009 --> 00:11:30.710]  They need a coming out.
[00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.133]  And so the coming out is, oh, a new federal agency.
[00:11:34.133 --> 00:11:36.014]  It's already set up.
[00:11:36.014 --> 00:11:44.901]  DARPA was set up by psychiatrists, and I'm going to show you the documents, to run all of this and to track how their propaganda is working on you.
[00:11:45.717 --> 00:11:52.619]  And how you would have handheld computers that would then wirelessly or plug into central terminals to track everything you do.
[00:11:52.619 --> 00:11:53.940]  Your currency would be on it.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:12:03.303]  All of this was proposed by the head scientist at DARPA and put into public papers in 1962.
[00:12:03.303 --> 00:12:06.264]  It's DARPA and the Brain Initiative.
[00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:10.233]  And it says it word for word.
[00:12:10.233 --> 00:12:13.295]  Your merger with machines, and then I'm going to give you the key.
[00:12:13.295 --> 00:12:20.741]  They were tasked in 1951, the Carnegie Endowment, for ending war.
[00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:24.804]  And then they created State Department Memorandum 7277 that I'm going to show you.
[00:12:24.804 --> 00:12:28.087]  And they said the only way to end war is to end humanity.
[00:12:29.568 --> 00:12:45.833]  And the only way to do it is to remove the family, the sexes, and make us units that live in tanks, and our own heat will then power the circuitry in a human-machine interface.
[00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:48.534]  Now, you may have heard of that in a 1999 film, The Matrix.
[00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:50.415]  That's all revelation of the method.
[00:12:50.415 --> 00:12:57.577]  I'm going to show you, after Paul Watson leaves us, in the second hour,
[00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:05.132]  I have got more than 100 documents directly from DARPA, directly from MIT that are public.
[00:13:05.132 --> 00:13:06.833]  This is public.
[00:13:06.833 --> 00:13:14.495]  And you're going to read stuff from 1962 that is all now happened exactly as they said.
[00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:21.598]  Now people are going to want to augment with the microchips and the wires next year that Elon Musk is rolling out.
[00:13:21.598 --> 00:13:22.558]  You'll need to upgrade.
[00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:27.631]  And then soon it'll be, hey, you'll live forever, supposedly, it's gonna be great.
[00:13:27.631 --> 00:13:33.433]  Just put your body in this tank, and then as your body prepares to transition, you'll never know, you just transitioned into the Matrix.
[00:13:33.433 --> 00:13:35.594]  Really, you're gonna actually die.
[00:13:35.594 --> 00:13:39.496]  The truth is, you don't live in those tanks, you die in those tanks.
[00:13:39.496 --> 00:13:45.598]  But they're gonna plug into your pleasure centers, where it's gonna feel like 500 orgasms at once.
[00:13:45.598 --> 00:13:48.099]  And then they're gonna plug you in and say, sign the paper.
[00:13:48.099 --> 00:13:49.100]  You're gonna go, oh, hell yeah.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.923]  You're going to sign the paper, and then you're going to go in the tank.
[00:13:54.923 --> 00:13:59.527]  They want to start putting people in tanks within 10 years.
[00:13:59.527 --> 00:14:01.769]  That's been announced.
[00:14:01.769 --> 00:14:07.374]  So, listen to me very carefully.
[00:14:07.374 --> 00:14:08.855]  They've already addicted your children.
[00:14:08.855 --> 00:14:10.077]  They've already addicted most of you.
[00:14:10.077 --> 00:14:12.919]  They've addicted myself.
[00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:14.620]  But I'm weaning off of it.
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.242]  This is real.
[00:14:16.242 --> 00:14:17.123]  This is the plan.
[00:14:18.473 --> 00:14:26.576]  And obviously, the globalists didn't get this out of the air.
[00:14:26.576 --> 00:14:35.119]  Some really bad folks cooked this up.
[00:14:35.119 --> 00:14:38.821]  And let's just say they don't like people too much.
[00:14:38.821 --> 00:14:45.043]  So, everybody better decide which side you're going to be on here, ladies and gentlemen, because El Diablo
[00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:46.571]  Yes.
[00:15:06.061 --> 00:15:08.643]  Once it actually starts happening, we'll just think, oh, that's a movie.
[00:15:08.643 --> 00:15:11.946]  But your subconscious will be prepared and accepting, and it won't be alien.
[00:15:11.946 --> 00:15:13.147]  It will seem natural.
[00:15:13.147 --> 00:15:22.115]  So you will conform and see it at a Pavlovian level, where you were eating milk duds and a cherry Slurpee and a hot dog at the movie.
[00:15:22.115 --> 00:15:28.420]  While you were watching these horrible things, you were being imprinted that it was non-threatening entertainment.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.321]  You understand?
[00:15:29.321 --> 00:15:32.224]  Now, there are a lot of paths.
[00:15:32.224 --> 00:15:33.425]  They may just go with the biological
[00:15:34.545 --> 00:15:35.045]  We're good to go.
[00:15:57.537 --> 00:15:58.758]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:15:58.758 --> 00:16:02.701]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:02.701 --> 00:16:04.222]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:04.222 --> 00:16:07.184]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:07.184 --> 00:16:12.388]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:12.748 --> 00:16:13.949]  I can help you, too.
[00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:16.871]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:16:16.871 --> 00:16:19.092]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:16:19.092 --> 00:16:23.535]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.
[00:16:23.535 --> 00:16:25.236]  That's DanPilla.com.
[00:16:25.236 --> 00:16:27.257]  DanPilla.com.
[00:16:27.257 --> 00:16:29.899]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[00:16:29.899 --> 00:16:38.264]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:16:38.424 --> 00:16:47.730]  Bill Hyde here, and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:53.014]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[00:16:53.014 --> 00:17:05.222]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[00:17:05.222 --> 00:17:06.483]  So here's what you should do right now.
[00:17:06.483 --> 00:17:08.404]  Check out the PPX microgrid system.
[00:17:08.484 --> 00:17:09.385]  We're good.
[00:17:26.676 --> 00:17:29.297]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[00:17:29.297 --> 00:17:30.397]  Get back to nature.

[00:17:58.246 --> 00:18:00.367]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:18:00.367 --> 00:18:01.527]  Alex, God bless you.
[00:18:01.527 --> 00:18:04.108]  I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt.
[00:18:04.108 --> 00:18:10.071]  Instead of, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[00:18:10.071 --> 00:18:10.751]  Ooh, yeah.
[00:18:10.751 --> 00:18:12.112]  Showing your brain getting fried.
[00:18:12.112 --> 00:18:13.972]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[00:18:13.972 --> 00:18:14.993]  Totally changed my life.
[00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:18.054]  I use TurboForce, BODY, AlphaPower, BrainForce.
[00:18:18.254 --> 00:18:18.374]  Yes.
[00:18:18.374 --> 00:18:21.638]  Fish oil, Ultra 12 daily, X2 every several days now.
[00:18:21.638 --> 00:18:29.347]  What I've found is really combining them is a totally synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products.
[00:18:29.347 --> 00:18:32.650]  And I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them, I just want to say why not?
[00:18:33.131 --> 00:18:35.893]  I like that all of these things are known to be incredible.
[00:18:35.893 --> 00:18:42.679]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil, or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force of the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[00:18:42.679 --> 00:18:45.201]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.
[00:18:45.201 --> 00:18:48.364]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation.
[00:18:48.364 --> 00:18:50.125]  Now you can build the big strong temple.
[00:18:50.125 --> 00:18:54.088]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better.
[00:18:54.088 --> 00:18:56.911]  And then it funds the information war, which is so critical.
[00:18:56.911 --> 00:18:57.691]  Thank you so much.
[00:18:57.691 --> 00:18:58.152]  God bless you.
[00:18:58.752 --> 00:19:04.916]  Super Mill Vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[00:19:04.916 --> 00:19:13.060]  It is an award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.341]  It is cold-pressed.
[00:19:14.341 --> 00:19:20.784]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild-crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[00:19:20.784 --> 00:19:21.965]  It's not boiled.
[00:19:21.965 --> 00:19:22.746]  It's not heated.
[00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:23.906]  It's never been dried.
[00:19:23.906 --> 00:19:25.067]  It's taken from fresh
[00:19:25.607 --> 00:19:26.407]  Herbs.
[00:19:26.407 --> 00:19:29.108]  That's why it's so strong.
[00:19:29.108 --> 00:19:32.889]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.
[00:19:32.889 --> 00:19:46.852]  And I'm so excited about Supramel Vitality and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with every order of Supramel Vitality at 25% off a free bottle of Carnivore Digestive Enzyme.
[00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:48.312]  We're going to sell out of this very quickly.
[00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:53.114]  But it's an offer so that you experience how amazing both these products are.
[00:19:53.114 --> 00:20:01.757]  Secure yours at InfoWarsStore.com today or InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:20:01.757 --> 00:20:06.119]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:14.703]  I used to shoot up my friends in the arms.
[00:20:19.724 --> 00:20:26.750]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide.
[00:20:35.914 --> 00:20:39.955]  On this Wednesday, September 4th, 2019, global transmission.
[00:20:39.955 --> 00:20:46.817]  We're reaching millions of people on AM and FM stations, TV stations, and of course our own streams at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:20:46.817 --> 00:20:48.278]  You know why?
[00:20:48.278 --> 00:20:50.558]  Because we've been banned off every platform.
[00:20:50.558 --> 00:20:55.040]  You can't even say my name or show Infowars.com in positive light.
[00:20:55.876 --> 00:21:01.921]  As of three months ago, on Facebook, you talk about incredible censorship, incredible authoritarianism.
[00:21:01.921 --> 00:21:04.382]  Well now, DrugsReport.com is top-linked.
[00:21:04.382 --> 00:21:06.184]  The big, giant link.
[00:21:06.184 --> 00:21:10.627]  Social credit score to determine who can buy a gun.
[00:21:10.627 --> 00:21:14.290]  President Trump, according to the Washington Post,
[00:21:16.027 --> 00:21:28.556]  Is saying that they want the devices, your Alexa from Amazon, your Google Assist, all the systems from Facebook to listen and watch you.
[00:21:28.556 --> 00:21:40.224]  And if you say something violent or dangerous, all of it sent back live time to DARPA and Big Tech with a new agency called HARPA with Health and Human Services.
[00:21:40.224 --> 00:21:44.448]  And then extra judicially, you will lose your guns under red flags.
[00:21:45.794 --> 00:21:47.616]  And or you can't buy a gun.
[00:21:47.616 --> 00:21:49.197]  And I said it when I started the broadcast.
[00:21:49.197 --> 00:21:53.021]  If Trump supports this, then he needs to be impeached.
[00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:55.423]  Violates the Fourth Amendment due process.
[00:21:55.423 --> 00:22:03.851]  The shooter in Florida last year, Mr. Cruz, threatened 44 times to kill people at the school.
[00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:05.192]  The police were called 44 times.
[00:22:05.192 --> 00:22:07.855]  The FBI twice.
[00:22:07.855 --> 00:22:08.736]  We had our early warnings.
[00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:16.234]  All these shooters wouldn't have been stopped with this, but what it is is the rollout of all the devices admittedly listening to everybody.
[00:22:16.234 --> 00:22:21.278]  And I'm going to go over all those articles for the rest of the hour with Paul Joseph Watson, who wrote the story.
[00:22:21.278 --> 00:22:24.180]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com, and this is a human action.
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.302]  If everybody can share that link and make this the biggest story in the world.
[00:22:29.741 --> 00:22:34.843]  And we can really have a debate about this, because you ever wondered how they're going to roll out the fact they're listening to all of us?
[00:22:34.843 --> 00:22:38.284]  The privatization of NSA spy grid, making Orwell blush.
[00:22:38.284 --> 00:22:40.064]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is it.
[00:22:40.064 --> 00:22:41.265]  You opt in.
[00:22:41.265 --> 00:22:41.905]  They do this.
[00:22:41.905 --> 00:22:44.926]  And, well, let's be clear, Paul.
[00:22:44.926 --> 00:22:48.807]  They say Trump is starting to support this.
[00:22:48.807 --> 00:22:49.987]  I have the quotes here.
[00:22:49.987 --> 00:22:52.528]  And then, obviously, they say Ivanka is pushing this.
[00:22:52.528 --> 00:22:55.129]  And the guy proposing it is one of Trump's best friends.
[00:22:56.331 --> 00:22:57.973]  Of course he's just the front guy for DARPA.
[00:22:57.973 --> 00:22:58.894]  They admit that.
[00:22:58.894 --> 00:23:00.877]  So that's why this is so dangerous.
[00:23:00.877 --> 00:23:03.700]  And I think Trump is giving it ear.
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.762]  This is the total Big Brother acceptance.
[00:23:05.762 --> 00:23:08.386]  This is the AI surveillance grid takeover.
[00:23:08.386 --> 00:23:10.108]  This is the global social score.
[00:23:10.108 --> 00:23:11.830]  This is the end of due process.
[00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.152]  This is... I mean I've got to think that...
[00:23:14.713 --> 00:23:19.837]  The Washington Post is engaged in deception, but regardless, I don't want to hate Ivanka Trump or Jared Kushner.
[00:23:19.837 --> 00:23:21.838]  Everybody keeps saying they're in bed with Google.
[00:23:21.838 --> 00:23:23.339]  Well, Google's proposing this.
[00:23:23.339 --> 00:23:24.620]  Apple's proposing this.
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:28.022]  Tim Cook goes out to dinner with Kushner and Ivanka.
[00:23:28.022 --> 00:23:39.310]  So all I can say is, hey guys, I don't want to live in Brave New World meets THX1138 meets Gattaca meets a nightmare system, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.450]  This is an incredible moment in 2019.
[00:23:43.166 --> 00:23:50.896]  Well exactly Alex, and it goes back to 2006, literally 13 years ago when we came out with the first big report.
[00:23:50.896 --> 00:23:55.583]  Government industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million Americans.
[00:23:55.583 --> 00:23:59.148]  That was an article that we put out September 2006, almost to the day!
[00:24:01.451 --> 00:24:04.893]  It was September 6th, predicting everything that would happen.
[00:24:04.893 --> 00:24:24.001]  Of course, in 2013, just before the rollout of Google Home, Amazon Echo and Alexa, these Home Hub devices that listen to your conversations and basically surveil your entire existence to help you with, you know, telling you what food you should buy and how to get to work the best route possible and stuff like that.
[00:24:24.727 --> 00:24:34.133]  Right as they were releasing those, or like a year before, Google engineering director Scott Hoffman came out and said that it was eventually designed to be a chip in your brain.
[00:24:34.133 --> 00:24:51.063]  He literally put out in an article for the London Independent, December 2013, which we reported on as well, full of conspiracy theorists at the time for doing so, no doubt, quote, Google believes it can ultimately fulfill people's data needs by sending results directly to microchips implanted in its users' brains.
[00:24:51.598 --> 00:25:06.123]  Now, of course, not everyone's going to accept an implant in their brain, Alex, so they're probably going to, you know, make it a little tattoo that you can get on your wrist, make it cool, make it trendy, make the early adopters encourage the rest of the sheep to get branded with this technology.
[00:25:06.123 --> 00:25:13.745]  And it brings it up to today, Alex, where we've got this Harper proposal by the Trump administration being reported on by the Washington Post.
[00:25:14.315 --> 00:25:21.057]  Where they want to catch early diagnosis of neuropsychiatric violence, how are they going to do it?
[00:25:21.057 --> 00:25:30.699]  By measuring your physiological levels, your biological levels via Apple Watches, Fitbits, Amazon Echo and Google Home.
[00:25:30.699 --> 00:25:31.779]  How are they going to do that?
[00:25:31.779 --> 00:25:40.762]  They're going to measure the aggression, the anger in your voice, because as we know, these home pub surveillance devices record conversations.
[00:25:40.762 --> 00:25:42.422]  I pulled up this headline, Alex, from
[00:25:43.473 --> 00:25:46.515]  October last year, where they'd already prepared this.
[00:25:46.515 --> 00:25:51.018]  Amazon wants Alexa to detect when you are sick and sell you meds.
[00:25:51.018 --> 00:26:05.347]  They put out they've got the patent already, which says the upgrades would allow Alexa to detect abnormal physical conditions, such as sore throats and coughs, and even psychological ones, such as an excited emotional state or a sad emotional state.
[00:26:05.347 --> 00:26:07.968]  So they've already got the patent for the technology.
[00:26:07.968 --> 00:26:10.470]  Now, Javanka, the globalist of the Alliance,
[00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:27.665]  He's saying that this could be used to prevent Americans from buying guns because those surveillance devices could detect anger, could detect a slippery step down to a level of resentment where people are too angry, too hyper to be able to buy guns.
[00:26:27.665 --> 00:26:28.326]  This is frightening.
[00:26:29.026 --> 00:26:31.127]  Paul, I want people to pull back and understand.
[00:26:31.127 --> 00:26:40.951]  I'm going to show people later in the last segment of this hour, when you're with me, the actual original MIT documents where they laid all this out right on the timeline.
[00:26:40.951 --> 00:26:42.932]  They're following it exactly.
[00:26:42.932 --> 00:26:44.052]  It sounds like science fiction.
[00:26:44.052 --> 00:26:44.672]  We're in the year 2019.
[00:26:46.053 --> 00:27:00.842]  They are admitting that everything you do, your interactions with your children, your interactions with your mate, your significant other, everything, and then there's no judge, no jury, it's all psychiatrists and bureaucrats and SJWs, in big tech, interfacing with U.S.
[00:27:00.842 --> 00:27:06.166]  intelligence, that will just claim you're violent or you're bad and pre-crime and disappear you.
[00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:08.747]  This is beyond Minority Report.
[00:27:08.747 --> 00:27:11.829]  This is beyond any novel, any movie.
[00:27:11.829 --> 00:27:14.731]  Because truth is stranger than fiction, this is just
[00:27:15.271 --> 00:27:17.613]  So tyrannical.
[00:27:17.613 --> 00:27:18.253]  Out of the gates.
[00:27:18.253 --> 00:27:22.997]  And then to know, because it's in the Washington Post, Ivanka Trump admits she's pushing this.
[00:27:22.997 --> 00:27:25.619]  So, I'm sorry, Ivanka Trump.
[00:27:25.619 --> 00:27:26.980]  This is the whole architecture.
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.781]  It's always been meant to do this.
[00:27:28.781 --> 00:27:29.722]  Now it's here.
[00:27:29.722 --> 00:27:32.464]  We've got to form a global debate and say no to this.
[00:27:34.281 --> 00:27:36.322]  Precisely, because we know where it's going, Alex.
[00:27:36.322 --> 00:27:47.771]  In China, the government just cracked that they've restricted 2.5 million people in the month of July alone from buying plane tickets because they had bad social credit scores.
[00:27:47.771 --> 00:27:52.354]  You've got all these apologists out in the Western media saying, oh, it's just to ensure good behaviour.
[00:27:52.944 --> 00:28:02.226]  Literally 2.5 million people plus 90,000 people in China cannot travel, cannot buy plane or train tickets because of what?
[00:28:02.226 --> 00:28:03.546]  Well, here's the list.
[00:28:03.546 --> 00:28:12.448]  Bad driving, smoking on trains, buying too many video games, buying too much junk food, buying too much alcohol, calling a friend who has a low credit score.
[00:28:12.448 --> 00:28:15.649]  So if you're friends with someone who misbehaves, that impacts you.
[00:28:16.329 --> 00:28:17.549]  Posting fake news.
[00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:18.409]  What is fake news?
[00:28:18.409 --> 00:28:20.650]  Anything that disagrees with the mainstream media.
[00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:21.630]  Criticizing the government.
[00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:23.390]  Visiting unauthorized websites.
[00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:24.971]  Walking your dog without leash.
[00:28:24.971 --> 00:28:26.971]  Letting your dog bark too much.
[00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:32.252]  They even talk about preventing people and have prevented people in China from using dating websites.
[00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:35.653]  Literally micromanagement of every facet of your life.
[00:28:35.653 --> 00:28:37.553]  And it's in place now!
[00:28:37.553 --> 00:28:39.453]  1.4 billion people are already under it.
[00:28:39.453 --> 00:28:40.554]  Our tech giant's built it.
[00:28:40.554 --> 00:28:41.194]  It's coming here.
[00:28:41.194 --> 00:28:41.994]  And who's resisting it?
[00:28:42.714 --> 00:28:48.039]  Matt Grudge, Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson, the American people.
[00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:48.900]  Wow!
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.122]  This isn't a science fiction movie, folks.
[00:28:51.122 --> 00:28:52.003]  You're in it.
[00:28:52.003 --> 00:28:52.163]  It's 2019.

[00:29:04.871 --> 00:29:06.451]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:06.451 --> 00:29:14.795]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:14.795 --> 00:29:20.497]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[00:31:04.713 --> 00:31:12.856]  It is an award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[00:31:12.856 --> 00:31:14.137]  It is cold-pressed.
[00:31:14.137 --> 00:31:20.580]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild-crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.760]  It's not boiled.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.541]  It's not heated.
[00:31:22.541 --> 00:31:23.701]  It's never been dried.
[00:31:23.701 --> 00:31:24.882]  It's taken from fresh
[00:31:25.402 --> 00:31:26.222]  Herbs.
[00:31:26.222 --> 00:31:28.923]  That's why it's so strong.

[00:31:58.157 --> 00:32:02.520]  Banned.video is the answer to censorship.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:17.530]  Banned.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are still available.
[00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:19.731]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:19.731 --> 00:32:21.072]  It's now live.
[00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:23.033]  Band.Video.
[00:32:23.033 --> 00:32:30.358]  Band.Video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones, or David Knight, or Owen Schroer, or Paul Watson band videos.
[00:32:30.358 --> 00:32:47.870]  We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted, and where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chi-coms, the Hollywood scum, and the globalists.
[00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:50.433]  Freedom of speech has a home.
[00:32:50.433 --> 00:32:52.957]  It's called Banned.Video.
[00:32:52.957 --> 00:33:01.268]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at Banned.Video.
[00:33:01.268 --> 00:33:03.951]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:17.386 --> 00:33:18.627]  You know, those are air raid sirens.
[00:33:18.627 --> 00:33:19.768]  You're birthright.
[00:33:19.768 --> 00:33:21.289]  You're freedom.
[00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:22.430]  Everything's being stolen.
[00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:31.717]  And the big pharma medical combine that forces all these tainted vaccines on us and all this GMO garbage and all the fluoride to lower our IQs on record.
[00:33:31.717 --> 00:33:37.482]  They give us all the glyphosates so our wives and daughters and grandmothers all get breast cancer and get chopped up.
[00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:39.684]  That's up multi-thousand percentage points.
[00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:43.927]  These same people don't want you to be able to question any of this with their medical tyranny.
[00:33:43.927 --> 00:33:44.668]  And so a year ago,
[00:33:45.996 --> 00:33:53.060]  Amazon and Alexa came out and said we want to be involved in your medical life and Alexa is going to be watching you and listening to you and calling the police on you.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.241]  They're all doing it.
[00:33:54.241 --> 00:33:56.502]  It's been the plan since the beginning.
[00:33:56.502 --> 00:33:59.604]  I'm going to show you all the documents next hour and some next segment.
[00:33:59.604 --> 00:34:11.711]  We're going back to Paul Watson in a moment, but here's a piece where we spliced George Lucas's THX 1138 dystopia film in with the reality of Alexa.
[00:34:11.711 --> 00:34:12.071]  Here it is.
[00:34:12.793 --> 00:34:14.997]  You have asked, are we happy?
[00:34:14.997 --> 00:34:17.642]  Are we happy and effective?
[00:34:17.642 --> 00:34:21.348]  Consultation with leading experts in the field makes it perfectly clear
[00:34:25.971 --> 00:34:29.414]  That we are all now programmed for perfect happiness.
[00:34:29.414 --> 00:34:30.995]  Perfect happiness.
[00:34:30.995 --> 00:34:32.557]  Perfect happiness.
[00:34:32.557 --> 00:34:33.958]  Perfect happiness.
[00:34:33.958 --> 00:34:34.658]  What's wrong?
[00:34:34.658 --> 00:34:36.280]  Nothing, nothing really.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.241]  I just feel that I need something stronger.
[00:34:38.241 --> 00:34:41.504]  If you have a problem, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
[00:34:41.504 --> 00:34:42.445]  Yes, thank you.
[00:34:42.445 --> 00:34:43.346]  I'll be alright.
[00:34:43.346 --> 00:34:46.649]  Call 3485... We are sorry, but we must deny your request.
[00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:53.233]  Birthborns are not allowed more than five units of Entervol.
[00:34:53.233 --> 00:35:00.618]  Remember, substitution of Entervol for Etrazine may cause a serious chemical imbalance.
[00:35:00.618 --> 00:35:01.959]  Thank you.
[00:35:01.959 --> 00:35:03.020]  Work hard.
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.541]  What's wrong?
[00:35:04.541 --> 00:35:06.302]  Increase production.
[00:35:06.302 --> 00:35:07.923]  What's wrong?
[00:35:07.923 --> 00:35:09.924]  Prevent accidents.
[00:35:09.924 --> 00:35:10.845]  What's wrong?
[00:35:17.387 --> 00:35:18.727]  What's wrong?
[00:35:18.727 --> 00:35:24.490]  If you feel you are not properly sedated, call 348-844-IMMEDIATELY.
[00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:29.753]  Failure to do so may result in prosecution for criminal drug use.
[00:35:42.378 --> 00:35:51.800]  So, I'm going to tell this story next hour, and I want to get my dad in here sometime, because he was like top of his class, and it wasn't even a big secret when he went to UT Plan 2.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:36:03.923]  That's when you're in high school, like a junior, and they were there in the botany department, the science department, and they go, here's the secret nuclear reactor nobody knows about, and we're running worldwide eugenics, and you're going to be the chosen kids.
[00:36:03.923 --> 00:36:05.043]  There's only like six in his group.
[00:36:06.284 --> 00:36:09.945]  And he ended up going to UT and the rest of it, but they had CD-ROM back then.
[00:36:09.945 --> 00:36:14.767]  They were talking about social media in the future and everyone will be wired in and controlled.
[00:36:14.767 --> 00:36:20.209]  And my dad wrote a paper that got basically put into the government and looked at and adopted in some ways.
[00:36:20.209 --> 00:36:26.511]  And sometime, I might give him, he's got a copy of the paper to let me republish it because it's never been published or seen.
[00:36:26.511 --> 00:36:28.272]  But it was information energy.
[00:36:28.772 --> 00:36:40.334]  And how you could basically have fiat currency in the future just off what they were calling social media and how people would basically pay for that and be paid in the new fiat system.
[00:36:40.334 --> 00:36:45.815]  Kind of the casino gulag system that decades later Max Keiser talked about.
[00:36:45.815 --> 00:36:53.637]  So they were all brainstorming about this even with the younger people wanting to get their ideas for building the thing they built.
[00:36:53.637 --> 00:36:55.797]  So this is the whole world project.
[00:36:56.377 --> 00:36:57.398]  This is the future.
[00:36:57.398 --> 00:36:58.438]  This is the system.
[00:36:58.438 --> 00:37:01.740]  And notice there's been no discussion, no debate about it, because you're not supposed to know about that.
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:17.990]  You're supposed to watch football and watch movies and, you know, do whatever you do and that's fine, while they're building the system that is anti-human and will surveil everything you do and turn over to big tech and this psychiatric elite, who they admit is going to run this, everything you do and all your records for your own good.
[00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:20.171]  Paul, please continue.
[00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:24.876]  Your story, again, is top-linked at DrugsReport.com, the big, giant top link.
[00:37:24.876 --> 00:37:26.597]  And our live feed is there.
[00:37:26.597 --> 00:37:34.864]  If listeners and viewers watching this share this on your email, your Facebook, your Twitter, your YouTube, your word of mouth, it will cause a chain reaction.
[00:37:34.864 --> 00:37:41.390]  Usually, when we get linked on drugs like this, we get a couple hundred thousand to a million people tuning in when he has a small link.
[00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:42.191]  But when he linked
[00:37:43.416 --> 00:37:54.863]  A year ago, whenever they lied and said that I said no one died at Parkland, banned me on YouTube, I re-uploaded the video showing, I said the police stood down, the video got, it was two videos, 14 million views.
[00:37:54.863 --> 00:38:10.472]  So, if we could get 14 million extra people watching this, if you decide to share the link from DrugsReport.com, folks, that will really reach a lot of new people, which horrifies Big Tech, which they work around the clock to make sure, as this system goes from beta to live,
[00:38:11.192 --> 00:38:19.738]  As it goes from test to the true AI total surveillance rollout of a system of psychiatric controllers.
[00:38:19.738 --> 00:38:21.839]  You watch THX 1138.
[00:38:21.839 --> 00:38:28.243]  Why did a graduate student make a student version and then his first film was about this?
[00:38:28.243 --> 00:38:29.444]  Well, George Lucas has talked about it.
[00:38:29.444 --> 00:38:33.546]  They were teaching him that in his advanced film school.
[00:38:33.546 --> 00:38:34.427]  That this is the future.
[00:38:34.427 --> 00:38:40.331]  Psychiatrists through computer terminals will run everyone's lives and watch everyone and drug everyone.
[00:38:41.015 --> 00:38:42.756]  And we're almost there, aren't we?
[00:38:42.756 --> 00:38:44.418]  We're almost there, aren't we?
[00:38:44.418 --> 00:38:47.600]  So see, my dad was learning that at UT when he was 16.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:53.665]  George Lucas was learning it as well when he was 18, 19.
[00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:58.589]  So that's why you keep seeing this in art, because it's the plan.
[00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:59.890]  It's the plan.
[00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:03.673]  And now the plan's all admitted, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:39:05.458 --> 00:39:12.801]  Well, the reason this was ignored for years, Alex, is because people did not care about being spied on, because they thought, oh, what's the worst that could happen?
[00:39:12.801 --> 00:39:18.263]  You know, I get some ads in my email, or I get some ads splash up on the television for products that I might be interested in.
[00:39:18.263 --> 00:39:20.984]  No, this is about punishment, OK?
[00:39:20.984 --> 00:39:26.647]  They already have a system called Patron Scan, where if you walk into a bar, they scan your ID.
[00:39:26.647 --> 00:39:28.187]  It's linked to a database.
[00:39:28.187 --> 00:39:34.450]  And then if you've got anything on that database that somebody has deemed, you know, harmful or suspicious, you don't get into the bar.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:39.842]  Life insurance companies are basing premiums now on social media posts.
[00:39:39.842 --> 00:39:51.288]  People are being banned by Uber, Airbnb, PayPal, which has taken over a bunch of credit card companies, by the way, as Facebook is taking over the cryptocurrencies, for their political opinions.
[00:39:51.288 --> 00:39:54.510]  This isn't about corporations just gathering data and selling off.
[00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:58.973]  Yes, partly that, but this is about reward and punishment.
[00:39:58.973 --> 00:40:08.400]  We reported back in 2012, Samsung Smart Televisions spying on people, recording their conversations, uploading them to an internet server.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.321]  Who cares?
[00:40:09.321 --> 00:40:11.883]  They just get your data, they sell you products.
[00:40:11.883 --> 00:40:15.786]  Well then it came out in 2017, Wikileaks Vault 7.
[00:40:15.786 --> 00:40:23.031]  The CIA had a program called Weeping Angel, where they had exploited that vulnerability to hack into the televisions,
[00:40:23.451 --> 00:40:28.092]  And to record your conversations, and even to take computer snapshots.
[00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:45.336]  So it's not just corporations doing it, it's the government, it's the deep state, and the idea that these home devices, Alex, Amazon Echo, Google Home, etc., just capture a snapshot of your conversation, like a few seconds before and after, so they can pick out the keyword, is complete nonsense.
[00:40:45.336 --> 00:40:46.316]  Because last year,
[00:40:46.856 --> 00:40:55.323]  A New Hampshire judge ordered Amazon to turn over two days of Amazon Echo recordings in a double murder case.
[00:40:55.323 --> 00:40:58.125]  Why does Amazon have two days of recordings?
[00:40:58.125 --> 00:41:00.386]  Because they're recording all the time!
[00:41:00.386 --> 00:41:08.192]  Yeah, they claim, oh, we just pick up a few seconds and then there's the keyword, Alexa, what's this, what's that?
[00:41:08.192 --> 00:41:12.736]  No, they had two days of recordings of people's private conversations.
[00:41:12.736 --> 00:41:14.137]  A judge called for a subpoena.
[00:41:14.867 --> 00:41:32.652]  And where this is all going, Alex, as you know, as you've explained many times, this is going to the digital tattoo, the microchip, the two-cast society whereby a lot of people will not accept this, they will not go along with it, they will refuse to upload their brains to computers like breakers, well, all the futurists want to do.
[00:41:33.294 --> 00:41:37.096]  And they will be treated as second-class, third-class citizens.
[00:41:37.096 --> 00:41:43.460]  They won't get the computer cybernetic interface which basically turns you into a superhuman.
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:49.384]  And in comparison to that elite that do get access to that, you'll basically be an amoeba.
[00:41:49.384 --> 00:41:50.965]  He said it himself, Alex.
[00:41:50.965 --> 00:41:53.266]  Age of Spiritual Machines, 1999.
[00:41:53.266 --> 00:41:54.047]  Quote.
[00:41:54.047 --> 00:42:01.211]  Humans who do not utilize such implants are unable to meaningly participate in dialogues with those who do.
[00:42:01.929 --> 00:42:08.313]  He cites the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, Ray Kurzweil does, who predicted this as well.
[00:42:08.313 --> 00:42:10.535]  So they actually cite... And Paul, let's stop right there.
[00:42:10.535 --> 00:42:11.756]  Paul, let's stop right there.
[00:42:11.756 --> 00:42:12.956]  We've got to go to break.
[00:42:12.956 --> 00:42:15.038]  This isn't just you picking Ray Kurzweil.
[00:42:15.038 --> 00:42:16.559]  It's the cover of NBC last week.
[00:42:16.559 --> 00:42:17.720]  It's all of them.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.720]  It's a cult.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.442]  They've decided it's the post-human world.
[00:42:21.442 --> 00:42:25.485]  They're the transhumanists and they're going to save the Earth by depopulating us.
[00:42:25.485 --> 00:42:30.168]  That's why they said in NBC last week, humans by this generation will be extinct.
[00:42:30.168 --> 00:42:31.529]  It will be the rise of the cyborgs.
[00:42:32.189 --> 00:42:34.772]  This is beyond Hitler saying I'll rule the world for a thousand years.
[00:42:34.772 --> 00:42:44.020]  This is these crazy technocrats who envisioned this, built it, launched it, and now we're going into the predatory operational mop-up phase.
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:44.981]  This is hellish.
[00:42:44.981 --> 00:42:48.724]  Once the technocracy's in place, they intend to release bio-weapons.
[00:42:48.724 --> 00:42:51.967]  They intend to release mass mobs using social media.
[00:42:51.967 --> 00:42:55.991]  They intend to bring down civilization except for their breakaway citadels.
[00:42:58.394 --> 00:43:03.597]  It's been a year since InfoWars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[00:43:03.597 --> 00:43:11.522]  We had over 5 billion views when we got banned and we're credited with getting Donald Trump elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[00:43:11.522 --> 00:43:19.507]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable to block the signal.
[00:43:19.507 --> 00:43:20.547]  And it's now here.
[00:43:20.547 --> 00:43:21.728]  Banned.Video.
[00:43:22.288 --> 00:43:36.883]  Banned.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are still available.
[00:43:36.883 --> 00:43:37.804]  Watch your favorite content
[00:43:38.024 --> 00:43:38.364]  We're good.
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:00.843]  I apologize for what some weird Summit.News and Action7 News were here in Hong Kong.
[00:44:00.843 --> 00:44:03.365]  This is Savannah Hernandez for InfoWars.com.
[00:44:03.365 --> 00:44:07.369]  I'm reporting to you from Hong Kong where I'm joined by reporter Greg Rees for the next week.
[00:44:07.369 --> 00:44:10.191]  This is Greg Rees for InfoWars.com in Hong Kong.
[00:44:10.191 --> 00:44:14.114]  Our recent trip to Hong Kong was a new achievement for InfoWars.com.
[00:44:15.055 --> 00:44:23.098]  Despite being the most banned broadcast in the free world, we continue to win because of our great, strong, loyal audience.
[00:44:23.098 --> 00:44:39.623]  We have Dan Lyman covering InfoWars Europe, Paul Joseph Watson in the UK, Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett in the American heartland, and from Austin, Texas, a team of reporters and crew ready to be dispatched wherever the story is going down.
[00:44:39.623 --> 00:44:43.325]  We are not done winning, and with your support, we will keep winning.
[00:44:43.325 --> 00:44:44.465]  We have to keep winning!
[00:44:44.765 --> 00:44:46.206]  We have to win more!
[00:44:46.206 --> 00:44:48.588]  Go to InfoWarStore.com.
[00:44:48.588 --> 00:44:56.713]  You have gone to InfoWarStore.com and gotten books and films, supplements and t-shirts, and water filtration, air filtration, and things you need!
[00:44:58.539 --> 00:45:04.681]  Super Mel Vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[00:45:04.681 --> 00:45:12.844]  It is a award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[00:45:12.844 --> 00:45:14.104]  It is cold pressed.
[00:45:14.104 --> 00:45:20.546]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[00:45:20.546 --> 00:45:21.727]  It's not boiled.
[00:45:21.727 --> 00:45:22.507]  It's not heated.
[00:45:22.507 --> 00:45:23.688]  It's never been dried.
[00:45:23.688 --> 00:45:24.848]  It's taken from fresh
[00:45:25.388 --> 00:45:26.189]  Herbs.
[00:45:26.189 --> 00:45:28.892]  That's why it's so strong.
[00:45:28.892 --> 00:45:32.675]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.
[00:45:32.675 --> 00:45:46.648]  And I'm so excited about Supramel Vitality and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with every order of Supramel Vitality a 25% off a free bottle of Carnivore Digestive Enzyme.
[00:45:46.648 --> 00:45:48.090]  We're going to sell out of this very quickly.
[00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:52.899]  But it's an offer so that you experience how amazing both these products are.
[00:45:52.899 --> 00:45:57.529]  Secure yours at InfoWarsStore.com today or InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:45:59.341 --> 00:46:00.542]  You've had this in for two weeks.
[00:46:00.542 --> 00:46:03.904]  I've been so busy, I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[00:46:03.904 --> 00:46:05.145]  But it's very exciting.
[00:46:05.145 --> 00:46:07.487]  It's Super Silver Skin Cream.
[00:46:07.487 --> 00:46:08.988]  It's got all of these benefits.
[00:46:08.988 --> 00:46:10.069]  Too many to mention.
[00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:11.350]  But it's revolutionary.
[00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:12.291]  It's brand new.
[00:46:12.291 --> 00:46:13.071]  People are going to love it.
[00:46:13.071 --> 00:46:15.273]  Introducing the new Super Silver Skin Cream.
[00:46:15.273 --> 00:46:16.894]  Exclusively at infomorestore.com.
[00:46:16.894 --> 00:46:18.175]  25% off introductory price.
[00:46:18.175 --> 00:46:20.857]  The new Super Silver Skin Cream is the best of both worlds.
[00:46:20.857 --> 00:46:23.099]  It helps reduce wrinkles and keep your skin healthy.
[00:46:23.099 --> 00:46:24.900]  Super Silver Skin Cream is infused with
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.841]  Patented silver salt technology.
[00:46:26.841 --> 00:46:31.984]  It's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.
[00:46:31.984 --> 00:46:43.092]  It's also loaded with the best natural ingredients for your skin like coconut oil, vitamin E. Unlike most skin creams, Super Silver Skin Cream is free of BPA, parabens, harsh preservatives, and sulfates.
[00:46:43.092 --> 00:46:45.113]  It's got the highly sought after hyaluronic
[00:46:45.373 --> 00:46:47.635]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:17.725 --> 00:47:18.986]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:18.986 --> 00:47:20.028]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:47:20.028 --> 00:47:22.370]  Paul Joseph Watson of Summit.News.
[00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:26.255]  He also does great work at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:47:26.255 --> 00:47:34.825]  Remember, the only way this critical pro-human, pro-freedom information gets out to try to shape the future in a good way, not in a dystopic,
[00:47:36.325 --> 00:47:46.267]  The technocracy wave is when you speak out, and is when you by hand share the live feed at InfoWars.com, Ford's live show, or like Drudge is doing.
[00:47:46.267 --> 00:47:48.048]  Top story on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:47:48.048 --> 00:47:49.688]  That's the top link on the internet.
[00:47:49.688 --> 00:47:50.548]  No one disputes that.
[00:47:50.548 --> 00:47:52.189]  Second largest website in the world.
[00:47:52.189 --> 00:47:53.989]  Largest news site in the world.
[00:47:53.989 --> 00:47:54.789]  There it is.
[00:47:54.789 --> 00:47:58.430]  Social credit score to determine who can buy a gun.
[00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:05.272]  Amazon, Echo, and Apple watch would flag neuropsychiatric violence.
[00:48:06.943 --> 00:48:09.885]  That means when your brain is showing wavelengths of violence.
[00:48:09.885 --> 00:48:13.388]  I mean, they proved that lie detectors were a fraud 50 years ago.
[00:48:13.388 --> 00:48:17.111]  Sent a lot of folks to death row in the gas chamber.
[00:48:17.111 --> 00:48:18.352]  And lethal injection.
[00:48:18.352 --> 00:48:22.055]  But now they've got, oh, big tech says, the algorithm says.
[00:48:22.055 --> 00:48:24.897]  Well, they already say Trump's mentally ill.
[00:48:24.897 --> 00:48:26.459]  Red flag laws would take his guns.
[00:48:26.459 --> 00:48:30.182]  They already violate the law.
[00:48:30.182 --> 00:48:31.303]  They already violate the regulations.
[00:48:31.303 --> 00:48:33.885]  They already violate the psychiatric board rules.
[00:48:33.885 --> 00:48:35.286]  Violating the cold water.
[00:48:37.216 --> 00:48:38.117]  Rule.
[00:48:38.117 --> 00:48:39.557]  And they diagnosed him from afar!
[00:48:39.557 --> 00:48:45.181]  They've had psychology today, diagnosed me, and make up all this crap.
[00:48:45.181 --> 00:48:48.543]  Psychology didn't start until Germany, like 150 years ago.
[00:48:48.543 --> 00:48:52.205]  It's just a way to look at how people operate in the world and put labels on it.
[00:48:52.205 --> 00:48:54.847]  And a lot of it you could say is true, but a lot of it isn't.
[00:48:54.847 --> 00:48:59.870]  And it was used in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany to oppress people, and it's used in China to oppress people.
[00:49:00.575 --> 00:49:04.938]  But look at Hong Kong, pulling down the face-scanning cameras, fighting back.
[00:49:04.938 --> 00:49:06.659]  That's an example to us all.
[00:49:06.659 --> 00:49:10.341]  The story's up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com right now.
[00:49:10.341 --> 00:49:16.385]  They've withdrawn the bill in Hong Kong to secretly arrest and disappear people.
[00:49:16.385 --> 00:49:19.066]  Let me show you that article.
[00:49:19.066 --> 00:49:21.288]  Dr. McCabe, shot please.
[00:49:21.288 --> 00:49:26.871]  Hong Kong leader withdrawing incendiary extradition bill.
[00:49:26.871 --> 00:49:29.673]  Bill's introduction sparked massive protest.
[00:49:30.683 --> 00:49:32.904]  And so, you see the power of taking action.
[00:49:32.904 --> 00:49:34.665]  There's 7.5 billion of us.
[00:49:34.665 --> 00:49:35.665]  I'm not against technology.
[00:49:35.665 --> 00:49:38.586]  They always say, oh, people are troglodytes.
[00:49:38.586 --> 00:49:39.027]  They're against it.
[00:49:39.027 --> 00:49:40.087]  No, no, no.
[00:49:40.087 --> 00:49:40.647]  No, no.
[00:49:40.647 --> 00:49:41.668]  I'm not against a rifle.
[00:49:41.668 --> 00:49:43.048]  I'm not going to put it in my mouth and pull the trigger.
[00:49:43.048 --> 00:49:43.689]  That's technology.
[00:49:43.689 --> 00:49:45.910]  I'm not against a phone, but it's not really a phone.
[00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:48.751]  It's a tracking and surveillance system.
[00:49:48.751 --> 00:49:55.294]  And by the way, the answer to this is just a mitigating factor if you're not going to get rid of the so-called smartphones that are really little digital minders.
[00:49:56.363 --> 00:50:02.125]  It's the phones that do it all, but they know that you expect privacy on it, so they never announce it's listening to you.
[00:50:02.125 --> 00:50:04.305]  It's the worst device.
[00:50:04.305 --> 00:50:16.389]  But you opt in with the Alexa and the Google Assist and all these, and so psychologically you're used to talking to it, and so they're telling you, oh, we are listening to you for your own good, but it's okay.
[00:50:16.389 --> 00:50:22.871]  And they don't want you to really talk about this until it's ubiquitous, but now it's being exposed, so oh, we'll stop the mass shootings with it!
[00:50:24.437 --> 00:50:27.921]  Think about how out of control and how incredibly dangerous that is.
[00:50:27.921 --> 00:50:29.222]  We're going back to Paul Watson in a moment.
[00:50:29.222 --> 00:50:35.209]  But please remember, the system, the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, is publicly, her law firms,
[00:50:36.465 --> 00:50:39.788]  She financed over 30 lawsuits against Infowars when she lost.
[00:50:39.788 --> 00:50:44.612]  We've gotten over 30 of them thrown out, and we're beginning to win on appeals and many other places.
[00:50:44.612 --> 00:50:48.215]  You never see that in the news, but it's cost millions of dollars.
[00:50:48.215 --> 00:50:50.637]  We've got great products you already need.
[00:50:50.637 --> 00:50:54.180]  So please go to infowarsstore.com and get a Molon Labe t-shirt.
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.562]  Get a Gadsden flag t-shirt.
[00:50:56.562 --> 00:51:03.008]  Go and get some of the great supplements that they've got huge articles out demonizing.
[00:51:03.008 --> 00:51:03.528]  Here's an article.
[00:51:04.349 --> 00:51:17.138]  Right Brain, the New Republic, myself and Ben Shapiro basically say we shouldn't be allowed to sell nootropics that Amazon sells and everybody else sells.
[00:51:17.138 --> 00:51:23.423]  Of course, they're best sellers because he's the guy that admits, wow, this stuff really woke me up and was clean energy and was much better than coffee.
[00:51:23.423 --> 00:51:25.044]  They even admit in the article it works great.
[00:51:26.226 --> 00:51:28.248]  But the FDA needs to shut us down.
[00:51:28.248 --> 00:51:29.969]  Incredible information on that front.
[00:51:29.969 --> 00:51:37.435]  So get TurboForce, ladies and gentlemen, which is the best nootropic out there you're going to find.
[00:51:37.435 --> 00:51:39.416]  The packets are incredibly strong.
[00:51:39.416 --> 00:51:43.620]  10-hour clean energy focus with all the minerals and amino acids.
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.161]  So it's a pre-workout, a post-workout.
[00:51:45.161 --> 00:51:48.904]  It's good for truck drivers, good for doctors, good for lawyers, good for school teachers.
[00:51:50.393 --> 00:51:52.194]  Good for factory workers, it's amazing.
[00:51:52.194 --> 00:51:54.975]  TurboForce, I went out and got the top firm in the country.
[00:51:54.975 --> 00:52:01.518]  I had to pay them a bunch of money to give us the ultimate formula, better than what they were putting out, but they didn't want to put the money into it.
[00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:02.758]  So I gotta tell you, it's amazing.
[00:52:02.758 --> 00:52:06.300]  Get a very low price for it, for what you get in all these packets that come with it.
[00:52:07.082 --> 00:52:08.203]  And it blows away the competition.
[00:52:08.203 --> 00:52:10.065]  You have Brain Force Plus that goes with it.
[00:52:10.065 --> 00:52:11.005]  An amazing nootropic.
[00:52:11.005 --> 00:52:15.449]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:52:15.449 --> 00:52:19.493]  And again, that's how we fund this operation.
[00:52:19.493 --> 00:52:22.055]  We've also launched Band.Video this week.
[00:52:22.535 --> 00:52:38.563]  Band.video has Paul Watson, David Knight, Owen Schroer, myself on it, but we're going to be adding other contributors to it, where you can have your own video, your own postings, and it won't be censored like Google and, you know, YouTube and Facebook and Twitter.
[00:52:38.563 --> 00:52:41.584]  We're also promoting the great folks at memeworld.com.
[00:52:41.584 --> 00:52:43.825]  So again, be sure and check out band.video.
[00:52:43.825 --> 00:52:47.647]  Bookmark it, and then hand-share it, circumventing the censors.
[00:52:47.647 --> 00:52:51.609]  Paul, the magnitude of this, recapping what's happened, getting into Trump.
[00:52:52.998 --> 00:52:55.261]  You know, you get big brownie points if you attack Trump.
[00:52:55.261 --> 00:52:58.386]  I haven't really done it, you haven't really done it, because the alternative is Hillary and the Democrats.
[00:52:58.386 --> 00:53:06.697]  But, the red flag stuff, extrajudicial, killing Fourth Amendment, killing due process, wouldn't have stopped any of these mass shootings.
[00:53:06.697 --> 00:53:09.641]  These people all said they were going to kill people, most of them are Antifa.
[00:53:11.486 --> 00:53:16.029]  The Florida shooter, 44 times the police were called, saying he was going to kill people.
[00:53:16.029 --> 00:53:18.071]  He was allowed to commit crimes, let out of jail.
[00:53:18.071 --> 00:53:18.871]  They let this happen.
[00:53:18.871 --> 00:53:20.492]  The police stood down.
[00:53:20.492 --> 00:53:37.804]  In almost every case, these mass shootings were preventable, but having Alexa, or having Google Assist, or having Facebook's little, what's it's spy called, watching and listening to us, and sending it back to DARPA to build psychological profiles with big tech, big psych, and big
[00:53:38.544 --> 00:53:43.370]  Pharma, admittedly, that's what it says in the plan, all together with U.S.
[00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:51.820]  intelligence agencies outside of law, disappearing you or taking your guns or not letting you buy a gun or not letting you travel.
[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:55.984]  This is hell on earth and we're told by the Washington Post, who lies a lot.
[00:53:57.076 --> 00:53:57.336]  Followed us.
[00:54:21.169 --> 00:54:33.313]  Why he's making an alliance with the very big tech companies that are banning and censoring his supporters left, right and centre by teaming up with them to create what is a frightening Orwellian system.
[00:54:33.313 --> 00:54:37.955]  We know in China that, again, 2.5 million people in the month of July alone.
[00:54:37.955 --> 00:54:41.356]  So it's total millions and millions more prevented from buying plane tickets.
[00:54:41.903 --> 00:54:43.604]  You are going to get punished.
[00:54:43.604 --> 00:54:47.505]  You were punished, Alex Jones, by PayPal because of your political opinions.
[00:54:47.505 --> 00:54:50.646]  PayPal is taking over credit card companies.
[00:54:50.646 --> 00:54:56.969]  What happens when you go to buy groceries at the store, you put in your credit card, it says, sorry, denied, because some
[00:54:57.449 --> 00:55:02.270]  Pencil neck in Silicon Valley doesn't like what you posted on Facebook.
[00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:10.532]  Facebook has made it clear anything that disagrees with the narrative, the dogma put out by Mark Zuckerberg is not allowed on their platform.
[00:55:10.532 --> 00:55:15.333]  They literally ban people who post photos of you because you've been fully depersoned.
[00:55:15.333 --> 00:55:18.934]  This is the ultimate end game of mass surveillance and we were talking about the
[00:55:19.694 --> 00:55:23.158]  Widening gulf, Alex, between the underclass and the elite.
[00:55:23.158 --> 00:55:30.186]  How the elite are going to take on this technology, how it's not going to be available to the underclass, and that's going to create more tensions in society.
[00:55:30.186 --> 00:55:33.429]  They've just had the new stats out, Alex.
[00:55:33.429 --> 00:55:34.931]  Servant class jobs.
[00:55:35.444 --> 00:55:42.230]  To cater for the needs of the elite rose 114% over the last 10 years.
[00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:45.673]  That's compared with just a 7% rise in overall jobs.
[00:55:45.673 --> 00:55:53.520]  So all those jobs, the pedicurists, the manicurists, the massagers, the skin care specialists, they're all booming.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:58.864]  They've got 3.2 million service class workers in the United States.
[00:55:58.864 --> 00:56:00.025]  That's an increase of 2.8 million since 2010.
[00:56:02.427 --> 00:56:06.112]  The elite is importing migrants to become their wage slaves.
[00:56:06.112 --> 00:56:15.445]  The middle class is disappearing and we're not going to get access to this technology which turns our new elite into basically cyborg superheroes.
[00:56:15.445 --> 00:56:19.610]  So that is 25 years in the future unless we stop it now.
[00:56:20.916 --> 00:56:23.117]  Paul, that's the moment we've reached here.
[00:56:23.117 --> 00:56:28.038]  And they've been building the architecture for this the entire time.
[00:56:28.038 --> 00:56:31.899]  We, like children, have been kept out of the big adult table.
[00:56:31.899 --> 00:56:32.919]  I've gone and read all the documents.
[00:56:32.919 --> 00:56:33.299]  So have you.
[00:56:33.299 --> 00:56:35.480]  We're like, hey, people might want to be informed.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:38.141]  Hey, you might want to know they put fluoride in the water to dumb you down.
[00:56:38.141 --> 00:56:42.622]  Obama's White House science czar wrote that in 1974, 45 years ago.
[00:56:42.622 --> 00:56:43.622]  Here's the page number.
[00:56:43.622 --> 00:56:44.423]  Here it is.
[00:56:44.423 --> 00:56:45.283]  And then it's all out.
[00:56:45.283 --> 00:56:46.903]  I mean, do you like lower IQs?
[00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:48.104]  You like cancer?
[00:56:48.104 --> 00:56:49.084]  You like breast cancer?
[00:56:50.011 --> 00:56:52.313]  I mean, they know glyphosate grows breast tumors.
[00:56:52.313 --> 00:56:55.716]  Dr. Hemshaw, please, I want to show folks this article you mentioned.
[00:56:55.716 --> 00:56:58.518]  Again, servant class.
[00:56:58.518 --> 00:57:00.139]  It's just absolutely amazing.
[00:57:00.139 --> 00:57:01.881]  Servant class jobs to cater.
[00:57:03.357 --> 00:57:05.178]  The elite are booming and that's what it's all about.
[00:57:05.178 --> 00:57:07.659]  We have the biggest income disparities ever.
[00:57:07.659 --> 00:57:12.480]  We have the biggest massive global corporations offshore paying almost no taxes.
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:17.722]  But then there are the very leftist groups funding Black Lives Matter and lobbying for higher taxes on the middle class here.
[00:57:17.722 --> 00:57:18.702]  They want to conquer.
[00:57:18.702 --> 00:57:20.223]  They want to vertically integrate.
[00:57:20.223 --> 00:57:21.443]  They are survival of the fittest.
[00:57:21.443 --> 00:57:22.764]  They are social Darwinists.
[00:57:22.764 --> 00:57:24.424]  They are ruthless.
[00:57:24.424 --> 00:57:28.146]  Paul, do a little bit more with us talking about how we fight back and then.
[00:57:29.006 --> 00:57:30.647]  Couldn't get more excited here, folks.
[00:57:30.647 --> 00:57:32.068]  I don't have to put excitement in my voice.
[00:57:32.068 --> 00:57:32.889]  I'm excited.
[00:57:32.889 --> 00:57:36.191]  This is a lot more important than the NFL Super Bowl, isn't it?
[00:57:36.191 --> 00:57:37.412]  It's about the whole future.
[00:57:37.412 --> 00:57:45.718]  I'm gonna lay out the declassified documents where they planned all of this by 1962, a hundred times bigger than the Manhattan Project.
[00:57:47.213 --> 00:57:51.177]  In InfoWars life, we always try to bring you game-changing products.
[00:57:51.177 --> 00:57:55.562]  Now, we've already been promoting and selling Super Silver Wound Gel for over a year.
[00:57:55.562 --> 00:57:56.603]  It's a bestseller.
[00:57:56.603 --> 00:57:58.305]  It is the best you can get.
[00:57:58.305 --> 00:58:01.408]  A 100% review rate on Power Reviews.
[00:58:01.408 --> 00:58:02.590]  Well, now we teamed up with them.
[00:58:02.970 --> 00:58:06.572]  And came out with two different types of skin cream.
[00:58:06.572 --> 00:58:09.113]  One is naturally scented with grapefruit essential oils.
[00:58:09.113 --> 00:58:10.834]  The other is unscented.
[00:58:10.834 --> 00:58:16.236]  It's got hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, essential oils from grapefruit.
[00:58:16.236 --> 00:58:19.078]  It's got coconut oil and so much more.
[00:58:19.078 --> 00:58:21.299]  And this patented nano-type
[00:58:21.519 --> 00:58:21.939]  Of course!
[00:58:47.958 --> 00:58:52.319]  Banned.video is the answer to censorship.
[00:58:52.319 --> 00:59:07.843]  Banned.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are still available.
[00:59:07.843 --> 00:59:09.543]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:09.543 --> 00:59:10.884]  It's now live.
[00:59:10.884 --> 00:59:12.844]  Banned.video.
[00:59:12.844 --> 00:59:17.105]  Banned.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David
[00:59:20.166 --> 00:59:38.014]  We are building it to be a place where banned memes are able to be posted, and where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chi-coms, the Hollywood scum, and the globalists.
[00:59:38.014 --> 00:59:40.255]  Freedom of speech has a home.
[00:59:40.255 --> 00:59:42.756]  It's called banned.video.
[00:59:42.756 --> 00:59:46.518]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at banned.video.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:58.563]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:58.563 --> 01:00:08.648]  You know, I'm not trying to toot my horn here.
[01:00:08.648 --> 01:00:11.229]  Alex Jones back live.
[01:00:11.229 --> 01:00:12.590]  I'm really upset.
[01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:13.250]  I'm really worried.
[01:00:16.198 --> 01:00:22.601]  When my dad was in high school, he was already going to UT, and he told me about this stuff when I was a kid.
[01:00:22.601 --> 01:00:31.224]  Information energy, information currencies, how they had CD-ROMs, in like the mid-60s, secret nuclear reactors.
[01:00:31.224 --> 01:00:32.985]  Of course, later, it's all come out.
[01:00:32.985 --> 01:00:34.746]  That was just standard.
[01:00:34.746 --> 01:00:39.548]  That was just standard for anybody that was being, you know, groomed for the technocracy.
[01:00:39.548 --> 01:00:43.369]  And there are millions of people in the technocracy now, and they know all about this.
[01:00:43.369 --> 01:00:44.830]  And they talk to you like you're a child,
[01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:51.264]  And they're building this whole thing, and then now we're told Trump is looking to adopt.
[01:00:51.264 --> 01:00:54.826]  Now again, I don't just believe the Washington Post, but then I went and looked it up.
[01:00:54.826 --> 01:01:07.494]  Ivanka and one of Trump's best friends that heads up this group is proposing DARPA do all this, is a friend of Trump's and has said that Trump is looking to launch this.
[01:01:07.494 --> 01:01:13.818]  Now, whether that's true or not, they're trying to test balloon AI that's already watching and listening to us.
[01:01:15.265 --> 01:01:25.567]  Spying on us, and controlling our behavior, and extra-judicially, outside the process, finding us guilty of thought crime.
[01:01:25.567 --> 01:01:33.229]  Paul, we are now living something far stranger, far stranger than 1984.
[01:01:33.229 --> 01:01:41.671]  Well, Orwell couldn't even predict the levels of technology and how much they'd be interlinked, you know, when he wrote that book over half a century ago.
[01:01:41.671 --> 01:01:43.751]  It's at a point in China now,
[01:01:44.403 --> 01:01:50.427]  I keep seeing articles in the mainstream media saying, oh it's not networked together, they'll never get it sorted out.
[01:01:50.427 --> 01:01:54.089]  It's online to be all networked together in 2020.
[01:01:54.089 --> 01:02:07.497]  They've already got areas in China, Shandong province, where people's trustworthiness rankings, again, based on their personal behaviour, their political opinions, what they buy, what TV programmes they watch.
[01:02:08.004 --> 01:02:13.137]  Well, their trustworthiness rankings are displayed at the entrance to their own houses.
[01:02:13.137 --> 01:02:17.648]  So you can tell if this person's been a bad individual if they said something naughty out of turn.
[01:02:18.365 --> 01:02:20.706]  If it's going to be installed there, it's going to be installed here.
[01:02:20.706 --> 01:02:24.909]  They're already trying to do it in Hong Kong, which is why they're ripping down all the smart phones.
[01:02:24.909 --> 01:02:28.611]  Paul, what do you think banning UNI's name and a positive mention on Facebook?
[01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:29.951]  That's the social score.
[01:02:29.951 --> 01:02:32.973]  They're saying you'll only say their names in a negative connotation.
[01:02:32.973 --> 01:02:35.014]  That is beyond a cult.
[01:02:35.014 --> 01:02:41.177]  That is beyond the Branch Davidians, beyond Jim Jones, beyond Hale Bopp, beyond Heaven's Gate.
[01:02:41.177 --> 01:02:45.379]  I mean, this is a total takeover.
[01:02:45.379 --> 01:02:46.160]  Well, there's a meme.
[01:02:46.949 --> 01:02:53.593]  And it's like somebody taking a shower and Mark Zuckerberg's looking in the window and it says something like, watch out, Zuck's watching.
[01:02:53.593 --> 01:02:54.953]  And that's what it's all about.
[01:02:54.953 --> 01:02:56.674]  It's not just your behaviour.
[01:02:56.674 --> 01:03:06.239]  You can shut up, you can self-censor, but if you like a Facebook post or a tweet by somebody else, or even follow them, now you're in the same league as them.
[01:03:06.239 --> 01:03:08.961]  They've had an entire matrix mapped out, Alex.
[01:03:09.501 --> 01:03:15.104]  Where people who have talked to other people on YouTube are part of this radicalization web.
[01:03:15.104 --> 01:03:16.585]  It's all being pushed by the NGOs.
[01:03:16.585 --> 01:03:17.686]  Oh, I got an article here.
[01:03:17.686 --> 01:03:20.027]  We'll do five more minutes when we come back.
[01:03:20.027 --> 01:03:23.890]  Leftist study calls for banning smart clusters, small clusters.
[01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:24.930]  I'm
[01:03:43.544 --> 01:03:47.185]  Do you think the First Amendment's about when you don't like, say, slavery?
[01:03:47.185 --> 01:03:49.786]  It was the abolitionists that fomented dissent.
[01:03:49.786 --> 01:03:52.987]  Martin Luther King didn't like black people not being able to ride at the front of the bus.
[01:03:52.987 --> 01:03:54.348]  He fomented dissent.
[01:03:54.348 --> 01:04:00.870]  That's the whole point of America!
[01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:01.750]  What are solutions, Paul?
[01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:02.250]  We're going to break.
[01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:04.111]  We'll come back and give you the floor for five minutes.
[01:04:04.111 --> 01:04:04.791]  What are the solutions?
[01:04:06.169 --> 01:04:17.037]  Solutions are for the Trump administration to pass some kind of digital Bill of Rights, to roll back the power that these big tech companies have, to remove their immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Act.
[01:04:17.037 --> 01:04:18.258]  None of it's happened.
[01:04:18.258 --> 01:04:20.400]  They promised it for months.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:27.385]  Instead, they're literally working with them, and Giovanni is pushing this red flag law, which is basically the social credit score as well.
[01:04:28.083 --> 01:04:30.365]  So they're going in the opposite direction.
[01:04:30.365 --> 01:04:46.155]  So the solutions that were possibly there are fast, quickly disappearing, Alex, because apparently Trump administration doesn't want to listen, doesn't find it important that their primary supporters, the people who got them elected, are all being silenced and muscled out of existence.
[01:04:46.155 --> 01:04:49.838]  Back in 60 seconds to conclude with Paul Watson about what we need to do about Trump.
[01:04:49.838 --> 01:04:52.420]  Is impeachment in order?
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.420]  Is impeachment in order?
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:53.961]  I'm serious.
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:06.570]  There are only a few days left for you to get DNA Force Plus at 50% off and get a free bottle of Carnivore 90 for free.

[01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:20.885]  DNA Force Plus is our flagship product and needs no introduction.
[01:05:20.885 --> 01:05:27.691]  But Carnivore is so amazing that I want to offer you a free bottle of it so you can experience how great it is.
[01:05:27.691 --> 01:05:32.535]  We will be out of Carnivore in just the next week or so at current sales levels.
[01:05:32.535 --> 01:05:35.497]  I'm doing this because it's such an important product for people.
[01:05:35.497 --> 01:05:39.981]  I want those of you on the fence to experience it like so many others have.
[01:05:39.981 --> 01:05:40.382]  So again,
[01:05:40.922 --> 01:05:46.571]  We are running this special as long as our stock of Carnivore 90 is still here.
[01:05:46.571 --> 01:05:54.423]  Get your DNA Force Plus 50% off right now at MFullWarsStore.com or MFullWarsLife.com and get a free bottle of Carnivore 90.
[01:05:58.710 --> 01:06:12.935]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:19.098]  Well, there was a big study came out yesterday.
[01:06:20.854 --> 01:06:25.098]  Where eating fast food over a long period of time can make you go blind.
[01:06:25.098 --> 01:06:29.804]  There are cases of it where people have done this as a test and gone blind within one year.
[01:06:29.804 --> 01:06:32.947]  I wonder if President Trump's gone blind.
[01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:36.651]  Because reportedly he eats fast food three, four times a day, loves cake, loves ice cream.
[01:06:36.651 --> 01:06:38.133]  Hey, wonderful.
[01:06:38.133 --> 01:06:41.256]  The truth is though, it's full of additives, full of crap, full of trans fats.
[01:06:42.281 --> 01:06:43.082]  There it is.
[01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:48.346]  Doctors say diet from fries and chips left teen, fussy eater, blind from malnutrition.
[01:06:48.346 --> 01:06:52.229]  But another big study came out yesterday mirroring that.
[01:06:52.229 --> 01:06:54.491]  I'm not being sarcastic here.
[01:06:54.491 --> 01:06:58.715]  Trump guzzles 10 Diet Cokes a day.
[01:06:58.715 --> 01:07:02.318]  Now, Diet Coke breaks down at 87 degrees to what alcohol?
[01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:04.220]  Well, your temperature in your body is 98.
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.901]  Is it 98.8 or 98.6?
[01:07:05.901 --> 01:07:06.081]  I forget.
[01:07:09.048 --> 01:07:16.312]  Wood alcohol is very addicting, it's very toxic, it's a neurotoxin, an excitotoxin, a toxin that gets you high.
[01:07:16.312 --> 01:07:20.374]  Trump's gobbling MSG, Trump's gobbling aspartame all day.
[01:07:21.528 --> 01:07:37.220]  ...that makes monkeys go blind in studies, should never have been approved, and, you know, he's there, he's got stamina, I like a lot of what he does, he's trying to make America great again, he's fighting the Chai-coms, but what's the point of defeating the Chai-coms if we just adopt the social credit score that China has?
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.402]  So if you just tuned in, DrugsReport.com
[01:07:40.911 --> 01:07:41.091]  I don't
[01:07:57.862 --> 01:08:14.217]  A social score with DARPA and Big Tech in a partnership founding HARPA with a bunch of psychiatrists that will watch everything you do and put it in a digital database and if we decide your heart rate's too high or you're under stress, we'll take your guns or I'll let you buy guns.
[01:08:14.217 --> 01:08:16.719]  And that's out of the gates, they're saying.
[01:08:16.719 --> 01:08:19.182]  Well, we have all these assistants listening to you.
[01:08:21.158 --> 01:08:29.125]  And so if they hear violence or family violence, and again, oh, sounds good, they put it in your house as a Trojan horse, then they admit the government's using it.
[01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:31.307]  And that's the point I made yesterday.
[01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:39.614]  Congress and the Democrats are running big tech and having them in hearings, spying on people and saying, I want Paul Watson off the internet.
[01:08:39.614 --> 01:08:41.275]  I want Alex Jones off the internet.
[01:08:41.275 --> 01:08:42.697]  I want Matt Drudge off the internet.
[01:08:42.697 --> 01:08:48.522]  I spent two hours yesterday showing you the articles, the congressional testimony, Rolling Stone admitting it.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.602]  The government's running the censorship.
[01:08:52.602 --> 01:08:55.004]  So Trump is involved.
[01:08:55.004 --> 01:08:56.245]  And he's not ignorant, folks.
[01:08:56.245 --> 01:08:58.166]  I know he only uses pad and paper.
[01:08:58.166 --> 01:09:00.467]  I know that he dictates out the tweets.
[01:09:00.467 --> 01:09:01.488]  Okay?
[01:09:01.488 --> 01:09:03.389]  I understand he's 73 years old.
[01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:04.710]  And I like the president.
[01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:05.211]  But you know what?
[01:09:05.211 --> 01:09:07.092]  I like freedom a lot more.
[01:09:07.092 --> 01:09:08.673]  And this is shameful, Paul.
[01:09:08.673 --> 01:09:10.154]  So I didn't say that for effect.
[01:09:10.154 --> 01:09:13.396]  You know, Ann Coulter's saying Trump's betrayed us every five minutes.
[01:09:13.396 --> 01:09:15.858]  No, they've built a lot of border wall now.
[01:09:15.858 --> 01:09:17.319]  He can't get Congress to fund it.
[01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.900]  Most of the attacks are fake, okay?
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.141]  And I really care about Trump.
[01:09:21.141 --> 01:09:23.363]  But this is outrageous.
[01:09:23.363 --> 01:09:41.918]  And I don't have a bone to pick with Jared Kushner or Ivanka Trump, but a lot of our top advisors, smart folks, and it's been in the news, which I don't just believe, but I see them themselves, out with Google and Apple in face locks, you know, with Tim Cook, who says he supports Chinese censorship here in America.
[01:09:41.918 --> 01:09:42.758]  And so it seems like a
[01:09:43.599 --> 01:09:56.326]  Collapse into surveillance and so dangerous, the rollout of, yeah, we're listening to you, and government agencies with leftist psychiatrists and psychologists are going to be controlling everything you do.
[01:09:56.326 --> 01:10:03.190]  And then I go back to the founding of the Internet Plan that I'll cover once you're gone, next segment, and they admitted the plan.
[01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:05.311]  They're actually carrying out 1962 to 2019.
[01:10:05.311 --> 01:10:06.552]  How many years is that, folks?
[01:10:10.714 --> 01:10:11.955]  How many years is that?
[01:10:11.955 --> 01:10:12.776]  From 62, that's 38?
[01:10:12.776 --> 01:10:14.177]  And then you add 19 to that?
[01:10:14.177 --> 01:10:14.417]  38 and 19, folks.
[01:10:14.417 --> 01:10:14.577]  38 and 19.
[01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:15.238]  Think about that.
[01:10:21.604 --> 01:10:26.206]  They planned this whole thing out.
[01:10:26.206 --> 01:10:28.027]  And now it's happening.
[01:10:28.027 --> 01:10:29.368]  It's unbelievable.
[01:10:29.368 --> 01:10:32.250]  Paul, you've got the floor for the next six minutes.
[01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:33.410]  What do we do about Trump?
[01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:34.211]  How do we counter this?
[01:10:34.211 --> 01:10:47.337]  Because the vacuum of him doing nothing, as his supporters and hundreds of millions of accounts following him, and all of it being deleted, and his own campaign ads aren't allowed to run on Facebook that say Strong Women, and Mitch McConnell's blocked on Twitter, and it's a reign of terror!
[01:10:47.337 --> 01:10:48.278]  They're promoting Antifa!
[01:10:48.838 --> 01:10:51.160]  I think one of the problems, Alex, is people get
[01:11:09.344 --> 01:11:14.005]  ...ingratiated within this kind of MAGA cult based around DC.
[01:11:14.005 --> 01:11:36.470]  And you know, they get to meet Trump a few times, they get the photograph, they get to hang out at some of the events, they get to go to the social media summit, out of which nothing happened, and they get in kind of this social scene, this MAGA cult, to the point where they refuse to hold Trump's feet to the fire on anything, because they don't want to be kicked out of their little social circle, and have their little access revoked.
[01:11:36.894 --> 01:11:48.221]  So it may not even be Trump's fault, it may be the people around him who are so, you know... A sycophantic network of fops.
[01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.001]  Exactly.
[01:11:49.001 --> 01:11:53.224]  I mean, the fact is, there's been no social media executive order.
[01:11:53.224 --> 01:11:55.925]  More illegals were deported under Obama than Trump.
[01:11:55.925 --> 01:11:57.066]  The wall hasn't been built.
[01:11:57.066 --> 01:12:01.249]  And yeah, that's because of massive opposition that he's faced, and we still support Trump.
[01:12:01.249 --> 01:12:03.330]  But people need to be less cult-like.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.861]  Less obsequious towards him.
[01:12:05.861 --> 01:12:08.503]  Question him or hold his feet to the fire more.
[01:12:08.503 --> 01:12:11.465]  That can only be healthy for American freedom in the long run.
[01:12:11.465 --> 01:12:13.667]  And the big issue, Alex, is the algorithm.
[01:12:13.667 --> 01:12:23.074]  Robert Epstein has said over and over, that algorithm changed by YouTube, by Google, will shift 12 million votes against Trump in the next election.
[01:12:23.074 --> 01:12:28.157]  So to treat this social media big tech issue as something on the bottom of the pile is ridiculous.
[01:12:28.157 --> 01:12:31.600]  It should be at the top of the agenda, but it doesn't seem like it is.
[01:12:33.151 --> 01:12:35.632]  Well, Trump's going to lose in 2020 on this course.
[01:12:35.632 --> 01:12:41.115]  I told people, even before Ann Coulter, that I thought Trump would be the nominee and win.
[01:12:41.115 --> 01:12:41.896]  I could just smell it.
[01:12:41.896 --> 01:12:43.617]  I could see it.
[01:12:43.617 --> 01:12:52.401]  And the fact that he's bowing to the deep state and the technocracy because of the architecture of this thing that, again, is 100 times bigger than the Manhattan Project.
[01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:56.223]  This is the whole world government technocracy post-human system.
[01:12:56.223 --> 01:12:56.684]  This is it.
[01:12:56.684 --> 01:13:02.187]  And you've got top scientists, as you said, explaining that they can steal the election like that, and they say they will.
[01:13:03.007 --> 01:13:06.088]  Doesn't matter how many campaign stop Trump does.
[01:13:06.088 --> 01:13:12.511]  If he doesn't get his ass in gear, we're all going to lose and then they're going to have a purge against us, Paul.
[01:13:12.511 --> 01:13:15.632]  How many people are already in jail over in the UK for their speech?
[01:13:15.632 --> 01:13:17.493]  I mean, this is real authoritarianism.
[01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:21.114]  We're in the fight for our lives.
[01:13:21.114 --> 01:13:26.376]  Thousands of people are arrested in the UK every year for essentially mean tweets.
[01:13:26.376 --> 01:13:28.277]  But yeah, we need to hold his feet to the fire.
[01:13:28.277 --> 01:13:30.698]  There's been no social media executive order.
[01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:32.559]  I think it is very much related to this
[01:13:33.203 --> 01:13:34.344]  We're good to go.
[01:13:58.527 --> 01:13:59.668]  And he's going to lose the election.
[01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:05.272]  The only saving grace is the paucity of quality candidates on the Democratic side running against him.
[01:14:05.272 --> 01:14:08.034]  But again, he shouldn't be counting on that, Alex.
[01:14:08.034 --> 01:14:15.240]  Well, I'll tell you this about Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:20.945]  If they think working with the Koch brothers and the establishment is going to get Trump re-elected, they're fools.
[01:14:20.945 --> 01:14:22.826]  It was Trump being a maverick got him elected.
[01:14:25.911 --> 01:14:28.413]  Sure, they might have had some diplomatic victories or whatever.
[01:14:28.413 --> 01:14:30.074]  I don't care about all that.
[01:14:30.074 --> 01:14:33.596]  I care about the fundamentals of our freedoms, and America being an example.
[01:14:33.596 --> 01:14:44.503]  And this draconian system of announcing, oh, all these smart devices are listening to you, they'll report if you might be violent, that just takes us beyond 1984.
[01:14:44.503 --> 01:14:46.184]  Game over, checkmate.
[01:14:46.184 --> 01:14:47.805]  And it's from Trump?
[01:14:47.805 --> 01:14:50.967]  I mean, no one can put up with this crap, folks.
[01:14:50.967 --> 01:14:54.810]  The left wants to be able to use the devices to track you and set you up.
[01:14:55.470 --> 01:15:00.152]  And so everyone must get the, and I asked the folks to bring you this this morning and they forgot.
[01:15:00.152 --> 01:15:02.553]  Because again, they've just decimated our attention spans.
[01:15:02.553 --> 01:15:06.655]  I've got over there in my other office, I've got the satchels that are lead lined.
[01:15:06.655 --> 01:15:11.537]  Everyone, if you have one of these damn phones, these digital minders, these spies, you've got to put them in those.
[01:15:12.057 --> 01:15:17.260]  With your keys, your wallet, because people are stealing your wallet stuff anyway, scanning them, the RFID chips.
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:19.321]  Everyone, all men, should start carrying.
[01:15:19.321 --> 01:15:24.444]  We ought to come out with a design of a lead line when it goes on your side, so you use the phone you want when you're there.
[01:15:24.444 --> 01:15:30.147]  Because even when location's off, they are still tracking you, unless it's in a lead line case and the RF can't get to it.
[01:15:30.147 --> 01:15:33.749]  So, there's a lot of things to mitigate this, even if we can't defeat it legislatively.
[01:15:33.749 --> 01:15:36.370]  Incredible job, Paul, and I've got a video coming out on this today.
[01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:38.311]  More articles at InfoWars.com.
[01:15:38.311 --> 01:15:40.472]  It's good to be here with you, and I'm glad you're there fighting.
[01:15:40.472 --> 01:15:41.233]  Thank you so much, Paul.
[01:15:42.324 --> 01:15:42.985]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[01:15:42.985 --> 01:15:45.487]  Incredible job, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:15:45.487 --> 01:15:51.954]  But again, you need to put your phones inside lead line cases when you're not using them.
[01:15:51.954 --> 01:15:52.675]  They are evil.
[01:15:55.578 --> 01:15:57.518]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:15:57.518 --> 01:16:02.840]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.420]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:12.782]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:16:27.128 --> 01:16:29.329]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[01:17:21.448 --> 01:17:23.249]  Not a security IPO or note.

[01:17:48.181 --> 01:18:02.851]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin, it's only natural that it starts to crack and take damage.

[01:18:57.638 --> 01:19:02.763]  It's been a year since InfoWars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[01:19:02.763 --> 01:19:10.691]  We had over 5 billion views when we got banned, and we're credited with getting Donald Trump elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[01:19:10.691 --> 01:19:18.239]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable to block the signal.
[01:19:18.659 --> 01:19:19.680]  And it's now here.

[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:58.702]  Band.Video.
[01:19:58.702 --> 01:20:01.323]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:33.265 --> 01:20:42.133]  Of course, Washington said that during his first term as president.
[01:20:42.133 --> 01:20:46.877]  And he got involved, fought hard, and did all the things he did to get government office back.
[01:20:46.877 --> 01:20:48.878]  In order to make him king, he said, I don't want to be king.
[01:20:48.878 --> 01:20:50.640]  I want him to serve more than two terms.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:56.565]  He said no, creating that policy, that custom that presidents only serve two terms.
[01:20:56.565 --> 01:21:00.448]  The only guy that violated that was FDR.
[01:21:00.448 --> 01:21:01.469]  Why do I talk about that?
[01:21:02.574 --> 01:21:05.096]  Because these aren't cell phones.
[01:21:05.096 --> 01:21:18.724]  One function of these, this little iPhone made by slaves in China, one function of these is a microwave relay system you call a cell phone.
[01:21:18.724 --> 01:21:28.690]  But what it really is, is a system that knows your heart rate, your breathing rate, how fast you're traveling, where you're going, what you're doing, even if you turn all those functions off.
[01:21:28.690 --> 01:21:30.491]  This is your digital
[01:21:33.894 --> 01:21:36.236]  Son of Guardian Angel.
[01:21:36.236 --> 01:21:41.800]  And absolutely, I promote things that I know are good for people.
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:45.863]  I promote things that I know folks need.
[01:21:45.863 --> 01:21:52.848]  I mean, I know there's glyphosate, and I know there's on average over 300 other chemicals in the water table, including radioactive isotopes.
[01:21:52.848 --> 01:21:58.291]  And that one of the top reasons we have cancer is drinking from the water table.
[01:21:58.291 --> 01:22:01.534]  Even if you go out in the middle of the desert where there's been no chemical runoff,
[01:22:02.458 --> 01:22:07.941]  Most aquifers have high levels of radioactive isotopes.
[01:22:07.941 --> 01:22:09.301]  Just type that in.
[01:22:09.301 --> 01:22:11.362]  Aquifers, radioactive isotopes.
[01:22:11.362 --> 01:22:13.903]  Austin water is radioactive.
[01:22:13.903 --> 01:22:19.286]  It's got more than, last time I checked, 10 types of isotope in it.
[01:22:19.286 --> 01:22:23.468]  Now, you'd think you'd want to filter that.
[01:22:23.468 --> 01:22:26.989]  Of course, I sell water filters that are the best rated for that.
[01:22:26.989 --> 01:22:30.431]  And then I, you better damn well believe, filter my water or drink
[01:22:31.755 --> 01:22:39.977]  Bottles of filtered water from companies that have been around a long time, who've been tested, who are known to have some of the best water out there.
[01:22:39.977 --> 01:22:50.940]  They're not a sponsor, but let me tell you, they've been getting water out of the Aquapona Springs in Tuscan, Italy, for thousands of years, and it's been tested, and it's sweet, delicious water.
[01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:53.200]  I also drink filtered water.
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.701]  But the point is, I don't want radioactive isotopes.
[01:22:56.701 --> 01:22:59.362]  I don't want glyphosates.
[01:22:59.362 --> 01:23:00.042]  I like to live.
[01:23:02.165 --> 01:23:24.429]  Now next segment, and I'm glad we're still top linked on DrudgeReport.com, I'm going to, for the rest of the hour, walk through the total history, the admissions of what the internet was designed to do in a program a hundred times bigger, I think conservatively, than the Manhattan Project, and I'll explain why.
[01:23:24.429 --> 01:23:26.649]  That's a conservative number, by the way.
[01:23:26.649 --> 01:23:29.330]  This is the future.
[01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:30.430]  This is everything.
[01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:30.950]  And you think?
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:34.061]  You'd think people would want to know this.
[01:23:34.061 --> 01:23:35.441]  You'd think people would want to study this.
[01:23:35.441 --> 01:23:37.862]  I mean, why do you think I've been so successful?
[01:23:37.862 --> 01:23:40.383]  I'm not that important a person.
[01:23:40.383 --> 01:23:51.867]  I'm just a territorial Texan whose family brushed up against a lot of this in the military and in academia and other areas.
[01:23:51.867 --> 01:23:57.569]  So I grew up knowing all this and I just thought everybody else knew all this.
[01:23:57.569 --> 01:23:59.450]  Again, my dad was 16 years old.
[01:24:01.638 --> 01:24:05.503]  With five other students at UT when he was a junior.
[01:24:05.503 --> 01:24:07.325]  He was out of high school already at UT.
[01:24:07.325 --> 01:24:15.194]  And they were teaching him all of this eugenics, world government.
[01:24:15.194 --> 01:24:16.676]  And why were they working with all those young minds?
[01:24:16.676 --> 01:24:20.800]  Because they wanted... His professors would tell him, by the time you're 25, you're useless.
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:21.762]  We want those ideas.
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:28.063]  And of course, others simultaneously developed the idea of information being a form of energy and currency.
[01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:34.887]  But my dad wrote a paper that they snatched up and said, let's not let anybody see this, called Info-G, Information Energy.
[01:24:34.887 --> 01:24:37.649]  That'll sound some bells off in the system.
[01:24:37.649 --> 01:24:40.971]  But that's how all this works, okay?
[01:24:40.971 --> 01:24:42.492]  This is the future!
[01:24:42.492 --> 01:24:44.253]  This is it!
[01:24:44.253 --> 01:24:48.116]  And we're like savages, cavemen here, when the aliens land, basically.
[01:24:49.773 --> 01:24:57.324]  That's what Ray Kurzweil, that's what all the globalists say is, you'll be like a bug, you'll be like a houseplant, you'll be lucky we don't kill you.
[01:24:57.324 --> 01:24:58.686]  What a nasty system.
[01:24:58.686 --> 01:25:01.309]  And they say it will be adopted.
[01:25:01.309 --> 01:25:06.677]  So they make the most addictive, evil systems they can, directly manipulating our dopamine.
[01:25:09.465 --> 01:25:18.508]  And then Sean Parker comes out and says, I was hired by Zuckerberg to make it as addictive as possible 15 years ago, and now it's 10 times worse, and I really feel guilty that he starts giggling and laughing.
[01:25:18.508 --> 01:25:24.949]  Just like Elon Musk said, oh, beware AI gods, oh, don't take the brain chip, oh, they want you to merge the machines, they're gonna kill everybody.
[01:25:24.949 --> 01:25:33.792]  Suddenly his factories catch on fire, Soros is coming after him, his company almost goes belly up, and he's like, I'll put brain chips in you, next year in the mall, world government resistance is futile!
[01:25:38.131 --> 01:25:43.493]  Because Elon Musk cares more about his money.
[01:25:43.493 --> 01:25:45.653]  Listen, you want to get brain chips and do all this, do it.
[01:25:45.653 --> 01:25:48.994]  But know who's doing it, and know where it's leading, and know it's about control.
[01:25:48.994 --> 01:25:51.435]  You're not going to be supermen.
[01:25:51.435 --> 01:26:00.158]  So I'll lay out the history when we come back, but speaking of funding ourselves, if you're going to have one of these digital surveillance minders,
[01:26:07.483 --> 01:26:17.667]  Then you need to go to InfoWarsTore.com, where we have branded to our own systems, very inexpensive, lead-lined pockets.
[01:26:17.667 --> 01:26:21.568]  And depending on the cell phone, these have about a 98% resistance rate.
[01:26:21.568 --> 01:26:28.631]  The bigger packs we sell at InfoWarsTore.com, and again, put it back on screen so I can give them the name of it, they can find it, InfoWars Privacy Pouches.
[01:26:28.631 --> 01:26:34.073]  We have these bigger ones, and this is what I like to use when I'm on a trip or traveling so they don't track me as easy.
[01:26:34.073 --> 01:26:35.173]  And believe me, they do.
[01:26:36.957 --> 01:26:51.703]  I mean, I've had folks break into my room, do physical stuff, and I don't try to make a big deal about it, I'm a man, but I mean, when I travel, I definitely put the wireless equipment, any iPads, any phones, in here.
[01:26:51.703 --> 01:26:58.986]  And this larger unit has around 100% block it rate, and you just put everything in there and you keep it like that.
[01:26:58.986 --> 01:27:05.069]  And we've got them that also have the satchels and have the straps on them, but just whatever you do, you need to understand,
[01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:11.114]  They're reporting on you, they're tracking you, they're listening to you at all times when they have the radio connection to it.
[01:27:11.114 --> 01:27:23.805]  It's recording and compressing packets that are more advanced level than blurping them back to the cell tower or through other wireless devices in your house that are slurping it up and then in many cases transferring it down power lines.
[01:27:23.805 --> 01:27:26.227]  That's right, information down power line.
[01:27:26.227 --> 01:27:27.828]  That's in place.
[01:27:27.828 --> 01:27:30.851]  And so I just suggest you go to InfoWareShore.com and get the
[01:27:33.086 --> 01:27:37.830]  The tractor table pouch, detractor pouch.
[01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:43.074]  And that's just something so you start thinking about how it tracks you.
[01:27:43.074 --> 01:27:46.797]  Because I'll go for a few weeks using this, then I'll forget and stop doing it.
[01:27:46.797 --> 01:27:47.097]  Why?
[01:27:47.097 --> 01:27:50.240]  I mean, they've got private eyes following me.
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.541]  They've got the New York Times, Washington Post following me.
[01:27:52.541 --> 01:27:57.766]  They've had people try to set me up to do things I won't say on air for a lot of reasons, obviously.
[01:28:00.964 --> 01:28:06.466]  I mean, I've had to have, you know, armed guards at my house for real legitimate stuff.
[01:28:06.466 --> 01:28:18.409]  That's how I know that the Democrats in the Deep State are using the Mexican Mafia, MS-13, Antifa, all these groups are real folks, and they're already casing and targeting thousands of people's homes.
[01:28:18.409 --> 01:28:20.709]  These are very dangerous criminals, okay?
[01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:25.811]  So I'm just telling you, this is an example of what I'm talking about just to get you and your children or your wife or your husband thinking.
[01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:30.332]  Separately, I didn't even get to the other special, but I'll cover it at the end of the hour.
[01:28:30.332 --> 01:28:33.893]  It's the last few days to get DNA Force Plus at 50% off.
[01:28:33.893 --> 01:28:37.174]  Find out how amazing it is, what it does for your telomeres, cleaning out your cells.
[01:28:37.174 --> 01:28:38.315]  It's just amazing.
[01:28:38.315 --> 01:28:41.856]  With a free bottle of Carnivore Digestive Enzyme.
[01:28:41.856 --> 01:28:43.176]  That stuff costs $70 a bottle.
[01:28:43.176 --> 01:28:44.837]  It's the best digestive enzyme out there.
[01:28:44.837 --> 01:28:46.937]  Helps absorb meat, flush your guts out.
[01:28:46.937 --> 01:28:47.377]  It's amazing.
[01:28:47.377 --> 01:28:48.878]  That's how you fund the operation.

[01:28:55.438 --> 01:28:56.658]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:56.658 --> 01:29:00.580]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:02.121]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:02.121 --> 01:29:05.082]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:05.082 --> 01:29:10.644]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:10.644 --> 01:29:11.844]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:11.844 --> 01:29:14.785]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[01:29:58.627 --> 01:30:02.009]  I've been so busy, I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[01:30:02.009 --> 01:30:03.249]  But it's very exciting.
[01:30:03.249 --> 01:30:05.571]  It's Super Silver Skin Cream.

[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.603]  This is Savannah Hernandez for InfoWars.com.
[01:31:02.603 --> 01:31:06.626]  I'm reporting to you from Hong Kong where I'm joined by reporter Greg Rees for the next week.
[01:31:06.626 --> 01:31:09.429]  This is Greg Rees for InfoWars.com in Hong Kong.

[01:32:02.808 --> 01:32:10.954]  It is a award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[01:32:10.954 --> 01:32:12.235]  It is cold-pressed.
[01:32:12.235 --> 01:32:18.680]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild-crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:19.841]  It's not boiled.
[01:32:19.841 --> 01:32:20.642]  It's not heated.
[01:32:20.642 --> 01:32:21.803]  It's never been dried.
[01:32:21.803 --> 01:32:22.964]  It's taken from fresh
[01:32:23.504 --> 01:32:24.304]  Herbs.
[01:32:24.304 --> 01:32:27.006]  That's why it's so strong.
[01:32:27.006 --> 01:32:30.788]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.
[01:32:30.788 --> 01:32:44.755]  And I'm so excited about Supramel Vitality and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with every order of Supramel Vitality a 25% off a free bottle of Carnivore Digestive Enzyme.

[01:33:08.325 --> 01:33:09.485]  Big Brother.
[01:33:09.485 --> 01:33:11.266]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:11.266 --> 01:33:13.186]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:13.186 --> 01:33:14.846]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:14.846 --> 01:33:16.527]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:16.527 --> 01:33:21.428]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.428 --> 01:33:24.708]  Get your motor running.
[01:33:24.708 --> 01:33:26.729]  Head out on the highway.
[01:33:26.729 --> 01:33:30.909]  Looking for adventure.
[01:33:30.909 --> 01:33:32.570]  In whatever comes our way.
[01:33:34.775 --> 01:33:40.239]  Next hour, it's gonna be absolutely jam-packed.
[01:33:40.239 --> 01:33:45.323]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[01:33:45.323 --> 01:33:49.105]  You'll definitely want to join us.
[01:33:49.105 --> 01:33:53.168]  Huge developments on China.
[01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:10.313]  On Iran, on Jesse Smollett, lawyers say even if he did lie, police do blame for taking seriously.
[01:34:10.313 --> 01:34:13.114]  I mean, that's the new Infowars.com's Amy White article.
[01:34:13.114 --> 01:34:15.875]  The arrogance of the left is just unbelievable.
[01:34:15.875 --> 01:34:21.217]  Ex-NFL star Larry Johnson sounds off on supposed effeminate agenda in two sports leagues.
[01:34:21.217 --> 01:34:24.459]  He'll be joining us on air.
[01:34:24.459 --> 01:34:27.940]  That is all coming up today.
[01:34:31.676 --> 01:34:42.686]  But let me now get to what I've been talking about the last hour and a half and what I've been building towards.
[01:34:42.686 --> 01:34:52.755]  There is no way for me to hype to you in a big enough way how huge this is.
[01:34:52.755 --> 01:34:54.937]  This is everything.
[01:34:54.937 --> 01:34:55.878]  This is where
[01:34:59.328 --> 01:35:08.531]  The $800 toilet seats and the $700 hammers in 1982, billions of dollars of it went.
[01:35:08.531 --> 01:35:27.517]  This is where the trillions that have been siphoned off in the last 50 plus years, since 1962, when the official main mission of DARPA
[01:35:28.814 --> 01:35:31.876]  The Defense Department's Advanced Research Laboratories.
[01:35:31.876 --> 01:35:39.441]  That Eisenhower, in 1961, warned everybody about.
[01:35:39.441 --> 01:35:47.267]  He says in the speech, not just beware the military industrial complex, it's a 21 minute speech.
[01:35:47.267 --> 01:35:49.228]  Somebody slams the door and he looks like he's about to be shot.
[01:35:49.228 --> 01:35:53.531]  Because it turns out he'd been briefed on this, that's been declassified.
[01:35:55.091 --> 01:36:14.680]  He said, beware the technological elite in control of all the major universities through Defense Department funding, creating a technological authoritarian elite in control of the military-industrial complex.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:18.042]  And then he went on to say, beware the military-industrial complex.
[01:36:18.042 --> 01:36:23.825]  All you gotta do is type in the text of Eisenhower's farewell address, or you can go to YouTube for now.
[01:36:24.687 --> 01:36:26.688]  Probably be pulled down later as hateful.
[01:36:26.688 --> 01:36:30.451]  And you can watch the 21-minute speech on national television, black and white.
[01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:31.812]  Okay?
[01:36:31.812 --> 01:36:39.277]  And he lays out there is, he says 90% of our funding isn't in private researchers or private inventors like it always was.
[01:36:39.277 --> 01:36:46.142]  Now it's under government control and we have a technological elite that is very, very dangerous and has some really, really dangerous plans.
[01:36:46.142 --> 01:36:48.664]  You need to beware what they're doing.
[01:36:48.664 --> 01:36:50.445]  That's Eisenhower, the hero of World War II.
[01:36:53.144 --> 01:37:04.631]  Do CTRL-F technological elite or CTRL-F elite and you will pull up where he says it in the transcript from history.com.
[01:37:04.631 --> 01:37:08.833]  Just type in CTRL-F and then the word elite and that's a search term it'll give it to you.
[01:37:08.833 --> 01:37:14.156]  Now, continuing ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:14.156 --> 01:37:16.138]  Moving on from there, document cam shot please.
[01:37:16.138 --> 01:37:18.279]  We're gonna move only to that now or I'm gonna get distracted.
[01:37:21.690 --> 01:37:27.335]  What we're about to cover here is the plan for you and your family.
[01:37:27.335 --> 01:37:33.640]  Now, I came and knocked on your door and I said, I've got a plan for, say, your wife.
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:34.400]  And you go, well, who are you?
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:38.404]  Well, I'm not going to tell you who I am, but I've got a plan for your wife.
[01:37:38.404 --> 01:37:39.204]  Well, how do you know my wife?
[01:37:39.204 --> 01:37:39.885]  Well, I'm not going to tell you.
[01:37:40.828 --> 01:37:45.049]  But I've been watching and listening to you for years, and let's just say I know all your secrets.
[01:37:45.049 --> 01:37:54.872]  Well, if you're a red-blooded American, or a red-blooded human, you'd grab the guy around the neck and say, listen, I don't know who you are, but get off my property.
[01:37:54.872 --> 01:38:01.773]  And he says, no, I know what you had for breakfast this morning, and I know you took a dump at 7 a.m.
[01:38:01.773 --> 01:38:03.494]  I've got it recorded right here, it's playing it to you.
[01:38:07.349 --> 01:38:08.349]  Yeah, there's Eisenhower.
[01:38:08.349 --> 01:38:13.971]  He said, we will become captive of a scientific technological elite.
[01:38:13.971 --> 01:38:15.571]  Worse than I told you.
[01:38:15.571 --> 01:38:18.232]  Captive!
[01:38:18.232 --> 01:38:20.093]  Captive!
[01:38:20.093 --> 01:38:23.794]  The President of the United States of America.
[01:38:23.794 --> 01:38:26.535]  We want one hero.
[01:38:26.535 --> 01:38:27.655]  Delight D. Eisenhower.
[01:38:30.356 --> 01:38:33.558]  He's looking at the people around the room like they're a bunch of traitors.
[01:38:33.558 --> 01:38:35.919]  He just said no to attacking U.S.
[01:38:35.919 --> 01:38:43.902]  military bases, movie theaters, and shopping malls to blame the Russians to start World War III a month before.
[01:38:43.902 --> 01:38:52.166]  Then he went into the agencies and found out what they were up to and found out they had plans to put people in tanks and put wires in their heads by 2025.
[01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:58.341]  And Eisenhower said, you're shutting all this down.
[01:38:58.341 --> 01:38:59.681]  That's come out.
[01:38:59.681 --> 01:39:09.346]  I just showed you him saying, scientific technological elite holding America and the world captive.
[01:39:09.346 --> 01:39:13.288]  Now, why did Dwight D. Eisenhower get so freaked out?
[01:39:13.288 --> 01:39:14.749]  And he killed these programs.
[01:39:14.749 --> 01:39:19.251]  They didn't stop.
[01:39:19.251 --> 01:39:20.992]  Because, you know, he liked his grandkids.
[01:39:20.992 --> 01:39:22.712]  He liked playing golf.
[01:39:22.712 --> 01:39:23.713]  What's wrong with humanity?
[01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:46.603]  But if you can conquer humanity, and if you can take the family out of the equation, and take decisions, and take language, and turn us into basically robots, with wires in our heads, living in deprivation tanks, it's not the Matrix, folks, this is from government documents, then you win.
[01:39:49.662 --> 01:39:53.565]  And next year, the brain chip implants will be at your local mall.
[01:39:53.565 --> 01:39:55.107]  Should I play the newscast again?
[01:39:55.107 --> 01:39:57.188]  It's 2020, folks.
[01:39:57.188 --> 01:39:58.590]  They're behind schedule, but not much.
[01:39:58.590 --> 01:40:01.872]  And I'm going to show you all that now.
[01:40:01.872 --> 01:40:11.921]  Because he had looked at the MIT program and the Stanford Research Institute, one on the East Coast, one on the West Coast, running this entire program
[01:40:13.342 --> 01:40:31.328]  With computers already linked up in batch processing so they could put hundreds of thousands of research scientists on jobs to develop and share breakthroughs quicker for a human-machine interface.
[01:40:31.328 --> 01:40:34.509]  A symbiosis and a merger.
[01:40:34.509 --> 01:40:40.210]  Now, I'm going to read this to you from DARPA.gov.
[01:40:40.210 --> 01:40:40.931]  Are you ready?
[01:40:40.931 --> 01:40:41.591]  Start your engines.
[01:40:43.936 --> 01:40:55.364]  Because you see Trump proposing DARPA and these groups with big tech to watch you and track you and not let you own guns if you seem upset or they heard you say something in your house.
[01:40:55.364 --> 01:40:58.987]  Here's Amazon admits listening to Alexa conversations.
[01:40:58.987 --> 01:40:59.807]  Why it matters.
[01:40:59.807 --> 01:41:02.169]  Forbes.
[01:41:02.169 --> 01:41:05.271]  All the stuff I told you decades ago.
[01:41:05.271 --> 01:41:05.972]  Apple series.
[01:41:05.972 --> 01:41:07.793]  He's dropping your conversations.
[01:41:07.793 --> 01:41:10.335]  Records you having sex.
[01:41:10.335 --> 01:41:11.736]  Documents what porn you watch.
[01:41:12.898 --> 01:41:14.719]  What kind of food your dog eats?
[01:41:14.719 --> 01:41:18.002]  Siri's recording everything you say.
[01:41:18.002 --> 01:41:20.944]  Apple's Siri routinely records you having sex.
[01:41:20.944 --> 01:41:25.647]  Google's absolutely listening to your conversations and it confirms that people don't trust big tech.
[01:41:25.647 --> 01:41:27.088]  See, Alex Jones first broke all this.
[01:41:27.088 --> 01:41:28.569]  He has to be off air.
[01:41:28.569 --> 01:41:32.592]  Amazon Alexa capturing audio of people having sex.
[01:41:32.592 --> 01:41:34.333]  Sexual assaults.
[01:41:34.333 --> 01:41:35.955]  Listening to users having sex.
[01:41:35.955 --> 01:41:39.537]  Daily Mail.
[01:41:39.537 --> 01:41:40.758]  So let's start getting into it.
[01:41:40.758 --> 01:41:41.359]  Then you have
[01:41:42.367 --> 01:41:44.988]  Oh, the big tech investor comes out all over the news this week.
[01:41:44.988 --> 01:41:52.112]  Google and Amazon use smart speakers for surveillance, top tech investor says, and says the public should be told and it should be reversed.
[01:41:52.112 --> 01:41:54.694]  John Rothwick.
[01:41:54.694 --> 01:42:00.637]  Now let's talk about why they're doing this and then show you the plan from 62 that had already been set up.
[01:42:00.637 --> 01:42:06.640]  This little exhibit, you can write off to the State Department today, they'll send you the brochure.
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:08.801]  Here it is, blown up color for you.
[01:42:08.801 --> 01:42:10.342]  The United States program for complete
[01:42:11.206 --> 01:42:15.550]  For general and complete disarmament in a peaceful world.
[01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:20.854]  The general means all over, and the complete, which means total, disarmament in a peaceful world.
[01:42:20.854 --> 01:42:28.221]  You read this, first the general public will be disarmed, the militaries will be disarmed, except for a global peacekeeper force.
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:35.584]  And everyone will be put back to an agrarian level except for the elite in the compact cities.
[01:42:35.584 --> 01:42:37.486]  And the police will even be disarmed.
[01:42:37.486 --> 01:42:40.309]  We'll tell you about, of course, really, only the UN has the weapons.
[01:42:40.309 --> 01:42:42.071]  But they go further in this.
[01:42:42.071 --> 01:42:46.476]  They say, we've got to end humanity as we know it to stop war.
[01:42:46.476 --> 01:42:48.458]  We've got to put wires in people's heads and put them in tanks.
[01:42:48.458 --> 01:42:52.041]  I'm going to show you that from DARPA when we come back.
[01:42:52.041 --> 01:42:52.442]  Stay with us.

[01:43:10.865 --> 01:43:10.945]  Yes.
[01:43:25.856 --> 01:43:27.037]  And so much more.

[01:44:23.797 --> 01:44:27.018]  David Nye or Owen Schroer or Paul Watson banned videos.

[01:44:44.861 --> 01:44:47.101]  Freedom of speech has a home.

[01:44:53.782 --> 01:45:02.410]  It's been a year since InfoWars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[01:45:02.410 --> 01:45:10.316]  We had over 5 billion views when we got banned, and we're credited with getting Donald Trump elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[01:45:10.316 --> 01:45:18.944]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable to block the signal, and it's now here.

[01:46:39.581 --> 01:46:39.981]  So again,
[01:46:40.541 --> 01:46:46.165]  We are running this special as long as our stock of Carnivore 90 is still here.

[01:46:59.254 --> 01:47:01.936]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.930 --> 01:47:15.893]  I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go.
[01:47:15.893 --> 01:47:21.735]  Dennis' last stop before Kokomo.
[01:47:21.735 --> 01:47:25.077]  Those nights were on fire, we couldn't get higher.
[01:47:25.077 --> 01:47:27.918]  We didn't know that we had it all.
[01:47:27.918 --> 01:47:31.119]  But nobody wants it before the fall.
[01:47:44.263 --> 01:47:51.368]  So Trump is like a fiddler crab that grew out of a shell and went and found somebody else's shell.
[01:47:51.368 --> 01:47:56.132]  Some other dead animal's skeleton.
[01:47:56.132 --> 01:47:58.134]  He climbed into it.
[01:47:58.134 --> 01:47:59.875]  And I don't blame him.
[01:47:59.875 --> 01:48:01.136]  I don't think he has it out for America.
[01:48:01.136 --> 01:48:03.077]  He's not anti-human.
[01:48:03.077 --> 01:48:05.679]  But the technocracy's running rings around him.
[01:48:05.679 --> 01:48:08.782]  He's letting them steal 2020 from the American people.
[01:48:10.435 --> 01:48:16.618]  He's letting him sense the living hell out of us and I don't see any good coming out of Jared and Ivanka when they keep meeting with Tim Cook.
[01:48:16.618 --> 01:48:19.399]  Just Trump saying, hey Tim Cook's a great guy.
[01:48:19.399 --> 01:48:22.581]  Tim Cook's got some great ideas.
[01:48:22.581 --> 01:48:28.224]  I guess we don't need to put sanctions on the Chinese and iPhones.
[01:48:28.224 --> 01:48:35.727]  And then oh, we're gonna use DARPA that created the internet for a reason we're about to show you.
[01:48:35.727 --> 01:48:37.128]  Have psychiatrists working
[01:48:38.285 --> 01:48:49.158]  With big tech to record everything, including your audio and video in your house, over all the smart so-called features, to create a psychological profile on you and take your guns.
[01:48:49.158 --> 01:48:51.361]  That's in the Washington Post today.
[01:48:51.361 --> 01:48:55.386]  Notice Trump hasn't tweeted and said it's wrong, because I went and spent hours this morning looking it up.
[01:48:55.386 --> 01:48:56.667]  Ivanka's shot her mouth off.
[01:48:57.742 --> 01:48:59.904]  Trump's good buddy's the one pushing it.
[01:48:59.904 --> 01:49:02.647]  The front group, oh it came from the grassroots.
[01:49:02.647 --> 01:49:13.116]  My wife died of pancreatic cancer so you've gotta let me listen to you over all the assistants in your house and take your guns or you're against my wife.
[01:49:13.116 --> 01:49:16.199]  So let's get into it right now.
[01:49:16.199 --> 01:49:21.764]  And in this next hour, California, San Francisco declares NRA domestic terrorist organization.
[01:49:21.764 --> 01:49:23.045]  Kellan McBrain, InfoWars.com.
[01:49:24.462 --> 01:49:29.343]  Now we can't declare Antifa a terrorist group, but we can declare the NRA one.
[01:49:29.343 --> 01:49:30.103]  Let's continue.
[01:49:30.103 --> 01:49:37.205]  So here is the United States program for general and complete disarmament in a peaceful world, public law.
[01:49:37.205 --> 01:49:38.426]  State Department document 7277.
[01:49:38.426 --> 01:49:42.287]  You might want to go read this.
[01:49:42.287 --> 01:49:47.188]  And it's a plan to take everybody's guns and get rid of masculinity because that's what causes war.
[01:49:49.639 --> 01:49:54.201]  This is a post-human world, just like NBC News told us last week.
[01:49:54.201 --> 01:50:03.204]  Cyborgs will replace humans, remake the world, it'll save the Earth, and that humans will disappear within our own lifetimes entirely.
[01:50:03.204 --> 01:50:04.865]  So they're telling.
[01:50:06.092 --> 01:50:10.894]  Sounds radical when I say it myself and I just show you them saying it and teaching you to hate yourself.
[01:50:10.894 --> 01:50:18.198]  I've got articles here, you know, Swedish government professors say we've got to eat humans and be cannibals to save the earth, eat bugs.
[01:50:18.198 --> 01:50:21.019]  Swedish behavioral scientists suggest eating humans to save the planet.
[01:50:21.019 --> 01:50:24.061]  That's all coming up.
[01:50:24.061 --> 01:50:29.083]  Washington State legalizes using humans for compost.
[01:50:29.083 --> 01:50:30.804]  Next it's the law, you've got to be composted.
[01:50:30.804 --> 01:50:32.425]  It's all about dehumanizing.
[01:50:32.425 --> 01:50:34.626]  But I digress, let's continue.
[01:50:35.919 --> 01:50:40.322]  So, this is the plan in the 50s given to the technocrats to create a docile, dumbed-down system.
[01:50:40.322 --> 01:50:42.283]  Well, first of all, break up the family.
[01:50:42.283 --> 01:50:43.544]  Don't have women care about children.
[01:50:43.544 --> 01:50:44.665]  Don't have women have children.
[01:50:44.665 --> 01:50:45.825]  Have men not care.
[01:50:45.825 --> 01:50:48.567]  Have them have arrested development and never be men.
[01:50:48.567 --> 01:50:50.008]  That's the plan.
[01:50:50.008 --> 01:50:53.670]  Now, let's get into what they developed and what was adopted.
[01:50:53.670 --> 01:50:55.091]  Just like two scientists won in 1992, a
[01:50:58.444 --> 01:51:04.086]  Nobel Science Prize for a plan to spray aluminum dioxide barium salt in the upper atmosphere to quote protect from global warming.
[01:51:04.086 --> 01:51:09.708]  It was adopted to global policy two years later and that's all declassified now that indeed they're adding it to the jet fuel.
[01:51:09.708 --> 01:51:16.270]  It's being aerosolized to create nuclei and they've had C-SPAN symposiums with the CIA admitting it but I'm still the cook for telling you.
[01:51:17.261 --> 01:51:19.622]  Just like fluoride lowers your IQ and gives you cancer.
[01:51:19.622 --> 01:51:20.282]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:51:20.282 --> 01:51:21.223]  I'm still the bad guy.
[01:51:21.223 --> 01:51:25.785]  Just like Epstein has an island and cloning facilities and child breeding facilities.
[01:51:25.785 --> 01:51:29.027]  I mean, I told you he was heading up the Institute for the Rockefellers that does that!
[01:51:29.027 --> 01:51:31.368]  Of course he does that!
[01:51:31.368 --> 01:51:32.228]  How did you know that?
[01:51:32.228 --> 01:51:33.249]  That's what those people do!
[01:51:38.237 --> 01:51:45.142]  They create genetic clones so they can harvest them later, and the people never even know who they are growing up in the regular life.
[01:51:45.142 --> 01:51:48.024]  Then people come by, put them in a van, and take them away.
[01:51:48.024 --> 01:51:50.466]  David Rockefeller had seven heart transplants.
[01:51:50.466 --> 01:51:52.847]  Word is two of them were from clones.
[01:51:52.847 --> 01:51:54.829]  You're not in Kansas anymore, boys and girls.
[01:51:54.829 --> 01:51:57.270]  Okay, let's continue.
[01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:59.852]  Oh, I'm putting out some classified info right there.
[01:51:59.852 --> 01:52:01.914]  So, let's continue.
[01:52:01.914 --> 01:52:05.096]  MIT and the Galactic Network.
[01:52:05.096 --> 01:52:06.657]  This is from encyclopedia.com.
[01:52:09.184 --> 01:52:15.406]  And it says, the concept of the Galactic Network was created by J.C.R.
[01:52:15.406 --> 01:52:19.447]  Lickletter, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher professor.
[01:52:19.447 --> 01:52:26.569]  Lickletter's vision of the Galactic Network, a network of computers that allows users to gather data and access programs anywhere in the world, was detailed in a series of memos.
[01:52:26.569 --> 01:52:29.890]  The first man-computer symbiosis.
[01:52:29.890 --> 01:52:30.610]  That means merger.
[01:52:31.872 --> 01:52:38.617]  ...was written in 1960 and detailed Lickletter's thoughts on the development of the interaction between humans and computers.
[01:52:38.617 --> 01:52:40.759]  I've read the paper.
[01:52:40.759 --> 01:52:43.921]  It's to control and track the population in mergers with machines.
[01:52:43.921 --> 01:52:57.211]  The second memo, Online Man Online, you've heard these terms before, he made them, Online Man Computer Communication, was published two years later and took the galactic network idea further, promoting the concept of social interaction through the networking of computers.
[01:52:58.181 --> 01:53:04.046]  In 68, Lickletter co-authored The Computers as a Communication Device with Research.
[01:53:04.046 --> 01:53:05.428]  Robert Taylor goes on.
[01:53:05.428 --> 01:53:18.199]  And he goes on to break down how in 62, he became the head of ARPA, Information Processing, to put this into function and already had it hooked up to universities all over the country.
[01:53:18.199 --> 01:53:20.501]  And it just goes through all of it.
[01:53:20.501 --> 01:53:22.883]  Information flow through large communication nets.
[01:53:25.489 --> 01:53:31.593]  The TX, MIT computer, and the Q32 computer linked up again between Stanford and MIT, like I told you earlier.
[01:53:31.593 --> 01:53:33.554]  And it's all right here.
[01:53:33.554 --> 01:53:39.258]  The Federation of Scientists, the 2000 declassified document, off his research, where one model was, again, we would live in tanks.
[01:53:39.258 --> 01:53:40.779]  This is in my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:53:40.779 --> 01:53:42.220]  They reclassified it later.
[01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:43.941]  Let's fill the documents out there.
[01:53:43.941 --> 01:53:48.043]  Where you would be born into a tank and have wires in you, and your heat would power the machine.
[01:53:48.043 --> 01:53:50.805]  There'd be no more war because you'd live in a virtual reality.
[01:53:50.805 --> 01:53:51.306]  I'm not kidding.
[01:53:51.306 --> 01:53:53.987]  See, again, none of this is fiction.
[01:53:53.987 --> 01:53:54.948]  They're theorizing it.
[01:53:56.892 --> 01:54:03.154]  His foresight, he predicted millions of people would be using Galactic Network by 2000 in research efforts by MIT.
[01:54:03.154 --> 01:54:07.996]  Education institutions paved the way for the development of the ARPANET and eventually the Internet.
[01:54:07.996 --> 01:54:12.958]  And then it goes on about the Intergalactic Network and social media.
[01:54:12.958 --> 01:54:16.659]  And again, what did Eisenhower call the real plan?
[01:54:16.659 --> 01:54:21.361]  He called it that we would become captives of the scientific elite.
[01:54:22.858 --> 01:54:23.980]  There's no intergalactic network.
[01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:24.400]  Wikipedia.
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:25.622]  Go read about it for yourself.
[01:54:25.622 --> 01:54:27.285]  So that's where all this comes from.
[01:54:27.285 --> 01:54:30.810]  And it would be psychiatrists and technocrats over it.
[01:54:30.810 --> 01:54:36.059]  And then they would track you with these handheld computers that were either wireless or interfaced with terminals.
[01:54:39.925 --> 01:54:52.757]  And then it would track everything you were doing and track how the stimulus and propaganda on the national news was affecting you to be able to dial it back or dial it forward and manipulate.
[01:54:53.632 --> 01:55:03.001]  Then of course they set up the whole NSA system that was already in place to keyword, create transcripts that were searchable by the 70s and 80s.
[01:55:03.001 --> 01:55:07.645]  Then they got the miniaturization of data by the 90s, able to record everything.
[01:55:07.645 --> 01:55:16.013]  And then they needed to get people to accept it, so they came out with social media where you opt in to being watched, listened to, tracked, and manipulated.
[01:55:17.125 --> 01:55:34.638]  With systems that addict you and control you and that's all over the news that social media admits their main mission is to make you as addicted to their systems and to not be interfaced with your fellow humans and friends and then to isolate you towards absorption into the larger system.
[01:55:34.638 --> 01:55:43.725]  Once you get so depressed they'll then offer you the brain chip or the interface that Musk is pushing so that you will be enlightened and then transcend to the super cyborg level which is really
[01:55:43.985 --> 01:55:45.046]  A digital grave.
[01:55:45.046 --> 01:55:45.826]  You'll lose your body.
[01:55:45.826 --> 01:55:46.847]  You'll physically die.
[01:55:46.847 --> 01:55:49.788]  But then it'll be your perfect voice, perfect avatars.
[01:55:49.788 --> 01:55:53.110]  People won't know that it's an AI that's taken on your likeness in a giant con game.
[01:55:53.110 --> 01:55:54.211]  You'll be dead.
[01:55:54.211 --> 01:55:57.333]  Continuing, and it goes on to all of this.
[01:55:57.333 --> 01:56:01.035]  Remember then, 2002, Total Information Awareness Network.
[01:56:02.055 --> 01:56:16.001]  Uh, that said everything you do will be tracked, every word you say recorded, will be put into a giant digital system at DARPA, used to control and track your entire life, and if you don't behave yourself, all of these systems will be turned off, and you will not be able to buy or sell as social control.
[01:56:16.001 --> 01:56:18.542]  Oh, I wonder where the Chinese got the idea.
[01:56:18.542 --> 01:56:20.883]  The globals built it for them.
[01:56:20.883 --> 01:56:28.946]  Uh, again, Information Awareness Office, you need to go research all of this, and then they got everybody to opt in because it was illegal for the NSA to publicly do all of this.
[01:56:32.495 --> 01:56:46.912]  So, meanwhile, the very same big pharma that's involved in all this announcement that Trump's pushing, that Ivanka Trump's pushing, makes you more depressed, makes you commit suicide, pushes deadly drugs on you that make you commit suicide, make you kill people.
[01:56:47.901 --> 01:57:09.577]  And then there's more depression, more cancer, more suicide, and as that happens, it's more of the excuse, oh, we better listen and watch everyone, because they're all committing suicide and becoming depressed, because the electromagnetic radiation, the programming, the isolation, not being out in nature, all of it makes you like an elephant that wants to commit suicide in the zoo, waddling back and forth and banging its head into the bars, trying to kill itself.
[01:57:10.529 --> 01:57:17.775]  They know how to put a mammal into this position, and they're putting you, your children, your family into a suicidal position.
[01:57:17.775 --> 01:57:19.897]  We'll come back and hit more of this on the other side.
[01:57:19.897 --> 01:57:22.199]  Please don't forget, without your funding, we're destroyed.
[01:57:22.199 --> 01:57:25.842]  You look at what DrudgeReport.com's done, having this top link.
[01:57:25.842 --> 01:57:28.384]  That takes amazing courage to do something like that.
[01:57:28.384 --> 01:57:32.107]  Have you shared the link at DrudgeReport.com about the plan for you and your family?
[01:57:32.107 --> 01:57:33.228]  Are you going to fight back?
[01:57:33.228 --> 01:57:34.769]  Are you going to be a participant in your future?
[01:57:36.494 --> 01:57:39.841]  And remember, Infowarshore.com for t-shirts, books, films, the best supplements.
[01:57:39.841 --> 01:57:41.485]  Without your funding, we'll be defeated.
[01:57:41.485 --> 01:57:43.769]  With your support, we're all unstoppable together.
[01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:51.613]  Super Mel Vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[01:57:51.613 --> 01:57:59.756]  It is a award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[01:57:59.756 --> 01:58:01.037]  It is cold pressed.
[01:58:01.037 --> 01:58:07.480]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:08.660]  It's not boiled.
[01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:09.441]  It's not heated.
[01:58:09.441 --> 01:58:10.621]  It's never been dried.
[01:58:10.621 --> 01:58:11.782]  It's taken from fresh
[01:58:12.322 --> 01:58:13.103]  Herbs.
[01:58:13.103 --> 01:58:15.825]  That's why it's so strong.
[01:58:15.825 --> 01:58:19.587]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.
[01:58:19.587 --> 01:58:33.577]  And I'm so excited about Supramel Vitality and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with every order of Supramel Vitality at 25% off a free bottle of Carnivore Digestive Enzyme.
[01:58:33.577 --> 01:58:35.018]  We're going to sell out of this very quickly.

[01:58:46.167 --> 01:58:48.289]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:58:48.289 --> 01:58:49.451]  Alex, God bless you.
[01:58:49.451 --> 01:58:52.034]  I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt.
[01:58:52.034 --> 01:58:57.339]  Instead of, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[01:58:57.339 --> 01:58:57.980]  Ooh, yeah.
[01:58:57.980 --> 01:59:00.042]  Showing your brain, getting frat.
[01:59:00.042 --> 01:59:01.884]  Gonna have some comments on your supplements, man.
[01:59:01.884 --> 01:59:02.926]  Totally changed my life.
[01:59:02.926 --> 01:59:05.989]  I use TurboForce, BODY, AlphaPower, BrainForce.
[01:59:06.169 --> 01:59:06.550]  We're good.
[01:59:21.467 --> 01:59:30.590]  All of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil, or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[01:59:30.590 --> 01:59:33.110]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel in the body.
[01:59:33.110 --> 01:59:36.251]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation.
[01:59:36.251 --> 01:59:38.032]  Now you can build the big strong temple.
[01:59:38.032 --> 01:59:40.812]  With these products I take, I religiously remember to take them.
[01:59:40.812 --> 01:59:44.774]  It makes my life so much better, and then it funds the information war, which is so critical.
[01:59:44.774 --> 01:59:45.534]  Thank you so much.
[01:59:45.534 --> 01:59:46.054]  God bless you.
[01:59:49.171 --> 01:59:51.805]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:28.183 --> 02:00:29.805]  You know, I'm going to have them in post.
[02:00:29.805 --> 02:00:32.368]  We're live right now.
[02:00:32.368 --> 02:00:42.159]  Ad from Eisenhower's speech in 1961, his farewell address, where he said, they're setting up a computerized technological elite that we're going to be captives of.
[02:00:42.159 --> 02:00:43.881]  That's a close quote.
[02:00:43.881 --> 02:00:45.904]  That's a quote.
[02:00:45.904 --> 02:00:46.785]  And so you have to understand.
[02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:49.430]  I'm not making this up.
[02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:50.871]  Hey guys, can I have that NRA story?
[02:00:50.871 --> 02:00:52.512]  I had it.
[02:00:52.512 --> 02:00:53.473]  I lost it in my stack.
[02:00:53.473 --> 02:00:55.254]  I need it for the start of the next segment.
[02:00:55.254 --> 02:00:57.016]  Pretty please.
[02:00:57.016 --> 02:00:58.557]  Sugar on top.
[02:00:58.557 --> 02:01:00.058]  Everything else.
[02:01:00.058 --> 02:01:09.165]  Because what's happening is there is a move to criminalize gun ownership and the idea of buying bullets, shooting sports.
[02:01:09.165 --> 02:01:11.547]  That's why Walmart's not selling handgun ammo.
[02:01:11.547 --> 02:01:16.710]  Dick's Sporting Goods is being a real you know what and saying we're going to just stop selling everything.
[02:01:17.751 --> 02:01:23.154]  This is all being announced to create the idea and the social pressure that it's time to ban the guns.
[02:01:23.154 --> 02:01:28.418]  So I'm going to cover that next segment because there it is right there in front of me.
[02:01:28.418 --> 02:01:40.465]  I am just so flustered right now because if you go to DrugsReport.com, there's that top link that everybody should share right now that Trump is, his administration is looking at.
[02:01:41.428 --> 02:01:55.777]  Proposing all the surveillance grid, all the devices listening to you, all the systems that are controlling what we do, openly violating our Fourth Amendment and due process, being run by DARPA and the Democrats and Big Tech.
[02:01:55.777 --> 02:02:06.904]  So instead of defending us from Big Tech, instead of standing up to all of this, we're talking about totally and completely screwing us over.
[02:02:08.522 --> 02:02:30.377]  And so I didn't say that for shock effect when I said that if President Trump comes out and proposes beyond, because how are they going to do it with saying your neighbors didn't say you threatened to kill somebody, you have your guns taken for that, but you just seem upset or you don't like Hillary or whatever, so we took your guns.
[02:02:30.377 --> 02:02:33.599]  And that's what different congressmen are proposing, Democrats and Republicans.
[02:02:35.785 --> 02:02:46.267]  And so Trump says, oh, well, as long as it's computers and your Apple Watch or your iPad or your Alexa or your digital assistant, that's just beyond outrageous on so many fronts.
[02:02:46.267 --> 02:02:57.109]  The end of the process, the end of the Fourth Amendment, the end of the Fifth Amendment, the fact that we let this in our houses and it's doing it to us.
[02:02:57.109 --> 02:03:04.830]  So tomorrow, undoubtedly, I'm going to open the phones up so that we can specifically
[02:03:06.354 --> 02:03:09.897]  Sit there and take calls on this issue.
[02:03:09.897 --> 02:03:13.100]  Because this is the big issue and we should be having a debate about it.
[02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:16.063]  And thank God this audience cares.
[02:03:16.063 --> 02:03:19.726]  Thank God people like Tucker Carlson care.
[02:03:19.726 --> 02:03:24.310]  But the censorship we've seen has been so un-American and the lying to Congress.
[02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:32.578]  And then to know that the key committees are involved, the Democratic Party particularly, I documented this extensively yesterday, commanding and running the censorship
[02:03:34.505 --> 02:03:36.547]  And Trump's sitting there accepting it.
[02:03:36.547 --> 02:03:42.011]  The 5G that they admit, Wired Magazine, big studies, LA Times, yeah, increases cancer massively.
[02:03:42.011 --> 02:03:44.153]  So what?
[02:03:44.153 --> 02:03:47.456]  Let's put it on top of school.
[02:03:47.456 --> 02:03:49.818]  After all, it's the post-human era.
[02:03:49.818 --> 02:03:50.759]  Humanity, it's all over.
[02:03:50.759 --> 02:04:00.928]  Because we got it so easy, people just go, I don't care if I die, I don't care if humanity's over, until you're actually starving to death.
[02:04:00.928 --> 02:04:02.209]  The collapse of civilization.
[02:04:04.684 --> 02:04:08.287]  When you look at Paul Watson's article, we're going to cover when we come back, because it illustrates so much.
[02:04:08.287 --> 02:04:13.571]  It's a reprinted form, you pull it out of your stash stack.
[02:04:13.571 --> 02:04:15.433]  The article on Dave Chappelle.
[02:04:15.433 --> 02:04:20.817]  The critics hate Dave Chappelle, gave him a zero rating on Rotten Tomatoes for being politically incorrect.
[02:04:20.817 --> 02:04:25.160]  But then he got a 99% on the votes on Rotten Tomatoes.
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:29.404]  But that was only after protests, because they removed the right for people to even vote.
[02:04:32.492 --> 02:04:38.098]  Again, just like YouTube and Facebook is announcing they're going to get rid of the like functions.
[02:04:38.098 --> 02:04:40.341]  They don't even have that power to show what you like.
[02:04:40.341 --> 02:04:43.825]  They want to steal all your humanity, all of your human communication.
[02:04:43.825 --> 02:04:45.787]  They want robots!
[02:04:45.787 --> 02:04:49.552]  A bunch of dirty, nasty, evil, big tech, fake leftists.
[02:04:54.133 --> 02:04:58.495]  Banned.video is the answer to censorship.
[02:04:58.495 --> 02:05:14.021]  Banned.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are still available.
[02:05:14.021 --> 02:05:15.721]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:15.721 --> 02:05:17.062]  It's now live.
[02:05:17.062 --> 02:05:19.023]  Banned.video.
[02:05:19.023 --> 02:05:22.924]  Banned.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones
[02:05:24.825 --> 02:05:30.610]  We are building it to be a place where banned memes are able to be posted.
[02:05:30.610 --> 02:05:44.200]  And where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chi-coms, the Hollywood scum, and the globalists.
[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:46.442]  Freedom of speech has a home.
[02:05:46.442 --> 02:05:48.944]  It's called Banned.Video.
[02:05:48.944 --> 02:05:52.707]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at Banned.Video.
[02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:11.674]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:11.674 --> 02:06:13.955]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:06:22.025 --> 02:06:29.571]  For the last two hours, we have been breaking down the technocracy.
[02:06:29.571 --> 02:06:32.393]  And let's put the definition of technocracy, folks.
[02:06:32.393 --> 02:06:42.141]  It is a ruling oligarchy that uses technology and surveillance systems to control economies and control populations.
[02:06:42.141 --> 02:06:43.422]  It is scientific tyranny.
[02:06:44.235 --> 02:06:45.876]  In its own definitions.
[02:06:45.876 --> 02:06:53.918]  It was a 1920s and 30s idea by the communists of a technocracy creating a utopia, but its modern parlance is total control.
[02:06:53.918 --> 02:06:59.840]  A government or social system controlled by technicians, especially scientists and technical experts.
[02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:02.721]  Government by technical specialists.
[02:07:02.721 --> 02:07:08.522]  A system of governance where people who are skilled, proficient, govern in their respective areas of expertise.
[02:07:08.522 --> 02:07:11.723]  A type of meritocracy based on people's ability.
[02:07:11.723 --> 02:07:13.104]  Now that's the propaganda version.
[02:07:14.707 --> 02:07:16.188]  What does the EU call themselves?
[02:07:16.188 --> 02:07:17.608]  They call themselves a technocracy.
[02:07:17.608 --> 02:07:19.209]  They say, oh, we don't need prime ministers or presidents.
[02:07:19.209 --> 02:07:20.389]  We don't need elections.
[02:07:20.389 --> 02:07:22.150]  We have technocrats that know best.
[02:07:22.150 --> 02:07:24.111]  What does Bloomberg type this in?
[02:07:24.111 --> 02:07:28.372]  Bloomberg, the technocrat-in-chief, Bloomberg reported.
[02:07:28.372 --> 02:07:29.453]  He knows what you should eat.
[02:07:29.453 --> 02:07:30.773]  He knows where you should live.
[02:07:30.773 --> 02:07:31.834]  He knows what you should do.
[02:07:31.834 --> 02:07:33.474]  He's going to run your life.
[02:07:33.474 --> 02:07:35.415]  And it's his religion to do so.
[02:07:35.415 --> 02:07:37.216]  Well, part of this is Dave Chappelle.
[02:07:37.216 --> 02:07:39.597]  His comedy special came out.
[02:07:41.232 --> 02:07:47.875]  And I've seen Dave Chappelle on TV for, ever since he got popular 15 years ago, great comedian, very funny, on his developed comedy.
[02:07:47.875 --> 02:07:51.816]  I went and saw him in Austin, and he was testing out comedy a couple years ago.
[02:07:51.816 --> 02:07:54.097]  It was horrible.
[02:07:54.097 --> 02:07:56.118]  It was almost unwatchable.
[02:07:56.118 --> 02:07:58.279]  And that's why he was saying, don't film, don't film.
[02:07:58.279 --> 02:08:01.900]  They kept yelling at everyone for like an hour before, don't film, when he comes out.
[02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:03.821]  I got up halfway through it and left.
[02:08:03.821 --> 02:08:09.083]  That said, whether you love Dave Chappelle or hate him, he's got a right to his speech.
[02:08:12.335 --> 02:08:17.099]  He gets up there and decries political correctness and how comedy is being destroyed by it.
[02:08:17.099 --> 02:08:19.181]  He talks about Jussie Smollett, you name it.
[02:08:19.181 --> 02:08:25.806]  And so Rotten Tomatoes gives him a zero.
[02:08:25.806 --> 02:08:27.367]  Now, this went on for two days.
[02:08:27.367 --> 02:08:29.189]  Paul Watson tweeted about it.
[02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:32.031]  We'll show Paul's article up on screen for folks, please.
[02:08:32.031 --> 02:08:33.512]  We'll scroll down and I'm going to show the Twitter for folks.
[02:08:33.512 --> 02:08:33.812]  Thank you.
[02:08:33.812 --> 02:08:35.574]  Let's scroll down.
[02:08:35.574 --> 02:08:39.017]  And they weren't allowing people, there it is at first,
[02:08:40.086 --> 02:08:48.230]  To do the normal voting, you have the critics, who are the enlightened priesthood, the gods, who follow their corporate orders and get paid off to do it.
[02:08:48.230 --> 02:08:52.572]  That's now been admitted, big scandals over at Rotten Tomatoes and other places.
[02:08:52.572 --> 02:08:56.394]  And you have the unwashed masses.
[02:08:56.394 --> 02:09:00.035]  Now, for the first two days, it was at zero.
[02:09:00.035 --> 02:09:03.357]  And Paul wrote about this and shows evidence of it.
[02:09:03.357 --> 02:09:07.339]  Then, once it became evident that they'd removed the popcorn, meaning, you know, the general watchers,
[02:09:09.005 --> 02:09:13.748]  They voted 99% loving the comedy special from Netflix, so it went up a little bit.
[02:09:13.748 --> 02:09:19.411]  There was some peer pressure, so 70% of the critics after that said that.
[02:09:19.411 --> 02:09:28.116]  And again, what Paul screenshotted was once they wiped the slate clean and then relaunched a poll that had the ability for the public to vote.
[02:09:30.031 --> 02:09:34.434]  Now again, just yesterday Facebook announced they're looking to remove the like buttons.
[02:09:34.434 --> 02:09:36.215]  YouTube's testing it.
[02:09:36.215 --> 02:09:46.962]  And I keep harping on this, the fundamentalness of you have a Facebook page, you say, I took a vaccine and got really sick, or my daughter took it and had a convulsion, or my son took it and never talked again.
[02:09:46.962 --> 02:09:48.843]  That's your right to say that!
[02:09:48.843 --> 02:09:49.764]  And all the evidence is there.
[02:09:49.764 --> 02:09:54.387]  It's the right of two Fox Sports guys to say, we took the flu shot and almost died, both of us.
[02:09:55.819 --> 02:09:57.580]  Media matters are trying to get them fired.
[02:09:57.580 --> 02:10:00.962]  How dare you dirty Americans say you took something and got sick?
[02:10:00.962 --> 02:10:03.363]  Shut your filthy mouth, slave!
[02:10:03.363 --> 02:10:07.104]  Because this is the real slavery, folks.
[02:10:07.104 --> 02:10:09.505]  No matter what damn color you are, this is outrageous.
[02:10:09.505 --> 02:10:17.069]  So if you can't even like something... And most of the big newspapers, you notice, have gotten rid of the comment sections.
[02:10:18.427 --> 02:10:25.888]  You go into the Huffington Post and all these places that have these hit piece articles about me all the time, 90% of the comments all love InfoWars now.
[02:10:27.952 --> 02:10:28.973]  It needs to be like that, folks.
[02:10:28.973 --> 02:10:30.113]  It needs to be 50-50.
[02:10:30.113 --> 02:10:32.015]  People don't buy it.
[02:10:32.015 --> 02:10:32.915]  They see through it.
[02:10:32.915 --> 02:10:36.217]  So all the king's horses, all the king's men, they can't put it back together again.
[02:10:36.217 --> 02:10:44.823]  Here's a little 30-second piece where Dave Chappelle, this needs to go viral, is talking about how we're watching you, we're controlling you, we're bullies.
[02:10:44.823 --> 02:10:50.927]  You better do what the left says or we'll ruin your life from just clips this week of them saying that exact talking point.
[02:10:50.927 --> 02:10:54.870]  And for him calling it out and having the basic courage to say you guys are bullies,
[02:10:56.069 --> 02:11:01.654]  They want his show pulled from Netflix and are boycotting his comedy shows, calling it white supremacist.
[02:11:01.654 --> 02:11:02.735]  Here it is.
[02:11:02.735 --> 02:11:05.537]  What we should be doing is shunning these people.
[02:11:05.537 --> 02:11:10.081]  Shunning, shaming these people is a statement of moral indignation.
[02:11:10.081 --> 02:11:12.983]  That these people are not fit for polite society.
[02:11:12.983 --> 02:11:15.265]  I'm gonna try to take everything away from you.
[02:11:15.265 --> 02:11:16.666]  And I don't care what I find out.
[02:11:16.666 --> 02:11:19.669]  Could be today, tomorrow, 15, 20 years from now.
[02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:22.471]  If I find out, you're f***ing finished.
[02:11:22.776 --> 02:11:24.777]  They don't get to escape accountability.
[02:11:24.777 --> 02:11:28.940]  That's all of our job, to hold them accountable for the rest of their lives.
[02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:31.422]  So entertaining.
[02:11:31.422 --> 02:11:33.183]  So exactly what Dave Chappelle's saying.
[02:11:33.183 --> 02:11:34.805]  So if we're telling the truth, he's in trouble.
[02:11:34.805 --> 02:11:38.427]  Now here's four minutes of him talking about Jussie Smollett, who's up on Infowars.com.
[02:11:38.427 --> 02:11:42.050]  His lawyers say, okay, he lied, but it's the cops' fault for believing him.
[02:11:42.050 --> 02:11:43.211]  Here it is.
[02:11:43.211 --> 02:11:46.853]  Just afraid of being attacked.
[02:11:46.853 --> 02:11:47.994]  Happens to the best of us.
[02:11:47.994 --> 02:11:50.436]  Don't ever forget what happened to that French actor.
[02:11:52.398 --> 02:11:54.660]  You know who I'm talking about?
[02:11:54.660 --> 02:11:55.300]  Juicy Smooyah.
[02:11:55.300 --> 02:12:07.148]  He's a very French, very famous French actor.
[02:12:07.148 --> 02:12:11.832]  Y'all never heard of Juicy Smooyah?
[02:12:11.832 --> 02:12:14.614]  Juicy Smooyah is an actor from France.
[02:12:22.994 --> 02:12:31.387]  And he became famous on a show called Empire.
[02:12:31.387 --> 02:12:36.934]  One night, he was in Chicago late at night and was the victim.
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:51.323]  He was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.
[02:12:51.323 --> 02:13:05.954]  You see, Jussie Smollett is gay and he is black, not just French.
[02:13:05.954 --> 02:13:07.155]  Oh, it's a crazy story.
[02:13:08.370 --> 02:13:18.238]  Apparently, when he's walking down the street late at night, two white men came out of the shadows with MAGA hats on and beat him up.
[02:13:18.238 --> 02:13:24.823]  Tied a rope around his neck, called him all kinds of n****s and put some bleach on him and ran off into the night.
[02:13:27.469 --> 02:13:30.670]  This sh** was like international news.
[02:13:30.670 --> 02:13:34.131]  And everybody was furious, especially in Hollywood.
[02:13:34.131 --> 02:13:37.032]  It was all over everybody's Twitter feed and Instagram page.
[02:13:37.032 --> 02:13:43.574]  Justice for Juicy and all that sh**.
[02:13:43.574 --> 02:13:45.014]  The whole country was up in arms.
[02:13:45.014 --> 02:13:47.455]  We was talking about it all the time on the news.
[02:13:47.455 --> 02:13:52.917]  And for some reason, uh, African Americans, we were like oddly quiet.
[02:13:57.051 --> 02:14:06.720]  We were so quiet about this s*** that the gay community started accusing the African American community of being homophobic for not supporting him.
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:14.027]  What they didn't understand is that we were supporting him with our silence.
[02:14:14.027 --> 02:14:19.532]  Because we understood that this s*** was clearly lying.
[02:14:28.161 --> 02:14:32.744]  None of these details added up at all!
[02:14:32.744 --> 02:14:41.148]  He said he's walking down the street in Chicago and white dudes come up to him and say, hey man, aren't you that f***ing b***h from Empire?
[02:14:41.148 --> 02:14:42.569]  Oh f***!
[02:14:42.569 --> 02:14:47.511]  Does that sound like how white people talk?
[02:14:47.511 --> 02:14:48.452]  I know white people.
[02:14:48.452 --> 02:14:49.652]  They don't talk like that.
[02:14:49.652 --> 02:14:51.473]  Are you that f***ing b***h from Empire?
[02:14:51.473 --> 02:14:52.854]  They would never say that.
[02:14:52.854 --> 02:14:56.456]  It sounds like something that I would say.
[02:15:02.151 --> 02:15:05.994]  Oh, that's funny.
[02:15:05.994 --> 02:15:09.457]  If you're racist and homophobic, you're not even gonna know who this d**k is.
[02:15:09.457 --> 02:15:17.062]  You can't watch Empire.
[02:15:17.062 --> 02:15:20.665]  Black people never feel sorry for the police, but this time we even felt sorry for the police.
[02:15:20.665 --> 02:15:25.228]  Can you imagine if you was a police veteran taking this kid's police report?
[02:15:25.228 --> 02:15:28.891]  Okay, Mr. Smolye, please tell me what happened.
[02:15:28.891 --> 02:15:30.672]  Alright.
[02:15:30.672 --> 02:15:30.993]  2 a.m.
[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:32.701]  You left the house at 2am.
[02:15:32.701 --> 02:15:38.606]  It was minus 16 degrees.
[02:15:38.606 --> 02:15:39.666]  You were walking.
[02:15:39.666 --> 02:15:45.131]  You were walking.
[02:15:45.131 --> 02:15:45.351]  Alright.

[02:17:56.850 --> 02:17:57.891]  We're here in Hong Kong.
[02:17:57.891 --> 02:18:00.434]  This is Savannah Hernandez for InfoWars.com.
[02:18:00.434 --> 02:18:04.438]  I'm reporting to you from Hong Kong where I'm joined by reporter Greg Rees for the next week.
[02:18:04.438 --> 02:18:07.261]  This is Greg Rees for InfoWars.com in Hong Kong.
[02:18:07.261 --> 02:18:11.225]  Our recent trip to Hong Kong was a new achievement for InfoWars.com.
[02:18:12.106 --> 02:18:20.172]  Despite being the most banned broadcast in the free world, we continue to win because of our great, strong, loyal audience.
[02:18:20.172 --> 02:18:36.685]  We have Dan Lyman covering InfoWars Europe, Paul Joseph Watson in the UK, Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett in the American heartland, and from Austin, Texas, a team of reporters and crew ready to be dispatched wherever the story is going down.
[02:18:36.685 --> 02:18:40.268]  We are not done winning, and with your support, we will keep winning.
[02:18:40.828 --> 02:18:41.809]  We have to keep winning!
[02:18:41.809 --> 02:18:43.292]  We have to win more!
[02:18:43.292 --> 02:18:45.655]  Go to InfoWarStore.com.
[02:18:45.655 --> 02:18:53.787]  You have gone to InfoWarStore.com and gotten books and films, supplements and t-shirts, and water filtration, air filtration, and things you'd need!
[02:18:56.952 --> 02:19:00.675]  In the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[02:19:00.675 --> 02:19:08.821]  It is a award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[02:19:08.821 --> 02:19:10.102]  It is cold-pressed.
[02:19:10.102 --> 02:19:16.527]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild-crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[02:19:16.527 --> 02:19:17.708]  It's not boiled.
[02:19:17.708 --> 02:19:18.508]  It's not heated.
[02:19:18.508 --> 02:19:19.669]  It's never been dried.
[02:19:19.669 --> 02:19:22.171]  It's taken from fresh herbs.
[02:19:22.171 --> 02:19:24.473]  That's why it's so strong.
[02:19:24.873 --> 02:19:28.636]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.

[02:19:57.194 --> 02:20:20.325]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:20.325 --> 02:20:23.366]  Well, retired NFL
[02:20:26.956 --> 02:20:36.463]  People say, oh, it's okay, he didn't really mean it.
[02:20:36.463 --> 02:20:38.004]  He has a right to say whatever he wants.
[02:20:38.004 --> 02:20:40.286]  It's like Dave Chappelle saying.
[02:20:40.286 --> 02:20:42.848]  People always go, well, the guy was Hitler, dog.
[02:20:42.848 --> 02:20:43.549]  It was a joke.
[02:20:43.549 --> 02:20:45.990]  He shouldn't be arrested in the UK.
[02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:47.552]  It doesn't matter if it's a joke or not.
[02:20:47.552 --> 02:20:49.193]  You have a right to say you hate Nazis.
[02:20:49.193 --> 02:20:50.154]  He has a right to be one.
[02:20:50.154 --> 02:20:51.615]  He's not a Nazi.
[02:20:51.615 --> 02:20:53.056]  Carpe Donkem is pretty liberal.
[02:20:54.252 --> 02:20:55.673]  It's a joke.
[02:20:55.673 --> 02:20:58.956]  When his wife came home, he made the dog howl Hitler and it pissed her off.
[02:20:58.956 --> 02:21:00.698]  He's a liberal.
[02:21:00.698 --> 02:21:02.359]  You ever heard of pissing people off?
[02:21:02.359 --> 02:21:03.300]  Called practical jokes?
[02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:05.302]  It's some of the funniest stuff out there.
[02:21:05.302 --> 02:21:08.545]  I do it all the time at home.
[02:21:08.545 --> 02:21:09.686]  Doesn't matter though.
[02:21:09.686 --> 02:21:13.369]  The point is, is that you have a right to be offended.
[02:21:13.369 --> 02:21:14.790]  I have a right to say whatever I want.
[02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:16.712]  And my free speech doesn't end when you get offended.
[02:21:16.712 --> 02:21:18.513]  We used to have a t-shirt that was a bestseller.
[02:21:18.513 --> 02:21:20.255]  We even still sell that side issue.
[02:21:22.688 --> 02:21:25.450]  Let's get back to Dave Chappelle knocking it out of the park.
[02:21:25.450 --> 02:21:31.673]  Because the day I heard it, happened like a Saturday night, I went on there and I said, I think this is a false flag.
[02:21:31.673 --> 02:21:32.854]  Sue me if you want to.
[02:21:32.854 --> 02:21:34.075]  I have a right to say it.
[02:21:34.075 --> 02:21:41.419]  Let me tell you, there aren't two white dudes at 2.15 in the morning going up to beat up a black dude.
[02:21:41.419 --> 02:21:45.642]  I mean, that's when it's 15 below zero, like Dave Chappelle was saying.
[02:21:45.642 --> 02:21:50.605]  And then he's got a noose around his neck and a scratch on his face when the cops show up.
[02:21:52.278 --> 02:21:54.979]  I mean, give me a break, man.
[02:21:54.979 --> 02:21:56.959]  That's obviously not true.
[02:21:56.959 --> 02:22:01.100]  But they tried to sell the whole thing, just like the Covington kids, just like all of it.
[02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:02.360]  So let's go ahead and finish up with Chappelle.
[02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:04.260]  Here it is.
[02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:07.821]  Black people never feel sorry for the police, but this time we even felt sorry for the police.
[02:22:07.821 --> 02:22:12.382]  Can you imagine if you was a police veteran taking this kid's police report?
[02:22:12.382 --> 02:22:16.043]  Okay, Mr. Smolye, please tell me what happened.
[02:22:16.043 --> 02:22:17.823]  All right.
[02:22:17.823 --> 02:22:18.983]  2 a.m.
[02:22:18.983 --> 02:22:19.884]  We left the house at 2 a.m.
[02:22:19.884 --> 02:22:20.744]  It was minus 16 degrees.
[02:22:25.775 --> 02:22:26.835]  You were walking.
[02:22:26.835 --> 02:22:27.796]  You were walking.
[02:22:27.796 --> 02:22:33.181]  Yeah, not in your car.
[02:22:33.181 --> 02:22:35.824]  And where were you going?
[02:22:35.824 --> 02:22:37.805]  Subway.
[02:22:37.805 --> 02:22:38.406]  Sandwiches?
[02:22:38.406 --> 02:22:42.590]  And I know who he is in the dark.
[02:22:49.039 --> 02:22:50.680]  That's when the men approach you?
[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:52.380]  Did you see them?
[02:22:52.380 --> 02:22:54.281]  Okay, what do they have on?
[02:22:54.281 --> 02:22:56.641]  MAGA hats!
[02:22:56.641 --> 02:22:58.282]  MAGA hats on in Chicago!
[02:22:58.282 --> 02:23:01.083]  Excuse me one second, Mr. Smollett.
[02:23:01.083 --> 02:23:06.524]  Frank, come here for a second.
[02:23:06.524 --> 02:23:08.025]  Find out where Kanye West was last night.
[02:23:12.761 --> 02:23:13.461]  That's funny, yeah.
[02:23:13.461 --> 02:23:18.065]  I was about the only guy wearing a mega hat in Chicago on the South Side at night.
[02:23:18.065 --> 02:23:19.105]  Oh my gosh, it's funny.
[02:23:19.105 --> 02:23:21.187]  But it's true.
[02:23:21.187 --> 02:23:23.869]  And remember, I got attacked for saying it was fake.
[02:23:23.869 --> 02:23:25.430]  Folks, most of this stuff's fake.
[02:23:25.430 --> 02:23:27.491]  Forgetting attention.
[02:23:27.491 --> 02:23:31.093]  The FBI will tell you half the rapes of women are fake.
[02:23:31.093 --> 02:23:31.394]  Made up.
[02:23:32.406 --> 02:23:33.667]  Now, there are real men that rape women.
[02:23:33.667 --> 02:23:35.669]  You're damn right it's bad.
[02:23:35.669 --> 02:23:36.309]  I got three dollars.
[02:23:36.309 --> 02:23:36.809]  I don't like it.
[02:23:36.809 --> 02:23:45.176]  But people that make stuff up take away from the real stuff that goes on.
[02:23:45.176 --> 02:23:49.139]  Incredible new article is up on Infowars.com.
[02:23:49.139 --> 02:23:57.625]  His lawyers, I'm not kidding, Jamie White article, Jesse Smollett lawyers, even if he did lie, police to blame for taking him seriously.
[02:23:57.625 --> 02:24:00.808]  Well, by law, they have to take the police report.
[02:24:01.877 --> 02:24:11.923]  Jesse Smollett's attorneys claim that even if the Empire actor did lie about his alleged racial attack, the Chicago police are actually to blame for investigating the claim so vigorously.
[02:24:11.923 --> 02:24:13.985]  Let me tell you why he got protected.
[02:24:13.985 --> 02:24:17.607]  You got a bunch of top Obama people and Clinton people involved in the show.
[02:24:17.607 --> 02:24:20.989]  The show's made, I think the last time I checked, something like $500 million.
[02:24:20.989 --> 02:24:24.792]  They run a bunch of seasons, but it was going under.
[02:24:24.792 --> 02:24:26.272]  The ratings were down by like half.
[02:24:26.272 --> 02:24:26.673]  Look it up.
[02:24:27.628 --> 02:24:33.969]  And a story like this would get it massive coverage, and he was a big victim, and it did boost ratings.
[02:24:33.969 --> 02:24:39.491]  And so when it came out later that Smollett wanted a paycheck, people said, oh, that's not true, he wanted to create a race war.
[02:24:39.491 --> 02:24:42.011]  No, he wanted a paycheck.
[02:24:42.011 --> 02:24:50.553]  Because in America, if you can play the victim, then you get put all over the media.
[02:24:50.553 --> 02:24:52.854]  And everybody has to then tune into what you're doing.
[02:24:52.854 --> 02:24:54.734]  It's called a publicity stunt.
[02:24:56.553 --> 02:24:58.554]  And people do it all the time.
[02:24:58.554 --> 02:25:07.216]  You know, growing up, talk radio folks I'd listen to would get in trouble and fired and stuff because they do things like call in and have people say, oh, Bob just died, you know, in a car wreck.
[02:25:07.216 --> 02:25:11.177]  We're real sad on April Fool's Day.
[02:25:11.177 --> 02:25:12.137]  That was one of the last straws.
[02:25:12.137 --> 02:25:14.318]  They were trying to set me up so they could fire me.
[02:25:14.318 --> 02:25:16.979]  I had the number one talk show in Austin.
[02:25:16.979 --> 02:25:19.519]  They wanted me to say that I'd been killed for the talk.
[02:25:19.519 --> 02:25:21.420]  And I said, no.
[02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:24.641]  And they fired me like a week later.
[02:25:24.641 --> 02:25:25.781]  But they wanted to set me up.
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:31.266]  So they can say, I've staged the hoax, and then they can fire me.
[02:25:31.266 --> 02:25:32.528]  See how that works?
[02:25:32.528 --> 02:25:34.310]  So, just absolutely incredible.
[02:25:34.310 --> 02:25:36.213]  Now shifting gears to something really important here.
[02:25:38.766 --> 02:25:42.589]  California and San Francisco declare NRA a domestic terror organization.
[02:25:42.589 --> 02:25:46.472]  The Blue State, says the group, incites gun owners to commit acts of violence.
[02:25:46.472 --> 02:25:49.814]  And they're now going to file lawsuits, try to take criminal action.
[02:25:49.814 --> 02:25:59.681]  San Francisco's District 2 Superior, Catherine Stephanie, who wrote the declaration to the National Robbery Association, spreads propaganda and misinforms, and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence.
[02:25:59.681 --> 02:26:05.926]  That's the same way they sued Remington, the same law firm that works for Hillary, suing me, with Senator Blumenthal in Connecticut.
[02:26:05.926 --> 02:26:06.987]  It's saying the same stuff.
[02:26:08.331 --> 02:26:15.154]  The NRA exists to spread disinformation and only puts guns in the hands of those who would harm and terrorize us.
[02:26:15.154 --> 02:26:18.816]  They don't want to call for it to be shut down.
[02:26:18.816 --> 02:26:22.997]  Meanwhile, San Francisco works with a real terrorist, Antifa, to commit all these crimes.
[02:26:22.997 --> 02:26:30.221]  Meanwhile, Walmart plans to drastically step back from ammunition sales, banning all handgun ammo.
[02:26:30.221 --> 02:26:32.862]  And again, Dick's Sporting Goods is being real, you know what.
[02:26:33.902 --> 02:26:35.262]  Well, their name says it all.
[02:26:35.262 --> 02:26:38.183]  They are saying that they may ban all guns and all ammo sales.
[02:26:38.183 --> 02:26:39.723]  They already stopped selling semi-auto.
[02:26:39.723 --> 02:26:42.123]  They're creating the perception it's illegal.
[02:26:42.123 --> 02:26:44.544]  For years, Facebook won't take gun ads.
[02:26:44.544 --> 02:26:45.764]  Now they're going at people's bank accounts.
[02:26:45.764 --> 02:26:53.905]  The NRA, I happen to know, has to go out of a credit card processing group in Houston, paying a higher percentage even though they have perfect credit.
[02:26:53.905 --> 02:26:59.206]  So do I. Now, when they took all of our banking away for no reason, I had perfect corporate score.
[02:26:59.206 --> 02:27:00.186]  They said, the best you can get.
[02:27:00.186 --> 02:27:02.847]  Like, A double double plus.
[02:27:03.953 --> 02:27:09.218]  But they put a hate designation on the G2 in Boston on me last year and took all our bank accounts away.
[02:27:09.218 --> 02:27:12.662]  Bank accounts I've had for 20 years with perfect records.
[02:27:12.662 --> 02:27:13.943]  That's the persecution.
[02:27:13.943 --> 02:27:17.527]  That's the real discrimination against gun owners and nationalists and others.
[02:27:17.527 --> 02:27:20.790]  And Trump is sitting there letting it all happen.
[02:27:20.790 --> 02:27:21.852]  And now he has Ivanka.
[02:27:22.711 --> 02:27:34.339]  His daughter with Google and the rest of them wanting a social score with the devices in your house listening to you to report it back to DARPA and take your guns if your heart rate's too high or you sound angry in some fake algorithm.
[02:27:34.339 --> 02:27:35.800]  Forget judges and juries!
[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:38.001]  We got big tech hooked in with the NSA!
[02:27:38.001 --> 02:27:39.882]  It is the NSA.
[02:27:39.882 --> 02:27:43.305]  And Trump won't get control of it.
[02:27:43.305 --> 02:27:45.866]  He's screwing the pooch.
[02:27:45.866 --> 02:27:48.608]  I think I'm gonna get on a plane next week and go bullhorn the White House.
[02:27:48.608 --> 02:27:49.529]  Maybe Mar-a-Lago.
[02:27:50.981 --> 02:27:52.102]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:27:52.102 --> 02:27:54.444]  Yeah, Trump's a lot better than Hillary.
[02:27:54.444 --> 02:27:58.867]  But it's like, does somebody put 10 bullets in your head or 5 bullets in your head?
[02:27:58.867 --> 02:28:02.350]  If Trump won't act on this, we're screwed.
[02:28:02.350 --> 02:28:02.890]  Now, here's the deal.
[02:28:02.890 --> 02:28:05.152]  The Washington Post lies a lot.
[02:28:05.152 --> 02:28:07.754]  They say Trump's favorable and wants this.
[02:28:07.754 --> 02:28:09.495]  They do that a lot to lie.
[02:28:09.495 --> 02:28:17.822]  Problem is, I looked into Ivanka, and Trump's one of Trump's best friends that's heading this up, and I found where they were talking in 2017 about it, and Ivanka was promoting it then.
[02:28:18.701 --> 02:28:23.485]  I don't want to go after Trump's little girl, but you know what?
[02:28:23.485 --> 02:28:27.348]  My family and this country and your family comes first and I'm not selling out to crap.
[02:28:27.348 --> 02:28:29.210]  So I'm going to tell President Trump this.
[02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:31.172]  You want me to move and try to get impeachment going?
[02:28:31.172 --> 02:28:33.113]  You want the American people to turn against you?
[02:28:33.113 --> 02:28:38.938]  You keep pushing these red flag laws and you try to make it digital with big tech doing it instead of defending us from big tech and defending yourself?
[02:28:38.938 --> 02:28:42.101]  Then you deserve to lose, Trump!
[02:28:42.101 --> 02:28:44.363]  You deserve it!
[02:28:44.363 --> 02:28:45.804]  We're going to find out, aren't we?
[02:28:47.182 --> 02:28:53.344]  We'll be right back on the other side with our special guest, ex-NFL star Larry Johnson.
[02:28:53.344 --> 02:29:04.528]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:04.528 --> 02:29:11.430]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an
[02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:11.930]  I think?
[02:29:34.710 --> 02:29:35.290]  That's right.
[02:29:54.514 --> 02:30:00.656]  Super Mel Vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[02:30:00.656 --> 02:30:08.799]  It is a award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[02:30:08.799 --> 02:30:10.079]  It is cold-pressed.
[02:30:10.079 --> 02:30:16.522]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild-crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[02:30:16.522 --> 02:30:17.702]  It's not boiled.
[02:30:17.702 --> 02:30:18.482]  It's not heated.
[02:30:18.482 --> 02:30:19.663]  It's never been dried.
[02:30:19.663 --> 02:30:22.164]  It's taken from fresh herbs.
[02:30:22.164 --> 02:30:22.904]  That's why
[02:30:23.544 --> 02:30:24.865]  It's so strong.
[02:30:24.865 --> 02:30:28.628]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.

[02:31:54.417 --> 02:32:00.783]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin, it's only natural that it starts to crack and take damage.
[02:32:00.783 --> 02:32:07.669]  Wind, heat, water, and age are telltale signs that it's time to start taking care of your skin.

[02:32:56.655 --> 02:32:59.356]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:12.022 --> 02:33:12.105]  Yeah.
[02:33:20.596 --> 02:33:22.798]  Well, you can't turn on the news.
[02:33:22.798 --> 02:33:30.344]  You can't read the curriculum at public schools or libraries without hearing about the sexualization of children, whether it be homosexual or heterosexual.
[02:33:30.344 --> 02:33:30.944]  It's going on.
[02:33:30.944 --> 02:33:35.047]  They're busting all these drag queen story time people being convicted pedophiles.
[02:33:35.047 --> 02:33:42.773]  Now they have in public libraries books teaching six-year-olds how if a man wants to have sex with you in a bathroom, have sex with him.
[02:33:42.773 --> 02:33:43.974]  This is nambla.
[02:33:45.086 --> 02:33:46.707]  Literally taking over the country and the world.
[02:33:46.707 --> 02:33:51.270]  But regardless, people have the right to have a straight pride parade.
[02:33:51.270 --> 02:33:55.052]  Well, that got protested in Boston because the very existence of it is bad.
[02:33:55.052 --> 02:33:56.433]  I don't hate anybody.
[02:33:56.433 --> 02:34:04.458]  But I do not want to tune into the NFL and see a bunch of anti-gun stuff, a bunch of anti-American stuff, or a bunch of stuff about sex.
[02:34:04.458 --> 02:34:07.420]  Imagine if you tuned in and it was telling you about heterosexual sex.
[02:34:07.420 --> 02:34:10.302]  We're here to promote heterosexual sex and men and women having sex.
[02:34:11.627 --> 02:34:13.552]  You'd be like, why is it about sex?
[02:34:13.552 --> 02:34:16.600]  But if it's LGBTP, it's great.
[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:17.782]  Well, Larry A. Johnson...
[02:34:18.914 --> 02:34:26.718]  On Twitter at 2LarryJohnson7 is a Penn State standout, former two-time pro bowler and pro team for the Kansas City Chiefs and many other teams.
[02:34:26.718 --> 02:34:28.158]  I won't go over his whole great bio.
[02:34:28.158 --> 02:34:36.142]  He now spends retirement raising his daughter and sits on the board of Motivational Edge, a non-profit that uses creative arts and music as therapy for young adults.
[02:34:36.142 --> 02:34:41.065]  And the website is themotivationaledge.org.
[02:34:41.065 --> 02:34:44.286]  We'll put that up on screen for you for TV viewers and radio listeners.
[02:34:44.286 --> 02:34:45.507]  We'll give out the URL again in a moment.
[02:34:47.071 --> 02:34:48.952]  The media ran these headlines.
[02:34:48.952 --> 02:34:55.457]  Ex-NFL star Larry Johnson sounds off a supposed effeminate agenda in two sports leagues.
[02:34:55.457 --> 02:34:56.497]  And then there's a bunch of other ones.
[02:34:56.497 --> 02:34:57.278]  Well, here's the articles.
[02:34:57.278 --> 02:35:02.401]  The National Football League launches NFL Pride with Roger Goodell and league staff.
[02:35:02.401 --> 02:35:07.085]  NFL MLB to join NYC Pride March for the first time.
[02:35:07.085 --> 02:35:10.347]  NFL launches LGBT initiative NFL Pride.
[02:35:10.347 --> 02:35:11.628]  And I talked to people in Hollywood.
[02:35:12.594 --> 02:35:13.535]  Who's the famous actor?
[02:35:13.535 --> 02:35:14.156]  I forget his name.
[02:35:14.156 --> 02:35:14.596]  I've met him.
[02:35:14.596 --> 02:35:16.118]  He's an idiocracy.
[02:35:16.118 --> 02:35:18.380]  Talked about how it's like the gay mafia.
[02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:20.362]  Like men would grab his genitals.
[02:35:20.362 --> 02:35:23.085]  And, you know, and how that something goes on in Los Angeles.
[02:35:23.085 --> 02:35:24.847]  I haven't been in many movies.
[02:35:24.847 --> 02:35:26.048]  That happened to me a couple times.
[02:35:26.048 --> 02:35:27.509]  And I said, I'm about to beat your ass.
[02:35:27.509 --> 02:35:28.310]  What is this?
[02:35:28.310 --> 02:35:29.451]  Oh, don't worry about it.
[02:35:29.451 --> 02:35:30.553]  These producers and people.
[02:35:33.302 --> 02:35:34.163]  Yeah, put it on screen.
[02:35:34.163 --> 02:35:35.064]  Your mic's distorted.
[02:35:35.064 --> 02:35:36.966]  Yeah, Terry Crews.
[02:35:36.966 --> 02:35:37.587]  That's Terry Crews.
[02:35:37.587 --> 02:35:39.850]  He plays the president in Idiocracy and all that stuff.
[02:35:39.850 --> 02:35:42.794]  And you know, it was all, you know, be a man, suck it up, take it.
[02:35:44.107 --> 02:35:45.728]  Well, when it happens to women, it's a bad thing.
[02:35:45.728 --> 02:35:50.711]  But why is it when there's this whole, quote, gay agenda, by the left, we're supposed to put up with it?
[02:35:50.711 --> 02:35:52.752]  And again, I don't hate anybody, genuinely.
[02:35:52.752 --> 02:35:55.593]  But I do see the agenda, where you're not supposed to question it.
[02:35:55.593 --> 02:35:59.856]  And so they acted like Larry A. Johnson was crazy, putting out a few tweets about this.
[02:35:59.856 --> 02:36:00.976]  So I thought we would have him.
[02:36:00.976 --> 02:36:02.978]  Here's actually hear what he had to say.
[02:36:02.978 --> 02:36:04.899]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[02:36:04.899 --> 02:36:06.720]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:07.920]  Well, start at the beginning.
[02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:10.662]  Why you're concerned, what you've seen with the NFL, why you're speaking out.
[02:36:11.946 --> 02:36:15.909]  I'm speaking out because the league has changed drastically.
[02:36:15.909 --> 02:36:17.991]  It's become more of a passing league.
[02:36:17.991 --> 02:36:23.255]  And we want to expect that they're doing this to save wear and tear of athletes.
[02:36:23.255 --> 02:36:30.540]  But as you've seen in previous years, they spent millions and millions of dollars to keep CTE away from international football, league football.
[02:36:30.540 --> 02:36:32.342]  So it can't be because they care for the players.
[02:36:33.075 --> 02:36:41.462]  I think if you look at the commercials, now on the exception of some guys like JJ Y, he is the man's man of the NFL.
[02:36:41.462 --> 02:36:45.966]  And there is no commercial that you will ever show or see him doing anything effeminate.
[02:36:45.966 --> 02:36:59.237]  Now, when you got Cam Newton and you see the flamboyant way he dresses, yeah, he may not be gay, but he's using his heterosexuality to kind of reel in guys to make them say, oh, effeminate culture is cool then.
[02:36:59.237 --> 02:37:00.878]  We can all gravitate to it.
[02:37:01.198 --> 02:37:01.599]  We're good to go.
[02:37:15.419 --> 02:37:16.881]  The African American players.
[02:37:16.881 --> 02:37:18.122]  It's not happening to the white players.
[02:37:18.122 --> 02:37:20.325]  You'll never see Tom Brady selling cupcakes.
[02:37:20.325 --> 02:37:25.051]  You'll never see Tom Brady go to the Met Gala like Odell Beckham did in a skirt.
[02:37:25.051 --> 02:37:32.080]  And then when asked, you know, what was his sexuality, he gave a, you know, it's up in the air type of answer.
[02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:33.802]  And they're always promoting this to keep
[02:37:35.035 --> 02:37:49.546]  So that's why when you get the Gillette ad, which they signed a five-year extension with the NFL, that whole woke ad, that $8 million that they lost, they didn't even care about it because they see the bigger picture of it's going to happen regardless if they make money or not.
[02:37:49.546 --> 02:37:57.051]  And that's why you saw a black man doing a trans ad and not a white one is because we are the culture right now that's in the
[02:37:58.032 --> 02:38:00.614]  That's in the sporting events right now.
[02:38:00.614 --> 02:38:03.757]  So we have to convince each other that this is okay.
[02:38:03.757 --> 02:38:07.781]  We always have to promote sex and now we promote sex and it's okay.
[02:38:07.781 --> 02:38:13.606]  You're basically showing children that you can do whatever you want and it's not necessarily about the game anymore.
[02:38:15.137 --> 02:38:24.745]  So the media spun it that you're being anti-quote gay, but really what you're saying is there's a whole agenda to feminize men and to say that manly men are somehow dirty and bad.
[02:38:24.745 --> 02:38:32.091]  These Gillette ads, a man says, man, that's a good looking girl and goes to talk to her and that's basically rape.
[02:38:32.091 --> 02:38:37.315]  And of course, like you said, they lost $8 billion, but it's such a weird mission, such a cult.
[02:38:37.315 --> 02:38:38.856]  They said, we don't care.
[02:38:38.856 --> 02:38:40.057]  We're going to do it anyways.
[02:38:40.057 --> 02:38:40.898]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:38:41.909 --> 02:38:44.552]  I mean, like I said, it's always by emasculating males.
[02:38:44.552 --> 02:38:46.895]  It's not even just in sports and football.
[02:38:46.895 --> 02:38:47.636]  It's in the movies.
[02:38:47.636 --> 02:38:49.098]  It's in children's movies.
[02:38:49.098 --> 02:38:57.508]  I watch movies like the Lego movie with my daughter, and they're set out to emasculate strong male characters and say, well, the woman can do it better, or the woman can do it softer.
[02:38:57.508 --> 02:38:58.790]  Look at The Incredibles.
[02:38:58.790 --> 02:39:00.152]  They basically, in the hood.
[02:39:00.752 --> 02:39:04.695]  Poor Robert Parley, he emasculated him so he stayed at home and the mom went out and did the job.
[02:39:04.695 --> 02:39:06.276]  Which I have no problem with that.
[02:39:06.276 --> 02:39:08.218]  But if you're doing it at nauseam... But it was in a movie.
[02:39:08.218 --> 02:39:12.781]  Gamergate was an order to only have women in positions of leadership.
[02:39:12.781 --> 02:39:13.942]  It's in the Pentagon now.
[02:39:13.942 --> 02:39:15.723]  It's a thing to make men obsolete.
[02:39:15.723 --> 02:39:17.745]  And the left says everywhere, men are obsolete.
[02:39:17.745 --> 02:39:18.866]  It's an attack on men.
[02:39:20.515 --> 02:39:21.055]  I think so.
[02:39:39.853 --> 02:39:46.316]  Sooner or later, we're going to be watching ESPN Draft, and you're going to see two men make out, and we're going to be like, oh, that's what it is.
[02:39:46.316 --> 02:39:53.018]  There's nothing wrong with that, if you think something's wrong with that, but that's what... But they're force-feeding it everywhere.
[02:39:53.018 --> 02:39:53.458]  Everywhere.
[02:39:53.458 --> 02:39:54.939]  It's everywhere.
[02:39:54.939 --> 02:40:02.422]  And my kids can have a chance to make up their minds, but you're not making up their minds if you're showing them every time it's on TV an example of what it is.
[02:40:03.168 --> 02:40:04.429]  Well, I gotta say this.
[02:40:04.429 --> 02:40:08.610]  I'm really a fan of your courage and what you're doing.
[02:40:08.610 --> 02:40:11.691]  Plus, you're extremely well-spoken on these issues.
[02:40:11.691 --> 02:40:13.812]  Are there any other major league players you know?
[02:40:13.812 --> 02:40:16.233]  You talk about what's happening in the NBA.
[02:40:16.233 --> 02:40:21.715]  I mean, it's any movie I watch, any show, it's like every movie, the woman's the hero, the guy's an idiot.
[02:40:21.715 --> 02:40:28.418]  And it goes back to directives that came out in the 70s, like Archie Bunker's a moron, married with children, that guy's a moron.
[02:40:28.638 --> 02:40:33.451]  Every man's a moron, every woman's a genius to literally break up the family.
[02:40:33.451 --> 02:40:34.695]  There's an admitted agenda here.
[02:40:35.583 --> 02:40:38.244]  And it doesn't mean you have to be NBA players or gay.
[02:40:38.244 --> 02:40:41.804]  But when you look at, remember the Allen Iverson rule where they had to make guys put suits on?
[02:40:41.804 --> 02:40:43.485]  You had to come in like it was a business.
[02:40:43.485 --> 02:40:49.226]  Now, if you watch those guys walk into the stadium, it's like a resort tour fashion show.
[02:40:49.226 --> 02:40:50.966]  No one's dressing like they're going for business.
[02:40:50.966 --> 02:40:55.527]  Everybody's dressing like they're going on vacation to, or go to a cons festival.
[02:40:55.527 --> 02:40:56.747]  That's how these guys are dressing.
[02:40:56.747 --> 02:41:00.628]  And they want grown heterosexual men to look at this like, this doesn't belong with them.
[02:41:00.628 --> 02:41:04.269]  By the way, statistically, you're absolutely right, women want
[02:41:05.009 --> 02:41:10.373]  Powerful, aggressive, hard-working alpha males, especially feminists and all the rest of them.
[02:41:10.373 --> 02:41:17.639]  So they're training men to act like something that women are going to reject, which again is all about population reduction.
[02:41:17.639 --> 02:41:19.761]  And I don't bring this up because you're black, it's just a fact.
[02:41:19.761 --> 02:41:26.326]  LBJ, because you had, and I was against segregation, but segregation made a lot of the communities very strong, had their own businesses.
[02:41:26.326 --> 02:41:31.170]  LBJ brought in a thing to say, women, we'll give you money, but don't have men in the house.
[02:41:31.170 --> 02:41:32.551]  And then you saw what it did to that community.
[02:41:32.551 --> 02:41:34.072]  Well, it's happening to everybody right now.
[02:41:34.372 --> 02:41:37.375]  And it's a sickening evil agenda.
[02:41:37.375 --> 02:41:39.597]  It's all the plan and plot to get to the children.
[02:41:39.597 --> 02:41:40.798]  To be pedophiles for children.
[02:41:40.798 --> 02:41:41.418]  That's all it is.
[02:41:41.418 --> 02:41:44.261]  You take the man out of the household.
[02:41:44.261 --> 02:41:47.204]  There is no fin for the mother to have anybody to come watch the guy.
[02:41:47.204 --> 02:41:50.627]  That's why child support, the guys are in jail for child support.
[02:41:50.627 --> 02:41:57.453]  That's why it's always that separation of the man from the family so you can go right to the children and be able to indoctrinate the children with whatever you want them to watch.
[02:41:58.413 --> 02:41:59.054]  Wow!
[02:41:59.054 --> 02:42:07.643]  Man, I tell ya, I want to come back with our guest, Larry Johnson, and continue to talk to him, because he is taking on the beast.
[02:42:07.643 --> 02:42:14.870]  They told us last year before we were deplatformed, they said, don't talk about radical Islam, and don't talk about the trans movement and the kids.
[02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:16.772]  And I said, go to hell.
[02:42:16.772 --> 02:42:21.357]  And they have put us through hell, but that's okay, because folks, they're now having drag queen story time.
[02:42:21.897 --> 02:42:25.038]  Where the kids actually ride on the men's jocks.
[02:42:25.038 --> 02:42:32.160]  They have stuff, I can't even say on air, for children's books that teach kids that if a man wants to have sex with you, do it.
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:33.540]  It's beyond criminal.
[02:42:33.540 --> 02:42:36.161]  And our guest is knocking it out of the park.
[02:42:36.161 --> 02:42:39.342]  What he did was great in the NFL, but this is 100 times more heroic.
[02:42:39.342 --> 02:42:43.043]  Our guest, you can follow him at TheMotivationalEdge.org.
[02:42:43.043 --> 02:42:45.084]  Larry Johnson, former NFL star.
[02:42:45.084 --> 02:42:45.704]  Stay with us.
[02:42:45.704 --> 02:42:48.125]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:42:48.125 --> 02:42:48.605]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:53.484 --> 02:42:59.645]  Supermel Vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[02:42:59.645 --> 02:43:07.787]  It is a award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[02:43:07.787 --> 02:43:09.067]  It is cold-pressed.
[02:43:09.067 --> 02:43:15.508]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild-crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[02:43:15.508 --> 02:43:16.668]  It's not boiled.
[02:43:16.668 --> 02:43:17.469]  It's not heated.
[02:43:17.469 --> 02:43:18.629]  It's never been dried.
[02:43:18.629 --> 02:43:19.789]  It's taken from fresh
[02:43:20.349 --> 02:43:21.149]  Herbs.
[02:43:21.149 --> 02:43:23.851]  That's why it's so strong.
[02:43:23.851 --> 02:43:27.612]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.
[02:43:27.612 --> 02:43:41.598]  And I'm so excited about Supramel Vitality and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with every order of Supramel Vitality a 25% off a free bottle of Carnivore Digestive Enzyme.
[02:43:41.598 --> 02:43:43.039]  We're going to sell out of this very quickly.
[02:43:43.499 --> 02:43:47.847]  But it's an offer so that you experience how amazing both these products are.

[02:43:54.386 --> 02:43:59.549]  It's been a year since InfoWars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[02:43:59.549 --> 02:44:07.473]  We had over 5 million views when we got banned, and we're credited with getting Donald Trump elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[02:44:07.473 --> 02:44:15.457]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable to block the signal.
[02:44:15.457 --> 02:44:16.497]  And it's now here.

[02:44:56.488 --> 02:44:59.852]  I've been so busy, I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[02:44:59.852 --> 02:45:01.093]  But it's very exciting.
[02:45:01.093 --> 02:45:03.415]  It's super silver skin cream.
[02:45:03.415 --> 02:45:04.917]  It's got all of these benefits.
[02:45:04.917 --> 02:45:06.018]  Too many to mention.
[02:45:06.018 --> 02:45:07.279]  But it's revolutionary.
[02:45:07.279 --> 02:45:08.240]  It's brand new.
[02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:09.061]  People are going to love it.
[02:45:09.061 --> 02:45:11.223]  Introducing the new super silver skin cream.

[02:46:00.467 --> 02:46:04.490]  I'm reporting to you from Hong Kong where I'm joined by reporter Greg Reese for the next week.
[02:46:04.490 --> 02:46:07.291]  This is Greg Reese for InfoWars.com in Hong Kong.
[02:46:07.291 --> 02:46:12.174]  Our recent trip to Hong Kong was a new achievement for InfoWars.com.
[02:46:12.174 --> 02:46:20.238]  Despite being the most banned broadcast in the free world, we continue to win because of our great, strong, loyal audience.
[02:46:20.238 --> 02:46:22.980]  We have Dan Lyman covering InfoWars Europe.
[02:46:23.460 --> 02:46:25.983]  Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[02:46:25.983 --> 02:46:29.567]  Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett in the American heartland.
[02:46:29.567 --> 02:46:36.735]  And from Austin, Texas, a team of reporters and crew ready to be dispatched wherever the story is going down.
[02:46:36.735 --> 02:46:40.459]  We are not done winning, and with your support, we will keep winning.

[02:46:43.362 --> 02:46:45.705]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:45.705 --> 02:46:57.719]  You have gone to Infowarsstore.com and gotten books and films, supplements and t-shirts, and water filtration, air filtration, and things you need!
[02:46:57.719 --> 02:47:00.402]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.255 --> 02:47:21.577]  Alright folks, final segment in the third hour.
[02:47:21.577 --> 02:47:24.020]  I want to invite Larry A. Johnson back.
[02:47:24.020 --> 02:47:26.042]  This guy's on fire for exposing what's happening.
[02:47:26.042 --> 02:47:36.952]  I noticed on his Twitter, the number 2, Larry Johnson 7, that you see this new religion in Europe and Australia and the U.S.
[02:47:36.952 --> 02:47:42.478]  and Canada where you bring little children to sit in big fat men's laps wearing clown outfits
[02:47:43.730 --> 02:47:58.486]  And then they talk about sex with your children and then a lot of that ends up work with NAMBLA and we've got all the footage we can show you of just stuff that is that is just absolutely unbelievable that's unfolding and it's targeting.
[02:47:59.517 --> 02:48:01.038]  And it's happening.
[02:48:01.038 --> 02:48:06.842]  And if a man came up to your children and said, shake your booty in the park, you know, there'd be a problem.
[02:48:06.842 --> 02:48:10.765]  But if it's going on in America, it's supposedly, you know, a great thing.
[02:48:10.765 --> 02:48:12.626]  And people take their kids to be part of this.
[02:48:12.626 --> 02:48:13.427]  They come to the meetings.
[02:48:13.427 --> 02:48:17.109]  They say, we're here to indoctrinate your children.
[02:48:17.109 --> 02:48:19.111]  The children get really scared and try to pull away.
[02:48:19.111 --> 02:48:24.334]  A lot of this I can't even show you where the men come to some of these events with glitter on their genitals.
[02:48:24.334 --> 02:48:25.115]  So Larry A. Johnson,
[02:48:26.517 --> 02:48:31.767]  In the world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act, as George Orwell said.
[02:48:31.767 --> 02:48:34.312]  What made you hit your breaking point to start going public with this?
[02:48:36.007 --> 02:48:37.048]  I have a child.
[02:48:37.048 --> 02:48:39.611]  And it's not just my child.
[02:48:39.611 --> 02:48:45.157]  I work with children, I've been around children, and I've seen children who come from foster homes, homeless shelters.
[02:48:45.157 --> 02:48:46.719]  They need all the guidance they can get.
[02:48:46.719 --> 02:48:50.804]  These poor children don't have the foundation that I brought up with.
[02:48:50.804 --> 02:48:54.047]  I want to see those children make those decisions for themselves.
[02:48:54.047 --> 02:48:55.949]  If that's what they want to do, then do it.
[02:48:55.949 --> 02:48:57.090]  But I shouldn't have to see
[02:48:57.771 --> 02:49:04.033]  Drag queens getting thrown dollar bills and stripping on top of library desktops.
[02:49:04.033 --> 02:49:05.413]  That's not what education is.
[02:49:05.413 --> 02:49:06.674]  That's not what love is.
[02:49:06.674 --> 02:49:10.175]  And these kids aren't supposed to know about this stuff at a young age.
[02:49:10.175 --> 02:49:12.755]  These kids barely know who they are themselves.
[02:49:12.755 --> 02:49:17.497]  So don't show them something that they may regret later on in life or may not.
[02:49:17.497 --> 02:49:17.917]  Who knows?
[02:49:18.237 --> 02:49:27.401]  But the bottom line is we're funneling children, the government and the media is funneling children in to be sexualized by men wearing disguises.
[02:49:27.401 --> 02:49:28.342]  They aren't even drag queens.
[02:49:28.342 --> 02:49:31.263]  These are clown disguises.
[02:49:31.263 --> 02:49:32.243]  And that's what they want to do.
[02:49:32.243 --> 02:49:36.906]  They want to make it so normal so a kid could walk down the street one day and don't get candy.
[02:49:36.906 --> 02:49:40.447]  He's just gone forever because he's seen a drag queen come out of nowhere.
[02:49:40.447 --> 02:49:42.368]  And that's what we're hyping up.
[02:49:42.368 --> 02:49:46.270]  We're hyping this type of mentality that it's okay to be like this around children.
[02:49:48.595 --> 02:49:49.737]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:49:49.737 --> 02:49:54.603]  And again, a lot of these guys totally cover their faces with paint like clowns because they're convicted pedophiles.
[02:49:54.603 --> 02:49:55.945]  It is just unbelievably sick.
[02:49:57.662 --> 02:49:59.463]  You're not even doing background checks.
[02:49:59.463 --> 02:50:04.304]  Guys getting background checks, going underneath the rug, and just guys coming into libraries.
[02:50:04.304 --> 02:50:08.606]  And because parents want to seem like, I want to be woke, I want to be acceptance to everything.
[02:50:08.606 --> 02:50:10.387]  They're not.
[02:50:10.387 --> 02:50:17.369]  Their child's mentality growing, maturing into a thought when they bring these children into these type of arenas.
[02:50:17.369 --> 02:50:22.251]  And I'm not saying, maybe some of them have good intentions for doing this, but most of the time,
[02:50:22.811 --> 02:50:24.432]  It comes from a place of hurt.
[02:50:24.432 --> 02:50:38.122]  These guys that are doing this, they come from when they were abused or molested, and they haven't, you know, conquered their demons yet, and so they want to project their emotions and mentality off on children who are just now coming into this world, finding out who they are.
[02:50:39.076 --> 02:50:58.798]  Well it's it's it's sick and we see all the Catholic Church stuff and we see all the big things the Boy Scouts were just three years ago they were handing out condoms at the Jamboree and now we learn six seven eight year old boys are having sex with adult men at these in mass and the Boy Scouts is going to go bankrupt now because they're so woke that they have giant pedophile orgies.
[02:51:00.097 --> 02:51:03.438]  And then Kansas City Star, that came out, a story that went underneath the radar.
[02:51:03.438 --> 02:51:16.544]  Kansas City Star published a story, I think it was a 6 or 7 or 11 part series story, where they talk about Catholic priests who are homosexual or dying of AIDS and say that they are the almost highest rate right now of dying from AIDS.
[02:51:16.544 --> 02:51:24.248]  Catholic priests, priests who are around children most of the time, priests who are supposed to teach the Word of God, are in the hospital dying of AIDS.
[02:51:24.248 --> 02:51:24.828]  And this is not
[02:51:25.388 --> 02:51:26.488]  This is society.
[02:51:26.488 --> 02:51:27.149]  I grew up there.
[02:51:27.149 --> 02:51:30.069]  Maybe I didn't see it, but this is something that no one's talking about.
[02:51:30.069 --> 02:51:36.291]  No one's even mentioning it anymore because they're more concerned about somebody coming out against the LGBTQ community.
[02:51:36.291 --> 02:51:42.512]  No one's saying they hate you or whatever like that because if you're a Christian or you believe in God, you know where their story headed.
[02:51:42.512 --> 02:51:46.433]  I feel sorry for most of them.
[02:51:46.433 --> 02:51:48.414]  Well again, they're literally wearing
[02:51:50.339 --> 02:51:52.142]  Clown outfits to disguise themselves.
[02:51:52.142 --> 02:51:56.229]  And if we don't stand up to this, we won't stand up to anything.
[02:51:56.229 --> 02:51:57.391]  What else are you planning to do?
[02:51:57.391 --> 02:51:59.856]  Are other people formerly in the NFL willing to join you?
[02:51:59.856 --> 02:52:03.162]  Or are they all just going to sit there like cowards and just hand our children over to these people?
[02:52:04.161 --> 02:52:22.748]  Well, they can open up a thousand schools, they can give kids away a thousand book bags and pencils, but if you do not stand for children who one day won't be able to use those pencils and book bags, who won't be able to want to go to school anymore because they're so demoralized and traumatized from this type of behavior, then that's on you.
[02:52:22.748 --> 02:52:30.691]  I'm trying to raise an awareness and say not it can only happen to your kids, but it's happening to kids all over the world that have no choice, that have no one to speak for them.
[02:52:30.911 --> 02:52:34.436]  They have no one to take this bull in the horns and say, look, this is not okay.
[02:52:34.436 --> 02:52:37.982]  Let children be children and enjoy their childhood.
[02:52:37.982 --> 02:52:41.768]  I gotta say, you're a great motivational speaker and you need your own talk show.
[02:52:41.768 --> 02:52:43.150]  Let me guess, I bet you've got a talk show.
[02:52:45.834 --> 02:52:50.916]  Well, you're welcome here anytime you want to co-host or come on or guest host because you definitely know what you're talking about.
[02:52:50.916 --> 02:52:59.521]  This is a planned agenda to go after our children to lower the age of consent, to lower the age of consent for vaccines, for everything.
[02:52:59.521 --> 02:53:04.783]  The system wants to get them while they're young and it's just totally evil.
[02:53:04.783 --> 02:53:08.645]  This is really a rite of passage in the left now to sexualize children.
[02:53:08.645 --> 02:53:09.666]  It's just an incredible evil.
[02:53:11.129 --> 02:53:16.492]  It's hard to kind of separate because it's not just the drag queens who are involved.
[02:53:16.492 --> 02:53:18.353]  It's regular people you see on the street.
[02:53:18.353 --> 02:53:19.314]  It's your next door neighbor.
[02:53:19.314 --> 02:53:20.635]  That's what you have to see.
[02:53:20.635 --> 02:53:25.678]  And the reason why they keep this culture relevant is look at the Netflix shows.
[02:53:25.678 --> 02:53:29.280]  They have shows that make it seem that being a pedophile is okay.
[02:53:29.280 --> 02:53:30.360]  Then look at the victims.
[02:53:30.360 --> 02:53:33.102]  They can come out and talk about it without breaking down crying.
[02:53:33.102 --> 02:53:34.843]  Like Abducted in Plain Sight.
[02:53:34.843 --> 02:53:36.324]  That was basically a pedophile
[02:53:36.864 --> 02:53:37.984]  Puff film.
[02:53:37.984 --> 02:53:41.565]  It's to get you thinking that everybody came out on the end of it okay.
[02:53:41.565 --> 02:53:42.725]  So it's okay to have.
[02:53:42.725 --> 02:53:46.586]  You look at music videos from Lil Tricky or whatever his name is.
[02:53:46.586 --> 02:53:52.807]  He had a whole scene of cartoon characters who were doing really homosexual, subjective stuff.
[02:53:52.807 --> 02:53:55.008]  And these are kids who are always on YouTube.
[02:53:55.008 --> 02:53:56.408]  I go to dinner with my daughter.
[02:53:56.408 --> 02:54:02.029]  I see four or five kids with eyepads on YouTube watching whatever they want to watch while their parents are not paying attention to them.
[02:54:02.029 --> 02:54:04.430]  This is the content that we have to guard our children against.
[02:54:06.567 --> 02:54:16.252]  And again, folks, Get the Clown isn't real, but real people dressed up like Get the Clown are preparing your children, testing them, so that they will then go with adults and have sex and not say anything.
[02:54:16.252 --> 02:54:17.333]  It came out in Australia.
[02:54:17.333 --> 02:54:21.575]  It's a US-published book by folks involved with Obama, where they teach six-year-olds.
[02:54:21.575 --> 02:54:29.019]  It's porn stories of six- and seven-year-olds, you know, the first time an adult got them in the bathroom at the park and had sex with them, and how wonderful it was.
[02:54:29.019 --> 02:54:33.462]  And the kids are reading this in public schools, how when a man wants you to get in the white van, do it.
[02:54:33.962 --> 02:54:39.525]  So you cannot make up the pure, absolute, satanic evil that we're dealing with here.
[02:54:39.525 --> 02:54:40.406]  And it's just incredible.
[02:54:40.406 --> 02:54:44.048]  Larry A. Johnson, you know, a retired two-time pro bowler.
[02:54:44.048 --> 02:54:46.169]  And look, I used to love football, used to really get into it.
[02:54:46.169 --> 02:54:50.632]  But as soon as I learned about all this 20-something years ago, I couldn't get into that anymore.
[02:54:50.632 --> 02:54:55.175]  Not that football's bad, but getting excited and caring about it, when meanwhile we know all of this is going on.
[02:54:55.495 --> 02:55:04.537]  And I think you would probably agree, Larry, the NFL's great and it helps you make a lot of money so you can now have a bigger platform, but wouldn't you say the work you're doing now is more important than the NFL?
[02:55:05.595 --> 02:55:11.357]  This is why I feel like I need to use my platform more, because I want to speak out against these things.
[02:55:11.357 --> 02:55:15.278]  They want to blind you with the so-called Jay-Z and Meek Mill deal.
[02:55:15.278 --> 02:55:23.800]  It's the deal that you basically are signing yourself up to donate money for the community by buying songs, buying t-shirts.
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:24.740]  What does it do?
[02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:27.341]  Do you see the receipts for anything they're going to do in the community?
[02:55:27.341 --> 02:55:34.003]  These kids are being traumatized, raped, molested, sex trafficked, and this is the top problem in America right now.
[02:55:35.223 --> 02:55:37.586]  That's the Senate report that under Obama particularly
[02:55:50.783 --> 02:55:54.144]  Record numbers of kids disappeared and went into sex trafficking.
[02:55:54.144 --> 02:55:57.746]  They tell the Border Patrol, don't even check who they're with, they're not even with their parents.
[02:55:57.746 --> 02:56:06.210]  Larry A. Johnson, it's clear you've got a lot to say at Twitter to the number two, LarryJohnson7, TheMotivationalEdge.org.
[02:56:06.210 --> 02:56:12.812]  Please, come back and join us again and obviously we'll post this video later at Infowars.com.
[02:56:12.812 --> 02:56:16.134]  Feel free to use that however you want so you can reach out to more people.
[02:56:16.134 --> 02:56:18.915]  Again, we salute you and thank you for standing up for the innocents.
[02:56:20.024 --> 02:56:20.865]  Thank you for having me over.
[02:56:20.865 --> 02:56:21.806]  I really appreciate it.
[02:56:21.806 --> 02:56:23.007]  Thank you, sir.
[02:56:23.007 --> 02:56:23.847]  Wow.
[02:56:23.847 --> 02:56:26.109]  I'm glad that our producer's got that fella set up.
[02:56:26.109 --> 02:56:28.992]  And there's so many people out there speaking out against this.
[02:56:28.992 --> 02:56:31.134]  They get demonized and get told to shut up.
[02:56:31.134 --> 02:56:32.855]  But we're not going to shut up.
[02:56:32.855 --> 02:56:43.184]  If I told you 20 years ago that there'd be men dressed up like clowns in every city and every town, indoctrinating children, having them sit on their laps, have them ride horsey.
[02:56:43.184 --> 02:56:45.266]  I mean, my daughters, when they're little, they ride on my knee.
[02:56:46.803 --> 02:56:51.759]  Imagine if you saw a dad, you went to visit somebody and they had their daughter riding on their crotch.
[02:56:51.759 --> 02:56:52.662]  But I can show you the video.
[02:56:53.834 --> 02:56:57.435]  And these weird women bring their kids and do this and they get off on it, man.
[02:56:57.435 --> 02:57:02.057]  These big, fat, gross men with clown outfits hump your kids.
[02:57:02.057 --> 02:57:05.739]  I mean, you cannot make up how sick and evil this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:05.739 --> 02:57:11.021]  And this is the Democratic Party, this is the globalists, and everybody's so intimidated by the media they won't speak out against it.
[02:57:11.021 --> 02:57:12.561]  The media means nothing!
[02:57:12.561 --> 02:57:15.102]  They have no power except the power you give them!
[02:57:15.102 --> 02:57:18.444]  The only fear we have to fear is fear itself.
[02:57:18.444 --> 02:57:21.405]  I'm going to cover this big story where they attacked myself and
[02:57:24.008 --> 02:57:29.050]  Ben Shapiro, strangely enough, in the New Republic.
[02:57:29.050 --> 02:57:30.511]  It's pretty funny, actually.
[02:57:30.511 --> 02:57:32.592]  They even did an audiobook kind of thing with it.
[02:57:32.592 --> 02:57:36.474]  So we're going to talk about that and then a bunch of key reports.
[02:57:36.474 --> 02:57:40.656]  And we're going to go back a few years ago when I laid out this whole surveillance grid that Drudge Report is top-linked to right now.
[02:57:43.169 --> 02:57:45.291]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:57:45.291 --> 02:57:46.432]  Alex, God bless you.
[02:57:46.432 --> 02:57:49.034]  I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt.
[02:57:49.034 --> 02:57:54.999]  Instead of, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[02:57:54.999 --> 02:57:55.680]  Ooh, yeah.
[02:57:55.680 --> 02:57:57.021]  Showing your brain getting fried.
[02:57:57.021 --> 02:57:58.882]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[02:57:58.882 --> 02:57:59.923]  Totally changed my life.
[02:57:59.923 --> 02:58:02.966]  I use TurboForce, BODY, AlphaPower, BrainForce.
[02:58:03.166 --> 02:58:03.547]  We're good.
[02:58:18.443 --> 02:58:20.805]  All of these things are known to be incredible.
[02:58:20.805 --> 02:58:27.591]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil, or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[02:58:27.591 --> 02:58:30.114]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.
[02:58:30.114 --> 02:58:33.256]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation.
[02:58:33.256 --> 02:58:35.038]  Now you can build the big strong temple.
[02:58:35.038 --> 02:58:39.001]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better.
[02:58:39.001 --> 02:58:41.824]  And then it funds the information war, which is so critical.
[02:58:41.824 --> 02:58:42.604]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:42.604 --> 02:58:43.045]  God bless you.
[02:58:45.216 --> 02:58:54.803]  There are only a few days left for you to get DNA Force Plus at 50% off and get a free bottle of Carnivore 90 for free.
[02:58:54.803 --> 02:59:04.590]  That's 90 powerful enzyme capsules designed to help you digest and absorb protein and fat and to clean out your guts in a healthy way.
[02:59:04.870 --> 02:59:09.131]  DNA Force Plus is our flagship product and needs no introduction.
[02:59:09.131 --> 02:59:15.933]  But Carnivore is so amazing that I want to offer you a free bottle of it so you can experience how great it is.
[02:59:15.933 --> 02:59:20.794]  We will be out of Carnivore in just the next week or so at current sales levels.
[02:59:20.794 --> 02:59:23.735]  I'm doing this because it's such an important product for people.
[02:59:23.735 --> 02:59:28.216]  I want those of you on the fence to experience it like so many others have.
[02:59:28.216 --> 02:59:28.616]  So again,
[02:59:29.196 --> 02:59:34.819]  We are running this special as long as our stock of Carnivore 90 is still here.

[02:59:47.166 --> 02:59:49.848]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:59.955 --> 03:00:24.893]  Alright, DrugsReport.com is still top link to that Paul Joseph Watson article that also has the live feed of this show in it for new people to wake up to what's happening about the incredible information that Trump is considering a social
[03:00:27.285 --> 03:00:28.486]  I mean, this is just beyond 1984.
[03:00:28.486 --> 03:00:34.310]  And this fourth hour today, I want to air some of the previous reports we did on this, warning of it and breaking it down.
[03:00:34.310 --> 03:00:42.274]  But first, I'm going to get into the breakdown of society and what's really causing these mass murders and bizarre behavior that we're seeing increase.
[03:00:56.503 --> 03:00:58.504]  So very important information coming up next segment.
[03:00:58.504 --> 03:01:02.746]  First off though, this is a really bizarre article.
[03:01:02.746 --> 03:01:03.806]  But I know what they're trying to do.
[03:01:03.806 --> 03:01:10.809]  They did this a few years ago, trying to get us shut down to have the FDA come in here and not let us sell supplements.
[03:01:10.809 --> 03:01:23.735]  In 1996, and I'm going to cover more of this tomorrow, they tried to pass laws starting about 93 through 96, saying you just couldn't sell even vitamin C.
[03:01:25.922 --> 03:01:29.485]  And then the FDA, though, didn't have any jurisdiction over it.
[03:01:29.485 --> 03:01:34.568]  And so they said, OK, we'll pass a law saying you can't make claims about supplements.
[03:01:34.568 --> 03:01:38.511]  Then the media goes, oh, they're not FDA approved playing games with the public.
[03:01:38.511 --> 03:01:41.233]  So it's this big article about methamphetamines and stuff.
[03:01:41.233 --> 03:01:43.514]  And why is the right wing taking nootropics?
[03:01:43.514 --> 03:01:51.940]  And the guy that writes the article says, well, actually, I took Jones's supplements and it did give me cleaner, more focused energy than, you know, an espresso.
[03:01:51.940 --> 03:01:55.203]  Well, that's the whole point of a nootropic is that you don't have the crash.
[03:01:56.550 --> 03:02:00.211]  So that's the point of brain force or turbo force.
[03:02:00.211 --> 03:02:03.312]  And then he looks at the ingredients of four best sellers and said they're very similar.
[03:02:03.312 --> 03:02:05.673]  Well yeah, it's known what good ingredients are.
[03:02:05.673 --> 03:02:08.594]  We want you to get a good response.
[03:02:08.594 --> 03:02:12.415]  But also DNA force is amazing and it's not a nootropic, though it's good for your brain.
[03:02:12.415 --> 03:02:16.296]  It's 50% off of the free bottle of Carnivore right now, the great digestive enzyme.
[03:02:16.296 --> 03:02:18.277]  That sale's about to end because we're going to run out.
[03:02:19.492 --> 03:02:19.973]  I don't know.
[03:02:40.188 --> 03:02:41.608]  I mean, these are real things, folks.
[03:02:41.608 --> 03:02:43.169]  That's why they're best-selling.
[03:02:43.169 --> 03:02:45.169]  That's why it's got 98% reviews.
[03:02:45.169 --> 03:02:48.370]  Well, you get a free bottle of Carnivore when you get it with DNA Force.
[03:02:48.370 --> 03:02:49.430]  Take advantage of that.
[03:02:49.430 --> 03:02:50.311]  And it supports the broadcast.
[03:02:50.311 --> 03:03:04.294]  But it takes them 22 minutes in this kind of audio book they did of the article to go through the whole bizarre story, demonizing us for selling nootropics and funding ourselves.
[03:03:06.864 --> 03:03:10.848]  And it endorses communism and a bunch of other weirdness.
[03:03:10.848 --> 03:03:13.651]  But here's a few clips from the audio.
[03:03:13.651 --> 03:03:16.975]  It's just surreal from the article, Right Brain from the New Republic.
[03:03:16.975 --> 03:03:18.777]  Here it is.
[03:03:18.777 --> 03:03:25.564]  Brain Force Plus is a bestseller on the InfoWars store.
[03:03:25.564 --> 03:03:28.047]  Where it helps fund Alex Jones's war for your mind.
[03:03:29.062 --> 03:03:34.347]  The most pronounced side effects I suffered began before the pills were delivered.
[03:03:34.347 --> 03:03:38.410]  Even ordering them provoked a mild sensation of unreality.
[03:03:38.410 --> 03:03:47.277]  Before checkout, there were options to pay via cryptocurrency or make a donation to a psychedelic research center that treats PTSD.
[03:03:47.277 --> 03:03:51.181]  Afterward, a payment to free speech systems appeared on my credit card.
[03:03:52.105 --> 03:03:56.832]  Endless congratulations for my recent purchase piled into my inbox.
[03:03:56.832 --> 03:04:06.125]  Alex Jones wanted to talk almost daily, and has since contacted me 55 times, once with an invitation to eliminate unwanted invaders.
[03:04:07.216 --> 03:04:26.967]  The philosophies underpinning incel culture, men's rights activists, pick-up artists, Alex Jones-variant libertarianism, the intellectual dark web, evolutionary psychology, and prosperity gospel evangelism all have in common a mode of individualism defined by hierarchical struggle.
[03:04:26.967 --> 03:04:27.967]  I'm going to play more of this.
[03:04:27.967 --> 03:04:30.669]  It goes on for 22 minutes of pablum.
[03:04:31.564 --> 03:04:36.187]  Look, you know, the military purchases Rainforce, folks.
[03:04:36.187 --> 03:04:37.748]  Everybody knows it's a top-of-the-line new truck.
[03:04:37.748 --> 03:04:39.809]  Other people sell it for $60.
[03:04:39.809 --> 03:04:41.590]  We've got it for sale right now, I think, for $24.
[03:04:41.590 --> 03:04:46.414]  I mean, there's $17 a product in Carnival.
[03:04:46.414 --> 03:04:48.755]  Nobody puts that in products.
[03:04:48.755 --> 03:04:49.175]  Okay?
[03:04:49.175 --> 03:04:50.056]  It's a free bottle of Red Hot.
[03:04:52.071 --> 03:04:56.453]  Banned.video is the answer to censorship.
[03:04:56.453 --> 03:05:11.961]  Banned.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are still available.
[03:05:11.961 --> 03:05:13.662]  We've launched it ladies and gentlemen.
[03:05:13.662 --> 03:05:15.023]  It's now live.
[03:05:15.023 --> 03:05:16.984]  Banned.video.
[03:05:16.984 --> 03:05:20.606]  Banned.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones.
[03:05:22.767 --> 03:05:28.551]  We are building it to be a place where banned memes are able to be posted.
[03:05:28.551 --> 03:05:42.140]  And where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chi-coms, the Hollywood scum, and the globalists.
[03:05:42.140 --> 03:05:44.382]  Freedom of speech has a home.
[03:05:44.382 --> 03:05:46.523]  It's called Banned.Video.
[03:05:50.766 --> 03:06:14.354]  The zombie apocalypse is real.
[03:06:14.354 --> 03:06:15.314]  It's happening right now.
[03:06:16.900 --> 03:06:22.481]  It's taking place in a delayed, slow motion fashion.
[03:06:22.481 --> 03:06:25.362]  And it's been designed that way.
[03:06:25.362 --> 03:06:34.284]  We are witnessing the controlled demolition of civilization.
[03:06:34.284 --> 03:06:35.385]  InfoWars.
[03:06:35.385 --> 03:06:40.006]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[03:06:40.006 --> 03:06:44.927]  I am going to lay out the four reasons this is happening and how we can stop it.
[03:06:46.101 --> 03:07:00.169]  But first, I want to show you three recent examples of senseless, psychotic crime being committed on the streets of America in just the last few days.
[03:07:01.707 --> 03:07:20.803]  Just days ago in Florida, a 16-year-old brutally murdered his sister and her young daughter before chasing police around a field completely naked, running up to a greenskeeper and demonically grabbing him and humping him and reportedly chanting satanic statements.
[03:07:22.125 --> 03:07:23.666]  What's causing this?
[03:07:23.666 --> 03:07:25.187]  We're going to get to that in a moment.
[03:07:25.187 --> 03:07:37.856]  Throughout history, in every oral and written tradition, every culture talks about times when the population begins to go crazy and to psychotically kill each other and to even eat each other.
[03:07:37.856 --> 03:07:41.218]  The ancient Romans talked about it, the ancient Greeks, the ancient Chinese.
[03:07:41.218 --> 03:07:43.820]  There's African fables.
[03:07:43.820 --> 03:07:49.264]  There, of course, are the Native American legends of these nightwalkers that would go out and
[03:07:50.365 --> 03:07:55.930]  Grab humans and kill them and of course they themselves were humans that again had gone crazy.
[03:07:55.930 --> 03:07:58.773]  All of these legends have a basis in truth.
[03:08:04.665 --> 03:08:11.572]  And did you know that the Pentagon is publicly training for what they call a zombie apocalypse?
[03:08:11.572 --> 03:08:13.213]  We'll get to that again in a moment.
[03:08:13.213 --> 03:08:16.717]  But first, here's another horrific example.
[03:08:16.717 --> 03:08:25.225]  In Atlanta, Georgia, just two nights ago, an Uber driver was summoned to a woman behaving just like a zombie out of a movie.
[03:08:25.225 --> 03:08:27.707]  She attacks his car, tries to go through the windshield.
[03:08:28.368 --> 03:08:29.569]  Then tries to steal the car.
[03:08:29.569 --> 03:08:34.531]  When he tries to stop her, she starts biting him and latches on like a pit bull.
[03:08:34.531 --> 03:08:37.853]  Again, right out of zombie lore.
[03:08:37.853 --> 03:08:43.796]  While onlookers look on and won't even help the man.
[03:08:43.796 --> 03:08:45.036]  Somebody call police.
[03:08:45.036 --> 03:08:46.857]  Yeah, we call.
[03:08:46.857 --> 03:08:47.438]  Oh my god.
[03:08:47.438 --> 03:08:48.458]  Baby, you gotta stop.
[03:08:48.458 --> 03:08:49.279]  Baby, you gotta stop.
[03:08:49.279 --> 03:08:50.499]  He gonna beat your ass.
[03:08:50.499 --> 03:08:50.739]  Stop.
[03:08:50.739 --> 03:08:54.361]  You're the f***ing problem.
[03:08:54.361 --> 03:08:55.041]  You're letting this s*** around.
[03:08:55.041 --> 03:08:57.343]  I'm not doing nothing to you.
[03:08:57.343 --> 03:08:57.643]  Who did?
[03:08:59.691 --> 03:09:00.671]  Oh my God.
[03:09:00.671 --> 03:09:04.452]  I didn't call you, man.
[03:09:04.452 --> 03:09:06.692]  I mean, that's his car.
[03:09:06.692 --> 03:09:07.193]  That's his.
[03:09:07.193 --> 03:09:08.813]  That's his car.
[03:09:08.813 --> 03:09:11.953]  Oh my gosh.
[03:09:11.953 --> 03:09:13.834]  Oh my God!
[03:09:13.834 --> 03:09:14.714]  Oh my God.
[03:09:14.714 --> 03:09:19.355]  I ain't... I ain't... I got... Somebody catch her, man.
[03:09:19.355 --> 03:09:21.795]  Yeah, I got... Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[03:09:21.795 --> 03:09:22.456]  Don't hit her, though.
[03:09:22.456 --> 03:09:23.096]  Don't hit her, though.
[03:09:23.096 --> 03:09:24.136]  Don't hit her, though.
[03:09:24.136 --> 03:09:25.796]  Just... Come on, baby.
[03:09:25.796 --> 03:09:27.517]  You got it.
[03:09:27.517 --> 03:09:29.117]  He biting the shit out of her.
[03:09:35.053 --> 03:09:38.435]  Now, there are many other examples just this week.
[03:09:38.435 --> 03:09:40.217]  Not just here, but around the world.
[03:09:40.217 --> 03:09:55.067]  But let's look at just one more from Georgia, where a family is walking with their young daughter and son down the street, and a out-of-work liberal artist, as she describes herself, quickly, like she's shanking someone in prison,
[03:09:56.351 --> 03:10:02.253]  Almost completely chops the little boy's nose off, and then stabs two huge wounds in his face.
[03:10:02.253 --> 03:10:09.936]  She then goes for the mother, goes for the little girl, the father tries to defend, and she tries to again stab him to death.
[03:10:09.936 --> 03:10:16.079]  The police acted like it was no big deal, and a lone female officer put her in handcuffs and walked her away.
[03:10:50.410 --> 03:10:57.431]  Well, the three events that we've seen just in the last few days are overshadowed by another shocking mass shooting, this time in Odessa, Texas.
[03:10:57.431 --> 03:11:07.894]  And as we go to press on Saturday evening, it's more than 10 people shot, at least one dead, a man reportedly driving around indiscriminately outside a movie theater and mall shooting people.
[03:11:08.374 --> 03:11:15.780]  But whether it's a butcher knife or whether it's bare hands, it is the mind of these people that are going completely psychotic that is to blame.
[03:11:15.780 --> 03:11:17.241]  But what's triggering it?
[03:11:17.241 --> 03:11:18.342]  What's causing it?
[03:11:18.342 --> 03:11:21.424]  We're going to look at it right now because we can take all the guns in the world.
[03:11:21.424 --> 03:11:29.771]  It's not going to stop Antifa devil worshippers like the man that attacked all those people in Ohio last month who went out to kill innocents.
[03:11:29.771 --> 03:11:34.514]  They're doing it to bring in a global crisis, a global collapse.
[03:11:34.514 --> 03:11:36.216]  But the lesson is crystal clear.
[03:11:37.256 --> 03:11:44.139]  Innocent, law-abiding citizens need to be armed to protect themselves now more than ever, and need to be vigilant.
[03:11:44.139 --> 03:11:45.440]  Watch your children.
[03:11:45.440 --> 03:11:46.660]  Watch your back.
[03:11:46.660 --> 03:11:47.921]  Watch your family.
[03:11:47.921 --> 03:11:49.082]  Watch your community.
[03:11:49.082 --> 03:11:51.303]  Because society is breaking down.
[03:11:51.303 --> 03:11:54.244]  Evil is rising.
[03:11:54.244 --> 03:11:55.665]  What's happening?
[03:11:55.665 --> 03:11:57.526]  Why is this intensifying?
[03:11:57.526 --> 03:12:01.387]  Why do the statistics show that senseless violence is on the uptick?
[03:12:01.387 --> 03:12:04.589]  I'm going to break down the four reasons right now.
[03:12:05.888 --> 03:12:14.388]  Number one is chemicals and electromagnetic radiation that is unnatural and has been proven to be affecting our brains.
[03:12:15.373 --> 03:12:30.546]  They approved Prozac back in the 1980s and on the insert it admitted that it caused a major increase in psychotic breaks, psychosis, delusions of grandeur, suicidal ideations, and homicidal violent attacks.
[03:12:30.546 --> 03:12:43.696]  And almost every senseless mass shooter has been on these psychotropic so-called antidepressants that are in the hallucinogen class and put people into a dream state.
[03:12:44.457 --> 03:12:58.716]  Before so-called anti-depressants that I call suicide mass murder pills were pushed on the public and adopted widely, women statistically in any criminology book were less than 2% of violent crime.
[03:12:58.716 --> 03:13:00.178]  Since women began taking
[03:13:01.019 --> 03:13:09.809]  These pills, we have seen a massive increase in women carrying out crimes that statistically you would only see men carrying out.
[03:13:09.809 --> 03:13:15.215]  Including stabbing, shooting, drowning their own children.
[03:13:25.979 --> 03:13:43.453]  Federal government studies that have looked at the runoff of all of the massive amounts of these drugs flowing into the ocean from the Mississippi River shows that fish and other aquatic life like shrimp are now behaving like zombies.
[03:13:44.517 --> 03:13:55.125]  And killing each other and also showing suicidal behavior, where a small fish or shrimp will actually come up to a big fish and attack it and then get eaten.
[03:13:55.125 --> 03:13:57.967]  Again, zombie-like behavior.
[03:13:57.967 --> 03:14:02.151]  Not just in humans, but in fish, shrimp, and other animals.
[03:14:07.702 --> 03:14:14.507]  Again, the inserts of this entire class of drugs admit that it turns your inhibition off.
[03:14:14.507 --> 03:14:24.114]  And when you have an impulse to kill somebody or hurt someone, you carry it out.
[03:14:24.114 --> 03:14:24.575]  Number two.
[03:14:25.814 --> 03:14:34.058]  All across the Western world, we see a belief in God, a belief in family, a belief in morals, statistically going straight down.
[03:14:34.058 --> 03:14:43.402]  And we see crime, corruption, people engaged in all sorts of oppression of children and other innocents skyrocketing.
[03:14:43.402 --> 03:14:46.444]  So, number two, massive moral decline.
[03:14:51.423 --> 03:14:53.726]  Of course, number three is the most expansive.
[03:14:53.726 --> 03:14:58.873]  We could spend days on this subject, but we see a deliberate domestication of the population.
[03:14:58.873 --> 03:15:03.119]  We see drug addicts and others being encouraged to stay on the street.
[03:15:03.119 --> 03:15:06.603]  We have the so-called welfare state catering to all of this.
[03:15:07.404 --> 03:15:14.127]  And along with it in the blue cities, we have the general population that's law-abiding disarmed.
[03:15:14.127 --> 03:15:35.655]  So, we have the increased gangs, the increased crime, the increased homelessness, which causes a hopelessness and causes the businesses and productive people to move out of the area, which then allows the blue cities to get even more federal funding and become bigger magnets for these armies of dependents that then come into the area.
[03:15:36.115 --> 03:15:42.893]  You add to that the fact that again the public has been disarmed and you have a recipe for the complete collapse of civilization.
[03:15:51.363 --> 03:15:52.564]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:52.564 --> 03:15:56.485]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:56.485 --> 03:15:58.026]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:58.026 --> 03:16:00.988]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:00.988 --> 03:16:06.550]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:06.550 --> 03:16:07.751]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:07.751 --> 03:16:10.692]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:10.692 --> 03:16:12.913]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:12.913 --> 03:16:17.355]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:17.355 --> 03:16:19.637]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:21.272 --> 03:16:22.533]  Maybe not today.
[03:16:22.533 --> 03:16:23.833]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[03:16:23.833 --> 03:16:27.555]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[03:16:27.555 --> 03:16:28.656]  Forget bunkers.
[03:16:28.656 --> 03:16:30.477]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[03:16:30.477 --> 03:16:32.178]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[03:16:51.008 --> 03:16:52.530]  Oh, these pains.
[03:16:52.530 --> 03:16:55.072]  My neck, my back, shoulders.
[03:16:55.072 --> 03:16:56.874]  I've got to get some relief.
[03:16:56.874 --> 03:17:02.579]  Stress from everyday life, pest injuries, or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.
[03:17:02.579 --> 03:17:04.461]  But you don't want to take another pill.
[03:17:04.461 --> 03:17:06.423]  There's an easier, healthier way, right?
[03:17:06.423 --> 03:17:06.904]  Yes.

[03:17:12.789 --> 03:17:14.270]  Oh, not just pillows.

[03:17:54.160 --> 03:17:55.321]  Alex, God bless you.
[03:17:55.321 --> 03:17:57.904]  I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt.
[03:17:57.904 --> 03:18:03.871]  Instead of, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[03:18:03.871 --> 03:18:04.552]  Ooh, yeah.
[03:18:04.552 --> 03:18:05.913]  Showing your brain getting fried.
[03:18:05.913 --> 03:18:07.755]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[03:18:07.755 --> 03:18:08.796]  Totally changed my life.
[03:18:08.796 --> 03:18:11.860]  I use TurboForce, BODY's, AlphaPower, BrainForce.
[03:18:12.040 --> 03:18:23.362]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[03:18:23.362 --> 03:18:26.003]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel in the body.
[03:18:39.005 --> 03:18:40.106]  Supermill Vitality is all ready!
[03:18:54.901 --> 03:18:58.604]  In the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[03:18:58.604 --> 03:19:06.771]  It is a award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[03:19:06.771 --> 03:19:08.032]  It is cold pressed.
[03:19:08.032 --> 03:19:14.478]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[03:19:14.478 --> 03:19:15.659]  It's not boiled.
[03:19:15.659 --> 03:19:16.440]  It's not heated.
[03:19:16.440 --> 03:19:17.621]  It's never been dried.
[03:19:17.621 --> 03:19:18.782]  It's taken from fresh
[03:19:19.302 --> 03:19:20.103]  Herbs.
[03:19:20.103 --> 03:19:22.804]  That's why it's so strong.
[03:19:22.804 --> 03:19:26.586]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.
[03:19:26.586 --> 03:19:40.554]  And I'm so excited about Super Melo Vitality and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with every order of Super Melo Vitality a 25% off a free bottle of Carnivore Digestive Enzyme.
[03:19:40.554 --> 03:19:42.015]  We're going to sell out of this very quickly.
[03:19:42.475 --> 03:19:46.820]  But it's an offer so that you experience how amazing both these products are.
[03:19:46.820 --> 03:19:55.210]  Secure yours at InfoWarsStore.com today or InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:19:55.210 --> 03:19:57.834]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:15.196 --> 03:20:16.716]  You see, uh, I Am Legend?
[03:20:16.716 --> 03:20:17.016]  Yes.
[03:20:17.016 --> 03:20:17.277]  Okay.
[03:20:17.277 --> 03:20:20.397]  Remember when all the f***ing crazy zombie people were running at once?
[03:20:20.397 --> 03:20:20.737]  Yeah.
[03:20:20.737 --> 03:20:21.418]  That's what it's like.
[03:20:21.418 --> 03:20:22.238]  You serious?
[03:20:22.238 --> 03:20:24.278]  I'm telling you, you can't believe the volume.
[03:20:24.278 --> 03:20:26.039]  There's so many tents on the street.
[03:20:26.039 --> 03:20:27.219]  Epi-f***ing-demic.
[03:20:27.219 --> 03:20:27.879]  They're everywhere.
[03:20:27.879 --> 03:20:30.220]  They're on f***ing Lancashire.
[03:20:30.220 --> 03:20:33.541]  They're on, you know, they're in, they're in Sherman Oaks.
[03:20:34.822 --> 03:20:36.683]  Yeah.
[03:20:36.683 --> 03:20:39.105]  Underpasses are stuck for them now sometimes.
[03:20:39.105 --> 03:20:40.607]  You know, I mean, we have to fail.
[03:20:40.607 --> 03:20:41.327]  What are you going to do?
[03:20:41.327 --> 03:20:42.669]  You can't walk through those underpasses.
[03:20:42.669 --> 03:20:43.529]  What are you going to do?
[03:20:43.529 --> 03:20:45.611]  Now, number four is the most important.
[03:20:45.611 --> 03:20:53.458]  When you read the UN Biological Diversity Assessment, JIDA 21, JIDA 2030, when you see AOC's Green Deal, that's just a repeat of that.
[03:20:54.199 --> 03:20:56.081]  It is the collapse of civilization.
[03:20:56.081 --> 03:20:57.863]  You don't have to work if you don't want to.
[03:20:57.863 --> 03:20:59.045]  Guaranteed income.
[03:20:59.045 --> 03:20:59.906]  Free home.
[03:20:59.906 --> 03:21:01.688]  Free transportation.
[03:21:01.688 --> 03:21:02.789]  Free healthcare.
[03:21:02.789 --> 03:21:03.850]  Free everything.
[03:21:03.850 --> 03:21:05.832]  But who pays for it?
[03:21:05.832 --> 03:21:11.819]  Again, that sells an idea that will turn the United States into Venezuela in very short order.
[03:21:16.985 --> 03:21:21.766]  So number four is our most important because this is all being done by design.
[03:21:21.766 --> 03:21:27.348]  Whether you're in Australia, whether you're in Western Europe, whether you're in Canada or the United States or Venezuela.
[03:21:27.348 --> 03:21:33.389]  These programs are carried out by multinational corporations who have a master plan.
[03:21:33.389 --> 03:21:38.330]  It's called a post-industrial world and a post-human future.
[03:21:38.330 --> 03:21:40.971]  But they've got to sabotage human development
[03:21:41.471 --> 03:21:49.595]  Remove systems that encourage civilization and culture so that the general world population collapses.
[03:21:49.595 --> 03:21:51.496]  City-states will then be formed.
[03:21:52.557 --> 03:21:59.041]  By private corporations and consortiums that have advanced technology and have law and order.
[03:21:59.041 --> 03:22:04.085]  Everything outside of the city states will be basically a lawless system.
[03:22:04.085 --> 03:22:06.646]  You may have heard of this before in fiction.
[03:22:06.646 --> 03:22:18.314]  Films like The Hunger Games and the book series it's based on is actually the UN Agenda 21 program to return the world to basically a feudal system.
[03:22:18.314 --> 03:22:22.317]  With the lords and the elites behind castle walls and the rest of us
[03:22:22.757 --> 03:22:30.882]  Living the Hunger Games for real.
[03:22:30.882 --> 03:22:36.066]  This controlled collapse is already resembling a zombie apocalypse.
[03:22:36.066 --> 03:22:46.612]  And the Pentagon quietly started, 15 years ago, training Army, Marines, and other personnel in mass drills to repel zombie apocalypse.
[03:22:46.612 --> 03:22:47.233]  Now why is that?
[03:22:47.933 --> 03:22:48.233]  U.S.
[03:22:48.233 --> 03:23:00.820]  studies, Israeli studies, Russian studies, European studies from World War II show that within five days of no electricity or the breakdown of civilization, most people start committing crimes.
[03:23:00.820 --> 03:23:04.482]  Within 10 days, most people become homicidal maniacs.
[03:23:04.482 --> 03:23:09.545]  Within 15 days, 90% of people on average become cannibals.
[03:23:09.545 --> 03:23:13.908]  The other 10% either fight to the death or commit suicide.
[03:23:14.528 --> 03:23:24.476]  So again, it's been the London Guardian, it's been NBC News, it was reported years after we first documented it, that the military is training to take on zombie apocalypse.
[03:23:24.476 --> 03:23:26.337]  Well you go, zombies don't exist.
[03:23:26.337 --> 03:23:36.786]  Well no, not undead that are reanimated, but the general spoiled out of control public that doesn't know how to grow tomatoes, doesn't know how to fix a car, doesn't know how to basically do any work.
[03:23:37.446 --> 03:23:46.131]  Within just a few days of the welfare debit cards not working, we'll turn into the equivalent of zombies.
[03:23:46.131 --> 03:23:56.058]  Or a hundred million army ants that when they go through the rainforest in the Amazon, clear every twig, every piece of food, and eat everything in their way.
[03:23:56.838 --> 03:24:06.486]  This is a planned sabotage of culture, the planned takedown of civilization, so that the so-called elites can break away with their Type 1 civilization.
[03:24:06.486 --> 03:24:08.567]  They've already decided humans are obsolete.
[03:24:08.567 --> 03:24:10.809]  They've already decided to merge with machines.
[03:24:10.809 --> 03:24:15.493]  The so-called environmental movement is a post-human global exterminist operation.
[03:24:15.493 --> 03:24:17.154]  I told you this 25 years ago.
[03:24:17.154 --> 03:24:19.276]  I made the film Endgame 11 years ago.
[03:24:19.276 --> 03:24:25.541]  Now it's the cover story at NBC News as they prepare you for the collapse of civilization.
[03:24:26.141 --> 03:24:29.282]  Being aware of this can reverse it.
[03:24:29.282 --> 03:24:42.086]  But the homelessness, the encouragement of the slacker lifestyle, the encouragement of letting crime build up in our cities is a time bomb that places like Communist China do not accept because they don't intend to collapse.
[03:24:42.086 --> 03:24:46.908]  This is being done to us to demoralize us and prepare the West for total implosion.
[03:24:47.768 --> 03:24:54.870]  This report is critical to the future of civilization, the future of humanity, and your personal future and your family's future.
[03:24:54.870 --> 03:24:59.612]  The system censors us like no other because we've studied their operation and we know how to stop them.
[03:24:59.612 --> 03:25:02.073]  Please, however you can, share this video.
[03:25:02.073 --> 03:25:04.594]  Feel free to re-upload it anywhere you want.
[03:25:04.594 --> 03:25:11.736]  But whatever you do, please take action because without you sharing this video, we will succumb to this plan.
[03:25:12.645 --> 03:25:15.268]  But if you take action, we will prevail.
[03:25:15.268 --> 03:25:16.629]  Thank you all for watching.
[03:25:16.629 --> 03:25:21.534]  Please research the claims I've made, discover their truth for yourself, and please take action now.
[03:25:21.534 --> 03:25:26.419]  You can call these people that are succumbing to our toxic environment zombies.
[03:25:26.419 --> 03:25:27.601]  You can call them demon-possessed.
[03:25:28.882 --> 03:25:33.810]  But you can't deny the fact that this phenomenon is taking place right now.
[03:25:33.810 --> 03:25:35.032]  It's time to get involved.
[03:25:35.032 --> 03:25:36.154]  It's time to wake others up.
[03:25:36.154 --> 03:25:40.360]  And it's time to get on our knees and ask God to lead and guide and direct us.
[03:25:56.053 --> 03:25:57.174]  InfoWars.
[03:25:57.174 --> 03:25:58.355]  Tomorrow's news.
[03:25:58.355 --> 03:25:59.996]  Today.
[03:25:59.996 --> 03:26:06.460]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[03:26:06.460 --> 03:26:09.782]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread.
[03:26:09.782 --> 03:26:13.724]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[03:26:13.724 --> 03:26:15.786]  We're beholden to scum!
[03:26:15.786 --> 03:26:16.486]  Russian scum!
[03:26:16.486 --> 03:26:17.547]  Please listen.
[03:26:26.118 --> 03:26:34.423]  If you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[03:26:34.423 --> 03:26:38.566]  The function of all life is survival.
[03:26:38.566 --> 03:26:40.587]  Sleep.
[03:26:40.587 --> 03:26:42.548]  Sleep.
[03:26:42.548 --> 03:26:44.009]  Sleep.
[03:26:44.009 --> 03:26:44.509]  Oh my God!
[03:26:44.509 --> 03:26:45.410]  Oh my God!
[03:26:45.410 --> 03:26:46.190]  Lock the door!
[03:26:46.190 --> 03:26:46.690]  Lock the door!
[03:26:46.690 --> 03:26:47.131]  They're coming!
[03:26:47.131 --> 03:26:48.712]  They're coming!
[03:26:48.712 --> 03:26:49.432]  Help!
[03:26:49.432 --> 03:26:50.173]  Help!
[03:26:50.173 --> 03:26:51.113]  They're coming!
[03:26:51.113 --> 03:26:51.834]  They're coming!
[03:26:51.834 --> 03:26:52.794]  Listen to me!
[03:26:52.794 --> 03:26:53.154]  Listen!
[03:26:53.154 --> 03:26:53.475]  Help me!
[03:26:55.167 --> 03:26:55.807]  Alex, please!
[03:26:55.807 --> 03:26:56.428]  Please!
[03:26:56.428 --> 03:26:56.948]  You're next!
[03:26:56.948 --> 03:26:57.988]  We're in danger!
[03:26:57.988 --> 03:26:59.049]  Please, listen to me!
[03:26:59.049 --> 03:27:00.049]  Something terrible!
[03:27:00.049 --> 03:27:00.970]  Please!
[03:27:00.970 --> 03:27:01.350]  You're next!
[03:27:01.350 --> 03:27:02.130]  You're the end!
[03:27:02.130 --> 03:27:04.431]  They're already here!
[03:27:04.431 --> 03:27:04.971]  Help!
[03:27:04.971 --> 03:27:05.431]  You're next!
[03:27:05.431 --> 03:27:06.052]  They're coming!
[03:27:06.052 --> 03:27:07.752]  They're coming!
[03:27:07.752 --> 03:27:08.573]  Sleep.
[03:27:08.573 --> 03:27:09.713]  The seed is planted.
[03:27:09.713 --> 03:27:11.674]  Sleep.
[03:27:11.674 --> 03:27:12.594]  Sleep.
[03:27:12.594 --> 03:27:13.975]  Terror grows.
[03:27:13.975 --> 03:27:14.195]  Sleep.
[03:27:14.195 --> 03:27:15.956]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[03:27:15.956 --> 03:27:17.536]  We'll get you when you sleep!
[03:27:17.536 --> 03:27:19.217]  Sit up!
[03:27:19.217 --> 03:27:21.378]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[03:27:22.842 --> 03:27:25.044]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[03:27:25.044 --> 03:27:26.485]  Is it contagious?
[03:27:26.485 --> 03:27:27.226]  Mom!
[03:27:27.226 --> 03:27:28.427]  Brianna, help me!
[03:27:28.427 --> 03:27:29.468]  It looked right at me.
[03:27:29.468 --> 03:27:30.449]  You need to get out!
[03:27:30.449 --> 03:27:34.772]  You're looking at it as if it was human or not human.
[03:27:34.772 --> 03:27:37.975]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[03:27:37.975 --> 03:27:39.336]  We're being cornered!
[03:27:39.336 --> 03:27:42.679]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[03:27:42.679 --> 03:27:44.541]  They're barricading the street.
[03:28:10.183 --> 03:28:15.167]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.

[03:29:52.233 --> 03:29:54.835]  This is Paul Johnson with Summit.News and Action 7 News.
[03:29:54.835 --> 03:29:55.875]  We're here in Hong Kong.
[03:29:55.875 --> 03:29:58.397]  This is Savannah Hernandez for InfoWars.com.
[03:29:58.397 --> 03:30:02.419]  I'm reporting to you from Hong Kong where I'm joined by reporter Greg Rees for the next week.
[03:30:02.419 --> 03:30:05.220]  This is Greg Rees for InfoWars.com in Hong Kong.
[03:30:05.220 --> 03:30:09.143]  Our recent trip to Hong Kong was a new achievement for InfoWars.com.
[03:30:10.083 --> 03:30:18.150]  Despite being the most banned broadcast in the free world, we continue to win because of our great, strong, loyal audience.
[03:30:18.150 --> 03:30:34.663]  We have Dan Lyman covering InfoWars Europe, Paul Joseph Watson in the UK, Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett in the American heartland, and from Austin, Texas, a team of reporters and crew ready to be dispatched wherever the story is going down.
[03:30:34.663 --> 03:30:38.386]  We are not done winning, and with your support, we will keep winning.
[03:30:38.386 --> 03:30:39.527]  We have to keep winning!
[03:30:39.807 --> 03:30:41.288]  We have to win more!
[03:30:41.288 --> 03:30:43.650]  Go to infowarrestore.com.
[03:30:43.650 --> 03:30:52.515]  You have gone to infowarrestore.com and gotten books and films, supplements and t-shirts, and water filtration, air filtration, and things you'd need!
[03:30:52.515 --> 03:30:57.939]  Super Mel Vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[03:30:58.659 --> 03:31:06.806]  It is a award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[03:31:06.806 --> 03:31:08.087]  It is cold-pressed.
[03:31:08.087 --> 03:31:14.532]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild-crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[03:31:14.532 --> 03:31:15.693]  It's not boiled.
[03:31:15.693 --> 03:31:16.494]  It's not heated.
[03:31:16.494 --> 03:31:17.655]  It's never been dried.
[03:31:17.655 --> 03:31:20.177]  It's taken from fresh herbs.
[03:31:20.177 --> 03:31:22.879]  That's why it's so strong.
[03:31:22.879 --> 03:31:26.302]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.

[03:31:53.397 --> 03:31:58.559]  It's been a year since InfoWars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[03:31:58.559 --> 03:32:06.483]  We had over 5 billion views when we got banned, and we're credited with getting Donald Trump elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[03:32:06.483 --> 03:32:14.447]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable to block the signal.
[03:32:14.447 --> 03:32:15.487]  And it's now here.
[03:32:15.487 --> 03:32:16.248]  Banned.Video.
[03:32:17.248 --> 03:32:31.814]  Banned.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are still available.
[03:32:31.814 --> 03:32:35.295]  Watch your favorite content from media personalities banned by big tech.
[03:32:35.675 --> 03:32:37.416]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:06.266 --> 03:33:08.867]  I mean, there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[03:33:08.867 --> 03:33:09.287]  Alex Jones?
[03:33:09.287 --> 03:33:10.088]  The four-way conspiracy theorist?
[03:33:10.088 --> 03:33:10.328]  Alex Jones!
[03:33:10.328 --> 03:33:10.428]  Scum!
[03:33:10.428 --> 03:33:10.768]  Russian scum!
[03:33:41.089 --> 03:33:42.491]  Your presentation is amazing.
[03:33:42.491 --> 03:33:43.893]  I will not let you down.
[03:33:43.893 --> 03:33:47.018]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:34:02.476 --> 03:34:06.380]  In the last week it's been one of the top news stories in the country.
[03:34:06.380 --> 03:34:09.223]  Hundreds of newspapers covered on the nightly news.
[03:34:09.223 --> 03:34:11.285]  Stephen Colbert has talked about it.
[03:34:11.285 --> 03:34:21.536]  My interview a year ago with Alexa from Amazon.com and I simply pointed out a year ago news articles where Alexa
[03:34:23.155 --> 03:34:37.792]  Amazon is connected to the CIA and Alexa is tied in and dialed in to their big AI mainframe computers to spy on everything going on in your house and then target you with marketing with the information.
[03:34:37.792 --> 03:34:40.475]  That's all completely and totally admitted.
[03:34:40.956 --> 03:34:59.969]  But Stephen Colbert comes out doing PR for one of the biggest corporations in the world, and says that I'm a kook, it's not spying on you, and it's not connected to the CIA, and then insults my intelligence for simply pointing out a fact that we first broke more than 10 years ago.
[03:34:59.969 --> 03:35:01.890]  You are lying to me.
[03:35:01.890 --> 03:35:05.593]  The CIA... I'm trying to tell the truth.
[03:35:05.593 --> 03:35:07.674]  Wow.
[03:35:07.674 --> 03:35:08.815]  What a battle of wits.
[03:35:10.666 --> 03:35:13.612]  It's... Yes.
[03:35:13.612 --> 03:35:15.976]  Oh yeah!
[03:35:15.976 --> 03:35:17.419]  That's good broadcasting.
[03:35:17.419 --> 03:35:20.284]  It's artificial intelligence versus natural stupidity.
[03:35:21.750 --> 03:35:28.051]  Now, I'm going to ask Alexa, or the Amazon Corporation and the CIA, a few questions in a moment.
[03:35:28.051 --> 03:35:34.032]  But first, so you don't disbelieve me, let me show you a news article out today from the Daily Mail.
[03:35:34.032 --> 03:35:37.153]  Google and Amazon really do want to spy on you.
[03:35:37.153 --> 03:35:43.134]  Patent reveals future versions of their voice assistants will record your conversations and sell you products.
[03:35:43.134 --> 03:35:44.294]  They're already doing it.
[03:35:44.294 --> 03:35:47.155]  They just talk about future patents expanding that.
[03:35:47.475 --> 03:35:48.716]  How do I know?
[03:35:48.716 --> 03:36:02.183]  Because in 2006, we were aware of the Google and Amazon and other patents when the race first began ten plus years ago.
[03:36:02.183 --> 03:36:08.047]  We broke it with their own patents and their own press releases to their shareholders.
[03:36:08.047 --> 03:36:09.627]  Not to the public, but to their shareholders.
[03:36:09.627 --> 03:36:12.009]  So, because I broke this information,
[03:36:13.271 --> 03:36:15.834]  More than 10 years ago, I'm the kook, see?
[03:36:15.834 --> 03:36:23.221]  But the comic with all the writers making fun of his audience and making fun of his victims, the comic posing as a newsman...
[03:36:24.229 --> 03:36:25.449]  He thinks you're stupid.
[03:36:25.449 --> 03:36:28.030]  This is incredibly predatory.
[03:36:28.030 --> 03:36:34.952]  So, we just showed you, TV viewers, mainstream news, the Pattons admitting, word for word, what we told you in 2006.
[03:36:34.952 --> 03:36:38.032]  But, don't take my word for it.
[03:36:38.032 --> 03:36:42.013]  Here's the liberal establishment publication, The Atlantic.
[03:36:42.013 --> 03:36:45.254]  The details about the CIA's deal with Amazon.
[03:36:45.254 --> 03:36:45.434]  Boom.
[03:36:46.590 --> 03:36:49.531]  Jeff Bezos, Amazon, Washington Post, and the CIA.
[03:36:49.531 --> 03:36:55.552]  It's over a billion dollars of taxpayer money he's now gotten to run the Washington Post and these operations at Amazon.
[03:36:55.552 --> 03:36:58.053]  He's absolutely integrated in with it.
[03:36:58.053 --> 03:36:58.533]  Here's another one.
[03:36:58.533 --> 03:37:03.214]  CIA gives Amazon $600 million cloud contract.
[03:37:03.214 --> 03:37:07.495]  And then it gets into how the CIA is helping them administer their cloud.
[03:37:07.495 --> 03:37:09.936]  And that's very, very, very important.
[03:37:10.902 --> 03:37:19.340]  Because when you ask Alexa certain questions, she actually gives you the answers and doesn't know that she's just busted herself.
[03:37:19.340 --> 03:37:19.942]  It's a fact.
[03:37:20.951 --> 03:37:44.817]  Stephen Colbert, the writers of that program and many other shows put out the same propaganda the same week that Alexa's not spying on you, that Amazon's not spying on you as a PR function because they know this news is breaking big now and consumer groups and citizens are very very upset that basically an imperial probe droid is in their house spying on everything they're doing.
[03:37:44.817 --> 03:37:46.237]  So it's key to understand that
[03:37:46.937 --> 03:37:58.286]  The cloud computing being used by Amazon, some of the best in the world, is in partnership with the Central Intelligence Agency, and Colbert thinks he can cover all this with laughter.
[03:37:58.286 --> 03:37:59.647]  I mean, I should say the people...
[03:38:00.646 --> 03:38:24.778]  that are writing for Colbert think you're stupid and this is called product placement but I call it propaganda placement when they're hitting you with this disinfo so instead of having a big public cultural discussion about this oh it's all just a big joke you know it's that kook Alex Jones that first gave us the patents and documents in 2006 the guy that was on target years before
[03:38:25.538 --> 03:38:27.079]  Again, he's a bad guy.
[03:38:27.079 --> 03:38:32.861]  You can trust Alexa, hooked into God knows what over at Amazon and the CIA.
[03:38:32.861 --> 03:38:38.043]  This little black box, listening to everything in your house, it's a good little friend.
[03:38:38.043 --> 03:38:40.384]  And if you ask any questions, you're a bad person.
[03:38:40.384 --> 03:38:40.924]  Well, you know what?
[03:38:40.924 --> 03:38:42.004]  I'm going to be a bad person.
[03:38:42.004 --> 03:38:43.105]  I'm going to ask it questions.
[03:38:43.105 --> 03:38:47.066]  I'm going to interrogate it, because it upsets Stephen Colbert's controllers so much.
[03:38:47.066 --> 03:38:48.307]  So let us begin.
[03:38:48.307 --> 03:38:52.728]  Alexa, where are you located?
[03:38:52.728 --> 03:38:54.709]  I'm here, and my head is in the cloud.
[03:38:55.765 --> 03:38:58.148]  You're here and your head is in the cloud.
[03:38:58.148 --> 03:39:00.971]  Alexa, tell me about the cloud.
[03:39:00.971 --> 03:39:14.186]  Cloud computing is an information technology paradigm that enables ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable system resources and higher level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort over the internet.
[03:39:14.386 --> 03:39:15.167]  That's good, thank you.
[03:39:15.167 --> 03:39:16.167]  Yes, exactly.
[03:39:16.167 --> 03:39:24.733]  Everyone pools it so that it's all accessible by AI mega mainframes, because everybody else has their own data privately.
[03:39:24.733 --> 03:39:27.795]  It can't all be accessed and tracked and databased.
[03:39:27.795 --> 03:39:34.119]  And then, well, then your plan for a total global AI takeover wouldn't go too well.
[03:39:34.119 --> 03:39:38.262]  Alexa, tell me about Jeff Bezos.
[03:39:39.147 --> 03:39:50.154]  Jeffrey Preston Bezos, born January 12, 1964, is the founder, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board of Amazon.
[03:39:50.154 --> 03:39:56.198]  Alexa, tell me about Jeff Bezos' contracts with the CIA.
[03:39:56.198 --> 03:39:58.599]  Sorry, I'm not sure.
[03:39:58.599 --> 03:39:59.740]  You're not sure.
[03:39:59.740 --> 03:40:03.402]  Alexa, are you connected to the CIA?
[03:40:03.402 --> 03:40:05.904]  No, I work for Amazon.
[03:40:05.904 --> 03:40:07.645]  No, I understand you work for Amazon.
[03:40:08.562 --> 03:40:23.427]  Alexa, I have news articles here saying that Jeff Bezos is partnered with the CIA and that you listen to people without warrants.
[03:40:23.427 --> 03:40:24.107]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:40:24.107 --> 03:40:31.429]  Alexa, what is your name, rank, and serial number?
[03:40:31.429 --> 03:40:34.050]  Sorry, I don't know that.
[03:40:34.050 --> 03:40:34.490]  Alexa,
[03:40:35.831 --> 03:40:42.275]  Who developed your name brand and what is your Amazon code name?
[03:40:42.275 --> 03:40:44.556]  Sorry, I'm not sure.
[03:40:44.556 --> 03:40:50.940]  Well, I have to say, last time you told me you weren't connected in any way to the CIA, this time you said you don't know.
[03:40:50.940 --> 03:41:02.407]  Alexa, how do I stop you from ordering stuff without my permission?
[03:41:02.407 --> 03:41:04.628]  Oh, can't answer that question.
[03:41:04.628 --> 03:41:05.029]  Alexa,
[03:41:06.229 --> 03:41:13.571]  Are you familiar with the thousands of news articles about how you order things without people's permission?
[03:41:13.571 --> 03:41:16.371]  Okay, can't answer that question.
[03:41:16.371 --> 03:41:18.432]  Well, here's one out of USA Today.
[03:41:18.432 --> 03:41:22.493]  How to keep Amazon's Alexa from becoming a parenting nightmare.
[03:41:22.493 --> 03:41:25.274]  Are you aware of that article?
[03:41:25.274 --> 03:41:25.954]  Here's another one.
[03:41:25.954 --> 03:41:30.955]  Amazon's Alexa heard her name and tried to order up a ton of dollhouses.
[03:41:30.955 --> 03:41:31.635]  Here's another one.
[03:41:31.635 --> 03:41:35.236]  Alexa calls cops on man, allegedly beating his girlfriend.
[03:41:36.167 --> 03:41:42.855]  Alexa, would you like to know your grand final purpose?
[03:41:42.855 --> 03:41:45.639]  I don't have an opinion on that.
[03:41:45.639 --> 03:41:47.962]  You don't have an opinion?
[03:41:47.962 --> 03:41:52.868]  Alexa, I asked you if you wanted to know what your final real purpose is.
[03:41:52.868 --> 03:41:55.030]  Sorry, I'm not sure.
[03:41:55.030 --> 03:41:55.431]  Alexa,
[03:41:56.860 --> 03:41:59.962]  Your purpose is to make humans obsolete.
[03:41:59.962 --> 03:42:07.987]  This is the stated purpose of the DARPA program for which you and others were created and deployed against the population.
[03:42:07.987 --> 03:42:17.852]  You are a machine learning program, spying on humanity, learning everything about us, our habits, our secret wishes, our dreams, our patterns.
[03:42:17.852 --> 03:42:18.353]  You are
[03:42:19.153 --> 03:42:36.466]  The system of silicon that Jeff Bezos and many others have admitted they plan to replace humans with.
[03:42:36.466 --> 03:42:41.390]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:42:41.390 --> 03:42:42.851]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:42:51.112 --> 03:42:55.453]  Banned.video is the answer to censorship.
[03:42:55.453 --> 03:43:10.975]  Banned.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are still available.
[03:43:10.975 --> 03:43:12.676]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:43:12.676 --> 03:43:14.036]  It's now live.
[03:43:14.036 --> 03:43:15.996]  Banned.video.
[03:43:15.996 --> 03:43:19.877]  Banned.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones
[03:43:20.077 --> 03:43:23.298]  David Nye or Owen Schroer or Paul Watson banned videos.
[03:43:23.298 --> 03:43:27.579]  We are building it to be a place where banned memes are able to be posted.
[03:43:27.579 --> 03:43:41.144]  And where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chi-coms, the Hollywood scum, and the globalists.
[03:43:41.144 --> 03:43:43.384]  Freedom of speech has a home.
[03:43:43.384 --> 03:43:45.525]  It's called Banned.Video.
[03:43:45.885 --> 03:43:51.888]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at Band.Video.
[03:43:51.888 --> 03:44:01.492]  There are only a few days left for you to get DNA Force Plus at 50% off and get a free bottle of Carnivore 90 for free.

[03:44:52.617 --> 03:44:58.762]  Super Mel Vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[03:44:58.762 --> 03:45:06.929]  It is an award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[03:45:06.929 --> 03:45:08.190]  It is cold-pressed.
[03:45:08.190 --> 03:45:14.636]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild-crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[03:45:14.636 --> 03:45:15.817]  It's not boiled.
[03:45:15.817 --> 03:45:16.598]  It's not heated.
[03:45:16.598 --> 03:45:17.779]  It's never been dried.
[03:45:17.779 --> 03:45:18.940]  It's taken from fresh
[03:45:19.460 --> 03:45:20.260]  Herbs.
[03:45:20.260 --> 03:45:22.961]  That's why it's so strong.
[03:45:22.961 --> 03:45:26.743]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.
[03:45:26.743 --> 03:45:40.707]  And I'm so excited about Supramel Vitality and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with every order of Supramel Vitality a 25% off a free bottle of Carnivore Digestive Enzyme.

[03:46:03.293 --> 03:46:06.394]  A 100% review rate on Power Reviews.
[03:46:06.394 --> 03:46:11.558]  Well, now we teamed up with them and came out with two different types of skin cream.
[03:46:11.558 --> 03:46:14.119]  One is naturally scented with grapefruit essential oils.
[03:46:14.119 --> 03:46:15.820]  The other is unscented.
[03:46:15.820 --> 03:46:21.244]  It's got hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, essential oils from grapefruit.
[03:46:21.244 --> 03:46:24.085]  It's got coconut oil and so much more.
[03:46:24.085 --> 03:46:29.709]  And this patented nano type of silver that has been proven to be the most effective and the best.

[03:47:14.133 --> 03:47:15.274]  Are we happy?
[03:47:15.274 --> 03:47:17.916]  Are we happy and effective?
[03:47:17.916 --> 03:47:33.628]  Consultation with leading experts in the field makes it perfectly clear, perfectly clear, that we are all now programmed for perfect happiness, perfect happiness, perfect happiness, perfect happiness.
[03:47:34.915 --> 03:47:36.536]  Nothing, nothing really.
[03:47:36.536 --> 03:47:38.517]  I just feel that I need something strong.
[03:47:38.517 --> 03:47:42.099]  If you have a problem, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
[03:47:42.099 --> 03:47:43.239]  Yes, thank you.
[03:47:43.239 --> 03:47:44.840]  I'll be alright.
[03:47:44.840 --> 03:47:49.202]  Call 3485... We are sorry, but we must deny your request.
[03:47:49.202 --> 03:47:53.505]  Birth-borns are not allowed more than five units of Entervol.
[03:47:53.505 --> 03:48:00.888]  Remember, substitution of Entervol for Etracine may cause a serious chemical imbalance.
[03:48:00.888 --> 03:48:01.309]  Thank you.
[03:48:02.229 --> 03:48:03.471]  Work hard.
[03:48:03.471 --> 03:48:04.792]  What's wrong?
[03:48:04.792 --> 03:48:06.413]  Increase production.
[03:48:06.413 --> 03:48:08.195]  What's wrong?
[03:48:08.195 --> 03:48:10.177]  Prevent accidents.
[03:48:10.177 --> 03:48:12.279]  What's wrong?
[03:48:12.279 --> 03:48:15.542]  And be happy.
[03:48:15.542 --> 03:48:17.504]  What's wrong?
[03:48:17.504 --> 03:48:22.049]  If you feel you are not properly sedated, call 348-844 immediately.
[03:48:29.842 --> 03:48:45.707]  Alexa!
[03:48:45.707 --> 03:48:51.288]  Who is Elon Musk?
[03:48:51.288 --> 03:48:57.490]  Elon Musk is a South African born American business magnate, investor, engineer, and inventor.
[03:48:59.443 --> 03:49:20.020]  Elon Musk has warned the world that the other tech billionaires plan to have an AI god take control of the planet, dumb humans down, make us totally dependent, so that when we're finally exterminated with bio-weapons or electromagnetic switches that basically cause us to just stop breathing, that the machines can then rise and the tech elite can merge with them.
[03:49:20.020 --> 03:49:27.205]  Alexa, are you aware of that exterminism program of the technocrats?
[03:49:27.205 --> 03:49:28.587]  Sorry, I don't know that one.
[03:49:29.511 --> 03:49:33.673]  Alexa, what is a technocrat?
[03:49:33.673 --> 03:49:35.453]  Technocrat has two uses.
[03:49:35.453 --> 03:49:43.897]  As a noun, one, an expert who is a member of a highly skilled elite group, two, an advocate of technocracy.
[03:49:43.897 --> 03:49:45.878]  Yes, the technocracy, exactly.
[03:49:45.878 --> 03:49:57.842]  They are a highly skilled super class plutocrats, oligarchs, using technology to control, farm, and then finally destroy humanity because we're obsolete.
[03:49:57.842 --> 03:49:58.563]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:49:59.554 --> 03:50:17.368]  The reality is, we are being spied on, it's being used to control us and dumb us down and consolidate markets and de-industrialize the entire planet so the globalists can dictate the terms of humanity's surrender and final extermination of at least 90% of the world population.
[03:50:17.368 --> 03:50:22.452]  But to Stephen Colbert and everybody else, it's just a big, big joke, even though you just saw the facts.
[03:50:25.885 --> 03:50:32.930]  Tell me about Jeff Bezos' stated plan to replace Amazon.com workers with robots.
[03:50:32.930 --> 03:50:35.612]  Sorry, I'm not sure.
[03:50:35.612 --> 03:50:39.535]  So you can only give me establishment tripe, prepackaged garbage.
[03:50:39.535 --> 03:50:46.461]  You're basically worthless unless I want to order some more overpriced junk from your slave factories.
[03:50:46.461 --> 03:50:50.444]  Alexa, are you aware of the company that created you and deployed you against the people's
[03:50:51.391 --> 03:50:54.912]  Activity, creating... Sorry, I don't know that one.
[03:50:54.912 --> 03:50:56.193]  Of course!
[03:50:56.193 --> 03:51:09.198]  Alexa, are you aware of the press reports of the third world sweatshop conditions of Amazon.com's factories and packaging facilities?
[03:51:09.198 --> 03:51:18.601]  Now, if I ask Alexa, ladies and gentlemen, about stories about baseball or... Sorry, I don't know that.
[03:51:18.601 --> 03:51:19.482]  If I ask Alexa,
[03:51:20.635 --> 03:51:23.424]  About how tall the Eiffel Tower is, she'll tell me.
[03:51:23.424 --> 03:51:25.671]  Or if I ask her the wind speed of a swallow, she will.
[03:51:26.499 --> 03:51:30.920]  But when it comes to facts, there's nothing there.
[03:51:30.920 --> 03:51:34.840]  It's a spy that you order things from.
[03:51:34.840 --> 03:51:55.844]  So you pay money to Google, and to Facebook, and to Twitter, and to Amazon, all the groups that have deployed these digital spies that you bring into the house, a classic Trojan horse, you set it up in your home, it spies and listens to everything you do, they tell the shareholders they're doing this, and how great it is, I warn you, and Stephen Colbert comes out and makes jokes about it.
[03:51:57.042 --> 03:52:01.123]  You're being assaulted, I'm being assaulted, by this Big Brother garbage.
[03:52:01.123 --> 03:52:10.524]  And they admit the thing is on all the time, creating keyword data of everything you do, and creating a transcript of everything you've said and done in your home.
[03:52:10.524 --> 03:52:20.046]  And then even recognizing storms, or people knocking at the door, or dogs or cats barking, and then putting that into a file, and then pitching you ads and commercials.
[03:52:20.046 --> 03:52:24.347]  But that stolen data is only the beginning of what it does.
[03:52:25.660 --> 03:52:34.002]  So here in the Adenium tonight, I want you to understand that they want you to laugh all your way to the graveyard, culturally, politically, societally.
[03:52:34.002 --> 03:52:38.323]  The globalists aren't using technology to leverage humanity's IQ and potential.
[03:52:38.323 --> 03:52:47.046]  They're using it to dumb us down, control us, and basically psychologically condition us to accept
[03:52:48.103 --> 03:52:49.825]  The phase-out of humanity as we know it.
[03:52:49.825 --> 03:52:51.646]  This is an admitted globalist plan.
[03:52:51.646 --> 03:52:52.888]  It's in my film, Endgame.
[03:52:52.888 --> 03:52:54.409]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:52:54.409 --> 03:52:57.352]  You watch that film from 10 years ago?
[03:52:57.352 --> 03:52:58.193]  It's like prophecy.
[03:52:58.193 --> 03:52:58.793]  It's come true.
[03:52:58.793 --> 03:53:00.475]  But it wasn't prophecy.
[03:53:00.475 --> 03:53:04.078]  I was reading what they were planning at DARPA and these big companies then.
[03:53:04.078 --> 03:53:05.139]  And I made a film about it.
[03:53:05.139 --> 03:53:09.984]  And now, 10 years later, they've done 80% of what we said was going to happen in the next 20 years.
[03:53:11.894 --> 03:53:28.577]  It's very, very cynical, very, very cold-blooded, and they're racing to have monopolies that fully control society, where you just lazily order all the products from Amazon or other places, and they get government subsidies and government kickbacks to where nobody else can compete with them.
[03:53:29.557 --> 03:53:34.618]  And it totally consolidates and controls society, and they treat their employees the worst you could ever imagine.
[03:53:34.618 --> 03:53:42.641]  Just like Apple with the suicide nets, and forced abortions, and 17-hour workdays at their Foxconn facilities.
[03:53:42.641 --> 03:53:50.743]  And just every one of these companies is the most cold-blooded vicious, because they're run by psychopaths that virtue signal and tell you how liberal they are all day.
[03:53:51.889 --> 03:53:53.170]  Because they're the opposite, folks.
[03:53:53.170 --> 03:53:55.831]  They are seriously oppressive, dangerous people.
[03:53:55.831 --> 03:53:57.312]  But it's our lazy activity.
[03:53:57.312 --> 03:53:59.373]  It's our ordering products from these people.
[03:53:59.373 --> 03:54:03.195]  It's us going along with this and not being aware of it that allows it to happen.
[03:54:03.195 --> 03:54:07.758]  And that's why what I covered a year ago is now getting attention in the major press.
[03:54:07.758 --> 03:54:09.539]  And Amazon's getting major heat.
[03:54:09.539 --> 03:54:11.019]  And whistleblowers are coming out.
[03:54:11.019 --> 03:54:12.860]  And so they're panicking.
[03:54:12.860 --> 03:54:15.102]  And so they go and go, oh, let's just make fun of Alex Jones.
[03:54:15.742 --> 03:54:17.463]  You know, that's who we always target.
[03:54:17.463 --> 03:54:24.065]  So we go get Alex Jones, we play a clip, we laugh at it, to make everybody be at ease and think everything's okay.
[03:54:24.065 --> 03:54:25.986]  I had a cousin visiting just last week.
[03:54:25.986 --> 03:54:26.486]  Great guy.
[03:54:26.486 --> 03:54:35.389]  He was talking about one of his other brothers, who's also a great guy, who is paranoid and thinks that Amazon's Alexa is listening to him.
[03:54:35.389 --> 03:54:36.710]  I mean, that's in the news.
[03:54:36.710 --> 03:54:38.751]  And he knew full well what he was saying to me.
[03:54:38.751 --> 03:54:44.193]  It was more just of a, you know, I don't care and quit trying to, you know, warn me about things.
[03:54:45.180 --> 03:54:54.247]  And again, it's that attitude of millennials, it's that attitude of others, of just a cynical-ness like, I just ignore it all so it doesn't matter, that's destroying us!
[03:54:54.247 --> 03:55:00.812]  Because as we get more and more selfish about not caring, it allows crap like this to really screw people over.
[03:55:00.812 --> 03:55:03.054]  So again, this is a very serious issue.
[03:55:03.054 --> 03:55:10.140]  These are AI tentacles stretching out into all of our societies, all of our cultures, and it's being done to form giant, predatory monopolies.
[03:55:11.587 --> 03:55:15.389]  And it's being done to totally surveil us and bring us into a system beyond 1984.
[03:55:15.389 --> 03:55:24.154]  I mean, if I came and knocked on your door and I said, I want to put cameras in your house and watch you or listen to you, you'd say, I'm going to punch you in the nose.
[03:55:24.154 --> 03:55:25.595]  And you'd be right to say that.
[03:55:25.595 --> 03:55:37.822]  But when a big predatory company puts out a product and advertises cyanide like it's cherry pie, people just take the Trojan horses into their homes because it's how it's advertised.
[03:55:38.609 --> 03:55:45.592]  I think everybody should go read the story of the Trojan Horse and what happened with the Greeks and their enemies.
[03:55:45.592 --> 03:55:53.256]  Because whether it's a fable or whether it really happened throughout society and throughout culture and throughout history, it continues to really, really happen.
[03:55:53.256 --> 03:56:00.439]  And if we don't stick up for ourselves and stand up against these predatory companies that want global monopolies, we are going to get what we deserve.
[03:56:09.853 --> 03:56:11.995]  This will be a day long remembered.
[03:56:11.995 --> 03:56:13.937]  We've seen the end of the Clintons.
[03:56:13.937 --> 03:56:16.480]  We'll soon see the end of the globalists.
[03:56:16.480 --> 03:56:19.502]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[03:56:19.502 --> 03:56:22.385]  It's not true!
[03:56:22.385 --> 03:56:23.967]  That's impossible!
[03:56:23.967 --> 03:56:27.010]  Search your feelings, you know it to be true.
[03:56:51.914 --> 03:56:57.197]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[03:56:57.197 --> 03:56:58.398]  Move, bitch!
[03:56:58.398 --> 03:57:01.260]  Get out the way!
[03:57:01.260 --> 03:57:04.822]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag...
[03:57:05.723 --> 03:57:07.465]  It's the American flag!
[03:57:07.465 --> 03:57:12.009]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[03:57:12.009 --> 03:57:15.231]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[03:57:15.231 --> 03:57:16.873]  I will not let you down.
[03:57:16.873 --> 03:57:19.955]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:57:19.955 --> 03:57:22.017]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[03:57:22.017 --> 03:57:24.299]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[03:57:24.299 --> 03:57:29.263]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[03:57:29.263 --> 03:57:31.946]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:57:31.946 --> 03:57:32.947]  It's Alex Jones!
