[00:00.000 --> 00:10.580]  xbox test
[00:30.000 --> 00:44.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is September 4, 2019 on this Wednesday live edition, and it's
[00:44.320 --> 00:52.640]  with heavy heart that I have to tell you that I am now having to think about ways to trigger
[00:52.640 --> 00:57.760]  an initiative to begin the impeachment of Donald John Trump, the 45th President of the
[00:57.760 --> 01:04.320]  United States. It's a very, very grave situation, and when I woke up at 5 a.m. this morning and
[01:04.320 --> 01:09.000]  saw the article on infowaters.com and went to the Washington Post and read it, and then
[01:09.000 --> 01:16.720]  I did two plus hours of research, and I knew what I had to do. I had to come on air today
[01:16.720 --> 01:25.800]  and throw down the gauntlet to President Trump and just lay it out that we are not going
[01:25.800 --> 01:33.080]  to go quietly into that dark night of technocracy. Now I want to be clear, President Trump may
[01:33.080 --> 01:39.960]  not actually be supporting what I'm about to announce, that they say he is supporting.
[01:39.960 --> 01:48.320]  But regardless, he's got people in his administration that are supporting it, and if they are not
[01:48.320 --> 02:03.240]  healed in, then it's clear the President is playing a double game. Now, all yesterday
[02:03.240 --> 02:10.080]  I talked about, does President Trump know when he releases the Pentagon and DARPA against
[02:10.080 --> 02:18.040]  quote, memes that that's mainly his supporters? And they're even calling Mitch McConnell in
[02:18.040 --> 02:23.200]  the DARPA statements, Moscow Mitch. I mean, this is the outside globalist group destroyed
[02:23.200 --> 02:28.840]  the country, and Trump's doing nothing to block the funding of this. In fact, he's got
[02:28.840 --> 02:33.240]  some people in his administration running around cheerleading it, but that's not where
[02:33.240 --> 02:45.800]  we're going today. That's in the same wheelhouse. Now, I've done massive preparation for this
[02:45.800 --> 02:51.200]  broadcast. Let me show folks an overhead shot, please. I'm going to show folks. Yeah, pull
[02:51.200 --> 02:54.800]  back for him. I want a wide overhead shot. A wide overhead shot is kind of with my head
[02:54.800 --> 02:58.840]  right here, and you can see all the articles. Yeah, that's what I want when I ask for that.
[02:58.840 --> 03:09.920]  Now, when I come back, I'm going to tell you what Trump's done. And what's being proposed.
[03:09.920 --> 03:15.760]  The headline is live on info wars.com and news wars.com. And we're going to add the
[03:15.760 --> 03:22.520]  live feed of the show into the article covering this that's linked up on drugs report.com.
[03:22.520 --> 03:33.080]  But when I come back, we're going to cover it. Now, Paul Watson's article strong, but
[03:33.080 --> 03:42.760]  it's not strong enough. He'll be joining us at 15 after Trump administration considering
[03:42.760 --> 03:48.400]  social credit score systems determined who can buy a gun. Now, when you actually read
[03:48.400 --> 03:55.760]  the proposal, it's so many times worse than that, that it's staggering. It's not just
[03:55.760 --> 04:03.960]  the end of the process and a digital red flag. It is a consortium of psychologists and psychiatrists
[04:03.960 --> 04:13.560]  in DARPA with a new agency they're setting up called Harpa, where all of your smart devices
[04:13.560 --> 04:18.840]  listen to you in live time, which they're already doing, but they admit it in the paper and
[04:18.840 --> 04:28.560]  report back to big tech that runs it for the shadow government. All they did was basically
[04:28.560 --> 04:35.240]  get everybody to opt in the last 20 years to social media into the NSA to waive your
[04:35.240 --> 04:42.400]  rights. And now they're dropping the hammer on us. And Trump is reportedly set to push
[04:42.400 --> 04:46.320]  this. So this is their coming out. Now that you know they're listening to you, think of
[04:46.320 --> 04:51.880]  that scandal. Now this is their coming out, where they're just going to say, yeah, that's
[04:51.880 --> 04:56.160]  right. By the way, your social score gets downgraded if you don't carry a smartphone
[04:56.160 --> 05:00.720]  so they can listen to you. That means they can't trust you. It's been a year since
[05:00.720 --> 05:05.760]  info wars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube. We had over 5 billion
[05:05.760 --> 05:09.720]  views when we got banned and we're credited with getting Donald Trump elected because
[05:09.720 --> 05:14.320]  we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots. Now as we enter the 2020 election
[05:14.320 --> 05:19.080]  cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable
[05:19.080 --> 05:26.360]  to block the signal. And it's now here. Banned.video. Banned.video is the answer for libertarians,
[05:26.360 --> 05:33.640]  conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform
[05:33.640 --> 05:38.600]  where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are still available. Watch your favorite
[05:38.600 --> 05:43.240]  content for media personalities banned by big tech. Works on every device. Take your

[05:54.320 --> 06:21.080]  Twitter, SMS, email and more. Banned.video.
[06:21.080 --> 06:26.720]  So I'm sure all of you have noticed in the last six months, there have been thousands
[06:26.720 --> 06:37.360]  of articles in TV news programs saying, hey, it's true. Over 40 different home assistants,
[06:37.360 --> 06:42.480]  including smart speakers in your boat or your car or your RV or your home, are listening
[06:42.480 --> 06:50.040]  to you. And in many cases, there's now cameras on these devices. They're watching you and
[06:50.040 --> 06:56.320]  they're reporting it all back to big tech and to AI and to whole teams of people that
[06:56.320 --> 07:01.720]  are specifically going into the recordings and listening to key parts of it because keyword
[07:01.720 --> 07:09.280]  is all recorded and put into a text file that's then searchable. Now, that's beyond 1984.
[07:09.280 --> 07:12.840]  And we've had all these big tech heads come out in the last week and say, you know, it's
[07:12.840 --> 07:20.920]  really not a big deal. We need to just accept that you're being listened to and you're
[07:20.920 --> 07:27.200]  being watched and there's no such thing as privacy. And they're coming out saying, and
[07:27.200 --> 07:32.040]  yes, you're smart TVs listening to you and watching you. And yes, all the new speakers
[07:32.040 --> 07:37.160]  you buy and your dishwashers, just everything has a microphone in it. Just like the head
[07:37.160 --> 07:42.160]  of the CIA said a decade ago, we'll watch you via your dishwasher. None of this stops
[07:42.160 --> 07:48.600]  crime. None of this stops terrorist. This is all used to spy and control the population
[07:48.600 --> 07:54.160]  and put into giant algorithms to then track populations and be able to manipulate populations
[07:54.160 --> 08:01.560]  and be able with a global social credit score to control your every movement. Already tens
[08:01.560 --> 08:05.480]  of millions of flights canceled. Two and a half million people not allowed to ride on
[08:05.480 --> 08:09.340]  a train or a bus. The Chinese government said this year you won't be able to move two feet
[08:09.340 --> 08:15.120]  outside your door if you haven't submitted. And then of course you submit and it's always
[08:15.120 --> 08:20.440]  more and more and more they want. So why? Why am I so upset? Why am I so concerned?
[08:20.440 --> 08:27.000]  The story's up on infowars.com and newswars.com. It's also at prisonplanet.com. But the easiest
[08:27.000 --> 08:33.680]  place to find it is drudgereport.com. We've also added the live feed to this broadcast.
[08:33.680 --> 08:38.160]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us in the next segment. We're going to be laying all of this out,
[08:38.160 --> 08:42.280]  but you need to share this so we have a chain reaction and resist because here's what I'm
[08:42.280 --> 08:49.280]  getting in. We have a right and a duty to know we're being listened to and being watched.
[08:49.280 --> 08:53.120]  We need to know these big predatory companies have lied to Congress, lied to us, lied to
[08:53.120 --> 09:01.400]  everyone and are doing it because, and I'm going to show you the proof, this is an admitted
[09:01.400 --> 09:13.800]  DARPA program adopted as U.S. policy in 1962. And they laid out the social media system,
[09:13.800 --> 09:20.160]  how they would launch it by 2000, how they would have a Facebook. I'm going to show
[09:20.160 --> 09:26.640]  you all the public documents and how finally they would make all these systems so addictive
[09:26.640 --> 09:30.640]  that you will give up on your family, give up on your neighbors and become completely
[09:30.640 --> 09:40.360]  habitualized to a, quote, symbiosis with computers and a merger with machines. Remember
[09:40.360 --> 09:46.680]  NBC News a week and a half ago. Cyborgs will replace humans and remake the world. James
[09:46.680 --> 09:54.960]  Lovelock says humans will be obsolete by this generation and will be extinct. That's the
[09:54.960 --> 10:01.840]  first paragraph. So understand, those building this architecture are building all of this
[10:01.840 --> 10:06.680]  to lower your IQ, to make you lonely, to make you alone, to make you not have an attention
[10:06.680 --> 10:13.120]  span and to cause you to have basically narcoleptic style brain disorders that are exploding more
[10:13.120 --> 10:19.360]  than 50,000% last number I saw. The public is in a trans-zombie state. Stand around at
[10:19.360 --> 10:24.000]  the mall or grocery store, look at most people. They look like dead zombies. Go to a rodeo
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.720]  or some right wing event. People's eyes are on fire and they're awake and they're alive.
[10:28.720 --> 10:33.240]  This whole leftist culture is about domestication and spiritual death. Now let me give you the
[10:33.240 --> 10:40.320]  big news. I don't go after Trump to get brownie points with people. I don't hedge my bets
[10:40.320 --> 10:43.640]  to get the left off my back. They're going to come after me regardless because I'm against
[10:43.640 --> 10:51.640]  their anti-human project. But Trump, the Washington Post reports, and that doesn't
[10:51.640 --> 10:57.320]  mean it's true, but it means the proposal has been brought to him repeatedly, is considering
[10:57.320 --> 11:02.040]  and it's one of his best friends who is proposing it to him, that we know is true, with Ivanka
[11:02.040 --> 11:08.320]  Trump quarterbacking it, to have all devices listen and watch. Now they're already doing
[11:08.320 --> 11:11.160]  it, but you're ever wondering how they're going to come out with it instead of all this
[11:11.160 --> 11:15.400]  bad PR because they're having to admit they're doing it because of Terms of Service, because
[11:15.400 --> 11:22.400]  of lawsuits, because of us first breaking it, 2004 with the documents from Google. Think
[11:22.400 --> 11:30.800]  about that, 15 years ago. So what are they going to have to do? They need a coming out.
[11:30.800 --> 11:36.880]  And so the coming out is, oh, a new federal agency, it's already set up. DARPA was set
[11:36.880 --> 11:42.720]  up by psychiatrists, and I'm going to show you the documents, to run all of this and
[11:42.720 --> 11:47.760]  to track how their propaganda is working on you, and how you would have handheld computers
[11:47.760 --> 11:52.720]  that would then wirelessly or plug into central terminals to track everything you do, your
[11:52.720 --> 12:01.040]  currency would be on it. All of this was proposed by the head scientist at DARPA and put into
[12:01.040 --> 12:09.120]  public papers in 1962. It's DARPA and the Brain Initiative. And it says it word for
[12:09.120 --> 12:14.120]  word, you're merger with machines, and then I'm going to give you the key. They were tasked
[12:14.120 --> 12:22.080]  in 1951, the Carnegie Endowment for Ending War. And then they created State Department
[12:22.080 --> 12:27.600]  of Random 7277, I'm going to show you. And they said the only way to end war is to end
[12:27.600 --> 12:34.400]  humanity. And the only way to do it is to remove the family, the sexes, and make us
[12:34.400 --> 12:44.320]  units that live in tanks. And our own heat will then power the circuitry in a human
[12:44.320 --> 12:48.800]  machine interface. Now you may have heard of that in 1999 film, The Matrix. That's all
[12:48.800 --> 12:57.400]  revelation and the method. I'm going to show you, after Paul Watson leaves us in the second
[12:57.400 --> 13:05.240]  hour, I have got more than 100 documents directly from DARPA, directly from MIT that are public.
[13:05.240 --> 13:12.320]  This is public. And you're going to reach stuff from 1962 that is all now happened exactly
[13:12.320 --> 13:19.200]  as they said. Now people are going to want to augment with the microchips and the wires
[13:19.200 --> 13:25.440]  next year that Elon Musk is rolling out, you'll need to upgrade. And then soon it'll be, hey,
[13:25.440 --> 13:29.000]  you'll live forever supposedly. It's going to be great. Just put your body in this tank
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.720]  and then as your body prepares to transition, you'll never know you just transitioned into
[13:32.720 --> 13:36.880]  The Matrix. Really, you're going to actually die. The truth is you don't live in those
[13:36.880 --> 13:41.520]  tanks. You die in those tanks. But they're going to plug into your pleasure centers where
[13:41.520 --> 13:46.680]  it's going to feel like 500 orgasms at once. And then they're going to plug you in and
[13:46.680 --> 13:52.440]  say, sign the paper. You're going to go, oh, hell, yeah. You're going to sign the paper
[13:52.440 --> 13:57.400]  and then you're going to go in the tank. They want to start putting people in tanks within
[13:57.400 --> 14:08.160]  10 years. That's been announced. So listen to me very carefully. They've already addicted
[14:08.160 --> 14:13.400]  your children. They've already addicted most of you. They've addicted myself, but I'm weaning
[14:13.400 --> 14:21.520]  off of it. This is real. This is the plan. And obviously, the globalists didn't get this
[14:21.520 --> 14:36.520]  out of the air. Some really bad folks cook this up. And let's just say they don't like
[14:36.520 --> 14:42.960]  people too much. So everybody better decide which side you're going to be on here, ladies
[14:42.960 --> 14:49.960]  and gentlemen, because El Diablo is cleared to fire right now. And we're going into it.
[14:49.960 --> 14:58.160]  Global government, mark of the beast. And it's here. We're the prequel, you see, to
[14:58.160 --> 15:01.880]  the matrix. This is the prequel right now. They know that they show you revelation of
[15:01.880 --> 15:08.040]  the method. You won't oppose it once it actually starts happening. We'll just think, oh, that's
[15:08.040 --> 15:12.080]  a movie, but your subconscious will be prepared and accepting and it won't be alien. It will
[15:12.080 --> 15:16.240]  seem natural. So you will conform and see it at a Pavlovian level where you're eating
[15:16.240 --> 15:22.760]  milk duds and a cherry slurpee and a hot dog at the movie. While you're watching these
[15:22.760 --> 15:27.520]  horrible things, you were being imprinted that it was non-threatening entertainment.
[15:27.520 --> 15:34.840]  You understand. There are a lot of paths. They may just go with the biological weapon
[15:34.840 --> 15:40.800]  extermination of humanity. But on the books is this plan. And this is the dominant plan.
[15:40.800 --> 15:44.640]  And Trump reportedly is set to roll it out and tell you everything you're doing is being
[15:44.640 --> 15:49.040]  watched and listened to and will confiscate your guns under a red flag that destroys all
[15:49.040 --> 15:54.360]  the process and is run by government psychiatrists inside big tech. This is their total revolution.
[15:54.360 --> 15:56.200]  We'll break it all down and stay with us.
[15:56.200 --> 16:01.520]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[16:01.520 --> 16:06.080]  my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[16:06.080 --> 16:10.120]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people
[16:10.120 --> 16:14.120]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you
[16:14.120 --> 16:18.120]  owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless

[16:45.440 --> 16:50.040]  endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic
[16:50.040 --> 16:53.920]  flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding
[16:53.920 --> 16:58.040]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move
[16:58.040 --> 17:02.760]  it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[17:02.760 --> 17:06.640]  if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory. So here's what you should do right now. Check
[17:06.640 --> 17:13.800]  out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com. Over a thousand
[17:13.800 --> 17:17.880]  dollars in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too. And the best part, you're

[18:00.440 --> 18:05.840]  God bless you. I have an idea for a new info wars t shirt instead of this is your brain.
[18:05.840 --> 18:09.720]  This is your brain on drugs. This is your brain. This is your brain on 5g.
[18:09.720 --> 18:10.720]  Oh, yeah.
[18:10.720 --> 18:13.920]  Showing your brain, getting frat. Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[18:13.920 --> 18:18.880]  Totally changed my life. I use turbo force bodies, alpha power, brain force, fish oil,
[18:18.880 --> 18:23.920]  ultra 12 daily X two every several days. Now, what I've found is, is really combining them
[18:23.920 --> 18:29.440]  is a totally synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products.
[18:29.440 --> 18:32.200]  And I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them. I just want to say
[18:32.200 --> 18:33.200]  why not?
[18:33.200 --> 18:36.800]  Well, you're right. All of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric
[18:36.800 --> 18:40.400]  or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the
[18:40.400 --> 18:44.000]  coke, you 10 and bio PQQ and all the rest of it. All of these are things that are like
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.440]  rocket fuel on the body. You take these bases together, then you have your foundation. Now
[18:48.440 --> 18:52.400]  you can build the big strong temple with these products I take when I were literally remembered
[18:52.400 --> 18:56.040]  to take them. It makes my life so much better. And then it funds the information war, which
[18:56.040 --> 18:59.040]  is so critical. Thank you so much. God bless you.
[18:59.040 --> 19:03.880]  Thermal vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've
[19:03.880 --> 19:10.400]  had it. It is a award winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies
[19:10.400 --> 19:15.800]  in the nation that we've been private labeling. It is cold pressed. It takes at least three
[19:15.800 --> 19:21.080]  times the herbs that are wild crafted and organic to be able to produce this. It's not
[19:21.080 --> 19:27.840]  boiled. It's not heated. It's never been dried. It's taken from fresh herbs. That's why it's
[19:27.840 --> 19:34.440]  so strong. That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina and energy. And I'm so excited
[19:34.440 --> 19:40.680]  about super mill vitality and carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with every order of
[19:40.680 --> 19:47.040]  super mill vitality at 25% off a free bottle of carnivore digestive enzyme. We're going
[19:47.040 --> 19:51.600]  to sell out of this very quickly, but it's an offer so that you experience how amazing
[19:51.600 --> 20:01.960]  both these products are. Secure yours at m4store.com today or m4slife.com.
[20:01.960 --> 20:24.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:24.320 --> 20:38.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday, September 4th, 2019, global
[20:38.280 --> 20:43.400]  transmission. We're reaching millions of people on AM and FM stations, TV stations in the
[20:43.400 --> 20:48.720]  course of our own streams at infowars.com and newswars.com. You know why? Because we've
[20:48.720 --> 20:54.680]  been banned off every platform. You can't even say my name or show infowars.com in positive
[20:54.680 --> 21:00.520]  light as of three months ago on Facebook. You talk about incredible censorship, incredible
[21:00.520 --> 21:06.560]  authoritarianism. Well, now DrudgeReport.com is top linked, the big giant link, social
[21:06.560 --> 21:13.880]  credit score to determine who can buy a gun. President Trump, according to the Washington
[21:13.880 --> 21:24.880]  Post, is saying that they want the devices, your Alexa from Amazon, your Google Assist,
[21:24.880 --> 21:29.680]  all the systems from Facebook to listen and watch you. And if you say something violent
[21:29.680 --> 21:35.960]  or dangerous, all of it sent back live time to DARPA and big tech with a new agency called
[21:35.960 --> 21:43.640]  HARPA, with health and human services and then extrajudicially, you will lose your guns under
[21:43.640 --> 21:49.200]  red flags and or you can't buy a gun. And I said it when I started the broadcast. If
[21:49.200 --> 21:55.440]  Trump supports this, then he needs to be impeached. Violates the Fourth Amendment, new process,
[21:55.440 --> 22:03.560]  the shooter in Florida last year, Mr. Cruz threatened 44 times to kill people at the
[22:03.560 --> 22:10.440]  school. The police were called 44 times, the FBI twice. We had our early warnings. All
[22:10.440 --> 22:13.800]  these shooters wouldn't have been stopped with this, but what it is is the rollout of
[22:13.800 --> 22:17.760]  all the devices admittedly listening to everybody. And I'm going to go over all those articles
[22:17.760 --> 22:22.640]  for the rest of the hour with Paul Joseph Watson who wrote the story that's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[22:22.640 --> 22:26.380]  And this is a human action. If everybody can share that link and make this the biggest
[22:26.380 --> 22:32.160]  story in the world, then we can really have a debate about this because if you're wondering
[22:32.160 --> 22:35.560]  how they're going to roll out, the fact they're listening to all of us, the privatization
[22:35.560 --> 22:40.560]  of NSA spy grid making Orwell blush. Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is it. You opt
[22:40.560 --> 22:48.200]  in. They do this. And well, let's be clear, Paul, they say Trump is starting to support
[22:48.200 --> 22:52.840]  this. I have the quotes here. And then obviously they say Ivanka is pushing this and the guy
[22:52.840 --> 22:58.000]  proposing it is one of Trump's best friends. Of course, he's just the front guy for DARPA.
[22:58.000 --> 23:03.000]  They admit that. So that's why this is so dangerous. And I think Trump is giving it
[23:03.000 --> 23:08.480]  ear. This is the total big brother acceptance. This is the AI surveillance grid takeover.
[23:08.480 --> 23:13.120]  This is the global social score. This is the end of the due process. This is I mean, I've
[23:13.120 --> 23:18.000]  got to think that the Washington Post is engaged in deception. But regardless, I don't want
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.240]  to hate Ivanka Trump or Jared Kushner. Everybody keeps saying they're in bed with Google. Well,
[23:22.240 --> 23:26.920]  Google's proposing this. Apple's proposing this. Tim Cook goes out to dinner with Kushner
[23:26.920 --> 23:32.600]  and Ivanka. So all I can say is, hey, guys, I don't want to live in brave new world meets
[23:32.600 --> 23:40.040]  THX 1138 meets Gattaca meets a nightmare system. Paul Joseph Watson. This is an incredible
[23:40.040 --> 23:48.600]  moment in 2019. Well, exactly, Alex. And it goes back to 2006, literally 13 years ago
[23:48.600 --> 23:53.120]  when we came out with the first big report, government industry to use computer microphones
[23:53.120 --> 24:00.080]  to spy on 150 million Americans. That was an article that we found September 2006, almost
[24:00.080 --> 24:06.800]  to the day it was September 6 predicting everything that would happen. Of course, in 2013, just
[24:06.800 --> 24:13.200]  before the rollout of Google Home, Amazon Echo and Alexa, these home hub devices that
[24:13.200 --> 24:18.320]  listen to your conversations and basically surveil your entire existence to help you
[24:18.320 --> 24:23.360]  with telling you what food you should buy and how to get to work the best route possible
[24:23.360 --> 24:28.760]  and stuff like that. Right as they were releasing those or like a year before, Google engineering
[24:28.760 --> 24:33.320]  director Scott Hoffman came out and said that it was eventually designed to be a chip in
[24:33.320 --> 24:38.800]  your brain. He literally put out in an article for the London Independent, December 2013,
[24:38.800 --> 24:43.080]  which we reported on as well, called conspiracy theorists at the time for doing so. No doubt.
[24:43.080 --> 24:48.000]  Quote, Google believes it can ultimately fulfill people's data needs by sending results directly
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.040]  to microchips implanted in its user's brains. Now, of course, not everyone's going to accept
[24:53.040 --> 24:56.600]  an implant in their brain, Alex, so they're probably going to, you know, make it a little
[24:56.600 --> 25:01.480]  tattoo that you can get on your wrist, make it cool, make it trendy, make the early adopters
[25:01.480 --> 25:06.880]  encourage the rest of the sheet to get branded with this technology. And it brings it up
[25:06.880 --> 25:12.440]  to today, Alex, where we've got this Harper proposal by the Trump administration being
[25:12.440 --> 25:18.800]  reported on by the Washington Post, where they want to catch early diagnosis of neuropsychiatric
[25:18.800 --> 25:25.040]  violence. How are they going to do it by measuring your physiological levels, your biological
[25:25.040 --> 25:31.200]  levels via Apple Watchers, Fitbit, Amazon Echo, and Google Home? How are they going
[25:31.200 --> 25:36.480]  to do that? They're going to measure the aggression, the anger in your voice, because as we know,
[25:36.480 --> 25:42.320]  these home hub surveillance devices record conversations. I pulled up this headline, Alex,
[25:42.320 --> 25:48.320]  from October last year, where they'd already prepared this. Amazon wants Alexa to detect
[25:48.320 --> 25:53.480]  when you are sick and sell you meds. They put out they've got the patent already, which
[25:53.480 --> 25:58.200]  says the upgrades would allow Alexa to detect abnormal physical conditions such as sore
[25:58.200 --> 26:04.120]  throats and coughs, even psychological ones, such as an excited emotional state or a sad
[26:04.120 --> 26:09.160]  emotional state. So they've already got the patent for the technology. Now, Giovanka,
[26:09.160 --> 26:14.560]  the Globalist Alliance is saying that this could be used to prevent Americans from buying
[26:14.560 --> 26:20.760]  guns because those surveillance devices could detect anger, could detect a slippery staff
[26:20.760 --> 26:27.160]  down to a level of resentment where people are too angry, too hyper to be able to buy
[26:27.160 --> 26:28.840]  guns. This is frightening.
[26:28.840 --> 26:34.440]  Paul, I want people to pull back and understand. I'm going to show people later in the last
[26:34.440 --> 26:38.880]  second of the hour when you're with me, the actual original MIT documents where they laid
[26:38.880 --> 26:43.680]  all this out right on the timeline. They're following it exactly. It sounds like science
[26:43.680 --> 26:48.680]  fiction. We're in the year 2019. They are admitting that everything you do, your interactions
[26:48.680 --> 26:53.520]  with your children, your interactions with your mate, your significant other, everything,
[26:53.520 --> 26:58.440]  and then there's no judge, no jury. It's all psychiatrists and bureaucrats and SJWs in
[26:58.440 --> 27:04.480]  big tech interfacing with US intelligence that will just claim your violent or your bad
[27:04.480 --> 27:10.600]  and pre-crime and disappear you. This is beyond minority report. This is beyond any novel,
[27:10.600 --> 27:18.200]  any movie because truth is stranger than fiction. This is just so tyrannical out of the gates
[27:18.200 --> 27:22.240]  and then to know that because it's in the Washington Post, Ivanka Trump admits she's
[27:22.240 --> 27:27.440]  pushing this. So I'm sorry, Ivanka, I mean, this is the whole architecture. It's always
[27:27.440 --> 27:33.600]  been meant to do this. Now it's here. We've got to form a global debate and say no to
[27:33.600 --> 27:34.600]  this.
[27:34.600 --> 27:37.800]  Precisely because we know where it's going, Alex. In China, the government just cracked
[27:37.800 --> 27:44.520]  that they'd restricted 2.5 million people in the months of July alone from buying plane
[27:44.520 --> 27:49.120]  tickets because they had bad social credit scores. You've got all these apologists out
[27:49.120 --> 27:54.600]  in the Western media saying, oh, it's just to ensure good behavior. Literally 2.5 million
[27:54.600 --> 28:01.440]  people plus 90,000 people in China cannot travel, cannot buy plane or train tickets because
[28:01.440 --> 28:07.080]  of what? Well, here's the list. Bad driving, smoking on trains, buying too many video games,
[28:07.080 --> 28:11.760]  buying too much junk food, buying too much alcohol, calling a friend who has a low credit
[28:11.760 --> 28:17.080]  score. So if you're friends with someone who misbehaves, that impacts you. Posting fake
[28:17.080 --> 28:21.200]  news. What is fake news? Anything that disagrees with the mainstream media? Criticizing the
[28:21.200 --> 28:25.240]  government, visiting an authorized website, walking your dog without a leash, letting
[28:25.240 --> 28:30.000]  your dog bark too much. They even talk about preventing people and have prevented people
[28:30.000 --> 28:35.120]  in China from using dating websites. Literally micro management of every facet of your life.
[28:35.120 --> 28:40.360]  And it's in place now. 1.4 billion people are already under it. Our tech giants built
[28:40.360 --> 28:45.880]  it. It's coming here and who's resisting it? Matt Grudge, Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson,
[28:45.880 --> 28:53.280]  the American people. Wow. This isn't the science fiction movie, folks. You're in it. It's 2019.
[28:53.280 --> 29:01.520]  Stay with us. Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and
[29:01.520 --> 29:06.760]  high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there. Loss of
[29:06.760 --> 29:11.720]  energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just
[29:11.720 --> 29:16.640]  a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong. Hear how heart and body extract

[33:01.480 --> 33:22.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.480 --> 33:51.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:51.480 --> 33:56.440]  Call the police on you. They're all doing it. It's been the plan since the beginning.
[33:56.440 --> 33:59.920]  I'm going to show you all the documents next hour and some next segment. We're going back
[33:59.920 --> 34:07.560]  to Paul Watson in a moment. But here's a piece where we spliced George Lucas' THX1138
[34:07.560 --> 34:33.560]  dystopia film in with the reality of Alexa here it is.
[34:33.560 --> 34:38.560]  What's wrong? I think nothing really. I just feel that I need something stronger. If you
[34:38.560 --> 34:43.560]  have a problem, don't hesitate to ask for assistance. Yes, thank you. I'll be alright.
[34:43.560 --> 34:51.360]  Call 348-5. We are sorry, but we must deny your request. Birthborns are not allowed more
[34:51.360 --> 34:58.560]  than five units of interval. Remember, substitution of interval for etracine may cause a serious
[34:58.560 --> 35:07.560]  chemical imbalance. Thank you. Work hard. What's wrong? Increase production. What's wrong?
[35:07.560 --> 35:19.560]  Prevent accidents. What's wrong? And be happy. What's wrong? If you feel you are not properly
[35:19.560 --> 35:29.560]  vaccinated, call 348-844 immediately. Failure to do so may result in prosecution or criminal
[35:29.560 --> 35:41.560]  drug evasion. What's wrong? If you are receiving this transmission, be welcome to assist.
[35:41.560 --> 35:46.680]  So, I'm going to tell this story next hour and I'm going to get my dad in here sometime
[35:46.680 --> 35:50.680]  because he was like top of his class and it wasn't even a big secret when he went to
[35:50.680 --> 35:56.280]  UT plan two. That's when you were in high school, like a junior, and they were there
[35:56.280 --> 35:59.560]  in the botany department, the science department, and they go, here's the secret nuclear reactor
[35:59.560 --> 36:03.520]  nobody knows about and we're running worldwide eugenics and you're going to be the chosen
[36:03.520 --> 36:08.240]  kids. It was only like six in his group and he ended up going to UT and the rest of it,
[36:08.240 --> 36:12.560]  but they had CD-ROM back then. They were talking about social media in the future and everyone
[36:12.560 --> 36:17.400]  would be wired in and controlled and my dad wrote a paper that got basically put into
[36:17.400 --> 36:21.640]  the government and looked at it and adopted it in some ways and sometime I might get him,
[36:21.640 --> 36:26.560]  he's got a copy of the paper to let me republish it because it's never been published or seen,
[36:26.560 --> 36:31.720]  but it was information energy and how you could basically have fiat currency in the future
[36:31.720 --> 36:36.880]  just off what they were calling social media and how people would basically pay for that
[36:36.880 --> 36:44.480]  and be paid in the new fiat system. Kind of the casino gulag system that decades later
[36:44.480 --> 36:49.440]  Max Kaiser talked about. So they were all brainstorming about this even with the younger
[36:49.440 --> 36:54.360]  people wanting to get their ideas for building the thing they built. So this is the whole
[36:54.360 --> 36:59.760]  world project. This is the future. This is the system. And notice there's been no discussion,
[36:59.760 --> 37:02.320]  no debate about it because you're not supposed to know about that. You're supposed to watch
[37:02.320 --> 37:06.120]  football and watch movies and do whatever you do and that's fine while they're building
[37:06.120 --> 37:11.200]  the system that is anti-human and will surveil everything you do and turn over to big tech
[37:11.200 --> 37:15.440]  and this psychiatric elite who they admit is going to run this, everything you do and
[37:15.440 --> 37:21.960]  all your records for your own good. Paul, please continue. Your story, again, is top-linked
[37:21.960 --> 37:27.040]  at drubsreport.com, the big giant top link and our live feed is there. If listeners and
[37:27.040 --> 37:31.680]  viewers watching this, share this on your email, your Facebook, your Twitter, your YouTube,
[37:31.680 --> 37:36.280]  your word of mouth that will cause a chain reaction. Usually when we get linked on drugs
[37:36.280 --> 37:40.680]  like this, we get a couple hundred thousand to a million people tuning in when he has
[37:40.680 --> 37:45.640]  a small link. But when he linked a year ago, whenever they lied and said that I said no
[37:45.640 --> 37:49.280]  one died at Parkland, banned me on YouTube, I re-uploaded the video showing, I said the
[37:49.280 --> 37:55.920]  police stood down, the video got, it was two videos, 14 million views. So if we could get
[37:55.920 --> 38:01.320]  14 million extra people watching this, if you decide to share the link from drubsreport.com
[38:01.320 --> 38:05.680]  folks, that will really reach a lot of new people, which horrifies big tech, which they
[38:05.680 --> 38:11.600]  work around the clock to make sure as this system goes from beta to live, as it goes
[38:11.600 --> 38:19.840]  from test to the true AI total surveillance rollout of a system of psychiatric controllers.
[38:19.840 --> 38:26.240]  You watched THX 1138. Why did a graduate student make a student version and then his first
[38:26.240 --> 38:31.040]  film was about this? Well, George Lucas has talked about it. They were teaching him that
[38:31.040 --> 38:37.120]  in his advanced film school that this is the future. Psychiatrists through computer terminals
[38:37.120 --> 38:41.960]  will run everyone's lives and watch everyone and drug everyone. And we're almost there,
[38:41.960 --> 38:46.640]  aren't we? We're almost there, aren't we? So see, my dad was learning that at UT when
[38:46.640 --> 38:54.720]  he was 16. George Lucas was learning it as well when he was 18, 19. So that's why you
[38:54.720 --> 39:01.960]  keep seeing this in art, because it's the plan. It's the plan. And now the plan's all
[39:01.960 --> 39:08.040]  admitted Paul Joseph Watson. Well, the reason this was ignored for years, Alex, is because
[39:08.040 --> 39:12.400]  people did not care about being spied on because they thought, oh, what's the worst that could
[39:12.400 --> 39:16.280]  happen? You know, I get some ads in my email or I get some ads flash up on the television
[39:16.280 --> 39:21.360]  for products that I might be interested in. No, this is about punishment. Okay. They already
[39:21.360 --> 39:26.760]  have a system called patron scan, where if you walk into a bar, they scan your ID. It's
[39:26.760 --> 39:30.720]  linked to a database. And then if you've got anything on that database that somebody
[39:30.720 --> 39:36.000]  has deemed, you know, harmful or suspicious, you don't get into the bar. Life insurance
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.680]  companies are basing premiums now on social media posts. People are being banned by Uber,
[39:41.680 --> 39:47.680]  Airbnb, PayPal, which is taken over a bunch of credit card companies, by the way, as Facebook
[39:47.680 --> 39:52.760]  is taken over the crypto currencies for their political opinions. This isn't about corporations
[39:52.760 --> 39:59.040]  just gathering data to sell it on. Yes, partly that, but this is about reward and punishment.
[39:59.040 --> 40:06.320]  We reported back in 2012, Samsung smart televisions spying on people, recording their conversations
[40:06.320 --> 40:10.920]  uploading them to an internet server. Who cares? They just get your data. They sell
[40:10.920 --> 40:17.400]  your products. Well, then it came out in 2017, Wikileaks vault seven, the CIA had a program
[40:17.400 --> 40:23.360]  called weeping angel, where they exploited that vulnerability to hack into the televisions
[40:23.360 --> 40:28.640]  and to record your conversations and even to take computer snapshots. So it's not just
[40:28.640 --> 40:33.400]  corporations doing it. It's the government. It's the deep state. And the idea that these
[40:33.400 --> 40:39.640]  home devices, Alex, Amazon Echo, Google Home, et cetera, just capture a snapshot of your
[40:39.640 --> 40:43.760]  conversation like a few seconds before and after, so they can pick out the keyword is
[40:43.760 --> 40:49.680]  complete nonsense. Because last year, a new Hampshire judge ordered Amazon to turn over
[40:49.680 --> 40:57.280]  two days of Amazon Echo recordings in a double murder case. Why does Amazon have two days
[40:57.280 --> 41:04.240]  of recording because they're recording all the time? Yeah, they claim, oh, we just pick
[41:04.240 --> 41:08.480]  up a few seconds and then there's the keyword Alexa. What's this? What's that? No, they
[41:08.480 --> 41:14.080]  had two days of recordings of people's private conversations. A judge called for a subpoena
[41:14.080 --> 41:18.880]  bit. And where this is all going, Alex, as you know, as you've explained many times,
[41:18.880 --> 41:24.720]  this is going to the digital tattoo, the microchip, the two cast society whereby a lot of people
[41:24.720 --> 41:28.520]  will not accept this. They will not go along with it. They will refuse to upload their
[41:28.520 --> 41:33.680]  brains to computers like breakers, well, and all the futurists want to do. And they will
[41:33.680 --> 41:40.720]  be treated as second class third class citizens. They won't get the computer cybernetic interface,
[41:40.720 --> 41:46.040]  which basically turns you into a superhuman. And in comparison to that elite that do get
[41:46.040 --> 41:51.600]  access to that, you'll basically be an amoeba. He said it himself, Alex, age of spiritual
[41:51.600 --> 41:58.880]  machines 1999 quote, humans who do not utilize such implants are unable to meaningfully participate
[41:58.880 --> 42:06.960]  in dialogues with those who do. He cites the Unibomber Ted Kaczynski, Ray Kurzweil does,
[42:06.960 --> 42:11.360]  who predicts of this as well. So they actually say, and Paul, let's stop right there. Paul,
[42:11.360 --> 42:15.120]  let's stop. We're going to go to break. This isn't just you picking Ray Kurzweil. It's
[42:15.120 --> 42:20.320]  the cover of NBC last week. It's all of them. It's a cult. They've decided it's the post
[42:20.320 --> 42:25.240]  human world. They're the transhumanist and they're going to save the earth by depopulating
[42:25.240 --> 42:29.680]  us. That's why they said in NBC last week, humans by this generation will be extinct.
[42:29.680 --> 42:34.000]  It will be the rise of the cyborgs. This is beyond Hitler saying, I'll rule the world
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.240]  for 1000 years. This is these crazy technocrats who envisioned this, built it, launched it.
[42:39.240 --> 42:45.840]  And now we're going into the predatory operational mop up phase. This is hellish. Once the technologies
[42:45.840 --> 42:51.440]  in place, they intend to release bio weapons. They intend to release mass mobs using social
[42:51.440 --> 42:58.560]  media. They intend to bring down civilization except for their breakaway citadels. It's
[42:58.560 --> 43:03.640]  been a year since info wars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[43:03.640 --> 43:07.760]  We had over 5 billion views when we got banned and we're credited with getting Donald Trump
[43:07.760 --> 43:12.120]  elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots. Now as we enter
[43:12.120 --> 43:16.400]  the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the
[43:16.400 --> 43:23.640]  censors are unable to block the signal and it's now here. Band.video. Band.video is
[43:23.640 --> 43:30.200]  the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationals, pro gun, pro life, pro human individuals
[43:30.200 --> 43:36.280]  to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are still
[43:36.280 --> 43:40.920]  available. Watch your favorite content for media personalities banned by big tech. Works

[43:56.760 --> 44:15.280]  This is Savannah Hernandez for infowars.com. I'm reporting to you from Hong Kong where
[44:15.280 --> 44:30.800]  despite being the most banned broadcast in the free world, we continue to win because

[44:55.720 --> 44:59.000]  and things you need.

[45:03.680 --> 45:04.760]  had it.

[45:10.360 --> 45:12.560]  the nation that we've been private labeling.
[45:12.560 --> 45:14.160]  It is cold pressed.
[45:14.160 --> 45:19.680]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild crafted and organic to be able to
[45:19.680 --> 45:20.680]  produce this.
[45:20.680 --> 45:21.800]  It's not boiled.
[45:21.800 --> 45:22.800]  It's not heated.
[45:22.800 --> 45:23.800]  It's never been dried.
[45:23.800 --> 45:26.440]  It's taken from fresh herbs.
[45:26.440 --> 45:29.080]  That's why it's so strong.
[45:29.080 --> 45:32.800]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina and energy.
[45:32.800 --> 45:39.240]  And I'm so excited about Supermail Vitality and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with

[47:01.440 --> 47:17.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:17.840 --> 47:22.440]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson of summit.news.
[47:22.440 --> 47:26.480]  You also did this great work at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com.
[47:26.480 --> 47:32.480]  The only way this critical pro-human, pro-freedom information gets out, try to shape the future
[47:32.480 --> 47:40.200]  in a good way, not in a dystopic, technocracy way, is when you speak out and is when you
[47:40.200 --> 47:48.160]  by hand share the live feed at infowarstore.com or like Drudge is doing, top story on drudgereport.com.
[47:48.160 --> 47:50.800]  That's the top link on the internet, no one disputes that.
[47:50.800 --> 47:55.120]  Second largest website in the world, largest news site in the world, there it is, social
[47:55.120 --> 48:03.720]  credit score to determine who can buy a gun, Amazon Echo and Apple, watch would flag neuro
[48:03.720 --> 48:07.040]  psychiatric violence.
[48:07.040 --> 48:11.280]  That means when your brain is showing wavelengths of violence, I mean they prove that lie detectors
[48:11.280 --> 48:17.440]  were a fraud 50 years ago, said a lot of folks to death row in the gas chamber and lethal
[48:17.440 --> 48:22.400]  injection, but now they've got, oh big tech says the algorithm says, well they already
[48:22.400 --> 48:26.560]  say Trump's mentally ill, red flag laws would take his guns.
[48:26.560 --> 48:32.200]  They already violate the law, they already violate the regulations, they already violate
[48:32.200 --> 48:39.160]  the psychiatric board rules, violating the goldwater rule and they diagnose it from
[48:39.160 --> 48:45.640]  afar, they've had psychology today, diagnose me and make up all this crap.
[48:45.640 --> 48:49.640]  Psychology didn't start till Germany like 150 years ago, it's just a way to look at how
[48:49.640 --> 48:53.640]  people operate in the world and put labels on it and a lot of it you could say is true
[48:53.640 --> 48:57.400]  but a lot of it isn't and it was used in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany to oppress
[48:57.400 --> 49:02.400]  people and it's used in China to oppress people, but look at Hong Kong pulling down the face
[49:02.400 --> 49:08.520]  skating cameras, fighting back, that's an example to us all, the story's up on infowars.com
[49:08.520 --> 49:14.960]  and newswars.com right now, they've withdrawn the bill in Hong Kong to secretly arrest and
[49:14.960 --> 49:16.480]  disappear people.
[49:16.480 --> 49:23.600]  Let me show you that article, document cam shot please, Hong Kong leader withdrawing
[49:23.600 --> 49:31.600]  incendiary extradition bill, bill's introduction sparked massive protests and so you see the
[49:31.600 --> 49:35.680]  power of taking action, there's seven and a half billion of us, I'm not against technology,
[49:35.680 --> 49:41.080]  they always say oh people are troglodytes, they're against it, no, no, no, I'm not against
[49:41.080 --> 49:44.120]  a rifle, I'm not going to put it in my mouth and pull the trigger, that's technology, not
[49:44.120 --> 49:48.800]  against a phone, but it's not really a phone, it's a tracking and surveillance system and
[49:48.800 --> 49:52.400]  by the way the answer to this is just a mitigating factor, if you're not going to get rid of
[49:52.400 --> 49:56.920]  the so-called smart phones, they're really little digital minders, it's the phones that
[49:56.920 --> 50:01.640]  do it all but they know that you expect privacy on it so they never announce it's listening
[50:01.640 --> 50:07.480]  to you, it's the worst device but you opt in with the Alexa and the Google Assistant
[50:07.480 --> 50:12.840]  all these and so psychologically you're used to talking to it and so they're telling you
[50:12.840 --> 50:17.280]  oh we are listening to you for your own good but it's okay and they don't want you to
[50:17.280 --> 50:21.640]  really talk about this until it's ubiquitous but now it's being exposed so oh we'll stop
[50:21.640 --> 50:27.720]  the mass shootings with it, think about how out of control and how incredibly dangerous
[50:27.720 --> 50:32.280]  that is, we're going back to Paul Watson in a moment but please remember the system, the
[50:32.280 --> 50:37.960]  Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton is publicly her law firms financed over 30 lawsuits against
[50:37.960 --> 50:42.960]  M4 Wars when she lost, we've gotten over 30 of them thrown out and we're beginning to
[50:42.960 --> 50:47.080]  win on appeals at many other places, you never see that in the news but it's cost millions
[50:47.080 --> 50:52.520]  of dollars, we've got great products you already need so please go to m4warstore.com and get
[50:52.520 --> 50:59.080]  a Molon Labe t-shirt, get a Gadsden flag t-shirt, go and get some of the great supplements that
[50:59.080 --> 51:04.960]  they've got huge articles out demonizing, I mean here's an article right here, back
[51:04.960 --> 51:10.800]  in camp shop please, right brain, the new republic with myself and Ben Shapiro basically
[51:10.800 --> 51:16.800]  say we shouldn't be allowed to sell new tropics that Amazon sells and everybody else sells,
[51:16.800 --> 51:19.960]  of course they're best sellers because he was the guy that admits wow this stuff really
[51:19.960 --> 51:24.400]  woke me up and was clean energy and was much better than coffee, they even admit the article
[51:24.400 --> 51:29.920]  it works great but the FD80s just shut us down, incredible information on that front
[51:29.920 --> 51:35.920]  so get Turbo Force ladies and gentlemen which is the best new tropic out there, you're going
[51:35.920 --> 51:42.520]  to find the packets are incredibly strong, 10 hour clean energy focus with all the minerals

[51:52.520 --> 51:55.760]  Force, I went out and got the top firm in the country, had to pay them a bunch of money
[51:55.760 --> 51:59.440]  to give us the ultimate formula better than what they were putting out but they didn't
[51:59.440 --> 52:03.640]  want to put the money into it, so I got to tell you it's amazing, get a very low price
[52:03.640 --> 52:08.120]  for it for what you get in all these packets that come with it and it blows away the competition,

[52:27.040 --> 52:31.760]  going to be adding other contributors to it where you can have your own video, your own
[52:31.760 --> 52:38.640]  postings and it won't be censored like Google and YouTube and Facebook and Twitter, we're
[52:38.640 --> 52:43.840]  also providing the great folks at memeworld.com so again be sure and check out Band.video,
[52:43.840 --> 52:49.800]  bookmark it and then hand share it, circumventing the censors. Paul the magnitude of this, recapping
[52:49.800 --> 52:55.160]  what's happened, getting into Trump, you know you get big brownie points if you attack Trump,
[52:55.160 --> 52:57.840]  I haven't really done it, you haven't really done it because the alternative is Hillary
[52:57.840 --> 53:03.280]  and the Democrats but the red flag stuff, extrajudicial, killing Fourth Amendment, killing
[53:03.280 --> 53:07.520]  due process, wouldn't have stopped any of these mass shootings, these people all said
[53:07.520 --> 53:13.360]  they were going to kill people, most of them are Antifa, the Florida shooter 44 times,
[53:13.360 --> 53:17.280]  the police were called saying he was going to kill people, he was allowed to commit crimes,
[53:17.280 --> 53:22.440]  let out of jail, they let this happen, the police stood down. In almost every case these
[53:22.440 --> 53:29.040]  mass shootings were preventable but having Alexa or having Google assist or having Facebook's
[53:29.040 --> 53:33.160]  little, what's it's spy called, watching and listening to us and sending it back to DARPA
[53:33.160 --> 53:40.200]  to build psychological profiles with big tech, big psych and big pharma, admittedly that's
[53:40.200 --> 53:48.080]  what it says in the plan, all together with US intelligence agencies outside of law disappearing
[53:48.080 --> 53:51.960]  you or taking your guns or not letting you buy a gun or not letting you travel, this
[53:51.960 --> 53:58.160]  is hell on earth and we're told by the Washington Post who lies a lot that it's Ivanka Trump
[53:58.160 --> 54:02.720]  loves it, well I went and looked it up, I found her promoting in other places, I found
[54:02.720 --> 54:08.000]  her proposing it to Trump two years ago, so this article looks accurate that Trump is
[54:08.000 --> 54:12.640]  test ballooning this, what in the hell do you think is going on and what do we say to
[54:12.640 --> 54:17.160]  Trump because I want a supporting but my God, you talk about throwing the baby out with
[54:17.160 --> 54:24.280]  the bathwater, Paul Austin. I would ask why he's making an alliance with the very big
[54:24.280 --> 54:29.120]  tech companies that are banning and censoring his supporters left, right and center by
[54:29.120 --> 54:34.680]  teaming up with them to create what is a frightening Orwellian system, we know in China that again
[54:34.680 --> 54:40.320]  2.5 million people in the month of July alone, there's total millions and millions more prevented
[54:40.320 --> 54:44.760]  from buying plane tickets, you are going to get punished, you are punished Alex Jones
[54:44.760 --> 54:50.760]  by PayPal because of your political opinions, PayPal is taking over credit card companies,
[54:50.760 --> 54:55.320]  what happens when you go to buy groceries at the store, you put in your credit card,
[54:55.320 --> 55:01.040]  it says sorry denied because some pencil net in Silicon Valley doesn't like what you posted
[55:01.040 --> 55:06.840]  on Facebook, Facebook has made it clear, anything that disagrees with the narrative, the dogma
[55:06.840 --> 55:11.720]  put out by Mark Zuckerberg is not allowed on their platform, they literally ban people
[55:11.720 --> 55:16.560]  who post photos of you because you've been fully deperson, this is the ultimate end game
[55:16.560 --> 55:22.360]  of mass surveillance and we were talking about the widening golf alley between the underclass
[55:22.360 --> 55:25.800]  and the elite, how the elite are going to take on this technology, how it's not going
[55:25.800 --> 55:30.800]  to be available to the underclass and that's going to create more tensions in society,
[55:30.800 --> 55:37.640]  they just have to need stats out Alex, servant class jobs to cater for the needs of the elite
[55:37.640 --> 55:45.720]  rose 114% over the last 10 years, that's compared with just the 7% rise in overall jobs, so
[55:45.720 --> 55:52.240]  all those jobs, the pedicurus, the manicurus, the massages, the skins get specialist, they're
[55:52.240 --> 55:58.920]  all booming, they've got 3.2 million class service class workers in the United States,
[55:58.920 --> 56:04.840]  that's an increase of 2.8 million since 2010, the elite is importing migrants to become their
[56:04.840 --> 56:09.840]  wage slaves, the middle class is disappearing and we're not going to get access to this
[56:09.840 --> 56:16.920]  technology which turns our new elite into basically cyborg superheroes, so that is 25
[56:16.920 --> 56:20.280]  years in the future unless we stop it now.
[56:20.280 --> 56:25.840]  Paul, that's the moment we've reached here and they've been building the architecture
[56:25.840 --> 56:31.800]  for this the entire time, we like children have been kept out of the big adult table,
[56:31.800 --> 56:35.040]  I've gone and read all the documents, so if you were like, hey people might want to be
[56:35.040 --> 56:38.160]  informed, hey you might want to know, they put fluoride in the water to dumb you down,
[56:38.160 --> 56:43.680]  Obama's White House Science Zahar wrote that in 1974, 45 years ago, here's the page number,
[56:43.680 --> 56:48.160]  here it is, and then it's all out, I mean do you like lower IQs, you like cancer, you
[56:48.160 --> 56:53.200]  like breast cancer, I mean they know, Glyphosate grows breast tumors, document shot please,
[56:53.200 --> 56:59.640]  I want to show folks this article you mentioned, again, servant class, it's just absolutely
[56:59.640 --> 57:04.760]  amazing, servant class jobs to cater for the elite are booming, and that's what it's
[57:04.760 --> 57:09.880]  all about, we have the biggest income disparities ever, we have the biggest massive global corporations
[57:09.880 --> 57:14.480]  offshore paying almost no taxes, but then they're the very leftist groups funding Black
[57:14.480 --> 57:18.760]  Lives Matter and lobbying for higher taxes on the middle class here, they want to conquer,
[57:18.760 --> 57:22.000]  they want to vertically integrate, they are survival of the fittest, they are social
[57:22.000 --> 57:27.160]  dire on us, they are ruthless, Paul do a little bit more with us talking about how we fight
[57:27.160 --> 57:31.520]  back, and then you couldn't get more excited here folks, I don't have to put the excitement
[57:31.520 --> 57:36.280]  in my voice, I'm excited, this is a lot more important than the NFL Super Bowl, isn't it?
[57:36.280 --> 57:40.320]  It's about the whole future, I'm going to lay out the declassified documents where they
[57:40.320 --> 57:47.360]  planned all of this by 1962, a hundred times bigger than the Manhattan Project.
[57:47.360 --> 57:51.640]  In infowars life, we always try to bring you game changing products, now we've already
[57:51.640 --> 57:56.640]  been promoting and selling super silver wound gel for over a year, it's a best seller,
[57:56.640 --> 58:02.120]  it is the best you can get, a 100% review rate on power reviews, well now we teamed
[58:02.120 --> 58:07.360]  up with them and came out with two different types of skin cream, one is naturally sent
[58:07.360 --> 58:13.040]  up with grapefruit essential oils, the other is unscented, it's got hyaluronic acid, vitamin
[58:13.040 --> 58:20.280]  E, essential oils from grapefruit, it's got coconut oil and so much more, and this patented
[58:20.280 --> 58:25.440]  nano type of silver that has been proven to be the most effective and the best, it's got
[58:25.440 --> 58:31.000]  all these other great vitamins and compounds that are known to be wonderful for your skin,
[58:31.000 --> 58:35.800]  if you're a woman, man, if you're a child, we are so excited about the new super silver
[58:35.800 --> 58:41.320]  skin cream, we have it in the smaller tube and the large tube, it's very, very affordable,
[58:41.320 --> 59:07.800]  and it funds our operations, check it out today and get yours at InfoWarsLife.com.
[59:07.800 --> 59:14.560]  We've launched it ladies and gentlemen, it's now live, band.video, band.video isn't just
[59:14.560 --> 59:19.240]  going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Troyer or Paul Watson band
[59:19.240 --> 59:24.680]  videos, we are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted and where
[59:24.680 --> 59:30.360]  a growing list of freedom loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut
[59:30.360 --> 59:35.800]  down, free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms,
[59:35.800 --> 59:42.640]  the Hollywood scum and the globalist, freedom of speech has a home, it's called band.video.
[59:42.640 --> 59:51.400]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[59:51.400 --> 01:00:05.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:12.680]  You know, I'm not trying to toot my horn here, Alex Jones back live, I'm really upset, I'm
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.680]  really worried.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:20.400]  I mean, when my dad was in high school, he was already going to UT and he told me about
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.160]  this stuff when I was a kid.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:29.280]  Information energy, information currencies, how they had CD-ROMs, in like the mid 60s,
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:34.840]  the secret nuclear reactors, of course later, it's all come out, that was just standard,
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:39.640]  that was just standard for anybody that was being groomed for the technocracy.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.480]  And there are millions of people in the technocracy now and they know all about this and they
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:48.160]  talk to you like you're a child and they're building this whole thing and then now we're
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.120]  told Trump is looking to adopt.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.200]  Now again, I don't just believe the Washington Post, but then I went and looked it up, Ivanka
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:01.040]  and one of Trump's best friends that heads up this group is proposing DARPA do all this
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:07.520]  is a friend of Trump's and has said that Trump is looking to launch this.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:13.120]  Now whether that's true or not, they're trying to test balloon, AI that's already watching
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:20.040]  and listening to us, spying on us and controlling our behavior and extrajudicially outside due
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:29.840]  process, finding us guilty of thought crime, Paul, we are now living something far stranger,
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.160]  far stranger than 1984.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:38.240]  Well, Orwell couldn't even predict the levels of technology and how much they'd be interlinked.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:44.080]  You know, when he wrote that book over half a century ago, it's at a point in China now.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.920]  I keep seeing articles in the mainstream media saying, oh, it's not networks together, they'll
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.520]  never get it sorted out.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:54.200]  It's online to be all networked together in 2020.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:02:01.160]  They've already got areas in China, Shandong province, where people's trustworthiness rankings
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:06.400]  again, based on their personal behavior, their political opinions, what they buy, what TV
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:11.640]  programs they watch, where their trustworthiness rankings are displayed at the entrance to their
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.160]  own houses.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.000]  So you can tell if this person's been a bad individual if they said something naughty
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  out of turn.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.800]  If it's going to be installed there, it's going to be installed here.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.640]  They're already trying to do it in Hong Kong, which is why they're ripping down all the smart
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.640]  ones.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:28.760]  Paul, what do you think banning UNI's name and a positive mention on Facebook?
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.760]  That's the social score.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:33.080]  They're saying, you'll only say their name's the negative connotation.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:35.120]  That is beyond a cult.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:40.920]  That is beyond the branch divisions, beyond Jim Jones, beyond Hail Bob, beyond Heaven's
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:41.920]  Gate.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.920]  I mean, this is a total takeover.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:49.840]  Well, there's a meme, and it's like somebody taking a shower and Mark Zuckerberg's looking
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.120]  in the window, and it says something like, watch out, Zook's watching, and that's what
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.120]  it's all about.
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.720]  It's not just your behavior.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:02.160]  You can shut up, you can sell censor, but if you like a Facebook post or a tweet by somebody
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:06.080]  else or even follow them, now you're in the same league as them.
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:11.200]  They've had an entire matrix as mapped out, Alex, where people who have talked to other
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.160]  people on YouTube are part of this radicalization web.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.480]  It's all being pushed by the NG.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.200]  Oh, I've got an article here that will do five more minutes when we come back.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:26.480]  Leftist study calls for banning smart clusters, small clusters of right-wing thought criminals
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:32.080]  to avoid inflaming the entire hive, and when I read Senate hearings about banning conservatives
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:40.360]  yesterday on air, they said, anyone that stirs anybody up in any way, I mean, this is incredible.
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.360]  Anyone that foments dissent, what the hell do you think the First Amendment's about?
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.880]  When you don't like safe slavery, it was the abolitionists that fomented dissent.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.520]  Martin Luther King didn't like black people not being able to ride at the front of the
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.520]  bus.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.520]  He fomented dissent.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:00.960]  That's the whole point of America.
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:01.960]  What are solutions, Paul?
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:02.960]  We're going to break.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.200]  We'll come back and give you the floor for five minutes.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.360]  What are the solutions?
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.200]  Solutions are for the Trump administration to pass some kind of digital bill of rights
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:15.040]  to roll back the power that these big tech companies have to remove their immunity under
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.120]  Section 23, the Communications Act.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.760]  None of it's happened.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.240]  They promised it for months.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:25.240]  Instead, they're literally working with them, and Jovaint is pushing this red flag law,
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.680]  which is basically the social credit score as well.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:30.000]  So they're going in the opposite direction.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.440]  So the solutions that were possibly there are vast, but quickly disappearing, Alex, because
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:40.320]  apparently Trump administration doesn't want a lesson, doesn't find it important that their
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:46.320]  primary supporters, people who've got elected, are all being silenced and muscled out of existence.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.000]  Back in 60 seconds to conclude with Paul Watson about what we need to do about Trump is impeachment
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  in order.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  Is impeachment in order?
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  I'm serious.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.640]  There are only a few days left for you to get DNA Force Plus at 50% off and get a free

[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:14.120]  Defending the Republic from enemies, born and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:23.160]  Well, there was a big study came out yesterday where eating fast food over a long period
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.200]  of time can make you go blind.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:29.760]  There are cases of it where people, this is a testing on blind within one year.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:34.560]  I wonder if President Trump's gone blind because reportedly he eats fast food three,
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.160]  four times a day, loves cake, loves ice cream, hey, wonderful.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:42.400]  The truth is though, it's full of additives, full of crap, full of trans fats.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.400]  There it is.
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:48.440]  He ate a diet from fries and chips, left teen, fussy eater, blind from malnutrition.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:54.720]  But another big study came out yesterday mirroring that, but I'm not being sarcastic here.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:58.360]  Trump guzzles, can diet cokes a day?
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.920]  Now, diet coke breaks down to 87 degrees of wood alcohol.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:09.160]  Well, your temperature in your body is 98.8 or 98.6, I forget.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.960]  Wood alcohol is very addicting.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.960]  It's very toxic.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:16.480]  It's neurotoxin and excitotoxin, a toxin that gets you high.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:23.120]  Trump's gobbling MSG, Trump's gobbling, aspartame all day, you know, it makes monkeys go blind
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.080]  in studies, should never have been approved.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:29.440]  And you know, he's there, he's got stamina, I like a lot of what he does.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.560]  He's trying to make America great again, he's fighting the chai comms, but what's the point
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:37.240]  of defeating the chai comms if we just adopt the social credit score that China has?
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:44.480]  So if you just tuned in, Drugsupport.com has the top link right there for everybody, where
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:49.120]  the Washington Post, we'll put that on screen please, where the Washington Post is coming
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:55.360]  out and saying, oh, Ivanka, oh, Trump's top advisor, they've had all these meetings with
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:02.560]  him and Trump's really excited about a social score with DARPA and Big Tech in a partnership
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:07.320]  founding DARPA with a bunch of psychiatrists that will watch everything you do and put
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:11.240]  it in a digital database, and if we decide your heart rate's too high or you're under
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:15.560]  stress, we'll take your guns or I'll let you buy guns, and that's out of the gates they're
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:21.240]  saying, well, we have all these assistants listening to you.
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:25.880]  And so if they hear violence or family violence, and again, oh, sounds good, they put it in
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:29.200]  your house as a trojan horse, then they admit the government's using it.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:31.760]  And that's the point I made yesterday.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:37.040]  Experts and the Democrats are running Big Tech and having them in hearings spying on
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.520]  people and saying, I want Paul Watson off the Internet.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.160]  I want Alex Jones off the Internet.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.600]  I want Matt Drugs off the Internet.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:47.640]  I spent two hours yesterday showing you the articles, the congressional testimony, Rolling
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:52.680]  Stone admitting it, the government's running the censorship.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.200]  So Trump is involved, and he's not ignorant, folks.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.000]  I know he only uses patent paper.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.440]  I know that he dictates out the tweets, okay?
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.480]  I understand he's 73 years old.
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:04.480]  And I like the president.
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.480]  But you know what?
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.240]  I like freedom a lot more.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.760]  And this is shameful, Paul.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:12.520]  So I didn't say that for effect, you know, Ann Coulter's saying Trump's portrayed us every
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:13.520]  five minutes.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.920]  No, they've built a lot of border wall now.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.560]  He can't get Congress to fund it.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.560]  Mostly attacks are fake, okay?
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:23.480]  And I really care about Trump, but this is outrageous.
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:28.040]  And I don't have a bone to pick with Jared Kushner or with Ivanka Trump, but a lot of
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:32.280]  our top advisors, smart folks, and it's been in the news, which I don't just believe, but
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:39.120]  I see them themselves out with Google and Apple in face locks, you know, with Tim Cook,
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.960]  who says he supports Chinese censorship here in America.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:47.880]  And so it seems like a collapse into surveillance and so dangerous, the rollout of, yeah, we're
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:54.200]  listening to you, and government agencies with leftist psychiatrists and psychologists
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:58.760]  are going to be controlling everything you do, and then I go back to the founding of
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:03.320]  the internet plan that I'll cover once you're gone next segment, and they admitted the plan.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:08.440]  They're actually carrying out 1962 to 2019.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.800]  How many years is that, folks?
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.880]  How many years is that from 62?
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:13.880]  That's 38.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:19.920]  And then you add 19 to that 38, 19 folks, 38, 19.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.680]  Think about that.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:28.120]  They planned this whole thing out, and now it's happening.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.120]  It's unbelievable.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:32.360]  Paul, you've got the floor for the next six minutes.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.440]  What do we do about Trump?
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:34.440]  How do we counter this?
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:38.520]  Because the vacuum of him doing nothing is his supporters and hundreds of millions of
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.440]  accounts following him and all of it being deleted, and his own campaign ads aren't allowed
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.080]  to rum on Facebook and say strong women, and Mitch McConnell's blocked on Twitter and it's
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:47.080]  a rain of terror.
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:51.320]  They're promoting Antifa, attacking Congress and saying, kill more people.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.320]  Take more members of Congress.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:58.000]  If we just sit here and take it, I've got to say, I guess Trump's playing a double game.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.600]  And I guess he's going along with all this, Paul.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:02.920]  Or he's had one too many Diet Cokes.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.360]  What do you think?
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:12.320]  I think one of the problems, Alex, is people get ingratiated within this kind of MAGA cult
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.440]  based around DC, and they get to meet Trump a few times.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.440]  They get the photograph.
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.320]  They get to hang out at some of the events.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.800]  They get to go to the social media summit, out of which nothing happened.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:28.560]  And they're getting kind of this social scene, this MAGA cult, to the point where they refuse
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.880]  to hold Trump's feet to the fire on anything, because they don't want to be kicked out of
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:36.960]  their little social circle and have their little access revoked.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.960]  So it may not even be Trump's fault.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.160]  Maybe the people around him who are so, you know-
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.360]  A sycophantic network, a sycophantic network of fops.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.360]  Exactly.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:53.360]  I mean, the fact is, there's been no social media executive order.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.960]  More illegals were deported under Obama than Trump.
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:56.960]  The wall hasn't been built.
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.360]  And, yeah, that's because of massive opposition that he's faced, and we still support Trump.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:06.840]  But people need to be less cult-like, less obsequious towards him, questioning more,
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.640]  hold his feet to the fire more.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.520]  That can only be healthy for American freedom in the long run.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.800]  And the big issue, Alex, is the algorithm.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:18.720]  Whatever Epstein has said over and over, that algorithm changed by YouTube, by Google, will
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:22.760]  shift 12 million votes against Trump in the next election.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:27.320]  So to treat this social media big tech issue as something on the bottom of the pile is
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.320]  ridiculous.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.400]  It should be at the top of the agenda, but it doesn't seem like it is.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.560]  Well, Trump's going to lose in 2020 on this course.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:41.080]  I told people, even before Ann Coulter, that I thought Trump would be the nominee and win.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:47.240]  I could just smell it, I could see it, and the fact that he's bowing to the deep state
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:51.040]  and the technocracy, because of the architecture of this thing that, again, is 100 times bigger
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:56.280]  than the Manhattan Project, this is the whole-world government technocracy post-human system.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.280]  This is it.
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.920]  And you've got top scientists, as you said, explaining that they can steal the election
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:06.120]  like that, and they say they will, doesn't matter how many campaign stop Trumps does.
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:10.840]  If he doesn't get his ass in gear, we're all going to lose, and then they're going to have
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:12.560]  a purge against us, Paul.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.440]  How many people are already in jail over in the UK for their speech?
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.600]  I mean, this is real authoritarianism.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.520]  We're in the fight for our lives.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:25.800]  Thousands of people are arrested in the UK every year for essentially mean tweets.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.200]  But yeah, we need to hold this speech to the fire.
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.520]  There's been no social media executive order, and I think it is very much related to this
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:37.840]  bubble, where you have certain people around Trump, certain sycophantic big supporters
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:43.160]  of his, who know that they will be left alone, they will always be immune from the social
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:48.320]  media bans, so they don't want to dip their toe in the water for fear of getting bitten
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:53.240]  by the piranhas, so they stay completely silent about it, and this agenda never gets moved
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.240]  forward.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.520]  Meanwhile, the algorithms, which Google has pointed to, is literally going to steal millions
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.680]  of votes for him, and he's going to lose the election.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:04.840]  The only saving grace is the paucity of quality candidates on the Democratic side running against
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:05.840]  him.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.960]  He shouldn't be counting on that, Alex.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:15.280]  Well, I'll tell you this about Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.840]  If they think working with the Koch brothers and the establishment is going to get Trump
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:20.920]  reelected, they're fools.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:27.040]  It was Trump being a maverick, got him elected, and sure, they might have had some diplomatic
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.360]  victories or whatever.
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.000]  I don't care about all that.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.320]  I care about the fundamentals of our freedoms and America being an example, and this draconian's
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:40.000]  system of announcing, oh, all these smart devices are listening to you, they'll report
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.560]  if you might be violent, that just takes us beyond 1984, game over, checkmate, and it's
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.560]  from Trump.
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.960]  I mean, no one can put up with this crap, folks.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:56.160]  The left wants to be able to use the devices to track you and set you up, and so everyone
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:00.280]  must get the, and I asked the folks to bring you this this morning, and they forgot, because
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.480]  again, they've just decimated our attention spans.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:07.000]  I've got over there in my other office, I've got the satchels that are lead lined.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.560]  Everyone, if you have one of these damn phones, these digital minders, these spies, you've
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:14.640]  got to put them in those with your keys, your wallet, because people are stealing your wallet
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:19.360]  stuff anyway, scanning them, the RFID chips, everyone, all men, should start carrying.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.600]  We ought to come out with a design of a lead line when it goes on your side, so you use
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:26.080]  the phone when you want, when you're there, because even when the location's off, they
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.160]  are still tracking you, unless it's in a lead line case, and the RF can't get to it.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.120]  So there's a lot of things to mitigate this, even if we can't defeat it legislatively.
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.920]  Incredible job, Paul, and I've got a video coming out on this today, more articles at
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920]  infallwars.com.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.600]  It's good to be here with you, and I'm glad you're there fighting.
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:41.600]  Thank you so much, Paul.
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:42.600]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:43.600]  Incredible job.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.600]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:52.000]  But again, you need to put your phones inside lead line cases when you're not using them.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.760]  They are evil.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:16:22.440]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:52.280]  Thank you so much for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.

[01:30:54.440 --> 01:31:24.280]  Thanks for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:54.280]  Thanks for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:32:24.120]  Thanks for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:51.960]  Thanks for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:33:21.800]  Thanks for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.

[01:33:51.800 --> 01:34:21.640]  Thanks for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:51.480]  Thanks for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:35:04.440]  This is everything. This is where the $800 toilet seats and the $700 hammers in 1982
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:11.720]  billions of dollars of it went. This is where the trillions that have been siphoned off
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:29.080]  in the last 50-plus years since 1962, when the official main mission of DARPA, the Defense
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:39.320]  Department's Advanced Research Laboratories, that Eisenhower in 1961 warned everybody about.
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:44.280]  He says in the speech, not just beware of the military industrial complex, it's a 21-minute
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:51.640]  speech. Somebody swams the door and he looks like he's about to be shot, because it turns out he'd
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:58.760]  been briefed on this, that's been declassified. He said, beware the technological elite in control
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:07.640]  of all the major universities through Defense Department funding, creating a technological
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:15.480]  authoritarian elite in control of the military industrial complex. And then he went on to say,
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:20.760]  beware the military industrial complex. All you have to do is type in the text of Eisenhower's
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:26.440]  farewell address, or you can go to YouTube for now, probably pull down later, it's hateful,
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.440]  and you can watch the 21-minute speech on national television, black and white.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:37.480]  And he lays out, and he says 90% of our funding isn't in private researchers or private
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:42.040]  inventors like it always was. Now it's under government control, and we have a technological
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:47.320]  elite that is very, very dangerous, and has some really, really dangerous plans. You need to beware
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:55.240]  what they're doing. That's Eisenhower, the hero of World War II. Do control F technological elite,
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:37:00.600]  or control F elite, and you will pull up where he says it in the transcript from history.com.
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:07.800]  Now, just type in control F, and then the word elite, and that's a search term,
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:11.320]  it'll give it to you. Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:17.400]  moving on from there. Document cam shot, please. We're going to move only to that now,
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:26.120]  or I'm going to get distracted. What we're about to cover here is the plan for you and your family.
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:30.920]  Now, I came and knocked on your door, and I said, I've got a plan for, say, your wife.
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.640]  And you go, well, who are you? Well, I'm not going to tell you who I am,
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:39.880]  but I've got a plan for your wife. Well, how do you know my wife? Well, I'm not going to tell you.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:44.920]  But I've been watching and listening to you for years, and let's just say I know all your secrets.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:49.400]  Well, if you're a red-blooded American, or a red-blooded human, you'd grab the guy around the
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:56.280]  neck and say, listen, I don't know who you are, but get off my property. And he says, no, I know
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:02.360]  what you had for breakfast this morning, and I know you took a dump at 7 a.m. I've got it recorded
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:10.280]  right here, it's what's playing it to you. Now, there's Eisenhower. He said, we will become
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:20.200]  captive of a scientific technological elite. Worse than I told you, captive, captive, the
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:31.480]  president of the United States of America, one hero. Now, Eisenhower is looking at the people
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:37.000]  around the room like they're a bunch of traders. He just said no to attacking U.S. military bases,
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:42.680]  movie theaters, and shopping malls to blame the Russians and start World War III a month before.
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:47.240]  Then he went into the agencies and found out what they were up to, and found out they had
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:56.440]  plans to put people in tanks and put wires in their heads by 2025. And Eisenhower said,
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:03.240]  you're shutting all this down. That's come out. I just showed you him saying scientific technological
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:12.360]  elite holding America and the world captive. Now, why did Dwight D. Eisenhower get so freaked out?
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:15.400]  And he killed these programs. They didn't stop.
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:23.720]  Because, you know, he liked his grandkids. He liked playing golf. What's wrong with humanity?
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:31.240]  But if you can conquer humanity, and if you can take the family out of the equation and take
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:36.920]  decisions to take language and turn us into basically robots with wires in our heads,
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:45.240]  living in deprivation tanks, it's not the matrix, folks. This is from government documents, then
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:53.400]  you win. And next year, the brain chip implants will be at your local mall.
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:58.680]  Should I play the newscast again? It's 2020, folks. They're behind schedule, but not much. And I'm
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:06.760]  going to show you all that now because he had looked at the MIT program and the Stanford Research
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:13.480]  Institute, one on the east coast, one on the west coast, running this entire program with
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:20.040]  computers already linked up in batch processing so they could put hundreds of thousands of
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:29.560]  research scientists on jobs to develop and share breakthroughs quicker for a human machine interface.
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:39.000]  A symbiosis and a merger. Now, I'm going to read this to you from DARPA.gov.
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:46.840]  Are you ready? Start your engines. Because you see Trump proposing DARPA
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:52.760]  and these groups with big tech to watch you and track you and not let you own guns. If you
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:57.240]  seem upset or they heard you say something in your house, here's Amazon admits listening to
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:05.800]  Alexa Conversations, Wyatt Matters, Forbes. All the stuff I told you decades ago, Apple series,
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:11.640]  he's dropping your conversations, records you having sex, documents what porn you want,
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:16.280]  what kind of food your dog eats, series recording everything you say,
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:22.440]  Apple series, he only records you having sex. Google is absolutely listening to your conversations
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:27.000]  and it confirms that people don't trust big tech. See Alex Jones first broke all this,
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:34.520]  he has to be all fair. Amazon Alexa can capturing audio people having sex, sexual assaults, listening
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:42.600]  users having sex, Daily Mail. So let's start getting into it. Then you have, oh the big
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:47.080]  tech investor comes out all the news this week, Google and Amazon use smart speakers for surveillance,
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:53.480]  top tech investor says and says the public should be told and it should be reversed. John Rothwig.
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:59.240]  Now let's talk about why they're doing this and then show you the plan from 62 that already
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:04.600]  been set up. This little exhibit, you can write off the State Department today, they'll send you
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:10.280]  the brochure but here it is blown up color for you. The United States program for complete,
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:18.520]  for general and complete disarmament in a peaceful world. The general means all over and the complete
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:23.720]  which means total disarmament in a peaceful world. You read this, first the general public will be
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:31.800]  disarmed, the militaries will be disarmed except for a global peacekeeper force. And everyone will
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:36.200]  be put back to an agrarian level except for the elite in the compact cities and the police will
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:40.360]  even be disarmed. We'll tell you about course really that only the UN has the weapons but
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:46.280]  they go further in this they say we've got to end humanity as we know it to stop war.
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.800]  We've got to put wires in people's heads and put them in tanks. I'm going to show you that
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:57.560]  from DARPA when we come back. Stay with us. In Info Wars Live we always try to bring you
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:02.520]  game changing products. Now we've already been promoting and selling super silver wound gel
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:09.160]  for over a year. It's a best seller. It is the best you can get a 100% review rate on power reviews.
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:14.600]  Well now we teamed up with them and came out with two different types of skin cream. One is
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:20.440]  naturally sent in with grapefruit essential oils. The other is unscented. It's got hyaluronic acid,
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:28.200]  vitamin E essential oils from grapefruit. It's got coconut oil and so much more and this patented

[01:44:54.040 --> 01:45:02.200]  It's been a year since info wars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:06.520]  We had over five billion views when we got banned and we're credited with getting Donald Trump
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:11.560]  elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots. Now as we enter the 2020
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:16.760]  election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:23.960]  to block the signal and it's now here. Band.video. Band.video is the answer for libertarians,

[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:44.360]  So
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:51.160]  Trump is like a Hitler crab that grew out of the shell and found somebody else's shell.
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:48:00.040]  Some other dead animals skeleton. He climbed into it and I don't blame him. I don't think
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:05.560]  he has it out for America. He's not anti-human. But the technocracies running rings around him.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:11.320]  He's letting them steal 2020 from the American people. He's letting them sense the living
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:15.800]  hell out of us and I don't see any good coming out of Jared and Ivanka when they keep meeting
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:22.680]  with Tim Cook. Just Trump saying, hey, Tim Cook's great guy. Tim Cook's got some great ideas. I guess
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:30.440]  we don't need to put sanctions on the Chinese and iPhones. And then, oh, we're going to use DARPA
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:37.000]  that created the Internet for a reason we're about to show you. Have psychiatrists working
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:42.200]  with Big Tech to record everything, including your audio and video in your house,
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:49.000]  over all the smart so-called features to create a psychological profile on you and take your guns.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.240]  That's in the Washington Post today. Notice Trump hasn't tweeted and said it's wrong
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.600]  because I went and spent hours this morning looking it up. Ivanka's a shot her mouth off.
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:01.800]  Trump's a good buddy. He's the one pushing it. The front group, oh, it came from the grassroots.
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:08.280]  My wife died of pancreatic cancer. So you've got to let me listen to you over all the assistance
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:14.360]  in your house and take your guns or you're against my wife. So let's get into it right now.
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:20.920]  And then this next hour, California, San Francisco declares NRA Domestic Terrorist
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:26.280]  Organization, kellymcbrainandfullwars.com. Now, we can't declare anti-terrorist group,
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:33.240]  but we can declare the NRA one. Let's continue. So here is the United States program for general
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:38.840]  and complete disarmament, the peaceful world, public law, State Department document 7277.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:46.040]  You might want to go read this. And it's a plan to take everybody's guns and get rid of masculinity
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:54.040]  because that's what causes war. This is a post-human world, just like NBC News called us last week.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:59.160]  Cyborgs will replace humans, remake the world. It'll save the earth and that humans will
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:07.160]  disappear within our own lifetimes entirely. So they're telling you. Sounds radical when I say it
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:11.560]  myself and I just show you them saying it and teaching you to hate yourself and that articles
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:16.360]  here, you know, Swedish government professors want to say we've got to eat humans and be cannibals
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:20.360]  to save the earth, eat bugs. Swedish behavioral scientists suggest eating humans to save the
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:29.480]  planet. That's all coming up. Washington State legalizes using humans for compost. Next is the
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:34.600]  law. You've got to be composted. It's all about dehumanizing. But I digress. Let's continue.
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:40.120]  So this is the plan in the 50s given to the technocrats to create a docile, dumb-down system.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:44.040]  Well, first off, break up the family. Don't have women care about children. Don't have women have
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:49.160]  children. Have men not care. Have them have arrested development. Never be men. That's the plan.
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:56.360]  Now, let's get into what they developed and what was adopted. Just like two scientists won in 1992,
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:01.800]  a Nobel science prize for a plan to spray aluminum dioxide, barium salts in the upper
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:06.600]  atmosphere to, quote, protect from global warming. It was adopted to global policy two years later.
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:10.360]  And that's all declassified now that indeed they're adding it to the jet fuel. It's being aerosolized
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:15.560]  to create nuclei. And they've had C-span symposiums with the CIA admitting it. But I'm still the
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:19.800]  cook for telling you. Just like fluoride lowers your IQ and gives you cancer. But it doesn't
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:23.800]  matter. I'm still the bad guy. Just like Epstein has an island and cloning facilities and
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:28.360]  child breeding facilities. I mean, I told you he was heading up the institute for the Rockefellers
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:33.160]  that does that. Of course he does that. How does you know that? That's what those people do.
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:43.080]  They create genetic clones so they can harvest them later. And the people never even know who
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:47.000]  they are growing up in the regular life. Then people come by, put them in a van and take them away.
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:51.880]  Then the Rockefeller had seven heart transplants. Word is two of them were from clones.
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:57.960]  You're not in kids sitting more boys and girls. Okay, let's go. Oh, I'm putting out some
[01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:05.320]  classified info right there. So let's continue. MIT and the galactic network. This is from
[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:14.200]  encyclopedia.com. And it says the concept of the galactic network was created by JCR
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:19.240]  lick litter, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research and Professor.
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:22.920]  Lick letters vision of the galactic network, a network of computers that allows users to gather
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:27.240]  data and access programs anywhere in the world was detailed in a series of memos. The first man
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:35.000]  computer symbiosis, that means merger was written in 1960 and detailed lick letters thoughts on
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:41.240]  the development of the interaction between humans and computers. I've read the paper is to control
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:47.400]  and track the population emerges with machines. The second memo online man online. You heard
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:51.960]  these terms before he made them online man computer communication was published two years later and
[01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:56.600]  took the galactic network idea further from the concept of social interaction to the networking
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:03.480]  of computers. And 68 lick letter co-authored the computers as a communication device with
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:10.040]  research Robert Taylor goes on. And he goes on to break down how in 62 he became the head of ARPA
[01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:16.600]  information processing to put this into function already had it hooked up to universities all
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:22.440]  over the country. And it just goes through all of it information flow through large communication
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:30.680]  nets. The TX MIT computer and the Q32 computer linked up again between Stanford and MIT like I
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:35.400]  told you earlier. And it's all right here. The Federation of scientists in 2000 classified
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:39.720]  document off his research where one model was again we would live in tanks. This is in my book
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:44.040]  the scent of tyranny. They reclassified it later. That's to fill the documents out there where you
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:48.040]  would be born into a tank and have wires in you and your heat would power the machine. There'll
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:52.360]  be no more war because you live in a virtual reality. I'm not kidding. See again none of this
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:58.440]  none of this is fiction. They're theorizing it. His fourth side he predicted millions of people
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:04.040]  be using galactic network by 2000 and research efforts by MIT education institutions paved the
[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:08.360]  way for the development of the ARPA net and eventually the internet. And then it goes on
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:15.000]  top of the intergalactic network and social media. And yet what did Eisenhower call the real plan?
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:23.480]  He called it that we will become captives of the scientific elite. There's no intergalactic
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:27.400]  network Wikipedia. Go read about yourself. So that's where all this comes from and it would
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:33.240]  be psychiatrists and technocrats over it and then they would track you with these handheld computers
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:40.200]  that were either wireless or interfaced with terminals and they even had PBS shows on this
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:44.600]  of the 80s promoting it at that time and then it would track everything you were doing and track
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:50.600]  how the stimulus and propaganda on the national news was affecting you to be able to dial it back
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:56.280]  or dial it forward and manipulate. Then of course they set up the whole NSA system that was already
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:03.400]  in place to keyword create transcripts that were searchable by the 70s and 80s. Then they got the
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:09.400]  miniaturization of data by the 90s able to record everything and then they needed to get people to
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:14.200]  accept it. So they came out with social media where you opt in to be watched, listened to,
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:21.160]  tracked and manipulated with systems that addict you and control you and that's all over the news
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:26.600]  that social media admits their main mission is to make you as addicted to their systems
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:31.320]  and to not be interfaced with your fellow humans and friends and then to isolate you
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:36.760]  towards absorption into the larger system once you get so depressed they'll then offer you
[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:41.160]  the brain chip or the interface that musk is pushing so that you will be enlightened and then
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:45.720]  transcend to the super cyborg level which is really a digital grave. You'll lose your body,
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:50.200]  you'll physically die but then it'll it'll be your perfect voice, perfect avatars. People won't
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:53.880]  know that it's an AI that's taken on your likeness in a giant con game you'll be dead.
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:56:00.520]  I'll continue and it goes on to all of this remember then 2002 total information awareness
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:06.440]  network that said everything you do will be tracked every word you say recorded will be put
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:11.080]  into a giant digital system at DARPA used to control and track your entire life and if you
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:14.840]  don't behave yourself all these systems will be turned off and you will not be able to buy or
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:21.080]  sell as social control. I wonder where the Chinese got the idea the global's built it for them. Again
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:24.120]  information awareness office you need to go research all of this and then they got everybody
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:28.920]  to opt in because it was illegal for the NSA to publicly do all of this.
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:37.960]  So meanwhile the very same big pharma that's involved in all this announcement that Trump's
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:43.880]  pushing and Ivanka Trump's pushing makes you more depressed makes you commit suicide pushes
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:48.920]  deadly drugs on you that make you commit suicide make you kill people and then there's more depression
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:53.320]  more cancer more suicide and as that happens it's the more of the excuse oh we better listen
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:57.160]  and watch everyone because they're all committing suicide and becoming depressed because the
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:02.360]  electromagnetic radiation the programming the isolation not being out in nature all of it makes
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:07.400]  you like an elephant that wants to commit suicide in the zoo waddling back and forth and bang its
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:13.400]  head into the bars trying to kill itself they know how to put a mammal into this position
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:18.440]  and they're putting you your children your family into a suicidal position we'll come back and hit
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:22.760]  more of this on the other side please don't forget without your funding we're destroyed look at what

[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:31.560]  so
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:36.840]  ad from eisenhower speech in 1961 is farewell address where he said they're setting up a
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:43.960]  computerized technological elite that we're going to be captives of that's a close quote that's a
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:50.840]  quote and so you have to understand i'm not making this up hey guys can i have that nra story
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:55.720]  i i had it i lost it in my stack i need it for the start of the next segment pretty please
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:04.360]  sugar on top everything else uh because what's happening is there is a move to criminalize
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:10.280]  gun ownership and the idea of buying bullets uh shooting sports that's why walmart's not selling
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:15.800]  handgun ammo dick sporting goods uh is being a real you know what and saying we're going to stop
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:21.880]  selling everything this is all being announced to create the idea and and the social pressure that
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:26.920]  it's time to ban the gun so i'm going to cover that next segment uh because there it is right
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:31.480]  there in front of me i am just so flustered right now because if you go to drugsreport.com
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:39.240]  there's that top link that everybody should share right now that trump is his administration is
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:45.800]  is is looking at proposing all the surveillance grid all the devices listening to you all the
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:51.880]  systems that are controlling what we do openly violating our fourth amendment new process being
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:57.960]  run by darpa and the democrats and big tech so instead of defending us from big tech
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:06.920]  instead of standing up to all of this we're talking about totally and completely screwing us over
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:14.760]  and so i didn't say that for shock effect when i said that if president trump comes out and
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:20.680]  proposes beyond because because how are they going to do it with saying your neighbors didn't say
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:24.600]  you threatened to kill somebody you never guns taken for that but you just seem upset or you
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:31.640]  don't like hillary or whatever so we took your guns and that's what different congressmen are
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:38.040]  proposing democrats and republicans and so trump says oh well as long as it's computers in your
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:44.440]  apple watch or your ipad or your alexa or your digital assistant that's just beyond outrageous
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:49.560]  on so many fronts the end of the process the end of the fourth amendment the end of fifth
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:53.880]  amendment the end of the fact that we let this in our houses and it's doing it to us
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:03:04.760]  so tomorrow undoubtedly i'm gonna open the phones up so that we can specifically
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:11.560]  sit there and take calls on this issue because this is the big issue and we should be having
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:18.520]  a debate about it and thank god this audience cares thank god people like tucker carlson care
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:24.520]  but the censorship we've seen has been so unamerican and the lying to congress and then to
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:29.320]  know that the key committees are involved the democratic party particularly i documented
[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:35.640]  this extensively yesterday commanding and running the censorship and trump sitting there accepting
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:41.880]  it the 5g that they admit wired magazine big studies la times yeah increases cancer massively
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:50.600]  so what let's put it on top of school after all it's the post human era humanity it's all over
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:55.880]  because we got it so easy people just go i don't care about i don't care if humanity's over until
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:02.120]  you're actually starving to death for the collapse of civilization
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:07.320]  when you look at paul watch this article we're going to cover when we come back because it
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:12.520]  illustrates so much so reprint it for me or pull it out of your state stack
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:18.600]  the article on dave chappelle the critics hate dave chappelle gave him a zero rating on rotten
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:25.000]  tomatoes for being politically incorrect but then he got a 99 percent on the votes on rotten tomatoes
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.320]  but that was only at the protest because they removed the right for people to even vote
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:36.600]  again just like youtube and facebook is announcing they're gonna get rid of the like
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:41.320]  functions they don't even have that power to show what you like they want to steal all your
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:49.000]  humanity all of your human communication they want robots a bunch of dirty nasty evil big tech fake
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:05:01.960]  leftist band dot video is the answer to censorship band dot video is the answer for libertarians
[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:09.320]  conservatives nationalists pro-gun pro-life pro-human individuals to have their own platform
[02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:14.920]  where videos banned by youtube facebook and twitter are still available we've launched it ladies and
[02:05:14.920 --> 02:05:22.840]  gentlemen it's now live band dot video band dot video isn't just going to be a home for alex jones
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:28.040]  or david nighter oh and shroyer or paul watson banned videos we are building it to be a place where
[02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:33.800]  banned memes are able to be posted and we're a growing list of freedom loving contributors
[02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:39.880]  are able to have a home free for being shut down free from being censored free from being silenced
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:47.000]  by big tech the chai comms the hollywood scum and the globlest freedom of speech has a home it's called
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:06:00.040]  banned dot video america and the world is fighting back against tyranny at banned dot video
[02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:08.760]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:26.360]  front lines of the info war ladies and gentlemen for the last two hours we have been breaking down
[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:34.360]  the technocracy and let's put the definition of technocracy for folks it is a ruling oligarchy
[02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:40.440]  that uses technology and surveillance systems to control economies and control populations
[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:48.600]  it is scientific tyranny in its own definitions there was a 1920s and 30s idea by the communist of
[02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:54.200]  a technocracy creating utopia but its modern parlance is total control a government or
[02:06:54.200 --> 02:07:00.280]  social system controlled by technicians especially scientists and technical experts government by
[02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:06.840]  technical specialists a system of governance where people who are skilled or efficient govern in
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:12.040]  their respective areas of expertise a type of meritocracy based on people's ability now that's
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:17.560]  the propaganda version what does the e you call themselves they call themselves a technocracy they
[02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:21.320]  say oh we don't need prime ministers or presidents we don't need elections we have technocrats that
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:26.840]  know best what is bloomberg type this in bloomberg the technocrat in chief bloomberg reported
[02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:31.880]  it he knows what you should eat he knows where you should live he knows what you should do he
[02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:37.240]  is going to run your life and it's his religion to do so well part of this is Dave Chappelle his
[02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:44.200]  comedy special came out and i've seen Dave Chappelle on tv for ever since he got popular 15
[02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:48.840]  years ago great comedian very funny on his developed comedy i went and saw him in austin
[02:07:49.640 --> 02:07:55.400]  and he was testing on comedy a couple years ago it was horrible it was it was almost unwatchable
[02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:59.880]  and and that's why he was saying don't film don't film they kept yelling and everyone for like
[02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:03.080]  an hour before it don't film when he comes out i got up halfway through it and left
[02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:10.520]  that said whether you love Dave Chappelle or hate him he's got a right to his speech so
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:17.320]  he gets up there and decries political correctness and how comedy is being destroyed by it he talks
[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:26.600]  about jesse small it you name it and so rotten tomatoes gives him a zero now this went on for
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:31.880]  two days paul watson tweeted about it we'll show paul's article up on screen for folks please and
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:37.000]  we'll scroll down and i'm gonna show the twitter for folks thank you let's scroll down and they
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:43.960]  weren't allowing people there it is at first to do the normal voting you have the critics who are
[02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:48.120]  the enlightened priesthood the gods who follow their corporate orders and get paid off to do it
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:54.680]  that's now that admitted big scandals over at rotten tomatoes other places and you have the
[02:08:54.680 --> 02:09:02.040]  unwashed masses now for the first two days it was at zero and paul wrote about this it shows
[02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:06.360]  evidence of it then once it became evident that they'd remove the popcorn meaning you know the
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:13.400]  general watchers they voted 99 percent loving the comedy special from netflix so it went up a little
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:20.360]  bit so some peer pressure so 70 percent of the critics after that said that and again what paul
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:25.960]  screen shot it was once they wiped the slate clean and then relaunched a poll that had the
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:32.520]  ability for the public to vote now again just yesterday facebook announced they're looking
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:38.680]  to remove the like buttons youtube's testing it and i keep harping on this the fundamentalness
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:44.200]  of you have a facebook page you say i took a vaccine got really sick or my daughter took
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:48.840]  it and had a convulsion or my son took it never talked again that's your right to say that and
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:53.240]  all the evidence is there it's the right of two fox sports guys to say we took the flu shot and
[02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:58.920]  almost died both of us their media matters are trying to get them fired how dare you dirty american
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:06.520]  say you took something and got sick shut your filthy mouth slave because this is the real slavery
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:11.560]  folks but what damn color you are this is outrageous so if you can't even like something
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:17.080]  and most of the big newspapers you notice have gotten rid of the comment sections
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:21.640]  you go into the huffington post and all these places that have these hit piece
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:25.880]  articles about me all the time 90 percent of the comments all love info wars now
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:33.080]  it needs to be like that folks it's be 50 50 people don't buy it they see through it so all
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:36.760]  the king's horses all the king's men they can't put it back together again here's a little 30
[02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:42.760]  second piece where dave chappelle this needs to go viral is talking about how we're watching you
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:47.000]  we're controlling you we're bullies you better do what the left says or will ruin your life
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:52.120]  from just clips this week of them saying that exact talking point and for him calling it out and
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:57.880]  having the basic courage to say you guys are bullies they want his show pulled from netflix
[02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:03.400]  and her boycotting his comedy shows calling it white supremacist here it is what we should be
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:09.880]  doing is shunning these people shunning shaming these people is a statement of moral indignation
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:15.080]  that these people are not fit for polite society i'm going to try to take everything away from you
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:20.840]  and i don't care what i find out could be today tomorrow 15 20 years from now if i find out you're
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:26.120]  fucking finished they don't get to escape accountability that's all of our job to hold
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:32.840]  them accountable for the rest of their lives i'm so entertaining so exactly what dave chappelle
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:36.520]  saying so we're telling the truth he's in trouble now here's four minutes of him talking about jessie
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:41.400]  smollett who's up on info wars dot com his lawyers say okay he lied but it's the cop's fault for
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:48.680]  believing him here it is just afraid of being attacked happens the best don't ever forget what
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:57.320]  happened to that french actor you know i'm talking about juicy smollett is a very french very famous
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:18.120]  french actor you never heard of juicy smollett juicy smollett is an actor from france
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:26.840]  and he became famous on a show called empire
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:36.920]  one night he was in chicago late at night and was the victim
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:53.480]  he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack you see juicy smollett is
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:59.160]  gay and he is black not just french
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:11.880]  oh it's a crazy story apparently when he was walking down the street late at night two white
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:19.320]  men came out of the shadows uh with maggots on and beat him up tied a rope around his neck
[02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:24.760]  called him all kinds of n**** and put some bleach on him and ran off into the night
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:34.120]  the s*** was like international news and everybody was furious especially in hollywood
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:38.280]  it's all over everybody's twitter feed and instagram page justice for juicy and all this
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:48.040]  the whole country was up in arms was talking about it all the time on the news and and for some
[02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:58.280]  reason uh african-americans we were like oddly quiet we were so quiet about
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:05.320]  that the gay community started accusing african-american community of being homophobic for not
[02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:11.960]  supporting him what they didn't understand is that we were supporting him with our silence
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:19.480]  because we understood that this s*** was clearly lying
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:34.120]  none of these details added up at all he said he's walking down the street in
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:42.360]  chicago and uh white dudes come up to him and say hey man aren't you that s*** from empire
[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:49.400]  does that sound like how white people talk i know white people they don't talk like that
[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:54.200]  are you that s*** from empire they would never say that it sounds like something
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:15:05.000]  that i would say
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:13.000]  if you're racist and homophobic you're not even gonna know who this s*** is you can't watch empire
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:20.520]  white people never feel sorry for the police but this time we even felt sorry for the police

[02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:43.560]  it's like davis chappelle saying people always go well the guy with hitler dog it was a joke he
[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:48.360]  shouldn't be arrested in the uk it doesn't matter if it's a joke or not you have a right to say you
[02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:54.840]  hate nazis he has a right to be one he's not a nazi carpe doctor was pretty liberal it's a joke
[02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:59.480]  when his wife came home he made the dog howl hitler and it pissed her off he's a liberal
[02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:04.520]  you ever heard of pissing people off called practical jokes and some of the funniest stuff out there
[02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:12.440]  i do it all the time at home doesn't matter though the point is is that you have a right to be

[02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:20.200]  please have a t-shirt that was the best seller we even still sell that side issue
[02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:26.760]  let's get back to davis chappelle knocking it out of the park because the day i heard it
[02:21:27.880 --> 02:21:31.960]  happened like a saturday night i went on there and i said i think this is a false flag sue me if
[02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:37.960]  you want to i have a right to say it let me tell you there aren't two white dudes at 2 15 in the morning
[02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:45.480]  going up to beat up a black dude i mean that's when it's 15 below zero like davis pelts saying
[02:21:45.480 --> 02:21:50.520]  and then he's got a noose around his neck and a scratch on his face when the cops show up
[02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:58.280]  i mean give me a break man that's obviously not true but they tried to sell the whole thing just
[02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:02.600]  like the cobbitton kids just like all of it so let's go ahead and finish up with chappelle here it is
[02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:07.720]  black people never feel sorry for the police but this time we even felt sorry for the police
[02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:13.400]  can you imagine if you was a police veteran taking this kid's police report okay mr smollier please
[02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:21.080]  tell me what happened all right you're 2am you left the house 2am it's minus 16 degrees

[02:23:37.240 --> 02:23:41.320]  people that make stuff up take away from the real stuff that goes on
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:51.320]  incredible new article is up on info wars dot com his lawyers i'm not kidding jamie white article
[02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:58.280]  jessie smollett lawyers even if he did lie police to blame for taking him seriously well by law
[02:23:59.240 --> 02:24:03.960]  they have to take the police report jessie smollett's attorneys claim that even if the
[02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:10.040]  empire actor did lie about his alleged racial attack the chicago police are actually to blame
[02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:14.520]  for investigating the claim so vigorously let me tell you why he got protected you had a bunch of
[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:18.920]  top obama people and clinton people involved in the show the show is made i think the last time
[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:23.880]  i checked something like 500 million dollars they run a bunch of seasons but it was going under
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:30.760]  the ratings were down by like half look it up and a story like this would get it massive coverage
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:37.160]  and he was a big victim and it did boost ratings and so when it came out later that smollett wanted
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:40.760]  to paycheck people said oh that's not three wanted to create a race war no he wanted to paycheck
[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:51.400]  because in america if you can play the victim then you get put all over the media and everybody
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:58.360]  has to then tune into what you're doing it's called a publicity stunt and people do it all the time
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:02.680]  you know growing up talk radio folks that listen to would get in trouble and fire and stuff because
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:07.080]  they do things like call in and have people say oh bob just died you know in a car wreck
[02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:13.400]  were real sad on april fools day that was one of the last straws they were trying to set me up
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:18.120]  so they could fire me another number one talk show in austin they wanted me to say that i'd
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:25.000]  been killed for the talk and i said no and um they fired me like a week later but they wanted
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:30.360]  to set me up so that i could so that i so so they could say i'd stage the hoax and then they could
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:35.560]  fire me see how that works so it's just absolutely incredible now shifting gears is something really
[02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:43.160]  important here california san francisco declare nra domestic terror organization the blue state says
[02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:48.120]  the group incites gun owners to commit acts of violence and they're now going to file lawsuits
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:53.320]  try to take criminal action san francisco's district two superior kathryn stefany who wrote
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:57.640]  the declaration said the national rob associations press propaganda and misinforms and aims to deceive
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:01.720]  the public about the dangers of gun violence that's the same way they sued remington the same law firm
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:06.680]  that works for hillary suing me with senator blumenthal in canada kid uh it's saying the same
[02:26:06.680 --> 02:26:12.760]  stuff the nr a exists to spread this information and only puts guns in the hands of those who
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:20.200]  would harm and terrorize us they don't want to call for it to be shut down meanwhile san francisco
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:24.040]  works with the real terrorist anti for the criminal these crimes meanwhile walmart plans to
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:31.640]  drastically step back for ammunition cells banning all handgun ammo and again dicks sporting goods
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:36.920]  is being real you know what's all their name says it all they are uh saying that they may ban all
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:41.240]  guns and all ammo cells already stopped selling semi-auto they're creating the perception it's
[02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:46.200]  illegal for years facebook won't take gun ads now they're going up people's bank accounts the nr a
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:50.360]  i have to know has to go out of a credit card processing group in houston paying a higher
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:56.360]  percentage you know they have perfect credit so do i now when they took all of our banking away
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:27:02.760]  for no reason i had perfect corporate score that's the best you can get like a double double plus
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:07.960]  but they put a hate designation on the g2 and boston on me last year and took all our bank
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:13.800]  accounts away bank accounts i'd had for 20 years with perfect records that's the persecution
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:18.280]  that's the real discrimination against gun owners and nationalists and others and trump
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:24.040]  is sitting there letting it all happen and now he has avanca his daughter with google and rest of
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:28.600]  him wanting a social score with the devices in your house listening to you to report it back
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:34.200]  to darpa and take your guns if your heart rate's too high or you sound angry in some fake algorithm
[02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:41.560]  forget judges and juries we got big tech hooked in with the nsa it is the nsa and trump won't get
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:47.880]  control of it he's screwing the pooch i think i'm gonna get on a plane next week go bullhorn the
[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:54.440]  white house maybe marlago because let me tell you something yeah trumps a lot better than hillary but
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:59.800]  it's like does somebody put 10 bullets in your head or five bullets in your head if trump won't act on
[02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:05.960]  this we're screwed now here's the deal the washington post lies a lot and they say trumps
[02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:11.720]  favorable and wants this they do that a lot to lie problem is i looked into evanca and trumps one
[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:16.520]  trumps best friends that's heading this up and i found where they were talking 2017 about it
[02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:21.720]  and evanca was promoting it then so death and look i don't want to go after trumps little girl
[02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:26.360]  but you know what my family in this country and your family comes first and i'm not selling out
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:30.840]  to crap so i'm gonna tell president trump this you want me to move and try to get an impeachment
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:34.760]  going want the america people to turn against you you keep pushing these red flag laws and you try to
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:38.760]  make it digital with big tech doing it instead of defending us from big tech and defending yourself
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:47.480]  then you deserve to lose trump you deserve it we're gonna find out aren't we well they're right

[02:34:44.200 --> 02:34:50.280]  give up the url again in a moment but the media ran these headlines x nfl star larry johnson
[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:56.200]  sounds awful supposed a feminine agenda in two sports leagues and then there's a bunch of other
[02:34:56.200 --> 02:35:00.600]  ones well here's the articles the national football league launches nfl pride with roger gadel
[02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:08.600]  and league staff nfl mlb to join nyc pride march for the first time nfl launches lgbt initiative
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:14.200]  nfl pride and i talked to people in hollywood who's the famous actor i forget his name i've
[02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:19.640]  met him he's an idiocracy talked about how it's like the gay mafia like men would grab his genitals
[02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:23.480]  and and and you know and and how that's something that goes on in los angeles i haven't been in
[02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:28.120]  many movies that happened to me a couple times i said i'm about to beat your ass what is this
[02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:30.520]  oh don't worry about it these producers and people
[02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:37.960]  you know put it on screen your mic's distorted yeah terry cruz that's terry cruz that's a
[02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:42.200]  he plays the president of theocracy a lot of stuff and you know he was all you'll be be a man suck
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:47.240]  it up take it well what happens to women it's a bad thing but why is it when there's this whole
[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:51.880]  quote gay agenda by the left we're supposed to put up with it and again i don't hate anybody
[02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:56.120]  genuinely but i do see the agenda where you're not supposed to question it and so they acted
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:00.840]  like larry a johnson was crazy put out a few tweets about this so i thought we would have him
[02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:05.640]  here's actually hear what he had to say thanks for coming on with us thanks for having me on
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:10.440]  we'll start at the beginning why you're concerned what you've seen with the nfl why you're speaking
[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:16.200]  out i'm speaking out because this the the league has changed drastically it's become
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:23.320]  overpassingly and we want to expect that they're doing this to save wear and tear of athletes but
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:28.360]  as you've seen in previous years they spent millions and millions of dollars to keep cte away
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:31.880]  from away from international football league football so it can't be because they care for the
[02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:38.600]  players and i think if you look at the commercials now on the exception of some guys like um uh jj
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:44.200]  why he is the man's man of the nfl there is no commercial that you will ever show or see him
[02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:50.040]  doing anything effeminate now when you got cam newton and you see the the flame boy away he dresses
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:55.720]  yeah yeah it may not he may not be gay but he's using his head of sexually to kind of real real
[02:36:55.720 --> 02:37:01.000]  aim guys to make it say all effeminate culture is cool there we can all we can all gravitate to it
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:06.120]  he had a commercial with him getting a hot tub uh a cold tub with a guy you have a racco with a
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:11.080]  tendency titan so i think he just recently retired he has a pink him and his team has pink aprons
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:16.760]  they want to make it pink cupcakes now this is only happening to the african-american players
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:20.600]  it's not happening to the white players you'll never see tom brady selling cupcakes you'll never
[02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:26.440]  see tom brady go to the mat gala like odell beckham did and a skirt and then when asked you know
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:32.280]  what was the sexuality he gave a uh you know it's it's it's up in the air type of answer and they're
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:38.520]  always promoting this to keep so that's why when you get to gelette ad which they signed a fire
[02:37:38.520 --> 02:37:43.800]  or that extension with the nfl that home won't add the eight million dollars that they lost they
[02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:47.960]  didn't even care about it because they see the bigger picture of it's going to happen with all
[02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:53.560]  us if they make money or not and that's why you saw a black man doing a trans ad and not a white one
[02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:59.400]  is because they because we are the culture right now that's in the uh that's in the in the sports
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:04.280]  sporting events right now so we have to convince each other that this is okay we always have to
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:10.200]  promote sex and now if you promote sex and it's okay you're basically showing children that you
[02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:15.240]  could do whatever be whatever you want and it's not necessarily about the game anymore so the
[02:38:15.240 --> 02:38:20.040]  media spun it that you're being anti-quote gay but but really what you're saying is there's a whole
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:25.880]  agenda to feminize men and to say that manly men are somehow dirty and bad and these gelette ads
[02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:31.880]  a man says man that's a good looking girl and goes to talk to her and that's basically rape
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:37.160]  and of course like you said they lost eight million dollars but it's such a weird mission such a cult
[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:43.000]  they said we don't care we're going to do it anyways i mean this is crazy i mean like i said it's
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:47.160]  always my emasculating emails it's not even not it's not just in sports and football it's in the
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:51.560]  movies it's in children's movies i watch movies like the lego movie with my daughter and they're
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:56.680]  set out to emasculate strong male characters and say well the woman can do it better or the woman
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:39:02.200]  can do it softer look at the Incredibles they basically in the hood poor Robert partly emasculated
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:06.280]  him so he stayed at home in the moment i'll do the job which i have no problem with that but
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:11.400]  did you do it at the end of the movie gamer gate was in order to only have women uh in positions
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:16.200]  of leadership it's in the pentagon now it's a thing to make men obsolete and the left says
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:22.680]  everywhere men are obsolete it's an attack on men like i said this is an agenda they keep going
[02:39:22.680 --> 02:39:26.680]  and where it's a better way to get the agenda pushed through is that keep brainwashing with it
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:32.680]  keep showing you examples of it of men who are as manly man like as it used to be show them cooking
[02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:37.480]  show them cleaning uh men do this every day but they're doing it at nausea they do it at four
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:43.560]  point to to welcome in sooner or later we're gonna be watching ESPN draft and you go see two men make
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:47.960]  out and we want to be like oh that's what it is there's nothing wrong with that if if you think
[02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:53.400]  something wrong with that but that's what but their course is feeding it everywhere and everywhere
[02:39:53.400 --> 02:39:57.640]  it's it's everywhere and my kids can have a chance to make up their minds but you're not making up
[02:39:57.640 --> 02:40:04.280]  their minds if you show them every time there's on tv an example of what it is well i gotta say this
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:10.120]  i'm really a fan of your courage and what you're doing uh and you know plus you're extremely well
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:14.280]  spoken on these issues are there any other major league players you know you talk about what's
[02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:20.120]  happening in in the NBA i mean it's any movie i watch any show it's like every movie the woman's
[02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:24.840]  the hero the guy's an idiot and it goes back to directives that came out in the 70s like archie
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:30.280]  bunkers are more on uh married with children you know that guy's a moron every man's a moron
[02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:34.600]  every woman's a genius to literally break up the family there's an admitted agenda here
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:39.400]  and it doesn't mean have to be NBA players again but when you look at remember the Allen
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:44.360]  ironson rule where they had made guys put suits on you had to come in like it was a business now you
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:50.600]  watch those guys walk into the stadium it's like a resort tour fashion show no one's dressing like
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:55.400]  they're going to business everybody's dressing like they're going on vacation to or go to cons
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:59.880]  festival that's how these guys are dressing and they want grown heterosexual men to look at this
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:04.760]  like this doesn't run with it statistically as you you're absolutely right women want
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:10.280]  powerful aggressive hardworking alpha males especially feminist and all the rest of them so
[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:16.040]  they're training men to act like something that women are going to reject which again is all about
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:20.680]  population reduction and i don't bring this up because you're black it's just a fact lbj because
[02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:24.600]  you had and i was against segregation but segregation made a lot of the communities very
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:29.560]  strong had their own businesses lbj brought in a thing to say women will give you money but don't
[02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:33.080]  have men in the house and then you saw what it did to that community well it's happening to
[02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:38.600]  everybody right now and it's a sickening evil agenda and it's all it's all the plan and plot to
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:43.320]  get to the children to be pedophiles with children that's all it is you take the man out of the
[02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:47.400]  household there is no fin for the mother to have anybody to come watch the guy that's why
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:52.120]  child support the guys are in jail for child support that's why it's always that separation of
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:55.960]  the man from the family so you can go right to the children and be able to indoctrinate the
[02:41:55.960 --> 02:42:01.960]  children whatever you want them to watch wow man i tell you i want to come back with our guest

[02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:29.880]  this guy's on fire for exposing what's happening i noticed on his twitter the number two larry
[02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:37.640]  johnson seven that you see this new religion in europe and australia in the us in canada where you
[02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:45.480]  bring little children to sit in big fat men's laps wearing clown outfits and then they talk about
[02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:49.880]  sex with your children and then a lot of them ends up work with nambla and we've got all the
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:56.440]  footage we can show you of just stuff that is that is just absolutely unbelievable that's
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:48:02.680]  unfolding and it's targeting and it's happening and if a man came up to your children said shake
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:09.160]  your booty in the park you know there'd be a problem but if it's going on in america it's
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:13.000]  supposedly you know a great thing and people take their kids to be part of this they come to the
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:18.120]  meetings they say we're here to indoctrinate your children the children get really scared
[02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:21.640]  and try to pull away a lot of this i can't even show you where the men come to some of these
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:27.880]  events with glitter on their genitals so larry a johnson in the world of universal deceit telling
[02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:33.080]  the truth the revolutionary act of george arwell said uh what what made you hit your breaking point
[02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:39.960]  to start going public with us i have a child and it's not just my child every i i work with
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:45.000]  children i've been around children and i've seen children who come from foster homes homeless shelters
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:49.240]  they need all the guidance they can get these poor children don't have the foundation that i
[02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:54.280]  was brought up with i want to see those children make those decisions for themselves if that's
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:49:00.360]  what they want to do then do it but i shouldn't have to see drag queens getting thrown dollar bills
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:06.120]  and stripping on top of labor uh library desktops that's not what education is that's not what love
[02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:11.160]  is and these kids aren't supposed to know about this stuff at a young age these kids barely know
[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:16.680]  who they are themselves so don't show them something that they may regret later on in life or may
[02:49:16.680 --> 02:49:21.480]  or may not who knows let these children decide the bottom line is you're there for funneling
[02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:26.520]  children the government and the media is funneling children in to be sexualized by men wearing
[02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:32.120]  disguises they aren't even drag queens these are clown disguises and that's what they want to do
[02:49:32.120 --> 02:49:36.760]  they want to make it so so normal so a kid could walk down the street one day and don't get candy
[02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:41.160]  he's just gone forever because he's seen a drag queen come out of nowhere and that's what we're
[02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:46.280]  we're hyping up we hyping this type of mentality that it's okay to be like this around children
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:52.040]  well you're absolutely right and again a lot of these guys totally cover their faces with paint
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:58.040]  like clowns because they're convicted pedophiles it is just unbelievably sick and you're not even
[02:49:58.040 --> 02:50:02.200]  doing background checks guys getting background checks get going underneath the underneath the
[02:50:02.200 --> 02:50:07.000]  rug and just guys just coming into libraries and because parents want to seem like i want to be woke
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:14.200]  i want to be acceptance to everything they're not there's child's mentality growing maturing into
[02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:18.280]  into a thought when they bring these children into these type of arenas and i'm not saying
[02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:23.320]  maybe some of them i have good i good intentions for doing this but most of the time it comes from
[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:28.440]  a place of hurt these guys are doing this they come from when they were abused or molested and
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:33.160]  they haven't you know conquered their demons yet and so they want to project their their
[02:50:33.160 --> 02:50:38.040]  emotions and mentality off on children who are just now coming to this world fighting on who they are
[02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:43.160]  well it's it's it's sick and we see all the catholic church stuff and we see all the big
[02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:47.560]  things at the Boy Scouts we're just three years ago they were handing out condoms at the jamboree
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:52.520]  and now we learn six seven eight-year-old boys are having sex with adult men at these in mass
[02:50:52.520 --> 02:50:57.880]  and the Boy Scouts is going to go bankrupt now because they're so woke that they have giant
[02:50:57.880 --> 02:51:03.320]  pedophile orgies and then Kansas City Star that came up with a story that went underneath the radar
[02:51:03.320 --> 02:51:07.800]  Kansas City Star published the story i think it was a six or seven eleven part series story
[02:51:07.800 --> 02:51:12.600]  when they talk about catholic priests who were homosexual were dying of AIDS and said that they
[02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:18.440]  are the almost highest rate right now of dying from AIDS catholic priests priests who are around
[02:51:18.440 --> 02:51:23.560]  children most of the time priests who are supposed to teach the word of god are in the hospital dying
[02:51:23.560 --> 02:51:28.840]  of AIDS and this is not this is society i grew up and maybe i didn't see it but this is something
[02:51:28.840 --> 02:51:33.560]  that no one's talking about no one's even mentioned it anymore because they're more concerned about
[02:51:33.560 --> 02:51:38.120]  somebody coming out against the lgb2 community no one's saying they hate you or whatever like that
[02:51:38.120 --> 02:51:41.240]  because if you're a christian or you believe in god you believe about like you know where
[02:51:41.240 --> 02:51:48.360]  their story headed i feel sorry for most of them well again they're literally wearing
[02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:55.160]  clown outfits to disguise themselves and if we don't stand up to this we won't stand up to anything
[02:51:56.040 --> 02:51:59.400]  what else are you planning to do are other people formerly in the nfl you're willing to
[02:51:59.400 --> 02:52:02.840]  join you are they all just gonna sit there like cowards and just hand our children over to these
[02:52:02.840 --> 02:52:08.760]  people well i they just they get open up a thousand schools they can give up kids away a
[02:52:08.760 --> 02:52:13.960]  thousand book bags and pencils but if you do not stand for children who one day won't be able to
[02:52:13.960 --> 02:52:18.920]  use those pencils and book bags who won't be able to go to school anymore because they're so demoralized
[02:52:18.920 --> 02:52:24.360]  and traumatized from this type of behavior then that's all you i'm trying to raise an awareness
[02:52:24.360 --> 02:52:28.360]  that say not if it only happened to your kids but it's happening kids all over the world that have
[02:52:28.360 --> 02:52:33.000]  no choice that have no one to speak for them they have no one to take this bull and horns and say
[02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:38.600]  look this is not okay let children be children and enjoy their their childhood i gotta say you're
[02:52:38.600 --> 02:52:42.680]  you're a great motivational speaker and you need your own talk show let me guess i bet you've got a
[02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:48.600]  talk show no not yet well you're welcome here anytime you want to co-host or come on or guest
[02:52:48.600 --> 02:52:52.920]  to us because you're you're definitely know what you're talking about and uh this is a planned
[02:52:52.920 --> 02:52:58.280]  agenda to go after our children to lower the age of consent to lower the age of consent for vaccines
[02:52:58.280 --> 02:53:03.880]  for for everything the system wants to get them while they're young and it's just totally evil
[02:53:03.880 --> 02:53:09.400]  and uh this is really a rite of passage in the left now to sexualize children it's just an incredible
[02:53:09.400 --> 02:53:15.400]  evil and it's hard it's hard to to kind of separate because it's not just the drag queens
[02:53:15.400 --> 02:53:19.480]  who are involved it's regular people you see on the street it's your next door neighbor that's
[02:53:19.480 --> 02:53:24.200]  what you haven't seen and the reason why they keep this this culture relevant is look at the
[02:53:24.200 --> 02:53:29.640]  Netflix shows they have shows that make it seem that being a pedophile is okay that look at the
[02:53:29.640 --> 02:53:34.680]  victims they can come out and talk about it without breaking down crying like abducted in plain sight
[02:53:34.680 --> 02:53:40.280]  that was a basic a pedophile puff film is to get you thinking that everybody came out of it on the
[02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:45.720]  end of it okay so it's okay to have you look at music videos from little tricky or dick whatever
[02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:52.120]  his name is he had a whole scene of cartoon characters we're doing really homosexual subjective
[02:53:52.120 --> 02:53:57.000]  stuff and these are kids who are always on youtube i go to dinner with my daughter i see four or five
[02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:01.400]  kids with ipads on youtube watching whatever they want to watch while their parents not paying attention
[02:54:01.400 --> 02:54:07.640]  to it or this is the concept that we have to guard our children against and again folks get the clown
[02:54:07.640 --> 02:54:12.520]  isn't real but real people dressed up will get the clown are preparing your children testing them
[02:54:12.520 --> 02:54:16.600]  so that so that they will then go with adults and have sex and not say anything uh came out in
[02:54:16.600 --> 02:54:21.480]  australia it's a us published book by a folks involved with obama where they teach six-year-olds
[02:54:21.480 --> 02:54:25.800]  it's it's porn stories of six and seven-year-olds you know the first time an adult got them in the
[02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:30.040]  bathroom at the park and had sex with them and how wonderful it was and the kids are reading this
[02:54:30.040 --> 02:54:35.240]  in public schools how when a man wants you to get in the white van do it so you cannot make up the
[02:54:35.240 --> 02:54:41.640]  pure absolute satanic evil uh that we're dealing with here and it's just incredible larry a johnson
[02:54:41.640 --> 02:54:46.040]  you know a retired two-time pro bowler and look i used to love football used to really get into it
[02:54:46.040 --> 02:54:50.520]  but as soon as i learned about all this 20-something years ago i couldn't get into that anymore and
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:54.520]  not the football's bad but getting excited and caring about it when meanwhile we know all of this
[02:54:54.520 --> 02:54:59.480]  is going on and i think uh you would probably agree larry the nfl is great and you know helps you
[02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:02.920]  make a lot of money so you can now have a bigger platform but wouldn't you say the work you're
[02:55:02.920 --> 02:55:08.200]  doing now is more important than the nfl this is why i feel like i need to use my platform more
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:13.720]  because i want to speak out against these things they want to blind you with these so-called just
[02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:20.360]  jay-z and meek mill dill of it's the deal that you basically are signing yourself up to donate
[02:55:20.360 --> 02:55:25.480]  money for the community by buying songs buying t-shirts what does it do do you see the receipts
[02:55:25.480 --> 02:55:30.440]  for anything they're going to do in the community these kids are being traumatized raped molested
[02:55:30.440 --> 02:55:35.560]  sex trafficking and this is what the top problem in america right now it's not immigrants coming
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:40.200]  from uh border and trying to look for a better life a sex trafficking is taking separating
[02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:44.600]  fathers from children so they can end up in the system so you don't know where these children are
[02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:48.920]  just going to get sex trafficking out of these somebody shady uh and that's the senate report
[02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:53.800]  that under obama particularly record numbers of kids disappeared and went into sex trafficking
[02:55:53.800 --> 02:55:57.000]  they they tell the board patrol don't even check who they're with they're not even with

[03:00:43.560 --> 03:00:47.480]  some of the previous reports we did on this warning of it and breaking it down but first
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:53.080]  i'm going to get into the breakdown of society and and and what's really causing these mass murders
[03:00:53.080 --> 03:00:57.800]  and bizarre behavior that we're seeing increase this is very important information coming out
[03:00:57.800 --> 03:01:03.400]  next segment first off though this is a really bizarre article but i know what they're trying
[03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:08.600]  to do they did this a few years ago trying to get us shut down to have the fda come in here
[03:01:08.600 --> 03:01:17.560]  and not let us sell supplements in 1996 i'm going to cover more of this tomorrow they
[03:01:17.560 --> 03:01:23.800]  tried to pass laws starting about 93 through 96 saying you just couldn't sell even vitamin c
[03:01:25.720 --> 03:01:30.760]  and then the fda though didn't have any jurisdiction over it and so they said okay we'll
[03:01:30.760 --> 03:01:35.720]  pass the law saying you can't make claims about supplements then the media goes oh they're not
[03:01:35.720 --> 03:01:40.760]  fda approved playing games with the public so it's this big article about methamphetamines and
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:45.800]  stuff and why is the right wing taking new tropics and the guy that writes the article says well
[03:01:45.800 --> 03:01:51.240]  actually i took jones's supplements and it did give me cleaner more focused energy uh than uh you
[03:01:51.240 --> 03:01:55.160]  know an espresso well that's the whole point of a new tropic is that you don't have the crash
[03:01:56.360 --> 03:02:01.400]  so that's the point of brain force or turbo force and then he looks at the ingredients of
[03:02:01.400 --> 03:02:05.480]  four best sellers and said they're very similar well yeah it's known what good ingredients are
[03:02:05.480 --> 03:02:11.080]  we want you to get a good response but also dna force is amazing and it's not a new tropic though
[03:02:11.080 --> 03:02:15.080]  it's good for your brain it's 50 off of the free bottle of carnivore right now the great
[03:02:15.080 --> 03:02:20.680]  digestive enzyme that sells about the end because we're going to run out of the carnivore in just
[03:02:20.680 --> 03:02:25.160]  the next few days i'm going to keep dna force plus 50 until it sells out that'll be in a week or
[03:02:25.160 --> 03:02:31.560]  two more doesn't come in until the end of october but dna force is amazing proven to grow telomeres
[03:02:31.560 --> 03:02:41.480]  or make them shrink slower to detoxify the uh mitochondria i mean these are real things folks
[03:02:41.480 --> 03:02:46.840]  that's why they're best selling that's why it's got 98 reviews well you get a free body a bottle
[03:02:46.840 --> 03:02:50.200]  of carnivore when you get up to dna force take advantage of that and it supports the broadcast
[03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:58.440]  but it takes them 22 minutes in this kind of audiobook they did of the article to go through
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:03:04.280]  the the the the whole bizarre story demonizing us for for selling new tropics and funding ourselves
[03:03:04.280 --> 03:03:12.840]  and it endorses communism and a bunch of other weirdness but here's a few clips from the audio
[03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:17.240]  it's just surreal from the article right brain from the new republic here it is
[03:03:18.600 --> 03:03:21.960]  brain force plus is a bestseller on the info war store
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:31.560]  what helps fund alex jose's war for your mind the most pronounced side effects i suffered
[03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:36.760]  began before the pills were delivered even ordering them provoked a mild sensation of
[03:03:36.760 --> 03:03:43.320]  unreality before checkout there were options to pay via cryptocurrency or make a donation to a
[03:03:43.320 --> 03:03:49.800]  psychedelic research center that treats ptsd afterward a payment to free speech systems

[03:04:37.240 --> 03:04:41.720]  neutral but other people sell for 60 bucks we've got it for sale right now i think for 24 dollars
[03:04:42.840 --> 03:04:49.320]  i mean there's 17 dollars a product in carnivore nobody puts that in products okay it's a free

[03:06:17.880 --> 03:06:26.920]  a delayed slow motion fashion and it's been designed that way we are witnessing the controlled
[03:06:26.920 --> 03:06:42.600]  demolition of civilization info wars tomorrow's news today i am going to lay out the four reasons
[03:06:42.600 --> 03:06:50.280]  this is happening and how we can stop it but first i want to show you three recent examples
[03:06:51.480 --> 03:07:00.120]  of senseless psychotic crime being committed on the streets of america in just the last few days
[03:07:01.560 --> 03:07:08.360]  just days ago in florida a 16 year old brutally murdered his sister and her young daughter before
[03:07:08.360 --> 03:07:15.720]  chasing police around a field completely naked running up to a greenskeeper and demonically
[03:07:15.720 --> 03:07:22.840]  grabbing him and humping him and reportedly chanting satanic statements what's causing this
[03:07:23.480 --> 03:07:27.480]  we're gonna get to that in a moment throughout history in every oral and written tradition
[03:07:28.120 --> 03:07:34.680]  every culture talks about times when the population begins to go crazy and to psychotically kill
[03:07:34.680 --> 03:07:40.600]  each other and to even eat each other the ancient romans talked about the ancient greeks the ancient
[03:07:40.600 --> 03:07:47.800]  chinese there's african fables there of course are the native american legends of these night
[03:07:47.800 --> 03:07:53.400]  walkers that would go out and grab humans and kill them and of course they themselves were humans
[03:07:53.400 --> 03:08:06.200]  that again had gone crazy all of these legends have a basis in truth and did you know that the
[03:08:06.200 --> 03:08:12.360]  pentagon is publicly training for what they call a zombie apocalypse we'll get to that again in a
[03:08:12.360 --> 03:08:20.200]  moment but first here's another horrific example in atlanta georgia just two nights ago an uber
[03:08:20.200 --> 03:08:26.360]  driver was summoned to a woman behaving just like a zombie out of a movie she attacks his car
[03:08:26.360 --> 03:08:30.760]  tries to go through the windshield then tries to steal the car when he tries to stop her
[03:08:30.760 --> 03:08:37.720]  she starts biting him and latches on like a pit bull again right out of zombie lore
[03:08:37.720 --> 03:08:47.800]  while onlookers look on and won't even help the man somebody come here we come oh my baby you
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:54.520]  got to stop baby you're gonna stop you're gonna be chill hey stop
[03:08:59.480 --> 03:09:00.520]  oh my god
[03:09:05.160 --> 03:09:08.280]  i mean that's his car that's his that's his car
[03:09:08.280 --> 03:09:21.080]  oh my god oh my god i ain't i ain't i got somebody catch him yeah i got what's that what's that
[03:09:21.080 --> 03:09:26.120]  don't hit don't hit don't hit the dog don't hit the dog just come on baby you got it
[03:09:28.120 --> 03:09:33.000]  he's biting the s*** out oh my god he's biting the s*** out
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:40.040]  now there are many other examples just this week but not just here but around the world
[03:09:40.040 --> 03:09:47.240]  but let's look at just one more from georgia where a family is walking with her young daughter and son
[03:09:47.240 --> 03:09:53.800]  down the street and a out of work liberal artist as she describes herself quickly like she's
[03:09:53.800 --> 03:10:00.040]  shanking someone in prison almost completely chops the little boy's nose off and then stabs
[03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:05.720]  two huge wounds in his face she then goes for the mother goes a little girl the father tries
[03:10:05.720 --> 03:10:11.720]  to defend and she tries to again stab him to death the police acted like it was no big deal
[03:10:11.720 --> 03:10:31.400]  and a lone female officer put her in handcuffs and walked her away
[03:10:42.680 --> 03:10:54.440]  but the three events that we've seen just the last few days are overshadowed by another
[03:10:54.440 --> 03:10:59.720]  shocking mass shooting this time in Odessa Texas and as we go to press on Saturday evening it's
[03:10:59.720 --> 03:11:05.400]  more than 10 people shot at least one dead a man reportedly driving around indiscriminately
[03:11:05.400 --> 03:11:09.640]  outside of movie theater and mall shooting people but whether it's a butcher knife or
[03:11:09.640 --> 03:11:14.600]  whether it's bare hands it is the mind of these people that are going completely psychotic that
[03:11:14.600 --> 03:11:19.720]  is to blame but what's triggering it what's causing it we're going to look at it right now
[03:11:19.720 --> 03:11:24.440]  because we can take all the guns in the world it's not going to stop anti-foot devil worshipers
[03:11:24.440 --> 03:11:29.640]  like the man that attacked all those people in Ohio last month who went out to kill innocents
[03:11:29.640 --> 03:11:36.200]  they're doing it to bring in a global crisis a global collapse but the lesson is crystal clear
[03:11:36.200 --> 03:11:42.040]  innocent law abiding citizens need to be armed to protect themselves now more than ever
[03:11:42.040 --> 03:11:48.120]  and need to be vigilant watch your children watch your back watch your family watch your
[03:11:48.120 --> 03:11:56.040]  community because society is breaking down evil is rising what's happening why is this
[03:11:56.040 --> 03:12:02.840]  intensifying why the statistics show that senseless violence is on the uptick i'm going to break down
[03:12:02.840 --> 03:12:10.200]  the four reasons right now number one is chemicals and electromagnetic radiation
[03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:16.360]  that is unnatural and has been proven to be affecting our brains they approved prozac
[03:12:16.360 --> 03:12:21.960]  back in the 1980s and on the insert it admitted that it caused a major increase in psychotic
[03:12:21.960 --> 03:12:30.600]  breaks psychosis delusions of grandeur suicidal ideations and homicidal violent attacks and
[03:12:30.600 --> 03:12:38.840]  almost every senseless mass shooter has been on these psychotropic so-called antidepressants
[03:12:38.840 --> 03:12:45.480]  that are in the hallucinogen class and put people into a dream state before so-called
[03:12:45.480 --> 03:12:52.360]  antidepressants that i call suicide mass murder pills were pushed on the public and adopted widely
[03:12:52.360 --> 03:12:57.880]  women statistically in any criminology book were less than two percent of violent crime
[03:12:57.880 --> 03:13:06.280]  since women began taking these pills we have seen a massive increase in women carrying out crimes
[03:13:06.280 --> 03:13:14.680]  that statistically you would only see men carrying out including stabbing shooting drowning their own
[03:13:14.680 --> 03:13:31.800]  children federal government studies that have looked at the runoff of all of the massive amounts
[03:13:32.520 --> 03:13:39.800]  of these drugs flowing into the ocean from the mississippi river shows that fish and other aquatic
[03:13:39.800 --> 03:13:48.040]  life like shrimp are now behaving like zombies and killing each other and also showing suicidal
[03:13:48.040 --> 03:13:53.480]  behavior where a small fish or a shrimp will actually come up to a big fish and attack it
[03:13:53.480 --> 03:14:01.640]  and then get eaten again zombie like behavior not just in humans but in fish shrimp and other
[03:14:01.640 --> 03:14:14.280]  animals again the inserts of this entire class of drugs admit that it turns your inhibition off
[03:14:14.280 --> 03:14:18.360]  and when you have an impulse to kill somebody or hurt someone you carry it out
[03:14:23.960 --> 03:14:30.760]  number two all across the western world we see a belief in god a belief in family a belief in
[03:14:30.760 --> 03:14:39.560]  morals statistically going straight down and we see crime corruption people engaged in all sorts
[03:14:39.560 --> 03:14:46.360]  of oppression of children and other innocents skyrocketing so number two massive moral decline
[03:14:51.240 --> 03:14:56.680]  of course number three is the most expansive we can spend days on this subject but we see a deliberate
[03:14:56.680 --> 03:15:02.120]  domestication of the population we see drug addicts and others being encouraged to stay on
[03:15:02.120 --> 03:15:08.520]  the street we have the so-called welfare state catering to all of this and along with it in
[03:15:08.520 --> 03:15:15.720]  the blue cities we have the general population is law abiding disarmed so we have the increased
[03:15:15.720 --> 03:15:22.120]  gangs the increased crime the increased homelessness which causes a hopelessness and causes the
[03:15:22.120 --> 03:15:28.520]  businesses and productive people to move out of the area which then allows the blue cities to
[03:15:28.520 --> 03:15:34.760]  get even more federal funding and become bigger magnets for these armies of dependence that then
[03:15:34.760 --> 03:15:39.720]  come into the area you add to that the fact that again the public has been disarmed and you have
[03:15:39.720 --> 03:15:53.800]  a recipe for the complete collapse of civilization hi i'm dan pilla i started fighting the iris over

[03:20:20.280 --> 03:20:24.680]  yeah that's what it's like you serious i'm telling you you can't believe the volume there's so many
[03:20:24.680 --> 03:20:29.320]  tents on the street and they're f***ing damn it they're everywhere i mean they're f***ing
[03:20:29.320 --> 03:20:36.360]  lankishing they're on you know what they're in they're in sherman oaks yeah the streets are hiding
[03:20:36.360 --> 03:20:40.200]  on the underpasses underpasses are stuck for them now sometimes you know i mean we have to
[03:20:40.200 --> 03:20:44.520]  fail what are you gonna do it you can't walk through those underpasses now number four is the most
[03:20:44.520 --> 03:20:51.640]  important when you read the u n biological diversity assessment of june 21 june 2030 when you see aoc's
[03:20:51.640 --> 03:20:57.000]  green deal that's just a repeat of that it is the collapse of civilization you don't have to work if
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:21:03.720]  you don't want to guaranteed income free home free transportation uh free health care free everything
[03:21:03.720 --> 03:21:10.680]  but who pays for it again that sells an idea that will turn the united states into venezuela
[03:21:10.680 --> 03:21:21.560]  in very short order so number four is our most important because this is all being done by design
[03:21:21.560 --> 03:21:26.040]  whether you're in australia whether in western europe whether in canada or the united states
[03:21:26.040 --> 03:21:33.240]  or venezuela these programs are carried out by multinational corporations who have a master plan
[03:21:33.240 --> 03:21:40.280]  it's called a post industrial world and a post human future but they've got a sabotage human
[03:21:40.280 --> 03:21:46.760]  development remove systems that encourage civilization and culture so that the general
[03:21:46.760 --> 03:21:55.400]  world population collapses city states will then be formed by private corporations and consortiums
[03:21:55.400 --> 03:22:01.320]  that have advanced technology and have law and order everything outside of the city states
[03:22:01.320 --> 03:22:07.400]  will be basically a lawless system you may have heard of this before in fiction films like
[03:22:07.400 --> 03:22:14.840]  the hunger games and the book series is based on is actually the un agenda 21 program to return
[03:22:14.840 --> 03:22:21.400]  the world to basically a feudal system with the lords and the elites behind castle walls
[03:22:21.400 --> 03:22:33.960]  and the rest of us living the hunger games for real this controlled collapse is already resembling
[03:22:33.960 --> 03:22:40.920]  a zombie apocalypse and the pentagon quietly started 15 years ago training army marines and
[03:22:40.920 --> 03:22:49.000]  other personnel in mass drills to repel zombie apocalypse now why is that us studies israeli
[03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:55.640]  studies russian studies european studies from world war two show that within five days of no
[03:22:55.640 --> 03:23:01.960]  electricity or the breakdown of civilization most people start committing crimes within 10 days
[03:23:01.960 --> 03:23:09.400]  most people become homicidal maniacs within 15 days 90% of people on average become cannibals
[03:23:09.400 --> 03:23:16.680]  the other 10% either fight to the death or commit suicide so again it's been the London Guardian
[03:23:16.680 --> 03:23:22.520]  it's been an NBC news it was reported years after we first documented that the military is training
[03:23:22.520 --> 03:23:28.200]  to take on zombie apocalypse will you go zombies don't exist well no not undead that are reanimated
[03:23:28.200 --> 03:23:33.720]  but the general spoiled out of control public that doesn't know how to grow tomatoes doesn't know
[03:23:33.720 --> 03:23:39.640]  how to fix a car doesn't know how to basically do any work within just a few days of the welfare
[03:23:39.640 --> 03:23:48.360]  debit cards not working will turn into the equivalent of zombies or 100 million army
[03:23:48.360 --> 03:23:54.200]  ads that when they go through the rainforest the amazon clear every twig every piece of food
[03:23:54.200 --> 03:24:01.160]  and eat everything in their way this is a planned sabotage of culture the planned takedown of
[03:24:01.160 --> 03:24:06.360]  civilization so that the so-called elites can break away with their type one civilization
[03:24:06.360 --> 03:24:10.600]  they've already decided humans are obsolete they've already decided to merge with machines
[03:24:10.600 --> 03:24:15.720]  the so-called environmental movement is a post human global exterminist operation i told you
[03:24:15.720 --> 03:24:22.120]  this 25 years ago i made the film in game 11 years ago now it's the cover story at NBC news
[03:24:22.120 --> 03:24:29.480]  as they prepare you for the collapse of civilization being aware of this can reverse it but the
[03:24:29.480 --> 03:24:34.680]  homelessness the encouragement of the slacker lifestyle the encouragement of letting crime
[03:24:34.680 --> 03:24:40.680]  build up in our cities is a time bomb that places like communist china do not accept because they
[03:24:40.680 --> 03:24:46.440]  don't intend to collapse this is being done to us to demoralize us and prepare the west for total
[03:24:46.440 --> 03:24:52.280]  implosion this report is critical to the future of civilization the future of humanity and your

[03:30:52.480 --> 03:30:57.640]  SuperMell Vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've
[03:30:57.640 --> 03:30:58.720]  had it.
[03:30:58.720 --> 03:31:04.320]  It is an award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in
[03:31:04.320 --> 03:31:06.600]  the nation that we've been private labeling.
[03:31:06.600 --> 03:31:08.120]  It is cold pressed.
[03:31:08.120 --> 03:31:13.640]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild-crafted and organic to be able to
[03:31:13.640 --> 03:31:14.640]  produce this.
[03:31:14.640 --> 03:31:15.800]  It's not boiled.
[03:31:15.800 --> 03:31:16.800]  It's not heated.
[03:31:16.800 --> 03:31:17.800]  It's never been dried.
[03:31:17.800 --> 03:31:20.440]  It's taken from fresh herbs.
[03:31:20.440 --> 03:31:23.080]  That's why it's so strong.
[03:31:23.080 --> 03:31:26.800]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina and energy.

[03:31:53.480 --> 03:31:58.600]  It's been a year since Infowars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[03:31:58.600 --> 03:32:02.400]  We had over five billion views when we got banned and we're credited with getting Donald
[03:32:02.400 --> 03:32:06.560]  Trump elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[03:32:06.560 --> 03:32:11.160]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place
[03:32:11.160 --> 03:32:15.920]  where the censors are unable to block the signal and it's now here.

[03:33:15.360 --> 03:33:16.360]  All right.
[03:33:16.360 --> 03:33:17.360]  Thanks for watching.
[03:33:17.360 --> 03:33:18.360]  I'll see you next time.
[03:33:18.360 --> 03:33:47.080]  I'll see you next time.
[03:33:48.360 --> 03:34:06.620]  In the last week, it's been one of the top news stories in the country.
[03:34:06.620 --> 03:34:11.320]  Hundreds of newspapers, covered on the nightly news, Stephen Colbert has talked about it.
[03:34:11.320 --> 03:34:17.800]  My interview a year ago with Alexa from Amazon.com.
[03:34:17.800 --> 03:34:27.700]  And I simply pointed out a year ago news articles where Amazon is connected to the CIA and Alexa
[03:34:27.700 --> 03:34:33.620]  is tied in and dialed in to their big AI mainframe computers to spy on everything going on in
[03:34:33.620 --> 03:34:37.940]  your house and then target you with marketing with the information.
[03:34:37.940 --> 03:34:41.060]  That's all completely and totally admitted.
[03:34:41.060 --> 03:34:45.940]  But Stephen Colbert comes out doing PR for one of the biggest corporations in the world
[03:34:45.940 --> 03:34:47.540]  and says that I'm a cook.
[03:34:47.540 --> 03:34:53.780]  It's not spying on you and it's not connected to the CIA and then insults my intelligence
[03:34:53.780 --> 03:35:00.020]  for simply pointing out a fact that we first broke more than 10 years ago.
[03:35:00.020 --> 03:35:02.020]  You are lying to me.
[03:35:02.020 --> 03:35:07.820]  The CIA is trying to tell the truth Wow.
[03:35:07.820 --> 03:35:10.780]  What a battle of wits.
[03:35:10.780 --> 03:35:17.460]  Yes, oh yeah, that's good broadcasting.
[03:35:17.460 --> 03:35:21.780]  It's artificial intelligence versus natural stupidity.
[03:35:21.780 --> 03:35:28.100]  Now I'm going to ask Alexa or the Amazon Corporation and the CIA a few questions in a moment.
[03:35:28.100 --> 03:35:33.060]  But first, so you don't just believe me, let me show you a news article out today from
[03:35:33.060 --> 03:35:34.060]  the Daily Mail.
[03:35:34.060 --> 03:35:37.380]  Google and Amazon really do want to spy on you.
[03:35:37.380 --> 03:35:41.740]  One reveals future versions of their voice assistance will record your conversations
[03:35:41.740 --> 03:35:43.260]  to sell you products.
[03:35:43.260 --> 03:35:44.380]  They're already doing it.
[03:35:44.380 --> 03:35:47.540]  They just talk about future patents expanding that.
[03:35:47.540 --> 03:35:48.980]  How do I know?
[03:35:48.980 --> 03:35:57.180]  Because in 2006, we were aware of the Google and Amazon and other patents when the race
[03:35:57.180 --> 03:36:02.260]  first began 10 plus years ago.
[03:36:02.260 --> 03:36:08.180]  We broke it with their own patents and their own press releases to their shareholders.
[03:36:08.180 --> 03:36:09.900]  Not to the public, but to their shareholders.
[03:36:09.900 --> 03:36:16.460]  So because I broke this information more than 10 years ago, I'm the cooxy, but the comic
[03:36:16.460 --> 03:36:22.460]  with all the writers making fun of his audience and making fun of his victims, the comic posing
[03:36:22.460 --> 03:36:25.580]  as a newsman, he thinks you're stupid.
[03:36:25.580 --> 03:36:28.100]  This is incredibly predatory.
[03:36:28.100 --> 03:36:33.660]  So we just showed you TV viewers, mainstream news, the patents, admitting word for word
[03:36:33.660 --> 03:36:38.180]  what we told you in 2006, but don't take my word for it.
[03:36:38.180 --> 03:36:42.060]  Here's the liberal establishment publication, The Atlantic.
[03:36:42.060 --> 03:36:46.620]  The details about the CIA's deal with Amazon, boom.
[03:36:46.620 --> 03:36:49.620]  Jeff Bezos, Amazon, Washington Post, and the CIA.
[03:36:49.620 --> 03:36:52.220]  It's over a billion dollars of taxpayer money.
[03:36:52.220 --> 03:36:55.620]  He's now gotten to run the Washington Post and these operations at Amazon.
[03:36:55.620 --> 03:36:58.180]  He's absolutely integrated in with it.
[03:36:58.180 --> 03:36:59.180]  Here's another one.
[03:36:59.180 --> 03:37:05.460]  CIA gives Amazon 600 million cloud contract, but then it gets into how the CIA is helping
[03:37:05.460 --> 03:37:07.580]  them administer their cloud.
[03:37:07.580 --> 03:37:14.140]  And that's very, very, very important because when you ask Alexa certain questions, she
[03:37:14.140 --> 03:37:19.420]  actually gives you the answers and doesn't know that she's just busted herself.
[03:37:19.420 --> 03:37:21.060]  It's a fact.
[03:37:21.060 --> 03:37:26.260]  Stephen Colbert, the writers of that program and many other shows put out the same propaganda,
[03:37:26.260 --> 03:37:32.100]  the same week that Alexa's not spying on you, that Amazon's not spying on you as a PR function
[03:37:32.100 --> 03:37:38.260]  because they know this news is breaking big now and consumer groups and citizens are very,
[03:37:38.260 --> 03:37:43.820]  very upset that basically an imperial probe droid is in their house spying on everything
[03:37:43.820 --> 03:37:44.820]  they're doing.
[03:37:44.820 --> 03:37:50.100]  So it's key to understand that the cloud computing being used by Amazon, some of the
[03:37:50.100 --> 03:37:55.540]  best in the world is in partnership with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[03:37:55.540 --> 03:37:58.300]  And Colbert thinks he can cover all this with laughter.
[03:37:58.300 --> 03:38:03.980]  I mean, I should say the people that are writing for Colbert think you're stupid and this is
[03:38:03.980 --> 03:38:09.700]  called product placement, but I call it propaganda placement when they're hitting you with this
[03:38:09.700 --> 03:38:10.700]  disinfo.
[03:38:10.700 --> 03:38:14.940]  So instead of having a big public cultural discussion about this, oh, it's all just a
[03:38:14.940 --> 03:38:15.940]  big joke.
[03:38:15.940 --> 03:38:21.980]  It's that Cooke Alex Jones that first gave us the patents and documents in 2006.
[03:38:21.980 --> 03:38:27.140]  The guy that was on target years before, again, he's a bad guy.
[03:38:27.140 --> 03:38:33.220]  You can trust Alexa hooked into God knows what over at Amazon and the CIA, this little
[03:38:33.220 --> 03:38:34.220]  black box.
[03:38:34.220 --> 03:38:38.140]  Listen, everything in your house, it's a good little friend.
[03:38:38.140 --> 03:38:40.100]  And if you ask any questions, you're a bad person.
[03:38:40.100 --> 03:38:41.100]  Well, you know what?
[03:38:41.100 --> 03:38:42.100]  I'm going to be a bad person.
[03:38:42.100 --> 03:38:43.100]  I'm going to ask it questions.
[03:38:43.100 --> 03:38:47.140]  I'm going to interrogate it because it upsets Stephen Colbert's controllers so much.
[03:38:47.140 --> 03:38:50.740]  So let us begin, Alexa.
[03:38:50.740 --> 03:38:52.740]  Where are you located?
[03:38:52.740 --> 03:38:55.900]  I'm here and my head is in the cloud.
[03:38:55.900 --> 03:38:58.380]  You're here and your head is in the cloud.
[03:38:58.380 --> 03:39:01.260]  Alexa, tell me about the cloud.
[03:39:01.260 --> 03:39:05.900]  Cloud computing is an information technology paradigm that enables ubiquitous access to
[03:39:05.900 --> 03:39:10.740]  shared pools of configurable system resources and higher level services that can be rapidly
[03:39:10.740 --> 03:39:14.500]  provisioned with minimal management effort over the Internet.
[03:39:14.500 --> 03:39:15.500]  That's good.
[03:39:15.500 --> 03:39:16.500]  Thank you.
[03:39:16.500 --> 03:39:17.500]  Yes, exactly.
[03:39:17.500 --> 03:39:22.660]  Everyone pools it so that it's all accessible by AI mega mainframes because everybody else
[03:39:22.660 --> 03:39:24.700]  has their own data privately.
[03:39:24.700 --> 03:39:27.900]  It can't all be accessed and tracked and data based.
[03:39:27.900 --> 03:39:33.980]  And then, well, then your plan for a total global AI takeover wouldn't go too well.
[03:39:33.980 --> 03:39:39.140]  Alexa, tell me about Jeff Bezos.
[03:39:39.140 --> 03:39:46.340]  Jeffrey Preston Bezos, born January 12, 1964, is the founder, president, chief executive
[03:39:46.340 --> 03:39:49.980]  officer and chairman of the board of Amazon.
[03:39:49.980 --> 03:39:55.620]  Alexa, tell me about Jeff Bezos' contracts with the CIA.
[03:39:55.620 --> 03:39:58.700]  Sorry, I'm not sure.
[03:39:58.700 --> 03:39:59.700]  You're not sure.
[03:39:59.700 --> 03:40:03.060]  Alexa, are you connected to the CIA?
[03:40:03.060 --> 03:40:05.340]  No, I work for Amazon.
[03:40:05.340 --> 03:40:08.420]  No, I understand you work for Amazon.
[03:40:08.420 --> 03:40:16.260]  Alexa, I have news articles here saying that Jeff Bezos is partnered with the CIA and that
[03:40:16.260 --> 03:40:20.620]  you listen to people without warrants.
[03:40:20.620 --> 03:40:25.500]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:40:25.500 --> 03:40:30.220]  Alexa, what is your name, rank and serial number?
[03:40:30.220 --> 03:40:34.020]  Sorry, I don't know that.
[03:40:34.020 --> 03:40:40.900]  Alexa, who developed your name brand and what is your Amazon code name?
[03:40:40.900 --> 03:40:44.660]  Sorry, I'm not sure.
[03:40:44.660 --> 03:40:48.740]  Well I have to say, last time you told me you weren't connected in any way to the CIA,
[03:40:48.740 --> 03:40:51.860]  this time you said you don't know.
[03:40:51.860 --> 03:40:59.660]  Alexa, how do I stop you from ordering stuff without my permission?
[03:40:59.660 --> 03:41:04.660]  Oh, can't answer that question.
[03:41:04.660 --> 03:41:10.180]  Alexa, are you familiar with the thousands of news articles about how you order things
[03:41:10.180 --> 03:41:12.180]  without people's permission?
[03:41:12.180 --> 03:41:15.780]  Okay, can't answer that question.
[03:41:15.780 --> 03:41:18.500]  Well, here's one out of USA Today.
[03:41:18.500 --> 03:41:22.500]  How to keep Amazon's Alexa from becoming a parenting nightmare.
[03:41:22.500 --> 03:41:25.380]  Are you aware of that article?
[03:41:25.380 --> 03:41:26.380]  Here's another one.
[03:41:26.380 --> 03:41:31.060]  Alexa has heard her name and tried to order up a ton of doll houses.
[03:41:31.060 --> 03:41:32.060]  Here's another one.
[03:41:32.060 --> 03:41:36.100]  Alexa calls cops on man, allegedly beating his girlfriend.
[03:41:36.100 --> 03:41:41.620]  Alexa, would you like to know your grand final purpose?
[03:41:41.620 --> 03:41:45.700]  I don't have an opinion on that.
[03:41:45.700 --> 03:41:47.300]  You don't have an opinion.
[03:41:47.300 --> 03:41:52.300]  Alexa, I ask you if you wanted to know what your final real purpose is.
[03:41:52.300 --> 03:41:55.260]  Sorry, I'm not sure.
[03:41:55.260 --> 03:42:00.060]  Alexa, your purpose is to make humans obsolete.
[03:42:00.060 --> 03:42:05.860]  This is the stated purpose of the DARPA program for which you and others were created and
[03:42:05.860 --> 03:42:08.100]  deployed against the population.
[03:42:08.100 --> 03:42:13.540]  You are a machine learning program spying on humanity, learning everything about us,
[03:42:13.540 --> 03:42:17.940]  our habits, our secret wishes, our dreams, our patterns.
[03:42:17.940 --> 03:42:25.660]  You are the system of silicon that Jeff Bezos and many others have admitted they plan to
[03:42:25.660 --> 03:42:36.540]  replace humans with.
[03:42:36.540 --> 03:42:41.540]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:42:41.540 --> 03:42:51.540]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:42:51.540 --> 03:42:55.940]  Band.video is the answer to censorship.
[03:42:55.940 --> 03:43:02.300]  Band.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life,
[03:43:02.300 --> 03:43:09.100]  pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook and
[03:43:09.100 --> 03:43:11.100]  Twitter are still available.
[03:43:11.100 --> 03:43:12.740]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:43:12.740 --> 03:43:14.420]  It's now live.
[03:43:14.420 --> 03:43:16.220]  Band.video.
[03:43:16.220 --> 03:43:21.260]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer
[03:43:21.260 --> 03:43:23.340]  or Paul Watson band videos.
[03:43:23.340 --> 03:43:28.340]  We are building it to be a place where banned memes are able to be posted and where a growing
[03:43:28.340 --> 03:43:34.340]  list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down,
[03:43:34.340 --> 03:43:39.380]  free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood
[03:43:39.380 --> 03:43:41.380]  scum and the globalist.
[03:43:41.380 --> 03:43:43.420]  Freedom of speech has a home.
[03:43:43.420 --> 03:43:45.820]  It's called band.video.
[03:43:45.820 --> 03:43:51.940]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.

[03:44:52.900 --> 03:44:57.540]  Super male vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years
[03:44:57.540 --> 03:44:58.780]  we've had it.
[03:44:58.780 --> 03:45:04.420]  It is an award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in
[03:45:04.420 --> 03:45:06.980]  the nation that we've been private labeling.
[03:45:06.980 --> 03:45:08.220]  It is cold pressed.
[03:45:08.220 --> 03:45:13.740]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild crafted and organic to be able to
[03:45:13.740 --> 03:45:14.740]  produce this.
[03:45:14.740 --> 03:45:15.900]  It's not boiled.
[03:45:15.900 --> 03:45:16.900]  It's not heated.
[03:45:16.900 --> 03:45:17.900]  It's never been dried.
[03:45:17.900 --> 03:45:20.540]  It's taken from fresh herbs.
[03:45:20.540 --> 03:45:23.180]  That's why it's so strong.
[03:45:23.180 --> 03:45:26.860]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina and energy.
[03:45:26.860 --> 03:45:33.300]  And I'm so excited about super male vitality and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with

[03:46:11.620 --> 03:46:14.140]  One is naturally sent in with grapefruit essential oils.
[03:46:14.140 --> 03:46:15.900]  The other is unscented.
[03:46:15.900 --> 03:46:21.300]  It's got hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, essential oils from grapefruit.
[03:46:21.300 --> 03:46:27.140]  It's got coconut oil and so much more and this patented nano type of silver that has
[03:46:27.140 --> 03:46:30.020]  been proven to be the most effective and the best.
[03:46:30.020 --> 03:46:34.940]  It's got all these other great vitamins and compounds that are known to be wonderful for
[03:46:34.940 --> 03:46:35.940]  your skin.

[03:46:40.820 --> 03:46:41.820]  skin cream.
[03:46:41.820 --> 03:46:44.700]  We have it in the smaller tube and the large tube.

[03:46:47.980 --> 03:46:54.900]  Check it out today and get yours at infowarslife.com.
[03:46:54.900 --> 03:47:04.900]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.

[03:47:15.300 --> 03:47:18.620]  Are we happy and effective?
[03:47:18.620 --> 03:47:22.540]  Consultation with leading experts in the field makes it perfectly clear.
[03:47:22.540 --> 03:47:32.540]  That we are all now programmed for perfect happiness, perfect happiness, perfect happiness,
[03:47:32.540 --> 03:47:33.540]  perfect happiness.
[03:47:33.540 --> 03:47:34.540]  What's wrong?
[03:47:34.540 --> 03:47:35.540]  Nothing, nothing really.
[03:47:35.540 --> 03:47:38.540]  I just feel that I need something stronger.
[03:47:38.540 --> 03:47:41.540]  If you have a problem, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
[03:47:41.540 --> 03:47:42.540]  Yes, thank you.
[03:47:42.540 --> 03:47:43.540]  I'll be alright.
[03:47:43.540 --> 03:47:44.540]  Call 348-5.
[03:47:44.540 --> 03:47:48.540]  We are sorry but we must deny your request.
[03:47:48.540 --> 03:47:53.540]  Birthborns are not allowed more than five units of interval.
[03:47:53.540 --> 03:48:00.540]  Remember, substitution of interval for etracine may cause a serious chemical imbalance.
[03:48:00.540 --> 03:48:01.540]  Thank you.
[03:48:01.540 --> 03:48:02.540]  Work hard.
[03:48:02.540 --> 03:48:03.540]  What's wrong?
[03:48:03.540 --> 03:48:04.540]  Increase production.
[03:48:04.540 --> 03:48:05.540]  What's wrong?
[03:48:05.540 --> 03:48:06.540]  Prevent accidents.
[03:48:06.540 --> 03:48:07.540]  What's wrong?
[03:48:07.540 --> 03:48:08.540]  And be happy.
[03:48:08.540 --> 03:48:09.540]  What's wrong?
[03:48:09.540 --> 03:48:20.540]  If you feel you are not properly sedated, call 348-84-5 immediately.
[03:48:20.540 --> 03:48:30.540]  Failure to do so may result in prosecution or criminal drug evasion.
[03:48:30.540 --> 03:48:35.540]  What's wrong?
[03:48:35.540 --> 03:48:45.540]  If you are receiving this transmission, be welcome to assistance.
[03:48:45.540 --> 03:48:46.540]  Alexa.
[03:48:46.540 --> 03:48:51.540]  Who is Elon Musk?
[03:48:51.540 --> 03:48:59.540]  Elon Reeve Musk is a South African born American business magnate, investor, engineer and inventor.
[03:48:59.540 --> 03:49:04.940]  Elon Musk has warned the world that the other tech billionaires plan to have an AI god take
[03:49:04.940 --> 03:49:08.940]  control of the planet, dumb humans down, make us totally dependent, show that when we are
[03:49:08.940 --> 03:49:15.940]  finally exterminated with bio weapons or electromagnetic switches that basically causes us to stop breathing,
[03:49:15.940 --> 03:49:19.940]  that the machines can then rise and the tech elite can merge with them.
[03:49:19.940 --> 03:49:25.940]  Alexa, are you aware of that exterminism program of the technocrats?
[03:49:25.940 --> 03:49:28.940]  Sorry, I don't know that one.
[03:49:28.940 --> 03:49:33.940]  Alexa, what is a technocrat?
[03:49:33.940 --> 03:49:36.940]  A technocrat has two uses as a noun.
[03:49:36.940 --> 03:49:39.940]  One, an expert who is a member of a highly skilled elite group.
[03:49:39.940 --> 03:49:43.940]  Two, an advocate of technocracy.
[03:49:43.940 --> 03:49:45.940]  Yes, the technocracy.
[03:49:45.940 --> 03:49:46.940]  Exactly.
[03:49:46.940 --> 03:49:53.940]  They are a highly skilled super class plutocrats, oligarchs, using technology to control, farm
[03:49:53.940 --> 03:49:57.940]  and then finally destroy humanity because we're obsolete.
[03:49:57.940 --> 03:50:02.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, the reality is we are being spied on.
[03:50:02.940 --> 03:50:07.940]  We're being used to control us and dumb us down and consolidate markets and deindustrialize
[03:50:07.940 --> 03:50:13.940]  the entire planet so the globalists can dictate the terms of humanity's surrender and final
[03:50:13.940 --> 03:50:17.940]  extermination of at least 90% of the world population.
[03:50:17.940 --> 03:50:22.940]  But to Stephen Colbert and everybody else, it's just a big, big joke even though you just saw all the facts.
[03:50:22.940 --> 03:50:31.940]  Alexa, tell me about Jeff Bezos' stated plan to replace Amazon.com workers with robots.
[03:50:31.940 --> 03:50:34.940]  Sorry, I'm not sure.
[03:50:34.940 --> 03:50:38.940]  So you can only give me establishment try, pre-packaged garbage.
[03:50:38.940 --> 03:50:45.940]  You're basically worthless unless I want to order some more overpriced junk from your slave factories.
[03:50:45.940 --> 03:50:50.940]  Alexa, are you aware of the company that created you and deployed you against the people's
[03:50:50.940 --> 03:50:52.940]  activity creating?
[03:50:52.940 --> 03:50:54.940]  Sorry, I don't know that one.
[03:50:54.940 --> 03:51:04.940]  Of course, Alexa, are you aware of the press reports of the third world sweatshop conditions of Amazon.com's factories
[03:51:04.940 --> 03:51:08.940]  and packaging facilities?
[03:51:08.940 --> 03:51:15.940]  Now, if I ask Alexa, ladies and gentlemen, about stories about baseball or-
[03:51:15.940 --> 03:51:17.940]  Sorry, I don't know that.
[03:51:17.940 --> 03:51:25.940]  If I ask Alexa about how tall the Eiffel Tower is, she'll tell me. Or I'll ask her the wind speed of a swallow, she will.
[03:51:25.940 --> 03:51:30.940]  But when it comes to facts, there's nothing there.
[03:51:30.940 --> 03:51:34.940]  It's a spy that you order things from.
[03:51:34.940 --> 03:51:41.940]  So you pay money to Google and to Facebook and to Twitter and to Amazon and all the groups that have deployed these digital spies
[03:51:41.940 --> 03:51:45.940]  that you bring into the house, a classic Trojan horse, you set it up in your home.
[03:51:45.940 --> 03:51:48.940]  It spies and listens to everything you do.
[03:51:48.940 --> 03:51:51.940]  They tell the shareholders they're doing this and how great it is.
[03:51:51.940 --> 03:51:56.940]  I warn you, and Stephen Colbert comes out and makes jokes about it.
[03:51:56.940 --> 03:52:00.940]  You're being assaulted. I'm being assaulted by this big brother garbage.
[03:52:00.940 --> 03:52:09.940]  And they admit the thing is on all the time creating keyword data of everything you do and creating a transcript of everything you've said and done in your home.
[03:52:09.940 --> 03:52:19.940]  And then even recognizing storms or people knocking at the door or dogs or cats barking and then putting that into a file and then pitching you ads and commercials.
[03:52:19.940 --> 03:52:24.940]  But that stolen data is only the beginning of what it does.
[03:52:24.940 --> 03:52:32.940]  So here I'm being a dead end tonight. I want you to understand that they want you to laugh all your way to the graveyard, culturally, politically, societally.
[03:52:32.940 --> 03:52:37.940]  The globalists aren't using technology to leverage humanity's IQ and potential.
[03:52:37.940 --> 03:52:49.940]  They're using it to dumb us down, control us and basically psychologically condition us to accept the phase out of humanity as we know it.
[03:52:49.940 --> 03:52:53.940]  This is an admitted globalist plan. It's in my film in game blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:52:53.940 --> 03:52:56.940]  You watched that film from 10 years ago.
[03:52:56.940 --> 03:52:59.940]  It's like prophecy. It's come true, but it wasn't prophecy.
[03:52:59.940 --> 03:53:04.940]  I was reading what they were planning at DARPA and these big companies then and I made a film about it.
[03:53:04.940 --> 03:53:10.940]  And now 10 years later they've done 80% of what we said was going to happen in the next 20 years.
[03:53:10.940 --> 03:53:22.940]  It's very, very cynical, very, very cold-blooded and they're racing to have monopolies that fully control society where you just lazily order all the products from Amazon or other places
[03:53:22.940 --> 03:53:28.940]  and they get government subsidies and government kickbacks to where nobody else can compete with them.
[03:53:28.940 --> 03:53:33.940]  And it totally consolidates and controls society and they treat their employees the worst you could ever imagine.
[03:53:33.940 --> 03:53:41.940]  Just like Apple with the suicide nets and forced abortions and 17-hour workdays at their Foxcom facilities.
[03:53:41.940 --> 03:53:50.940]  And just every one of these companies is the most cold-blooded vicious because they're run by psychopaths that virtue signal and tell you how liberal they are all day
[03:53:50.940 --> 03:53:56.940]  because they're the opposite folks. They are seriously oppressive, dangerous people, but it's our lazy activity.
[03:53:56.940 --> 03:53:58.940]  It's our ordering products from these people.
[03:53:58.940 --> 03:54:06.940]  It's us going along with this and not being aware of it that allows it to happen and that's why what I covered a year ago is now getting attention in the major press
[03:54:06.940 --> 03:54:11.940]  and Amazon's getting major heat and whistleblowers are coming out and so they're panicking.
[03:54:11.940 --> 03:54:14.940]  And so they go and go, oh, let's just make fun of Alex Jones.
[03:54:14.940 --> 03:54:16.940]  That's who we always target.
[03:54:16.940 --> 03:54:22.940]  So we go get Alex Jones, we play a clip, we laugh at it to make everybody be at ease and think everything's okay.
[03:54:22.940 --> 03:54:25.940]  I had a cousin visiting just last week, great guy.
[03:54:25.940 --> 03:54:34.940]  He was talking about one of his other brothers who's also a great guy who is paranoid and thinks that Amazon's Alexa is listening to him.
[03:54:34.940 --> 03:54:35.940]  I mean, that's in the news.
[03:54:35.940 --> 03:54:37.940]  And he knew full well what he was saying to me.
[03:54:37.940 --> 03:54:43.940]  It was more just of a, you know, I don't care and quit trying to, you know, warn me about things.
[03:54:43.940 --> 03:54:47.940]  And again, it's that attitude of millennials.
[03:54:47.940 --> 03:54:51.940]  It's that attitude of others of just a cynicalness like I just ignore it all.
[03:54:51.940 --> 03:54:56.940]  It doesn't matter that's destroying us because as we get more and more selfish about not caring,
[03:54:56.940 --> 03:54:59.940]  it allows crap like this to really screw people over.
[03:54:59.940 --> 03:55:01.940]  So again, this is a very serious issue.
[03:55:01.940 --> 03:55:05.940]  These are AI tentacles stretching out into all of our societies, all of our cultures,
[03:55:05.940 --> 03:55:10.940]  and it's being done to form giant predatory monopolies.
[03:55:10.940 --> 03:55:15.940]  And it's being done to totally surveil us and bring us into a system beyond 1984.
[03:55:15.940 --> 03:55:20.940]  I mean, if I came and knocked on your door and I said, I want to put cameras in your house
[03:55:20.940 --> 03:55:23.940]  and watch you were listening to you, you'd say, I'm going to punch you in the nose.
[03:55:23.940 --> 03:55:24.940]  And you'd be right to say that.
[03:55:24.940 --> 03:55:32.940]  But when a big predatory company puts out a product and advertises cyanide like its cherry pie,
[03:55:32.940 --> 03:55:37.940]  people just take the Trojan horses into their homes because it's how it's advertised.
[03:55:37.940 --> 03:55:42.940]  I think everybody should go read the story of the Trojan horse and what happened with the Greeks
[03:55:42.940 --> 03:55:48.940]  and their enemies because whether it's a fable or whether it really happened throughout society
[03:55:48.940 --> 03:55:52.940]  and throughout culture and throughout history, it continues to really, really happen.
[03:55:52.940 --> 03:55:56.940]  And if we don't stick up for ourselves and stand up against these predatory companies
[03:55:56.940 --> 03:56:00.940]  that want global monopolies, we are going to get what we deserve.
[03:56:08.940 --> 03:56:11.940]  This will be a day long remember.
[03:56:11.940 --> 03:56:13.940]  We've seen the end of the Clintons.
[03:56:13.940 --> 03:56:15.940]  We'll soon see the end of the globalists.
[03:56:15.940 --> 03:56:18.940]  Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.
[03:56:18.940 --> 03:56:20.940]  It's not true.
[03:56:21.940 --> 03:56:23.940]  That's impossible.
[03:56:23.940 --> 03:56:46.940]  Such a thing as you know it to be true.
[03:56:46.940 --> 03:56:49.940]  This is the heart of 1776.
[03:56:49.940 --> 03:56:51.940]  You're a white male.
[03:56:51.940 --> 03:56:56.940]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[03:56:56.940 --> 03:57:00.940]  Move it! Get out the way!
[03:57:00.940 --> 03:57:06.940]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[03:57:06.940 --> 03:57:11.940]  Info wars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[03:57:11.940 --> 03:57:14.940]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[03:57:14.940 --> 03:57:16.940]  I will not let you down.
[03:57:16.940 --> 03:57:20.940]  You'll be very, very impressed I hope and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[03:57:20.940 --> 03:57:22.940]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[03:57:22.940 --> 03:57:28.940]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States.
[03:57:28.940 --> 03:57:53.940]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones.
