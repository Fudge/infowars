[00:00.000 --> 00:25.480]  Welcome on this December the 23rd 2018. I'm David Knight, your host. Well we've had some
[00:25.480 --> 00:30.120]  updates, the big stories that started hitting at the end of the week and of course it's
[00:30.120 --> 00:35.000]  at this time of year that a lot of very important things can happen. You know it was 105 years
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.880]  ago on Friday as I covered on Friday that the Federal Reserve was created and now we
[00:39.880 --> 00:47.800]  have President Trump saying many reports that he wanted to fire the chair of the Fed. Now
[00:47.800 --> 00:53.000]  you've got Steve Mnuchin, the Goldman Sachs banker who's his Treasury Secretary coming
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.680]  back and saying no no no he didn't say anything like that. No no no we respect the Federal Reserve.
[00:57.320 --> 01:02.280]  They cannot be touched. Well they can and I'm going to tell you why. The President Trump is
[01:02.280 --> 01:10.040]  getting into some very important areas here. When he starts to do things like bring the troops home
[01:10.040 --> 01:16.200]  from an unconstitutional war that we should not be involved in. When he starts talking about
[01:16.200 --> 01:21.080]  the actions of the Fed and criticizing the Fed and talking about changing the Fed.
[01:21.080 --> 01:26.680]  It's starting to look a lot like JFK isn't it? Maybe that's why President Trump is also talking
[01:26.680 --> 01:31.240]  about the fact that we've got an armed citizenry and if they take him out coup or otherwise there
[01:31.240 --> 01:35.800]  will be a pushback against what they're doing. He certainly understands that he's in dangerous
[01:35.800 --> 01:42.360]  territory and we're going to talk about why he should move against the Fed. Should not wait
[01:42.920 --> 01:47.400]  how he might do it. As a matter of fact this is something that goes back to the very beginning
[01:47.400 --> 01:53.160]  of the Trump presidency right after he was elected. It was the middle of December then
[01:53.960 --> 02:01.160]  that you had then Chair Janet Yellen increase interest rates. Now the entire Obama administration
[02:01.720 --> 02:08.040]  they had only increased interest rates slightly and done it once. One interest rate the entire
[02:08.040 --> 02:15.000]  eight years of Obama and then right after President Trump was elected about six weeks later
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.560]  they raised interest rates a quarter and I said at the time and I said it for the entire week I
[02:21.560 --> 02:25.640]  said they're going to do the same thing that Greenspan did. Greenspan of course you remember
[02:25.640 --> 02:29.960]  he created the real estate and stock market bubble with the Federal Reserve by lowering
[02:29.960 --> 02:35.160]  interest rates and keeping them at essentially zero for a very long period of time and then he
[02:35.160 --> 02:40.600]  began raising interest rates one quarter of a percent every calendar quarter. It looks if you
[02:40.600 --> 02:46.200]  look at the chart of the Fed rates it looks like a little stair step case going straight up and then
[02:46.200 --> 02:50.040]  if that wasn't enough he started talking about irrational exuberance and of course he had some
[02:50.040 --> 02:55.640]  comments this last week talking about run for the exits. So they do everything they can to manipulate
[02:55.640 --> 02:59.480]  to undermine this economy and of course that has been the design of the Federal Reserve since its
[02:59.480 --> 03:06.840]  creation. It was designed to do that so I ran the report that I did it was 100 years 100 year
[03:06.840 --> 03:13.320]  anniversary of the creation of the Federal Reserve on a December the 21st and that's back in 1913 so
[03:13.320 --> 03:19.560]  I did the report five years ago it's now 105 years old. I tied it to the movie that came out 33 years
[03:19.560 --> 03:25.080]  later on December the 20th it's a wonderful life. We'll play that clip for you later in the broadcast
[03:25.080 --> 03:29.480]  but you can see how they engineered bank runs they did everything that they could they conspired
[03:29.480 --> 03:33.320]  with foreign bankers the same kind of foreign bankers who were putting the Bolsheviks in power
[03:33.320 --> 03:41.320]  in Germany. Warburg, Max Warburg in Germany and then his brother Paul Warburg was working with JP
[03:41.320 --> 03:48.360]  Morgan who is the classic whether they were trying to imitate this guy or if it was just subconscious
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.920]  who knows but clearly JP Morgan was the very imbibement of a monopolistic
[03:54.920 --> 04:02.360]  too rich for everyone's own good banker. He's the caricature that you see on monopoly money
[04:03.560 --> 04:09.160]  and so along with JP Morgan who is very much like the character Potter in the movie
[04:09.880 --> 04:13.800]  they engineered the Federal Reserve they did it on a Christmas when nobody was really paying
[04:13.800 --> 04:20.680]  any attention. Now we've had Mitch McConnell show his true colors by saying I'm not going to
[04:20.680 --> 04:26.280]  really do anything to try to get this to pass in the Senate. It did pass in the House thanks to the
[04:26.280 --> 04:31.080]  efforts of the House Freedom Caucus they firmed up President Trump on it they got it passed and
[04:31.080 --> 04:35.800]  then Mitch McConnell said we're not going to use the simple majority rule we're going to pretend
[04:35.800 --> 04:41.560]  I'm not going to go with the nuclear option it's a simple majority rule you want to pretend that
[04:41.560 --> 04:47.000]  you don't have that authority and he did and so he shut the government down but folks the Democrats
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.880]  are stonewalling and they're stonewalling for an open border they will do anything to avoid putting
[04:53.880 --> 05:00.440]  that little bit of money to protect the border. Stay with us very back. The globalists are trying
[05:00.440 --> 05:05.800]  to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law if there's any opposition
[05:05.800 --> 05:11.400]  if there's any independent media they can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes they can
[05:11.400 --> 05:17.800]  call BS if came over but if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and
[05:17.800 --> 05:22.040]  Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be
[05:22.040 --> 05:28.600]  targeted. There's only two groups in the U.S. Infowars and Matt Rudge of drudgereport.com
[05:29.320 --> 05:33.720]  that are truly independent and of course they're two of the dominant media forces in the world
[05:34.360 --> 05:39.960]  it really is amazing that's why as we close out 2018 I want to just remind the listeners of the
[05:39.960 --> 05:44.120]  amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together just remind you that you are the power
[05:44.120 --> 05:51.560]  you're the strength you're the will of info wars so please spread the links info wars.com news wars.com
[05:51.560 --> 05:55.480]  christenplata.com because if you don't spread the articles the video is no one else will
[05:56.040 --> 06:01.880]  we're all in each other's hands god bless you all and thank you from the front lines of the
[06:01.880 --> 06:18.920]  information war it's Alex Jones. I've been on the air 24 years but I've never covered a grouping
[06:18.920 --> 06:26.520]  of stories that together signify the biggest change not just to United States policy but to
[06:26.520 --> 06:32.920]  the entire direction of the world. This constellation of developments has the political
[06:32.920 --> 06:40.040]  establishment the corrupt globalists are shaking to their core but the underlying theme here is
[06:40.040 --> 06:48.200]  extreme change for the better but also with an extreme danger to our 45th president Donald
[06:48.200 --> 06:54.120]  John Trump. Now I'm going to cover some of the latest developments with the president and then
[06:54.120 --> 06:59.480]  I'm going to hit the big story and that of course is the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve
[06:59.480 --> 07:07.560]  established 104 years ago secretly at Jekyll Island Georgia. Ladies and gentlemen Trump has
[07:07.560 --> 07:12.040]  openly signaled that he's ready to fire the private head of the Federal Reserve and even
[07:12.040 --> 07:17.960]  reorganize it. Mainstream corporate media has said that he does have the power to do it but I have
[07:17.960 --> 07:22.600]  the Federal Reserve Act in front of me and I'm going to read to you from it but obviously if
[07:22.600 --> 07:28.360]  he appoints the head of the Fed he can remove the head of the Fed and we the people can abolish
[07:29.720 --> 07:36.040]  this fraudulent organization. But remember the last president that tried to abolish the Federal
[07:36.040 --> 07:42.840]  Reserve got riddled with bullets in Dallas, Texas, D. Lee Plaza. So let's run through
[07:42.840 --> 07:48.920]  why the establishment is so scared. Trump ran on removing troops from our longest war Afghanistan
[07:48.920 --> 07:54.360]  and against the Syrian war. Now we basically ended the conflict there that Obama helped start
[07:54.360 --> 07:59.720]  and the troops are being pulled out. Both political parties are now against him and the
[07:59.720 --> 08:04.760]  left have now become rabid pro-war zealots foaming at the mouth. The same people that used to show
[08:04.760 --> 08:11.320]  us death counts daily under the Bush era. Continuing, we have the bad trade deals being
[08:11.960 --> 08:18.680]  reversed. Millions of new jobs. The stock market had more than doubled until they sabotaged it.
[08:18.680 --> 08:24.280]  We've seen criminal justice reform where Hillary Clinton helped get laws passed with Bill
[08:24.280 --> 08:29.160]  tripling sentences for black people over white people and saying blacks are super predators
[08:29.160 --> 08:33.880]  they need to be brought to heel like ducks. Now that that's been signed and passed the
[08:33.880 --> 08:41.160]  president's getting no credit for it. He truly is. The liberator, ladies and gentlemen, sovereignty
[08:41.160 --> 08:47.480]  is back. Territorial integrity is back. He pulled us out of unelected globalist trade deals in
[08:47.480 --> 08:53.960]  circumventing Congress and the presidency and the people like TPP. The list goes on and on.
[08:54.600 --> 09:03.160]  But now let's move to why Trump is for real and why he's in grave danger.
[09:04.440 --> 09:10.440]  President Trump is moving against the private Federal Reserve. Hasn't been audited in his
[09:10.440 --> 09:15.800]  104 years but when it was founded it was confirmed that over 80 percent of it was basically European
[09:15.800 --> 09:23.720]  owned. So a private banking consortium has hoodwinked the public and the world into believing
[09:23.720 --> 09:29.560]  that it's above the law and no one can audit it and no one can question what it does. Well the
[09:29.560 --> 09:35.480]  other three branches of government are questionable and audible but it's not even a branch of government
[09:35.480 --> 09:40.520]  like federal ammunition or federal express. It's private and this is now all admitted
[09:40.520 --> 09:45.160]  and confirmed. A hundred years ago it was known but over time they brainwashed the public where
[09:45.160 --> 09:52.760]  the public didn't even understand this. Now because we've exposed it we can have a real
[09:52.760 --> 09:59.480]  debate about it. But first let's go to a short minute clip of Alan Greenspan 10 years ago
[09:59.480 --> 10:04.920]  during the subprime crisis that the private banks and engineered to consolidate control
[10:04.920 --> 10:11.000]  and get trillions in bailouts of themselves telling Laird NewsHour that Congress and the
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.400]  president and everyone else cannot even question or say anything that that the Federal Reserve is
[10:17.400 --> 10:24.920]  like God. What is the proper relationship? What should be the proper relationship between the
[10:24.920 --> 10:31.240]  chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States? Well first of all the Federal Reserve
[10:31.240 --> 10:40.040]  is an independent agency and that means basically that there is no other agency of government
[10:40.040 --> 10:49.880]  which can overrule actions that we take. So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that
[10:49.880 --> 10:56.360]  the administration or the Congress or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what
[10:56.360 --> 11:02.840]  we think is the appropriate thing then what the relationships are don't frankly matter and
[11:02.840 --> 11:11.800]  I've had very good relationships with presidents. Now I'm doing my best here to be calm but did
[11:11.800 --> 11:21.720]  you just hear the giant con game the giant Jedi mind trick that the former head of the Federal
[11:21.720 --> 11:27.800]  Reserve just put out there that no one can question them no one can investigate them no one can look
[11:27.800 --> 11:36.600]  into them they are completely above everything not just above the law but above investigation
[11:37.400 --> 11:47.400]  above scrutiny no one is above the law. Now let's look at the facts because CNN, MSNBC are saying
[11:47.400 --> 11:53.320]  Trump isn't allowed to even talk about firing the head of the private Federal Reserve but he is
[11:53.320 --> 11:59.880]  saying the Federal Reserve Act that I'll read to you in a moment but first Trump was right during
[11:59.880 --> 12:06.280]  the campaign and he was right again just a few months ago in the second campaign in the midterms
[12:07.160 --> 12:11.400]  he said if you want to plunge the stock market if you want the regulations back if you want to kill
[12:11.400 --> 12:17.080]  the recovery elected Democrats because that will signal that they're going to be able to overturn
[12:17.080 --> 12:22.680]  this revolution but he went on to say the Federal Reserve better not raise interest rates anymore
[12:22.680 --> 12:28.040]  they've already raised it seven times never did that under Obama he said if they do that
[12:28.040 --> 12:34.520]  it'll tank our economy the Federal Reserve is part of the OECD and the XM Bank in big international
[12:34.520 --> 12:41.240]  consortiums that basically rig interest rates around the world and other things hit some monopoly
[12:41.240 --> 12:47.960]  over currency just like OPEC's monopoly over oil and other petrochemicals and derivatives
[12:47.960 --> 12:56.680]  and OPEC has also at many levels been working with the same private Federal Reserve multinational
[12:56.680 --> 13:03.240]  consortium and these groups have agreed to let China have 10 growth rates forever and
[13:03.240 --> 13:09.960]  it gets worse zero percent interest rates so just remember why Trump is so angry we get higher
[13:09.960 --> 13:17.560]  interest rates China gets zero all of this is to make China the place to invest so here's this
[13:17.560 --> 13:23.160]  group that thinks it's above the law dictating to you what they're going to do they've not been
[13:23.160 --> 13:29.160]  audited or investigated over a hundred and four years here's an article out of Forbes how Trump
[13:29.160 --> 13:35.880]  could fire Powell and rebuild the Fed and then it says right here from the Federal Reserve Act of
[13:35.880 --> 13:42.840]  1913 thereafter each member shall hold office for a term of 14 years from the expiration of the
[13:42.840 --> 13:49.480]  term of his predecessor unless sooner removed by cause for the president so read that again
[13:50.600 --> 13:58.280]  unless sooner removed for cause by the president and the president decides with his executive
[13:58.280 --> 14:04.680]  power the cause back when Obama was president oh the left loved all the powers of the presidency
[14:04.680 --> 14:11.640]  but now that Trump's in there they claim that he can't even trim his toenails without permission
[14:11.640 --> 14:16.600]  for the bureaucracy they're saying oh it's some reckless move to pull out of Syria and to pull
[14:16.600 --> 14:22.760]  out of Afghanistan when he ran on that the truth is you have a political consortium that follows
[14:22.760 --> 14:28.360]  a global plan and presidents have just become ceremonial and now Trump is no longer being
[14:28.360 --> 14:33.880]  ceremonial he is being the president and whether you agree with him or disagree with him this is
[14:33.880 --> 14:37.560]  how the constitution works this is how this country is supposed to operate and that's why
[14:37.560 --> 14:42.520]  the people that have stolen and usurped our country's destiny are so unhappy because Trump
[14:42.520 --> 14:49.160]  is resting the wheel of state away from them these are the facts now David Knight's hosting live
[14:49.160 --> 14:55.960]  today so I'll take you back live to David Knight in studio hosting the Sunday show four to six p.m

[17:56.200 --> 18:03.000]  wars store.com info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing
[18:03.000 --> 18:08.680]  pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress
[18:08.680 --> 18:15.400]  symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function
[18:16.040 --> 18:22.040]  in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:22.040 --> 18:27.480]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published
[18:27.480 --> 18:33.720]  trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that
[18:33.720 --> 18:39.560]  helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[18:39.560 --> 18:44.920]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity
[18:44.920 --> 18:50.680]  of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body
[18:50.680 --> 18:56.760]  go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen
[18:56.760 --> 19:02.280]  block chewable tablets the globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government
[19:02.280 --> 19:08.760]  that's above the law if there's any opposition if there's any independent media they can call
[19:08.760 --> 19:14.520]  the fact that the emperor has no clothes they can call bs it's game over but if you look at
[19:14.520 --> 19:19.000]  everybody else like michael savage and russia lembaugh and tucker carlson and shon hannity
[19:19.000 --> 19:25.000]  they are all beholded to the networks they're on they can be targeted there's only two groups in
[19:25.000 --> 19:31.640]  the us info wars and matt rudge of rudge report.com that are truly independent and of course they're
[19:31.640 --> 19:38.200]  two of the dominant media forces in the world it really is amazing that's why as we close out 2018
[19:38.200 --> 19:41.560]  i want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come
[19:41.560 --> 19:47.080]  together just remind you that you are the power you're the strength you're the will of info wars
[19:47.800 --> 19:53.080]  so please spread the links info wars.com news wars.com prism planet.com because if you don't
[19:53.080 --> 19:57.880]  spread the articles the videos no one else will we're all in each other's hands god bless you all
[19:57.880 --> 20:04.600]  thank you you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:08.440 --> 20:16.840]  when the war was over why there were jobs galore for the gi josephs who were in the war
[20:16.840 --> 20:27.000]  but for generals things were not so grand and it's not so hard to understand
[20:29.960 --> 20:38.040]  what can you do with a general when he stops being a general oh what can you do with a general
[20:38.040 --> 20:44.760]  who retired or maybe he was fired we're trying to figure out whether this return was fired right
[20:44.760 --> 20:50.120]  and this is that washington ablaze go ahead and take that down of course that's from white
[20:50.120 --> 20:57.480]  christmas that movie you may remember was about global warming that's right maybe you know madis
[20:57.480 --> 21:02.200]  can retire and buy an inn in vermont or something but then of course you know we have that global
[21:02.200 --> 21:06.440]  warming but then that was happening back then they weren't silly enough back in the days of
[21:06.440 --> 21:14.360]  Irving berlin to blame weather on mankind but we are today and so that whole movie as you remember
[21:14.360 --> 21:20.840]  was about a snow drought that they were having up there and they organized a a charity event
[21:21.720 --> 21:25.400]  try to get everybody to support the general who apparently doesn't have the kind of golden
[21:25.400 --> 21:31.880]  parachute uh pension plans that modern day generals do those generals were real generals
[21:31.880 --> 21:36.520]  these guys are politicians and they are lifetime bureaucrats they have a massive
[21:36.520 --> 21:41.320]  pension but of course you can always have more right just like rocker felder said
[21:41.320 --> 21:46.840]  it's always a little bit more you never kind of get enough but when we look at what happened
[21:48.520 --> 21:55.080]  over the weekend i talked about james madis his manifesto i they call it a resignation letter
[21:55.080 --> 22:00.840]  i call it a globalist manifesto and i'll tell you why in just a moment but president trump
[22:00.840 --> 22:05.960]  had enough and so he tweeted out today uh that he's got somebody that's going to be starting
[22:05.960 --> 22:11.480]  effective january the first in other words he's not going to wait for the 60 to 90 days
[22:11.480 --> 22:16.040]  that madis said he was going to hang around to make sure that of course that we had an adult in the
[22:16.040 --> 22:23.800]  room and as one of the reports looking at madis said this is a guy i mean look at the fact that
[22:24.600 --> 22:30.360]  you know they call him mad dog madis and he bragged about how he wanted to have a plan for
[22:30.360 --> 22:36.680]  to kill everybody in the room he's the adult in the room you can't make this stuff up
[22:37.720 --> 22:42.120]  pretty pretty amazing what we have here and of course if we go back and look at his resignation
[22:42.120 --> 22:48.680]  letter he's saying things like his core belief is that our strength as a nation is inextricably
[22:48.680 --> 22:54.440]  linked to the strength of our system of alliances and partnerships well you know what that is exactly
[22:54.440 --> 23:01.320]  the opposite of what america is about it is enough to make the founders of america spend
[23:01.320 --> 23:06.440]  in their graves washington said in his farewell address to avoid entangling alliances for this
[23:06.440 --> 23:16.120]  very reason and yet he thinks that's our core strength and he goes on to say that um we have
[23:16.120 --> 23:21.640]  to do everything possible to advance an international order no that is not your job all of these people
[23:21.640 --> 23:30.200]  who say that they can't spend a a little tiny sliver of the budget to defend our country
[23:30.200 --> 23:36.680]  our adamant that we have to defend these alliances because see their loyalty is to these international
[23:36.680 --> 23:41.320]  alliances and to the military industrial complex not to america that's the bottom line folks that
[23:41.320 --> 23:47.640]  you need to understand it's great that president trump is finally moving against these people as
[23:47.640 --> 23:56.120]  one individual matt purple said and the american conservatives said uh vladimir putin is being
[23:56.120 --> 24:02.440]  given credit for all of this stuff no it's actually president trump one headline said
[24:02.440 --> 24:08.360]  somehow he got a double shot of political viagra and realized that he's got a lot of power that
[24:08.360 --> 24:16.440]  he can use and he's going straight at the centers of power but as matt purple said vladimir putin
[24:16.440 --> 24:20.680]  must be a wily one think about all that he's managed to accomplish over the last 24 hours
[24:20.680 --> 24:25.640]  according to the geopolitical wizards on twitter at putin's behest president trump on wednesday
[24:25.640 --> 24:30.040]  announced a withdrawal of american troops from syria that's now cleared the path for russia to
[24:30.040 --> 24:34.760]  exert control over demascus the middle east indeed the world itself because moscow has at last
[24:35.400 --> 24:41.480]  secured the jewel in its neo conservative uh i should say neo-soviet empire we're the ones with
[24:41.480 --> 24:49.320]  neo conservative empire a strip of chaotic desert in northeast syria yeah it's uh it's pretty silly
[24:49.320 --> 24:55.080]  when we look at this and of course uh ram paul pointed out that we have these armchair generals
[24:56.040 --> 24:59.400]  and you know what are we going to do with them i think we should show them the door
[25:00.120 --> 25:05.240]  just like president trump did but ram paul said this about the armchair generals who want to keep
[25:05.240 --> 25:11.800]  us at war forever video clip for it was never the mission the mission was to wipe out ices and we
[25:11.800 --> 25:17.480]  did succeed and the thing is it's incredibly bold to win a war and come home that's what the people
[25:17.480 --> 25:23.880]  want if you poll the american people it's 60 to 70 percent of people are ready to get out of afghanistan
[25:23.880 --> 25:29.080]  and i'll bet you the same as syria if you ask the people it's only the people in washington the armchair
[25:29.080 --> 25:34.280]  generals that want to keep us at war forever and people americans are tired of it we want that money
[25:34.280 --> 25:41.000]  here at home and we want to create jobs roads bridges here at home not in afghanistan that's
[25:41.000 --> 25:44.760]  absolutely right and so president trump tweeted out this afternoon that starting january the first
[25:45.320 --> 25:51.800]  madis is going to be gone we don't need somebody whose loyalty is to an international system of
[25:51.800 --> 25:57.640]  alliances and not to the american people he goes on to say in his resignation letter madis said the
[25:57.640 --> 26:03.960]  us i agree with you as i've said from the beginning uh the armed forces of the us should not be the
[26:03.960 --> 26:09.800]  policeman of the world but then he goes on to talk about nato and his 29 democracies but wait a
[26:09.800 --> 26:16.120]  minute um who provides virtually all of nato's troops equipment and funding uh that would be
[26:16.840 --> 26:23.240]  the policeman of the world the us and then he talked about the defeat ices coalition of 74 nations
[26:23.240 --> 26:29.560]  which frankly i wasn't aware that it even existed but there was a bureaucrat who was making a lot
[26:29.560 --> 26:37.080]  of money out of that coalition and his job there and he also came out against uh president trump
[26:37.080 --> 26:45.720]  that's uh uh megherk and uh brett megherk was the envoy to that coalition that very effective
[26:45.720 --> 26:51.560]  coalition and he abruptly resigned you know 74 nations who knew i didn't know anything about that
[26:52.200 --> 26:59.400]  but he was also interestingly enough the guy who made the announcement that really ticked me in
[26:59.400 --> 27:03.560]  a lot of people off and i talked about it and i said is this really what the trump administration
[27:03.560 --> 27:08.600]  is about well fortunately it isn't but he got up there and said uh we have determined that we are
[27:08.600 --> 27:16.200]  going to be in syria for an indeterminate amount of time and i said are you kidding me we're gonna
[27:16.200 --> 27:20.920]  have another forever war you'd had the mainstream media like the washington post in the new york
[27:20.920 --> 27:28.040]  times releasing the week before that we had uh troops that controlled one third of syria
[27:28.040 --> 27:32.360]  an area about the size of louisiana that they were going to stay there he said he holds a press
[27:32.360 --> 27:38.840]  conference brett megherk and said we're going to be there for indefinitely and uh president trump
[27:38.840 --> 27:46.360]  had something to say about that and if we go back and we look at how this all began going back to
[27:47.480 --> 27:52.760]  the daily caller said if we go back a couple of weeks december the 14th there was a phone call
[27:52.760 --> 28:00.120]  between president trump and the turkish president erdogan and you had john bolton standing uh
[28:00.120 --> 28:06.840]  sitting there in the white house and so it's supposed to be a call for president trump
[28:07.400 --> 28:15.720]  to warn erdogan to back off back off our kurdish rebels but the president of turkey asked trump
[28:15.720 --> 28:20.360]  why are you even still in syria you know you got a third of the country there why are you even there
[28:20.360 --> 28:28.760]  uh isis has been 99 defeated and then president trump went off script and he asked bolton according
[28:28.760 --> 28:33.320]  to nbc news with erdogan on the line trump asked national security advisor john bolton who was
[28:33.320 --> 28:39.080]  listening in why american troops remained in syria if what the president of turkey said was true
[28:39.080 --> 28:43.880]  according to officials erdogan's point bolton was forced to admit uh and had been backed up by
[28:43.880 --> 28:49.080]  mattis pompeo us special envoy for syria jim jeffrey and brett megherk they all said yeah
[28:49.080 --> 28:55.160]  they've only got one percent in other words they've been beaten they've been beaten and russia
[28:55.160 --> 28:59.080]  has almost completely stopped his flight so we'll be right back stay with us we're bringing back one

[33:20.440 --> 33:31.000]  host david night welcome back you know one of the things that amazes me is how many conservatives
[33:31.000 --> 33:36.360]  are and people i would typically not think about uh being neocons maybe i have to rethink that
[33:38.040 --> 33:44.600]  they're starting with mattis and as daily caller pointed out it was a conference call going back
[33:44.600 --> 33:49.960]  to december the 14th where president trump was talking to the president of turkey and he was
[33:49.960 --> 33:55.080]  supposed to be telling him to back off for the neocons instead uh as they were talking
[33:55.080 --> 34:01.800]  erdogan said why are you still there uh isis is down to just one percent of what it was before
[34:01.800 --> 34:08.360]  the 99% gone and president trump turned to john bolton and said is that true and he said uh yeah
[34:09.560 --> 34:18.600]  and as i've reported uh in the morning show uh that we have uh here begins at nine a.m eastern
[34:18.600 --> 34:24.040]  time monday through friday uh as i was talking about it russia had cut down their flights by 99%
[34:24.040 --> 34:33.160]  weeks ago they had been running between 100 and 110 flights a day between 100 to 110 flights
[34:33.160 --> 34:39.480]  per day and they cut it down to one to two flights per week that's way more than 99%
[34:41.080 --> 34:47.240]  so i think erdogan was uh being conservative when he said that and so uh president trump
[34:47.240 --> 34:53.160]  turned to bolton said is that true and said uh yeah yeah that's true mattis knows it
[34:53.160 --> 34:59.400]  pompeo knows it uh brett megerk this other guy who just quit knows it and so they spent uh the
[34:59.400 --> 35:06.040]  following week unsuccessfully trying to turn trump around as a matter of fact this other guy who
[35:06.040 --> 35:12.120]  resigned brett megerk was the one who had the press conference and said we're going to be there
[35:12.760 --> 35:19.320]  for an indefinite period of time and that was i think an effort to intimidate president trump
[35:19.320 --> 35:25.640]  to make him look bad in case uh president trump went ahead with that policy uh this is the way
[35:25.640 --> 35:30.120]  the deep state establishment protects itself they hold press conferences just like you've seen
[35:30.840 --> 35:35.160]  rozenstein holding a press conference as president trump is going off to meet the president of russia
[35:35.160 --> 35:38.920]  uh so we we don't want to have detente remember detente used to be a good thing detente used to
[35:38.920 --> 35:43.000]  be the easing of strain relations now they want to do everything they can to strain relations
[35:43.560 --> 35:47.480]  if that means that they can attack president trump or make him try to make him look bad
[35:47.480 --> 35:51.800]  and so that's what rozenstein did with his phony indictments that he released as president trump
[35:51.800 --> 35:56.840]  was flying to a summit meeting and so that's i think what brett megerk did now steve miller got on
[35:56.840 --> 36:01.800]  thursday night and he had this to say one foreign policy blunder after another in iraq afghanistan
[36:01.800 --> 36:05.720]  and libya has not worked out for our national interests and let's talk about syria let's talk
[36:05.720 --> 36:13.480]  about the fact that isis is the enemy of russia isis is the enemy of Assad in syria isis is the
[36:13.480 --> 36:18.280]  enemy of turkey are we supposed to stay in syria for generation after generation spilling american
[36:18.280 --> 36:23.320]  blood to fight the enemies of all those countries wolf and he's talking to wolf blitzer on cnn when
[36:23.320 --> 36:29.800]  did the american people sign up to be in every war in every place in every side of every conflict
[36:29.800 --> 36:35.560]  all over planet earth well i guess that goes back to general madis's retirement things as our strength
[36:35.560 --> 36:41.160]  is a nation is linked to our systems of alliances and partnerships where we have foreign entangling
[36:41.160 --> 36:44.920]  alliances that get us involved in every single conflict now you think about the fact as he pointed
[36:44.920 --> 36:52.680]  out that uh russia and turkey and syria are all fighting isis and uh but we got to stay there
[36:52.680 --> 37:00.520]  even though they're 99 defeated and then of course uh the uh mission creep became that this was about
[37:00.520 --> 37:07.400]  iran and yet iran is the enemy of israel the enemy of saudi arabia uh for certain and uh if you go
[37:07.400 --> 37:11.400]  into this of course they're going to be enemies with turkey as well because turkey doesn't subscribe
[37:11.400 --> 37:15.560]  to the same brand of islam that they have so all these people are going to be fighting iran as well
[37:17.240 --> 37:21.080]  president reagan was right when he pulled us out of beirut after that bombing he said this place is
[37:21.080 --> 37:24.440]  crazy they're always they've always been fighting each other they're going to continue to fight each
[37:24.440 --> 37:29.080]  other we don't need to be here except that you have people like hillary clinton who is now
[37:29.080 --> 37:38.040]  uh lecturing trump about empowering isis after he wants to get rid of a uh forever war remember back
[37:38.040 --> 37:45.240]  in 2013 when ran paul asked her uh i said you know quite frankly i'm glad that you took responsibility
[37:45.240 --> 37:51.240]  for this uh because i would have fired you if i was president and then she goes on to dump
[37:51.240 --> 37:56.520]  responsibility on uh away from herself she dumps it on her number two for the number two on down
[37:56.520 --> 38:02.280]  it's their fault she said but ran paul also asked her about weapons that were being supplied to turkey
[38:04.040 --> 38:13.400]  some of those weapons were being sent to forces in syria and um because urdogan was using isis
[38:13.400 --> 38:20.360]  at the time just like we were using isis to try to achieve regime change and she said she had the
[38:20.360 --> 38:25.240]  audacity to say in that hearing well uh if you want to know about arms being shipped out of
[38:25.240 --> 38:30.440]  Benghazi to terrorists you'll have to talk to the agency that was running the annex so who was
[38:30.440 --> 38:36.120]  running the annex that would be the cia but hillary clinton isn't going to say you got to ask the cia
[38:36.120 --> 38:41.720]  she's clever enough devious and clever enough to say ask the agency that was running the annex
[38:43.560 --> 38:49.400]  and uh when we look at what was happening and the roundup to this i played on uh friday i played
[38:49.400 --> 38:56.200]  john mccain's clip where he said hillary and the national security team wanted to arm isis and obama
[38:56.200 --> 39:02.840]  said no and then mccain said he's weak of course mccain was meeting with a terrorist hillary wanted
[39:02.840 --> 39:09.960]  to arm isis the question is did they disobey obama or did obama change his mind was he
[39:09.960 --> 39:15.960]  in on it or whatever because they did they did arm them and we had michael flinn uh back in 2015
[39:15.960 --> 39:24.040]  saying it was a willful decision to arm isis i mean mccain is admitting it everybody knows
[39:24.040 --> 39:29.960]  that they were arming isis and now they want to say that president trump is helping isis when
[39:29.960 --> 39:36.600]  they are 99 defeated and so this guy brett megirk who is the one that came out to try to throw
[39:36.600 --> 39:40.280]  president trump under the bus try to put him in a difficult place where he couldn't pull out
[39:40.280 --> 39:46.040]  but trump did it anyway uh he has now left as well and so the establishment is freaking out about
[39:46.040 --> 39:52.920]  this i think it's very very good news uh the person that's going to replace mattis is the number
[39:52.920 --> 39:59.000]  two guy there uh patrick shanahan now he is a defense contractor from bowing he's part of
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.720]  the military industrial complex i don't expect him to be somebody who is on the side of us
[40:03.720 --> 40:08.920]  defending america you know every time it comes to protecting our borders what do we hear we hear
[40:08.920 --> 40:15.640]  well uh that's not a threat all these entanglements that we've got abroad those are the real threats
[40:15.640 --> 40:19.240]  there's no legal authority to do this you don't want to go back to syria they built a dozen
[40:20.040 --> 40:24.600]  military bases in syria you know they're occupying a third of the country the u.s military built a
[40:24.600 --> 40:28.440]  dozen military bases did you know that they're doing that with your money did you know that
[40:28.440 --> 40:37.080]  they also built four air bases there now who approved that money where did that money come from
[40:37.080 --> 40:42.520]  here we talk about five billion dollars for the wall and we can't come up with that uh back in
[40:42.520 --> 40:46.920]  the 1960s i think it was it was uh everett dirksen he was a republican that was when
[40:46.920 --> 40:50.040]  they had republicans coming from illinois and i'm not talking about going all the way back to
[40:50.040 --> 40:55.640]  abram lincoln but it's probably pretty close but uh he said you know a million dollars here
[40:55.640 --> 40:59.320]  and a million dollars there pretty soon you're talking about real money well today we just throw
[40:59.320 --> 41:03.800]  around billions of dollars like their pennies because we've got a four trillion dollar expenditure
[41:03.800 --> 41:11.480]  budget that we have and yet the five billion dollars which is chump change folks it's not it's
[41:11.480 --> 41:19.560]  one eighth of a penny of what we spend uh one eighth of one percent and they can't find the
[41:19.560 --> 41:23.320]  money for that because they don't want our borders protected so they say we can't find the money for
[41:23.320 --> 41:27.560]  it there's no authority for it there isn't any risk and on and on they're lecturing president
[41:27.560 --> 41:32.200]  trump you got jimacosta getting in his face saying they're not coming here they'll dissipate
[41:32.200 --> 41:35.560]  and there's nothing to be afraid of and yet we have more than a caravan coming across
[41:36.680 --> 41:41.720]  that are intercepted each week that's not counting the people who get into this country
[41:41.720 --> 41:47.160]  illegally those are just the people that are caught by border patrol that's more than a caravan
[41:47.160 --> 41:55.720]  a week is caught uh this is an existential issue folks so are the foreign wars that go forever
[41:55.720 --> 42:02.120]  that is also an existential issue and the federal reserve is an existential issue i'm going to play
[42:02.120 --> 42:06.600]  uh that report for you coming up again it's the it's a wonderful lie talking about the creation
[42:06.600 --> 42:11.080]  of the federal reserve talking about how many senators at the time said that's going to give
[42:11.080 --> 42:17.240]  them the power to create boom and bust cycles and of course we had ben bernicke the former
[42:17.240 --> 42:22.200]  chair of the fed say yeah we caused a great depression sorry about that we won't do it again

[47:05.160 --> 47:22.440]  welcome back this last week we saw the 72nd anniversary of this a wonderful life
[47:22.440 --> 47:27.240]  and the 105th anniversary of the federal reserve created on december the 21st
[47:27.240 --> 47:34.040]  2000 uh 1913 and i did a report in 2013 called it's a wonderful lie talking about how we were
[47:34.040 --> 47:38.120]  manipulated into having a federal reserve you know everybody's asking can president trump
[47:38.120 --> 47:43.560]  fire the fed chairman we need to be asking the question why we even have a fed chairman and
[47:43.560 --> 47:48.440]  charge of our economy and what they have been doing to us we'll talk a little bit more about
[47:48.440 --> 47:53.560]  that coming up but i want to play for you it's a wonderful lie has done on the 100th anniversary
[47:53.560 --> 48:00.760]  of the creation of the federal reserve surreptitiously on that christmas over the last 100 years the
[48:00.760 --> 48:05.800]  federal reserve has created bubbles and burst them enslaved us with debt and destroyed our
[48:05.800 --> 48:12.680]  purchasing power through inflation yes it's been a wonderful lie for the bankers there are striking
[48:12.680 --> 48:17.880]  parallels and frank kappa is it's a wonderful life to the lies and tricks that real bankers used
[48:17.880 --> 48:23.160]  to create the federal reserve human nature doesn't change and the greedy elite of 1913
[48:23.160 --> 48:29.800]  in 2013 look and act a lot like potter the banker in the movie and many americans are
[48:29.800 --> 48:35.240]  left like george bailey staring into the abyss as their dreams collapse and they face financial
[48:35.240 --> 48:39.880]  ruin do we live in a country that looks a lot more like pottersville than bedford falls what does
[48:39.880 --> 48:45.400]  frank kappa's film show us about how we got here and how we can get out when the federal reserve
[48:45.400 --> 48:50.360]  was created two days before christmas a hundred years ago it was a culmination of six years of
[48:50.360 --> 48:56.200]  fraud fear and manipulation i've never really seen one but that's got all the air marks of being a run
[48:56.200 --> 49:03.080]  the panic of 1907 was used to shape public support for the fed the panic was triggered by rumors that
[49:03.080 --> 49:08.040]  two major banks were about to become insolvent just as we see in the movie george there is a
[49:08.040 --> 49:15.160]  rumor around town that you've closed your doors is that true i am going all out to help in this
[49:15.160 --> 49:22.840]  crisis i have just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs they will close up for
[49:22.840 --> 49:31.640]  a week and then reopen just took over the bank i may lose a fortune but i am willing to guarantee
[49:31.640 --> 49:38.040]  your people too just tell them to bring their shares over here and i will pay 50 cents on the
[49:38.040 --> 49:44.040]  dollar oh you never miss a trick do you potter unfortunately jp morgan got away with a deception
[49:44.040 --> 49:49.720]  and was able to shut down competitors and snapped up assets at fire cell prices uh take during the
[49:49.720 --> 49:55.800]  depression for instance you and i were the only ones that kept our heads you saved the building
[49:55.800 --> 50:02.840]  in law i saved all the rest yes well most people say you stole all the rest the envious ones say
[50:02.840 --> 50:07.880]  that george the suckers charles lemburg senior warned people at the time of the creation of the
[50:07.880 --> 50:12.520]  federal reserve that it would not stop booming by cycles but would actually create them in order to
[50:12.520 --> 50:18.040]  benefit its private owners here's what he said the cause high prices all the federal reserve board
[50:18.040 --> 50:23.160]  will do will be to lower the re-discount rate producing an expansion of credit and a rising
[50:23.160 --> 50:27.640]  stock market then when businessmen are adjusted to these conditions it can check prosperity in
[50:27.640 --> 50:32.200]  mid-career by arbitrarily raising the rate of interest they can cause a pendulum of rising
[50:32.200 --> 50:37.240]  and falling market to swing gently back and forth or cause violent fluctuations by greater rate
[50:37.240 --> 50:43.160]  variation in an either case it will possess inside information as to the financial conditions and
[50:43.160 --> 50:48.680]  advanced knowledge of the coming change either up or down this is the strangest most dangerous
[50:48.680 --> 50:53.160]  advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privileged class by any government that ever
[50:53.160 --> 50:58.600]  existed the system is private conducted for the sole purpose of a painting the greatest possible
[50:58.600 --> 51:03.080]  profits from the use of other people's money they know in advance when to create panics to their
[51:03.080 --> 51:09.160]  advantage and they know when to stop panic inflation and deflation work equally well for them when
[51:09.160 --> 51:15.480]  they control the finance as we see in the movie not all lending institutions have the same motivations
[51:16.360 --> 51:23.080]  now you take this loan here the attorney bishop you know that fellow that sits around all day on
[51:23.080 --> 51:30.680]  his brain in his taxi you know I happen to know the bank turned down this loan but he comes here
[51:30.680 --> 51:39.480]  and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars why well I handled that Mr. Potter you
[51:39.480 --> 51:43.960]  have all the papers there is salary insurance I can personally vouch for his character friend of
[51:43.960 --> 51:51.320]  you yes you see if you shoot pool with some employee here you can come and borrow money
[51:52.520 --> 52:00.120]  what does that get us a discontented lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class as a former
[52:00.120 --> 52:04.920]  fdic chair said all too often the large banks use their models and their algorithms and if you
[52:04.920 --> 52:09.880]  don't fit in their boxes you don't get the loan and Dodd Frank legislation is tying the hands of
[52:09.880 --> 52:14.520]  small lenders shutting out buyers and shutting down lenders today there are fewer lenders than at
[52:14.520 --> 52:21.480]  any time the government has kept records 10 000 banks disappeared between 1984 and 2011 this town
[52:21.480 --> 52:26.360]  needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without
[52:26.360 --> 52:32.600]  crawling to Potter and the movie George gets to see what happens to the small town if Potter didn't
[52:32.600 --> 52:37.560]  have competition from credit unions and smaller lenders if it hadn't been for you yeah if it
[52:37.560 --> 52:42.760]  hadn't been for me everybody'd be a lot better off my wife and my kids and my friends I mean look
[52:42.760 --> 52:47.960]  little fella why you go up and haunt somebody else yeah so you still think killing yourself would
[52:47.960 --> 52:56.760]  make everyone feel happier right oh I don't know I guess you're right it's both been better if I'd
[52:56.760 --> 53:02.840]  never been born at all Potter'sville the only businesses thriving are vice people are angry
[53:02.840 --> 53:08.280]  the town is filled with signs like keep moving keep off the grass Bert the cop actually shoots at
[53:08.280 --> 53:20.360]  George when he's running away and is no threat to anyone everyone is a renter no one has a stake
[53:20.920 --> 53:25.320]  are you or any bishop and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid look but what's the idea I
[53:25.320 --> 53:29.000]  live in a shack in pottersfield my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid and I
[53:29.000 --> 53:34.600]  never seen you before in my life see private property and everyone having a stake is the antidote
[53:34.600 --> 53:39.400]  to pottersville here you're all businessmen here go to make them better citizens doesn't make them
[53:39.400 --> 53:44.760]  better customers but whether it's the trans-pacific partnership or a global carbon tax the global
[53:44.760 --> 53:50.920]  elite don't see you as a stakeholder they want to turn us all into serfs and treat us like cattle
[53:50.920 --> 53:55.480]  just remember this mr. Potter that this rabble you're talking about they do most of the working
[53:55.480 --> 54:00.200]  and paying and living and dying in this community well is it too much to have them work and pay and
[54:00.200 --> 54:06.280]  live and die in a couple of decent rooms in a bath anyway my father didn't think so people were human
[54:06.280 --> 54:12.280]  beings to him but to you a warped frustrated old man their cattle well in my book he died a much
[54:12.280 --> 54:17.240]  richer man than you will ever be I'm not interested in your book I'm talking about the building and

[55:07.320 --> 55:13.000]  saved a lot of his $20,000 salary would it have bought much a couple of decades later by even the
[55:13.000 --> 55:18.520]  government's very conservative estimate of inflation the dollar has lost 90% of its value
[55:18.520 --> 55:24.040]  since 1947 when the movie was made the Fed's deliberate inflation is devastating to anyone
[55:24.040 --> 55:29.320]  trying to accumulate wealth through hard work and saving so what is the answer to all the George

[56:18.520 --> 56:24.200]  huge step to breaking the chains and enslave all of us but ultimately it is God to change his minds
[56:24.200 --> 56:30.920]  and change his heart God hates oppression and we can and should confidently pray that he will stop it

[1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:20.760]  welcome back in this hour we're going to talk about why president trump actually can and must
[1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:25.800]  do something to move against the federal reserve whether firing the chairman is the right move or
[1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:32.520]  not certainly he has cause to fire him when you look at what was done this last week and
[1:00:32.520 --> 1:00:38.280]  i reported before they announced that they were going to raise interest rates we had one economist
[1:00:38.280 --> 1:00:42.280]  say and he's not the only one who said but i like the way that he put it he said if they raise
[1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:51.160]  interest rates they ought to all be fired for malpractice and and that's exactly what it means
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:56.600]  to fire somebody for cause and we're going to talk a little bit of in detail about what that clause
[1:00:57.320 --> 1:01:03.560]  about firing for cause actually means in the federal reserve act that was surreptitiously
[1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:09.720]  enacted late at christmas as most of the people had gone home now we have a lot of action that is
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:18.680]  taking place in washington and yet i want to give you before we get back into that some christmas
[1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:25.720]  update news you know we have michael more i saw this today he has now put a christmas tree topper
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:33.240]  on his christmas tree this year and he's not going to honor anything that is christian he's
[1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:39.640]  going to honor ruth vader ginsberg or as i call her darth vader ginsberg she's had yet another
[1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:48.040]  cancer scare but he says that his christmas tree topper this year is better than an angel
[1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:56.760]  or a star over bethlehem it is this supreme court justice this authoritarian and i i said you know
[1:01:57.560 --> 1:02:01.160]  do you remember when i tweeted this out on liberty tarry if you want to follow me on twitter
[1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:06.200]  that's my handle liberty tarry and not libertarian but liberty tarry and i say remember obama's very
[1:02:06.200 --> 1:02:12.120]  first white house christmas everybody's freaking out about malania trump having red artificial
[1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:18.680]  christmas trees or whatever as a style choice but they were bending over backwards to defend
[1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:26.440]  president obama and his very first christmas december 2009 when he had ornaments that celebrated
[1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:34.280]  mal and transgenders and of course what they did was they picked a guy who was already a
[1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:41.560]  controversial figure he would he was a creative director of barnes new york and he had things
[1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:47.000]  that he'd put up for displays things like a christmas window display of margaret thatcher
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:53.560]  as a dowdy dominatrix dan quail as ventriloquist dummy and so forth so who would you go to to
[1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:58.360]  do your christmas decorations but somebody like that and what he came up with was mal christmas
[1:02:58.360 --> 1:03:04.360]  decorations remember the pictures that they had i think they've been taken down now but also he put
[1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:11.640]  up a ornament of a legendary transvestite and just you know we're not supposed to be concerned
[1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:15.880]  about that and so i said you know we look at this and you look at michael more you know it was okay
[1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:24.520]  to celebrate mal on christmas it's okay to celebrate that other marxist who has stood tirelessly to
[1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:29.640]  kill as many babies as possible as we celebrate the nativity you can put somebody up there who
[1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:36.280]  has presided over the murder of children uh and i said you can't find three wise men or women for
[1:03:36.280 --> 1:03:42.520]  that matter in the entire democrat party and this also tells you what their religion is doesn't it
[1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:50.920]  you know their religion is to worship government i also said uh in china you've got president
[1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:56.840]  she who demands that is inside a church building if they put up a crucifix he demands that there
[1:03:56.840 --> 1:04:02.040]  be a picture of mal well obama would be proud right you take it from obama's christmas tree
[1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:08.040]  no you have a crucifix in your chinese church you have to have on one side a portrait of mal and on
[1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:15.160]  the other side a portrait of president she but here the useful idiots like michael more worship
[1:04:15.160 --> 1:04:20.760]  government voluntarily they worship these authoritarians voluntarily uh you know we had
[1:04:20.760 --> 1:04:28.360]  the first ever arctic bank robbery they put out and i thought is this um is this climate change
[1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:32.760]  are they talking about a snow bank i didn't know they had banks in the arctic actually this is uh
[1:04:33.560 --> 1:04:40.280]  between scandinavia and the north pole uh they had an armed robbery there i don't know if it's uh
[1:04:40.920 --> 1:04:45.400]  if they're taking away our our climate or uh they're taking away the cash maybe that's where
[1:04:45.400 --> 1:04:49.960]  santa claus keeps his cash right there at that bank close to the north pole or maybe he's gone
[1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:53.960]  to crypto i don't know if he's gone to crypto we may not even have a christmas this year
[1:04:53.960 --> 1:04:59.400]  all right we'll be right back i'm david nice the globalists are trying to set up a private
[1:04:59.400 --> 1:05:04.760]  corporate world government that's above the law if there's any opposition or there's any independent
[1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:11.000]  media they can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes they can call bs if came over
[1:05:12.120 --> 1:05:16.520]  but if you look at everybody else like michael savage and rush limbaugh and tugger carlson
[1:05:16.520 --> 1:05:21.480]  and sean hannity they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted there's
[1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:28.440]  only two groups in the us info wars and matt rudge of drudge report dot com that are truly independent
[1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:34.040]  and of course they're two of the dominant media forces in the world it really is amazing that's
[1:05:34.040 --> 1:05:39.080]  why is we close out 2018 i want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and
[1:05:39.080 --> 1:05:43.240]  how far we've come together just remind you that you are the power you're the strength or the will
[1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:50.200]  of info wars so please spread the links info wars dot com news wars dot com prison planet dot
[1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:54.600]  com because if you don't spread the articles in the videos no one else will we're all in each
[1:05:54.600 --> 1:06:09.080]  other's hands god bless you all and thank you live from the info wars dot com studios you're
[1:06:09.080 --> 1:06:14.680]  listening to the alex joe show and now your host david night
[1:06:20.280 --> 1:06:24.600]  welcome back you know we have michael moore putting ruth vader ginsberg darth vader ginsberg up on
[1:06:24.600 --> 1:06:29.320]  the top of his christmas tree to honor her better than any angel anything that has to do with christianity
[1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:36.360]  of course right uh maybe you just put uh get the mal decorations that are left over from the obama
[1:06:36.360 --> 1:06:42.520]  administration uh from their christmas tree but uh we have in scotland something that i think is
[1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:48.840]  even crazier as we look at all of the political correctness that is surrounding the season it
[1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:52.920]  goes beyond baby it's cold outside i i guess they are saying that in scotland because it really is
[1:06:52.920 --> 1:06:56.920]  cold in scotland this time of year especially if you're wearing a kilt but i guess years of wearing
[1:06:56.920 --> 1:07:03.880]  a kilt has confused the scottish parliament on gingerbread men they have now banned the term
[1:07:03.880 --> 1:07:10.360]  gingerbread men because they said it promotes sexism so you got to have ginger persons and
[1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:15.560]  we're not talking about redheaded persons we're talking about but you know i think maybe they
[1:07:15.560 --> 1:07:21.640]  should just call them gender trans because you know these cookies don't have any genitals on them
[1:07:22.280 --> 1:07:28.680]  so there is no objective biological basis to determine what their sex is right and especially
[1:07:28.680 --> 1:07:33.400]  even if you flare it out like a skirt or something i mean they already have kilt's in scotland so we
[1:07:33.400 --> 1:07:41.080]  could just go just like real transgenders right it isn't based on any genitals it's based on how you
[1:07:41.080 --> 1:07:47.560]  decorate them so you could just decorate them and they could be whatever gender you want it to be
[1:07:47.560 --> 1:07:54.680]  the gender bread men oh i'm sorry not men the gender bread persons gender bread yeah maybe it's uh
[1:07:55.560 --> 1:08:02.040]  bread as brd bred that's what they have bred into the minds of these kids that they have hand
[1:08:02.040 --> 1:08:07.240]  and hammered this political correctness into for generations it's absolutely amazing uh and other
[1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:13.320]  christmas news i guess travel news we have the tsa has made it official they're not about air
[1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:19.800]  safety at all it's never been about air safety it has always been about exercising control and
[1:08:19.800 --> 1:08:28.600]  harassing people it is a theater it is security theater and we pointed this out years ago we had
[1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:35.640]  jonathan corbett do a lawsuit and he said uh you have he basically defeated the scanners the body
[1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:43.000]  scanners that they had there and he sued them over that as part of his lawsuit and discovery
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:51.160]  he was able to find that going back to 2011 they said there is no threat against any airplanes or
[1:08:51.160 --> 1:08:56.920]  airports now this was happening at the same time that texas was pushing back on all this mandatory
[1:08:56.920 --> 1:09:03.400]  man handling of children and so forth sexually assaulting people as a precondition to traveling
[1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:11.080]  in the united states of america and you had the texas house unanimously passed a bill that said
[1:09:11.080 --> 1:09:17.080]  you're not going to do that here that's an unwarranted search and so many different
[1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:24.440]  meanings of the word unwarranted and to push that back you had the lieutenant governor here in texas
[1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:31.000]  at the time dohurst a retired cia guy he was a maid man they after he retired the cia they set
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.480]  him up in the oil business the bushes and so forth he got a lot of he got very wealthy he
[1:09:35.480 --> 1:09:40.280]  spent more money than anybody's ever spent to get elected to statewide office here in texas
[1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:46.040]  and then he spearheaded the move along with the federal tsa to shut that down in the senate here
[1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:50.760]  in texas but as they were doing that and threatening to turn texas into a no fly zone
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:58.840]  they also had internal memos that said there is no threat to airports or to airplanes now
[1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:04.360]  how do we know that they also posted on pacer dot gov where they put all the lawsuits up
[1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:10.600]  they posted up on pacer dot gov by accident the unredacted lawsuit they didn't want you to see
[1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:15.640]  that and they left it up there for a while and we saw that and we reported it here at info wars
[1:10:15.640 --> 1:10:20.600]  we're the only news outlet that reported that nobody else wanted to report what they wanted
[1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:24.120]  to cover up because they put that up for a while and then they took it down they replaced it with
[1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:28.760]  their redacted version so we uh snapshoted both of those and said oh here's what they don't want
[1:10:28.760 --> 1:10:34.280]  you to know they don't want you to know that there is no threat so that's uh the reality of this but
[1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:38.280]  now it's gotten more obvious you know one of the things that you could do to help security is to
[1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:44.200]  have air marshals on the planes and locks on the doors simple stuff like that instead of big
[1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:49.080]  expensive machines that are going to uh bombard you with x-rays so the people are gonna sexually
[1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:54.520]  harass you to travel no you could have uh air marshals undercover agents and now they're gonna
[1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:59.480]  basically blow their cover by saying they must set in the back of the plane why don't they just put
[1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:06.840]  a little sign around their neck you know here are the air marshals take them out first again it's
[1:11:06.840 --> 1:11:13.400]  not about air safety uh air safety takes a backseat literally to controlling people we look at what
[1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:18.120]  happened at gatwick airport that was shut down for days they had hundreds of thousands of people
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:23.560]  they were camping out for a couple of days couldn't move why because they had somebody flying drones
[1:11:24.440 --> 1:11:28.840]  around the area every time they would uh they would see the drone go up they would shut down
[1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:33.080]  the air traffic because it was too dangerous they might hit them might cause a crash to the plane
[1:11:33.800 --> 1:11:38.680]  and then they'll go to get the drone and they would disappear and as they'd pull back they would
[1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:42.440]  reappear some other place it was obvious that they were playing a cat and mouse game with them they
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:49.320]  were doing it deliberately they said at the end of last week that they had used high tech devices
[1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:56.280]  in order to find out who this was and they arrested a couple of people paul gate 47 and his wife elaine
[1:11:56.280 --> 1:12:02.680]  kirk 54 spent more than 36 hours being quizzed by detectives over the device that brought gatwick
[1:12:02.680 --> 1:12:09.880]  airport to his knees they then returned home today after friends and family insisted that they were
[1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:14.040]  not the eco warriors behind the attack and they haven't been charged though there were question
[1:12:14.040 --> 1:12:18.600]  for quite some time they were returned home without being charged their friends and neighbors say
[1:12:18.600 --> 1:12:24.040]  they didn't do it so now it looks like for all their wanted equipment they had the wrong people
[1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:31.160]  and they sent them home president trump meanwhile says drones are a lot of fun maybe he did it no
[1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:34.920]  they'll they'll probably blame see it and he'll probably blame it on him but he has an alibi he
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:41.480]  was in the us of the time but he says an old only a good old-fashioned wall works he's talking about
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:46.440]  the border yeah we can put drones up and we can watch the people that are coming across the border
[1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:53.080]  but you can't stop them with a drone right and you have to have some way to keep them from getting
[1:12:53.080 --> 1:13:01.000]  into the judicial system why because the judges will work against our interests and that's why
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:06.120]  we have this government shutdown and i hope it continues for a while uh president trump
[1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:09.720]  has done the right thing but president trump needs to understand he doesn't even he has
[1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:15.080]  more power than he even recognizes at this moment president trump and white house secretary
[1:13:15.080 --> 1:13:20.360]  sarah sanders have both now said why is it that we can protect other countries but we can't protect
[1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:26.440]  our borders they're getting very close to the answer the answer is that there is no purpose you
[1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:31.800]  have a you have the authority and the duty to protect our country at the border president trump
[1:13:32.760 --> 1:13:37.720]  and you don't need the permission of any judges to do it you don't need funding from the mexico
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:43.000]  the mexican government to do it and you don't need funding even from the congress to do it
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:51.240]  you have a defense budget how were we able to build a dozen military bases in syria and for
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:58.760]  for air bases in syria how are we allowed to do that where was the money appropriated specifically
[1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:04.040]  for that it wasn't in general it was supposedly about the defense of our country i can make a
[1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:10.360]  much better case that we're defending our country at this border than you can about what's happening
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:17.240]  in syria you know we're supposed to have a vote before we invade another country we didn't have
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:21.640]  that vote under the constitution so all the people saying that president trump can't do this legally
[1:14:21.640 --> 1:14:29.240]  at the border because of posicomitatus or some other imagined legal obstacle to that posicomitatus
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:37.240]  is about using the military as law enforcement in our country against our citizens this would
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:41.560]  be used to keep people who are not our citizens out of our country because once they get in the
[1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:49.960]  country they then become the wards of the activist federal judges and president trump needs to
[1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:55.720]  understand that he has both the authority and the duty to protect our border and that means using
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:15:02.120]  the military using military expenditures to build the border to build the wall if necessary i mean
[1:15:02.120 --> 1:15:06.200]  even at the border once the people come across they said all right we're not going to separate
[1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:11.320]  families if somebody says that this is their child we don't know we don't have any papers or any
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:16.120]  way to get any information about them so instead of separating them we'll keep them together for a
[1:15:16.120 --> 1:15:21.560]  while until we can do some dna testing or do something to try to determine who these people are
[1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:28.040]  they just showed up without any papers at our doorstep wanting to be our dependents and where
[1:15:28.040 --> 1:15:35.320]  do they go for all that well they are taken to a military base where do we find the authority
[1:15:35.320 --> 1:15:41.400]  to house people from other countries but we can't find the authority to keep them out of our country
[1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:48.600]  to keep them out of our judicial system and then we got jimmy kimmel what a piece of excrement mocking
[1:15:48.600 --> 1:15:54.600]  the people who are donating to this go fund me wall if our elected representatives won't fund it
[1:15:54.600 --> 1:15:59.480]  we'll fund it ourselves please whatever you do realize that we're all getting punched drunk to
[1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:04.280]  the censorship and you saw 18 twitter accounts they say affiliate with enforcers yeah some of them
[1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:08.120]  were like little side accounts they even know we had like info were stored that just showed our
[1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:13.640]  products but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that i'd be in a trump rally and be

[1:17:57.240 --> 1:18:02.760]  life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block we have found an
[1:18:02.760 --> 1:18:09.480]  extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:16.920]  and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory functions in the 1960s researchers in france
[1:18:16.920 --> 1:18:22.280]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:27.880]  responses they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have
[1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:33.400]  the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:39.880]  symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research
[1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:44.920]  is found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that
[1:18:44.920 --> 1:18:51.240]  amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:57.640]  head to info wars life dot com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets the globalists
[1:18:57.640 --> 1:19:02.760]  are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law if there's any
[1:19:02.760 --> 1:19:08.680]  opposition and there's any independent media they can call the fact that the emperor has no close
[1:19:08.680 --> 1:19:15.160]  they can call bs it's game over but if you look at everybody else like michael savage and rush limbaugh
[1:19:15.160 --> 1:19:19.240]  and tucker carlson and sean hennedy they are all beholded to the networks they're on
[1:19:19.240 --> 1:19:26.280]  they can be targeted there's only two groups in the us info wars and matt grudge of drudgerport.com
[1:19:26.920 --> 1:19:31.400]  that are truly independent and of course they're two of the dominant media forces in the world
[1:19:32.040 --> 1:19:37.640]  it really is amazing that's why as we close out 2018 i want to just remind the listeners of the
[1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:41.800]  amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together just remind you that you are the power
[1:19:41.800 --> 1:19:48.280]  you're the strength through the will of info wars so please spread the links info wars dot com news
[1:19:48.280 --> 1:19:52.920]  wars dot com prism planet dot com because if you don't spread the articles the video is no one else
[1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:56.280]  will we're all in each other's hands god bless you all and thank you
[1:19:56.280 --> 1:20:12.200]  you're listening to the alex joneshow
[1:20:12.200 --> 1:20:18.200]  you
[1:20:23.160 --> 1:20:29.000]  welcome back let's take a look at the wall because we're told that uh there's not any money for the
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:35.800]  wall and i don't believe it uh mark meadows doesn't believe it he said we spend more money on sugar
[1:20:35.800 --> 1:20:41.960]  subsidies than we're asking for this and we look at the total amount as i mentioned uh we we spend
[1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:49.400]  four trillion dollars on the budget five billion dollars is less than one eighth of one percent
[1:20:50.840 --> 1:20:55.320]  so if you got a dollar to spend that's one eighth of a penny if you want to think of it that way
[1:20:55.960 --> 1:20:59.400]  but there's many other different ways that you can think about this i mean we've got um
[1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:06.120]  as daily caller points out uh the government lost more money bailing out general motors
[1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:12.760]  than is being asked for for the wall according to a 2014 special inspector generally port
[1:21:12.760 --> 1:21:18.680]  american taxpayers took an 11.2 billion dollar loss on its bailout of general motors
[1:21:18.680 --> 1:21:24.200]  it's more than twice as much as they're asking for the wall uh after the automaker declared bankruptcy
[1:21:24.200 --> 1:21:30.200]  in 2009 the government invested 49.5 billion dollars in the company with a 61 equity share
[1:21:30.200 --> 1:21:36.520]  over time gm's stock price dropped and despite selling back shares the u.s government took a
[1:21:36.520 --> 1:21:42.440]  billion billion dollar these multi-billion dollar losses over 11 billion dollars now of course general
[1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:49.560]  motors was bragging about the fact that they had paid back all that money with interest and that
[1:21:49.560 --> 1:21:53.240]  was phony they had a couple of different accounts they had one that was alone and then they had
[1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:56.520]  another one that was an outright grant which is what this was talking about they've just basically
[1:21:56.520 --> 1:22:01.640]  moved the money from one place to the other side look we paid you back kind of like what happened
[1:22:01.640 --> 1:22:08.600]  with the banks and the bailout system that we had with that the federal reserve obligingly took the
[1:22:08.600 --> 1:22:14.360]  interest rates down to zero percent so they could pay back all that money with zero percent loans
[1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:18.520]  they don't do that for you do they oh that's right they don't yeah especially if you got a credit
[1:22:18.520 --> 1:22:24.360]  card this time of year you're going to be paying probably anywhere from 15 to 25 interest and they
[1:22:24.360 --> 1:22:30.600]  may go up on that if they say that you represent a credit risk to them you know if somebody in your
[1:22:30.600 --> 1:22:33.960]  family gets sick and you have a health issue and let's oh your credit rating just went down
[1:22:34.840 --> 1:22:42.440]  so we're going to go up on your credit card rate yeah we do live in potters potterville don't we
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:46.840]  like it's a wonderful lie and i think like george bailey we need to say we shouldn't have to go
[1:22:46.840 --> 1:22:52.280]  crawling to the federal reserve crawling to congress in order to live our lives or to grow
[1:22:52.280 --> 1:22:56.440]  our economy and yet that's exactly what they're telling us we're going to tell you why president
[1:22:56.440 --> 1:23:02.840]  trump can and should fire the fed chair in a little bit but let's take a look at some of the
[1:23:02.840 --> 1:23:11.080]  other things that we spent money on we had the big dig remember that up in boston they had a very
[1:23:12.360 --> 1:23:19.640]  big project up there as i point out in daily caller it was boston's primary thoroughfare
[1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:24.280]  and they rerouted it they had a lot of financial mismanagement they had design flaws in it
[1:23:24.840 --> 1:23:28.600]  the federal highway administration stepped in and they gave them a bailout
[1:23:29.640 --> 1:23:34.120]  they said we'll give you seven billion dollars in grants but by the time it was completed in
[1:23:34.120 --> 1:23:46.120]  2010 the total ticket price was 15 billion dollars so we can build a failed thoroughfare in boston
[1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:54.440]  that has bad design and mismanagement but we can't do it to our own wall now i think the
[1:23:54.440 --> 1:23:59.960]  icing on the cake for me came when jimmy kimmel started making fun of the people who said all
[1:23:59.960 --> 1:24:06.440]  right congress we have voted multiple times for these sellouts like mitch mcconnell and john
[1:24:06.440 --> 1:24:13.240]  cornan who refused to pass the money just a little bit of this i mean we're talking about a situation
[1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:21.080]  where it's 215 miles is all and half of that has already got a fence there there would be rebuilding
[1:24:21.080 --> 1:24:27.480]  that fence you know that works out to 23 million dollars a mile so one of the reasons why we can't
[1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:33.000]  get anything done you look at what happened and the big dig and boston and so forth if we were
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:37.800]  to try to build an interstate system today we couldn't do it why is that have we forgotten the
[1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:44.360]  technology that is necessary to build something as simple as a road and i say as simple as a road
[1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:50.280]  because somehow we can in all of our cities we can build houses we can build skyscrapers
[1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:56.520]  but we can't figure out how to build simple things like roads and walls they're just too
[1:24:56.520 --> 1:25:03.480]  expensive we overthink we over engineer and we overspend on everything that the federal government
[1:25:03.480 --> 1:25:09.000]  does and why is that why do they spend so much more money today well it's because of the bidding
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:14.200]  system it's because of the inherent corruption in the system these projects these infrastructure
[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:21.160]  projects we can't get anything built because it is so bloated and corrupt this is why you got
[1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:26.920]  situations like ilan musk with a boring project he's got weight goes underground with it it's
[1:25:26.920 --> 1:25:32.760]  basically a good idea what i don't like about it is that ilan musk's business model and his
[1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:40.360]  engineering idea is a great idea quite frankly but his business model is always based on government
[1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:48.840]  subsidies from you and i and on monopolies and as you saw the cbs reporter driving through that
[1:25:48.840 --> 1:25:52.280]  tunnel with them and she was all excited about look at how fast this thing is going it seemed
[1:25:52.280 --> 1:25:59.160]  real fast to her because it was very enclosed they were only going 15 20 miles an hour but
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:02.840]  as she's talking to him he said well you're going to have to have this on autopilot to make
[1:26:02.840 --> 1:26:06.840]  sure you don't collide with others so all the cars i have to have my autopilot she didn't
[1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:14.520]  follow up on that so this is something only for people who buy your tesla cars right so everybody
[1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:18.520]  buy a tesla car or you'd have to buy some kind of i guess an add-on system or something that
[1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:23.400]  worked with an equivalent car so you'd have to buy into his operating system he's going to own that
[1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:30.920]  you have to have something like that because you have to go vertical as he pointed out he had
[1:26:30.920 --> 1:26:35.560]  it he said look we're we're traveling in a two-dimensional space but we're living in a three
[1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:40.600]  dimensional space in the cities they they can't build the roads out and they couldn't build the
[1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:44.920]  buildings out either so they built the buildings higher and higher but they won't build the roads
[1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:49.560]  higher and higher that's what he's talking about a two-dimensional space if you go back and look at
[1:26:49.560 --> 1:26:55.480]  the uh envisioning uh the future that they would have back in the 20s and 30s early movies of that
[1:26:55.480 --> 1:26:59.480]  they would show skyscrapers everywhere oh yeah we got the skyscrapers and then they would show
[1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:06.840]  multiple layers of roads which they never built they forgot to do that they didn't want to do that
[1:27:07.560 --> 1:27:11.240]  they got too expensive too corrupt the only transportation infrastructure we're going to
[1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:17.240]  have now is going to be funded by billionaires who then have a monopoly control of our system
[1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:23.400]  the government no longer wants to provide infrastructure just like we see with this attitude
[1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:29.400]  about the border they don't want to do anything to serve us it's all self-serving about their
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:37.080]  interests and they will let the billionaires control everything that you do they will be
[1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:42.120]  running the security systems they will be monitoring everything that you do taxing everything that you
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:48.040]  do the government is not going to serve you with infrastructure anymore and so when you look at his
[1:27:48.040 --> 1:27:54.360]  project what he's basically doing is he is going three-dimensional by being able to go underground
[1:27:54.360 --> 1:28:00.760]  he can expand it three-dimensionally makes perfectly good sense but it is a fascist economic model
[1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:06.920]  where the government becomes increasingly more of a police state a surveillance state not interested
[1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:12.840]  with building infrastructure that will be owned and built by their crony capitalist friends
[1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:19.400]  like elon musk or jeff bezos that's the sad part about that but getting back to the wall
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:23.400]  getting back to what jimmy kimmel did we got a clip of jimmy kimmel we're going to play that for
[1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:27.080]  you when we come back i went a little bit long on this and then we're also going to talk about

[1:28:36.760 --> 1:29:04.520]  we need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom our freedoms don't consist of the
[1:29:04.520 --> 1:29:08.120]  things that are enumerated on a piece of paper it consists of the things that we're willing to fight
[1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:13.240]  for the first amendment the bill of rights the rest of the bill of rights are prohibitions
[1:29:13.240 --> 1:29:18.520]  they're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those
[1:29:18.520 --> 1:29:23.080]  god-given rights from us as individuals you better understand that because they're taking them right
[1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:32.280]  now we have seen what they want to do they called it unagent 21 now they call it the un 2030 agenda
[1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:37.320]  they want everybody off of the rural lands they want people out of the suburbs they want to
[1:29:37.320 --> 1:29:43.080]  pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone

[1:33:31.240 --> 1:33:38.040]  welcome back you know on uh on thursday we had jimmy kimmel along with uh steven cobert he seems
[1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:46.200]  to be these two guys are the democrat party's court gestures and they're not really funny but
[1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:53.320]  they are partisan and they are weaponized propaganda they follow the rules for radicals set up by
[1:33:53.320 --> 1:34:00.200]  sol alinsky one of those rules was that ridicule is the most powerful way to attack somebody because
[1:34:00.200 --> 1:34:06.840]  as alinsky said there's no answer to it so what you do is you ridicule people and jimmy kimmel
[1:34:06.840 --> 1:34:11.400]  was ridiculing the people who wanted to have the wall built you know we have had multiple elections
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:16.520]  where we've had people like mitch mcconnell and john cornyn tell us yeah we're gonna protect the
[1:34:16.520 --> 1:34:22.280]  border that's what we're about or paul ryan even though we know that paul ryan's been open borders
[1:34:22.280 --> 1:34:29.880]  all this political career he'll still campaign on getting control of immigration and they lie to us
[1:34:29.880 --> 1:34:36.920]  time and time again and then we have the supreme court coming up with more rulings on friday
[1:34:36.920 --> 1:34:42.520]  saying that president trump cannot stop illegal aliens at the border the only thing that's going
[1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:47.880]  to stop them folks is some kind of a physical barrier so the american people especially one
[1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:54.520]  individual uh brian colphagey i think is the way he pronounced his name uh he was the triple amputee
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:35:03.160]  lost three limbs in iraq and he had a conservative uh blog or or some kind of uh publication on
[1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:09.080]  facebook and they had encouraged him to spend money promoting it he had spent over 300 000
[1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:14.440]  dollars at facebook's urging to promote his conservative organization and then they just
[1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:19.640]  terminated him without any explanation well he's back and he's back with his go fund me campaign
[1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:24.520]  he wants to raise a billion dollars for the wall and people who voted for it are willing to pay
[1:35:24.520 --> 1:35:29.640]  for it as well and so jimmy kimmel can't ignore that it's gotten too big first time i saw this i
[1:35:29.640 --> 1:35:35.880]  printed out an article from the preceding evening and it was 400 000 and then the next day i was
[1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:40.440]  reporting on it and i was on air and the the the crew came on and said that no that's actually
[1:35:40.440 --> 1:35:47.640]  four million now it's like what grew by a factor of 10 in like 12 hours and then by the afternoon
[1:35:47.640 --> 1:35:53.320]  we had a story that went up at info wars dot com it was up to five at that point uh the next day
[1:35:53.320 --> 1:36:01.800]  it was up to 10 now it is up to 16.2 million it grew 100 000 dollars just in the last hour so it
[1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:07.240]  can't be ignored so what are they going to do to try to stop it they're going to ridicule it they're
[1:36:07.240 --> 1:36:13.080]  going to use clowns like jimmy kimmel who said this he said the twist in all of this and the
[1:36:13.080 --> 1:36:17.800]  government shut down and so forth is that the president might not need mexico or congress to
[1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:23.960]  pay for the wall at all because there's some very dopey people ready to pay for it themselves and
[1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:29.560]  he talks about the go fund the fund me campaign at the point he was mocking it it was only nine
[1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:33.480]  million dollars but he said a more useful thing to do with your money would be to go outside and
[1:36:33.480 --> 1:36:38.040]  feed it to a bird but you do have to admire the sacrifice that they're making i mean a lot of
[1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:44.920]  these people are dipping into their meth money for this and on top of all that trump's secretary
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:49.480]  defense general matt has surprised everyone in resign today it's what he said so uh that
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:54.920]  is jimmy kimmel's take on all this now ted cruz was saying uh president trump is not going to
[1:36:54.920 --> 1:37:01.880]  capitulate over this uh five billion dollar demand uh as i said before the sad thing about this is that
[1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:09.800]  with the the inefficiency the corruption and the overspending and over engineering that is endemic
[1:37:09.800 --> 1:37:14.280]  to our government anymore is basically paralyzed when it comes to infrastructure we can't build
[1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:18.520]  the infrastructure not only because we're spending so much money to destroy the infrastructure of
[1:37:18.520 --> 1:37:22.920]  other countries and undeclared wars and rebuilding their infrastructure before we build ours but it's
[1:37:22.920 --> 1:37:29.880]  also because we are so grossly inefficient at what we do i seriously doubt that if we go in and try
[1:37:29.880 --> 1:37:34.120]  to rebuild some of the infrastructure in iraq or afghanistan that we're paying the kind of money
[1:37:34.120 --> 1:37:41.080]  that we're paying for this wall 23 million dollars a mile i seriously doubt that uh but there is no
[1:37:41.080 --> 1:37:44.760]  support the reason we have this go fund me campaign is because look at what the republicans in
[1:37:44.760 --> 1:37:50.360]  congress did people like mitch mcconnell as the dallas news was pointing out on friday they said
[1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:59.400]  60 senators uh do not support the so-called nuclear option they said including mitch mcconnell well i
[1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:04.840]  don't know that it's 60 senators that is the nuclear option rule of 60 senators i don't think they had
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:12.360]  a headcount because you got the majority whip john cornyn of texas where a vast majority of these
[1:38:12.360 --> 1:38:19.400]  people are coming in doesn't want to protect texas he wants to protect washington see john cornyn
[1:38:19.400 --> 1:38:25.160]  would like to keep the washington government that doesn't care about this existential threat to our
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:30.040]  country he wants to keep washington going let's open washington and keep the border open at the
[1:38:30.040 --> 1:38:36.360]  same time we're not going to cut well close them both john cornyn said uh trump's demand to end the
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:40.280]  filibuster reflects quote a desire for immediate gratification without regard for long-term
[1:38:40.280 --> 1:38:45.960]  consequences in other words trump's a baby trump wants it right now says john cornyn remember that
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:55.160]  republicans of texas i'll remember that he was also uh mocking president trump on other issues
[1:38:55.160 --> 1:39:02.600]  about the border as well as foreign policy issues john cornyn it's just absolutely amazing to see
[1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:07.720]  these people and of course he's joined in all of this by people like lamar alexander and jeff flake
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:17.000]  i'm glad to see these people going uh it's it's about time that we see very clearly the people
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:23.400]  of the republican party who don't want this country to continue uh mark meadows said we spend more
[1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:30.520]  money on sugar subsidies i find it just incomprehensible that we can't secure our nation it's time we
[1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:36.360]  put this on president trump's desk and they did in the house basically because of mark meadows it
[1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:40.360]  wasn't going to be brought up by paul ryan but it was mark meadows going to president trump and they
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:47.000]  did take it to a vote they did pass it but of course mitch mcconnell shut it down and so as we
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:51.880]  the other thing that happened on friday later on friday we had the supreme court you had john roberts
[1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:59.960]  joining the liberal colleagues on friday to rule that president trump cannot stop illegal alien
[1:39:59.960 --> 1:40:05.560]  invasion as the new american pointed out in a two-sentence order joined by chief justice
[1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:11.720]  john roberts who was appointed by bush uh the man who twice helped to rescue obama care this
[1:40:11.720 --> 1:40:16.840]  unconstitutional the court blocked the administration's attempt to stop illegal aliens from simply
[1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:22.760]  claiming asylum now any illegal alien who crosses a border can apply for asylum and the u.s. government
[1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:29.640]  can't refuse to hear his case and uh so this is why you have to have a physical border to keep that
[1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:34.920]  from happening to keep them in their country that's why using the military to keep them in their
[1:40:34.920 --> 1:40:42.600]  country is not a violation of posi cometatus it is a violation of the promise to defend our country
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:49.160]  not to use the military to do this you're keeping foreign citizens in their country you're keeping
[1:40:49.160 --> 1:40:54.920]  them from entering the country you're not using the military for law enforcement against american
[1:40:54.920 --> 1:41:01.080]  citizens inside the country you're keeping them from coming into the country uh that is the very
[1:41:01.080 --> 1:41:05.800]  thing that the military should be used for and as they point out new american so here's a message
[1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:10.760]  to 158 million people in the world who want to immigrate to the u.s the door is open come on in
[1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:19.720]  we know this why because we had a gallop survey went over a couple of years went over 150 different
[1:41:19.720 --> 1:41:29.320]  countries they found 750 million people who want to change nationalities they are trans citizens
[1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:34.840]  they identify as being the citizen of another country therefore they are and we had more than
[1:41:34.840 --> 1:41:39.800]  three times as many people want to come to this country 158 million people said yeah i think i'd
[1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:44.680]  like to go to america they had under 50 million say they'd like to go to canada that was the number
[1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:51.720]  two destination of all of these transient uh trans citizens that are out there and so um
[1:41:52.280 --> 1:41:56.520]  they're not making this up that's 158 million people who told gallop that they want want to come
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:42:02.920]  to america why not we got a big welfare magnet to take care of them and we got a supreme court
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:10.280]  that says that president trump can't stop that now president trump needs to understand as he's
[1:42:10.280 --> 1:42:17.080]  taking on the presidential mantle this week he needs to understand that he has the authority
[1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:23.080]  under the constitution to do this and they can't stop him from doing that we have the
[1:42:24.040 --> 1:42:29.480]  example of andrew jackson who told the supreme court you've made your decision let's see you
[1:42:29.480 --> 1:42:33.960]  enforce it and that's what president trump needs to tell the supreme court and especially
[1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:40.680]  all of these federal judges there's absolutely nothing in the constitution that gives every
[1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:47.160]  single federal judge the power of veto to stop the president from doing his constitutionally
[1:42:47.160 --> 1:42:52.520]  delegated specifically delegated power to protect our borders we'll be right back stay with us
[1:42:52.520 --> 1:43:01.640]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in
[1:43:01.640 --> 1:43:07.000]  leilaniah states but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be concerned
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:14.120]  about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:20.840]  the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:26.840]  alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:33.480]  acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our elixir pure gravity filter and not only
[1:43:33.480 --> 1:43:39.880]  were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored to optimal levels
[1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:46.040]  as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of the water so what we've learned
[1:43:46.040 --> 1:43:52.680]  is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good
[1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:57.720]  water filtration system will purify it our grandparents and great grandparents knew that
[1:43:57.720 --> 1:44:03.480]  they can't food during the falls they have it during the winter and that's what i'm talking about

[1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:06.840]  if there's any opposition if there's any independent media that can call
[1:45:06.840 --> 1:45:12.920]  the fact that the emperor has no clothes they can call bs if game over but if you look at everybody
[1:45:12.920 --> 1:45:17.480]  else like michael savage and russia limbaugh and tucker carlson and sean hannity they are all

[1:49:13.640 --> 1:49:18.840]  of very good natural products that will help you with that let's take a look quickly now about this
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:25.320]  Fed issue of course we had President Trump as Bloomberg was reporting over the weekend had
[1:49:25.320 --> 1:49:31.080]  discussed firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell four people familiar with the matter said
[1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:35.880]  yeah he's talking about this this isn't something that just came up but this is something that
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:43.320]  was talked about more this week than it has been in the past why because we've got the Federal
[1:49:43.320 --> 1:49:49.560]  Reserve under Powell raising interest rates yet again with a shaky stock market with housing
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:55.640]  markets across the country in very difficult situations we've had a lot of markets where
[1:49:55.640 --> 1:50:00.840]  like in the Las Vegas market they had over 7000 homes that didn't get a single offer this is
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:05.880]  pretty much unprecedented but we have reports of slowing markets all the way across the country
[1:50:05.880 --> 1:50:13.160]  Dallas New York Florida Las Vegas other places it's getting shaky and then you have the Federal
[1:50:13.160 --> 1:50:16.760]  Reserve coming in and say well yeah we're gonna raise interest rates and I'm not gonna stop I'm
[1:50:16.760 --> 1:50:24.120]  gonna do more of it next year and now we have them trying to walk this back even though they said
[1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:28.200]  that the president has talked privately according to people that were familiar with the matter
[1:50:28.200 --> 1:50:34.040]  matter four people they had talked to Bloomberg said he talked privately about firing Powell many
[1:50:34.040 --> 1:50:39.400]  times the past few days said two of the people they said any attempt by Trump to push out Powell
[1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:44.120]  would have a devastating ripple undermining investors confidence in the central bank's
[1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:48.440]  ability to shepherd the economy without political interference come on seriously you think the
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:53.320]  Federal Reserve isn't interfering with our economy you've got a lot of confidence in the
[1:50:53.320 --> 1:50:57.080]  Federal Reserve after what they did you had a lot of economists saying if they raise interest
[1:50:57.080 --> 1:51:03.320]  rates before they did they ought to all be fired for malpractice and then they go on to say this
[1:51:03.320 --> 1:51:07.160]  in the Bloomberg article it's unclear how much legal authority the president has to fire power
[1:51:07.160 --> 1:51:12.840]  Powell no it's not the Federal Reserve acts says that governors may be removed for cause
[1:51:12.840 --> 1:51:18.200]  by the president and then they go on to whine about the separation of politics from monetary
[1:51:18.200 --> 1:51:21.720]  policy you know this wall of separation like we have church and state or something which is not
[1:51:21.720 --> 1:51:26.920]  in the constitution and when Jefferson said that he met a wall around the government to keep them
[1:51:26.920 --> 1:51:31.480]  out of the church not the other way around nevertheless the separation of politics from
[1:51:31.480 --> 1:51:36.040]  monetary policy it's supposed to instill confidence that Fed officials will do what's right for the
[1:51:36.040 --> 1:51:43.400]  economy on the long term rather than been to the short-term whims of a politician so how have they
[1:51:43.400 --> 1:51:49.320]  been doing in terms of managing the economy folks I mean look at the great recession that we had
[1:51:49.320 --> 1:51:56.200]  10 years ago and then they turned around and did exactly the same thing again China is allowed to have
[1:51:56.200 --> 1:52:02.920]  10% a year growth for 40 years they were just bragging about that this last week who had
[1:52:02.920 --> 1:52:08.360]  President Xi saying look at this after Ding Institute is reforms we've had nine and a half percent
[1:52:09.160 --> 1:52:13.800]  per year growth in China but here in America according to the Fed and according all these
[1:52:13.800 --> 1:52:18.600]  experts on Wall Street and Bloomberg we are going to melt down we're going to have
[1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:24.520]  uncontrolled inflation if we have more than two or three percent growth if we get more than that
[1:52:24.520 --> 1:52:30.360]  the Fed has to throttle down the economy except that there's already signs that it's been throttled
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:34.600]  maybe too much and they still continue to raise interest rates but why is it that China gets a
[1:52:34.600 --> 1:52:41.560]  pass why is it that China can grow three to four times as fast as we can in the same way that
[1:52:41.560 --> 1:52:45.560]  they're allowed to have tariffs that are 10 times what our tariffs are on their products coming
[1:52:45.560 --> 1:52:49.080]  into our country and when President Trump says all right you can either lower those tariffs or I'm
[1:52:49.080 --> 1:52:54.440]  going to raise our tariffs to your level they say look at what Trump is doing this is terrible
[1:52:54.440 --> 1:52:58.360]  he's going to destroy this country because he's raising tariffs up to the level that Chinese
[1:52:58.360 --> 1:53:02.760]  said well if you don't like high tariffs and why do you like them when China does it if you don't
[1:53:02.760 --> 1:53:06.600]  like high growth why do you allow China to have it it's because the Federal Reserve and these
[1:53:06.600 --> 1:53:11.640]  globalists don't care about America and they think that we have to come crawling to them
[1:53:11.640 --> 1:53:18.840]  for permission I said this the day after the election people were talking already about
[1:53:18.840 --> 1:53:23.320]  whether or not Trump would fire Janet Yellen Wall Street was writing stuff they said oh no
[1:53:23.320 --> 1:53:26.840]  he's not going to do that we've got to keep the Fed independent he's not going to fire
[1:53:26.840 --> 1:53:31.880]  Janet Yellen and then on December the 14th 2016 after President Trump was elected on November
[1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:38.520]  the 8th this article from Fortune said Janet Yellen and the Fed rise interest rates for the
[1:53:38.520 --> 1:53:44.920]  first time in 2016 at that time they said they're going to raise it by a quarter of a percentage
[1:53:44.920 --> 1:53:51.000]  point to a half a percent between a half a percent and three quarters of a percent now they've
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:57.640]  just done it again it is now up to two and a quarter to two and a half percent so they've
[1:53:57.640 --> 1:54:02.200]  gone from a half a percent to two and a quarter from three quarters of percent to two and a half
[1:54:02.200 --> 1:54:08.520]  percent why how did they get there they've been raising it a quarter every quarter a quarter of
[1:54:08.520 --> 1:54:14.680]  a percent every quarter since before right after President Trump got elected I said at the time I
[1:54:14.680 --> 1:54:19.800]  talked about it day after day after day when they did it the very first time I said we have
[1:54:19.800 --> 1:54:24.680]  seen this pattern I said you watch they're going to do it a quarter per quarter until they burst
[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:28.440]  the bubble that they created it's exactly the same thing that Greenspan did and they've been doing
[1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:35.960]  that as Gateway Pundit pointed out the Fed and Jerome Powell have increased annual U.S. debt
[1:54:35.960 --> 1:54:40.360]  by half a trillion dollars just in the interest payments by raising these interest rates from
[1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:46.520]  a half a percent to two and a half percent it's a hundred times what President Trump wants for the
[1:54:46.520 --> 1:54:51.960]  wall so they can't find five billion dollars to pay for the wall but supposedly you know we can
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:56.360]  have welfare payments that are going to pay for all the immigrants who come in
[1:54:56.360 --> 1:55:03.560]  and we have interest rates that have been raised so that's going to be another 500 billion dollars
[1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:08.360]  more that we have to pay to service that interest rate is that something that would
[1:55:09.400 --> 1:55:16.200]  fall in the category of firing the Fed for cause I said after he tanked the U.S. economy by four
[1:55:16.200 --> 1:55:20.280]  trillion dollars and wiped out one sixth of the market is that something that we could fire him for
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:27.160]  this is what Powell has done he had his October the third speech he said the economy uh he's
[1:55:27.160 --> 1:55:31.480]  going to continue to raise interest rates he said at that point in time and then you have
[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:37.960]  others say the president cannot do it over disagreement over monetary policy what does
[1:55:37.960 --> 1:55:41.560]  it mean when you say you're going to fire somebody for cause you know you have two different ways
[1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:45.080]  that you work for somebody you either have at will employment contracts which means that
[1:55:45.800 --> 1:55:49.560]  you can leave at will or you can be fired at will nobody has to give the employee
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:55.000]  or the employer doesn't have to give a reason if you are somebody like a CEO you know like
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:56:00.600]  less moonbeds you know you get a contract and they can't fire you you know if you're
[1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:04.680]  Megyn Kelly or some other big executive they can't fire you without violating that contract so they
[1:56:04.680 --> 1:56:11.400]  have to show that you have done something wrong so if you have a contract you're going to be fired
[1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:16.520]  either for cause or for misconduct and those are two different things if you take a look at
[1:56:16.520 --> 1:56:22.840]  what this means termination for cause according to us legal website legal website it refers to
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:28.200]  the expiration of a contract when one side fails to act in the terms of the contract termination
[1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:32.760]  for cause can result from work not being done or being done incorrectly do you think that wiping
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:37.400]  out four trillion dollars of equity in the stock market one six of the stock market you think that
[1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:43.160]  that's uh uh doing the right uh you know doing your work correctly or is that something that
[1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:48.680]  President Trump could fire them for does it look like they're incompetent or malicious that's a
[1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:52.840]  question the only question in my mind now the other thing is serious acts or missions committed
[1:56:52.840 --> 1:56:57.560]  by an employee that adversely affect the company's business and material respect so that would be
[1:56:57.560 --> 1:57:02.760]  what you would have in a corporation when you talk about for cause that's exactly what they're
[1:57:02.760 --> 1:57:06.360]  talking about now misconduct is something else most of these people who are saying that President
[1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:11.080]  Trump can't fire the Fed chair say no no he has to commit a crime or something you know he has to
[1:57:11.080 --> 1:57:16.280]  uh uh have a me to violation or something like that before we get rid of him and as long as he
[1:57:16.280 --> 1:57:22.440]  doesn't have a casting couch with Janet Yellen we can't get rid of him now typically in these
[1:57:22.440 --> 1:57:29.240]  contracts they include misconduct uh things like uh intentional wrongdoing or malfeasance
[1:57:29.240 --> 1:57:34.280]  or violation of a law or violating work and safety or harassing somebody they typically include that
[1:57:34.280 --> 1:57:40.520]  but it doesn't limit itself simply to criminal actions like that all right that's all the time
[1:57:40.520 --> 1:57:44.280]  we've got thank you for listening stay tuned we've got Mike Adams coming up and i want to
[1:57:44.280 --> 1:58:14.120]  wish everybody a merry christmas
