[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:37.440]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex jones
[00:37.440 --> 00:44.960]  we're live my friends thank you so much for joining us it is Wednesday the 23rd
[00:44.960 --> 00:52.280]  day of March 2011 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours we have
[00:52.280 --> 00:57.360]  James Corbett joining us from Japan you know he's been a frequent guest on this
[00:57.360 --> 01:03.680]  broadcast he is a news journalist and researcher with his own TV program also
[01:03.680 --> 01:08.640]  Aaron Dykes will be joining us in studio in the last 30 minutes because we did
[01:08.640 --> 01:14.200]  successfully dig up that 2008 interview I did almost four years ago with the
[01:14.200 --> 01:21.080]  director of harp and the thing is a complete whitewash and I had remembered
[01:21.080 --> 01:25.000]  the Army the Air Force Colonel coming on and cutting him off but he did that in
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.520]  a break and they cut the interview short then I come back from break and say
[01:27.520 --> 01:32.520]  well they cut the interview short and basically didn't allow it to continue but
[01:32.520 --> 01:35.720]  I'm gonna try to get that current director of harp our research shows he's
[01:35.720 --> 01:42.240]  still the director back on yet again because Aaron after refinding the audio
[01:42.240 --> 01:47.600]  yesterday of the 35 minute interview reposted it on info wars.com and did
[01:47.600 --> 01:53.120]  some research on the interview with the guy denying things on the broadcast that
[01:53.120 --> 01:58.520]  he had admitted to in other interviews or that the Pentagon had admitted to
[01:58.520 --> 02:03.560]  previously so we're gonna be looking at harp in the last 30 minutes of the third
[02:03.560 --> 02:10.280]  hour today so that is all coming up again I want to thank you for joining us
[02:10.280 --> 02:17.160]  we're gonna get into the unraveling coalition of the willing with the whole
[02:17.160 --> 02:25.840]  Libya situation also video has surfaced of then senator now vice president Joe
[02:25.840 --> 02:32.080]  Biden involved in a town hall meeting and then subsequently on MSNBC with
[02:32.080 --> 02:38.020]  swine ball Chris Matthews talking about impeaching a president if they
[02:38.020 --> 02:44.160]  unilaterally launch military attacks on countries that hadn't attacked us first
[02:44.160 --> 02:49.600]  and that it was unconstitutional now Obama has gone even further than Bush
[02:49.600 --> 02:54.240]  because Bush did get a resolution of force from the Congress it was not a
[02:54.240 --> 02:58.960]  declaration of war it was still unconstitutional but comparatively and
[02:58.960 --> 03:06.200]  you know I was a big enemy and you know of those preemptive illegal genocidal
[03:06.200 --> 03:16.360]  wars I was a big person for peace but at the same time what Obama has done has
[03:16.360 --> 03:22.320]  gone even further because in less than 48 hours after the UN resolution he
[03:22.320 --> 03:26.920]  didn't even consult Congress he didn't try to get a resolution nothing he
[03:26.920 --> 03:32.840]  launched those operations from the cruise missiles off of the missile
[03:32.840 --> 03:41.640]  cruiser ships from the aircraft F-15s he and others flying around and a lot of
[03:41.640 --> 03:45.480]  people a lot of conservatives and liberals across that control political
[03:45.480 --> 03:48.840]  spectrum are pointing out that it was unconstitutional because he didn't get
[03:48.840 --> 03:53.800]  any type of congressional approval Congress passes the laws orders the
[03:53.800 --> 04:01.480]  wars the president executes it as the executive but the Congress represents
[04:01.480 --> 04:05.640]  we the people the shareholders of the Republic we then through our elected
[04:05.640 --> 04:11.040]  representatives give orders to the CEO if you want to use a business analogy to
[04:11.040 --> 04:17.600]  execute the policies of the board of directors i.e. the Congress and we the
[04:17.600 --> 04:22.320]  people but more and more it is this unelected United Nations itself created
[04:22.320 --> 04:26.960]  by the family that pushes globalism like no other the Rockefellers that
[04:26.960 --> 04:31.120]  literally funded and financed the starting of it at the Presidio base
[04:31.120 --> 04:35.720]  there in San Francisco and then subsequently gave them the land to
[04:35.720 --> 04:41.320]  build the main headquarters in New York City that is all coming up now but the
[04:41.320 --> 04:46.520]  biggest news the biggest news is the radiation cover up we're now getting a
[04:46.520 --> 04:50.520]  very clear picture of just how big this cover up is here's the headline out of
[04:50.520 --> 04:55.960]  Japan RT's also reporting it but Japanese news confirms this radiation levels at
[04:55.960 --> 05:02.080]  Fukushima exceed 1,600 times safe levels a very wealthy US citizen is
[05:02.080 --> 05:07.080]  predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in
[05:07.080 --> 05:11.240]  more than 50 years he says it will change everything about our lives the way
[05:11.240 --> 05:14.880]  you shop travel invest educate your children and even how you take care of
[05:14.880 --> 05:18.520]  your health and your own family now this man has made some outrageous predictions
[05:18.520 --> 05:22.880]  over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you see he predicted the
[05:22.880 --> 05:27.000]  collapse of GM Danny May Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general
[05:27.000 --> 05:32.000]  growth properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.640]  created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and
[05:35.640 --> 05:39.640]  most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress this

[08:25.360 --> 08:33.080]  the Sydney Morning Herald and Fox News as well as many Japanese newspapers are
[08:33.080 --> 08:38.800]  reporting that they have had to evacuate the Fukushima six reactor
[08:38.800 --> 08:45.120]  disaster site area because of smoke now that that's code word for highly
[08:45.120 --> 08:55.200]  radioactive isotopes uranium plutonium tritium strontium cesium radioactive
[08:55.200 --> 09:02.520]  iodine pouring out of the maws of the gaping wounds were four of the reactors
[09:02.520 --> 09:08.480]  as you know have blown sky high and had some subsequent fires on screen for
[09:08.480 --> 09:13.040]  prison planet dot TV viewers we do have the Sydney Morning Herald up their
[09:13.040 --> 09:18.720]  evacuation at Fukushima plant ever smoke seen at reactor they've confirmed that
[09:18.720 --> 09:23.360]  the reactors are multiple reactors are boiling and off-gassing extremely
[09:23.360 --> 09:27.520]  radioactive gas directly into the atmosphere and then blowing towards the
[09:27.520 --> 09:34.160]  United States it was confirmed yesterday in Iceland multiple radioactive isotopes
[09:34.160 --> 09:40.160]  that have traveled more than 10,000 miles from Japan on its northeast coast
[09:40.160 --> 09:46.000]  over North America over the Atlantic to Iceland set to be arriving in England
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.560]  anytime now and then in the next day over Europe and then back over the
[09:50.560 --> 09:57.720]  Middle East Central Asia East Asia and back over Japan so many forecasters
[09:57.720 --> 10:02.760]  estimate that within another week the radioactive gas different variants of
[10:02.760 --> 10:09.640]  different isotopes will have gone all the way around the world so we're gonna
[10:09.640 --> 10:14.000]  be breaking that down but French news agency also reporting smoke at Japan
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.800]  reactor forces evacuation workers were evacuated from part of a stricken nuclear
[10:19.800 --> 10:25.720]  power station in Japan today after dark smoke that's not steam that's at that
[10:25.720 --> 10:30.360]  dark smoke means filled with the nasty ingredients that are down on those
[10:30.360 --> 10:34.560]  reactors those are the live reactors with the non-spent fuel rods including
[10:34.560 --> 10:39.680]  one reactor that's plutonium based doesn't get any nastier than that and
[10:39.680 --> 10:45.320]  remember plutonium and uranium are very heavy most of the stuff that's been
[10:45.320 --> 10:50.120]  coming over here is radioactive gases radiation attached to what they call
[10:50.120 --> 10:56.000]  noble gases that rise and so they they go up into the upper atmosphere and are
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.680]  blown here we are getting the lighter stuff in fact I wanted to do an
[11:01.680 --> 11:05.080]  illustration in fact will you guys get me a glass of water I'm gonna have to
[11:05.080 --> 11:09.480]  pour it on the table in the next segment for prison planet dot TV viewers you see
[11:09.480 --> 11:16.360]  we're now into how many days since this happened Friday before last how many
[11:16.360 --> 11:23.280]  days is it we're talking about 12 days now 12 days that 12 days since this
[11:23.280 --> 11:28.440]  happened and so you've got radiation pouring out of these heavily damaged
[11:28.440 --> 11:32.000]  four reactors they say they stabilize the other two though they've had some
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.320]  fires there as well who knows of what we're being told is true counter punch
[11:36.320 --> 11:41.120]  has a big radiological expert with an article yesterday breaking down that
[11:41.120 --> 11:46.560]  all they've got is one radiation meter a few miles away and they're just getting
[11:46.560 --> 11:53.040]  basic readings which shows that they're 1600 times safe levels but imagine what
[11:53.040 --> 11:59.800]  else is blowing out to see and then it takes very specialized devices to not
[11:59.800 --> 12:05.720]  just pick up radiation that's easy but to pick up exactly what is being off-gassed
[12:05.720 --> 12:14.120]  and so now they're reporting the soils as far away as 20 miles from Fukushima are
[12:14.120 --> 12:20.560]  1600 times higher than normal levels of radiation that they're putting off 1600
[12:20.560 --> 12:26.160]  times more radiation than is considered normal if you walk up to a rock and you
[12:26.160 --> 12:32.320]  point a Geiger counter at it you know it's supposed to be you're putting off a
[12:32.320 --> 12:38.600]  certain amount of sieverts it's putting off 1600 times that's now all over the
[12:38.600 --> 12:43.360]  Japanese press all over the Russian press all over the European press not in
[12:43.360 --> 12:47.200]  US press because they just want to tell us out of sight out of mind we have a
[12:47.200 --> 12:51.760]  government that detonated more nuclear weapons above ground and atomic weapons
[12:51.760 --> 12:56.520]  than all other countries combined and they just told us it's healthy and they
[12:56.520 --> 13:00.840]  trot out and culture to say radiation is good for you why doesn't she then move
[13:00.840 --> 13:05.360]  into the reactor core if it's so good why do you think the people running the
[13:05.360 --> 13:12.520]  nuclear power plant in China in Japan have broken down and cried last Friday
[13:12.520 --> 13:17.440]  saying this is gonna kill people this is lethal dose of radiation the brave
[13:17.440 --> 13:21.280]  people going in are going to die from this may take a week may take a month
[13:21.280 --> 13:26.160]  it's going to kill them but who cares what the nuclear physicist says who's
[13:26.160 --> 13:32.480]  broken in silence and is the plant director let's not listen to a nuclear
[13:32.480 --> 13:37.800]  power plant manager let's listen to Ann Coulter who tells us that radiation is
[13:37.800 --> 13:43.000]  good for us well yeah little sunlight's good for you that's a form of
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.120]  radiation ultra violent radiation not this type of radiation not even in the
[13:49.120 --> 13:53.840]  same family but here's the issue if I had a glass of water here and I poured out
[13:53.840 --> 13:56.800]  a little bit on my table wouldn't be much then if I poured out a whole glass
[13:56.800 --> 14:01.360]  it'd be more then if I put a fire hose in here in fact guys I'll do this right
[14:01.360 --> 14:06.000]  now on air give me a document cam shot right here 12 days and we'll have to get
[14:06.000 --> 14:13.400]  some napkins obviously we are 12 days into this situation and there is an
[14:13.400 --> 14:19.360]  entire cornucopia of nasty different types of radiation you've got the 600
[14:19.360 --> 14:24.800]  thousand spent fuel rods on fire blown in all directions huge explosions ongoing
[14:24.800 --> 14:30.160]  fires they've had to evacuate again because of smoke and then they go on to
[14:30.160 --> 14:35.920]  admit radioactive black smoke this isn't steam meaning just boiling water this is
[14:35.920 --> 14:47.600]  so filled with nasty meltdown from live high-powered live fuel rods that the
[14:47.600 --> 14:51.840]  workers who were already saying they're willing to die are pulling back and
[14:51.840 --> 14:58.480]  they're reporting 1600 times safe levels of radiation and our western news media
[14:58.480 --> 15:02.520]  here in the United States is telling us everything is wonderful so smoke at
[15:02.520 --> 15:07.760]  Japan reactor forces evacuation workers were evacuating from part of the
[15:07.760 --> 15:11.400]  stricken nuclear power station in Japan on Wednesday after dark smoke was seen
[15:11.400 --> 15:15.120]  rising from one of the reactors the plan operator said the workers were pulled
[15:15.120 --> 15:18.960]  out of the control room of reactor number three said officials from Tokyo
[15:18.960 --> 15:23.160]  power company told reporters adding that the source of the smoke was unknown
[15:23.160 --> 15:28.640]  though they admitted back last Saturday what 11 days ago Saturday before last
[15:28.640 --> 15:34.080]  that they'd had partial meltdowns at at least two now it's at four and they go
[15:34.080 --> 15:40.520]  on to talk about the increased radio radiation levels they go on to say that
[15:40.520 --> 15:45.240]  that we do have abnormal levels of radiation that's a nice way to spin it
[15:45.240 --> 15:52.480]  here's the RT headline from Japan smoke forces evacuation at Fukushima reactor
[15:52.480 --> 16:02.080]  here is another RT headline radiation at Fukushima exceeds norm by 1600 times
[16:02.080 --> 16:09.320]  that's from the IAEA the International Atomic Energy Agency who normally is a
[16:09.320 --> 16:13.840]  big white washer basically financed by the nuclear power industry worldwide
[16:13.840 --> 16:17.720]  work has resumed the Fukushima power plant after it was interrupted for the
[16:17.720 --> 16:21.320]  second time in 24 hours restoration work has been underway at the facility to
[16:21.320 --> 16:28.040]  deal with damage caused by the tsunami you mean the giant explosions Fox news
[16:28.040 --> 16:32.840]  continues to show pre tsunami pre explosion meltdown footage of totally
[16:32.840 --> 16:41.400]  intact facility now let me explain why they have 1600 times safe levels of
[16:41.400 --> 16:45.800]  radiation for at least 20 miles around and and some levels even higher in the
[16:45.800 --> 16:52.480]  soil because for 12 days it's been off gassing every form of of radioactive
[16:52.480 --> 16:57.040]  isotope I've ever read about I mean it's a laundry list and so you get the first
[16:57.040 --> 17:01.240]  leak 12 days ago don't give me a document cam shot please you get the first
[17:01.240 --> 17:04.720]  leak a little bit that that starts blowing across the Pacific towards the
[17:04.720 --> 17:08.480]  United States over here this keyboard's the United States is North America so a
[17:08.480 --> 17:12.720]  little bit goes over there and then you get the Saturday blow up that's a lot
[17:12.720 --> 17:17.960]  more and then you get the Monday blow up of the mark one plutonium reactor and
[17:17.960 --> 17:21.120]  that'd be about 50 cups of water but obviously I can't do that and wreck my
[17:21.120 --> 17:25.400]  studio and then more fires and more explosions it just keeps going all along
[17:25.400 --> 17:30.520]  and it's all going over here all going over here across the world and our
[17:30.520 --> 17:34.240]  media is telling us everything's fine and they're still saying that there's a
[17:34.240 --> 17:37.880]  greater risk from ever of total meltdown of these reactors that will be
[17:37.880 --> 17:42.880]  bigger than Chernobyl at each event and they admit that Chernobyl circled the
[17:42.880 --> 17:46.760]  earth in about 14 days and hit the United States and increased cancer rates
[17:46.760 --> 17:52.600]  but so what let's just have amculture come out and tell us everything's fine
[17:52.600 --> 17:56.720]  even though the federal government's now having to admit well these increased
[17:56.720 --> 18:00.080]  radiation levels might actually hurt children in the US a little because
[18:00.080 --> 18:03.800]  they've got faster growing cells and radiation depending on the estimate is
[18:03.800 --> 18:08.720]  more than 10 times more destructive towards young creatures whether they
[18:08.720 --> 18:12.320]  be insects or mammals it doesn't matter because they're developing more
[18:12.320 --> 18:16.880]  quickly so there you have it see this is where it all starts in Japan so why is
[18:16.880 --> 18:23.800]  it 1600 times stronger in a 20 miles circumference according to the IAEA
[18:23.800 --> 18:30.640]  around Fukushima because it continues to off gas and so you get up 50 times a
[18:30.640 --> 18:37.200]  hundred times 200 times 500 times a thousand times 600 you know 1600 times
[18:37.200 --> 18:41.520]  as it continues to build up in the soil so when they tell you oh there's just a
[18:41.520 --> 18:45.480]  little bit of background radiation hit in North America it's a continued wave
[18:45.480 --> 18:51.560]  though you get some one day more the next day more after that more more more
[18:51.560 --> 18:56.320]  so at any one time they can say at first oh it's only 25 times you know a day
[18:56.320 --> 19:00.960]  after Fukushima what it should be oh it's only 50 oh it's only a hundred oh
[19:00.960 --> 19:06.800]  it's only 200 oh it's only 400 it's only 5,000 1600 because it just keeps piling
[19:06.800 --> 19:12.960]  up piling up bio accumulating and it's going into the ocean where we get our
[19:12.960 --> 19:17.760]  fish from most the fish we get here in the United States comes out of the
[19:17.760 --> 19:22.000]  Pacific it's it's the dominant area then they the Atlantic then the Caribbean
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.600]  and the Gulf of Mexico the point is you you're not going to see fish testing
[19:25.600 --> 19:29.680]  you're not going to see people being warned this stuff builds up you've got
[19:29.680 --> 19:34.640]  a lifetime average dose of radiation but the cell phones and the naked body
[19:34.640 --> 19:39.720]  scanners and the nuclear test and the nuclear plants and they had one last
[19:39.720 --> 19:44.400]  week up in Canada released a bunch of radioactive isotopes into the lake and
[19:44.400 --> 19:48.280]  they said oh it's only you know three or four times safe levels it's fine it'll
[19:48.280 --> 19:54.560]  be diluted by the water not true so that's what's going on that's what's
[19:54.560 --> 20:00.640]  happening it builds up and they're just pouring gallons more onto the table due
[20:00.640 --> 20:04.480]  to the extreme conditions from the Japanese earthquake and the fallout of

[20:43.560 --> 20:46.720]  greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army hi Ted
[20:46.720 --> 20:49.360]  Anderson I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our
[20:49.360 --> 20:54.600]  monetary system call for your copy 800-686-2237 it's time to understand the
[20:54.600 --> 21:01.920]  system call 800-686-2237 that's 800-686-2237 America you've been warned
[21:01.920 --> 21:05.840]  for weeks we've been warning you about a single event we believe will happen in
[21:05.840 --> 21:09.480]  the next 12 months that will shake the very foundations of our nation we've
[21:09.480 --> 21:13.720]  told you about the video that details this shocking prediction so far over 6
[21:13.720 --> 21:18.040]  million people have watched this free video online have you again this big
[21:18.040 --> 21:21.360]  event has nothing to do with war or the stock market yet it could change
[21:21.360 --> 21:25.720]  everything about your normal way of life the way you shop travel invest educate
[21:25.720 --> 21:28.680]  your children and even how you take care of your health and your family could
[21:28.680 --> 21:32.000]  this really happen well the man who created this video has been right about
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.240]  many predictions in his career he was among the first to predict the collapse
[21:35.240 --> 21:39.080]  of GM Fannie Mae Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general
[21:39.080 --> 21:42.960]  growth properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy if you
[21:42.960 --> 21:46.560]  haven't taken time to watch this free video do it right now you may never
[21:46.560 --> 21:50.320]  think about America the same way again you can find the free video at end of
[21:50.320 --> 21:55.560]  America 3.com again that's www.end of America the number 3.com watch the free
[21:55.560 --> 22:01.480]  video at end of America 3.com that's end of America 3.com hi this is Alex Jones
[22:01.480 --> 22:05.080]  did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and
[22:05.080 --> 22:08.360]  secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real
[22:08.360 --> 22:12.360]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's
[22:12.360 --> 22:15.800]  true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[22:15.800 --> 22:19.720]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[22:19.720 --> 22:23.800]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[22:23.800 --> 22:28.720]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[22:28.720 --> 22:32.280]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[22:32.280 --> 22:36.080]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a
[22:36.080 --> 22:41.320]  full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com that's
[22:41.320 --> 22:51.480]  survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365
[22:51.480 --> 22:57.120]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this
[22:57.120 --> 23:04.200]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com that little girl will get fed for now
[23:04.200 --> 23:08.000]  but what if people like Glenn Beck are right about the threats we face if the
[23:08.000 --> 23:11.840]  US dollar loses its status as the global reserve currency prices on the things
[23:11.840 --> 23:16.200]  you need most will skyrocket food may be unaffordable or worse unavailable
[23:16.200 --> 23:21.240]  earthquakes economic turmoil continuing unemployment rapid inflation and even
[23:21.240 --> 23:25.040]  threats of terrorism are all reasons to let the experts at ready reserve foods

[24:00.960 --> 24:10.800]  man thanks cause he rules it can do with it as he please and if things don't
[24:10.800 --> 24:19.040]  change I think Bob Dylan's saying it better than I can man is invented he's
[24:19.040 --> 24:27.560]  doing first step was touching the moon as a woman yeah man thinks that he owns
[24:27.560 --> 24:32.360]  the earth he can do with it as he pleases big environmental groups have
[24:32.360 --> 24:38.560]  all been promoting nuclear power over petroleum based systems I'm not saying
[24:38.560 --> 24:44.360]  petroleum is perfect but it's nothing compared to the dangers of radiation and
[24:44.360 --> 24:48.760]  I was cleaning up the mess I'd made here by pouring a little bit of water on the
[24:48.760 --> 24:53.320]  table a little more a little more signifying radiation and how it's
[24:53.320 --> 24:57.360]  going across the Pacific and now already reaching Iceland soon to reach
[24:57.360 --> 25:03.000]  Europe and that it continues to build up and jaren made the point he said well
[25:03.000 --> 25:08.560]  why even clean it up you know if this water symbolizes radioactivity many of
[25:08.560 --> 25:15.960]  these isotopes last billions of years so that it isn't like water that you can
[25:15.960 --> 25:21.800]  just clean up it's something that doesn't go away another analogy would be the
[25:21.800 --> 25:27.360]  first day one piece of paper if it signified radiation was released in
[25:27.360 --> 25:32.040]  Japan then the next day a thousand pieces of paper then the next day a million
[25:32.040 --> 25:36.760]  pieces of paper pretty soon it's a big stack of paper and it just continues to
[25:36.760 --> 25:43.040]  pile up in the soil until it is now over last night they said 1600 times now
[25:43.040 --> 25:47.400]  they're saying even higher than that and it's going to be there for the rest of
[25:47.400 --> 25:52.680]  our lifetimes and beyond many of these different radioactive isotopes so
[25:52.680 --> 26:00.000]  that's the point is that it adds more of this to our environment but our
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.040]  government knows that it's invisible just like what did they do with core
[26:05.040 --> 26:10.800]  exit many times more toxic than the oil itself the crude oil so they sprayed
[26:10.800 --> 26:13.800]  millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of
[26:13.800 --> 26:20.720]  gallons of core exit on top of the oil slick so that it wouldn't be visible and
[26:20.720 --> 26:24.320]  it would go to the bottom where it could do even more damage out of sight out of
[26:24.320 --> 26:29.400]  mind see they couldn't easily hide the oil they can hide this because it's
[26:29.400 --> 26:33.840]  invisible and they can lie to you and say well the background radiation is only
[26:33.840 --> 26:39.920]  up a little bit in the United States of different you know Geiger counter readings
[26:39.920 --> 26:44.160]  but those Geiger counters don't specifically pick up on what isotopes
[26:44.160 --> 26:48.640]  are hitting or the fact that it's then going to continue to land here for as
[26:48.640 --> 26:55.160]  long as these reactors burn and explode and build up in the soil in the water and
[26:55.160 --> 27:01.840]  in our bodies in the fish we eat in the beef we eat in the poultry in the pork
[27:01.840 --> 27:08.320]  in the vegetables in the grains it bio accumulates in the soil it's sucked up
[27:08.320 --> 27:14.480]  by the plants that are then fed to the animals that we eat and that's why this
[27:14.480 --> 27:18.640]  is so dangerous so they're having to evacuate the plant again because of
[27:18.640 --> 27:25.000]  more black smoke radioactive smoke coming out and the media's answer is to
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.640]  trot out people like Ann Coulter to tell us that radiation is actually good for
[27:28.640 --> 27:35.200]  us and here is the headline in fact we're gonna come back from break and play
[27:35.200 --> 27:41.200]  this Russia Today news piece radiation level at Fukushima exceeds norm by
[27:41.200 --> 27:50.520]  1,600 times and it goes on to report that Fukushima workers managed to connect
[27:50.520 --> 27:54.440]  the first and the fourth reactors of the plant to external power source that's
[27:54.440 --> 27:58.160]  great news to help restore the cooling system at the units five of the six
[27:58.160 --> 28:01.360]  units of Fukushima plant have been connected to emergency diesel
[28:01.360 --> 28:05.600]  generators Kyoto news reported however the electricity supplied to the
[28:05.600 --> 28:09.400]  problematic third unit has yet to be switched back on the unit that blew up
[28:09.400 --> 28:12.920]  I mean you think even if they connect it the machinery is gonna be working with
[28:12.920 --> 28:16.840]  that mushroom cloud explosion you saw and the photos of it completely shattered
[28:16.840 --> 28:22.360]  a black hulk of metal steel girder sticking out or concrete will once
[28:22.360 --> 28:28.240]  reinforced it David Lindorf investigative journalist and founding editor of the
[28:28.240 --> 28:32.600]  newspaper this can't be happening explains why it is impossible to
[28:32.600 --> 28:36.640]  prevent just disasters with all the work that's going on in development of
[28:36.640 --> 28:43.240]  peaceful nuclear energy I hear people say it's a posse in that's possible to
[28:43.240 --> 28:49.280]  design these days a safe nuclear plant that has all passive cooling systems
[28:49.280 --> 28:54.080]  like light pebble so that if a power fails you still can keep the plant from
[28:54.080 --> 28:58.400]  going into a meltdown phase and maybe that's true but you have to take all
[28:58.400 --> 29:04.880]  the existing plants and shut them down they are not salvageable and they go
[29:04.880 --> 29:13.120]  on to report on the IAEA announcement of 1,600 times the International Atomic
[29:13.120 --> 29:17.600]  Energy Agency announced yesterday as I said earlier it's now gone up even more
[29:17.600 --> 29:24.760]  at the level of radiation 20 kilometers now they're saying over 20 miles from
[29:24.760 --> 29:33.660]  the Fukushima facility exceeds the norm my 1,600 times and I remember Dr.
[29:33.660 --> 29:37.760]  Bowman saying it would to really be dangerous it would have to be a thousand
[29:37.760 --> 29:41.800]  times well that's what's going on here and the food and water supplies have
[29:41.800 --> 29:47.120]  now become contaminated will continue with the latest on the reactor meltdown
[29:47.120 --> 29:52.160]  cover-up and the radiation levels then living up we're on the March the
[29:52.160 --> 29:59.440]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:00.000 --> 30:07.680]  when you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road but
[30:07.680 --> 30:12.280]  if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets
[30:12.280 --> 30:21.520]  there's a place down in Tennessee will it make blue diamond gusset jeans they
[30:21.520 --> 30:29.080]  so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit
[30:29.080 --> 30:35.480]  they put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most blue diamond
[30:35.480 --> 30:43.640]  gussets got it others don't we turn jeans inside out diamond gusset jeans made

[31:00.360 --> 31:03.720]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[31:03.720 --> 31:07.680]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[31:07.680 --> 31:11.960]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[31:11.960 --> 31:16.240]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[31:16.240 --> 31:20.600]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[31:20.600 --> 31:24.680]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[31:24.680 --> 31:29.240]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[31:29.240 --> 31:33.360]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[31:33.360 --> 31:37.320]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[31:37.320 --> 31:41.160]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[31:41.160 --> 31:43.840]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[33:07.440 --> 33:14.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones on the
[33:14.280 --> 33:26.200]  GCN radio network radiation in the water fire in the sky I want to get into the
[33:26.200 --> 33:29.480]  huge new developments on Olivia front but first I had to finish up need to
[33:29.480 --> 33:36.120]  finish up with the latest radiation fallout information and the attempt by
[33:36.120 --> 33:44.440]  the media to distract us with the war what's happening with Obama's ill
[33:44.440 --> 33:49.960]  reception by the population of South America he's cutting his trip short the
[33:49.960 --> 33:55.800]  media also trying to distract us with the NCAA garbage homeland security has
[33:55.800 --> 34:00.840]  come out and put out alerts warning everyone to look for terrorist at the
[34:00.840 --> 34:05.200]  NCAA the federal government basically taking over society in the name of
[34:05.200 --> 34:15.440]  safety also an incredible announcement yesterday via CNBC by the Dallas head of
[34:15.440 --> 34:21.760]  the Federal Reserve saying that the US is approaching insolvency and that the
[34:21.760 --> 34:25.520]  fix is to be painful the fix is to give the bankers everything and
[34:25.520 --> 34:30.200]  capitulate totally like a third-world nation so they can rob us even more so
[34:30.200 --> 34:34.800]  we're going to be breaking that down also big report put out by Glenn Beck
[34:34.800 --> 34:40.720]  yesterday that is important the left's economic terrorism playbook coalition
[34:40.720 --> 34:47.320]  destroy US capitalism and redistribute wealth this by one of the big union heads
[34:47.320 --> 34:52.320]  but that but there's a twist to this remember the economic terrorism engaged
[34:52.320 --> 34:56.880]  in by the Federal Reserve in October of 2008 when they said give us trillions of
[34:56.880 --> 35:03.520]  dollars or we will destroy the economy and I want to warn the globalist
[35:03.520 --> 35:10.040]  controlled unions that if they are successful in trying to crash the stock
[35:10.040 --> 35:14.440]  market coming up in June that the globalists will then blame all of the
[35:14.440 --> 35:20.480]  oncoming depression on you so you're stumbling directly into complete and
[35:20.480 --> 35:26.600]  total Patsyville with that we're going to be going over that as well today the
[35:26.600 --> 35:35.240]  toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231 I do want to add
[35:35.240 --> 35:38.520]  first-time callers I forgot to add that proviso I want to get first-time
[35:38.520 --> 35:43.000]  callers every few weeks a chance so we first-time callers today on the
[35:43.000 --> 35:51.880]  broadcast 800-259-9231 to finish up with the latest information on the reactor
[35:51.880 --> 35:58.640]  here is the rush it's a daypiece on the 1600 times normal levels of radiation in
[35:58.640 --> 36:07.320]  the ground and water supply of Japan out to 20 kilometers or more from the
[36:07.320 --> 36:11.040]  Fukushima disaster site where they've had to evacuate again because of radioactive
[36:11.040 --> 36:15.480]  smoke belching out of one of the reactors in the ongoing crisis here it is
[36:15.480 --> 36:20.600]  you Japan now and reports suggest workers have restored electricity to five of the
[36:20.600 --> 36:25.600]  six reactors at the Fukushima nuclear plant it comes as Japan has resumed its
[36:25.600 --> 36:29.640]  efforts to solve the atomic crisis following unexplained emissions of
[36:29.640 --> 36:35.840]  smoke artist Igor Goronov is following events the focus has shifted on to the
[36:35.840 --> 36:39.080]  impact of the radiation which has already been released the authorities
[36:39.080 --> 36:42.720]  are saying that in some of the areas around the plant the radiation levels
[36:42.720 --> 36:48.560]  are 1,600 times higher than they should be normally villages in nearby
[36:48.560 --> 36:52.200]  settlements have been told not to drink their tap water because it contains
[36:52.200 --> 36:56.600]  possible radioactive elements instead they've been given bottled water there's
[36:56.600 --> 37:00.440]  also suspicion that some of the marine life around the plant on the coast has
[37:00.440 --> 37:04.880]  been poisoned as well and that may pose some sort of risk to the fisheries we
[37:04.880 --> 37:08.760]  also had scares over the weekend and afterwards that some of the agricultural
[37:08.760 --> 37:12.200]  produce from that area may be contaminated as well now the authorities
[37:12.200 --> 37:15.720]  are saying that the levels are safe but of course there's still a level of
[37:15.720 --> 37:19.720]  anxiety amongst Japanese people and even people further abroad as to the
[37:19.720 --> 37:23.760]  possible risks of radiation of course there is still the impact of the
[37:23.760 --> 37:27.920]  earthquake in the tsunami which has recently struck Japan the police are
[37:27.920 --> 37:32.120]  saying that 9,000 people have been confirmed as dead more than 12,000 as
[37:32.120 --> 37:36.840]  missing 300,000 or more than that to remain homeless and of course the number
[37:36.840 --> 37:42.840]  of the confirmed dead is likely to grow over the next few weeks okay the nuclear
[37:42.840 --> 37:47.080]  crisis and the rest of that video is linked up on info wars.com and
[37:47.080 --> 37:55.080]  prisonplanet.com or you can simply go to RT's website RT.com and find all of
[37:55.080 --> 37:59.600]  that information and Japanese papers I don't just go with one source they are
[37:59.600 --> 38:07.320]  also confirming 1,600 times or higher now you notice that Ann Coulter has not
[38:07.320 --> 38:12.200]  taken up our offer we have called the speaking bureau that books her and they
[38:12.200 --> 38:15.840]  have basically hung up on us they've hung up on our listeners who've called we
[38:15.840 --> 38:20.160]  linked to it an article with the headline info wars.com is offering to
[38:20.160 --> 38:25.600]  send Ann Coulter to Fukushima and I think she should go to the nearby towns
[38:25.600 --> 38:30.200]  and drink the water directly out of the tap she should eat the food and she
[38:30.200 --> 38:35.080]  should ask to visit the reactor and help even though the US military's pulled
[38:35.080 --> 38:40.440]  out 11 days ago and refused to help and is talking about a mandatory evacuation
[38:40.440 --> 38:46.560]  of US military personnel and US government workers they must be crazy
[38:46.560 --> 38:53.120]  because Ann Coulter says that there's no radiation problem 1,600 times and
[38:53.120 --> 38:57.920]  growing as it continues to belch radiation all over that area of Japan
[38:57.920 --> 39:01.520]  and then most of it going out to sea towards the west coast and we're
[39:01.520 --> 39:06.200]  waiting we've called the Speakers Bureau that books her and they get very
[39:06.200 --> 39:10.360]  upset that we even are talking about getting her to travel there and that we
[39:10.360 --> 39:14.200]  shouldn't be joking around about radiation well we're not the ones
[39:14.200 --> 39:21.840]  joking around about it Ann can be a big hero and she needs to get on down to
[39:21.840 --> 39:26.400]  Fukushima and she can maybe move into one of these shattered reactors that's
[39:26.400 --> 39:31.320]  smoking and because she said she won't get cancer I mean if you get radiation
[39:31.320 --> 39:34.000]  she said the people getting this radiation we're not gonna get cancer now
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.760]  so please and I mean but please go to Japan and drink the water and maybe go
[39:40.760 --> 39:44.200]  fishing right off the coast there were hundreds of thousands of fuel rods were
[39:44.200 --> 39:49.200]  ejected out into the ocean it's just a few dozen yards away from the water and
[39:49.200 --> 39:55.080]  you saw them ejected in all directions stored on top but now I see why the
[39:55.080 --> 40:00.000]  plant owners Tokyo Power and Electric did store the 600,000 plus fuel rods on
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.800]  top of the reactors that blue sky high and and why they built the reactors on a
[40:05.800 --> 40:10.120]  fault line that's because radiation is good for you and so it's good to build
[40:10.120 --> 40:15.000]  on fault lines in a tsunami zone on the coast and it's good to store that the
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.920]  spent fuel rods on top of the live reactors because the radiation is good
[40:20.920 --> 40:25.520]  see I'm not gonna be a conspiracy theorist anymore and question thanks
[40:25.520 --> 40:29.920]  when the bill of rights is violated I'll just say that's a conspiracy theory
[40:29.920 --> 40:34.040]  when the government admits they're listening to us without warrants or
[40:34.040 --> 40:37.760]  when they set up illegal federally funded checkpoints or when the TSA sets up
[40:37.760 --> 40:42.720]  checkpoints on highways sure it's unconstitutional sure radiation is
[40:42.720 --> 40:46.360]  deadly sure de-use bad for the troops sure
[40:46.360 --> 40:51.520]  fractional reserve banking is bad for the economy but I can wave a magic and
[40:51.520 --> 40:56.960]  culture wand and then that will make everything okay and you know folks we
[40:56.960 --> 41:02.160]  don't really get into and culture here I'm not bashing her just a basher she
[41:02.160 --> 41:06.520]  is completely discredited herself and discredited some of the good things she
[41:06.520 --> 41:14.840]  talks about she says she likes Ron Paul she she says that that we should end
[41:14.840 --> 41:18.640]  some of these wars because we're bankrupt but now that kind of discredits the
[41:18.640 --> 41:24.400]  serious things she talks about by being such a willing tart for the nuclear
[41:24.400 --> 41:34.000]  power industry okay let me punch up the phone calls here JB Jamie Kevin Scott
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.560]  William and others we are going to get to you here in just a few minutes and
[41:39.560 --> 41:44.960]  I'm gonna get more into this later in the broadcast in more detail because
[41:44.960 --> 41:47.920]  there's so much news on it but right now let me just give you some of the basic
[41:47.920 --> 41:55.600]  new developments going on big France 24 television big national TV reports we are
[41:55.600 --> 42:00.640]  not at war says Phelan three days after the start of the international
[42:00.640 --> 42:06.840]  military mission over Libya French Prime Minister defended France's
[42:06.840 --> 42:11.720]  involvement in Libya during Tuesday's parliamentary debate opening the debate
[42:11.720 --> 42:17.720]  on French involvement in Libya French Prime Minister reiterated or I would say
[42:17.720 --> 42:21.640]  regurgitated the intervention was intended to stop attacks against Libyan
[42:21.640 --> 42:26.000]  civilians and nothing more he went on to say we are not at war with Libya really
[42:26.000 --> 42:31.320]  you've got ground forces preparing to invade there's bombardments all over the
[42:31.320 --> 42:36.400]  country including government buildings if that's not a war what is I guess I know
[42:36.400 --> 42:42.320]  fly zone now means a full bombardment and a prepared ground invasion and rebels
[42:42.320 --> 42:47.680]  being armed out of Saudi Arabia and Egypt through Western Egypt into Eastern
[42:47.680 --> 42:53.920]  Libya now if that isn't a war I don't know what is but the French Prime
[42:53.920 --> 42:57.960]  Minister says that it's not a war and Ann Coulter says radiation is good for
[42:57.960 --> 43:01.800]  you so yeah I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist being a conspiracy
[43:01.800 --> 43:07.600]  theorist is questioning government is being informed is not being a chump not
[43:07.600 --> 43:12.640]  being a sucker but I want to be establishment so I agree this is not a
[43:12.640 --> 43:18.400]  war kind of like we have video clips in fact get that one ready from MSNBC in
[43:18.400 --> 43:22.960]  2007 when Senator Biden soon to be candidate Biden at the time for vice
[43:22.960 --> 43:28.760]  president Biden said that if Bush attacked Iran he would move for total
[43:28.760 --> 43:33.480]  impeachment because you've got to have a congressional you really under the law
[43:33.480 --> 43:36.160]  you're supposed to have a declaration of war and then orders of the president
[43:36.160 --> 43:42.320]  but now you know they started eroding that by setting up these little
[43:42.320 --> 43:47.600]  congressional statements or these congressional authorizations that are
[43:47.600 --> 43:51.800]  these blank blank checks to use force now I mean if you're not gonna have a
[43:51.800 --> 43:57.440]  declaration of war why even have the authorization which because I mean if
[43:57.440 --> 44:00.440]  you're gonna be unconstitutional why not go the whole way why not have the UN
[44:00.440 --> 44:07.700]  last Thursday night announced that there need to be a no-fly zone and
[44:07.700 --> 44:12.800]  bombardment and possible invasion and then have the UN's past the resolution
[44:12.800 --> 44:18.680]  and then debated on Friday and then on Saturday attacks for launch on Libya no
[44:18.680 --> 44:24.160]  statement from Congress not even an attempt by the president who was busy
[44:24.160 --> 44:28.240]  getting ready to go to South America on his trip where he was universally
[44:28.240 --> 44:32.280]  decried and protested and where protesters had rubber bullets fired at
[44:32.280 --> 44:36.560]  them but again if Gaddafi fires rubber bullets at people we've got to invade or
[44:36.560 --> 44:41.600]  if Syria does but of course they lied about it strafing crowds and running
[44:41.600 --> 44:45.360]  away to Venezuela I mean the point is the guy's not a nice guy but but they're
[44:45.360 --> 44:49.600]  exaggerating they're lying and they've got a double hypocritical standard so
[44:49.600 --> 44:57.960]  that's all going on Camp Lejeune Marines to Libya local television WCTI 12 is
[44:57.960 --> 45:03.560]  reporting and they've got the Marine commander of the 26th Marine expedition
[45:03.560 --> 45:09.440]  military unit 2,200 Marines of the MEU saying their mission is to help in the
[45:09.440 --> 45:14.840]  violence in Libya and that they're being delivered to the troop landing ships in
[45:14.840 --> 45:19.240]  the Mediterranean quote in Libya right now they're doing exactly what we need
[45:19.240 --> 45:22.560]  them to do they're doing what they are told and right now that's protecting
[45:22.560 --> 45:26.920]  Libyan people against Gaddafi's forces said Captain Timothy Patrick a Marine
[45:26.920 --> 45:34.800]  with the 26 MEU and they go on to update the article the Marines put out the
[45:34.800 --> 45:38.080]  statement that the UN Security Council towards resolving the unrest in Libby
[45:38.080 --> 45:42.400]  includes the removal of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's forces from major
[45:42.400 --> 45:48.960]  cities these latest strikes by the MEU aimed at preserving the sanctity of the
[45:48.960 --> 45:53.000]  city and the safety of the civilians within an effort to safeguard the Libyan
[45:53.000 --> 45:59.360]  populace and infrastructure in and around the city of adjub by Laya I hope
[45:59.360 --> 46:04.760]  I'm pronouncing that right AJDA BIA age from further attacks by the regime
[46:04.760 --> 46:09.560]  forces the 26 MEU as part of the Joint Task Force Odyssey Dawn launched a
[46:09.560 --> 46:17.120]  second round of strikes by AV 8B Harrier jump jets and then again they're
[46:17.120 --> 46:22.480]  delivering the 2200 troops for possible ground invasion you know when that
[46:22.480 --> 46:29.920]  F-15E crashed outside of Benghazi that's Al Qaeda globalist allied held and
[46:29.920 --> 46:34.840]  that's what in Telegraph CNN the bold wonderful heroic Al Qaeda I don't agree
[46:34.840 --> 46:38.400]  with that I don't like Al Qaeda but again I'm the bad guy I'm the anti-American
[46:38.400 --> 46:42.560]  remember I don't like the troops having their death benefits stolen secretly
[46:42.560 --> 46:49.440]  11 years ago now in Bloomberg and AP I I'm evil I mean I'm really a bad guy and
[46:49.440 --> 46:52.920]  you can hate me because I'm not for Al Qaeda I'm sorry I'm not for Gaddafi
[46:52.920 --> 46:56.880]  either but I'm really not for Al Qaeda I'm not for Amaral Alaki Fox is
[46:56.880 --> 46:59.720]  reporting a secretly hanging out at the Pentagon getting orders than running
[46:59.720 --> 47:04.280]  every major attack inside the US and Europe from the shoe bomber to the
[47:04.280 --> 47:09.840]  underwear bomber to the Fort Hood killer to well just everybody involved in the
[47:09.840 --> 47:18.200]  77 bombings in London in 2005 so Camp Lejeune Marines head to Libya well the
[47:18.200 --> 47:22.400]  coalition's not going too well who's in charge Germans pull forces out of NATO
[47:22.400 --> 47:25.600]  as Libyan coalition falls apart but I forgot to finish the other point when
[47:25.600 --> 47:34.720]  that jet crashed they report that a army helicopter coming to rescue the pilots
[47:34.720 --> 47:39.840]  attacked and shot a bunch of people what shot six people but the father of the
[47:39.840 --> 47:43.600]  little boy who may have his leg amputated says he loves America hates
[47:43.600 --> 47:50.440]  Gaddafi and he understands and the pilots were were aided by local residents
[47:50.440 --> 47:56.400]  who are not fans of Gaddafi we can't say they're Al Qaeda we don't know and then
[47:56.400 --> 48:00.960]  the helicopter came and just opened up on them even though they were reportedly
[48:00.960 --> 48:04.240]  cheering them and they delivered the pilots to them but hey they're brown
[48:04.240 --> 48:09.280]  people kill them immediately and the father is like thank you so much for
[48:09.280 --> 48:16.080]  blowing part of my son's leg off that's actually in the news as well so again
[48:16.080 --> 48:20.920]  he'd be he'd make a good American he's like thank you for attacking us oil tops
[48:20.920 --> 48:26.680]  $105 per barrel oil rising again gasoline prices flat but experts say
[48:26.680 --> 48:32.280]  that they will keep climbing due to the overall increased cost of crude oil
[48:32.280 --> 48:37.120]  Obama seeks to break impasse over Libya and over the fact that a whole bunch of
[48:37.120 --> 48:40.120]  the NATO members are either threatening to remove themselves or removing
[48:40.120 --> 48:44.920]  themselves and again that's in the mail story the daily mail deep division
[48:44.920 --> 48:48.160]  between allied forces currently bombing Libya worse in today as the German
[48:48.160 --> 48:51.240]  military announced its pulling forces out of NATO over the continued
[48:51.240 --> 48:54.560]  disagreement over who will lead the campaign Germany didn't send its forces
[48:54.560 --> 49:00.800]  now they're quote pulling out of NATO partially German military spokesman said
[49:00.800 --> 49:04.120]  it was canceling two frigates in AWACS surveillance plane crews from the
[49:04.120 --> 49:07.640]  terrain and it refers that they would be drawn into the conflict if NATO takes
[49:07.640 --> 49:12.160]  over control from the US the infighting comes as a heated meeting of NATO
[49:12.160 --> 49:16.480]  ambassadors yesterday failed to resolve the 28 nation alliance should run the
[49:16.480 --> 49:20.240]  operation to enforce the UN mandated no flies on diplomats said see what's
[49:20.240 --> 49:26.240]  Obama doing here he's a globalist he hands us over to the Federal Reserve he
[49:26.240 --> 49:30.280]  takes the baton from Bush accelerates the looting giving things left cover
[49:30.280 --> 49:37.000]  suppressing his base of moronic idiots then of childlike morons I mean he's
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.520]  expanded the wars the torch of the wiretapping you so-called liberals who
[49:40.520 --> 49:45.520]  love to moralize about Bush now you hail his wars you you worship them you you
[49:45.520 --> 49:51.000]  get off on them you say it's good this is I was watching MSNBC they're not
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.800]  they were they're doing it this is disgusting but notice what Obama's done
[49:55.800 --> 50:03.640]  for the first time in America's 235 year history the president openly took
[50:03.640 --> 50:10.800]  orders from the United Nations and did not even pretend to consult Congress
[50:10.800 --> 50:15.600]  just that's totally being removed from the equation the emperor doesn't need
[50:15.600 --> 50:20.760]  his regional governors anymore that's impossible who will maintain over the
[50:20.760 --> 50:25.120]  bureaucracy fear will keep the local systems in line fear of the NATO war
[50:25.120 --> 50:31.320]  machine so he's delivered us under UN control and now NATO is taking control
[50:31.320 --> 50:36.280]  of the operation from the United States see that's what this is all about
[50:36.280 --> 50:42.880]  foreign gaggles of bureaucrats unelected running our military running our
[50:42.880 --> 50:49.800]  banking running our government JB Jamie Kevin Scott William your calls coming

[54:20.560 --> 54:24.880]  if we don't have the bill of rights and Constitution if we don't enforce it as
[54:24.880 --> 54:31.440]  the rightful sovereigns of this republic we are slaves that is the history of the
[54:31.440 --> 54:39.080]  world the history of civilization and I do not have words to express to you how
[54:39.080 --> 54:44.880]  grievous an injury to our republic it is to have nature running the military
[54:44.880 --> 54:49.760]  operations the Congress never consulted the United Nations giving the order
[54:49.760 --> 54:54.680]  those statements stand on their own just like six years ago when the SPP was
[54:54.680 --> 54:58.600]  signed the Security Prosperity Partnership for North American Union and
[54:58.600 --> 55:04.240]  it was secret judicial watch sued I talk about this a lot because it's so key
[55:04.240 --> 55:08.640]  and got thousands of pages of documents we cover it in endgame and the first
[55:08.640 --> 55:13.400]  thing in the event in the meeting is we must integrate North America by stealth
[55:13.400 --> 55:19.720]  now a month ago they formalize the North American Security Perimeter and
[55:19.720 --> 55:23.720]  publicly admitted that the treaty will have Mexican and Canadian troops
[55:23.720 --> 55:28.520]  operating in the US for civil insurrection now that's in major
[55:28.520 --> 55:36.040]  newspapers Ottawa citizen associated press no one covers it I beg
[55:36.040 --> 55:39.520]  powerhouses like Glenn Beck to talk about that but see he never will
[55:39.520 --> 55:44.360]  criticize the Pentagon it's not our military it's run by traders the
[55:44.360 --> 55:50.360]  average person the military joined because they care about liberty but they
[55:50.360 --> 55:54.560]  don't get promoted the scumbags it'll torture people to death too and then
[55:54.560 --> 55:58.840]  our name our country gets trashed when our country is being used by the New
[55:58.840 --> 56:04.320]  World Order not in our name not in the United Nations name remember Michael
[56:04.320 --> 56:13.040]  knew refusing to go under UN command in Bosnia in Macedonia now there's not
[56:13.040 --> 56:18.800]  even a discussion about this this is a big deal and I commend the drudge
[56:18.800 --> 56:22.320]  report he's been leading with it pointing out that it's unconstitutional
[56:22.320 --> 56:27.960]  but who else is covering it we are I saw it on our Facebook yesterday then I saw
[56:27.960 --> 56:32.640]  it on drudge today with Biden up there saying he would impeach anybody and I
[56:32.640 --> 56:35.800]  said I'd go to your calls but I've got to play I've got to play this clip
[56:35.800 --> 56:41.160]  here's Biden on MSNBC saying he wouldn't go after Bush for impeachment in the
[56:41.160 --> 56:47.120]  US Senate if if he launched a war against Iran without congressional
[56:47.120 --> 56:50.120]  approval here it is you said that the president of the United States had
[56:50.120 --> 56:53.400]  launched an attack on Iran without congressional approval that would have
[56:53.400 --> 56:57.080]  been an impeachable offense do you want to review that comment you made well how
[56:57.080 --> 57:00.800]  do you stand on that now I want to stand by that comment I made the reason I
[57:00.800 --> 57:05.120]  made the comment was as a warning the reason I made I don't say those things
[57:05.120 --> 57:08.600]  lightly Chris you've known me for a long time I was chairman of the Judiciary
[57:08.600 --> 57:13.440]  Committee for 17 years or its ranking member I teach separation of powers and
[57:13.440 --> 57:17.200]  constitutional law this is something I know so I got together and brought a group
[57:17.200 --> 57:20.600]  of constitutional scholars together to write a piece that I'm going to deliver
[57:20.600 --> 57:24.200]  to the whole United States Senate pointing out the president has no
[57:24.200 --> 57:29.000]  constitutional party to take this nation to war against the country of 70
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.560]  million people unless we're attacked or unless there is proof that we are about
[57:33.560 --> 57:39.920]  to be attacked and if he does if he does I would move to impeach him the house
[57:39.920 --> 57:44.000]  obviously has to do that but I would lead an effort to impeach him the reason
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.600]  for my doing that I don't say it lightly I don't say it lightly by the way you
[57:48.600 --> 57:53.920]  don't need to be a constitutional law scholar and a lawyer that's 101 that
[57:53.920 --> 58:02.320]  Congress declares war I mean that is 101 but notice Congress doesn't control the
[58:02.320 --> 58:05.880]  issuance of our currency and credit private fellow reserve does now
[58:05.880 --> 58:10.120]  Congress doesn't even have a say or doesn't even try to stand up and have a
[58:10.120 --> 58:15.480]  say that's an even bigger issue this happened last Thursday Obama went along
[58:15.480 --> 58:20.760]  with the attack Friday it's now Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday five
[58:20.760 --> 58:26.880]  days later into the attack and not a word from Congress saying hey you can't do
[58:26.880 --> 58:31.440]  that talk about a servile disgusting group and disgusting Republicans are
[58:31.440 --> 58:35.120]  all going along with it it's only a few Democrats that are against it that
[58:35.120 --> 58:41.200]  tells you everything you need to know about those servile Republicans
[58:41.200 --> 58:49.800]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[58:51.000 --> 58:55.920]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[58:55.920 --> 59:01.360]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[59:01.360 --> 59:05.160]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[59:05.160 --> 59:10.200]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[59:10.200 --> 59:15.600]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention fall
[59:15.600 --> 59:20.520]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short cartel
[59:20.520 --> 59:24.920]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[59:24.920 --> 59:28.640]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[59:28.640 --> 59:32.600]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[59:32.600 --> 59:38.160]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[59:38.160 --> 59:44.280]  the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're

[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.160]  of the birth of world government correctly only Ron Paul we've heard a
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.760]  little bit from Rand Paul that's it that's it a few Democrats truly disgusting

[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.880]  I'm doing all right a little bit of horse today for some reason man you got
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.080]  one heck of a shot I tell you man I seen your end game on they played on the
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:34.600]  network here in Houston on 55 channel and like fourth largest city was watching
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.520]  that movie just freaking out man I had people call me going wow I didn't know
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.200]  it was all coming down man that film was made almost four years ago there's a
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:48.040]  lot of Liberty loving people that own TV stations and cable channels airing and
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:52.600]  broadcast TV airing my films all over the country it's wonderful yeah they were
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.000]  I had people call me they were just totally tripping out because I've been
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.840]  talking about what you've been talking about they said well that can't be I
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:03.040]  said watch this flick you'll freak and they were just freaking out man and what
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:06.040]  I could almost normally call you and ask you you know NASA they don't throw them
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:10.320]  a bone where they can't do any more space flies won't these super-duper NASA
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:14.320]  engineers and scientists see if they can make some kind of a repair on that
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:18.320]  reactor I mean they can make stuff that unfolds in space they can make a cover
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.400]  for that thing to keep people well here's the deal they could put together a new
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:28.160]  giant dome in pieces and then weld it together but it's built on the ocean and
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:33.880]  there's a water table right there so it's going down into the water table into
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:37.640]  the aquifer in Japan that's under that they built it on an earthquake fault line
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:42.040]  one of the most geologically unstable areas in the world where they have
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:48.200]  tsunamis and stored the 39 years of spent fuel rods on top of it doesn't sound
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:53.480]  too smart well I don't see any quality safety or predicted product control or
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.280]  anything I don't see any safety in there I don't know what they were drinking what
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:00.320]  they were thinking but let me just say this NASA's not working put them to work
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:04.280]  they can fan fold a cover thing get the air cleaned out and then they can go and
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.520]  work underneath there and see if they can put some liquid nitrogen and some
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.000]  other stuff in there and take care of it the cooling of it well that's a good
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.680]  idea they could actually drill in and start pumping the water out into
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:19.000]  containers they then ship out that's a good idea but see they need the water
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.440]  there to keep it cooled but it's all shattered from the explosions so it's a
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.320]  catch-22 and they're sending in firefighters and police most the plant
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.680]  workers refused to go back in and in the warrior society in Japan though the
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:36.760]  whole samurai thing has been handed down to the firefighters and police do you
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.040]  think our cops would go go bathe themselves in the radiation that's
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.360]  gonna kill them I don't think they would I'll say this these those 50 guys are
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.520]  the probably most bravest guys ever heard of I know we got some brave guys in
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:52.200]  military here but I'm talking Bo grides he's one of the bravest but I mean you
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.080]  know and what you're doing you're brave for you know speaking your mind and all
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:59.240]  but these cats have to be over the top you know well they under their true
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:05.600]  warriors I mean that they see themselves as is basically the warrior ants in the
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.480]  anthill and they're there to die and that's what they've said but they're not
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:14.480]  trained the military and the firefighters and the police that's who they've got in
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:19.360]  there are not trained and so they're in there with fire hoses up up up against
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:24.000]  reactors that are basically boiling high radiation out on them and when they
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.200]  say 50 it's actually several hundred that they rotate through but at 50 at a
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:34.120]  time and it's it's a serious battle and I appreciate your call JB now I'm
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.320]  again this is economic news coming up for one segment and I promise I'll hurry
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:41.560]  through calls I'll try my best Jamie Kevin Scott William and others first time
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:50.240]  callers today 800-259-9231 but after the break U.S. approaching insolvency fixed to
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:54.000]  be painful the head of the Dallas Fed says we'll cover this and what it
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.120]  signifies on the other side stay with us
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.960]  Alex has told you that the mid-east uprisings over food prices and shortages
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:10.000]  caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're seeing the impact right
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.760]  here in the United States ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.760]  and fuel prices hit a 30 month high in February and pump prices are expected to
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:23.440]  reach $5 a gallon because of shipping costs food is being priced out of the
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:28.240]  reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days

[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:32.800]  calls then Aaron Dyson studio the investigation on the weather and
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:37.640]  tectonic weapon that they admit they have via the heart system in the last 30
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:44.440]  minutes of the next hour oil is up to a hundred and five dollars a barrel right
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:49.000]  now and climbing they're blaming it on Libya that obviously is not helping the
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.680]  economy food prices worldwide are at the highest increase that we've seen since
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:59.880]  1974 the year that I was born and that's fueling a lot of this insurrection
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.280]  worldwide that the globalist then piggyback on because in many of these
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:09.560]  terrible countries half or more of the income that people get in many areas like
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:13.960]  Egypt the general population makes two dollars or less a day it is basically
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:19.800]  causing them to starve now remember in the last month we've seen the Wall
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:27.560]  Street Journal the Financial Times of London we've seen Time Magazine News
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:33.240]  Week all say the end of the dollar is nigh the end of the dollar well when we
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:37.080]  lose the dollar we lose everything that's all we had left to buy all these
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:44.840]  cheap goods for our service economy and if the dollar is devalued further which
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:48.280]  their signaling is going to happen and is decoupled and phased out of the world
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:55.400]  reserve currency then we are going to have massive increases in the cost of
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:00.200]  living in a country already sliding into depression by every yardstick by every
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:05.960]  major economist we interviewed but here's CNBC.com last night US approaching
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:10.360]  insolvency fixed to be painful and this is coming from the very people that
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:14.280]  have engineered this now posing as our saviors the United States is on a
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:19.640]  fiscal path towards insolvency and policy makers are at a tipping point a
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:23.640]  fellow reserve official said last night if we continue down the path of which
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.560]  the fiscal authorities put us we will become insolvent the question is when
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:31.160]  Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said in a question and
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.800]  answer after delivering a speech at the University of
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.560]  Frankfurt the short-term negotiations are very important
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:42.680]  I look at this as a tipping point and the negotiations are cutting social
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:45.800]  security cutting the chicken feed that got us addicted to
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.480]  government and paying more and more of the GDP to the bankers
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:53.400]  so cutting overall spending for the general public
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:57.560]  and pushing that spending towards the bankers
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:01.400]  we are all mindful of this phenomenon speaking personally I'm concerned that
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:05.160]  we are going to be extremely vigilant on that front Fisher said
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.000]  in an interview I think the beginning of the process and it's going to be very
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.920]  painful that's called austerity I wanted to bring up Steve
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:16.760]  Shank who for more than 30 years has been the leader in high quality
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.480]  storeable foods grown right here in the United States
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.600]  because he is running a special for just a few weeks more
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:26.280]  he can tell us the exact dates for free shipping on all of their high quality
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:29.400]  storeable foods but I've also got him here that's one of the biggest cost in
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:33.640]  storeable foods is the shipping and food prices for him have gone up
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:38.840]  he started reporting this two years ago but he kept prices down
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:42.920]  and tried to make up for it by ramping up production
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:47.080]  you know in the free market using supply and demand to try to get ahead of this
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:50.280]  but it's really getting bad now they're not denying
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:53.960]  that food prices are exploding everywhere and as the dollar accelerates
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:57.160]  its devaluation you're only going to see not just food but every other
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:01.640]  commodity like oil go up and up and up Steve Shank good to have you here with us
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:06.840]  hey good to be with you Alex and what you were commenting about with the oil
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:10.280]  we've been running statistics for the last five years
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:17.000]  and as the oil prices go up there is an exact when you graph food prices and
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.040]  oil prices they are you might as well be looking at the
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:24.040]  same the same lines on the on the graph and
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:27.640]  what's happening is everything that you and I have talked about for the last
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:31.800]  three years all of the predictions we are literally
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:36.120]  in a perfect storm situation with regard to
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.720]  an economic failing and every all roads
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:45.800]  every single road on the economic scale leads to food it's just
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.560]  it's the determining factor in these third world countries that are falling
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:55.400]  right and left and as the american dollar does what
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.600]  we've all known that it was in the process of doing
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.440]  that is shooting food prices to the point where we have
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:05.800]  millions of american families already now we
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:10.120]  is the news media talk about the third world people that can't afford food
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:14.680]  we've got millions of american families that are in that situation and so
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:20.440]  one of the things that that we're dealing with you know in our conversations
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:24.280]  before alex we've talked about the ethanol thing
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:29.400]  blowing now ethanol which was supposed to save our bacon with regard to fuel
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:34.280]  prices is causing is causing the fuel prices to go up
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:37.720]  and by the way steve four years ago on our broadcast
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.680]  you predicted the ethanol situation the oils i mean you really knew what you
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.840]  were talking about well it doesn't take brain
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:49.400]  surgery alex we're sitting out there we're
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:53.800]  we're having to buy raw materials way out a year ahead
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:57.640]  and as we're doing that we're looking at what's happening
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.160]  as as these food prices are literally pricing americans
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:05.160]  out of of the market and a lot of the food makers have adulterated the quality
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:09.320]  they have something called called meat glue where they take chunks of
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:13.080]  meat they couldn't sell and put into fake beef
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:17.000]  steaks and actually glue it together with artificial clotting agent and slice
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.840]  it they've tried to lower food quality to to try
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:26.520]  to keep prices down but now even that can't can't cover up what's going on
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:29.560]  and you talk about perfect storm the wars the oil prices
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:33.080]  the food prices and now we've got the new bubble
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.240]  that you predicted years ago of the big multinational brokerage firms
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:42.040]  racing into food bidding the price up now you mentioned
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:45.640]  you mentioned the weather control which is fascinating
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.400]  all of the huge population countries you've got india
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:55.800]  and china they literally are in in serious trouble china is losing 60
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:59.800]  percent of its wheat this year russia the result of this continuing
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:04.760]  drought thing which means that they are literally farming america
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:08.760]  our our leaders are refusing refusing to
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:12.760]  shut down exports every other country that's short on food is shutting down
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:16.920]  exports we're allowing our commodities traders
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:21.400]  to buy up american food and sell it overseas to these large population
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:24.600]  countries that are that are buying everything they can get right out from
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.760]  under us and that's causing an addition to the food prices going up
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:33.320]  because we are having unprecedented shortages of food in a country which is
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:38.680]  now importing about 40 percent of its food to begin with
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:42.680]  unbelievable what we you mentioned the perfect storm
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:47.560]  every every single circumstance that's out there that can affect
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:51.240]  shortages of food and and boosting the price of food
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:55.720]  is in play right now including other countries buying the food out from
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:01.000]  under us this japanese tragedy is just another shock wave
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.920]  of of of letting us know with all of the
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:09.400]  conditions we can't control like the the world
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:13.240]  of the world disaster situation where we've got
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:18.040]  russia this year and droughts and others suspended all foreign shipments of
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.120]  grain because they had all those fires absolutely
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:27.320]  absolutely and the thing is china is in a situation where
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:30.520]  they are the country that tries to control weather more than any other
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:33.960]  country in the world and they can't get a terrain or snow any place
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:36.920]  where they're growing their food they're they're in deep deep trouble
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:41.240]  and that puts us in deep trouble so basically what we've got
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:45.560]  is a situation where the only choice that families have right now based on
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:51.000]  what you and i've talked about is to to freeze the cost
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.240]  and the availability of food by putting in their supplies
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:58.200]  while they can still afford them and while there's still food to buy
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.840]  that's exactly what we're dealing with this isn't this is not doom and bloom
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:06.440]  this is fact this is what we're dealing with right now
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:10.200]  i've got our buyers out there way ahead of us
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:14.680]  a year ahead out there contracting for food and believe me
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:18.360]  uh commodities buyers are out there competing with us right now
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:22.760]  for american food to feed american people many of which are
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:26.600]  starving right now now to explain that that inside baseball you've been able to
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.160]  hold down prices quite a bit when others haven't
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:34.040]  because you will bid out and buy food that hasn't even been grown yet a year
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:36.600]  in advance that's how these businesses work
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:40.280]  when they when you get big enough to be able to keep the prices
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.360]  very very competitive but look with all the depression news the war news
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.640]  i promote what i believe in and i bought a lot of storable foods from other
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:52.760]  companies it was terrible msg fillers i finally found you guys years ago
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.520]  it's super high quality and so i approached you about being a sponsor
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:00.120]  uh people need to take advantage of this deal how long are you running this
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:03.160]  this free shipping because for folks that don't know this food weighs a lot
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:08.280]  and so that's a huge part of the cost uh that you're uh knocking off here
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:12.120]  well we're running it through the 31st of this month
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:16.440]  so we've got just a few days we've got the seven or eight days
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:20.280]  but if folks will get their orders in now one of the things that we have is
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:24.360]  we've got a lot of folks realizing that they they have no choice but to try and
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:27.000]  freeze the cost and the availability of the food
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.120]  so they're ordering so we're telling folks give us four weeks on the shipping
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.760]  that's fine we'll handle it but you're not selling them old food in i mean
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:41.640]  you're preparing fresh food right now oh absolutely uh the food is
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:44.360]  prepared after we received the order just because
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.960]  we're moving so fast but we've always done that because one of the things
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:51.320]  with storable food you don't want any stuff that's old you want the full
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:54.280]  shelf life and i want to warn people there's a lot there's other good companies
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:58.360]  out there but there are a lot of them selling 10 15 year old garbage
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:02.760]  yep that's true and and the problem is is that to the average person one piece
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.400]  of dried food looks like another piece of dried food and they don't know the
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.960]  difference but we sure do and that's one of the key
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:11.800]  things people have to have good quality food because right now
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:15.640]  the decisions that people are making their life depends on it
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:19.400]  this is the first time in the history of mankind that we've had a worldwide
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.600]  situation well let me this is as serious as this
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.960]  by the way if anybody doubts they they can just google record global food
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:30.040]  shortage uh they're predicting even more riots due to this people need to be
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:35.240]  self-sufficient efoodsdirect.com the letter efoodsdirect.com

[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:27.400]  so we're gonna be breaking that down after i take some more phone calls they
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:31.400]  are reporting 1600 times safe levels of radiation
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:36.600]  as far away as 20 kilometers from the reactor

[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:10.520]  for holding hi alex um fukushima has changed so many facets
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:15.400]  um to our lives in our world and ties into libya ties into what steve
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:20.040]  shank was saying about the perfect storm um one of the layers of the danger
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:23.560]  is just how it's changed our daily lives to
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:27.400]  people now accept low level radiation is normal
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:31.240]  and implications of that are so serious
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:37.640]  in that um my fear is that well in never letting a good nuclear crisis go to
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:41.400]  waste um i can see this playing out to
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:46.840]  people i think host fukushima if um somebody was to drop a nuke on somebody
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.520]  else our perception about how that would affect our lives is different now
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:53.960]  very well said jamie you know the pentagon six years ago changed its
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:59.080]  policy and said that they're now preparing to use quote small
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:02.920]  nukes on countries as tactical weapons preemptively
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:08.760]  including plans to drop over a hundred low yield uh bunker busters on iran's
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:12.120]  mountain facilities and government facilities that are hardened
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:16.680]  and that's exactly what's happening pre-91 they wouldn't let the troops use to
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:21.720]  put in uranium emissions then they waved a magic wand and said good for you
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:26.200]  and it's the same thing here now they are actually saying uh that i mean did
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:29.400]  your gut tell you that or you were or were you already aware that you are
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.160]  correct they're actually planning this well it's actually
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:36.680]  ten months ago i watched the obama deception i set out on a mission to
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:40.120]  prove you wrong and so now i'm a daily a listener
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:46.040]  my gut tells me that um it's all part of acceptance you know like you've talked
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.000]  about many times before you accept a little bit into your lives and they give
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.480]  you more and more my gut tells me that you know
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:57.320]  two weeks ago people if you were to drop the nuke on somebody you'd have people
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:00.360]  you know um take a cast in iodine you'd have them trying to
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.160]  stock up on food as quickly as possible you'd have them
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.840]  trying to find shelters and now people just don't seem to care
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:10.840]  about radiation so people aren't going to be if you drop a nuke they're not
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:13.400]  going to prepare their lives and not try and you know
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.240]  they've taken um your natural instinct to protect
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:21.000]  yourself and your young away from us by telling us it's normal well they've
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.240]  taught people it's stylish and cool to uh be
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:29.160]  under austerity that's all over the newsstand shelves for the trendies that
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:34.200]  being bankrupt is cool having nothing is fun uh radiation is probably good for
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.400]  you it's not just an coulter and fox news saying it
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:41.000]  it's fun to have your bank accounts stolen it's fun to have wars
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.720]  torture is cool uh being a slave is fun and and they're basically
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:51.000]  selling us on uncommon sense you know they're selling us on being chumps that
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.080]  so many yuppies i run into that that that know who i am but but but don't like
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:59.480]  the show and it is the minority but they come over and giggle and laugh and
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.680]  and and they think it's real funny to be informed
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:07.800]  uh and and they think being ignorant is like a shield of infallibility they
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:11.160]  they wear their willful ignorance like a like a
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:15.160]  like a metal on their chest uh i mean have you run into that
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:18.520]  oh yeah it's it's now taboo to be worried about radiation
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:21.880]  you say you know if you're right here in washington state you know we've seen
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:25.320]  increased levels and you mention that to somebody and look at you like you're
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:28.920]  not like you're a conspiracy theorist you know like why would you worry about
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:33.000]  radiation well they can see the radiation beams
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.400]  now coming out at night shooting several miles out in different directions it's
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.520]  now confirmed major japanese tv reporting don't
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.080]  worry about the neutron beams at night you can see the blue beams
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:48.760]  it's it they can even see it it's like nutritious good
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:52.040]  and i think and culture should go sit right in front of the beam right at the
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:56.440]  opening of these blasted reactors and then she ought to drink in it
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:01.320]  fountain of youth and just just just lavish herself i calgon take me away
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:05.400]  fukushima take me away they could bottle the fukushima reactor water and
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.280]  and and women could be i guarantee you van culter told
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:11.960]  conservative women to get it they would buy bottles of radioactive water feed it
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:15.000]  to babies roll around in it i'm not joking i mean
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.440]  you go to the store it says fluoride water for babies
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:22.520]  put it in their formula meanwhile the american metal association six years ago
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.640]  came out and said do not give fluoride water to children under six but
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:31.000]  does it matter drink the fluoride drink the uranium enjoy yourselves good to

[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:48.200]  and he just didn't even know what to say i mean i'm not making that up i mean

[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:20.600]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:24.280]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.320]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:31.160]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a

[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:53.720]  coming on it's such a special guest because he lives in japan
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:58.120]  he was out of the country before this happened he's now back
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:02.680]  james corbett of the corbett report will be with us into the next hour but
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:07.240]  i promise to go to these callers so he's gracious enough to hold via video skype

[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:15.320]  to have him hold too long i promise to go to calls and forgot
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:18.840]  james corbett was coming up with the corbett report he'll be joining us here
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:22.840]  in a moment from japan but val in germany who even tried to get in
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:25.640]  yesterday i believe uh val you're on the air thanks for
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:30.280]  joining us uh yes hello
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:37.720]  yes welcome uh you're in the air force uh yes probably shouldn't be saying that
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:40.920]  but you know it's growing up a year left from getting out but i just see it on
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:43.240]  the screen i guess you told him yesterday when you tried to get in but
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:46.440]  you got through today or perhaps it was already up there from
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:50.680]  today but but regardless what's on your mind
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:54.920]  well i wanted to talk about a few things but i'll try to make it quick
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:58.920]  um as far as what's going on and super shema and in japan
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:02.840]  i have some friends that are stationed out there uh major kota
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:09.640]  and they're telling me that the military they're going door to door finding
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:14.040]  americans bringing them on to the american base
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:17.880]  bring them on military planes and flying them back to state that's how dangerous
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:20.520]  the situation is out there well that's confirmed
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:24.840]  by two days ago seeing in where the military is is considering
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:28.360]  forced evacuation of not just government but all americans
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:31.640]  you're saying you've confirmed that from your air force connections
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:37.800]  uh in japan well because of course you know they say that the japanese or
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:41.240]  you know the people who they're saying it's not that dangerous but of course
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:44.200]  you said it on your show it's been confirmed and i'm
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:49.240]  reconfirming it the situation is very dangerous um i'm going to continue to
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:52.760]  get updates of what's going on because of course i'm concerned for my friends
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:56.200]  but uh the situation is is very bad it's in the boom
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:59.720]  it's in the water but when you're telling us now what you're telling us from
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:03.640]  germany is a little more they say they're considering forced evacuation
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:07.720]  you're saying it's already going on it's already going on
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:11.400]  it's already going on not only that um in the area
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:15.160]  um i'm almost certain that a lot of the power is out
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:18.520]  except for the bases they refuse to turn off the power
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:22.600]  on the bases so most of that area is black
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:26.360]  and then you'll see like a little blip of light which is well that was in the
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:30.200]  news over the weekend that the japanese had asked people not to use power
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.920]  and that they were doing rolling blackouts but you're saying the u.s bases
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:36.440]  have still got power yeah the u.s bases still have power
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:39.080]  well i mean does this mean that finally the u.s military is going to leave
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.800]  japan the japanese government's begged for it
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:45.080]  for decades but now that they may just be completely pulling out because of the
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.840]  radiation i mean that that shows our military thinks it's it's uninhabitable
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:53.320]  i mean this radiation isn't going anywhere i mean this may be the catalyst
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:56.760]  for what they need to boot them out because like you said they're already
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:00.920]  tired of them being there um and it's gotten so bad
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:03.480]  you know the back and forth turn off the lights no we're not turning it off turn
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:08.200]  off the lights turn you know it's gotten so bad uh that
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:12.120]  i guess uh higher government in japan it's getting involved
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:15.960]  try to get them to turn off the lights but sooner or later it'll be empty anyway
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:18.680]  none of them will be or will be there
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:22.200]  so uh well val this is key information so you're in the
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:25.960]  air force in germany and you've talked to other people
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:30.600]  in germany or folks you know in the air force in japan that have told you this
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:36.280]  yes so both yes for sure have they said anything
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:40.680]  about a cover-up about the real levels of radiation
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:44.760]  the real levels of radiation i have not heard about but as the days go on i
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:47.800]  speak to more friends i find out different things
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:53.000]  that is a question i'm gonna have to ask um because
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.840]  things are moving so fast over there and friends they're just ending up here in
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:01.320]  germany because what's happening is this is like germany is like a big hub
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:04.440]  so when people deploy or things like that or they're coming back from the climate
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:09.880]  they come here first absolutely the biggest bases in europe are there
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:13.880]  and the big hospitals and the in the air bases and the rest of it so a key area
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:18.440]  val anything else you think is important that people should know
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:25.320]  well um the situation um with libya what i'm afraid of
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:30.600]  is not the airstrikes and things that are going on i'm afraid of what will
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:34.600]  happen after that because things are already scattered
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:37.960]  and the quote-unquote allies are not getting along
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:41.560]  at all despite what they say in the news
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:46.280]  they're not getting along at all and of course everyone ultimately wants power
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:49.560]  over the oil because this is just a big oil war
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:53.720]  and well i'm not going to go into that stuff
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:57.720]  let me ask you as a private citizen what are the what are the troops around you
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:02.520]  think are they excited about the war or do they not like it on average
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:05.560]  absolutely not not excited about the war
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:09.400]  at all good um they think it's a fake
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:13.000]  they think it's a phony a lot of us are getting out but we don't want to be a
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.240]  part of it this is when i say any of the military
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:20.840]  are any of the air force folks that you're there with are they concerned
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:27.880]  about the president following un orders and not consulting congress
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:31.240]  that hasn't been brought up but i'm concerned about it
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:34.840]  because they they do that because they slowly
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:40.280]  strip away at our rights and the military you know we get even less
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:45.960]  rights than the citizens all right well val val you're awesome stay in touch
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:48.920]  with us very important phone call now listen i said i got a
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:52.360]  call quickly but that one took about five six minutes and i've got our guest
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:56.200]  waiting in the wings i promise that we will go to your phone
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:00.120]  calls before this hour ends kevin scott william and others the first time

[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:30.040]  the corbett report that's uh people really have found to be extremely
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:33.480]  informative and and and and and uh in size of
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:37.320]  an online multimedia news information source

[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:57.640]  a stiff upper lip chin up uh joining us and everybody should pray
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:01.880]  uh for james corbett and his family uh james first because you said you wanted
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:04.920]  to make the announcement uh why why you weren't in japan when this
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:08.120]  happened joining us via video skype back in japan you got back
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:12.040]  yesterday and then let's get into what you're seeing on the ground there
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.800]  right well uh as i told my listeners just before i went on my
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:20.280]  little hiatus unfortunately i was dealing with the loss of my mother
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:23.560]  and i was uh going back to canada for her funeral
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:27.800]  and um incredibly enough it was just the day after the earthquake that i
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:30.840]  actually left japan to go back to canada and i spent
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:34.120]  over a week there and i've just gotten back to japan so
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:37.800]  during that time i obviously wasn't following the news very carefully so
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:41.720]  uh you were covering things i've been catching up over the last couple of
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:45.160]  days you were covering things excellently and are probably better informed
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:48.280]  about this than i am but um but i've gotten back and i'm
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:52.200]  scrambling to catch up and so now i'm back and i'm working on the corporate
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:55.560]  report again and uh conducting interviews and writing articles and
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:59.960]  well we're sorry for your loss but now now now james you were there for the
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:03.400]  earthquake tell us where you are located in japan
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:07.080]  so i am on the western side of the main island of hanshu
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:12.120]  and it's about i would say 700 kilometers that's about 400 miles from my
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:16.920]  american friends southwest of fukushima so it's uh it's quite a
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:20.680]  ways away and obviously out here we didn't feel a thing
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:23.720]  the first i ever heard of the earthquake was when i was online you know
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:28.200]  looking at news so i didn't feel a thing there was no tsunami here um
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:31.800]  it was just the images coming in and i was watching them like everybody else
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:34.840]  and at the time of course i was just preparing to go back to canada so i
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:37.480]  wasn't thinking about the the effects of the tsunami or the
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:40.040]  lasting effects but obviously we're seeing that now
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:43.800]  but as you may know i'm an english teacher here in japan i teach at
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:46.520]  elementary schools and junior high schools and
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:50.280]  today was the elementary school graduation ceremony because the
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:53.560]  school year ends here in march rather than in
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:43:00.040]  july like back home so people were having the graduation ceremony and i
[01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:03.720]  was there watching it and we had a moment of silence at the beginning of it for
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:06.680]  the the victims of the earthquake and the tsunami
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:10.520]  and it was uh it was pretty powerful during that moment of silence i was
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:13.800]  thinking about an image that i saw in the newspaper this morning and i'll hold
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:17.000]  it up for the uh prisonplanet.tv viewers out there
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.440]  for radio listeners i'll describe it it's basically someone kneeling in front of
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:24.920]  a twisted wreck of metal and it just remains
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:29.400]  and this is actually a bus that was transporting
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:34.280]  kindergarten children who were being transported away during the
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:37.320]  earthquake and they were trying to get to high ground
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:40.680]  and the tsunami came and it took over the bus it
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:45.160]  it flipped it around it landed on its side in a pool of gasoline that was
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:49.000]  leaking from a gas station and the gasoline ignited
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  and those children end up as charred cinders and
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:56.600]  these types of stories are coming out absolutely every single day and we're
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:59.800]  just seeing more and more horrific scenes
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:02.680]  from from what the devastation that took place
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:08.200]  over 24 000 now dead and missing so just indescribable scenes
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:11.720]  coming out of that part of japan and obviously i'm not there but
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:16.200]  but obviously everyone is thoughts and prayers are with those people right now
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:20.760]  including myself and and now as we speak of course the the black smoke is
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:23.560]  bulging out of reactors two and three with their
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:29.560]  deadly payload of iodine 131 and cesium 234 and cesium 237 and as you as you
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:32.280]  just mentioned reactor two is now spurting out
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:37.000]  neutron beams so it's a horrific situation and it's only getting worse
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.600]  what do you think of ant culture writing articles and going on tv with a
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:43.720]  straight face and saying this is actually going to keep us all from
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:48.040]  getting cancer and it's nutritious we have called her booking agent and said
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:52.120]  we're going to pay the fee which is a lot of money and the airline tickets
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:55.560]  everything and they get very angry with us
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:45:00.360]  i i mean i demand she go to fukushima and it's so good and drink water out of
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:04.520]  that reactor there is just no accounting for
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:08.360]  for that ghoul and and the despicable comments that she's
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:11.640]  making and i really hope that a year or two from now when there are little
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:14.920]  children dying of leukemia out there i really hope that she looks in the
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:17.960]  mirror and realizes that she has sold her soul
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:22.840]  to go and and just pimp these ideas for these corporations to which she's
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:26.280]  enslaved to it's just despicable and it's
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:30.200]  unthinkable and i i'm glad at least that no one's
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:33.640]  listening to to the things that she has to say
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:37.240]  well it's insane i mean i wonder if she actually believes it because it is
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:41.080]  insane it's it's unthinkable it's it's i mean she
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:45.480]  talked about the people in japan she said it's good for them
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:49.320]  well i i hope she'll come i hope she'll come and i'll be on i'll be here to
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:52.920]  welcome her and and you know lead her to the site so she
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:56.040]  can go and experience it for herself well i don't want you to do that we know
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:59.880]  it's deadly and and as the the plant head said last
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:02.680]  friday breaking down and crying saying he couldn't cover up anymore
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:05.400]  he said this is lethal this is going to kill people
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:08.440]  and we have gotten reports of people in and around the area with red faces
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:12.520]  vomiting uh but the japanese are so stoic a lot of them are still
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:15.720]  following orders bloomberg reports fukushima engineer
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:20.920]  says he helped cover up flaw at daiochi number reactor four that's bloomberg
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:24.040]  that came out last night one of the reactors at the crippled fukushima
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:27.240]  nuclear plant may have been relying on flawed steel to hold the
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:31.080]  radiation in its core according to an engineer who helped build its containment
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:35.560]  vessel four decades ago and uh i don't want to pronounce his name wrong but
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:40.600]  it's uh i i the article's up there on bloomberg
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:43.720]  you lived in japan now for eight nine years so you could probably pronounce
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:47.720]  it but uh dealing with this are the japanese people
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:50.600]  buying into the propaganda because first they said no problem
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:53.960]  now they admit a hundred one thousand six hundred times
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:57.960]  safe levels of radiation up to 20 kilometers away most of it going out to
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:01.240]  see towards the u.s. iceland reporting they picked up radiation
[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:03.800]  yesterday that's already gone over north america
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:08.280]  towards europe uh i mean what are the japanese saying and doing here does it
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:11.880]  concern them that the u.s. military is talking about
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:16.440]  forced evacuations of americans because it's so radioactive
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:20.760]  well uh that's i mean the the sense here is that i i think the uh the japanese
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:24.040]  people are smarter than that and and they know not to trust the government in
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:27.960]  tepco and on things like these because of course uh we've seen all sorts of
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:31.720]  nuclear disasters here from the tokai muda
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:36.120]  incident in 1999 which was again was the tokyo electric power company and it
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:39.720]  was uh they lied over and over and over again about the extent of
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:44.280]  of that disaster and people know that uh that it is a cover-up but
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:47.800]  again it's it's difficult to understand unless uh unless you've been here and
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:51.640]  know the culture but the the people here are are just not the type that are
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.760]  going to to rise up and revolt anytime soon
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:59.000]  and um and in some ways that's a blessing in some ways it's a curse
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.080]  yeah because what good would it do now i mean i just think the executives
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:07.480]  that stored 600 000 plus fuel rods on top of reactors
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:11.480]  uh they need to do what china does they need to have trials i know japan does
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:15.560]  japan have the death penalty yes it does yeah and
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:20.120]  i mean it's lethal injection correct uh i believe so yeah
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:23.320]  well i mean i think there needs to be some people getting executed over this
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:27.560]  and then next time in america in europe and japan these executives will think
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:30.280]  twice i mean they should be executed i'm going to say it right now
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:33.880]  when their own engineers are coming out and saying the recover ups and safety
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:37.320]  execute them it's that simple well i tell you what
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:43.240]  uh japan has a big long history of uh leaders committing suicide when they
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:47.160]  when they've messed up in a big way and um this is a case where
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:50.600]  they've messed up in a big way so um who knows what will happen but at any
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:54.200]  rate so the the idea that uh that the tepco and the
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:57.560]  government has been covering up what's going on and has not been releasing
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:00.840]  information and is trying to downplay this incident is despicable
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:04.680]  and if the puppet commonly known as president obama
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:09.320]  or more accurately his string pullers were were at all serious about the idea
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:13.080]  of military back human intervention they would have been
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:17.480]  out here deploying u.s military assets to to do the sarcophagus option and
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:21.480]  dropping cement on that site uh you have uh you had an excellent
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:25.720]  article up yesterday from Hiroshi Takashi at uh
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:29.080]  info wars dot com what they're covering up at Fukushima that everybody needs to
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:31.160]  go and read because he's shooting from the hip
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:34.840]  and he is a nuclear expert who's is basically saying that uh that
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:38.520]  they're they're just ludicrous trying to downplay this and uh the only
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:43.240]  real option left is is to bury that place in cement and give up because uh
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:46.840]  the idea that they're ever going to get these reactors going again is is is
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:50.520]  well they continue to explode they continue to smoke they continue to
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:54.920]  belch out intensifying levels of radiation and more and more here in the
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:58.760]  u.s the ncaa march madness and things and the
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:02.280]  libya thing is starting to eclipse this with our media telling us that
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:05.720]  radiation is not a problem uh the problem is even when it comes in
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:09.880]  in low levels it comes in over and over again as the weeks draw on
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:14.440]  it's the cumulative same thing in japan first it was 25 times then a hundred
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:18.280]  times then 200 that's 400 now it's 1600 times
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:22.280]  in these areas because it continues to fall on the ground and build up
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:27.400]  that's the cumulative effect that's what's so dangerous about a meltdown
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:31.480]  that's exactly right it's it's not even the the plume itself which uh
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:35.160]  but i i hate to say this but luckily for me where i am
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:38.920]  it's heading east which is horrible for for everyone in north america obviously
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:42.120]  but it's not even the plume itself it's just the the fallout that's coming out
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:45.960]  around that plant is going to be in the soil for thousands of years as as we
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:49.400]  know well billions really the half-life of this some of these elements and
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:53.000]  and it's uh going to contaminate the food supply it already is and the the
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.360]  wastewater from these uh reactors are coming out straight into the pacific
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:00.920]  uh stay there stay there uh james corbett corbett report i'm alex jones
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:04.440]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:08.200]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:11.720]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:14.440]  silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:17.400]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:20.600]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:23.720]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds

[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:26.840]  it was very hard to pick the winners but we'll be doing that at the very end of
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:30.520]  the transmission today i i want to go to calls but we're
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:33.720]  going to do that when we come back at the start of the next hour in t-minus
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:36.520]  five minutes with kevin scott william and others but
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:39.400]  other points you know because i'm asking some questions here what do you want to
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:44.600]  talk about what's on your mind dealing with the devastation i mean obviously
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:47.240]  these executives government people that push this
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:51.400]  they should all commit sepicoe or be executed i'm not a person that would
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:54.920]  ever commit suicide i love life but if i was one of these reactor
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:59.160]  people that had lied and done this i don't know how i could live with myself
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:02.200]  i mean it's it's and i'm not here just calling for retribution
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:06.200]  they need to be punished so that other executives around the world realize
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:08.840]  they're not going to get away with this stuff
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:12.040]  absolutely there is a precedent being set here and let's hope it's not a
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:15.560]  precedent that these companies will get away with this with impunity as people
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:19.080]  start dropping like flies from this rate deadly radiation
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:23.320]  but one thing that i want to ask is that i'm not here claiming to be an expert
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:26.280]  on what's going on or saying that i have all the answers but i want to be an
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:29.400]  information resource for people especially
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:33.000]  english speakers in japan to try to get information about what's going on
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.160]  so i have put up an article today resources related to the fukushima
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:40.360]  nuclear crisis that has some some online resources some
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:44.360]  radiation monitoring levels and things that people can use if they're
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:48.520]  here in japan also some some other details like the
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:53.720]  xenon 133 plume spread that you posted on prison plan at the
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:56.520]  other day i've got that up there too i want
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:59.400]  more resources more online things that people can use
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:03.000]  to check radiation levels and things like that so if if people out there know
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.240]  of any please contact me through the website
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:10.360]  also if people have ideas for guests or for interviews for me to conduct i'm
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:13.560]  all ears about that too and another thing that i think is really important
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:17.320]  i'd i'd really like to direct people to some sort of organization that's
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:21.000]  providing aid and relief to the people over in the stricken area of
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.120]  northeastern japan but i uh i just don't know what
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:27.560]  organization to recommend at this point obviously we know about the red cross
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:31.320]  and the way that it's handled donations in the past so i don't want to start
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:34.520]  recommending groups without knowing anything about them so if people
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:37.720]  know of any groups or can direct me to some i'll have to start interviewing
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:41.240]  representatives and seeing if there's a recommendation i can make because
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:45.080]  obviously people their need our help
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:48.360]  absolutely i mean at this point it's important to give the problem is the
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:51.240]  red cross united way have been caught giving the gun grabbers
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:55.320]  with the money and normally keeping about half of it i think small churches
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:59.720]  local community organizations local state uh prefecture governments i think
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:04.760]  that's the ticket and to just give i know my wife's given some online and
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:08.760]  she's tried to do her best uh we're trying to get together a shipment
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:13.160]  we held back some of the potassium iodate uh and didn't sell it that we're
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:16.440]  trying to get shipped to japan but to the right group
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:19.960]  we're in there um trying to get that together
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:23.320]  perhaps you can recommend a group because i know japanese were ordering it from
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:26.440]  us and i thought wow i don't want to have them order it from us
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:32.600]  oh yeah we held back about ten percent or so of it to try to ship the japan and
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:36.360]  then we get so busy we flounder i floundered around finding where to
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:42.280]  ship that into japan maybe i can ship it into you and you can get it to them

[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:14.360]  calls let's talk to kevin in new york kevin thanks for holding it on the air
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:17.800]  hi there i gotta tell you it's a pleasure to talk to you uh
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:22.840]  true patriot well i'm just trying to be a you know half moral person i mean i
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:25.160]  don't really deserve any credit i'm just doing my job here but
[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:29.640]  what's on your mind sir oh listen i i i actually had something that i want to
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:34.760]  talk about but i uh during the uh first segment of your uh of your show
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:38.440]  you mentioned something that i'd rather talk about instead uh which is uh
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:41.640]  you had mentioned something about uh you know about uh
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:47.640]  uh became their uh rallying together uh constitutional scholars uh uh in the
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:53.960]  midst of uh bush error there and uh well you know it seems to me uh
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:58.680]  you're too good that uh obama had said he was some kind of constitutional
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:03.000]  scholar didn't he yeah he taught constitutional law
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.680]  at one of the universities uh i forget which one i think it's harvard was it
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:09.720]  yale he went to harvard but but the point is
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:14.040]  they know that it's unconstitutional to have the un give the order to attack
[02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:17.800]  libya and then not even consult congress and then congress
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:22.600]  lays down to it which is even more incredible amazing precedents being set
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:26.200]  right now and they're moving to have nato actually command the whole
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:29.240]  operation with no consultation with congress
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:34.920]  james corbett what's your take on that absolutely well if the president obama
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:38.440]  is the example of constitutional scholars i think we can do with less
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:43.800]  constitutional scholars um that we just uh it's unthinkable that the idea that
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:47.560]  the commander-in-chief who is some sort of constitutional scholar is waging
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:51.480]  this completely unconstitutional at military action right now
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:56.840]  well why do we even have a congress if uh they're just ignoring the law of the
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:01.960]  constitution and we're now taking direct orders i mean when the u n set attack
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:08.040]  obama said you say jump i say how high i mean it is completely groveling
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:12.520]  why don't we just appoint him lord emperor and just have done with it
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:15.880]  well that's basically what he is his lord emperor i mean what would happen in
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:19.160]  japan if the emperor started telling that the uh diet
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:22.840]  what to do there there would be a big scandal i mean the president has become
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:26.920]  an emperor who is a servant of the un
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:29.560]  absolutely and and that's one of the good things about the people here in
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:33.240]  japan is that they're not lying down to the emperor they don't they don't
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:36.840]  worship him anymore and they they certainly there's a lot of
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:40.120]  protest even at school ceremonies and things where people have to you know
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:43.000]  look at the flag and sing the national anthem there are still a lot of teachers
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.760]  that won't do it so there are a lot of people who still realize what what all
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:50.600]  of that means and and are not happy with uh with the idea of monarchy
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:54.280]  yeah swearing allegiance to japan is not about swearing allegiance to some
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:58.520]  emperor absolutely that's absolutely right and uh
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:01.880]  and i'm glad that the japanese people don't buy into that well you know the
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:05.800]  japanese elite uh have some of the from the statistics i've seen
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:10.760]  some of the biggest uh separation between the wealth of the population and
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:15.400]  the ultra rich they already own the place why would they greedily build
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:19.880]  reactors on fault lines on the beach when they know tsunamis come in they
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:24.040]  acted surprised that a tsunami came with an earthquake
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:27.240]  yeah they're only acting surprised now because they they've gotten caught in
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:30.520]  the midst of this terrible tragedy but but obviously
[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:34.040]  it's it's unthinkable the the things that they're doing and
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:37.800]  and it's going to lead to more disasters when we come back i'm gonna get your
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:40.680]  take on the japanese people what you're hearing from them living in japan all
[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:44.680]  these years where they want the future of nuclear
[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:47.800]  power to go in japan and by the way this
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:51.800]  tokyo power and electric is set to build three to four reactors in south
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:55.800]  texas on our hurricane ravaged coastline
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:00.680]  it's not as bad as we don't have a lot of earthquakes so i guess it's better

[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:36.280]  james corbett of the corbett report uh he's also an english teacher there in
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:41.640]  japan lived there since 2004 he's there now
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:46.440]  and what are japanese saying about nuclear power and its future there
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:49.960]  well perhaps i'm a bit biased because i've interviewed a lot of people
[02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:54.280]  anti-nuclear people from my website and i've been to hiroshima a number of
[02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:57.480]  times and and obviously the hiroshima peace
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:01.480]  institute and other places like that people are obviously very much opposed
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:05.480]  to to the idea of nuclear weapons of course and nuclear
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:10.040]  power is of course an adjunct of that and we see that in things like the mox
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:13.720]  fuel which of course is just spent weapons grade
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:17.320]  plutonium being used as fuel for these reactors so
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:21.320]  there is a huge anti-nuclear movement here and a very strong one as you could
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:23.880]  imagine and for anyone who hasn't visited the the
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:29.080]  hiroshima peace museum it's a it's a harrowing experience and one of the
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:33.080]  most striking things to me the one that really started to choke me up when i
[02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:36.440]  was there is at the end of the the museum as you're
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:39.960]  as you're you've seen all of this devastation and carnage that was
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:43.480]  produced by the bombs and then as you're leaving there's a wall
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:49.640]  and it's a just a huge wall of just a replication replicas of letters that
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:53.800]  the the mayor of hiroshima has sent every single time there has been a
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:56.920]  nuclear test the mayor of hiroshima sent a letter to the
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:00.520]  that government the president or prime minister of that country and
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:04.360]  pleads with them to to stop doing it and it's just the letter after letter
[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:07.240]  after letter after letter and you see hundreds of letters
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:10.440]  pleading for the end of the abolishment of nuclear weapons
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:14.120]  we're going to put up on it is powerful we're going to put i've seen video of
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:18.760]  it we're going to put up on screen a graph of
[02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:24.040]  nuclear test over 300 by the u.s. total more than all other countries combined
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:28.120]  and it was citizens protesting worldwide that stopped the above ground
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:31.560]  test and it shows the new world order eugenics
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:36.840]  eugenicist mindset in that they would drop two a bombs on japan and it came
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:39.720]  out later that they were unconditionally trying to surrender
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:42.920]  for at least a month in private safe phase
[02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:48.440]  face-saving communicates to the west they've been firebombed end to end with
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:52.520]  their paper and woodhouses the firebombing in one single day
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:56.440]  in one event a few months before hereshima nakasaki killed the reports i
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:00.760]  saw more than 300 000 people actually more devastating the two a bombs
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:03.800]  they dropped on hereshima and nakasaki that day
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:08.920]  but they did that as a power play and in the globalist they didn't care about
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:12.200]  about the japanese and they didn't care about americans
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:16.040]  with 300 above ground test more than 300
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:20.760]  and above ground test all over the pacific radiating our own troops everybody
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:23.960]  else those islands are still highly radioactive
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:27.800]  today i mean what type of new world order person
[02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:31.480]  soils their own nest i mean what's wrong with these
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:34.520]  with these globalists what's going on with them because they're they're hurting
[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:38.040]  themselves as well they absolutely are they're
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:41.720]  destroying the the environment of the earth itself and it makes you wonder
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:45.880]  what their what their end end game really is because it can't involve
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:49.080]  living and functioning as a human being on this planet they're obviously
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:52.600]  working towards their transhumanist ideal of merging with the machines and
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:56.600]  propagating out into space and and it just goes to show the absolutely
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:59.320]  self-destructive mindset of these people and anyone who's
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:03.000]  siding with them really has to has to do a double check and look in the mirror
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.200]  and ask why they're saying things like radiation is good for you and other
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:10.760]  such despicable lies like that as as people start to die in
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:16.360]  increasing numbers as the soft kill gets ratcheted up into hard kill
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:20.120]  well very well said and by the way you just quoted some of the top transhumanists
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:23.480]  that we have an end game it's all over their literature by
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:27.000]  Nobel Prize winners top scientists about how
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.760]  anything we do is natural if we destroy the earth that's evolution because we
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:34.840]  were a species that developed if we cease to be humans and merge with
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:38.680]  machines which is their goal and they exterminate the rest of us
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:42.600]  that's a good thing i've talked to people that work at IBM
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:46.520]  and i say well what about their human genome project all this gene splicing
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:49.960]  and they said well whatever humans do is natural because that's part of our
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:54.440]  mutation that we make this and it it it's this argument
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:57.960]  where we're not supposed to have a say and no i do have a say
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:01.800]  i'm not going to eat your gmo food stop pushing it on me i don't want a nuclear
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:05.000]  reactor in my neighborhood we have one in austin that nobody knows about
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:09.080]  up at the jj pickle center i've had enough of it
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:12.760]  oh stop being such a luddite alex you should just sit there and take it and
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:16.840]  and you should enjoy nourishing all these nourishing wonderful gmo's and all
[02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:20.280]  this wonderful technology that's being unleashed on us right now and killing
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:25.000]  people in higher and higher numbers this is what you want this is what you'll get
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:28.760]  it certainly is and you guys pulled up on wikipedia the total number the other
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:31.240]  day uh they're showing a map on screen of
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:34.680]  just a hundred tests in the u.s alone in nevada
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:39.240]  i know the total number is over 300 by the u.s it's over 200 by all other
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:43.400]  nations russia france uh england france did a lot
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:50.680]  just incredible scott in idaho scott you're on the air go ahead sir
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:54.840]  hello alex yes sir welcome well thank you very much
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:58.840]  first of all i want to thank you and your uh activists listeners for your
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:02.680]  efforts in the battle for liberty and the cause of freedom
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:07.080]  you've uh followed the encouragement of thomas jefferson who encouraged us all
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:10.600]  to educate and inform the whole mass of the people
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:16.280]  for they are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:20.360]  ecclesiastes tells us alex that a wise man's heart
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:25.000]  discerns both time and judgment and your heart has discerned both the time in
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:28.840]  which we live and the crisis that we currently all face
[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:32.120]  the word judgment in that verse comes from the heber word
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:37.560]  crisis from which we derive our english word crisis it denotes an experience
[02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:42.120]  and time of crucial testing and has reference to the experience
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:45.880]  one undergoes out of which a decision or judgment
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:49.720]  is made and we all now have a decision to make
[02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:53.480]  uh do we want to go along uh to get along
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:57.800]  uh do we want to go along with the insanity that has enveloped
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:01.720]  uh the planet where the tsa putting their hands down our pants with the
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:06.440]  radiation with the gmo with the wars with the un
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:09.800]  ordering our country to attack and the congress not involved
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:13.800]  they the globalists understand these natural laws and they are testing us
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:19.800]  and setting these wicked wicked precedence it's all coming down now alex
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:23.320]  uh and you've been talking about it for many years i think i've been
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:27.960]  listening uh to you and posting your article since 1995
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:31.960]  the new world order agenda the police state endless undeclared wars
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:36.920]  surveillance society eugenics slash population reduction economic
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:40.120]  collapse it's all happening before our eyes
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:43.000]  right now and that's how history works my brother
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:47.480]  is that everything comes at once and everything we've seen is only the birth
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:52.120]  pains the build up even what we're seeing now is only the build up i mean
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:57.080]  it's incredible it's absolutely uh mind boggling
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:15:59.720]  absolutely mind boggling i just want to touch on a
[02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:03.240]  uh a one a couple things here uh first of all
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:08.040]  uh this is all happening uh to us uh individually because we have not
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:12.120]  heated uh the warnings of history we have not heated the words of our
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:15.640]  wise founding fathers uh the words that were spoken at
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:19.720]  nuremberg and the words of eisenhower who warned us about the
[02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:23.480]  military industrial complex uh abraham lincoln
[02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:27.160]  warned us about the time in which we live in 1864
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:32.440]  he said and i quote i see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:36.520]  me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country
[02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:40.040]  corporations have been enthroned in an era of corruption
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:44.600]  in high places will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:48.520]  to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:53.240]  of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the public
[02:16:53.240 --> 02:16:56.200]  is destroyed and that's a real quote on record god bless
[02:16:56.200 --> 02:16:59.880]  you i appreciate uh your call and you can see
[02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:04.680]  lincoln two-sided as a tyrant of federal power
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:09.400]  but at the same time he did issue our own currency and was killed over it
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:13.160]  and was his own man and again i'm a southerner and my
[02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:16.840]  my ancestors were on the side of the south it doesn't mean the north was
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:20.600]  right or the south was right the british intelligence this is mainline
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:24.280]  history but it's taught in phd level it's but it's mainline history books
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:27.320]  this is not debatable british intelligence came in and
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:31.160]  fomented the south who was being wronged by tariffs
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:35.720]  that were unfairly uh placed on them and not the north
[02:17:35.720 --> 02:17:38.760]  they were manipulated into that war and the british put
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:44.440]  what was it 19 000 troops in up in toronto threatening to invade
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:48.040]  trying to get uh the breakup of the country
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:50.760]  and then the czar had to send his fleet in to threaten
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:54.040]  the british not to do it and that caused a big rift that didn't cause the
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:56.760]  british intelligence to fund the communists going in
[02:17:56.760 --> 02:18:00.680]  uh you know many years later in 1917 to overthrow
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:05.640]  their cousin uh czar nicolas and then it's when you know history you
[02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:09.000]  understand all this uh james i'm gonna keep you all the way
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.680]  to 30 after but comments on what the caller scott just said
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:17.160]  well i think he was absolutely right this is a judgment this is a crisis and
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:20.760]  if there's ever a time for humanity to step up to the plate and take a swing at
[02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:24.520]  it now is the time and this isn't a game anymore and there's there's
[02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:27.640]  there's no sitting on the sidelines people better understand that the uh
[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:31.320]  the the hour is near and uh they better decide which side they're on
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:35.320]  and i know which side i'm on they were neither hot nor cold so i spit you out
[02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:40.280]  of my mouth folks choose a side consciously choose what side you're on
[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:43.720]  your gut tells you and i know a lot of you got a tingle right now and your gut
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:47.320]  and and in the back and the hair on the back of your uh neck is standing up
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:51.480]  because deep down you know the choice is here a spiritual choice doesn't mean
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:54.520]  we're all perfect doesn't mean we have all the answers but just like king
[02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:57.480]  david did a lot of bad things at the end of the day
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:01.560]  his heart was right he was a good person who loved god and loved righteousness
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:05.080]  yet a fake christianity is about a bunch of judgments
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:09.720]  and a bunch of Pharisees picking on each other and saying i'm better than you
[02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:14.440]  and and following a bunch of written law instead of getting the law written on
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:18.520]  your heart okay and and number one it's empathizing
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:22.920]  with the the downtrodden it's being against aggressive wars
[02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:28.200]  it's being against poison food and water it it's it's being against things that
[02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:33.640]  are that are wicked evil is not sexy and cool it's destructive
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:37.560]  and and i don't want to get into preacher mode here it's just
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:42.280]  folks we are so wicked myself included we are all immersed in evil
[02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:48.440]  what is evil it's anti-life it's that simple lovers of death lovers of lies
[02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:52.200]  lovers of corruption you know they were wise in their wickedness
[02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:57.880]  but ignorant uh when it came to you know uh discernment
[02:19:57.880 --> 02:20:00.920]  we're gonna come back with james corvett talk to william and others
[02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:04.280]  do you want to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead have
[02:20:04.280 --> 02:20:08.040]  you ever thought about actually getting off the grid and becoming truly
[02:20:08.040 --> 02:20:11.240]  self-reliant introducing off the grid news a weekly
[02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:15.080]  newsletter for independent americans who want practical advice on how to
[02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:19.000]  survive and even prosper in an increasingly dangerous world
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:22.760]  it's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness survival

[02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:55.240]  time the whole interview is up at info wars.com but
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:58.600]  Aaron's got a lot of audio clips but i want to just play short parts of it and
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:02.200]  then go into mainstream news articles showing that we weren't being told the
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:05.960]  whole story by him and the weather modification and the fact that
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:09.800]  dubai and others are now using harp type arrays to manipulate the weather
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:14.120]  they admit that that's what this does now it's one of the things that it can do
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:18.840]  uh... james i wanted to uh... cram in a few final calls here uh... for you
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:23.080]  uh... with uh... william pamm berry luke nick will get to all of them
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:25.720]  uh... coming up even if we have to go into overdrive today
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:28.840]  uh... but any other points you want to add from japan
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:32.600]  well let me just confirm something that a caller was making on uh... a point that
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:35.640]  it would color and it was making a couple of days ago on your program that uh...
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:40.280]  the the school children here are still playing outside at recess playing in the
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:44.520]  rain and uh... still being served milk every day at the outside mukashima in
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:47.640]  the little town right there right yeah i know i've
[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:50.760]  i've just reading reports about the uh... the graduation ceremonies that are
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:54.120]  having evacuation centers there and uh... there's there's no reports whatsoever
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:58.040]  that that that any sort of precautions are being taken and i can't
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:01.720]  report that they the kids are drinking their milk every day just like always
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:05.160]  and we know that milk uh... is one of the
[02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:08.520]  the key transmitters of the i-dime 131 radioactivity so
[02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:12.200]  and that was but you're a conspiracy theorist and so are the scientists that
[02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:16.360]  made them ship milk in for six months after all over europe from outside europe
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:19.880]  because of the bioaccumulation is that they're all evil conspiracy theorists
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:23.240]  too and culture is right that that milk is good
[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:27.400]  yeah absolutely we should be drinking it up and loving it but it's just mind
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:31.160]  boggling to me that no one's even thought to point this out or to to make any
[02:26:31.160 --> 02:26:35.560]  sort of fuss about it so it's it's going on right now and i can report that
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:39.560]  well definitely get you to pop in later this week or next week uh... as well
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:42.440]  uh... as our guy on the ground there in japan
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:45.160]  uh... let's talk to william in washington uh... william you're on the
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:46.680]  year
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:49.720]  hi y'all how are you doing today pretty good
[02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:53.800]  alex uh... you know my family came around to me flower too and we go all the
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:56.520]  way back we had both sides under civil war and
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:00.600]  i got three kids and two grandkids and as well so i i i i'm watching what's
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:02.600]  going on here i'm listening to your show and
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:05.720]  and i'm really concerned about this uh... situation in japan i know that
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:09.960]  this radiation is cumulative and that it'll build up in our food chain and
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:13.720]  it'll build up in our bodies organs and in our children and it'll be very nasty
[02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:18.040]  down the road my question is where's the united nations on this
[02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:22.120]  where's our congress on this where's where's our elected leaders on this
[02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:24.120]  why aren't they saying to japan right now
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:27.560]  you've got to do what they did with shinobu throw massive amounts of standing
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:32.360]  concrete and stop these leaks right now
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:36.840]  what do you think about that james he's exactly right absolutely suddenly
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:40.600]  when when the there is the need for this type of international agency there
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:43.880]  they're turning tail and running and uh... the i a e a chief just came out the
[02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:47.320]  other day and said well we're not an agency that will deal with crises like
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:51.160]  these were not designed to respond to the way the military is here to protect us
[02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:55.400]  supposedly they've got assets and mbc assets
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:59.000]  for nuclear chemical biological all over the pacific all over south korea all
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:02.760]  over japan and notice we're not getting any u.s government readings
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:07.320]  and they've got the specialized devices that pick up the exact isotopes
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:11.240]  and could be giving us pure forecast but we're having to rely on
[02:28:11.240 --> 02:28:15.000]  private universities in france and england to do it
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:19.160]  absolutely it's it just gives the lie to the idea of humanitarian military
[02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:22.760]  intervention if there was ever a time for it it's here it's now but it's not
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:26.120]  happening it's happening over in libya so we know what that's all about
[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:29.320]  oh yes very very humanitarian backing up al-qaeda
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:37.080]  uh... let's talk to pam in indiana real quick pam you're on the air

[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:07.560]  outside of my house and i've had all the windows and doors closed so i need to
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:11.960]  know the actual radiation levels here in northern california at any given
[02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:15.960]  location not the low harmless levels of the apologist
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:20.360]  the nuclear industry are telling us and how we can find this out for ourselves
[02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:25.880]  we've ordered the ki um and we have that now was put take 130 milligrams it sounds

[02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:40.920]  uh but they do have radiation meters at universities and government and they're
[02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:44.280]  not really giving us specific numbers they're just saying it's low elevations
[02:29:44.280 --> 02:29:51.320]  not dangerous uh dr bob bowman said basically 200 times safe levels
[02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:55.160]  we're on the march the empire is on the run

[02:32:51.320 --> 02:33:13.720]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[02:33:13.720 --> 02:33:16.440]  okay shifting gears because we've covered
[02:33:16.440 --> 02:33:22.680]  harp more than a hundred times over the years probably 15 times this year so far
[02:33:22.680 --> 02:33:27.480]  but heart the government is very secretive
[02:33:27.480 --> 02:33:31.320]  about what harp does and they've got harp arrays not just in Alaska but all over
[02:33:31.320 --> 02:33:34.760]  the world and it's over the horizon radar
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:38.280]  it's weather manipulation and the secretary of defense coen admitted in
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:40.920]  97 that they do have earthquake weapons and
[02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:44.360]  there's been a lot of news articles about australia developing in israel
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:47.960]  they've got all sorts of different systems but in the last year there's been
[02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:53.480]  a mail online story london telegraph uh arabia business
[02:33:53.480 --> 02:33:57.320]  Abu Dhabi back scientists create fake rainstorms
[02:33:57.320 --> 02:34:00.600]  and in the mail online article they have government graphics
[02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:04.920]  of these big antenna farms that are just like harp same technology
[02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:08.040]  that they admit is for weather modification and you can scroll down in
[02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:11.560]  that article have scientists discovered how to create downpours in the desert
[02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:14.760]  and then they say yes they have and it shows
[02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:18.040]  the graphic of the exact type system they have
[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:21.160]  in alaska they've also have them in northern europe russia has them the
[02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:23.880]  chinese admit they have these and use them
[02:34:23.880 --> 02:34:28.120]  and then they're not sure what it does they can mess with things locally that's
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:31.240]  admitted but then they don't know the butterfly effect
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:35.640]  in the whole weather system around the world and what it does the ionosphere
[02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:39.480]  all of this now we dug up the interview with the director of harp
[02:34:39.480 --> 02:34:42.280]  and it was during the breaks i hadn't heard this in four years
[02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:46.360]  that they had this pr kernel come on and break in and say you can't talk about
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:49.480]  that uh erin has done deep research on this and found
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:52.760]  that uh what this guy was saying he did interviews before my interview
[02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:55.800]  we can't find any after but we found different statements from him in
[02:34:55.800 --> 02:34:59.960]  previous newspaper interviews from what was on with us we plan some clips of it
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:03.800]  his audio wasn't the best and this we just found a kind of cruddy mp3 of it
[02:35:03.800 --> 02:35:06.360]  on the web i guess we got rid of the high quality ones
[02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:09.480]  that we had but erin i'm going to try to give you the floor the limited time
[02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:12.760]  to go over this the point is harp is more than they tell us because countries
[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:16.280]  have deployed the same technology the same patents and admit it's for weather
[02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:20.280]  manipulation erin break it down yeah i mean first of all we spoke with dr
[02:35:20.280 --> 02:35:23.000]  nick beggage we went up to alaska to interview him
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:27.560]  and i and do and uh jacobson all our video editors have read his book
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:31.320]  so we know there's bernard eastland patents talking about weather manipulation
[02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:34.600]  you've got a special report coming out the next month at prisonplanet.tv
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:38.040]  that's right yeah and and the applications of harp for
[02:35:38.040 --> 02:35:42.920]  uh disrupting communication systems either from the enemy or from the home
[02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:46.920]  country disrupting missiles etc there's all kinds of uses
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:51.080]  and here we have these air force research laboratory directors including the guy
[02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:55.400]  you interviewed who claim it's only for research only for the high frequency
[02:35:55.400 --> 02:35:58.680]  oral research the aurora borealis type effect
[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:02.920]  that is all based on the radio frequency ionospheric heating that's just the
[02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:07.640]  catalyst for all the potential uses of this uh technology
[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:10.600]  and furthermore it's all in the patents this is not our opinion
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:15.000]  yeah and i've got all these research papers they're in the elf and vlf waves
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:18.760]  which are extremely low frequency and very low frequency
[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:22.600]  the exact opposite which study show can also manipulate the human brain
[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:26.360]  that's true and that that's what triggers earthquakes if indeed that is
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:30.040]  being done which we know it can be done based on the quote you discussed
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:33.240]  and furthermore it's the opposite of the high frequency
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:37.400]  which is associated with the oral effect and we can read those papers later if
[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:40.360]  you want but we have the clips uh the first clip
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:44.760]  he denies that there's any association between harp and weather modification
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:49.320]  in the other clip he denies that harp has any other quote tentacles
[02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:52.440]  and that he's the directorate and knows about everything about the program and
[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:57.800]  that there's nothing secret etc etc and uh then you also have a clip where you
[02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:00.840]  discuss the aurora effect uh that's also interesting nothing
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:04.760]  secret they just won't let media in there yeah and furthermore begatius book
[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:08.520]  has this whole report that was uh produced out of their very handscom
[02:37:08.520 --> 02:37:11.640]  air force base which is in massachusetts non-alaska by the way
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:16.280]  that's where he said and they have a whole huge uh very large publication
[02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:18.760]  which they claim doesn't exist and can't be released
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:22.200]  i could pull that quote if we also want but here in an article about this
[02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:24.520]  yesterday with all this stuff linked in it
[02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:29.240]  yeah but i found even more overnight as well and if you go to the scientific
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:32.600]  and uh scholar part of google you can pull up a lot of the stuff with this
[02:37:32.600 --> 02:37:36.120]  guy's name this is an interview of course with
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:41.720]  dr paul cosy whose title is air force research laboratory space vehicles
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:45.720]  directorate for the harp program and again you'll hear him if you listen
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:49.320]  to the full interview claim he's the only directorate over harp and he knows
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:53.480]  all the side branches even though the patent was originally
[02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:56.920]  created by bernard eastland based on tesla technology
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:00.120]  and then transferred through arco the energy company
[02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:03.480]  to raytheon and other secret military industrial and there was an interview in
[02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:08.040]  the 80s on pbs where the harp director from that period admitted it could knock
[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:11.880]  missiles out that i mean we've got the pbs them admitting it so
[02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:14.680]  yeah and we even have those we could pull them up if you want to go into
[02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:18.600]  overtime or something but uh if you want to get to the clips
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:23.400]  the 956 denies weather modification uh is a good place to start
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:27.880]  let's roll that clip from the 2008 air control or weather modification
[02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:32.760]  well it has uh you know unfortunately it's totally off base
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:36.840]  it has no interaction to affect anything
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:41.000]  uh with the weather system remember the weather systems are
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:45.080]  relatively close to earth to jet stream and things like that and not all that
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:49.720]  high up there we're talking about the harp energy going up and
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:53.800]  interacting out in the
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:57.560]  areas hundreds of miles into space this is even going into the van allen
[02:38:57.560 --> 02:39:01.640]  radiation belt isn't it uh well the radio waves
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:05.800]  it's a high enough frequency that can get through the eyes for god into these
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:09.480]  space that's true yeah uh but i mean the russian
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:13.400]  to advertise that they have radio arrays and that's why it's an anti-satellite
[02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:16.920]  weapon as well yeah and as begus talks about a
[02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:21.160]  numerous interviews it has the potential to be a ground-based star war system
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:24.280]  that's the whole point because satellites can be knocked out by the enemy
[02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:28.040]  and they admitted this previously since it got attention they now deny it
[02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:31.400]  yeah and one of the applications of harp is that because satellites can either
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:33.880]  go out of alignment or be knocked out by the enemy
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:38.360]  this would be a ground-based approach that wouldn't rely solely on satellites
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:43.160]  um but you see he denies it has weather modification i have a quote right here
[02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:47.320]  from bernard eastland's patent who of course developed the harp technology but
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:51.160]  later became a whistleblower and spoke to beggage and manning and it's all in
[02:39:51.160 --> 02:39:56.280]  their book the patent number 4,686605
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:39:59.320]  weather modification is possible for example
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:03.400]  altering upper atmosphere wind patterns by constructing one or more plumes
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:07.720]  of atmospheric particles which will act as a lens or focusing device
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:11.720]  and besides that we know the magnetosphere the effects of the sun and
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:14.520]  the moon all affect weather which are lower in the
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:17.400]  atmosphere of course the ionosphere has an effect
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:22.360]  when you you know mess with those ionic particles flowing to the two poles
[02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:25.240]  of course when you manipulate that it's going to affect weather
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:29.240]  that's why they like to build these at poles because that's the natural gauge
[02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:31.960]  right there they're tying into the stream
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:35.480]  yeah because that's what it all flows to those two points so they can move i
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:38.600]  guess most people easily manipulate it from there
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:42.200]  uh... continuing uh... you know you might want to listen to this whole
[02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:45.480]  interview if you haven't it's up on info wars as alex mentioned
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:48.520]  uh... but it's sixteen minutes into this clip
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:51.720]  uh... you just ask him if there's other areas of harp and he says no there's no
[02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:55.720]  other tentacles let's play that
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:40:59.800]  employee at the laboratory and i've been there well you talked about a lot of
[02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:03.400]  other programs going on a lot of other directorates and groups i mean are you
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:07.400]  privy to all the programs going on with harp are you privy over one one
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:09.400]  directorate
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:11.400]  what do you mean the harp?
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:14.400]  the harp is assigned under the director's
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:17.400]  i'm in and it has no
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:20.400]  tentacles or no other wings in other places
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:22.400]  i'm not familiar with it
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:25.400]  it's a pretty self-contained program
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:27.400]  you just said it there
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:30.400]  okay so it's one program there but there's a lot of other agencies and things
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:33.400]  that are there looking at the data and i guess
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:36.400]  you know i guess they get space on the system to
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:39.400]  run their own tests i mean how many different agencies are involved looking
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:42.400]  at the data doing experiments
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:44.400]  well we have uh...
[02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:48.400]  it's a joint program actually set up as a joint program some years ago
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:52.400]  uh... with the airport in the Navy
[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:55.400]  erin what's the importance of that
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:59.400]  well the importance is they claim there's no secrecy no other hidden aspects to it
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:03.400]  but anyone who tries to investigate harp is persona non grata
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:06.400]  uh... you brought up uh... the
[02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:09.400]  what's the name general parton yes involved in the eighties they denied it on air
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:13.400]  uh... then as you explain at the end of the clip uh... i don't know if we're going to get to that
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:17.400]  you explain how they did come back on air and admit that yeah there was a program
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:19.400]  but we're not going to talk about that
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:23.400]  uh... so it just shows that obviously there's more going on than quote pure research
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:27.400]  as he claims and so yeah it was over the horizon radar because he was the head of
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:30.400]  Air Force weapons development of course general parton is going to be in there
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:34.400]  i'm not denying this guy's a real scientist but he's clearly a frontman in this
[02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:38.400]  interview and another publication saying it's only for pure research
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:42.400]  we have other scientists also from the hand scum Air Force base
[02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:46.400]  who claim the same thing that it's pure research that oh well maybe there could be
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:50.400]  military applications well that's like the now partially admitted chemtrail
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:54.400]  geoengineering program um... they go oh everything we've been doing has been
[02:42:54.400 --> 02:42:59.400]  test but it starts right when our researchers decades ago predicted it did
[02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:03.400]  in the mid nineties it is barium salts aluminum dioxide i mean it's exactly
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:06.400]  but they always just research
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:09.400]  yeah that's how they play the card i guess
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:12.400]  i think we should move into where you ask him about
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:16.400]  photometers and other scientific measurements which are all supposedly
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:19.400]  just to study the aurora borealis
[02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:22.400]  now i was going off memory from almost four years ago but i remember i was on
[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:24.400]  air off air you've had time to hear the whole interview i haven't
[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:27.400]  where he talked about it igniting the upper atmosphere but you're saying you
[02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:30.400]  didn't find that you found him talking about manipulating it
[02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:33.400]  well they just talk about how the radio frequency particles
[02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:37.400]  interact with the charge ionic particles that you find at the poles
[02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:40.400]  yes because i talked to guests during the break trying to get more
[02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:43.400]  and that colonel kept saying don't tell him don't tell him and then he said
[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:46.400]  i kept trying to keep him longer and he said no we would have done the hour but this is over
[02:43:46.400 --> 02:43:51.400]  well look they've been doing ionospheric heating based on radio frequency
[02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:55.400]  in fact that's another side part where he talks about marconi discovering
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:59.400]  radio it's kind of a jab at tesla who they covered up but the supreme court
[02:43:59.400 --> 02:44:02.400]  went back and now i know but you've heard it because i remember him saying
[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:05.400]  they can ignite the atmosphere was that set on air or during a break
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:08.400]  that must have been during break is it what clip do you have though he's just
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:11.400]  something about that you said you found yeah it starts at twenty nine sixteen
[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:15.400]  but the whole point is they've been doing this heating the ionosphere for a while
[02:44:15.400 --> 02:44:19.400]  but through the heart patents they're able to focus it into a focus beam
[02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:22.400]  and that allows them to manipulate it at a greater point
[02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:24.400]  uh... let's play that clip
[02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:28.400]  uh... but the problem with those are optical type devices that
[02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:29.400]  that uh...
[02:44:29.400 --> 02:44:32.000]  uh... if you if you uh...
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:35.400]  if the weather is right so to speak in space a space letter
[02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:36.400]  and there's not
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:38.400]  uh... too much natural
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:41.400]  uh... disturbances going on like a war
[02:44:41.400 --> 02:44:44.400]  is what we call quiet and on those kind of nights
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:46.400]  when we send the radio away from harp up
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:48.400]  we can produce
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:50.400]  miniature
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:52.400]  emissions of light
[02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:55.400]  somewhat like a war thing but they're so weak that
[02:44:55.400 --> 02:44:58.400]  if there's any other natural or going on
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:00.400]  I understand you observed those
[02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:02.400]  what are magnimeters
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:04.400]  for magnetometers
[02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:06.400]  those are instruments
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:10.400]  that typically are set out all over the world
[02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:12.400]  to
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:14.400]  measure the Earth's magnetic field
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:16.400]  the zero magnetic field
[02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:18.400]  that surrounds the Earth
[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:21.400]  and whenever there's like eruptions on the sun
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:23.400]  like a solar flare or magnetic storms
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:26.400]  you'll see those magnetic field
[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:28.400]  components there
[02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:30.400]  that's good right there so um...
[02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:31.400]  must have been during a break
[02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:32.400]  I remember him saying well it can ignite it
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:34.400]  and the guy's like no don't say that
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:36.400]  but uh... there he is saying
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:38.400]  but then the patents admit they're doing this
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:39.400]  yeah
[02:45:39.400 --> 02:45:41.400]  and your story is consistent because the
[02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:44.400]  in the later part of the same clip from back in 2008
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:46.400]  on the same day you talk about how they interrupted
[02:45:46.400 --> 02:45:48.400]  how they had a PR guy on behind the scenes
[02:45:48.400 --> 02:45:49.400]  I don't know if you want to play that part
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:50.400]  or just talk about it
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:52.400]  well how many other clips we got
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:53.400]  uh... that's it
[02:45:53.400 --> 02:45:54.400]  well let's play that one
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:55.400]  let's play the next clip
[02:45:55.400 --> 02:45:56.400]  which clip is that for them
[02:45:56.400 --> 02:45:58.400]  uh... that queues in at thirty five thirty nine
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:45:59.400]  number seven
[02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:03.400]  alright let's play number seven
[02:46:03.400 --> 02:46:06.400]  uh... pardon me
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:07.400]  oh great yeah we don't have that
[02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:09.400]  they're having to skip through the file
[02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:12.400]  uh... overall go through some more of those documents
[02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:14.400]  well here's just some of the papers
[02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:17.400]  uh... that
[02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:19.400]  well Heckshire is another guy from the
[02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:20.400]  the Hanscom Air Force Base
[02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:22.400]  who you can see in a clip
[02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:24.400]  there's Paul Cossey who is the guy you interviewed
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:26.400]  also from Hanscom Air Force Base
[02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:28.400]  and other guys
[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:30.400]  uh... stimulated thermal instability
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:33.400]  for ELF and VLF wave generation
[02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:35.400]  again that's what they use to trigger earthquakes
[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:37.400]  if in fact they do that
[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:40.400]  uh... there is
[02:46:40.400 --> 02:46:42.400]  the feasibility and desirability of an Air Force
[02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:44.400]  ELF, VLF satellite
[02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:46.400]  to ground communications link
[02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:47.400]  now that's back in seventy five
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:49.400]  that's when they were still
[02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:51.400]  you know kind of getting the stuff together
[02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:53.400]  but here we are in the two thousands
[02:46:53.400 --> 02:46:55.400]  it's well on its way
[02:46:55.400 --> 02:46:57.400]  uh... there's
[02:46:57.400 --> 02:46:58.400]  it's the same one
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:01.400]  relative attenuation of TM, TE waves
[02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:03.400]  propagating the Earth ionosphere wave guys
[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:04.400]  these are government documents
[02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:06.400]  these are all government documents
[02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:09.400]  all with Cossey as one of the riders
[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:11.400]  there's description of Harp
[02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:13.400]  Gakona facility
[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:15.400]  with some results from recent research
[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:17.400]  also with Cossey and Kennedy
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:19.400]  who you were going to interview
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:21.400]  in 2008 but he did not end up coming on
[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:23.400]  um...
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:25.400]  there's high frequency radar
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:27.400]  astronomy with Harp
[02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:29.400]  there's articles about how they
[02:47:29.400 --> 02:47:31.400]  reflected off the moon
[02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:33.400]  uh... and
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:35.400]  excuse me
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:36.400]  I have some money here
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:38.400]  scientists detect lowest frequency
[02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:40.400]  radar echo from the moon
[02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:42.400]  so they're bouncing harp technology off the moon
[02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:44.400]  what was that out of
[02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:46.400]  uh... that was an article from the naval
[02:47:46.400 --> 02:47:48.400]  research laboratory published in
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:50.400]  space ref that's a
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:51.400]  publication I guess
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:53.400]  public publication
[02:47:53.400 --> 02:47:55.400]  there's a military's mystery
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:57.400]  machine all about harp
[02:47:57.400 --> 02:47:59.400]  and how it's quote a little bit less
[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:01.400]  ominous that was in popular science
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:03.400]  Popsi.com
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:05.400]  and there's others it just goes on
[02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:07.400]  alright we have that clip now of
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:09.400]  this clip is when I come back
[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:11.400]  and talk about them telling me
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:13.400]  what I couldn't talk about these are your afterthoughts
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:15.400]  this is the afterthoughts here's that clip
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:17.400]  when I got back
[02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:19.400]  in town late last week and he said
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:21.400]  on Friday I shut up the director of
[02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:23.400]  harp and I'm like what
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:25.400]  you should have heard it behind the scenes though
[02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:27.400]  they had this PR guy on the line with him the whole time
[02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:29.400]  that's why his phone sounded muffled
[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:31.400]  and they put off this whole
[02:48:31.400 --> 02:48:33.400]  you know persona it's no big deal
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:35.400]  it's all above board
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:37.400]  so I guess that's that clip
[02:48:37.400 --> 02:48:39.400]  and I have no doubt that a lot of it
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:41.400]  is exaggerated what you hear on the web
[02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:43.400]  or they combine
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:45.400]  other programs in with it
[02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:47.400]  that's good so
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:49.400]  I mean Aaron bottom line
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:52.400]  you've already written a big article with links I guess you're going to add these or do another one
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:54.400]  because it's just like the chemtrails
[02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:56.400]  how many patents have you found about mixing
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:48:58.400]  the barium salts loom dioxide in with the jet fuel
[02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:00.400]  so the jet companies don't even know
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:02.400]  and it's designed to disperse the nuclei
[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:04.400]  through the jet engines I mean we just
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:06.400]  we have just giant stacks of all these admissions
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:08.400]  yeah I have dozens
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:10.400]  if not hundreds of articles
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:12.400]  and I found other researchers online
[02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:14.400]  have posted probably about
[02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:16.400]  100 patents that are related
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:18.400]  in one way or another to cloud seeding
[02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:20.400]  to chemtrails to different
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:22.400]  means of dispersion
[02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:24.400]  to the use of quote albedos
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:26.400]  to reflect sunlight which they
[02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:28.400]  and Bill Gates is obsessed with this
[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:30.400]  mm-hmm yeah he is
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:32.400]  the program to steer hurricanes
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:34.400]  and and we would pay him
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:36.400]  to avert disaster
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:38.400]  and you know it's all the usual players
[02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:40.400]  of course in the White House
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:42.400]  the science our John P. Holdren is involved
[02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:44.400]  who was also involved in
[02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:46.400]  SDI Star Wars programs
[02:49:46.400 --> 02:49:48.400]  and I don't know if he has a connection
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:50.400]  to heart but I think there's a connection
[02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:52.400]  between those three areas perhaps
[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:54.400]  you got a lot of other research there
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:56.400]  closing points on this
[02:49:56.400 --> 02:49:58.400]  closing points there's a PBS
[02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:00.400]  documentary where they talk about
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:02.400]  the weather manipulation
[02:50:02.400 --> 02:50:04.400]  it's contained within the Tesla
[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:06.400]  documentary produced
[02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:08.400]  by PBS there's a CBC
[02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:10.400]  interview where they interview the other
[02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:12.400]  guy Hercshire so there's
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:14.400]  a lot of admission here and you can also see
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:16.400]  their talking points and they tried to sell it
[02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:18.400]  the 70s and 80s on TV
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:20.400]  we've got all that and since the 90s
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:22.400]  with the critical book
[02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:24.400]  written by Dr. Begich that's when
[02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:26.400]  they started denying it
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:28.400]  yeah and it's critical
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:30.400]  that Bernard Eastland used Tesla's
[02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:32.400]  technology to enhance their
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:34.400]  heating of the ionosphere and
[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:36.400]  that branches out in all kinds of military
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:38.400]  applications there's no doubt that there's
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:40.400]  military applications and worse
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:42.400]  worse
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:44.400]  as depopulation
[02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:46.400]  mind control they got a lot of patents
[02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:48.400]  on that yeah and that's all
[02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:50.400]  in play not that I'm an expert
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:52.400]  on it but I agree with Begich that we
[02:50:52.400 --> 02:50:54.400]  layman have a right to weigh in on this
[02:50:54.400 --> 02:50:56.400]  absolutely
[02:50:56.400 --> 02:50:58.400]  Blumble as you're telling us radiation is good for us
[02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:00.400]  stay with us
[02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:02.400]  this message starts with a great

[02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:22.400]  over 60% of municipal water is
[02:51:22.400 --> 02:51:24.400]  fluoridated and it less than 2 cents per gallon
[02:51:24.400 --> 02:51:26.400]  Berkey water filters purify both
[02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:28.400]  treated and untreated water
[02:51:28.400 --> 02:51:30.400]  removing dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and other
[02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:32.400]  contaminants. Big Berkey water filters
[02:51:32.400 --> 02:51:34.400]  are powerful enough to purify stagnant
[02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:36.400]  pond water so they're perfect for rainwater
[02:51:36.400 --> 02:51:38.400]  collection systems and emergency preparedness
[02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:40.400]  remember Big Berkey includes free

[02:52:08.400 --> 02:52:10.400]  relive history. As we're finishing off
[02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:12.400]  this agenda, they'll be pulling
[02:52:12.400 --> 02:52:14.400]  the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:16.400]  I've turned a tremendous influence
[02:52:16.400 --> 02:52:18.400]  on our president in Congress
[02:52:18.400 --> 02:52:20.400]  and they really are calling the shots
[02:52:20.400 --> 02:52:22.400]  I think it's incumbent upon
[02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:24.400]  all of us as American citizens
[02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:26.400]  to pay attention.
[02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:28.400]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies
[02:52:28.400 --> 02:52:30.400]  of our nation, the criminal offshore
[02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:32.400]  cartel held bent on destroying
[02:52:32.400 --> 02:52:34.400]  sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:52:34.400 --> 02:52:36.400]  constructing world government.
[02:52:36.400 --> 02:52:38.400]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists
[02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:40.400]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[02:52:40.400 --> 02:52:42.400]  is saying who do we make the checkout to?
[02:52:42.400 --> 02:52:44.400]  Today seems like nobody does care
[02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:46.400]  and right now in Washington DC
[02:52:46.400 --> 02:52:48.400]  we have seen a fall
[02:52:48.400 --> 02:52:50.400]  of the Republic.

[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:42.400]  the next hour on infowars.com
[02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:44.400]  but I want to be able to do justice to everybody
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:46.400]  we've got more on harp here in the closing minutes
[02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:48.400]  but Obama rules out
[02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:50.400]  land invasion of Libya
[02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:52.400]  just like they call the bombardment
[02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:54.400]  a humanitarian mission not a war
[02:54:54.400 --> 02:54:56.400]  but meanwhile
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:54:58.400]  the news 12 ABC reports Camp Lejeune
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:00.400]  Marines 2200
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:02.400]  sent to Libya
[02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:04.400]  possibly for invasion
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:06.400]  so we've got all that going on
[02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:08.400]  you've got a clip here
[02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:10.400]  from PBS
[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:12.400]  and tell
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:14.400]  this documentary is from the early 80s, correct?
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:16.400]  I think it's more recent than that
[02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:18.400]  it's Tesla the master of lightning
[02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:20.400]  documentary and it goes into his plans
[02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:22.400]  for the harp system. There must be another one
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:24.400]  that Rob has back there that's from the 80s
[02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:26.400]  and play this clip
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:28.400]  the harp project
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:30.400]  evolved from a patent filed
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:32.400]  in 1987 in which
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:34.400]  Tesla's work is referenced
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:38.400]  it proposed using the ionosphere
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:40.400]  like an enormous electrical
[02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:42.400]  circuit to transmit
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:44.400]  power around the planet
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:46.400]  it even
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:48.400]  described a means of changing the weather
[02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:50.400]  by superheating
[02:55:50.400 --> 02:55:52.400]  portions of the upper atmosphere
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:54.400]  with microwave energy
[02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:56.400]  Tesla proposed that
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:55:58.400]  it might be possible to modify the weather
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:00.400]  by using radio waves
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:02.400]  I believe that this is impossible
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:06.400]  ionospheric modification
[02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:08.400]  is still in its early experimental stages
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:12.400]  but microwave technology
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:14.400]  has already made it possible
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:16.400]  to transmit wireless power
[02:56:16.400 --> 02:56:18.400]  with the use of satellites
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:20.400]  we're going to Alaska
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:22.400]  and in Alaska there is natural gas
[02:56:24.400 --> 02:56:26.400]  in order to send it somewhere
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:28.400]  you have to create a pipeline
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:30.400]  that's very expensive
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:32.400]  so we said all right, let's go into Alaska
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:34.400]  create microwaves
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:36.400]  from the natural gas
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:38.400]  send them to a satellite
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:40.400]  at a particular geosyncrasal orbit
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:42.400]  put a reflector there
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:44.400]  then send it to Japan
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:46.400]  and in Japan now you get the rectena
[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:48.400]  which transforms these microwaves
[02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:50.400]  into 60 hertz and you get electricity
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:52.400]  so you make
[02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:54.400]  essentially Tesla's dream
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:56.400]  okay, yeah
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:56:58.400]  and Rob's got another older documentary from PBS
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:00.400]  admitting a lot of that, so there it is
[02:57:00.400 --> 02:57:02.400]  it's in the patents, they clearly are
[02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:04.400]  whitewashing and
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:06.400]  basically covering up the real power of these systems
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:08.400]  yeah, you see spin in that clip
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:10.400]  of course military application
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:12.400]  and indeed energy application
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:14.400]  we know that stuff is suppressed
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:16.400]  30, 40, maybe even 50 years
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:18.400]  so I don't expect they're telling us everything up front
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:20.400]  there's a lot of interesting potential
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:22.400]  in the technology
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:24.400]  but it really puts us in the hands of a potential
[02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:26.400]  scientific dictatorship
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:28.400]  because it's also being done in secret
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:30.400]  and that's the whole national security state
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:32.400]  great job Aaron, please continue with the great work you're doing
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:34.400]  thank you
[02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:36.400]  two final points here
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:38.400]  the Drudge Report has a link to the Jerusalem Post
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:40.400]  confirming what we told you last Sunday
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:42.400]  Al Qaeda is backing the rebels
[02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:44.400]  that's the Jerusalem Post
[02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:46.400]  update
[02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:48.400]  that 15 are dead in new clashes
[02:57:48.400 --> 02:57:50.400]  in southern Syria city
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:52.400]  that's up on infowars.com
[02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:54.400]  and army soldier pleads guilty
[02:57:54.400 --> 02:57:56.400]  in deaths of three Afghans
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:57:58.400]  admits that they just killed them
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:00.400]  they weren't combatants in cold blood for enjoyment
[02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:02.400]  there's also some drug charges involved
[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:04.400]  so this just shows the type of stuff
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:06.400]  that's going on that our military has been advocating
[02:58:06.400 --> 02:58:08.400]  they're only now going to prosecute these guys
[02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:10.400]  because they got caught
[02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:12.400]  Aaron, what's your take on that
[02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:14.400]  it's amazing
[02:58:14.400 --> 02:58:16.400]  the good guys torture
[02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:18.400]  no they don't, don't let them steal America's soul
[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:20.400]  not in our name ladies and gentlemen
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:22.400]  great job to the crew
[02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:24.400]  I'll be back live with a powerful and informative guest
[02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:26.400]  tomorrow
[02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:28.400]  we'll continue to track the radiation levels
[02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:30.400]  1600 times safe levels in Japan
[02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:32.400]  more of that cloud for the bigger blowouts
[02:58:32.400 --> 02:58:34.400]  headed towards the west coast
[02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:36.400]  some of the radiation has already blown over
[02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:38.400]  and reached Iceland as of yesterday
[02:58:38.400 --> 02:58:40.400]  retransmission with key info starts now in
[02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:42.400]  Tom
[02:58:42.400 --> 02:58:44.400]  thank you for listening to GCN
[02:58:46.400 --> 02:58:48.400]  visit GCNLive.com
[02:58:48.400 --> 02:58:50.400]  today
[02:58:52.400 --> 02:58:54.400]  hundreds of nations have fallen
[02:58:54.400 --> 02:58:56.400]  to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:58:56.400 --> 02:58:58.400]  this is our last chance to not
[02:58:58.400 --> 02:59:00.400]  relive history
[02:59:00.400 --> 02:59:02.400]  as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:59:02.400 --> 02:59:04.400]  we'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:06.400]  at home
[02:59:06.400 --> 02:59:08.400]  I've turned members influence on our president
[02:59:08.400 --> 02:59:10.400]  and they really are calling the shots
[02:59:10.400 --> 02:59:12.400]  I think it's incumbent upon
[02:59:12.400 --> 02:59:14.400]  all of us as American citizens
[02:59:14.400 --> 02:59:16.400]  to pay attention
[02:59:16.400 --> 02:59:18.400]  full of the republic identifies the enemies
[02:59:18.400 --> 02:59:20.400]  of our nation
[02:59:20.400 --> 02:59:22.400]  the criminal offshore cartel
[02:59:22.400 --> 02:59:24.400]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:59:24.400 --> 02:59:26.400]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[02:59:26.400 --> 02:59:28.400]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists
[02:59:28.400 --> 02:59:30.400]  they're asking for more matches
[02:59:30.400 --> 02:59:32.400]  and the congress is saying who do we make the check out to
[02:59:32.400 --> 02:59:34.400]  today seems like nobody does care
