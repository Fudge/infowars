[00:00:04.912 --> 00:00:09.735]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:11.315]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.315 --> 00:00:12.876]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:17.059]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:21.121]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:39.627]  We're live, my friends.
[00:00:39.627 --> 00:00:43.089]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.250]  It is Wednesday, the 23rd day of March 2011.
[00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.993]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.993 --> 00:00:55.895]  We have James Corbett joining us from Japan.
[00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:58.416]  You know he's been a frequent guest on this broadcast.
[00:00:58.416 --> 00:00:59.537]  He is a news journalist.
[00:01:00.057 --> 00:01:00.237]  I think?
[00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:19.592]  And the thing is a complete whitewash.
[00:01:19.592 --> 00:01:26.453]  And I had remembered the Army, the Air Force Colonel coming on and cutting him off, but he did that in a break and they cut the interview short.
[00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:32.014]  Then I come back from break and say, well, they cut the interview short and basically didn't allow it to continue.
[00:01:32.014 --> 00:01:38.975]  But I'm going to try to get that current director of HAARP, our research shows he's still the director, back on yet again.
[00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:43.816]  Because Aaron, after refinding the audio yesterday of the 35 minute interview,
[00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:59.343]  Reposted it on Infowars.com and did some research on the interview with the guy denying things on the broadcast that he had admitted to in other interviews or that the Pentagon had admitted to previously.
[00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:06.048]  So we're going to be looking at HAARP in the last 30 minutes of the third hour today.
[00:02:06.048 --> 00:02:07.970]  So that is all coming up.
[00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.153]  Again, I want to thank you for joining us.
[00:02:11.153 --> 00:02:19.220]  We're going to get into the unraveling coalition of the willing with the whole Libya situation.
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.506]  Also, video has surfaced of then-Senator, now-Vice President Joe Biden
[00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:46.081]  Involved in a town hall meeting and then subsequently on MSNBC with Swine Bowl Chris Matthews talking about impeaching a president if they unilaterally launch military attacks on countries that hadn't attacked us first and that it was unconstitutional.
[00:02:46.983 --> 00:02:53.950]  Now Obama has gone even further than Bush, because Bush did get a resolution of force from the Congress.
[00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:08.584]  It was not a declaration of war, it was still unconstitutional, but comparatively, and you know I was a big enemy of those preemptive, illegal, genocidal wars, I was a big
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.621]  person for peace.
[00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:23.908]  But at the same time, what Obama has done has gone even further because in less than 48 hours after the UN resolution, he didn't even consult Congress.
[00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:26.030]  He didn't try to get a resolution.
[00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.810]  Nothing.
[00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:35.536]  He launched those operations from the cruise missiles, off of the missile cruiser ships, from the aircraft F-15s,
[00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:50.930]  He and others flying around and a lot of people a lot of conservatives and liberals across that controlled political spectrum are pointing out that it was unconstitutional because he didn't get any type of congressional approval.
[00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.857]  Congress passes the laws, orders the wars, the president executes it as the executive.
[00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:00.205]  I don't
[00:04:14.694 --> 00:04:14.914]  I think?
[00:04:36.736 --> 00:04:39.498]  Build the main headquarters in New York City.
[00:04:39.498 --> 00:04:46.023]  That is all coming up now, but the biggest news, the biggest news is the radiation cover-up.
[00:04:46.023 --> 00:04:49.686]  We're now getting a very clear picture of just how big this cover-up is.
[00:04:49.686 --> 00:04:51.127]  Here's the headline out of Japan.
[00:04:51.127 --> 00:04:55.050]  RT is also reporting it, but Japanese news confirms this.
[00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.792]  Radiation levels at Fukushima exceed 1,600 times safe levels.
[00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.500]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.425]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:05:08.425 --> 00:05:10.987]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:05:10.987 --> 00:05:16.371]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:05:16.371 --> 00:05:19.413]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:05:19.413 --> 00:05:21.735]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:05:21.735 --> 00:05:27.039]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Groves.
[00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.399]  I don't know.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.963]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:05:46.963 --> 00:05:51.589]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.173]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:08.311]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[00:06:08.311 --> 00:06:10.992]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[00:06:10.992 --> 00:06:20.015]  Ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[00:06:20.015 --> 00:06:28.278]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[00:06:28.278 --> 00:06:29.118]  Move quickly while
[00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:29.358]  I think so.
[00:07:03.812 --> 00:07:05.073]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:05.073 --> 00:07:09.015]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:09.015 --> 00:07:11.237]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:11.237 --> 00:07:17.120]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.364]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:23.784 --> 00:07:29.727]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:29.727 --> 00:07:33.928]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:33.928 --> 00:07:38.210]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:44.172]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:47.734]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:49.695]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:49.695 --> 00:07:50.135]  It's here.

[00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:03.572]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.572 --> 00:08:06.916]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.018 --> 00:08:42.673]  The Sydney Morning Herald and Fox News, as well as many Japanese newspapers, are reporting that they have had to evacuate the Fukushima 6 reactor disaster site area because of smoke.
[00:08:42.673 --> 00:08:51.841]  Now, that's code word for highly radioactive isotopes, uranium, plutonium, tritium, strontium,
[00:08:53.124 --> 00:09:05.480]  Cesium, radioactive iodine, pouring out of the maws, the gaping wounds, where four of the reactors, as you know, have blown sky-high and had subsequent
[00:09:06.343 --> 00:09:10.905]  Fires on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:13.085]  We do have the Sydney Morning Herald up there.
[00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:17.787]  Evacuation at Fukushima plant after smoke seen at reactor.
[00:09:17.787 --> 00:09:28.191]  They've confirmed that the reactors are, multiple reactors are boiling and off-gassing extremely radioactive gas directly into the atmosphere and then blowing towards the United States.
[00:09:29.111 --> 00:09:52.010]  It was confirmed yesterday in Iceland, multiple radioactive isotopes that have traveled more than 10,000 miles from Japan on its northeast coast over North America, over the Atlantic to Iceland, set to be arriving in England anytime now, and then the next day over Europe, and then back over the Middle East, Central Asia.
[00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:55.874]  Uh, East Asia and back over Japan.
[00:09:55.874 --> 00:10:08.343]  Uh, so, uh, many forecasters estimate that within another week, uh, the radioactive gas, uh, different variants of, uh, different isotopes, uh, will have, uh, gone all the way around the world.
[00:10:08.343 --> 00:10:15.909]  Uh, so we're gonna be breaking that down, but, uh, French news agency also reporting smoke at Japan reactor forces evacuation.
[00:10:16.815 --> 00:10:24.139]  Workers were evacuated from part of a stricken nuclear power station in Japan today after dark smoke.
[00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:26.079]  That's not steam.
[00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:31.322]  Dark smoke means filled with the nasty ingredients that are down on those reactors.
[00:10:31.322 --> 00:10:36.985]  Those are the live reactors with the non-spent fuel rods, including one reactor that's plutonium-based.
[00:10:36.985 --> 00:10:39.586]  Doesn't get any nastier than that.
[00:10:39.586 --> 00:10:43.408]  And remember, plutonium and uranium are very heavy.
[00:10:44.315 --> 00:10:53.000]  Most of the stuff that's been coming over here is radioactive gases, radiation attached to what they call noble gases that rise.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.202]  And so they go up into the upper atmosphere and are blown here.
[00:10:57.202 --> 00:11:00.704]  We are getting the lighter stuff.
[00:11:00.704 --> 00:11:02.946]  In fact, I wanted to do an illustration.
[00:11:02.946 --> 00:11:04.687]  In fact, will you guys get me a glass of water?
[00:11:04.687 --> 00:11:09.209]  I'm gonna have to pour it on the table in the next segment for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:11:09.209 --> 00:11:13.472]  You see, we're now into, how many days since this happened Friday before last?
[00:11:16.121 --> 00:11:17.142]  How many days is it?
[00:11:17.142 --> 00:11:20.363]  We're talking about twelve days now?
[00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:22.364]  Twelve days?
[00:11:22.364 --> 00:11:24.185]  Twelve days since this happened.
[00:11:24.185 --> 00:11:29.368]  And so you've got radiation pouring out of these heavily damaged four reactors.
[00:11:29.368 --> 00:11:33.751]  They say they've stabilized the other two, though they've had some fires there as well.
[00:11:33.751 --> 00:11:35.812]  Who knows if what we're being told is true.
[00:11:35.812 --> 00:11:39.174]  Counterpunch has a big radiological expert with an article yesterday.
[00:11:40.174 --> 00:11:51.684]  Breaking down that all they've got is one radiation meter a few miles away, and they're just getting basic readings, which show that they're 1,600 times safe levels.
[00:11:51.684 --> 00:12:05.556]  But imagine what else is blowing out to sea, and that it takes very specialized devices to not just pick up radiation, that's easy, but to pick up exactly what is being off-gassed.
[00:12:06.573 --> 00:12:19.237]  And so now they're reporting the soils as far away as 20 miles from Fukushima are 1600 times higher than normal levels of radiation.
[00:12:19.237 --> 00:12:23.238]  They're putting off 1600 times more radiation than is considered normal.
[00:12:23.238 --> 00:12:26.559]  If you walk up to a rock and you point a
[00:12:29.517 --> 00:12:30.418]  Geiger countered it.
[00:12:30.418 --> 00:12:34.081]  It's supposed to be putting off a certain amount of sieverts.
[00:12:34.081 --> 00:12:36.964]  It's putting off 1,600 times.
[00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:46.973]  That's now all over the Japanese press, all over the Russian press, all over the European press, not in US press, because they just want to tell us out of sight, out of mind.
[00:12:46.973 --> 00:12:53.159]  We have a government that detonated more nuclear weapons above ground and atomic weapons than all other countries combined.
[00:12:54.392 --> 00:12:56.375]  And they just told us it's healthy.
[00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:59.900]  And they trot out Ann Coulter to say radiation is good for you.
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.902]  Why doesn't she then move into the reactor core?
[00:13:02.717 --> 00:13:14.567]  If it's so good, why do you think the people running the nuclear power plant in China, in Japan, have broken down and cried last Friday saying, this is gonna kill people.
[00:13:14.567 --> 00:13:17.170]  This is lethal dose of radiation.
[00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:20.092]  The brave people going in are going to die from this.
[00:13:20.092 --> 00:13:21.754]  May take a week, may take a month.
[00:13:21.754 --> 00:13:23.335]  It's going to kill them.
[00:13:23.335 --> 00:13:29.901]  But who cares what the nuclear physicist says, who's broken in silence and is the plant director.
[00:13:31.141 --> 00:13:34.484]  Let's not listen to a nuclear power plant manager.
[00:13:34.484 --> 00:13:40.750]  Let's listen to Ann Coulter, who tells us that radiation is good for us.
[00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.592]  Well, yeah, a little sunlight's good for you.
[00:13:42.592 --> 00:13:43.953]  That's a form of radiation.
[00:13:43.953 --> 00:13:46.055]  Ultra-violent radiation.
[00:13:46.055 --> 00:13:48.557]  Not this type of radiation.
[00:13:48.557 --> 00:13:49.859]  Not even in the same family.
[00:13:51.345 --> 00:13:52.206]  But here's the issue.
[00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:55.589]  If I had a glass of water here and I poured out a little bit on my table, it wouldn't be much.
[00:13:55.589 --> 00:13:57.711]  Then if I poured out a whole glass, it'd be more.
[00:13:57.711 --> 00:14:01.875]  Then if I put a fire hose in here, in fact, guys, I'll do this right now on air.
[00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:03.777]  Give me a document cam shot right here.
[00:14:03.777 --> 00:14:07.501]  12 days, and we'll have to get some napkins, obviously.
[00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:11.865]  We are 12 days into this situation.
[00:14:12.706 --> 00:14:18.152]  And there is an entire cornucopia of nasty different types of radiation.
[00:14:18.152 --> 00:14:25.801]  You've got the 600,000 spent fuel rods on fire, blown in all directions, huge explosions, ongoing fires.
[00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:32.388]  They've had to evacuate again because of smoke, and then they go on to admit radioactive black smoke.
[00:14:33.129 --> 00:14:35.612]  This isn't steam, meaning just boiling water.
[00:14:35.612 --> 00:14:44.441]  This is so filled with nasty meltdown from live, high-powered, live fuel rods.
[00:14:47.108 --> 00:14:52.232]  That the workers who were already saying they're willing to die are pulling back.
[00:14:52.232 --> 00:14:57.236]  And they're reporting 1,600 times safe levels of radiation.
[00:14:57.236 --> 00:15:01.399]  And our Western news media here in the United States is telling us everything is wonderful.
[00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:05.462]  So, smoke at Japan reactor forces evacuation workers.
[00:15:06.463 --> 00:15:14.429]  We're evacuating from part of the stricken nuclear power station in Japan on Wednesday after dark smoke was seen rising from one of the reactors, the plant operator said.
[00:15:14.429 --> 00:15:32.123]  The workers were pulled out of the control room of reactor number three, said officials from Tokyo Power Company, told reporters, adding that the source of the smoke was unknown, though they admitted back last Saturday, what, 11 days ago, Saturday before last, that they'd had partial meltdowns at at least two.
[00:15:32.123 --> 00:15:32.884]  Now it's at four.
[00:15:33.824 --> 00:15:39.631]  They go on to talk about the increased radiation levels.
[00:15:39.631 --> 00:15:43.555]  They go on to say that we do have abnormal levels of radiation.
[00:15:43.555 --> 00:15:44.596]  That's a nice way to spin it.
[00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:48.668]  Here's the RT headline from Japan.
[00:15:48.668 --> 00:15:53.194]  Smoke forces evacuation at Fukushima reactor.
[00:15:53.194 --> 00:15:56.358]  Here is another RT headline.
[00:15:56.358 --> 00:16:00.402]  Radiation at Fukushima exceeds norm by 1,600 times.
[00:16:00.402 --> 00:16:01.364]  That's from the IAEA.
[00:16:05.288 --> 00:16:18.932]  The International Atomic Energy Agency, who normally is a big whitewasher, basically financed by the nuclear power industry worldwide, work has resumed at the Fukushima power plant after it was interrupted for the second time in 24 hours.
[00:16:18.932 --> 00:16:24.774]  Restoration work has been underway at the facility to deal with damage caused by the tsunami.
[00:16:24.774 --> 00:16:27.635]  You mean the giant explosions?
[00:16:27.635 --> 00:16:34.217]  Fox News continues to show pre-tsunami, pre-explosion meltdown footage of totally intact facility.
[00:16:36.038 --> 00:16:46.107]  Now let me explain why they have 1600 times safe levels of radiation for at least 20 miles around and some levels even higher in the soil.
[00:16:47.284 --> 00:16:53.987]  Because for 12 days, it's been off-gassing every form of radioactive isotope I've ever read about.
[00:16:53.987 --> 00:16:56.068]  I mean, it's a laundry list.
[00:16:56.068 --> 00:16:58.949]  And so you get the first leak 12 days ago.
[00:16:58.949 --> 00:17:00.710]  Give me a document cam shot, please.
[00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.590]  You get the first leak.
[00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:02.790]  A little bit.
[00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.032]  That starts blowing across the Pacific towards the United States over here.
[00:17:06.032 --> 00:17:07.332]  This keyboard's the United States.
[00:17:07.332 --> 00:17:08.333]  This is North America.
[00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:10.774]  So a little bit goes over there.
[00:17:10.774 --> 00:17:12.234]  Then you get the Saturday blow-up.
[00:17:12.234 --> 00:17:13.055]  That's a lot more.
[00:17:13.655 --> 00:17:22.218]  And then you get the Monday blow-up of the Mark 1 plutonium reactor, and that'd be about 50 cups of water, but obviously I can't do that and wreck my studio.
[00:17:22.218 --> 00:17:28.140]  And then more fires and more explosions, it just keeps going, ah la la la la, and it's all going over here.
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.142]  All going over here, across the world, and our media's telling us everything's fine.
[00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:40.386]  And they're still saying that there's a greater risk from ever of total meltdown of these reactors that will be bigger than Chernobyl at each event.
[00:17:40.386 --> 00:17:47.149]  And they admit that Chernobyl circled the Earth in about 14 days and hit the United States and increased cancer rates.
[00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:47.850]  But so what?
[00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:52.032]  Let's just have Ann Coulter come out and tell us everything's fine.
[00:17:53.433 --> 00:17:59.596]  Even though the federal government's now having to admit, well, these increased radiation levels might actually hurt children in the U.S.
[00:17:59.596 --> 00:18:10.181]  a little, because they've got faster-growing cells, and radiation, depending on the estimate, is more than 10 times more destructive towards young creatures, whether they be insects or mammals.
[00:18:10.181 --> 00:18:13.623]  It doesn't matter, because they're developing more quickly.
[00:18:13.623 --> 00:18:14.984]  So, there you have it.
[00:18:14.984 --> 00:18:16.544]  See, this is where it all starts in Japan.
[00:18:16.544 --> 00:18:17.645]  So, why is it 1,600 times stronger in
[00:18:20.706 --> 00:18:46.814]  uh... twenty miles circumference according to the IAEA around Fukushima because it continues to off gas and so you get a fifty times a hundred times two hundred times five hundred times a thousand times six hundred uh... you know sixteen hundred times as it continues to build up in the soil so when they tell you over just a little bit of background radiation hit North America it's a continued wave though you get
[00:18:47.754 --> 00:18:51.996]  Some one day, more the next day, more after that, more, more, more.
[00:18:51.996 --> 00:18:58.639]  So at any one time, they can say at first, oh, it's only 25 times, you know, a day after Fukushima, what it should be.
[00:18:58.639 --> 00:19:00.500]  Oh, it's only 50.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.560]  Oh, it's only 100.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.381]  Oh, it's only 200.
[00:19:02.381 --> 00:19:03.221]  Oh, it's only 400.
[00:19:03.221 --> 00:19:05.402]  It's only 5,000, 1,600.
[00:19:05.402 --> 00:19:10.824]  Because it just keeps piling up, piling up, bioaccumulating.
[00:19:10.824 --> 00:19:13.586]  And it's going into the ocean, where we get our fish from.
[00:19:14.465 --> 00:19:18.390]  Most of the fish we get here in the United States comes out of the Pacific.
[00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.472]  It's the dominant area.
[00:19:19.472 --> 00:19:22.976]  Then the Atlantic, then the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:19:22.976 --> 00:19:25.960]  The point is, you're not going to see fish testing.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.623]  You're not going to see people being warned.
[00:19:27.623 --> 00:19:29.405]  This stuff builds up.
[00:19:29.405 --> 00:19:31.968]  You've got a lifetime average dose of radiation.
[00:19:32.858 --> 00:19:47.661]  But the cell phones and the naked body scanners and the nuclear test and the nuclear plants, and they had one last week up in Canada, released a bunch of radioactive isotopes into the lake and they said, oh, it's only, you know, three or four times safe levels.
[00:19:47.661 --> 00:19:48.121]  It's fine.
[00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:50.742]  It'll be diluted by the water.
[00:19:50.742 --> 00:19:52.182]  Not true.
[00:19:52.182 --> 00:19:53.743]  So that's what's going on.
[00:19:53.743 --> 00:19:55.003]  That's what's happening.
[00:19:55.003 --> 00:19:59.464]  It builds up and they're just pouring gallons more onto the table.
[00:20:00.546 --> 00:20:23.736]  Due to the extreme conditions from the Japanese earthquake and the fallout of depleted uranium, HempUSA.org recommends new important products that are loaded with iodine, micro plant powder, green life kelp powder, raw unprocessed red palm oil, and our 10% roll-on clear iodine that heals the skin and naturally puts iodine back into your entire body.
[00:20:23.736 --> 00:20:25.976]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at HempUSA.org today!
[00:20:29.898 --> 00:20:39.224]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.224 --> 00:20:40.025]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.025 --> 00:20:46.309]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.309 --> 00:20:47.090]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.252]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:20:50.252 --> 00:20:51.172]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.172 --> 00:20:52.593]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:20:52.593 --> 00:20:52.913]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:52.913 --> 00:20:53.194]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:01.827]  America, you've been warned.
[00:21:09.548 --> 00:21:12.749]  I told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[00:21:12.749 --> 00:21:16.409]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[00:21:16.409 --> 00:21:17.229]  Have you?
[00:21:17.229 --> 00:21:28.532]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[00:21:28.532 --> 00:21:29.712]  Could this really happen?
[00:21:29.712 --> 00:21:33.712]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[00:21:33.712 --> 00:21:35.893]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM.
[00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:41.079]  We're good.
[00:22:00.387 --> 00:22:01.688]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:01.688 --> 00:22:07.271]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:12.293]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:22:12.293 --> 00:22:12.773]  It's true.
[00:22:12.773 --> 00:22:17.336]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:22:17.856 --> 00:22:23.081]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:22:23.081 --> 00:22:30.208]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:22:30.208 --> 00:22:31.329]  And here's the best part.
[00:22:31.329 --> 00:22:37.695]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:22:37.995 --> 00:22:41.198]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:22:41.198 --> 00:22:43.420]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.360]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:44.681]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:22:44.681 --> 00:22:48.003]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:22:48.003 --> 00:22:49.725]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:23:00.307 --> 00:23:02.388]  Daddy, I'm hungry.
[00:23:02.388 --> 00:23:03.909]  That little girl will get fed.
[00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:04.709]  For now.
[00:23:04.709 --> 00:23:07.811]  But what if people like Glenn Beck are right about the threats we face?
[00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:08.351]  If the U.S.
[00:23:08.351 --> 00:23:13.855]  dollar loses its status as the global reserve currency, prices on the things you need most will skyrocket.
[00:23:13.855 --> 00:23:16.176]  Food may be unaffordable, or worse, unavailable.
[00:23:16.596 --> 00:23:27.539]  Earthquakes, economic turmoil, continuing unemployment, rampant inflation, and even threats of terrorism are all reasons to let the experts at Ready Reserve Foods help you with a long-term food storage plan.
[00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:32.641]  Ready Reserve Foods has been a premier supplier of long-term storage foods for 37 years.
[00:23:32.641 --> 00:23:37.222]  Their unique process assures the highest quality long-term food storage available worldwide.
[00:23:37.222 --> 00:23:44.564]  Their products have a shelf life of 25 years, and a year's supply of quality food for two people only takes up about as much space as a refrigerator.
[00:23:44.764 --> 00:23:50.286]  For a fraction of what you now pay at the grocery store, you owe it to your family to find out more from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:23:50.286 --> 00:23:52.627]  Call today for their free full-color catalog at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:23:52.627 --> 00:23:52.947]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[00:23:52.947 --> 00:23:55.468]  Man thinks, cause he rules the earth, he can do it as he please.
[00:23:55.468 --> 00:23:56.709]  And if things don't change soon,
[00:24:14.234 --> 00:24:18.956]  I think Bob Dylan's saying it better than I can.
[00:24:18.956 --> 00:24:30.439]  Yeah, man thinks that he owns the earth, he can do with it as he pleases.
[00:24:30.439 --> 00:24:34.321]  Big environmental groups have all been promoting nuclear power over
[00:24:36.971 --> 00:24:38.172]  Petroleum-based systems.
[00:24:38.172 --> 00:24:44.357]  I'm not saying petroleum is perfect, but it's nothing compared to the dangers of radiation.
[00:24:44.357 --> 00:25:00.511]  And I was cleaning up the mess I'd made here by pouring a little bit of water on the table, a little more, a little more signifying radiation and how it's going across the Pacific and now already reaching Iceland, soon to reach Europe, and that it continues to build up.
[00:25:01.392 --> 00:25:04.415]  And Jaron made the point, he said, well, why even clean it up?
[00:25:04.415 --> 00:25:13.465]  You know, if this water symbolizes radioactivity, many of these isotopes last billions of years.
[00:25:13.465 --> 00:25:16.929]  So it isn't like water that you can just clean up.
[00:25:18.194 --> 00:25:20.116]  It's something that doesn't go away.
[00:25:20.116 --> 00:25:28.584]  Another analogy would be the first day, one piece of paper, if it signified radiation, was released in Japan.
[00:25:28.584 --> 00:25:31.046]  Then the next day, a thousand pieces of paper.
[00:25:31.046 --> 00:25:33.148]  Then the next day, a million pieces of paper.
[00:25:33.148 --> 00:25:35.590]  Pretty soon, it's a big stack of paper.
[00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:40.075]  And it just continues to pile up in the soil until it is now over.
[00:25:41.058 --> 00:25:42.938]  Last night they said 1,600 times.
[00:25:42.938 --> 00:25:52.561]  Now they're saying even higher than that, and it's gonna be there for the rest of our lifetimes and beyond many of these different radioactive isotopes.
[00:25:52.561 --> 00:25:59.603]  So that's the point, is that it adds more of this to our environment.
[00:25:59.603 --> 00:26:02.744]  But our government knows that it's invisible.
[00:26:02.744 --> 00:26:05.564]  Just like, what did they do with Corexit?
[00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:07.805]  Many times more toxic than the oil itself.
[00:26:08.919 --> 00:26:10.239]  The crude oil.
[00:26:10.239 --> 00:26:23.583]  So they sprayed millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of gallons of Corexit on top of the oil slick so that it wouldn't be visible and it would go to the bottom where it could do even more damage.
[00:26:23.583 --> 00:26:25.423]  Out of sight, out of mind.
[00:26:25.423 --> 00:26:27.864]  See, they couldn't easily hide the oil.
[00:26:27.864 --> 00:26:31.304]  They can hide this because it's invisible.
[00:26:31.304 --> 00:26:36.866]  And they can lie to you and say, well, the background radiation is only up a little bit in the United States of different, you know,
[00:26:39.013 --> 00:27:04.149]  Geiger counter readings, but those Geiger counters don't specifically pick up on what isotopes are hitting or the fact that it's then going to continue to land here for as long as these reactors burn and explode and build up in the soil, in the water, and in our bodies, in the fish we eat, in the beef we eat, in the poultry, in the pork, in the vegetables, in the grains.
[00:27:05.069 --> 00:27:07.672]  It bioaccumulates in the soil.
[00:27:07.672 --> 00:27:13.217]  It's sucked up by the plants that are then fed to the animals that we eat.
[00:27:13.217 --> 00:27:15.940]  And that's why this is so dangerous.
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:23.648]  So they're having to evacuate the plant again because of more black smoke, radioactive smoke coming out.
[00:27:23.648 --> 00:27:28.773]  And the media's answer is to trot out people like Ann Coulter to tell us that radiation is actually good for us.
[00:27:32.134 --> 00:27:33.755]  And here is the headline.
[00:27:33.755 --> 00:27:37.616]  In fact, we're gonna come back from break and play this Russia Today news piece.
[00:27:37.616 --> 00:27:44.819]  Radiation level at Fukushima exceeds norm by 1,600 times.
[00:27:44.819 --> 00:27:51.041]  And it goes on to report that Fukushima workers managed to connect the first
[00:27:51.874 --> 00:27:57.558]  And the fourth reactors of the plant to external power source, that's great news, to help restore the cooling system at the units.
[00:27:57.558 --> 00:28:03.642]  Five of the six units of Fukushima plant have been connected to emergency diesel generators, Kyoto News reported.
[00:28:03.642 --> 00:28:09.606]  However, the electricity supply to the problematic third unit has yet to be switched back on, the unit that blew up.
[00:28:09.606 --> 00:28:15.090]  I mean, do you think even if they connect it, the machinery is going to be working with that mushroom cloud explosion you saw?
[00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.132]  And the photos of it completely shattered a black hulk.
[00:28:24.917 --> 00:28:37.808]  David Lindorf, investigative journalist and founding editor of the newspaper, This Can't Be Happening, explains why it is impossible to prevent just disasters with all the work that's going on in development of peaceful nuclear energy.
[00:28:39.187 --> 00:28:55.639]  I hear people say that it's possible to design these days a safe nuclear plant that has all passive cooling systems, like light pebble, so that if a power fails, you still can keep the plant from going into a meltdown phase.
[00:28:55.639 --> 00:28:57.100]  And maybe that's true.
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:01.343]  But you have to take all the existing plants and shut them down.
[00:29:01.343 --> 00:29:02.664]  They are not salvageable.
[00:29:04.505 --> 00:29:12.147]  And they go on to report on the IAEA announcement of 1,600 times.
[00:29:12.147 --> 00:29:28.430]  The International Atomic Energy Agency announced yesterday, as I said earlier, it's now gone up even more, that the level of radiation 20 kilometers, now they're saying over 20 miles, from the Fukushima facility exceeds the norm by 1,600 times.
[00:29:32.591 --> 00:29:38.135]  And I remember Dr. Bowman saying it would, to really be dangerous, it would have to be a thousand times.
[00:29:38.135 --> 00:29:40.256]  Well, that's what's going on here.
[00:29:40.256 --> 00:29:43.979]  And the food and water supplies have now become contaminated.
[00:29:43.979 --> 00:29:50.743]  We'll continue with the latest on the reactor meltdown cover-up and the radiation levels in Libya.
[00:29:50.743 --> 00:29:52.124]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.124 --> 00:29:54.666]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.666 --> 00:29:57.347]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:07.561]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:30:07.561 --> 00:30:12.702]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:30:12.702 --> 00:30:21.424]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:30:21.424 --> 00:30:25.485]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:30:25.485 --> 00:30:27.446]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:30:29.933 --> 00:30:34.514]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:30:34.514 --> 00:30:38.355]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:30:38.355 --> 00:30:39.575]  Others don't.
[00:30:39.575 --> 00:30:41.715]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:30:41.715 --> 00:30:43.516]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:30:43.516 --> 00:30:46.396]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:30:46.396 --> 00:30:53.018]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:30:53.018 --> 00:30:55.718]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:30:55.718 --> 00:30:58.079]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:30:58.079 --> 00:30:58.959]  Others don't.
[00:31:00.114 --> 00:31:04.677]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.677 --> 00:31:05.577]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.577 --> 00:31:08.999]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.999 --> 00:31:09.860]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:14.763]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.763 --> 00:31:15.503]  It's true.
[00:31:15.503 --> 00:31:20.386]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.386 --> 00:31:21.206]  Number 3.
[00:31:21.206 --> 00:31:24.788]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.788 --> 00:31:28.711]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.711 --> 00:31:28.971]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.491 --> 00:31:32.254]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.254 --> 00:31:35.537]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.537 --> 00:31:41.063]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:33:07.955 --> 00:33:12.462]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:12.462 --> 00:33:17.269]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:20.374]  Radiation in the water, fire in the sky.
[00:33:24.082 --> 00:33:28.143]  I want to get into the huge new developments on the Libya front.
[00:33:28.143 --> 00:33:47.168]  First, I need to finish up with the latest radiation fallout information and the attempt by the media to distract us with the war, what's happening with Obama's ill reception by the population of South America.
[00:33:47.168 --> 00:33:48.508]  He's cutting his trip short.
[00:33:49.906 --> 00:33:54.771]  The media also trying to distract us with the NCAA garbage.
[00:33:54.771 --> 00:34:02.158]  Homeland Security has come out and put out alerts warning everyone to look for terrorists at the NCAA.
[00:34:02.158 --> 00:34:06.342]  The federal government basically taking over society in the name of safety.
[00:34:06.342 --> 00:34:07.544]  Also an incredible
[00:34:08.832 --> 00:34:18.378]  Announcement yesterday via CNBC by the Dallas head of the Federal Reserve saying that the U.S.
[00:34:18.378 --> 00:34:23.481]  is approaching insolvency and that the fix is to be painful.
[00:34:23.481 --> 00:34:30.085]  The fix is to give the bankers everything and capitulate totally like a third world nation so they can rob us even more.
[00:34:30.085 --> 00:34:33.327]  So we're going to be breaking that down also.
[00:34:33.327 --> 00:34:36.329]  Big report put out by Glenn Beck yesterday that is important.
[00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:41.633]  The left's economic terrorism playbook, coalition destroy U.S.
[00:34:41.633 --> 00:34:48.500]  capitalism and redistribute wealth, this by one of the big union heads.
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.281]  But there's a twist to this.
[00:34:50.281 --> 00:34:59.990]  Remember the economic terrorism engaged in by the Federal Reserve in October of 2008 when they said, give us trillions of dollars or we will destroy the economy.
[00:35:01.091 --> 00:35:16.828]  And I want to warn the globalist-controlled unions that if they are successful in trying to crash the stock market coming up in June, that the globalists will then blame all of the oncoming depression on you.
[00:35:17.529 --> 00:35:23.713]  So you're stumbling directly into complete and total Patsyville with that.
[00:35:23.713 --> 00:35:26.555]  So we're going to be going over that as well today.
[00:35:26.555 --> 00:35:29.277]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:35:29.277 --> 00:35:30.378]  800-259-9231.
[00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:36.222]  I do want to add first-time callers.
[00:35:36.222 --> 00:35:37.803]  I forgot to add that proviso.
[00:35:37.803 --> 00:35:40.384]  I want to give first-time callers every few weeks a chance.
[00:35:40.384 --> 00:35:43.627]  So it'll be first-time callers today on the broadcast.
[00:35:43.627 --> 00:35:43.667]  800-259-9231.
[00:35:49.409 --> 00:36:14.974]  To finish up with the latest information on the reactor, here is the Russia Today piece on the 1,600 times normal levels of radiation in the ground and water supply of Japan out to 20 kilometers or more from the Fukushima disaster site where they've had to evacuate again because of radioactive smoke belching out of one of the reactors in the ongoing crisis.
[00:36:14.974 --> 00:36:15.334]  Here it is.
[00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:23.813]  Japan now, and reports suggest workers have restored electricity to five of the six reactors at the Fukushima nuclear plant.
[00:36:23.813 --> 00:36:30.436]  It comes as Japan has resumed its efforts to solve the atomic crisis following unexplained emissions of smoke.
[00:36:30.436 --> 00:36:32.697]  Martise Igorogorovna is following events.
[00:36:34.215 --> 00:36:38.521]  The focus has shifted onto the impact of the radiation which has already been released.
[00:36:38.521 --> 00:36:47.452]  The authorities are saying that in some of the areas around the plant, the radiation levels are 1,600 times higher than they should be normally.
[00:36:47.452 --> 00:36:49.675]  Villagers in nearby settlements have been told
[00:36:50.075 --> 00:36:53.918]  Not to drink their tap water because it contains possible radioactive elements.
[00:36:53.918 --> 00:36:56.459]  Instead they're being given bottled water.
[00:36:56.459 --> 00:37:04.805]  There's also suspicion that some of the marine life around the plant on the coast has been poisoned as well and that may pose some sort of risk to the fisheries.
[00:37:04.805 --> 00:37:11.529]  We've also had scares over the weekend and afterwards that some of the agricultural produce from that area may be contaminated as well.
[00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:19.174]  Now the authorities are saying that the levels are safe but of course there is still a level of anxiety amongst Japanese people and even people further abroad
[00:37:19.494 --> 00:37:21.896]  As to the possible risks of radiation.
[00:37:21.896 --> 00:37:27.501]  Of course there is still the impact of the earthquake and the tsunami which has recently struck Japan.
[00:37:27.501 --> 00:37:30.944]  The police are saying that 9,000 people have been confirmed as dead.
[00:37:30.944 --> 00:37:32.685]  More than 12,000 is missing.
[00:37:32.685 --> 00:37:36.108]  300,000 or more than that remain homeless.
[00:37:36.108 --> 00:37:40.192]  And of course the number of the confirmed dead is likely to grow over the next few weeks.
[00:37:42.108 --> 00:37:56.596]  Okay, and the rest of that video is linked up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com or you can simply go to RT's website RT.com and find all of that information.
[00:37:56.596 --> 00:38:01.479]  And Japanese papers, I don't just go with one source, they are also confirming 1,600 times or higher
[00:38:04.423 --> 00:38:08.527]  Now, you notice that Ann Coulter has not taken up our offer.
[00:38:08.527 --> 00:38:13.971]  We have called the speaking bureau that books her and they have basically hung up on us.
[00:38:13.971 --> 00:38:15.773]  They've hung up on our listeners who've called.
[00:38:15.773 --> 00:38:22.759]  We linked to it an article with the headline InfoWars.com is offering to send Ann Coulter to Fukushima.
[00:38:23.499 --> 00:38:28.403]  And I think she should go to the nearby towns and drink the water directly out of the tap.
[00:38:28.403 --> 00:38:33.948]  She should eat the food and she should ask to visit the reactor and help.
[00:38:33.948 --> 00:38:34.488]  Even though the U.S.
[00:38:34.488 --> 00:38:40.994]  military's pulled out 11 days ago and refused to help and is talking about a mandatory evacuation of U.S.
[00:38:40.994 --> 00:38:42.775]  military personnel and U.S.
[00:38:42.775 --> 00:38:45.658]  government workers.
[00:38:45.658 --> 00:38:50.342]  They must be crazy because Ann Coulter says that there's no radiation problem.
[00:38:51.663 --> 00:39:01.170]  1,600 times and growing as it continues to belch radiation all over that area of Japan and then most of it going out to sea towards the west coast.
[00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:01.991]  Anne, we're waiting.
[00:39:01.991 --> 00:39:13.180]  We've called the Speakers Bureau that books her and they get very upset that we even are talking about getting her to travel there and that we shouldn't be joking around about radiation.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:17.324]  Well, we're not the ones joking around about it.
[00:39:17.324 --> 00:39:18.344]  Anne can be a big hero.
[00:39:19.245 --> 00:39:30.159]  And she needs to get on down to Fukushima and she can maybe move into one of these shattered reactors that's smoking and because she said you won't get cancer.
[00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:33.844]  I mean, if you get radiation, she said the people getting this radiation, we're not going to get cancer now.
[00:39:34.952 --> 00:39:46.622]  So please, Anne, I mean, please go to Japan and drink the water and maybe go fishing right off the coast there where hundreds of thousands of fuel rods were ejected out into the ocean.
[00:39:46.622 --> 00:39:53.388]  It's just a few dozen yards away from the water and you saw them ejected in all directions, stored on top.
[00:39:53.388 --> 00:40:02.276]  But now I see why the plant owners, Tokyo Power and Electric, did store the 600,000 plus fuel rods on top of the reactors at Blue Sky High.
[00:40:04.145 --> 00:40:09.289]  And why they built the reactors on a fault line, that's because radiation is good for you.
[00:40:09.289 --> 00:40:21.759]  And so it's good to build on fault lines in a tsunami zone on the coast, and it's good to store the spent fuel rods on top of the live reactors because the radiation is good.
[00:40:21.759 --> 00:40:26.183]  See, I'm not going to be a conspiracy theorist anymore and question things.
[00:40:26.183 --> 00:40:33.249]  When the Bill of Rights is violated, I'll just say that's a conspiracy theory when the government admits they're listening to us without warrants.
[00:40:33.991 --> 00:40:39.753]  Or when they set up illegal federally funded checkpoints, or when the TSA sets up checkpoints on highways.
[00:40:39.753 --> 00:40:41.754]  Sure, it's unconstitutional.
[00:40:41.754 --> 00:40:43.975]  Sure, radiation's deadly.
[00:40:43.975 --> 00:40:46.156]  Sure, DU's bad for the troops.
[00:40:46.156 --> 00:40:56.161]  Sure, fractional reserve banking is bad for the economy, but I can wave a magic Ann Coulter wand, and then that will make everything okay.
[00:40:56.161 --> 00:40:58.401]  And you know, folks, we don't really get into Ann Coulter here.
[00:40:58.401 --> 00:41:00.562]  I'm not bashing her just to bash her.
[00:41:02.043 --> 00:41:08.466]  She has completely discredited herself and discredited some of the good things she talks about.
[00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:10.687]  She says she likes Ron Paul.
[00:41:10.687 --> 00:41:16.529]  She says that we should end some of these wars because we're bankrupt.
[00:41:16.529 --> 00:41:26.373]  But now that kind of discredits the serious things she talks about by being such a willing tart for the nuclear power industry.
[00:41:28.027 --> 00:41:32.072]  Okay, let me punch up the phone calls here.
[00:41:32.072 --> 00:41:35.857]  JB, Jamie, Kevin, Scott, William, and others.
[00:41:37.062 --> 00:41:46.066]  We are going to get to you here in just a few minutes, and I'm gonna get more into this later in the broadcast in more detail, because there's so much news on it.
[00:41:46.066 --> 00:41:50.588]  But right now, let me just give you some of the basic new developments going on.
[00:41:50.588 --> 00:41:58.632]  Big France 24 television, big national TV reports, we are not at war, says Philon.
[00:41:58.632 --> 00:42:01.994]  Three days after the start of the international military mission over Libya,
[00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:13.497]  French Prime Minister defended France's involvement in Libya during Tuesday's parliamentary debate, opening the debate on French involvement in Libya.
[00:42:13.497 --> 00:42:23.603]  French Prime Minister reiterated, or I would say regurgitated, the intervention was intended to stop attacks against Libyan civilians and nothing more.
[00:42:23.603 --> 00:42:26.264]  He went on to say, we are not at war with Libya, really.
[00:42:26.264 --> 00:42:28.206]  You've got ground forces preparing to invade.
[00:42:29.529 --> 00:42:34.214]  Um, there's bombardments all over the country, including government buildings.
[00:42:34.214 --> 00:42:35.515]  If that's not a war, what is?
[00:42:35.515 --> 00:42:47.687]  I guess, I know fly zone now means a full bombardment and a prepared ground invasion and rebels being armed out of Saudi Arabia and Egypt through Western Egypt into Eastern
[00:42:49.983 --> 00:42:51.184]  Libya.
[00:42:51.184 --> 00:42:56.307]  Now, if that isn't a war, I don't know what is, but the French Prime Minister says that it's not a war.
[00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:58.149]  And Ann Coulter says radiation's good for you.
[00:42:58.149 --> 00:43:01.111]  So, yeah, I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist.
[00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:06.895]  Being a conspiracy theorist is questioning government, is being informed, is not being a chump.
[00:43:07.515 --> 00:43:10.357]  Not being a sucker, but I want to be establishment.
[00:43:10.357 --> 00:43:13.898]  So I agree this is not a war.
[00:43:13.898 --> 00:43:16.120]  Kind of like we have video clips.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:29.347]  In fact, get that one ready from MSNBC in 2007 when Senator Biden, soon to be candidate Biden at the time for vice president, Biden said that if Bush attacked Iran, he would move for total impeachment.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:50.389]  Because you've got to have a congressional, you really, under the law, you're supposed to have a declaration of war and then orders of the president, but now, you know, they started eroding that by setting up these little congressional statements or these congressional authorizations that are these blank, blank checks to use force.
[00:43:50.389 --> 00:43:55.431]  Now, I mean, if you're not gonna have a declaration of war, why even have the authorization?
[00:43:56.752 --> 00:43:59.477]  Which, because, I mean, if you're going to be unconstitutional, why not go the whole way?
[00:43:59.477 --> 00:44:04.626]  Why not have the UN last Thursday night announce that
[00:44:06.257 --> 00:44:18.561]  There need to be a no-fly zone and bombardment and possible invasion, and then have the UN pass the resolution, and then debate it on Friday, and then on Saturday, attacks are launched on Libya.
[00:44:18.561 --> 00:44:29.385]  No statement from Congress, not even an attempt by the President, who was busy getting ready to go to South America on his trip where he was universally decried and protested.
[00:44:30.643 --> 00:44:31.364]  We're good to go.
[00:44:39.571 --> 00:44:42.933]  Of course, they lied about him strafing crowds and running away to Venezuela.
[00:44:42.933 --> 00:44:49.477]  I mean, the point is, the guy's not a nice guy, but they're exaggerating, they're lying, and they've got a double hypocritical standard.
[00:44:49.477 --> 00:44:51.299]  So that's all going on.
[00:44:51.299 --> 00:44:54.801]  Camp Lejeune Marines to Libya.
[00:44:54.801 --> 00:45:00.665]  Local television, WCTI 12, is reporting, and they've got the Marine commander
[00:45:02.021 --> 00:45:16.410]  of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, 2,200 Marines of the MEU saying their mission is to help end the violence in Libya and that they're being delivered to the troop landing ships in the Mediterranean.
[00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:20.112]  Quote, in Libya right now, they're doing exactly what we need them to do.
[00:45:20.112 --> 00:45:27.336]  They are doing what they are told and right now that's protecting Libyan people against Qaddafi's forces, said Captain Timothy Patrick, a Marine with the 26th MEU.
[00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:43.578]  And they go on to update the article, the Marines put out the statement that the UN Security Council towards resolving the unrest in Libya includes the removal of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's forces from major cities.
[00:45:43.578 --> 00:45:57.928]  These latest strikes by the MEU aimed at preserving the sanctity of the city and the safety of the civilians within, in an effort to safeguard the Libyan populace and infrastructure in and around the city of Adjib.
[00:45:58.568 --> 00:46:00.409]  I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[00:46:00.409 --> 00:46:03.310]  A-J-D-A-B-I-Y-A-H.
[00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:16.575]  From further attacks by the regime forces, the 26th MEU, as part of the Joint Task Force Odyssey Dawn, launched a second round of strikes by AV-8B Harrier jump jets.
[00:46:16.575 --> 00:46:20.537]  And then again, they're delivering the 2,200 troops for possible ground invasion.
[00:46:21.806 --> 00:46:34.433]  You know, when that F-15E crashed outside of Benghazi, that's Al-Qaeda, globalist allied held, I mean, that's one and Telegraph, CNN, the bold, wonderful, heroic Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:34.433 --> 00:46:37.475]  I don't agree with that, I don't like Al-Qaeda, but again, I'm the bad guy.
[00:46:37.475 --> 00:46:39.636]  I'm the anti-American, remember.
[00:46:39.636 --> 00:46:44.238]  I don't like the troops having their death benefits stolen secretly 11 years ago, now in Bloomberg and AP.
[00:46:46.281 --> 00:46:47.622]  I'm evil.
[00:46:47.622 --> 00:46:49.483]  I'm really a bad guy.
[00:46:49.483 --> 00:46:51.685]  And you can hate me, because I'm not for Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:51.685 --> 00:46:55.248]  I'm sorry, I'm not for Gaddafi either, but I'm really not for Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:55.248 --> 00:47:01.972]  I'm not for Amr al-Awlaki, Fox News reporting, secretly hanging out at the Pentagon getting orders and running every major attack inside the U.S.
[00:47:01.972 --> 00:47:02.333]  and Europe.
[00:47:03.254 --> 00:47:13.219]  From the shoe bomber, to the underwear bomber, to the four-hood killer, to, well, just everybody involved in the 7-7 bombings in London in 2005.
[00:47:13.219 --> 00:47:17.962]  So, Camp Lejeune Marines head to Libya.
[00:47:17.962 --> 00:47:19.563]  Well, the coalition's not going too well.
[00:47:19.563 --> 00:47:20.443]  Who's in charge?
[00:47:20.443 --> 00:47:23.985]  Germans pull forces out of NATO as Libyan coalition falls apart.
[00:47:23.985 --> 00:47:25.486]  But I forgot to finish the other point.
[00:47:25.486 --> 00:47:26.627]  When that jet crashed,
[00:47:30.498 --> 00:47:38.365]  They report that a army helicopter coming to rescue the pilots attacked and shot a bunch of people, shot six people.
[00:47:38.365 --> 00:47:45.251]  But the father of the little boy who may have his leg amputated says he loves America, hates Qaddafi, and he understands.
[00:47:46.258 --> 00:47:52.203]  And the pilots were aided by local residents who are not fans of Gaddafi.
[00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:54.564]  We can't say they're Al Qaeda, we don't know.
[00:47:54.564 --> 00:48:03.611]  And then the helicopter came and just opened up on them, even though they were reportedly cheering them and they delivered the pilots to them.
[00:48:03.611 --> 00:48:06.534]  But hey, they're brown people, kill them immediately.
[00:48:06.534 --> 00:48:12.078]  And the father is like, thank you so much for blowing part of my son's leg off.
[00:48:12.078 --> 00:48:14.259]  That's actually in the news as well.
[00:48:15.896 --> 00:48:17.378]  Again, he'd make a good American.
[00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:32.911]  Crude oil.
[00:48:32.911 --> 00:48:40.958]  Obama seeks to break impasse over Libya and over the fact that a whole bunch of the NATO members are either threatening to remove themselves or removing themselves.
[00:48:40.958 --> 00:48:44.322]  And again, that's in the mail story, the Daily Mail.
[00:48:44.322 --> 00:48:53.210]  Deep divisions between Allied forces currently bombing Libya worsened today as the German military announced its pulling forces out of NATO over the continued disagreement over who will lead the campaign.
[00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:54.611]  Germany didn't send its forces.
[00:48:54.611 --> 00:48:57.654]  Now they're, quote, pulling out of NATO partially.
[00:48:59.287 --> 00:49:09.771]  A German military spokesman said it was cancelling two frigates and AWACS surveillance plane crews from the Mediterranean after fears that they would be drawn into the conflict if NATO takes over control from the US.
[00:49:09.771 --> 00:49:19.655]  The infighting comes as a heated meeting of NATO ambassadors yesterday failed to resolve the 28-nation alliance should run the operation to enforce the UN-mandated no-fly zone, diplomats said.
[00:49:19.655 --> 00:49:22.476]  See, what's Obama doing here?
[00:49:22.476 --> 00:49:24.316]  He's a globalist.
[00:49:24.316 --> 00:49:26.197]  He hands us over to the Federal Reserve.
[00:49:26.197 --> 00:49:28.298]  He takes the baton from Bush, accelerates the looting.
[00:49:29.312 --> 00:49:33.555]  Getting things left cover, suppressing his base of moronic idiots.
[00:49:33.555 --> 00:49:36.637]  Then, of childlike morons.
[00:49:36.637 --> 00:49:39.398]  I mean, he's expanded the wars, the torture, the wiretapping.
[00:49:39.398 --> 00:49:49.385]  You so-called liberals who love to moralize about Bush, now you hail his wars, you worship them, you get off on them, you say it's good.
[00:49:49.385 --> 00:49:52.166]  I was watching MSNBC the other night, they were doing it.
[00:49:52.166 --> 00:49:53.167]  This is disgusting.
[00:49:54.514 --> 00:49:56.355]  But notice what Obama's done.
[00:49:56.355 --> 00:50:11.943]  For the first time in America's 235 year history, the president openly took orders from the United Nations and did not even pretend to consult Congress.
[00:50:11.943 --> 00:50:14.505]  That's totally being removed from the equation.
[00:50:14.505 --> 00:50:17.106]  The emperor doesn't need his regional governors anymore.
[00:50:18.715 --> 00:50:19.475]  That's impossible.
[00:50:19.475 --> 00:50:21.656]  Who will maintain over the bureaucracy?
[00:50:21.656 --> 00:50:23.997]  Fear will keep the local systems in line.
[00:50:23.997 --> 00:50:27.418]  Fear of the NATO war machine.
[00:50:27.418 --> 00:50:33.940]  So, he's delivered us under UN control, and now NATO is taking control of the operation from the United States.
[00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:36.820]  See, that's what this is all about.
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:45.243]  Foreign gaggles of bureaucrats, unelected, running our military, running our banking, running our government.
[00:50:46.417 --> 00:50:51.100]  J.B., Jamie, Kevin, Scott, William, your calls coming up in the next two segments.
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:56.583]  Then we're going to look at food price increases, the economy, the Federal Reserve saying the U.S.
[00:50:56.583 --> 00:50:58.725]  approaching insolvency.
[00:50:58.725 --> 00:50:59.125]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.905 --> 00:51:05.566]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:00.696 --> 00:52:02.200]  America, you've been warned.
[00:52:09.718 --> 00:52:13.040]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:16.702]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[00:52:16.702 --> 00:52:17.523]  Have you?
[00:52:17.523 --> 00:52:21.105]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war, or the stock market.
[00:52:21.105 --> 00:52:23.606]  Yet it could change everything about your normal way of life.
[00:52:23.606 --> 00:52:28.829]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:30.010]  Could this really happen?
[00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:33.992]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[00:52:33.992 --> 00:52:36.914]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae.
[00:52:42.227 --> 00:52:42.627]  We're good.
[00:53:00.495 --> 00:53:03.717]  Do you want to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead?
[00:53:03.717 --> 00:53:08.639]  Have you ever thought about actually getting off the grid and becoming truly self-reliant?

[00:54:20.894 --> 00:54:30.445]  If we don't have the Bill of Rights and Constitution, if we don't enforce it as the rightful sovereigns of this republic, we are slaves.
[00:54:30.445 --> 00:54:33.829]  That is the history of the world, the history of civilization.
[00:54:35.399 --> 00:54:49.541]  And I do not have words to express to you how grievous an injury to our republic it is to have NATO running the military operations the Congress never consulted, the United Nations giving the order.
[00:54:50.814 --> 00:55:00.903]  Those statements stand on their own, just like six years ago when the SPP was signed, the Security Prosperity Partnership for North American Union, and it was secret.
[00:55:00.903 --> 00:55:13.275]  Judicial Watch sued, I talk about this a lot because it's so key, and got thousands of pages of documents, we cover it in Endgame, and the first thing in the event, in the meeting, is we must integrate North America by stealth.
[00:55:14.471 --> 00:55:25.458]  Now, a month ago, they formalized the North American security perimeter and publicly admitted that the treaty will have Mexican and Canadian troops operating in the U.S.
[00:55:25.458 --> 00:55:27.379]  for civil insurrection.
[00:55:27.379 --> 00:55:30.061]  Now, that's in major newspapers.
[00:55:30.061 --> 00:55:34.384]  Ottawa Citizen, Associated Press, no one covers it.
[00:55:35.658 --> 00:55:38.499]  I beg powerhouses like Glenn Beck to talk about that.
[00:55:38.499 --> 00:55:41.340]  But see, he never will criticize the Pentagon.
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:42.881]  It's not our military.
[00:55:42.881 --> 00:55:44.301]  It's run by traitors.
[00:55:44.301 --> 00:55:47.823]  The average person in the military joined because they care about liberty.
[00:55:50.236 --> 00:55:51.256]  They don't get promoted.
[00:55:51.256 --> 00:55:54.358]  The scumbags that'll torture people to death do.
[00:55:54.358 --> 00:55:59.820]  And then our name, our country, gets trashed when our country's being used by the New World Order.
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.200]  Not in our name.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.901]  Not in the United Nations name.
[00:56:02.901 --> 00:56:12.484]  Remember Michael New refusing to go under UN command in Bosnia, in Macedonia?
[00:56:12.484 --> 00:56:16.085]  Now there's not even a discussion about this.
[00:56:16.085 --> 00:56:16.886]  This is a big deal.
[00:56:17.984 --> 00:56:22.625]  And I commend the Drudge Report, he's been leading with it, pointing out that it's unconstitutional.
[00:56:22.625 --> 00:56:25.405]  But who else is covering?
[00:56:25.405 --> 00:56:26.106]  We are.
[00:56:26.106 --> 00:56:32.507]  I saw it on our Facebook yesterday, then I saw it on Drudge today, with Biden up there saying he would impeach anybody.
[00:56:32.507 --> 00:56:36.048]  And I said I'd go to your calls, but I've got to play this clip.
[00:56:36.048 --> 00:56:42.589]  Here's Biden on MSNBC saying he would go after Bush for impeachment in the US Senate if
[00:56:43.775 --> 00:56:47.656]  If he launched a war against Iran without congressional approval.
[00:56:47.656 --> 00:56:48.537]  Here it is.
[00:56:48.537 --> 00:56:54.639]  You said that if the President of the United States had launched an attack on Iran without congressional approval, that would have been an impeachable offense.
[00:56:54.639 --> 00:56:56.320]  Do you want to review that comment you made?
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:56.860]  Absolutely.
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:57.960]  Well, how do you stand on that now?
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.560]  Yes, I do.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.281]  I want to stand by that comment I made.
[00:57:00.281 --> 00:57:03.382]  The reason I made the comment was as a warning.
[00:57:03.382 --> 00:57:05.883]  The reason I made... I don't say those things lightly, Chris.
[00:57:05.883 --> 00:57:07.704]  You've known me for a long time.
[00:57:07.704 --> 00:57:11.165]  I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee for 17 years, or its ranking member.
[00:57:11.605 --> 00:57:14.207]  I teach separation of powers and constitutional law.
[00:57:14.207 --> 00:57:15.628]  This is something I know.
[00:57:15.628 --> 00:57:34.764]  So I got together and brought a group of constitutional scholars together to write a piece that I'm going to deliver to the whole United States Senate pointing out the President has no constitutional authority to take this nation to war against a country of 70 million people unless we're attacked or unless there is proof that we are about to be attacked.
[00:57:34.764 --> 00:57:36.826]  And if he does, if he does,
[00:57:37.646 --> 00:57:39.628]  I would move to impeach him.
[00:57:39.628 --> 00:57:43.591]  The House obviously has to do that, but I would lead an effort to impeach him.
[00:57:43.591 --> 00:57:46.254]  The reason for my doing that, I don't say it lightly.
[00:57:46.254 --> 00:57:47.855]  I don't say it lightly.
[00:57:47.855 --> 00:57:52.879]  By the way, you don't need to be a constitutional law scholar and a lawyer.
[00:57:52.879 --> 00:57:57.363]  That's 101 that Congress declares war.
[00:57:57.363 --> 00:58:00.746]  I mean, that is 101.
[00:58:00.746 --> 00:58:03.749]  But notice, Congress doesn't control the issuance of our currency and credit.
[00:58:03.749 --> 00:58:04.830]  Private Federal Reserve does.
[00:58:05.799 --> 00:58:10.645]  Now Congress doesn't even have a say or doesn't even try to stand up and have a say.
[00:58:10.645 --> 00:58:13.329]  That's an even bigger issue.
[00:58:13.329 --> 00:58:14.811]  This happened last Thursday.
[00:58:14.811 --> 00:58:17.394]  Obama went along with the attack Friday.
[00:58:17.394 --> 00:58:22.420]  It's now Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, five days later into the attack.
[00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:27.653]  And not a word from Congress saying, hey, you can't do that.
[00:58:27.653 --> 00:58:32.917]  Talk about a servile, disgusting group, and disgusting Republicans are all going along with it.
[00:58:32.917 --> 00:58:35.038]  It's only a few Democrats that are against it.
[00:58:35.038 --> 00:58:44.345]  That tells you everything you need to know about those servile Republicans.
[00:58:44.345 --> 00:58:48.108]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.815 --> 00:58:55.816]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.816 --> 00:58:59.057]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:59.057 --> 00:59:03.858]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:03.858 --> 00:59:10.240]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.481]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:13.021 --> 00:59:14.522]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:59:14.522 --> 00:59:15.802]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:15.802 --> 00:59:18.043]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.929 --> 00:59:34.071]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:39.214]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:39.214 --> 00:59:53.545]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:53.545 --> 00:59:55.927]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.927 --> 00:59:58.689]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.305 --> 01:00:10.129]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.129 --> 01:00:11.731]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.731 --> 01:00:13.272]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.272 --> 01:00:17.455]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.455 --> 01:00:19.797]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.698 --> 01:00:21.639]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.639 --> 01:00:23.560]  All right, we're into hour number two.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.362]  We have a little guest popping into the next segment, then we'll be open phones for the rest of the hour.
[01:00:27.362 --> 01:00:33.986]  I'm gonna give it to JB, Jamie, and then at the 24 after, we'll start getting to Kevin, Scott, William, and others.
[01:00:33.986 --> 01:00:36.368]  I'm gonna get to all of you first-time callers only today.
[01:00:36.368 --> 01:00:36.428]  800-259-9231.
[01:00:36.428 --> 01:00:39.449]  1,600 times regular safe levels background radiation in Japan, areas of Japan right now.
[01:00:47.695 --> 01:00:50.316]  You've got this coalition in NATO breaking up.
[01:00:50.316 --> 01:01:04.126]  You've got the scandal of Obama putting us directly under UN control without even trying to reach out to Congress and Congress has laid down and taken it except for Ron Paul saying this is part of the birth of world government correctly.
[01:01:04.126 --> 01:01:04.886]  Only Ron Paul.
[01:01:04.886 --> 01:01:06.107]  We've heard a little bit from Rand Paul.
[01:01:06.107 --> 01:01:06.468]  That's it.
[01:01:07.208 --> 01:01:07.528]  That's it.
[01:01:07.528 --> 01:01:08.929]  And a few Democrats.
[01:01:08.929 --> 01:01:10.571]  Truly disgusting.
[01:01:10.571 --> 01:01:13.873]  We've got a lot of other economic news coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:13.873 --> 01:01:14.174]  U.S.
[01:01:14.174 --> 01:01:15.555]  approaching insolvency.
[01:01:15.555 --> 01:01:17.436]  That's what the Dallas Fed chief said.
[01:01:17.436 --> 01:01:18.637]  Better listen up.
[01:01:18.637 --> 01:01:19.158]  J.B.
[01:01:19.158 --> 01:01:21.039]  and Tejas in Texas.
[01:01:21.039 --> 01:01:22.120]  You're on the air, J.B.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.301]  Thanks for holding.
[01:01:23.301 --> 01:01:24.222]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:24.802]  I'm doing all right.
[01:01:24.802 --> 01:01:26.524]  A little bit of horse today for some reason.
[01:01:26.524 --> 01:01:28.165]  Man, you got one heck of a show, I tell you.
[01:01:28.165 --> 01:01:31.508]  Man, I've seen your endgame on, played on the network here in Houston on 55 Channel.
[01:01:32.609 --> 01:01:35.871]  And, like, Fourth Largest City was watching that movie and just freaking out, man.
[01:01:35.871 --> 01:01:39.514]  I had people call me going, wow, I didn't know it was all coming down, man.
[01:01:39.514 --> 01:01:41.975]  Well, that film was made almost four years ago.
[01:01:41.975 --> 01:01:50.961]  There's a lot of liberty-loving people that own TV stations and cable channels, airing and broadcast TV, airing my films all over the country.
[01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:52.222]  It's wonderful.
[01:01:52.222 --> 01:01:53.583]  Yeah, I had people call me.
[01:01:53.583 --> 01:01:56.284]  They were just totally tripping out because I've been talking about what you've been talking about.
[01:01:56.284 --> 01:01:57.805]  And they said, well, that can't be.
[01:01:57.805 --> 01:01:58.746]  I said, well, watch this flick.
[01:01:58.746 --> 01:01:59.626]  You'll freak.
[01:01:59.626 --> 01:02:01.768]  And they were just freaking out, man.
[01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:08.517]  And I was going to call you and ask you, you know NASA, they done thrown them a bone where they can't do any more space flights.
[01:02:08.517 --> 01:02:14.966]  Won't these super duper NASA engineers and scientists see if they can make some kind of a repair on that reactor?
[01:02:14.966 --> 01:02:17.169]  I mean they can make stuff that unfolds in space.
[01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:19.551]  They could make a cover for that thing to keep people.
[01:02:19.551 --> 01:02:38.731]  Well here's the deal they could put together a new giant dome in pieces and then weld it together but it's built on the ocean and there's a water table right there so it's going down into the water table into the aquifer in Japan that's under that they built it on an earthquake fault line one of the most
[01:02:39.492 --> 01:02:47.770]  Geologically unstable areas in the world where they have tsunamis and stored the 39 years of spent fuel rods on top of it.
[01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:48.692]  Doesn't sound too smart.
[01:02:49.505 --> 01:02:53.788]  Well, I don't see any quality safety or productivity control or anything.
[01:02:53.788 --> 01:02:55.089]  I don't see any safety in there.
[01:02:55.089 --> 01:02:57.250]  I don't know what they were drinking, what they were thinking.
[01:02:57.250 --> 01:02:58.812]  But let me just say this.
[01:02:58.812 --> 01:02:59.792]  NASA's not working.
[01:02:59.792 --> 01:03:00.473]  Put them to work.
[01:03:00.473 --> 01:03:09.539]  They can fan fold the cover of the thing, get the air cleaned out, and then they can go and work underneath there and see if they can put some liquid nitrogen and some other stuff in there and take care of the cooling of it.
[01:03:09.599 --> 01:03:10.399]  Well, that's a good idea.
[01:03:10.399 --> 01:03:16.623]  They could actually drill in and start pumping the water out into containers they then ship out.
[01:03:16.623 --> 01:03:24.548]  That's a good idea, but see, they need the water there to keep it cooled, but it's all shattered from the explosions, so it's a catch-22.
[01:03:24.548 --> 01:03:27.730]  And they're sending in firefighters and police.
[01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:35.475]  Most of the plant workers refuse to go back in, and in the Warrior Society in Japan, the whole samurai thing has been handed down to the firefighters and police.
[01:03:36.598 --> 01:03:42.260]  Do you think our cops would go bathe themselves in the radiation that's going to kill them?
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.161]  I don't think they would.
[01:03:43.161 --> 01:03:47.343]  I'll say this, those 50 guys are probably the most bravest guys I've ever heard of.
[01:03:47.343 --> 01:03:51.784]  I know we've got some brave guys in the military here, but I'm talking about Bo Grites, he's one of the bravest.
[01:03:51.784 --> 01:03:57.427]  I mean, you know, and what you're doing, you're brave for speaking your mind and all, but these cats have to be over the top, you know?
[01:03:58.291 --> 01:03:59.712]  Well, they're true warriors.
[01:03:59.712 --> 01:04:10.262]  I mean, they see themselves as basically the warrior ants in the anthill, and they're there to die, and that's what they've said, but they're not trained.
[01:04:10.262 --> 01:04:16.088]  The military and the firefighters and the police, that's who they've got in there, are not trained.
[01:04:16.088 --> 01:04:23.095]  And so they're in there with fire hoses up against reactors that are basically boiling high radiation out on them.
[01:04:23.695 --> 01:04:33.621]  And when they say 50, it's actually several hundred that they rotate through, but 50 at a time, and it's a serious battle, and I appreciate your call, JB.
[01:04:33.621 --> 01:04:38.284]  Now, I'm gonna get into some economic news coming up for one segment, and I promise I'll hurry through calls.
[01:04:38.284 --> 01:04:38.964]  I'll try my best.
[01:04:38.964 --> 01:04:42.367]  Jamie, Kevin, Scott, William, and others, first-time callers today, 800-259-9231.
[01:04:42.367 --> 01:04:42.927]  But after the break,
[01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:48.510]  U.S.
[01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:51.432]  approaching insolvency fixed to be painful.
[01:04:51.432 --> 01:04:55.796]  The head of the Dallas Fed says we'll cover this and what it signifies on the other side.
[01:04:55.796 --> 01:04:56.236]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.784 --> 01:05:08.829]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:11.491]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:20.538]  Ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[01:05:20.538 --> 01:05:28.805]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[01:05:28.805 --> 01:05:30.586]  Move quickly while you can still afford it.
[01:05:30.826 --> 01:05:31.486]  We're good to go.
[01:06:00.285 --> 01:06:01.446]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:06:01.446 --> 01:06:08.389]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:08.389 --> 01:06:10.951]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:06:10.951 --> 01:06:16.333]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:19.375]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:21.436]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:06:21.676 --> 01:06:27.941]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:27.941 --> 01:06:31.303]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:06:31.303 --> 01:06:37.107]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:06:37.107 --> 01:06:38.728]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:40.029]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:42.711]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:06:42.711 --> 01:06:46.934]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:06:46.934 --> 01:06:48.976]  You can find the video at www.
[01:06:49.716 --> 01:06:51.540]  End of America 3.com.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:54.126]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:06:58.016 --> 01:06:59.018]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:07:00.066 --> 01:07:04.268]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:07:04.268 --> 01:07:10.692]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:07:10.692 --> 01:07:18.075]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:07:18.075 --> 01:07:22.618]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:31.606]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:07:31.606 --> 01:07:35.869]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:07:35.869 --> 01:07:42.015]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:07:42.615 --> 01:07:46.518]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:07:46.518 --> 01:07:53.944]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:07:53.944 --> 01:07:54.404]  Thank you!
[01:08:05.455 --> 01:08:10.302]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.302 --> 01:08:11.884]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.884 --> 01:08:13.426]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.426 --> 01:08:17.633]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.633 --> 01:08:21.698]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.105 --> 01:08:29.189]  Alright, for one segment we're going to look at economic news and coming back straight to your phone calls.
[01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:38.576]  Then Aaron Dice is in studio with an investigation on the weather and tectonic weapon that they admit they have via the HAARP system in the last 30 minutes of the next hour.
[01:08:41.878 --> 01:08:45.540]  Oil is up to $105 a barrel right now and climbing.
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.641]  They're blaming it on Libya.
[01:08:47.641 --> 01:08:49.542]  That obviously is not helping the economy.
[01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:53.704]  Food prices worldwide are at the highest increase that we've seen since 1974.
[01:08:55.990 --> 01:09:13.123]  The year that I was born, and that's fueling a lot of this insurrection worldwide that the globalists then piggyback on because in many of these third world countries, half or more of the income that people get in many areas like Egypt, the general population makes $2 or less a day.
[01:09:13.123 --> 01:09:16.445]  It is basically causing them to starve.
[01:09:16.445 --> 01:09:24.531]  Now remember, in the last month, we've seen the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times of London, we've seen
[01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:30.513]  Time Magazine, Newsweek, all say the end of the dollar is nigh.
[01:09:30.513 --> 01:09:31.514]  The end of the dollar.
[01:09:31.514 --> 01:09:35.097]  Well, when we lose the dollar, we lose everything.
[01:09:35.097 --> 01:09:41.182]  That's all we had left to buy all these cheap goods for our service economy.
[01:09:41.182 --> 01:09:49.108]  And if the dollar is devalued further, which their signaling is going to happen and is decoupled and phased out of the world reserve currency,
[01:09:50.902 --> 01:10:01.991]  Then we are going to have massive increases in the cost of living in a country already sliding into depression by every yardstick, by every major economist we interview.
[01:10:01.991 --> 01:10:08.937]  But here's CNBC.com last night, US approaching insolvency fixed to be painful.
[01:10:08.937 --> 01:10:13.240]  And this is coming from the very people that have engineered this now posing as our saviors.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:18.744]  The United States is on a fiscal path towards insolvency and policymakers are at a tipping point.
[01:10:19.745 --> 01:10:26.469]  Fellow Reserve officials said last night, if we continue down the path of which the fiscal authorities put us, we will become insolvent.
[01:10:26.469 --> 01:10:27.390]  The question is when?
[01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:34.674]  Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said in a question and answer after delivering a speech at the University of Frankfurt.
[01:10:34.674 --> 01:10:37.796]  The short-term negotiations are very important.
[01:10:37.796 --> 01:10:39.577]  I look at this as a tipping point.
[01:10:40.455 --> 01:10:49.601]  And the negotiations are cutting Social Security, cutting the chicken feed that got us addicted to government and paying more and more of the GDP to the bankers.
[01:10:49.601 --> 01:10:57.727]  So cutting overall spending for the general public and pushing that spending towards the bankers.
[01:10:57.727 --> 01:11:00.069]  We are all mindful of this phenomenon.
[01:11:00.069 --> 01:11:04.352]  Speaking personally, I'm concerned that we are going to be extremely vigilant on that front.
[01:11:04.352 --> 01:11:05.813]  Fisher said in an interview.
[01:11:06.809 --> 01:11:11.691]  I think the beginning of the process, and it's going to be very painful, that's called austerity.
[01:11:11.691 --> 01:11:27.016]  I wanted to bring up Steve Shank, who for more than 30 years has been the leader in high quality storable foods grown right here in the United States, because he is running a special for just a few weeks more, he can tell us the exact dates, for free shipping on all of their high quality storable foods.
[01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:30.558]  But I've also got him here, that's one of the biggest costs in storable foods is the shipping.
[01:11:31.479 --> 01:11:31.719]  I think?
[01:11:39.051 --> 01:11:47.200]  And try to make up for it by ramping up production in the free market using supply and demand to try to get ahead of this.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.322]  But it's really getting bad.
[01:11:49.322 --> 01:11:52.506]  Now they're not denying that food prices are exploding everywhere.
[01:11:52.506 --> 01:11:59.473]  And as the dollar accelerates its devaluation, you're only gonna see not just food, but every other commodity like oil go up and up and up.
[01:11:59.473 --> 01:12:00.795]  Steve Schenck, good to have you here with us.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:21.107]  Hey, good to be with you, Alex, and what you were commenting about with the oil, we've been running statistics for the last five years, and as the oil prices go up, there's an exact, when you graph food prices and oil prices, you might as well be looking at the same lines on the graph.
[01:12:23.471 --> 01:12:44.798]  And what's happening is everything that you and I have talked about for the last three years, all of the predictions, we are literally in a perfect storm situation with regard to an economic failing and all roads, every single road on the economic scale leads to food.
[01:12:44.798 --> 01:12:50.240]  It's just, it's the determining factor in these third world countries that are falling right and left.
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:13:04.887]  And as the American dollar does what we've all known that it was in the process of doing, that is shooting food prices to the point where we have millions of American families already.
[01:13:04.887 --> 01:13:10.309]  Now, the news media talk about the third world people that can't afford food.
[01:13:10.309 --> 01:13:13.711]  We've got millions of American families that are in that situation.
[01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:25.335]  One of the things that we're dealing with, you know, in our conversations before, Alex, we've talked about the ethanol thing blowing.
[01:13:25.335 --> 01:13:34.419]  Now, ethanol, which was supposed to save our bacon with regard to fuel prices, is causing the fuel prices to go up.
[01:13:34.419 --> 01:13:41.282]  And by the way, Steve, four years ago on our broadcast, you predicted the ethanol situation, the oils.
[01:13:41.282 --> 01:13:43.523]  I mean, you really knew what you were talking about.
[01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:47.951]  Well, it doesn't take brain surgery, Alex.
[01:13:47.951 --> 01:14:01.996]  We're sitting out there, we're having to buy raw materials way out a year ahead, and as we're doing that, we're looking at what's happening as these food prices are literally pricing Americans out of the
[01:14:02.096 --> 01:14:02.496]  A lot of
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:39.996]  Can't cover up what's going on and you talk about perfect storm, the wars, the oil prices, the food prices, and now we've got the new bubble that you predicted years ago of the big multinational brokerage firms racing into food bidding the price up.
[01:14:41.024 --> 01:14:45.829]  Now you mentioned the weather control, which is fascinating.
[01:14:45.829 --> 01:14:54.517]  All of the huge population countries, you've got India and China, they literally are in serious trouble.
[01:14:54.517 --> 01:15:00.443]  China is losing 60% of its wheat this year as a result of this continuing drought thing.
[01:15:01.562 --> 01:15:05.266]  Which means that they are literally farming America.
[01:15:05.266 --> 01:15:10.352]  Our leaders are refusing, refusing to shut down exports.
[01:15:10.352 --> 01:15:14.097]  Every other country that's short on food is shutting down exports.
[01:15:14.097 --> 01:15:16.460]  We're allowing our commodities traders
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.220]  I think so.
[01:15:40.795 --> 01:15:42.876]  You mentioned the perfect storm.
[01:15:42.876 --> 01:15:56.203]  Every single circumstance that's out there that can affect shortages of food and boosting the price of food is in play right now, including other countries buying the food out from under us.
[01:15:56.203 --> 01:16:00.485]  This Japanese tragedy is just another shockwave
[01:16:01.065 --> 01:16:04.468]  Well, Russia this year suspended all foreign shipments of grain because they had all those fires.
[01:16:20.934 --> 01:16:22.296]  Absolutely.
[01:16:22.296 --> 01:16:23.217]  Absolutely.
[01:16:23.217 --> 01:16:35.169]  And the thing is, China is in a situation where they are the country that tries to control weather more than any other country in the world, and they can't get it to rain or snow anyplace where they're growing their food.
[01:16:35.169 --> 01:16:39.033]  They're in deep, deep trouble, and that puts us in deep trouble.
[01:16:39.033 --> 01:16:40.635]  So basically, what we've got
[01:16:41.435 --> 01:16:57.959]  Is a situation where the only choice that families have right now based on what you and I have talked about is to to freeze the cost and the availability of food by putting in their supplies while they can still afford them and while there's still food to buy.
[01:16:57.959 --> 01:17:00.040]  That's exactly what we're dealing with.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.940]  This isn't, this is not doom and gloom.
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.181]  This is fact.
[01:17:04.181 --> 01:17:06.561]  This is what we're dealing with right now.
[01:17:06.561 --> 01:17:08.722]  I've got our buyers out there
[01:17:09.262 --> 01:17:23.693]  Way ahead of us, a year ahead out there contracting for food, and believe me, commodities buyers are out there competing with us right now for American food to feed American people, many of which are starving right now.
[01:17:24.053 --> 01:17:24.633]  Explain that.
[01:17:46.109 --> 01:17:48.130]  And I bought a lot of storable food from other companies.
[01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:50.571]  It was terrible, MSG, fillers.
[01:17:50.571 --> 01:17:52.952]  I finally found you guys years ago.
[01:17:52.952 --> 01:17:56.833]  It's super high quality, and so I approached you about being a sponsor.
[01:17:56.833 --> 01:17:58.874]  People need to take advantage of this deal.
[01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:00.995]  How long are you running this free shipping?
[01:18:00.995 --> 01:18:07.097]  Because for folks that don't know, this food weighs a lot, and so that's a huge part of the cost that you're knocking off here.
[01:18:08.385 --> 01:18:12.246]  Well, we're running it through the 31st of this month.
[01:18:12.246 --> 01:18:14.226]  So we've got just a few days.
[01:18:14.226 --> 01:18:16.526]  We've got seven or eight days.
[01:18:16.526 --> 01:18:18.567]  But if folks will get their orders in.
[01:18:18.567 --> 01:18:27.108]  Now, one of the things that we have is we've got a lot of folks realizing that they have no choice but to try and freeze the cost and the availability of the food.
[01:18:27.108 --> 01:18:28.349]  So they're ordering.
[01:18:28.349 --> 01:18:32.209]  So we're telling folks, give us four weeks on the shipping.
[01:18:32.209 --> 01:18:33.229]  That's fine.
[01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:34.510]  We'll handle it.
[01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:36.030]  Because you're not selling them all food!
[01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:39.392]  I mean, you're preparing fresh food right now.
[01:18:39.392 --> 01:18:41.033]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:18:41.033 --> 01:18:45.436]  The food is prepared after we receive the order, just because we're moving so fast.
[01:18:45.436 --> 01:18:50.639]  But we've always done that, because one of the things with storable food, you don't want any stuff that's old.
[01:18:50.639 --> 01:18:52.000]  You want the full shelf life.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.404]  And I want to warn people, there's other good companies out there, but there are a lot of them selling 10, 15-year-old garbage.
[01:18:58.464 --> 01:18:59.584]  Yep, that's true.
[01:18:59.584 --> 01:19:05.906]  And the problem is that to the average person, one piece of dried food looks like another piece of dried food and they don't know the difference.
[01:19:05.906 --> 01:19:06.786]  But we sure do.
[01:19:06.786 --> 01:19:08.407]  And that's one of the key things.
[01:19:08.407 --> 01:19:15.329]  People have to have good quality food because right now, the decisions that people are making, their life depends on it.
[01:19:15.769 --> 01:19:22.734]  This is the first time in the history of mankind that we've had a worldwide situation that this is as serious as this is.
[01:19:22.734 --> 01:19:27.277]  By the way, if anybody doubts it, they can just Google record global food shortage.
[01:19:27.277 --> 01:19:29.298]  They're predicting even more riots due to this.
[01:19:29.298 --> 01:19:31.580]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:38.264]  eFoodsDirect.com, the letter eFoodsDirect.com, banners on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:19:38.264 --> 01:19:40.226]  Steve, give folks the toll-free number.
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:44.901]  800-409-5633.
[01:19:44.901 --> 01:19:49.322]  That's 800-409-5633.
[01:19:49.322 --> 01:19:58.604]  And if you get the calls in and you get on the internet, we're going to run this free shipping through the 31st of this month.
[01:19:58.604 --> 01:19:59.225]  All right, Steve.
[01:19:59.225 --> 01:20:00.745]  I'm going to get that number out again when we come back.
[01:20:00.745 --> 01:20:07.567]  Dr. David Barry has provided excellent advice for all those interested in practical economics and sound money.
[01:20:07.567 --> 01:20:08.847]  It's certainly worth reading.
[01:20:09.167 --> 01:20:17.251]  That's what Congressman Ron Paul said about Cha-Ching Wisdom, 123 Practical Universal Truths About Money, the new book by Dr. David Barry.
[01:20:17.251 --> 01:20:26.235]  The cool part of this book, certainly it'll speak to you personally, your life, your lifestyle, your money, your investments, but it also can be generalized into the nation, what's going on as a nation.
[01:20:26.235 --> 01:20:29.036]  We do these same things personally that we do as a nation.
[01:20:29.036 --> 01:20:38.660]  Dr. Barry's book, Cha-Ching Wisdom, presents many facets of your relationship with the once almighty dollar and how current national and international politics affect your daily life.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.540]  Some of the other things are about that.
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:42.141]  They're not just economic.
[01:20:42.141 --> 01:20:43.181]  They're philosophical.
[01:20:43.181 --> 01:20:44.862]  There's psychology involved in this book.
[01:20:44.862 --> 01:20:46.522]  There's philosophy involved in this book.
[01:20:46.522 --> 01:20:48.963]  Read Cha-Ching Wisdom by Dr. David Barry.
[01:20:48.963 --> 01:20:50.283]  Only $9.95.
[01:20:50.283 --> 01:20:52.603]  Available at cha-chingwisdom.com.
[01:20:52.603 --> 01:20:56.965]  That's C-H-A-C-H-I-N-G-WISDOM.COM.
[01:20:56.965 --> 01:20:58.565]  cha-chingwisdom.com
[01:21:00.529 --> 01:21:02.912]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:21:02.912 --> 01:21:05.214]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:05.214 --> 01:21:08.437]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:08.437 --> 01:21:13.542]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:13.542 --> 01:21:17.727]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:18.047 --> 01:21:20.389]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:20.389 --> 01:21:23.271]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:21:23.271 --> 01:21:26.173]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:33.779]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:34.116 --> 01:21:39.498]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:39.498 --> 01:21:42.358]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:42.358 --> 01:21:46.039]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:46.039 --> 01:21:47.120]  And I got news for you.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.440]  You're everyone else.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.941]  Invisible Empire.

[01:21:59.577 --> 01:22:02.360]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.402]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[01:22:04.402 --> 01:22:05.303]  debt crises.
[01:22:05.303 --> 01:22:06.344]  You heard me right.
[01:22:06.344 --> 01:22:08.807]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[01:22:08.807 --> 01:22:12.471]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[01:22:12.471 --> 01:22:19.339]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[01:22:19.839 --> 01:22:21.100]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:28.283]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[01:22:28.283 --> 01:22:36.127]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster.
[01:22:36.127 --> 01:22:40.068]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[01:22:40.068 --> 01:22:42.329]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[01:22:45.951 --> 01:22:52.244]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[01:22:52.244 --> 01:22:54.688]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[01:22:54.688 --> 01:22:54.969]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.662 --> 01:23:02.644]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you need MyPillow.
[01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.587]  Guaranteed to be the most comfortable pillow you will ever own.

[01:24:01.165 --> 01:24:09.192]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:09.192 --> 01:24:17.478]  The Japanese media and government is admitting that a neutron beam is being emitted from Fukushima No. 2.
[01:24:19.315 --> 01:24:24.283]  Only plutonium or uranium, that's the live reactor, can put that out.
[01:24:24.283 --> 01:24:27.307]  So we're gonna be breaking that down after I take some more phone calls.
[01:24:27.307 --> 01:24:33.156]  They are reporting 1,600 times safe levels of radiation as far away as 20 kilometers.
[01:24:34.292 --> 01:24:36.695]  from the reactor.
[01:24:36.695 --> 01:24:39.878]  By the way, Steve got cut off there by the break.
[01:24:39.878 --> 01:24:47.126]  If you want to call efoodsdirect.com and ask any questions, we're going to color brochure 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com if you missed that.
[01:24:53.072 --> 01:24:54.613]  Okay, I promise to go to your calls.
[01:24:54.613 --> 01:24:56.755]  This is a short segment, but I'm going to bang through these.
[01:24:56.755 --> 01:24:57.555]  I love hearing from you.
[01:24:57.555 --> 01:24:59.416]  I'm sorry we haven't gotten to a lot of you yet.
[01:24:59.416 --> 01:25:02.598]  Jamie, Kevin, Scott, William, Pam, we're going to get to all of you.
[01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:04.259]  Jamie in Washington, you're on the air.
[01:25:04.259 --> 01:25:04.820]  Thanks for holding.
[01:25:05.811 --> 01:25:07.432]  Hi Alex.
[01:25:07.432 --> 01:25:18.399]  Fukushima has changed so many facets to our lives and our world and it ties into Libya, it ties into what Steve Shank was saying about the perfect storm.
[01:25:18.399 --> 01:25:23.703]  One of the layers of the danger is just how it's changed our daily lives.
[01:25:23.703 --> 01:25:31.768]  People now accept low-level radiation as normal and the implications of that are so serious in that
[01:25:32.675 --> 01:25:42.226]  Um, my fear is that, well, in never letting a good nuclear crisis go to waste, um, I can see this playing out to people I think
[01:25:42.958 --> 01:25:50.601]  Post-Fukushima, if somebody was to drop a nuke on somebody else, our perception about how that would affect our lives is different now.
[01:25:50.601 --> 01:25:51.802]  Very well said, Jamie.
[01:25:51.802 --> 01:26:11.670]  You know, the Pentagon six years ago changed its policy and said that they're now preparing to use, quote, small nukes on countries as tactical weapons preemptively, including plans to drop over a hundred low-yield bunker busters on Iran's mountain facilities and government facilities that are hardened
[01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:14.252]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[01:26:14.252 --> 01:26:18.295]  Pre-91, they wouldn't let the troops use depleted uranium munitions.
[01:26:18.295 --> 01:26:21.958]  Then they waved a magic wand and said, good for you.
[01:26:21.958 --> 01:26:23.419]  And it's the same thing here now.
[01:26:23.419 --> 01:26:25.961]  They are actually saying that.
[01:26:25.961 --> 01:26:27.462]  I mean, does your gut tell you that?
[01:26:27.462 --> 01:26:29.904]  Or were you already aware that you are correct?
[01:26:29.904 --> 01:26:32.106]  They're actually planning this.
[01:26:32.106 --> 01:26:35.349]  Well, it's actually 10 months ago, I watched the Obama deception.
[01:26:35.349 --> 01:26:37.931]  I set out on a mission to prove you wrong.
[01:26:37.931 --> 01:26:40.273]  And so now I'm a daily listener.
[01:26:40.273 --> 01:26:41.634]  My gut tells me that.
[01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:45.399]  It's all part of acceptance.
[01:26:45.399 --> 01:26:50.223]  You know, like you've talked about many times before, you accept a little bit into your lives and they give you more and more.
[01:26:50.223 --> 01:26:59.551]  My gut tells me that, you know, two weeks ago, people, if you would have dropped a nuke on somebody, you'd have people, you know, take a caffeine iodine.
[01:26:59.551 --> 01:27:02.113]  You'd have them trying to stock up on food as quickly as possible.
[01:27:02.113 --> 01:27:04.395]  You'd have them trying to find shelters.
[01:27:04.395 --> 01:27:07.778]  And now, people just don't seem to care about radiation.
[01:27:08.692 --> 01:27:20.757]  So people aren't going to be, if you drop a nuke, they're not going to prepare their lives and not try and, you know, they've taken your natural instinct to protect yourselves and your young away from us by telling us it's normal.
[01:27:20.757 --> 01:27:26.319]  Well, they've taught people it's stylish and cool to be under austerity.
[01:27:26.319 --> 01:27:30.621]  That's all over the newsstand shelves for the trendies that being bankrupt is cool.
[01:27:30.621 --> 01:27:32.782]  Having nothing is fun.
[01:27:32.782 --> 01:27:34.623]  Radiation is probably good for you.
[01:27:34.623 --> 01:27:36.804]  It's not just Ann Coulter and Fox News saying it.
[01:27:37.524 --> 01:27:39.505]  It's fun to have your bank account stolen.
[01:27:39.505 --> 01:27:41.066]  It's fun to have wars.
[01:27:41.066 --> 01:27:42.886]  Torture is cool.
[01:27:42.886 --> 01:27:44.087]  Being a slave is fine.
[01:27:44.087 --> 01:27:48.608]  And they're basically selling us on uncommon sense.
[01:27:48.608 --> 01:27:51.169]  They're selling us on being chumps.
[01:27:51.169 --> 01:28:02.154]  So many yuppies I run into that know who I am but don't like the show, and it is the minority, but they come over and giggle and laugh and they think it's real funny to be informed.
[01:28:03.494 --> 01:28:07.935]  And they think being ignorant is like a shield of infallibility.
[01:28:07.935 --> 01:28:13.196]  They wear their willful ignorance like a medal on their chest.
[01:28:13.196 --> 01:28:15.377]  I mean, have you run into that?
[01:28:15.377 --> 01:28:18.798]  Oh yeah, it's now taboo to be worried about radiation.
[01:28:18.798 --> 01:28:23.219]  You say, you know, if you're right here in Washington State, you know, we've seen increased levels.
[01:28:23.219 --> 01:28:27.599]  And you mention that to somebody and they look at you like you're nuts, like you're a conspiracy theorist, you know?
[01:28:27.599 --> 01:28:29.580]  It's like, why would you worry about radiation?
[01:28:30.407 --> 01:28:37.389]  Well, they can see the radiation beams now coming out at night, shooting several miles out in different directions.
[01:28:37.389 --> 01:28:39.030]  It's now confirmed.
[01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:42.971]  Major Japanese TV reporting, don't worry about the neutron beams.
[01:28:42.971 --> 01:28:45.252]  At night, you can see the blue beams.
[01:28:45.252 --> 01:28:46.793]  They can even see it!
[01:28:46.793 --> 01:28:56.056]  It's like, nutritious, good, and I think Ann Coulter should go sit right in front of the beam, right at the opening of these blasted reactors, and then she ought to drink in it.
[01:28:56.556 --> 01:28:57.297]  Fountain of Youth?
[01:29:27.276 --> 01:29:28.357]  Drink the fluoride.
[01:29:28.357 --> 01:29:29.498]  Drink the uranium.
[01:29:29.498 --> 01:29:30.918]  Enjoy yourselves.
[01:29:30.918 --> 01:29:31.979]  Good to hear from you, Jamie.
[01:29:31.979 --> 01:29:34.820]  Kevin, Scott, William, Pam, and others.
[01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:36.521]  I was on Man Cal this morning.
[01:29:36.521 --> 01:29:38.402]  Big syndicated show.
[01:29:38.402 --> 01:29:40.163]  And I pointed out that it came out in Texas.
[01:29:40.163 --> 01:29:45.025]  The government covered up plutonium, excuse me, uranium in the water.
[01:29:45.025 --> 01:29:46.486]  And he just didn't even know what to say.
[01:29:46.486 --> 01:29:47.927]  I mean, I'm not making that up.
[01:29:47.927 --> 01:29:51.008]  I mean, they actually put it in the water here.
[01:29:51.008 --> 01:29:52.409]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.409 --> 01:29:53.930]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.927 --> 01:30:01.632]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.632 --> 01:30:17.122]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:30:17.122 --> 01:30:20.785]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:21.792 --> 01:30:34.564]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:30:34.564 --> 01:30:41.831]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:30:42.512 --> 01:30:52.895]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:30:52.895 --> 01:30:56.817]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:30:56.817 --> 01:30:59.918]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:31:00.498 --> 01:31:05.059]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:05.959]  Number one.
[01:31:05.959 --> 01:31:09.400]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:10.260]  Number two.
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:15.142]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.142 --> 01:31:15.882]  It's true.
[01:31:15.882 --> 01:31:20.763]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.763 --> 01:31:21.583]  Number three.
[01:31:21.583 --> 01:31:25.164]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.164 --> 01:31:28.865]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.085 --> 01:31:29.865]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.865 --> 01:31:32.626]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.626 --> 01:31:36.308]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.308 --> 01:31:37.108]  Number 5.
[01:31:37.108 --> 01:31:41.250]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:46.292]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.292 --> 01:31:50.473]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.473 --> 01:31:52.274]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:52.274 --> 01:31:56.876]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:32:00.298 --> 01:32:04.121]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:32:04.121 --> 01:32:08.423]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:32:08.423 --> 01:32:13.187]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:32:28.977 --> 01:32:36.003]  We're American and be proud.
[01:32:36.003 --> 01:32:38.705]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:32:54.801 --> 01:32:59.385]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:33:25.009 --> 01:33:27.491]  No more Mr. Nice Guy from the New World Order.
[01:33:27.491 --> 01:33:38.941]  We need to be nice to each other, but not too nice to the New World Order.
[01:33:38.941 --> 01:33:41.463]  We need to expose these rats for the criminals they are.
[01:33:43.406 --> 01:33:46.707]  Or the sky is the limit with these people.
[01:33:46.707 --> 01:33:50.908]  Now, I announced this at the start of the show, but I kind of forgot that he was coming on.
[01:33:50.908 --> 01:33:53.889]  It's such a special guest because he lives in Japan.
[01:33:53.889 --> 01:33:56.870]  He was out of the country before this happened.
[01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:58.210]  He's now back.
[01:33:58.210 --> 01:34:01.451]  James Corbett of the Corbett Report will be with us into the next hour.
[01:34:02.831 --> 01:34:04.512]  I promise to go to these callers.
[01:34:04.512 --> 01:34:11.914]  So he's gracious enough to hold via video Skype from Japan while we go to Val, Kevin, Scott, William and Pam.
[01:34:11.914 --> 01:34:13.715]  But I don't want to have him hold too long.
[01:34:13.715 --> 01:34:17.696]  I promised to go to calls and forgot James Corbett was coming up with the Corbett report.
[01:34:17.696 --> 01:34:20.877]  He'll be joining us here in a moment from Japan.
[01:34:20.877 --> 01:34:24.258]  But Val in Germany, who even tried to get in yesterday, I believe.
[01:34:24.258 --> 01:34:25.378]  Val, you're on the air.
[01:34:25.378 --> 01:34:26.159]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:34:26.159 --> 01:34:29.420]  Yes, hello.
[01:34:30.441 --> 01:34:32.103]  Yes, welcome.
[01:34:32.103 --> 01:34:34.725]  You're in the Air Force?
[01:34:34.725 --> 01:34:36.447]  Uh, yes.
[01:34:36.447 --> 01:34:38.710]  Probably shouldn't be saying that, but you know, it's cool.
[01:34:38.710 --> 01:34:40.311]  I only have a year left, so I'm getting out.
[01:34:40.311 --> 01:34:41.432]  Well, I just see it on the screen.
[01:34:41.432 --> 01:34:47.018]  I guess you told them yesterday when you tried to get in, but you got through today, or perhaps it was already up there from today.
[01:34:47.018 --> 01:34:49.441]  But regardless, what's on your mind?
[01:34:50.825 --> 01:34:55.428]  Well, I wanted to talk about a few things, but I'll try to make it quick.
[01:34:55.428 --> 01:35:03.012]  As far as what's going on in Fukushima and in Japan, I have some friends that are stationed out there, near Dakota.
[01:35:03.012 --> 01:35:12.997]  And they're telling me that the military, they're going door to door, finding Americans, bringing them onto the American base.
[01:35:14.201 --> 01:35:17.202]  Putting them on military planes and flying them back to the states.
[01:35:17.202 --> 01:35:18.963]  That's how dangerous the situation is out there.
[01:35:18.963 --> 01:35:28.466]  Well, that's confirmed by two days ago, CNN, where the military is considering forced evacuation of not just government but all Americans.
[01:35:28.466 --> 01:35:32.888]  You're saying you've confirmed that from your Air Force connections in Japan?
[01:35:34.304 --> 01:35:47.408]  Well, because of course, you know, they say that the Japanese, or, you know, the people who, they're saying it's not that dangerous, but of course, you said it on your show, it's been confirmed, and I'm reconfirming it, it, it, the situation is very dangerous.
[01:35:48.098 --> 01:35:55.421]  I'm going to continue to get updates of what's going on because of course I'm concerned for my friends, but the situation is very bad.
[01:35:55.421 --> 01:35:57.041]  It's in the food, it's in the water.
[01:35:57.041 --> 01:36:01.423]  But what you're telling us, Val, what you're telling us from Germany is a little more.
[01:36:01.423 --> 01:36:03.723]  They say they're considering forced evacuation.
[01:36:03.723 --> 01:36:05.924]  You're saying it's already going on.
[01:36:05.924 --> 01:36:07.925]  It's already going on.
[01:36:07.925 --> 01:36:08.705]  It's already going on.
[01:36:08.705 --> 01:36:16.208]  Not only that, in the area, I'm almost certain that a lot of the power is out, except for the bases.
[01:36:16.208 --> 01:36:17.488]  They refuse to turn off the power.
[01:36:21.399 --> 01:36:33.776]  Well that was in the news over the weekend that the Japanese had asked people not to use power and that they were doing rolling blackouts but you're saying the US bases have still got power?
[01:36:34.701 --> 01:36:35.181]  Yeah, the U.S.
[01:36:35.181 --> 01:36:36.582]  nation still has power.
[01:36:36.582 --> 01:36:38.242]  I mean, does this mean that finally the U.S.
[01:36:38.242 --> 01:36:39.943]  military is going to leave Japan?
[01:36:39.943 --> 01:36:45.945]  The Japanese government's begged for it for decades, but now that they may just be completely pulling out because of the radiation?
[01:36:45.945 --> 01:36:48.986]  I mean, that shows our military thinks it's uninhabitable.
[01:36:48.986 --> 01:36:51.907]  I mean, this radiation isn't going anywhere.
[01:36:51.907 --> 01:36:55.569]  I mean, this may be the catalyst for what they need to boot them out.
[01:36:55.569 --> 01:36:59.030]  Because, like you said, they're already tired of them being there.
[01:36:59.030 --> 01:37:02.051]  And it's gotten so bad, you know, the back and forth.
[01:37:02.051 --> 01:37:02.591]  Turn off the lights.
[01:37:02.591 --> 01:37:03.452]  No, we're not turning it off.
[01:37:03.452 --> 01:37:04.132]  Turn off the lights, son.
[01:37:04.708 --> 01:37:08.689]  Well Val, this is key information.
[01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:16.732]  So you're in the Air Force in Germany and you've talked to other people in Germany or folks you know in the Air Force in Japan that have told you this?
[01:37:16.732 --> 01:37:17.192]  So both?
[01:37:34.582 --> 01:37:35.483]  For sure.
[01:37:35.483 --> 01:37:40.807]  Have they said anything about a cover-up about the real levels of radiation?
[01:37:40.807 --> 01:37:47.894]  The real levels of radiation I have not heard about, but as the days go on and I speak to more friends, I find out different things.
[01:37:47.894 --> 01:37:58.643]  That is a question I'm going to have to ask, because things are moving so fast over there and friends, they're just ending up here in Germany because what's happening is
[01:37:59.164 --> 01:38:01.445]  This is like, Germany is like a big hub.
[01:38:01.445 --> 01:38:06.707]  So when people deploy or things like that, or they're coming back from deployment, they come here first.
[01:38:06.707 --> 01:38:13.991]  Absolutely, the biggest bases in Europe are there, and the big hospitals and the air bases and the rest of it, so a key area.
[01:38:13.991 --> 01:38:16.692]  Val, anything else you think is important that people should know?
[01:38:16.692 --> 01:38:23.875]  Well, the situation with Libya.
[01:38:23.875 --> 01:38:25.536]  What I'm afraid of is
[01:38:26.636 --> 01:38:29.458]  Not the airstrikes and things that are going on.
[01:38:29.458 --> 01:38:32.460]  I'm afraid of what will happen after that.
[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:34.862]  Because things already scattered.
[01:38:34.862 --> 01:38:38.124]  And the quote-unquote allies are not getting along.
[01:38:38.124 --> 01:38:39.425]  At all.
[01:38:39.425 --> 01:38:41.767]  Despite what they say in the news.
[01:38:41.767 --> 01:38:43.788]  They're not getting along at all.
[01:38:43.788 --> 01:38:48.672]  And, of course, everyone ultimately wants power over the oil, because this is just a big oil war.
[01:38:52.711 --> 01:38:54.372]  Well, I'm not going to go in depth about the president.
[01:38:54.372 --> 01:38:54.812]  Absolutely not.
[01:38:54.812 --> 01:38:56.252]  Not excited about the war at all.
[01:38:56.252 --> 01:38:56.832]  They think it's a fake.
[01:38:56.832 --> 01:38:57.593]  They think it's a phony.
[01:38:57.593 --> 01:38:58.793]  A lot of us are getting out.
[01:38:58.793 --> 01:39:00.253]  Because we don't want to be a part of it.
[01:39:15.636 --> 01:39:28.021]  Is any of the military, or any of the Air Force folks that you're there with, are they concerned about the President following UN orders and not consulting Congress?
[01:39:28.021 --> 01:39:31.322]  That hasn't been brought up, but I'm concerned about it.
[01:39:31.322 --> 01:39:38.104]  Because they do that because they slowly strip away at our rights.
[01:39:38.104 --> 01:39:42.326]  And the military, you know, we get even less rights than the citizens.
[01:39:43.231 --> 01:39:43.791]  All right.
[01:39:43.791 --> 01:39:45.473]  Well, Val, you're awesome.
[01:39:45.473 --> 01:39:46.753]  Stay in touch with us.
[01:39:46.753 --> 01:39:47.834]  Very important phone call.
[01:39:47.834 --> 01:39:53.218]  Now, listen, I said I'd go to calls quickly, but that one took about five, six minutes, and I've got our guests waiting in the wings.
[01:39:53.218 --> 01:39:57.901]  I promise that we will go to your phone calls before this hour ends.
[01:39:57.901 --> 01:39:59.422]  Kevin, Scott, William, and others.
[01:39:59.422 --> 01:40:04.505]  The first-time caller line is open 800-259-9231.
[01:40:04.505 --> 01:40:06.527]  Only first-time callers.
[01:40:06.527 --> 01:40:11.350]  And we'll take calls while James Corbett is our guest.
[01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:12.611]  He joins us from Japan.
[01:40:13.291 --> 01:40:20.937]  And we're also, towards the end of the show today, going to announce the video contest winners for the answer to 1984-1776.
[01:40:20.937 --> 01:40:25.000]  But James Corbett is an independent journalist, has been living and working in Japan since 2004.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.624]  He's been writing and producing the Corbett Report that people really have found to be extremely informative.
[01:40:32.505 --> 01:40:37.548]  Incisive, an online multimedia news information source.
[01:40:37.548 --> 01:40:43.170]  His forthcoming book, Reportage, Essays on the New World Order, will be available very soon.
[01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:47.312]  CorbettReport.com is his website.
[01:40:47.312 --> 01:40:51.654]  He's also got another announcement of why he wasn't in Japan that he's going to make on air.
[01:40:51.654 --> 01:40:57.277]  We appreciate him being a tough guy with a stiff upper lip, chin up, joining us and everybody should pray
[01:40:58.037 --> 01:41:11.011]  For James Corbett and his family James first because you said you wanted to make the announcement Why you weren't in Japan when this happened joining us via video Skype back in Japan you got back yesterday And then let's get into what you're seeing on the ground there
[01:41:12.236 --> 01:41:33.282]  Right, well, as I told my listeners just before I went on my little hiatus, unfortunately I was dealing with the loss of my mother, and I was going back to Canada for her funeral, and incredibly enough, it was just the day after the earthquake that I actually left Japan to go back to Canada, and I spent over a week there, and I've just gotten back to Japan.
[01:41:34.322 --> 01:41:40.187]  During that time, I obviously wasn't following the news very carefully, so you were covering things.
[01:41:40.187 --> 01:41:42.068]  I've been catching up over the last couple of days.
[01:41:42.068 --> 01:41:55.699]  You were covering things excellently and are probably better informed about this than I am, but I've gotten back and I'm scrambling to catch up, and so now I'm back and I'm working on the Corbett Report again and conducting interviews and writing articles.
[01:41:55.699 --> 01:41:57.441]  Well, we're sorry for your loss.
[01:41:57.441 --> 01:42:00.483]  Now, James, you were there for the earthquake.
[01:42:00.483 --> 01:42:02.425]  Tell us where you are located in Japan.
[01:42:03.473 --> 01:42:15.580]  So I am on the western side of the main island of Honshu and it's about, I would say, 700 kilometres, that's about 400 miles for my American friends, southwest of Fukushima.
[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:20.844]  So it's quite a ways away and obviously out here we didn't feel a thing.
[01:42:20.844 --> 01:42:24.766]  The first I ever heard of the earthquake was when I was online, you know, looking at news.
[01:42:24.766 --> 01:42:31.310]  So I didn't feel a thing, there was no tsunami here, it was just the images coming in and I was watching them like everybody else.
[01:42:31.950 --> 01:42:40.218]  And at the time, of course, I was just preparing to go back to Canada, so I wasn't thinking about the effects of the tsunami or the lasting effects, but obviously we're seeing that now.
[01:42:40.218 --> 01:42:43.481]  But as you may know, I'm an English teacher here in Japan.
[01:42:43.481 --> 01:42:54.651]  I teach at elementary schools and junior high schools, and today was the elementary school graduation ceremony because the school year ends here in March rather than in July, like back home.
[01:42:55.331 --> 01:43:16.506]  So people were having the graduation ceremony and I was there watching it and we had a moment of silence at the beginning of it for the the victims of the earthquake and the tsunami and it was it was pretty powerful during that moment of silence I was thinking about an image that I saw in the newspaper this morning and I'll hold it up for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers out there
[01:43:17.146 --> 01:43:18.788]  For radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[01:43:18.788 --> 01:43:25.076]  It's basically someone kneeling in front of a twisted wreck of metal and it just remains.
[01:43:25.076 --> 01:43:31.204]  And this is actually a bus that was transporting kindergarten children who were
[01:43:32.445 --> 01:43:40.512]  They were being transported away during the earthquake and they were trying to get to high ground and the tsunami came and it took over the bus.
[01:43:40.512 --> 01:43:41.693]  It flipped it around.
[01:43:41.693 --> 01:43:57.848]  It landed on its side in a pool of gasoline that was leaking from a gas station and the gasoline ignited and those children end up as charred cinders and these types of stories are coming out absolutely every single day and we're just seeing more and more
[01:43:58.608 --> 01:44:02.831]  Horrific scenes from the devastation that took place.
[01:44:02.831 --> 01:44:05.453]  Over 24,000 now dead and missing.
[01:44:05.453 --> 01:44:10.057]  So just indescribable scenes coming out of that part of Japan.
[01:44:10.057 --> 01:44:15.781]  And obviously I'm not there, but obviously everyone's thoughts and prayers are with those people right now.
[01:44:16.361 --> 01:44:28.746]  Including myself, and now as we speak, of course, the black smoke is bulging out of reactors 2 and 3 with their deadly payload of iodine-131 and cesium-234 and cesium-237.
[01:44:28.746 --> 01:44:36.930]  And as you just mentioned, reactor 2 is now spurting out neutron beams, so it's a horrific situation and it's only getting worse.
[01:44:37.110 --> 01:44:45.697]  What do you think of Ann Coulter writing articles and going on TV with a straight face and saying this is actually going to keep us all from getting cancer and it's nutritious?
[01:44:45.697 --> 01:44:53.684]  We have called her booking agent and said, we're going to pay the fee, which is a lot of money and the airline tickets, everything.
[01:44:53.684 --> 01:44:55.966]  And they get very angry with us.
[01:44:55.966 --> 01:45:00.991]  I mean, I demand she go to Fukushima and if it's so good and drink water out of that reactor.
[01:45:02.768 --> 01:45:24.714]  There is just no accounting for that ghoul and the despicable comments that she's making and I really hope that a year or two from now when there are little children dying of leukemia out there, I really hope that she looks in the mirror and realizes that she has sold her soul to go and just pimp these ideas for these corporations to which she's enslaved to.
[01:45:24.714 --> 01:45:30.435]  It's just despicable and it's unthinkable and I'm glad at least that no one's listening
[01:45:31.496 --> 01:45:34.878]  Well, it's insane.
[01:45:34.878 --> 01:45:38.881]  I mean, I wonder if she actually believes it, because it is insane.
[01:45:38.881 --> 01:45:40.141]  It's unthinkable.
[01:45:40.141 --> 01:45:42.843]  I mean, she talked about the people in Japan.
[01:45:42.843 --> 01:45:43.884]  She said it's good for them.
[01:45:45.635 --> 01:45:47.315]  Well, I hope she'll come.
[01:45:47.315 --> 01:45:54.617]  I hope she'll come and I'll be here to welcome her and lead her to the site so she can go and experience it for herself.
[01:45:54.617 --> 01:45:55.818]  Well, I don't want you to do that.
[01:45:55.818 --> 01:45:57.098]  We know it's deadly.
[01:45:57.098 --> 01:46:05.060]  And as the plant head said last Friday, breaking down and crying, saying he couldn't cover up anymore, he said this is lethal, this is going to kill people.
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:09.963]  And we have gotten reports of people in and around the area with red faces vomiting.
[01:46:09.963 --> 01:46:13.386]  But the Japanese are so stoic, a lot of them are still following orders.
[01:46:13.386 --> 01:46:18.910]  Bloomberg reports Fukushima engineer says he helped cover up flaw at Daiichi No.
[01:46:18.910 --> 01:46:19.591]  Reactor 4.
[01:46:19.591 --> 01:46:21.072]  That's Bloomberg.
[01:46:21.072 --> 01:46:22.353]  That came out last night.
[01:46:22.353 --> 01:46:32.341]  One of the reactors at the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant may have been relying on flawed steel to hold the radiation in its core, according to an engineer who helped build its containment vessel four decades ago.
[01:46:33.161 --> 01:46:35.786]  And I don't want to pronounce his name wrong, but it's...
[01:46:38.715 --> 01:46:40.716]  The article's up there on Bloomberg.
[01:46:40.716 --> 01:46:43.899]  You've lived in Japan now for eight, nine years, so you could probably pronounce it.
[01:46:43.899 --> 01:46:49.042]  But dealing with this, are the Japanese people buying into the propaganda?
[01:46:49.042 --> 01:46:50.744]  Because first they said, no problem.
[01:46:50.744 --> 01:46:59.550]  Now they admit 1,600 times safe levels of radiation up to 20 kilometers away, most of it going out to sea towards the US.
[01:46:59.550 --> 01:47:01.872]  Iceland reporting they picked up radiation yesterday.
[01:47:01.872 --> 01:47:04.554]  It's already gone over North America towards Europe.
[01:47:05.415 --> 01:47:08.060]  I mean, what are the Japanese saying and doing here?
[01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:10.043]  Does it concern them that the U.S.
[01:47:10.043 --> 01:47:14.912]  military is talking about forced evacuations of Americans because it's so radioactive?
[01:47:16.502 --> 01:47:43.411]  Well, I mean, the sense here is that I think the Japanese people are smarter than that, and they know not to trust the government and TEPCO and things like these, because of course we've seen all sorts of nuclear disasters here, from the Tokaimura incident in 1999, which again was the Tokyo Electric Power Company, and they lied over and over and over again about the extent of that disaster, and people know that it is a cover-up.
[01:47:44.351 --> 01:47:54.936]  Again, it's difficult to understand unless you've been here and know the culture, but the people here are just not the type that are going to rise up and revolt anytime soon.
[01:47:54.936 --> 01:47:59.098]  And in some ways that's a blessing, in some ways it's a curse.
[01:47:59.098 --> 01:48:01.159]  Yeah, because what good would it do now?
[01:48:01.159 --> 01:48:09.763]  I mean, I just think the executives that stored 600,000 plus fuel rods on top of reactors, they need to do what China does.
[01:48:09.763 --> 01:48:10.803]  They need to have trials.
[01:48:10.803 --> 01:48:12.684]  I know Japan, does Japan have the death penalty?
[01:48:13.294 --> 01:48:15.695]  Yes, it does.
[01:48:15.695 --> 01:48:18.776]  It's lethal injection, correct?
[01:48:18.776 --> 01:48:20.236]  I believe so, yeah.
[01:48:20.236 --> 01:48:28.019]  Well, I mean, I think there needs to be some people getting executed over this, and then next time in America, in Europe, in Japan, these executives will think twice.
[01:48:28.019 --> 01:48:29.200]  I mean, they should be executed.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:34.882]  I'm going to say it right now, when their own engineers are coming out and saying there were cover-ups in safety, execute them!
[01:48:34.882 --> 01:48:35.522]  It's that simple!
[01:48:36.584 --> 01:49:01.517]  Well I tell you what, Japan has a big, long history of leaders committing suicide when they've messed up in a big way, and this is a case where they've messed up in a big way, so who knows what will happen, but at any rate, the idea that the TEPCO and the government has been covering up what's going on and has not been releasing information and is trying to downplay this incident is despicable, and if the
[01:49:02.057 --> 01:49:11.543]  Puppet, commonly known as President Obama, or more accurately his string pullers, were at all serious about the idea of military-backed human intervention.
[01:49:11.543 --> 01:49:14.725]  They would have been out here deploying U.S.
[01:49:14.725 --> 01:49:19.668]  military assets to do the sarcophagus option and dropping cement on that site.
[01:49:19.668 --> 01:49:30.815]  You had an excellent article up yesterday from Hiroshi Takashi at Infowars.com, what they're covering up at Fukushima that everybody needs to go and read because he's shooting from the hip.
[01:49:31.295 --> 01:49:46.972]  And he is a nuclear expert who is basically saying that they're just ludicrous trying to downplay this and the only real option left is to bury that place in cement and give up because the idea that they're ever going to get these reactors going again is ludicrous.
[01:49:46.972 --> 01:49:52.397]  Well, they continue to explode, they continue to smoke, they continue to belch out intensifying levels.
[01:49:53.118 --> 01:49:55.559]  Of radiation and more and more here in the U.S.
[01:49:55.559 --> 01:50:04.583]  the NCAA March Madness and things and the Libya thing is starting to eclipse this with our media telling us that radiation is not a problem.
[01:50:04.583 --> 01:50:10.065]  The problem is even when it comes in in low levels it comes in over and over again as the weeks draw on.
[01:50:10.065 --> 01:50:12.546]  It's the cumulative same thing in Japan.
[01:50:12.546 --> 01:50:14.286]  First it was 25 times, then 100 times, then 200, then 400.
[01:50:14.286 --> 01:50:14.767]  Now it's 1600 times.
[01:50:18.408 --> 01:50:23.817]  In these areas, because it continues to fall on the ground and build up, that's the cumulative effect.
[01:50:23.817 --> 01:50:26.220]  That's what's so dangerous about a meltdown.
[01:50:27.509 --> 01:50:28.790]  That's exactly right.
[01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:39.016]  It's not even the plume itself, which, I hate to say this, but luckily for me, where I am, it's heading east, which is horrible for everyone in North America, obviously.
[01:50:39.016 --> 01:50:42.919]  But it's not even the plume itself, it's just the fallout that's coming out around that plant.
[01:50:42.919 --> 01:50:48.843]  It's going to be in the soil for thousands of years, as we know, well, billions, really, the half-life of some of these elements.
[01:50:49.883 --> 01:51:02.386]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.386 --> 01:51:07.987]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.987 --> 01:51:13.009]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.009 --> 01:51:16.309]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:51:16.309 --> 01:51:18.050]  And it's possible that it could even happen again.
[01:51:18.590 --> 01:51:23.811]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.811 --> 01:51:30.913]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.913 --> 01:51:32.033]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.033 --> 01:51:38.395]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.715 --> 01:51:41.916]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.916 --> 01:51:44.137]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.137 --> 01:51:45.077]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.077 --> 01:51:45.477]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.477 --> 01:51:48.718]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.718 --> 01:51:50.438]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.882 --> 01:52:04.303]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[01:52:04.303 --> 01:52:12.146]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[01:52:12.146 --> 01:52:16.688]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[01:52:16.688 --> 01:52:18.149]  It is glutathione.
[01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:22.210]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[01:52:22.210 --> 01:52:25.572]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[01:52:26.192 --> 01:52:31.974]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[01:52:31.974 --> 01:52:39.237]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[01:52:39.237 --> 01:52:45.660]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:47.701]  One World Whey comes in three delicious flavors.
[01:52:48.061 --> 01:52:48.482]  Call 888-988-3325.

[01:54:16.902 --> 01:54:19.083]  First-time callers that are patiently holding.
[01:54:19.083 --> 01:54:22.065]  James Corbett will be with us 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:54:22.065 --> 01:54:25.646]  We got Aaron Dykes joining us as well on harp.
[01:54:25.646 --> 01:54:29.408]  I want to announce the Answer 1984-1776 winners.
[01:54:29.408 --> 01:54:33.370]  I'll do that today, but I'm going to play some of them tomorrow and spend more time on it.
[01:54:33.370 --> 01:54:34.590]  Biggest response ever.
[01:54:34.590 --> 01:54:37.132]  Over 1,500 videos we've counted up that were sent in.
[01:54:38.092 --> 01:54:41.134]  All of you are huge winners in the fight against the globalist.
[01:54:41.134 --> 01:55:01.805]  We first announced that we were going to do this when the TSA announced cash prizes for TSA Fairmongering videos in Walmart and in a total 9,000 locations, not just Walmarts, 846 Walmarts and 8,000 plus other facilities, Mall of America, Big Jumbotrons for videos produced by citizens.
[01:55:01.805 --> 01:55:02.685]  We've seen a lot of them.
[01:55:02.685 --> 01:55:03.706]  There's sniveling,
[01:55:04.306 --> 01:55:07.908]  Boot-licking, sycophantic, fear-mongering police state videos.
[01:55:07.908 --> 01:55:09.749]  We have absolutely dominated them.
[01:55:09.749 --> 01:55:14.932]  1,500 videos, some of them with 50,000, 100,000 views, totaled together.
[01:55:14.932 --> 01:55:17.474]  No way it's not a million or more views.
[01:55:17.474 --> 01:55:20.375]  Devastating attack on the globalists and the info war.
[01:55:20.375 --> 01:55:22.577]  Every permutation you can imagine of resistance.
[01:55:22.577 --> 01:55:24.278]  Very exciting.
[01:55:24.278 --> 01:55:27.920]  It was very hard to pick the winners, but we'll be doing that at the very end of the transmission today.
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.802]  I want to go to calls, but we're going to do that when we come back.
[01:55:32.182 --> 01:55:36.125]  At the start of the next hour in T-minus five minutes with Kevin, Scott, William and others.
[01:55:36.125 --> 01:55:38.827]  But other points, you know, because I'm asking some questions here.
[01:55:38.827 --> 01:55:40.268]  What do you want to talk?
[01:55:40.268 --> 01:55:43.850]  What's on your mind dealing with the devastation?
[01:55:43.850 --> 01:55:50.635]  I mean, obviously, these executives, government people that push this, they should all commit seppuku or be executed.
[01:55:50.635 --> 01:55:52.536]  I'm not a person that would ever commit suicide.
[01:55:52.536 --> 01:55:53.257]  I love life.
[01:55:53.257 --> 01:55:58.761]  But if I was one of these reactor people that had lied and done this, I don't know how I could live with myself.
[01:55:59.461 --> 01:56:02.303]  I mean, and I'm not here just calling for retribution.
[01:56:02.303 --> 01:56:07.626]  They need to be punished so that other executives around the world realize they're not going to get away with this stuff.
[01:56:08.954 --> 01:56:19.202]  Absolutely, there is a precedent being set here and let's hope it's not a precedent that these companies will get away with this with impunity as people start dropping like flies from this deadly radiation.
[01:56:19.202 --> 01:56:32.552]  But one thing that I want to ask is that I'm not here claiming to be an expert on what's going on or saying that I have all the answers, but I want to be an information resource for people, especially English speakers in Japan, to try to get information about what's going on.
[01:56:33.152 --> 01:56:45.435]  So, I have put up an article today, resources related to the Fukushima nuclear crisis, that has some online resources, some radiation monitoring levels and things that people can use if they're here in Japan.
[01:56:45.435 --> 01:56:54.117]  Also, some other details like the Xenon-133 plume spread that you posted on Prison Planet the other day.
[01:56:54.577 --> 01:56:55.858]  I've got that up there too.
[01:56:55.858 --> 01:57:01.640]  I want more resources, more online things that people can use to check radiation levels and things like that.
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:05.421]  So if people out there know of any, please contact me through the website.
[01:57:05.421 --> 01:57:11.964]  Also, if people have ideas for guests or for interviews for me to conduct, I'm all ears about that too.
[01:57:11.964 --> 01:57:15.565]  And another thing that I think is really important, I'd really like to direct people to,
[01:57:16.065 --> 01:57:22.370]  Some sort of organization that's providing aid and relief to the people over in the stricken area of northeastern Japan.
[01:57:22.370 --> 01:57:25.993]  But I just don't know what organization to recommend at this point.
[01:57:25.993 --> 01:57:33.839]  Obviously we know about the Red Cross and the way that it's handled donations in the past, so I don't want to start recommending groups without knowing anything about them.
[01:57:33.839 --> 01:57:43.187]  So if people know of any groups or can direct me to some, I'll have to start interviewing representatives and seeing if there's a recommendation I can make, because obviously people there need our help.
[01:57:45.251 --> 01:57:46.052]  Absolutely.
[01:57:46.052 --> 01:57:47.834]  I mean, at this point, it's important to give.
[01:57:47.834 --> 01:57:53.859]  The problem is the Red Cross and United Way have been caught giving to gun grabbers with the money and normally keeping about half of it.
[01:57:53.859 --> 01:58:01.247]  I think small churches, local community organizations, local prefecture governments, I think that's the ticket.
[01:58:01.247 --> 01:58:02.168]  And to just give.
[01:58:02.168 --> 01:58:04.950]  I know my wife's given some online.
[01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:05.951]  She's tried to do her best.
[01:58:06.812 --> 01:58:08.934]  We're trying to get together a shipment.
[01:58:08.934 --> 01:58:16.603]  We held back some of the potassium iodate and didn't sell it that we're trying to get shipped to Japan but to the right group.
[01:58:16.603 --> 01:58:20.106]  We're in there trying to get that together.
[01:58:20.106 --> 01:58:27.855]  Perhaps you can recommend a group because I know Japanese were ordering it from us and I thought, wow, I don't want to have them order it from us.
[01:58:27.855 --> 01:58:28.676]  We held back about
[01:58:30.086 --> 01:58:37.370]  10% or so of it to try to ship to Japan and then we get so busy, we flounder, I floundered around finding where to ship that into Japan.
[01:58:37.370 --> 01:58:42.352]  Maybe I can ship it into you and then you can get it to them.
[01:58:42.352 --> 01:58:43.453]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:52.176 --> 01:58:59.218]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[01:58:59.218 --> 01:59:01.879]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[01:59:01.879 --> 01:59:10.921]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[01:59:10.921 --> 01:59:19.183]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[01:59:19.183 --> 01:59:21.004]  Move quickly while you can still afford it.

[01:59:53.846 --> 01:59:56.228]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.228 --> 02:00:05.574]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.574 --> 02:00:06.875]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.875 --> 02:00:08.656]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.656 --> 02:00:10.418]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.418 --> 02:00:11.999]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.999 --> 02:00:13.540]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:17.743]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.743 --> 02:00:21.806]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.911 --> 02:00:36.455]  Some of the key articles up at PrisonPlanet.com that we haven't even gotten to, I've kind of gotten acclimated to accept this myself, is radioactive blankets United States, radionuclide blankets United States.
[02:00:36.455 --> 02:00:38.595]  Authorities insist levels are harmless.
[02:00:38.595 --> 02:00:42.577]  Incredible German, French, and other forecast and live maps.
[02:00:43.457 --> 02:00:50.122]  of some of the radioactive nuclei Xenon-133 and others that have been detected.
[02:00:50.122 --> 02:00:56.966]  And while James Corbett's talking, joining us from Japan, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.TV, we're going to be playing some of these videos.
[02:00:56.966 --> 02:01:05.452]  Or just go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get the article, Radioactive Nuclei Blankets United States Authorities Insist Levels Are Harmless.
[02:01:06.052 --> 02:01:08.734]  Kind of giving us the Ann Coulter line.
[02:01:08.734 --> 02:01:10.396]  James, let's go ahead and take a few calls.
[02:01:10.396 --> 02:01:11.877]  Let's talk to Kevin in New York.
[02:01:11.877 --> 02:01:14.519]  Kevin, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:01:14.519 --> 02:01:15.360]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:17.682]  I've got to tell you, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[02:01:17.682 --> 02:01:19.884]  A true patriot.
[02:01:19.884 --> 02:01:22.466]  Well, I'm just trying to be a half-moral person.
[02:01:22.466 --> 02:01:24.067]  I mean, I don't really deserve any credit.
[02:01:24.067 --> 02:01:25.008]  I'm just doing my job here.
[02:01:25.008 --> 02:01:27.170]  But what's on your mind, sir?
[02:01:27.170 --> 02:01:31.613]  Well, listen, I actually have something that I want to talk about.
[02:01:31.613 --> 02:01:34.456]  During the first segment of your show,
[02:01:34.915 --> 02:01:50.220]  You mentioned something that I'd rather talk about instead, which is, you had mentioned something about, you know, McCain there rallying together constitutional scholars in the midst of a Bush era there.
[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:59.503]  And, well, you know, it seemed to me a year or two ago that Obama had said he was some kind of constitutional scholar, didn't he?
[02:02:00.151 --> 02:02:04.333]  Yeah, he taught constitutional law at one of the universities.
[02:02:04.333 --> 02:02:05.614]  I forget which one.
[02:02:05.614 --> 02:02:06.495]  I think it's Harvard.
[02:02:06.495 --> 02:02:07.055]  Or was it Yale?
[02:02:07.055 --> 02:02:08.175]  I think it went to Harvard.
[02:02:08.175 --> 02:02:16.520]  But the point is, they know that it's unconstitutional to have the UN give the order to attack Libya and then not even consult Congress.
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:21.103]  And then Congress lays down to it, which is even more incredible.
[02:02:21.103 --> 02:02:23.124]  Amazing precedents being set right now.
[02:02:23.804 --> 02:02:29.346]  And they're moving to have NATO actually command the whole operation, with no consultation with Congress.
[02:02:29.346 --> 02:02:32.026]  James Corbett, what's your take on that?
[02:02:32.026 --> 02:02:32.647]  Absolutely.
[02:02:32.647 --> 02:02:41.749]  Well, if President Obama is the example of constitutional scholars, I think we can do with less constitutional scholars.
[02:02:41.749 --> 02:02:50.652]  It's unthinkable, the idea that the commander-in-chief, who is some sort of constitutional scholar, is waging this completely unconstitutional military action right now.
[02:02:51.598 --> 02:03:00.244]  Well, why do we even have a Congress if they're just ignoring the law, the Constitution, and we're now taking direct orders?
[02:03:00.244 --> 02:03:05.208]  I mean, when the UN said attack, Obama said, you say jump, I say how high?
[02:03:05.208 --> 02:03:08.170]  I mean, it is completely groveling.
[02:03:08.170 --> 02:03:11.173]  Why don't we just appoint him Lord Emperor and just have done with it?
[02:03:12.637 --> 02:03:14.840]  Well, that's basically what he is, this Lord Emperor.
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:20.388]  I mean, what would happen in Japan if the Emperor started telling the Diet what to do?
[02:03:20.388 --> 02:03:21.650]  There would be a big scandal.
[02:03:21.650 --> 02:03:25.556]  I mean, the President has become an Emperor who is a servant of the UN.
[02:03:27.023 --> 02:03:32.005]  Absolutely, and that's one of the good things about the people here in Japan, is that they're not lying down to the emperor.
[02:03:32.005 --> 02:03:34.846]  They don't worship him anymore.
[02:03:34.846 --> 02:03:42.029]  There's a lot of protests, even at school ceremonies and things, where people have to look at the flag and sing the national anthem.
[02:03:42.029 --> 02:03:43.950]  There are still a lot of teachers that won't do it.
[02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:50.752]  So, there are a lot of people who still realize what all of that means and are not happy with the idea of monarchy.
[02:03:50.752 --> 02:03:54.654]  Yeah, swearing allegiance to Japan is not about swearing allegiance to some emperor.
[02:03:56.397 --> 02:04:01.501]  Absolutely, that's absolutely right, and I'm glad that the Japanese people don't buy into that.
[02:04:01.501 --> 02:04:12.310]  Well, you know, the Japanese elite have, from the statistics I've seen, some of the biggest separation between the wealth of the population and the ultra-rich.
[02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:13.551]  They already own the place.
[02:04:13.551 --> 02:04:23.059]  Why would they greedily build reactors on fault lines, on the beach, when they know tsunamis come in, and they acted surprised that a tsunami came with an earthquake?
[02:04:24.252 --> 02:04:36.777]  Yeah, they're only acting surprised now because they've gotten caught in the midst of this terrible tragedy, but obviously, it's unthinkable, the things that they're doing, and it's going to lead to more disasters.
[02:04:36.777 --> 02:04:41.139]  When we come back, I want to get your take on the Japanese people, what you're hearing from them living in Japan all these years.
[02:04:43.174 --> 02:04:47.138]  Where they want the future of nuclear power to go in Japan.
[02:04:47.138 --> 02:04:55.908]  And by the way, this Tokyo Power & Electric is set to build three to four reactors in South Texas on our hurricane-ravaged coastline.
[02:04:55.908 --> 02:04:56.629]  It's not as bad.
[02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:58.972]  We don't have a lot of earthquakes, so I guess it's better.
[02:05:05.060 --> 02:05:06.320]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:10.242]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:10.242 --> 02:05:12.463]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.463 --> 02:05:18.345]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:18.345 --> 02:05:24.587]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:25.007 --> 02:05:30.970]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:30.970 --> 02:05:35.152]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:35.152 --> 02:05:39.454]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:39.454 --> 02:05:45.397]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.397 --> 02:05:48.959]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.959 --> 02:05:50.940]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:51.360]  It's here.

[02:06:54.092 --> 02:06:54.552]  Thank you!
[02:07:00.250 --> 02:07:04.794]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:04.794 --> 02:07:05.714]  Number 1.
[02:07:05.714 --> 02:07:09.137]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.137 --> 02:07:09.998]  Number 2.
[02:07:09.998 --> 02:07:14.881]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:14.881 --> 02:07:15.622]  It's true.
[02:07:15.622 --> 02:07:20.506]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.506 --> 02:07:21.326]  Number 3.
[02:07:21.326 --> 02:07:24.909]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:24.909 --> 02:07:28.612]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:28.812 --> 02:07:29.612]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.612 --> 02:07:32.373]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.373 --> 02:07:36.054]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.054 --> 02:07:36.834]  Number 5.
[02:07:36.834 --> 02:07:40.995]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:40.995 --> 02:07:46.037]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.037 --> 02:07:50.218]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.218 --> 02:07:51.999]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.999 --> 02:07:56.600]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:08:02.387 --> 02:08:09.016]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.016 --> 02:08:12.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.517 --> 02:08:17.339]  We are back live taking your phone calls.
[02:08:17.339 --> 02:08:18.240]  First-time callers 800-259-9231.
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:18.320]  800-259-9231.
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:22.743]  I'm going back to your calls, Scott, William, and others here in just a moment.
[02:08:22.743 --> 02:08:25.465]  But before we do that, we have James Corbett of the Corbett Report.
[02:08:34.575 --> 02:08:40.236]  He's also an English teacher there in Japan, lived there since 2004.
[02:08:40.236 --> 02:08:46.578]  He's there now, and what are Japanese saying about nuclear power and its future there?
[02:08:46.578 --> 02:09:02.421]  Well, perhaps I'm a bit biased because I've interviewed a lot of people, anti-nuclear people, for my website, and I've been to Hiroshima a number of times, and obviously the Hiroshima Peace Institute and other places like that, people are obviously very much opposed to the idea of
[02:09:03.241 --> 02:09:16.832]  Nuclear weapons, of course, and nuclear power is, of course, an adjunct of that, and we see that in things like the MOX fuel, which, of course, is just spent weapons-grade plutonium being used as fuel for these reactors.
[02:09:16.832 --> 02:09:22.216]  So, there is a huge anti-nuclear movement here, and a very strong one, as you can imagine.
[02:09:22.216 --> 02:09:26.039]  And for anyone who hasn't visited the Hiroshima Peace Museum, it's a
[02:09:26.819 --> 02:09:44.477]  It's a harrowing experience and one of the most striking things to me, the one that really started to choke me up when I was there, is at the end of the museum, as you've seen all of this devastation and carnage that was produced by the bombs, and then as you're leaving there's a wall and it's just
[02:09:44.597 --> 02:09:54.746]  A huge wall of just replicas of letters that the mayor of Hiroshima has sent every single time there has been a nuclear test.
[02:09:54.746 --> 02:10:02.812]  The mayor of Hiroshima sends a letter to that government, the president or prime minister of that country, and pleads with them to stop doing it.
[02:10:02.812 --> 02:10:05.575]  And it's just letter after letter after letter after letter.
[02:10:05.575 --> 02:10:10.619]  And you see hundreds of letters pleading for the end of the abolishment of nuclear weapons.
[02:10:10.619 --> 02:10:11.119]  Very powerful.
[02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:13.361]  It is powerful.
[02:10:13.361 --> 02:10:14.262]  I've seen video of it.
[02:10:14.262 --> 02:10:21.368]  We're going to put up on screen a graph of nuclear tests, over 300 by the U.S.
[02:10:21.368 --> 02:10:24.131]  total, more than all other countries combined.
[02:10:24.131 --> 02:10:29.135]  And it was citizens protesting worldwide that stopped the above-ground test.
[02:10:29.135 --> 02:10:33.298]  And it shows the New World Order eugenicist mindset
[02:10:34.039 --> 02:10:46.667]  In that they would drop two A-bombs on Japan, and it came out later that they were unconditionally trying to surrender for at least a month in private face-saving communiques to the West.
[02:10:46.667 --> 02:10:49.889]  They've been firebombed end-to-end with their paper and wood houses.
[02:10:50.569 --> 02:11:03.955]  The firebombing in one single day, in one event a few months before, Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed, the reports I saw, more than 300,000 people, actually more devastating than the two A-bombs they dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that day.
[02:11:03.955 --> 02:11:18.502]  But they did that as a power play, and then the globalists, they didn't care about the Japanese, and they didn't care about Americans, with 300 above ground tests, more than 300, and above ground tests all over the Pacific,
[02:11:18.982 --> 02:11:21.404]  Radiating our own troops, everybody else.
[02:11:21.404 --> 02:11:24.626]  Those islands are still highly radioactive today.
[02:11:24.626 --> 02:11:30.091]  I mean, what type of New World Order person soils their own nest?
[02:11:30.091 --> 02:11:32.512]  I mean, what's wrong with these, with these globalists?
[02:11:32.512 --> 02:11:33.553]  What's going on with them?
[02:11:33.553 --> 02:11:35.595]  Because they're, they're hurting themselves as well.
[02:11:36.946 --> 02:11:37.927]  They absolutely are.
[02:11:37.927 --> 02:11:48.196]  They're destroying the environment of the Earth itself, and it makes you wonder what their end-to-end game really is, because it can't involve living and functioning as a human being on this planet.
[02:11:48.196 --> 02:11:59.787]  They're obviously working towards their transhumanist ideal of merging with the machines and propagating out into space, and it just goes to show the absolutely self-destructive mindset of these people, and anyone who's siding
[02:11:59.867 --> 02:12:00.087]  I'm good.
[02:12:16.533 --> 02:12:17.694]  Well, very well said.
[02:12:17.694 --> 02:12:21.415]  And by the way, you just quoted some of the top transhumanists that we have in Endgame.
[02:12:21.415 --> 02:12:28.759]  It's all over their literature by Nobel Prize winners, top scientists about how anything we do is natural.
[02:12:28.759 --> 02:12:32.801]  If we destroy the Earth, that's evolution, because we were a species that developed.
[02:12:32.801 --> 02:12:36.103]  If we cease to be humans and merge with machines, which is their goal,
[02:12:37.043 --> 02:12:37.243]  I think?
[02:12:52.239 --> 02:12:56.404]  And it's this argument where we're not supposed to have a say.
[02:12:56.404 --> 02:12:58.106]  And no, I do have a say.
[02:12:58.106 --> 02:12:59.628]  I'm not going to eat your GMO food.
[02:12:59.628 --> 02:13:00.910]  Stop pushing it on me.
[02:13:00.910 --> 02:13:02.952]  I don't want a nuclear reactor in my neighborhood.
[02:13:02.952 --> 02:13:07.238]  We have one in Austin that nobody knows about up at the JJ Pickle Center.
[02:13:07.238 --> 02:13:08.039]  I've had enough of it.
[02:13:09.289 --> 02:13:11.130]  Oh, stop being such a Luddite, Alex.
[02:13:11.130 --> 02:13:22.055]  You should just sit there and take it, and you should enjoy nourishing all these nourishing, wonderful GMOs and all this wonderful technology that's being unleashed on us right now and killing people in higher and higher numbers.
[02:13:22.055 --> 02:13:22.895]  This is what you want.
[02:13:22.895 --> 02:13:23.896]  This is what you'll get.
[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:29.082]  It certainly is, and you guys pulled up on Wikipedia the total number the other day.
[02:13:29.082 --> 02:13:33.324]  They're showing a map on screen of just a hundred tests in the U.S.
[02:13:33.324 --> 02:13:34.485]  alone in Nevada.
[02:13:34.485 --> 02:13:37.726]  I know the total number is over 300 by the U.S.
[02:13:37.726 --> 02:13:42.069]  It's over 200 by all other nations, Russia, France, England.
[02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:43.589]  France did a lot.
[02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:44.570]  Just incredible.
[02:13:44.570 --> 02:13:46.211]  Scott in Idaho.
[02:13:46.211 --> 02:13:47.191]  Scott, you're on the air.
[02:13:47.191 --> 02:13:50.813]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:13:50.813 --> 02:13:51.573]  Hello, Alex.
[02:13:51.573 --> 02:13:52.074]  Yes, sir.
[02:13:52.074 --> 02:13:52.394]  Welcome.
[02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:54.941]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:13:54.941 --> 02:14:02.765]  First of all, I want to thank you and your activist listeners for your efforts in the battle for liberty and the cause of freedom.
[02:14:02.765 --> 02:14:16.432]  You've followed the encouragement of Thomas Jefferson, who encouraged us all to educate and inform the whole mass of the people, for they are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.
[02:14:16.432 --> 02:14:22.315]  Ecclesiastes tells us, Alex, that a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.
[02:14:22.771 --> 02:14:28.994]  And your heart has discerned both the time in which we live and the crisis that we currently all face.
[02:14:28.994 --> 02:14:36.198]  The word judgment in that verse comes from the Hebrew word krisis, from which we derive our English word crisis.
[02:14:36.198 --> 02:14:47.004]  It denotes an experience and time of crucial testing and has reference to the experience one undergoes out of which a decision or judgment is made.
[02:14:47.004 --> 02:14:49.365]  And we all now have a decision to make.
[02:14:50.015 --> 02:14:59.000]  Do we want to go along with the insanity that has enveloped the planet?
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:09.945]  With the TSA putting their hands down our pants, with the radiation, with the GMO, with the wars, with the UN ordering our country to attack and the Congress not involved.
[02:15:09.945 --> 02:15:16.989]  The globalists understand these natural laws and they are testing us and setting these wicked, wicked precedents.
[02:15:18.194 --> 02:15:22.778]  It's all coming down now, Alex, and you've been talking about it for many years.
[02:15:22.778 --> 02:15:28.143]  I think I've been listening to you and posting your articles since 1995.
[02:15:28.143 --> 02:15:33.108]  The New World Order agenda, the police state, endless undeclared wars, surveillance society.
[02:15:33.576 --> 02:15:41.001]  Eugenics slash population reduction, economic collapse, it's all happening before our eyes right now.
[02:15:41.001 --> 02:15:45.003]  And that's how history works, my brother, is that everything comes at once.
[02:15:45.003 --> 02:15:49.226]  And everything we've seen is only the birth pains, the buildup.
[02:15:49.226 --> 02:15:51.347]  Even what we're seeing now is only the buildup.
[02:15:51.347 --> 02:15:52.908]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:15:54.208 --> 02:15:57.230]  Absolutely mind-boggling.
[02:15:57.230 --> 02:15:58.391]  Absolutely mind-boggling.
[02:15:58.391 --> 02:16:02.334]  I just want to touch on a couple things here.
[02:16:02.334 --> 02:16:10.441]  First of all, this is all happening to us individually because we have not heeded the warnings of history.
[02:16:10.441 --> 02:16:13.543]  We have not heeded the words of our wise founding fathers.
[02:16:14.205 --> 02:16:22.407]  The words that were spoken at Nuremberg and the words of Eisenhower who warned us about the military-industrial complex.
[02:16:22.407 --> 02:16:27.289]  Abraham Lincoln warned us about the time in which we live in 1864.
[02:16:27.289 --> 02:16:36.131]  He said, and I quote, I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country.
[02:16:36.607 --> 02:16:54.192]  Corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the public is destroyed.
[02:16:54.192 --> 02:16:55.773]  And that's a real quote on record.
[02:16:55.773 --> 02:16:56.433]  God bless you.
[02:16:56.433 --> 02:16:58.833]  I appreciate your call.
[02:16:58.833 --> 02:17:03.575]  And you can see Lincoln two-sided as a tyrant of federal power.
[02:17:04.810 --> 02:17:11.354]  But at the same time, he did issue our own currency and was killed over it and was his own man.
[02:17:11.354 --> 02:17:15.877]  And again, I'm a Southerner and my ancestors were on the side of the South.
[02:17:15.877 --> 02:17:18.559]  It doesn't mean the North was right or the South was right.
[02:17:18.559 --> 02:17:24.463]  The British intelligence, this is mainline history, but it's taught in PhD level, but it's mainline history books.
[02:17:24.463 --> 02:17:25.764]  This is not debatable.
[02:17:25.764 --> 02:17:34.750]  British intelligence came in and fomented the South, who was being wronged by tariffs that were unfairly placed on them and not the North.
[02:17:35.831 --> 02:17:50.525]  They were manipulated into that war and the British put what was it 19,000 troops in up in Toronto threatening to invade trying to get the breakup of the country and then the czar had to send his fleet in to threaten
[02:17:50.925 --> 02:18:04.428]  The British not to do it and that caused a big rift that then caused the British intelligence to fund the communists going in many years later in 1917 to overthrow their cousin Tsar Nicholas.
[02:18:04.428 --> 02:18:07.989]  It's when you know history you understand all this.
[02:18:07.989 --> 02:18:11.810]  James, I'm going to keep you all the way to 30 after but comments on what the caller Scott just said.
[02:18:12.782 --> 02:18:14.682]  Well, I think he was absolutely right.
[02:18:14.682 --> 02:18:22.244]  This is a judgment, this is a crisis, and if there's ever a time for humanity to step up to the plate and take a swing at it, now is the time.
[02:18:22.244 --> 02:18:26.025]  And this isn't a game anymore, and there's no sitting on the sidelines.
[02:18:26.025 --> 02:18:31.467]  People better understand that the hour is near, and they better decide which side they're on.
[02:18:31.467 --> 02:18:32.467]  And I know which side I'm on.
[02:18:33.001 --> 02:18:36.003]  They were neither hot nor cold, so I spit you out of my mouth.
[02:18:36.003 --> 02:18:37.884]  Folks, choose a side.
[02:18:37.884 --> 02:18:40.426]  Consciously choose what side you're on.
[02:18:40.426 --> 02:18:50.133]  Your gut tells you, and I know a lot of you got a tingle right now in your gut and the hair on the back of your neck is standing up because deep down, you know the choice is here.
[02:18:50.133 --> 02:18:51.154]  A spiritual choice.
[02:18:51.154 --> 02:19:01.201]  Doesn't mean we're all perfect, doesn't mean we have all the answers, but just like King David did a lot of bad things, at the end of the day, his heart was right, he was a good person who loved God and loved righteousness.
[02:19:02.201 --> 02:19:15.670]  Fake Christianity is about a bunch of judgments and a bunch of Pharisees picking on each other and saying, I'm better than you and following a bunch of written law instead of getting the law written on your heart.
[02:19:15.670 --> 02:19:16.170]  Okay?
[02:19:16.170 --> 02:19:20.854]  And number one, it's empathizing with the downtrodden.
[02:19:20.854 --> 02:19:23.135]  It's being against aggressive wars.
[02:19:23.135 --> 02:19:24.056]  It's being against
[02:19:24.676 --> 02:19:31.985]  Poison food and water it's it's being against things that are that are wicked evil is not sexy and cool.
[02:19:31.985 --> 02:19:36.471]  It's destructive and And I don't want to get into preacher mode here.
[02:19:36.471 --> 02:19:40.035]  It's just Folks we are so wicked myself included.
[02:19:40.035 --> 02:19:42.438]  We are all immersed in evil.
[02:19:42.438 --> 02:19:43.339]  What is evil?
[02:19:43.339 --> 02:19:44.140]  It's anti-life
[02:19:45.103 --> 02:19:46.265]  It's that simple.
[02:19:46.265 --> 02:19:50.633]  Lovers of death, lovers of lies, lovers of corruption.
[02:19:50.633 --> 02:19:56.945]  They were wise in their wickedness, but ignorant when it came to discernment.
[02:19:58.114 --> 02:20:01.015]  We're going to come back with James Corbett, talk to William and others.
[02:20:01.015 --> 02:20:04.255]  Do you want to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead?
[02:20:04.255 --> 02:20:09.177]  Have you ever thought about actually getting off the grid and becoming truly self-reliant?

[02:21:00.737 --> 02:21:03.119]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:21:03.119 --> 02:21:05.320]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:08.642]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:08.642 --> 02:21:13.745]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:13.745 --> 02:21:17.948]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.248 --> 02:21:20.609]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:20.609 --> 02:21:23.490]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.490 --> 02:21:26.412]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.412 --> 02:21:34.015]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.338 --> 02:21:39.723]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:39.723 --> 02:21:42.586]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:42.586 --> 02:21:46.269]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.269 --> 02:21:47.350]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.350 --> 02:21:48.691]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:48.691 --> 02:21:50.173]  Invisible Empire.

[02:21:59.761 --> 02:22:02.682]  Going solar for cheap is as easy as 123.
[02:22:02.682 --> 02:22:08.803]  If you want to go solar but thought the setup costs were too high, now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200.
[02:22:08.803 --> 02:22:09.564]  Don't laugh!
[02:22:09.564 --> 02:22:12.484]  We've sold over 45,000 solar do-it-yourself kits.

[02:22:29.409 --> 02:22:30.630]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:35.193]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.193 --> 02:22:40.997]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:40.997 --> 02:22:44.639]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:44.639 --> 02:22:47.461]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.461 --> 02:22:52.404]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:52.404 --> 02:22:52.705]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:52.705 --> 02:22:54.046]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.170 --> 02:23:01.851]  This is an urgent message.
[02:23:01.851 --> 02:23:04.353]  Urgent if you care about feeding your family.
[02:23:04.353 --> 02:23:09.077]  S-510 has passed through Congress and will make the sale of heirloom seeds difficult.
[02:23:09.077 --> 02:23:14.921]  Prices of non-GMO seeds are skyrocketing and may be hard to afford in the future, if you can even find them.
[02:23:14.921 --> 02:23:21.706]  As the economy continues to decline, this will make the heirloom seeds worth their weight in gold and one of the best barter tools available.
[02:23:21.706 --> 02:23:26.250]  When food supplies eventually run out, your solution is to grow your own food and barter tool.
[02:23:26.690 --> 02:23:34.196]  Now for a short time, GetSeeds.net offers 100 packets of heirloom non-GMO vegetable seeds for only $59.
[02:23:34.196 --> 02:23:37.678]  Pay with 2 ounces of pure silver or just $59.
[02:23:37.678 --> 02:23:40.521]  The best price on the net for high quality seeds.
[02:23:40.521 --> 02:23:46.105]  Our GetSeeds.net seeds are open pollinated vegetable seeds sealed in a mylar bag for long term storage.
[02:23:46.425 --> 02:23:47.646]  Bulk pricing available.
[02:23:47.646 --> 02:23:51.870]  So get seeds while you still can at GetSeeds.net or call toll-free 877-341-4769.
[02:23:51.870 --> 02:23:52.070]  That's 877-341-4769.
[02:24:35.049 --> 02:24:38.890]  We're going to look into HAARP coming up in the next couple of seconds with Aaron Dykes.
[02:24:38.890 --> 02:24:42.711]  We've got some of that 2008 interview with the director of HAARP.
[02:24:42.711 --> 02:24:43.891]  His phone wasn't the best.
[02:24:43.891 --> 02:24:49.612]  He was from an Air Force base that's in Massachusetts remotely controlling HAARP in Alaska.
[02:24:49.612 --> 02:24:52.653]  They had a PR guy, the colonel, on the whole time.
[02:24:52.653 --> 02:25:03.135]  The whole interview is up at Infowars.com, but Aaron's got a lot of audio clips, but I want to just play short parts of it and then go into mainstream news articles showing that we weren't being told the whole story by him.
[02:25:03.815 --> 02:25:09.916]  And the weather modification and the fact that Dubai and others are now using harp type arrays to manipulate the weather.
[02:25:09.916 --> 02:25:12.077]  They admit that that's what this does now.
[02:25:12.077 --> 02:25:14.557]  It's one of the things that it can do.
[02:25:14.557 --> 02:25:21.939]  James, I wanted to cram in a few final calls here for you with William, Pam, Barry, Luke, Nick.
[02:25:21.939 --> 02:25:26.040]  We'll get to all of them coming up, even if we have to go into overdrive today.
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:27.880]  But any other points you want to add from Japan?
[02:25:29.022 --> 02:25:43.621]  Well let me just confirm something that a caller was making on, a point that a caller was making a couple of days ago on your program, that the school children here are still playing outside at recess, playing in the rain, and still being served milk every day at their school lunch.
[02:25:43.621 --> 02:25:45.604]  Outside Fukushima, in the little town right there.
[02:25:46.508 --> 02:25:57.158]  Right, yeah, no, I was just reading reports about the graduation ceremonies they were having at evacuation centers there, and there's no reports whatsoever that any sort of precautions are being taken.
[02:25:57.158 --> 02:26:04.666]  And I can report that the kids are drinking their milk every day, just like always, and we know that milk is one of the
[02:26:05.286 --> 02:26:08.868]  The key transmitters of the iodine-131 radioactivity.
[02:26:08.868 --> 02:26:18.293]  But you're a conspiracy theorist and so are the scientists that made them ship milk in for six months after all over Europe from outside Europe because of the bioaccumulation.
[02:26:18.293 --> 02:26:20.234]  They're all evil conspiracy theorists too.
[02:26:20.234 --> 02:26:21.494]  Ann Coulter is right.
[02:26:21.494 --> 02:26:22.635]  That milk is good.
[02:26:23.393 --> 02:26:24.114]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:26:24.114 --> 02:26:25.855]  We should be drinking it up and loving it.
[02:26:25.855 --> 02:26:32.580]  But it's just mind-boggling to me that no one's even thought to point this out or to make any sort of fuss about it.
[02:26:32.580 --> 02:26:35.762]  So it's going on right now and I can report that.
[02:26:35.762 --> 02:26:42.286]  Well, we'll definitely get you to pop in later this week or next week as well as our guy on the ground there in Japan.
[02:26:42.286 --> 02:26:44.628]  Let's talk to William in Washington.
[02:26:44.628 --> 02:26:45.469]  William, you're on the air.
[02:26:45.469 --> 02:26:47.030]  Hi, Alex.
[02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:48.391]  How are you doing today?
[02:26:48.391 --> 02:26:48.751]  Pretty good.
[02:26:49.901 --> 02:26:54.305]  Alex, you know, my family came around to Mayflower, too, and we go all the way back.
[02:26:54.305 --> 02:27:01.150]  We had both sides on the Civil War, and I got three kids and two grandkids, and I'm watching what's going on here.
[02:27:01.150 --> 02:27:05.434]  I'm listening to your show, and I'm really concerned about this situation in Japan.
[02:27:05.434 --> 02:27:15.142]  I know that this radiation's cumulative, and that it'll build up in our food chain, it'll build up in our bodies, organs, and in our children, and it'll be very nasty down the road.
[02:27:15.142 --> 02:27:17.444]  My question is, where's the United Nations on this?
[02:27:18.163 --> 02:27:20.647]  Where's our Congress on this?
[02:27:20.647 --> 02:27:22.250]  Where's our elected leaders on this?
[02:27:22.250 --> 02:27:26.176]  Why aren't they saying to Japan right now, you've got to do what they did with Chernobyl.
[02:27:26.176 --> 02:27:30.002]  Throw massive amounts of sand and concrete and stop these leaks right now.
[02:27:32.517 --> 02:27:33.738]  What do you think about that, James?
[02:27:49.056 --> 02:27:51.957]  By the way, the military is here to protect us, supposedly.
[02:27:51.957 --> 02:28:00.018]  They've got assets, NBC assets, for nuclear, chemical, biological, all over the Pacific, all over South Korea, all over Japan.
[02:28:00.018 --> 02:28:01.599]  And notice, we're not getting any U.S.
[02:28:01.599 --> 02:28:13.961]  government readings, and they've got the specialized devices that pick up the exact isotopes and could be giving us pure forecast, but we're having to rely on private universities in France and England to do it.
[02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:15.720]  Absolutely.
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:19.801]  It just gives the lie to the idea of humanitarian and military intervention.
[02:28:19.801 --> 02:28:23.322]  If there was ever a time for it, it's here, it's now, but it's not happening.
[02:28:23.322 --> 02:28:26.283]  It's happening over in Libya, so we know what that's all about.
[02:28:26.283 --> 02:28:29.724]  Oh yes, very humanitarian, backing up Al-Qaeda.
[02:28:29.724 --> 02:28:31.524]  Let's talk to Pam in Indiana real quick.
[02:28:31.524 --> 02:28:37.306]  Pam, you're on the air.
[02:28:37.306 --> 02:28:41.987]  Okay, Barry in California, you're on the air.
[02:28:41.987 --> 02:28:42.908]  Hi!
[02:28:42.908 --> 02:28:44.288]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:28:45.795 --> 02:28:46.476]  Yes, I can.
[02:28:46.476 --> 02:28:47.076]  Thank you for calling.
[02:28:47.076 --> 02:28:48.417]  Go ahead.
[02:28:48.417 --> 02:28:49.077]  Good, good, good.
[02:28:49.077 --> 02:28:51.118]  I need to get off speakerphone, right?
[02:28:51.118 --> 02:28:52.599]  Yeah, we got about a minute, minute left here.
[02:28:52.599 --> 02:28:54.820]  Okay, okay.
[02:28:54.820 --> 02:28:57.702]  So, um, I have a very important question.
[02:28:57.702 --> 02:28:59.683]  It has several parts, so please bear with me.
[02:28:59.683 --> 02:29:01.104]  I'll be concise.
[02:29:01.104 --> 02:29:07.888]  Since listening to your radio shows, I haven't gone outside of my house, and I've had all the windows and doors closed, so I need to know
[02:29:08.530 --> 02:29:20.506]  The actual radiation levels here in Northern California at any given location, not the low, harmless levels that the apologists in the nuclear industry are telling us, and how we can find this out for ourselves.
[02:29:20.506 --> 02:29:21.307]  We've ordered the KI...
[02:29:22.424 --> 02:29:23.685]  Uh, and we have that now.
[02:29:23.685 --> 02:29:25.506]  It's supposed to take 130 milligrams.
[02:29:25.506 --> 02:29:26.587]  It sounds like a lot.
[02:29:26.587 --> 02:29:28.328]  I don't know when to start taking it.
[02:29:28.328 --> 02:29:32.651]  Uh, don't, don't, don't, don't take it until they, according, I'm not going to give you advice on that.
[02:29:32.651 --> 02:29:33.952]  Again, you've got to follow the insert.
[02:29:33.952 --> 02:29:35.933]  Talk to your physician.
[02:29:35.933 --> 02:29:42.497]  Uh, but they do have radiation meters at universities and government, and they're not really giving us specific numbers.
[02:29:42.497 --> 02:29:44.258]  They're just saying it's low elevation.
[02:29:44.258 --> 02:29:46.199]  It's not dangerous.
[02:29:46.199 --> 02:29:49.622]  Uh, Dr. Bob Bowman said basically 200 times safe levels.
[02:29:51.377 --> 02:29:55.321]  We're on the march, the Empire is on the run.
[02:29:55.321 --> 02:29:57.984]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.259 --> 02:30:09.283]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[02:30:09.283 --> 02:30:11.965]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[02:30:11.965 --> 02:30:21.010]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[02:30:21.010 --> 02:30:29.254]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[02:30:29.254 --> 02:30:30.555]  Move quickly while you can still
[02:30:30.555 --> 02:30:31.355]  We're good to go.
[02:31:00.732 --> 02:31:01.893]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:01.893 --> 02:31:08.816]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:08.816 --> 02:31:11.377]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.377 --> 02:31:16.760]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:16.760 --> 02:31:19.801]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:19.801 --> 02:31:21.862]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.102 --> 02:31:28.367]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.367 --> 02:31:31.749]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:31.749 --> 02:31:37.533]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.533 --> 02:31:39.174]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.174 --> 02:31:40.475]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.475 --> 02:31:42.977]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.137 --> 02:31:47.360]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.360 --> 02:31:51.984]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:51.984 --> 02:31:54.566]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:32:02.250 --> 02:32:06.211]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:06.211 --> 02:32:15.072]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:32:15.072 --> 02:32:19.693]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:32:19.693 --> 02:32:30.515]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:32:31.155 --> 02:32:40.664]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:40.664 --> 02:32:46.089]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:32:46.089 --> 02:32:53.595]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:53.595 --> 02:32:56.338]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:33:13.943 --> 02:33:20.367]  Okay, shifting gears because we've covered harp more than a hundred times over the years.
[02:33:20.367 --> 02:33:24.130]  Probably 15 times this year so far, but harp
[02:33:25.270 --> 02:33:28.713]  The government is very secretive about what HAARP does.
[02:33:28.713 --> 02:33:33.076]  And they've got HAARP arrays, not just in Alaska, but all over the world.
[02:33:33.076 --> 02:33:40.962]  And it's over-the-horizon radar, it's weather manipulation, and the Secretary of Defense, Cohen, admitted in 1997 that they do have earthquake weapons.
[02:33:40.962 --> 02:33:44.544]  And there's been a lot of news articles about Australia developing and Israel.
[02:33:44.544 --> 02:33:46.246]  They've got all sorts of different systems.
[02:33:46.246 --> 02:33:52.530]  But in the last year, there's been a mail-online story, London Telegraph, Arabia Business,
[02:33:53.712 --> 02:33:56.314]  Abu Dhabi-backed scientists create fake rainstorms.
[02:34:23.952 --> 02:34:24.573]  I don't know.
[02:34:39.665 --> 02:34:47.250]  And it was during the breaks, I hadn't heard this in four years, that they had this PR colonel come on and break in and say, you can't talk about that.
[02:34:47.250 --> 02:34:54.355]  Aaron has done deep research on this and found that what this guy was saying, he did interviews before my interview, we can't find any after.
[02:34:54.355 --> 02:34:58.438]  But we found different statements from him in previous newspaper interviews from what was on with us.
[02:34:58.438 --> 02:35:00.079]  We planned some clips of it.
[02:35:00.079 --> 02:35:04.522]  His audio wasn't the best, and we just found a kind of cruddy MP3 of it on the web.
[02:35:04.522 --> 02:35:07.023]  I guess we got rid of the high quality ones that we had.
[02:35:07.023 --> 02:35:09.245]  But Aaron, I'm going to try to give you the floor in the limited time.
[02:35:09.625 --> 02:35:10.306]  to go over this.
[02:35:10.306 --> 02:35:17.031]  The point is, HAARP is more than they tell us, because countries have deployed the same technology, the same patents, and admit it's for weather manipulation.
[02:35:17.031 --> 02:35:18.572]  Aaron, break it down.
[02:35:18.572 --> 02:35:21.054]  Yeah, I mean, first of all, we spoke with Dr. Nick Begich.
[02:35:21.054 --> 02:35:31.442]  We went up to Alaska to interview him, and I and Dew and Jacobson, all our video editors, have read his book, so we know there's Bernard Eastland patents talking about weather manipulation.
[02:35:31.442 --> 02:35:34.744]  You've got a special report coming out the next month at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:34.744 --> 02:35:37.606]  That's right, yeah, and the applications of HAARP for
[02:35:39.408 --> 02:35:45.391]  Disrupting communication systems, either from the enemy or from the home country, disrupting missiles, etc.
[02:35:45.391 --> 02:35:47.052]  There's all kinds of uses.
[02:35:47.052 --> 02:35:58.800]  And here we have these Air Force Research Laboratory Directors, including the guy you interviewed, who claim it's only for research, only for the high frequency, aural research, the Aurora Borealis type effect.
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:02.502]  That is all based on the radio frequency ionospheric heating.
[02:36:02.502 --> 02:36:07.165]  That's just the catalyst for all the potential uses of this technology.
[02:36:07.825 --> 02:36:09.447]  And furthermore... And it's all in the patents.
[02:36:09.447 --> 02:36:10.729]  This is not our opinion.
[02:36:10.729 --> 02:36:12.572]  Yeah, and I've got all these research papers.
[02:36:12.572 --> 02:36:18.940]  They're into ELF and VLF waves, which are ultra... extremely low frequency and very low frequency.
[02:36:18.940 --> 02:36:22.044]  The exact opposite of... Which studies show can also manipulate the human brain.
[02:36:22.745 --> 02:36:30.188]  That's true, and that's what triggers earthquakes, if indeed that is being done, which we know it can be done, based on the quote you discussed.
[02:36:30.188 --> 02:36:36.031]  And furthermore, it's the opposite of the high frequency, which is associated with the aural effect.
[02:36:36.031 --> 02:36:39.433]  And we can read those papers later if you want, but we have the clips.
[02:36:39.433 --> 02:36:44.335]  The first clip, he denies that there's any association between harp and weather modification.
[02:36:44.895 --> 02:36:55.807]  And the other clip, he denies that Harp has any other quote, tentacles, and that he's the directorate and knows about everything about the program and that there's nothing secret, etc, etc.
[02:36:55.807 --> 02:36:59.792]  And then you also have a clip where you discuss the Aurora effect.
[02:36:59.792 --> 02:37:00.633]  That's also interesting.
[02:37:00.633 --> 02:37:01.333]  Nothing secret.
[02:37:01.333 --> 02:37:02.575]  They just won't let media in there.
[02:37:02.995 --> 02:37:11.780]  Yeah, and furthermore, Begich's book has this whole report that was produced out of their very Hanscom Air Force Base, which is in Massachusetts, not Alaska by the way.
[02:37:11.780 --> 02:37:12.721]  That's where he's at.
[02:37:12.721 --> 02:37:18.964]  And they have a whole huge, very large publication which they claim doesn't exist and can't be released.
[02:37:18.964 --> 02:37:21.185]  I can pull that quote if we also want.
[02:37:21.185 --> 02:37:23.767]  He wrote an article about this yesterday with all this stuff linked in it.
[02:37:24.673 --> 02:37:27.575]  Yeah, but I found even more overnight as well.
[02:37:27.575 --> 02:37:33.658]  And if you go to the scientific and scholar part of Google, you can pull up a lot of the stuff with this guy's name.
[02:37:33.658 --> 02:37:43.744]  This is an interview, of course, with Dr. Paul Cossey, whose title is Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate for the HAARP program.
[02:37:44.364 --> 02:37:51.026]  And again, you'll hear him, if you listen to the full interview, claim he's the only director over HAARP and he knows all the side branches.
[02:37:51.026 --> 02:38:02.631]  Even though the patent was originally created by Bernard Eastland based on Tesla technology and then transferred through ARCO, the energy company, to Raytheon and other secret military industries.
[02:38:02.631 --> 02:38:09.473]  And there was an interview in the 80s on PBS where the HAARP director from that period admitted it could knock missiles out.
[02:38:09.473 --> 02:38:11.134]  We've got the PBS, them admitting it.
[02:38:12.102 --> 02:38:13.443]  Yeah, and we even have those.
[02:38:13.443 --> 02:38:16.104]  We could pull them up if you want to go into overtime or something.
[02:38:16.104 --> 02:38:23.548]  But, uh, if you want to get to the clips, uh, the 956 denies weather modification, uh, is a good place to start.
[02:38:23.548 --> 02:38:24.928]  Let's roll that clip from 2008.
[02:38:24.928 --> 02:38:28.030]  Weather controller, weather modification.
[02:38:28.030 --> 02:38:32.892]  Well, it has, uh, you know, unfortunately, it's totally off-base.
[02:38:32.892 --> 02:38:34.993]  It has no interactions.
[02:38:34.993 --> 02:38:36.094]  It affects anything.
[02:38:37.298 --> 02:38:38.219]  I'm good.
[02:38:53.971 --> 02:38:56.033]  And that's why it's an anti-satellite weapon as well.
[02:39:14.935 --> 02:39:21.245]  Yeah, and as Begich talks about in numerous interviews, it has the potential to be a ground-based Star Wars system.
[02:39:21.245 --> 02:39:24.530]  That's the whole point, because satellites can be knocked out by the enemy etc.
[02:39:24.530 --> 02:39:27.654]  And they admitted this previously, since it got attention they now deny it.
[02:39:28.137 --> 02:39:39.322]  Yeah, and one of the applications of HAARP is that because satellites can either go out of alignment or be knocked out by the enemy, this would be a ground-based approach that wouldn't rely solely on satellites.
[02:39:39.322 --> 02:39:41.843]  But you see, he denies it has weather modification.
[02:39:41.843 --> 02:39:51.608]  I have a quote right here from Bernard Eastland's patent, who of course developed the HAARP technology, but later became a whistleblower and spoke to Begich and Manning, and it's all in their book.
[02:39:52.048 --> 02:39:56.429]  The patent number 4,686,605.
[02:39:56.429 --> 02:40:07.173]  Weather modification is possible, for example, altering upper atmosphere wind patterns by constructing one or more plumes of atmospheric particles which will act as a lens or focusing device.
[02:40:07.953 --> 02:40:15.180]  And besides that, we know the magnetosphere, the effects of the sun and the moon, all affect weather, which are lower in the atmosphere.
[02:40:15.180 --> 02:40:17.523]  Of course the ionosphere has an effect.
[02:40:17.523 --> 02:40:25.391]  When you, you know, mess with those ionic particles flowing to the two poles, of course when you manipulate that, it's going to affect weather.
[02:40:25.391 --> 02:40:29.975]  That's why they like to build these at poles, because that's the natural gauge right there.
[02:40:29.975 --> 02:40:31.337]  They're tying into the stream.
[02:40:32.051 --> 02:40:38.933]  Yeah, because it all flows to those two points, so they can, I guess, most easily manipulate it from there.
[02:40:38.933 --> 02:40:40.833]  Continuing.
[02:40:40.833 --> 02:40:43.274]  You know, you might want to listen to this whole interview if you haven't.
[02:40:43.274 --> 02:40:48.955]  It's up on InfoWars, as Alex mentioned, but it's 16 minutes into this clip.
[02:40:48.955 --> 02:40:53.396]  You just ask him if there's other areas of harp, and he says, no, there's no other tentacles.
[02:40:53.396 --> 02:40:53.957]  Let's play that.
[02:40:56.508 --> 02:41:02.972]  Well, you talked about a lot of other programs going on, a lot of other directorates and groups.
[02:41:02.972 --> 02:41:08.635]  I mean, are you privy to all the programs going on with HAARP, or are you privy over one directorate?
[02:41:08.635 --> 02:41:10.757]  What do you mean by HAARP?
[02:41:10.757 --> 02:41:21.303]  HAARP is assigned under the directorate I'm in, and it has no tentacles or no other wings in other places I'm not familiar with.
[02:41:22.330 --> 02:41:25.212]  It's a pretty self-contained program.
[02:41:25.212 --> 02:41:37.559]  Okay, so it's one program there, but I know there's a lot of other agencies and things that are there looking at the data, and I guess, you know, I guess they get space on the system to run their own tests.
[02:41:37.559 --> 02:41:42.543]  I mean, how many different agencies are involved looking at the data, doing experiments?
[02:41:42.543 --> 02:41:45.765]  Well, we have a joint program, actually.
[02:41:45.765 --> 02:41:47.906]  It was set up as a joint program some years ago.
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:52.141]  Uh, with the Air Force and the Navy.
[02:41:52.141 --> 02:41:53.622]  Uh, and... Alright.
[02:41:53.622 --> 02:41:54.963]  Aaron, what's the importance of that?
[02:41:54.963 --> 02:42:03.926]  Well, the importance is they claim there's no secrecy, no other hidden aspects to it, but anyone who tries to investigate HAARP is persona non grata.
[02:42:03.926 --> 02:42:06.468]  Uh, you brought up, uh, the... What's his name?
[02:42:06.468 --> 02:42:07.608]  General Parton?
[02:42:07.608 --> 02:42:07.868]  Yes.
[02:42:07.868 --> 02:42:08.808]  Involved in the 80s.
[02:42:08.808 --> 02:42:09.769]  They denied it on air.
[02:42:10.549 --> 02:42:20.013]  Then, as you explain at the end of the clip, I don't know if we're going to get to that, you explain how they did come back on air and admit that, yeah, there was a program, but we're not going to talk about that.
[02:42:20.013 --> 02:42:24.495]  So it just shows that obviously there's more going on than, quote, pure research, as he claims.
[02:42:24.495 --> 02:42:28.696]  Yeah, it was an over-the-horizon radar, because he was the head of Air Force weapons development.
[02:42:28.696 --> 02:42:30.397]  Of course General Partin is going to be in there.
[02:42:31.243 --> 02:42:38.327]  I'm not denying this guy's a real scientist, but he's clearly a front man in this interview and in other publications saying it's only for pure research.
[02:42:38.327 --> 02:42:47.751]  We have other scientists, also from the Hanscom Air Force Base, who claim the same thing, that it's pure research, that, oh, well, maybe there could be military applications.
[02:42:47.751 --> 02:42:52.954]  Well, that's like the now partially-admitted Chemtrail geoengineering program.
[02:42:52.954 --> 02:42:54.895]  They go, oh, well, everything we've been doing's been test.
[02:42:55.675 --> 02:43:00.878]  But it starts right when our researchers decades ago predicted it did in the mid 90s.
[02:43:00.878 --> 02:43:02.779]  It is barium salts, aluminum dioxide.
[02:43:02.779 --> 02:43:05.320]  I mean, it's exactly, but they always just research.
[02:43:06.202 --> 02:43:09.786]  Yeah, that's how they play the card, I guess.
[02:43:09.786 --> 02:43:18.995]  I think we should move into where you're asking about photometers and their other scientific measurements, which are all supposedly just to study the aurora borealis.
[02:43:18.995 --> 02:43:29.666]  Now, I was going off memory from almost four years ago, but I remember, I don't know if it was on-air or off-air, you've had time to hear the whole interview, I haven't, where he talked about it igniting the upper atmosphere, but you're saying you didn't find that, you found him talking about manipulating it.
[02:43:30.390 --> 02:43:37.393]  Well, they just talk about how the radio frequency particles interact with the charged ionic particles that you find at the poles.
[02:43:37.393 --> 02:43:46.298]  Yes, because I talked to guests during the break to try to get more, and then that colonel kept saying, don't tell him, don't tell him, and then he said, I kept trying to keep him longer, and they said, no, we would have done the hour, but this is over.
[02:43:46.971 --> 02:43:51.976]  Well, look, they've been doing ionospheric heating based on radio frequency.
[02:43:51.976 --> 02:43:56.120]  In fact, that's another side part where he talks about Marconi discovering radio.
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:43:59.103]  It's kind of a jab at Tesla, who they covered up.
[02:43:59.103 --> 02:44:03.707]  The Supreme Court went back and... No, I know, but you've heard it, because I remember him saying they can ignite the atmosphere.
[02:44:03.707 --> 02:44:05.709]  Was that said on air or during a break?
[02:44:05.709 --> 02:44:08.212]  That must have been during break, because... What clip do you have, though?
[02:44:08.212 --> 02:44:09.413]  Something about that you said you found.
[02:44:09.833 --> 02:44:22.620]  Yeah, it starts at 2916, but the whole point is they've been doing this heating the ionosphere for a while, but through the HAARP patents, they're able to focus it into a focus beam, and that allows them to manipulate it at a greater point.
[02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:25.021]  Let's play that clip.
[02:44:25.021 --> 02:44:37.948]  Photometers, those are optical-type devices that, if the weather's right, so to speak, in space, a space weather, and there's not too much natural
[02:44:38.926 --> 02:44:41.068]  Disturbance is going on like aurora.
[02:44:41.068 --> 02:45:00.720]  It's what we call quiet, and on those kind of nights, when we send the radio waves from HAARP up, we can produce miniature emissions of light that are somewhat like an aurora thing, but they're so weak that if there's any other natural aurora going on, it wouldn't... I understand, so you observe those.
[02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:02.521]  What are magnometers?
[02:45:02.521 --> 02:45:03.722]  Or magnetometers?
[02:45:03.722 --> 02:45:05.523]  Magnetometers are instruments
[02:45:06.015 --> 02:45:06.576]  I think we're good.
[02:45:18.713 --> 02:45:28.283]  And whenever there's like eruptions on the sun, like a solar flare or magnetic storms, you'll see those magnetic field components.
[02:45:28.283 --> 02:45:29.324]  That's good right there.
[02:45:29.324 --> 02:45:31.185]  So, must have been during a break.
[02:45:31.185 --> 02:45:32.887]  I remember him saying, well it can't ignite it.
[02:45:32.887 --> 02:45:34.509]  And the guy's like, no, don't say that.
[02:45:34.509 --> 02:45:37.732]  But there he is saying, but then the patents admit they're doing this.
[02:45:38.655 --> 02:45:49.001]  Yeah, and your story's consistent because in the later part of the same clip from back in 2008, on the same day, you talk about how they interrupted, how they had a PR guy on behind the scenes.
[02:45:49.001 --> 02:45:51.262]  I don't know if you want to play that part or just talk about it.
[02:45:51.262 --> 02:45:53.243]  Well, how many other clips we got?
[02:45:53.243 --> 02:45:54.223]  Uh, that's it.
[02:45:54.223 --> 02:45:55.424]  Well, let's play that one.
[02:45:55.424 --> 02:45:56.164]  Let's play the next clip.
[02:45:56.164 --> 02:45:57.205]  Which clip is that for them?
[02:45:57.205 --> 02:45:58.365]  Uh, that cue's in at 35-39, number 7.
[02:45:58.365 --> 02:45:59.506]  Alright, let's play number 7.
[02:45:59.506 --> 02:46:00.286]  Uh, pardon me?
[02:46:06.926 --> 02:46:07.326]  Oh, great.
[02:46:07.326 --> 02:46:07.987]  Yeah, we don't have that.
[02:46:07.987 --> 02:46:10.788]  They're having to skip through the file.
[02:46:10.788 --> 02:46:13.429]  Overall, go through some more of those documents.
[02:46:13.429 --> 02:46:16.011]  Well, here's just some of the papers that...
[02:46:17.639 --> 02:46:22.763]  Well, Hekshar is another guy from the Hanscom Air Force Base who you can see in a clip.
[02:46:22.763 --> 02:46:28.968]  There's Paul Cossey, who is the guy you interviewed, also from Hanscom Air Force Base, and other guys.
[02:46:28.968 --> 02:46:34.412]  Stimulated thermal instability for ELF and VLF wave generation.
[02:46:34.412 --> 02:46:37.375]  Again, that's what they use to trigger earthquakes, if in fact they do that.
[02:46:40.683 --> 02:46:46.824]  The feasibility and desirability of an Air Force ELF-VLF satellite to ground communications link.
[02:46:46.824 --> 02:46:47.804]  Now that's back in 75.
[02:46:47.804 --> 02:46:51.605]  That's when they were still, you know, kind of getting the stuff together.
[02:46:51.605 --> 02:46:53.506]  But here we are in the 2000s.
[02:46:53.506 --> 02:46:55.326]  It's well on its way.
[02:46:55.326 --> 02:46:58.907]  There's... It's the same one.
[02:46:58.907 --> 02:47:03.688]  Relative attenuation of TM-TE waves propagating the Earth ionosphere waveguide.
[02:47:03.688 --> 02:47:04.748]  These are government documents.
[02:47:05.256 --> 02:47:10.258]  These are all government documents, all with Cossey as one of the riders, yeah.
[02:47:10.258 --> 02:47:23.522]  There's a description of HAARP's Kekona facility with some results from recent research, also with Cossey and Kennedy, who you were going to interview in 2008, but he did not end up coming on.
[02:47:23.522 --> 02:47:27.084]  There's high-frequency radar astronomy with HAARP.
[02:47:27.084 --> 02:47:32.185]  There's articles about how they reflected off the moon.
[02:47:32.185 --> 02:47:34.026]  And, excuse me.
[02:47:35.623 --> 02:47:36.704]  I have some money here.
[02:47:36.704 --> 02:47:37.564]  What was that out of?
[02:47:50.353 --> 02:47:51.754]  Publication, I guess.
[02:47:51.754 --> 02:47:53.514]  Public publication.
[02:47:53.514 --> 02:48:00.597]  There's a military's mystery machine all about HAARP and how it's, quote, a little bit less ominous.
[02:48:00.597 --> 02:48:04.339]  That was in Popular Science, PopSci.com.
[02:48:04.339 --> 02:48:05.079]  And there's others.
[02:48:05.079 --> 02:48:05.659]  It just goes on.
[02:48:05.659 --> 02:48:12.662]  All right, we have that clip now of... This clip is when I come back and talk about them telling me, you know, what I could and couldn't talk about.
[02:48:12.662 --> 02:48:13.862]  These are your afterthoughts.
[02:48:13.862 --> 02:48:14.763]  This is the afterthoughts.
[02:48:14.763 --> 02:48:15.303]  Here's that clip.
[02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:23.365]  When I got back in town like late last week and he said, only Friday I shut up the director of Harp and I'm like, what?
[02:48:23.365 --> 02:48:24.847]  You should have heard it behind the scenes though.
[02:48:24.847 --> 02:48:27.709]  They had this PR guy on the line with him the whole time.
[02:48:27.709 --> 02:48:29.951]  That's why his phone sounded muffled.
[02:48:29.951 --> 02:48:33.454]  And they put off this whole, you know, persona of it's no big deal.
[02:48:33.454 --> 02:48:34.495]  It's all above board.
[02:48:37.509 --> 02:48:38.650]  So I guess that's that clip.
[02:48:38.650 --> 02:48:46.317]  And I have no doubt that a lot of it is exaggerated what you hear on the web or they combine other programs in with it.
[02:48:46.317 --> 02:48:50.961]  So I mean Aaron, bottom line, you've already written a big article with links.
[02:48:50.961 --> 02:48:54.444]  I guess you're going to add these or do another one because it's just like the chemtrails.
[02:48:54.924 --> 02:49:04.488]  How many patents have you found about mixing the barium salts aluminum dioxide in with the jet fuel so the jet companies don't even know and it's designed to disperse the nuclei through the jet engines?
[02:49:04.488 --> 02:49:07.490]  I mean we just we have just giant stacks of all these admissions.
[02:49:08.103 --> 02:49:28.696]  Yeah, I have dozens if not hundreds of articles and I found other researchers online who've posted probably about 100 patents that are related in one way or another to cloud seeding, to chemtrails, to different means of dispersion, to the use of, quote, albedos to reflect sunlight, which they claim- And Bill Gates is obsessed with this.
[02:49:30.278 --> 02:49:37.041]  Yeah, he is the program to steer hurricanes and we would pay him to avert disaster.
[02:49:37.041 --> 02:49:38.982]  And, you know, it's all the usual players.
[02:49:38.982 --> 02:49:47.746]  Of course, in the White House, the science czar John P. Holdren is involved, who was also involved in SDI, Star Wars programs.
[02:49:47.746 --> 02:49:53.308]  And I don't know if he has a connection to HAARP, but I think there's a connection between those three areas, perhaps.
[02:49:53.308 --> 02:49:54.708]  You got a lot of other research there.
[02:49:54.708 --> 02:49:55.749]  Closing points on this.
[02:49:57.348 --> 02:50:03.111]  Closing points, there's a PBS documentary where they talk about the weather manipulation.
[02:50:03.111 --> 02:50:07.193]  It's contained within the Tesla documentary produced by PBS.
[02:50:07.193 --> 02:50:12.296]  There's a CBC interview where they interview the other guy, Herkshire.
[02:50:12.296 --> 02:50:15.418]  So there's a lot of admission here, and you can also see their talking points.
[02:50:15.418 --> 02:50:18.439]  Yeah, they tried to sell it in the 70s and 80s on TV.
[02:50:18.439 --> 02:50:19.300]  We've got all that.
[02:50:19.300 --> 02:50:25.403]  And since the 90s, with the critical book written by Dr. Begich, that's when they started denying it.
[02:50:27.495 --> 02:50:37.037]  Yeah, and it's critical that Bernard Eastland use Tesla's technology to enhance their heating of the ionosphere, and that branches out into all kinds of military applications.
[02:50:37.037 --> 02:50:39.638]  There's no doubt that there's military applications.
[02:50:39.638 --> 02:50:41.859]  And worse.
[02:50:41.859 --> 02:50:43.239]  Worse?
[02:50:43.239 --> 02:50:44.379]  As depopulation?
[02:50:44.379 --> 02:50:45.120]  Mind control?
[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:47.260]  They got a lot of patents on that.
[02:50:47.260 --> 02:50:49.481]  Yeah, and that's all in play.
[02:50:49.481 --> 02:50:53.942]  Not that I'm an expert on it, but I agree with Begich that we laymen have a right to weigh in on this.
[02:50:55.426 --> 02:50:56.130]  Absolutely.
[02:50:56.130 --> 02:50:58.664]  Lovell, as you're telling us, radiation's good for us.
[02:50:58.664 --> 02:50:59.066]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.345 --> 02:51:07.787]  This message starts with a great offer from Big Berkey Water Filters, because we don't want you drinking dangerous water one minute longer.

[02:52:02.327 --> 02:52:06.351]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.351 --> 02:52:09.595]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.595 --> 02:52:14.380]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:52:14.380 --> 02:52:20.787]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.787 --> 02:52:23.030]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:52:23.550 --> 02:52:23.850]  Tim Geithner?
[02:52:23.850 --> 02:52:24.110]  Bernanke?
[02:52:24.110 --> 02:52:24.570]  They're arsonists!
[02:52:24.570 --> 02:52:25.311]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:25.311 --> 02:52:26.771]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.458 --> 02:52:49.725]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.

[02:53:00.535 --> 02:53:02.876]  The collapse of the dollar is imminent.
[02:53:02.876 --> 02:53:07.019]  You can protect your wealth by buying gold, silver, and strong foreign currencies.
[02:53:07.019 --> 02:53:13.742]  But what if the government confiscates your precious metals, implements exchange controls, or nationalizes your retirement?
[02:53:13.742 --> 02:53:15.023]  You need a backup plan.
[02:53:15.023 --> 02:53:18.845]  That's why you must move your wealth into an offshore asset protection structure.
[02:53:19.025 --> 02:53:31.893]  Go to CollapseProof.com to get your free special report and discover how to store your gold and silver in the world's safest vaults, or how to hold foreign currencies in a way that's safe from bank failures, bank runs, or exchange controls.
[02:53:31.893 --> 02:53:32.594]  Learn how the U.S.
[02:53:32.594 --> 02:53:38.978]  government failed to collect a $36 million claim because the defendant legally used an offshore asset protection program.
[02:53:39.178 --> 02:53:44.860]  This is what you need to keep your wealth safe when the dollar collapses and CollapseProof.com can help.
[02:53:44.860 --> 02:53:47.282]  Our programs are 100% compliant with U.S.
[02:53:47.282 --> 02:53:50.003]  law, but you must act now before it's too late.

[02:53:51.383 --> 02:53:53.064]  Asset protection in financially unsafe times.
[02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:04.932]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:54:04.932 --> 02:54:10.014]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:10.014 --> 02:54:11.335]  Here's the deal.
[02:54:11.335 --> 02:54:14.717]  I cannot do justice to the answer to 1984.
[02:54:14.717 --> 02:54:17.759]  The 1776 contest has been so successful.
[02:54:17.759 --> 02:54:24.923]  We will publish the winners, 1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place in the next hour, at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:24.923 --> 02:54:28.805]  Then those folks, I guess we'll put the contest email, will need to contact us.
[02:54:28.985 --> 02:54:32.206]  I guess we'll contact those channels to make sure it's the bonafide real people.
[02:54:32.206 --> 02:54:36.267]  Get their contact back and send you your $10,000 in prize money.
[02:54:36.267 --> 02:54:39.448]  But tomorrow I will then, on air, you know, go over the winners.
[02:54:39.448 --> 02:54:41.969]  But we're going to announce those the next hour on Infowars.com.
[02:54:41.969 --> 02:54:44.330]  But I want to be able to do justice to everybody.
[02:54:44.330 --> 02:54:47.051]  We've got more on HARP here in the closing minutes.
[02:54:47.051 --> 02:54:53.533]  But Obama rules out land invasion of Libya, just like they call the bombardment a humanitarian mission, not a war.
[02:54:55.303 --> 02:55:04.606]  But meanwhile, News 12 ABC reports Camp Lejeune Marines 2,200 sent to Libya, possibly for invasion.
[02:55:04.606 --> 02:55:07.007]  So we've got all that going on.
[02:55:07.007 --> 02:55:14.049]  You've got a clip here from PBS and this documentary is from the early 80s, correct?
[02:55:15.244 --> 02:55:16.465]  I think it's more recent than that.
[02:55:16.465 --> 02:55:21.549]  It's Tesla the Master of Lightning documentary and it goes into his plans for the HAARP system.
[02:55:21.549 --> 02:55:27.212]  There must be another one that Rob has back there that's from the 80s but let's go ahead and play this clip.
[02:55:27.212 --> 02:55:37.019]  The HAARP project evolved from a patent filed in 1987 in which Tesla's work is referenced.
[02:55:37.019 --> 02:55:44.044]  It proposed using the ionosphere like an enormous electrical circuit to transmit power around the planet.
[02:55:45.876 --> 02:55:55.188]  It even described a means of changing the weather by superheating portions of the upper atmosphere with microwave energy.
[02:55:55.188 --> 02:56:00.575]  Tesla proposed that it might be possible to modify the weather by using radio waves.
[02:56:00.575 --> 02:56:02.177]  I believe that this is impossible.
[02:56:04.358 --> 02:56:19.288]  Ionospheric modification is still in its early experimental stages, but microwave technology has already made it possible to transmit wireless power with the use of satellites.
[02:56:19.288 --> 02:56:22.851]  We're going to Alaska, and in Alaska there is natural gas.
[02:56:24.668 --> 02:56:27.849]  In order to send it somewhere, you have to create a pipeline.
[02:56:27.849 --> 02:56:29.490]  That's very expensive.
[02:56:29.490 --> 02:56:42.615]  So we said, all right, let's go into Alaska, create microwaves from the natural gas, send them to a satellite at a particular geosynchronous orbit, put a reflector there, and send it to Japan.
[02:56:42.615 --> 02:56:51.318]  And in Japan now, you get the rectenna, which transforms these microwaves into 60 hertz, and you get electricity.
[02:56:51.318 --> 02:56:52.779]  So you make, essentially,
[02:56:53.539 --> 02:56:54.300]  Tesla's dream.
[02:57:07.185 --> 02:57:08.585]  Yeah, you see spin in that clip.
[02:57:08.585 --> 02:57:13.266]  Of course, military application and indeed energy application.
[02:57:13.266 --> 02:57:17.407]  We know that stuff is suppressed 30, 40, maybe even 50 years.
[02:57:17.407 --> 02:57:19.828]  So I don't expect they're telling us everything up front.
[02:57:19.828 --> 02:57:26.370]  There's a lot of interesting potential in the technology, but it really puts us in the hands of a potential scientific dictatorship.
[02:57:26.370 --> 02:57:27.950]  Because it's also being done in secret.
[02:57:28.630 --> 02:57:30.352]  And that's the whole national security state.
[02:57:30.352 --> 02:57:31.614]  Great job, Aaron.
[02:57:31.614 --> 02:57:33.376]  Please continue with the great work you're doing.
[02:57:33.376 --> 02:57:34.177]  Thank you.
[02:57:34.177 --> 02:57:35.759]  Two final points here.
[02:57:35.759 --> 02:57:40.124]  The Drudge Report has a link to the Jerusalem Post confirming what we told you last Sunday.
[02:57:40.124 --> 02:57:41.986]  Al-Qaeda is backing the rebels.
[02:57:41.986 --> 02:57:43.728]  That's the Jerusalem Post.
[02:57:43.728 --> 02:57:45.210]  Also, update.
[02:57:46.571 --> 02:57:50.114]  That 15 are dead in new clashes in southern Syria's city.
[02:57:50.114 --> 02:57:52.115]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[02:57:52.115 --> 02:57:57.018]  An army soldier pleads guilty in deaths of three Afghans, admits that they just killed them.
[02:57:57.018 --> 02:57:59.680]  They weren't combatants in cold blood for enjoyment.
[02:57:59.680 --> 02:58:02.001]  There's also some drug charges involved.
[02:58:02.001 --> 02:58:06.344]  So this just shows the type of stuff that's going on that our military has been advocating.
[02:58:06.344 --> 02:58:11.087]  They're only now going to prosecute these guys because they got caught.
[02:58:11.087 --> 02:58:12.108]  Aaron, what's your take on that?
[02:58:12.108 --> 02:58:14.069]  It's amazing.
[02:58:15.922 --> 02:58:16.942]  Good guys torture.
[02:58:16.942 --> 02:58:17.603]  No, they don't.
[02:58:17.603 --> 02:58:19.803]  Don't let them steal America's soul.
[02:58:19.803 --> 02:58:21.644]  Not in our name, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:21.644 --> 02:58:22.604]  Great job with the crew.
[02:58:22.604 --> 02:58:26.945]  I'll be back live with a powerful and informative guest tomorrow.
[02:58:26.945 --> 02:58:29.126]  We'll continue to track the radiation levels.
[02:58:29.126 --> 02:58:31.247]  1,600 times safe levels in Japan.
[02:58:31.247 --> 02:58:33.947]  More of that cloud for the bigger blowouts headed towards the West Coast.
[02:58:33.947 --> 02:58:38.029]  Some of the radiation's already blown over and reached Iceland as of yesterday.
[02:58:38.029 --> 02:58:40.489]  Retransmission with key info starts now at InfoWars.com.

[02:59:14.569 --> 02:59:14.970]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:14.970 --> 02:59:15.750]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:15.750 --> 02:59:18.071]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
