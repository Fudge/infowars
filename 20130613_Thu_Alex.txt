[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:38.680]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen thank you
[00:38.680 --> 00:47.200]  for joining us on this Thursday Worldwide Transmission the 13th day of June 2013 we're
[00:47.200 --> 00:55.240]  going to be live here for the next three hours General Hamed Ghul that nobody can get on television
[00:55.240 --> 01:00.920]  or radio in the Western media nobody will be joining us because he's a listener of the show
[01:00.920 --> 01:10.440]  General Hamed Ghul who ran the Afghan war with the CIA against the Russians will be joining us
[01:10.440 --> 01:16.520]  from Pakistan to talk about the West now running al Qaeda in Libya in Syria and what he thinks is
[01:16.520 --> 01:21.760]  behind that let's just say a lot of government agencies will be listening on air and on the
[01:21.760 --> 01:27.800]  phone line we had a lot of times they try to jam the phone lines we have to move around then
[01:27.800 --> 01:34.440]  Colonel Tony Schaefer will be joining us who was blocked from killing bin Laden right before 9
[01:34.440 --> 01:40.760]  11 about two months before in 2001 he is going to be coming on to give us his take on the whole
[01:40.760 --> 01:47.240]  NSA situation and then I got a nice call from Dr. Pachennick this morning saying he's got the
[01:47.240 --> 01:52.600]  big inside scoop and his big buddies with General Alexander the head of the NSA or head of cyber
[01:52.600 --> 01:58.760]  command we're going to work on getting him on tomorrow or Sunday we'll we'll see about that you
[01:58.760 --> 02:05.000]  know last night I had dinner with my dad and he said you know I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't
[02:05.720 --> 02:14.280]  talk about me and the CIA and I said why and he goes because it sounds crazy
[02:14.280 --> 02:21.640]  and I said well was your run-ins with them true I mean I saw some of it as a kid and he said well
[02:21.640 --> 02:28.120]  yeah but people aren't going to believe it I said I don't care General Hamid Ghoul's coming on that
[02:28.120 --> 02:35.800]  sounds crazy it's happening I had MI5 and police tell me Bilderberg's gonna go public to BBC we
[02:35.800 --> 02:42.760]  broke it it happened and more and more that's the issue that I have trouble with my dad does we
[02:42.760 --> 02:47.880]  all do we can't believe how real reality is how bizarre it is for the stranger than fiction
[02:49.160 --> 02:54.840]  so my dad opened up last night and said I guess go ahead and talk about it he didn't sign any
[02:54.840 --> 03:03.000]  national security agreements about when he was one of the favorite just because he was a you know
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.280]  smart guy and friendly professors once a week when he went and taught at Baylor Dinnacle
[03:10.280 --> 03:21.720]  Baylor dental school and oral surgery school and he told me some pretty wild stuff how they would
[03:21.720 --> 03:28.680]  send the CIA there because they could have bigger operating rooms they have to have other CIA people
[03:28.680 --> 03:33.720]  there when anything medical was done to anybody and of course that's on record that that goes on
[03:33.720 --> 03:39.320]  because they could drug somebody and try to get data so that was one reason but then my dad and a
[03:39.320 --> 03:44.360]  few other professors out of a whole bunch of them there were picked to be the ones they wanted to
[03:44.360 --> 03:49.240]  be worked on by because they knew my dad's I guess family background in things you know goes way back
[03:50.760 --> 03:55.560]  that's kind of how this works at least in the old days is if you went back to the start of the
[03:55.560 --> 03:59.960]  country then you were like you know seen as safe or whatever CIA is completely different now it's
[03:59.960 --> 04:03.960]  just completely turned over to foreign corporations and globalist and has been deeply in bed with
[04:03.960 --> 04:08.840]  them for a long time but he was telling me about senior CIA people coming and that's when they
[04:08.840 --> 04:14.680]  tried to hire him and some of the other professors to go work in Maryland and they said we noticed
[04:14.680 --> 04:21.160]  in your college file you were into cybernetics and electrical engineering and even did some of
[04:21.160 --> 04:25.960]  that in the national science program when you were in high school building lasers and things you
[04:25.960 --> 04:30.520]  like that and he goes but yeah I have to go back to school and get an electrical engineering no no
[04:30.520 --> 04:36.840]  no there are shortcuts you don't need to do that the point is is my dad's like don't tell those
[04:36.840 --> 04:41.560]  stories they sound nice you know the general public won't believe it well whatever it's true
[04:41.560 --> 04:45.720]  so it's told and he said I could tell it and I kind of babbled through it because it was parts of
[04:45.720 --> 04:51.480]  it he didn't want told so that's why I was kind of bumbling around there but just how bizarre
[04:51.480 --> 04:57.720]  that in the early 80s they were already building some type of cyborg operation we'll be right back

[09:36.520 --> 09:42.440]  and he claims that he's now predicted somewhat accurately because it's now begun started last
[09:42.440 --> 09:47.320]  week it's continuing global shares drop dollar slumps as route gathers pay so i'm going to
[09:47.320 --> 09:53.480]  get him back on today or tomorrow for like 10 minutes nikai plunges 6.4 re-enters bear market

[10:08.360 --> 10:13.160]  with mike adams the health ranger sitting in said that look you know in congress in congressional
[10:13.160 --> 10:20.360]  investigations uh that al qaeda and muslim extremists cannot be targeted by the nsa uh
[10:20.360 --> 10:27.640]  and that it's only for the tea party well investors business daily has confirmed that with congress
[10:27.640 --> 10:34.040]  this is a big deal i mean not only were they always building homeland security for the american
[10:34.040 --> 10:39.080]  people and to intimidate the press and to make sure good people in government can't blow the
[10:39.080 --> 10:44.200]  whistle and stop corruption now they're not even saying it's pointed at al qaeda anymore
[10:46.360 --> 10:49.480]  and that's why when i go through tsa and they want to grope me and search me and
[10:49.480 --> 10:53.800]  ask me if i'm a terrorist i just go hey the government runs al qaeda they ship in the drugs

[11:29.480 --> 11:33.320]  now they're taught to not be on any leashes with the constitution or bill of rights but when it comes
[11:33.320 --> 11:39.000]  to government dominating each other that's where it's going on the police might as well be robots
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.120]  now well how they're being watched live in their squad cars more and more with these data links
[11:44.120 --> 11:48.840]  and audio links and they're reviewing what they do and telling them to be a more aggressive and
[11:48.840 --> 11:53.160]  telling them to be rude and telling them to dominate that's the kind of stuff going on
[11:53.160 --> 11:58.680]  that's the revolution in policing are trying to push because the globalists have got to get
[11:58.680 --> 12:04.680]  things ready before they collapse everything or there'll be a restoration of the republic
[12:04.680 --> 12:09.560]  the globalists of the revolutionaries they're the ones trying to twist society bankrupt
[12:09.560 --> 12:20.280]  institutions deindustrialized to get control we're under a military globalist economic attack

[12:45.240 --> 12:51.400]  now it's ready to be unleashed and unleash hell current demo like five years ago right wrote articles
[12:51.400 --> 12:58.200]  about cyber command it's already operating they're building giant huge bases in san antonio dallas
[12:58.200 --> 13:03.560]  austin just around where i live there's one down the street from my house that spies on citizens
[13:03.560 --> 13:10.680]  locally a threat fusion centers everywhere giant facility in utah facilities in the ozarks i mean

[13:16.120 --> 13:20.360]  being spent i saw one number of about 15 times the manhattan project
[13:24.120 --> 13:29.960]  it's they told you to fight al-qaeda it's actually used to shut down the internet and
[13:29.960 --> 13:38.200]  spy on anybody who's a resisting al-qaeda the radical muslim jihad brigades they use to take
[13:38.200 --> 13:43.800]  down their enemies they took down the constitution with them they're taking down libyan syria trying
[13:43.800 --> 13:49.000]  to take down russia with them they took down syria with them had the muslims attacks syria

[13:53.960 --> 14:01.480]  the albanian muslims and al-qaeda and again i'm not anti-serve i'm not anti-muslim i'm showing you
[14:01.480 --> 14:06.760]  how this is done sure the serbs in atrocities and the croats and the muslims did atrocities as well
[14:06.760 --> 14:11.240]  in fact about two to one against the serbs sometimes i'll get in the car and you know some
[14:11.240 --> 14:17.720]  people say i am i am you know Croatian or i am Croatian muslim and i don't appreciate you supporting
[14:17.720 --> 14:23.800]  the serbs and i'm like look did you know the numbers you know that you guys started a lot
[14:23.800 --> 14:28.280]  of that and actually killed about double the serbs does not matter they are pigs and i'm like well
[14:28.280 --> 14:33.880]  i'm not a serb okay i got a lot of blood in me and i'm not slovak i think slovaks are great great
[14:33.880 --> 14:39.960]  people but i'm not slovak okay i don't have a dog in this fight other than justice and you know
[14:39.960 --> 14:45.160]  the uan and nato started all that and went in and they're just like whatever you are some of what
[14:45.160 --> 14:53.320]  you say is good but much of it you just serve me in pigs the point is is that i'm not i'm not
[14:53.320 --> 15:04.360]  arabic i'm not semitic i'm not i don't have any connection to syria other than syria was democratizing
[15:04.360 --> 15:09.640]  and being friendly and women weren't wearing burkas and their standard living was going up despite all
[15:09.640 --> 15:15.320]  sorts of sanctions and stuff and they were not funding terrorism and they have jihadis swinging
[15:15.320 --> 15:21.240]  by the chandeliers of their country beheading christians burning down mosques blowing up
[15:21.240 --> 15:27.080]  synagogues and man bill clinton's in the news today in politico going bill clinton splits
[15:27.080 --> 15:32.280]  with president obama on syria says he's not doing enough see how that gives obama fake left cover
[15:32.280 --> 15:38.680]  you've only given a billion to al-qaeda you've only got howitzer attacks going out of turkey against
[15:38.680 --> 15:44.040]  him you've only got that's not enough obama and then that gives obama cover oh he's not doing enough
[15:44.040 --> 15:51.480]  he's a peacenik let's give him a peace prize and they got the neocons going attack attack
[15:52.200 --> 15:58.600]  but it's like i agree with john mccain it's all they all just sit around and go okay we're all
[15:58.600 --> 16:02.840]  going to be for the nsa spying and diane feinstein you're going to come out against it even though
[16:02.840 --> 16:07.720]  your husband's getting contracts from it in the hundreds of millions how's that sound and then
[16:07.720 --> 16:12.920]  she comes out and puts out a half baked attempt you know who would he to have questions uh i mean it's
[16:12.920 --> 16:19.560]  all bad theater i mean the worst dinner theater you've ever gone to dinner theater you don't have
[16:19.560 --> 16:25.160]  dinners and see a play the worst dinner theater is better than these people they are bad actors
[16:26.680 --> 16:34.360]  and i mean that as a double entendre pine they are bad actors on every single front they're just
[16:34.360 --> 16:42.280]  gangsters who want to impoverish the west so they don't ever have a political rebellion that puts them
[16:42.280 --> 16:47.640]  all in jail and they they write books explaining that i mean that's really what makes me so mad
[16:47.640 --> 16:52.520]  about all this is they're blowing the engine out of the us they're shutting down our power plants our
[16:52.520 --> 16:58.920]  grids paying to ship our jobs overseas it's not just that competition with slave labor in china
[16:58.920 --> 17:05.480]  you know you pay 21 billion to move general motors to china the government federalizes it with your
[17:05.480 --> 17:12.600]  money when it was far from going under and then ships it to china and it's in the back of the
[17:12.600 --> 17:18.760]  newspaper like a great thing and then obama raises the carbon price yesterday of a defunct
[17:18.760 --> 17:27.000]  defeated never passed law and then the money literally goes to him he has major investments
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.880]  in the chicago mercantile just flagrantly illegal flagrantly ridiculous see there's just some of
[17:33.880 --> 17:44.840]  the news uh that i've got here in the in the stack today by the way colonel schaefer thought he was on

[18:49.880 --> 18:57.560]  so we've got that and then we finally got breaking what we've been covering for years
[18:58.200 --> 19:04.040]  on democracy now and in a radar online story government keeps a list of eight million names
[19:04.040 --> 19:13.080]  considered threats to be rounded up during a civil emergency unbelievable yeah that's going to work
[19:13.080 --> 19:19.000]  real well you guys couldn't hold bag dad but you're going to try to arrest eight million americans
[19:19.000 --> 19:25.400]  and take us to your little uh summer doc how it isn't going to happen but if you want to start a
[19:25.400 --> 19:34.280]  civil war and make yourselves all targets be my guest i mean i've done everything i can to try
[19:34.280 --> 19:42.280]  to stop this total criminal insane takeover i'm you know the the general staff try to tell hitler

[24:29.560 --> 24:36.040]  and then we've got uh colonel uh tony schaefer joining us with the inside scoop on the nsa the
[24:36.040 --> 24:42.760]  funding of al qaeda all the big scandals he's got a lot to break down today uh when he joins us
[24:42.760 --> 24:49.880]  and then we've got general hamed ghoul the former head of pakistani intelligence isi who ran
[24:50.840 --> 24:59.960]  the cia covert war uh in afghanistan against the russians he's going to be joining us to give us
[24:59.960 --> 25:04.200]  all the little geopolitical secrets because i mean i've already researched all this myself i know
[25:04.200 --> 25:10.040]  ghoul to be extremely accurate and to have made big announcements months before they were in the
[25:10.040 --> 25:18.520]  geopolitical uh arena publicly so uh very powerful interview uh with ghoul set for the
[25:20.040 --> 25:29.400]  third hour today i guess that'll be 11 11 p.m pakistan time okay uh some of the other you know
[25:29.400 --> 25:35.240]  big news i'm going to keep getting into a shavers on with us nsa spying is about intimidating the
[25:35.240 --> 25:40.200]  media and the american citizens blanket surveillance is about covering up government corruption
[25:40.200 --> 25:45.640]  and chilling free speech not catching terrorists and i i i should probably have watson add to
[25:45.640 --> 25:49.560]  the article because i worked on it with him it's an article by alex jones and paul joseph watson
[25:50.200 --> 25:55.000]  this investor's business daily article and the congressman on monday here on the show is saying
[25:55.000 --> 26:03.000]  exactly that but it's now been confirmed that they will not target radical mosque even with uh
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.920]  warrantless wiretapping but everyone else and that's because they don't want the radical
[26:08.920 --> 26:13.800]  mosque being surveilled because they're running them they're trying to get attacks going because
[26:13.800 --> 26:18.840]  every time there's an attack who loses their rights i mean you cannot deny this and and it's
[26:18.840 --> 26:23.640]  the fact that we'll cover this great truth and with the first to do it that i'm demonized by the
[26:23.640 --> 26:31.960]  entire liberal fake in a liberal authoritarian media all the fake neocons all of them are attacking
[26:31.960 --> 26:38.760]  us now because it's all coming out and we've got incredible credibility it's coming out the government
[26:38.760 --> 26:44.040]  gave a billion bucks to al qaeda ran paul saying why are we funding al qaeda in the senate floor
[26:44.040 --> 26:51.320]  and he's the most popular republican because mainline republicans are waking up and they know
[26:51.320 --> 26:56.840]  who hits the barb wire first max keiser has an article out today that we posted on info wars.com
[26:56.840 --> 27:04.200]  where it talks about shock jocks and populist politicians awakening britain and now the liberty
[27:04.200 --> 27:08.120]  movement's the hottest thing over there and how liberty candidates are winning in all the major
[27:08.120 --> 27:15.320]  elections i mean i was there and the cops were all we love you we're awake i mean it's like chelchescu's
[27:15.320 --> 27:21.160]  romanian ladies and gentlemen no one knew it was going to fall until the day it did and most of you
[27:21.160 --> 27:28.440]  again are not recognized like i am or some other libertarian public figure is we get overrun with
[27:28.440 --> 27:34.520]  supporters now again we're still a minority maybe 30 40 percent but five percent started the war
[27:34.520 --> 27:39.320]  with the brits or they started it but you know we want it our ancestors and then set up a new
[27:39.320 --> 27:46.520]  country i'm not looking for a war i have selfish reasons for that but also intellectually militarily
[27:46.520 --> 27:52.360]  historically they want to start a physical war because they've got a better chance of winning that
[27:53.080 --> 28:00.600]  than they do of winning a gradual awakening velvet revolution a cultural revolution but not
[28:00.600 --> 28:07.480]  a Maoist one basically the quintessential opposite a libertarian individually driven but also
[28:07.480 --> 28:13.400]  collectively working together as individuals against the collective communist who themselves
[28:13.400 --> 28:19.640]  are run by the collective crony capitalist and that's the great oxymoron that is an oxymoron it
[28:19.640 --> 28:24.920]  is the ultra old money that always finances command and control because that's how they
[28:24.920 --> 28:30.600]  centralize markets that's where the mega wealth comes from then you don't have to compete you just
[28:30.600 --> 28:36.600]  got to have cameras and black uniforms and citizen snitches and and we know where all this spying goes
[28:36.600 --> 28:43.320]  historically we know where it leads so this article is very important nsa spying is about
[28:43.320 --> 28:50.120]  intimidating the media and american citizens blanket surveillance is about covering up government
[28:50.120 --> 28:55.800]  corruption and chilling free speech not catching terrorists and then paul watson goes over all of
[28:55.800 --> 29:02.760]  the history and evidence of that i mean they've had all this total surveillance did it stop 9 11
[29:02.760 --> 29:09.560]  no did it stop the boston bombings no then you go find out oh actually people at the nsa knew
[29:09.560 --> 29:16.120]  about the attacks of 9 11 and tried to stop it and were ordered to stand down and what did those
[29:16.120 --> 29:20.600]  people listening to the phone calls here like c bell edmunds and others
[29:22.520 --> 29:31.560]  they heard al qaeda being commanded by criminal elements of who the cia and private contractor
[29:31.560 --> 29:37.880]  corporations the government's so big folks we said the government did 9 11 criminal elements
[29:37.880 --> 29:42.760]  within the government that want to bring down freedom and want to have a centralized system
[29:42.760 --> 29:51.000]  they run al qaeda they did it we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen we're on the march
[29:51.000 --> 30:03.000]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network you prepare by purchasing gold food
[30:03.000 --> 30:08.040]  and firearms but if you don't have a home security system then you're missing a critical weapon in

[33:57.800 --> 34:00.760]  to the global crime syndicates organized takeover
[34:03.080 --> 34:08.760]  and they are trying to take us to a very bad place indeed the toll-free number to join us
[34:08.760 --> 34:28.280]  ladies and gentlemen is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 and it is the 13th day of june 2013 and i'm
[34:28.280 --> 34:36.680]  going to your phone calls here in just a moment but getting back to the public rollout now whether
[34:36.680 --> 34:41.960]  these leaks are real or not they're going to try to spin it now as a public discussion
[34:42.520 --> 34:47.480]  to sell us on how everything we do being tracked is for our own safety
[34:49.400 --> 34:54.680]  and even if they can convince a majority of people to support this in a constitutional republic
[34:54.680 --> 35:01.160]  it is still illegal just like if you have 51 percent of people saying you know blacks shouldn't
[35:01.160 --> 35:07.160]  have a right to vote or eat in a restaurant caught the constitution the bill of rights common law
[35:08.280 --> 35:15.720]  common sense states no they do have that right and it's the same story over and over again
[35:15.720 --> 35:21.320]  they're trying trying to sell us on this idea but i will remind you again what is an investor
[35:21.320 --> 35:27.880]  business daily that the nsa is not allowed to target muslims and people say that's because
[35:27.880 --> 35:34.760]  obrach obama is a secret muslim no he's not they they don't want other parts of federal agencies
[35:35.560 --> 35:44.280]  stopping the provocative third groups that they're out there organizing to carry out events
[35:44.280 --> 35:52.200]  which they then use to demonize muslims and go after the general public's rights and liberties
[35:52.200 --> 35:57.960]  it's a very simple equation it's full spectrum dominance they go after the
[36:00.200 --> 36:04.120]  american people with the terrorist threat and they go after the countries that they
[36:04.120 --> 36:08.760]  blame for the terror threat with what they've manufactured and then the globalists get to
[36:08.760 --> 36:14.040]  take over everything at the same time it is elementary how they do this and we have to
[36:14.040 --> 36:20.040]  get this basic understanding through our minds and it's not my view it's not my opinion
[36:20.040 --> 36:29.480]  this whole thing is hiding in plain sight it is now all admitted and that is why we're
[36:29.480 --> 36:34.280]  being demonized that is why we're being attacked that is why they're going after us because we're
[36:34.280 --> 36:38.120]  here going the government's training to take on conservatives libertarians got owners and
[36:38.120 --> 36:41.960]  saying veterans of the new terror threat the government's buying billions of rounds of ammo
[36:41.960 --> 36:46.680]  seven thousand armored vehicles they're setting up checkpoints they're getting riot control police
[36:46.680 --> 36:50.840]  ready everywhere they're saying that they're preparing for imminent collapse i don't know if
[36:50.840 --> 36:54.920]  that's really going to happen or they're using this as an excuse to put all this in place but
[36:54.920 --> 36:59.800]  regardless it's a giant boondoggle to the military industrial complex that eisenhower warned us
[36:59.800 --> 37:07.240]  about he said it will take over and it's run by a technological uh elite that's a quote
[37:09.160 --> 37:13.880]  and then here we are he said that in 61 and here we are it's all come true
[37:13.880 --> 37:20.680]  and that's why they're attacking us because we're speaking common sense and yeah then i go on a bbc
[37:20.680 --> 37:27.320]  news show and they got two guys cutting me off trying to shut me up laughing at me so i just blew
[37:27.320 --> 37:33.400]  up at them and said look i'm not going to play this game anymore i want to do a special piece on this
[37:33.400 --> 37:39.960]  from vice magazine vice actually does some pretty good story sometimes another they're on
[37:39.960 --> 37:46.040]  mainstream television they're getting a little bit more establishment and i want to do a kind of
[37:46.040 --> 37:52.360]  like a professor piece on this to show the anatomy of a sophomoric trendy hit piece of course almost
[37:52.360 --> 37:56.520]  every commenter in this article when i read this morning like 90 plus percent of them are against
[37:56.520 --> 38:02.120]  it saying what's wrong with you you're demonizing the crowd this is done to make dissent look bad
[38:02.680 --> 38:08.600]  they went and found the you know people out there kind of having a carnival time maybe five percent
[38:08.600 --> 38:13.560]  of the thousands that came out to protest bilderberg and then they say no one could tell us why they
[38:13.560 --> 38:19.400]  were there no one could tell us what bilderberg was everyone was basically idiots and they say it
[38:19.400 --> 38:26.680]  over and over and over again lying to their audience and you know who was really there
[38:27.240 --> 38:32.280]  a famous because it was in the news a i wish i had to run into him a famous 90 year old
[38:32.280 --> 38:40.120]  raf fighter ace that shot down a bunch of german aircraft over london he was there
[38:41.080 --> 38:45.880]  there were two members of parliament a member of the european union parliament giving powerful
[38:45.880 --> 38:53.560]  speeches uh the crowd basically about half of them look like irish and british and
[38:54.120 --> 38:59.240]  scottish farmers there were a lot of scots that you know came down
[38:59.240 --> 39:04.520]  on i think it was a group of scots that actually walked in because that's like a cultural thing to
[39:04.520 --> 39:11.160]  walk 400 500 miles they they walked in to london to be there just an amazing group of people and
[39:11.160 --> 39:19.960]  they went around and found every person that was either to have a good time and acting goofy so what
[39:19.960 --> 39:25.480]  so what we should go protest and cover things in and make it fun i mean i don't judge people
[39:25.480 --> 39:30.920]  because they got tattoos on their faces or you know or they're uh you know offering you know people
[39:32.440 --> 39:35.800]  you know massages or whatever but but that was the small minority
[39:38.040 --> 39:41.880]  and they distort it and make a sick joke out of it and the good news is people
[39:43.080 --> 39:47.960]  got angry at it but then you know they ask well what is bill deberg what does it matter and
[39:47.960 --> 39:52.120]  alex claims they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines why would they want to do that and
[39:52.120 --> 39:56.600]  nothing he said was coherent really we have a history of western governments doing thousands
[39:56.600 --> 40:04.520]  of declassified lethal test programs nerve-gassing trips putting syphilis in people's vaccines
[40:07.240 --> 40:12.120]  just radiating foster children and i'm up there giving a speech about that and saying they're
[40:12.120 --> 40:18.680]  doing it now on a wide scale and holding up the london independent from that day saying 40 percent
[40:18.680 --> 40:25.800]  of britain's will have cancer within four years at the current rate national health service but no
[40:25.800 --> 40:31.000]  discussion of why is everybody getting cancer it's always let's find a cure and then in the
[40:31.000 --> 40:37.000]  article they say what does that mean we should find out why everybody's getting cancer why the
[40:37.000 --> 40:43.480]  rate's going up instead of finding a cure and the article says that makes no sense we want to find a
[40:43.480 --> 40:52.360]  cure it'd be like if a hundred people a night in austin texas were getting shot say we need to find
[40:52.360 --> 40:57.880]  a way to cure gunshot wounds instead of finding out who's shooting a hundred people a night
[40:59.960 --> 41:04.840]  i mean if a thousand people a day in chicago were being poisoned by cyanide would you try to
[41:04.840 --> 41:11.560]  find a cure for cyanide poisoning and have everybody walk around with a pack of cyanide
[41:11.560 --> 41:18.120]  antidote which by the way there isn't one no you try to find out who's poisoning people and they
[41:18.120 --> 41:27.960]  literally sit there acting like they don't know what i'm talking about and then i thought about it
[41:29.960 --> 41:35.160]  that's why i get mad at pierce morgan that's why i got mad at the bbc with a bunch of condescending
[41:35.160 --> 41:40.760]  fake intellectuals are sitting there going so you believe builder bird exists and you believe
[41:40.760 --> 41:46.840]  they have bad plans i'm like look i'm done playing games so jesus christ went in and overturned the
[41:46.840 --> 41:52.280]  money changers tables paul revere wrote around saying get your guns get ready to kill people
[41:52.280 --> 41:58.280]  and we call them a hero i'm just saying look i'm done with you you just came into this promo piece
[42:02.040 --> 42:08.120]  saying that oh these people believe we're poisoning the water that a builder bird guy
[42:08.120 --> 42:14.120]  in the tape piece and one in studio right before i went on i walked past him i interviewed
[42:14.120 --> 42:20.840]  that their treasury secretary you know the x checker the chancellor it's on info wars dot com
[42:22.120 --> 42:26.280]  i saw people on there going oh really you would have been a bill burger yeah right people cannot
[42:26.280 --> 42:30.840]  believe that someone could stand up that someone could resist that someone could have success and
[42:30.840 --> 42:37.080]  i'm nobody people cannot believe anything they can't believe we had mike judge on the show
[42:37.080 --> 42:41.400]  they couldn't believe we interviewed charlie sheen they couldn't believe uh we interview ron paul
[42:41.400 --> 42:45.000]  they can't believe we're gonna have amid gul on they can't believe we have whistleblowers
[42:45.000 --> 42:51.240]  because they live unexceptional lives in their basements thinking everyone else is like them
[42:51.800 --> 42:57.560]  and that and and and that humanity is basically done and that's why they don't believe there
[42:57.560 --> 43:01.720]  could be corrupt elites even though those corrupt elites write books about what they're doing because
[43:01.720 --> 43:08.200]  they think everyone is such an incredible pathetic jellyfish cynical wannabe trendy who are actually
[43:08.200 --> 43:13.560]  just scared little boys and girls sitting there criticizing the rest of us that want to build a
[43:13.560 --> 43:26.680]  better civilization and a better future i mean i've had people over the years come to my house or
[43:26.680 --> 43:30.760]  my parents house and see some of my well paintings which i don't even think are that good i mean some
[43:30.760 --> 43:35.160]  of them are pretty good and they go there's no way you painted that and i was at a figure of
[43:35.160 --> 43:39.240]  speech like your joke no no i don't believe you painted that that that you're like a redneck i
[43:39.240 --> 43:44.280]  mean how did you pay you're from texas you people can't even you know wipe your noses i mean i just
[43:44.280 --> 43:49.320]  don't get like the yuppie thing where they're like all domesticated and they're scared of guns
[43:49.320 --> 43:53.560]  unless it's in the hands of the government and they they don't believe anything can be created
[43:53.560 --> 43:58.760]  or nothing can be done and they just kind of walk around all week i'm freaking out over everything
[43:58.760 --> 44:03.720]  and jealous of anyone who's successful i mean i just don't get it i want humanity to get off
[44:03.720 --> 44:09.480]  its knees and stand up i believe in humanity i think you're beautiful i think you're smart
[44:09.480 --> 44:16.360]  i think you have a destiny i know you do and i just do not understand how you bought into this
[44:16.360 --> 44:22.120]  idea that that that humanity is a bunch of crud yes we can do some horrible things true all right
[44:22.120 --> 44:26.120]  i'm done ranting i said i'd take phone calls we got so much news coming up i mean look at this i
[44:26.120 --> 44:32.040]  talked about this two days ago but now it's finally getting news coverage and i heard it
[44:32.760 --> 44:38.280]  on local radio station this morning they were like why would the cops be running federal checkpoints
[44:38.280 --> 44:44.680]  all over the country not just alabama where you pull up to one lane and they're there at a checkpoint
[44:44.680 --> 44:51.960]  and say mind if we take a blood sample because they've had these things before in texas i've
[44:51.960 --> 44:57.480]  driven into one where they use it to search your car and they see the scared person they direct people
[44:57.480 --> 45:02.600]  over because the public's so scared i mean if a cop said take your dress off most women would do it
[45:02.600 --> 45:06.760]  right there i mean you know i mean they say bend over and they put their hands inside of you now
[45:06.760 --> 45:11.400]  in texas i mean when you show you the video folks they say bend over and they take your pants off
[45:11.400 --> 45:17.160]  and ram their hand you know i i mean this is how america works now so they say and they sit there
[45:17.160 --> 45:21.800]  with needles taking your blood now and it's a federal program and no one knows why they're doing it
[45:21.800 --> 45:26.040]  they're doing it to acclimate everyone it's already an executive order that they're going
[45:26.040 --> 45:31.080]  to take blood at highway checkpoints i covered that in my first film 1997 people were like well
[45:31.080 --> 45:36.120]  where is it then they have they haven't phased it in yet because people aren't going along with it
[45:36.920 --> 45:41.400]  just like when they start i remember 15 years ago i saw the city council plan with the federal
[45:41.400 --> 45:47.960]  document because it was on tv on on on access you know they carry the city channel i watched it
[45:47.960 --> 45:53.640]  and they said we're here with this million dollar grant over the next three years to start
[45:54.840 --> 46:01.320]  big discounts and incentives for the newest above the current emission standards on the car
[46:01.320 --> 46:05.400]  and they said this will be used to prepare and acclimate the public for when the new federal
[46:05.400 --> 46:09.720]  regulations come out and then i went to one of the events to cover and they said yes we're here
[46:09.720 --> 46:14.840]  to condition the public and just like that sounds innocuous that's why they have helicopter drills
[46:14.840 --> 46:19.800]  and army checkpoints and do all this is to acclimate you they're going to pull you over
[46:19.800 --> 46:25.320]  and they're going to take blood from everybody and that's the stated plan but it's for your safety
[46:25.320 --> 46:31.400]  of course just like the government ships the narcotics in on record for your safety stop
[46:31.400 --> 46:36.680]  being chumps we have a bill of rights and constitution for a reason because anytime you
[46:36.680 --> 46:41.240]  let a government get big corrupt groups take it over and hell gets released
[46:41.240 --> 46:48.840]  cyber command said five years ago they're going to attack news sites in the u.s
[46:49.720 --> 46:55.000]  they're involved in psyops this whole thing is aimed at america folks the globalists have
[46:55.000 --> 46:59.400]  conquered america they're not in full control yet but they've conquered the federal government
[46:59.400 --> 47:03.160]  they've got a million reasons why they're doing what they're doing but they're carrying out agenda
[47:03.160 --> 47:11.480]  21 to bankrupt you and your family richard in idaho you're on the air first time caller welcome
[47:13.160 --> 47:16.200]  go ahead richard i'm not getting the audio from the network go ahead richard
[47:17.320 --> 47:23.400]  hey i've got a few points to make and i gotta tell you i'm a little this is no prank call i've
[47:23.400 --> 47:28.360]  listened to other prank callers call but this is not one of those i have a couple of points
[47:28.360 --> 47:31.560]  that i want to make first of all number one i'm gonna tell them i'm gonna put you on hold and
[47:31.560 --> 47:37.720]  put you on hold right now there's a phenomenon and we've not in started call screening because i
[47:37.720 --> 47:42.760]  kind of like that wild card thing where where people could just call in unless i'm talking about a
[47:42.760 --> 47:49.080]  specific topic but but i think we're gonna install call screening for one reason people want to be
[47:49.080 --> 47:56.440]  call screened and they get on the show and they do a call screen thing with me they tell me what
[47:56.440 --> 48:03.560]  they want to talk about sir richard you are on the air sir i want to hear from you make your
[48:03.560 --> 48:09.800]  point go ahead so a few uh several weeks ago you mentioned a name about a counterintelligence
[48:09.800 --> 48:16.120]  agent uh john loftus i believe his name is john christopher loftus he comes from odd in utah where
[48:17.320 --> 48:23.640]  where i actually come from um i believe that he's been used to gather intel upon who i am due to
[48:23.640 --> 48:28.840]  the fact of who my daughter is well sir again you say it's not a prank call i can't just have
[48:28.840 --> 48:33.480]  people come on my show and talk about a public figure saying you have connections to him send
[48:33.480 --> 48:38.680]  us the letters you believe he's gathered intel he's like a retired justice department lawyer
[48:39.480 --> 48:45.800]  that exposed that mi6 was involved in london bombings on fox news and the associated press
[48:45.800 --> 48:52.440]  and also wrote a book about ibm and the holocaust give me a moment please okay no i'm not gonna give
[48:52.440 --> 48:57.960]  you a moment i appreciate your call you've got to send me proof you say you believe he's surveilling
[48:57.960 --> 49:03.640]  your daughter i mean what i mean i i'm not in the business here of getting sued okay all right
[49:03.640 --> 49:09.160]  there you go and now i'll be a government agent because i did that i and listen i apologize to
[49:09.160 --> 49:17.000]  you caller if you've got some proof but i mean this is just wild let's talk to shane in pennsylvania
[49:17.000 --> 49:24.520]  shane you're on the air hey alex uh yeah i just wanted to make a point about what you're saying
[49:24.520 --> 49:33.240]  earlier about how they're trying to force this debate now between liberty and security and when
[49:33.240 --> 49:40.120]  you give up liberty you get tyranny you never get the security the the insecurity is letting them do
[49:40.120 --> 49:49.000]  this exactly and you know it's kind of an uphill battle because you know the general public has
[49:49.000 --> 49:56.600]  just been conditioned uh to accept this i mean you turn on the dark night and their heroes are using
[49:56.600 --> 50:03.160]  sonar and stuff like that to catch the bad guy well they're using the wireless system on the phone
[50:03.160 --> 50:07.960]  to broadcast and look through walls and pick up the thing which is what the connect in the smart
[50:07.960 --> 50:17.080]  meter does exactly everything is conditioning right and you know the villain in skyfall is just
[50:17.080 --> 50:24.840]  you know some hacker computer guy and it's just it's all over the place and the government's
[50:24.840 --> 50:30.760]  outgunned and doesn't even know how to open their email the poor babies the poor babies

[55:30.040 --> 55:37.240]  rule human genes cannot be patented and and that gives you some hope for sanity and i've scanned
[55:37.240 --> 55:44.120]  over part of the ruling i don't really see any loopholes in there i mean obviously they go and
[55:44.120 --> 55:50.040]  they get blood samples and stuff they even patent your particular genes but also the gene for cancer
[55:50.600 --> 55:55.240]  of a particular type and then try to block you from testing it monsanto has said you can't
[55:55.240 --> 56:00.520]  test those honeybees guts you know for our roundup pesticide because we have that patented
[56:00.520 --> 56:07.640]  and we have the gene mutation for the bt corn patented so we'll sue you if you try to test for
[56:07.640 --> 56:16.360]  our poison and courts have ruled for them that's that's asinine you like if they could patent cyanide
[56:16.360 --> 56:21.880]  and you can't test for cyanide at the autopsy because we have that patented you're not selling it
[56:22.520 --> 56:30.680]  so you should be able to test for it and it's just outrageous it is outrageous and this is some good

[56:51.720 --> 56:57.880]  to a lot of issues sure thank you you know there's a lot of talk lately about um this surveillance
[56:57.880 --> 57:03.480]  grid that's been created and i really think that they've been moving not just uh through surveillance
[57:03.480 --> 57:08.920]  but i think they've even moved they stepped it up a little bit to interference uh specifically with
[57:08.920 --> 57:15.640]  what you're doing um i use an application on my iphone to listen to your program over the internet
[57:16.360 --> 57:23.720]  when i'm driving in my car and whatnot and when i'm home listening to your program using this one
[57:23.720 --> 57:31.800]  particular application if i'm listening to it on my wi-fi it works just fine but as soon as i leave
[57:31.800 --> 57:40.520]  my house and go out into uh at&t's coverage with their 4g using the same program it gets
[57:40.520 --> 57:46.440]  scrambled and i lose my connection and i can't listen so i've tested this in a few ways where
[57:46.440 --> 57:52.360]  i listen to other radio stations or other radio programs i'll be listening to it on my wi-fi i'll
[57:52.360 --> 57:59.480]  drive out a range it will stay on it or it will it will reshuffle itself and buffer and go to
[57:59.480 --> 58:05.560]  either another server or it will keep playing but whenever i try to listen to info wars radio
[58:05.560 --> 58:11.880]  using this particular program over the at&t network i'm unable to well you know that could
[58:11.880 --> 58:16.120]  just be that we need to upgrade that those free apps we need people to make free apps for us and
[58:16.120 --> 58:20.360]  we i mean we we have limited resources we're trying to develop some new apps right now
[58:20.920 --> 58:26.200]  i'm sure alex seriously because it works just fine when i'm within my own network but as soon
[58:26.200 --> 58:33.880]  as i leave to go into at&t's 4g network it gets redirected to other servers no what i'm saying
[58:33.880 --> 58:39.000]  is it may not be meshing with that system uh well or or who knows they may be trying to block it

[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:51.480]  as well as his new book in general hami gul the former head of the muja hadeen against the russians
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.160]  can really give us an inside look at what's happening with the globalist funding al-qaeda
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:01:00.360]  worldwide and what's happening currently in afghanistan and pakistan and and mohammed carzai
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:04.120]  coming out a few months ago and saying the west is actually running al-qaeda of course that's
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:09.720]  always been known but not generally by the public who due to globalist propaganda cannot even find
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:15.720]  their own state on a map some cases much less the planet they don't know what a globe is i'm not even
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:21.480]  being sarcastic the icus are dropping very quickly under the chemical warfare operations the globalist
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:29.880]  jason in missouri uh you're on the air thanks for holding welcome oh thank you alex our first time
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:36.520]  caller uh i'm a yeah i was i'm a victim of katrina it took me at least a week for the army to show up
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:42.840]  um during that time um i don't watch any reality tv because i think the kardashians who cares how
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:49.320]  about the kardashians were some alien creature from star trek no they force feed you the culture
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:54.360]  they want you to think is the norm and people just grow up believing the tv loves them and
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:59.800]  it's going to help them yeah and the point where the mixture and i didn't want to take a lot of your
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:07.160]  time um i'm really upset about this force amendment with uh obama just walking all over it you know
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.800]  but i thought it was a conspiracy that they were spying on us without warrants i mean they care about
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:18.200]  us this is uh i cannot believe it it's ridiculous i mean you know you should be impeached you should
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:23.640]  be arrested and you should be prosecuted it's it's crazy but here's why you won't be because this is a
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:31.160]  long-term program before obama uh that is the military industrial complex basically swallowing
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:37.800]  the internet that this nsa rollout and cyber security is the takeover of the internet the
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:45.080]  ending of the free web and is basically beyond what the communist chinese have done yeah it's
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:51.640]  totally ridiculous i wanted to thank you again and uh i hope i get to call again sometime god
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:57.880]  bless you sir i appreciate your call but yes they should all be prosecuted and obama is pushing it
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:03.880]  and they're pushing a lot of web type initiatives that really kill freedom on the internet but i just
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:10.200]  had that re awakening that we've been talking about this so long that i tend to lay out the
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:16.120]  agenda and then not go back and explain it to new listeners the globalists are getting rid of the
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.160]  free internet as we know it they are forcing all networks over their systems to control content
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:27.800]  not just to surveil it this has all been announced and there are domestic cia spying operations and
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:37.800]  psi ops against the public that's all admitted in fake news and on and on and on we the the globalists
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:42.520]  are multinational they're waging war against everybody d in alabama go ahead you're on the air
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:52.760]  i had a few points i wanted to make one is i think that anybody that subscribes to like uh you
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:59.560]  know supports national public radio any of the print media that did not make any mention at all
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:06.440]  or have not made any mention at all of bill deberg the people that have you know subscribed to them
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:13.480]  need to cancel their subscriptions right to the news media or to the network and tell them
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:19.640]  that they have totally lost credibility and you will not financially support uh you know
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:26.680]  an organization that is hiding and being complicit with these uh criminals these international
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:34.440]  criminals so that's the one point i wanted to make another point is that anybody that's in
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:42.040]  the military that is out here helping them with their chem trailing and their anti-life agenda
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:50.040]  that has any inkling that they are a part of a compartmentalized process that is leading to the
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.560]  destruction i tell you what i got colonel shaper coming up but if you want to hold on come back

[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:29.720]  ladies and gentlemen we're now into the second hour thank you so much for joining us i'm your
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:35.560]  host Alex Jones the websites are info wars.com we also have info wars not only news seven o'clock
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:41.240]  every evening you find that at prisonplanet.tv we're going to go back to your calls towards the
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.400]  end of the hour for everybody that's holding and take some of those calls for colonel shaver
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:50.680]  because most of you're calling in on the whole Edward Snowden situation and what's happening
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:58.040]  with that but here's investors business daily reporting on what congressman stockman of texas
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:05.800]  said on monday on this broadcast that al-qaeda and muslims and and radical mosques are off
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:11.960]  limits of warrantless NSA spying but the tea party and the associated press and the american people
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.920]  we are the subject of it and what you're seeing is a total flip that i warned of 11 years ago
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:22.680]  of homeland security on to the american people returning veterans gun owners conservatives
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.160]  was a big boston globe article yesterday that we wrote about saying that they're training in
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:33.080]  boston for the militia bombing the next marathon basically with no proof of that
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:39.640]  because the enemy is the pro lifers the enemy is constitutionalist i mean that's a fact
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:44.040]  and it's even when democrats are out of power the republican leadership
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:50.120]  does not like constitutionalist okay it's that simple the checks and balances get in the way of
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:56.200]  the globalist corporate takeover and all these special interests now he's got a new book out
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:59.880]  we're gonna talk about that at the bottom of the hour and i can't wait to read it it's in a bohemian
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:06.280]  grove of all things we're going to talk about it but uh colonel anthony shaver is a bronze star
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.600]  metal recipient and as a cia trained senior intelligence operations officer and reserve
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.920]  arming lieutenant colonel with more than 22 years of experience the intelligence community and i'm
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:20.200]  going to go through his whole bio and university studies and deris but he um could have killed
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:25.720]  bin laden several times was ordered to stand down by the cia and then he exposed abel danger and
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:31.880]  stratus ivy the programs he was in uh and what was happening there he's got the new book out the
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:38.200]  last uh line we're gonna which is a total meltdown scenario for the u.s worst case scenario plan
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:43.160]  uh so people can actually think about this and talk about this what these guys do is end up writing
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:48.200]  fiction books like ian flaming so they can get stuff out there i mean i'm sure he won't say that
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.440]  but we'll see what shaver tells us i can't wait to read it the point is we ought to carry it
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:57.800]  the info or store but it's just now came out uh but the point i want to get to here with him first
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:03.880]  off uh is that we know shabelle admins came out it was an fbi translator with nsa communications
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:10.760]  saying look elements of the cia and contractors were in command of al qaeda on 9 11 and then after
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.720]  and they were running drugs guns everything hami ghoul is coming on next hour former head of pakistani
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:21.320]  intelligence led the cia war on record against the russians he says the same thing mohammed
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:26.680]  carzai comes out and says look these bombings that are happening are being basically orchestrated
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:30.840]  by corporate interests that want to keep a war going in afghanistan see we say it's the government
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:35.400]  it's not really it's elements that want no bid contracts for a 15 million dollar
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.600]  tarp that really cost five hundred dollars it's it's people that want to keep the gravy train
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:45.240]  going they want to have all these wars that are not in our interest okay and there's a lot of people
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.920]  in the government like colonel shaver that have spoken out against it now i don't want to put words
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:53.800]  in your mouth i've thrown out a lot of your setting the table but uh i want to get into
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:12:00.200]  first off since you were on what you make of carzai coming out and saying that uh what you make
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:05.560]  of the fact that the government has given a billion dollars to al qaeda and al qaeda affiliated groups
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:10.760]  that are leading the attack in syria and the aftermath of libya that you accurately predicted
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:16.280]  when it first started and where this is going and now the narrative where even ran paul comes out
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:21.240]  two weeks ago and says in the senate we shouldn't be funding al qaeda in syria they can't call its
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:26.840]  conspiracy theorist anymore where is that going how does it tie into snowden because people i respect
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:33.080]  think that he may have been fed a line of bull not that he's an operative of the chinese or
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:38.760]  something but he's been set up by other groups and that there's an internal agency fight going on
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:43.480]  so i've thrown a lot out uh colonel shaver but you're the guy to talk to who's had all the access
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:47.640]  to this over the years and is up there in the middle of fox news in the middle of the army war
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:53.160]  college and the pentagon uh of all those things i threw out there what do you make of it and
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:58.440]  where do you see this going well i let's break it down a little by little i agree with ran paul
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:02.760]  about funding the enemy and alex we've talked about this before you know there's a a great book
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:08.040]  well researched by dug we sing called funding the enemy and he you know it's not one of those
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:13.480]  things he's no conspiracy theorist he's a researcher and he goes through in painful detail talks about
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:20.120]  how we by sometimes stupidity sometimes kind of look in the other way go about funding the very
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:25.320]  people who are out to kill us is totally insane so when you put that with everything else going on
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:29.480]  and and i really admire the way you put it there in the beginning of your of your uh
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:35.240]  introduction uh look there's a real move of what to really kind of make us look the other way
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:40.120]  one of the problems going back to able danger you mentioned that was that we were prohibited
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:46.600]  from looking at the mosques and at the muslim groups because uh of certain three nine eleven
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:52.040]  concerns and of course we knew then alex they were using that system for command and control
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:56.680]  the they do not regard religion with the same reverence we do they actually use it as an
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:02.360]  operational tool and i have a severe problem with dhs within our own intelligence community
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:08.280]  where now they're trying to basically take out any reference to radical islamists or use anything
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.440]  relating to their religion as something that we should be concerned about because clearly i mean
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:18.280]  there are people who are sworn to our destruction and somehow now the focus is on conservatives
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:23.560]  so we we we as americans had to be very cognizant of that and i agree with you on the the the
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:29.640]  assessment of dhs uh dhs is something that i would if i were in charge get rid of immediately
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:35.160]  uh we don't need it we had us custom service before we had the fbi we had the immigration
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.920]  national day service that they all function pretty well not perfectly but pretty well
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:44.520]  without having a humongous bureaucracy known as the dhs on top of it so we we've got to be very
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:50.760]  cognizant of that then then you mix in this illegal essentially uh amalgamation uh vacuum
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:56.280]  cleaning if you will of information relating to us citizens 90 let me be clear for your audience
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:05.880]  here 99.9 at nine nine percent of all us citizens will never be never see never have any contact
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:12.840]  with a terrorist but yet somehow now it's been completely reversed and so the fact that nsa is
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:18.120]  doing this the fact that stoden brought it out i think it's significant and well and let me say
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.280]  something operationally while i agree with the representative sentin brenner uh i do believe
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:26.760]  he's sincere i do believe that he is saying that the patriot act was never designed to do this
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:34.200]  yet it is uh let me say something on the operational side having been uh at the at the cutting edge
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:39.480]  as one of the pioneers of using data mining the way they're going about it alex is is ensuring
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:44.040]  failure uh i don't believe for a minute keith alexander's comments in front of the congress
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:49.080]  yesterday that that that they have quote unquote broken up dozens of terrorist incidents that's
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:55.000]  not possible uh what they've done they're taking probably three billion i think about the three
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.600]  billion transactions a day very complex transaction a lot of data and yet what they're looking for is
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:06.600]  maybe ten maybe ten and so what they're doing by by doing it this way by doing this vacuum
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:11.320]  cleaning of these large amounts of data uh they're ensuring that they will probably never see those
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:17.080]  10 that they actually need and so it's totally reversed of what we did enable danger our job
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:21.720]  we knew was to protect the fourth uh the the the first four and fifth amendments to make
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:26.680]  sure that we did not violate that and we went in with very precise guidelines of what we wanted
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:32.120]  to get so in in the essence what we're looking at here is a government as far as i can tell
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:39.160]  what it is it's completely lost track of of who the enemy is and they're overfunded uh they have
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:43.800]  far more capability than the capacity that they have uh targets at this point and the targets
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:50.680]  are going after uh are not the ones which relates remnants expanding on that though i mean dhs day
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:56.360]  one started branding it to tea party constitutionalist you name it and now they have removed in the
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:03.960]  manual the word al-qaeda and things and put in their constitutionalist tea party it's absurdist
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:09.320]  that they've gotten away with this where are the congressional hearings and and what do you make of
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:14.520]  the two billion bullets and the seven thousand armored uh vehicles that i see driving around
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:20.920]  austin uh and the the new training manuals where they're saying we're going to fight the militia
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.480]  we're going to fight conservatives well i guess if they try to turn it into malsey tongue or
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:31.240]  something i guess there will be a civil war i mean are the crazy leftists really imagining
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:36.280]  they're going to have like some spanish civil war and we're the fascist and they're going to
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.760]  lock us all up because you've got things like main core out now in the mainstream news with
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:44.840]  eight million americans listed most of them libertarian and conservatives that have to
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:51.560]  be rounded up during an emergency i mean this is insane oh it's totally insane and i again i i don't
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:56.840]  i can't speak to the left's philosophy on it sounds like i have a few friends on the left but i
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.720]  really don't know how they think and the bottom line is this that the issue you bring up is very
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:11.400]  timely and important any civil unrest by necessity by tradition is held that is is basically dealt
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:17.400]  with by the local officials that is to say local law enforcement first if it becomes beyond their
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:23.240]  control you bring in the freaking national guard now i'm a former member of the ohio park uh and uh
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:28.760]  we spent time training for both civil support regarding riot civil support regarding natural
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:34.840]  disasters and so i'm appalled and i don't believe it's constitutional for fema to be expanding
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:39.160]  to the level it is regarding first responder type actions those really should be left with a state
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:45.080]  and obviously with dhs regarding civil control again i don't see how the and they always said
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:49.640]  they weren't doing that and it was a conspiracy theory now they're in the news with command
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:55.160]  and control offices and civil unrest and taking over government i mean is that not completely
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:01.320]  unconstitutional it is and again it goes back to the state level you know and ken kuchinelli is
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:06.760]  running for governor here in virginia and i've spoken to ken about this ken is a very you know
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:13.000]  very much a fighter against uh intrusion of the federal government because virginia likes texas
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.880]  is a very strong state we have a very strong economy uh we are considered more or less although
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:22.840]  we're kind of going purple we i think we're still a conservative state and these states really do
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:27.880]  say look we can handle things on our own you know you do have a national guard the national guards
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:35.560]  mission under title 32 uh the us code title 32 is to serve as the state's militia that is their job
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:40.280]  so what you may be seeing here like there really is a setup where you may see the federal government
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:45.960]  basically kind of uh trying to usurp those very capabilities which were designed to do civil
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:51.640]  uh uh unrest issues or you know any federal dictatorship kernel i want to talk more about

[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:18.680]  you're getting at here studying history studying the constitution tenth amendment
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:28.280]  seizure crossing the rubicon uh and what was it 40 something uh bc all of this it's basically the
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.360]  federal government getting on a war footing against the states and the people and then
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:37.560]  their training manuals and all of it read like science fiction or absurdist you know we we're
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:42.280]  going to fight the tea party we're going to fight tea party insurrections the army war college you
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:49.000]  know prepares for war in north carolina and simulations with the gun owners and it if they
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.720]  try to confiscate the guns or do something like that it is it it's an illegitimate move i don't
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:59.720]  want a civil war i'm not naive uh you're a combat veteran i know you're not naive colonel schaefer
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:04.760]  i mean you i mean is this not a war footing homeland security is getting on baiting and
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:09.320]  switching saying it was for al-qaeda now saying it's for us and you were telling me off air that
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:14.520]  you're in all these different government and other meetings than that people are pretty concerned
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:19.720]  and you were telling me that i guess is good news so what can you uh say about my statement that
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:26.040]  there's a war footing here being prepared a stockpiling for war and and i mean is it legitimate
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:32.920]  should we turn our guns in and worship mal satan well i think what we need to be cognizant of is
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:39.240]  it is why what is the justification for both the spending and focus i'm an intelligence officer and
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:44.280]  generally speaking uh you know i go with whatever the facts tell me uh you know if the facts are
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:51.000]  uh the boston bombers blow up people and they're trained or affiliated with al-qaeda then i i would
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.720]  suspect that that should be our focus uh i don't remember the last time that we've had a radical
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:01.000]  right conservative group blow up anything kill anybody or even make noises like it intends to
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:07.240]  you know you can you you know and so to me the idea that veterans and by the way there's a trying
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:12.920]  to put to disarm veterans certain veterans i know personally have been told to give up their guns if
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:17.800]  they want certain benefits so you know and i can't believe that's part of a part of a larger scheme to
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:24.760]  disarm people who um are considered conservative or former military it's totally insane so the
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:29.400]  question becomes if it's not based on intelligence instead of saying that the threat evaluations
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:36.840]  aren't there to justify the placement expenditure and focus of strategic resources you know
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:42.520]  national resources against the target then why why would they be doing this and this goes back
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:47.400]  to the irs thing now like so i mean you know why on earth the i i don't believe for a minute i mean
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:53.240]  you've been around a long time no low level civil servant is ever going to take on their own initiative
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:57.720]  to target a specific group or well they've been caught lying now it turns out they ordered it from
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:03.720]  the highest levels just like and they're persecuting the media there are a bunch of authoritarians i mean
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:08.120]  i mean if it looks like it walks like it quacks like it this is what it is so what do we do
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:13.960]  well the thing to do is be vigilant and i i would go to you know congress is the one funding all
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:17.960]  this this is one of those grand ironies i don't like people fully understand it's like the federal
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:24.120]  government as part of the executive branch can only function if it's given funding by the congress
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:30.120]  congress has the power of purse it was designed that way so what baffles me and i have a lot of
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:36.840]  conservative friends up on the hill is how somehow all this money keeps getting given to dhs another
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:41.880]  element to the government and by the way congress is the one who writes the laws for irs to function
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:47.080]  within how this all happened so really all roads despite the bad actions the executive branch go
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:53.640]  back to congress so again i just gotta ask people if they're really concerned to call their congressman
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:58.600]  buck the heck out of them because they're the ones who actually signed sure what do you make of
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:05.400]  these republicans but also bill marr the authoritarian leftist calling for snowden to be arrested and
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:12.040]  he's a trader you know executing disappearing that's been talked about i mean what do you make of
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:17.560]  is that congress scared that they've been part of allowing this to happen so they're covering their
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:25.000]  butt i think it's part of it i think that there needs to be some level of i think just reckoning
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.920]  regarding the whole silly situation i mean the fact is you know certain people cross the aisle
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:36.920]  on this issue certain people understand that what we're talking here uh let me mention one guy jeremy
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:44.120]  scale jeremy is on the left but he and i have shared an interest in accountability and actually
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:48.600]  asking hard questions about why are we doing certain things and then this is where again the
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.840]  expenditures don't make sense the focus doesn't make sense based on the fact that we have an
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:57.160]  external threat that we know about it's well identified as a tactics that continues to try to
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:03.320]  attack us and yet somehow we're we're now focusing inward and again it does not make sense from the
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:09.320]  third information i'm aware of nor the recent history of who's done attacks within the top
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:16.440]  middle united states folks the book is the last line you can get it at amazon lieutenant colonel

[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:29.400]  we're going to talk about that on the other side but first i'm going to ask him more about the
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:34.600]  strategy of funding al qaeda against syria and where he thinks that's going to go straight ahead
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:40.760]  on the other side i'm alex jones and this is the gcn radio network gcn live.com is the site info

[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:49.320]  what is it doing in the pentagon what is it doing with all your high level sources
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:53.640]  in national security because i know you're in there like nobody else we talked to to have it
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:59.960]  so cut and dry now that they're putting jihadis and al-qaeda in syria to commit war crimes and to
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:04.920]  have clinton pushing obama to do even more and then you know heat-seeking missiles have been
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:09.560]  given to al-qaeda what are they going to do when al-qaeda blows up airliners with this take more
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:13.480]  of my liberties i mean are people going to go to jail because you told me off air i want you to
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:17.640]  say it your own words that people are really waking up in government right now what can you tell
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:23.400]  us about that well first off there's a realization alexa you can probably figure all of our options
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:29.000]  for syria are bad i mean i don't want to get the details of it get me in trouble but uh there's
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.920]  people been fired over telling the truth to the white house saying look these these are the options
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:39.720]  we have and they're all bad and by the way getting involved directly it's just going to make things
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:44.840]  worse you know so the whole idea of arming these folks and let's be honest here there's
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:50.520]  clear evidence in my judgment that the libya consulate that was attacked on the 9 11 anniversary
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:54.520]  was very much involved in moving you know obtaining surface air missiles and other
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:59.560]  arms from the libyans and transferring it via the turks to the rebels in syria uh i just don't
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:03.480]  think it's in our interest to be doing that sort of thing based on the fact as you mentioned alexa
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:08.360]  chances are pretty good this all could come back and bite us someday as we've seen other involvement
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:13.480]  we've had other places so i think a lot of people on the inside who really think things through
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:17.640]  understand the folly of potential foreign involvement that's not to say we shouldn't do
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:21.160]  something to help i think there's always things we can do to help it's just we should not be the
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:27.320]  ones who put down and without you know without yeah but but i mean maybe you say help i mean if
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:35.320]  a sod is kicked out then the vacuum is jihadis that's like a hundred times worse hear me out of
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:40.360]  this alexa my think tank uh has actually said we do not want to see the central syrian government
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:45.240]  destroyed because the inevitable result of such destruction would be a failed state like we see
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:50.360]  in libya and again as you point out they would they would then have the jihadis at base of operate
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:54.440]  we're no no we agree uh it's just that we have you know this the Assad issue is something we
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:59.880]  have to deal with realistically but no we cannot afford to allow the central syrian government
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:04.840]  the thing which keeps that country together to fall because it will become a jihadi safe haven
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:09.320]  and as bad as it is in libya i believe the consequences of syria falling would be far worse
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:15.880]  well look at the new video out of the president of egypt in a meeting with the top ministers talking
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:21.000]  about how they're gonna attack america and israel i mean come on the military industrial complex
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:27.480]  wants to sell weapons and they're putting the next phase of crazies in so we can have wars with
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:33.000]  everybody and i can pay for it and you can pay for it and then and then the country goes bankrupt
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.960]  but why do the military industrial complex care they'll just sell weapons to somebody else well
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:43.560]  and i i can be i'm i work with the pentagon budget group that looks at spending and alexa let me
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:47.560]  tell you something larry corbin i were in a panel on capitol hill over this week i'm sorry late last
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:53.640]  week and it was packed with staff who actually did want to take on a serious look at how we can cut
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:58.360]  the defense budget because as you point out i think there's a propensity to get to jump in to do
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:03.080]  things without regard what we're trying to achieve what's going to cost us and how much will this
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:07.320]  you know any military action actually benefit the american citizens so i think this is something
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:13.000]  we ought to be concerned about is that you know we need to to step back from the overreliance
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:18.440]  and overuse of military force to achieve often dubious national security objectives which cannot
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:23.320]  be linked to a larger long-term global strategy wow we've only got about six minutes left with
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:28.600]  colonel schaefer let's get into the last line tell us as much as you can you were telling me that
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:33.640]  i mean obviously there's a lot of stuff you can't get into in a in a non-fiction book because the
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:39.240]  national security but you were telling me off air that this is pretty much a well what can you tell
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:45.480]  us about this well it's it's a worst-case scenario the last line is it focuses on the southwest border
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:51.720]  and bill keith my my writing partner is great researchers brilliant and so what we did and i
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:55.240]  was very reluctant to be through the book by the way i have my my publisher comes to me says hey we
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:59.960]  want you to do uh fiction it's like you know and now as you know this the book business ain't all
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:04.360]  that good i mean you don't make a lot of money off but you put a lot of time into it so um
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:08.360]  i reluctantly accepted the challenge they gave me kind of carte blanche of what i wanted to do
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:12.920]  and i said i want to do the southwest border and so what we did is we we actually took and did
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:17.880]  research on all the bad guys out there basically try to figure out a baseline of who who is really
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:23.880]  out there who's who are truly you know evil what's going on and we took the stuff going on and then
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:28.760]  combined it this if you will and do a compelling narrative where we we basically say what if what
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:33.880]  if this happens what if this happens uh to basically show that the border security which
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:37.800]  everybody seems to be not worrying about right now is something we should definitely be worried
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:43.480]  about and on top of that then we took uh me 20 it's basically the way i was 20 years ago chris
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:48.360]  teller no surprise the main character of the book is based partially on me and we took uh since the
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:53.560]  dods you know alex doesn't like me talking about actual things i did uh we took me about where i
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:59.800]  was about 20 years ago and and basically have taken uh you know my bad habits put them into the 21st
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:07.320]  century and it is very interesting time of challenge and then we throw a few other twists in uh i will
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:12.440]  leave it to your audience to judge for themselves if we were able to accomplish a a frighteningly
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:17.960]  real uh scenario uh my friend uh ralph peters uh at his blurboard actually calls it authentically
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:24.120]  chillingly authentic so i'd like to believe we achieve that and then when uh when you read it
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:28.840]  we met we put it we we want to make the reader know what it feels like to kind of be in the
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:34.120]  main character shoes so we want them to to kind of explain well you've sold me you've you've sold
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:39.080]  me on it give us give us some of the basic plot because i mean i know obviously you're getting
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:43.400]  into who real threats are and i haven't read the book yet let me just guess here's the problem if
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:48.920]  the west really does attack iran and is and and if iran is in danger of actually collapsing
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:53.480]  the mulas like hitler and their bunker are going to pull the trigger and they're going to trigger
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:58.920]  real terror sleeper cells that we know are all over western europe all over the u.s this country's
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:04.040]  totally infiltrated the chai comms might jump on board god only knows now let me guess is that
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:09.160]  what's in the book part of it is absolutely at his ball of doing bad things they basically find
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:13.800]  ways there's a reason they pretend to come do things here they lie to the drug cartel they
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:17.480]  co-opted the drug cartel and then they start expanding out what they're doing in the united
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:22.200]  states and let me add another thing there's riots in la but imagine that where we have other elements
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:27.240]  we just talked about earlier involved too so it's a it's a it's a poor it's a potpourri of bad things
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:31.960]  happening if you will and again i i we we tell it in such a way to make people wake up let me bring
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:39.720]  this up what could 100 what could 100 special forces trained troops do to america in one day i
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:43.960]  mean i know because i've studied it oh my goodness for people that don't know i mean you could go
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:47.480]  up the tops of buildings and i want to get into what you can do dumping into the air conditioning
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:51.960]  systems what you can do with fire i mean i mean i personally i would never do this but
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:57.480]  just studying history i mean i could i mean it's unbelievable what sleeper cells could do
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:01.800]  but yeah we we talk about asymmetric warfare which you know you talked about before and
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:06.040]  absolutely so i don't i don't give away the plot for the for everybody right now but let me tell
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:11.080]  you what you talk about is in there uh we we actually have a again very realistic very well
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:16.520]  researched plot uh that is based on real fact so we've taken things that have been in the media
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:20.200]  we've expanded upon it we've said okay if they do this and what if they do you know if they do
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:25.160]  X to note that what if they do Y and Z where would that all go and it ends up with a huge you know
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:31.400]  set of uh of catastrophes with the united states which i think we again we we do very realistically
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:35.560]  and in such a way that i think people are going to say oh my god that could actually happen well
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:40.360]  i'll tell you i haven't read your book yet but but all i what keeps me awake at night is these
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:46.600]  criminal mega corporations who would stand again from an authoritarian america who've already set
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:53.080]  up this police state grid who would then finance terrorist groups with several layers of separation
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:44:01.240]  to have actual radical stage stuff as a pretext to then bring in a soft martial law from which
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:09.160]  we never emerge and i actually see that as the real scenario of basically a false flag uh but
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:13.400]  a more complex false flag with more buffers because when i look at the constellation of
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:20.040]  homeland security setups the pre-programming the movies i actually see what you are talking about
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:26.600]  as a real scenario that criminal globalist elements actually allow to happen bare minimum
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:30.920]  to radically transform the united states i mean i'm sure you read rand corporation stuff
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:34.360]  i mean it's thinly veiled in there what in closing what's your take on that
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:39.080]  well i think they're they're clearly and i think in your particular appreciate the book because
[01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:44.440]  we actually do work in a conspiracy as you're alluding to we talk about the fact there may be
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:48.840]  elements in our own government uh and not our government and that you met you mentioned earlier
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:52.600]  it's not the government there's elements within the government there's people with agendas
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:57.880]  who will use the government for their own prox proximal reasons and so we do talk about that i
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:02.520]  think it is a realistic thing i think it happens every day uh a lobbying is a form of that only
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:05.800]  done officially i think there's other ways people may play the government use the government for
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:11.240]  their own purposes and i i i would i'm with you i think people don't fully understand how that the
[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:15.560]  government can be co-opted to do things against its own people's interests uh if certain certain
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:19.560]  incentives are provided to the to those inside the government well the book just came out last
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:24.520]  week i haven't read it yet but you told me bohemian groves in it so then i kind of connected dots off
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:29.640]  the storyline because there's really only a few real scenarios so i can't wait to read it because
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:34.120]  i know a lot of it's actually stuff that wouldn't get out there if it wasn't fiction uh but in closing
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:38.680]  give us a hint i mean don't give away too much because i'm going to read it uh about the last
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:44.440]  line with uh kernel entity shaffer and william h keith but but uh bohemian grove are they the
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:49.480]  bad guys or or something hatched in there wow something hatched in there yeah again you know
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:55.000]  i've seen i've seen you when you did the show on the bohemian grove uh i i don't want to say
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.400]  didn't influence our thinking because it did but just just be aware as you just point out there's
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:04.600]  certain elements of the government who may work against our own people's interests and it's tied
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:08.120]  into the bohemian grove i'll leave it at that for you to unbelievable i can't wait to have you on
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:14.760]  after i've uh read it kernel shaffer thank you so much uh for joining us all right there he goes folks
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:21.320]  wow uh again we we we set him up for the show like two weeks ago because i had to be out of town
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:26.040]  and he was coming on when the book came out and then i was quizzing him about what's in the book
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:31.160]  and it all just clicked that uh he's basically telling you what they might do in this book
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:37.800]  pretty amazing pretty amazing that guy tried to kill bin laden twice they had him in the
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:42.440]  sights were told not to uh that's on record and he can confirm what sable edmunds brought out and
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:48.600]  i can tell you i i've got pentagon sources that are good people other than shaffer who's also good
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:51.720]  they do they know what's going on they're not stupid they don't like what's happening
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:56.920]  and they really don't want to see america fall into authoritarianism and become incredibly poor
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:04.200]  and pathetic and then blamed for the new world order because that's the plan uh and it is very
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:08.520]  exciting to see this awakening happening uh you know he said on air there's a big awakening but
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:11.960]  he said i want to tell you i'm in a lot of big meetings uh well i'm not gonna even say what he
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:16.680]  told me off air because he didn't say it was off record but i've gotten in trouble with him
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:22.760]  particularly before i'm been gauzy when he said stuff to me off air but didn't say it was off record
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:29.400]  and then i kind of set it on air and then uh he got him in some trouble um so i'll just leave it at
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:33.000]  that and that's the problem you start talking to these people they'll tell you stuff i won't even
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.400]  say it's off record and then later they're like hey what are you doing saying that um that's why
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:44.200]  so many times i'm almost stuttering and gibbering here on air because i'm trying to like remember
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:50.120]  okay what can i talk about what can i talk about what can i say or somebody tells me something and
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:54.040]  says i can say it on record but then i think well that shouldn't be on record because that's
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:48:00.280]  going to get him in trouble like dav mustang he said all that stuff in a video interview uh about
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:07.240]  obama and you know staging uh the um you know shootings and stuff and a history of it and
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:11.960]  you know he was here visiting me because we're good friends my wife's friends with his wife
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:17.160]  and then he left and then i just didn't even tell him i just cut it out and people are like well
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:21.960]  that's censoring well i knew it would become a firestorm and i didn't want to hurt dav when i
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:28.040]  did the interview so it is it's true i i started censoring myself because that wasn't critical
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:32.440]  to get that out sure i got a bunch of visitors off of it if i would have put it out but i didn't do
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:39.080]  do it just for that uh and and then he went to a concert i think in like somewhere in asia i forget
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:45.320]  where it was um what's the big island nation singapore uh and then he talked about it and then
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:49.960]  it was you know they tried to destroy him with it and i just don't want to see my friends destroyed
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:56.600]  on my show i've learned that lesson with charlie sheen let me tell you uh i mean i've got videos
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:01.160]  with charlie and just all sorts of stuff the you know the media would just have a national field
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:06.920]  day with it guess what i did i said i got videos i actually came across them last week and guess
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:11.640]  what happened i mean it was none of it bad stuff it was just you know would be sensational deleted
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:19.400]  deleted it's just gone and and and what amazes me is that everybody's like wow why would you
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:25.000]  do that if that's that you know interesting stuff with charlie sheen because because that's not what
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.840]  i'm trying to do to people and and i think that's the difference between people that want to be
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:36.280]  honorable and people that are dishonorable is that they could care less and i'm always amazed
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:41.080]  that people that i led into my confidence not of anything bad i'm doing but things that's
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:49.400]  in confidence they like use that and then distort that and it's just the ultimate in scuminess
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:55.880]  is the point that i'm trying to get out here and so i don't even know why i'm going off into that
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:02.360]  it's just that spending so much of my brain power trying to not burn people is one of the most
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:09.400]  frustrating things in my life is just countless examples of it and i guess being a news editor
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:14.280]  wearing that hat as well as a journalist as well as a rabble rouser as well as a patriot it's a lot
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:19.960]  of hats to wear as well as businessmen researcher ad executive all of it that's why i get so
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:26.200]  scatterbrained on air is because there's a lot going on next segment d john walter jamie fred
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:31.640]  will get to all of you and this segment the next and then we've got general hami ghoul joining us

[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:59.880]  think that's funny i if i saw somebody at a mcdonald's putting poison in somebody's drink i'd probably
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:05.880]  break their nose and people like oh that's so i just don't get it i don't get laying here while
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:11.960]  we're robbed and assaulted and putting up with all this and i'm mad i'm not in a trance and i
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:17.160]  realize more and more that is important for all my failures folks getting angry getting people out
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:21.800]  of their normalcy bias is the secret and we've got to do it d and alabama thanks for holding i
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:25.960]  wanted to go back to you and then we'll get to fred and uh jamie and walter and john will get to
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:32.440]  all of you but go ahead to d you're on the air yeah uh alex what i was saying was that anybody
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:38.920]  that's in the military that has any inkling that they are participating in the geoengineering
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:44.360]  the chem trailing like you had that uh young lady that was on there that was in the military for
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:50.120]  nine years in the air force from tinker air force base if you have any thought that you what you're
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:55.960]  doing is killing life here you need to go and retire it's not worth the money you're killing
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:01.720]  your mother your father your kids yeah for those that don't know tons a week of barium salts
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:08.040]  aluminum dioxide and radioactive isotopes were delivered to be added to the jet fuel to then
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:15.400]  be aerosolized and sprayed out i mean the tons tons a week go ahead right so what i what i'm
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:23.400]  saying is you're not going to win when uh crimes against life are brought in ultimately you're not
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:28.520]  going to be able to hide behind the cover and say i was just a soldier doing my job that's what the
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:34.840]  nazis claimed it's not going to fly but if you get out now when you you know when the indictments
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:40.280]  are brought in you say yeah i finally figured it out and i knew what was going on and i decided
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:47.400]  the best thing for me to do was just you know to leave take my retirement take my pension
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:54.360]  you don't have to be a whistleblower because if enough people leave they won't be able to maintain
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:59.320]  this system of death and do i agree i think everybody should just start whistleblowing

[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:55.640]  pleasure to talk to you my friend hey um i'm gonna take us in a little bit different uh direction
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:01:03.720]  uh i don't go to many movies because in my opinion most of them are junk and tv tends to be even
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:10.760]  worse for the most part but uh i must commend you on your critique of oblivion for those of us
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:16.760]  who are awake absolutely right on it's all about compartmentalization it's all about
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:22.600]  becoming human uh you know even if it's just a program machine it's amazing it was great i
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:28.840]  actually walked out of there floating on a cloud of hope and all after watching it and
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:38.440]  i would add a show uh earlier in the month and like i said i don't go to too many
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:44.280]  but there was an old trailer from a movie i don't know if you heard of it called jango
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:49.480]  and when i saw this trailer it absolutely made me physically ill well it's meant to
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:54.040]  create racial division and i've studied history exactly i actually watched it i actually watched
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:57.880]  it to critique it and it was so disgusting i couldn't even critique it it's number one it's
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:03.960]  not historically accurate and and it's it's torture porn and it's race war porn and it's it's
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:08.840]  the globalists are desperate to play us off against each other right and all it was meant to be
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:15.720]  was psychological warfare designed to create civil unrest and it was nothing but that
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:24.200]  and and and i would not suggest to anybody to go see that just you know what alex if there was
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:30.200]  any african-americans in the theater at the time and there wasn't i noticed by the by the trailer
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:37.720]  was playing i would have got up and left that's all ashamed no i tell you it's you know it's all
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:41.240]  done why don't they do a movie about the un kidnapped little kids and torturing them
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:47.400]  all they do move oh no no no they want to go back 170 years and then misrepresent everything
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:53.320]  and then project it out but oh why don't they make a movie about them killing 52 of blacks
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:57.560]  before they're born oh no no no no let's no no let's just everybody fighting with each other now
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:02.520]  and then attach an agenda a big government to prove i mean here's an article right here
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:09.640]  more whites now dying mangled daily news than births and i saw people in the comments
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:14.280]  another article about this going good whites are the evil these are white people we all need to
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:19.800]  intermarry to get rid of the evil whites it's just evil people i mean you have african tribes
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:23.640]  that kill each other because one lives on one side of the river and the other doesn't or one
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:29.480]  worships this god the other worships that god it's all bull the globalists just use something
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:35.480]  to divert and distract people and and and it is a religion whites hating themselves
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:41.320]  is a religion and then doing whatever government says as it as the referee to prove that they
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:45.800]  think they're scum good points walter jamie in michigan another call from michigan you're on the
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:52.520]  air oh hey alex it's a violent it's good to finally get old you got about a minute brother okay well i had a

[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:26.200]  worldwide broadcast i am your host alex jones the news websites are info wars dot com prison
[02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:31.800]  planet dot com and prison planet dot tv we also have info wars nightly news seven o'clock central
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:38.520]  eight o'clock eastern five o'clock pacific six o'clock mountain and the website is info wars
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:44.920]  news dot com uh every time he comes on maybe once or twice a year he's very gracious to do that
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:51.640]  it's 11 o'clock at night over there in pakistan i get calls from cnn fox news you name it saying
[02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:58.600]  how do you get uh general hami gulag and i guess because they're aware of the show and know that
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:03.160]  we won't distort what he's saying and it's live they always want of course to tape interviews with
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:08.680]  me and stuff and i don't do it because i've seen them distort it um so it is a big exclusive to
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:15.480]  get general hami gul on the broadcast he's a lieutenant general hami gul a retired pakistani
[02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:22.200]  army general uh and known for uh heading the isi interservice intelligence pakistan intelligence
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:29.800]  agency uh during the soviet afghan war and leading the musha hadeen to victory and of course he's
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:35.400]  traveled the world and uh consulted here with world leaders in europe in the united states
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:44.920]  and the website is general hami gul dot com uh so people can check that out as well and he has
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:53.640]  exposed the fact that al qaeda as its modern permutation show is run by the west as a pretext
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:59.960]  to invade pakistan afghanistan to take liberties in the u.s in europe and now it's never been more
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:06.520]  naked when he was first on the broadcast six seven years ago there were a bunch of national
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:12.920]  international news stories saying it preposterous general gul is on that crazy alex jones saying
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:17.960]  al qaeda is run by the west when it was founded by the west uh for another purpose and then turned
[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:25.000]  into what it is today and now it's in the news senator paul two weeks ago said we're funding
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:31.400]  al qaeda in syria it's a you know it's a crime i had colonel schaefer on uh last hour from the
[02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:35.960]  pentagon saying it's wrong and most the pentagon doesn't like it and people are being fired and he
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:40.120]  said but i can't say more or i'll be you know basically brought up on national security violation
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:45.800]  charges but when the government's criminal it's treason to not go public so the point is there's
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:51.160]  a real moment of conscience here where our government the pentagon the rest of it realizes
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:56.600]  that a group of globalist criminals have hijacked the country so he's here to talk about how mohammed
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:03.480]  karzai has gone public and said al qaeda uh is uh bombing things here at the behest of the pentagon
[02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:09.880]  and the west and nato uh it's now all coming out so how does that affect things what does that say
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:16.200]  about the parasites that have basically gotten into the west mind and taken it over and uh where
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:22.600]  does he see this going with his uh his well-schooled and trained uh mind that has a lot of gravitas
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:27.880]  and he's well known worldwide is having a great grasp on you know the hidden geopolitical machinations
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:33.960]  so without further ado uh general hami gul joining us from pakistan via audio skype sure you heard me
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:39.480]  lay out some of the points there where do you want to go first uh in what i brought up or
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:47.640]  are there other points you'd like to make well uh i would want to start from c because i think it is
[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:57.560]  no more a secret that the rest is supporting them uh the the rebels of the al qaeda uh fighters are
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:12:05.800]  being supported fully and what is more that perhaps the chemical weapons are being used by
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:13.640]  the operators of al qaeda rather than by the government of uh mabashara lasad uh there is a
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:20.040]  suspicion in my mind and there is some evidence that because the i heard some voices and then
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:25.880]  after that those voices were choked uh obviously the west doesn't want to get into this mess
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:34.600]  but obviously kazai is the first voice who has said that al qaeda is being used by the west
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:42.760]  both in afghanistan and in syria but i will go beyond that and say that today's were used in
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:52.520]  dibia as well as in tunis in india for instance there was a man of who was adding the rebel forces
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:13:00.920]  in dibia supported fully by the west and he was the younger brother of abu yaya al liby a famous
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:08.120]  al qaeda leader who was killed here by don't attack in pakistan he was perhaps number two after
[02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:18.920]  aminal zawari in al qaeda hierarchy and i know a lot of people now who are running the government
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:28.280]  in dibia because france simply wanted to uh get the oil to be an oil to chill their industry
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:35.160]  and uh they thought it convenient that al qaeda could be used for this purpose but i think it
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:43.720]  exposes the dichotomy the hypocrisy in the western mind that on the one hand they treat al qaeda as
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:51.160]  a terrorist organization and they they are waging a war and what george bush had once described in
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:59.240]  60 countries this war is to go on they have turned the world upside down the american economy has
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:06.200]  gone overboard it is in such quandary that i think it will take decades to come out of it if at all
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:15.960]  it does and it is it has taken away the moral high ground that america wants to enjoy it has
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:23.720]  exposed the military might of america badly and all this war against terrorism has actually turned
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:32.840]  upon america in a very very big way in a negative way and now it is kazai their ally their puppet
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:41.320]  who is talking so openly and he says that it's not only the occupation of afghanistan
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:49.880]  uh which is a bad enough crime but i think it is also that al qaeda is being used to bomb and it
[02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:56.680]  is being financed indians are fully involved in it as far as pakistan is concerned i know
[02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:02.360]  because each one is trying to grind their own axe and they think that if pakistan is
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:09.080]  somehow given the title of a failed state then they will have a strong case to say that pakistan
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:16.760]  must not exist uh must not possess the nuclear weapons and the israeli lobbies and the indian
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:23.560]  lobbies are now uh fully riding on the neck of the americans on the back of the americans
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:32.520]  but unfortunately obama has turned out to be a weakling he is has been a very weak president
[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:40.920]  he is gutless he has courage he cannot stand up to the pentagon and its generals he cannot
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:48.760]  stand up to the new cons this is his problem he can't even do a small thing like close the
[02:15:48.760 --> 02:15:56.600]  gontanamambay camp that prison is still there although five years ago more than five years ago
[02:15:56.600 --> 02:16:03.640]  he promised that this would be closed so if this is the situation this is a bad omen for america
[02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:10.280]  in the future and the future generations of the american people now being specific again um general
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:15.960]  hameed gul lieutenant general the former head of the isi former head leader of the mujahideen uh
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:20.600]  with the cia and others that were able to bring down and defeat the soviets who were undefeated
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:26.280]  he joins us now when you were first on seven years ago but then on again last year and many other
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:31.720]  times you you laid out what was going to happen you pointed out they're running the bombings in
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:39.480]  afghanistan they're running al-qaeda uh in pakistan and you explained they have them bomb things so
[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:44.360]  they have an excuse to come in with drones to then bomb the villages to stir people up to
[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:49.880]  destabilize and the non-military mind goes well why would people running america run al-qaeda
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:55.560]  it's simple you run al-qaeda as the reason to be there to control the opium and have the no-bid
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:17:03.160]  weapons contracts as a cash cow which then bankrupts america but makes these multinational
[02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:08.600]  corporations incredibly rich and now that's all mainstream news so i'd like you to speak how big
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:14.040]  a deal is that the muhammad qarzi the president of afghanistan people that don't know came out a few
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:19.000]  months ago and said these bombings are done by al-qaeda and the west as an excuse to stay here
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:23.720]  now i don't just believe him i went and looked at the evidence that that's what it was uh and that's
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:30.360]  what you've said so what does this signify to have him going public at pentagon generals being
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:36.680]  fired because they're going public uh i mean this looks like almost a collapse of this agenda because
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:43.320]  they didn't want this out in the open general so what does this mean geopolitically why geopolitically
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:49.960]  it means that american have have been completely washed out and they uh unless they quickly achieve
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:57.560]  a clean break uh they will cut away sorry figure because i think this is an axiomatic principle
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:07.720]  of war that once you are defeated and you must break away immediately cut off and run from their
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:13.880]  scoot from there and do so gracefully if you can but unfortunately the way they have chosen
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:22.120]  them because the security contractors and there are no less than uh hundred and five thousand
[02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:28.920]  security contractors now employed in afghanistan they are all the old hands of the ci and the fbi
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:34.200]  and various other agencies and the cronies of some of the people who are running the show in america
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:40.600]  so obviously it's big money involved for them and then there is opium trade which is worth more than
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:49.080]  five billion dollars in raw form 92 percent of the world's total raw opium market is now being
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:57.560]  provided for by the by the afghan trade opium trade and it is happening right under their nose
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:04.120]  and i'm afraid the some of the military aircraft have been used for this purpose because uh it is
[02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:12.680]  not possible we know that there was a time when we have great halls of these narcotics in pakistan
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:18.680]  but for the last six or seven years there are no big halls so where are they going which route
[02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:25.160]  are they taking obviously rand they cannot use as a route pakistan is not being used so what is
[02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:30.680]  the route it is the aerial route which is being used and it's going to europe it is going to america
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:36.280]  itself and what it what it's ready to be able to in order to make money they are spoiling their
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:44.520]  this is a precious to say the least and what karahi is saying is because he's frustrated now
[02:19:45.160 --> 02:19:50.760]  and but he cannot reverse it it is now at this stage well lieutenant general google we're going
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:55.160]  to come right back to you sir to finish up this mom shell thought he's saying the only drug route

[02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:10.200]  all right my friends this is a short segment long segment coming up with lieutenant general
[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:17.320]  hami ghoul you have to understand he's probably the most famous general the last hundred years
[02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:24.840]  in central asian history not just pakistani history very successful across the board
[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:30.920]  fighting the russians that i don't know probably had 20 times the firepower from some of the statistics
[02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:37.400]  i've seen some cases a hundred times and was successful and then in the last decade while
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:42.280]  he's seen afghanistan and pakistan encircled and destabilized he's been saying why are you doing this
[02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:48.520]  when he'd been an ally with the united states in the west and what i've found is i research
[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:53.000]  this stuff all the time but i'm not a military trained man like him he was a successful wartime
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:25:01.320]  general in that war but a successful commander in the cashmere war with india if memory serves
[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:06.440]  in frontline combat and when he comes on what he says ends up happening a year or two years later
[02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:11.960]  i mean he's not selling you an agenda he cares about his country i have him on and respect him
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:16.200]  because i know he's just telling you the truth and the truth is always the best way to go
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:21.720]  sure he has a bias towards not wanting his country overthrown and their weapons stolen
[02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:28.360]  and and destabilized but i've looked geopolitically for my family it's good to not have pakistan
[02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:32.680]  you know be turned over to a bunch of radicals now now this is a short segment general and i've
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:37.080]  taken time and talking about who you are i just want the audience to get that you know what you're
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:42.920]  talking about so so you're saying the west is there for opium and contracts i have family
[02:25:42.920 --> 02:25:48.920]  in afghanistan right now in the army who fly around picking up contractors that are blown up all day
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:53.640]  on the side of the road uh the helicopters are getting shot up the losses are being covered up
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:59.560]  i wasn't told that by the family i have that from separate sources but how bad is the route right now
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:04.360]  and if the lobbyists are paying off the politicians uh to just keep people there
[02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:10.360]  they're still a breaking point with i guess americans and contractors hanging off skids
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:15.960]  like saigon in the in the mid 70s i mean where does this end as a military man who knows this
[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:24.680]  region like no one else alec i think this is uh worse than weight norm i think uh the stakes
[02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:31.160]  are much higher for those people who are involved in making big money uh i think they have to be
[02:26:31.160 --> 02:26:38.840]  a new commission set up by the american citizens who will probe into the properties which have
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:44.120]  been purchased recently the waterfront properties and a lot of money which has been accumulated in
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:50.760]  swiss banks and elsewhere and you have to look into it to who made all this money the trillions
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:59.160]  of dollars which have been pilfered out of this and that core of engineers of which is a despicable
[02:26:59.160 --> 02:27:06.600]  thing for me as a soldier to think about that core of engineers u.s core of engineer is actually
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:16.440]  getting graft up to 25 percent they get false uh receipt signed by the contractor the road is bad
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:23.320]  which they build the bridges are blown up on their orders they want those bridges to be blown up so
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:30.680]  that they can be reconstructed and more money can flow into their pocket so this has corrupted the
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:37.160]  american people and and the longer they stay the more damaging it is going to be for the american
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:44.440]  people for their care a whole nation's character wants a very proud nation it is a proud nation
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:52.360]  even today i would say one of the greatest nation unfortunately what is being done to it by a handful
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:28:00.920]  of people who are selfish and vicious and they would stop at nothing to make money so i will
[02:28:00.920 --> 02:28:09.240]  also comment upon the generals who fully know that this war has been lost but even then they will not
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:18.200]  stop at sacrificing the boys and girls of their own nation for what their interests are and because
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:22.920]  they are so arrogant some some of them are not corrupt but they are very arrogant they think
[02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:28.600]  that we cannot be defeated but the fact is that they have been defeated very badly and all their
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:37.640]  choices are to go out gracefully or to be disgraced and have their noses rubbed in the hard file of
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:45.000]  Afghanistan this is the choice on which we stand today unless they realize this that we have made
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:52.040]  a mistake and they are they curtail their agenda and they do not fall under the influence of those
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:58.680]  people who want to how to make money there there is going to be an embarrassment embarrassment for
[02:28:58.680 --> 02:29:09.640]  america why 2014 if you have lost the war already and it has been known that 2009 that this is an
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:18.120]  unwinnable war then why take five more years at least they and yet generals who are saying no we
[02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:25.240]  must stay on why do you want to stay on because there are contractors who are building up the
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:32.280]  basis there in in the front islam and they are they say that well we have been awarded the contract
[02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:36.600]  and they're still planning to stay absolutely stay there we're gonna come back and look at that in
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:41.800]  the bombshell you dropped you're saying the west and there's proof of some of this is bombing our
[02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:47.800]  own troops as a pretext to keep them there unbelievable we'll be right back stay with us

[02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:38.280]  you know we tend to think of this as america and the west versus the muslims and that's how
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:43.480]  the media tries to sell it the truth is if you look on record and i had lieutenant kernel entity
[02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:47.960]  schaefer on earlier he's been part of the unit hunting bin laden wasn't allowed to kill him
[02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:57.000]  because he was a cutout there are powerful global corporations that have made the last
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:02.200]  number i saw was something like seven trillion dollars the last 11 plus years in these wars just
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:09.960]  unbelievable and the ripoffs and the scams and all of it and then i talked to family and i talked to
[02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:15.160]  mercenaries i know and people and they go oh i know the government one group of it funds al-qaeda
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:19.240]  and some of the taliban and i understand you know now there's some of the other tribal groups it's
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:24.680]  more of a grudge match and they're mad at people in their country but whatever you know i just like
[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:32.360]  to kill people and i'm gonna talk about my family so much or maybe i am the point is the point is
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:37.160]  they just like to fight and i guess the afghans like to fight too it's their country but this is
[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:41.400]  insane but a lot of these people have been in two three four tours and don't want to fight
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:46.120]  and they're sent back even when their foot's been blown off they put prosthesis on them and
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:52.040]  make them go uh over there uh and then meanwhile these corporations sit back and make trillions
[02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:57.720]  of dollars of our taxpayer money and this is immoral now mohammed carse comes out and says the west
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:01.480]  is blowing stuff up and funding al-qaeda that's on record but there are other tribal groups and
[02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:05.400]  nobody knows them better than general gul who could well the only guy they could go in and
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:09.480]  manage them all and focus them against the russians and he pointed out i mean in pakistan
[02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:12.760]  tried to come in and take over afghanistan they probably couldn't do it and they share a lot
[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:17.480]  of cultural heritage i mean he can correct me if i'm wrong maybe pakistan could no one's ever
[02:35:17.480 --> 02:35:22.600]  conquered them so there's no way the west in my view and the war planners really thought they
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:27.880]  could go beat these people they just wanted to go in and have the perfect endless war because
[02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:32.440]  they're not thinking about american interest they're not thinking about that they want why are they
[02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:36.680]  putting radicals in all these other countries they want the next war general do you agree or
[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:40.920]  disagree with what i just said because your audio was breaking up a bit people may have missed it
[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:46.360]  that i hear you correctly say that that that there are groups being funded to blow up contractors
[02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:51.720]  and troops not just to blow you know try to blow up the central government and that i mean what
[02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:58.280]  percentage of the resistance against the west is actually being funded by the west as a pretext
[02:35:58.280 --> 02:36:05.080]  to stay there from your research general uh gull there there is a addict for the for your audience
[02:36:05.080 --> 02:36:11.560]  i want to clarify one thing that there is a genuine al-qaeda uh they're no doubt about it that was a
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:18.440]  reaction to what america was doing and their own countries which were under the tutelage of america
[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:25.800]  were actually doing so that those people came in and they had gathered in afghanistan that's true
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:35.320]  but then immediately the cia created their own al-qaeda and that parallel al-qaeda or parallel
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:42.840]  faliban as far as pakistan is concerned they are locations of america themselves and unfortunately
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:48.760]  the british are fully involved in this the other european countries have kept a distance but the
[02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:56.040]  british are and the americans together they have been playing this game for a long time now but this
[02:36:56.040 --> 02:37:02.520]  is a very dangerous game because they know that afghanistan has never been conquered it has been
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:08.920]  known as a graveyard of the superpowers and yet another superpower is getting buried there
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:16.280]  it is still time to achieve a clean break but unfortunately as i said those greedy people
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:23.160]  who are running the show and who are filling the pockets of the people who are the decision makers
[02:37:23.800 --> 02:37:30.840]  they would not let them break away while any logic any reason any rationale would suggest
[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:38.120]  that they must go away as quickly as possible now going out of afghanistan the only release
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:47.240]  loan is pakistan they can't go towards iran they cannot go towards soviet union to the the russia
[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:53.080]  because tutan is at loggerhead with them he is very happy and he will not allow the northern
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:38:01.080]  network as it is called euphemistically it's not going to work but pakistan is also being targeted
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:08.120]  why is pakistan being destabilized on purpose when this is the only relief loan for you this is a big
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:16.200]  question it means only one thing that the israelis and the indians more particularly the israelis
[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:22.120]  would never rest in peace unless pakistan is brought to a status of a failed state
[02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:29.080]  where pakistan can be universally declared as a state which must not possess nuclear weapons
[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:39.240]  so i think american policymakers are playing in in two different hands one is the fear of
[02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:47.640]  fear and ambition of america and is and the sorry the the indians and the israelis and the other
[02:38:47.640 --> 02:38:55.960]  is the greed of the multi so these two factors put together are going to destroy the future of
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:39:04.520]  the american people they will have to go back to isolation they are using drones as soon as our new
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:12.600]  government after a very handsome turnout by the people from spite of said from the caliban the
[02:39:12.600 --> 02:39:20.440]  caliban of pakistan that they would attack any polling station any number of polling stations
[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:28.120]  but people of pakistan turned out in huge numbers and as soon as democracy was established within
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:34.280]  two days there were a drone attack because the prime minister at that time prime minister elect
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:42.120]  namaskarif had said earlier on that he would engage the caliban in talks so that this turmoil this
[02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:49.720]  bloodshed in pakistan ends that means america is not being friendly to the very country that they
[02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:54.360]  need so much for their withdrawal all right well let's be specific general because your your audio
[02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:58.200]  is breaking up just a little bit we may try to reconnect here in a moment joining us via audio
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:04.680]  skype from pakistan lieutenant general hami ghoul who headed up the victory against the russian
[02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:12.280]  occupation of afghanistan let me ask you this question then specifically uh what do you expect
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:16.520]  because you've been very accurate the last seven years coming on and we appreciate that what do you
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:22.840]  now expect to happen as multinational corporations want to make all this money the israel lobby
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:27.480]  doesn't want you to have nuclear weapons that you already have uh india for whatever reason you
[02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:35.080]  know has some problems with pakistan longstanding uh rivalries where do you expect us to go if it's
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:43.960]  on record the so-called war occupation is failing uh then how long will this go on how will this end
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:48.760]  because as you said they're building more bases i don't think they're leaving in 2014 they always
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:53.640]  say they're leaving they didn't really leave iraq they've got you know troops and bases there i mean
[02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:59.400]  how do you expect this to end how do you expect uh syria to end how do you expect i mean because it
[02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:05.080]  looks like the globalists are just saying you know hey let's make money but the military knows it
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:12.440]  cannot even carry this out but as far as south asia is concerned i think china is the net gainer
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:19.080]  and they are again in a quiet way they've already got hold of the other port from pakistan because
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:25.720]  pakistan was so much beleaguered and so angry with america that they handed it over to the uh almost
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:34.600]  for a song uh to the chinese so chinese are going to be sitting on the gullet of the western economy
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:41.400]  which is because no nearly 50 percent of the oil flows through that area and chinese will be right
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:49.960]  there on top of it so uh chinese are coming in and chinese pakistan and future of ranistan together
[02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:56.520]  is going to be a big problem for america and the west and their dream of going reaching out to
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:02.920]  central asian oil reserves and the markets in the future and the mineral reserve is going to end up
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:12.520]  in a disaster so i don't think this is possible as far as syria is concerned syria is again
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:22.760]  the it's a it is becoming a shia sunni problem unfortunately and the people of halkaida they
[02:42:22.760 --> 02:42:29.960]  are operating there but they are not obama is very tentative when you are tentative in a war which
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:36.120]  is very important for your interest this is not going to help that means it's a disaster you
[02:42:36.120 --> 02:42:42.920]  don't know what you want to do your mission is not clear so if you are not helping them slowly
[02:42:42.920 --> 02:42:52.280]  gradually basharov along with help from uh isbulla is going to get back and take control
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:59.720]  of whole of syria and then iraq will be in trouble in future so this middle east will remain for a
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:07.160]  while the battle ground and here the russians have big stakes and russian people is supporting
[02:43:07.160 --> 02:43:15.160]  is sending s 300 anti missile missiles so this this this is a big development is absolutely
[02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:20.200]  so now russia this is so correct me if i'm wrong what the globalists have done acting against
[02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:25.880]  western interest is they're driving former ally pakistan into the hands of the communist chinese
[02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:30.600]  which pakistan was leery of your guys aren't communist but you've been driven into their hands
[02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:35.240]  and now russia is coming in as the good guy it's almost like the people running america
[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:39.720]  want to destroy us because if you look at it there's things bigger than just money they are
[02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:45.560]  destroying our name they are they are empowering russia and china and they are destroying american
[02:43:45.560 --> 02:43:50.360]  interests and that's why i've been told by high-level pentagon sources way above tony schaffer
[02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:56.520]  generals former top cia people that they're all upset that these multinationals are doing this
[02:43:56.520 --> 02:44:03.000]  because geopolitically uh... they are really why are they doing this this is insane
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:12.760]  yes indeed it is that because i think they don't have a very clear vision they lack the vision
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:18.760]  they have no grand vision of the world for for tomorrow this is the problem that they are my
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:25.160] opic and they are looking to their immediate interest and and a lot of people want personal
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:31.960]  glory like uh... general patriot for example he was looking for when he was asking for surge
[02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:38.520]  and he got it three thousand three thousand more troops in afghanistan which was an utter failure
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:44.120]  but it was quite easy because he thought that he would be able to run for the presidential election
[02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:49.720]  and he will get a name for himself if these are the objectives of the top people
[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:54.280]  that means they are not looking to the interests of the nation they are like you're looking at
[02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:58.840]  their personal interest this is selfishness of the highest order and because of that
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:03.160]  a lot of problems creep in a lot of flaws in the policy making creep up
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:10.760]  uh... general again uh... general hamed gul's joining us via audio scott we probably should
[02:45:10.760 --> 02:45:15.640]  have done phone it's better at times worse at times but this is such riveting information
[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:20.840]  if the audience can make it all out uh... i mean this uh... what you're saying is the truth i mean
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:27.480]  it it's not hidden and so the pentagon knows this and and other geopolitical strategists know this
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:34.120]  uh... i mean do you think they're really going to leave in twenty fourteen next year uh...
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:40.040]  uh... i think they will try to get their feet but unfortunately it is not going to
[02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:46.760]  uh... happen in that way because i know as a military man and i think those people among
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:52.040]  your audience who i have had any knowledge of the military they would understand that there are
[02:45:52.040 --> 02:45:58.280]  three important factors time space and relative strength which determine the outcome of any
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:05.160]  conflict on the battlefield now in this particular case if they have lost the spaces and their
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:12.600]  relative strength is reduced only two firepower which they have which they can initiate from
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:20.440]  anywhere uh... from from the seas or even from their b1s and b2s can fly out directly from
[02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:26.840]  america and come and bomb places uh... but if they want to stay here that that means they will be in
[02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:33.960]  fortress defense the spaces will be on somebody else's control a hostile population a hostile force
[02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:40.360]  which is not afraid of fighting and which is not tired of fighting then the factor of time is very
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:47.640]  important afghan say that time is on our side we possess the time and americans possess the watch
[02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:53.800]  so the factor of time is entirely on their side so this is the issue which has to be
[02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:59.480]  settled militarily but it's like but it's like england when they tried to occupy scotland for
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:05.400]  500 years they could never do it because the people never submitted isn't the key resistance
[02:47:05.400 --> 02:47:10.920]  and that even the people don't even have weapons if they don't comply and just resist you can never
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:19.240]  occupy someone all right you are alex i am a student of military history and there is not
[02:47:19.240 --> 02:47:25.560]  one example that i can quote to you where a nation has been defeated by invading armies
[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:33.880]  it is not possible armies but armies cannot defeat nations and that's why globalism tries
[02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:39.720]  to get rid of national sovereignty and nationalism because they want to conquer us with this corporate
[02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:44.440]  evil and and that's all they're doing they're picking off every nation one at a time and they've
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:50.040]  already picked off america but if we ever reawaken as americans and go back to being the good guys
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:56.760]  this evil will vanish very quickly but if we go down this dark path general gul uh what how
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:48:01.960]  where do you see america england israel all these countries uh ending because you can see
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:09.080]  the whole world is turning against us because we have been occupied by criminal groups yes yes
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:15.240]  indeed there is a cavity inside there's a hollowness inside which needs to be addressed before uh
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:21.080]  addressing the external issues and obama had made that promise and that's why he was given the peace
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:27.160]  pride noble prize for peace but unfortunately he has not come up to the promise so it is a
[02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:32.920]  receding power the western power is a receding power and i think you need to go back and read
[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:39.320]  a paul kellydy once again the rise and fall of the western power where he described western power
[02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:47.000]  and fine power it has only one way to go and that is downhill but that it will go downhill so fast
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:53.800]  because of the stupidity of the american leadership it nobody could have ever imagined so it's a
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:49:00.120]  receding power it is going back it is shaking and i think the pendulum of power is shifting elsewhere
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:06.200]  yes and the globalist who moved all their power bases to china kissinger and others
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:11.560]  and are moving our factories there they actually want that and they're sucking us dry while they
[02:49:11.560 --> 02:49:19.560]  destroy our name and they moved to china i don't think there is a design behind that they are not
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:24.280]  doing it on design they are doing it because simply they are greedy they want to make money
[02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:32.280]  this is the problem with capitalism and capitalism is eventually it goes on self-destruct it destroys
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:38.120]  the very society in which it thrives in which it flourishes but eventually it ends up in destroying
[02:49:38.120 --> 02:49:44.760]  that society when you let criminal combines get together uh what economic system do you like general
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:53.320]  gull while a flat taxation i think uh c4b that at one time said the economic system that we need to
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:50:01.640]  follow bottom model economy is one way to go and if you don't like that then there has to be taxation
[02:50:01.640 --> 02:50:08.120]  which has to be flat 80 percent of taxation are made in america and pakistan in any other country
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:14.440]  which is following the western model or adamsis model it comes from the poor people and that's
[02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:20.360]  why poor are becoming poorer and rich are becoming very rich in america it is the worst because
[02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:27.160]  there are only a handful of family probably two two dozen families which control the lot of wealth
[02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:33.080]  more than half the wealth of america or perhaps you may have even better figures about it so
[02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:38.680]  well your thing is we need we need fair taxes where the where where because yeah the billionaires are
[02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:43.000]  exempt and they put the taxes on the middle class making us poor i want you to quantify that when

[02:54:09.320 --> 02:54:13.880]  obama using the irs to target christian and conservative groups and pro-life groups
[02:54:15.080 --> 02:54:20.440]  the irs on record saying if you're a christian don't pray uh it's just our country is being
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:24.600]  turned over to pure evil and i was talking to general hamed gul about economic systems and he
[02:54:24.600 --> 02:54:30.360]  was saying islamic system uh explain us explain does that system because i've seen that scene
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:34.920]  as kind of a free market it's been described from what i've seen as a layman it's kind of a capitalist
[02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:40.680]  system but maybe i'm wrong describe to me the islamic uh economic system from your perspective
[02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:48.600]  i think economic system has two ingredients in it one is that there is a tax rate tax on
[02:54:48.600 --> 02:54:57.240]  production uh straight away because in case in case of crops etc or anything that you produce you
[02:54:57.240 --> 02:55:05.400]  take in commodity or you take in cash and on accumulation if you build a huge big house and
[02:55:05.400 --> 02:55:11.800]  you need to pay tax on it and to the extent that poor people can have a roof on on their head
[02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:21.240]  uh the second aspect of it is interest free loan loan but now the loan is uh full of interest
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:26.200]  and can you imagine that american people can get anything they want but they have to work
[02:55:26.200 --> 02:55:32.760]  they've actually get enslaved because of that the the flavor of life is lost for them they
[02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:39.080]  keep on working their back off all their life in order to pay back the loan now that is
[02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:46.680]  the islamic islam does not say that you should enslave anybody because of the fiscal system
[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:55.160]  that you have created so really there is no freedom when you think that you actually are owned
[02:55:55.160 --> 02:56:01.960]  by your you become the slaves of the multinationals or the big companies or the corporate well i guess
[02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:07.720]  the federal reserve to themselves they give themselves free uh money interest free so i guess
[02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:11.720]  the new world order actually follows the islamic system but only for themselves
[02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:18.520]  yes indeed but it has to be for the rest of the world now we have to look at western democracy
[02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:23.960]  also after all the gift of colonization was western democracy slave trading was western
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:31.720]  democracy big the gift of western democracy and now the multinationals they are crossing the border
[02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:39.320]  they know no flag no frontier if china suits them they rush off to china and start uh making money
[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:47.400]  there and then sending things back to america so american dollars are going on in a chinese
[02:56:47.400 --> 02:56:54.200]  coffers and the chinese what are they doing they are paying to the americans in form of loans and
[02:56:54.200 --> 02:57:00.920]  they are eventually going to buy all your big assets and institutions and you will see that
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:07.960]  will happen because this this is a flaw in in the system and general general i appreciate you
[02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:13.080]  giving us your perspective on that very interesting and i i look forward to having you back on the
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:18.360]  next few months sometimes we ought to do videos skype we get better uh better connection but
[02:57:18.360 --> 02:57:24.040]  i hope that we can end these illegal wars and stop trying to destabilize the world and then america
[02:57:24.040 --> 02:57:30.600]  can become a country again instead of a a force used by multinationals to take over the planet
[02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:36.040]  we pay for it we get the blame for it and i'm sick of it and i hope the pakistani people and afghan
[02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:43.000]  people understand there are a lot of americans here that are fighting you know to try to uh
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:47.560]  stop the globalists from using us for evil and i hope the pakistani people do realize that the
[02:57:47.560 --> 02:57:55.000]  west did try to help you guys against the russians it did we do appreciate that and we have been allies
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  and friends of america but unfortunately america always decides to eventually some dark in america
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:09.960]  tries to destroy its own friends so this is the the this is the real tragedy you must understand
[02:58:09.960 --> 02:58:16.680]  know yourself and know your enemy and half the problem is over but unfortunately they neither
[02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:23.320]  know their enemy nor do they know their friend absolutely uh that's an older saying when g i joe
[02:58:23.320 --> 02:58:27.800]  knowing is half the battle that's an old military term thousands of years old in america doesn't
[02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:32.440]  know and that's why we're in so much trouble knowing is half the battle hence in full wars

[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:44.680]  and video feeds there i got a bunch of news i haven't gotten to is why i'm going to overdrive
[03:00:44.680 --> 03:00:50.120]  i'm gonna go to calls right now come back go to more calls than to the news things like this bank
[03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:56.360]  robbery suspect wants nsa surveillance records for defense now that all the sheeple are learning
[03:00:56.360 --> 03:01:02.360]  this is going on people are gonna say hey you you have records that i was on the phone when that
[03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:08.440]  robbery went on so then everybody's gonna want to start dialing into this kind of like a public
[03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:16.280]  google uh you into the whole public's activity and and this is just amazing uh pacenic thinks
[03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:22.040]  it's all a big sigh up and he says he knows general alexander i gotta be honest though
[03:01:22.040 --> 03:01:27.640]  you know pacenic says some really inflammatory things on air uh i know he listens uh he's very
[03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:32.760]  interesting guy and i just i just think about you know what is he gonna say once he gets on air
[03:01:33.560 --> 03:01:36.840]  but i'm thinking about getting him on to talk about this because he is a very interesting source
[03:01:36.840 --> 03:01:42.600]  and he went into north korea during the whole korean crisis thing i mean he's just a real character
[03:01:43.320 --> 03:01:47.640]  so we've got some of that news and i just had hami ghoul on which again i think he was
[03:01:47.640 --> 03:01:51.800]  over driving on his iphone via skype but most of it you could hear pretty good it's just such
[03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:55.880]  important information and i really can't find anything he's saying that you know isn't true
[03:01:55.880 --> 03:02:02.520]  when it comes to military stuff here's the deal the west is stirring up and funding radical islemicism
[03:02:02.520 --> 03:02:07.080]  so they have an excuse to invade and take over the country's to not even put good governments in
[03:02:07.080 --> 03:02:14.200]  but to put worse ones in to keep the cycle going it is hyper immoral and they go well war isn't a
[03:02:14.200 --> 03:02:18.600]  you know moral we're doing this to dominate the people doing it don't want us to have families
[03:02:19.240 --> 03:02:24.280]  the globalists that have conquered us are the worst bunch in the world is my point
[03:02:24.280 --> 03:02:31.400]  i don't want to be under these islamic regimes i don't want to be under uh you know uh some type of
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:37.320]  you know totalitarian christian government i don't want to be under i want to be under the
[03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:43.400]  constitution i want to be under due process and freedom and man right now we're a conquered
[03:02:43.400 --> 03:02:46.840]  state of the globalist they've got the federal government they got most of the states they're
[03:02:46.840 --> 03:02:51.240]  taking over they're trying to shut off the free internet that's what this nsa building all these
[03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:56.680]  giant bases are about is about the new internet that's the new conduit that the google is part of
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:03:02.520]  the nsa and i don't like being conquered and they've come in with the corporate system so that it
[03:03:02.520 --> 03:03:07.240]  isn't a foreign army because they know people always resist that and by resisting it not serving
[03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:13.800]  your food not being your friend not paying the taxes militarily resisting you there's many ways
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:20.840]  to resist so they know to come in with hollywood stars and glitz and it's a psychological takeover
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:28.360]  and i want the new world order out of my life i mean much of the public is just caught in complete
[03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:38.840]  thrall complete thrall having no idea how much scientific manipulation they're under and then
[03:03:38.840 --> 03:03:43.960]  you talk to somebody like hi made gul i mean because i'm i'm informed about this stuff and i know for
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:47.560]  some new listeners who may not be informed that might have been you know sounded like martian to
[03:03:47.560 --> 03:03:52.280]  you especially with the bad connection or the jumbled connection uh what he was saying when
[03:03:52.280 --> 03:03:58.200]  i'm listening to it and it's just all right on i mean because it's on record they created a new
[03:03:58.200 --> 03:04:03.000]  al-qaeda on top of the old al-qaeda and a new taliban and then they went and arrested the real
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:09.640]  taliban that wasn't really doing anything and flew the new fake taliban out to safety into pakistan
[03:04:09.640 --> 03:04:13.880]  that was the airlift of evil and then you just see full spectrum dominance for someone that
[03:04:13.880 --> 03:04:17.960]  doesn't get this it's like what do you mean our government funds the terrorists they're fighting
[03:04:17.960 --> 03:04:23.720]  them no they fund them as the reason to be in those countries they fund them as the reason to
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:29.480]  have the black hole to spend trillions of dollars on i mean it's so elementary i don't know how the
[03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:33.720]  public doesn't get it remember the famous case like 18 years ago when i first got on air i covered it
[03:04:34.920 --> 03:04:39.160]  in new york city a guy was going around with a ball peen hammer breaking 100 windshields
[03:04:39.160 --> 03:04:44.360]  a night on average and the cops finally clicked and went look at all these ads for windshield
[03:04:44.360 --> 03:04:50.520]  dings up everywhere and staked out and caught the owner in the areas going and bashing the
[03:04:50.520 --> 03:04:56.040]  windshields out right under his billboards to then have people go get the windshields fixed i mean
[03:04:56.040 --> 03:05:02.920]  that's it that's how it works that's what it is okay it's real simple hello i'm alex jones

[03:08:25.560 --> 03:08:32.360]  up on info wars dot com congressman peter king calls for prosecution of journalists who broke
[03:08:32.360 --> 03:08:38.840]  nsa snooping story the nsa is committing felonies billions of times a day conservatively it's on
[03:08:38.840 --> 03:08:43.320]  record it's a felony it's on record they've been caught lying it's on record they're building a
[03:08:43.320 --> 03:08:48.680]  machine many times bigger than it was it's on record that alexander has bragged it'll be able
[03:08:48.680 --> 03:08:59.160]  to take over the old web shut down free speech it is incredible it is outrageous that all of this
[03:09:00.280 --> 03:09:06.440]  is going on and the article written by steve watson breaks all this down
[03:09:07.480 --> 03:09:15.240]  in fact steve goes over it the rep who supported terrorist calls for jailing reporters in america
[03:09:15.240 --> 03:09:22.520]  and that's right king is on record supporting the ira and and again folks i support irish
[03:09:22.520 --> 03:09:27.080]  freedom and independence but if you look at the ira the last 50 years it was a british
[03:09:27.080 --> 03:09:37.560]  intelligence operation to to remove the moral high ground away from the irish people so that
[03:09:37.560 --> 03:09:42.040]  they can claim we have to be here because you're bombing london almost all of that was staged
[03:09:42.040 --> 03:09:47.560]  almost all of it that's now mainline news in england so king wasn't even really supporting
[03:09:49.240 --> 03:09:54.040]  the irish republican army he was supporting intelligence front groups against the irish
[03:09:54.040 --> 03:09:59.480]  people from my research again it's more sophisticated than that ladies and gentlemen
[03:10:00.680 --> 03:10:05.480]  but once you understand the sophistication it's all completely clear and it's admitted it's not
[03:10:05.480 --> 03:10:15.480]  just we're saying this is our view so it's pretty disgusting it is pretty darn disgusting
[03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:21.720]  to see the persecution of the press and i'm telling you this whole homeland security thing is for the
[03:10:21.720 --> 03:10:26.520]  tea party it's for libertarians you got joe biden in private speeches saying we got to shut down
[03:10:26.520 --> 03:10:33.320]  the tea party and go after rand paul because they know rand paul is popular populist constitutional
[03:10:33.320 --> 03:10:41.240]  and is going to take over the republican party freedom is sexy politically and people want it
[03:10:41.960 --> 03:10:46.840]  and a real constitutional vision will bring people together how about everybody likes to
[03:10:46.840 --> 03:10:50.920]  organize into a gang how about we organize is freedom lovers together and stop worrying about
[03:10:50.920 --> 03:10:56.840]  which race or religion or color sexual preference all these all these things let's start becoming
[03:10:56.840 --> 03:11:02.040]  pro-human pro-liberty and anything the globalists are pushing we know is bad it's not a conservative
[03:11:02.040 --> 03:11:10.520]  or liberal issue abortion it's an issue of they push it to lower the population it is done to to
[03:11:10.520 --> 03:11:16.920]  dehumanize humanity i don't want to go on a tirade i said i go to your calls john and florida

[03:11:23.400 --> 03:11:31.560]  you great to have you alex you know you came back from uh from london and you know you said we
[03:11:31.560 --> 03:11:36.120]  got to take this to a whole new level and you're right and you know annan cookess was talking
[03:11:36.120 --> 03:11:42.520]  about a march on uh on dc our march he was talking about the second amendment but you know what this
[03:11:42.520 --> 03:11:49.160]  thing is so much bigger than all that we need a march on washington dc calling for the impeachment
[03:11:49.160 --> 03:11:54.760]  of obama we need to start right at the top he's the captain of the ship he says he doesn't know what
[03:11:54.760 --> 03:12:00.120]  the nsa is doing he says he he doesn't know about the irs and what they're doing he doesn't he doesn't
[03:12:00.120 --> 03:12:04.360]  know anything well you know if you're a captain you don't know anything then you don't need to be
[03:12:04.360 --> 03:12:10.680]  the captain anymore well listen here's the issue i don't think one march will do it but but but but
[03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:16.520]  marching locally calling into radio going to city council talking about issues resisting speaking
[03:12:16.520 --> 03:12:24.200]  out in the tsa line uh spreading the word about this broadcast uh we've got 22 167 signatures
[03:12:24.200 --> 03:12:30.360]  for an article we put up last weekend gave no promotion for the white house to respond
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:38.680]  to a petition for obama to resign for illegally violating article one section eight uh and you
[03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:46.040]  know all the different things that they've done we put it out july 7th 2013 we did another one too
[03:12:46.040 --> 03:12:54.200]  just on the spine when you see the numbers on that and uh it's it's uh due july 7th it started a few
[03:12:54.200 --> 03:12:59.560]  weeks ago or last week the point is guys print me that and show me the info wars article what i
[03:12:59.560 --> 03:13:03.400]  want is the info wars article because what they did is they did two petitions and there's one
[03:13:03.400 --> 03:13:07.720]  particular order one that i particularly want to promote but my point is just print me the info
[03:13:07.720 --> 03:13:11.720]  where i can pull it up the info or article so i can give people the specifics and give them the
[03:13:11.720 --> 03:13:17.880]  headline to be able to find it go sign the petition so that the so that the white house
[03:13:17.880 --> 03:13:22.520]  has to respond okay and again people say well it doesn't matter it's a non-binding petition
[03:13:22.520 --> 03:13:30.280]  it makes them respond and makes it a media issue so so i agree with you uh we need to push and even
[03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:35.800]  if obama is just a puppet it scares the other puppets when we hold them accountable uh go ahead
[03:13:35.800 --> 03:13:43.640]  uh absolutely see the thing is is if obama fills the heat and if the people start calling for him
[03:13:43.640 --> 03:13:49.480]  to resign or calling for for impeachment or whatever you know all the minions other than to start
[03:13:49.480 --> 03:13:54.440]  worrying and scurrying and and and that's what we need to do and i'll tell you as a listener and
[03:13:54.440 --> 03:13:59.240]  i've only been a listener for a few months i have felt a lot of things going on in this country
[03:13:59.240 --> 03:14:03.960]  were just wrong it was all in my gut and when i started listening to your program it just came
[03:14:03.960 --> 03:14:09.480]  so alive in me and and um i'll tell you what i gotta i gotta read the dose of the bible every
[03:14:09.480 --> 03:14:14.360]  day just to keep my temper down you just to keep keep some peace when i listen instead of getting
[03:14:14.360 --> 03:14:20.120]  angry i hear you brother and thanks for the call john instead of getting angry go wake people up
[03:14:20.120 --> 03:14:24.760]  get aggressive every few people you wake up in numbers that brings them down everybody's always
[03:14:24.760 --> 03:14:31.960]  looking for one magic solution one march one thing that can be done and that doesn't exist
[03:14:31.960 --> 03:14:39.160]  if the one film was made that hit the zeitgeist and was like an hour long and was seen by 300 million
[03:14:39.160 --> 03:14:44.840]  americans and caused a codal shift kind of like uncle tom's cabin or something against slavery
[03:14:45.960 --> 03:14:51.720]  then maybe but there the other than that there is no silver bullet there is no silver bullet
