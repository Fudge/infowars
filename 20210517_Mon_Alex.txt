[00:00.000 --> 00:24.560]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24.560 --> 00:31.680]  Each Monday, May 17th a year is 2021. I'm your host Alex Jones, and in the next segment,
[00:31.680 --> 00:37.920]  I am going to lay out how the quote into the mask mandate and Bill Gates' divorce and
[00:37.920 --> 00:45.680]  all the Jeffrey Epstein information ties together with the larger globalist agenda and where
[00:45.680 --> 00:50.880]  this planet is going in the future. It's all coming up on the other side of this quick
[00:50.880 --> 00:56.720]  break, and then after I lay this out, in the next 10 minutes, Alan Shor is going to take over,
[00:56.720 --> 01:00.560]  and he has a very, very powerful broadcast line up for you today. But understand this,
[01:01.600 --> 01:06.160]  there isn't just evil in the universe. The globalists don't have all the power.
[01:06.160 --> 01:11.600]  By us not standing up and exercising our rights, we give them the power. And I know
[01:12.480 --> 01:17.600]  you know that, but you have to every day realize how important you are. You're the people that
[01:17.600 --> 01:20.960]  are aware of the whole globalist agenda. You're the people that have been proven right out of
[01:20.960 --> 01:25.840]  the thousands of political ideologies out of all the fake disinfo that's flooded by the
[01:25.840 --> 01:32.000]  mainstream media to confuse people. You understand what's going on. You understand the bigger agenda.
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.880]  You've been proven right. So you need to talk to your friends, your family, and others, explain
[01:36.880 --> 01:41.760]  to them that the new world order is a real thing. And as long as we deny its existence,
[01:42.480 --> 01:47.280]  we only allow it to enslave us more. And you can't deny it now because it's all staring
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.880]  us right in the face. So I'm going to take over here for a few minutes, tell you what he's not
[01:50.880 --> 01:56.160]  coming up. And when I come back, I'm doing one segment that condenses all this key intel together
[01:56.160 --> 02:00.400]  that is so important for you to understand and for others to understand. Because the only way
[02:00.400 --> 02:04.640]  we defeat this new world order is by getting our knees to God and humbling ourselves and then taking
[02:04.640 --> 02:13.600]  political culture over and eat it on a gash. Amen to that. Thank you, Alex. I want to throw
[02:13.600 --> 02:21.040]  you here in the info wars world headquarters in Austin, Texas. And there are a lot of big
[02:21.040 --> 02:28.800]  developments we're going to be covering today. It looks like Bill Gates was already in damage
[02:28.800 --> 02:36.320]  repair for years because of his relationship with Epstein, which is now looking to be a lot
[02:36.320 --> 02:44.080]  closer than we were originally led to believe. But my goodness, that's barely even the tip of
[02:44.080 --> 02:52.560]  the iceberg today. The maskaholic insane leftists are admitting that the vaccine doesn't work and
[02:52.560 --> 02:57.440]  or the masks don't work and or the whole thing is just all about politics. So we'll explain that
[02:57.440 --> 03:02.800]  coming up. Joe Biden has quietly you haven't really been seeing or hearing too much from Joe,
[03:02.800 --> 03:07.360]  except when he's out trying to divide and conquer the nation or do whatever his public
[03:07.360 --> 03:14.480]  master tell him to quietly behind the scenes has been tossing out rescinding many of Trump's
[03:14.480 --> 03:18.560]  executive orders. You're not really seeing or hearing about this, are you? Well, you'll see
[03:18.560 --> 03:28.560]  and hear about that today. And just because it's such comic relief, CNN had to fire one of its
[03:28.560 --> 03:35.360]  contributors to begin the week. I know really sad for expressing admiration for Hitler.
[03:36.080 --> 03:42.320]  That happened. That's always a fun one. And of course, though, you can do that on Twitter to
[03:42.320 --> 03:49.840]  talk about how great Hitler is. It's free speech. But if you say that men, men cannot get pregnant,
[03:49.840 --> 03:56.800]  Twitter will ban you. So we've got more cases of that. We've got cases of humanity
[03:56.800 --> 04:03.840]  and America rising up and having victory right now. And so even though we see the New World Order
[04:03.840 --> 04:09.040]  at our doorstep and we're forced to deal with it in a very short proximity now,
[04:10.240 --> 04:17.120]  it is forcing people to take action who had been dormant for so long. So we'll talk about
[04:17.120 --> 04:21.440]  examples of that. We'll show you what the Democrats in the media are doing to this country. More
[04:21.440 --> 04:27.440]  violent crime happening, but not just, you know, violent crime for the sake of whatever
[04:27.440 --> 04:31.520]  crime you're committing, whether you're robbing somebody or trying to rape somebody. Now it's
[04:31.520 --> 04:37.840]  just hate crimes. Yes, just hate crimes are yet, but it's always the left doing it. More negative
[04:37.840 --> 04:44.080]  vaccine results. I mean, just the stacks of news are unbelievable. But on the other side of this
[04:44.080 --> 04:50.000]  break, as I do a long detailed version of all the news in the waterfront today, Alex Jones is
[04:50.000 --> 04:59.600]  going to condense it all into 10 minutes like only Alex Jones can in 66. People keep asking me,
[04:59.600 --> 05:03.920]  Alex, how did you predict over a year ago that food prices would explode within a year? Because
[05:03.920 --> 05:08.320]  it was in all the globalist actuaries that you shut down most of the world for a year. It's going
[05:08.320 --> 05:13.840]  to cause a collapse in food production and distribution and not just that fuel and every
[05:13.840 --> 05:18.080]  other major commodity. The globalist want to post industrial world. They're hitting us with
[05:18.080 --> 05:22.720]  economic war. I told you food prices would explode. They're now exploding. Our great sponsor,
[05:22.720 --> 05:26.160]  my patriot, has barely gone up in price. Their competitors have gone up even more,
[05:26.160 --> 05:30.240]  but they're about to go up in two weeks. But instead of just holding prices,
[05:30.240 --> 05:37.200]  they're still 10% off until Sunday evening. And then it's got to go up 10% off at infowarstore.com
[05:37.200 --> 05:43.760]  2020 prices in the year 2021. But you've got to act now and buying your food from us funds the
[05:43.760 --> 05:49.440]  info war a 360 went. It's ready to ship. They've got it on hand. Get years before the scarcity
[05:49.440 --> 05:54.000]  and the line start, which I think we'll see by next fall. Hell, a lot of shelves are already empty.
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.480]  This is crazy. We're being collapsed by design. Get ready now. Prepare with Alex.com.
[05:58.480 --> 06:16.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[06:16.960 --> 06:33.920]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones. Thank you for joining us on this
[06:33.920 --> 06:41.520]  live Monday, May 17th, 2021 broadcast. I'm your host Alex Jones. Owen Schroeder is going to be
[06:41.520 --> 06:46.960]  taking over for the balance the next three hours coming up the start of the next segment. And
[06:46.960 --> 06:53.280]  Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting the fourth hour today. Now it's very important to understand
[06:53.280 --> 06:58.880]  that the world has reached a critical crossroads in the future of humanity. And if we look at
[06:59.600 --> 07:06.800]  the COVID response, or Bill Gates' divorce, or what's happening to global currencies,
[07:06.800 --> 07:13.520]  or the gas pipeline shut off, or the war expanding in the Middle East, if we look at any of these
[07:13.520 --> 07:19.760]  little individual pieces alone, looks like chaos. None of it makes sense. But when you actually
[07:19.760 --> 07:25.680]  study the real politic that Henry Kissinger has written about, that the globalists are carrying
[07:25.680 --> 07:33.520]  out against the planet, then you understand how they stage events, but they also use naturally
[07:33.520 --> 07:40.560]  occurring crises to always expand their power. So they're very, very opportunistic. So when I
[07:40.560 --> 07:46.960]  lay this news out, a lot of it's very, very good news. But a lot of it is also very, very bad news.
[07:47.840 --> 07:52.960]  And if you don't face the bad news, they have a good chance of winning. So first let's just get
[07:52.960 --> 07:58.240]  this straight. You notice they came out and said early, they were planning to say you could take
[07:58.240 --> 08:04.960]  the mask off at least partially on July 4th, so that on our nation's holiday where we celebrate
[08:04.960 --> 08:10.160]  independence from tyranny, they could declare the tyranny and say, now I'm going out without a mask
[08:10.160 --> 08:15.200]  as a privilege, we'll let you take your burqa off at least for a few months until the fall and winter
[08:15.200 --> 08:23.040]  comes. But because their internal polling showed how incredibly unpopular the mask are, and because
[08:23.040 --> 08:30.320]  the majority of doctors and scientists and nurses have really woken up to the fact that the mask
[08:30.320 --> 08:35.200]  gives you bacterial pneumonia, that it doesn't protect you, that everything we were told about
[08:35.200 --> 08:41.920]  COVID was a lie, that it was about 100 plus times weaker than what they originally claimed,
[08:41.920 --> 08:48.160]  that they were counting all the people that died of other diseases as COVID, because the facts and
[08:48.160 --> 08:55.200]  the studies and the research were coming out at first using the fear of China and using the fear
[08:55.200 --> 09:02.560]  of the media hyping up a deceptive death toll that was again much higher than it was, people were
[09:02.560 --> 09:10.080]  buying into the lies, but as time went on people began to wake up to them, and then the population
[09:10.080 --> 09:17.920]  began to understand that Fauci and Bill Gates and the Wuhan lab had souped up a regular cold
[09:17.920 --> 09:23.920]  virus to give it gain of function, and also put their stamp of ownership on it so they could
[09:23.920 --> 09:30.720]  respond with vaccines, and then set up a vaccine tracking system and a contact tracing system that
[09:30.720 --> 09:36.880]  forms the blueprint and the backbone of a worldwide medical ID and even implantable microchips,
[09:37.680 --> 09:42.880]  as Klaus Schwab has called for. And so as the public began to realize, wait a minute, I wear
[09:42.880 --> 09:46.640]  the mask still after I've had the shot, and then wait a minute, the shots don't even work,
[09:46.640 --> 09:54.560]  because Bill Maher and the Yankees and so many other people have already had the vaccine months
[09:54.560 --> 10:04.240]  ago, but they still get COVID-19, and then the public began to realize that Fauci's own NIH had
[10:04.240 --> 10:11.680]  to admit last week in Congress that around half of the NIH scientists and nurses and doctors
[10:11.680 --> 10:16.800]  and epidemiologists and virologists have taken these ranking shots, and the word is most of
[10:16.800 --> 10:20.960]  those that claim they did either lied about it or injected it into the trash can and it didn't
[10:20.960 --> 10:26.640]  take it. I told you that weeks ago. So the very people that want us to take this are scared to
[10:26.640 --> 10:31.680]  take it themselves, and no amount of lies have always been approved by the FDA. Oh, it's safe,
[10:31.680 --> 10:36.240]  will work, because it was never approved by the FDA. It was never put through trials. It was given
[10:36.240 --> 10:43.280]  emergency use authorization, and they called the general public taking it the test, but then there's
[10:43.280 --> 10:48.480]  no real surveillance system know what's happening other than anecdotal how many people gotten sick,
[10:48.480 --> 10:53.680]  how many people have gotten paralyzed, how many people have died. I was at dinner last night
[10:53.680 --> 11:00.080]  with five people, and one of them had a story about a lady at church that was totally healthy,
[11:00.080 --> 11:05.360]  who took the first round of Moderna, and she's in the hospital weeks later fighting for her life.
[11:05.360 --> 11:10.720]  She's basically paralyzed. And look at her, it clapped him. He went and took the second jab
[11:10.720 --> 11:14.720]  of one of the mRNA vaccines and almost died and was paralyzed and says it was the worst thing in
[11:14.720 --> 11:20.000]  his life. What about Ben Stein? What about Hank Aaron? What about Marbles Marvin Hagler? What about
[11:20.000 --> 11:26.240]  I know so many people that have even gotten paralyzed or had violent seizures once they
[11:26.240 --> 11:32.160]  took it. But again, they're trying to cover those numbers up. But everybody's talking to their
[11:32.160 --> 11:37.520]  friends and family, people realize what's happened. And now they're discovering the studies from the
[11:37.520 --> 11:44.160]  University of Texas and everywhere else that show what really happened with vaccine trials done
[11:44.160 --> 11:50.800]  previously for spars, for SARS, and for COVID coronaviruses. And that the viruses are made of
[11:50.800 --> 11:58.960]  such a common protein that when you give someone a vaccine, before that it causes these autoimmune
[11:58.960 --> 12:04.240]  responses. And look, I know you as listeners already know this. I know you already understand this,
[12:04.240 --> 12:09.680]  but this is life and death stuff. So it's starting to get out there. And what you have to understand
[12:09.680 --> 12:17.840]  is they're removing some of these controls, except from flying on planes, buses and trains,
[12:17.840 --> 12:21.600]  they want to keep that control over you so they can always turn it back on whenever they want.
[12:22.320 --> 12:26.240]  They're removing some of those controls because they know there's been a giant rebellion
[12:26.240 --> 12:31.520]  and a giant awakening. And so that's why I predicted that if the establishment realizes
[12:31.520 --> 12:35.440]  their program has failed, and if they can't get the majority of people to take the vaccine,
[12:35.440 --> 12:40.160]  so they can then persecute the minority that hasn't, that it would be seen as a failure of
[12:40.160 --> 12:45.600]  Claus Schwab and a failure of Bill Gates and a failure of the United Nations to carry out this
[12:45.600 --> 12:51.680]  takeover and that those that executed the plan would be punished and thrown over the bus. And so
[12:51.680 --> 12:57.200]  that's why we're now seeing Bill Gates begin to get in major trouble. So a lot of good things
[12:57.200 --> 13:02.720]  are happening. Humanity is awakening, but you got to remember as much as 50% of the population has
[13:02.720 --> 13:08.880]  already been hoodwinked and bullied into taking these shots. We've got to get out and warn them
[13:08.880 --> 13:14.240]  and let them understand that even the NIH's own scientists won't take this because it's so dangerous
[13:14.240 --> 13:18.560]  and that when they have debilitating disorders in the future, there's a very good chance it was
[13:18.560 --> 13:23.920]  caused by the vaccines because that's what's in the animal studies. That's why they skipped studies
[13:23.920 --> 13:29.440]  in this modern rollout. He's already did previous studies 10 years ago, 8 years ago,
[13:29.440 --> 13:35.360]  5 years ago, all over the US and all over Europe and China. And so this is the biggest story of
[13:35.360 --> 13:41.200]  my lifetime. This is depopulation. This is Frankenshots deployed against us. And now suddenly,
[13:41.200 --> 13:46.320]  what do you see happening? Congressional hearings are being set up about gain of function and Fauci
[13:46.320 --> 13:52.640]  lying to Congress and the Wuhan lab and Bill Gates. And so suddenly, his wife, who's a globalist,
[13:52.640 --> 13:58.640]  just like he is, begins the divorce and they're beginning to talk about, oh, he harassed women
[13:58.640 --> 14:05.200]  at Microsoft. That is a limited hangout to divert from him staying not dozens of times,
[14:05.200 --> 14:12.640]  but hundreds of times, as Bill Gates did, with Jeffrey Epstein and not just in New York, but also
[14:12.640 --> 14:20.800]  in Paris and in London and in the Caribbean on the pedophile island, flying into Little
[14:20.800 --> 14:26.800]  St. John's on the way to express. So this whole house of cards is starting to come down. The
[14:26.800 --> 14:31.840]  scientists won't take the shots. Bill Gates is being tied up with Epstein and a huge Blackmail
[14:31.840 --> 14:38.240]  program of scientists to be able to have this medical takeover of the planet, but it was all
[14:38.240 --> 14:43.520]  built on sand. So again, that's a lot of positive news. But what you've got to understand is if we
[14:43.520 --> 14:48.480]  don't keep exposing the COVID-19 was an overblown hoax, if we don't keep exposing for real illnesses
[14:48.480 --> 14:52.160]  are being caused with the vaccines and the people not going to the hospital, they're telling you
[14:52.160 --> 14:56.160]  they have COVID even though they were already vaccinated and they're dying, they're telling
[14:56.160 --> 15:01.120]  them of COVID when they really died of the vaccine, they are simply going to bring this back in the
[15:01.120 --> 15:06.800]  fall of the winter saying it's because of the flu or saying it's because of pneumonia. Now we've
[15:06.800 --> 15:11.840]  got to wear a mask. We've got to stay locked in our houses because after all, if we locked ourselves
[15:11.840 --> 15:16.400]  up for something that kills one tenth of one percent, well the flu even kills more than that,
[15:16.400 --> 15:22.640]  we've got to then lock everything down. So that's how this is all interconnected. Gates is in trouble,
[15:22.640 --> 15:27.840]  the globalists are in trouble. This program was a success at first, but now it's stalled out and
[15:27.840 --> 15:32.960]  the new older doesn't know what to do. All I'm saying is we have to continue to expose all this
[15:32.960 --> 15:37.360]  and call for justice or they're going to bring similar scares back in the near future and remember
[15:37.360 --> 15:42.560]  Canada and Europe and Australia, other areas are still basically locked down. So their populations
[15:42.560 --> 15:46.400]  have to point out that even the scientists of the world will not take the vaccine they're trying to
[15:46.400 --> 15:51.760]  make us take. I shot a big report on this yesterday. It's the top video at bandodvideoinfowords.com.
[15:51.760 --> 15:55.200]  Please share the fact that their own scientists will not take the franken shots. We'll be right
[15:55.200 --> 16:03.040]  back with a little short on the other side. Scientists agree magnesium is the most important co-factor in
[16:03.040 --> 16:09.760]  the body regulating and controlling hundreds of pathways. Magnesium is required for your body
[16:09.760 --> 16:16.000]  to do the following. Helps convert food into energy, helps with muscle contraction function,
[16:16.000 --> 16:21.840]  helps regulate the nervous system, helps with protein building in the muscles and so much more.
[16:21.840 --> 16:28.960]  And now it's available in this concentrated form of ionized, fizzy magnesium. It tastes great.
[16:28.960 --> 16:34.960]  I take it in the morning. I take it in the evening. It is so essential in my life and I hope all of
[16:34.960 --> 16:40.960]  you will check it out and try it. It's available at infowarstore.com right now. This is the best
[16:40.960 --> 16:45.040]  formula from our research you're going to find out there. So if you've already enjoyed other
[16:45.040 --> 16:49.600]  magnesium formulas, give this one a try. I think you're going to love it at the same time it funds
[16:49.600 --> 16:57.760]  the M4 which is a true 360 win. Now exclusively available at infowarstore.com for only $19.95.
[17:19.760 --> 17:25.280]  oil that's then turned into gas and sent to the east coast. That's right. Joe Biden shut down the
[17:25.280 --> 17:31.520]  Keystone Pipeline right after it was completed. Joe Biden did that to America. He has the history.
[17:31.520 --> 17:36.480]  He has the background. He's the one that promised to get us off of fossil fuels. He's the one that's
[17:36.480 --> 17:42.080]  trying to extend the lockdowns of the country. Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the new
[17:42.080 --> 17:46.880]  world order wants a post-industrial world and they want the United States, Europe and Australia
[17:46.880 --> 17:52.160]  crippled so communist China can't be dominant. It's not Russia that's the enemy. It's communist
[17:52.160 --> 17:57.360]  China and their millions like Joe Biden in control of the White House. That's the facts. That's the
[17:57.360 --> 18:20.880]  information you're listening to the Alex Jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[18:20.880 --> 18:28.480]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance. It's Alex
[18:28.480 --> 18:37.440]  Jones. And we are back ladies and gentlemen on this Monday edition. Owen Schroyer is about to
[18:37.440 --> 18:42.400]  take over. I just want to take a few minutes out to be a thankful person, a thankful person for the
[18:42.400 --> 18:48.240]  crew, a thankful person for our affiliates and our sponsors and for the amazing listeners that are
[18:48.240 --> 18:52.720]  out there that make this transmission possible. Without you, none of this would have happened.
[18:52.720 --> 18:57.120]  The globalists are in deep trouble. Their programs worldwide are falling apart.
[18:57.680 --> 19:03.040]  Just like in December of 2019, the UN had an emergency meeting in Switzerland and admitted
[19:03.040 --> 19:07.680]  that their own scientists don't believe in vaccines, that the frontline of doctors is wobbly,
[19:07.680 --> 19:13.120]  that Big Pharma just gives them illegal vaccines, untested to be tested on third world populations.
[19:13.120 --> 19:18.960]  That's why they launched a few months later. The giant COVID hysteria was to try to cover up their
[19:18.960 --> 19:24.240]  past crimes with an even bigger crime and hope that once the public signed on to going along
[19:24.240 --> 19:30.400]  with this crime, we would be in mass Stockholm syndrome and go along with the even bigger lies
[19:30.400 --> 19:36.640]  to come, which is totally population. But you see, they've got to get 60, 70, 80% on board.
[19:36.640 --> 19:41.840]  Because if you've got a minority of even 10% saying no, their system won't work instead.
[19:41.840 --> 19:48.080]  The real numbers in the Midwest and the South and more conservative areas are about 30%
[19:48.640 --> 19:53.760]  have taken the Frankenstein. Sure, in New York and a few other controlled areas, yeah,
[19:54.480 --> 20:01.120]  maybe you've had 60% or so taken. That's not enough because you can't have a slim majority
[20:01.680 --> 20:07.200]  being able to basically bully a large minority. But when you've got 50, 50 doing it, and when
[20:07.200 --> 20:12.240]  you've got the government's own scientist not going along with it, not taking it at numbers of
[20:12.240 --> 20:19.200]  50%, it's game over for the globalist. And so we should take some time out to thank God because,
[20:19.200 --> 20:24.240]  sure, I can thank you. I can thank the crew. I can think what we've done getting the word out
[20:24.240 --> 20:29.280]  as listeners and viewers. But at the end of the day, it's about God and about God moving the
[20:29.280 --> 20:34.000]  hearts of men and women everywhere and really opening people up to awaken to what's happening.
[20:34.000 --> 20:40.240]  And so I salute you all. I thank you all. And I want you to realize that we're starting to turn
[20:40.240 --> 20:44.400]  the corner here when it comes to exposing to a water, but we're not out of the woods yet.
[20:44.400 --> 20:47.680]  And they're going to launch a lot of other big fear-mongering operations
[20:47.680 --> 20:52.320]  in the near future. So redouble your efforts now, realize that much of the world is still
[20:52.320 --> 20:56.720]  locked down under total tyranny. And now it's time to call for the prosecution of the people
[20:56.720 --> 21:03.200]  that launched this eugenics great reset lie, or they're going to continue to cook up more schemes
[21:03.200 --> 21:10.480]  in the future. So again, this was a halftime game. We were behind until right before halftime.
[21:10.480 --> 21:16.880]  Now we're ahead by three points, not a big margin, but at least we're not behind going into halftime.
[21:16.880 --> 21:21.600]  If we realize what's going on, we realize the power we have. And if we focus and come out
[21:22.640 --> 21:27.120]  for this second half, realize that we have right on our side and history on our side. And if we
[21:27.120 --> 21:32.000]  spread the word about the fact that half the scientists at the NIH won't even take their own
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.560]  damn vaccine, it's game over for the new world order. But now we've got to start warning those
[21:36.560 --> 21:42.400]  that took the vaccines. We've got to talk to top scientists and look at the research and find out
[21:42.400 --> 21:47.760]  how do we detoxify people who have now been made allergic to their own bodies with the protein
[21:47.760 --> 21:51.920]  spike. I'm going to hand a baton over now to Owen Schroyer and the crew in Austin, Texas.
[21:51.920 --> 22:04.480]  This is one hell of a time to be alive. God bless and good luck. And let me just expand on that.
[22:06.160 --> 22:09.440]  As we're back here in the Info Wars, World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[22:10.400 --> 22:15.840]  Let me just expand on that a little bit. And I've got this photo here. If you guys just want to put
[22:15.840 --> 22:24.240]  this up on the screen as I'm talking. Before the show, maybe on an hour before the show,
[22:24.240 --> 22:29.680]  I'm doing my prep work in here. You can see I got news stacks scattered throughout the desk.
[22:29.680 --> 22:37.360]  And it's all organized in my own mind. But Gregory comes in and he's just like,
[22:37.360 --> 22:42.800]  what do you think is the big story right now? What's on your mind? And I'm just looking at
[22:42.800 --> 22:48.800]  the stack of news and I'm like, well, you know, the big story. And the big story has to be the fact
[22:48.800 --> 22:55.040]  that Bill Gates and Fauci are completely caught dead to rights in this scandemic, in this viral
[22:55.040 --> 23:02.640]  release, in this economic shutdown and culpable in thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of
[23:02.640 --> 23:07.920]  deaths. And there's a paper trail, there's receipts, they're caught dead to rights.
[23:07.920 --> 23:20.800]  And so there is a mass awakening happening. And in an incredible just the way the universe works,
[23:20.800 --> 23:23.760]  the metaphysics of the universe, karma, whatever you want to call it.
[23:25.680 --> 23:29.200]  Trump is out of the White House. He's playing golf. He's down in Mar-a-Lago.
[23:30.240 --> 23:35.280]  Info wars is banned off the internet. We're not allowed on any social media where we
[23:35.280 --> 23:39.600]  had to build our own thing over a banned out video. So Trump has his own thing down in Mar-a-Lago.
[23:39.600 --> 23:44.320]  He's doing his thing. Info wars has our own thing banned out video info wars.com. We're doing our
[23:44.320 --> 23:50.880]  own thing. And the real tyrants, the real power brokers, the real criminals are now at the fore.
[23:51.600 --> 23:56.000]  And they're at the front and they're on TV and they're dominating and they're everywhere.
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.960]  But society's not getting any better. It's getting worse. And all the things Trump told you about,
[24:00.960 --> 24:05.040]  all the things info wars told you about, now it's all coming true. But we're just kind of on
[24:05.040 --> 24:09.440]  the sidelines and like, yep, yep, yep. That's all exactly what we said. Yeah, that's that over
[24:09.440 --> 24:16.000]  there. And yeah, that's him. And but now everybody's watching. Everybody's paying attention. Everybody
[24:16.000 --> 24:21.920]  has an interest. Everybody in some way has been hit by the fake pandemic. Maybe it's their small
[24:21.920 --> 24:27.200]  business getting shut down. Maybe their granny got sent to old folks home. They put her on a
[24:27.200 --> 24:32.080]  ventilator, killed her dead in a hammer. Maybe your uncle got one of the COVID jabs and now he
[24:32.080 --> 24:42.000]  had a stroke and he can't get out of bed. So you're seeing the mass wakening, you're seeing
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.400]  people go on bridges and put up signs saying the vaccines are deadly. This is how people begin their
[24:48.400 --> 24:54.080]  grassroots activism. This is stuff info wars has been doing and organizing forever. That's why
[24:54.080 --> 24:57.760]  they attack us. So they attack you in the audience. That's why you're so important.
[24:57.760 --> 25:05.440]  But I mean, here's some other examples. Some politicians are starting to get it and fight
[25:05.440 --> 25:11.360]  back not fear the political correctness. Oklahoma governor grill steaks under pro-vegan pita bill
[25:11.360 --> 25:19.040]  board. That's how it's done. You don't cater and bow to this mob. You stand up and you get in their
[25:19.040 --> 25:25.840]  face. Oh, that's a nice billboard you have making fun of me because I eat meat. I'm going to have
[25:25.840 --> 25:30.720]  a big fat barbecue right underneath it. How do you like that? And guess what? That's popular.
[25:30.720 --> 25:35.760]  That's winning. People like steak. I know that's wild. People like freedom. People like steak.
[25:37.040 --> 25:43.520]  That's a good bet right there. Gas station puts hunter biden meme on their sign. Hope gas prices
[25:43.520 --> 25:47.280]  don't get too high and then it's hunter biden passed out with a crack pipe in his mouth.
[25:48.400 --> 25:55.040]  That's how you win. That's cultural victory. That's popular. And so that's one of the
[25:55.040 --> 25:59.360]  frustrations is people could have been doing this years ago. They just hadn't caught on. Now
[25:59.360 --> 26:03.440]  they're getting it. Now they're catching on not because they figured out it's popular,
[26:03.440 --> 26:06.000]  but because their instincts have kicked in, it's fight or fly.
[26:07.840 --> 26:13.680]  It's happening in the corporate world. Cyber security tycoon capersky claims CIA hackers
[26:13.680 --> 26:18.320]  could actually be behind US colonial pipeline attack blamed on Russian group. Absolutely.
[26:18.320 --> 26:23.200]  Came out from the vault seven wiki leaks. The CIA and any government enterprise
[26:23.200 --> 26:29.120]  can put digital fingerprints on any hack and say, oh, it's in Russia. Oh, it's in China. Oh,
[26:29.120 --> 26:34.720]  it's this group. Oh, it's that group. That was Julian Assange that released that, you know,
[26:34.720 --> 26:42.000]  the one that rots in jail. A total crime against him, a hero Julian Assange. And then you've got
[26:42.000 --> 26:49.280]  all of these audits happening in Michigan in Arizona in New Hampshire in Wisconsin. And guess
[26:49.280 --> 26:54.640]  what? They're finding the voter fraud. At the very least, the voting machines failed us at the most.
[26:54.640 --> 26:59.680]  We had a rig 2020 election and it's all out. The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning
[26:59.680 --> 27:05.760]  you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational. The globalist are out
[27:05.760 --> 27:11.120]  of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover. But the good news
[27:11.120 --> 27:15.040]  is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for
[27:15.040 --> 27:20.560]  decades to get ready for this to be able to find it off. Humanity is strong. We're incredible.
[27:20.560 --> 27:24.800]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask
[27:24.800 --> 27:29.680]  God for guidance, we will defeat it. So prayer is essential. Research is essential. Getting
[27:29.680 --> 27:34.320]  prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time,
[27:34.320 --> 27:38.960]  supporting info wars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because
[27:38.960 --> 27:43.680]  they're great products for you and your family. And they're also funding our operation info wars
[27:43.680 --> 27:49.440]  store.com info wars store.com is incredible. A lot of our products that have been sold out because
[27:49.440 --> 27:53.840]  the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vaso beats and others. So get them today
[27:53.840 --> 27:59.760]  at info wars store.com. And I thank you for being part of the resistance. One of the most common
[27:59.760 --> 28:05.840]  questions I get on air, but also off air when I'm just out and about is Alex, what do I say to my
[28:05.840 --> 28:12.240]  family about the vaccines? How do I warn them? Well, the problem is there's so many problems with
[28:12.240 --> 28:16.400]  it. So many facets, the history of contaminative vaccines, the fact that they have liability
[28:16.400 --> 28:21.760]  protection in the US and Europe, the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer
[28:21.760 --> 28:27.040]  viruses and other things to vaccines. And the whole history of secret experimentation on at risk
[28:27.040 --> 28:32.400]  groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans, the list goes on and on. But what about the fact
[28:32.400 --> 28:40.080]  that Fauci testified to Congress and so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021 that around
[28:40.080 --> 28:45.680]  half of the NIH CDC staff, medical doctors, neurologists, scientists have refused to take the
[28:45.680 --> 28:50.720]  vaccine and don't take it safe. Yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it. That's
[28:50.720 --> 28:54.000]  the same thing in the private practices out there. Some more numbers that that's not something I'm
[28:54.000 --> 29:00.000]  going to be taking. That's very, very simple. There's your answer. The globalist comprise the
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.800]  oldest and richest families on earth, and they have brought down hundreds and hundreds of nations
[29:04.800 --> 29:10.640]  over the last thousand years. They have bankrupted once successful countries all across the world,
[29:10.640 --> 29:17.360]  and they've used the same formulas of civil unrest and civil war. And they're doing it again
[29:17.360 --> 29:23.040]  to the United States of America and Europe right now, bringing in giant third world populations
[29:23.040 --> 29:27.440]  and then brainwashing them and turning them against the country that they wanted to emigrate to
[29:27.440 --> 29:31.600]  because they knew it was better and had more freedom and more opportunity. Ladies and gentlemen,
[29:31.600 --> 29:36.720]  America is under scientific attack, and it's time now more than ever to raise the alarm and
[29:36.720 --> 29:41.360]  warn everyone you know that what's really happening and at the same time get prepared in case things
[29:41.360 --> 29:45.440]  continue to go south like they are. One of the smartest moves out there is to get high quality
[29:45.440 --> 29:49.920]  storeable food so that as inflation goes up, it's a way to defeat the inflation and have
[29:49.920 --> 29:56.160]  insurance you can eat. So we've extended the sale through this Sunday at 10% off all storeable foods
[29:56.160 --> 30:03.360]  at preparewithallus.com. Scientists agree magnesium is the most important co-factor in the body,
[30:03.360 --> 30:09.840]  regulating and controlling hundreds of pathways. Magnesium is required for your body to do the
[30:09.840 --> 30:16.560]  following. Helps convert food into energy, helps with muscle contraction function, helps regulate
[30:16.560 --> 30:22.240]  the nervous system, helps with protein building in the muscles, and so much more. And now it's
[30:22.240 --> 30:29.200]  available in this concentrated form of ionized, fizzy magnesium. It tastes great. I take it in
[30:29.200 --> 30:35.200]  the morning, I take it in the evening. It is so essential in my life, and I hope all of you will
[30:35.200 --> 30:41.040]  check it out and try it. It's available at InfoWarStore.com right now. This is the best formula
[30:41.040 --> 30:45.360]  from our research you're going to find out there. So if you've already enjoyed other magnesium
[30:45.360 --> 30:49.440]  formulas, give this one a try. I think you're going to love it at the same time it funds the
[30:49.440 --> 30:57.520]  InfoWar, which is a true 360 win. Now exclusively available at InfoWarStore.com for only $19.95.
[31:20.160 --> 31:36.240]  We're going to get back into the news here in just a second. But first, a message from Alex Jones.
[31:38.000 --> 31:44.000]  Hi, fellow InfoWarriors. Staying on the air during this cancel culture, during this big tech
[31:44.000 --> 31:50.640]  reign of terror has been hard. But thanks to your support, we're still on air. Now, during a globalist
[31:50.640 --> 31:55.360]  engineered collapse, which they're attempting to initiate right now, it's important to have
[31:55.360 --> 31:58.320]  slurable food. It's important to have water filtration. It's important to have a relationship
[31:58.320 --> 32:01.680]  with God, number one. It's important to have friends and family. You can trust it's important
[32:01.680 --> 32:05.920]  to live in a place that's more secure than big cities. But most of us have to still live in big
[32:05.920 --> 32:11.040]  cities. So whether you live in a big city or a rural area, having a satellite phone that the
[32:11.040 --> 32:16.240]  globalist can't track, that they can't trace, that they can't turn off is essential. The cell
[32:16.240 --> 32:22.320]  phone system is a control grid, a surveillance grid for contact tracers, hackers, corrupt government
[32:22.320 --> 32:27.760]  and more. That's why everyone needs a sat phone. And we've got you one of the best deals out there
[32:27.760 --> 32:36.480]  at InfoWarStore.com, a free $600 plus free phone when you sign up for a year for $99.95
[32:36.480 --> 32:43.040]  cents for 150 minutes each month. And here's what's great about it. Everyone can call you
[32:43.680 --> 32:49.760]  from landlines or cell phones unlimited. Calls to you are free. It's only the calls up to the
[32:49.760 --> 32:57.600]  satellite that are going to cost you 150 minutes a month. It's good to start using these. It's good
[32:57.600 --> 33:02.800]  to get your mind in the mindset of survival. I've got one of my car. It works great. I've got the
[33:02.800 --> 33:06.800]  little antenna. You can also get it at InfoWarStore.com. And I've got one in my house. Anywhere you
[33:06.800 --> 33:14.480]  can see the sky, it works. InfoWarStore.com or call 941-955-1020 and ask for the All of Shown Special.
[33:14.480 --> 33:20.400]  That's InfoWarStore.com. Now back to the live transmission out of Austin, Texas at Owen Shroyer.
[33:22.400 --> 33:28.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm debating where to begin here.
[33:28.160 --> 33:34.240]  So let me just pick it back up where I left off with all the positive developments
[33:34.240 --> 33:39.520]  are happening right now with the renaissance, the awakening that we're experiencing. And it's
[33:39.520 --> 33:46.880]  because the New World Order is at their doorstep. And it's because all of this is in their face
[33:46.880 --> 33:56.800]  affecting them now. You cannot deny it. The old excuse of denial or just abstaining from politics
[33:56.800 --> 34:01.200]  is to say, oh, it doesn't affect me. It doesn't affect my life. Well, now everybody sees it.
[34:01.760 --> 34:07.360]  The left or, I mean, the reality is the left has politicized everything, but everything is political
[34:07.360 --> 34:13.120]  now. So now people see how politics affects their life. So they're starting to pay attention.
[34:14.400 --> 34:19.440]  And that's why somebody like Anthony Fauci or Bill Gates is so unpopular now. But look at what's
[34:19.440 --> 34:27.440]  going on with the updated news from the vote audit. Now, again, I'm not going to tell you this is
[34:27.440 --> 34:31.760]  going to result in anything. I'm not going to tell you this is going to turn around the 2020
[34:31.760 --> 34:39.600]  election. I'm not even going to tell you that they're going to be able to prove Trump won.
[34:41.840 --> 34:45.120]  But what it is doing is it's getting people politically active.
[34:45.120 --> 34:51.120]  It has people questioning things, and that's healthy. That's good. But here are the latest
[34:51.600 --> 34:53.760]  from the different states where all the audits are happening.
[34:55.120 --> 35:00.480]  Wyndham, New Hampshire, recount update. Vast difference in audit totals between GOP and
[35:00.480 --> 35:06.640]  DEM candidates is enough evidence to scrap the voting machines. So again, it's like if you have a
[35:06.640 --> 35:13.760]  receipt at the end of the day and you have a cash register and it's the end of the day numbers,
[35:13.760 --> 35:19.440]  new print to receipt, and then you check the numbers and the receipt does not add up to what's
[35:19.440 --> 35:25.280]  in the cash register, something isn't right. That's essentially what they've discovered in
[35:25.920 --> 35:32.480]  Wyndham in New Hampshire, which I believe Trump did win. Only two electoral votes. We don't make
[35:32.480 --> 35:39.120]  a big thing of it. But you know, the Democrats deal everything. In Arizona, data files reportedly
[35:39.120 --> 35:45.440]  deleted in Arizona before providing machines to Senate auditors may have been recovered by
[35:45.440 --> 35:50.000]  the audit team. So they're going to find out if that data that they tried to delete the voter
[35:50.000 --> 35:56.160]  records that they were trying to cross-reference that they deleted, which then Dominion was not
[35:56.160 --> 36:01.920]  cooperating with that investigation, either refused to turn over any intellectual property or
[36:01.920 --> 36:09.840]  passwords or algorithms, nothing would do they have to hide. So the people in Arizona are very
[36:09.840 --> 36:14.480]  serious about this, and there's serious people involved, and they want to prove that Trump won
[36:14.480 --> 36:19.600]  Arizona, or at the very least, many election laws were broken and the voting machines were
[36:19.600 --> 36:27.120]  tampered with, which that's already been proven. Wisconsin officially launches audit of 2020
[36:27.120 --> 36:37.440]  election. So there you go. Now election is going to, Wisconsin is going to audit their election,
[36:37.440 --> 36:42.880]  which of course was the same story that we saw in Pennsylvania, in Georgia, in so many other
[36:42.880 --> 36:48.400]  states where Trump is winning all day long. Trump's having huge margins all day long. Honestly,
[36:48.400 --> 36:53.920]  in any other election, it would have been called for Trump early with the margins he had for victory.
[36:53.920 --> 37:02.240]  But then, magically, in the dark of night, just like in Michigan and Pennsylvania, in the dark of
[37:02.240 --> 37:10.240]  night, magically, Biden goes from 400,000 down to 5,000 up, and then they stop counting. Truly
[37:10.240 --> 37:14.480]  an incredible thing to witness, but now they're going to audit that. So who knows what we'll find
[37:14.480 --> 37:22.080]  there. Michigan voter fraud attorney Matt DiPerno's office broken into. This is the guy who's been
[37:22.080 --> 37:27.520]  leading the charge in Antrim. This is the guy who's shown the faulty voting machines at the least
[37:27.520 --> 37:32.800]  in Antrim. This is the individual who showed how they were flipping votes from Biden, or excuse
[37:32.800 --> 37:38.720]  me, from Trump to Biden in the voting machines. This has all been proven in Antrim County, and the
[37:38.720 --> 37:44.400]  audit continues, and now this individual is being threatened, and he's had his offices broken into.
[37:44.400 --> 37:53.280]  I'm sure that's just a coincidence. Back to New Hampshire. Forensic election audit update,
[37:53.280 --> 37:58.640]  assistant attorney general seen walking toward table covered with secured ballots at 11.15 pm
[37:58.640 --> 38:10.000]  before camera footage went out for an hour. I mean, let's just think about this.
[38:10.000 --> 38:16.080]  I mean, I'm no criminal investigator. I'm not a detective or anything here, but you know,
[38:16.640 --> 38:24.000]  let's just say I got a case in front of me. No, let's talk about Pennsylvania maybe, or Michigan.
[38:24.000 --> 38:34.400]  It's the same case, both both both areas. And I'm just doing a forensic audit of the numbers.
[38:34.400 --> 38:42.480]  And I say, hmm, Trump is winning all day long, all day long, by hundreds of thousands of votes.
[38:42.480 --> 38:47.680]  Any other year, they would call that a victory by midnight. But they didn't. And then right at
[38:47.680 --> 38:51.280]  midnight, just hundreds of thousands of votes come pouring in for Biden, and then they stopped counting.
[38:52.640 --> 38:56.160]  And I'm just reviewing some of the footage. And I say, okay, let me look at some of the
[38:56.160 --> 39:00.160]  security footage. Where are all the doors here? Oh, we got some doors in the back. Yeah, let's go
[39:00.160 --> 39:05.840]  ahead and look at that. And you're just reviewing the footage and then right at midnight, you know,
[39:05.840 --> 39:13.120]  stop the tape, stop it, stop it, you're watching it, stop, stop. And you see truckloads of ballots
[39:14.160 --> 39:19.040]  being unloaded right before the hundreds of thousands magically come in for Biden.
[39:19.040 --> 39:25.760]  Truckloads. Again, you don't have to be a genius to say that suspicious activity worthy of an
[39:25.760 --> 39:34.000]  investigation. No, no, no. In New Hampshire, though, right before midnight, again, it's the same
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.240]  timing, right, right at, right around midnight. Assistant Attorney General walks towards the
[39:40.240 --> 39:45.440]  ballot, the ballot boxes where all the ballots are. And then the security footage goes out for an
[39:45.440 --> 39:50.160]  hour. And then the security footage comes back and Trump's losing all of a sudden. I mean, whoa.
[39:50.160 --> 39:56.320]  Again, I'm not a big criminal investigator here. I'm no special detective. I'm not
[39:56.320 --> 40:06.400]  Sherlock Holmes, but that's a little suspicious. Isn't it? Oh, you're getting audited in Maricopa
[40:06.400 --> 40:11.520]  County. Can we have your algorithms? Can we have the data? You can't have our algorithms and we
[40:11.520 --> 40:21.280]  deleted the data. I'm sorry, what? Yeah, you heard me. You cannot have our algorithms and we've
[40:21.280 --> 40:32.560]  deleted the data. Hmm. Again, I'm no Sherlock Troyer up here, but that seems like you're
[40:34.320 --> 40:38.080]  trying to erase evidence of a crime. I mean, I don't know. I don't want to jump to any
[40:38.080 --> 40:43.120]  conclusions here, but with all the evidence that's just anecdotally available just for
[40:43.120 --> 40:51.120]  the public to see, boy, there seems to be a massive cover up of voter fraud and a stolen
[40:51.120 --> 40:56.720]  election. And it's so obvious America is finally seeing it and it's a it's red alert red flag.
[40:57.920 --> 41:02.480]  I'm not going to say this five times in a row to be obnoxious. I'm saying it because it's the key
[41:02.480 --> 41:09.920]  to victory over these criminals. Last week, the arch globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half
[41:09.920 --> 41:16.000]  of the CDC's top brass and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it,
[41:16.000 --> 41:21.840]  have taken the so-called COVID-19 frankenshot. I'm going to say the second time. Around half
[41:21.840 --> 41:30.560]  of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the frankenshots. They don't trust it. You
[41:30.560 --> 41:34.880]  shouldn't trust it. The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world. This is an
[41:34.880 --> 41:40.400]  attack on the American people and the people of the world. This is an absolute red flag
[41:40.400 --> 41:46.080]  smoking gun. Again, let me say it two more times. Around half of the individuals that work at the
[41:46.080 --> 41:51.440]  NIH and CDC, the medical staff refused to take the vaccines. That's right. The doctors, nurses,
[41:51.440 --> 41:55.680]  and scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine and you shouldn't either. And you should want
[41:55.680 --> 42:00.240]  everyone to know about the truth. People keep asking me, Alex, how did you predict over a year
[42:00.240 --> 42:04.720]  ago that food prices would explode within a year? Because within all the globalist actuaries that
[42:04.720 --> 42:09.600]  you shut down most of the world for a year, it's going to cause a collapse in food production
[42:09.600 --> 42:14.720]  and distribution. And not just that. Fuel and every other major commodity. The globalist want
[42:14.720 --> 42:18.880]  to post-industrial world, they're hitting us with economic war. I told you food prices would
[42:18.880 --> 42:23.600]  explode. They're now exploding. Our great sponsor, my patriot, has barely gone up in price. Their
[42:23.600 --> 42:28.000]  competitors have gone up even more, but they're about to go up in two weeks. But instead of just
[42:28.000 --> 42:33.440]  holding prices, they're still 10% off until Sunday evening, and then it's got to go up.
[42:33.440 --> 42:40.960]  10% off at infowarstore.com, 2020 prices in the year 2021. But you've got to act now and
[42:40.960 --> 42:46.320]  buy your food from us, funds the M4 war, a 360 win. It's ready to ship. They've got it on hand.
[42:46.320 --> 42:51.120]  Get yours before the scarcity and the lion's start, which I think we'll see by next fall.
[42:51.120 --> 42:55.040]  Hell, a lot of shelves are already empty. This is crazy. We're being collapsed by design.
[42:55.040 --> 43:01.440]  Get ready now. Prepare with Alex.com. One of the most common questions I get on air,
[43:01.440 --> 43:07.440]  but also off air when I'm just out and about is, Alex, what do I say to my family about the
[43:07.440 --> 43:13.040]  vaccines? How do I warn them? Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it. So many
[43:13.040 --> 43:17.200]  facts. It's the history of contaminated vaccines, the fact that they have liability protection in
[43:17.200 --> 43:22.400]  the US and Europe, the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses
[43:22.400 --> 43:27.600]  of other things to vaccines and the whole history of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of
[43:27.600 --> 43:32.960]  poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans. The list goes on and on. But what about the fact that
[43:32.960 --> 43:40.720]  Fauci testified to Congress and so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021 that around half
[43:40.720 --> 43:46.240]  of the NIH CDC staff, medical doctors, neurologist, scientists have refused to take the vaccine,
[43:46.240 --> 43:50.640]  although they could say, yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it.
[43:50.640 --> 43:53.280]  That's the same thing in the private practices out there, similar numbers,
[43:53.280 --> 43:57.120]  that that's not something I'm going to be taking. That's very, very simple. There's your answer.
[43:58.480 --> 44:05.440]  Scientists agree magnesium is the most important cofactor in the body, regulating and controlling
[44:05.440 --> 44:11.760]  hundreds of pathways. Magnesium is required for your body to do the following, helps convert
[44:11.760 --> 44:17.920]  food into energy, helps with muscle contraction function, helps regulate the nervous system,
[44:17.920 --> 44:23.360]  helps with protein building in the muscles, and so much more. And now it's available
[44:23.360 --> 44:30.080]  in this concentrated form of ionized, fizzy magnesium. It tastes great. I take it the morning.
[44:30.080 --> 44:35.920]  I take it in the evening. It is so essential in my life. And I hope all of you will check it out
[44:35.920 --> 44:42.160]  and try it. It's available at infostore.com right now. This is the best formula from our research
[44:42.160 --> 44:46.320]  you're going to find out there. So if you've already enjoyed other magnesium formulas,
[44:46.320 --> 44:50.320]  give this one a try. I think you're going to love it at the same time it funds the M4,
[44:50.320 --> 45:18.080]  which is a true 360 win. Now exclusively available at infostore.com for only $19.95.
[45:18.080 --> 45:22.000]  I'll go back here to the Alex Jones show. Oh, and Troy are sitting in for Alex. And you know,
[45:22.000 --> 45:27.120]  here's here's what I've realized. And this is why it really is so important to be a good person
[45:27.840 --> 45:35.200]  and to lead by example and to ask for God's guidance and wisdom in that journey. Because
[45:37.920 --> 45:41.920]  call it karma, whatever you want. It's an ancient thing. Everybody knows it's true.
[45:41.920 --> 45:51.920]  The metaphysics of the universe. And what what what the new world order, what the left,
[45:51.920 --> 45:59.520]  what has been done is they've created an impossible standard that nobody could even come close to.
[45:59.520 --> 46:04.880]  But but more importantly, they could never come close to. But now that all the people that they
[46:04.880 --> 46:09.760]  were putting the standard up there so that they would fall short are now gone. Trump's gone,
[46:09.760 --> 46:15.040]  info wars gone, all the people. So now they're the only ones left in the arena to be held up to
[46:15.040 --> 46:18.720]  the standard. And of course, they're not going to make it. Nobody could make it. So everybody's
[46:18.720 --> 46:23.600]  figuring out, Oh, Bill Gates. And now it's he had multiple relationships outside of his marriage.
[46:23.600 --> 46:30.640]  And he was harassing women to at Microsoft. Oh my gosh. And apparently they all knew about him
[46:30.640 --> 46:36.400]  with Epstein to that's why he had to get off the board. And that's why Melinda Gates was
[46:36.400 --> 46:46.240]  trying to divorce him. I mean, so so this is the real deal. And just wait until until all of us
[46:46.240 --> 46:55.120]  unite on Fauci and the disgust and the disdain that we have for him, because the left is going
[46:55.120 --> 46:59.920]  to have to realize that they hated Fauci before anybody else did. They just forgot back in the
[46:59.920 --> 47:06.720]  eighties. And a new an old story is going viral again. Old news is new news.
[47:07.920 --> 47:13.200]  That was written to Fauci, accusing him of being a murderer in the eighties.
[47:14.640 --> 47:18.640]  So, you know, history repeats itself. You don't know your history, you're doing to repeat it.
[47:18.640 --> 47:22.560]  So we're experiencing all this. But
[47:22.560 --> 47:30.480]  they set the standard of Oh, rigged elections for interference. So okay, fine, you created that
[47:30.480 --> 47:38.480]  hysteria. Now Republicans are responding in a similar matter, actually doing the audit and
[47:38.480 --> 47:42.720]  we're discovering Yeah, there was voter fraud. So that was an impossible standard. That was
[47:42.720 --> 47:47.120]  something the mainstream media put up there. Now that it's going to be exposed. Oh, wait,
[47:47.120 --> 47:52.080]  the real voter fraud, the real election interference was all being done by the criminals that run the
[47:52.080 --> 47:58.800]  Democrat Party. Ah, oh, the real abuse of women, oh, the real mistreatment of women,
[47:58.800 --> 48:03.040]  oh, the real harassment, the sex trafficking. Oh, that was all done by the globalist. That was
[48:03.040 --> 48:15.520]  all done by liberals. Oh, but see, we can only cash in on this metaphysical investment, this karma,
[48:15.520 --> 48:22.800]  if we're good people, if we truly try to live the Christian ethos or just be a good person.
[48:22.800 --> 48:25.680]  Everybody knows what that means. Morals, whatever, it's in your conscious.
[48:28.880 --> 48:32.560]  But so now you can sit here and you can watch all of your enemies decay
[48:33.920 --> 48:39.120]  because you're not decaying because you protected yourself. You asked for God's protection.
[48:39.120 --> 48:47.280]  You asked for the Holy Spirit. You asked for Jesus Christ. And so there will be a reckoning
[48:48.560 --> 48:54.400]  and it may get worse. Who knows when you can say, Hey, look, this is the evidence we've really turned
[48:54.400 --> 49:03.120]  the corner. But when you've got anybody who's logically thinking can now obviously see that
[49:03.120 --> 49:07.200]  they've been duped, there's obviously a criminal shadow government running things,
[49:07.200 --> 49:11.440]  Fauci's involved, Gates is involved, all the things they can plan about me to movement.
[49:11.440 --> 49:14.080]  They're not interested anymore because it's all the Democrats and the liberals that are
[49:14.080 --> 49:21.760]  harassing and abusing and raping women. And all the rich white people that they hate all are Democrats.
[49:24.320 --> 49:27.760]  So you can't put these, you can't put these genius back in the bottle.
[49:28.640 --> 49:34.720]  The paper trail of Fauci on the Wuhan lab is not going to go away. And eventually people
[49:34.720 --> 49:38.240]  are going to remember because here's the other thing too. It is a five minutes of hate type of
[49:38.240 --> 49:45.040]  thing where as soon as the left has Fauci put on that board in front of them for the five minutes
[49:45.040 --> 49:56.400]  of hate, they'll hate Fauci and he's already been there. But on the other side of that coin,
[49:56.400 --> 49:58.160]  because there's always two sides to every coin,
[49:58.160 --> 50:06.800]  this just means that all the agendas are going to be pressed even harder. So yeah,
[50:06.800 --> 50:11.600]  we're coming out of this fake pandemic. And of course, Biden and the Democrats are going to
[50:11.600 --> 50:17.920]  try to take credit. But you can tell they're still trying to keep their hooks in it with the vaccines.
[50:17.920 --> 50:23.520]  Oh, we're scared if not everybody gets vaccines, still wear the mask and all of this stuff because
[50:23.520 --> 50:27.840]  they still have to keep a couple hooks in you. So that they can just pull you back in
[50:27.840 --> 50:36.160]  whenever they want. But if they were intellectually honest with themselves,
[50:38.160 --> 50:43.040]  they would see the folly of their ways. And that's why logical people are starting to get it.
[50:45.600 --> 50:54.640]  Why would doctors at the NIH or the NIH, the other one that Fauci runs,
[50:54.640 --> 51:00.480]  why would they be refusing to take the vaccine? Why wouldn't they all take the vaccine?
[51:02.400 --> 51:05.600]  Why aren't they taking the vaccine? They said it's safe. They said it's effective.
[51:05.600 --> 51:11.040]  They told all of us to take it. Why aren't they taking it? This is common sense stuff.
[51:12.800 --> 51:16.880]  They're not taking it because either they know it's deadly, they know it doesn't work,
[51:16.880 --> 51:25.200]  or they're not afraid of COVID. Pick your poison. Or maybe all of the above.
[51:26.080 --> 51:30.480]  So why do you have to take it? Why can't you fly on an airplane unless you take it?
[51:30.480 --> 51:33.120]  Why is the media telling you to still be in panic, for example?
[51:34.240 --> 51:38.320]  Now, look, it's almost not even fair to do this because these are mental patients.
[51:38.960 --> 51:41.920]  And we really shouldn't even be addressing these mental patients. We should be sending
[51:41.920 --> 51:47.200]  them to mental hospitals and hoping they get help. But instead, they're on MSNBC hosting TV shows.
[51:47.200 --> 51:52.560]  So we have to address them. MSNBC's mental patient host, Rachel Maddow,
[51:52.560 --> 51:57.600]  reveals she's terrified. She's a mental patient. I mean, they're not even hiding it anymore.
[51:57.600 --> 52:03.840]  I mean, seriously, they are completely uncloaked at this point. They are mental patients. They
[52:03.840 --> 52:09.280]  roll their videos recruiting people for the CIA and the military where they admit
[52:09.280 --> 52:16.720]  they're mental patients. We have studies. 38% of liberals have been diagnosed with a mental
[52:16.720 --> 52:22.640]  condition. We have studies where you just run factual numbers and you identify a Democrat
[52:22.640 --> 52:27.760]  or Republican voter. And the Democrats think 10,000 Black people die a year from cops unarmed.
[52:28.960 --> 52:33.280]  So we literally have all the forensic analysis, all the data, everything.
[52:33.280 --> 52:40.800]  Leftist progressive liberals are mentally impaired. They have a mental disorder and they can't even
[52:40.800 --> 52:46.880]  hide it anymore. And they're hoping that they can judo move that into some sort of new sympathy
[52:46.880 --> 52:53.120]  in the victim economy and then dominate you. But no, you won't be a victim. And you won't
[52:53.120 --> 53:01.520]  be subservient to mental patients crying victimhood. So excuse me, but back to the story.
[53:01.520 --> 53:06.080]  Rachel Maddow reveals she's terrified of unvaccinated people and unmasked people and
[53:06.080 --> 53:15.120]  considers them a threat. Why? So is the vaccine safe and effective? If the vaccine works, what are
[53:15.120 --> 53:21.120]  you afraid of? If the mask works, what are you afraid of? What they're afraid of is that they
[53:21.120 --> 53:26.800]  can't dominate you. What they're afraid of is that they can't control you or they don't yet
[53:26.800 --> 53:32.480]  have total control over you. That's what they're afraid of. Rachel Maddow wants to be able to go
[53:32.480 --> 53:37.280]  on TV and tell you, you have to wear a mask and you have to take a vaccine and then you have to do
[53:37.280 --> 53:42.720]  it. That's what Rachel Maddow wants. And anything short of that terrifies her because she's a
[53:42.720 --> 53:48.080]  totalitarian tyrant. But that's actually being kind. She couldn't even consciously work that on
[53:48.080 --> 53:54.160]  her head. She's a mental patient is what she is. She's a psychotic mental patient. But I should
[53:54.160 --> 53:59.840]  digress from that mental patient and on to the next one. Of course, this woman is actually a
[53:59.840 --> 54:11.200]  Chinese agent of propaganda, a Chinese agent provocateur, a CNN doctor, Leanna Wen. She says
[54:11.200 --> 54:16.560]  she doesn't feel safe around unmasked people in stores and demands vaccine passports because
[54:16.560 --> 54:21.200]  other people are going on TV Tuesday. Guess what? People are going to lie about getting the vaccine.
[54:21.200 --> 54:28.480]  Oh, because we don't want to be slaves. Go figure. I mean, slavery unpopular, breaking news on CNN,
[54:28.480 --> 54:34.960]  breaking news MSNBC, slavery unpopular. Americans don't want to be slaves. And this terrifies them.
[54:38.240 --> 54:43.040]  And they say it with a smile. I think everybody should be vaccinated and have a vaccine card
[54:43.040 --> 54:47.200]  just so we can get back to normal and be free again. She says with a smile like the demonic
[54:47.200 --> 54:53.680]  snake that she is. What's worse? I consider it much worse. If you're going to deliver evil to me,
[54:53.680 --> 54:58.400]  I want you to at least look and act like a demon. I respect that. If you're going to deliver evil
[54:58.400 --> 55:05.120]  to me with a smile, there's something else that turns inside of me. There's something else. There's
[55:05.120 --> 55:11.600]  a whole nother demeanor to it. There's a whole nother taste, a whole nother flavor. It's immediate
[55:11.600 --> 55:19.680]  nausea inducing. So the vaccine works. I got the vaccine, but I'm still scared to death.
[55:20.240 --> 55:24.800]  The mask works and I wear the mask, but I'm still scared to death. I got a vaccine and a mask and
[55:24.800 --> 55:33.440]  I'm still scared to death. What is it that you want? And then half or less than half of all
[55:33.440 --> 55:38.480]  of these government bureaucracies, the FDA, the NIH, all of the employees are refusing the vaccine
[55:38.480 --> 55:42.160]  because they're not afraid of COVID. They know it doesn't work or they know it's deadly.
[55:42.160 --> 55:47.520]  Four all three of the above. So go listen to a mental patient on CNN or MSNBC. They'll tell
[55:47.520 --> 55:53.600]  you what's up. Warning, warning, warning. The globalists have launched a massive counter offensive
[55:53.600 --> 55:58.400]  against populist forces worldwide. They are censoring. They are attacking. They are arresting
[55:58.400 --> 56:04.080]  patriots all over the world. Churches in Europe, Australia, the UK and Canada, and even California,
[56:04.080 --> 56:10.880]  New York are being swat teamed and closed because they're non-essential. The tyranny is incredible,
[56:10.880 --> 56:15.680]  but in areas like Texas and South Dakota and Florida, where we have a history of more liberty,
[56:15.680 --> 56:21.520]  all the lockdowns are over, ladies and gentlemen. This is martial law. This has all been a massive
[56:21.520 --> 56:26.240]  martial law drill. And now it's more important than ever to spread the word about info wars
[56:26.240 --> 56:30.320]  and to support info wars. We have three of our best selling products selling out, but despite
[56:30.320 --> 56:37.360]  that, they're all massively discounted. Turbo force, it's 40% off. We've got ultimate fish oil,
[56:37.360 --> 56:42.320]  50% off, and winter sun for your immune system. It's 50% off as well. Best deal ever,
[56:42.320 --> 56:46.480]  take advantage of it at infowarstore.com and fund the info war.
[56:49.520 --> 56:54.640]  Two weeks ago, I launched a sale on all the high quality storeable foods and prepare with
[56:54.640 --> 57:00.320]  Alex.com. And I pointed out that the Bloomberg global food index shows that current crop purchases
[57:00.320 --> 57:06.000]  being made for the end of the summer when the crops are completed around the world is up 76%.
[57:06.480 --> 57:11.360]  That alone will cause civil unrest, major problems. Since then, inflation has exploded
[57:11.360 --> 57:15.360]  the last two weeks. You've seen the pipeline crises, you've seen Governor Whitmer shutting down
[57:15.360 --> 57:19.680]  or trying to shut up the pipeline in Michigan. This is a concerted operation. And so Listers had
[57:19.680 --> 57:26.400]  a huge response to our big sale 2020 prices in the year 2021. 10% off all storeable foods,
[57:26.400 --> 57:30.720]  prepare with Alex.com. Now the sale ended yesterday, so I'm now because a lot of requests
[57:30.720 --> 57:36.640]  extending it through Sunday and that it absolutely has to end. So one month, three months, six months,
[57:36.640 --> 57:41.600]  your supplies, highest quality water filters, and so much more. Prepare with Alex.com. It's the best
[57:41.600 --> 57:45.360]  tool you're going to find on high quality storeable food for you and your family and your community.
[57:45.360 --> 57:53.760]  Get ready now. Prepare with Alex.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:05.200 --> 58:11.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, as we warned you, Joe Biden is
[58:11.040 --> 58:17.680]  resending many of Trump's executive orders. It's the ones that he shouldn't, obviously, but he is.
[58:19.200 --> 58:24.400]  For example, he's getting rid of the Garden of American Heroes because he would want anything
[58:24.400 --> 58:30.880]  like that. He is getting rid of the Protecting American Monuments, memorials and statues. That
[58:30.880 --> 58:38.080]  way his voters can go out and criminally destroy them. He is getting rid of one that Trump signed,
[58:38.080 --> 58:41.920]  which is trying to really begin a snowball down a mountain. It wasn't that harsh, but it was just
[58:41.920 --> 58:46.960]  trying to get it the ball rolling against the online censorship. Biden scrapped that as well.
[58:48.080 --> 58:51.920]  Trump's executive order titled rebranding United States foreign assistance to advance America's
[58:51.920 --> 58:55.920]  influence has also been tossed. That's just trying to get a little bit hold of the foreign aid that
[58:55.920 --> 59:00.320]  we're giving out. It's just totally out of control. Now we're actually, I'll cover this later,
[59:00.320 --> 59:04.160]  we also give all the foreign aid to Israel. Now we're giving foreign aid to Palestine too,
[59:04.160 --> 59:08.160]  so we're funding both sides of that war again. That's always fun to do, isn't it? Funding both sides
[59:08.160 --> 59:11.680]  of wars that we're not even really involved with. It's just great how they just steal our money.
[59:11.680 --> 59:20.080]  Biden's into that too, so he's doing that. He also scrapped an executive order that made any
[59:20.080 --> 59:24.080]  potential immigrant to the U.S. provide assurance that they would not be a financial burden on
[59:24.080 --> 59:30.960]  America when they got here. There's Biden killing America a bunch of small cuts at a time,
[59:30.960 --> 59:35.040]  and then of course huge gashes too, and then huge stabs in your neck, and then trying to impale you
[59:35.040 --> 59:40.320]  on a stake. I mean anyway, he'd kill you really. That's the Democrat party. But again, America
[59:40.320 --> 59:46.240]  is waking up. This video is going viral in individuals at a gas station in his neighborhood.
[59:46.240 --> 59:52.640]  I'm guessing this is a Democrat run in our city, and he gives the people around this gas station
[59:52.640 --> 59:56.160]  the how to and the what for. We had to censure this, a lot of cussing, but we censored it. We
[59:56.160 --> 1:00:22.560]  believe it's worth your viewing, and so here it is. People are harassing him as he's doing this
[1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:30.160]  video.
[1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:57.760]  Just sitting around like sheep, goofy ass sheep. All they can do is wait. All they can do is wait.
[1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:06.480]  All they can do is wait. All they can do is wait. The Democrats saw something. They got a green new
[1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:12.640]  deal for 2030, green new deal. You ain't got no plans for everything to run off electricity in
[1:01:12.640 --> 1:01:16.560]  ten years. You do got to plan to f**k up everything within the next ten years, but you
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:22.560]  there, you ain't got no plan for it to run off electricity in the next ten years. You got to plan
[1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:33.200]  to f**k up everything within the next ten years. I want to f**k up Trump back. It's stupid. Everybody
[1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:37.920]  had a lot to say when Trump was in the White House. Anybody got s**t to say with this f**king
[1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:43.120]  old-ass bum in there, f**king up our f**king country, f**king up the economy. These motherf**kers
[1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:47.760]  projected that we were going to have a million new jobs, 200,000 new jobs. And where the f**k are
[1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:51.920]  they at? Probably 200,000 illegal immigrants that you motherf**ker signed up at the board
[1:01:51.920 --> 1:02:01.360]  have got new jobs, but we don't. We're hurting and immersed. Everybody quiet. Where the f**k are
[1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:06.960]  the Joe Biden supporters? I can tell y'all why I support Trump. Tell me why y'all support this
[1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:14.320]  motherf**ker. Ain't doing s**t, but f**king this up every day, f**king this up.
[1:02:18.800 --> 1:02:24.320]  So again, this individual just at the crowded gas station that's almost completely out of gas.
[1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:28.000]  Most of the pumps shut down. Two pumps still running. Huge lines out the door. He's walking
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:35.200]  around in his Trump hat. And so it's just a matter of people need to realize they've been duped by
[1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:38.720]  the media. That's really what it is. Oh, and by the way, maybe they're realizing they were duped
[1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:43.680]  by the Democrats too. Joe Biden diverts healthcare cash to help illegal immigrants. So once again,
[1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:50.320]  money that's not going to Americans, money that's going to non-citizens to invade this country
[1:02:50.320 --> 1:02:54.960]  and steal everything from you. So that's what the Democrats are all about. But people are waking up,
[1:02:54.960 --> 1:03:01.200]  maybe. Listen up, patriots. I'm running a sale that's the biggest I've ever run on three products
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:06.480]  that are already selling out. Well, then why am I selling it then at 50% off or 60% off depending
[1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:10.400]  on which sale you go with? Because I know a lot of you are on the fence. You haven't tried it,
[1:03:10.400 --> 1:03:16.480]  and I know you're going to get hooked once you do. So for one week only, we're running 50% off
[1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:22.560]  on ultimate fish oil, 50% off on winter sun with D3 and KF3 immune system. And oh my gosh,
[1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:27.120]  people love this so much. We've sold out for months back in limited supply. Turbo force, 10 hour,
[1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:33.760]  clean energy is 40% off. But you can get them all three together in the optimum trifecta pack
[1:03:33.760 --> 1:03:39.280]  for 60% off. We've never offered that on these products. It's basically a lost leader. I want
[1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:43.040]  you to get them. I want you to try them. I want you to love them. So believe me, you're going to
[1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:48.880]  be a blown away. Go to infowarstore.com. We're running this Monday through Sunday and the deal
[1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:58.880]  is over. Best deal ever, take advantage of it at infowarstore.com and fund the Info War.

[1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:08.880]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:22.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, every day info wars is on the air is a victory for free speech.
[1:04:23.520 --> 1:04:28.160]  Free speech is under complete assault by the Democrat Party and the big tech tyrants.
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:36.640]  But just us being on air is a victory. So I salute this audience and I raise my
[1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:45.520]  ceramic mug full of coffee to you and I salute free speech and I salute this audience for keeping
[1:04:45.520 --> 1:04:51.920]  us on air. God bless you and God speed in the info war and we will drink our info wars coffee

[1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:06.800]  available at infowarstore.com and ladies and gentlemen, we would really not be on air if it
[1:05:06.800 --> 1:05:15.520]  was not for your support. Now Alex is on vacation but the guy can't get away and so
[1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:22.080]  he needs to cut new specials but he's trying to take a vacation. Now the good news for you is
[1:05:22.080 --> 1:05:26.720]  that that means the specials from this last week are going to continue at least through tonight.
[1:05:26.720 --> 1:05:33.920]  So that means some of the big discounts we have on the supplements that you've been seeing for
[1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:38.400]  the last week are going to stay there at least for the rest of the night but the big one that you
[1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:43.840]  would want to take advantage of if you haven't yet still have 10% off the 2020 prices for
[1:05:43.840 --> 1:05:48.880]  storable food. So we still have the 2020 prices at infowarstore.com as the food prices are going
[1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:56.080]  up and then we have the sale right now. 10% off the emergency food prices right now at info

[1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:20.560]  If you don't have storable food what are you waiting for? You're seeing food prices skyrocket
[1:06:20.560 --> 1:06:28.960]  that's by design and unless something drastic happens I don't see that turning around. Biden's
[1:06:28.960 --> 1:06:32.480]  still in the White House the Democrats are still in control and they have an agenda to
[1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:38.880]  wreck and destroy this country destroy the American middle class destroy our supply chain
[1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:45.280]  everything and they are just beginning. So take advantage of infowarstore.com 10% off emergency
[1:06:45.280 --> 1:06:56.480]  food sale before it's too late. Now let's get back into the news. So it's all coming out.
[1:06:57.840 --> 1:07:05.760]  Bill Gates, Jeffrey Epstein looks like they had a nice cozy relationship
[1:07:06.960 --> 1:07:12.320]  and it looks like people were well aware of what Bill Gates was up to on Epstein Island
[1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:18.800]  before any of this came out as well as inside the company apparently Gates with Microsoft
[1:07:18.800 --> 1:07:23.280]  employees and so now that news is coming out. So here are the latest headlines there.
[1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:29.920]  Microsoft board members wanted Gates gone in 2019 after investigation into sexual
[1:07:29.920 --> 1:07:37.520]  relationship and that was within the company. The investigation conducted in 2019 was launched
[1:07:37.520 --> 1:07:42.560]  after the woman in question a Microsoft engineer blew the whistle over a years long sexual
[1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:46.960]  relationship she had with Gates right around this time that Gates relationship with notorious
[1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:52.400]  pedophile Jeffrey Epstein had spilled into the public sphere and Melinda Gates began exploring
[1:07:52.400 --> 1:08:01.520]  divorce. So there you go. Now is this a case of don't get me wrong Bill Gates to me is among
[1:08:01.520 --> 1:08:06.400]  the worst people on earth but see this is what I was talking about earlier they've set a standard
[1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:10.640]  that nobody could live up to so obviously Bill Gates was sleeping around on his wife and doing
[1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:17.360]  God knows what with Epstein and he's having this affair with this lady maybe they maybe they had
[1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:22.000]  something good you know maybe it was there was coercion there but the point is this was going
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:25.760]  on for years why does she want to blow the whistle now why is it a problem now because
[1:08:25.760 --> 1:08:31.280]  they set a standard that they could never live up to and so now it's just easy it's just easy
[1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:35.760]  for any woman to come forward and say yeah I was having this affair he's a bad guy
[1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:38.560]  maybe she it was mutual maybe it wasn't I don't know but the point is
[1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:43.760]  you're not allowed to have any relationships with with men and women at work you're not even
[1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:49.440]  allowed to look at a woman like that at work this is their standard and it's harassment if you do
[1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:56.800]  and so yeah you had Harvey Weinstein who was obviously despicable but they ignored it for years
[1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:00.960]  but now that's the standard they've created Bill Gates has fallen short
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:06.720]  Bill Gates was reportedly removed from the Microsoft Board for an alleged affair with a
[1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:14.080]  Microsoft employee Gates and Epstein traded advice on Bill's toxic marriage
[1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:23.600]  Jeff's pedo image rehab during secret men's club gatherings
[1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:28.720]  when is it going to come out about the Epstein Bill Gates clones
[1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:35.680]  when are we going to know what scientists and engineers were working in New Mexico
[1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:42.480]  with Jeffrey Epstein how much involvement did Bill Gates have what do we know about that activity
[1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:50.320]  when will that come out does Epstein have a smarter friend with access to more resources
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:57.920]  and technology than Bill Gates I don't know but Epstein was a run run in the clone facility
[1:09:57.920 --> 1:10:02.400]  and apparently had a tight relationship with Gates Jeffrey Epstein gave marital advice to Bill Gates
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:09.680]  as Pear joked and laughed about his toxic relationship to Melinda and this was the men's
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:14.560]  club that happened at Epstein's New York City home so Bill Gates was hanging out on pedophile
[1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:20.720]  express airplane pedophile island and in Epstein's New York City um pedophile lodge
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:29.760]  so there you go boy oh boy I'm telling you man seriously
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:38.160]  there's final headline the dirt piles in on Gates following divorce announcement all right so
[1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:43.520]  and by the way Bill Gates and Ted Turner who tell you they want to get the human population
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:49.360]  down to zero on Ted talks they're the two largest farmland owners in the United States of America
[1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:53.760]  so you may want to know about these guys so but can you imagine
[1:10:56.400 --> 1:11:02.880]  what what is Bill Gates up to now Bill Gates was at once considered the richest man in America
[1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:08.320]  maybe he is maybe he isn't but everybody knows about Bill Gates everybody knows about his power
[1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:15.200]  but but now it's beyond just the power from his technology it's it's all the power that's been
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:23.520]  derived from buying up scientists buying up news coverage just buying anything he wants buying access
[1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:32.080]  and then he somehow has the influence not just in America but across the world
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:37.840]  to force vaccinate people and again I tell this story a lot but it used to be you know the Gates
[1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:42.080]  Foundation would show up in Africa with the vaccines and people would run to their tents and
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:47.040]  facilities begging for health treatment now the Gates Foundation shows up and they run for the
[1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:54.800]  woods they run from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation now but this is the same guy who's
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:12:00.000]  been on tv for an entire year lined you about a pandemic lined you about a virus telling you to
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:05.360]  wear a mask telling you to make take a vaccine that doesn't work with gain of function research
[1:12:05.360 --> 1:12:12.640]  that he knew about with vaccines that he wants to influence and even wants to get his own technology
[1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:19.440]  in there and now it's coming out this is the same guy he's running around with Jeffrey Epstein
[1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:23.680]  he's running around on the pedophile express he's running around on pedophile island he's
[1:12:23.680 --> 1:12:28.080]  running around at pedophile lodge doing all these activities with Epstein what involvement did he
[1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:34.640]  have in New Mexico on Epstein's ranch because it doesn't just end on the plane on the island
[1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:44.400]  in the lodge that's not where this story ends but so imagine though again Bill Gates Microsoft
[1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:50.480]  richest man on earth all this influence influence over the health influence over the world and now
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:58.480]  it comes out this guy was just another uh disgusting creep that in any other circumstance the mainstream
[1:12:58.480 --> 1:13:05.040]  media would be destroying right now cheating on his wife having year-long affairs having affairs
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:11.280]  with Microsoft employees having affairs with Jeffrey Epstein where's the me too movement
[1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:20.640]  where's the liberal left so the reckoning is coming the reckoning is coming for Gates the
[1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:29.920]  reckoning is coming for Fauci how can they land this ship okay so i mean the the globalists are
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:34.800]  on an airplane one of the wings is completely blown off the other engine is is fire coming out of it
[1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:41.200]  and they got to try to land this ship but it's all coming out with Bill Gates and and i'll get into
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:50.640]  Fauci a little bit later uh Larry Kramer in 1988 called Anthony Fauci a murderer well i guess since
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:58.800]  he was never locked up he decided to murder again didn't he scientist agree magnesium is the most
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:05.520]  important co-factor in the body regulating and controlling hundreds of pathways magnesium is
[1:14:05.520 --> 1:14:12.160]  required for your body to do the following helps convert food into energy helps with muscle
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:18.080]  contraction function helps regulate the nervous system helps with protein building in the muscles
[1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:25.120]  and so much more and now it's available in this concentrated form of ionized fizzy magnesium
[1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:32.080]  it tastes great i take it the morning i take it the evening it is so essential in my life and i hope
[1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:37.920]  all of you will check it out and try it it's available at infowarstore.com right now this is
[1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:42.240]  the best formula from our research you're going to find out there so if you've already enjoyed
[1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:46.800]  other magnesium formulas give this one a try i think you're going to love it at the same time
[1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:53.600]  it funds the info war which is a true 360 win now exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[1:14:53.600 --> 1:15:00.160]  for only 1995 i'm not going to say this five times in a row to be obnoxious i'm saying it
[1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:06.400]  because it's the key to victory over these criminals last week the arch globalist Fauci admitted
[1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:13.840]  that roughly half of the cdc's top brass and workers medical doctors scientists nurses you name
[1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:20.480]  it have taken the so-called COVID-19 frankenshot i'm gonna say the second time around half of the
[1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:29.200]  doctors at the cdc and nih refused to take the frankenshots they don't trust it you shouldn't
[1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:33.840]  trust it the vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world this is an attack
[1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:39.920]  on the american people the people of the world this is an absolute red flag smoking gun again
[1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:45.760]  let me say it two more times around half the individuals that work at the niasian cdc the
[1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:50.640]  medical staff refused to take the vaccines that's right the doctors nurses and scientists do not
[1:15:50.640 --> 1:16:01.840]  trust a so-called vaccine and you shouldn't either you should everyone you know about the truth
[1:16:21.040 --> 1:16:31.840]  so
[1:16:42.560 --> 1:16:47.760]  we're back here on the alex jones show oh and shroy are sitting in for alex we will be hearing
[1:16:47.760 --> 1:16:55.360]  from alex again before the end of today's transmission talk of days and before i get into
[1:16:55.360 --> 1:17:04.640]  the letter to fauci in 1988 calling him a murderer then i guess some things never change before i
[1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:14.480]  get into that here's why the mainstream media and and and the liberal progressive left cannot burn
[1:17:14.480 --> 1:17:20.880]  bill gates and so yeah their virtue signal double standard is going to be completely
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:28.560]  exposed just like it is every time but but this is the key takeaway the reason why the liberal
[1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:35.280]  left has to always be allied with hollywood or people like bill gates even though all the stuff
[1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:40.400]  that they claim to hate and sorted behavior and all this stuff is is all brought to you by hollywood
[1:17:40.400 --> 1:17:45.760]  and by people like bill gates there's their allied with it and so the double standard exists because
[1:17:45.760 --> 1:17:55.360]  they need those people you see the average liberal leftist communist marxist progressive democrat
[1:17:55.360 --> 1:18:00.640]  whatever you want to call them they know that they can't win an argument and they know that their
[1:18:00.640 --> 1:18:06.800]  policy is a losing policy and they know all the real-time real-world examples that you would point
[1:18:06.800 --> 1:18:13.760]  to prove it whether it's failing democrat cities whether it's how all these democrats have been
[1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:20.560]  accused of rape and the media doesn't care and so the list goes on and on and the reason why they
[1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:25.360]  can never call those people the task never call them out never put them on the table for discussion
[1:18:25.360 --> 1:18:32.400]  is because they need them since their arguments don't win and since their policy fails all they
[1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:39.360]  can do is point to rich powerful celebrity people and say but see see hollywood agrees with us see
[1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:47.600]  bill gates agrees so you need to listen yeah see bezos agrees with me bill gates agrees with me
[1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:53.920]  hollywood celeb a and b and c all agree with me and it doesn't matter that my logic is twisted
[1:18:53.920 --> 1:19:01.680]  it doesn't matter that my standards have two different practical executions it just matters
[1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:06.480]  that what i say is what i say and bill gates agrees so listen to me
[1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:12.080]  so they'll never burn the hollywood celebs like they should
[1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:17.120]  whether they get caught raping children or talking about how they like child rape
[1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:22.560]  they still get to direct hollywood films and work for disney and nick lodean and other companies
[1:19:22.560 --> 1:19:31.760]  but you know that they'll panic any chance they have oh trump said he grabs women my god
[1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:38.400]  and then like here's hollywood people actually grabbing up women and putting them in film and
[1:19:38.400 --> 1:19:42.720]  here's epstein grabbing up women and putting him in the sex trafficking and and here's the mutual
[1:19:42.720 --> 1:19:46.240]  relationship with all of them and here's creeps like harvey winestein taking advantage of the whole
[1:19:46.240 --> 1:19:53.280]  thing and they'll never put any of that to task because they need it they need to have hollywood
[1:19:53.280 --> 1:19:58.000]  because it's the only way their message gets out and received they need to have powerful rich people
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:02.640]  like bill gates repeating their message it's the only way it gets out and gets received and and the
[1:20:02.640 --> 1:20:07.680]  hollywood and and the bill gates of the world they know this they know they have all these useful
[1:20:07.680 --> 1:20:14.000]  idiots they know they have all these uh political human drones and pawns and so they just go out
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:18.080]  and do whatever the hell they want and pretend to be liberal progressives because then they can be
[1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:27.760]  above it and they know they then become a a necessary tool of the left so they'll never
[1:20:27.760 --> 1:20:31.920]  call them to task they'll never throw them under the bus because they need them and so then they
[1:20:31.920 --> 1:20:37.520]  end up getting away with anything tim cook slave labor camps in china doesn't matter lebron james
[1:20:37.520 --> 1:20:43.680]  shoes made by by uh forced labor in china doesn't matter the left knees lebron to say look lebron
[1:20:43.680 --> 1:20:52.480]  james he's good at basketball and he says what i say look at tim cook he's a good liberal progressive
[1:20:52.480 --> 1:20:59.600]  he runs apple trillion dollar company i'm a genius tim cook runs death camps in apple
[1:21:00.480 --> 1:21:05.760]  no censor him censor that individual you're not allowed to say that about our beloved tim cook
[1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:12.160]  now if it came out that trump had you know slave camps death camps in china oh it'd be the biggest
[1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:16.960]  story in the world and i kind of wish trump did so that they could call him out on that and then
[1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:21.760]  you can be like okay now do lebron now do tim cook oh no no not going to do that okay
[1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:32.000]  so that's why they'll never truly go after a bill gates or truly go after hollywood because they
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:41.600]  need them to amplify their message and to use that as like a totem like a trophy like oh i never
[1:21:41.600 --> 1:21:46.160]  want to debate but i have a trophy that says i want to debate and it says i want this debate too
[1:21:47.680 --> 1:21:53.840]  and that trophy is lebron james or bill gates or gwyneth paltrow or somebody in hollywood that
[1:21:53.840 --> 1:21:58.960]  says the same thing i say so that means i'm smart so they'll never they'll they'll always keep them
[1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:08.320]  up there now now moving on story is at info wars dot com government scientific advisors admit they
[1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:14.400]  used totalitarian fear tactics to control people during the pandemic and and we also
[1:22:14.400 --> 1:22:20.160]  have all of this on tape we have them on on on television we have them during uh congressional
[1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:26.160]  hearings we have you know from from australia from europe from america where they say we have to
[1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:30.480]  fear we have to get people in fear we have to keep people in fear we have to make people
[1:22:30.480 --> 1:22:34.320]  afraid of a virus we have to make people afraid of a pandemic we have to use fear to get what we want
[1:22:34.320 --> 1:22:39.600]  what hell clow swab and the rest they they don't they admit the whole pandemic is fake and they
[1:22:39.600 --> 1:22:43.760]  just say yeah we had to fake a pandemic for our political agenda that they just don't even care
[1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:48.400]  they're the real evil villains they're they're the real head of specter
[1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:55.200]  but you know some of the people like the the australian prime minister and like jesson trudeau
[1:22:55.200 --> 1:23:00.480]  and all these people they're they're just little butt boys little minions of this this the shadow
[1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:10.000]  government so they're just doing what they're told so it's make people afraid you don't make make
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  them scared of the pandemic really hype it up tell them they're all going to die and and then
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:18.720]  and then you'll get a lot of power and and you'll be very popular and you'll write books and you'll
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:23.280]  sell them and you'll get rich and you'll be remembered as a hero for stopping the pandemic
[1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:30.400]  but no they admit that the whole thing is out of fear and then at the very top they admit that
[1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:35.680]  the whole thing is fake to bring in the build back better un new world order agenda
[1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:44.720]  pretty incredible to think and you think this is something hidden like oh it's like if it was
[1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:50.080]  hidden maybe then it would it would resonate but it's not even hidden they they do it on television
[1:23:51.440 --> 1:23:57.760]  they tell you they want to put you in fear on tv which is their mechanism for the fear
[1:23:57.760 --> 1:24:02.000]  so they're on tv their mechanism for the fear telling you to be in fear
[1:24:03.920 --> 1:24:07.360]  and if you lived your life and you never looked at the tv you would never know any of this was
[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:16.480]  going on now when we come back i'm going to get into the latest from fauci but but we're

[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:26.480]  does america got the guts to get the glory
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:33.360]  do we have a will to survive we're back here on the alex jones show on shroyer sitting in
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:38.240]  for alex alex coming back with us in just a bit we have drew her nanda is coming up

[1:28:42.480 --> 1:28:46.720]  i've got great guests on the war room today we'll have more on that coming up but
[1:28:48.800 --> 1:28:56.880]  in 1988 larry kramer wrote an open letter to dr anthony fauci now i'm just going to go through a
[1:28:56.880 --> 1:29:01.840]  few highlights of this um the whole thing is a lot longer but i'm just going to go through a
[1:29:01.840 --> 1:29:08.480]  few highlights just to kind of give you an idea of how history repeats itself when you don't know
[1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:14.640]  history or you'll be a victim of history if you don't understand this and so we didn't take care of
[1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:20.320]  the corrupt fauci then now he's come back 30 years later to take care of us if you know what i mean
[1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:27.760]  and maybe fauci was trying to kill off the gay community in the 80s based on this letter
[1:29:27.760 --> 1:29:35.200]  that's what the gay community believed so incredibly enough the left hated anthony fauci
[1:29:35.200 --> 1:29:41.280]  before anybody the left was aware of anthony fauci's criminal behavior before anybody and they penned
[1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:47.760]  open letters to the public to see two fauci calling him and his team of doctors murderers
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:55.280]  so imagine that a guy gets away with mass murder and never goes to jail and then comes back to
[1:29:55.280 --> 1:30:02.240]  commit mass murder mass genocide mass eugenics 30 years later or maybe you don't have to imagine that
[1:30:03.200 --> 1:30:10.160]  maybe that's fauci so let me just read some of this this is the beginning and then i'm
[1:30:10.160 --> 1:30:14.160]  going to go through a couple highlights but the whole thing is way too long but it'll give you a
[1:30:14.160 --> 1:30:19.520]  taste it'll give you a feel an open letter to dr anthony fauci from larry kramer in 1988
[1:30:19.520 --> 1:30:25.440]  i have been screaming at the national institutes of health since i first visited your animal house
[1:30:25.440 --> 1:30:31.360]  of horrors in 1984 i called you monsters then and i called you idiots in my play the normal
[1:30:31.360 --> 1:30:39.280]  heart i now call you murderers to dr fauci you are responsible for supervising all government
[1:30:39.280 --> 1:30:44.400]  funded aids treatment research programs in the name of right you make decisions that cost the
[1:30:44.400 --> 1:30:51.840]  lives of others i call that murder and we'll get into how the the aids research and the drugs
[1:30:51.840 --> 1:30:57.120]  that they're researching ties into what they were doing with hydroxychloroquine and uh
[1:30:57.120 --> 1:31:01.760]  res demivir and some of the others but i go on at hearings on april 29th before representative
[1:31:01.760 --> 1:31:06.480]  todd weiss and his house subcommittee on human resources after almost eight years of the worst
[1:31:06.480 --> 1:31:12.720]  epidemic in modern history starting to get the pattern here perhaps to be the worst in all history
[1:31:12.720 --> 1:31:16.560]  you were pummeled into admitting publicly what some of us have been claiming since you took
[1:31:16.560 --> 1:31:23.200]  office over three years ago you admitted that you are incompetent idiot or maybe a murderer
[1:31:23.200 --> 1:31:28.960]  over the past four years 374 million has been allocated for aids treatment research you were
[1:31:28.960 --> 1:31:34.080]  in charge of spending much of that money now it gets into kind of what was going on here i don't
[1:31:34.080 --> 1:31:39.600]  want to read all of it including some quotes from representatives at the time but basically how
[1:31:39.600 --> 1:31:44.720]  how he got all this money and they were doing all of this testing and all of this research and then
[1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:52.000]  he basically buried all of it and and then just kind of sidled saying oh well we can't figure
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:56.720]  anything out we don't have enough funding and and and the gay community that was concerned
[1:31:56.720 --> 1:32:00.240]  about this at the time were actually following it they were calling it out every step how he lied
[1:32:00.240 --> 1:32:04.480]  about everything how he had all the resources he need how he lied about how he was spending it
[1:32:04.480 --> 1:32:10.400]  and how he was basically just balking at the whole thing so again he calls him an idiot uh he he
[1:32:10.400 --> 1:32:15.520]  explains all of this and so then we get to this point now you come bawling the congress that you
[1:32:15.520 --> 1:32:21.040]  don't have enough staff office space lab space again this is after getting 374 million dollars
[1:32:21.040 --> 1:32:25.680]  secretaries computer operators lab technicians i wonder how much of that fouchi stole for himself
[1:32:25.680 --> 1:32:31.120]  for others by the way file clerks janitors toilet paper and that's why the drugs aren't being tested
[1:32:31.120 --> 1:32:35.280]  and the network of treatment centers isn't working and the drug protocols aren't in place so imagine
[1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:41.440]  you give somebody 374 million dollars to do a project and then they don't do anything nothing
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:47.440]  that was fouchi and again as normal the media would have ignored this nobody would have any idea
[1:32:47.440 --> 1:32:51.440]  this was going on but gay people at the time that were actually following this activist
[1:32:51.440 --> 1:32:55.120]  curious about this caught fouchi doing all of it that's why they called him a murderer
[1:32:55.120 --> 1:33:05.840]  he goes on you expect us to buy this bs and feel sorry for you you effing son of a bitch
[1:33:05.840 --> 1:33:12.000]  of a dumb idiot you have had 374 million dollars and you expect us to buy this garbage bag of
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:17.280]  excuses the gay community has been on your ass for three years and maybe in it
[1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:25.120]  it and you refuse to go public with what was happening or not happening and because you
[1:33:25.120 --> 1:33:30.640]  wouldn't speak up until you were asked pointedly by a congressional committee we lie down and die
[1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:35.040]  and our bodies pile up higher and higher in hospitals and homes and hospices streets and
[1:33:35.040 --> 1:33:39.280]  doorways and so here's what he's talking about there and again i'm just going to skip all of
[1:33:39.280 --> 1:33:43.920]  this section here because i don't have all the time in the world to read this so remember hydroxy
[1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:49.440]  chloroquine and it came out that not not for all but for most people i mean if you had some heart
[1:33:49.440 --> 1:33:53.600]  conditions and other things it was known hydroxy chloroquine probably not good for you but for a
[1:33:53.600 --> 1:33:59.440]  lot of people for most people with covet hydroxy chloroquine worked especially with zinc or vitamin
[1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:05.120]  d or vitamin c now people were getting banned and censored for saying that you had governors
[1:34:05.120 --> 1:34:09.760]  banning the use of hydroxy chloroquine now what happened in michigan you had a detroit
[1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:16.880]  representative democrat who had covet was dying of covet and was about to die from covet
[1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:26.640]  she found a doctor to illegally prescribe her hydroxy chloroquine for treatment with with i
[1:34:26.640 --> 1:34:35.280]  believe zinc and vitamin d and she made a recovery within 24 hours and then she did national media
[1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:41.680]  television interviews saying that hydroxy chloroquine saved her life gretchen whitmer who banned
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:46.000]  hydroxy chloroquine made it illegal would have murdered her if this doctor wouldn't have broken
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:53.040]  the law to give it to her and then thanked trump for talking about hydroxy chloroquine and saying
[1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:58.240]  no you can't use it despite these governors banning it so that's how it works so that's what fauci
[1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:05.200]  was doing in the 80s so in other words they were testing all of these drugs but fauci wasn't
[1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:08.720]  actually putting the research out and it was kind of like if you've ever seen the movie with
[1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:12.880]  matthew mcconaughey dalis buyers club basically these people in the gay community were trying out
[1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:16.880]  all these different drugs to deal with with aids or whatever they were having and they had to do
[1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:20.560]  their own experiments and they found out some of them work some of them don't they were trying to
[1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:25.200]  give this to fauci who was going around all the gay houses i guess he was too busy uh you know
[1:35:25.760 --> 1:35:31.200]  bending over to actually do the research and so they're saying look we have these cures look we
[1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:36.160]  have hydroxy chloroquine it works why aren't you promoting it why aren't you telling people
[1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:41.280]  you murderer so it's what they did in the 80s now they've done it again and now i go on
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:47.200]  how many years ago did we tell you about aerosol pentamideine
[1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:51.760]  tony this stuff saves lives and we discovered it ourselves we came to you bearing this great news
[1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:56.640]  on a silver platter begging you can we get it officially tested can we get it approved so
[1:35:56.640 --> 1:36:01.280]  insurance companies and medicaid will pay for it as a routine treatment and our patients going
[1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:06.880]  broke paying for medicine that they could get cheaper you monster and now this is incredible
[1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:12.400]  polosi even gets involved this woman polosi's been around that long polosi's in this story with
[1:36:12.400 --> 1:36:22.400]  fauci these dinosaurs these these ancient fossils of corrupt politics polosi's quoted in the story
[1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:26.960]  assume that you have AIDS and that you've had pneumonia once you know that aerosolized
[1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:34.240]  pentamideine was evaluated by NIH as highly promising you know as of today the delays in NIH
[1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:44.160]  trials may not be solved this year why do you wait for the NIH NIH study i probably would go with
[1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:50.720]  what would be available to me be it on the street or what have you and so he's basically
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:53.680]  saying yeah the drug works but we're not testing it we're not going to make a statement on it so
[1:36:53.680 --> 1:36:58.720]  just go find out on the streets that's fauci replying to polosi but i guess got it then you
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:04.000]  know maybe polosi letting the uh the AIDS epidemic and and keeping the drugs and not going after
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.920]  fauci is how she's remained in power all these years but so but so there you go i'm out of time
[1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:16.480]  this segment point is fauci and his team of doctors were called murderers in the 80s for what they
[1:37:16.480 --> 1:37:22.480]  did handling a pandemic now they're back and look at what's happening ladies and gentlemen
[1:37:23.120 --> 1:37:32.560]  the exact same story known treatments that were working like hydroxychloroquine shelved by fauci
[1:37:32.560 --> 1:37:38.720]  fauci demonized it told democrats to make it illegal they did and then people died fauci
[1:37:38.720 --> 1:37:46.080]  did the same thing in the 80s he's doing the same thing now why would we ever trust this guy
[1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:51.680]  anthony fauci belongs in jail do you agree with larry kramer is anthony fauci a murderer
[1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:58.320]  listen up patriots i'm running a sale that's the biggest i've ever run on three products that are

[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:07.200]  down most of the world for a year it's going to cause a collapse in food production and distribution
[1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:12.320]  and not just that fuel and every other major commodity the globalist want to post-industrial
[1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:17.200]  world they're hitting us with economic war i told you food prices would explode they're now exploding

[1:42:10.720 --> 1:42:21.840]  so
[1:42:23.360 --> 1:42:33.120]  back here on the alex jones show and the henchmen of the population control eugenics new world
[1:42:33.120 --> 1:42:42.800]  order are out in public and unmasked decloaked bill gates anthony fouchy crechin whitmer
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:52.160]  andrew quomo the talking heads on television they've completely exposed themselves and so now
[1:42:52.160 --> 1:42:59.520]  it's just a matter of time can people of planet earth wake up and realize this before they can
[1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:07.920]  complete their eugenics program and have a mass die off a mass kill off so that they can seize
[1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:18.320]  control of the planet in that panic of uncertainty which they engineered to bring in the one world
[1:43:18.320 --> 1:43:23.520]  government that they will be in complete control of and that's what it's really all about because
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:32.480]  is the way the globalists work and the people that are in the secret societies whether it's
[1:43:32.480 --> 1:43:38.640]  the sex cults or the luciferian cults or the bohemian grove cults you know
[1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:44.320]  they just do their own actuaries that you've probably done in your own head
[1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:49.440]  seeing where humanity is going seeing the trends but but they look at themselves
[1:43:49.440 --> 1:43:58.480]  as superior and they want to be gods so they just actuary it out and say this is where humanity
[1:43:58.480 --> 1:44:04.880]  is going let's let's do this instead so there will be a global government i mean there i mean
[1:44:04.880 --> 1:44:12.480]  globalism is inevitable with technology and travel and and business and everything globalism is
[1:44:12.480 --> 1:44:19.920]  inevitable so they so they see that but they say let's get out ahead of that and have the
[1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:27.200]  infrastructure for globalism already built in but hey it's going to be unpopular people like freedom
[1:44:27.200 --> 1:44:33.040]  well let's put them in fear so that they would rather be secure in the new global world order
[1:44:33.040 --> 1:44:40.160]  than free in it and so that's where they're going that's their agenda and it just becomes a challenge
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:49.120]  of can we awaken enough humans on planet earth can we spread the brush fires of liberty can we
[1:44:49.920 --> 1:44:56.640]  awaken souls and third eyes to stand up recognize this and just reject it
[1:44:58.160 --> 1:45:04.080]  because that's what it really comes down to and it's harder and harder every day to reject it
[1:45:04.080 --> 1:45:10.640]  when they rig elections censor free speech change history erase history
[1:45:12.320 --> 1:45:16.240]  and this is the challenge upon us every day not just here at info wars but but but you
[1:45:16.240 --> 1:45:20.560]  everybody else is in this we're all sharing this planet
[1:45:23.200 --> 1:45:26.880]  except there's a certain group of people that don't want to share it they want to own it
[1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:36.000]  it and then own everything on it and they want you to believe your safety and your security
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:41.760]  is more important than your freedom and that you can't even protect yourself you can't even
[1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:50.640]  ensure your own safety you need them so here's one of the ways that they do it
[1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:58.240]  with Anthony Fauci a guy who nobody should listen to ever unless he wants to do an admission from
[1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:02.560]  prison of all the things he's done all the crimes against humanity otherwise nobody should ever
[1:46:02.560 --> 1:46:10.240]  listen to this man he now says that the pandemic has proved how racist america is oh so his
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:15.040]  popularity is dwindling he's being exposed to the fraud he's being exposed as a liar people
[1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:20.720]  are now looking at old letters to him calling him a murderer they're looking back on the history
[1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:25.520]  of Fauci they're realizing he's a big pharmaceutical shill so what do you do play the race card
[1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:32.640]  build back those leftist liberal progressive bonus points and say race racist this racist that
[1:46:32.640 --> 1:46:39.200]  try to save your image and of course they already have the backdrop that they've built up they they
[1:46:39.200 --> 1:46:47.760]  pumped up they've humped up all this racist stuff so it gives them the leverage it gives them the
[1:46:47.760 --> 1:46:53.920]  capacity it gives them the the political points so all racism yeah yeah and you're like oh wow yeah
[1:46:53.920 --> 1:47:04.560]  big racism oh it's like the the the bitcoin of the victim currency is is racism it's it's trending
[1:47:04.560 --> 1:47:12.240]  up it's 50 000 it's 100 000 oh racism oh i'll buy into that yeah and so that's what they do
[1:47:13.760 --> 1:47:21.440]  as a safety net when they're losing popularity so here's anthony fauci in clip seven telling
[1:47:21.440 --> 1:47:29.600]  going with the race card as his popularity is dwindling let us promise ourselves that our
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:36.880]  corporate memory of this tragic reality that an infectious disease disparately hospitalized
[1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:43.920]  and kills people of color does not fade after we return to some form of normality
[1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:51.520]  writing this wrong will take a decades long commitment i strongly urge you to be part of
[1:47:51.520 --> 1:47:56.960]  that commitment so there you go so he's reading a letter somebody else probably wrote from him
[1:47:56.960 --> 1:48:01.680]  and then he's saying oh this racism is so bad we're gonna it's going to take decades to recover see
[1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:08.480]  you can never recover from racism it's here forever fauci declares so that's how they do it that's
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:12.960]  how their propaganda works and then oh and then the people that like the victim economy the people
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:16.880]  that the racists out there that love everything being based on race and identity politics they
[1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:24.240]  buy in and they say that's right that's right it's racist and then they they can spin off of that
[1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:30.400]  at any agenda they want any execution of an agenda they want if they just bring racism and then as
[1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:38.080]  soon as you question it say oh you're a racist aren't you like voter id racist you don't like
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:45.360]  government shutdowns for the pandemic racist you don't want to take a vaccine racist and then they
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:51.280]  use that like like it's just like a it's like a purse of currency that they can just dip into
[1:48:51.280 --> 1:48:56.000]  anytime and it just replenishes just racist racist racist hey this isn't working go go here
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.960]  here have some of the racist have some of the racist currency here you go yeah yeah
[1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:05.760]  they all the americans want their kids back in schools oh boy this isn't good what are we gonna
[1:49:05.760 --> 1:49:11.840]  do here here we've got some extra racism currency take this and use it on air parents want to send
[1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:18.320]  their kids back to school it's clearly racist and then somehow americans like tower and fear like
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:23.360]  oh my gosh don't call me a racist and you know i realized something too about january 6 and you
[1:49:23.360 --> 1:49:28.400]  know look we're all such good people we're almost too good quite frankly we're too nice we're too
[1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:34.320]  tolerant because even after i mean trump is guilty of this too trump threw us under the
[1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:39.200]  bus on january 6 he's kind of backtracked from it now but i mean he's like oh it's bad it's horrible
[1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:46.400]  they're criminals arrest them all yeah january 6 got a little bit out of control there was some
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:50.240]  violence against the police there was a little bit of violence there at the building too property
[1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:55.200]  damage not in denial of that but in comparison to what we saw from the democrats when they riot
[1:49:56.160 --> 1:50:03.680]  it's like it's like a mouse that roared compared to a whole stampede of elephants and rhinos and
[1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:09.520]  gorillas and we're like a little mouse over here that's like it's like look at that mouse just
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:15.040]  stampeding elephants and like woolly mammoths too like what the hell it's like oh but there's a mouse
[1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:20.320]  over there no we should have rejected their narrative of january 6 and and quite frankly
[1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:24.320]  at a certain level we should have been proud of it we should have been proud of what happened on
[1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:33.600]  january 6 but they stole that from us so um i'm digressing here the point is we're too tolerant
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:37.280]  to these people we're too tolerant of the anthony fouches we're too tolerant of the bill gates we're
[1:50:37.280 --> 1:50:42.640]  too tolerant of the biden's we're too tolerant to the liberal media maybe that's a good thing maybe
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:46.960]  it's a good thing we're not in the wild wild less anymore maybe it's a good thing we're not in 1776
[1:50:46.960 --> 1:50:53.040]  and people's uh you know aren't aren't being faced with actual violent wars in their backyard
[1:50:53.040 --> 1:50:57.760]  maybe it's a bad thing because it's eventually going to lead to our enslavement maybe time will tell
[1:51:00.960 --> 1:51:10.880]  but now you've got celebrities coming out talking about how bad their vaccine side effect was
[1:51:10.880 --> 1:51:19.440]  whether it's ben stein now eric claptin you bastards you bastards eric claptin fears he'll
[1:51:19.440 --> 1:51:27.600]  never be able to play guitar again thanks to the covet jab you bastards your bastards that you would
[1:51:27.600 --> 1:51:35.520]  take away eric claptin from the world you sick freaks that killed hank erin the home run king
[1:51:35.520 --> 1:51:40.000]  that killed marvin agler you bastards that you would take that from us and now you want to take
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:47.040]  eric claptin's ability to play guitar you bastards you are just sick big pharma is the devil
[1:51:49.120 --> 1:51:52.480]  sorry excuse me but so here's now quote unquote comedian
[1:51:53.920 --> 1:51:58.960]  chelsea handler talking about her side effects after getting the vaccine
[1:52:00.400 --> 1:52:05.520]  okay so i got my second shot of moderna today and i feel really sick and it's only been four
[1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:11.440]  hours and i'm deaf in one ear oh did anyone did anyone i thought i was gonna get sick tomorrow
[1:52:12.080 --> 1:52:19.840]  but i feel sick did this happen to other people please tell me and she's just desperate like you
[1:52:19.840 --> 1:52:24.400]  know because you don't know yeah you just got hit with a deadly poison lady yeah you know and you
[1:52:24.400 --> 1:52:31.200]  know it's sad that but i can laugh at her plight and it is sad it's disgusting of me you know but
[1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:36.000]  i mean it's funny because you make fun of conservatives and you make fun of anti-vaxxers
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:42.400]  and and it's a big joke to you but we warned you now you're deaf in one ear so i guess that's just
[1:52:42.400 --> 1:52:46.640]  the fruit's coming home to roast one of the most common questions i get on air but also
[1:52:46.640 --> 1:52:52.880]  off air when i'm just out and about is alex what do i say to my family about the vaccines
[1:52:52.880 --> 1:52:58.320]  how do i warn them well the problem is there's so many problems with it so many facts it's the
[1:52:58.320 --> 1:53:03.440]  history of contaminated vaccines the fact that they have liability protection in the u.s and europe
[1:53:03.440 --> 1:53:08.240]  the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things the vaccines
[1:53:08.240 --> 1:53:13.840]  and the whole history of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks poor whites
[1:53:13.840 --> 1:53:19.280]  native americans the list goes on and on but what about the fact that falchi testified to congress
[1:53:19.280 --> 1:53:28.320]  and so did the head of the cdc in late may of 2021 that around half of the nih cdc staff medical
[1:53:28.320 --> 1:53:32.560]  doctors urologist scientists have refused to take the vaccine and don't take it safe yeah i think
[1:53:32.560 --> 1:53:36.880]  what half of the doctors are scared to take it that's the same thing in the private practice
[1:53:36.880 --> 1:53:40.800]  is out there somewhere numbers that that's not something i'm gonna be taking that's very very
[1:53:40.800 --> 1:53:49.600]  simple there's your answer warning warning warning the globalists have launched a massive counter
[1:53:49.600 --> 1:53:55.040]  offensive against populist forces worldwide they are censoring they are attacking they are arresting
[1:53:55.040 --> 1:54:00.800]  patriots all over the world churches in europe australia the uk and canada and even california
[1:54:00.800 --> 1:54:07.520]  new york are being swat teamed and clothed because they're non-essential the tyranny is incredible
[1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:12.320]  but in areas like texas and south dakota and florida where we have a history of more liberty
[1:54:12.320 --> 1:54:18.160]  all the lockdowns are over ladies and gentlemen this is martial law this has all been a massive
[1:54:18.160 --> 1:54:22.880]  martial law drill and now it's more important than ever to spread the word about info wars
[1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:27.360]  and to support info wars we have three of our best selling products selling out but despite that
[1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:34.080]  they're all massively discounted turbo force it's 40 percent off we've got ultimate fish oil
[1:54:34.080 --> 1:54:38.960]  50 percent off and winter sun for your immune system it's 50 percent off as well best deal ever
[1:54:38.960 --> 1:54:43.120]  take advantage of it at info wars store dot com and fund the info war
[1:54:47.280 --> 1:54:49.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:54:49.920 --> 1:54:57.920]  so
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:03.600]  all right so seriously the crew is having a bit of a laugh at me and that's okay
[1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:10.480]  i i have been public speaking for years of my life for years really really consistently since
[1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:15.760]  high school and for whatever reason like i am having dyslexia problems and at the end of the
[1:55:15.760 --> 1:55:20.880]  last segment i mixed two catchphrase slogans together probably sounded like a bumbling idiot
[1:55:21.760 --> 1:55:26.240]  i swear i i've never had this dyslexia before it's becoming a serious thing and i think what's
[1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:32.480]  happening is the circuits in my brain are just like way too overstimulated with information
[1:55:32.480 --> 1:55:38.320]  and it's just stuff is just cross firing so have a laugh at my dyslexia i'm perfectly okay with that
[1:55:38.320 --> 1:55:43.360]  just just know you're laughing at my brain damage when you do that that i've caused on myself
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:49.520]  so so seriously though uh getting real though drew hernandez is with us the intrepid reporter
[1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:56.000]  who's done so much great work over the last two years and now of course is getting censored because
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:03.200]  that's what happens when you do real journalism and expose real criminal activity so drew hernandez
[1:56:03.200 --> 1:56:07.440]  is going to be with us for this segment and the next he has a short time with us uh drew tell us
[1:56:07.440 --> 1:56:14.160]  about what is happening right now the censorship you're enduring yeah well this failed media outlet
[1:56:14.160 --> 1:56:19.760]  called the intercept ran a hit piece and a smear piece on myself and other fellow riot journalists
[1:56:19.760 --> 1:56:26.800]  that have put their lives on the line to cover the 2020 and 2021 BLM and antifa riots they not
[1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:33.520]  only did a article on everybody but they also produced a 25 minute so-called mini documentary
[1:56:33.520 --> 1:56:39.440]  trying to prove that all the footage that you've seen in 2020 is somehow selectively edited and
[1:56:39.440 --> 1:56:45.520]  not the real narrative and that we're attempting they call this right wing journalists attempting
[1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:50.800]  to smear the black lives matter movement these people are just failed reporters they're failed
[1:56:50.800 --> 1:56:54.400]  journalists they have nothing going on with their lives and they're trying to smear people that are
[1:56:54.400 --> 1:56:59.840]  actually successful in doing it right well before we get into more of the details of this i mean tell
[1:56:59.840 --> 1:57:04.800]  people that it really is a dangerous enterprise to go cover these these events tell people everything
[1:57:04.800 --> 1:57:09.600]  you've witnessed at these riots in the last year and a half two years i mean this is a serious thing
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:14.720]  it's not just oh show up and like everybody's cheering and glad heading i mean there's explosions
[1:57:14.720 --> 1:57:20.000]  there's gunshots there's police there's people bleeding out i mean it's serious stuff well here
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:25.520]  here's the thing that gets left out as well oh and it's when black lives matter or antifa are not
[1:57:25.520 --> 1:57:30.800]  actually committing acts of violence on the ground they're they're either talking about it
[1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:35.680]  or they're conspiring to do it together okay you hear this in their rhetoric you hear there
[1:57:35.680 --> 1:57:38.960]  you hear this when they're preaching at their rallies you hear this when you're undercover
[1:57:38.960 --> 1:57:43.840]  in their little groups regardless this this this organization black lives matter it's not this
[1:57:43.840 --> 1:57:49.120]  innocent little organization uh that doesn't do anything wrong they're neo marxist i mean when
[1:57:49.120 --> 1:57:54.160]  i was on portland on the ground uh when i was covering a black lives matter protest last year
[1:57:54.160 --> 1:57:59.600]  you literally had one of their speakers calling for police officers she said she wished that they
[1:57:59.600 --> 1:58:04.640]  would be strangled by their umbilical cords when they were babies okay so this is the type of rhetoric
[1:58:04.640 --> 1:58:08.880]  that comes from these people and then obviously mentally unstable people that are listening
[1:58:08.880 --> 1:58:12.880]  this to this stuff are going to go out and actually commit acts of violence against police
[1:58:12.880 --> 1:58:18.480]  officers and anyone that is in opposition toward their so-called peaceful movement and by the way
[1:58:18.480 --> 1:58:23.120]  if you're not on the ground covering this nobody will mainstream media is not going to cover it
[1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:27.440]  they showed uh julio rosas a twitter account up there he's probably one of the few people that
[1:58:27.440 --> 1:58:31.920]  is on mainstream news that actually goes out to these events he's obviously been threatened
[1:58:31.920 --> 1:58:36.160]  so if it wasn't for you covering these events they would be completely uncovered nobody would see it
[1:58:37.360 --> 1:58:42.320]  absolutely and this is why they try to smear us and it's hilarious because they say here's the
[1:58:42.320 --> 1:58:47.280]  funny part oh and this is how stupid these people are okay they're saying oh uh right-wing journalists
[1:58:47.280 --> 1:58:54.000]  they're smearing the black lives matter movement they literally use footage of antifa rioting
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:59.360]  saying that that's us smearing black lives matter okay the mental gymnastics with these
[1:58:59.360 --> 1:59:04.160]  people are ridiculous you have to be literally stupid to believe these people when you have
[1:59:04.160 --> 1:59:08.880]  literally people in black block destroying buildings and they're sitting they're saying oh
[1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:14.240]  they're just smearing black lives matter you gotta be more on to believe this oh and literally
[1:59:14.240 --> 1:59:19.440]  well i mean that that's just like a buzzword they have like oh you're smearing me it's like if i
[1:59:19.440 --> 1:59:23.680]  play a clip of one of them on air they go you smeared me you said that i just played the
[1:59:23.680 --> 1:59:27.840]  clip of you saying that it's like hey i just filmed this riot they just burned this building they
[1:59:27.840 --> 1:59:33.520]  just looted this target they just attacked this man oh you're smearing them by showing the truth
[1:59:33.520 --> 1:59:37.600]  of their activities i guess that that's what this has come down to so drew her nana is with us for
[1:59:37.600 --> 1:59:42.720]  the next segment as well now again the irony here is the intercept used to be run by glenn greenwald
[1:59:42.720 --> 1:59:47.680]  the real liberal they ran him off they ran him off and now they want to run off journeys that are
[1:59:47.680 --> 1:59:55.680]  covering the truth on the ground amazing it's thursday morning may 13th i'm sitting in my studio
[1:59:55.680 --> 1:59:59.520]  getting ready to go live and i am just cutting this bulletin to all the listeners and all the
[1:59:59.520 --> 2:00:05.200]  viewers to understand how serious the situation is just two weeks ago i predicted you'd see massive
[2:00:05.200 --> 2:00:10.400]  inflation explode that they would cut off more pipelines i said it on air more than 50 times
[2:00:10.400 --> 2:00:16.400]  because america is under strategic globalist attack in a economic trade war to make sure china
[2:00:16.400 --> 2:00:22.240]  wins this is world war three and i told listeners you need to get swarable food you need to get
[2:00:22.240 --> 2:00:26.000]  water filtration those are some of the basics you need and we have the best swarable food
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:30.800]  at the lowest prices you're gonna find anywhere now the sale was supposed to end yesterday but
[2:00:30.800 --> 2:00:36.640]  i'm running it through the 14 15 16th and 17th because so many people have requested that i extend
[2:00:36.640 --> 2:00:42.640]  it so people have a chance to get this great deal 2020 prices in the year 2021 and then
[2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:46.480]  my patreon is going to have to go up on prices because everybody else is already and the raw
[2:00:46.480 --> 2:00:51.280]  materials are skyrocketing they have the food ready to ship right now at preparewithalvage.com
[2:00:51.280 --> 2:01:11.840]  we're back here on the alex don't show drew her nanda's is with us at through h live on twitter
[2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:21.520]  through h live.com is his website the intercept is trying to demonize his intrepid reporting
[2:01:21.520 --> 2:01:27.520]  from the ground of these riots and again folks um it really is dangerous stuff to be in the middle
[2:01:27.520 --> 2:01:32.320]  of this stuff especially when you have a target on your back which is a common thing these days so
[2:01:33.200 --> 2:01:40.240]  it's really pathetic for any news organization or media organization to be demonizing actual
[2:01:40.240 --> 2:01:46.000]  journalism and reporting from the ground of these events which is of course what drew her nanda's
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:53.360]  does so they are now saying uh that i i guess reporting the truth i guess that's the problem
[2:01:53.360 --> 2:01:59.520]  here drew is reporting the truth is now considered racist or bigoted or smearing i mean you know this
[2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:04.960]  is what this is what their new argument is if you if you report the truth they demonize you
[2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:12.000]  and then they censor you oh and that these people are failed drifters okay this is how ridiculous
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:16.400]  they went i could speak for myself okay when you see the article and you watch their little mini
[2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:22.720]  documentary on us they literally use one of my pieces uh where i was in portland okay and a black
[2:02:22.720 --> 2:02:28.800]  lives matter militant psychopath uh was being pushed by police officers and she turns around and says
[2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:34.080]  i hope your whole family uh gets burnt down in your house your whole effing family okay calling
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:41.040]  for the death of police officers and their families uh by arson okay and they took that clip and they
[2:02:41.040 --> 2:02:47.040]  said drew her nanda's left out the part uh as to why she said that and the reason why she said that
[2:02:47.040 --> 2:02:51.760]  was because she was being roughed around by police officers they literally leave out the fact that
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:57.200]  the reason why the police officers were roughing people around was because these rioters prior to
[2:02:57.200 --> 2:03:02.400]  this clip were attempting to burn down a federal building with police officers inside of it okay
[2:03:02.400 --> 2:03:08.640]  so they they they accuse us of leaving things out and selectively editing but that's literally what
[2:03:08.640 --> 2:03:15.040]  they did uh in this piece this smear piece to try and say that we uh selectively edited and left
[2:03:15.040 --> 2:03:19.200]  stuff out they did the very same thing they accused us of doing and that's what these people do and
[2:03:19.200 --> 2:03:24.800]  you know what's interesting oh and is they got ratioed hard on twitter okay they got over half
[2:03:24.800 --> 2:03:30.400]  a million views but the only reason they did was because thousands of people actually came
[2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:35.840]  to our side and came to our defense and ratioed the hell out of them on their own twitter and
[2:03:35.840 --> 2:03:41.760]  there were even leftists in the comment section that were like uh this is a little too far how can
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:46.800]  you accuse these guys of smearing black lives matter when you have footage of black lives matter
[2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:51.520]  rioting looting and committing mass arson and this one doesn't add up i honestly i feel like
[2:03:51.520 --> 2:03:57.680]  that was the most hilarious part about this i mean at what point and and this is not the
[2:03:57.680 --> 2:04:02.240]  you know this is not the result this is not the conclusion this is not what we want to see but i
[2:04:02.240 --> 2:04:08.640]  mean at what point do you say do we as americans say you know what fine go ahead to fund the police
[2:04:08.640 --> 2:04:14.320]  fine i won't go cover these riots and and we'll just let these people destroy cities again i don't
[2:04:14.320 --> 2:04:20.880]  want that that's not what i i like cities i like metropolitan areas i like i like having a civilization
[2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:25.760]  functioning but it's like at what point do we draw back and say fine here's what you're asking for
[2:04:25.760 --> 2:04:30.800]  here's what you're really asking for and just i mean let it can commence for a couple nights until
[2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:35.120]  they realize okay wow this is actually violent groups of terrorists maybe we should have been
[2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:41.680]  honest about this and tried to stop it i agree i agree i i totally my heart hurts when you think
[2:04:41.680 --> 2:04:46.960]  about um even thinking about that right because you know innocent people are gonna get caught in
[2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:52.480]  the crossfire but the problem is a lot of people in these communities support this stuff they support
[2:04:52.480 --> 2:04:57.200]  black lives matter they support antifa especially in portland that's shocking a lot of people don't
[2:04:57.200 --> 2:05:01.840]  know that but a lot of the locals in portland shockingly support antifa when you go out there
[2:05:01.840 --> 2:05:06.240]  and you cover this stuff you actually see them coming outside of their houses screaming at police
[2:05:06.240 --> 2:05:11.440]  officers so i kind of agree with actually i do agree with you oh and i think people if this is what
[2:05:11.440 --> 2:05:15.840]  they want this is what they should get if they don't want police officers pull the police officers
[2:05:15.840 --> 2:05:20.000]  out put them in cities where they'll be respected and they can do their jobs where they're actually
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:24.080]  wanted because i think that's what the american people want at this point i mean we have to give
[2:05:24.080 --> 2:05:28.240]  people what they want if they don't want police officers if they want crime running rampant in
[2:05:28.240 --> 2:05:32.240]  their freaking communities then that's what they're gonna get if they want to disrespect police
[2:05:32.240 --> 2:05:36.480]  officers and defund the hell out of them and put their families out on the street then you know what
[2:05:36.480 --> 2:05:40.560]  let's take them out of those cities put them in states put them in cities where they'll be respected
[2:05:40.560 --> 2:05:44.640]  and they can do their jobs where they can keep us safe while your cities burn to the ground and you
[2:05:44.640 --> 2:05:49.120]  can have black lives matter and antifa policing your neighborhoods how about that yeah and you
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:55.040]  know maybe this is one of our shortcomings and i mean it's noble it's noble in in the cause but
[2:05:55.040 --> 2:06:00.000]  it's like it may it's time we just need to stop fighting for these democrat cities you know we
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:04.000]  still want to try to save some of these democrat cities and lift them back up and and you know
[2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:09.840]  maybe it's time to just say hey you know what this is a democrat city now it's gone let it go let the
[2:06:09.840 --> 2:06:15.120]  poverty increase let the violence increase let all the businesses leave and all these democrat run
[2:06:15.120 --> 2:06:20.400]  cities will be slums and like you said hey cities that want police cities probably run by republicans
[2:06:20.400 --> 2:06:24.320]  mostly conservative areas you know trump voters hey you want some extra police we'll give you some
[2:06:24.320 --> 2:06:28.160]  extra police you want to have a safer community you can have a safer community we'll build up those
[2:06:28.160 --> 2:06:32.720]  communities we'll form our own strongholds in those communities and then you can fairly
[2:06:32.720 --> 2:06:37.520]  see the contrast as if it's you know not there enough to to observe but then it's like yeah look
[2:06:37.520 --> 2:06:44.080]  this is what you vote for these are democrat cities slums hellholes poverty starvation violence
[2:06:44.080 --> 2:06:52.080]  crime no economy versus conservative areas with police economies booming people are safe schools
[2:06:52.080 --> 2:06:58.480]  are better uh so i mean maybe it's just time for that to to really reach a point where there's no
[2:06:58.480 --> 2:07:03.840]  debate and you can compare and contrast and say wow democrat policy democrat run cities creates
[2:07:03.840 --> 2:07:09.040]  third world hellholes i totally agree i mean sometimes we just have to give people what they
[2:07:09.040 --> 2:07:13.760]  want it sounds so sad and you know a lot of conservatives patriots we hear that and it's like
[2:07:13.760 --> 2:07:17.600]  drew oh and why are you guys talking like this we're not going to bend the need of black lives matter
[2:07:17.600 --> 2:07:22.000]  or the neocommunist in the globalist that that's not what we're saying sometimes i think we have
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:26.880]  to let the enemy gain some strategic ground uh so we can actually show the public just exactly
[2:07:26.880 --> 2:07:31.920]  what their ideas look like in real life okay because these things may sound amazing on paper
[2:07:31.920 --> 2:07:36.800]  they sound amazing on tv oh my goodness the black people are being slaughtered by police officers
[2:07:36.800 --> 2:07:41.840]  yes we must defund the police when that's literally not the narrative okay but when people like alex
[2:07:41.840 --> 2:07:47.280]  jones on shroyer jure hernan is all these people that speak out against these things we all get
[2:07:47.280 --> 2:07:52.240]  shadow banned we get debusted we get censored it's like okay then i'm done talking at this point
[2:07:52.240 --> 2:07:57.200]  i'm done trying to tell you guys the truth i'm done trying to tell you and warn you what's coming
[2:07:57.200 --> 2:08:01.440]  then maybe we've come to the point where it's like if you're gonna keep voting for this and supporting
[2:08:01.440 --> 2:08:05.440]  this then you know what i'm gonna leave this community and i'm gonna go to a community that's
[2:08:05.440 --> 2:08:09.440]  going to respect the values that's going to protect our american citizens and you could
[2:08:09.440 --> 2:08:14.240]  just have your community that you want in this false fantasy of utopia that just does not exist
[2:08:14.240 --> 2:08:18.320]  with black lives matter policing their own neighborhoods and antifa policing their own
[2:08:18.320 --> 2:08:23.200]  neighborhoods look how that's turning out in portland they're literally policing themselves
[2:08:23.200 --> 2:08:28.000]  the police have been neutered in portland and now crime is skyrocketing in portland
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:32.400]  and people are like freaking out like how in the world did this happen are you serious
[2:08:32.400 --> 2:08:37.120]  you guys sided with antifa you sided with black lives matter you actually sided with the defund
[2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:41.360]  the police narrative and now your community is suffering as a result so you have yourself to
[2:08:41.360 --> 2:08:45.760]  blame if you supported this and i don't feel sorry for you at this point yeah and i was going to say
[2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:51.200]  you you look at any of these major cities some of them were already you know as dangerous as it gets
[2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:56.000]  like a st louis or chicago but i mean even new york that was kind of turning a corner i mean you
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:00.880]  look at violent crime and the numbers that have skyrocketed in new york you look at the violent
[2:09:00.880 --> 2:09:05.840]  crime skyrocketing skyrocketing and then the new interviews on tv or city council like oh we don't
[2:09:05.840 --> 2:09:10.160]  know what's behind the violent crime skyrocketing or you'll have mayors and other democrat leaders
[2:09:10.160 --> 2:09:14.560]  just deny it it's really incredible to witness their denial of the the things that are happening
[2:09:14.560 --> 2:09:19.040]  on their streets but i guess that's just to be expected uh drew what what what's next on your

[2:09:52.320 --> 2:09:57.120]  banned police officers through the year 2025 i'm sure you saw that what do you think smart move or
[2:09:57.120 --> 2:10:04.320]  bad move bad move but here's the most hilarious part in that article uh nyc pride literally said
[2:10:04.320 --> 2:10:11.520]  we're gonna keep police out only if necessary we'll bring them in okay this is how stupid they are
[2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:17.280]  okay they claim to be defund the police anti police but listen anyone with a conscience anyone that
[2:10:17.280 --> 2:10:22.720]  cares for their own life whether white whether black whether brown i don't care whether green if
[2:10:22.720 --> 2:10:27.680]  you're a freaking space alien cares about the sanctity of their life and a police officer
[2:10:27.680 --> 2:10:32.640]  is there to ensure that and that's why they're such hypocrites and they say oh only if it's
[2:10:32.640 --> 2:10:36.960]  necessary we'll bring a police officer in this is how stupid these people are on yeah just another
[2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:41.120]  just another political statement totally out of place made but hey here's what will happen somebody
[2:10:41.120 --> 2:10:46.640]  will show up to that pride parade in a trump hat and there'll be 9 11 calls going out left and right

[2:11:05.600 --> 2:11:11.440]  uk and canada and even california new york are being swat teamed and clothed because they're
[2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:17.520]  non-essential the tyranny is incredible but in areas like texas and south dakota and florida
[2:11:17.520 --> 2:11:22.880]  where we have a history of more liberty all the lockdowns are over ladies and gentlemen this is

[2:11:56.320 --> 2:12:03.840]  to victory over these criminals last week the arch globalist fouchy admitted that roughly half of
[2:12:03.840 --> 2:12:10.640]  the cdc's top brass and workers medical doctors scientists nurses you name it have taken the

[2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:45.120]  texas was going to be in peril doom's day scenario for texas because governor abbott
[2:13:45.120 --> 2:13:49.680]  lifted the mass mandate and reopened the state since then we've had the least covet deaths
[2:13:49.680 --> 2:13:57.520]  amongst any state so uh put put that in your pipe and smoke at beto you fraud you lying coward

[2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:57.440]  the audience as well it's all at info wars store dot com okay let's see what we want to do here
[2:16:01.200 --> 2:16:03.280]  let me just get back into some of this news now
[2:16:06.720 --> 2:16:14.320]  yeah so this is coming and it's coming like a whirlwind and it's hard to believe that it's even
[2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:17.760]  here because because there's going to be a kind of a side
[2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:27.200]  issue that comes from this let me just give you the story here 39 million households including
[2:16:27.200 --> 2:16:34.880]  most us children to get up to 3600 a month in stimulus payments so so so this is how this
[2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:38.400]  this is how this crashes a free market folks this is how this crashes an economy
[2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:45.520]  economy you've already seen this happen in select groups in the united states of america
[2:16:46.400 --> 2:16:52.640]  specifically democrat run cities specifically impoverished area in democrat run cities specifically
[2:16:52.640 --> 2:16:58.320]  projects in democrat run cities and specifically black families single mothers in democrat run
[2:16:58.320 --> 2:17:05.760]  cities so it creates this phenomenon where the government becomes your daddy the state
[2:17:05.760 --> 2:17:13.120]  the state becomes the head of the household and so everything kind of flows from that
[2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:21.840]  do you quit working do you kick the man out of the house you know how you know so but oh
[2:17:21.840 --> 2:17:27.520]  the state is now the head of the house the state pays my bills i love the state i need the state
[2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:35.120]  and so then internally within these families you say morale get low you see people not wanting
[2:17:35.120 --> 2:17:42.640]  to go back to work you see stimulus money being used for other such things and it just creates a
[2:17:42.640 --> 2:17:48.960]  downward spiral that they can never get out of but they don't care to because the state is still
[2:17:48.960 --> 2:17:55.040]  there cutting them that check so they get used to that lifestyle now what this is going to do
[2:17:55.040 --> 2:18:01.120]  taking it to the next level it is going to be twofold first of all this is going to increase
[2:18:01.120 --> 2:18:10.080]  violent crime in inner cities i won't go too much into the the the criminal psychology of this but
[2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:18.880]  it's well known this is why crime goes up during christmas whenever people hear hey there's a lot
[2:18:18.880 --> 2:18:23.520]  of money coming in this area hey there's stuff going on here criminals flock to that area
[2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:29.520]  i mean take take like a drug deal for example you hear about oh this drug gang over here is about
[2:18:29.520 --> 2:18:33.120]  to be a big drug deal there's going to be a lot of money on hand criminals are interested in that
[2:18:33.120 --> 2:18:40.560]  they may try to do a heist people get shot people die well well that's all illegal activity
[2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:49.920]  but you're going to have increased crime in these areas that are getting the stimulus payouts
[2:18:50.560 --> 2:18:54.800]  guaranteed yeah and there's already the headlines that are highlighting this the crew's pulling
[2:18:54.800 --> 2:18:59.120]  them up right now people are getting shot people are getting into fights people are having their
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:03.520]  homes invaded and it's because of the stimulus checks so criminals are going to think oh they've
[2:19:03.520 --> 2:19:09.440]  got money now oh the stimulus check just went out now oh it's in the mail oh i know this house gets
[2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:16.080]  a stimulus check criminals are going to flock to that that's one of the issues that will follow
[2:19:16.640 --> 2:19:22.800]  the other issue is people that still work for a living are going to feel like idiots people that
[2:19:22.800 --> 2:19:29.760]  still work for a living are going to feel like dupes and so they're going to quit their job
[2:19:30.800 --> 2:19:36.000]  and start getting a stimulus payment and then the supply chain shortage is going to increase
[2:19:37.200 --> 2:19:42.960]  and then the inability for businesses and restaurants and places to hire workers is going
[2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:51.280]  to increase because why make 30 000 a year or 45 000 a year in the service industry when i can
[2:19:51.280 --> 2:20:00.960]  make that or more sitting on my butt and having the government be my daddy and praying to the state
[2:20:00.960 --> 2:20:09.040]  to save me so this is a disaster this is a biden policy that is an absolute disaster
[2:20:10.480 --> 2:20:19.680]  and it is not going to take long for this disastrous policy to reap whirlwinds of chaos
[2:20:19.680 --> 2:20:27.120]  and havoc and crime in our country so it doesn't matter that covet is over they're still using
[2:20:27.120 --> 2:20:33.760]  this under the guise of covet and of course racism as well and it's just going to absolutely
[2:20:33.760 --> 2:20:39.440]  destroy these communities ladies and gentlemen and it's really sad that this is what the democrats
[2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:45.200]  are doing it's all by design and they know it but they just figure hey these people are so desperate
[2:20:45.200 --> 2:20:53.520]  and stupid they'll fall for this too i'm joe biden i've been in government for 50 years and i'm here
[2:20:53.520 --> 2:21:01.600]  to help i'm joe biden i put millions in people black people in jail for crack and i'm here to help
[2:21:03.680 --> 2:21:08.560]  i'm joe biden my son's a drug addict sex addict freak and i'm here to help
[2:21:08.560 --> 2:21:17.440]  hi we're the democrats we put you into poverty we put your cities into a state of emergency every
[2:21:17.440 --> 2:21:28.080]  night and we're here to help so this is going to be disastrous i don't know how this turns around
[2:21:28.800 --> 2:21:33.360]  we've already warned you get out of democrat run cities if you haven't yet i mean now is the time
[2:21:33.360 --> 2:21:40.560]  folks because with crime already skyrocketing this is going to make it tenfold this is only
[2:21:40.560 --> 2:21:46.240]  going to make it tenfold so could be could be weeks could be months could be years if this policy
[2:21:46.240 --> 2:21:51.760]  happens you will see the inner cities completely go to chaos i'm not going to sit here and waste
[2:21:51.760 --> 2:21:58.960]  your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full worse is that if you're paying attention
[2:21:58.960 --> 2:22:06.640]  you know we've done together but i'll tell you this the technocrats are really upping their game
[2:22:07.200 --> 2:22:12.720]  and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media they're trying to shutter and silence
[2:22:12.720 --> 2:22:18.480]  human resistance so now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven
[2:22:18.480 --> 2:22:23.040]  accurate everything you warned your friends and family about it's about to be true so it's now
[2:22:23.040 --> 2:22:29.840]  that your credibility is way up the power structure to silence those of us that they can't but it's
[2:22:29.840 --> 2:22:36.960]  up to all of us to not let them silence any of us we have the power but the sun is setting on
[2:22:36.960 --> 2:22:43.120]  humanity and setting on free speech we have to make sure that we find hard right now to make
[2:22:43.120 --> 2:22:46.880]  sure that long dark night doesn't come so be the polar bears you are

[2:23:52.880 --> 2:23:56.880]  did you predict over a year ago that food prices would explode within a year because it was in all
[2:23:56.880 --> 2:24:02.000]  the globalist actuaries that you shut down most the world for a year it's going to cause a collapse
[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:07.840]  in food production and distribution and not just that fuel and every other major commodity the
[2:24:07.840 --> 2:24:12.240]  globalist want to post industrial world they're hitting us with economic war i told you food

[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:57.280]  with alex dot com scientist agree magnesium is the most important cofactor in the body regulating
[2:24:57.280 --> 2:25:03.600]  and controlling hundreds of pathways magnesium is required for your body to do the following
[2:25:03.600 --> 2:25:10.320]  helps convert food into energy helps with muscle contraction function helps regulate the nervous
[2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:16.800]  system helps with protein building in the muscles and so much more and now it's available in this
[2:25:16.800 --> 2:25:23.680]  concentrated form of ionized fizzy magnesium it tastes great i take it the morning i take it in

[2:25:44.720 --> 2:25:56.560]  win now exclusively available at info wars store dot com for only 1995 you're listening to the alex
[2:25:56.560 --> 2:26:24.080]  jones show so leaked documents out of canada last year show that the entire
[2:26:24.080 --> 2:26:29.760]  other covid response was already pre-planned now we already know that from other such things
[2:26:29.760 --> 2:26:36.400]  like event 201 and crimson contagion and other leaks but people have been specifically monitoring
[2:26:37.600 --> 2:26:44.000]  the leaked documents from from canada that that showed all the plans for covid into deep into
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:49.840]  the year 2021 which just shows you it's not about science it's not about data it's it's all it's all
[2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:58.400]  pre-plan it's all a power grab it's all a takeover is what it is so in case you didn't have enough
[2:26:58.400 --> 2:27:03.840]  evidence of that there's there's just more out there and it ties into the stimulus that they're
[2:27:03.840 --> 2:27:10.800]  giving out but you know i realized something in the break here that was so obvious as i'm thinking
[2:27:10.800 --> 2:27:14.960]  of the headline for the segment upload to band out video that i can't believe i missed this point
[2:27:14.960 --> 2:27:23.680]  but but it's it's clear to me now so again the viden administration is going to be paying
[2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:36.320]  $3,600 a month a month to 39 million households in the us and it just hit me like a ton of bricks
[2:27:36.320 --> 2:27:40.880]  okay yeah just like every other democrat policy it's going to lead to poverty and destruction
[2:27:40.880 --> 2:27:48.240]  and crime we know that but but here's like the thing that i just completely missed this is
[2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:54.480]  the viden administration paying democrat voters $3,600 a month that's what this is
[2:27:56.560 --> 2:28:01.600]  and i don't know if any if anybody that does data and tracking and analytics and logistics
[2:28:01.600 --> 2:28:06.960]  and demographics and stuff and they might not be able to do it until this plan is actually put into
[2:28:06.960 --> 2:28:14.720]  practice to analyze the data i guarantee you if you analyze this data of the 39 million homes
[2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:22.320]  that are about to get $3,600 in in stimulus checks i guarantee you the vast majority the vast
[2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:28.240]  majority if they voted voted democrat i would say 90 percent and then others probably just didn't
[2:28:28.240 --> 2:28:34.400]  vote so this is democrats paying off their voters and then putting them on the democrat
[2:28:34.400 --> 2:28:40.560]  dull to get them to keep going back and voting democrat this is a desperate move this is a
[2:28:40.560 --> 2:28:47.680]  communist takeover this is joe biden and the democrats paying their democrat voters a good
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:52.880]  reward of a stimulus check for going along with the democrat policies going along with the shutdowns
[2:28:52.880 --> 2:28:59.920]  going along with the with the racism and the riots and everything go along with it shut your mouth
[2:28:59.920 --> 2:29:06.000]  play along now you're getting your payment $3,600 a month congratulations your whole city is destroyed
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:09.840]  and you have no future congratulations but 3,600 a month to vote democrat
[2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:16.320]  wow and you can go there's no such thing as a blue state by the way
[2:29:17.680 --> 2:29:22.880]  because you can go look at voter turnout numbers and they have all these color graded
[2:29:22.880 --> 2:29:31.840]  maps and it shows the whole country is red except for the major cities run by democrats
[2:29:31.840 --> 2:29:38.160]  where the population density is you look at illinois it's all red except for chicago in fact
[2:29:38.160 --> 2:29:44.240]  there's a new account on twitter that's things like red eagle politics that's actually putting out
[2:29:44.240 --> 2:29:51.040]  the actual data from the 2016 to the 2020 election and what it shows is not only that the 2020
[2:29:51.040 --> 2:29:59.920]  election was stolen in all of these all these red areas all got more red the only places where
[2:29:59.920 --> 2:30:08.000]  democrats picked up votes were in major cities like philadelphia and pittsburgh and arizona
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:13.680]  and atlanta where biden somehow quadrupled as many votes as hillary clinton i mean just magically
[2:30:13.680 --> 2:30:22.400]  quadrupled so that's america all red except for democrat run areas where they have the population
[2:30:22.400 --> 2:30:28.000]  density and they pay off their voters with now stimulus money but they have all kinds of different
[2:30:28.000 --> 2:30:34.880]  ways of paying off their voters and it's all going to inner cities that end up voting democrat
[2:30:34.880 --> 2:30:47.520]  that's unbelievable to see this happening in real time but there it is now let's look at some of
[2:30:47.520 --> 2:30:57.360]  this other news here police departments across america preparing for a violent summer that's
[2:30:57.360 --> 2:31:04.160]  right it's riot season ladies and gentlemen democrat riot season and you still have the
[2:31:04.160 --> 2:31:10.800]  floyd chauvin verdict kind of sitting out there a mistrial i feel is is is eminent with all the
[2:31:10.800 --> 2:31:20.320]  shenanigans that the democrats were up to and the media and and and the jurors lying too so this
[2:31:20.320 --> 2:31:25.200]  is just incredible but we know how these things go they always get away with these crimes somehow
[2:31:25.200 --> 2:31:32.160]  so maybe we shouldn't be so sure of it but yeah everybody knows the democrats are are just a
[2:31:32.160 --> 2:31:38.480]  powder keg as soon as the mainstream media lights it riots will commence across this country
[2:31:40.880 --> 2:31:47.760]  really really amazing after years of harassing the president of the united states donald trump the
[2:31:47.760 --> 2:31:52.400]  fake news new york times finally admits the steel dossier was a lie that never materialized or had
[2:31:52.400 --> 2:31:56.240]  been proven false you know what let me let me come back to that because i think that got mixed
[2:31:56.240 --> 2:31:59.120]  in with this stack but let me get into this other stack where i wanted to go though
[2:31:59.120 --> 2:32:07.200]  uh so the the the hate crimes against asians continuing to happen by white supremacist as
[2:32:07.200 --> 2:32:13.760]  you can see here guys uh it's another white supremacist in new york city attacking asians
[2:32:14.800 --> 2:32:18.240]  it's really incredible now i'm being facetious but but here's the funny thing about all these
[2:32:18.240 --> 2:32:26.560]  reports they always identify somebody unless they're black so it's an asian female identified
[2:32:26.560 --> 2:32:31.200]  but the white supremacist black lady that assaulted her she she's just an individual
[2:32:31.200 --> 2:32:36.640]  see how that works because you're not allowed to say uh that uh but but here's what you need
[2:32:36.640 --> 2:32:44.160]  to understand because there is actually rhyme and reason to this you are a white supremacist if you
[2:32:44.160 --> 2:32:49.520]  voted trump you are a white supremacist if you attack an asian or really anybody in the streets
[2:32:49.520 --> 2:32:53.920]  if you're a white supremacist so white supremacy has no longer anything to do with your actual
[2:32:53.920 --> 2:32:58.400]  skin color it's a hundred percent to do with your politics or your violent behavior so if you're
[2:32:58.400 --> 2:33:04.720]  violent and you attack asians in san francisco or new york you're a white supremacist so so
[2:33:04.720 --> 2:33:07.440]  you i just want you to understand that i mean you knew that if you were black and you voted
[2:33:07.440 --> 2:33:12.480]  for trump obviously you were a white supremacist but uh now if you're black and you attack asians
[2:33:13.120 --> 2:33:17.920]  you're a white supremacist kind of like this individual in los angeles another white supremacist
[2:33:17.920 --> 2:33:24.400]  who held up an asian at gunpoint uh who robbed him and held him up at gunpoint another white
[2:33:24.400 --> 2:33:28.880]  supremacist so it's it's amazing how many black people becoming white supremacists overnight
[2:33:29.440 --> 2:33:35.840]  by committing these violent crimes here's another one disabled army veteran attacked by four black
[2:33:35.840 --> 2:33:41.680]  women white supremacists calling her a white bitch court to decide if it's a hate crime yeah
[2:33:41.680 --> 2:33:48.400]  because we don't really know but uh they're white now so that can't be a hate crime against your
[2:33:48.400 --> 2:33:54.400]  own skin color right i mean if you commit a violent crime against somebody because of their
[2:33:54.400 --> 2:33:59.040]  skin color that makes you a white supremacist it doesn't matter what your skin color is or what
[2:33:59.040 --> 2:34:04.800]  the skin color is of your victim you're a white supremacist as soon as that activity commences
[2:34:04.800 --> 2:34:10.160]  so here you can see this man in a pittsburgh pirates ball cap uh holding a man up at gunpoint
[2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:19.200]  that is a white supremacist so just understand this is how the world works now okay now of course
[2:34:20.480 --> 2:34:26.080]  this is all a lie i just lied to you but but that's what the mainstream media and the democrats
[2:34:26.080 --> 2:34:32.560]  want you to believe now here's one of the biggest lies of all time the steel dossier so now even
[2:34:32.560 --> 2:34:38.160]  the mainstream news is admitting it's fake but but remember even when the steel dossier was being
[2:34:38.160 --> 2:34:43.360]  introduced to get to get warrants to spy and bringing brought to members of congress and and
[2:34:43.360 --> 2:34:49.440]  members of the bureaucracy they all said it's fake it was only the obama administration and the
[2:34:49.440 --> 2:34:55.440]  radical lefties under brennan and clapper and comey that wanted to continue the lie that the
[2:34:55.440 --> 2:35:01.280]  steel dossier was real everybody knew it was fake folks everybody knew it was fake they all knew it
[2:35:01.280 --> 2:35:06.960]  was fake but now all the media members that got duped they're now admitting it was fake here's
[2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:13.040]  something incredible about this everybody in this audience probably knows about the steel dossier
[2:35:13.040 --> 2:35:18.080]  and how fake it was not many people know about the manifold little black book or little black book
[2:35:18.080 --> 2:35:22.640]  or little brown book this was the steel dossier against manifold now notice how you don't really
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:29.440]  hear about that it it was so fake it was so unbelievably fake and it was used to destroy
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:38.720]  manifold something fake something entirely fabricated these are sick people man i'm telling you there
[2:35:38.720 --> 2:35:46.320]  need to be mass arrests of the obama administration mass arrests of fauci and and gates this is the
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:51.520]  only way we're going to save this planet or you know where they're taking it man globalist puppet
[2:35:51.520 --> 2:35:58.320]  joe biden wasted no time blaming russia with no evidence for the shutdown of the east coast
[2:35:58.320 --> 2:36:03.040]  gasoline pipeline that goes from houston right up through new york city and supplies more than
[2:36:03.040 --> 2:36:08.480]  half of the gasoline of the east coast but who isn't that actually shut down the main pipeline
[2:36:08.480 --> 2:36:13.600]  from canada through the midwest to houston to refine the oil that's then turned into gas
[2:36:13.600 --> 2:36:19.200]  and some of the east coast that's right joe biden shut down the keystone pipeline right after it
[2:36:19.200 --> 2:36:25.040]  was completed joe biden did that to america he has the history he has the background he's one
[2:36:25.040 --> 2:36:30.480]  that promised to quote get us off of fossil fuels he's the one that's trying to extend the lockdowns
[2:36:30.480 --> 2:36:35.760]  of the country remember ladies and gentlemen that the new world order wants to post industrial
[2:36:35.760 --> 2:36:40.720]  world and they want the united states europe and australia crippled so communist china
[2:36:40.720 --> 2:36:46.000]  can't be dominant it's not russia that's the enemy it's communist china and their millions like joe
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:52.080]  biden in control of the white house that's the facts that's the information scientist degree
[2:36:52.080 --> 2:36:57.680]  magnesium is the most important co-factor in the body regulating and controlling
[2:36:57.680 --> 2:37:03.920]  hundreds of pathways magnesium is required for your body to do the following helps convert
[2:37:03.920 --> 2:37:10.160]  food into energy helps with muscle contraction function helps regulate the nervous system
[2:37:10.160 --> 2:37:16.000]  helps with protein building in the muscles and so much more and now it's available in this
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:22.880]  concentrated form of ionized fizzy magnesium it tastes great i take it the morning i take it in

[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:56.880]  the globalist comprised the oldest and richest families on earth and they have brought down hundreds
[2:37:56.880 --> 2:38:02.560]  and hundreds of nations over the last thousand years they have bankrupted once successful countries
[2:38:02.560 --> 2:38:09.600]  all across the world and they've used the same formulas of civil unrest and civil war and they're
[2:38:09.600 --> 2:38:15.440]  doing it again to the united states of america and europe right now bringing in giant third world
[2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:19.760]  populations and then brainwashing them and turning them against the country that they
[2:38:19.760 --> 2:38:24.000]  wanted to emigrate to because they knew it was better and had more freedom and more opportunity
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:29.040]  ladies and gentlemen america is under scientific attack and it's time now more than ever to raise
[2:38:29.040 --> 2:38:34.080]  the alarm and warn everyone you know that was really happening and at the same time get prepared
[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:38.160]  in case things continue to go south like they are one of the smartest moves out there is the high

[2:38:43.280 --> 2:38:49.520]  insurance you can eat so we've extended the sale through this sunday at 10 off all storeable foods
[2:38:49.520 --> 2:38:56.400]  that prepare with alex dot com warning warning warning the globalists have launched a massive
[2:38:56.400 --> 2:39:01.600]  counter offensive against populist forces worldwide they are censoring they are attacking they are
[2:39:01.600 --> 2:39:07.280]  arresting patriots all over the world churches in europe australia the uk and canada and even
[2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:13.600]  california new york are being swat teamed and closed because they're non-essential the tyranny
[2:39:13.600 --> 2:39:18.480]  is incredible but in areas like texas and south dakota and florida where we have a history of
[2:39:18.480 --> 2:39:24.400]  more liberty all the lockdowns are over ladies and gentlemen this is martial law this has all
[2:39:24.400 --> 2:39:29.360]  been a massive martial law thrill and now it's more important than ever to spread the word about

[2:39:57.040 --> 2:40:06.480]  the world is starting to pay attention to the fact that i don't just say the things i say on air
[2:40:07.360 --> 2:40:13.920]  for shock value i don't just make the claims that i make because i want people to tune into my show
[2:40:14.560 --> 2:40:18.720]  i say these things because i've done deep research on the globalists i know what their
[2:40:18.720 --> 2:40:24.240]  goals are and i understand how they operate and you have to understand the globalists are a consortium
[2:40:24.240 --> 2:40:29.440]  of very very powerful institutions and very very wealthy families and they want world government
[2:40:30.160 --> 2:40:34.640]  they want feudalism they want basically a post-human future where they have robots
[2:40:34.640 --> 2:40:39.440]  and ai that control what's left of humanity and they believe there's too many humans they
[2:40:39.440 --> 2:40:46.080]  want to call our numbers by at least 90% but that said there are power factions bill gates
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:54.320]  cloud swab the un openly sided with the communist chinese and believe that it was time for the
[2:40:54.320 --> 2:40:59.200]  communist chinese century for the council on foreign relations and other people had talked about
[2:40:59.840 --> 2:41:06.480]  to come to the front now the globalist set up communist china where it gets all the rare earth
[2:41:06.480 --> 2:41:13.520]  minerals it gets all the jobs because tariffs are put inside western countries in europe the
[2:41:13.520 --> 2:41:21.200]  uk australia newsyland the u.s canada which are regulatory tariffs where it's impossible for us
[2:41:21.200 --> 2:41:26.480]  to compete with the communist chinese because we have higher energy costs we have green regulations
[2:41:27.120 --> 2:41:33.200]  now the carbon taxes that is designed to make the jobs go to china but china under the trilateral
[2:41:33.200 --> 2:41:39.840]  agreement was to not become dominant in military force and to contain themselves to only their
[2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:45.280]  borders well communist china has now expanded out they violated their deals with hong kong
[2:41:45.280 --> 2:41:50.560]  and taiwan they're moving into the philippines they're moving into the south china sea they're
[2:41:50.560 --> 2:41:55.360]  trying to take islands away that have been historically japan's because they've so infiltrated
[2:41:55.360 --> 2:42:00.240]  the united states of europe with their double agents they've been so successful buying up most
[2:42:00.240 --> 2:42:05.360]  of hollywood four of the six big production houses the big studios but they're very very
[2:42:05.360 --> 2:42:13.280]  arrogant and the china files like bill gates and others with the confucian societies at the
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:19.120]  universities believe that they are invincible i mean you've got martin zuckerberg trying to name
[2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:26.000]  his first child gg ping and calling gg and saying i worship you please let me name my child after
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:32.240]  you and he said no that's why you see the leader of canada trudeau saying i want to be a dictator
[2:42:32.240 --> 2:42:37.520]  like gg ping and that's a real video i want to be a chinese dictator ship what do you want to
[2:42:37.520 --> 2:42:42.560]  grow up and be trudeau i want to be a dictator like gg ping but that's what his father wanted his
[2:42:42.560 --> 2:42:50.560]  father admired malatang so this is real authoritarianism they've decided to go that round we've not
[2:42:50.560 --> 2:42:55.280]  resisted them properly so they have to ask well why is bill gates in trouble why did i say a few
[2:42:55.280 --> 2:42:59.040]  months ago they're going to bring down bill gates why did i say claus Schwab is in danger of being
[2:42:59.040 --> 2:43:06.240]  robbed down because their agenda didn't succeed fully and they were supposed to have the big
[2:43:06.240 --> 2:43:11.680]  lockdown to put the world under a world id and to put the world under a global social credit score
[2:43:11.680 --> 2:43:18.320]  based on china but not to keep us locked down while china reopened it was only meant to get rid of
[2:43:18.320 --> 2:43:26.640]  trump and punish balsamaro and bring the leader of the uk morris johnson under heal under control
[2:43:26.640 --> 2:43:33.040]  but see the globalists began to leverage that the china arm of the globalists began to leverage
[2:43:33.600 --> 2:43:38.720]  and continue a global depression to consolidate power and control completely collapse in the
[2:43:38.720 --> 2:43:44.480]  third world and so in danger in the west with migrant flows that they thought it was becoming
[2:43:44.480 --> 2:43:50.960]  too extreme so what you have is two different major power factions battling now how did i tell you
[2:43:50.960 --> 2:43:58.480]  you 14 years ago 10 years ago three years ago two years ago and just last november i guess it
[2:43:58.480 --> 2:44:08.880]  was late october was yo rogan that specifically that bill gates did not meet with jeffrey fstein
[2:44:08.880 --> 2:44:13.760]  one time like he said in the past he lied and said never met with him he met with him hundreds and
[2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:21.120]  hundreds of times and now you notice that mainstream news is reporting the daily beast the new york
[2:44:21.120 --> 2:44:25.440]  posts and even reuters and ap and that's on the cover of people magazine when you're at the grocery
[2:44:25.440 --> 2:44:31.200]  store but he met with them dozens or more times well of course he did because they're in the same
[2:44:31.200 --> 2:44:39.040]  business controlling the scientific elite of the major colleges so they can carry out things like
[2:44:39.040 --> 2:44:45.920]  the covet 19 the power grab bill gates has controlled almost all the major health services of the world
[2:44:46.720 --> 2:44:51.520]  he has control the nih or the united states the national health service in the uk he has control
[2:44:52.160 --> 2:44:55.440]  of of almost every nation except india that threw him out a few years ago
[2:44:56.640 --> 2:45:01.280]  and so again they pushed this project they launched this project they got enough of the
[2:45:01.280 --> 2:45:10.720]  establishment on board going back into december of 19 of 2019 to go ahead and pull the trigger on
[2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:16.000]  but as the program got revealed and as there was a massive backlash globally and as the program
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:21.760]  began to fail because scientists and doctors were able to override big tech censorship now the
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:27.360]  globalists are backing away from gates and away from schwaab and away from others because they
[2:45:27.360 --> 2:45:32.720]  weren't doing this to bring in the new world order as it was said to be built by the rockefellers
[2:45:32.720 --> 2:45:39.040]  and others and british royalty and the ronfschilds this was one basically for the chi comms now and
[2:45:39.040 --> 2:45:44.240]  the super predator gates and others went ahead and made their move with the un double crossing the
[2:45:44.240 --> 2:45:51.360]  other globalist power axis also when they set up this plan back in the 1970s to have china
[2:45:51.360 --> 2:45:56.160]  dominate economically worldwide so the globalist could leverage control and use economic warfare
[2:45:56.160 --> 2:46:02.400]  to bring the west to its knees russia was still there and russia was still seen as being part
[2:46:03.280 --> 2:46:09.280]  of the global opposition system but now that russia is its own standalone country and and
[2:46:09.280 --> 2:46:15.040]  rejecting globalism and soros and depopulation and the whole trans agenda the new order has
[2:46:15.040 --> 2:46:20.160]  an even bigger problem on its hands and so the world is not just unipolar with the us as the
[2:46:20.160 --> 2:46:26.000]  lone superpower now it's not just bipolar with communist china it's not just tripolar with the
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:32.800]  european union bureaucracy as corrupt as it is still has a lot of power it's not just having four
[2:46:32.800 --> 2:46:37.200]  polls with the uk and what's left of the remnants of the annual america establishment ally with the
[2:46:37.200 --> 2:46:41.840]  us but because russia has nuclear weapons and all that energy and it isn't going along with the
[2:46:41.840 --> 2:46:46.560]  agenda and also has more borders with more countries than any other nation in the world
[2:46:46.560 --> 2:46:52.000]  called they are the ace in the hole that is causing this system to not basically come to
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:58.080]  fruition like the globalists have wanted it to so bottom line there's infighting inside the new
[2:46:58.080 --> 2:47:02.720]  order going on right now and the reason this is important is it's essential to nail gates
[2:47:02.720 --> 2:47:08.080]  politically to the wall and to nail swab and to nail the un and to nail the head of the who who
[2:47:08.080 --> 2:47:12.880]  clearly cooked up the virus gave it a function released it censored everybody so we couldn't
[2:47:12.880 --> 2:47:18.160]  stand up to them exaggerated strength try to have a permanent lockdown to cripple economies and
[2:47:18.160 --> 2:47:24.880]  consolidate control all gates bought up all the farmland if they aren't punished then the globalists
[2:47:24.880 --> 2:47:30.560]  will continue with the blueprint of the covet lockdown in the future with new releases new variants
[2:47:30.560 --> 2:47:35.200]  or hyping up a new pneumonia or a new flu as they're already saying to bring back the mask to bring
[2:47:35.200 --> 2:47:40.000]  back the non-essential to lock you in your homes to consolidate more economic control
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:46.240]  and depopulation in the future so it's essential to discredit this whole lie to destroy it politically
[2:47:46.240 --> 2:47:51.760]  and to punish those that captained it so that other globalists in the future are scared to use
[2:47:51.760 --> 2:47:58.880]  these same weapons systems of fear and control in the future so they know how to put pressure on you
[2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:09.280]  till opposition forms and then once opposition forms they will take off the pressure so that
[2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:14.640]  the opposition dissipates and then they'll bring the pressure back again so they only advance when
[2:48:14.640 --> 2:48:19.840]  they're not getting major resistance so as this is the sun came up this morning guaranteed everybody
[2:48:19.840 --> 2:48:25.360]  celebrating thinking the lockdowns are over they are coming back they're already still in place in
[2:48:25.360 --> 2:48:31.840]  Australia areas of Europe the UK with a permanent control grid and so those groups are just a few
[2:48:31.840 --> 2:48:37.360]  steps ahead of us that's why we have to repudiate the whole system and expose the system and expose
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:42.080]  how damaged many people are going to be from these deadly gene therapy systems they've already been
[2:48:42.080 --> 2:48:46.880]  given which is the soft kill program so as good as it is that the globalists are in trouble and
[2:48:46.880 --> 2:48:52.560]  this arm of the globalist is being repudiated we're still in grave danger because the depopulation
[2:48:52.560 --> 2:48:58.320]  operation has already been launched and so now again we have to tend to the sick and dying
[2:48:58.320 --> 2:49:02.560]  and the unfolding lies and the attempts to turn our children against us like the new modern Hitler
[2:49:02.560 --> 2:49:07.440]  youth to demand that they be vaccinated using their ignorance we have to go on the offense
[2:49:07.440 --> 2:49:11.600]  politically culturally spiritually and repudiate and expose this whole system or if you should
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:17.280]  have keep coming back like basically a bad taste of herpes notice the level of lockdown people
[2:49:17.280 --> 2:49:21.760]  live under is the level they accept if you accept it in Canada it never ends if you accept it in
[2:49:21.760 --> 2:49:26.640]  the UK it never ends if you accept it in Florida it never ends but if you don't accept it well then
[2:49:26.640 --> 2:49:32.640]  your leaders can stand with you and have a prosperous future and most leaders want that but they're
[2:49:32.640 --> 2:49:36.640]  up against the media the big banks and the globalists and so if you don't show leadership on the grass
[2:49:36.640 --> 2:49:42.640]  roots the leaders will never basically appear from amongst our ranks to turn this tide of tyranny
[2:49:42.640 --> 2:49:48.640]  so basically this is a long war we're all in we're a very serious war and we are starting to win this
[2:49:48.640 --> 2:49:54.640]  first big battle but not without huge casualties I want to thank Owen Troyer for the incredible
[2:49:54.640 --> 2:49:58.640]  job he's done today and I just want to thank the entire crew for the work that they've done I want
[2:49:58.640 --> 2:50:02.640]  to thank the listeners I want to thank God most importantly and of course I want to thank my family
[2:50:02.640 --> 2:50:08.640]  as well and we see to take stock of how serious the situation is and regroup and move forward and
[2:50:08.640 --> 2:50:13.640]  not just dust ourselves off and you know forget what we've just been through because we're still in
[2:50:13.640 --> 2:50:18.640]  the middle of the fight and the enemy is just getting ready to strike again but yes we've had some
[2:50:18.640 --> 2:50:22.640]  victories and way lower numbers of people took the deadly shots that they thought and having half
[2:50:22.640 --> 2:50:27.640]  the NIH not take the shot is just a huge victory so put that in the face of these vaccine bullies and
[2:50:27.640 --> 2:50:31.640]  vaccine pushers when they try to make you submit all right more transmissions come up moment please
[2:50:31.640 --> 2:50:35.640]  stay with us and please spread the word if you're watching and listening to transmission you are the resistance
[2:50:40.640 --> 2:50:46.640]  one of the most common questions I get on air but also off air when I'm just out and about is Alex
[2:50:46.640 --> 2:50:52.640]  what do I say to my family about the vaccines how do I warn them well the problem is there's
[2:50:52.640 --> 2:50:57.640]  so many problems with it so many facts is the history of contaminated vaccines the fact that they
[2:50:57.640 --> 2:51:01.640]  have liability protection in the U.S. and Europe the fact that they've been caught adding
[2:51:01.640 --> 2:51:06.640]  sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines and the whole history of secret
[2:51:06.640 --> 2:51:12.640]  experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks poor whites Native Americans the list goes on and on
[2:51:12.640 --> 2:51:18.640]  but what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress and so did the head of the CDC in late
[2:51:18.640 --> 2:51:26.640]  May of 2021 that around half of the NIH CDC staff medical doctors or all just scientists have refused
[2:51:26.640 --> 2:51:31.640]  to take the vaccine and don't take it safe yeah I think what half of the doctors are scared to take
[2:51:31.640 --> 2:51:35.640]  it that's the same thing in the private practices out there somewhere numbers that that's not something
[2:51:35.640 --> 2:51:43.640]  I'm gonna be taken that's very very simple there's your answer scientists degree magnesium is the
[2:51:43.640 --> 2:51:50.640]  most important co-factor in the body regulating and controlling hundreds of pathways magnesium is
[2:51:50.640 --> 2:51:57.640]  required for your body to do the following helps convert food into energy helps with muscle
[2:51:57.640 --> 2:52:02.640]  contraction function helps regulate the nervous system helps with protein building in the
[2:52:02.640 --> 2:52:09.640]  muscles and so much more and now it's available in this concentrated form of ionized fizzy
[2:52:09.640 --> 2:52:15.640]  magnesium it tastes great I take it the morning I take it in the evening it is so essential in my
[2:52:15.640 --> 2:52:21.640]  life and I hope all of you will check it out and try it it's available at info or store.com right
[2:52:21.640 --> 2:52:26.640]  now this is the best formula for my research you're gonna find out there so if you've already
[2:52:26.640 --> 2:52:31.640]  enjoyed other magnesium formulas give this one a try I think you're gonna love it at the same time
[2:52:31.640 --> 2:52:38.640]  it funds the info war which is a true 360 win now exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[2:52:38.640 --> 2:52:48.640]  for only 1995 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:52:48.640 --> 2:53:06.640]  all right ladies and gentlemen I am signing off of the Alex Jones show I'm about to go
[2:53:06.640 --> 2:53:11.640]  get ready to host the war room Gerald Salente is going to take over here on the fourth hour
[2:53:11.640 --> 2:53:15.640]  but I we're gonna play a John bound report here but I had to just interrupt for a second
[2:53:15.640 --> 2:53:21.640]  because you know we would never obviously we would never intentionally deceive or lie to you
[2:53:21.640 --> 2:53:24.640]  that's something we would never do but sometimes accidentally I may say something wrong on air
[2:53:24.640 --> 2:53:29.640]  but we always correct the record as soon as we can so I was covering the stimulus payments
[2:53:29.640 --> 2:53:36.640]  that Biden is promoting or promising to Democrat voters in inner cities and just to be clear it's
[2:53:36.640 --> 2:53:42.640]  a monthly payment that could equal $36,000 a year is what they're proposing now so it's not
[2:53:42.640 --> 2:53:48.640]  $3600 a month it'll be monthly payments to get to $3600 a year is what they're proposing so
[2:53:48.640 --> 2:53:52.640]  wasn't intentionally trying to deceive wanted to correct that record we're not like the fake news
[2:53:52.640 --> 2:53:56.640]  if we get something wrong we'll correct it but that was unintentional but now there you go now
[2:53:56.640 --> 2:54:00.640]  I'll be hosting the war room we got a lot of great guests coming on today you're not gonna want to
[2:54:00.640 --> 2:54:05.640]  miss it in the meantime here is the latest report from John bound on the epidemic of homelessness
[2:54:05.640 --> 2:54:11.640]  happening in Austin and other major cities in the U.S. that can be found at band.video
[2:54:11.640 --> 2:54:17.640]  Austin, Texas is a microcosm for the progressive policies targeting homelessness
[2:54:17.640 --> 2:54:20.640]  Can you make me a criminal?
[2:54:20.640 --> 2:54:22.640]  I call it anything they said to do.
[2:54:22.640 --> 2:54:24.640]  What did I say?
[2:54:24.640 --> 2:54:31.640]  Well are you a criminal though? I mean we've had a camping van in Austin for 30 years
[2:54:31.640 --> 2:54:36.640]  so how do you feel about the mayor and the fact that he was given millions and millions of dollars
[2:54:36.640 --> 2:54:41.640]  and basically dragged his feet for a couple of years?
[2:54:41.640 --> 2:54:43.640]  There's a good question.
[2:54:43.640 --> 2:54:45.640]  They were very aware of it.
[2:54:45.640 --> 2:54:47.640]  They just couldn't think about it.
[2:54:47.640 --> 2:54:52.640]  Goaded on by the propaganda of the Austin American statesmen
[2:54:52.640 --> 2:54:57.640]  Austin City Council has predictably ignored the will of angered taxpayers
[2:54:57.640 --> 2:55:03.640]  taxpayers that voted overwhelmingly on a proposition that would remove the skid row
[2:55:03.640 --> 2:55:10.640]  californication of a once thriving downtown a popular destination that has been transformed
[2:55:10.640 --> 2:55:15.640]  from the live music capital of the world to a homeless industrial complex
[2:55:15.640 --> 2:55:21.640]  replete with a groundhog day rash of machete fights
[2:55:21.640 --> 2:55:25.640]  Calling by the mail, cut shoes and bags with a machete
[2:55:25.640 --> 2:55:26.640]  Tent fires.
[2:55:26.640 --> 2:55:30.640]  A prominent camp in downtown Austin was engulfed in flames this morning.
[2:55:30.640 --> 2:55:36.640]  The camp was on Cesar Chavez across from the central library and rampant drug use.
[2:55:36.640 --> 2:55:42.640]  Crews had to shut down the busy Austin road for hours today because of a fire underneath the street.
[2:55:42.640 --> 2:55:48.640]  Homeless people had made a camp down there complete with rooms, tons of trash and hundreds of needles.
[2:55:48.640 --> 2:55:52.640]  Battalion Chief Matt Cox says this camp has been around for about 10 years
[2:55:52.640 --> 2:55:54.640]  with anywhere from 20 to 100 people living here.
[2:55:54.640 --> 2:56:00.640]  A byproduct of the crisis caused by the massive closure of state psychiatric facilities
[2:56:00.640 --> 2:56:03.640]  that exponentially increased in 2005.
[2:56:03.640 --> 2:56:07.640]  People moving into cities and big extended families starting to fall apart.
[2:56:07.640 --> 2:56:12.640]  There were no places for people to go and no support systems, no community supports.
[2:56:12.640 --> 2:56:14.640]  So the hospital started getting more and more crowded.
[2:56:14.640 --> 2:56:22.640]  As 3.4% of Americans, more than 8 million people suffer from serious psychological problems.
[2:56:22.640 --> 2:56:28.640]  But rather than listen to their constituents' desperate concerns to deal with the problem
[2:56:28.640 --> 2:56:30.640]  compassionately and rationally.
[2:56:30.640 --> 2:56:35.640]  With the federal funding coming for the COVID relief, I think we actually can put in place
[2:56:35.640 --> 2:56:41.640]  the resources necessary to actually get people out of the tents and into a better, safer place.
[2:56:41.640 --> 2:56:45.640]  And this election, both sides, I think indicate that's what people want.
[2:56:45.640 --> 2:56:53.640]  The Austin City Council is secretly buying up hotels with millions of taxpayer and federal dollars
[2:56:53.640 --> 2:56:59.640]  to house chronic homelessness in residential areas that will attract thousands of homeless
[2:56:59.640 --> 2:57:05.640]  from out of state, ruining businesses, raising property taxes and threatening lives.
[2:57:05.640 --> 2:57:11.640]  Neighbors continue to protest plans to convert a northwest Austin hotel into a homeless shelter.
[2:57:11.640 --> 2:57:17.640]  Back in February, the city voted to buy the Candlewood Suites for 9.5 million dollars.
[2:57:17.640 --> 2:57:23.640]  That property sits near US 183 in the city of Austin, but it's also in Williamson County.
[2:57:23.640 --> 2:57:29.640]  Williamson County commissioners say they were kept in the dark about the plans and have filed a lawsuit to stop it.
[2:57:29.640 --> 2:57:36.640]  These hotels critically come with the level of mental health care, case management and job services
[2:57:36.640 --> 2:57:41.640]  that we need so that we can actually pull people out of homelessness, pull people out from under a bridge
[2:57:41.640 --> 2:57:46.640]  into one of these hotels and then actually connect them to stabilizing their lives.
[2:57:46.640 --> 2:57:48.640]  Rita just had an experience.
[2:57:48.640 --> 2:57:54.640]  People keep asking me, Alex, how did you predict over a year ago that food prices would explode within a year?
[2:57:54.640 --> 2:57:58.640]  Because it was in all the globalist actuaries that you shut down most of the world for a year,
[2:57:58.640 --> 2:58:03.640]  it's going to cause a collapse in food production and distribution and not just that.
[2:58:03.640 --> 2:58:06.640]  It's going to cause a renewal in every other major commodity.
[2:58:06.640 --> 2:58:08.640]  The globalist, what a post-industrial world.
[2:58:08.640 --> 2:58:10.640]  They're hitting us with economic war.
[2:58:10.640 --> 2:58:12.640]  I told you food prices would explode. They're now exploding.
[2:58:12.640 --> 2:58:15.640]  Our great sponsor, my patriot, has barely gone up in price.
[2:58:15.640 --> 2:58:19.640]  Their competitors have gone up even more, but they're about to go up in two weeks.
[2:58:19.640 --> 2:58:25.640]  But instead of just holding prices, they're still 10% off until Sunday evening and then it's got to go up.
[2:58:25.640 --> 2:58:31.640]  10% off at M4warstore.com 2020 prices in the year 2021.
[2:58:31.640 --> 2:58:35.640]  They've got to act now and buying their food from us funds the M4war a 360 win.
[2:58:35.640 --> 2:58:37.640]  It's ready to ship. They've got it on hand.
[2:58:37.640 --> 2:58:42.640]  Get yours before the scarcity and the line to start, which I think we'll see by next fall.
[2:58:42.640 --> 2:58:46.640]  Hell, a lot of shelves are already empty. This is crazy. We're being collapsed by design.
[2:58:46.640 --> 2:59:01.640]  Get ready now. Prepare with Alex.com.
[2:59:01.640 --> 2:59:15.640]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[2:59:15.640 --> 2:59:20.640]  Hello, hello. Great being on the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:20.640 --> 2:59:26.640]  We're in a very, very important time right now. This is very big.
[2:59:26.640 --> 2:59:32.640]  This is, it's a whole new world that has come about.
[2:59:32.640 --> 2:59:44.640]  And the reality is with the COVID war, with the implications are and the changes that have taken place.
[2:59:44.640 --> 2:59:56.640]  In 2020, the whole world changed. Who would have ever thought that a couple of politicians and the bureaucrats could lock down most of the world?
[2:59:56.640 --> 3:00:04.640]  It's not only the United States. It's everywhere except China, where the COVID war began.
[3:00:04.640 --> 3:00:14.640]  You go back to January 2020, Lunar New Year. How about Lunatic New Year?
[3:00:14.640 --> 3:00:20.640]  Read the Cover Valley Trends Journal back then, January 28th, coronavirus, 106 dead in China.
[3:00:20.640 --> 3:00:25.640]  It was all the news, all the news. 106 people died in China. Oh my God.
[3:00:25.640 --> 3:00:34.640]  Oh, there's only 1.4 billion and only about 1.5 million die every year from air pollution.
[3:00:34.640 --> 3:00:40.640]  That's why they wear these stupid masks all the time. Not all the time, but a lot.
[3:00:40.640 --> 3:00:43.640]  So what was going on back then?
[3:00:43.640 --> 3:00:52.640]  There were protests in Hong Kong. Couldn't stop them. I was on Hong Kong TV throughout 2019.
[3:00:52.640 --> 3:00:57.640]  Talked to the reporters, you know, the guys between breaks. So what's going on over there?
[3:00:57.640 --> 3:01:02.640]  Oh no, we're not going to stop. We're not going to let them rule us.
[3:01:02.640 --> 3:01:08.640]  Oh, people in Hong Kong can't stand the Chinese coming in there, even though they're Chinese.
[3:01:08.640 --> 3:01:15.640]  Ain't they a kind of cats? Arrogant, nasty.
[3:01:15.640 --> 3:01:19.640]  Hong Kong, a place with about 7 million people.
[3:01:19.640 --> 3:01:23.640]  A million people taken to the streets, a million out of 7 million.
[3:01:23.640 --> 3:01:32.640]  You can't get a million people in America out of 332 million to go marching one day against anything, just about.
[3:01:32.640 --> 3:01:38.640]  That's how much they were opposed. COVID war breaks out. China locks down everything.
[3:01:38.640 --> 3:01:45.640]  These are facts. And they stopped the Hong Kong protests. They couldn't stop them before.
[3:01:45.640 --> 3:01:50.640]  They could not stop them.
[3:01:50.640 --> 3:01:55.640]  So then they passed the security law. And now they're throwing them all in jail.
[3:01:55.640 --> 3:01:57.640]  Gone, finished.
[3:01:57.640 --> 3:02:03.640]  So going back to why this is so important, what we're talking about.
[3:02:03.640 --> 3:02:13.640]  The Chinese economy was the only economy, major economy that had positive gross domestic product in 2020.
[3:02:13.640 --> 3:02:17.640]  And I said the 20th century was the American century.
[3:02:17.640 --> 3:02:24.640]  The 21st century is going to be the Chinese century. The business of America has been war.
[3:02:24.640 --> 3:02:29.640]  The business of China has been business.
[3:02:29.640 --> 3:02:35.640]  Oh, yeah, you go to the veterans for peace thing, and they have that little clip down the bottom.
[3:02:35.640 --> 3:02:46.640]  We've only spent about six trillion dollars of our money since the lying, murderous piece of garbage, scum, low life.
[3:02:46.640 --> 3:02:50.640]  Little daddy's boy born on third base.
[3:02:50.640 --> 3:02:57.640]  Georgie Bush, another little nothing of a clown, a freak.
[3:02:57.640 --> 3:03:03.640]  And Alfred E. Newman from Med Magazine started the Afghan war.
[3:03:03.640 --> 3:03:09.640]  They're going to get that guy Osama Bin Laden dead or alive.
[3:03:09.640 --> 3:03:12.640]  Oh, you forgot that? Oh, yeah.
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:16.640]  And now they're there 20 years and now they're going to wind down the war.
[3:03:16.640 --> 3:03:32.640]  It only costs about six trillion dollars between that and the Iraq war based on lies by the murderous, slimy scum of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
[3:03:32.640 --> 3:03:37.640]  Oh, I might be censored for calling him a dick, Cheney.
[3:03:37.640 --> 3:03:40.640]  I should be more proper penis, Cheney.
[3:03:40.640 --> 3:03:42.640]  And how about his daughter? Now they're pushing her out.
[3:03:42.640 --> 3:03:48.640]  Another one born on third base, a Cheney girl over there thought she had a home run.
[3:03:48.640 --> 3:03:52.640]  It's one big club and you ain't in it as George Collins said, you got it.
[3:03:52.640 --> 3:03:56.640]  Look around.
[3:03:56.640 --> 3:04:01.640]  Going back, everything changed in 2020.
[3:04:01.640 --> 3:04:07.640]  2020 is a repeat of what that lying scum.
[3:04:07.640 --> 3:04:12.640]  Bush did and the demo craps and the repulsive kins.
[3:04:12.640 --> 3:04:15.640]  They came out with the Patriot Act.
[3:04:15.640 --> 3:04:20.640]  Could you get a better word or well couldn't have invented a better one.
[3:04:20.640 --> 3:04:23.640]  The Patriot Act.
[3:04:23.640 --> 3:04:27.640]  It's an unpatriotic act that has robbed us of our rights.
[3:04:27.640 --> 3:04:34.640]  Now we move into the COVID war and I got these little boys and girls over there playing governor, mayor or whatever.
[3:04:34.640 --> 3:04:40.640]  Telling us what to do, robbing us of our rights in the Constitution.
[3:04:40.640 --> 3:04:50.640]  You read the Trends Journal from last week and listen to me on the air before then.
[3:04:50.640 --> 3:04:54.640]  I said they're going to start loosening up the regulations.
[3:04:54.640 --> 3:04:59.640]  They know how bad the economy is going down.
[3:04:59.640 --> 3:05:02.640]  And that's exactly what they did.
[3:05:02.640 --> 3:05:04.640]  That other.
[3:05:04.640 --> 3:05:05.640]  Nothing.
[3:05:05.640 --> 3:05:07.640]  Again, one big club.
[3:05:07.640 --> 3:05:08.640]  Yeah.
[3:05:08.640 --> 3:05:15.640]  The one that went to Harvard, Harvard, Harvard Princeton, Yale, bullets, bombs and banks.
[3:05:15.640 --> 3:05:16.640]  Yeah.
[3:05:16.640 --> 3:05:24.640]  The one that's head of the CDC, the criminal defense contract.
[3:05:24.640 --> 3:05:28.640]  There's no sense of disease control and prevention.
[3:05:28.640 --> 3:05:34.640]  Listen to her last Wednesday on CNDC.
[3:05:34.640 --> 3:05:37.640]  Having a discussion.
[3:05:37.640 --> 3:05:40.640]  Well, the science is evolving.
[3:05:40.640 --> 3:05:41.640]  Things are moving.
[3:05:41.640 --> 3:05:48.640]  We don't know if we can, even if people are vaccinated, can they take the masks off?
[3:05:48.640 --> 3:05:49.640]  Yeah.
[3:05:49.640 --> 3:05:52.640]  That was on Wednesday.
[3:05:52.640 --> 3:05:54.640]  On Thursday.
[3:05:54.640 --> 3:05:56.640]  Up.
[3:05:56.640 --> 3:05:58.640]  Ms. Fatshaw-Bruth.
[3:05:58.640 --> 3:06:01.640]  Oh, I could say that because I go after Lola.
[3:06:01.640 --> 3:06:03.640]  L-O-L-A-Lola.
[3:06:03.640 --> 3:06:04.640]  Yeah.
[3:06:04.640 --> 3:06:08.640]  Our health secretary, Rachel Richard.
[3:06:08.640 --> 3:06:11.640]  Richard Rachel Levin.
[3:06:11.640 --> 3:06:15.640]  Again, I got these people telling me what to do.
[3:06:15.640 --> 3:06:18.640]  And bam, she turns around like that.
[3:06:18.640 --> 3:06:19.640]  On Thursday.
[3:06:19.640 --> 3:06:20.640]  Okay.
[3:06:20.640 --> 3:06:21.640]  You don't have to wear your masks.
[3:06:21.640 --> 3:06:24.640]  You don't have to wear your masks.
[3:06:24.640 --> 3:06:26.640]  Overnight.
[3:06:26.640 --> 3:06:27.640]  Overnight.
[3:06:27.640 --> 3:06:30.640]  And what I've been writing in the trends journal since the very beginning.
[3:06:30.640 --> 3:06:32.640]  They're making this crap up.
[3:06:32.640 --> 3:06:35.640]  There is no scientific areas.
[3:06:35.640 --> 3:06:38.640]  Get back, get back to where he once belonged.
[3:06:38.640 --> 3:06:39.640]  Yeah.
[3:06:39.640 --> 3:06:40.640]  Get back, Rachel.
[3:06:40.640 --> 3:06:41.640]  Yeah.
[3:06:41.640 --> 3:06:43.640]  They're making this crap up.
[3:06:43.640 --> 3:06:44.640]  Crap heads.
[3:06:44.640 --> 3:06:45.640]  Crapsters.
[3:06:45.640 --> 3:06:47.640]  The gang.
[3:06:47.640 --> 3:06:50.640]  The mob.
[3:06:50.640 --> 3:06:53.640]  No scientific evidence.
[3:06:53.640 --> 3:06:56.640]  And when it comes out, they push it away.
[3:06:56.640 --> 3:07:01.640]  Oh, you remember the Danish study that came out last November?
[3:07:01.640 --> 3:07:03.640]  That the masks are useless?
[3:07:03.640 --> 3:07:07.640]  You forgot that little lying, little scum freak, fouchy to fraud?
[3:07:07.640 --> 3:07:10.640]  Going back to March 2020.
[3:07:10.640 --> 3:07:12.640]  On CBS, they don't wear the mask.
[3:07:12.640 --> 3:07:13.640]  They don't do anything.
[3:07:13.640 --> 3:07:15.640]  Only sick people should wear them.
[3:07:15.640 --> 3:07:19.640]  CDC, New England Journal of Medicine, World Health Organization.
[3:07:19.640 --> 3:07:22.640]  All saying, no, no, don't wear them.
[3:07:22.640 --> 3:07:24.640]  And then they forced them to wear them.
[3:07:24.640 --> 3:07:26.640]  And then they turned around.
[3:07:26.640 --> 3:07:29.640]  They chased the thing in June of 2020.
[3:07:29.640 --> 3:07:39.640]  I'm saying this because you've just seen the control the government can have on the people.
[3:07:39.640 --> 3:07:47.640]  They are going to use the control that they have put on us to take more power away from us.
[3:07:47.640 --> 3:07:54.640]  This is going to be continuing because there are other big things happening.
[3:07:54.640 --> 3:07:59.640]  Remember one of the slogans I say, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[3:07:59.640 --> 3:08:05.640]  And boy, oh boy, oh, I got to say boy, oh girl, is war heating up.
[3:08:05.640 --> 3:08:09.640]  And when we get back, we're going to be talking more about that.
[3:08:09.640 --> 3:08:11.640]  It's ready to explode.
[3:08:11.640 --> 3:08:15.640]  And with it, so too will oil prices.
[3:08:15.640 --> 3:08:18.640]  And you think inflation's bad now?
[3:08:18.640 --> 3:08:20.640]  You haven't seen anything yet?
[3:08:20.640 --> 3:08:25.640]  Well, can't figure out why gold just spiked up so much today.
[3:08:25.640 --> 3:08:29.640]  And silver, just as we had forecast.
[3:08:29.640 --> 3:08:34.640]  Unfortunately, the worst is yet to come.
[3:08:34.640 --> 3:08:40.640]  And when we come back, we're going to tell you how to prepare, prevail, and prosper.
[3:08:40.640 --> 3:08:50.640]  We'll be right back.
[3:09:10.640 --> 3:09:20.640]  We'll be right back.
[3:09:40.640 --> 3:09:51.640]  I'm not going to say this five times on the road of the obnoxious.
[3:09:51.640 --> 3:09:54.640]  I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals.
[3:09:54.640 --> 3:10:04.640]  Last week, the arch globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass and workers, medical doctors,
[3:10:04.640 --> 3:10:10.640]  scientists, nurses, you name it, have taken the so-called COVID-19 franken shot.
[3:10:10.640 --> 3:10:12.640]  I'm going to say it the second time.
[3:10:12.640 --> 3:10:19.640]  Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the franken shots.
[3:10:19.640 --> 3:10:21.640]  They don't trust it.
[3:10:21.640 --> 3:10:23.640]  You shouldn't trust it.
[3:10:23.640 --> 3:10:25.640]  The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world.
[3:10:25.640 --> 3:10:28.640]  This is an attack on the American people, the people of the world.
[3:10:28.640 --> 3:10:32.640]  This is an absolute red flag smoking gun.
[3:10:32.640 --> 3:10:34.640]  Please say it two more times.
[3:10:34.640 --> 3:10:40.640]  Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff refused to take the vaccines.
[3:10:40.640 --> 3:10:44.640]  That's right, the doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine.
[3:10:44.640 --> 3:10:46.640]  And you, you shouldn't either.
[3:10:46.640 --> 3:10:51.640]  And you should warn everyone you know about the truth.
[3:10:51.640 --> 3:10:59.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:10:59.640 --> 3:11:06.640]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[3:11:06.640 --> 3:11:09.640]  Great being on the Alex Jones show.
[3:11:09.640 --> 3:11:11.640]  I'm very, very pleased to be here.
[3:11:11.640 --> 3:11:19.640]  And I admire what Alex does in the crew to bring people together.
[3:11:19.640 --> 3:11:29.640]  And as you may know or may not know, I launched Occupy Peace, way back in, way back, 2015, OccupyPeace.com.
[3:11:29.640 --> 3:11:39.640]  And I'm a believer in America and what the country stands for in the founding fathers.
[3:11:39.640 --> 3:11:49.640]  Beginning with George Washington, a real president, a guy that fought, not like these little boys that couldn't fight the way of a paper bag.
[3:11:49.640 --> 3:11:55.640]  And his farewell address is no foreign entanglements.
[3:11:55.640 --> 3:12:05.640]  And I'm mentioning this because what's going on now in Israel is that there's no foreign entanglements.
[3:12:05.640 --> 3:12:11.640]  And I'm mentioning this because what's going on now in Israel and Palestine.
[3:12:11.640 --> 3:12:13.640]  I want to make this real clear.
[3:12:13.640 --> 3:12:21.640]  Don't call me an anti-Semite anybody when I call things out the way I see them.
[3:12:21.640 --> 3:12:27.640]  I just talked about America, that the business of China is business.
[3:12:27.640 --> 3:12:33.640]  And that's the way they're going to be the head of the 21st century and the business of America's war.
[3:12:33.640 --> 3:12:35.640]  So don't call me an anti-American.
[3:12:35.640 --> 3:12:37.640]  I'm a pro-American.
[3:12:37.640 --> 3:12:45.640]  I own the most historic buildings in America, on the most historic four corners of America, where the seeds of democracy was sown.
[3:12:45.640 --> 3:12:47.640]  And I bought them only for that reason.
[3:12:47.640 --> 3:12:51.640]  And right over there, I can almost tell it with a stone.
[3:12:51.640 --> 3:12:55.640]  It was a young guy, could have.
[3:12:55.640 --> 3:13:03.640]  Is where the Constitution for Kingston, New York was written when it was the capital of New York State.
[3:13:03.640 --> 3:13:11.640]  And John Jay, the first, you know, Chief Supreme Court Justice there, he was a judge over here.
[3:13:11.640 --> 3:13:23.640]  And the Constitution that was written to New York State over here in Kingston when it was the first capital, over 70% of America's Constitution comes from that.
[3:13:23.640 --> 3:13:29.640]  And the British burnt the place down, and that's why they moved the capital to Albany.
[3:13:29.640 --> 3:13:33.640]  And I was the assistant, by the way, of the Secretary of the New York State Senate up in Albany.
[3:13:33.640 --> 3:13:41.640]  So I know a little bit about this stuff, about how disgusting the political system is.
[3:13:41.640 --> 3:13:49.640]  So when I talk about democracy in America and what the country stands for, and the four corners of freedom over here,
[3:13:49.640 --> 3:13:55.640]  I'm an anti-American when I come out against murderers and start wars based on lies.
[3:13:55.640 --> 3:14:01.640]  Look how much product we're importing from Vietnam.
[3:14:01.640 --> 3:14:07.640]  I'm of the age of the Vietnam War when we're all getting drafted.
[3:14:07.640 --> 3:14:11.640]  Oh, here's the commies, they're going to take over.
[3:14:11.640 --> 3:14:17.640]  We let Vietnam get the commie over there, and the dominoes are going to keep falling, they're going to hit California.
[3:14:17.640 --> 3:14:19.640]  I'm not making that up.
[3:14:19.640 --> 3:14:23.640]  That's the crap they were shoving down our throat.
[3:14:23.640 --> 3:14:27.640]  But it's okay to do business with the commies, huh?
[3:14:27.640 --> 3:14:29.640]  And Communist China, huh?
[3:14:29.640 --> 3:14:31.640]  That's different.
[3:14:31.640 --> 3:14:33.640]  All about money.
[3:14:33.640 --> 3:14:37.640]  Now we'll go back to what's going on.
[3:14:37.640 --> 3:14:39.640]  Yep, here we go.
[3:14:39.640 --> 3:14:45.640]  Israel and the bombing and what's going on in Gaza.
[3:14:45.640 --> 3:14:49.640]  You go back and read our trends journals.
[3:14:49.640 --> 3:15:01.640]  Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, could not put together a coalition to have him run the country.
[3:15:01.640 --> 3:15:03.640]  Four elections in two years.
[3:15:03.640 --> 3:15:07.640]  Four.
[3:15:07.640 --> 3:15:09.640]  Again, these are just facts.
[3:15:09.640 --> 3:15:13.640]  And don't call me an anti-Semite because I'm doing this.
[3:15:13.640 --> 3:15:19.640]  And by the way, three of my last four girlfriends were Jewish.
[3:15:19.640 --> 3:15:21.640]  And you know that joke?
[3:15:21.640 --> 3:15:27.640]  You know why Jewish men die before their lives?
[3:15:27.640 --> 3:15:29.640]  They want to.
[3:15:29.640 --> 3:15:31.640]  Oh, it's a joke, it's a joke.
[3:15:31.640 --> 3:15:33.640]  I call out Cuomo.
[3:15:33.640 --> 3:15:37.640]  I call out Fauci.
[3:15:37.640 --> 3:15:44.640]  I call out that slimer who's running Italy, the prime minister, Draghi.
[3:15:44.640 --> 3:15:53.640]  If they name was Draghi Steen or Fauci or Cuomo Berg, then I'd be an anti-Semite.
[3:15:53.640 --> 3:15:56.640]  So I call it out the way I see it.
[3:15:56.640 --> 3:16:13.640]  And what's going on now with Israel bombing Gaza, 38,000 people, according to the United Nations, have nowhere to go.
[3:16:13.640 --> 3:16:26.640]  2,500 have lost their homes or now they're gone.
[3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:27.640]  How did it start?
[3:16:27.640 --> 3:16:30.640]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[3:16:30.640 --> 3:16:34.640]  Netanyahu couldn't win the election.
[3:16:34.640 --> 3:16:45.640]  And this broke out last Monday, there was a deal that was being put together with the Arab coalition in Israel.
[3:16:45.640 --> 3:16:50.640]  20% of Israel is Palestinian.
[3:16:50.640 --> 3:16:56.640]  And the right-wing faction, they were going to bring in a new government and get rid of Netanyahu.
[3:16:56.640 --> 3:16:58.640]  These are facts.
[3:16:58.640 --> 3:17:02.640]  All your facts are detailed in the Trends Journal.
[3:17:02.640 --> 3:17:05.640]  And more this week.
[3:17:05.640 --> 3:17:08.640]  Oh, they're shooting rockets over there.
[3:17:08.640 --> 3:17:10.640]  Rockets compared to the bombs.
[3:17:10.640 --> 3:17:12.640]  And why are they shooting rockets?
[3:17:12.640 --> 3:17:24.640]  Oh, it couldn't be because last Saturday and Sunday, the Israeli troops, a thousand of them went into the mosque shooting, you know, stun grenades and rubber bullets.
[3:17:24.640 --> 3:17:25.640]  No, no, no.
[3:17:25.640 --> 3:17:27.640]  You're a militant.
[3:17:27.640 --> 3:17:31.640]  If you're a militant in a rock, if you want to get the Americans out,
[3:17:31.640 --> 3:17:36.640]  you're a militant in Afghanistan, if you want to get the occupying Americans out,
[3:17:36.640 --> 3:17:43.640]  and you're a militant when you fight against murder.
[3:17:43.640 --> 3:17:47.640]  How about paybacks a bitch?
[3:17:47.640 --> 3:17:53.640]  Netanyahu, we wrote in the Trends Journal when all else fails, they take you to war.
[3:17:53.640 --> 3:17:56.640]  And they're taking us to war.
[3:17:56.640 --> 3:18:00.640]  This is unprecedented, what's going on.
[3:18:00.640 --> 3:18:07.640]  And we, the people of the United States, the rockets, by the way, that they're shooting into Israel,
[3:18:07.640 --> 3:18:18.640]  where they killed about 10 people so far and two children, over 200 Palestinians are dead, about 40 children, 53 women, on and on.
[3:18:18.640 --> 3:18:20.640]  And we, the people are paying for this.
[3:18:20.640 --> 3:18:24.640]  Israel has better education system, better healthcare system than us,
[3:18:24.640 --> 3:18:31.640]  and we're sending in over $3 billion a year, some 38 billion bucks.
[3:18:31.640 --> 3:18:33.640]  I don't want my money going to Israel.
[3:18:33.640 --> 3:18:35.640]  Don't want it going to Italy.
[3:18:35.640 --> 3:18:37.640]  Don't want it going to Ireland.
[3:18:37.640 --> 3:18:40.640]  Don't want it going to anywhere but America.
[3:18:40.640 --> 3:18:47.640]  Oh, yeah, I want it going to people if there's a hurricane or some disaster, natural disaster, let's help out.
[3:18:47.640 --> 3:18:49.640]  I'm totally against this.
[3:18:49.640 --> 3:18:54.640]  I'm an American.
[3:18:54.640 --> 3:19:00.640]  As Eisenhower said, five-star general, supreme commander of the Allied Forces, two-term president.
[3:19:00.640 --> 3:19:05.640]  The military industrial complex is robbing the nation of the genius of scientists.
[3:19:05.640 --> 3:19:09.640]  Swear to the laborers in the future of the children.
[3:19:09.640 --> 3:19:12.640]  That's all this is.
[3:19:12.640 --> 3:19:20.640]  This doesn't end. You're going to start seeing bloodshed throughout the Middle East like we've never seen before.
[3:19:20.640 --> 3:19:24.640]  Because the Arab nations are now coalescing against Israel.
[3:19:24.640 --> 3:19:27.640]  This has to stop.
[3:19:27.640 --> 3:19:29.640]  We need peace on earth.
[3:19:29.640 --> 3:19:33.640]  Goodwill to men.
[3:19:33.640 --> 3:19:37.640]  This thing continues. You're going to see oil prices spike.
[3:19:37.640 --> 3:19:40.640]  This is what I was talking about before.
[3:19:40.640 --> 3:19:47.640]  We're going to be back and talk about the invocation.
[3:19:47.640 --> 3:19:50.640]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me.
[3:19:50.640 --> 3:19:56.640]  And it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly.
[3:19:56.640 --> 3:20:00.640]  For prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[3:20:00.640 --> 3:20:02.640]  And we're all in this together.
[3:20:02.640 --> 3:20:07.640]  You know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I've got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:20:07.640 --> 3:20:14.640]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:20:14.640 --> 3:20:16.640]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:20:16.640 --> 3:20:18.640]  They crippled all the other groups.
[3:20:18.640 --> 3:20:19.640]  And we're still here.
[3:20:19.640 --> 3:20:23.640]  And as this whole new world order comes out and be open, our credibility is going up.
[3:20:23.640 --> 3:20:25.640]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:20:25.640 --> 3:20:27.640]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:20:27.640 --> 3:20:29.640]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved.
[3:20:29.640 --> 3:20:31.640]  And America is still quasi-free.
[3:20:31.640 --> 3:20:36.640]  You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:20:36.640 --> 3:20:38.640]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:20:38.640 --> 3:20:39.640]  So thank you all.
[3:20:39.640 --> 3:20:41.640]  And get in there, forwardstore.com.
[3:20:41.640 --> 3:20:43.640]  Get some great 2020 election shirts.
[3:20:43.640 --> 3:20:44.640]  Supplements and so much more.

[3:20:45.640 --> 3:20:46.640]  And they support the M4.
[3:20:46.640 --> 3:20:47.640]  Thank you.
[3:20:47.640 --> 3:20:48.640]  Listen up, patriots.
[3:20:48.640 --> 3:20:54.640]  I'm running a sale that's the biggest I've ever run on three products that are already selling out.
[3:20:54.640 --> 3:20:59.640]  Well, then why am I selling it then at 50% off or 60% off depending on which sale you go with?
[3:20:59.640 --> 3:21:01.640]  Because I know a lot of you are on the fence.
[3:21:01.640 --> 3:21:02.640]  You haven't tried it.
[3:21:02.640 --> 3:21:03.640]  And I know you're going to get hooked once you do.
[3:21:03.640 --> 3:21:12.640]  So for one week only, we're running 50% off on ultimate fish oil, 50% off on winter sun with D3 and K-3 immune system.
[3:21:12.640 --> 3:21:14.640]  And oh my gosh, people love this so much.
[3:21:14.640 --> 3:21:16.640]  It's sold out for months back in limited supply.
[3:21:16.640 --> 3:21:20.640]  Turbo force, 10 hour clean energy is 40% off.
[3:21:20.640 --> 3:21:26.640]  But you can get them all three together in the optimum trifecta pack for 60% off.
[3:21:26.640 --> 3:21:28.640]  We've never offered that on these products.
[3:21:28.640 --> 3:21:30.640]  It's basically a lost leader.
[3:21:30.640 --> 3:21:31.640]  I want you to get them.
[3:21:31.640 --> 3:21:32.640]  I want you to try them.
[3:21:32.640 --> 3:21:33.640]  I want you to love them.
[3:21:33.640 --> 3:21:35.640]  So believe me, you're going to be a blown away.
[3:21:35.640 --> 3:21:37.640]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[3:21:37.640 --> 3:21:39.640]  We're running this Monday through Sunday.
[3:21:39.640 --> 3:21:41.640]  And the deal is over.
[3:21:41.640 --> 3:21:42.640]  Best deal ever.
[3:21:42.640 --> 3:21:48.640]  Take advantage of it at infowarstore.com and fund the Info War.
[3:21:48.640 --> 3:21:54.640]  Two weeks ago, I launched a sale on all the high quality storeable foods and prepare it with Alex.com.
[3:21:54.640 --> 3:22:01.640]  And I pointed out that the Bloomberg Global Food Index shows that current crop purchases being made for the end of the summer
[3:22:01.640 --> 3:22:05.640]  when the crops are completed around the world is up 76%.
[3:22:05.640 --> 3:22:08.640]  That alone will cause civil unrest, major problems.
[3:22:08.640 --> 3:22:11.640]  Since then, inflation has exploded the last two weeks.
[3:22:11.640 --> 3:22:13.640]  You've seen the pipeline crises.
[3:22:13.640 --> 3:22:16.640]  You've seen Governor Whitmer shutting down or trying to set up a pipeline in Michigan.
[3:22:16.640 --> 3:22:17.640]  This is a concerted operation.
[3:22:17.640 --> 3:22:23.640]  And so Listers had a huge response to our big sale, 2020 prices in the year 2021.
[3:22:23.640 --> 3:22:26.640]  10% off all storeable foods for Paradolics.com.
[3:22:26.640 --> 3:22:33.640]  Now, the sale ended yesterday, so I'm now, because a lot of requests extending it through Sunday and that it absolutely has to end.
[3:22:33.640 --> 3:22:39.640]  So, one month, three months, six months, your supplies, highest quality water filters, and so much more.
[3:22:39.640 --> 3:22:40.640]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[3:22:40.640 --> 3:22:44.640]  It's the best food you're going to find on high quality storeable food for you and your family and your community.
[3:22:44.640 --> 3:22:47.640]  Get ready now at Paradolics.com.
[3:22:47.640 --> 3:22:51.640]  Warning, warning, warning.
[3:22:51.640 --> 3:22:55.640]  The globalists have launched a massive counter offensive against populist forces worldwide.
[3:22:55.640 --> 3:22:56.640]  They are censoring.
[3:22:56.640 --> 3:22:57.640]  They are attacking.
[3:22:57.640 --> 3:22:59.640]  They are arresting patriots all over the world.
[3:22:59.640 --> 3:23:08.640]  Churches in Europe, Australia, the UK and Canada, and even California and New York are being swat-teamed and closed because they're non-essential.
[3:23:08.640 --> 3:23:10.640]  The tyranny is incredible.
[3:23:10.640 --> 3:23:18.640]  But in areas like Texas and South Dakota and Florida where we have a history of more liberty, all the lockdowns are over, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:23:18.640 --> 3:23:19.640]  This is martial law.
[3:23:19.640 --> 3:23:22.640]  This has all been a massive martial law drill.
[3:23:22.640 --> 3:23:27.640]  And now it's more important than ever to spread the word about InfoWars and to support InfoWars.
[3:23:27.640 --> 3:23:32.640]  We have three of our best-selling products selling out, but despite that, they're all massively discounted.
[3:23:32.640 --> 3:23:35.640]  TurboForce, it's 40% off.
[3:23:35.640 --> 3:23:40.640]  We've got Ultimate Fish Oil, 50% off, and Winter Sun for your immune system.
[3:23:40.640 --> 3:23:41.640]  It's 50% off as well.
[3:23:41.640 --> 3:23:42.640]  Best deal ever.
[3:23:42.640 --> 3:23:47.640]  Take advantage of it at InfoWarsStore.com and fund the InfoWars.
[3:23:47.640 --> 3:23:52.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:24:07.640 --> 3:24:12.640]  Waging war on corruption, it's Gerald Salente.
[3:24:12.640 --> 3:24:16.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:24:16.640 --> 3:24:23.640]  It's great being on the Alex Jones Show, and I appreciate what Alex Jones does in the staff.
[3:24:23.640 --> 3:24:24.640]  Great team.
[3:24:24.640 --> 3:24:27.640]  And you have to do everything you can to support them.
[3:24:27.640 --> 3:24:28.640]  Support the truth.
[3:24:28.640 --> 3:24:30.640]  Alex doesn't censor me.
[3:24:30.640 --> 3:24:32.640]  I say what I want to say.
[3:24:32.640 --> 3:24:34.640]  You know, we talk to each other.
[3:24:34.640 --> 3:24:38.640]  You know, he said, Gerald, there's no censorship here.
[3:24:38.640 --> 3:24:44.640]  I mean, you know, not agree with you, but you know, you say what you want to say.
[3:24:44.640 --> 3:24:50.640]  And I'm saying this because we need to keep freedom alive, and they're killing it.
[3:24:50.640 --> 3:24:51.640]  They're destroying it.
[3:24:51.640 --> 3:24:53.640]  They're censoring it.
[3:24:53.640 --> 3:24:57.640]  So it's up to you to do what you can to support InfoWars.
[3:24:57.640 --> 3:25:03.640]  And the way you do it is by putting your money where your heart is, and where your head is,
[3:25:03.640 --> 3:25:05.640]  and where your health is.
[3:25:05.640 --> 3:25:17.640]  And now is a good time to do it because they're all new sales are here with up to 60% off top selling products.
[3:25:17.640 --> 3:25:27.640]  And because of the slow destruction of the supply chain, you know, they're having to end sales on some of their fan favorite products.
[3:25:27.640 --> 3:25:35.640]  But we want you to be able to turbo charge your body's natural defenses for less.
[3:25:35.640 --> 3:25:47.640]  So InfoWars are bringing you fresh new sales on other classic InfoWars live products, including a few that have been sold out for months.
[3:25:47.640 --> 3:25:53.640]  You got that iconic physics magnesium drink mix 1995.
[3:25:53.640 --> 3:25:55.640]  That's the introductory pricing.
[3:25:55.640 --> 3:26:12.640]  And InfoWars optimum trifecta packs 60% off turbo force 40% off ultimate fish oil 50% off ultimate krill oil 25% off ultimate fish oil and krill oil combo.
[3:26:12.640 --> 3:26:24.640]  You get the two 50% off survival shield x2 50% off winter sun products 50% off and all storeable foods 10% off.
[3:26:24.640 --> 3:26:30.640]  And that's being extended for three days and the t shirts from 1776 t shirts.
[3:26:30.640 --> 3:26:34.640]  That's right. $17 and 76 cents.
[3:26:34.640 --> 3:26:49.640]  So visit info wars.com and get these best selling items up to 60% off before they run out of these these products because you're going to miss out on some massive savings because things are running out.
[3:26:49.640 --> 3:26:56.640]  You see again we write about the inflation and remember your purchase of these products is a 360 win.
[3:26:56.640 --> 3:27:06.640]  You get super high quality items and you help launch the info war to the next level and that's where it needs to go.
[3:27:06.640 --> 3:27:13.640]  We all need to go to the higher level and they're doing all they can to make it happen.
[3:27:13.640 --> 3:27:22.640]  And as I said price is only going to go up. We're in an inflation cycle here and that they're keeping these prices at these levels is wow.
[3:27:22.640 --> 3:27:25.640]  And again the inflation cycle is real.
[3:27:25.640 --> 3:27:29.640]  You got copper the copper we call it almost at an all time high.
[3:27:29.640 --> 3:27:31.640]  It just came down a little bit.
[3:27:31.640 --> 3:27:37.640]  You call it doctor copper because copper is using everything from high tech to heavy industry.
[3:27:37.640 --> 3:27:46.640]  So that tells you where the demand and where inflation is going going back to what's going on in Israel.
[3:27:46.640 --> 3:27:59.640]  You see Brent crude before I went on the air was just touching $70 a barrel Brent crude spikes up to $80 90 a barrel.
[3:27:59.640 --> 3:28:14.640]  Here we got the copper. It goes up and people aren't you're going to see consumption going way down as inflation keeps going way up.
[3:28:14.640 --> 3:28:24.640]  If oil prices break into the hundred dollar barrel range you are going to see a global economic crash like that.
[3:28:24.640 --> 3:28:30.640]  But within a blink of an eye gone.
[3:28:30.640 --> 3:28:33.640]  Inflation is the big worry here.
[3:28:33.640 --> 3:28:39.640]  Before I get into inflation where it's going and what it means I want to go back to what's going on in Israel.
[3:28:39.640 --> 3:28:46.640]  Again we've been writing about this and in this edition we're going to have a special report.
[3:28:46.640 --> 3:28:50.640]  And so how it started.
[3:28:50.640 --> 3:28:55.640]  In last week's Trends Journal Israeli troops storm mosque bomb Gaza.
[3:28:55.640 --> 3:29:05.640]  We reported that a thousand about a thousand Israeli security forces storm the Alaska mosque in East Jerusalem injuring more than 300 Palestinians.
[3:29:05.640 --> 3:29:14.640]  Israeli police said the raid was in response to Palestinians who threw stones and watched fireworks during an earlier demonstration.
[3:29:14.640 --> 3:29:21.640]  They threw stones and launched fireworks and you're going with a thousand troops into a mosque or during Holy Week.
[3:29:21.640 --> 3:29:23.640]  Oh yeah. OK.
[3:29:23.640 --> 3:29:27.640]  Now.
[3:29:27.640 --> 3:29:33.640]  As reported in this Sunday's New York Times.
[3:29:33.640 --> 3:29:39.640]  Now remember the New York Times is pro Israeli.
[3:29:39.640 --> 3:29:45.640]  Twenty seven days before Hamas fired a rocket into Israel.
[3:29:45.640 --> 3:29:50.640]  An Israeli police squad storm the Oscar.
[3:29:50.640 --> 3:29:53.640]  Ah Samas in Jerusalem.
[3:29:53.640 --> 3:29:57.640]  This isn't the one I just mentioned is before that.
[3:29:57.640 --> 3:30:05.640]  Pushing parishioners aside and cut the cable to their loudspeakers that were broadcasting prayers.
[3:30:05.640 --> 3:30:07.640]  The Times wrote quote.
[3:30:07.640 --> 3:30:10.640]  The police raid on the mosque.
[3:30:10.640 --> 3:30:28.640]  One of the holiest sites in Islam was one of several actions that led less than a month later to the sudden resumption of war between Israel and Hamas.
[3:30:28.640 --> 3:30:30.640]  All right.
[3:30:30.640 --> 3:30:37.640]  And then what else did Hamas do. Excuse me what Israel did.
[3:30:37.640 --> 3:30:51.640]  They bombed a 13 story office building and apartment complex that has Al Jazeera.
[3:30:51.640 --> 3:30:53.640]  And.
[3:30:53.640 --> 3:30:56.640]  Associated press.
[3:30:56.640 --> 3:30:58.640]  That's right.
[3:30:58.640 --> 3:31:02.640]  Kill the media so they can't tell you what's going on.
[3:31:02.640 --> 3:31:04.640]  Oh no.
[3:31:04.640 --> 3:31:08.640]  We blew it up because Hamas was in there.
[3:31:08.640 --> 3:31:11.640]  Hamas was in there.
[3:31:11.640 --> 3:31:13.640]  Well guess what.
[3:31:13.640 --> 3:31:18.640]  Just today they asked our US Secretary of State.
[3:31:18.640 --> 3:31:22.640]  Little boy blinking to blink.
[3:31:22.640 --> 3:31:24.640]  That.
[3:31:24.640 --> 3:31:26.640]  No proof.
[3:31:26.640 --> 3:31:30.640]  Israel has provided no proof.
[3:31:30.640 --> 3:31:35.640]  That Hamas had anything to do with anything there.
[3:31:35.640 --> 3:31:39.640]  13 story building.
[3:31:39.640 --> 3:31:42.640]  People living it.
[3:31:42.640 --> 3:31:44.640]  Oh they fired rockets.
[3:31:44.640 --> 3:31:47.640]  When Israel has some of the most sophisticated weaponry in the world.
[3:31:47.640 --> 3:31:51.640]  Oh including nuclear bombs.
[3:31:51.640 --> 3:31:58.640]  You know only about 300 of them depending on whose numbers you look at.
[3:31:58.640 --> 3:32:03.640]  This is getting out of control.
[3:32:03.640 --> 3:32:04.640]  Again.
[3:32:04.640 --> 3:32:10.640]  We only write the details.
[3:32:10.640 --> 3:32:17.640]  And blinking was asked how to ease tensions and he said he doesn't know.
[3:32:17.640 --> 3:32:20.640]  So there's where we're at.
[3:32:20.640 --> 3:32:22.640]  There's no press.
[3:32:22.640 --> 3:32:24.640]  And they're killing people.
[3:32:24.640 --> 3:32:26.640]  This has to stop.
[3:32:26.640 --> 3:32:29.640]  Again I launched occupied peace and on May 29th.
[3:32:29.640 --> 3:32:31.640]  I'm having a rally here.
[3:32:31.640 --> 3:32:32.640]  There it goes.
[3:32:32.640 --> 3:32:33.640]  Look at this.
[3:32:33.640 --> 3:32:36.640]  Look at this.
[3:32:36.640 --> 3:32:42.640]  You think there's going to be blowback.
[3:32:42.640 --> 3:32:44.640]  You think there's going to be blowback.
[3:32:44.640 --> 3:32:47.640]  Suppose this was your office, your house, you have everything in there.
[3:32:47.640 --> 3:32:49.640]  And it's gone.
[3:32:49.640 --> 3:32:56.640]  And that part about this too is this is going to cause more anti-Semitism.
[3:32:56.640 --> 3:33:00.640]  We have to stop this.
[3:33:00.640 --> 3:33:04.640]  The world is coming out against this.
[3:33:04.640 --> 3:33:08.640]  Yeah there's going to be the people supportive but a lot aren't.
[3:33:08.640 --> 3:33:14.640]  I'm having a rally to unite for freedom, peace and justice.
[3:33:14.640 --> 3:33:17.640]  Because if we don't.
[3:33:17.640 --> 3:33:19.640]  We're looking at the third world war.
[3:33:19.640 --> 3:33:22.640]  This thing blows up in the Middle East.
[3:33:22.640 --> 3:33:26.640]  They asked Einstein what kind of weapons will be used to fight the third world war.
[3:33:26.640 --> 3:33:28.640]  He said I don't know.
[3:33:28.640 --> 3:33:30.640]  There's a guy with the atomic bomb, right?
[3:33:30.640 --> 3:33:34.640]  He said but they'll be using sticks and stones to fight the fourth.
[3:33:34.640 --> 3:33:37.640]  So again, do everything you can to support peace.
[3:33:37.640 --> 3:33:47.640]  Go to OccupyPeace.com, OccupyPeace.com and support InfoWars.
[3:34:08.640 --> 3:34:12.640]  50% off on winter some with D3 and K-3 immune system.
[3:34:12.640 --> 3:34:16.640]  Oh my gosh, people love this so much but sold out for months back in limited supply.
[3:34:16.640 --> 3:34:20.640]  Turbo force 10 hour clean energy is 40% off.
[3:34:20.640 --> 3:34:26.640]  But you can get them all three together in the optimum trifecta pack for 60% off.
[3:34:26.640 --> 3:34:28.640]  We've never offered that on these products.
[3:34:28.640 --> 3:34:30.640]  It's basically a lost leader.
[3:34:30.640 --> 3:34:31.640]  I want you to get them.
[3:34:31.640 --> 3:34:32.640]  I want you to try them.
[3:34:32.640 --> 3:34:33.640]  I want you to love them.
[3:34:33.640 --> 3:34:35.640]  So believe me, you're going to be a blown away.
[3:34:35.640 --> 3:34:37.640]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:34:37.640 --> 3:34:40.640]  We're running this Monday through Sunday and the deal is over.
[3:34:40.640 --> 3:35:06.640]  Best deal ever, take advantage of it at InfoWarsStore.com and fund the Info War.

[3:35:16.640 --> 3:35:17.640]  It tastes great.

[3:35:20.640 --> 3:35:25.640]  It is so essential in my life and I hope all of you will check it out and try it.
[3:35:25.640 --> 3:35:28.640]  It's available at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[3:35:28.640 --> 3:35:32.640]  This is the best formula from our research you're going to find out there.
[3:35:32.640 --> 3:35:36.640]  So if you've already enjoyed other magnesium formulas, give this one a try.
[3:35:36.640 --> 3:35:41.640]  I think you're going to love it at the same time it funds the Info War, which is a true 360 win.
[3:35:41.640 --> 3:35:47.640]  Now exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com for only $19.95.
[3:35:47.640 --> 3:35:53.640]  People keep asking me, Alex, how did you predict over a year ago that food prices would explode within a year?
[3:35:53.640 --> 3:35:57.640]  Because it was in all the globalist actuaries that you shut down most of the world for a year.
[3:35:57.640 --> 3:36:02.640]  It's going to cause a collapse in food production and distribution and not just that.
[3:36:02.640 --> 3:36:04.640]  Fuel and every other major commodity.
[3:36:04.640 --> 3:36:06.640]  The globalist, what a post-industrial world.
[3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:08.640]  They're hitting us with the economic war.
[3:36:08.640 --> 3:36:10.640]  I told you food prices would explode. They're now exploding.
[3:36:10.640 --> 3:36:13.640]  Our great sponsor, my patriot, has barely gone up in price.
[3:36:13.640 --> 3:36:17.640]  Their competitors have gone up even more, but they're about to go up in two weeks.
[3:36:17.640 --> 3:36:23.640]  But instead of just holding prices, they're still 10% off until Sunday evening and then it's got to go up.
[3:36:23.640 --> 3:36:29.640]  10% off at InfoWarsStore.com 2020 prices in the year 2021.
[3:36:29.640 --> 3:36:34.640]  But you've got to act now and buying your food from us funds the InfoWars a 360 win.
[3:36:34.640 --> 3:36:36.640]  It's ready to ship. They've got it on hand.
[3:36:36.640 --> 3:36:41.640]  Get yours before the scarcity and the line start, which I think we'll see by next fall.
[3:36:41.640 --> 3:36:45.640]  Hell, a lot of shelves are already empty. This is crazy. We're being collapsed by design.
[3:36:45.640 --> 3:36:47.640]  Get ready now. Prepare with Alex.com.
[3:36:47.640 --> 3:36:51.640]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[3:36:51.640 --> 3:36:56.640]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity and all the terrible things that are unfolding,
[3:36:56.640 --> 3:37:00.640]  I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[3:37:00.640 --> 3:37:04.640]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[3:37:04.640 --> 3:37:13.640]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry,
[3:37:13.640 --> 3:37:16.640]  people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[3:37:16.640 --> 3:37:21.640]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared. They're looking for leadership.
[3:37:21.640 --> 3:37:23.640]  Well, that's where InfoWars comes in.

[3:37:31.640 --> 3:37:37.640]  what the globalists will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[3:37:37.640 --> 3:37:42.640]  That's our job, so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire,

[3:38:37.640 --> 3:38:42.640]  You're doing everything to censor freedom of the speech.
[3:38:42.640 --> 3:38:47.640]  You're going to do everything they can to lock it down and these lockdowns, by the way,
[3:38:47.640 --> 3:38:50.640]  as I mentioned at the beginning of the broadcast are just one example.
[3:38:50.640 --> 3:38:58.080]  the power the government has stolen from us in a country near you I want to go
[3:38:58.080 --> 3:39:08.960]  back quickly on the mask charade that this CDC threw out is Dr. Walinsky this
[3:39:08.960 --> 3:39:15.080]  will be in this week's Trends Journal as recently as March 30th Dr. Lewinsky's
[3:39:15.080 --> 3:39:21.640]  mood was literally one of impending covid doom that's precisely what she
[3:39:21.640 --> 3:39:26.040]  called it participating in a briefing on that date she appeared to grow
[3:39:26.040 --> 3:39:33.320]  emotional as she shared her inter intermost feelings with those assembled
[3:39:33.320 --> 3:39:39.680]  quote I'm going to pause here she said I'm gonna lose the script I'm going to
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:50.320]  reflect on the recurring feelings I have of impending doom we have so much to
[3:39:50.320 --> 3:39:56.680]  look forward to so much promise and potential of where we are and so much
[3:39:56.680 --> 3:40:04.880]  reason for hope but right now I'm scared that's March right April middle of May
