[00:00.000 --> 00:12.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.520 --> 00:22.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.560 --> 00:28.800]  well former Israeli Navy captain and Mossad officer Victor Astrosky is saying
[00:28.800 --> 00:36.320]  it is a horrible debacle that was carried out in a moronic fashion but I
[00:36.320 --> 00:41.000]  guess he's anti-Israel because you're not allowed to criticize Israel in any
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.080]  way you know we hear the same thing here in our government if you criticize
[00:45.080 --> 00:52.360]  anything Barack Obama does you're anti-america if you criticize anything
[00:52.360 --> 00:56.160]  Obama does you're a racist because he happens to be part African of course it
[00:56.160 --> 01:02.520]  has nothing to do with it this situation that happened with the flotilla
[01:02.520 --> 01:08.040]  being boarded is a fiasco any way you slice it I'm not anti-Israel I don't
[01:08.040 --> 01:14.340]  hate Israel but I don't buy into the way the media beats you over the head if you
[01:14.340 --> 01:18.320]  don't worship everything Israel does and calls you anti-Semitic that tends to
[01:18.320 --> 01:23.120]  make people rebel and then want to criticize Israel but then I also get it
[01:23.120 --> 01:28.520]  from the other side who I found to be very deceptive and to exaggerate and to
[01:28.520 --> 01:34.840]  lie perpetually about Israel and about me claiming I work for Israel and and
[01:34.840 --> 01:41.320]  just I mean it's it's it's huge on the internet it's as phony as a $3 bill but
[01:41.320 --> 01:48.680]  that's just the way it is that's just the way it is and it's a cult the
[01:48.680 --> 01:54.800]  support the unquestioning support of Israel is a cult as a tribal cult and
[01:54.800 --> 01:59.600]  the people that hate Israel I found it's a cult you know humans are similar
[01:59.600 --> 02:04.560]  regardless of what religious creed or you know what ethnic derivation you come
[02:04.560 --> 02:09.440]  from and I quite quite frankly am just sick and tired of all of it ladies and
[02:09.440 --> 02:13.560]  gentlemen I will cover all the developments with the flotilla Israel
[02:13.560 --> 02:21.800]  starting to soften their stance a little bit because their old ally Turkey had
[02:21.800 --> 02:26.800]  three of the six ships that were under Turkish flags that were attacked one of
[02:26.800 --> 02:30.040]  the main ships so you know where the boarding parties were resisted that's
[02:30.040 --> 02:37.160]  now not being debated is the main bone of contention and the Turks are sending
[02:37.160 --> 02:46.680]  frigates and missile cruisers out to escort a Irish ship that has a Nobel
[02:46.680 --> 02:52.200]  laureate on board an Irish flagship and then there are more ships coming so
[02:52.200 --> 02:57.160]  this is a PR disaster for Israel anyway they slice it they are going to lose
[02:57.160 --> 03:02.080]  ground and that'll just cause Israel to circle the wagons even more and get more
[03:02.080 --> 03:06.920]  belligerent which is exactly what the manipulators want and and you notice
[03:06.920 --> 03:10.720]  suddenly we've got crises on the Korean Peninsula and there's crises in the
[03:10.720 --> 03:15.480]  Mediterranean and there's there's crises in Pakistan and Afghanistan and Iraq and
[03:15.480 --> 03:21.040]  the world markets are imploding and Iran has announced their dumping 40 plus
[03:21.040 --> 03:28.360]  billion dollars of US dollars on the market and buying gold bullion so this
[03:28.360 --> 03:32.960]  looks like the start of World War one slash World War two very interesting
[03:32.960 --> 03:38.480]  times ahead of us so all I can say is brace yourselves ladies and gentlemen
[03:38.480 --> 03:43.680]  now we have Dr. Corey Gold who's on one of our big affiliates out in
[03:43.680 --> 03:54.320]  California he actually I guess goes live in the last hour of this show and I was
[03:54.320 --> 04:00.600]  scrabbling around trying to find somebody who's pro-Israel to come and give
[04:00.600 --> 04:06.280]  that perspective because it makes for good radio it causes people to think and
[04:06.280 --> 04:10.640]  you know this is not a place where we just have one view or one paradigm or
[04:10.640 --> 04:14.960]  one idea put out that's why I've had and culture on that's why I've had Michelle
[04:14.960 --> 04:18.920]  Malcolm on back when they were promoting FEMA camps and concentration camps in
[04:18.920 --> 04:24.440]  the end of the Bill of Rights I had them on and disagreed with them I don't
[04:24.440 --> 04:29.880]  completely disagree with this Dr. Corey Gold guy but I do disagree with him on
[04:29.880 --> 04:33.840]  several fronts and so we'll have him on for a thought-provoking discussion
[04:33.840 --> 04:40.080]  coming up in the next hour then Dr. John Coleman I believe he's a doctor more
[04:40.080 --> 04:43.760]  through his bio have an interview in years yes Dr. John Coleman he'll be

[08:32.760 --> 08:41.320]  developments dealing with the flotella that was boarded two days ago by the

[08:50.400 --> 08:56.160]  three guests joining us actually four guests we have Dr. Corey Gold coming on

[09:01.600 --> 09:06.480]  next hour that should be a lively discussion Dr. John Coleman was going
[09:06.480 --> 09:10.040]  to be coming on to talk about the global power structure and the committee of
[09:10.040 --> 09:15.440]  300 a globalist organization that nexus is in to the Bilderberg group
[09:15.440 --> 09:19.320]  trilateral Commission Council on Foreign Relations Paul Joseph Watson will be
[09:19.320 --> 09:23.560]  joining us on the Bilderberg group coming up via video Skype for prison
[09:23.560 --> 09:27.240]  planet TV viewers not just for radio listeners and the first 30 minutes of
[09:27.240 --> 09:31.840]  last hour and then Charlie Skelton London Guardian reporter who's at Bilderberg
[09:31.840 --> 09:38.360]  this year he'll be joining us they just now shut down the hotel today they're
[09:38.360 --> 09:42.160]  getting ready for it to start tomorrow and of course he's there on the ground
[09:42.160 --> 09:45.960]  talking to other reporters who are getting intel on what's happening at
[09:45.960 --> 09:49.760]  this key meeting so he'll be joining us in the last 30 minutes today he'll also
[09:49.760 --> 10:00.440]  be popping in with more information with us on the radio show tomorrow but
[10:00.440 --> 10:11.720]  before I go any further I want to get into the attack that is taking place on
[10:11.720 --> 10:18.400]  free speech in this nation there are literally more than 10 senators I've
[10:18.400 --> 10:22.680]  seen in the news I know you've seen them as well a whole bunch of the White
[10:22.680 --> 10:32.000]  House czars like Cass Sunstein and others the FCC time magazine the New
[10:32.000 --> 10:43.080]  York Times Newsweek I mean you name it they're out there promoting and pushing
[10:43.080 --> 10:53.720]  attacks on free speech in this nation and every day I see three or four
[10:53.720 --> 10:59.800]  sometimes more articles all over the news calmly reporting attacks on free
[10:59.800 --> 11:05.360]  speech like it's a good thing and of course the federal government is
[11:05.360 --> 11:10.440]  proposing licensing to have a blog or to be able to post anything on the web
[11:10.440 --> 11:16.200]  they are calling for state licensing not just federal licensing and taxes they
[11:16.200 --> 11:19.120]  are calling for a quote kindler gentler internet where you're not allowed to have
[11:19.120 --> 11:23.280]  your own domain where everything is converted over to a hundred domains
[11:23.280 --> 11:28.360]  controlled by key corporations government and select universities then you
[11:28.360 --> 11:33.880]  will have a sub domain with them but under their rules this is what's
[11:33.880 --> 11:38.400]  happening and they really are moving to do it and I in Australia is passing laws
[11:38.400 --> 11:44.920]  in their own words Chinese style net censorship so is France Italy England is
[11:44.920 --> 11:51.720]  moving to do it many governments are now providing quote free broadband which
[11:51.720 --> 11:54.760]  the entire internet's converting to but of course you're paying for it with tax
[11:54.760 --> 11:59.040]  money it's not free and under those systems in England we confirmed two
[11:59.040 --> 12:07.760]  years ago that prisonplanet.com and info wars.com are not available I'm gonna
[12:07.760 --> 12:15.880]  repeat that they are not available you cannot get to them many universities
[12:15.880 --> 12:22.640]  many high schools many private corporations by filtering software that
[12:22.640 --> 12:30.680]  lists now hundreds of thousands of websites and keywords info wars.com is
[12:30.680 --> 12:34.800]  banned prisonplanet.com is banned sometimes you can get to our alternative
[12:34.800 --> 12:38.400]  sites that aren't in the list like info wars.net what is the endgame.com
[12:38.400 --> 12:42.880]  prisonplanet.tv people could say well that's a corporation well that's a
[12:42.880 --> 12:46.000]  university well that's the government let them do what they want you know
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.080]  that's their prerogative no you you're paying for the universities you're paying
[12:50.080 --> 12:54.720]  for the government quote free broadband it's not free the government doesn't
[12:54.720 --> 13:00.880]  offer you something free unless they want to control you it's poisoning the
[13:00.880 --> 13:05.560]  well that's a great way to get rid of you know too many wild wolves or coyotes
[13:05.560 --> 13:12.040]  you just find their waterhole and poison it they drink it they die and they're
[13:12.040 --> 13:18.280]  not smart enough to know what's killing their fellow PAC members well or a
[13:18.280 --> 13:24.800]  better analogy is how do you domesticate pigs how do you domesticate deer how do
[13:24.800 --> 13:29.960]  you domesticate horses how did our ancestors domesticate oxen into what
[13:29.960 --> 13:39.840]  they are today an angus cow how did they do this well you simply start putting
[13:39.840 --> 13:45.640]  grain out inside a fenced area with an opening and then one day you just are
[13:45.640 --> 13:51.400]  up in a tree by the fence or hiding the bushes and at first the younger less
[13:51.400 --> 13:55.840]  wily piglets come in and eat the grain and then the mama sal comes in and then
[13:55.840 --> 14:01.800]  the daddy more comes in and then a whole pack of hogs goes into the pen you slip
[14:01.800 --> 14:06.640]  down out of the tree or come out of your blind and close the gate and then you
[14:06.640 --> 14:10.000]  continue to feed them and get them trained to accept you then you capture a
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.640]  few piglets you take them and raise them in a pen or even in in in around your
[14:15.640 --> 14:19.480]  hut in the village and now they're domesticated that's what's happening the
[14:19.480 --> 14:24.360]  domestication of mankind and it's the same incremental domestication in the
[14:24.360 --> 14:27.640]  scientific control system over the internet so I wanted to cover a few
[14:27.640 --> 14:35.240]  articles on that front first this is the Hill newspaper groups one FCC to police
[14:35.240 --> 14:41.640]  hate speech on talk radio cable news networks and of course the FCC concurs
[14:41.640 --> 14:45.600]  it says they have control over the internet and they're calling at the
[14:45.600 --> 14:50.520]  winehouse for government messages to pop up on your website on your blog and
[14:50.520 --> 14:53.840]  they're openly announcing that they want not just equal time on your talk
[14:53.840 --> 14:58.000]  station they want to create a quote this is one of the board members the FCC
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.400]  said last month a government megaphone that was the quote where hours a day to
[15:03.400 --> 15:09.440]  start with of your radio station that you own as shareholders of a radio group
[15:09.440 --> 15:15.040]  or as a private owner or a group of owners that you will put on government
[15:15.040 --> 15:19.320]  programming during primetime slots and the government will break in via the
[15:19.320 --> 15:24.040]  EAS system that you put in in 96 and put messages out I mean this is all being
[15:24.040 --> 15:28.640]  pushed and promoted right now the federal communications commission is
[15:28.640 --> 15:32.520]  being urged to monitor hate speech yes the thought crime the government will
[15:32.520 --> 15:37.520]  monitor on talk radio and cable broadcast networks so not only is it you
[15:37.520 --> 15:42.520]  can't say the s word of the f word no no no now it's you can't say the tyranny
[15:42.520 --> 15:47.000]  word you can't say the New World Order word you can't say the socialist word
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.400]  you can't talk about our Lord and Savior Barack Hussein Obama a coalition of
[15:53.400 --> 15:58.480]  more than 30 organizations argue in a letter to the FCC that the internet has
[15:58.480 --> 16:04.320]  made it harder for the public to separate the facts from bigotry masquerading
[16:04.320 --> 16:09.800]  his news and see you better watch it the control left wants to silence the right
[16:09.800 --> 16:13.560]  the controlled right the controlled right always is talking about silence
[16:13.560 --> 16:17.080]  saying we heard it from out and culture and others as well as Michelle Malkin
[16:17.080 --> 16:21.520]  silencing the left well once you've gouged each other's eyes out and then
[16:21.520 --> 16:27.080]  gagged each other no one can speak no you need to protect free speech ladies
[16:27.080 --> 16:32.480]  and gentlemen period even if you don't agree with it the groups also charge the
[16:32.480 --> 16:36.400]  syndicated radio and cable television masquerading his news use hate as a
[16:36.400 --> 16:45.440]  profit model and of course hate is now anything I mean you know if you say you
[16:45.440 --> 16:50.560]  don't want a war you're called a hateful terrorist or or if you say you
[16:50.560 --> 16:54.200]  don't want government running your health care you're a racist of course
[16:54.200 --> 16:58.440]  they're really the haters injecting race into the issue as traditional media
[16:58.440 --> 17:02.640]  have become less diverse and less competitive they have also grown less
[17:02.640 --> 17:07.120]  responsible and less responsive to the communities that they are supposed to
[17:07.120 --> 17:11.760]  serve the organization wrote the FCC in the same atmosphere hate speech
[17:11.760 --> 17:16.280]  thrives as hate has developed as a profit model for syndicated radio and
[17:16.280 --> 17:23.160]  cable television programs masquerading his news the organization which include
[17:23.160 --> 17:27.480]  free press we got a lot of the Orwellian names it's like a bush calling it the
[17:27.480 --> 17:30.760]  patriot act when it's the opposite of the bill it writes in Constitution the
[17:30.760 --> 17:35.800]  opposite of an American patriot maybe a Hitler type patriot or a Stalin or
[17:35.800 --> 17:40.360]  Mal type patriot of restricting free speech but not an American patriot not a
[17:40.360 --> 17:45.600]  declaration of independence not a George Washington Thomas Jefferson John
[17:45.600 --> 17:53.640]  Quincy Adams type patriot no no no the organizations was include free press oh
[17:53.640 --> 17:58.000]  the the organization's called free press and they want to take your free press
[17:58.000 --> 18:02.040]  the organization was include free press the Center for Media Justice oh they're

[18:21.760 --> 18:26.480]  censorship and here's an article it was in the AP and Fox News Michigan
[18:26.480 --> 18:32.600]  considers law to license journalist yes no free speech unless the government
[18:32.600 --> 18:39.160]  licenses you yes you must get license from them a Michigan lawmaker wants to
[18:39.160 --> 18:43.160]  license reporters to ensure they are credible and vet them for good moral
[18:43.160 --> 18:46.920]  character that's how they started 50 years ago in New York City gun control

[19:38.960 --> 19:42.880]  and plumbers see how it's being pitched like it's reasonable Patterson who also
[19:42.880 --> 19:46.560]  practices constitutional laws is that general public is being overwhelmed with
[19:46.560 --> 19:49.560]  an increasing number of media outlets traditional online and citizens

[24:35.560 --> 24:41.360]  mainstream media I mean every day I see three or four articles without looking

[24:45.280 --> 24:51.200]  article that says yes they're coming after your free speech and then just
[24:51.200 --> 24:54.840]  boil it down with bullet points because you look at a couple of these

[24:58.480 --> 25:03.600]  people in government no they are beating a steady drum and just three or four
[25:03.600 --> 25:07.760]  years ago government would and media would never do this they would never
[25:07.760 --> 25:13.600]  openly call for restricting free speech now they're doing it because old main
[25:13.600 --> 25:19.600]  line establishment especially what you call liberal media is dying is going

[25:40.800 --> 25:45.720]  dying dinosaur media on its back flailing with the corrupt government
[25:45.720 --> 25:49.600]  run by offshore corporations that's looting the United States Western
[25:49.600 --> 25:53.880]  Europe and the rest of the industrialized world and you've got the system
[25:53.880 --> 25:57.600]  losing all credibility is the big news in ski said two weeks ago for the first
[25:57.600 --> 26:01.160]  time ever he said the whole world is awake to the world government and their
[26:01.160 --> 26:06.360]  system is in trouble see they're not arrogant anymore folks there before they
[26:06.360 --> 26:10.080]  said I write your blogs have your talk radio we don't care now they're like

[26:21.240 --> 26:27.720]  down now sir it's too late we can't I mean that's basically the situation we've
[26:27.720 --> 26:31.920]  reached we are blowing the living-day lights out of the new world order and
[26:31.920 --> 26:35.320]  they know it and so they're pulling out all the stops don't criticize the take
[26:35.320 --> 26:42.000]  over of health care don't criticize the banking deck over your racist don't
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.560]  vote for Rand Paul racist they're like emergency hit the rice button it's not
[26:47.560 --> 26:51.920]  working either what are we gonna do they don't the people don't care what we say
[26:51.920 --> 26:55.160]  about them anymore if we demonize them what are we gonna do we're losing mind
[26:55.160 --> 27:03.040]  control over them what are we gonna do I mean look at this Fox News article
[27:03.040 --> 27:11.680]  quoting the bill written by a supposed constitutional law scholar Michigan
[27:11.680 --> 27:19.200]  considers law to license journalist and it goes on according to the bill
[27:19.200 --> 27:23.640]  reporters must provide the licensing board proof of which makes the licensing
[27:23.640 --> 27:29.520]  board God and the minions the staffers like in each Germany to have a play or
[27:29.520 --> 27:33.480]  to make a television program or to write a script or to own a typewriter you'd
[27:33.480 --> 27:39.280]  have special licenses and of course the men who were over the media and the
[27:39.280 --> 27:42.840]  culture got to have all the beautiful women and all the power and everyone
[27:42.840 --> 27:47.440]  worship them oh yes the government boards over the arts and entertainment
[27:47.440 --> 27:53.320]  life Sarkozy in France we're think it's the movie star wife he funds almost all
[27:53.320 --> 27:56.600]  the media over there it's a sickening joke well we're gonna be like that here
[27:56.600 --> 28:02.040]  to paying a license to have a television set oh yes Obama's people are
[28:02.040 --> 28:08.960]  proposing that now listen this is this is quotes from the bill good moral
[28:08.960 --> 28:12.320]  character and demonstrate they have industry ethics standards acceptable of
[28:12.320 --> 28:16.880]  the board that's a quote so the government decides what moral character is
[28:16.880 --> 28:21.960]  handing your guns in worshipping big government lying for the government the
[28:21.960 --> 28:25.480]  government's gonna tell you what moral character is they will decide to go
[28:25.480 --> 28:31.080]  completely arbitrary possession of a degree in journalism or other degree
[28:31.080 --> 28:35.120]  substantially equivalent so you can't even then meet a student paper because
[28:35.120 --> 28:38.640]  you have to have the degree first not less than three years experience as a
[28:38.640 --> 28:43.960]  reporter or any other relevant background information you must have three
[28:43.960 --> 28:48.200]  years experience as a reporter to be able to be a reporter so when all the
[28:48.200 --> 28:53.560]  reporters died they'll never be another reporter again remember when below was
[28:53.560 --> 28:57.440]  putting on the debates for the Republican primary and they weren't gonna
[28:57.440 --> 29:01.800]  let Deborah Medina in even though she had 15% of the vote or more in the polls
[29:01.800 --> 29:05.600]  somewhere as high as 20 and they said well you have to have a statewide
[29:05.600 --> 29:10.000]  position first of senator or governor so you can't run for governor unless you
[29:10.000 --> 29:13.680]  already been a senator or governor and of course people laughed at them and so
[29:13.680 --> 29:18.120]  they had to back off of that but it shows what they're trying not you just
[29:18.120 --> 29:21.320]  heard me read from the bill you gotta have three years experience as a
[29:21.320 --> 29:28.960]  reporter to ever be a reporter that's a that that's interesting logic it's like
[29:28.960 --> 29:34.680]  saying you've got to be a woman who's had children to be born as a woman you
[29:34.680 --> 29:38.960]  have to have awards or recognition related to being a reporter three or
[29:38.960 --> 29:43.720]  more writing samples and you'll have to pay an application registration fee see
[29:43.720 --> 29:48.520]  and they're not the only state proposing this it's going on in Washington
[29:48.520 --> 29:55.960]  state stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and
[29:55.960 --> 30:03.760]  the GCN radio network the question is where should the American people draw
[30:03.760 --> 30:11.640]  their line in the sand a republic is based on a Constitution which protects
[30:11.640 --> 30:16.040]  minority rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on
[30:16.040 --> 30:19.400]  what's for dinner so they think they own our land they think they're on our water
[30:19.400 --> 30:25.280]  children our education our money we have to define who we are and what we will
[30:25.280 --> 30:31.360]  tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising we
[30:31.360 --> 30:35.000]  have the facts we have the Constitution we have the Bill of Rights we have common

[38:06.520 --> 38:12.120]  tomorrow today so we'll get that first report on that today I of course was on
[38:12.120 --> 38:18.040]  Russia today yesterday reporting on the criminal bill deberg group and it's
[38:18.040 --> 38:21.400]  pushed for world government the fact that the european parliament her
[38:21.400 --> 38:26.040]  testimony by daniel estaline yesterday that's how mainstream this is getting to
[38:26.040 --> 38:30.920]  the full you parliament on the fact that every major e you appointing because the
[38:30.920 --> 38:34.000]  way the bureaucracy works is the parliament selected but they have no
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.600]  power like the general assembly of the un they're a debating club under the
[38:38.600 --> 38:44.240]  bureau the bureaucracy of the e you and herman von rumpey and so the the the
[38:44.240 --> 38:49.040]  the the people that should have the power the elected representatives they are
[38:49.040 --> 38:55.000]  now pointing out that the puppet e you system that is above the elected
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.440]  parliament is all bill deberg group show this is the beginning of the defeat of
[39:00.440 --> 39:05.640]  the euro hey if people in germany and france and the netherlands and
[39:05.640 --> 39:10.040]  everywhere else in turkey and Greece for that matter and spain and portugal if
[39:10.040 --> 39:14.440]  they want to have a union good for them but it should be a republic it should be
[39:14.440 --> 39:21.040]  truly democratic a constitutional democracy meaning meaning a republican
[39:21.040 --> 39:24.440]  democracy meaning you can't have fifty one percent voting to take the other
[39:24.440 --> 39:28.440]  forty nine percent's rights but this is worse than that you've got an elective
[39:28.440 --> 39:36.040]  bureaucracy that that never even allowed votes in the e you on entrance and then
[39:36.040 --> 39:40.440]  bureaucrats and treacherous prime ministers and presidents signed them over
[39:40.440 --> 39:47.640]  to it by the way will you guys call Nigel Farage today we keep forgetting and
[39:47.640 --> 39:52.440]  see how he did after his plane wreck you call mr bloom and get him back on and
[39:52.440 --> 39:57.840]  then we'll get a Nigel Nigel Farage on because we keep sitting around the
[39:57.840 --> 40:02.040]  office going I wonder how he did in his election effect let's look that up we
[40:02.040 --> 40:05.240]  never even looked up how he did in his he was member of the european union
[40:05.240 --> 40:08.240]  parliament he's running for the british parliament let's look up Nigel Farage
[40:08.240 --> 40:12.040]  and see how he did after his plane crash I think I've said that about well
[40:12.040 --> 40:15.440]  that matter we're gonna find out right now we're gonna find out right now what
[40:15.440 --> 40:24.040]  happened with that ladies and gentlemen I'm brainstorming here live on the air
[40:24.040 --> 40:30.040]  okay I better hurry into the news before they pass laws and I have to go through
[40:30.040 --> 40:33.640]  a government board and be certified before I have any free speech because
[40:33.640 --> 40:37.840]  after all that's the american way and if you're against banning free speech
[40:37.840 --> 40:42.640]  without a government license you must be a racist what's that have to do with it
[40:42.640 --> 40:47.640]  nothing but it just it's a political hot button they throw in that's why I point
[40:47.640 --> 40:54.640]  out how asinine it is every time we cover a new subject okay I'm just gonna
[40:54.640 --> 41:00.640]  read a smattering of headlines here not making any judgment just so you can roll
[41:00.640 --> 41:04.640]  this around in your mind before I give you my take on things this is out of
[41:04.640 --> 41:10.640]  Reuters turkey calls on Israel to end blockade to restore ties and more ships
[41:10.640 --> 41:15.640]  including a large ship from Ireland carrying a Nobel laureate are approaching
[41:15.640 --> 41:22.640]  the area where the Israelis two and a half days ago boarded the six ships
[41:22.640 --> 41:29.640]  Turkey demanded Israeli government lift its blockade of Gaza as a condition for
[41:29.640 --> 41:34.640]  normalizing relations but added it was time that calm replaced anger after
[41:34.640 --> 41:40.640]  Israel's deadly raid on Turkish backed aid flotilla so you know that was
[41:40.640 --> 41:44.640]  political posturing by Turkey I'm sure saying we're gonna send warships to
[41:44.640 --> 41:50.640]  protect the next ship knowing that it would be popular with the Turkish people
[41:50.640 --> 41:54.640]  and then now the next day saying we're not gonna do that but if Israel goes
[41:54.640 --> 42:00.640]  after other ships it's just gonna it's gonna continue and I don't follow what
[42:00.640 --> 42:05.640]  the UN has to say people keep quoting the UN criminal organization but it is
[42:05.640 --> 42:10.640]  saying that and Israel's of course doesn't follow the UN either either but
[42:10.640 --> 42:13.640]  you can't have your cake and eat it too you know a lot of you don't like Israel
[42:13.640 --> 42:16.640]  and what things it does but then you don't like the UN but then people will
[42:16.640 --> 42:21.640]  quote the UN as saying you know it's illegal what Israel's blockade of Gaza
[42:21.640 --> 42:25.640]  and I tend to agree I mean four years of blocking anything coming into the
[42:25.640 --> 42:31.640]  country and always see the spin will sometimes Israel allows things in it's
[42:31.640 --> 42:38.640]  just a major PR blow up but I'll continue here IDF Jerusalem Post reports
[42:38.640 --> 42:47.640]  Israeli Defense Forces say global jihad links on flotilla and they've already
[42:47.640 --> 42:52.640]  shown us the knives and wooden clubs that are being called basically WMD's
[42:52.640 --> 42:58.640]  like they say in the Atari militia guns or WMD's now weapons of mass destruction
[42:58.640 --> 43:02.640]  but there is a big development I've been analyzing the videos as I saw this
[43:02.640 --> 43:07.640]  morning we go live on prisonplanet.tv towards the end of the next hour
[43:07.640 --> 43:13.640]  I'm gonna play the clip where the Israelis say it shows the people on board
[43:13.640 --> 43:18.640]  the big Turkish flagship throwing flashbangs and it does look like that
[43:18.640 --> 43:24.640]  and you did have the pro-Gaza groups saying that Israel was firing on them
[43:24.640 --> 43:29.640]  first and pointing to the sounds of bangs and then you see the Israeli commandos
[43:29.640 --> 43:33.640]  come down on ropes and they're being beaten with clubs but the Arab media
[43:33.640 --> 43:37.640]  was saying well that's because they were shooting at them first but if indeed
[43:37.640 --> 43:41.640]  and I just go to the facts folks I just report the facts here you've got
[43:41.640 --> 43:45.640]  bangs going off and it's really flashbangs being thrown and we've got
[43:45.640 --> 43:53.640]  this video up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com if indeed they're throwing
[43:53.640 --> 44:02.640]  the flashbangs first then that completely changes the situation doesn't it
[44:02.640 --> 44:06.640]  but also Israel claiming they had guns and all these weapons at first
[44:06.640 --> 44:10.640]  well why weren't any of the IDF shot so I think both sides are spinning this
[44:10.640 --> 44:14.640]  fog of conflict and war here but we'll always find out in hindsight
[44:14.640 --> 44:17.640]  exactly what happened we're continuing to analyze it
[44:17.640 --> 44:26.640]  US consulate issues advisory for Israel for US citizens traveling there
[44:26.640 --> 44:30.640]  yeah I don't know why anybody travels to Israel it's very very dangerous
[44:30.640 --> 44:33.640]  I mean it's like people say travel to Mexico it's even more dangerous
[44:33.640 --> 44:38.640]  I mean there's no way I'd send college aged kids there like so many parents
[44:38.640 --> 44:47.640]  do to Mexico especially we got an email here from Brigitte and it basically
[44:47.640 --> 44:56.640]  reports the same thing that Jerusalem Post is reporting and it well I'm going
[44:56.640 --> 45:01.640]  to get to that in a moment but Turkish lawmakers urge government to review
[45:01.640 --> 45:08.640]  Israeli ties you've got to love how they're sending out this pro-Israel email
[45:08.640 --> 45:14.640]  they say keep this to yourself no one is supposed to get this this is what IDF
[45:14.640 --> 45:18.640]  soldiers are telling me what happened and then it's sent out as a mass email
[45:18.640 --> 45:23.640]  so everybody does spread it don't give this to anybody you know that's kind of
[45:23.640 --> 45:27.640]  like Trent Reznor put out a fake police state video two weeks ago and you know
[45:27.640 --> 45:31.640]  at the start of the video it says don't give this to anyone so it so it goes viral
[45:31.640 --> 45:35.640]  I mean we don't use tricks like that here on the show to get the word out folks
[45:35.640 --> 45:39.640]  we just say this is important info we hope you get it out to everyone
[45:39.640 --> 45:44.640]  but nevertheless Israel has put up on YouTube video of what shows the Arabs
[45:44.640 --> 45:49.640]  what looks like throwing flash banks or the pro-Gaza group
[45:49.640 --> 45:54.640]  the problem is the CIA admitted to the Washington Post last week they have
[45:54.640 --> 45:59.640]  produced fake bin Laden videos of course we already knew that so how do we believe
[45:59.640 --> 46:05.640]  anything though the video does look real and watching the old bin Laden videos
[46:05.640 --> 46:10.640]  you could tell they were fake it's it's it's pretty hard to fake these action
[46:10.640 --> 46:14.640]  videos or it ends up looking like you know some type of a video game this
[46:14.640 --> 46:19.640]  looks pretty real but again time will tell Turkish lawmakers urge government
[46:19.640 --> 46:24.640]  to review Israeli ties Turkey's parliament called on the government
[46:24.640 --> 46:29.640]  Wednesday to review all ties with Israel as the country prepared a huge welcome
[46:29.640 --> 46:34.640]  home for hundreds of Turks detained after Israel's bloody raid on the Gaza bound
[46:34.640 --> 46:38.640]  aid flotilla that's the Associated Press here's the Jerusalem Post if you want
[46:38.640 --> 46:43.640]  to go watch the video the headline is activist through stun grenades this is
[46:43.640 --> 46:50.640]  also up on info wars dot com and present planet dot com right now
[46:50.640 --> 46:55.640]  the idea of spokespersons office on Wednesday afternoon release more new
[46:55.640 --> 47:00.640]  footage of Gaza flotilla activists attacking soldiers with a stun grenade
[47:00.640 --> 47:06.640]  a box of plates and water hoses now Fox News was trying to say yesterday that
[47:06.640 --> 47:11.640]  maybe it was fake video from Al Jazeera well Al Jazeera's video backs up the
[47:11.640 --> 47:16.640]  Israeli account I mean how do you think Al Jazeera fakes video live on the
[47:16.640 --> 47:19.640]  deck of the ship when the Israeli commandos are coming down with their
[47:19.640 --> 47:25.640]  guns slung and being beaten that's not fake video why would Al Jazeera put
[47:25.640 --> 47:30.640]  out video that backs up the Israeli account
[47:30.640 --> 47:36.640]  Fox News is really just just really engages in moreronic propaganda
[47:36.640 --> 47:43.640]  just like the pro Gaza group you know saying that they didn't beat anybody
[47:43.640 --> 47:48.640]  for the first day backfired on them I mean yeah they were attacking people but
[47:48.640 --> 47:52.640]  the issue is this was international waters and a lot of former Israeli
[47:52.640 --> 47:56.640]  Mossad folks in fact I'm gonna go over some of that in a minute they're
[47:56.640 --> 48:00.640]  saying that this was illegal and the way I rated it was illegal
[48:00.640 --> 48:07.640]  why didn't they do it once it got in Israeli waters it's a brazenness it's
[48:07.640 --> 48:12.640]  an arrogance that we can do whatever we want because you know we've been
[48:12.640 --> 48:16.640]  attacked before and we're a little country and you know we don't care what
[48:16.640 --> 48:21.640]  the world thinks well whatever it's a PR disaster anyway you slice it but I
[48:21.640 --> 48:24.640]  guess you're supposed to you know be part of the pro-Israel cult or no one
[48:24.640 --> 48:29.640]  can criticize anything and just just do whatever Benjamin Netanyahu says
[48:29.640 --> 48:34.640]  the IDF spokespersons office on Wednesday afternoon released more new
[48:34.640 --> 48:38.640]  footage of Gaza flotilla activists attacking soldiers with a stun grenade
[48:38.640 --> 48:43.640]  a box of plates and water hoses now again I'm gonna say this I get attacked
[48:43.640 --> 48:47.640]  by the white supremacist and the Israel haters and it's a wide spectrum of
[48:47.640 --> 48:51.640]  people who are in that camp for not attacking Israel enough then I got
[48:51.640 --> 48:56.640]  attacked by the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center for not worshiping Israel
[48:56.640 --> 49:00.640]  and I'm just sick of it I'm I'm sick of hearing about Israel all the time I'm
[49:00.640 --> 49:06.640]  sick of having to launch all these wars because the American Christians believe
[49:06.640 --> 49:12.640]  that that they're gonna bring about the end of the world in the return of
[49:12.640 --> 49:18.640]  Jesus by by causing World War 3 in the Middle East look I don't want World War
[49:18.640 --> 49:23.640]  3 okay I don't want war with North Korea I don't want war with Pakistan I don't
[49:23.640 --> 49:27.640]  want to be in Iraq I'm sick of it okay I know it's about weapons sales and
[49:27.640 --> 49:32.640]  oil and power and securing Israel's flank I'm tired of it I'm tired of the
[49:32.640 --> 49:36.640]  arrogant statements by Israeli prime ministers in the media and it's in the
[49:36.640 --> 49:40.640]  Jerusalem post so don't deny it you know I'm saying you know America's in our
[49:40.640 --> 49:44.640]  hip pocket I mean I'm tired of it I mean that's why Israel gets so much
[49:44.640 --> 49:50.640]  criticism and I don't think that you know Israel controls the United States I
[49:50.640 --> 49:53.640]  think it's one of the big lobbies who have the same interest as the weapons
[49:53.640 --> 49:58.640]  manufacturers and the oil companies and you know mainline Christian conservatives
[49:58.640 --> 50:03.640]  that just love war I mean let me tell you something it's disgusting to watch good
[50:03.640 --> 50:07.640]  old boys piling into liquor stores every time this country starts a new war I've
[50:07.640 --> 50:11.640]  talked to liquor store owners I know and also I know a fellow that owns a pizza
[50:11.640 --> 50:17.640]  shop and I say when do you sell the most food when you sell the most liquor and
[50:17.640 --> 50:22.640]  they say you know when when the new war starts people just get drunk for weeks
[50:22.640 --> 50:25.640]  and they and these good old boys with John Wayne pictures hanging up in their
[50:25.640 --> 50:30.640]  house I don't dislike John Wayne folks I just don't like the cult of war and
[50:30.640 --> 50:35.640]  they just buy liquor and beer and food and they just get drunk and feel manly
[50:35.640 --> 50:41.640]  and cry watching buildings blowing up and feel a manly extension through it I'm
[50:41.640 --> 50:53.640]  tired of it I'm tired of it I'm sick of and I want my sovereignty okay I want to
[50:53.640 --> 50:57.640]  follow the George Washington said I want to be our own country I want to leave
[50:57.640 --> 51:07.640]  everybody alone this is not a drill repeat this is not a drill gun cells are

[54:07.640 --> 54:13.640]  Victor Ostrovsky who was an Israeli captain and weapons expert
[54:13.640 --> 54:17.640]  he headed up Israeli weapons development for the Navy
[54:17.640 --> 54:23.640]  then he was recruited by the Mossad and he wrote a book critical
[54:23.640 --> 54:27.640]  of Israel of the Mossad by way of deception
[54:27.640 --> 54:31.640]  but he's pro-Israel overall but you're not allowed to do that see
[54:31.640 --> 54:35.640]  you can't even be an Israeli Jew and be a former captain
[54:35.640 --> 54:39.640]  and then a Mossad officer and then criticize what he called corruption
[54:39.640 --> 54:43.640]  and lying well of course intelligence agencies are corrupt and lie
[54:43.640 --> 54:47.640]  that's what's insane I mean the CIA is on record
[54:47.640 --> 54:51.640]  shipping narcotics out of Vietnam and Afghanistan they're currently shipping narcotics
[54:51.640 --> 54:55.640]  out of Afghanistan and are so arrogant they come out and admit it and then if I say
[54:55.640 --> 54:59.640]  I'm against the CIA shipping drugs in here I'm unpaid freeotic no they're
[54:59.640 --> 55:03.640]  unpaid freeotic that's the same thing to claim that Israel's
[55:03.640 --> 55:07.640]  all lily white is delusional and that's why people who just blindly
[55:07.640 --> 55:11.640]  defend everything Israel does actually discredit Israel more than just
[55:11.640 --> 55:15.640]  being honest about the fact that anytime you
[55:15.640 --> 55:19.640]  give a government total carte blanche to whatever it wants it's going to get corrupt
[55:19.640 --> 55:23.640]  just like our country the national security act
[55:23.640 --> 55:27.640]  since 1947 they can do whatever they want in total darkness
[55:27.640 --> 55:31.640]  unlimited funding of course we have a criminal government
[55:31.640 --> 55:35.640]  of course the government's taking people's pension funds now and gearing up to
[55:35.640 --> 55:39.640]  take them all no one is safe all these groups use your
[55:39.640 --> 55:43.640]  phony patriotism so you shut off your thinking process not me
[55:43.640 --> 55:47.640]  Victor Ostrowski in the washington post in this week
[55:47.640 --> 55:51.640]  spy talk in the washington post last week spy talk
[55:51.640 --> 55:55.640]  written by former spy Jeff stein they had the CIA
[55:55.640 --> 55:59.640]  by name admitting fake bin Laden videos well this week former
[55:59.640 --> 56:03.640]  agent ridicules gaja ship raid calls
[56:03.640 --> 56:07.640]  the flotilla raid so stupid it's stupefying and he said exactly
[56:07.640 --> 56:11.640]  what I said yesterday only because I read a lot about naval warfare
[56:11.640 --> 56:15.640]  this is interesting you send up an open
[56:15.640 --> 56:19.640]  water wet sub and they can go 30 miles an hour
[56:19.640 --> 56:23.640]  they got a little pod that pops off and you just simply blow
[56:23.640 --> 56:27.640]  or cut the propellers
[56:27.640 --> 56:31.640]  they even got special metal ropes nets they can
[56:31.640 --> 56:35.640]  just throw into them no didn't do that well boarded
[56:35.640 --> 56:39.640]  the vessels
[56:39.640 --> 56:43.640]  international waters didn't and he says why didn't they wait until they got to israel
[56:43.640 --> 56:47.640]  and he said it's because Benjamin Netanyahu doesn't know what he's doing
[56:47.640 --> 56:51.640]  but we're not gonna listen to Victor Ostrowski who by the way we've had on the show
[56:51.640 --> 56:55.640]  before I'm gonna get him back on he's on about five years ago I don't know
[56:55.640 --> 56:59.640]  he won't be listened to Benjamin Netanyahu he has to be listened to on everything
[56:59.640 --> 57:03.640]  because he knows everything former massage agent again ridicules gaja
[57:03.640 --> 57:07.640]  ship raid you can read that I will cover more of that coming up later
[57:07.640 --> 57:11.640]  but either way you slice it this
[57:11.640 --> 57:15.640]  causes more of a global crisis and it's got all the arab states up on a big
[57:15.640 --> 57:19.640]  uproar and you got a million and a half people in gaza
[57:19.640 --> 57:23.640]  and it's just they're living an absolute complete squalor and it's only getting
[57:23.640 --> 57:27.640]  worse Israel rejects call for independent probe
[57:27.640 --> 57:31.640]  calls for into Israeli gaza blockade
[57:31.640 --> 57:35.640]  by the british government and others are met with
[57:35.640 --> 57:39.640]  refusals I ran to dump 45 billion euros
[57:39.640 --> 57:43.640]  from gold bullion and dollars so they're gonna buy gold bullion from dumping dollars
[57:43.640 --> 57:47.640]  that's prisonplanet.com reported by press tv very important that's directly from
[57:47.640 --> 57:51.640]  the iranian government that press tv report that we are linked to
[57:51.640 --> 57:55.640]  and also

[58:19.640 --> 58:23.640]  meanwhile the scientific american asked the proper question where are the microbes
[58:23.640 --> 58:27.640]  they should have been dumping microbes into that oil that eats oil
[58:27.640 --> 58:31.640]  immediately but other scientists point out hey those microbes are already naturally in the ocean
[58:31.640 --> 58:35.640]  in six months almost all this oil will be gone
[58:35.640 --> 58:39.640]  crude oil is not very toxic compared to the chemicals they're using to disperse it

[58:55.640 --> 58:59.640]  storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid
[58:59.640 --> 59:03.640]  seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed
[59:03.640 --> 59:07.640]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[59:07.640 --> 59:11.640]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[59:11.640 --> 59:15.640]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank

[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.640]  Alex Jones
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.640]  okay ladies and gentlemen we've got reporters from
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:42.640]  Bilderberg group joining us coming up
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.640]  in the last hour today London Guardian reporter Mr. Skelton
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.640]  we've also got Tucker and others joining us on the show
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.640]  on the transmission tomorrow from Bilderberg in Spain
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:58.640]  getting key intel on the year ahead as the world government body
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.640]  sets the agenda but I tell you what a hot button issue
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.640]  I mean we have gotten
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:10.640]  hundreds of calls off air hundreds and hundreds of emails on both sides
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.640]  saying you aren't excoriating Israel enough
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:18.640]  and it's about 50-50 and you're not
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.640]  defending Israel enough
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.640]  and very few in the middle saying I think you're just giving balance reporting
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:30.640]  and we have Mike Rivera on, I think he's a really smart guy
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:34.640]  and I agree with him on probably 95% of what he covers
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.640]  I didn't agree with him when he started to link Israel
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.640]  on the smoke screen with
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.640]  the whole North Korea situation but
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.640]  that was quite an interview yesterday and we appreciate Mike coming on the show
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.640]  and then I was talking because I've been discussing with one of the station owners
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.640]  he has me on two stations out there, MZ does
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.640]  out in Santa Cruz going into San Francisco going out there next year
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:06.640]  I don't go to a lot of stations to give speeches but he's been asking me a lot and he's done a lot
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.640]  of speaking things so I've talked about going out there so I was
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.640]  nailing that down for maybe September or October and he said my gosh
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.640]  we got hundreds of phone calls both pro and con and he goes that's what I like
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:22.640]  he said it's really stirred things up here on the radio station
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.640]  and I said yeah we're trying to get somebody on
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.640]  with the pro Israel view because I like to show both sides
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:34.640]  plus it's good talk radio and I said do you know anybody
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.640]  gold and I said well wait a minute didn't I fill in one day
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.640]  as a guest host with you when he was out of town a few weeks ago he goes yeah that's the show
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.640]  and I said oh I've heard clips of that before on the web that's a pretty well-spoken fellow
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.640]  let's have him on and so he is here on the broadcast
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.640]  and you know I've learned with Israel and we're going to come back from break
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.640]  some stations don't carry this segment and go straight to him
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.640]  I've learned with the Israel situation there is no black or white
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:06.640]  there is no
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.640]  lukewarm there is no it's what side you choose
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.640]  and those that hate Israel they to them that's you know they're on the
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.640]  white side and those that love Israel they're on the white side wearing the white hats
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.640]  and that's just the way it is and you're not going to convince anybody
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.640]  I have noticed the people that hate Israel
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.640]  it's a religion just like supporting Israel is
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:34.640]  religious almost well it's based on a religion I guess at its core
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.640]  so it is religious and the people that hate Israel
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.640]  will make up all sorts of stuff because it's because I have
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.640]  viciously attacked Israel and have been neutral on it over the years kind of like Switzerland
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:50.640]  I have had every lie under the sun made up about me so it makes you automatically disrespect
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.640]  the people that constantly attack Israel because I found
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.640]  that by and large they are a bunch of manufacturers and liars
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.640]  I mean I've never experienced the death threats the lies
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.640]  the distortions the about me I mean they just make
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.640]  up endless things and we're owned by ABC totally untrue no connection
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.640]  to ABC I guess five years ago we leased a satellite as anybody doesn't talk radio
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:18.640]  you know with one feet of thousands if you start a show about pets you've got to go
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:22.640]  at least one of three satellites but they're out of it now and they made
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:26.640]  lies about they claim I'm owned by Saudi Arabian companies or just
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.640]  lies is the name of the game but separately
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.640]  I found pro-Israel grips will lie and distort I've had the ADL
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.640]  distort and lie about us and say I'm a liar and there's no such
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.640]  thing as a world government and so
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.640]  I'm really sick of it and you know what I think Israel
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:50.640]  was out of line doing this in international waters I think Israel
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.640]  gave themselves a black eye but that doesn't mean I hate Israel
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.640]  and so I get both sides attacking me we'll talk to Dr. Corey Gold
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:02.640]  on the other side
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.640]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator

[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:46.640]  joining us both together in the last hour today
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:50.640]  but for the next 52 minutes we're joined by Dr. Corey Gold
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.640]  and he is a dentist or not apreneur who started
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.640]  and sold many businesses and who currently owns a growing online based training business
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:02.640]  for medical doctors and dentists for their consulting and education
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.640]  licensing requirements he's also a popular prime time talk show host on
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.640]  this co news talk a.m. 1080
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.640]  in the Monterey Salinas Santa Cruz which is also an affiliate of
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.640]  the alex jones radio show and we're actually on two stations there
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.640]  in the area they have us on live up against limbaugh on the smaller station and they
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.640]  re-air me at night on the big mega station that goes into
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:30.640]  San Francisco and other big cities and it's the top station there in town
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:34.640]  on talk radio it's got limbaugh and george gory and all those folks and we're very appreciative
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.640]  of that affiliate and I was looking around yesterday
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.640]  for somebody to come on to give a pro-israel view
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.640]  and Dr. Corey Gold certainly has
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.640]  that perspective because one thing I don't want to do here is just
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.640]  be on one side or the other
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.640]  especially on issues where it's an ancient feud
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:02.640]  and both sides I believe have perspective and points
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:06.640]  and there's propaganda on both sides but we'll get his take on the boarding
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.640]  of the flotilla two days ago so Dr. Gold good to have you
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:14.640]  on with us. Good to be with you alex. So much going on well you've got the
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.640]  floor I heard it was hot discussion yesterday when I went off the air
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:22.640]  on your show so give us your rundown on what you think
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.640]  really going on. Well alex should make my job easy because you are on
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.640]  one of our sister stations right before I go on the air opposite rush limbaugh
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.640]  community we run both stations and by the way I'm one of your
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.640]  listen to every day love your show and we probably share I don't know 90%
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:42.640]  the same philosophy and that's what makes listening to your show every morning great
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.640]  I'm listening yesterday and I hear Mike Rivera on and I'm going
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:50.640]  am I really hearing this on the show because you know before
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:54.640]  the ink is dried on this incident before people even know what facts are in play
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:58.640]  judgments are already being passed and we hear this every day
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:02.640]  on other issues like what happened with the plane going to the IRS building what happened
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.640]  with militias what's going on with tea parties where people are making judgment calls on things
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.640]  before people know facts and I hear a guy doing that
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:14.640]  yesterday and well maybe you should get Mike on because he's a pretty nice fellow
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.640]  maybe you should get him on your show and be happy to
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.640]  and then you can go on his program but one of the things I want to say about this thing is
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.640]  what's happening in the Middle East is not a cartoon it's not like this black and white
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.640]  right group there's one wrong group it's this very simple non-complex
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:34.640]  situation there's it is so multi-layered and
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.640]  so complex that even the people who study it have trouble keeping up with the players
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:42.640]  let me be clear from what I was saying earlier when I said it's not black and white
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:46.640]  in reality but it is black and white to the factions everybody
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:50.640]  thinks basically they're 100% correct what's interesting is within
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.640]  Israel itself there's a large movement of people
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.640]  who actually disagree with the government and would like to do almost anything they could do
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:02.640]  to create peace and those people have been in government for a long period of time
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.640]  and have actually tried quite hard to create peace with the Palestinians
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:10.640]  and create a Palestinian home land it's really difficult when you have a bunch of players like
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:14.640]  Hamas, Hezbollah and others like Syria and agitators like
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:18.640]  Iran it's complex to who do you create peace with and how do you create peace at all
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.640]  and the whole concept of negotiating with somebody
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.640]  says where our charter says we want to destroy you and let's
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.640]  try to create a peace treaty with him is a complex situation I will agree with
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:34.640]  you that was a PR disaster what happened a couple days ago out
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.640]  off the coast of Israel and the coast of Gaza but I think it was a PR
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.640]  disaster that was totally set up and they walked into it I think when Turkey
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.640]  when those boats left Turkey and they had the cameras on by Al Jazeera
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.640]  and they had it was it was a pre-announced here we come stop
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:54.640]  if you can we're gonna break your your blockade and
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.640]  the Israelis were provoked to block the blockade and the whole thing was
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.640]  filmed we saw some from Al Jazeera we're just starting to see some from IDF
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.640]  footage and what we're seeing is is that there was scuffles
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:10.640]  on the boats and it was not a black and white situation of what to happen I can tell
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.640]  you the PR disaster and Israel will take a big hit because
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.640]  of how the world will perceive what happened but it's not simple to what's happening
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:22.640]  in Gaza one thing I'll tell you is the people who are living in Gaza are
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:26.640]  human pawns they're being used by Hamas and Hezboah
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:30.640]  and many other people as fodder to keep
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:34.640]  this going sure why doesn't Egypt who's got a giant population
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:38.640]  just let the million and a half Gazans come in there and by the way
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:42.640]  there's been discussions about letting Jordan take over the West Bank
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.640]  you know but that's not something they even want to have there's been discussions about Egypt taking
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:50.640]  over Gaza and letting themselves rule themselves but it's not something they want and that's because the Palestinians
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:54.640]  have a history of trying to overthrow governments they're in you're right
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.640]  so this is a complex situation going on where no one wants to accept
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:02.640]  anybody else's solution and I don't know if it'll ever get solved but it's not
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.640]  a black and white situation going on there and Israel has
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.640]  taken stances right now just like in other places where you swing too far
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.640]  left you know Israel was very far left before and was ready to give almost everything
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.640]  away it was turned down so the reaction by the Israeli people was
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:22.640]  hey if we want to give you everything and you turn it down we're going to try the other stance which is Netanyahu
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.640]  which is a very stiff boot my guess is he'll be out soon
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:30.640]  and another left wing government will come in it's one of these things where
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.640]  when you offer somebody what they're asking they don't take it where do you go from there
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:38.640]  so it's a complex situation what's happening out in Gaza is tragic
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.640]  what's happening to those people there is absolutely tragic
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.640]  and part of it is Israel part of it is the leadership in
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.640]  Hamas and Hezbollah part of it is the rest of the world just letting it go on
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.640]  and you know Israel is taking a stance that they say the following
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:58.640]  we are not letting ships come in because we are afraid that those ships
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.640]  will contain weapons we want to board and we want to check ships before they come in
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:06.640]  and that is how we're going to play this game the other ships coming there know exactly this
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.640]  and when they decide they want to break it they're intentionally doing it
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:14.640]  knowing that the Israelis will interact with them and they come with
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:18.640]  cameras on board but what I mean I mean correct me if I'm wrong but I've done the research
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.640]  doesn't Israel turn back almost all the boats even if they try to stop
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.640]  for inspection they went through some others they'll port in Israel
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.640]  and then they'll take the materials into Gaza once they've had a chance to inspect them
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.640]  but then the corrupt authorities keep it for themselves
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:38.640]  corrupt authorities where in Gaza you're right
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:42.640]  we send aid to Pakistan and we expect the aid to get to the right people
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.640]  we know that I believe that most of it goes to the wrong people
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.640]  when we send money into Afghanistan to work with some of the people there it's supposed to go to the people
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.640]  who need the food and stuff and yet the reaction
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:58.640]  is by me it's like it's all going to go to the wrong people you're right
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:02.640]  when it goes into Gaza the people who are in charge of Gaza do what they want with it
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.640]  and it's one of those situations where those people are human fodder
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:10.640]  they are being used to create world sympathy because there aren't a tragic situation
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.640]  yet the people who run their organization don't really
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.640]  have incentive to close it because they...
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.640]  well I'll say this it is a fact that especially Saddam Hussein and others and I was against that war by the way
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.640]  but they admitted that they all use
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.640]  basically the Palestinian thing as a political distraction
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:34.640]  kind of like gay marriage and I'm not saying
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.640]  gay marriage folks I'm saying it's used as a political football
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:42.640]  to distract from larger issues that go on and it's basically the same thing
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.640]  all the Arab states love to point at Israel
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.640]  and make statements because it becomes a convenient political distraction
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:54.640]  regardless of where you stand in Israel you know the Arab states
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:58.640]  are extremely, extremely corrupt
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.640]  and I never really hear these aid groups talking about all the oppression going on
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:06.640]  in Saudi Arabia or the oppression of
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:10.640]  Christians and other groups going on in Egypt or what's
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:14.640]  happening it's the cause celeb is
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.640]  bashing Israel now Israel in my opinion does do a lot of
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.640]  manipulative bad things but that's what governments do I'm not saying that's okay either
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.640]  it's the nature of governments it just seems like it's just
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:30.640]  never going away a quagmire of quagmires
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:34.640]  you know I agree with you on that you know one of the things that I get
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.640]  on my show a lot particularly about you and I'm going to ask you a question straight out
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:42.640]  and let you answer it without interruption is people get this
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.640]  belief system that your use of the word
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.640]  Zionism at times has a different meaning than most people have for Zionism
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:54.640]  and the reason I'm asking this question is not to make you look bad or to put you in a funny position
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.640]  I think if you actually told people what you thought Zionism was because
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:02.640]  sometimes you say Zionist people do this or Zionist people do that
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.640]  how do you view that word what does it mean to you well see that's another problem
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.640]  all this is so complex well there's three or four even more
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:14.640]  different variants of Zionist there's Christian Zionist
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.640]  there's left wing Jewish Zionist there's right wing Jewish Zionist
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:22.640]  there's globalist Zionist who say they're Zionist but then
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.640]  basically support the whole world government I mean I know
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:30.640]  I mean that's an endless discussion right there well the reason I say that is because
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.640]  the vast majority of people who listen to your show and a lot of them are Jewish
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.640]  and are big supporters of what you say because most of it's dead on
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.640]  when they think of Zionism they think of somebody who just believes in the right for Israel to exist
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:46.640]  and that's where it begins and ends to them you can be a conservative Zionist
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:50.640]  you can be a liberal Zionist you can be a rich Zionist the poor Zionist
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.640]  the black Zionist the white Zionist it's not really any of the above it's simply the belief system
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:58.640]  in the right of Israel to exist so when that term gets used in other things
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.640]  they're saying wait a second so people believe in the right of Israel to exist
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.640]  are doing these things and that's where sometimes people get a little bit agitated at you
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:10.640]  because they see that word differently than maybe you're using it
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:14.640]  well this is how I really see it like any political group
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:18.640]  they basically have their supporters who mean well
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:22.640]  and then you've got the inner group and again there's multiple groups within Zionism
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.640]  in the party search who are manipulating and controlling
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.640]  through the tribal warlike culture which everybody has built
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:34.640]  into them they're controlling those groups and then they have a separate
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.640]  agenda from what they're actually telling
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:42.640]  their followers and supporters so when I'm talking about
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:46.640]  again that's the problem I mean how do you even define
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.640]  what a well you know what let's
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.640]  go back because there's the break and I'll try to elaborate on it I didn't know I was going to be asked that question

[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.640]  talking to him and having him clarify exactly what the question is
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.640]  when I have guest on
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:34.640]  that are criticizing quote Zionist the general public
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:38.640]  that's scared of what Israel's doing with its nuclear weapons and the rest of it
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:42.640]  and particularly the Likudniks the pro-war crowd
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:46.640]  they think of a modern Zionist
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:50.640]  as someone lobbying the US government to attack
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.640]  more Middle Eastern countries that could cause World War 3
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:58.640]  and they think of Israel as basically how they think
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.640]  of the CIA you know people running Israel
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:06.640]  I'm against what the CIA does that is the leadership of it growing opium
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.640]  but when I have Ray McGovernon who was a chief analyst
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:14.640]  for the CIA he's a good guy or when I have somebody else on so
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:18.640]  again all these big organizations or groups are very diverse
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.640]  and I know that all the different factions like to oversimplify it
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:26.640]  and you know even if you dress up in a Nazi
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:30.640]  outfit and wear a Hitler mustache and you know say kill all Jews
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:34.640]  the anti-submitit groups will hate you because they all hate each other more than any other
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:38.640]  group so I certainly don't ever want to be associated with them
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:42.640]  and I don't want to be associated with the worship you know pro-war
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.640]  Christian Zionist who literally want to cause World War 3 and make
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:50.640]  Jesus come back I mean I've seen it I'm a Christian these people are
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.640]  dangerous and I don't know if Zionist Jews
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:58.640]  that is Jews that believe Israel has a right to exist
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:02.640]  and I don't think they're bad people no certainly not I don't think they realize
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.640]  just how and I'm not scapegoating Christian Zionist that's a diverse
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:10.640]  spectrum of people as well you know they'll call in and say look I'm a Christian who
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:14.640]  thinks Israel has a right to exist well fine but are you the group saying we've got to get
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:18.640]  Jews back to Israel so Jesus will come back so World War 3 can happen
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.640]  Mr. Gold, Dr. Gold I mean are you aware of that group of Zionist?
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:26.640]  They call my shows well no Christian Zionist that's a whole other
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:30.640]  thing but when a Jewish person hears the word Zionist they simply think of historically
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.640]  over the last 140 years since Theodore Herzl about the concept of having a place
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:38.640]  like Israel where Jews could go it was before World War 1 it was before
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:42.640]  the Holocaust and World War 2 it was simply an outgrowth of that
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.640]  Jewish system of returning to the homeland of the Jews and so when people hear that word
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.640]  who are Jewish when they think of the word Zionist like my
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:54.640]  I know friends of mine who are the most progressive liberal people on the planet who we can't agree
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:58.640]  on anything but they call themselves Zionist and I myself would be pretty much a conservative
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:02.640]  or an open independent individual and I'm a Zionist because I believe in Israel's
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:06.640]  right to exist I believe in Mexico's right to exist I believe in Canada's right to exist
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:10.640]  so that's how they kind of see that that definition of what a Zionist is
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:14.640]  they don't attribute everything else to it and Jewish people
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:18.640]  obviously don't ascribe to the belief system that we should have World War 3 to bring back
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:22.640]  the you know Jesus rebirth and have all the Jews die in Israel that would not be something
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:26.640]  at anybody who the Jewish person would consider to be a good idea so I don't see that as
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.640]  But you are familiar with that stranger
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:33.640]  I have people call my show on a regular basis going over that
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:37.640]  that they believe that the reason they support Israel is so that Israel can ultimately be destroyed
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.640]  so that the Messiah can come obviously my my opinion is the Messiah
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:45.640]  wants to come he doesn't need me to kill a bunch of people to have him come he can come
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:49.640]  on his own he's got his own you know abilities to do those things he doesn't need me to pick up a gun
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:53.640]  and shoot somebody to have him come so that wouldn't be something I ascribe to on my
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:57.640]  show and I have days where I simply say why do you hate Jews day
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:01.640]  and you have amazing phone callers who call in and tell you bizarre
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.640]  almost psychotic reasons why you don't want to
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:09.640]  You want to do that here? Oh I don't want to do that here I mean you can I don't care
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:13.640]  but the reality is is when you hear those people speak you realize how stupid it is
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:17.640]  Well here's what I'm saying I feel like it's a diversion
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:21.640]  and a distraction and I want people to live in peace over there and certainly
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:25.640]  you know Jewish people have a right to a homeland it is a tiny country there are some problems
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:29.640]  with how Israel came to be and you know the forcing out of the Muslims and the Palestinians
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:32.640]  so I mean there's a big issue there
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:35.640]  The question is who forced them out and first and another thing you can go back
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:39.640]  look at the map from 100 years ago and try to find the same countries on it today
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:41.640]  the map keeps on changing around the globe
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:45.640]  No no I understand that I understand the United States was carved out of taking land from Spain
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.640]  and from France and from the Native Americans look I'm not
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:52.640]  I mean I understand history's history I mean I'm a fan of Andrew Jackson
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:56.640]  and people say well that guy you know took a bunch of Indian land
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:02.640]  and overall though you know I mean the natives were all fighting with each other
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:05.640]  and different factions and begging because I've actually studied the history
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:09.640]  you know to get settlers to help them go displace their enemy
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:13.640]  so I understand it's not cut and dry I've actually studied history
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:17.640]  my frustration is I'm sick of talking about Israel
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.640]  I want to defend my republic I want lower taxes
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:23.640]  I want to be able to raise my children I want to free press
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:28.640]  and I'm just tired of how it's a political football on all different sides
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.640]  and I'm just sick of hearing about Israel
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.640]  but let's come back and get your take on that
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:36.640]  and you know what you broach the idea
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:39.640]  and so we'll do it as long as people can be civil
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:42.640]  why they love Israel or why you hate Israel
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:44.640]  okay?
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:48.640]  1-800-259-9231
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.640]  we'll be back
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.640]  we're on the march the empire's on the run
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:30:20.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:39.640]  others don't
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:41.640]  we turned jeans inside out

[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:29.640]  we'll be back
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:02.640]  hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:06.640]  if you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.640]  how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.640]  my answer would be all I can get
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:13.640]  in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.640]  food is your only ammunition
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:16.640]  how much do you want?
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:17.640]  when do you want it?
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:19.640]  now or after the battle starts
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:20.640]  when will you need it?
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:22.640]  can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:24.640]  will there be any food?
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:27.640]  will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:28.640]  and you can't feed yourself?
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:31.640]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:34.640]  you wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:38.640]  food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:39.640]  how much will you need?
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:40.640]  we don't know
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:41.640]  how much do you want?
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:42.640]  all you can get
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:43.640]  I'm Alex Jones
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:46.640]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:51.640]  call 1-800-409-5633
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:54.640]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:33:00.640]  again that number 1-800-409-5633
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:13.640]  you know I run into this all the time
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:17.640]  I criticize open borders because we have a welfare system
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:19.640]  in this country
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:22.640]  that is going bankrupt
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:23.640]  the states are going bankrupt
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:25.640]  I don't have to go through the evidence of that
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:27.640]  you know that it's admitted on the news
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:29.640]  more than 15 states have gone bankrupt
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.640]  or on the verge of going bankrupt
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:34.640]  you've got 6.5 billion people that want to come here
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:36.640]  there's 6.8.5
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.640]  so I guess 6 billion
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:41.640]  850 million plus people
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:43.640]  8 plus billion want to come here
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:46.640]  and I was on a libertarian show last night
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:50.640]  free talk live and then they want to have a whole debate
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:52.640]  on their show and also my show about immigration
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.640]  they said well we're total libertarians
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:56.640]  you know we want to get rid of the borders
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:58.640]  and I said oh yeah get rid of the borders
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:02.640]  with Latin America that's completely collapsed
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:05.640]  and bring in a voting block that will vote to take our guns
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.640]  and will vote to take our private property
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:10.640]  that's the fact that's how those people vote
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:12.640]  and that will bankrupt the states
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:14.640]  because we have this welfare system
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:17.640]  we didn't have a democratic party in liberation theology
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:20.640]  I had a caller yesterday and we're going back to our guest
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:24.640]  on that show who said well what's wrong with liberation theology
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:26.640]  well the Ford Foundation and the federal government
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:29.640]  for 50 years have taught people in Mexico
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:31.640]  and in all the public schools in the US
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:34.640]  I was taught this in Rockwall and then in Austin
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:36.640]  in Dallas and in Austin
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.640]  no matter what class, where I went
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:41.640]  then in college that America stole Mexico
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:45.640]  America's evil, America's going to fall to Ozzedlan
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:48.640]  the mythical southwest kingdom of the Aztecs
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.640]  we have the video clip of the former Austin mayor
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:54.640]  saying that Hispanics are the god race
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:58.640]  look I could care less if you got brown skin under Hispanic
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:01.640]  okay I like Senoritas and I like Mexican culture
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:03.640]  and I like enchiladas
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:06.640]  I liked a vacation in Mexico that wasn't so dangerous
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:11.640]  but Mexico is a collapsing society
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:14.640]  with 23 plus thousand deaths the last two years
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:19.640]  and they want the North American Union to merge me into this
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:22.640]  and the North American Union, SPP is an undemocratic system
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:25.640]  and the guy called in and said I used to really love you
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.640]  but I feel like you're in cultural steroids
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.640]  and that you don't like Hispanics
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:31.640]  I could care less what color you are
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:33.640]  it's how you behave
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:35.640]  are you a constitutionalist
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:37.640]  are you into a free society
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:40.640]  I mean come on, I mean to all these libertarians
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:43.640]  the big global corporations want open borders
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:45.640]  why do you think that is
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.640]  I mean I asked this question
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:50.640]  and why does the Israeli lobby
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:53.640]  almost to a man vote to take my guns
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:56.640]  and vote to open my borders up
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.640]  and if the Muslims are basically blood drinking vampires
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:00.640]  that want to rip my throat out
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.640]  why are they always lobbying to bring unlimited immigration in
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:08.640]  why, why is the pro-Israel lobby
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:10.640]  in Europe lobbying for open borders
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.640]  what is going on with that
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.640]  why does the pro-Israel lobby
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:18.640]  Schumer and Lieberman
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:22.640]  the leaders of the open border and anti-gun movement
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:24.640]  but they want Israel to have borders
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:27.640]  they want Israel to have M16s
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:30.640]  so great have your walls and have your M16s Israel
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.640]  we deserve M16s
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.640]  you know that's my issue
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:36.640]  and so going back to you and then calls
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.640]  with Dr. Corey Gold who is an American Jew
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.640]  calling him saying he's a Zionist
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.640]  meaning he believes in Israel as a right to exist
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:46.640]  okay, well I believe America has a right to exist
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:50.640]  and you know I know his show he's pro-Second Amendment
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:51.640]  pro-border that's great
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:53.640]  I mean how do you
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:57.640]  why do we see so much of the pro-Israel lobby
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:59.640]  then at the same time
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:02.640]  going along with Obama and others against our liberties here at home
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:04.640]  why is there that schizophrenia
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:06.640]  it is a schizophrenia
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.640]  and I don't understand it
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:09.640]  as you said earlier I'm pro-border control
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:11.640]  I'm pro what they're doing in Arizona
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:12.640]  I'm for gun rights
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.640]  and a lot of Jewish people are
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:15.640]  we're not monolithic
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:17.640]  those individuals I have
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:19.640]  I'm glad they're pro-Israel
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:21.640]  but there are other stances I disagree with
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:24.640]  so you know Jewish people are not monolithic
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:26.640]  they can have very divergent point of views
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.640]  Chuck Schumer and the way he's dealing with
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.640]  American sovereignty I'm totally against what he's saying
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:31.640]  absolutely 100%
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:35.640]  well how do we get then the wealthy, intelligent, well educated
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:38.640]  Jewish communities to go elect Jews
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:42.640]  who are pro-Second Amendment anti-New World Order
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:45.640]  because I'll guarantee you all this anti
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:46.640]  and of course we've been talking off air
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:47.640]  no one denies it
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:50.640]  this massive wave of anti-Israel anti-Jew
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:52.640]  because first it was all we just don't like Zionists
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:53.640]  is what the white supremacists say
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:55.640]  and then next it's no it's Jews
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:58.640]  and they put out a lot of propaganda in this info
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:01.640]  but then it doesn't help Israel's case
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:03.640]  when it's lobbyists here in the US
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:05.640]  are going against so many of our freedoms
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:08.640]  I'll guarantee you a lot of this anti-Israel stuff
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:11.640]  would disappear overnight if the Israeli lobby
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:13.640]  and I know it's not one monolithic group
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:17.640]  but predominantly would stop going for the New World Order
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.640]  yeah but you know people who are Zionists
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.640]  and people who are Jewish people
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:25.640]  cannot control what Chuck Schumer does
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:28.640]  and they can't control what Joseph Lieberman
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:30.640]  and they can't control what those individuals do
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:33.640]  these individuals are doing their own thing
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:34.640]  for their own purposes
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:36.640]  and I don't understand what they are
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:37.640]  I can't tell you what they are
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:39.640]  because the person who's for border control
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:40.640]  and for Kahn's rights
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:42.640]  I don't know why they would want to do what they're doing
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:43.640]  and you're right
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:47.640]  they do support Israel and have them have a right to exist
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:48.640]  but on the other hand they do things
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:50.640]  that can be considered anti-American
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:52.640]  so I think that's just their own selves
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.640]  whether or not they have problems with America
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:56.640]  whether they don't like America
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:58.640]  whether they want America to become part of the Union
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:38:59.640]  I can't tell you what that is
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:00.640]  but yeah you're right
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:02.640]  they seem to have on one hand a belief
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.640]  that Israel should have those rights
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.640]  and America shouldn't
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:06.640]  so yeah you're right
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.640]  you're calling it out for what it is
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.640]  well that's my only issue
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:13.640]  and I guarantee you if the Jewish folks in America
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:15.640]  got really educated on this issue
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:16.640]  which you never see on the media
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:21.640]  they could basically reverse what's going on
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:23.640]  but of course it's not just the Jewish politicians
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:24.640]  it's basically all of them
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:26.640]  especially in the Democratic Party
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:27.640]  but if you think about it
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:29.640]  when you have look at the open border situation
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:31.640]  I mean we've had Republican presidents
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:32.640]  Republican Congresses
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:33.640]  Democratic Presidents
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:34.640]  Democratic Congresses
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.640]  and they all talk about closing the border
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:37.640]  and it all stays open
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:38.640]  so I don't look at it as being a Jewish
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.640]  a Christian, a Democratic-Republican issue
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:41.640]  it's just well beyond that
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.640]  nobody's looking at that issue
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:45.640]  I agree with you but let me throw this in
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:48.640]  Jeffrey Goldberg came down here from Atlantic Monthly
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:50.640]  probably six months ago to interview me
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:52.640]  and he's a huge Israeli adversary
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.640]  I mean a member of the IDF prison guard
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:55.640]  whole nine yards
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:57.640]  wrote the key reports about fake WMDs
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:59.640]  he's credited with being one of the key people
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:01.640]  to lead us to the 2003 war
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:02.640]  and he wanted to come down here
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:03.640]  and do a peace on me
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:04.640]  and he's still working on it
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.640]  and you know so he's a pretty high powered guy
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.640]  so I agreed to meet with him
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:09.640]  and he agreed
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:10.640]  he said yeah no the ADL
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:12.640]  is really discrediting itself
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:13.640]  and he's gotten awards from him
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.640]  you know coming out and demonizing
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:16.640]  Glenn Beck
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:18.640]  and he's pretty pro-Israel by the way
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.640]  and demonizing all these mainline conservatives
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:22.640]  and libertarians
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:25.640]  and so that's another thing
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:29.640]  people who have defended Israel
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:31.640]  in the past then get demonized
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:34.640]  by you know B'nai Brethren others
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:35.640]  and it makes them very very angry
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:38.640]  so I just think that also the Democratic Party
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.640]  has kind of used some of these
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:43.640]  ADL type groups
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:45.640]  as a way to paint their enemies
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:47.640]  and I think that's backfiring big time as well
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:49.640]  the average person listening in
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:52.640]  the average person who is a Democratic by
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:54.640]  D by their name when they go vote in the primaries
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:56.640]  or Republican when they go vote in the primaries
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:58.640]  is so busy raising a family
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:00.640]  trying to keep you know their roof over their head
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:02.640]  trying to make sure their car engine starts
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.640]  trying to make sure their kids stay in school
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:05.640]  and do okay
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:07.640]  that they simply just fall along sometimes
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.640]  what the party says
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:09.640]  because they don't research on their own
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:10.640]  they don't have a
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:11.640]  they don't have the time
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:12.640]  they don't have the
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:13.640]  or in their mind they don't
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:14.640]  so they simply fall along
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:15.640]  what the party says
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:17.640]  so Republicans tend to hold similar values
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:18.640]  Democrats tend to hold similar values
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.640]  but it's simply out of laziness
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:21.640]  about anything else
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:23.640]  and if they actually had to examine
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:24.640]  some of their belief system
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:25.640]  they say well I'm not really sure
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:26.640]  where I got that from
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:27.640]  well that is a Democratic talking point
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:28.640]  you know you say you're against
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:29.640]  government run healthcare
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:30.640]  you're a racist
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:31.640]  you're against Obama
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.640]  you're a racist so I think
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:34.640]  I've been called a racist
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.640]  because I was against
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:36.640]  what Obama's doing with healthcare
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:38.640]  absolutely
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:39.640]  and you were telling me off air
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:42.640]  that you had a guest on about Obama's birth certificate
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:44.640]  and the death threats rolled in
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:45.640]  sure
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:46.640]  I mean that's just crazy
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:49.640]  so overall I just think the climate is getting nastier
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:51.640]  because the economy is falling apart
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:53.640]  and I think people are going to look for
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:54.640]  convenient scapegoats
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.640]  and we know historically
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:57.640]  one of the favorite ones is Jews
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:00.640]  and I do think that it's a dangerous scapegoat
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:02.640]  because we need to all look ourselves in the mirror
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:05.640]  you know why is poisonous fluoride in our water
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:07.640]  it's because we let the chemical companies
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:09.640]  sell it to our cities through their lobbying
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:11.640]  we need to stop just hating Israel
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:13.640]  and start looking at real issues
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:15.640]  we need to stop just you know
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:17.640]  hating Arabs and blaming them for everything
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:19.640]  and we need to get the vaccine poisons
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:21.640]  you know remove the mercury
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:23.640]  I mean there's all these real issues going on
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:26.640]  but groups just like to sit there
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.640]  and you know beat the drum
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:30.640]  and you know conveniently blame
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:32.640]  one group or another
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:34.640]  and overall every time
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:36.640]  things start collapsing in history
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.640]  we see this happen
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:40.640]  well government works by creating crisis
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:42.640]  when crisis happens people say
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:44.640]  listen the world economic situations
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:46.640]  they come into total utter chaos unless you do X
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:48.640]  and X is really bad
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:50.640]  but the unknown is much worse
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.640]  but we have to act right now what do you want
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:54.640]  the really super terrible or even worse that you don't know
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:57.640]  so people government works by creating a chaos
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:59.640]  by creating total fear
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:01.640]  and by creating the environment
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:03.640]  that if it's not acted upon this very second
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:05.640]  the world will fall off its cliff
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:07.640]  and that's what's happened with all these things
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:09.640]  we've done with the banking
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:11.640]  and that's what happens when they say
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:13.640]  listen somebody sunk a ship we've got to go to war
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:15.640]  this guy's got a weapons of mass destruction
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:17.640]  we've got to go to war
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:19.640]  look what's happened up the coast of Israel
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.640]  we have to go to war
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:23.640]  and then we sit back six weeks later and go wait a second
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:25.640]  it wasn't nearly as bad as we thought it was
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:27.640]  or this was largely manipulated
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:29.640]  or we were only given part of the facts
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:31.640]  or the facts were exaggerated
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:33.640]  but government works by creating a frenzy
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:35.640]  that will be worse
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:37.640]  well Victor Obstrovsky of course
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:39.640]  former naval captain in the Israeli forces
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:41.640]  and then a member of the Mossad
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:43.640]  he was in the Washington Post this morning
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:45.640]  calling it so stupid
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:47.640]  it's stupefying the way they did it
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:49.640]  and he said that clearly
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.640]  the
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:53.640]  naval forces and the commandos
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:55.640]  had no hand in their orders
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:57.640]  they were clearly told by people that didn't know what they were doing
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:43:59.640]  what to do
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:01.640]  and that they sort of simply gotten
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:03.640]  ships once they entered Israeli water
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:05.640]  that he thinks it's illegal that it was
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:07.640]  international water and that agrees with the other
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.640]  wide spectrum of experts
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:11.640]  and they should have just come up
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:13.640]  and disabled the rudders
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:15.640]  with metal nets they just throw into the
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:17.640]  propellers and that would have been the end of the
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:19.640]  story right there
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:21.640]  instead of these dramatic images
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:23.640]  so I think Israel was wrong in doing that
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:25.640]  but I don't just
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:27.640]  join in on lies
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:29.640]  clearly the commandos were not firing
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:31.640]  when they bordered and they were attacked with the poles
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.640]  and now there is the video
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:35.640]  of the people throwing flashbangs
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:37.640]  at the borders
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:39.640]  and so that appears to be the bangs that were heard
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:41.640]  ahead of things
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:43.640]  but I'll go further
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:45.640]  Victor says that there were probably Israeli
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:47.640]  for sure
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:49.640]  Mossad on board who infiltrated the groups
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:51.640]  so who knows if they were provocaturing
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:53.640]  but
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:55.640]  because we've just seen this from intelligence agencies
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:57.640]  so I think the bottom line is we don't know
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:59.640]  what happened here
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:01.640]  but I'm glad that Turkey
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:03.640]  is now saying that
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:05.640]  cooler heads need to prevail
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:07.640]  and they're backing off of their stance
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.640]  of military confrontation yesterday
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:11.640]  because can you imagine
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:13.640]  Turkey's a NATO member
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.640]  and Israel's a NATO member and the last thing we need
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:17.640]  is two NATO members shooting at one another over
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:19.640]  what really is in the big picture
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:21.640]  there's 23,000 people killed along the Mexican border
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:23.640]  and nobody seems to care about that
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:25.640]  but we have an incident where
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:27.640]  Israelis have an agitation at sea
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:29.640]  both countries think that they're right
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:31.640]  both countries think they did the right thing
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:33.640]  nine people die and it's bad
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:35.640]  and that's going to cause World War III
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:37.640]  and the last thing Israel needs is a war
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:39.640]  Israel's like in some areas like 10, 12, 15 miles wide
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:41.640]  the last thing a country that small needs is war
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:43.640]  and I know a lot of people say that Israel wants war
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:45.640]  Israel can't sustain war
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:47.640]  Israel can inflict a lot of damage
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:49.640]  on other countries if they're attacked
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:51.640]  because from the standpoint of taking a sustained war against them
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:53.640]  they wouldn't be around to see the end of it
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:55.640]  well here's a new video that's out
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:57.640]  Israeli celebrating attack on Turkish
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:59.640]  aideship in front of Turkish
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:01.640]  embassy Tel Aviv
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:03.640]  that is not going to be a good PR move
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:05.640]  there's great
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:07.640]  if there's one quarter of one percent of crazy people
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:09.640]  they're in Israel too
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.640]  that's like the people that say they're anti-gays
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.640]  so they go protest at the funerals of troops
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:15.640]  I mean and I've watched videos of those guys
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:17.640]  they really think
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.640]  they're doing something good
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:21.640]  all they're doing
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.640]  is making themselves
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:25.640]  and anybody who thinks the homosexual
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:27.640]  lifestyle is destructive look like idiots
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:29.640]  yeah no there's fringe groups
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.640]  and everything and the problem is
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:33.640]  if we only put the camera on the fringe group
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:35.640]  then we think that's what that whole country is
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.640]  every black person's this because we showed some
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:39.640]  six crazy black people
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.640]  every white person's this because we saw six crazy white people
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:43.640]  and it makes everybody look stupid when the rest of the people going
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.640]  hey I know all those
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:47.640]  lots of people in my group and none of us act like that
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:49.640]  they specifically choose what makes people agitated
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:51.640]  and by the way
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.640]  government works by keeping people apart
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:55.640]  if whites hate blacks and blacks hate mexicans
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:57.640]  and mexicans hate jews
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.640]  the more people that are separated the less we can get together
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:01.640]  the more
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.640]  and then meanwhile the big corporate
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:05.640]  unders can take over our society
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:07.640]  we've got you for the rest of this segment one more
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:09.640]  I'm going to keep you five minutes over if you can do it
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:11.640]  then we've got Dr. John Coleman
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:13.640]  coming on about committee 300
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:15.640]  let's go to these calls now again
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:17.640]  why you love Israel
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:19.640]  or why you hate it
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:21.640]  he asked for it
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:23.640]  so we're doing it but at a certain level
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.640]  folks this is a diversion
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:27.640]  from the economy falling apart
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.640]  from all the new taxes
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:31.640]  I mean I almost feel dirty
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:33.640]  even getting sucked into all this
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:35.640]  but it's just the nature of it
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:37.640]  and I try over the years to stay out of it
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:39.640]  but it's the same thing with the borders
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:41.640]  you cannot stay out of it
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:43.640]  Kevin in Nebraska you're on the air go ahead
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:45.640]  hi
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:47.640]  you guys both touched on what I'm going to mention
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:49.640]  but
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:51.640]  I think we have to look at the real big picture
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.640]  and we have to look at
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:55.640]  as the incident was either created by
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:57.640]  the Bilderberg group
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:47:59.640]  or it wasn't
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.640]  and if it wasn't then
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:03.640]  how are they going to spin it through the media now
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:05.640]  well that's another question
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:07.640]  why are all these crises all over the world
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:09.640]  suddenly popping up
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:11.640]  in the middle of the biggest banking takeover in history
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:13.640]  that's a key point
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:15.640]  and something
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:17.640]  stinks in this whole thing
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:19.640]  the way it was timed for the peace process
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:21.640]  for Netanyahu to be in DC
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:23.640]  your take on that doctor
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:25.640]  well I don't know who did what
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:27.640]  I think that you're right when those ships left
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:29.640]  Turkey
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:31.640]  it was with the intention of creating some type of world event
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:33.640]  because they knew that a blockade was there
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:35.640]  Israel said you come by we're going to board you
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:37.640]  they said we know what we're coming anyway
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:39.640]  we've got our camera people on board
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:41.640]  and the rest will be great video fun
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:43.640]  for the rest of YouTube
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:45.640]  so yeah it was sent there to create exactly what we got
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:47.640]  which is some people hating
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:49.640]  Israel other people being very fearful war three
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:51.640]  people thinking that maybe the oil channels
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:53.640]  will be shut down
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:55.640]  maybe they should hunker down
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:57.640]  I don't know who started it but when it left Turkey
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:59.640]  it was with the full intention of creating world havoc
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:01.640]  well said
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:03.640]  anything else Kevin
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:05.640]  just I guess that
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:07.640]  we need to look at what
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.640]  what agenda they're pushing
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:11.640]  just a smoke green for the
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:13.640]  economy takeover or what's the deal
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:15.640]  I guess that's just the thing to focus on is
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:17.640]  what's the Bilderberg game through all this
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:19.640]  since they basically control the media
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:21.640]  so that's it thanks
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:23.640]  I appreciate your call Kevin
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.640]  Brad in Idaho
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:27.640]  you're on the air
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:29.640]  you need to say Brad
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:31.640]  yes sir
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:33.640]  I have three real quick points
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:35.640]  if I can try
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:37.640]  you know the Bible
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:39.640]  I think people are so passionate because
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:41.640]  their belief system from the Bible
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:43.640]  and there's lots of great theologians
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:45.640]  in history that don't believe
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:47.640]  that the Bible predicts
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:49.640]  a new state of Israel
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.640]  and then there's people there's
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.640]  theologians that do believe that
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:55.640]  I think the big passionate problem
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:57.640]  is people's belief system
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:49:59.640]  and then they and then and so they
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:01.640]  either believe Israel has
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:03.640]  is predicted by God and so justice doesn't matter
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:05.640]  and I think they've lost
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:07.640]  their sense of standing
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:09.640]  for justice
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:11.640]  because of their belief
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:13.640]  and then my other point is
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:15.640]  yes
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:17.640]  the Jews and the Israelites
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.640]  I mean the Israelites and the Arabs fought
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:21.640]  2,000 years ago and a thousand years
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:23.640]  past that but for the
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:25.640]  2,000 years since Rome destroyed
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:27.640]  Israel or Judea
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:29.640]  there really hasn't been a war between
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:31.640]  Jews and
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:33.640]  Arabs
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.640]  there's a lot of them
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:37.640]  stay there I'm going to come back to you
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:39.640]  there are a whole bunch
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:41.640]  3-4 wars that Israel's had
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:43.640]  or even more if you count the smaller
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:45.640]  situations like 18 months ago
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:47.640]  or 3 years ago with
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:49.640]  what happened in Lebanon
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:51.640]  but yeah it's almost 2,000 years
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:53.640]  it's 1,900
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:55.640]  and
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:57.640]  60 years
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:59.640]  since
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:01.640]  Titus sacked Rome
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:03.640]  did you know that the global elite
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:05.640]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:07.640]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:09.640]  did you know that in a real meltdown
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:11.640]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:13.640]  than silver or gold
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:15.640]  it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:17.640]  before in this country and it's possible
[01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:19.640]  that could even happen again
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:21.640]  so our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:23.640]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:25.640]  they call it a survival seed bank

[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:37.640]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:39.640]  a full acre crisis garden

[01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:57.640]  buy SinoFresh.com
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.640]  it works
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:05.640]  yeah, it was a
[01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:07.640]  sinus destroyed Jerusalem
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:09.640]  1940 years ago
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:11.640]  or 70 AD
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:13.640]  now, I want to go back to your calls
[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:15.640]  we only got this segment and one other
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:17.640]  with our guest, but we'll have to have him back
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:19.640]  especially if he wants to open the phones up
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:21.640]  and have one of these debates
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:23.640]  because I think it is healthy to discuss it
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:25.640]  but I've got a more hardcore email here
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:27.640]  before I go back
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:29.640]  to your calls
[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:31.640]  Alex, I've got a question for your guest
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:33.640]  Jewish people believe they are the chosen people
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:35.640]  so with that believe
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:37.640]  does that not promote
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:39.640]  you are above everybody else
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:41.640]  the fact that the Israeli military invaded a flag
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:43.640]  Turkish ship, international waters
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:45.640]  and killed citizens the middle of the night
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:47.640]  that ship is the sovereign land
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:49.640]  the land of the flag, it flies
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:51.640]  period, if a group enters our property
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:53.640]  with automatic weapons the middle of the night
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:55.640]  even the sheep will fight back
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:57.640]  to sell preservation
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:54:59.640]  and it just goes on
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:01.640]  from there, I don't have time to read it all
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:03.640]  but what do you say to Chris
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:05.640]  who sent that email?
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:07.640]  I think he had two different things going on
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:09.640]  one is does Israel have a right to board the ships
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:11.640]  and we can debate whether or not you have a right to
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:13.640]  if you think
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.640]  if America thought that weapons were heading off
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:17.640]  if we launched against America we probably board the ships at sea
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:19.640]  and we'd all think there were heroes when they were found
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:21.640]  and we'd think that we were bums if they didn't find them
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:23.640]  George Bush would be a hero today
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:25.640]  if there was lots of weapons of mass destruction
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:27.640]  he's kind of a bum because he went to a war
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:29.640]  for no good reason
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:31.640]  about being the chosen people
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:33.640]  we couldn't have chosen a worse slogan
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:35.640]  if you could think of it
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:37.640]  every nation and every religion
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:39.640]  takes pride in that they believe what their religion is
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:41.640]  is true
[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:43.640]  and they believe that the people who follow that religion
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:45.640]  Christians believe that those who follow Christianity are correct
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:47.640]  Muslims believe that those who follow
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:49.640]  the Muslim faiths are correct
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:51.640]  and Jews believe that those who follow the Jewish faith
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:53.640]  are correct as well
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:55.640]  and everybody likes to take
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:57.640]  believe that what they say is right
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:55:59.640]  and that God loves them
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:01.640]  in today's modern world I'm a reformed Jew
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.640]  we don't look at the concept of being the chosen people
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:05.640]  we look as being people who are Jewish
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:07.640]  and we don't think that we're different
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:09.640]  or better or more superior to any other religion
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:11.640]  and by the way the majority of Jews fall to be
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:13.640]  either reformed or conservative
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:15.640]  not Orthodox
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:17.640]  if you're watching Yentl on television you think that's a stereotypical Jew
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:19.640]  that's not a Jew nowadays
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:21.640]  there are some of them and I know they're listening out there
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:23.640]  and they're mad at me but that's maybe 1%
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:25.640]  or 2% of the Jews in the world
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:27.640]  well a lot of the Orthodox Jews believe Israel doesn't have a right to exist
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:29.640]  you've got the Neutrocardian New York
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:31.640]  it just goes on and on
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:33.640]  I wanted to get to some call I just wanted to throw his email on
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:35.640]  I think you answered it well
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:37.640]  Brad finishing up your point I held you over go ahead
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:39.640]  so
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:41.640]  we're not counting the past 100 years
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:43.640]  so for like 1800 years
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:45.640]  there was no wars between Jews
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:47.640]  and Arabs
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:49.640]  that I can see in history
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:51.640]  and then the other thing that I want to make is
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:53.640]  I believe that the bankers
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:55.640]  grabbed a bunch of
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:57.640]  very innocent Jews
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:59.640]  from Europe
[01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:01.640]  and took them to
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:03.640]  the Middle East
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:05.640]  as part of their new rule of order
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:07.640]  and I think they're just pawns
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:09.640]  well that's another issue
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:11.640]  saying that the Palestinians are being used by
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:13.640]  other Arab countries as pawns is true
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:15.640]  and I think at certain levels
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:17.640]  the Jews that are in Israel
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:19.640]  are also used as geopolitical pawns
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:21.640]  well people are pawns of their government
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:23.640]  the people in North Korea for the most part don't want to be oppressed
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:25.640]  the people in other countries don't want to be oppressed
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:27.640]  governments run their countries
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:29.640]  the people for the most part just don't want to be killed each day
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:31.640]  that's my problem with the cop out
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:33.640]  saying the source of all evil on the planet
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:35.640]  is Israel and Jews
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:37.640]  there was evil going on in every country
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:39.640]  before Jews ever arrived
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:41.640]  and it really is a bunch of hocus pocus
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:43.640]  to say that Jews are evil
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:45.640]  are there evil Jews? Yes!
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:47.640]  take it one step further
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:49.640]  if every Jew just disappeared today and we all took a carnival cruise
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:51.640]  to Mars
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:53.640]  you don't think the world would be full of evil people
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:55.640]  and evil governments?
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:57.640]  no it's ridiculous
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:57:59.640]  I appreciate your call
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:01.640]  it's a religion though
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:03.640]  hating Jews
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:05.640]  Carl and Michigan
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:07.640]  quickly Carl's are going to break
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:09.640]  go ahead
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:11.640]  I'll leave that brief
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:13.640]  what I wanted to say is basically Israel
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:15.640]  as many nations
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:17.640]  since the beginning of time
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:19.640]  established their country
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:21.640]  and drew out their boundaries
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:23.640]  by force
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:25.640]  and then when they get established
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:27.640]  in a position
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:29.640]  then they dictate to other countries
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:31.640]  whether or not they have
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:33.640]  the right
[01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:35.640]  to do that as well
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:37.640]  I tell you what, stay there
[01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:39.640]  we're back in 70 seconds with the third hour
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:59:02.640]  thank you for listening to GCN
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:06.240]  It's true, seeds at all perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:08.400]  possible that could even happen again.
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:12.880]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:13.880]  seeds.
[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:18.880]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:20.720]  food for you and your family.
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:21.720]  And here's the best part.
[01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:26.040]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:28.520]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:31.760]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:35.960]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:39.920]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:47.560]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:59:47.560 --> 02:00:05.960]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:10.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:11.760]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:18.120]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:22.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:30.800]  We're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv at the start of the next segment with Dr. John Coleman.
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:34.760]  This has gone by really fast, and I want to try to jam in more of your calls.
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:38.520]  John, Rudy, Mike, Chuck, we'll get to everybody, even though our guest has to leave us here
[02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:39.680]  in a moment.
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:41.880]  But finishing up your point, Carl, go ahead.
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:44.120]  Well, I feel someone under pressure.
[02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:46.120]  I realize there's a short time segment here.
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:53.200]  But okay, going back to like the Holocaust and the fact that they had the right to defend
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:01:00.000]  themselves, and we, the allies against Hitler and us against the Japanese after Pearl Harbor,
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:07.320]  those are definite, but I think people are still publicizing this so much, things that
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:12.400]  occurred years ago, that there were the underdogs, they're the underdogs, and it has to come
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:17.720]  a time when people realize that they're no longer the underdogs or that everybody's
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:18.720]  picking on them.
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:23.880]  And in fact, quite the contrary, they're dictating, I believe, too much of what goes
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:30.160]  on with the Arabs in the region, and, you know, there is no reason.
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:33.960]  Well, now, clearly, Israel had the world's support when they were the underdog.
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:36.360]  More and more people do not see Israel as the underdog.
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:39.760]  That's a very valid point, comments on that, Dr. Gold.
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:44.240]  Well, after World War II, a lot of the world felt pretty bad about letting the holocaustics
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:47.720]  happen, and yeah, and they felt like, hey, we hold these people a little bit because we
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:52.880]  let this all go on, and, but yeah, Israel's a sovereign nation now, Israel should be taking
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:53.880]  care of its own business.
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:58.520]  I don't think Israel dictates a lot to Iraq or Iran or Saudi Arabia.
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:02.840]  Well, I think the argument is, is through the pro-war Israel lobby they do.
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:07.520]  Well, I mean, there's, I mean, Saudi Arabia has a very strong lobbying, you know, group
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:08.520]  as well.
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:11.840]  No, no, no, I agree that Israel's not the only powerful lobby, but, I mean, have you
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:17.840]  seen the Charon quotes in the Jerusalem Post in places, and that's one reason people
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:18.840]  get upset.
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:22.920]  Well, I've seen quotes from Obama that make me upset as well, and I've seen quotes from
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:25.960]  Bush that make me upset as well, so for you to take isolated quotes, we can get everybody
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:26.960]  upset all day.
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:27.960]  Yeah.
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:30.280]  All right, let's jam in another quick call here.
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:33.000]  John and Ohio, go ahead.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:38.640]  Yeah, I hope you have on Ralph Schoenman, he's written the Montograph, the Hidden History
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:43.800]  of Zionism, or James Petrus, James Petrus on Global Research.
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:45.960]  I've had Schoenman on before.
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:49.840]  He's an eloquent guy, he's also basically a communist, and I don't like communists.
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:55.560]  Yeah, well, you do a lot of red baiting, but at the same time, I think that...
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:58.680]  John, you've called in and admit you're a commie.
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:03.400]  Well, don't try that mind control on me that I'm imagining commies.
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:07.720]  Well, I'm not, I've never belonged to any organization, but what I see...
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:09.720]  Do you believe in communism?
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:13.640]  I believe that the workers should control everything rather than these elitist bankers.
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:16.680]  Oh, just keep your hands off my property, John.
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:17.680]  It's not all...
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:18.680]  Well, you own the trillions...
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:19.680]  Our bad stuff's gonna happen.
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:24.240]  The trillions of dollars derivatives, I'm sure that you don't own those, and that's the
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:27.200]  only people that are going to be suffering under any kind of...
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:30.640]  I agree with you, that's fraudulent, but listen, we only got a minute and a half with our guests.
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:31.640]  Go ahead.
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:39.720]  The point I'd like to make here is that Israel, a designist lobby in this country, has plenty
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:41.120]  of spokesmen.
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:45.400]  It has people throughout the media, and in the latest government that dragged us into
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:46.400]  this war.
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:47.880]  Many of them were dual citizens.
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:49.880]  We have the same thing in the Obama administration.
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:51.880]  This is the cutting of the...
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:53.880]  John, what war are you talking about, John?
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:54.880]  Take my point.
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:57.480]  You said drag us into this war, what war?
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:03:58.840]  He's talking about Iraq and Iran.
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:04.600]  Yes, I'm talking about Iraq and Iran, and they are now at this point bringing nuclear
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:08.320]  weapons and threatening to use nuclear weapons against Iran.
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:13.760]  This would be World War III, and I think this is disgusting at this point that we need more
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:14.760]  of this kind of propaganda.
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:15.760]  John, let's take it back to you.
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:17.400]  John, we're almost out of time.
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:20.560]  I'll have Mr. Gold back up, but let me just say this.
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:26.080]  It's free speech, it's different perspectives, and to say that other people shouldn't have
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:27.080]  a...
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:28.080]  Well, go ahead, Mr. Gold.
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:31.440]  What I was saying is, if Israel wanted to start war with Iran, they could do it any
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:32.440]  day they wanted to.
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:35.360]  If Israel wanted to nuke Iran, they could have done it long ago.
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:38.880]  So just to say they wanted to do it, but haven't done it, is ridiculous.
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:41.320]  If Israel wanted a war with Iran, there'd be war with Iran.
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:43.600]  They don't want a war with Iran, otherwise we'd have one.
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:46.200]  Listen, is there a website you want to fire out?
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:47.200]  Just hope...
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:48.200]  No, I'm all cool.
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:49.200]  I go to ksco.com.
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:50.200]  That's my radio station.
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:51.200]  ksco.com.
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:54.280]  Dr. Corey Gold, good talking to you.
[02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:55.280]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:58.200]  All right, we'll be back with Dr. John Coleman.
[02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:00.920]  That was a heated debate, wasn't it?
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:01.920]  Hello, friends.
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:02.920]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:06.040]  You've heard me talk about Calben 5-star soaps for years.
[02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:10.320]  This is an American-made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find
[02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:11.320]  in stores.
[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:14.520]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:17.600]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:21.240]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:22.240]  Take my word for it.
[02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:25.040]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:30.040]  Since 1947, Calben Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:31.440]  gentle on the environment.
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:32.960]  Buy American and stay clean.

[02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:41.040]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:49.160]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, satisfaction is guaranteed or double your dirt back.
[02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:59.200]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 for a free catalog or visit our website, 5starsoap.com.
[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:00.700]  Thank you.
[02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:03.080]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:08.600]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:12.760]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:13.760]  documents.
[02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:18.200]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:20.680]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:23.440]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:26.320]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:31.720]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:34.200]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:38.640]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:39.640]  financial system.
[02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:42.560]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:46.240]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:47.400]  And I got news for you.
[02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:49.080]  You're everyone else.
[02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:50.080]  Invisible Empire.

[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:04.160]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:08.560]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:09.560]  do you want?
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:11.560]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:16.560]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:17.800]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:18.800]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:20.840]  Now or after the battle starts.
[02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:21.960]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:24.080]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:25.400]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:26.880]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:31.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.160]  and be immunized?
[02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:35.960]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:39.560]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:40.800]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:41.800]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:42.800]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:43.800]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.800 --> 02:07:44.800]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:47.880]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.880 --> 02:08:04.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:28.040]  will talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:31.880]  All right, we are now eight minutes into hour number three.
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:37.840]  We've got Paul Watson joining us via video Skype connection, audio for radio listeners,
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:42.080]  visually for PrisonPlanet.tv members in the first 30 minutes of the next hour, then Charlie
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:47.520]  Skelton who writes for the Evening Standard and the one Guardian reporter in Spain for
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:54.600]  Bilderberg 2010, giving us a first report on the closing of the resort and hotel today
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:57.320]  and the top globalist arriving.
[02:08:57.320 --> 02:09:02.400]  Going any further, the film Invisible Empire, a new world to find is our newest documentary
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:04.680]  that we have produced.
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:09.360]  Jason Mermas is the director and for the first time ever, the secret agenda of the planet's
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:13.600]  ruthless superclass is exposed and start to tell the documentary film Chronicles, How
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:18.280]  Men of Power and Influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:19.280]  world government.
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:24.000]  Learn how this global oligarchy controls the populace through drug trafficking, money laundering,
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.960]  stage terror attacks, media propaganda and debt.
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:30.320]  The criminal controllers have successfully dominated the globe and are now in their final
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:32.680]  phase of consolidating power.
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:37.760]  Government narcotics trafficking, white slavery rings, the pervert guilds, how they control
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:42.040]  people in Congress, how different globalist organizations tie together.
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:48.000]  Two hours, 24 minutes with extensive extras, it's got, of course, G. Edward Griffin, it's
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:52.640]  got Peter Del Scott and many, many others in the film and I consulted on it.
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:56.840]  Very important documentary and your purchase of the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:09:59.800]  material, you are what makes this show possible.
[02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:04.040]  So not only is this a great tool to wake up your friends and family and also to inform
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:06.360]  you to a higher level, it also funds our operation.
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:10.040]  Of course, for people that want to understand the banking collapse that's happening, how
[02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:14.840]  the globalists are doing it, how they're behind it, fall of the republic.
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:17.280]  For folks that want to know how to take the states back and the difference between the
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:22.440]  democracy and a republic and the move to have sheriff selected that'll say no to the feds,
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:24.360]  this should be given to every sheriff you know.
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:28.720]  The DVD is available at infowars.com.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:31.880]  Don't tread on me, rise of the republic and of course I'm in it.
[02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:37.200]  Back in print after 20 years being out of print, the secret team by L. Fletcher Proudy, how
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:40.320]  the top banks ran the communist and the U.S.
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:44.560]  He was the head of black ops for the Pentagon, CIA liaison.
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:49.360]  This is the book the CIA doesn't want you to read, available at infowars.com.
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:53.800]  You want to understand the police state control grid and have all the intel on what's being
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:55.680]  set up in the United States.
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:11:00.000]  The latest film that I directed with Rob Do and Jason Douglas, police state for the rise
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  of FEMA.

[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:14.560]  I want to thank everyone that has been supporting us buying the books and videos.
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:18.120]  More importantly though, if you own the books and videos, give them to people, make copies
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:22.240]  of my films, get them out, air them on access TV, show them to your church.
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:25.960]  People are ready to be awakened right now and also want to thank folks that have supported

[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:46.840]  Thank you for making this show one of the fastest growing radio programs in the world
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:50.280]  and the number one alternative radio show on the planet.
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:56.240]  We have the number one and number two, respectively, biggest alternative news websites according
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:03.680]  to alexa.com and other major statistical algorithms out there on the web, Google analytics, and
[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:07.320]  we are doubling our web presence every year.
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:08.800]  So very, very exciting again.
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:09.800]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:10.800]  Okay.
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:14.600]  Without further ado, just want to point out you made it possible folks and I commend
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:18.840]  you and we're trying to go to the next level and we can do it with your support.
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:25.960]  Dr. John Coleman, Coleman 300.com is the website, his 35 years of investigative study of 37,000
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:32.400]  pages of the annals of Congress, the congressional globe, and the congressional records has given
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:36.640]  under Coleman a unique, in-depth understanding of the layer upon layer of complexities which
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:39.080]  go to make up the United States Constitution.
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:43.840]  Very few of any constitutional scholars can claim such a unique distinction and he also
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:49.240]  is the big researcher on the committee of 300, political science, economist, Dr. Coleman,
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:53.880]  on location and on experience in the field of different countries, makes him a writer,
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:58.800]  scholar, and lecturer of distinction, the committee of 300, the vanishing middle class,

[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:14.640]  Dr. Coleman, great to have you with us today, sir.
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:15.640]  Thank you so much.
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:20.520]  All right, in the 46 minutes we've got left now, time is flying, you've got the floor.
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:26.160]  What is the committee of 300, what is the world government, and where is it taking us?
[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:32.440]  The committee of 300 is the world government, it's one of your previous programs as a gentleman
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:36.000]  asking about the new world order, how has it run, what has run through the committee
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  of 300.
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:41.160]  They're also known as the Olympians in the early days, and men spoke about them under
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:43.360]  their breath for care of them.
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:51.080]  This is a massive organization, which in the beginning was run mainly by the royalty in
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:53.840]  Europe, but now of course it's spread all over the world.
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:14:00.200]  The American Eastern Liberal establishment was allowed in to join it, and several other
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:04.200]  countries came in as lower echelon members.
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:11.160]  This committee was begun actually by the drug trade with China.
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:15.200]  That's where they've amassed their fortunes, and that's where they got their beginning.
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:22.440]  But of course they've gone from that to every level of society, every facet of our civilization,
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:29.000]  and they have people who have introduced population control and a wide variety of devices to keep
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.280]  control of everything that's happening.
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:40.400]  Now you can say that this is like a huge corporation where you have the CEO at the head, you have
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:46.760]  these staff consisting of the senior managers, then you have the lower echelon managers,
[02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:52.600]  and then you have these subscribers, shareholders, and that's basically what this organization
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:53.600]  is like.
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:15:00.720]  It is a worldwide control body with enormous powers because it's invaded every government
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:02.440]  on the planet.
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:08.360]  It's not a single government, maybe with the exception of China, and that will be Russia
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:15.040]  since the demise of the previous president and with the coming of Putin, of course things
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:16.040]  changed in Russia.
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:24.080]  This gives you some idea of the breadth and the depth and the reach of this organization.
[02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:28.600]  By the way, you're a political scientist and economist, and I've read your work for more
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:32.640]  than 15 years, so I vouch for what you're saying, but perhaps you should give people
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:39.200]  a few dates because you went and got source documents from the Office of Naval Intelligence,
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:45.200]  from retired admirals, from retired commander of the Office of Naval Intelligence, from
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:51.680]  government documents, and explain when it got its name committee of 300 and how it nexuses
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:56.840]  in with the Bilderberg group, with the Round Table Royal Institute of International Affairs
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:04.800]  in England, with the CFR in the United States, how these other globalist groups tie in to
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:05.800]  the committee of 300.
[02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:10.760]  Well, these organizations that you mentioned, like the Berger Burgers and the Council on
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:16.080]  Parliamentations, these are mere cogs in the big machinery, they're not the preeminent
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:18.240]  bodies that we have to deal with.
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:23.240]  They are cogs in this giant organization called the Committee of 300, and they took
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:31.080]  this name from a family of 300 very powerful merchants living in England, and it began
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:37.200]  with a charter from the Queen to give them the right to go and invade countries and make
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:41.680]  war against them, and of course, it was based on the Chinese Occupant trade.
[02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:47.400]  They had a huge treasury of money gained from the Chinese Occupant trade.
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:52.480]  They even got a charter from the British government to go to war against China.
[02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:55.600]  That gives you some idea of the power of these people.
[02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:59.400]  It's like a private organization that really is the government of the world.
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:06.520]  And of course, even MSNBC admits that in 1832, this same committee of opium merchants, British,
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:11.680]  Dutch East India that had merged hundreds of years before, set up just skull and bones
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:14.160]  to take over the elite of the United States.
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:20.080]  So this is really the oldest continually operating private intelligence operation.
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:21.080]  Absolutely.
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:28.640]  They co-opted the best available brains in the world at that time, and all the old Eastern
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:34.880]  liberal establishment families, like John Handyside Perkins and so on, they were all
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:37.240]  co-opted into this committee.
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:42.920]  And today the CFR takes its orders from the Royal Institute of International Care in Chatham
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:43.920]  House in London.
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:49.440]  That's the daily of care that the orders are relayed through one of the brokerage houses.
[02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:54.280]  I don't want to name them in case they pass it against me, but they are the ones who convey
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:18:01.280]  the message to the Secretary of State and then becomes government policy.
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:07.440]  Important policy, monetary policy, in fact, very little that is enacted is not originally
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:13.680]  from the Royal Institute of International Care, which is the foreign, which is the international
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:18.360]  arm of the committee of 300.
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:24.240]  It's amazing, and of course, they use the drug war as a way to break up China, and they're
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:26.600]  doing the same thing today here.
[02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:31.680]  They make the drugs illegal and then take over all the criminal networks and mass all
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:34.840]  the secret wealth through the drug war.
[02:18:34.840 --> 02:18:35.840]  Exactly.
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:43.080]  That's how they acquired their massive treasury, their amazing amount of wealth.
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:48.480]  The wealth that those people have made David Rockefeller look like a piker.
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:52.760]  Give you some idea of how wealthy they are.
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:56.080]  And he's just one of their agents here in the U.S., correct?
[02:18:56.080 --> 02:18:57.080]  That's correct.
[02:18:57.080 --> 02:18:58.080]  Oh, yes.
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:04.320]  And of course, I also believe that there are two others in the U.S. agents as well.
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:07.080]  Herr Kessinger and Brzezinski are above them.
[02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:09.680]  Oh, Brzezinski was played a big role.
[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:15.040]  He was one of their foreign arms specialists, and he wrote many of the policies for the
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:20.880]  U.S. that were carried out, and especially weak, I think, in this regard, was the caught-out
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:21.880]  administration.
[02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:27.680]  They were like just servants to this committee, and James Earl Carter did exactly what he
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:28.680]  was told.
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:30.600]  He never deviated from that.
[02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:34.280]  Well, we've only got 40 minutes left, and it's clear I'm going to get you back up for
[02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:39.280]  two hours in the near future, colman300.com, a short segment coming up in a long segment.
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:43.760]  I'm going to try to shut up when we get back, and so intriguing, and go over your research
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:49.040]  of the committee of 300, what their goals are, how they tie to these other groups that
[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:54.000]  serve them, and where this is going in the future.
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:59.080]  With our guest, Dr. John Coleman, I'm Alex Jones, and of course, we cover this group's
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:01.600]  eugenics aims in in-game.
[02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:06.240]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:10.600]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:14.920]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:16.240]  allows you to have.
[02:20:16.240 --> 02:20:21.920]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:26.280]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:30.280]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:33.800]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:37.480]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:42.240]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:47.400]  one of my old sponsors.

[02:21:00.360 --> 02:21:05.920]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:07.160]  Tyranny is here.
[02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:11.080]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:13.520]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:18.040]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[02:21:18.040 --> 02:21:19.280]  on earth.
[02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:24.080]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cares, now being
[02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:25.920]  expanded nationwide.
[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:29.960]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an
[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:32.000]  old powerful shadow state.
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:36.040]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:21:36.040 --> 02:21:40.480]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:45.600]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street
[02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:46.600]  corner.
[02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:49.800]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:51.840]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:52.840]  It's here.

[02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:08.720]  Now let's remember that 30 years ago, the mainstream media said the Bilderberg group
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:13.960]  didn't exist, but Dr. John Coleman from Deep Research has found the documents about the
[02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:18.720]  committee of 300, and he believes it's the overall control grid.
[02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:24.480]  Now, the group he describes certainly exists, and we know that's the power nexus through
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:28.520]  these letter of marks that were given by the British crown to these families that then
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:32.680]  merged with the Dutch and others, and of course, took control of this nation.
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:37.400]  You've got the floor, sir, so how, so what is the Bilderberg group, just one of the key
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:38.400]  meeting groups?
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:49.480]  The Bilderbergers was founded at a place called, the Bilderbergers is in Holland, and that
[02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:53.440]  was under the control of the old Dutch prince, and it was there that they had their first
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:55.840]  meeting in the town of Bilderberg.
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:25:01.440]  Yeah, Usterbeck Holland, but my question is, how does it tie in?
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:04.320]  Because then when you research Bilderberg, you find out it was a group that had been
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:08.960]  meeting for hundreds of years, and just ties into what the Dutch and German arm of this
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:09.960]  same committee.
[02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:14.480]  Yeah, so what these people do, they take names that date back hundreds of years, and then
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:19.760]  they co-opt those names for their societies today, and you know what you're looking at
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:26.400]  is losing that group of people, as I said in my book, with commonly held goals.
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:34.640]  It's not the case that some just group meetings socially, in fact, the committee of 300 has
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:41.560]  150-year-old history, and they have some of the most brilliant and intellectual assemble
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:47.320]  to form a complete, totalitarian, absolutely controlled new society, like the new world
[02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:49.120]  order inside of one world government.
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:50.440]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:54.560]  So when did you first discover the term committee of 300 in the power structure, and what is
[02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:56.560]  their goal?
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:26:05.280]  Their goals are, they want to have an open HG world, an earlier member of this, of the
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:06.280]  elite coterie.
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:12.120]  He wrote a work called The Open Conspiracy Plan for a World Revolution, and it was a
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:18.640]  bold statement of intent, which nobody believed, of course.
[02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:24.640]  It was, except for this, and he brought the conspiracy, and it says that, quite to some
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:31.360]  of us, it's not true at all, the Open Conspiracy will appear first, I believe, as a conscious
[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:36.880]  organization of intelligence, in some cases, a wealthy man, as a movement having distinct
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:41.640]  social and political aims, continuously ignoring most of the existing apparatus of political
[02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:46.320]  control, or using it only as an incidental increment in the stages.
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:50.200]  A mere movement of a number of people in a certain direction will appear to discover
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:55.600]  with a sort of surprise, a common object to which they are moving, and all sorts of ways
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:02.560]  they will be influencing and controlling the governments of the world, and, you know, George
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:06.880]  Orwell mentioned something about this in his book, 1984.
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:10.000]  So that's really what that meant to do.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:15.760]  And I remember reading that HG Wells quote, because he wanted this global world government
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:19.400]  and talked about how they would exterminate most of the people, and of course, you know,
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:23.480]  he was one of their top thinkers, but that particular quote you just gave, where does
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:24.480]  that come from again?
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:33.760]  That comes from his paper, I read it to you, the Open Conspiracy, Plans for a World Revolution.
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:35.240]  That's what's called.
[02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:42.000]  Yeah, Plans for a World Revolution, we've got to do another paper on that.
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:46.760]  First in the, I found this document in the British Museum in London, which is one of
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:50.320]  the greatest repositories of information in the world.
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:54.240]  I was privileged, of course, having special access to certain areas that are close to
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:28:00.800]  the public, but that's where I found most of this work that I've written about.
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:05.240]  Well, he was quite open about a lot of it in books like the New World Order.
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:10.320]  Oh, yes, he was, but I mean, what I'm talking about is the formation of in the beginning
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:13.160]  was kept very secret.
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:17.000]  And of course, Cecil Rhodes tied into this, didn't he?
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:26.640]  Oh, yes, he was financed by the Lord Alfred Murna, the Lord Alfred Murna was an autocrat
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:33.240]  who'd made huge fortunes in Russia, and he sent Rhodes out, actually, to South Africa
[02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:38.920]  to gain control of the enormous wealth of diamonds and gold, which had just been discovered
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:45.000]  there, and Rhodes put unlimited money behind him, went around buying up all the claims of
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000]  the prospectors.
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:49.840]  There's really no mining of any kind going on.
[02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:55.080]  And from that small beginning, and they still have this all centered in the city of London,
[02:28:55.080 --> 02:28:59.200]  which is a private preserve, financial preserve of a committee of 300.
[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:05.640]  The city of London is totally different from London itself, it's a financial center, and
[02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:10.280]  Rhodes was, of course, sent out with unlimited money, and he bought up most of the claims
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:16.480]  of the small miners, and when the opportunities came to start mining on a big scale, they
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:20.480]  were there and waiting and had all of their appropriate wealth to back it up.
[02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:24.520]  And today, of course, the mines in South Africa are the biggest in the world.
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:29.920]  They have a gold seamless spectrum for 200 miles east to west, and it's not just some
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:30.920]  small cup of nuggets.
[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:37.280]  I've been down those mines, we've got down 6,000 people in a cage that drops like a stone,
[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:43.120]  and if you don't have a strong stomach, don't try it, and you get down to these places where
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:48.800]  they work and taste it, and these are enormous to plenty for a tire.
[02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:51.800]  Stay there, stay there, Dr. Rick, I'm right back to you.
[02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:55.520]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.520 --> 02:30:01.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:05.920]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:06.920]  What have we got?
[02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:09.400]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:13.280]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:17.480]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:22.160]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education,
[02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:23.160]  our money.
[02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:27.240]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:30:27.240 --> 02:30:30.760]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:31.760]  You have to be warned.
[02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:35.720]  We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common
[02:30:35.720 --> 02:30:36.720]  law.
[02:30:36.720 --> 02:30:40.280]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you
[02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:44.760]  Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping
[02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:47.200]  giant that is the American people is rising.

[02:31:00.600 --> 02:31:05.240]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:31:05.240 --> 02:31:09.560]  Not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family
[02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:11.560]  owned and operated American company.
[02:31:11.560 --> 02:31:16.360]  My family, staff, friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:19.000]  these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes.
[02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:23.000]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:24.000]  anywhere.
[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:32.600]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:31:32.600 --> 02:31:36.600]  Let's talk to the owner of 5star soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:31:36.600 --> 02:31:43.360]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:53.240]  I'm happy to say, our business is going down the drain, call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit
[02:31:53.240 --> 02:32:02.040]  our website 5starsoap.com for buying our one to two month soap sampler, thank you.
[02:32:02.040 --> 02:32:06.600]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid
[02:32:06.600 --> 02:32:10.480]  losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[02:32:10.480 --> 02:32:16.160]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union,
[02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:21.360]  resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:26.080]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and
[02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:27.080]  our families.
[02:32:27.080 --> 02:32:30.880]  Action out to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy
[02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:32.560]  of your own home.
[02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:37.160]  Colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural
[02:32:37.160 --> 02:32:41.280]  alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:48.320]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by
[02:32:48.320 --> 02:33:13.320]  producing your own colloidal silver right from home, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:33:18.320 --> 02:33:25.800]  Well, I tell you, 10 years ago you never saw news headlines about the Bilderberg Group,
[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:32.480]  here's the Times of London, secret of Bilderberg Club, ready for protest, and it's a high-powered
[02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:37.880]  meeting of committee of 300 members, but it's not as secretive as the overall committee
[02:33:37.880 --> 02:33:42.680]  of 300, and I've researched this, and our guest is dead on and has the documents and
[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:46.520]  he has the book, which you could call the Bible of conspiracy theories, but it's not
[02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:51.600]  theories, it's fact, and of course that's the committee of 300, Coleman 300.com is
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:58.080]  the website and we cover their in-game eugenics agenda in, of course, my film, in-game blueprint
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:02.360]  for global enslavement, and folks, this isn't a joke, you know, they stalled you and said
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:07.040]  there's no secret groups, there's no world government, there's no derivatives, the bankers
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:12.360]  aren't engaged in fractional reserve banking, the government's not shipping in narcotics,
[02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:16.200]  everything's fine, go back to sleep, now they admit all that's happening, but saying
[02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:22.960]  it's good. Fox TV says we're growing opium, it's good. Yes, world government's real,
[02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:30.240]  it's good. Well, from my research, this ends with a authoritarian world government with
[02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:35.240]  one child policy at the bare minimum. Now, you were finishing up going down the diamond
[02:34:35.240 --> 02:34:40.920]  mines, and of course the De Beers Oppenheimer Global Diamond Monopoly set up by the Milner
[02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:47.200]  Group, I've read documents from Milner at the end of World War I in 1919, these are
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:52.640]  public, saying we've got to get some type of thug dictator in in Germany and set them
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:58.240]  up for the next war, I mean, that's the wide-reaching long-term view, so they get Wall Street and
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:03.320]  the general public in a quarterly mindset, only thinking about the present and profits
[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:10.200]  now, but they're all positioned for the long-term win, okay, and we get so many intellectuals
[02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:14.360]  on here and researchers who say, oh no, the elite are short-sighted, but when you look
[02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:19.080]  at their long-term plans, they're admitted Ford Foundation operations, Brzezinski's
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:25.800]  25 and 50 year plans, no. Of course, the political science head at Georgetown, Carol Quigley,
[02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:32.080]  he says 30 year, 50 year plans, so no, it is quarter-century timeframe, bare minimum
[02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:38.600]  as oldest Huxley, part of these elite families, wrote. In 1933, it's all coming true, so
[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:45.560]  going back to Dr. Coleman, what is their end game then? What is their final agenda? Should
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:49.320]  we be concerned about these autocrats running everything?
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:54.640]  We should be very concerned. If we want to keep our republic and the United States is
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:36:00.360]  not a democracy, it's a republic, let me make that clear. You cannot have a democracy in
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:07.240]  a confederated republic. Our principles may be democratic, but the actual form of government
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:13.160]  is republican. That should settle that question. And of course, we would be concerned because
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:19.160]  here you have an organization that's permeated every strata of our society, it's into, it's
[02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:25.040]  actually into the membership of the Senate and the House, and it does everything regarding
[02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:29.480]  controlling our foreign policy, our monetary policy and everything that the government
[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:34.960]  issues or talks about or makes this policy comes originally out of the committee of 300.
[02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:38.440]  Now, that sounds off the pockets. I know a lot of people are going to say, well, this
[02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:44.400]  guy, you know, he's off the wall. Well, they said that to me in 1972. They told me to go
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:48.400]  and hang myself, but there's all kinds of nasty things to me. But if you look back at
[02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:54.680]  my record, you'll find that I've made over 500 predictions, I have to use the word,
[02:36:54.680 --> 02:37:00.640]  but I said these things were going to happen in the future. And I think that most of them,
[02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:06.120]  we went through them just the other day and most of them have come to pass. So I think
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:10.240]  I've got a fairly good record as far as... Well, you've done the research. I mean, these
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:15.000]  scallywags are on record if somebody just digs through the government archives and stacks
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:20.640]  and you've been preeminent in exposing the overall black nobility, I guess you could
[02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:24.960]  call them, the committee of... Yes, that's right. And of course, would you agree with
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:30.440]  some of the other historians we've had on that this ties into England, Germany, the Dutch,
[02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:36.600]  but also the model that the British picked up out of some of the Italian families?
[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:43.600]  Oh, absolutely. The Italian families, like the monarchies, they were the model of this
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:49.440]  organization and most of these people, the old quarantine and Venetian black nobility,
[02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:53.600]  they are not black, their skins weren't black, but they were known as black nobility by the
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:57.880]  people of the city because their deeds were so evil that they could not stand the light
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:38:02.280]  of day. And they didn't take too much trouble to hide them either. That's why they called
[02:38:02.280 --> 02:38:06.960]  them the black nobility. And you know, that's the dynasty that Queen Victoria of England
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:14.840]  sprang from. So I'll give you some idea just how big these organizations have grown.
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:21.960]  Yeah, I've seen a lot of people now that are out there that have basically taken your work
[02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:27.000]  on the black nobility and basically declare it as their own, but that's the greatest form
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:34.960]  of flattery is imitation. I know that and I think my work that might well be in the United
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:41.960]  States anyway, or this type of information, the most plagiarized of all books of the conspiracy
[02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:46.920]  theories, but that's all right as long as we get the news out there. That's the main
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:52.920]  thing. Well, let's continue. You talked about an autocratic, oppressive world government.
[02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:57.480]  So from their documents from the research, are they on schedule? Brzezinski two weeks
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:01.640]  ago told the CFR for the first time the world is awake to their world government that they're
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:07.360]  in trouble. A, do you agree with that? And B, flesh out from your research, the type
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:09.360]  of world they want to build.
[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:14.840]  Well, they have been uncovered. That's the whole thing. That's not something they bargained
[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:22.440]  for. They certainly didn't bargain for that at all. It strives, as I said, to for a one
[02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:27.760]  world government, a new world order inside of one world government. That's the ultimate.
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:33.040]  We have a few people at the very top, and you have the middle management, and then you
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:36.560]  have the lower management, and then you have what's called the masses. That's us. That's
[02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:42.560]  me. That's you. We did our destined to be controlled, the population controlled, various
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:50.520]  measures, worldwide disease and wars. But Bertrand Russell, a senior statesman once said that
[02:39:50.520 --> 02:39:54.880]  wars were to have been disappointing. They haven't killed enough people. So what he
[02:39:54.880 --> 02:40:00.960]  said, we need that we read. We need to reintroduce periodically plays like the black play where
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:06.160]  millions of people get wiped out until we get our optimum size population. These are
[02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:11.800]  the things that are very, very real. And not the pigments of my imagination, believe me.
[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:17.080]  No, I've read, I've actually got the Bertrand Russell books where he talks about that. And
[02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:22.520]  then he's hailed as a liberal. And he talks about the scientific dictatorship, where a
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:28.440]  revolt of the commoners will be as impossible as a revolt of sheep against the practice of
[02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:35.760]  eating mutton. Exactly. That's exactly what that's exactly what the intention was. And
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:40.720]  you know, I had to bring Hitler into the thing, but it does. This the German eugenics program
[02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:48.440]  was actually started in America by the mother of the late Abel Harriman. She had a eugenics
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:55.080]  society based in Upper New York state. And she had a huge meeting in 19, when I think
[02:40:55.080 --> 02:41:02.920]  it was about 1921, I'm not sure of the date of the eugenics societies and a lot of German
[02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:06.680]  dignitaries came and that's actually where he got his extermination policies.
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:12.240]  Well, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was fully bankrolled by the Rockefeller family on record.
[02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:15.440]  Absolutely correct.
[02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:19.040]  Let me throw this curveball in because, you know, there's big debates on the internet
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:25.320]  by people that don't do research. I understand it's an imperial corporate letter of mark,
[02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:29.400]  you know, commerce system. And that's how the globalists describe themselves, because
[02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:35.000]  I actually read their documents like you do. But there's this obsession with its Catholics
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:39.520]  that run it all, or its Jews that run it all, or it's this group. But when you look at it,
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:45.000]  it doesn't matter if it's Jews, Protestants, Catholics, Hindus, Japanese, Chinese, the top
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:50.360]  families are all part of this power structure in all push for the same thing. And I see
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:54.840]  it as very destructive. But I see this major eugenics, I don't want to say Nazi, because
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:59.760]  as you mentioned, it was just an offgrowth of this, this scientific dictatorship eugenics
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:05.280]  movement is at the heart of it. That's what it's all about, a super race. And then you
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:10.080]  have this big movement that know it's Rothschilds, it's Jews, they run it all. And then you
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:14.200]  do see powerful Jewish families supporting the eugenics movement, even though they get
[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:20.480]  stung by it. So this is a very, I don't want to call it Nazi death cult, because again,
[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:27.560]  it predates that. But so what is the main power makeup of the New World Order?
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:33.440]  Well, it's a one world government, the one world government composed of the members of
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:39.240]  the committee of 300 inside a New World Order, where they propose to change every government
[02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:45.560]  in the world and make it submit to this New World Order government. And that's the one
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:52.160]  world government. That's exactly what they're trying to do. And we just want to have countries
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:57.920]  like the United States and China that wonder one world government where loyalty to nationality
[02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:01.640]  will no longer be an issue.
[02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:07.520]  And so it's not from your research a racial conspiracy. It's an idea. It's an idea. An
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:13.720]  idea that they said has come, time has come. And they're running behind their time table
[02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:19.720]  because they've been thought of opposition. For instance, Stalin, as bad a guy as he was,
[02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:23.080]  he had his good points. He threw a banner in the works of this. He said, I'm not going
[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:28.600]  to be the hold on a great country like Russia to a bunch of cosmopolitan's meeting in New
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:33.440]  York. And he said, we'll pipe them to the end. And that's exactly what he did. And of
[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:37.680]  course, Russia today is still a thorn in the side of the pressure of this organization
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:41.800]  because they have not joined it, despite of the pressure to break their economy, which
[02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:48.800]  very little exceeded one state. But thanks to Putin coming in, they managed to pull themselves
[02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:54.240]  around. And you can know that their best, best natural resources, Russia should be one
[02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:58.800]  of the greatest countries in the world. But they've been robbed, blinded by people in
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:02.120]  the past, these enormous powerful combines.
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:13.720]  Well, I mean, specifically for my research, when the globalist puppet was kicked out,
[02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:20.920]  then you got the drunken semi puppet, who was then replaced by his vice president, Putin.
[02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:25.200]  So Boris Yeltsin, from my research, was a puppet, did let the banking oligarchs come
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:32.120]  in and take over. You did. But but then Putin, Putin kicked them back. I mean, kicked them
[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:37.640]  out of the nation. That's what he did. Yes, that's exactly what happened. Yeltsin was
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:45.560]  a drunken puppet. And he was lived in an alcoholic haze all of his life, his adult life anyway.
[02:44:45.560 --> 02:44:50.480]  And the Russia was featuring on the very, very brink when Putin came to power, and he
[02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:55.360]  canceled all his monopolies and all of these international bankers fled. Many of them fled
[02:44:55.360 --> 02:45:03.120]  to England. Most of them went to Israel. And there is Oskie is the big man in England
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:08.120]  who runs the show there. He owns football clubs and enormous property holdings. He's
[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:13.120]  an extremely wealthy man. And the Russians have asked for people in him to extradite
[02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:17.240]  him to Russia, and they refused to do so.
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:21.840]  You know, you'd think for all of Russia's power, they could do something about Mr. Barobosky.
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:27.440]  Well, they did go over and assassinate one guy, it was close to him. I poisoned him
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:32.240]  with plutonium, a terrible death. But they've not been able to get near to him. He lives
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:40.680]  in a guarded compound, and he never goes around except to the 10 or 12 bodyguards. And usually
[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:46.000]  Russia does not like to commit atrocities in public if they can to assassinate a guard
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:53.680]  done in secret. And I spoke to one of the Russian generals myself once. He didn't want
[02:45:53.680 --> 02:45:58.720]  to say too much about it, he said, but they don't believe in making a spectacle when they
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:05.720]  want to get rid of somebody. Though the committee of 300 does like to
[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:10.240]  make a spectacle, I've noticed. Oh, yes, it does. But as I said, Russia has been on the
[02:46:10.240 --> 02:46:16.080]  side of the committee of 300 for many, many years. They, from Stalin's days, they refused
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:24.920]  to obey the dictates of the committee, and it cost them dearly. You know, it's interesting,
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:31.320]  Albert Gore's been in the news that day, and his father actually got many of the confessions
[02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:41.240]  that were given out by Yeltsin, and they were extremely rich from that.
[02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:48.520]  It's amazing. Now, again, going back to Russia, this has got to be upsetting the New World
[02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:55.440]  Order clan. Now, for my research, though, the committee did help knock off their cousin,
[02:46:55.440 --> 02:47:00.440]  the Tsar, and did help put the Bolsheviks in, or is that incorrect from your research?
[02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:05.200]  No, that's absolutely correct. They did do that. They did get rid of the royal family
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:12.440]  of the Tsars, because the Tsars were trying to Christianize Russia, and that they didn't
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:22.440]  want a nation of non-Christian people so that they could easily get in and completely compromise
[02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:26.720]  the whole situation. Because they found that statistically real
[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:32.440]  Christians will create amazing, independent local wealth and strong families, correct?
[02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:36.440]  That's exactly why they want to get rid of them. And if you notice that all of the Bolshevik
[02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:42.760]  leaders were actually non-Russian people, every one of them. All the people who commented
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:50.680]  the Bolshevik Revolution were non-Russian nationals. In other words, they were not able
[02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:55.120]  to speak Russian, but they were not of the soil of Russia. They were not actually Russian.
[02:47:55.120 --> 02:47:59.600]  All right. Shifting gears yet again in the time we've got, and I want to get you back
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:03.160]  up in the next few weeks. I don't know how it's been years, years, I think eight years
[02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:09.840]  since we've had you on. You just blank and decades flash past. But in the time we've
[02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:15.640]  got left, you do concur with many of the other experts we have on, and the Globalist
[02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:20.000]  on Statements, that they're in trouble. How much trouble from your expert analysis are
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:25.160]  they in, and what are you concerned about being their next move?
[02:48:25.160 --> 02:48:30.200]  The next move, I'm afraid of being concerned, is that people try to bring in totalitarian
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:36.760]  government in through the backdoor. And if you look at many of the bills and measures
[02:48:36.760 --> 02:48:42.800]  that Obama has passed, there's a lack of socialism to a degree I've never seen before in American
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:51.480]  politics. And this is the kind of sneaky backdoor entrance that they hope to make. An alert
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:58.840]  populace will resist whatever is trying to upset them the way of life, but the sleeping
[02:48:58.840 --> 02:49:06.160]  giants of the American people would not easily stop this. So they're trying to lure them
[02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:14.720]  into a false sense of security. And I think that the pronouncements and the measures that
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:20.520]  have been passed by the Obama administration are the most socialistic I've ever encountered
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:22.080]  in America.
[02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:29.280]  Well, we're seeing open pushes to shut down free speech. We're seeing naked body scanners
[02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:35.520]  where they admit they record your naked body down to break our will. The paramilitarization
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:40.920]  of police, the open federalization of police, all these leaders pushing for the secret arrest
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:47.440]  of citizens, the extrajudicial stripping of our citizenship. I mean, that's 110% bona fide
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:54.520]  tyranny. It is. But you see, what they are striving to do is to abolish the Constitution
[02:49:54.520 --> 02:50:00.040]  altogether. But if they can't do that in 112th swoop, then what they're trying to do is
[02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:05.840]  abolish the state trust, the 10th amendment. And they think that this way, people will
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:12.360]  be much less powerful and they'll be much more vulnerable for a takeover. And if you
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:17.720]  look at all the measures that have been aimed against the government, it's very, very alarming.
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:21.960]  Well, it's all designed to bankrupt them and turn them into vassal serfs who are going
[02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:25.640]  to break. That's why it's so important people get the film, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of
[02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:30.080]  the Republic with myself, Michael Bagnarek, Richard Mack, Charles Key, Cynthia Davis,
[02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:35.040]  Evan Vieira and others. This will teach you that it was between a republic and a democracy.
[02:50:35.040 --> 02:50:40.720]  This will show you how we get sheriff selected, how we take the states back. As Victor Hugo
[02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:47.040]  said, no army can stop an idea whose time has come. If you will simply carry the ball,
[02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:52.160]  folks, we are unstoppable. Get Don't Tread on Me at Infowars.com. Get the book, Committee

[02:52:05.080 --> 02:52:11.960]  line in the sand? What have we got? A republic or a monarchy? A republic is based on a constitution
[02:52:11.960 --> 02:52:16.880]  which protects minority rights. Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting
[02:52:16.880 --> 02:52:21.400]  on what's for dinner. So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children,
[02:52:21.400 --> 02:52:27.640]  our education, our money. We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate. Somebody's
[02:52:27.640 --> 02:52:34.520]  going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising. We have the facts. We have the constitution.
[02:52:34.520 --> 02:52:38.880]  We have the Bill of Rights. We have common law. Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:38.880 --> 02:52:43.000]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.

[02:54:00.840 --> 02:54:11.000]  You know, I've said it many times, I'll say it again. I'm not your slave, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:15.880]  I'm not the slave of the New World Order. We all need to basically declare that information
[02:54:15.880 --> 02:54:18.000]  publicly.
[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:24.920]  Dr. John Coleman is our guest. This isn't a game. It's not a joke. It's not a drill.
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:29.680]  There is a world government. It's out in the open. The denial is over. We are going into
[02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:34.920]  high-tech slavery unless we turn this around. And the way these controllers get away with
[02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:39.800]  this is they have so many dumb-down minions that serve them in compartmentalized positions
[02:54:39.800 --> 02:54:45.240]  who feel like they're part of the winning team. But this oppressive system plans to
[02:54:45.240 --> 02:54:50.080]  get more and more oppressive as it comes to power. For the globalist, for the Committee
[02:54:50.080 --> 02:54:56.560]  of 300, world government is only the beginning. Do you agree with that statement?
[02:54:56.560 --> 02:55:03.040]  I do, absolutely. That's only the beginning of the nightmare.
[02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:05.920]  Let's briefly talk about the nightmare. You're going to join us coming up in about a week
[02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:12.200]  and a half on Monday, the 14th, for Part 2. But if they are able to get their scientific
[02:55:12.200 --> 02:55:16.920]  dictatorship in place, which they're very close to, what is the nightmare?
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:22.040]  The nightmare would be that you will have no more rights of any kind. You'll be told
[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:26.440]  exactly what to do, when to do. You'll be told what type of employment you can have
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:33.480]  or not have. And it just goes on and on and on. In other words, every individual in the
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:40.280]  United States will be pulled in control and told exactly what he can and cannot do.
[02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:45.560]  I saw Bill Gates a few weeks ago bragging that he loves China because they're now deciding
[02:55:45.560 --> 02:55:50.040]  what children will be off of their DNA. But of course, in the stake and claim whatever
[02:55:50.040 --> 02:55:56.120]  they want and say that your DNA shows this or that, this is total control. This is them
[02:55:56.120 --> 02:56:00.520]  taking control of the human species, of our evolutionary development.
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:05.160]  That's exactly what they're doing. They've always said that man is nothing more than
[02:56:05.160 --> 02:56:11.240]  a mind and matter. He's not an intelligent being, even though he is born to be controlled
[02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:21.600]  and we're the people who are going to do the controlling. So that's more or less a situation
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:22.600]  with them.
[02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:27.720]  But we can take heart, though, in the awakening. Are they concerned about the awakening that's
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:35.080]  happening, Dr? Excuse me a minute. There's another phone ring and my office on time disconnected.
[02:56:35.080 --> 02:56:41.280]  All right. I understand. Again, we're going to have him back up with us next week or not
[02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:46.720]  next week, the Monday following next week, about 10, 11 days from now for a part two
[02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:51.040]  interview. So many great patriots out there. And I remember over a decade ago reading his
[02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:55.800]  book and learning so much. And since then, you know, I've done my own research separately
[02:56:55.800 --> 02:57:01.160]  and into many areas and just continue to realize how groundbreaking this information is. But
[02:57:01.160 --> 02:57:05.600]  for those that just joined us, you know, it's so important for people to see the film end
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:09.880]  game, blueprint for global enslavements. They understand the agenda we're facing. Sir, you
[02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:17.080]  were finishing up with, with commenting on the fact that they've been exposed and they
[02:57:17.080 --> 02:57:19.400]  are concerned. How concerned are they?
[02:57:19.400 --> 02:57:24.080]  They're pretty concerned because you've got, you know, Stalin knew about this thing to
[02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:31.080]  happen a long time ago. That's why he demanded to get the atom bomb from the United States.
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:35.480]  Because he said he didn't tell his friends Roosevelt and company what he wanted them
[02:57:35.480 --> 02:57:41.120]  for. But he said that this would definitely be needed for him to cooperate with them.
[02:57:41.120 --> 02:57:45.160]  He wanted, said to defend Russia, but he really was going to defend Russia against the New
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:52.280]  World Order. And he did not wish to see people in Russia to be subject to that. So he wasn't
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:59.400]  all bad. Of course, he wasn't really a Russian, he was a Georgian. But that is basically the
[02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:04.160]  intent to enslave everybody in a new world order, one world government system. Now it
[02:58:04.160 --> 02:58:09.200]  sounds very far fetched, but there's a great deal of logic behind it. And there's a great
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:13.680]  deal of information that I was money. I managed on those.
[02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:17.920]  Well, sir, you've been talking about this for decades now it's out in the open. It is
[02:58:17.920 --> 02:58:24.840]  now. It is now. And as I said at the beginning, people said I was off the war and I belonged
[02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:30.680]  in the lunatic assault. But many insults filled at me. Many I'd be there. There's many bad
[02:58:30.680 --> 02:58:37.080]  phone calls telling me to go retire somewhere. And we've gone from almost no one knowing
[02:58:37.080 --> 02:58:40.520]  about this to the whole world being awake. God bless you, sir. We'll talk to you in a
[02:58:40.520 --> 02:58:44.640]  week and a half. America's number one source for independent
[02:58:44.640 --> 02:58:51.040]  talk radio for over a decade. We are the GCN radio network.
[02:58:51.040 --> 02:58:55.160]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non hybrid
[02:58:55.160 --> 02:58:59.960]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[02:58:59.960 --> 02:59:03.800]  non hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true seeds have
[02:59:03.800 --> 02:59:07.280]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country. And it's possible that could
[02:59:07.280 --> 02:59:11.840]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[02:59:11.840 --> 02:59:18.040]  mix of non hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply
[02:59:18.040 --> 02:59:22.600]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[02:59:22.600 --> 02:59:27.280]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[02:59:27.280 --> 02:59:34.080]  acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com
[02:59:34.080 --> 02:59:45.400]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[02:59:45.400 --> 03:00:15.240]  non hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:00:15.240 --> 03:00:23.280]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are now into this fourth and final hour. We have a guest
[03:00:23.280 --> 03:00:28.000]  joining us, Charlie Skelton, writer for the Evening Standard and London Guardian from
[03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:34.120]  Spain at the 2010 Global Government Conference, the Bilderberg Conference that kicks off tomorrow.
[03:00:34.120 --> 03:00:40.080]  They've already closed the hotel and globalists are arriving. And here's the headline, Our
[03:00:40.080 --> 03:00:55.000]  Man at Bilderberg, 2010. So that is coming up in about 30 minutes with that information.
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:01:00.400]  Now for the first half of this hour, I want to get Paul Joseph Watson on. I wrote the
[03:01:00.400 --> 03:01:08.160]  article last week for PrisonPlanet.com dealing with the open conspiracy, the Bilderberg group.
[03:01:08.160 --> 03:01:13.320]  And this is a big deal. They psychologically, for the last half-century, told you there's
[03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:17.200]  no world government, no banking elite, no such thing as fractional reserve banking.
[03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:21.800]  The Federal Reserve is federal. Just forget about it. Now they've engineered a global
[03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:26.640]  collapse. They're bringing in world government. They're preparing to plunge the dollar and
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:31.680]  the euro even more, openly announcing world government. But all the yuppies have been
[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:36.600]  told it doesn't exist. So even when the news admits world government's here, the yuppie
[03:01:36.600 --> 03:01:41.000]  says, well, I'm a winner. And winners don't recognize that exist. So I'm going to let
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:45.960]  the government take my job and my pension fund because I'm a trendy. Well, they're going
[03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:49.040]  to do what they're going to do. We've got to reach out to people that understand what's
[03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:54.920]  happening and reverse all this. So a lot of news coming out right now out of Bilderberg.
[03:01:54.920 --> 03:02:00.880]  We've also got the Times of London and others reporting the secret of Bilderberg Club ready
[03:02:00.880 --> 03:02:06.360]  for protest. So we've gone from world government not existing to the media admitting it's
[03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:10.320]  being set up and people aren't addressing the puppet presidents and prime ministers
[03:02:10.320 --> 03:02:14.680]  anymore. They're addressing the actual power structure. And that's why Brzezinski said
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:18.680]  two weeks ago, top global strategist, that the new world order is in trouble because
[03:02:18.680 --> 03:02:23.480]  for the first time in world history, the entire globe is awake to the true power structure.
[03:02:23.480 --> 03:02:27.520]  So we should all be celebrating. Once the real enemy is identified, they can now be
[03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:32.280]  defeated instead of us fighting windmills. Paul Watson joining us from England. Break
[03:02:32.280 --> 03:02:37.520]  down the latest developments. Hello, Alex. Good to be back. And there we have it. Ladies
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:44.280]  and gentlemen, Paul Watson via video Skype, looking like the Grinch that stole Christmas.
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:51.360]  Hey, Watson. Watson, good to have you here with us. A lot going on. So many years interviewing
[03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:56.680]  him and having from England on video. It's just weird. Watson, we're about to go on
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:03:01.560]  a break, but tell us what's coming up after the break. Well, yeah, the fact that Bilderberg
[03:03:01.560 --> 03:03:09.160]  is now an open conspiracy is exemplified today with this London Times article. 10 years ago,
[03:03:09.160 --> 03:03:15.160]  the London Times, which is the premier establishment newspaper next to the New York Times and Washington
[03:03:15.160 --> 03:03:21.880]  Post, they wouldn't even mention the fact that Bilderberg existed. And now today they're
[03:03:21.880 --> 03:03:29.760]  reporting not only who's attending, but what their agenda will be. So again, that underscores
[03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:35.480]  the fact that everything that Bilderberg are talking about is now public and is now in
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:44.840]  our faces. Also, you've got a report out at prisonplanet.com about Iran announcing $40
[03:03:44.840 --> 03:03:49.880]  plus billion of US currency they're going to dump in favor of gold. That should cause
[03:03:49.880 --> 03:03:56.880]  some fireworks. Well, that's right, because Bilderberg are basically in a blind panic
[03:03:56.880 --> 03:04:04.000]  about the euro collapsing. Because for them, it represents the embryonic global currency.
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:10.040]  We know that the ultimate agenda is to move towards a one world currency. And that's exactly
[03:04:10.040 --> 03:04:17.760]  what IMF chief and Bilderberg member, Dominique Strass Khan, recently said at a meeting of
[03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:24.080]  elitists in Zurich. So they're in a blind panic about situation with the euro. And now
[03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:34.160]  that Iran and other central banks in the Gulf are quickly heading for the exit door. It's
[03:04:34.160 --> 03:04:41.240]  a big panic situation amongst the Bilderberg members.
[03:04:41.240 --> 03:04:46.360]  Paul Watson joining us via video Skype from England straight ahead. By the way, the audio
[03:04:46.360 --> 03:04:51.680]  is awesome. It's like he's in studio. I love it. Samplecasting and all at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:04:51.680 --> 03:04:56.360]  If you're not a prisonplanet.tv member, it's 15 cents a day. All my films, my book, Watson's
[03:04:56.360 --> 03:05:01.680]  book, the live video feed of the show, you can't beat it, higher quality podcasts, prisonplanet.tv.
[03:05:01.680 --> 03:05:08.640]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the
[03:05:08.640 --> 03:05:13.200]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[03:05:13.200 --> 03:05:23.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:32.320]  in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the
[03:05:32.320 --> 03:05:40.320]  crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[03:05:40.320 --> 03:05:47.120]  We turn jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[03:05:47.120 --> 03:05:51.680]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can
[03:05:51.680 --> 03:05:58.920]  ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it,
[03:05:58.920 --> 03:05:59.920]  others don't.
[03:05:59.920 --> 03:06:05.280]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:06:05.280 --> 03:06:21.500]  A video feed of the show and Kevlar's
[03:06:21.360 --> 03:06:32.820] EEVunts.com receives the
[03:06:32.820 --> 03:06:34.820]  to which our republic has fallen.
[03:06:34.820 --> 03:06:38.820]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:06:38.820 --> 03:06:41.820]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[03:06:41.820 --> 03:06:44.820]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:06:44.820 --> 03:06:48.820]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:06:48.820 --> 03:06:51.820]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[03:06:58.820 --> 03:07:03.820]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:07:03.820 --> 03:07:07.820]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[03:07:07.820 --> 03:07:09.820]  how much ammunition do you want?
[03:07:09.820 --> 03:07:12.820]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom
[03:07:12.820 --> 03:07:14.820]  and the lives of your loved ones.
[03:07:14.820 --> 03:07:16.820]  Food is your only ammunition.
[03:07:16.820 --> 03:07:18.820]  How much do you want? When do you want it?
[03:07:18.820 --> 03:07:21.820]  Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it?
[03:07:21.820 --> 03:07:23.820]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:07:23.820 --> 03:07:26.820]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[03:07:26.820 --> 03:07:29.820]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[03:07:29.820 --> 03:07:32.820]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:07:32.820 --> 03:07:35.820]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:07:35.820 --> 03:07:39.820]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:07:39.820 --> 03:07:41.820]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[03:07:41.820 --> 03:07:44.820]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[03:07:44.820 --> 03:07:47.820]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:07:47.820 --> 03:07:51.820]  Call 1-800-409-5633
[03:07:51.820 --> 03:07:55.820]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:07:55.820 --> 03:07:59.820]  Begin that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:08:25.820 --> 03:08:30.820]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson, the editor of PrisonPlanet.com,
[03:08:30.820 --> 03:08:33.820]  joins us for the next 20 minutes or so.
[03:08:33.820 --> 03:08:36.820]  Then we have London Guardian reporter Charlie Skelton joining us
[03:08:36.820 --> 03:08:40.820]  from Spain, the side of Bilderberg, 2010.
[03:08:40.820 --> 03:08:43.820]  Watson, you've written a lot of articles about what's happening globally
[03:08:43.820 --> 03:08:46.820]  around the planet, what's happening with the economy, with currencies,
[03:08:46.820 --> 03:08:49.820]  and of course the Bilderberg Group. If we have new listeners tuning in,
[03:08:49.820 --> 03:08:52.820]  we're saying, why do we care about the Bilderberg Group?
[03:08:52.820 --> 03:08:55.820]  I'm Chuck Herb, and many others have proven.
[03:08:55.820 --> 03:08:59.820]  They can predict two, three, four years beforehand what's going to happen
[03:08:59.820 --> 03:09:02.820]  from their sources in Bilderberg and also talking to people.
[03:09:02.820 --> 03:09:04.820]  They'll get there a few days before.
[03:09:04.820 --> 03:09:07.820]  I've done this myself a few times, talked to the servants,
[03:09:07.820 --> 03:09:10.820]  the staff at the five-star hotels, and they'll say,
[03:09:10.820 --> 03:09:12.820]  I've been told not to talk to you. I'll be fired.
[03:09:12.820 --> 03:09:15.820]  And I go, after you're treated like crud, after you hear them openly
[03:09:15.820 --> 03:09:18.820]  laugh about enslaving us, you know, give me your number
[03:09:18.820 --> 03:09:21.820]  and I'll call you after the fact. And then they call you going,
[03:09:21.820 --> 03:09:23.820]  oh my God, they're planning to enslave us.
[03:09:23.820 --> 03:09:26.820]  I want to tell you. And you find out everything.
[03:09:26.820 --> 03:09:28.820]  And we've been on record with all of this.
[03:09:28.820 --> 03:09:31.820]  And of course, it's just one of the big meeting groups of the
[03:09:31.820 --> 03:09:34.820]  overall world government. But Watson, let's break down
[03:09:34.820 --> 03:09:37.820]  what's happening with the world government right now,
[03:09:37.820 --> 03:09:40.820]  because the good news from every source, including Zbigniew Brzezinski,
[03:09:40.820 --> 03:09:43.820]  one of their top minions, is that they are getting in deep trouble
[03:09:43.820 --> 03:09:48.820]  and they're kind of like the cartoon cat in an old cartoon
[03:09:48.820 --> 03:09:52.820]  with 100 dishes and plates trying to balance things.
[03:09:52.820 --> 03:09:55.820]  And it's only a matter of time till they stumble.
[03:09:55.820 --> 03:09:58.820]  Of course, in that process, it's going to be very, very messy,
[03:09:58.820 --> 03:10:01.820]  should we say. So joining us via video Skype,
[03:10:01.820 --> 03:10:04.820]  Paul Joseph Watson, break it down.
[03:10:04.820 --> 03:10:06.820]  Well, yeah, just to pick up on what you just mentioned
[03:10:06.820 --> 03:10:09.820]  with the secrecy aspect.
[03:10:09.820 --> 03:10:12.820]  They're having problems with leaks coming out of Bilderberg.
[03:10:12.820 --> 03:10:16.820]  And obviously, this has intensified over the last few years.
[03:10:16.820 --> 03:10:20.820]  And now we learn out of the London Times report today
[03:10:20.820 --> 03:10:24.820]  that most Bilderberg members, certainly the most prominent ones
[03:10:24.820 --> 03:10:29.820]  that are going to be there today, are bringing their own staff.
[03:10:29.820 --> 03:10:33.820]  So whereas they'd normally rely on hotel staff
[03:10:33.820 --> 03:10:36.820]  to do all the cooking and cleaning and washing
[03:10:36.820 --> 03:10:39.820]  and all providing all the services for them.
[03:10:39.820 --> 03:10:41.820]  Now they're bringing their own in-house staff
[03:10:41.820 --> 03:10:45.820]  and that's explicitly to prevent leaks of information
[03:10:45.820 --> 03:10:49.820]  getting out to Bilderberg's loose that are there on the scene.
[03:10:49.820 --> 03:10:54.820]  So they're very concerned about secrecy and things coming out.
[03:10:54.820 --> 03:10:59.820]  But as we've, you know, the theme is that it is now an open conspiracy
[03:10:59.820 --> 03:11:03.820]  because Bilderberg members who get together once a year
[03:11:03.820 --> 03:11:09.820]  are revealing their agenda to their own flock beforehand.
[03:11:09.820 --> 03:11:14.820]  And this comes out in CFR speeches and in speeches such as the one
[03:11:14.820 --> 03:11:17.820]  I mentioned before the break, Dominique Strasscard
[03:11:17.820 --> 03:11:19.820]  who gave a speech in Zurich.
[03:11:19.820 --> 03:11:22.820]  So all this is coming out before they even meet
[03:11:22.820 --> 03:11:27.820]  which is why the topics of their conversations
[03:11:27.820 --> 03:11:29.820]  are already known to us beforehand.
[03:11:29.820 --> 03:11:35.820]  And certainly top of the agenda this year is the collapse of the Euro
[03:11:35.820 --> 03:11:41.820]  because for Bilderberg the Euro represents their embryonic
[03:11:41.820 --> 03:11:45.820]  one-willed currency. Now they already broke the terms
[03:11:45.820 --> 03:11:50.820]  of their own Maastricht Treaty to bail out Greece
[03:11:50.820 --> 03:11:52.820]  which they said they would never do.
[03:11:52.820 --> 03:11:56.820]  But they did it because they're in a blind panic
[03:11:56.820 --> 03:12:01.820]  about the fact that the Euro is basically on its way out.
[03:12:01.820 --> 03:12:04.820]  You've got Iran, you've got all the central banks fleeing
[03:12:04.820 --> 03:12:08.820]  from the currency and if the Euro were to go under
[03:12:08.820 --> 03:12:11.820]  then it would expose the inherent weakness
[03:12:11.820 --> 03:12:17.820]  of continental monetary unions and that would all but derail
[03:12:17.820 --> 03:12:20.820]  their wider agenda for a one-world currency.
[03:12:20.820 --> 03:12:23.820]  And of course I had Greg Palaston who I'm going to get back on
[03:12:23.820 --> 03:12:26.820]  by the way next week guys. I had him on a few weeks ago
[03:12:26.820 --> 03:12:29.820]  and he talked about meeting with some of the BBC reporter
[03:12:29.820 --> 03:12:32.820]  high level with some of the founders of Euro and they bragged
[03:12:32.820 --> 03:12:35.820]  the Euro was set up to take control of nations and rob them
[03:12:35.820 --> 03:12:39.820]  as an IMF World Bank extraction arm just like they do
[03:12:39.820 --> 03:12:43.820]  Africa, Asia, Latin America and that this was the plan
[03:12:43.820 --> 03:12:46.820]  all along and so they're holding Europe hostage saying
[03:12:46.820 --> 03:12:48.820]  we're going to economically destroy you and you're going to
[03:12:48.820 --> 03:12:50.820]  give us all your money and your pension funds and everything
[03:12:50.820 --> 03:12:53.820]  and our media is selling it like oh those lazy Europeans
[03:12:53.820 --> 03:12:56.820]  they just want three vacations a year and they want to be
[03:12:56.820 --> 03:12:59.820]  able to retire when they're 55 instead of 65.
[03:12:59.820 --> 03:13:02.820]  They deserve what's happening. The truth is we can produce
[03:13:02.820 --> 03:13:07.820]  unlimited wealth if this rational reserve debt black hole
[03:13:07.820 --> 03:13:11.820]  was removed. This is not free market. This is parasite
[03:13:11.820 --> 03:13:15.820]  market so the battle is joined with Deutschland, Germany
[03:13:15.820 --> 03:13:18.820]  which are big new world order people saying politically
[03:13:18.820 --> 03:13:21.820]  no we're not going along with fresh rounds of looting
[03:13:21.820 --> 03:13:26.820]  so all is not well in the kingdom of the new world order.
[03:13:26.820 --> 03:13:28.820]  Well that's right. I mean that's exactly what
[03:13:28.820 --> 03:13:32.820]  Brzezinski said during his CFR speech a couple of weeks ago
[03:13:32.820 --> 03:13:35.820]  that not only was there a global awakening taking place
[03:13:35.820 --> 03:13:38.820]  amongst the people but there was massive infighting
[03:13:38.820 --> 03:13:44.820]  within the elite itself and Germany is very upset about
[03:13:44.820 --> 03:13:49.820]  what the EU, what certain blocks of the EU were forced to do
[03:13:49.820 --> 03:13:54.820]  with Greece so now the Bilderberg conference in Barcelona
[03:13:54.820 --> 03:14:00.820]  just outside Barcelona. The key men who will be attending
[03:14:00.820 --> 03:14:04.820]  are from Spain obviously but not only because it's in Spain
[03:14:04.820 --> 03:14:09.820]  but because Spain could become the next Greece and if Spain
[03:14:09.820 --> 03:14:13.820]  goes the same way as Greece then the euro is basically
[03:14:13.820 --> 03:14:15.820]  heading for the toilet.
[03:14:15.820 --> 03:14:19.820]  Yeah they've already lost their AAA rating last week.
[03:14:19.820 --> 03:14:24.820]  Yeah they've lost a AAA rating so now the Spanish Prime Minister
[03:14:24.820 --> 03:14:28.820]  Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is going to give the keynote
[03:14:28.820 --> 03:14:31.820]  opening address at Bilderberg and he's going to be
[03:14:31.820 --> 03:14:35.820]  accompanied by the Spanish Foreign Minister as well as
[03:14:35.820 --> 03:14:40.820]  Spain's former Economy Minister so they're basically there
[03:14:40.820 --> 03:14:45.820]  to try and reassure the Bilderberg members that Spain
[03:14:45.820 --> 03:14:49.820]  won't go the same way as Greece with massive crippling debts
[03:14:49.820 --> 03:14:52.820]  which of course lead to these austerity measures which
[03:14:52.820 --> 03:14:55.820]  provoke the riots that we've seen across Greece in the last
[03:14:55.820 --> 03:15:00.820]  couple of months so you've got a heavy presence from Spain
[03:15:00.820 --> 03:15:04.820]  and that's because Spain is in trouble.
[03:15:04.820 --> 03:15:08.820]  Part of their problem is not just related to the economic
[03:15:08.820 --> 03:15:13.820]  meltdown it's because of Spain's disastrous effort to
[03:15:13.820 --> 03:15:19.820]  implement the green economy which they were mandated to do
[03:15:19.820 --> 03:15:24.820]  by Bilderberg policies specifically the EU Commission
[03:15:24.820 --> 03:15:31.820]  head Baroso who coined the term post industrial revolution
[03:15:31.820 --> 03:15:35.820]  and the green economy is part of that post industrial
[03:15:35.820 --> 03:15:36.820]  revolution.
[03:15:36.820 --> 03:15:39.820]  And it's designed to destroy your economy so you can't pay
[03:15:39.820 --> 03:15:41.820]  the bankers back so they come in and take over.
[03:15:41.820 --> 03:15:45.820]  I mean it's literally economic warfare in the words of the
[03:15:45.820 --> 03:15:50.820]  Club of Rome, of the UN, of the head of NASA, of the
[03:15:50.820 --> 03:15:51.820]  White House science are.
[03:15:51.820 --> 03:15:57.820]  I mean this is a group of control freaks engaging in
[03:15:57.820 --> 03:16:01.820]  economic siege and they are carrying this operation out
[03:16:01.820 --> 03:16:07.820]  and we must have Europe throw their behinds out of there.
[03:16:07.820 --> 03:16:11.820]  Yeah and it's an agenda to reduce living standards which is
[03:16:11.820 --> 03:16:14.820]  what is happening in Europe as the taxes go up and the
[03:16:14.820 --> 03:16:18.820]  public services get cut and it's been felt most painfully in
[03:16:18.820 --> 03:16:19.820]  Spain.
[03:16:19.820 --> 03:16:24.820]  You've got an unemployment rate in Spain of 18% and that is a
[03:16:24.820 --> 03:16:28.820]  consequence of this green economy because for every job
[03:16:28.820 --> 03:16:34.820]  created as part of the green economy more than 2.2 jobs are
[03:16:34.820 --> 03:16:38.820]  lost and in fact a leaked internal document that came out of
[03:16:38.820 --> 03:16:43.820]  Spain a couple of weeks ago said that the rate of job
[03:16:43.820 --> 03:16:47.820]  loss is in fact worse than 2.2 jobs for everyone gained.
[03:16:47.820 --> 03:16:51.820]  So the report basically said if we don't get out of this
[03:16:51.820 --> 03:16:55.820]  post industrial revolution, this green economy, we're going
[03:16:55.820 --> 03:16:57.820]  to face economic ruin.
[03:16:57.820 --> 03:17:01.820]  So that's what the Spanish political leaders are at
[03:17:01.820 --> 03:17:06.820]  Bilderberg to discuss is how they can extricate themselves
[03:17:06.820 --> 03:17:10.820]  from this green economy, rescue their own economy and in
[03:17:10.820 --> 03:17:14.820]  turn rescue the euro which is what Bilderberg and the
[03:17:14.820 --> 03:17:19.820]  globalists in general need to do if confidence will remain
[03:17:19.820 --> 03:17:22.820]  in their agenda to create a global currency because if the
[03:17:22.820 --> 03:17:27.820]  euro goes then a big part of their agenda to centralise the
[03:17:27.820 --> 03:17:30.820]  world economic system goes.
[03:17:30.820 --> 03:17:34.820]  Separately your report that's also in press TV official
[03:17:34.820 --> 03:17:38.820]  organ of Tehran that fits into this more and more of the
[03:17:38.820 --> 03:17:41.820]  Arab nations and the Persians or the Iranians are saying
[03:17:41.820 --> 03:17:46.820]  they're dumping with dollar right now and going to gold and
[03:17:46.820 --> 03:17:49.820]  of course you notice gold's been up the last few days.
[03:17:49.820 --> 03:17:52.820]  Break that down for us.
[03:17:52.820 --> 03:17:55.820]  Yeah, the central bank of Iran announced today that they were
[03:17:55.820 --> 03:18:01.820]  going to dump 45 billion euros and exchange it for gold
[03:18:01.820 --> 03:18:07.820]  bullion and dollars and also Chinese state media reported
[03:18:07.820 --> 03:18:10.820]  that several Gulf states were going to do the same thing.
[03:18:10.820 --> 03:18:15.820]  Now the major central banks are desperately still clinging
[03:18:15.820 --> 03:18:17.820]  to their euros because they're desperately trying to
[03:18:17.820 --> 03:18:22.820]  prevent its collapse and this is evident with clear examples
[03:18:22.820 --> 03:18:26.820]  of manipulation in the forex market which we saw yesterday
[03:18:26.820 --> 03:18:31.820]  when the euro was way down against the dollar and within
[03:18:31.820 --> 03:18:37.820]  the space of 25 minutes it's shot up by 250 pips on the
[03:18:37.820 --> 03:18:39.820]  forex market.
[03:18:39.820 --> 03:18:43.820]  So basically whenever the euro gets down to 121 against the
[03:18:43.820 --> 03:18:47.820]  dollar the ECB comes in with an intervention and then it
[03:18:47.820 --> 03:18:51.820]  spikes right back up again but normally that intervention
[03:18:51.820 --> 03:18:55.820]  would buoy the currency and it would last for days or weeks
[03:18:55.820 --> 03:19:00.820]  but as we've seen today with the euro flat or even down
[03:19:00.820 --> 03:19:03.820]  against the dollar the last time I looked about an hour ago
[03:19:03.820 --> 03:19:06.820]  it doesn't work anymore even though the central banks are
[03:19:06.820 --> 03:19:10.820]  intervening investors and other countries like Iran and
[03:19:10.820 --> 03:19:14.820]  Gulf states are still aggressively dumping the euro
[03:19:14.820 --> 03:19:19.820]  because they've read the predictions of big financial
[03:19:19.820 --> 03:19:23.820]  houses like BNP Paribas who say that the euro is going to
[03:19:23.820 --> 03:19:27.820]  parity against the dollar by next year and of course the
[03:19:27.820 --> 03:19:30.820]  dollar is going to soon follow in its footsteps.
[03:19:30.820 --> 03:19:32.820]  When we come back we're going to get your take from the
[03:19:32.820 --> 03:19:34.820]  times of London.
[03:19:34.820 --> 03:19:36.820]  Greece urged to give up euro.
[03:19:36.820 --> 03:19:39.820]  The Greek government has been advised by British economists
[03:19:39.820 --> 03:19:44.820]  to leave the euro in default on its 300 billion pound debt
[03:19:44.820 --> 03:19:46.820]  to save its economy.
[03:19:46.820 --> 03:19:49.820]  Whenever economics and business research or London based
[03:19:49.820 --> 03:19:51.820]  consultancy has warned Greek ministers they will be unable
[03:19:51.820 --> 03:19:54.820]  to escape their debt trap without devaluing their currency
[03:19:54.820 --> 03:19:56.820]  to boost exports and that's actually true.
[03:19:56.820 --> 03:19:59.820]  We'll be right back and get Watson's take on this and the
[03:19:59.820 --> 03:20:01.820]  flotilla incident. Stay with us.

[03:22:05.460 --> 03:22:11.540]  their line in the sand? What have we got? A republic or a monarchy? A republic is
[03:22:11.540 --> 03:22:15.540]  based on a constitution which protects minority rights. Not democracy, not mob
[03:22:15.540 --> 03:22:19.100]  rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner. So they think they own
[03:22:19.100 --> 03:22:24.100]  our land, they think they're on our water, children, our education, our money. We
[03:22:24.100 --> 03:22:29.180]  have to define who we are and what we will tolerate. Somebody's gonna ask you
[03:22:29.180 --> 03:22:34.380]  what you did during the Patriot uprising. We have the facts, we have the
[03:22:34.380 --> 03:22:38.220]  Constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law. Knowledge is power
[03:22:38.220 --> 03:22:41.900]  ladies and gentlemen and I'm so excited to be able to offer you. Don't tread on

[03:23:05.300 --> 03:23:09.580]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much
[03:23:09.580 --> 03:23:13.940]  ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for
[03:23:13.940 --> 03:23:18.620]  freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do
[03:23:18.620 --> 03:23:22.780]  you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts. When will you
[03:23:22.780 --> 03:23:26.580]  need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[03:23:26.580 --> 03:23:30.340]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[03:23:30.340 --> 03:23:34.580]  yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all
[03:23:34.580 --> 03:23:39.060]  these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight
[03:23:39.060 --> 03:23:43.700]  for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do
[03:23:43.700 --> 03:23:48.220]  you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to
[03:23:48.220 --> 03:23:55.100]  fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at
[03:23:55.100 --> 03:24:13.820]  eFoodsDirect.com. Again that number 1-800-409-5633. By the way, this video
[03:24:13.820 --> 03:24:19.300]  Skype is working so well from England. Really, Watson has great political
[03:24:19.300 --> 03:24:22.740]  understanding and research. That's why he's one of our chief writers and web
[03:24:22.740 --> 03:24:27.540]  masters. I remember eight, nine years ago when I hired him watching some of the
[03:24:27.540 --> 03:24:30.500]  work he was doing and thinking it was first rate and he's been part of the
[03:24:30.500 --> 03:24:34.580]  team for a long time. So now that we have this, this is a great video slash audio
[03:24:34.580 --> 03:24:40.180]  connection to England. We may have to start having Watson sit in occasionally
[03:24:40.180 --> 03:24:45.420]  when I'm working on a film or out of town on assignment. Going back to Paul
[03:24:45.420 --> 03:24:49.060]  Watson in the four and a half minutes we've got left before we go to Spain and
[03:24:49.060 --> 03:24:56.820]  talk about the Bilderberg group to the nearby city of Sages where the airspace
[03:24:56.820 --> 03:25:01.020]  has now been closed for the owners, the criminal owners of the planet to nest and
[03:25:01.020 --> 03:25:07.580]  plan their next ripoff. We went to break and we were talking about this
[03:25:07.580 --> 03:25:14.740]  headline, Greece urged to give up Euro. So this thing is really falling apart
[03:25:14.740 --> 03:25:21.640]  quickly Watson. Yeah and a lot of people in Greece said that that's exactly what
[03:25:21.640 --> 03:25:26.740]  they should do but the leadership in Greece have been strong armed by the
[03:25:26.740 --> 03:25:32.620]  globalists to not exit the Euro because it would only worsen the crisis of
[03:25:32.620 --> 03:25:38.740]  confidence in the Euro. So this is what Bilderberg 2010 is going to be all about.
[03:25:38.740 --> 03:25:43.220]  How do we save the Euro? Because everybody's predicting that it's going to
[03:25:43.220 --> 03:25:48.220]  go to parity with the dollar and every time the central banks try and
[03:25:48.220 --> 03:25:53.540]  intervene and push the Euro back up again when it gets to that 121 level it
[03:25:53.540 --> 03:25:59.540]  just sinks straight back down again the next day. So I mean this is the Euro
[03:25:59.540 --> 03:26:05.540]  represents their entire agenda for a world currency. So if confidence is
[03:26:05.540 --> 03:26:11.940]  lost in the Euro then it proves that their claims that stability comes with
[03:26:11.940 --> 03:26:17.860]  unity are completely false. So it won't allow them to exploit the economic
[03:26:17.860 --> 03:26:22.740]  crisis which they created further to get their world government which is what
[03:26:22.740 --> 03:26:26.260]  they've called for. I want to go back to this article briefly you know these
[03:26:26.260 --> 03:26:31.980]  little devils aren't gods they're I mean they're not in total control but I
[03:26:31.980 --> 03:26:35.500]  think they're basically playing both sides because I remember
[03:26:35.500 --> 03:26:38.940]  trial lateral commission documents from over 20 years ago where they were
[03:26:38.940 --> 03:26:43.340]  talking about building up a few competing global currencies and then
[03:26:43.340 --> 03:26:48.220]  letting them collapse to bring in the SDR. So these little devils could have a
[03:26:48.220 --> 03:26:51.580]  method of their madness where they're claiming they don't want the Euro to go
[03:26:51.580 --> 03:26:56.020]  belly up but that's actually a way to save the dollar and then roll it into an
[03:26:56.020 --> 03:27:03.260]  SDR. Well yeah if the if the crisis in confidence in fiat money became so bad
[03:27:03.260 --> 03:27:10.660]  then they would then try to exploit that crisis for a global currency based on
[03:27:10.660 --> 03:27:17.340]  SDRs but I don't see them doing that because from every indication they need
[03:27:17.340 --> 03:27:22.020]  to save the Euro because it represents their entire agenda but you're right I
[03:27:22.020 --> 03:27:26.500]  mean they create the economic crisis from the bubbles that they manufactured
[03:27:26.500 --> 03:27:32.140]  but it seems to be out of control and it seems that many even inside the
[03:27:32.140 --> 03:27:37.460]  globalist circles are concerned that the plunge happened too soon and too fast
[03:27:37.460 --> 03:27:42.420]  and now it threatens to wipe out some of the wealth of even those who were
[03:27:42.420 --> 03:27:49.100]  somewhat prepared for it but Bilderberg talking about prolonging a financial
[03:27:49.100 --> 03:27:53.940]  recession for another year but whether things are too far out of hand for them
[03:27:53.940 --> 03:28:00.220]  to adequately manage that situation remains to be seen so that will be what
[03:28:00.220 --> 03:28:05.660]  comes out of Bilderberg this year so we'll be watching for the different
[03:28:05.660 --> 03:28:10.720]  discussions that come out of the conference on that subject. Well I was
[03:28:10.720 --> 03:28:17.140]  reading US well at the time colony newspaper articles I have some books
[03:28:17.140 --> 03:28:22.180]  that are compendiums of newspaper articles and also captains accounts I
[03:28:22.180 --> 03:28:26.620]  was reading some naval accounts of Newfoundland and in areas of the East
[03:28:26.620 --> 03:28:31.540]  Coast on the US which was colonies at the time being robbed by pirates and
[03:28:31.540 --> 03:28:36.700]  would describe a ship of say 18 guns with maybe 60 pirates on it robbing a
[03:28:36.700 --> 03:28:45.380]  port with 2,000 sailors 500 guns huge ships and they even knew that the pirate
[03:28:45.380 --> 03:28:53.420]  ship in the case of this particular pirate captain was coming and they
[03:28:53.420 --> 03:28:57.940]  still just surrendered to them and it's the same thing that we're doing today
[03:28:57.940 --> 03:29:02.300]  we have this group of piratical new order people and if we just get the will
[03:29:02.300 --> 03:29:06.860]  to say no to them and the will to see through their flim flam of telling us
[03:29:06.860 --> 03:29:09.900]  there's no world government the banks aren't robbing us I mean if we just
[03:29:09.900 --> 03:29:14.380]  stand up and wake up we can brush them aside if we just decide to beat them I
[03:29:14.380 --> 03:29:20.300]  mean can 2,000 people in a town with hundreds of ships beat 60 people well
[03:29:20.300 --> 03:29:23.860]  of course we can I mean it's just complete cowardice Watson and it's the
[03:29:23.860 --> 03:29:30.420]  same parallel today that's right what we're slowly starting to turn the tide
[03:29:30.420 --> 03:29:34.740]  and you know getting anti-establishment candidates into office and that's what
[03:29:34.740 --> 03:29:39.220]  they're afraid of absolutely all right Watson we'll talk to you again next
[03:29:39.220 --> 03:29:43.380]  week be a video Skype joining us here on air I'll be popping in at least once

[03:34:25.180 --> 03:34:30.340]  kind of like Luke Skywalker's moisture evaporators and they'll be held to pay
[03:34:30.340 --> 03:34:35.060]  of those units aren't fixed in the South Range but to be serious it grabs

[03:35:56.860 --> 03:36:00.980]  station when he still had his cell phone an Oxford University graduate
[03:36:00.980 --> 03:36:07.500]  journalist for the evening standard the Guardian he also writes satire and has
[03:36:07.500 --> 03:36:10.620]  written quite a few books and we'll give you his website before he leaves us
[03:36:10.620 --> 03:36:17.500]  he's on TV shows on Channel 4 reality TV and BBC one and of course in 2009 he
[03:36:17.500 --> 03:36:20.860]  covered the secret of Bilderberg group he went to basically write satire about
[03:36:20.860 --> 03:36:24.220]  it as a joke but found out it wasn't a joke and he also writes for the London
[03:36:24.220 --> 03:36:30.140]  Guardian he joins us now from Spain outside the the Bilderberg group resort
[03:36:30.140 --> 03:36:33.540]  that they shut down today so so first off Charlie good to have you back this

[03:36:42.420 --> 03:36:47.060]  I'm we we spent a couple of nights in the hotel a little bit cheekily before
[03:36:47.060 --> 03:36:54.380]  before lockdown which took place at noon today and you know basically all the
[03:36:54.380 --> 03:36:58.460]  guests left over the last few days because they had obviously they have the
[03:36:58.460 --> 03:37:02.420]  Bilderberg block booking and they're replaced by or the conference
[03:37:02.420 --> 03:37:08.980]  organizers who are up to their up to their ears isn't it and more and more
[03:37:08.980 --> 03:37:13.900]  security men who are just piling in at the moment and and the police are piling
[03:37:13.900 --> 03:37:18.820]  in and police helicopters are taking to the skies and it's the same old thing
[03:37:18.820 --> 03:37:24.300]  you know I mean it feels very much like foodiechmania in Greece last year it in
[03:37:24.300 --> 03:37:28.140]  fact the hotel was very similar it's up on a hill you know there's a small as a
[03:37:28.140 --> 03:37:31.420]  small little row that leads up to it and it's just by the seaside and you know
[03:37:31.420 --> 03:37:36.940]  it's a small little sleepy town and the supreme leaders up in their citadel
[03:37:36.940 --> 03:37:43.740]  above the rabble scum very much that is exactly what is happening and you know
[03:37:43.740 --> 03:37:50.300]  this and the same the same dynamic of a very few I mean more this year but a few
[03:37:50.300 --> 03:37:56.460]  people coming to bear witness to the event pathetic rabble down beneath the
[03:37:56.460 --> 03:38:03.380]  walls with our centurions keeping it close eye on the dangerous scallywags
[03:38:03.380 --> 03:38:09.220]  there's quite a lot of actually we and we have a well we have heard a few
[03:38:09.220 --> 03:38:16.420]  conversations and we have a source in the conference team as well and well
[03:38:16.420 --> 03:38:20.420]  that's big news you have a source inside the conference team you were in there and
[03:38:20.420 --> 03:38:24.420]  overheard so just like when I was in I can back this up when I was in Canada but
[03:38:24.420 --> 03:38:28.180]  but really in Virginia I was in there the day they shut it down and kind of
[03:38:28.180 --> 03:38:30.620]  stayed till the end until they were trying to throw us out and there were
[03:38:30.620 --> 03:38:35.260]  like security teams and I was you know catching all of it and every spare room
[03:38:35.260 --> 03:38:39.620]  and an office area was packed full of security people tell us as much as you
[03:38:39.620 --> 03:38:42.980]  can about the source without revealing them and tell us what you overheard Mr.
[03:38:42.980 --> 03:38:45.660]  Skelton well I can't tell you anything I'm not gonna tell you anything about the
[03:38:45.660 --> 03:38:50.340]  source but it will tell you some interesting things one of them is that
[03:38:50.340 --> 03:38:57.420]  there's a no-fly zone for four days over the hotel and that's being enforced
[03:38:57.420 --> 03:39:03.860]  by police helicopters and that begins at 8 a.m. tomorrow which is the first
[03:39:03.860 --> 03:39:09.940]  official day of the conference so you know I mean we spoke actually just we
[03:39:09.940 --> 03:39:16.500]  spoke to a barman and not a barman a barman and then he was he was we were
[03:39:16.500 --> 03:39:19.180]  talking about the cost of this whole thing and he just said look you do not
[03:39:19.180 --> 03:39:22.780]  want to know how much this is costing and you know when you think of that I
[03:39:22.780 --> 03:39:26.500]  can't quite get past it in my mind this the sheer cost of this operation it is
[03:39:26.500 --> 03:39:31.620]  huge and if anyone thinks that it's not a large event it is I've never seen
[03:39:31.620 --> 03:39:35.660]  anything like it and you know it's and of course the taxpayers pay with our tax
[03:39:35.660 --> 03:39:41.860]  money to protect the criminal rulers and and to be honest I don't think the
[03:39:41.860 --> 03:39:46.540]  Spanish taxpayers payers are in any position to be to be paying for this
[03:39:46.540 --> 03:39:49.980]  kind of circus right now listen we're gonna know more as the days develop and
[03:39:49.980 --> 03:39:53.060]  as you talk to journalists in your source but I mean what can you tell me
[03:39:53.060 --> 03:39:56.620]  about what you overheard what can you tell me about what the source told you
[03:39:56.620 --> 03:40:02.380]  well I can confirm some delegates who are coming um you know I mean some of
[03:40:02.380 --> 03:40:06.420]  them they they tend to come every year with this Richard Holbrook the Obama
[03:40:06.420 --> 03:40:12.620]  special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan he'll be there general
[03:40:12.620 --> 03:40:18.820]  Jack Keane who I think he was in charge of your your army at some point for some
[03:40:18.820 --> 03:40:24.020]  years and interesting a new name I think which is Marcus Agius or Agius who's
[03:40:24.020 --> 03:40:30.500]  chairman of Barclays and he's also senior non-executive director on the new
[03:40:30.500 --> 03:40:36.460]  BBC executive board so it's interesting that the BBC may not be here covering the
[03:40:36.460 --> 03:40:41.060]  events live on the ground but they do have someone inside but actually I
[03:40:41.060 --> 03:40:46.660]  mustn't badmouth the BBC because they put me on the radio this morning on the
[03:40:46.660 --> 03:40:51.100]  beat on radio for the BBC on the radio BBC radio for today program and I had a
[03:40:51.100 --> 03:40:55.620]  nice chat and it wasn't you know you call this a loss of innocence last year
[03:40:55.620 --> 03:41:00.740]  because I mean you you weren't really expecting to be clapped in irons I really
[03:41:00.740 --> 03:41:04.900]  wasn't and I wasn't even expecting I wasn't quite expecting I didn't have
[03:41:04.900 --> 03:41:09.460]  any idea to notice what was going to happen at all and you know to find
[03:41:09.460 --> 03:41:16.900]  yourself in a completely dystopian reality and with you know an extraordinary
[03:41:16.900 --> 03:41:21.740]  overreaction of yeah let's recap for those that forgot what happened last
[03:41:21.740 --> 03:41:25.940]  year to a London Guardian reporter you got video of it being followed harassed
[03:41:25.940 --> 03:41:29.660]  arrested there'd be police all around you and you'd say stop following me and
[03:41:29.660 --> 03:41:33.460]  they'd say no one's following you and you go to the police station to complain and
[03:41:33.460 --> 03:41:36.700]  then you see the guys that have been following you there and they say you're
[03:41:36.700 --> 03:41:40.340]  not seeing any of that sir you're you're quite insane and then they finally did
[03:41:40.340 --> 03:41:45.460]  arrest you so so recap that and let's go back to you know this first look at
[03:41:45.460 --> 03:41:51.420]  Bilderberg 2010 and the valuable intel you've already ferreted out well 2009 was
[03:41:51.420 --> 03:41:56.700]  yeah most my suppose my loss of loss of innocence and yeah I mean I you know I
[03:41:56.700 --> 03:42:00.940]  sat there in the you know in the asset I had to run away to assets because I was
[03:42:00.940 --> 03:42:04.260]  being chased around and arrested so much in Puyoq Mani and I really wasn't
[03:42:04.260 --> 03:42:07.140]  trying to do anything at all and you know you described me early on as a
[03:42:07.140 --> 03:42:11.340]  daring reporter you know that couldn't be further from the truth I was I spent
[03:42:11.340 --> 03:42:17.740]  all of 2009 trying not to get arrested and you know my plan for 2010 is very
[03:42:17.740 --> 03:42:22.060]  much along the same lines not get arrested but you know last year I sat in
[03:42:22.060 --> 03:42:27.660]  an office in Athens opposite you know he was pro I think he was the head of the
[03:42:27.660 --> 03:42:34.260]  of the Athens state police that look after the parliament and after their
[03:42:34.260 --> 03:42:38.300]  government so very high up and you know I said look I've worked out I realized
[03:42:38.300 --> 03:42:41.940]  who's been following me it is you it's your team I've seen the guy in the loo
[03:42:41.940 --> 03:42:45.820]  just now weirdly and having been denied all the way along and he just said no
[03:42:45.820 --> 03:42:49.100]  you didn't see a man you didn't see a man and you know I sat there and I thought
[03:42:49.100 --> 03:42:53.180]  my god I mean that's a scene from a movie you don't you don't want to be
[03:42:53.180 --> 03:42:56.260]  sitting opposite someone telling you you haven't seen what you've just seen
[03:42:56.260 --> 03:43:00.100]  because it makes you think you know that you know you're gonna start seeing
[03:43:00.100 --> 03:43:04.220]  ones and zeros and and the matrix will melt away and you think you know
[03:43:04.220 --> 03:43:08.180]  whatever you it's very unsettling but that's their psychological I mean they've
[03:43:08.180 --> 03:43:12.100]  got Von Rumpi Brown all of them announcing world government run by the
[03:43:12.100 --> 03:43:14.900]  bankers that have engineered the financial collapse we have their
[03:43:14.900 --> 03:43:18.460]  documents from over a decade ago planning this and then they'll announce
[03:43:18.460 --> 03:43:22.020]  world government and then say but we're not setting up a world government and
[03:43:22.020 --> 03:43:27.620]  you're quite insane if you believe in one I'm afraid it doesn't exist
[03:43:27.620 --> 03:43:35.140]  look I mean I'm sick of it you know you give I'm sick of ringing up you know
[03:43:35.140 --> 03:43:39.620]  reputable news agencies and I'm not gonna name any names and speaking to you
[03:43:39.620 --> 03:43:43.020]  know people who work on their foreign news desk and you know and you say well
[03:43:43.020 --> 03:43:47.620]  I'm here in Spain covering the Bilderberg conference and they go the what and
[03:43:47.620 --> 03:43:53.220]  you know I'm thinking this is a big deal it really is a big deal if you had 150
[03:43:53.220 --> 03:43:57.420]  you've all heard it before top football players meeting in secret there'd be 50
[03:43:57.420 --> 03:44:01.420]  helicopters above and a thousand press if you had 150 top Hollywood stars
[03:44:01.420 --> 03:44:05.540]  meeting in secret and they've been doing it since 54 you'd have a thousand
[03:44:05.540 --> 03:44:10.700]  helicopters and 5,000 press but with this it's just oh you don't see those
[03:44:10.700 --> 03:44:14.580]  black sedans pulling in you don't see the trips with machine guns you don't see
[03:44:14.580 --> 03:44:24.860]  police dogs you know what I don't have a problem with a bunch of financiers and
[03:44:24.860 --> 03:44:29.700]  business people getting together to meet up to determine how to flee you know me
[03:44:29.700 --> 03:44:35.420]  and and whoever or to tell me whatever mobile phone or anything I don't care
[03:44:35.420 --> 03:44:39.340]  they can they can they can strategize to their heart's content but you know we've
[03:44:39.340 --> 03:44:45.540]  got a new coalition in Britain and what David Cameron and who's a ex Bilderberg
[03:44:45.540 --> 03:44:51.180]  and Nick Clegg like to talk about the moment is transparency and openness and
[03:44:51.180 --> 03:44:54.420]  they want that in our politics you know that they you know whatever they will
[03:44:54.420 --> 03:44:57.500]  let's find out whether that's the case but they do keep saying we want
[03:44:57.500 --> 03:45:00.980]  transparency and we want open them well that's like Obama he said he's gonna be
[03:45:00.980 --> 03:45:04.900]  the most transparent he's more secretive than Bush it's always the opposite with
[03:45:04.900 --> 03:45:10.340]  these guys when they tell you something yeah it would be nice if in the
[03:45:10.340 --> 03:45:15.700]  spirits of openness and transparency we simply knew which elected officials
[03:45:15.700 --> 03:45:22.820]  went to this four-day meeting and what they talked about in terms of policy
[03:45:22.820 --> 03:45:26.540]  because they are setting policy in there and it's against the law in the US the
[03:45:26.540 --> 03:45:30.500]  Logan Act how did you hear about Daniel Estel and testifying before the European
[03:45:30.500 --> 03:45:35.340]  Parliament I did know I did yes extraordinary so so what's your take on
[03:45:35.340 --> 03:45:39.780]  that direction you know I mean it's being talked about the word is being you
[03:45:39.780 --> 03:45:42.940]  know the word is being talked about and normalized and you just want people to
[03:45:42.940 --> 03:45:47.180]  go you know when people talk about the Bilderberg conspiracy it's not I keep
[03:45:47.180 --> 03:45:51.020]  saying it's not a conspiracy it's a meeting it's a conference it's a four-day
[03:45:51.020 --> 03:45:57.420]  policy they put that that oh what's the right term that stereotype on it they
[03:45:57.420 --> 03:46:00.660]  put it on you you're like hey there's rich elite you know they're robbing us
[03:46:00.660 --> 03:46:03.580]  through the banking system you know they're meeting in there we've gotten
[03:46:03.580 --> 03:46:07.100]  their minutes and they just go oh you didn't take your medication it's just a
[03:46:07.100 --> 03:46:11.340]  way to disregard what you're saying and always make the debate about whether it
[03:46:11.340 --> 03:46:15.820]  exists or not instead of having a debate about should these private bankers be
[03:46:15.820 --> 03:46:21.860]  setting up a global police state to fully extract all our wealth from us that's
[03:46:21.860 --> 03:46:28.660]  exactly it I'm so I am so sick of every time you one mentions any kind of you
[03:46:28.660 --> 03:46:32.100]  know I don't know what's called geo machinations or any kind of global
[03:46:32.100 --> 03:46:40.140]  strategy or any you talk about any kind of large you know large financial stroke
[03:46:40.140 --> 03:46:43.420]  economic military industrial whatever you want to call it you start talking in
[03:46:43.420 --> 03:46:48.300]  those terms and you get told oh you put on your tin hat and you know what I'm so
[03:46:48.300 --> 03:46:52.420]  forward to the back teeth of that and that's just a rationalization Hitler
[03:46:52.420 --> 03:46:56.300]  and gerbils both said good propaganda is simple and mindless and speaks to
[03:46:56.300 --> 03:46:59.860]  people's own laziness well guess what folks the banks are imploding the
[03:46:59.860 --> 03:47:03.100]  economy they are setting up a world government you can read Charlie
[03:47:03.100 --> 03:47:07.020]  Skelton's great columns at the Linden Guardian while he's there reporting and
[03:47:07.020 --> 03:47:11.300]  we'll put that up on screen on TV for folks you can also go to his website I
[03:47:11.300 --> 03:47:15.180]  tell us the best ways to read your reportage while you're there in Spain
[03:47:15.180 --> 03:47:22.180]  covering our owners well go to the Guardian website if you just go to
[03:47:22.180 --> 03:47:28.020]  guardian.co.uk you will I'm sure find me somewhere put it put in the word
[03:47:28.020 --> 03:47:32.100]  Bilderberg yeah Charlie Skelton Bilderberg it's all over the place now
[03:47:32.100 --> 03:47:35.420]  now expanding on this because I I segued into what happened to you last year
[03:47:35.420 --> 03:47:39.220]  what type of security are you saying what's some of the other intel you picked
[03:47:39.220 --> 03:47:44.140]  up from inside the club Bilderberg well it's just the securities you know it's
[03:47:44.140 --> 03:47:49.620]  it's the same it's the same thing it's absolutely immense you know there are
[03:47:49.620 --> 03:47:56.780]  just dozens and dozens of police cars there are dozens and dozens of riot
[03:47:56.780 --> 03:48:02.740]  police vans I mean they are kicking themselves up as if they're about to
[03:48:02.740 --> 03:48:07.540]  be attacked by you know a hundred thousand heavily armed troops whereas in
[03:48:07.540 --> 03:48:14.980]  fact there are you know there's maybe two dozen you know very nice kind people
[03:48:14.980 --> 03:48:18.780]  sitting outside who are a little bit clued up who's sitting outside this
[03:48:18.780 --> 03:48:23.380]  court this police cordon just saying you know I'm not quite sure that what is
[03:48:23.380 --> 03:48:27.860]  going on up the hill is exactly right I'm not quite sure that people up there
[03:48:27.860 --> 03:48:32.260]  is strategizing in my interest or in fact in the interest of the majority of
[03:48:32.260 --> 03:48:36.220]  human beings on the planet and you know and they're there and they're they're
[03:48:36.220 --> 03:48:40.300]  saying the little thing and they're holding their signs and and you know a
[03:48:40.300 --> 03:48:46.420]  few meters away are people that you know machine guns and and and you know
[03:48:46.420 --> 03:48:50.340]  police helicopter circle ahead and you just think what exactly are they
[03:48:50.340 --> 03:48:55.020]  expecting I mean seriously who are they expecting to come running up that hill
[03:48:55.020 --> 03:48:58.860]  well they know they're identified and they know we're looking at them and
[03:48:58.860 --> 03:49:03.620]  they can't be happy that ten years ago you'd see no news about Bilderberg now
[03:49:03.620 --> 03:49:07.140]  you Google the term there are hundreds of articles a day in prestigious
[03:49:07.140 --> 03:49:10.580]  publications admitting Queen of the Netherlands Prince of Holland
[03:49:10.580 --> 03:49:15.020]  representatives of the British royalty the Spanish royalty they're all there
[03:49:15.020 --> 03:49:19.180]  and people are going wow there really is an elite and how dumb we were to be
[03:49:19.180 --> 03:49:26.220]  told no children you know you know the elites don't exist you know Spain doesn't
[03:49:26.220 --> 03:49:31.540]  exist Sages doesn't exist you know the city they're meeting in none of that
[03:49:31.540 --> 03:49:38.060]  exists go back to sleep the bankers love you yeah they don't love it you know
[03:49:38.060 --> 03:49:41.180]  they don't love it they don't even they barely hate it I think they just treat
[03:49:41.180 --> 03:49:45.460]  us as ones and zeros now this source in the hotel what are they saying they're
[03:49:45.460 --> 03:49:49.300]  gonna help you get info throughout the con with the conference no I think
[03:49:49.300 --> 03:49:53.940]  that's closed up it was it was purely why we were there in contact you know I
[03:49:53.940 --> 03:49:57.660]  mean you've got to understand the people running the conference there are all
[03:49:57.660 --> 03:50:00.220]  kinds of different people you know there are people who just simply there to put
[03:50:00.220 --> 03:50:04.860]  up the lighting rigs there are people there simply you know moving in crates
