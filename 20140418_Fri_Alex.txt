[00:00.000 --> 00:10.280]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.280 --> 00:11.280]  You want answers?
[00:11.280 --> 00:17.600]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.600 --> 00:22.360]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.360 --> 00:26.440]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:26.440 --> 00:29.040]  I'm David Knight and I'll be your host today.
[00:29.040 --> 00:32.440]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour and we're going
[00:32.440 --> 00:35.960]  to be discussing Harry Reid's comments about domestic terrorists.
[00:35.960 --> 00:38.520]  Who are the real terrorists?
[00:38.520 --> 00:40.320]  What is the real law going on here?
[00:40.320 --> 00:41.600]  We're going to have that discussion.
[00:41.600 --> 00:43.080]  It's good that this is out in the open.
[00:43.080 --> 00:46.480]  It's good that we're seeing where people are falling, on which side they're falling.
[00:46.480 --> 00:49.720]  It's good to see the mainstream media having this discussion and we're going to talk about
[00:49.720 --> 00:55.000]  what some people who have identified themselves as alternative media are saying about this,
[00:55.000 --> 00:57.320]  like Glenn Beck, for example.
[00:57.320 --> 01:02.200]  Alex Jones is also going to be joining us later in the show and we've got some updates
[01:02.200 --> 01:05.560]  on the Bundy Ranch as well as people now trying to dissect this.
[01:05.560 --> 01:11.000]  Like I said, we've now got some comments from Rand Paul and others, some excellent comments
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.720]  from Judge Napolitano.
[01:12.720 --> 01:18.960]  He's been on target on this from the very beginning, saying things like, this is a legal case.
[01:18.960 --> 01:23.160]  If they went in court, then they get a lien and then when the guy dies, they take his
[01:23.160 --> 01:28.160]  property or when he sells it, they take his property, you don't send an army in.
[01:28.160 --> 01:31.080]  And that's the battle right now in the Info War.
[01:31.080 --> 01:35.920]  We've got people like Glenn Beck and the mainstream media who are doing everything they can to
[01:35.920 --> 01:41.920]  portray this as an act of aggression by people who peacefully stood up to tyranny that had
[01:41.920 --> 01:44.840]  been going on for over a week.
[01:44.840 --> 01:49.920]  Just this case has been going on for decades, but the army that went down there, that was
[01:49.920 --> 01:53.880]  really, really escalating just before we got down there to file a report.
[01:53.880 --> 01:58.360]  So of course, as you've seen, they attacked people with tasers, with canine dogs.
[01:58.360 --> 02:02.560]  They came up behind a woman, threw her down from behind, okay?
[02:02.560 --> 02:06.160]  They're beating people up and we're seeing this happening everywhere.
[02:06.160 --> 02:08.040]  This is what liberals need to understand.
[02:08.040 --> 02:09.720]  This is not about the cattle.
[02:09.720 --> 02:13.760]  This isn't about white people versus color people or people of color white.
[02:13.760 --> 02:15.480]  This is not about any of those things.
[02:15.480 --> 02:16.960]  This isn't about a rich rancher.
[02:16.960 --> 02:18.360]  He's not rich.
[02:18.360 --> 02:20.600]  It's not about Mormons versus other people.
[02:20.600 --> 02:25.760]  Everybody's throwing in all of these personal issues to try to attack them because of whatever
[02:25.760 --> 02:27.400]  group they're involved in.
[02:27.400 --> 02:28.720]  It's not about that.
[02:28.720 --> 02:36.400]  We cover stories all the time about people of every age, race, sex, color, whatever.
[02:36.400 --> 02:42.200]  Being attacked by the government, being killed by the government who are never, and the agents
[02:42.200 --> 02:46.480]  who do this, the law enforcement people who do this are never brought to heel over this.
[02:46.480 --> 02:49.600]  This is out of control and this is what's changing.
[02:49.600 --> 02:51.000]  This is what it was about.
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.200]  It was about facing down tyranny and we have to have this discussion.
[02:55.200 --> 02:57.200]  We need to talk about who the real terrorists are.
[02:57.200 --> 02:58.480]  We're going to talk about that.
[02:58.480 --> 03:01.440]  We're also going to talk about some other interesting things that are happening.
[03:01.440 --> 03:07.440]  Now, as this is going on this last week, we had the income tax took place, okay, on federal
[03:07.440 --> 03:10.360]  forms were filled out and I thought it was very interesting.
[03:10.360 --> 03:14.200]  We didn't have time to cover this because so much was happening in Nevada.
[03:14.200 --> 03:19.200]  But the Donald Rumsfeld letter that came out that everybody was talking about, he said,
[03:19.200 --> 03:24.480]  every year he writes a letter to the IRS and says, my taxes are a known unknown, as only
[03:24.480 --> 03:26.640]  Donald Rumsfeld can put it.
[03:26.640 --> 03:30.920]  He sends a letter every year and says, I really have no idea what's in this.
[03:30.920 --> 03:36.960]  It's a very complicated situation and he feels uncomfortable essentially signing his name
[03:36.960 --> 03:42.280]  to a declaration that can be used to say that he created perjury.
[03:42.280 --> 03:43.760]  That's what a lot of people have said.
[03:43.760 --> 03:44.840]  I always had that problem.
[03:44.840 --> 03:49.600]  I never sent him a letter like that because I wasn't Donald Rumsfeld.
[03:49.600 --> 03:52.280]  He's pretty much inoculated against being prosecuted.
[03:52.280 --> 03:58.200]  It wouldn't be ironic if Donald Rumsfeld became the leader of a tax protest movement if everybody
[03:58.200 --> 04:01.760]  were to fill that up because they don't like it if you don't fill it out.
[04:01.760 --> 04:06.080]  They've had an airline pilot who had no complications in his tax form.
[04:06.080 --> 04:08.960]  He merely had wages and he refused to sign it.
[04:08.960 --> 04:10.880]  They took him to court because he refused to sign it.
[04:10.880 --> 04:13.240]  He said, you're requiring me to do self-incrimination.
[04:13.240 --> 04:17.920]  Well, of course, there's a lot of things that the IRS is being used for nowadays and used
[04:17.920 --> 04:18.920]  openly.
[04:18.920 --> 04:23.200]  They were always used to punish political enemies of both Democrats and Republicans.
[04:23.200 --> 04:29.360]  That is why they're reluctant really to do anything about the IRS being openly used to
[04:29.360 --> 04:30.680]  attack Tea Party members.
[04:30.680 --> 04:32.880]  They want that power when they get back in.
[04:32.880 --> 04:33.880]  That's what the Republicans want.
[04:33.880 --> 04:37.160]  They want to try to score some political points, but they want the power when they come back.
[04:37.160 --> 04:38.720]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[04:38.720 --> 04:44.920]  We also have reports from the New York Times that an American bank had a plane that landed
[04:44.920 --> 04:46.320]  in Tehran.
[04:46.320 --> 04:49.680]  And the American government and the Iranian government is not talking about this, but
[04:49.680 --> 04:53.080]  as we had on InfoWars today, bankers are behind the war.
[04:53.080 --> 04:55.240]  The story from Naomi Prince, who was just on the show yesterday.
[04:55.240 --> 04:56.900]  We're going to be right back.
[04:56.900 --> 05:00.400]  Your calls also on the Bundy Ranch.
[05:00.400 --> 05:03.840]  The global social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[05:03.840 --> 05:06.280]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[05:06.280 --> 05:11.400]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and
[05:11.400 --> 05:14.920]  other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[05:14.920 --> 05:19.200]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed
[05:19.200 --> 05:26.680]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful
[05:26.680 --> 05:31.600]  organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[05:31.600 --> 05:37.120]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[05:37.120 --> 05:39.600]  of using synthetic chemicals.
[05:39.600 --> 05:44.920]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended
[05:44.920 --> 05:45.920]  dose.

[06:00.480 --> 06:04.680]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[06:04.680 --> 06:09.080]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[06:09.080 --> 06:12.640]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[06:12.640 --> 06:15.600]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[06:15.600 --> 06:19.520]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[06:19.520 --> 06:23.200]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[06:23.200 --> 06:27.160]  On average, the county said it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[06:27.160 --> 06:31.760]  A few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[06:31.760 --> 06:36.760]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[06:36.760 --> 06:41.400]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in breads, it's in toothpaste.
[06:41.400 --> 06:44.240]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[06:44.240 --> 06:45.800]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[06:45.800 --> 06:47.160]  It's time to take action.
[06:47.160 --> 06:49.160]  It's time to filter our water.

[08:27.200 --> 08:33.560]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, April 18th, 2014.
[08:33.560 --> 08:36.880]  Good Friday and we've got a big report here.
[08:36.880 --> 08:41.440]  There's a breaking story, very important story that's just went up on InfoWars White House
[08:41.440 --> 08:47.440]  counter-terror chief from Homeland Security that's Lisa Monaco is saying that confrontational
[08:47.440 --> 08:49.200]  children could be terrorists.
[08:49.200 --> 08:53.880]  She's warning parents and telling them to watch their kids, presumably if they see their
[08:53.880 --> 08:59.160]  kids do something and maybe be a little bit rebellious, maybe they ought to call Homeland
[08:59.160 --> 09:00.160]  Security.
[09:00.160 --> 09:04.480]  You know, see something, say something to a whole new level.
[09:04.480 --> 09:06.440]  And Alex Jones has a breaking report on that.
[09:06.440 --> 09:08.240]  I've got Alex on the phone right now.
[09:08.240 --> 09:09.240]  We're going to play his report.
[09:09.240 --> 09:10.680]  Alex, what do you make of this?
[09:10.680 --> 09:15.640]  Well, there's two things that go together and this is the biggest day of broadcast we've
[09:15.640 --> 09:16.640]  ever done.
[09:16.640 --> 09:20.680]  This is the most important issue we've ever covered concerning this Republic.
[09:20.680 --> 09:21.680]  History repeats itself.
[09:21.680 --> 09:25.680]  I've studied the globalist, I've studied the Homeland Security system.
[09:25.680 --> 09:27.240]  We were the first to break all this.
[09:27.240 --> 09:28.240]  I'm not bragging.
[09:28.240 --> 09:33.320]  I'm saying, people, you'll listen to me very carefully because now everything is two inches
[09:33.320 --> 09:37.200]  away from our face, not 20 miles away over the horizon.
[09:37.200 --> 09:38.880]  This is happening now.
[09:38.880 --> 09:40.960]  We have the video coming up.
[09:40.960 --> 09:47.920]  It's up on InfoWars.com and Paul Watson's article that's the top featured story from
[09:47.920 --> 09:54.360]  last night titled, Harry Reid Says Bundy Protesters Are Domestic Terrorist.
[09:54.360 --> 09:59.360]  We're going to be playing that video when Paul Watson comes up at the bottom of the
[09:59.360 --> 10:01.320]  hour to break all this down.
[10:01.320 --> 10:05.520]  He says that we wanted to kill women and children by putting them up front.
[10:05.520 --> 10:09.120]  No, that's what the feds did when they bombed Oklahoma City with the Daycare Center.
[10:09.120 --> 10:14.360]  He says twice they're domestic terrorists and he's working with the FBI to go after
[10:14.360 --> 10:15.360]  them.
[10:15.360 --> 10:21.520]  We have the White House Chief of Counterterrorism, a known complete globalist socialist, openly
[10:21.520 --> 10:26.520]  saying that your children may be terrorists if they literally throw a toy.
[10:26.520 --> 10:28.200]  Now, people say this sounds crazy.
[10:28.200 --> 10:29.200]  This sounds funny.
[10:29.200 --> 10:30.200]  No, it's not funny.
[10:30.200 --> 10:33.960]  They arrest kids for Nerf guns at school the teacher tells them to bring.
[10:33.960 --> 10:37.600]  They arrest kids if they draw a picture of their dad who's in the Marine Corps.
[10:37.600 --> 10:42.080]  They're training everyone for thought police where you will be disappeared.
[10:42.080 --> 10:44.840]  This is an authoritarian psych warfare program.
[10:44.840 --> 10:46.800]  These are not environmentalist wackos.
[10:46.800 --> 10:47.800]  They're using it to take over.
[10:47.800 --> 10:49.760]  This is not a failed drug war.
[10:49.760 --> 10:50.760]  They ship the drugs in.
[10:50.760 --> 10:55.200]  This is not a failed, whacked out woman just demonizing our opposition.
[10:55.200 --> 10:58.960]  This is scientific saying trust no one but the state.
[10:58.960 --> 11:05.120]  Walmart has telescreens across the country saying don't trust anyone but Homeland Security.
[11:05.120 --> 11:09.480]  Terrorists may be everywhere while the government openly funds Al Qaeda to attack nations like
[11:09.480 --> 11:10.480]  Syria.
[11:10.480 --> 11:11.840]  It is totally naked.
[11:11.840 --> 11:17.600]  They think you're that stupid ladies and gentlemen to in 24 hours she went on television.
[11:17.600 --> 11:19.280]  We have that clip coming up as well.
[11:19.280 --> 11:24.280]  It's at the bottom of the article where she says and she gave another speech at Harvard
[11:24.280 --> 11:30.640]  repeating the same thing saying seriously that hey, your kids may be terrorists.
[11:30.640 --> 11:31.640]  Everyone's a terrorist.
[11:31.640 --> 11:34.960]  Everyone's a terrorist but the real terrorists that took over America.
[11:34.960 --> 11:37.080]  I'm going to say this very slowly.
[11:37.080 --> 11:39.880]  It's not rhetoric, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:39.880 --> 11:44.360]  This is an occupation global foreign banking government.
[11:44.360 --> 11:46.600]  Homeland Security has been to absorb the old republic.
[11:46.600 --> 11:49.160]  My God folks, Homeland Security is a Nazi term.
[11:49.160 --> 11:50.760]  It's the uniforms, all of it.
[11:50.760 --> 11:51.920]  It's totally naked.
[11:51.920 --> 11:53.800]  The armored vehicles being deployed.
[11:53.800 --> 11:58.840]  They want to start a civil war before the full depression hits to blame the depression on
[11:58.840 --> 12:04.320]  the civil war, to blame a war in Ukraine on the depression.
[12:04.320 --> 12:14.800]  I've been telling everyone this for six years every day I know the enemy, the enemy right,
[12:14.800 --> 12:17.960]  the enemy right's public manuals admitting all this.
[12:17.960 --> 12:19.480]  So we're going to go to my special report.
[12:19.480 --> 12:21.160]  David Knight's going to cover it.
[12:21.160 --> 12:22.320]  Everyone's going to cover it.
[12:22.320 --> 12:28.640]  We've got to get on the, we've got to get on the offensive right now and let the globalists
[12:28.640 --> 12:30.600]  know that we understand their plan.
[12:30.600 --> 12:32.840]  We've got to stop a shootout with the feds.
[12:32.840 --> 12:34.720]  We've got to stop a civil war.
[12:34.720 --> 12:36.440]  We've got to stop a civil war.
[12:36.440 --> 12:41.280]  We've got to expose their paradigm as they try to play us off against each other like
[12:41.280 --> 12:42.720]  two Siamese fighting fish.
[12:42.720 --> 12:45.120]  I'm going to hand things over to you, David Knight.
[12:45.120 --> 12:48.520]  We'll play my report and then Paul Watson is coming up.
[12:48.520 --> 12:52.920]  This is what zero tolerance is about, teaching us all that we're terrorists who can be disappeared
[12:52.920 --> 12:53.920]  under the NDAA.
[12:53.920 --> 12:59.720]  This is their attempt to flip the script, to flip the script from saying it's al-Qaeda
[12:59.720 --> 13:00.720]  to it's all of us.
[13:00.720 --> 13:05.600]  This is the criminal rogue government armed to the teeth against us, belligerently saying
[13:05.600 --> 13:10.520]  you will go in your free speech zones, you will shut up, or we will arrest you for terrorism.
[13:10.520 --> 13:12.320]  This is the new world order takeover.
[13:12.320 --> 13:17.400]  This proves everything I ever said, ladies and gentlemen, this is a maximum red alert
[13:17.400 --> 13:21.520]  to call Congress, to call everybody, to call talk radio.
[13:21.520 --> 13:25.240]  That's why Glenn Beck is scared to now saying anybody who opposes or criticizes the government
[13:25.240 --> 13:28.680]  to terrorists because he said three years ago they're going to bomb stuff and blame
[13:28.680 --> 13:33.600]  it on the liberty movement like Oklahoma City and he showed their own documents on Fox News.
[13:33.600 --> 13:38.320]  He knows a lot of people are going to get scared now and join with the new world order
[13:38.320 --> 13:43.000]  out of fear because they're going to stage false flags and blame it on us unless we
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.360]  maximum expose this right now and call the media, call the system, get on the streets
[13:48.360 --> 13:51.440]  everywhere and let people know that we're aware of what they're doing.
[13:51.440 --> 13:55.320]  When there is a false flag, you've got to run to the false flag with your video cameras
[13:55.320 --> 14:00.000]  because the feds and the globalists are so swampy, you will probably see them literally
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.160]  running out with the bombs and things like at Oklahoma City.
[14:03.160 --> 14:05.640]  We're going to get their names just like the underwear bomber.
[14:05.640 --> 14:06.640]  That was the CIA.
[14:06.640 --> 14:07.640]  Our witnesses were correct.
[14:07.640 --> 14:10.040]  We're going to get the names like the Boston bombing.
[14:10.040 --> 14:12.480]  We are going to expose what they're doing.
[14:12.480 --> 14:13.880]  God bless you, David Knight.
[14:13.880 --> 14:15.600]  We'll be covering it Sunday as well.
[14:15.600 --> 14:19.400]  This is a maximum issue as they announced that we are all terrorists.
[14:19.400 --> 14:23.000]  We are all suspects except for the out of control government run by foreign banks.
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.400]  David Knight, thank you very much.
[14:24.400 --> 14:26.040]  Absolutely right, Alex.
[14:26.040 --> 14:28.960]  That's why it was so imperative that we be there.
[14:28.960 --> 14:31.480]  That's why we weren't shooting pictures from the overpass.
[14:31.480 --> 14:33.800]  We have to see what's going on.
[14:33.800 --> 14:38.600]  People needed to see that the narrative that they're putting out there now about us strategizing
[14:38.600 --> 14:42.920]  to put women and children out front, Sheriff Mack is now backed off of that.
[14:42.920 --> 14:44.040]  He says, I wasn't there.
[14:44.040 --> 14:45.720]  I didn't get there till after that happened.
[14:45.720 --> 14:48.040]  He was just talking about it afterwards.
[14:48.040 --> 14:49.360]  We have the video.
[14:49.360 --> 14:55.220]  We show that the people were not acting in a threatening way whatsoever.
[14:55.220 --> 14:59.200]  It was the SWAT teams on the other side that were pointing guns at us.
[14:59.200 --> 15:02.120]  It was a SWAT team as they had been all week.
[15:02.120 --> 15:06.360]  It was a SWAT team on the other side that continued to bark orders, leave the area or
[15:06.360 --> 15:07.560]  we will shoot.
[15:07.560 --> 15:10.400]  We will use lethal force.
[15:10.400 --> 15:11.560]  That's what was happening there.
[15:11.560 --> 15:17.120]  And yet you see Reuters, you see Glenn Beck trying to spend this into the fact that the
[15:17.120 --> 15:20.800]  only people that were carrying guns were the protesters.
[15:20.800 --> 15:21.800]  That was not the case.
[15:21.800 --> 15:25.440]  You can see that nobody on the front line had any guns.
[15:25.440 --> 15:27.280]  Nobody was doing anything threatening.
[15:27.280 --> 15:30.840]  If they had any guns, they were in holsters on their sides.
[15:30.840 --> 15:34.760]  The only person that I've seen, a picture of somebody was someone up on the overpass
[15:34.760 --> 15:36.840]  and they have run that over and over again.
[15:36.840 --> 15:37.840]  And guess what?
[15:37.840 --> 15:39.680]  Most of those pictures were aerial views.
[15:39.680 --> 15:42.160]  They were shooting from a helicopter.
[15:42.160 --> 15:45.000]  They had a no fly zone in the area.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.520]  Everybody was hopelessly outgunned.
[15:46.520 --> 15:49.480]  It wasn't, they didn't stand down because they were outgunned.
[15:49.480 --> 15:51.280]  I'm glad there were people there that had guns.
[15:51.280 --> 15:53.360]  I'm glad there were people there that were backing us up.
[15:53.360 --> 15:54.440]  That's very important.
[15:54.440 --> 15:55.760]  We cannot lose that.
[15:55.760 --> 15:59.720]  That is a deterrence and it can be a peaceful deterrence just like nuclear weapons.
[15:59.720 --> 16:01.560]  But let's go while we still have time.
[16:01.560 --> 16:05.920]  Let's go to this, actually we don't have time to play it now, do we?
[16:05.920 --> 16:07.200]  We're going to have a commercial break.
[16:07.200 --> 16:08.480]  So let's finish up with this.
[16:08.480 --> 16:10.320]  We're going to play it right after the commercial break.
[16:10.320 --> 16:12.800]  We're going to go right into Alex Jones' report.
[16:12.800 --> 16:16.800]  I wanted to read this report from Reuters that's up on Drudge.
[16:16.800 --> 16:21.280]  After Nevada ranch standoff and bold and militia, ask where next?
[16:21.280 --> 16:27.760]  In other words, like the militia, these people who were there as peaceful civil rights protesters
[16:27.760 --> 16:30.080]  are somehow the problem.
[16:30.080 --> 16:31.960]  Listen to this first paragraph.
[16:31.960 --> 16:35.160]  Flat on his belly in a sniper position wearing a baseball cap and a flak jacket.
[16:35.160 --> 16:39.360]  A protester aimed his semi-automatic rifle from the edge of an overpass and waited as
[16:39.360 --> 16:43.880]  a crowd blows to its ground against U.S. federal agents from the Nevada desert.
[16:43.880 --> 16:46.200]  You read on and on and on on this article.
[16:46.200 --> 16:50.960]  There is no mention of the fact that the federal agents were armed.
[16:50.960 --> 16:54.420]  There's no mention of the fact that they were pointing guns at people there all week.
[16:54.420 --> 17:00.120]  There's no mention of the brutality that went on initiated by the federal government.
[17:00.120 --> 17:03.240]  Nobody that was there as a protester, nobody there that was watching what was going on
[17:03.240 --> 17:07.080]  and protesting it initiated any force against the federal government.
[17:07.080 --> 17:11.160]  But of course, you've got the Southern Poverty Law Center coming in and saying, laws I guess
[17:11.160 --> 17:14.160]  don't apply when the radical right doesn't agree with it.
[17:14.160 --> 17:19.440]  Well, we can have that discussion about what the laws are, but as Representative Stockman
[17:19.440 --> 17:25.640]  here in the U.S., sorry, in Texas, as well as U.S. Senator Rand Paul have both pointed
[17:25.640 --> 17:30.320]  out this kind of escalation is totally unwarranted.
[17:30.320 --> 17:35.600]  Representative Stockman pointed out that whenever the government has to use force to enforce
[17:35.600 --> 17:44.520]  an order, they have to use, on a contract basis, local law enforcement authority.
[17:44.520 --> 17:47.000]  They should have been using the Sheriff's Department if they were going to do that.
[17:47.000 --> 17:50.680]  They should not have brought in contract killers.
[17:50.680 --> 17:55.520]  And then the only time, the only time they mentioned that the federal government has
[17:55.520 --> 18:00.680]  weapons is way down in the article where they quote Alex Jones.
[18:00.680 --> 18:04.760]  They describe him as a radio host, anti-government conspiracy theorist who's popular right wing
[18:04.760 --> 18:09.040]  website, InfoWars, helped to popularize Monday's dispute, called it a watershed moment.
[18:09.040 --> 18:10.040]  And this is what Alex said.
[18:10.040 --> 18:15.000]  He said, Americans showed up with guns and said, no, you're not, before confronting
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.400]  armed BLM agents, only time in the piece that they're talking about the government agents
[18:20.400 --> 18:21.400]  being armed.
[18:21.400 --> 18:25.760]  Other than that, they're portrayed as peaceful bystanders who are just being set upon by
[18:25.760 --> 18:26.840]  an angry mob.
[18:26.840 --> 18:28.920]  That's the kind of distortion that they're putting out.
[18:28.920 --> 18:33.760]  But Alex went on and said, they said, shoot us, the protesters, that is, and they didn't.
[18:33.760 --> 18:34.760]  And that was epic.
[18:34.760 --> 18:36.320]  And it is going to happen more.
[18:36.320 --> 18:41.440]  I hope it will happen more because people need to wake up, especially people on the
[18:41.440 --> 18:42.440]  left.
[18:42.440 --> 18:47.240]  They're trying to make this about the, they're buying into the hate, they're buying into
[18:47.240 --> 18:51.960]  the group division, pitting one group against another because, as I said before, because
[18:51.960 --> 18:56.240]  of religion or because of race or whatever, it's not about that.
[18:56.240 --> 19:02.360]  We cover stories about an out of control government, about abusive authoritarian police state tactics
[19:02.360 --> 19:05.840]  and the fact that the government is never called to account about that.
[19:05.840 --> 19:10.480]  We cover those stories all the time, all over the, all over the country.
[19:10.480 --> 19:12.880]  Usually it's in a city where this is happening.
[19:12.880 --> 19:18.320]  Usually it's to black people, you know, and we cover that and we need to wake up and we
[19:18.320 --> 19:23.520]  need to stand these people down and we need to make sure they're going to follow the law.
[19:23.520 --> 19:27.760]  One of the things that made this work here was that they had something they could give
[19:27.760 --> 19:28.760]  up.
[19:28.760 --> 19:31.320]  They had the cattle that they could give up.
[19:31.320 --> 19:36.880]  In most cases, like I think the Occupy movement, the problem most protests is they don't have
[19:36.880 --> 19:38.160]  a clear objective.
[19:38.160 --> 19:41.240]  They don't offer the other side a way to step down.
[19:41.240 --> 19:45.640]  We need to offer them a way to step down, but it needs to be about something much broader
[19:45.640 --> 19:46.640]  than the cattle.
[19:46.640 --> 19:47.640]  But that's, that's a good thing.
[19:47.640 --> 19:49.480]  If we've got something right there, that's a good thing.
[19:49.480 --> 19:53.320]  We're going to be back and we're going to play right away Alex Jones' groundbreaking
[19:53.320 --> 19:54.320]  story.
[19:54.320 --> 19:56.320]  The White House tells parents that children could be terrorists.
[19:56.320 --> 19:57.920]  Stay tuned, we're going to be right back.

[23:57.320 --> 24:06.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[24:06.560 --> 24:10.160]  I'm David Knight and on the last segment we just had Alex on and he was talking about
[24:10.160 --> 24:14.600]  how yesterday Harry Reid emphasized that the peaceful protesters at the Bundy Ranch
[24:14.600 --> 24:18.800]  standoff were domestic terrorists and then this morning we have this breaking news from
[24:18.800 --> 24:24.120]  Homeland Security telling warning parents that confrontational children could become
[24:24.120 --> 24:28.440]  terrorists as Alex said the guns are no longer off in the distance.
[24:28.440 --> 24:32.160]  What we've been telling you for years is now coming in your face.
[24:32.160 --> 24:35.120]  Here's that report from Alex.
[24:35.120 --> 24:37.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, I told you this was coming.
[24:37.640 --> 24:42.720]  I told you the Bundy Ranch situation could be the new 1776.
[24:42.720 --> 24:48.480]  The globalists openly have converted Homeland Security over to a system to wage domestic
[24:48.480 --> 24:50.680]  war on political enemies.
[24:50.680 --> 24:52.720]  It was set up for that.
[24:52.720 --> 24:56.880]  You've heard in the news about the documents that we and others got that the government
[24:56.880 --> 25:01.200]  admits are real where they list gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans
[25:01.200 --> 25:03.840]  and Christians as the main terror threat.
[25:03.840 --> 25:05.600]  The FBI now admits that.
[25:05.600 --> 25:07.680]  That's who they're targeting.
[25:07.680 --> 25:12.360]  Not the globalists that are funding Al Qaeda publicly in Syria living on other areas.
[25:12.360 --> 25:13.760]  So it's we the people.
[25:13.760 --> 25:17.280]  The Pentagon is trying to take on gun owners.
[25:17.280 --> 25:18.680]  This is a criminal takeover.
[25:18.680 --> 25:24.200]  Well now, Harry Reid, we have the video on him, FullWars.com, it's linked on DrudgeReport.com,
[25:24.200 --> 25:28.720]  came out last night and said he's talked to the head of the FBI, Homeland Security, all
[25:28.720 --> 25:32.200]  of them that the Bundy's basically are domestic terrorists.
[25:32.200 --> 25:35.480]  Their supporters are who wanted to, quote, kill children.
[25:35.480 --> 25:39.040]  He actually says that and they have automatic weapons.
[25:39.040 --> 25:45.400]  So continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, he has now openly come out and said this and
[25:45.400 --> 25:50.360]  we have the video right here on infowars.com.
[25:50.360 --> 25:51.600]  So you need to go there.
[25:51.600 --> 25:54.600]  You can see the video on the site.
[25:54.600 --> 26:01.840]  Now continuing on top of that, White House counterterror chief says confrontational children
[26:01.840 --> 26:05.200]  could be terrorists and the video is posted right there.
[26:05.200 --> 26:06.520]  I'm not joking.
[26:06.520 --> 26:11.040]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, what is really behind all of this?
[26:11.040 --> 26:17.040]  Look at this headline, New York Daily News, Kids Suspended for Bringing Nerf Guns to School
[26:17.040 --> 26:19.600]  with Teacher's Permission.
[26:19.600 --> 26:23.400]  Kids get suspended at their neighbors, see them playing with Nerf guns in their backyard.
[26:23.400 --> 26:24.920]  You can pull that article up.
[26:24.920 --> 26:26.040]  You say it makes no sense.
[26:26.040 --> 26:27.520]  You say it's crazy.
[26:27.520 --> 26:33.840]  You say it's nuts to claim that little kids are basically, you know, some type of criminal
[26:33.840 --> 26:40.800]  for having guns, toy guns, or you see these reports now saying that if a baby throws its
[26:40.800 --> 26:45.960]  bottle that could be a major indicator that they're a terrorist.
[26:45.960 --> 26:50.160]  This is about making everyone criminal but the people running the system.
[26:50.160 --> 26:57.200]  This is about the rollout of a total authoritarian system, a total and complete nanny state,
[26:57.200 --> 27:03.320]  ladies and gentlemen, and that's what we're breaking down every day here at infowars.com.
[27:03.320 --> 27:10.000]  What we're seeing is the branding of any type of even speech against tyranny as terrorism.
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.880]  The free speech zones, the NSA spying, all of it is part of this system.
[27:14.880 --> 27:18.600]  So before people make jokes, and I see folks making jokes in the comments saying these
[27:18.600 --> 27:24.280]  people are crazy, these people are nuts, you know, if a dog's aggressive, is it a terrorist?
[27:24.280 --> 27:26.360]  You've got to understand this is social engineering.
[27:26.360 --> 27:28.880]  This is a plan they're rolling out.
[27:28.880 --> 27:33.280]  This is why if a kid makes the image of their finger as a gun, bang bang, in school they
[27:33.280 --> 27:34.520]  get arrested.
[27:34.520 --> 27:38.960]  This is why if you ask a cop why you've been pulled over, you get tasered or taken to
[27:38.960 --> 27:39.960]  jail.
[27:39.960 --> 27:43.120]  It's a paramilitary takeover, okay?
[27:43.120 --> 27:48.480]  This is literal mind control where they're expanding terrorism to everyone.
[27:48.480 --> 27:52.720]  First they roll it out to fight al-Qaeda, then they say forget about al-Qaeda, it's for you
[27:52.720 --> 27:54.440]  and your family.
[27:54.440 --> 27:58.400]  And now they're going to continue to grab land, underage in 21, they're going to continue
[27:58.400 --> 28:04.120]  to raise the taxes, they're going to continue to harass everybody until people start resisting,
[28:04.120 --> 28:08.280]  then they're going to call it terrorism, then they're going to stage terror attacks, blame
[28:08.280 --> 28:11.960]  on their political opposition, and bring in martial law.
[28:11.960 --> 28:17.920]  This is their plan, this is what I keep warning you about, please, for military, police and
[28:17.920 --> 28:23.960]  others understand what's happening, understand that America's being shut down, deindustrialized,
[28:23.960 --> 28:26.400]  and the people are in a depression.
[28:26.400 --> 28:33.320]  And if this is designed to create tension that the globalists can then basically use
[28:33.320 --> 28:38.200]  to bring in their next level of control, we've got to find a third way out of this, we've
[28:38.200 --> 28:42.400]  got to realize the globalist plan and the program that they're carrying out.
[28:42.400 --> 28:46.720]  David Knight's going to be hosting the show today, I'll be calling in repeatedly as well
[28:46.720 --> 28:51.160]  and doing work behind the scenes, infowars.com for the free live feeds.
[28:51.160 --> 28:55.720]  And remember, if you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance to the foreign banks
[28:55.720 --> 29:00.000]  that have seized control of the government, these are their political commissar, political
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.760]  officers literally taking over the society.
[29:03.760 --> 29:09.840]  It's really happening, children, parents, don't trust your children, they could be terrorists.
[29:09.840 --> 29:16.320]  This is on mainstream news with the White House counterterrorism chief, this is really happening.
[29:16.320 --> 29:21.680]  This is really unfolding, ladies and gentlemen, as I told you at Wood, Homeland Security is
[29:21.680 --> 29:26.160]  the takeover arm to shut down America and bring in the new world order.
[29:26.160 --> 29:28.200]  Similar systems have been set up worldwide.
[29:28.200 --> 29:32.240]  Alex Jones signing off for infowars.com, get these stories out to people.
[29:32.240 --> 29:34.480]  This is a plan, they know what they're doing.
[29:34.480 --> 29:37.960]  This is a plan, Alex Jones again signing off.
[29:37.960 --> 29:40.160]  We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[29:40.160 --> 29:45.160]  He wrote the articles about Harry Reid repeating, emphasizing that peaceful protesters against
[29:45.160 --> 29:49.640]  the police state were domestic terrorists and the government Homeland Security pitting
[29:49.640 --> 29:53.960]  parents against children, we'll be right back.
[29:53.960 --> 30:04.640]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, I'm also
[30:04.640 --> 30:09.760]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[30:09.760 --> 30:13.800]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[30:13.800 --> 30:18.160]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[30:18.160 --> 30:23.480]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[30:23.480 --> 30:29.880]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.
[30:29.880 --> 30:34.400]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and
[30:34.400 --> 30:37.120]  heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[30:37.120 --> 30:41.400]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[30:41.400 --> 30:44.160]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[30:44.160 --> 30:48.840]  Stop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[30:48.840 --> 30:51.920]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[30:51.920 --> 30:56.840]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[30:56.840 --> 31:00.840]  my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[31:00.840 --> 31:06.280]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[31:06.280 --> 31:11.040]  toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic, indoor air has
[31:11.040 --> 31:15.280]  been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor
[31:15.280 --> 31:20.280]  air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within
[31:20.280 --> 31:21.280]  their homes.
[31:21.280 --> 31:25.600]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States, well over a thousand types
[31:25.600 --> 31:30.720]  of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans
[31:30.720 --> 31:32.760]  live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[31:32.760 --> 31:37.280]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[31:37.280 --> 31:42.320]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[31:42.320 --> 31:43.320]  back against.
[31:43.320 --> 31:47.680]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[31:47.680 --> 31:52.160]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[31:52.160 --> 31:54.320]  with you throughout any toxic environment.
[31:54.320 --> 32:00.960]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3-888-2533139.
[32:00.960 --> 32:05.720]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time but now they're expanding
[32:05.720 --> 32:09.120]  making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[32:09.120 --> 32:11.360]  All the major networks are state run.
[32:11.360 --> 32:14.000]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[32:14.000 --> 32:18.400]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[32:18.400 --> 32:21.520]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[32:21.520 --> 32:25.960]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids
[32:25.960 --> 32:29.080]  belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[32:29.080 --> 32:33.400]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[32:33.400 --> 32:37.920]  We are the true media, the establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[32:37.920 --> 32:41.880]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[32:57.080 --> 33:13.760]  Join us at prisonplanet.tv.
[33:13.760 --> 33:23.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[33:23.160 --> 33:24.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:24.560 --> 33:30.040]  I'm David Knight and I have Paul Joseph Watson from London on the phone, one of our staff
[33:30.040 --> 33:36.680]  writers here, and Paul wrote several key stories the last couple of days about what's going
[33:36.680 --> 33:37.680]  on in the press.
[33:37.680 --> 33:43.200]  Now, we've had the story that he wrote yesterday, Harry Reid calling Clive and Bundy supporters
[33:43.200 --> 33:47.320]  domestic terrorists, and then the story that broke this morning that he wrote White House
[33:47.320 --> 33:53.080]  counter-terrorism chief says that confrontational children could be terrorists.
[33:53.080 --> 33:54.800]  So parents, watch out for them.
[33:54.800 --> 34:00.400]  This is, as Alex just said in his report, this is social engineering for the police
[34:00.400 --> 34:01.400]  state.
[34:01.400 --> 34:02.400]  Paul, welcome.
[34:02.400 --> 34:04.120]  Hi, David.
[34:04.120 --> 34:05.120]  This is pretty amazing.
[34:05.120 --> 34:07.440]  They're really stepping this rhetoric up.
[34:07.440 --> 34:12.160]  These were peaceful people protesting the police state.
[34:12.160 --> 34:18.720]  And they're the ones now, the media is spinning this as well as the government, trying to
[34:18.720 --> 34:20.960]  talk about how these people were threatening the government.
[34:20.960 --> 34:23.840]  The government had been threatening and attacking people all week.
[34:23.840 --> 34:28.320]  It was the government that was threatening us the entire time we were standing there.
[34:28.320 --> 34:33.000]  And as people were gradually milling forward, they were threatening to shoot.
[34:33.000 --> 34:37.240]  They actually, a Fox News reporter tried to get closer because he was having trouble hearing
[34:37.240 --> 34:39.040]  or he wanted to interview somebody up there.
[34:39.040 --> 34:42.760]  He was walking forward saying, Fox News, Fox News, lifting up his shirt, stopping, and
[34:42.760 --> 34:43.760]  they waved him off.
[34:43.760 --> 34:44.760]  They wouldn't let him come by.
[34:44.760 --> 34:46.360]  They were the ones who were threatening people.
[34:46.360 --> 34:51.280]  They were threatening reporters as well as anyone who was in the area.
[34:51.280 --> 34:54.440]  Well, first off, David, I'd like to commend you on the excellent coverage.
[34:54.440 --> 34:59.160]  I was watching the stream last weekend at the Bundy Ranch and obviously we received
[34:59.160 --> 35:01.520]  a ton of positive messages.
[35:01.520 --> 35:04.360]  So kudos to you on that coverage.
[35:04.360 --> 35:05.640]  And Josh was there with me too.
[35:05.640 --> 35:06.760]  He was filming as well.
[35:06.760 --> 35:12.640]  So, and Josh is going to be going to Boston too with Jakari Jackson to see what police
[35:12.640 --> 35:14.080]  state measures they're doing there.
[35:14.080 --> 35:17.440]  Because that is, I think, one of the most important elements, there's so many elements
[35:17.440 --> 35:18.440]  about this.
[35:18.440 --> 35:19.440]  There's agenda 21.
[35:19.440 --> 35:23.360]  There's the political corruption, I think, but this police state issue is now the one
[35:23.360 --> 35:26.520]  that is bubbling up to the top, isn't it, Paul?
[35:26.520 --> 35:27.520]  Exactly.
[35:27.520 --> 35:32.600]  And the article today which ties into all this is White House counter-terror chief says
[35:32.600 --> 35:35.360]  confrontational children could be terrorists.
[35:35.360 --> 35:41.920]  And this is Lisa Monaco, who is Obama's chief homeland security and counter-terror advisor.
[35:41.920 --> 35:46.920]  She came out in a speech on Tuesday night and followed it up in subsequent press appearances
[35:46.920 --> 35:50.720]  and said, well, what kinds of behaviors are we talking about?
[35:50.720 --> 35:54.240]  For the most part, they're not related directly to plotting attacks.
[35:54.240 --> 35:55.320]  They're more subtle.
[35:55.320 --> 36:00.160]  For instance, parents might see sudden personality changes in their children at home becoming
[36:00.160 --> 36:02.160]  confrontational.
[36:02.160 --> 36:07.600]  So she's actually talking about the radicalization of children into becoming terrorists and the
[36:07.600 --> 36:13.760]  behavior that denotes that possibility is children becoming confrontational with their
[36:13.760 --> 36:15.120]  own parents.
[36:15.120 --> 36:21.240]  What child, what teenager isn't, at some point, confrontational with their parents?
[36:21.240 --> 36:27.080]  So as I extrapolated out in this article, again, the term terrorism, the term domestic
[36:27.080 --> 36:32.440]  terrorism, as used by Harry Reid yesterday, it's clearly lost all meaning because it's
[36:32.440 --> 36:39.240]  been so overused as this tool to demonize political activism that it's become completely
[36:39.240 --> 36:41.240]  meaningless altogether.
[36:41.240 --> 36:45.120]  And you can see that they're now engaging in this program, which Alex has talked about
[36:45.120 --> 36:46.120]  on the video.
[36:46.120 --> 36:47.120]  You just played.
[36:47.120 --> 36:52.120]  It's a mass reclassification of deviant behavior.
[36:52.120 --> 36:57.920]  It's about behavioral control because they're trying to define any political activism or
[36:57.920 --> 37:03.440]  any mere belief that's adversarial to the state, they're characterizing it as radical
[37:03.440 --> 37:04.440]  and dangerous.
[37:04.440 --> 37:08.440]  So it's the fear-driven implementation of thought crime.
[37:08.440 --> 37:14.200]  They're not doing it because, necessarily, they plan to go out and round up and arrest
[37:14.200 --> 37:17.000]  millions of libertarians or constitutionalists.
[37:17.000 --> 37:22.120]  They're doing it to dissuade people on the outside from becoming interested in these
[37:22.120 --> 37:24.160]  kind of ideas in the first place.
[37:24.160 --> 37:31.360]  For self-society, as well as perhaps some drugs, you know, they've already got a condition
[37:31.360 --> 37:34.160]  that they created just a couple of years ago called ODD.
[37:34.160 --> 37:37.200]  You know, I'm sure they started with thatachronism.
[37:37.200 --> 37:41.040]  They say if you have oppositional defiant disorder, right?
[37:41.040 --> 37:42.720]  And that's what it looks like they're talking about.
[37:42.720 --> 37:43.720]  They're trying to set this up.
[37:43.720 --> 37:48.200]  Are they going to do something maybe like they did with ADD and drugging all the boys
[37:48.200 --> 37:52.880]  in school with Ritalin because it's almost entirely boys that they give Ritalin to?
[37:52.880 --> 37:54.880]  Exactly.
[37:54.880 --> 37:59.880]  The legacy for that, of course, is the former Soviet Union, where they had these psykushkas,
[37:59.880 --> 38:04.480]  these mental hospitals, which were used by the state as prisons in order to in turn political
[38:04.480 --> 38:05.480]  dissidents.
[38:05.480 --> 38:11.200]  And in fact, a Soviet psychiatry expert at the Institute at the time said that it was
[38:11.200 --> 38:16.360]  about ideas about a struggle for truth and justice are formed by personalities with a
[38:16.360 --> 38:17.840]  paranoid structure.
[38:17.840 --> 38:23.760]  So they were classifying adversarial ideas against the state as a form of psychosis.
[38:23.760 --> 38:29.600]  And then in 2009, Psychology Today came out with an article which viciously attacked us,
[38:29.600 --> 38:34.120]  which basically said the same thing, that this oppositional defiant disorder was manifesting
[38:34.120 --> 38:36.400]  itself in the political arena.
[38:36.400 --> 38:40.600]  People who were suspicious of the state could have a form of psychosis.
[38:40.600 --> 38:45.640]  And then, of course, at the same time, you had leaked Homeland Security reports saying
[38:45.640 --> 38:48.520]  people reverent of individual liberty.
[38:48.520 --> 38:53.160]  They weren't even talking about being a part of a political party or supporting a candidate.
[38:53.160 --> 38:58.920]  Merely being reverent of individual liberty was a characterization, a sign of potential
[38:58.920 --> 38:59.920]  terrorism.
[38:59.920 --> 39:06.600]  So it shifted from the psychiatric arena, declaring people who have anti-statist ideas
[39:06.600 --> 39:09.000]  as being potentially mentally ill.
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.120]  And now they've shifted it into the political battlefield saying, you know, we're all right-wing
[39:14.120 --> 39:16.720]  extremist radicals who want violence.
[39:16.720 --> 39:19.680]  So much for the idea of the loyal opposition, right?
[39:19.680 --> 39:23.160]  Just give those people the blue pill and tell them to shut up or we'll commit them to an
[39:23.160 --> 39:24.160]  institution.
[39:24.160 --> 39:30.520]  It's absolutely chilling and its legacy is in the most draconian totalitarian states
[39:30.520 --> 39:31.520]  throughout history.
[39:31.520 --> 39:37.800]  But now, of course, as you said, the whole push is about Bundy supporters being violent.
[39:37.800 --> 39:42.480]  And yet the only violence during that whole standoff over the course of the past couple
[39:42.480 --> 39:48.280]  of weeks was carried out by the BLM feds when they tasered Bundy family members, when they
[39:48.280 --> 39:54.240]  assaulted pregnant women and cancer victims during that early standoff before the main
[39:54.240 --> 39:55.240]  war.
[39:55.240 --> 40:00.960]  And as he said, the people escalating the violent rhetoric, as Harry Reid did yesterday, were
[40:00.960 --> 40:02.480]  again the BLM agents.
[40:02.480 --> 40:04.600]  I mean, you were there on the front lines.
[40:04.600 --> 40:07.840]  You heard them saying, threatening that they would shoot people.
[40:07.840 --> 40:09.640]  So they're the ones engaging in violence.
[40:09.640 --> 40:15.080]  They're the ones engaging in violent rhetoric, and yet the mass media lays all that on Bundy
[40:15.080 --> 40:20.560]  supporters when they played the key role in keeping that standoff peaceful.
[40:20.560 --> 40:24.800]  The mass of people there were, I don't know how long it was, I guess we were there for
[40:24.800 --> 40:25.800]  maybe about an hour.
[40:25.800 --> 40:28.320]  We had to wait for the amounted people to get there, whatever.
[40:28.320 --> 40:30.000]  But they were threatening us the entire time.
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.000]  I never heard anybody threatening to shoot them, but they weren't on a loudspeaker threatening
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  to shoot us.
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.560]  One of the things, Paul, that bothers me about this was early in the week, it was actually
[40:39.560 --> 40:42.320]  Glenn Beck, who got out in front and led the charge.
[40:42.320 --> 40:45.920]  He had an interview with Clive and Bundy, and in that interview, he started talking
[40:45.920 --> 40:47.240]  about the legal issues.
[40:47.240 --> 40:52.080]  And Glenn Beck spun this to say, oh, so you're saying that you're sovereign over all this,
[40:52.080 --> 40:56.280]  and then he had a guy that was there in the studio with him and said, Mr. Bundy, are you
[40:56.280 --> 40:58.320]  part of the sovereign citizen movement?
[40:58.320 --> 40:59.760]  Now you and I know what that is.
[40:59.760 --> 41:01.920]  Mr. Bundy had never heard that term before.
[41:01.920 --> 41:08.000]  I know that the FBI has listed as one of their top groups, people that they identify, that
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.960]  they label as sovereign citizens, they label them as domestic terrorists, and they have
[41:12.960 --> 41:17.840]  pushed this narrative, they've pushed this label out to law enforcement so that if they
[41:17.840 --> 41:23.480]  label somebody as a sovereign citizen, law enforcement officers now believe that their
[41:23.480 --> 41:27.720]  lives are in immediate danger from someone that has that label.
[41:27.720 --> 41:32.760]  That was one of the most irresponsible things I've ever seen anywhere, and they got out
[41:32.760 --> 41:35.160]  in front of everybody else and called him something.
[41:35.160 --> 41:38.680]  And he had no idea of, and he was never saying that he was sovereign.
[41:38.680 --> 41:43.120]  He was saying that the county, that the state was sovereign, and as a matter of fact, we
[41:43.120 --> 41:49.320]  have a representative Stockman from Texas said that today, pointed out that the federal
[41:49.320 --> 41:53.720]  law says that if they're going to use force to enforce some kind of a federal judgment
[41:53.720 --> 41:57.640]  or anything else, they need to contract with local law enforcement.
[41:57.640 --> 41:58.640]  That's the federal law.
[41:58.640 --> 42:00.220]  They were the ones who were breaking the law.
[42:00.220 --> 42:03.720]  They were the ones who sent in an army of people from all over the country.
[42:03.720 --> 42:06.040]  They were the ones who were pointing snipers at everybody.
[42:06.040 --> 42:07.040]  That's what Harry Reid said.
[42:07.040 --> 42:09.040]  He said there were hundreds and hundreds of people from around the country that came
[42:09.040 --> 42:10.040]  there.
[42:10.040 --> 42:11.040]  Yeah, federal agents.
[42:11.040 --> 42:13.720]  They also had sniper rifles, federal agents.
[42:13.720 --> 42:16.600]  They had weapons, automatic weapons, federal agents.
[42:16.600 --> 42:18.080]  They had children lined up.
[42:18.080 --> 42:19.520]  That wasn't the federal agents.
[42:19.520 --> 42:20.960]  That wasn't us either.
[42:20.960 --> 42:25.880]  That was somebody who was not even there talking about what he thought was going to be done
[42:25.880 --> 42:28.320]  or what he thought would be a good idea.
[42:28.320 --> 42:33.240]  Nobody talked about that, and as we showed, that did not happen.
[42:33.240 --> 42:36.280]  And then you've got the so-called lawlessness of Bundy.
[42:36.280 --> 42:41.840]  Well, the actual court order that the feds got against him did not give them any right
[42:41.840 --> 42:47.240]  to seize his property, did not give them any right to shoot dead his cattle, which evidence
[42:47.240 --> 42:48.240]  is now merged.
[42:48.240 --> 42:53.280]  Didn't give them any right to destroy his property, which evidence of which is also
[42:53.280 --> 42:54.280]  now merged.
[42:54.280 --> 42:58.960]  So they broke the law, and even if you agree, even if you stand on the side of the feds
[42:58.960 --> 43:04.560]  as Glenn Beck does, as Judge Andrew Napolitano pointed out, all they've got the power to
[43:04.560 --> 43:09.040]  do is put a lien on his property and try and claim back the so-called grazing fees that
[43:09.040 --> 43:10.040]  way.
[43:10.040 --> 43:15.760]  They have no legal right to go and steal his property, to shoot his cattle, and to intimidate
[43:15.760 --> 43:17.320]  peaceful protesters.
[43:17.320 --> 43:21.960]  But now they've opened it up and labeled all the Bundy supporters as terrorists as Harry
[43:21.960 --> 43:24.160]  Reid did last night.
[43:24.160 --> 43:29.480]  That opens it up to NDAA, indefinite detention without trial.
[43:29.480 --> 43:31.760]  It opens it up to drone strikes.
[43:31.760 --> 43:34.320]  It opens it up to summary execution.
[43:34.320 --> 43:38.560]  Now that they've declared the United States as a battlefield in the war on terror under
[43:38.560 --> 43:44.080]  the NDAA, now they've been designated as terrorists, they can use terrorist tactics against them.
[43:44.080 --> 43:49.640]  Which is interesting because there are allegations floating around which are not substantiated
[43:49.640 --> 43:54.320]  but are pretty interesting, I was looking into them before the show, that some of the
[43:54.320 --> 44:00.200]  main players involved in directing the BLM siege against Bundy, the people on the front
[44:00.200 --> 44:07.240]  lines, were in fact, around 10 to 12 years ago, special forces, Green Beret soldiers
[44:07.240 --> 44:13.640]  who were involved in occupying cities in Pakistan and Afghanistan, fighting Taliban and al-Qaeda
[44:13.640 --> 44:14.640]  terrorists.
[44:14.640 --> 44:17.040]  And this was in a Discovery Channel documentary.
[44:17.040 --> 44:22.760]  It appears as if one of the individuals now in charge at the BLM played that role as a
[44:22.760 --> 44:26.040]  special forces Green Beret 12 years ago.
[44:26.040 --> 44:32.160]  He fought terrorists and now he's on the front line of this siege against Americans who are
[44:32.160 --> 44:37.280]  now being designated by terrorists, not only by Harry Reid, remember, in that video that
[44:37.280 --> 44:41.800]  came out last night, he said, I've spoken to Eric Holder, I've spoken to the Justice
[44:41.800 --> 44:43.560]  Department, they agree.
[44:43.560 --> 44:50.680]  So it's not just Harry Reid, it's Washington D.C. that now sees Bundy supporters as terrorists
[44:50.680 --> 44:53.280]  and it's open game on what's going to happen next.
[44:53.280 --> 44:56.920]  Yeah, it was interesting, the guy who was there from the BLM, I believe his name was
[44:56.920 --> 45:01.680]  Dan Love, he actually had a sign on him that said police, but he didn't have the sign underneath
[45:01.680 --> 45:04.120]  it had fallen off that said state.
[45:04.120 --> 45:08.200]  And you know, when we were talking, actually, I got footage of Ammon, one of the sons of
[45:08.200 --> 45:12.800]  Clive and Bundy, and when he got finished and the sheriff was up there, he said to the
[45:12.800 --> 45:16.600]  sheriff, he said, we will listen to you, you have authority here and he looked at that
[45:16.600 --> 45:22.280]  guy and he said, you have no authority here and he doesn't, he's just a hired mercenary
[45:22.280 --> 45:23.560]  from the BLM.
[45:23.560 --> 45:26.480]  This goes back to what you've been pointing out and Infowars has been pointing out for
[45:26.480 --> 45:30.520]  a long time, Paul, when you were talking about the billions of bullets and you were linking
[45:30.520 --> 45:35.200]  to the documents and we're talking about how the Department of Education is even creating
[45:35.200 --> 45:41.760]  SWAT teams, the Weather Service is creating SWAT teams, the increasing police state that
[45:41.760 --> 45:45.240]  we see at every bureaucracy, and of course, they write their own laws, they judge whether
[45:45.240 --> 45:48.480]  or not you're in violation of their own laws, you don't have a presumption of innocence,
[45:48.480 --> 45:51.960]  and then they send their militarized police force against you.
[45:51.960 --> 45:55.160]  You've been writing about this and people have been pushing about that, pushing back
[45:55.160 --> 45:57.920]  about that for a long time.
[45:57.920 --> 46:01.760]  We've been writing about it for the best part of a decade because of course, the Defense
[46:01.760 --> 46:06.720]  Department sold all those armored vehicles that they'd used in Afghanistan to local police
[46:06.720 --> 46:11.400]  departments, which were bought with Homeland Security grants, so everything that they
[46:11.400 --> 46:16.200]  used against terrorists in Afghanistan, they're now using against the American people.
[46:16.200 --> 46:21.000]  Another aspect to it, you mentioned the police state, is the rampant hypocrisy on behalf
[46:21.000 --> 46:27.920]  of the left of either ignoring or enthusiastically supporting state brutality when it's meted
[46:27.920 --> 46:32.200]  out against Americans who may hold differing views to themselves, because if you followed
[46:32.200 --> 46:37.880]  the conversation on this, obviously with the leftist media, media matters slate websites
[46:37.880 --> 46:43.040]  such as those, they're dead set against Bundy, they're classifying everyone as right-wing
[46:43.040 --> 46:49.120]  extremists, and it's been picked up by their acolytes to the point where I'm having conversations
[46:49.120 --> 46:54.920]  with people on Twitter who are calling for Bundy supporters to be, quote, shot on the
[46:54.920 --> 46:55.920]  spot.
[46:55.920 --> 47:02.520]  They're calling for belligerent protesters to be executed with drone strikes, so it's
[47:02.520 --> 47:08.680]  just galling how, for example, we saw with Occupy Wall Street, the protesters getting
[47:08.680 --> 47:14.400]  pepper sprayed in the face directly, I mean, we rose up to their defense, Occupy Wall Street
[47:14.400 --> 47:21.240]  protesters targeted by snipers, or there was at least a plan to do that, and the left was
[47:21.240 --> 47:23.080]  outraged, and rightly so.
[47:23.080 --> 47:27.600]  But when it happens to people who may be a little different in their political views,
[47:27.600 --> 47:33.360]  they support state brutality, so that's a major problem, the statists simply do not
[47:33.360 --> 47:37.680]  see that the tyranny is being imposed on everyone, and if they stand on the opposite
[47:37.680 --> 47:42.400]  side to us, then, you know, if we don't hang together, then we hang separate.
[47:42.400 --> 47:47.560]  The inability to extrapolate it to the larger principles and the blindness that comes from
[47:47.560 --> 47:52.040]  being manipulated by their individual prejudices against these other groups, and I've seen
[47:52.040 --> 47:57.480]  every label that you could put on the Bundy family or the protesters, I've seen those
[47:57.480 --> 48:03.080]  labels put on as a way of building hate, and one of the key organizations at the center
[48:03.080 --> 48:06.320]  of that is the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[48:06.320 --> 48:14.200]  This is an organization that has a mail order business model that sends out letters and
[48:14.200 --> 48:19.680]  findings to the federal government to essentially set up and create hate for individual groups.
[48:19.680 --> 48:21.160]  That's what they're all about.
[48:21.160 --> 48:28.840]  It's a hate industry, and they get huge grants from governments to continue their existence.
[48:28.840 --> 48:34.840]  They need to continue to escalate the so-called threat posed by hate crime and violent right-wing
[48:34.840 --> 48:39.480]  extremists, which does exist, but certainly nowhere near to the level that they amp it
[48:39.480 --> 48:45.520]  up to, and you can see with their supporters that they were actually excited at the prospect
[48:45.520 --> 48:50.440]  of Bundy supporters getting gunned down, some of them, and they were crushingly disappointed
[48:50.440 --> 48:52.160]  when it didn't happen.
[48:52.160 --> 48:59.080]  So the hypocrisy, again, is rampant, and another angle was this idea of Bundy is sponging
[48:59.080 --> 49:06.560]  off the state, he's engaging in complete lawlessness, a ton of leftists took that stance, and yet
[49:06.560 --> 49:10.800]  they support millions of illegal immigrants who do exactly the same thing.
[49:10.800 --> 49:16.320]  So again, they don't have any actual principles, they just selectively apply them based on
[49:16.320 --> 49:18.840]  whether they agree with you politically or not.
[49:18.840 --> 49:22.440]  One of the things that bothered me in this entire narrative was the confusion about property
[49:22.440 --> 49:23.440]  rights.
[49:23.440 --> 49:24.440]  What was property?
[49:24.440 --> 49:29.800]  Now, a lot of people have a very simple understanding of property rights to just be, let's say,
[49:29.800 --> 49:34.160]  you own everything in this little squared off area, but here in Texas, a lot of times
[49:34.160 --> 49:38.880]  you buy a house, you don't get the mineral rights, those don't convey.
[49:38.880 --> 49:42.920]  And what the Bundys had were surface rights, they had grazing rights, they had water rights,
[49:42.920 --> 49:46.600]  they never claimed to own the land.
[49:46.600 --> 49:51.040]  Now they did say that they believe that that land should, rightfully under the Constitution,
[49:51.040 --> 49:54.920]  have been ceded to the state authority at the time it became a state.
[49:54.920 --> 49:59.480]  And he was talking about how, as we've seen with Stockman, they did not have the legal
[49:59.480 --> 50:01.760]  authority to be there as a police force.
[50:01.760 --> 50:06.760]  But we need to understand these property rights have been well established with previous court
[50:06.760 --> 50:07.760]  cases.
[50:07.760 --> 50:09.840]  As a matter of fact, it was just last year.
[50:09.840 --> 50:14.240]  Another case that started back in 1993, Kit Daniels wrote about this yesterday, and a
[50:14.240 --> 50:18.840]  federal judge in making that decision last, it was either June or July, said that the
[50:18.840 --> 50:23.120]  BLM had engaged in a criminal conspiracy against ranchers.
[50:23.120 --> 50:24.960]  Now this all began in 1993.
[50:24.960 --> 50:30.440]  They tried to deny his grazing rights, his water rights, exactly the same things that
[50:30.440 --> 50:33.160]  were going on here in this particular place.
[50:33.160 --> 50:38.920]  And you know, if you've got property rights on your home, and the federal government,
[50:38.920 --> 50:41.760]  and you're paying taxes to the county, and the federal government comes in at some point
[50:41.760 --> 50:45.160]  in time and says, you don't have those rights anymore, we're just going to take them, which
[50:45.160 --> 50:50.000]  is what they did with these ranchers, you're going to be facing exactly the same thing.
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.000]  People need to broaden their perspectives.
[50:51.000 --> 50:52.000]  We've got to go to break.
[50:52.000 --> 51:01.000]  We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson, stay tuned.
[51:01.000 --> 51:04.520]  You've heard about the lowest price promise at Emergency Essentials, but did you know
[51:04.520 --> 51:08.720]  right now you can save $100 on a catadine pocket micro water filter?
[51:08.720 --> 51:14.880]  Most supplies last at 40% off a personal emergency kit, 43% off a red feather butter, and 46%
[51:14.880 --> 51:16.880]  off the Victoria hand grain mill.
[51:16.880 --> 51:21.080]  And don't forget, you can save over $250 on the year supply of basics.
[51:21.080 --> 51:26.720]  Call Emergency Essentials at 800-999-1863 or visit BePrepared.com.
[51:26.720 --> 51:27.880]  The choice is clear.
[51:27.880 --> 51:29.880]  Be unprepared or BePrepared.com.
[51:29.880 --> 51:31.880]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[51:31.880 --> 51:35.520]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[51:35.520 --> 51:36.520]  IRAs?
[51:36.520 --> 51:40.520]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[51:40.520 --> 51:42.160]  of gold for your retirement.
[51:42.160 --> 51:45.600]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[51:45.600 --> 51:50.480]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[51:50.480 --> 51:56.280]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[51:56.280 --> 52:00.520]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[52:00.520 --> 52:01.720]  Hi there.
[52:01.720 --> 52:02.720]  My name is Frank Bates.
[52:02.720 --> 52:06.920]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[52:06.920 --> 52:13.160]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity
[52:13.160 --> 52:17.760]  monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent, lying crooks
[52:17.760 --> 52:23.040]  that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[52:23.040 --> 52:25.200]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[52:25.200 --> 52:29.720]  Others have called it a cover-up, and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy
[52:29.720 --> 52:30.720]  goes.
[52:30.720 --> 52:36.560]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[52:36.560 --> 52:38.960]  and how you can beat them too.

[52:59.480 --> 53:02.360]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[53:02.360 --> 53:07.840]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[53:07.840 --> 53:11.160]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the
[53:11.160 --> 53:15.320]  direction this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick
[53:15.320 --> 53:16.320]  buck.
[53:16.320 --> 53:20.240]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[53:20.240 --> 53:24.240]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[53:24.240 --> 53:29.520]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men
[53:29.520 --> 53:30.520]  and women.
[53:30.520 --> 53:33.400]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[53:33.400 --> 53:38.720]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high quality storeable foods from MyPatriot Supply.

[54:06.920 --> 54:07.920]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[54:07.920 --> 54:13.280]  I'm David Knight and I have Paul Joseph Watson, member wars in England on the phone.
[54:13.280 --> 54:17.320]  We've been talking about the stories that you broke yesterday about Harry Reid calling
[54:17.320 --> 54:22.480]  people who are leading a peaceful protest against the police state tactics and brutality
[54:22.480 --> 54:26.200]  that have been going on at the Nevada Ranch for quite some time.
[54:26.200 --> 54:32.240]  He called those peaceful protesters domestic terrorists and he repeated that for emphasis.
[54:32.240 --> 54:35.160]  And we've just been talking about how the media is joining in on that narrative.
[54:35.160 --> 54:42.160]  We got Reuters talking about these poor federal agents who are set upon by an angry armed
[54:42.160 --> 54:43.160]  mob.
[54:43.160 --> 54:44.280]  That is not what happened.
[54:44.280 --> 54:45.760]  We have footage there.
[54:45.760 --> 54:50.640]  You can see what people are doing even as they're calmly walking up to the gate.
[54:50.640 --> 54:54.640]  It has been spun by Glenn Beck to say those people at the gate, they were trying to start
[54:54.640 --> 54:55.640]  an incident.
[54:55.640 --> 54:57.920]  They were going to get everybody shot.
[54:57.920 --> 54:59.040]  That wasn't happening.
[54:59.040 --> 55:00.520]  We showed you the video.
[55:00.520 --> 55:01.520]  We were there.
[55:01.520 --> 55:02.520]  I was there.
[55:02.520 --> 55:03.520]  Josh Owens was there.
[55:03.520 --> 55:04.520]  We took the video.
[55:04.520 --> 55:05.520]  We've put it up.
[55:05.520 --> 55:06.520]  It should put the critics to rest.
[55:06.520 --> 55:07.760]  But now they're escalating this.
[55:07.760 --> 55:13.280]  Now Harry Reid has picked up on Glenn Beck's narrative and now we've got a Homeland Security
[55:13.280 --> 55:14.800]  Advisor, Lisa Monaco.
[55:14.800 --> 55:19.360]  This is another story Paul wrote about saying that any children with confrontational behavior
[55:19.360 --> 55:20.840]  might become terrorists.
[55:20.840 --> 55:27.600]  Now Paul, they just handed me an article that showed it was a quote and it was a very favorable
[55:27.600 --> 55:31.400]  article about her in the Boston Globe and they said, I'm married and without children.
[55:31.400 --> 55:34.600]  Monaco is incredibly dedicated to her work according to those who know her.
[55:34.600 --> 55:39.280]  Well, they may know her, but she doesn't know anything about children, does she?
[55:39.280 --> 55:40.280]  Well exactly.
[55:40.280 --> 55:45.440]  And again, you played the Melissa Harris Perry thing just before I came on.
[55:45.440 --> 55:49.960]  It's about this idea that the community should watch and be suspicious of everybody's children
[55:49.960 --> 55:51.680]  and that the parents have no rights.
[55:51.680 --> 55:55.320]  So it's a dual purpose propaganda tactic.
[55:55.320 --> 56:00.240]  They say they lament the fact that government can't watch everybody's children all the
[56:00.240 --> 56:01.240]  time.
[56:01.240 --> 56:03.480]  So now the onus is on the parents to do so.
[56:03.480 --> 56:09.240]  And then you see laws being passed in places like Scotland where state minders are assigned
[56:09.240 --> 56:13.040]  to children from birth to watch for any signs of abuse.
[56:13.040 --> 56:18.360]  Again, it's cradle to grave tyranny and now they're tying it into the terrorism angle
[56:18.360 --> 56:21.280]  as the war on terror turns inward against the American people.
[56:21.280 --> 56:25.240]  The real problem they've got is the threat of a good example.
[56:25.240 --> 56:29.600]  That's what people like Harry Reid are scared about because they're worried about the strengthening
[56:29.600 --> 56:35.000]  numbers that Americans that the Liberty movement can bring to situations like the Bundy siege.
[56:35.000 --> 56:39.880]  You heard one of the BLM agents say, you know, you're going to have to bring 10,000 people.
[56:39.880 --> 56:42.000]  Well, they didn't even need 10,000 people.
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.720]  They probably had about a thousand and not made the BLM back down.
[56:45.720 --> 56:50.840]  It must have scared them to death to see the Bundy family because that's, you know, he's
[56:50.840 --> 56:53.680]  not a rich rancher, but he is rich with his family.
[56:53.680 --> 56:57.840]  And he's got, I think 14 children, 40 some odd grandchildren.
[56:57.840 --> 57:03.480]  They were all very calm, very steady and very resolute about their freedom and about your
[57:03.480 --> 57:04.480]  freedom.
[57:04.480 --> 57:07.720]  At the very beginning of this, Clive and Bundy said, this is not about the grazing fees.
[57:07.720 --> 57:13.040]  It's not about anything but unchecked power and about your liberty.
[57:13.040 --> 57:14.560]  And that's exactly what it was about.
[57:14.560 --> 57:19.200]  And all of this family that I met, all of them that I saw there were very calm, very
[57:19.200 --> 57:24.040]  resolute, but they were not going to be backed down.
[57:24.040 --> 57:29.280]  And the only people goading violence again, amidst all these smears are people like Harry
[57:29.280 --> 57:30.280]  Reid.
[57:30.280 --> 57:31.440]  He's the person escalating violence.
[57:31.440 --> 57:37.280]  I mean, Rand Paul went on Fox News last night and said, calmer heads need to prevail, which
[57:37.280 --> 57:40.360]  is exactly what the Bundy supporters did during that standoff.
[57:40.360 --> 57:43.880]  So the only violent rhetoric is coming from their side.
[57:43.880 --> 57:49.280]  And again, they're, they're concerned about the fact that what they would call flash mobs,
[57:49.280 --> 57:54.200]  what we would call activists, we're able to dispatch them on such short notice and now
[57:54.200 --> 58:00.160]  actually win crucial battles in the ideological war for the liberty movement.
[58:00.160 --> 58:01.160]  That concerns them greatly.
[58:01.160 --> 58:07.240]  And now we've got economists predicting that 2014, 2015, we're going to see increasing
[58:07.240 --> 58:09.600]  civil unrest in America.
[58:09.600 --> 58:13.920]  And they're concerned about a form of the American spring that's, that's rising in the
[58:13.920 --> 58:14.920]  United States.
[58:14.920 --> 58:20.520]  So that's why they're trying to send a message that this will not be tolerated by labeling
[58:20.520 --> 58:22.960]  anyone that engages in it as domestic terror.
[58:22.960 --> 58:23.960]  We got to go to break.
[58:23.960 --> 58:27.320]  Can you hang on and do the next segment with us a short five minute segment?
[58:27.320 --> 58:28.320]  Sure.
[58:28.320 --> 58:29.320]  All right, we're going to be right back.
[58:29.320 --> 58:34.880]  The info war right now is about seizing the initiative and not letting them divide us
[58:34.880 --> 58:39.720]  into competing groups to understand the higher, the broader principles involved will be right
[58:39.720 --> 58:40.720]  back.

[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:23.000]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome back
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.040]  to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight live here in Austin and we have live from England
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:32.240]  Paul Joseph Watson and we've been talking about the Bundy Ranch standoff but there's
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:37.560]  other things other flash points in the world as well aren't there Paul cover some of the
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.040]  cover what's going on the Ukraine because you've been covering that quote more closely
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.040]  than I have.
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:46.080]  No one better than this story I haven't really followed the latest updates that are happening
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.080]  there go ahead.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:53.320]  Well of course pro-Russian Ukrainians have seized government buildings in eastern Ukraine
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:58.640]  and basically we've seen a mass marketing campaign on behalf of the media trying to
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:04.220]  sell World War three and there's a thing called God wins law which is that as soon as you
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:10.600]  compare something to the Nazis you lose the argument yet we've had western media accusing
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:17.680]  pro-Russian protesters in eastern Ukraine of circulating a letter demanding that Ukrainian
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:23.400]  Jews be registered obviously a chilling flashback to the Holocaust.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:29.440]  It turns out it's completely fake Jewish advocacy groups have said it's fake the man whose signature
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.080]  appeared on the alleged letter says that it's completely fake he never put his signature
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:39.400]  to the letter and yet the mass media reported this yesterday as if it was gospel fact there
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:45.640]  have been no retractions whatsoever so they tried to portray the pro-russian demonstrators
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:52.080]  as neo-nazis when in fact it was the Kiev puppet government that was installed with
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:59.600]  US help and with the aid of armed militant neo-nazis so completely ludicrous they've
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:05.000]  launched another false flag hoax it's been decimated once again and then you go back
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.840]  to the hypocrisy you know protesters occupying government buildings in Kiev is a good thing
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:16.400]  but protesters occupying government buildings in eastern Ukraine is a bad thing or protesters
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:21.960]  confronting BLM agents who are occupying land is a bad thing right exactly wherever
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:26.560]  they want to go very selective aren't they yeah yeah but again you know using force
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:32.200]  against protesters in Kiev that's a bad thing but using force against protesters in eastern
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:37.800]  Ukraine is a good thing and you know the US nearly bombed Syria because the Assad government
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:43.280]  was using tanks fighter jets and artillery against civilians but that's exactly what
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.760]  Ukraine started to do this week and they killed numerous protesters in the process but again
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:55.400]  the media said it was a sober necessary act so rampant hypocrisy once again and it annoys
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:05.120]  me that whenever I read BBC or CNN they constantly invoke quote Russian propaganda as if Russia
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:11.320]  is the only country in the world that engages in propaganda you know the official US ban
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:16.160]  on domestic propaganda they ended that in June of last year they openly said we're going
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:21.080]  to propagandize to our own citizens so why do we never hear about American propaganda
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:26.480]  or NATO propaganda you know that the mainstream media do they want to insult the intelligence
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:33.040]  of their viewers to such a degree by pretending that only the Russians do propaganda oh we've
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.320]  heard a lot of propaganda this week haven't we Paul and that's what we've just been talking
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:40.920]  about is how they've been propagandizing and trying to spend this narrative and spend
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:45.160]  what happened I think it's very important what Alex Jones said earlier he said when
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.440]  they try something we're going to be there and we can't always be there with info wars
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:53.840]  we were this time but there are going to be people who are going to be there with their
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.920]  cameras with their iPhones and they're going to be streaming stuff up no matter what they
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:01.760]  try and we've seen this over and over again and that's one of the things I think was motivating
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:06.720]  people was to see this mindless propaganda to see the police state and the brutality
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:12.200]  that's happening typically in the cities typically against minorities and nothing happening
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:16.200]  about it and that's essentially people have to understand that's the broader principle
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:22.120]  don't they Paul exactly people need to understand that we can win I mean before the fundy stand
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:26.400]  off everybody was predicting oh what's the point the BLM are just going to do what they
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:31.840]  want to do anyway well no they lost and we won a major turning point in the liberty movement
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:37.280]  and again as he said you know when injustice becomes law rebellion becomes duty we saw
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:42.760]  that last weekend the feds are scared about it they're scared of these quote flash mobs
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:49.240]  that can activate and organize within 24 hours basically and it's a major threat to them

[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:24.680]  night we're just talking to paul joseph what's going on in ukraine we're going to be covering
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:30.720]  some other news here as well but before we move on from the nevada ranch stand down
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:36.720]  as there's a lot of pushback here about who the aggressors are who the terrorists are
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:42.400]  who's breaking the law this is a discussion we need to have is about much broader principles
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:48.280]  much broader issues we cannot allow them to divide us down by demographic sectors pitting
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:53.160]  one group against another whether it's about religion or about race or about economic status
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:59.300]  or about the city versus the country whatever we've got to break down that kind of manipulation
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:04.560]  from the government and from the media and we need to understand what the broader principles
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:10.200]  are that are involved here now one person who really does understand that that's been
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:17.080]  talking about that a lot is andrew napolitano judge napolitano and he had this to say on
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:22.520]  fox news play this clip we've seen some heavy-ended tactics you know in fact in terms of these
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:27.320]  raids and then we've seen it you know at a more broad level in terms of the irs the
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:32.920]  doj going after reporters the nsa spying on us i mean it's hard to get the idea of government
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:38.600]  run amok in the eyes of many it is it is the federal government thinking it is immune from
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:44.920]  the laws of the land the laws of civility that govern the rest of us even basic constitutional
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:49.360]  principles there's a vast disconnect and not only between the federal government and people
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.440]  like mr. bundy remember the government is the servant not the master that's in this
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:58.600]  constitution of the declaration of independence that's not a political statement that's a
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:03.760]  value judgment in the american system that's right that's exactly it look he nailed it
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:09.720]  exactly and let me read you this some of the statements that were made by a federal judge
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:15.600]  in nevada last summer and this is a case that's been going on very similar to mr. bundy's
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:21.120]  case it's been going on started in 1993 just like mr. bundy's case and these are some of
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:26.640]  the things that he added now this is the case with a this is judge robert c jones and it
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.120]  was the hagi case or hagi case is hage i'm not sure exactly how they pronounce that
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:37.280]  but he said this he said in the present case the government's actions over the past two
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:43.520]  decades shocked the conscience of the court he said the government may not abuse is discretion
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:49.160]  and refusing to renew or in revoking a grazing privilege this is a federal judge speaking
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:54.040]  last summer he said he went on to say the government has abused its discretion in the
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:58.480]  present case through a series of actions designed to strip the estate the hagi estate because
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:05.040]  his fellow had had died of its grazing permits and ultimately to strip defendants of their
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:10.120]  ability to use their water rights so you understand that what he's talking about is a government
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:14.880]  that is out of control a government that is stripping people of their property rights
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:19.680]  when it is not in their authority to do so their grazing rights their water rights that
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:24.480]  is what they were talking about the bundy family never said they owned the land that's
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:30.080]  one of the simplest lies to dispel here and as i mentioned before in many places you'll
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:35.240]  buy property for your home and the mineral rights will not convey and of course there
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.480]  was a big fight about the mineral rights we have pointed this out we pointed it broke
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:44.080]  the story last week last friday that harry reid was very much involved in surface rights
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:49.360]  and solar rights and mineral rights and there's been research around there to get gold and
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:56.240]  platinum as well as as oil but it was the mitigation rights so that they could go forward
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:02.640]  with these solar projects it was sweetheart deals for the chinese energy company enn harry
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:09.280]  reid was involved in that it was harry reid and his son who brokered a deal for that same
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:15.160]  chinese energy company and this is a done deal gave them nine thousand acres now if you don't
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:20.240]  live in the country you can't even imagine how big nine thousand acres is sold it to
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:25.280]  them for ten cents on the dollar ten cents on the dollar at the same time they're telling
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:29.600]  the bundy family and all the rest of the ranchers there were like fifty three ranchers there
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.800]  everyone's been driven out by these tactics they reduce the size of their business by
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.440]  ninety percent if you have a business could you keep your business going if somebody just
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:45.680]  came in and by fiat cut it down to ninety percent tomorrow if you're living off of a
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:51.760]  wage as a worker what if somebody were to cut your salary by ninety percent tomorrow
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:58.160]  what would that do to you well it's put everybody out of business cliven bundy hung on he was
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.680]  the only one who was able to hang on but that's what we're talking about here we're talking
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.800]  about broad things we're talking about property rights in general we're talking about civil
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:13.440]  liberties in general we're talking about corrupt politicians who are doing insider trading
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.840]  using their sons and he has several sons that are involved in this lobbyist group it's not
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:21.880]  just rory he's even got a son-in-law i think it's like three other sons besides him and
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:27.120]  a son-in-law involved in this law firm in novata that's doing sweetheart deals and not
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:33.200]  just with the chinese corporate capitalists they're also doing it with other giant corporations
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.680]  and they've already broken just broke ground on another solar project first solar but there's
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:43.200]  solar projects all over that area and they all want to use the bundy ranch as a kind of
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:48.960]  carbon tax credit as a solar mitigation area and they're using the same tactic that they
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:55.200]  always do environmental species water rights and climate change in this case it's a
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:02.240]  dangerous species that they're coming after the desert tortoise this is agenda 21 and you know if
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:08.720]  glenn beck had read the book that he supposedly wrote he would have seen this as agenda 21 from
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:15.120]  the very beginning he would have understood that this is the motivation behind what is happening
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:20.080]  moving people off of the land moving people off of the farms or ranches or the rural areas
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:25.840]  moving people out of the suburban areas and into 200 square foot homes in the city we're talking
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.480]  about them cutting down the allotment of the bundy family and the other ranchers down there by 90
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:35.600]  percent they want to cut down the size of your home by 90 percent you're living in a 2000 square
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:42.560]  foot home for example you want they want everybody in a 200 square foot home and i would say it's a
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.600]  90 percent reduction most people if they got a single family home it's it's probably 1500 to 2000
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:53.760]  square feet they want you living in something that is a tenth that size that's where this is headed
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:58.400]  that's what everybody needs to understand i'll read you one more thing from judge jones and he
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:03.840]  wrote that the government did not bring christ criminal misdemeanor trespass claims against this
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:11.120]  rancher hagi this is a decision from last summer it's a different case but in the same area same
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:16.160]  issues involved they also came after him about trespassing he said they didn't claim him
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:20.720]  claimed that he was criminally trespassing because it believed the federal government believed that
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:26.560]  it could not satisfy the burden of proof in a criminal trespass action as a previous criminal
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:33.440]  action against this rancher ewayne hagi had been reversed and the court of appeals do you understand
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:39.280]  that all this stuff about trespass cattle all this stuff about who owns the land it's not about who
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.080]  owns the land it's about who owns the rights the grazing rights the water rights that were established
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:50.400]  there it's also about saying that they did not have criminal trespass rights they had lost that
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:55.440]  when they tried it against another rancher so what they do they sent down and let's get that clip
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:16:02.960]  from rand paul they sent down an army an army of blm agents who were pointing rifles at people
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:07.440]  all week attacking people all week and when protesters went down there to get the cattle that
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:14.240]  they had stolen they were threatening to shoot the protesters let's play this comment from rand paul
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:19.760]  he's talking about harry reid calling the peaceful protesters against the police state domestic
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:26.560]  terrorists and this is a real i think intellectual and constitutional and legal debate but it
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:31.840]  shouldn't be about violence of arms and i hope that the government will not be there in full
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:36.480]  arms and provoke a showdown and something terrible will happen i hope that doesn't happen well isn't
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:41.200]  that what what the stage is being set for and maybe because of what what senator reid had just
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:46.480]  said he not only called the bundy family domestic terrorists the supporters the people who believe
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.480]  in in whatever is going on out there if they're on the bundy side they're domestic terrorists as
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:55.600]  well doesn't that sound like he's setting it up for maybe some more military action maybe bringing
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:01.920]  some feds in there maybe having this escalate yeah i don't know what will happen all i know is from
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:07.120]  my perspective i have a legal solution to this i have a bill that i introduced last year and i
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:12.880]  believe the senator from nevada senator heller is a sponsor of this bill this would give states more
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:18.320]  control over the land and more control over the endangered species act i would like to see the
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:24.960]  governor of nevada and the state legislature of nevada be in charge of trying to help preserve
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:31.200]  species but also where cattlemen and ranchers needs nobody in washington's really knows anything
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:36.800]  about ranching or grazing of cattle or the long history that's gone on with this we need to take
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:42.000]  this out of the hands of washington but let's have a rational debate without violence without
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.800]  incitement on either side but i have a bill that would actually fix this problem it's been in the
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:52.560]  hopper for over a year we should ask senator to read if he'll let me have a vote on it absolutely
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:58.800]  he understands the issue he understands that we have out of control bureaucracies there is nobody
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:03.120]  ever been on any ballot that i've seen from the bureau of land management i don't get a chance to
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:10.400]  vote for them and yet they're writing laws they're creating taxes they're sending armies against us
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:17.200]  we have swarms of officers who are eating out our people's substance they have become abusive of our
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:24.640]  rights and we have not only a right but a duty to alter or abolish governments like that we have
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:29.760]  out of control alphabet agencies rand paul has talked about this before i hope that bill goes
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.600]  through and that is something that's in the constitution that's another legal argument
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:39.920]  that we need to have the enclave clause article one section eight clause 17 says that the federal
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.160]  government will only have 10 square miles of the country and that's for the district of colombia
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:51.680]  and whatever they need as forts and as arsenals things like that clearly never designed to own
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:57.920]  millions of acres of land and do what they're doing with it which is basically using it as
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:03.280]  their private fiefdoms trading it off to giant corporations to foreign governments so that they
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:08.640]  can make money under the table now let me read you one more thing because there was a no fly zone
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:13.360]  put over this area unprecedented that they would put something up like that and unprecedented that
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:18.160]  they would let it last for 30 days now i haven't seen whether or not this has been taken down since
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:22.560]  everything happened last week of course harry reid says it's not over so maybe that is still
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:27.200]  standing but that's typically the type of thing they do when the president is visiting an area
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:32.480]  i want to read you this story that was from an interview with der spiegel online and this is
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:36.720]  from a drone operator who admits that he was ordered to kill countless innocent citizens
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:41.840]  including children he says after six years in the air force he's starting to open up about the
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:48.080]  psychological toll that is taken on him he says this is brandon bryant 27 from missoula montana
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:53.200]  who kills scores venison's and we're going to be right back i want you to read what he said about
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:58.080]  that you're going to want to hear this especially if you're in the military or law enforcement

[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:31.440]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and we've been talking about the breaking news
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:36.000]  now of course all joseph watson who was on the show earlier was talking about the white house
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.440]  counter terror chief saying that confrontational children could be terrorists now at the same
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:46.080]  time we just had a story yesterday at the top of drugs showing that hillary clinton says that she's
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:50.400]  going to be a grandmother you know i didn't even know that monica lawinsky was pregnant but i guess
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.920]  she's going to be a grandmother she can play that loving role just in time for the 2016 her child
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:02.000]  would be this adorable two-year-old about that time and her grandchild and so that'll be a nice
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.280]  little diversion for people to get people to vote for her because you know it's all about identity
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:12.880]  it doesn't really matter about issues anymore or does it i think it does that's the discussion
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:16.640]  we're going to have what was happening here what was really an issue and of course the other big
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:24.160]  story that we've been covering is harry reid talking about characterizing the people that were at the
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.960]  peaceful protest against the police state there at the bundy ranch calling them domestic terrorists
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.960]  let's let's hear it straight from the turtle's mouth go ahead play it i can't even mind what
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:40.000]  happened up there there were hundreds hundreds of people from around the country that came there
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:47.280]  uh they had sniper rifles on the freeway yeah they had assault weapons that was the government wasn't
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:51.840]  it harry and as the one of the former sheriff's from arizona said and we had children and women
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:56.800]  lined up because what we if anybody got hurt we want to make sure they got hurt first because
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:01.920]  we want the federal government hurting women and children this is the deal and it's not a good one
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:09.360]  so these people will hold themselves out to be patriots or not they're nothing more than domestic
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:14.880]  terrorists and i think that we are a country that people should follow the law and what went up in
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:22.480]  mesquite is not very good i repeat what went up there is domestic tourism okay domestic terrorism
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:27.680]  not tourism there we go that's harry reid saying that what happened there was domestic
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:32.960]  terrorist terrorism putting the lie out that uh women and children were being put up front there
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:37.120]  weren't no children put up front uh there were women that were walking amongst the crowd the
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:41.920]  crowd had been there for quite some time being threatened by the government to be shot the
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:47.520]  entire time nobody was threatening the government i've seen pictures of one guy up on the overpass
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:53.120]  that had a gun there were swat teams down there not only pointing guns at people who were unarmed
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:57.600]  down below but threatening to shoot if they did not leave the area but they would not leave the
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:04.160]  area it was either get the cattle or be the cattle that was really the issue that was there but if
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:11.040]  he's going to characterize these people as domestic terrorists then what does that imply does that imply
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:17.200]  that they could use drones to shoot the crowd next time let's talk to uh let's take a look at what a
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:22.000]  former drone operator is saying and i was talking about this in the last segment this is a guy who
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.600]  was a drone operator this is an interview that's from uh spiegel online brandon bryant 27 from
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:33.600]  mesula montana said that he killed scores of innocence that's what he said he could not take
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:38.480]  orders anymore after following orders to shoot and kill a child in afghanistan you want to talk about
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:43.760]  really what's going on with children harry let's talk about this policy that you and obama and many
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:48.560]  republican support he knew that following the orders was wrong but the very fact that he had been
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:53.440]  ordered to murder people who was clear to him were innocent it told him that he was fighting
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:59.840]  for some very bad people he said the very first time i fired a drone missile he said i killed
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:05.520]  two men instantly and cried all the way home i felt disconnected from humanity for almost a week
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:13.840]  i saw men women and children die these moments are now like in slow motion
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:21.520]  he said at one point he saw a flash on the screen this is straight out of the movie that was entered
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:27.920]  into the paul revere contest american drone by yohan do toyed i i'm saying his name correctly
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:34.000]  apologize uh yohan if i didn't get it du to it exactly out of the movie he sees a flash on the
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.960]  screen an explosion a building collapsing on a child right next to it and he said he had a sick
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:43.760]  feeling in his stomach and just like in the movie he said did we just kill a kid he asked a drone
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:51.280]  operator next to him and the other drone operator coldly said yeah i guess that was a kid now he
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:58.720]  says he can't just switch and go back to a normal life see there really are bad guys who really are
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:04.640]  shooting children and they are people who are pushing the buttons and executing the policies
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:10.480]  remote control from washington and it won't be that long before they start doing that to people
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:16.640]  in the us they had drones out there some people reported they definitely had a helicopter there
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:23.520]  they definitely had a fixed wing plane that was circling the area they had set the area up as a
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:27.760]  no fly zone those aerial pictures that you see of the shooter on the bridge he was such a threat to
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:33.120]  them they would have taken him out instantly he was a sitting duck they were the only ones who had
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.960]  air support we're going to be right back we're going to take your calls and we're going to talk
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:44.000]  about something that happened in iran with a bank and a plane from america reported by the new york

[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.800]  with the muzzle of a swat officer's rifle they let them in the area they told them they could come
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:29.360]  in and now they're coming in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people we're not turning

[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:45.760]  buying spree and of course it's hollow point bullets ammunition that is banned by the geneva
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:50.320]  convention for use from one army to another but of course they can use those hollow point

[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:40.080]  of 1907 she said what she found and looking at the archives of each president is that through many
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:46.320]  events and periods particular banks were in constant contact with the white house and not
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:50.800]  just about financial and economic issues she said but also about aspects of world war one or world
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:57.200]  war two or the cold war she points out that morgan bank funded 75 percent of the financing
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:02.640]  for the allied forces during world war one and of course was very heavily involved in wilson who
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:07.440]  pushed us into that war she talks about world war two when isonhower became president of the cold
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:12.560]  war she says uh what bankers did then was they opened up hubs in areas like cuba in areas like
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:16.640]  beirut and lebanon where the u.s. also wanted to gain a stronghold and their cold war fight against
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:22.400]  the soviet union and so the juxtaposition of finance and foreign policy were very much aligned
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:27.920]  and then she also points out about the bush family and their connections in world war two the guardians
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:32.960]  obtained confirmation from a newly discovered files in the u.s. national archives at a firm of
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:38.560]  which prescott bush was director was involved in the finance and was involved with financial
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:45.200]  architects of nazism of course that's brown brothers harem and the father of george h.w. bush
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:50.240]  the father of george the second and the the great grandfather of george the second and the great
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:56.640]  grandfather of george the third george p bush who's now running for office here in texas so we
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:04.240]  see that happen we also know that uh german bankers set up linen and the communist revolution so i
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:08.720]  thought it was very interesting read read this history it's a very long article up on info wars
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:14.400]  it's from washington's blog bankers are behind the war behind the wars so i saw this story from
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:20.320]  the new york times it came out yesterday and it says iran gets an unlikely visitor an american
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:26.720]  plane but no one seems to know why now this is witnessed by a new york times reporter who was
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:32.560]  in the capital of iran tehran on tuesday morning iran had an unlikely visitor a plane owned by the
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:38.560]  bank of utah the community bank in ogden that has 13 branches throughout the state bearing a small
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:43.520]  american flag on its tail the aircraft was parked in a highly visible section of the airport in
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:48.640]  tehran now this is the new york times you can believe them a lot of people would discount it
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.880]  snopes would discount it if we reported this but this is the new york times and i do believe this
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:57.680]  frankly i do believe it uh and a lot of people who would normally push back on this they they
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:01.760]  probably want hopefully now listen to some of the other things that are interesting about this
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:07.360]  that plane is held in a trust by a bank in utah one of the executives at the bank said we have no
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:11.920]  idea why the plane was at the airport now the new york times asked the treasury department's
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:19.280]  office of foreign assets control who is enforcing sanctions against iran what was an american plane
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:25.040]  doing there a plane that belongs to an american bank uh they declined comment they then asked the
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:32.640]  iranian officials they also declined comment because you see if an american plane is going to go to
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:38.080]  iran when it's under sanctions it would have to have prior approval from the u.s government
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:44.160]  now it gets very interesting because uh they follow this trail they can't get anybody to
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:50.240]  say what it's doing there but we know what has historically happened we know that bankers are
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:55.600]  behind the wars it's just one more evidence of that and it brings up a question as to uh
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:01.680]  what's going to change now in iran who knows but we also know what's going on here in america we
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:07.040]  know that there is a graft and corruption that is behind this agenda 21 type movement that we see
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:14.080]  developing in nevada we see that it's being spun by people as they were trespassers they didn't
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:17.680]  own the property they never said they owned the property they owned grazing rights they owned
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:23.600]  water rights they were not trespassing we just had a court decision from another federal judge
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:30.960]  last summer similar case with a rancher similar rights they tried to get him on trespass charges
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:36.560]  it was thrown out by a federal appeals court this federal judge last summer said he was ashamed
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:43.040]  of the federal courts of the federal actions that the bureaucracies took it's exactly what is
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:48.080]  happening here people need to understand that property rights are fundamental to our civil
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:54.080]  rights and they're able to divide people based on left and right alliances who don't really understand
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:59.920]  that but uh i wanted to play where this is really headed now it's escalated even more
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:05.040]  the beginning of the week you just had some of the media led by glenn beck trying to hang the
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:12.320]  label of sovereign citizen on the bundy family and that was never what he was saying glenn beck
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:16.960]  and the people that work for him know very well or at least they certainly should know by now
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:22.800]  that when you call somebody a sovereign citizen if you ask somebody as they did are you a member
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:28.000]  of the sovereign citizen movement because that's what i hear you say when they do that they are
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:34.080]  labeling him as a domestic terrorist and harry reid has picked up that narrative listen to what he
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:42.320]  said yesterday so these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not they're nothing more
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:48.160]  than domestic terrorists and i think that we are a country that people should follow the law and what
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:54.320]  went up in mesquite is not very good i repeat what went up there is domestic tourism okay
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:43:00.080]  they're domestic terrorism not tourism yeah he repeated that a couple of times just to make
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:05.280]  sure that you get that just like glenn beck early in the week kept repeating the sovereign citizen
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:09.840]  label you hang that on somebody they have been training for years with law enforcement that
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:15.200]  anybody they label as a sovereign citizen is someone who is an immediate threat to law enforcement
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:20.720]  that's what was the dangerous game that he was playing earlier this week glenn beck now we see
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:24.720]  harry reid picking up the narrative and calling everybody there domestic terrorists let's take
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:29.840]  some of your calls here we got paul in new jersey you wanted to talk about the attack on farms go
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:36.720]  ahead yeah well we've been taking over a long time ago hundred years anniversary last year the
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:42.480]  banker takeover that's right that's right and we we are essentially communists and don't know it
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:49.680]  yep you know i agree income tax you got uh oh it's it's unbelievable but paul are you a farmer
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:57.600]  huh are you a farmer paul now i'm a farmer in the city okay but the farmer in spirit good yeah well
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:02.800]  but uh see what what happened is the income tax is actually unlawful according to you know
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:08.080]  anybody with an occupation talk to a lawyer in the chief are not liable for that tax
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:14.160]  but they interrupt you once you sign that 1040 form on the penalty of pergery you are accepting
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:18.560]  the tax yeah you know we had an interesting story here that i'd let off with at the beginning of
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:23.760]  the first hour where donnell rumsfeld said this week uh the day before everybody filed their returns
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:28.480]  on the 15th he said on the 14th he said every year i send my taxes to the irs and i enclose the
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:33.840]  letter saying i have no idea whether or not this is true or not so he saw evidently he signs because
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:37.760]  they would come back and make it maybe they don't make donald rumsfeld sign his tax forms because
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:42.800]  you know most of these guys they don't make pay taxes either but he he said that they're uh known
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:46.800]  unknowns that he doesn't really know it's too complicated he can't decide about that this is
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:51.120]  a guy who's supposed to be pretty smart he was secretary of defense twice he's both the youngest
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:55.360]  and the oldest secretary of defense we had and yet he says he can't understand what's going
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:01.200]  on with that but we see the federal government coming after people who don't want to be compelled
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:05.120]  to make a signed confession of anything because we have constitutional protections against that
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:09.680]  but that doesn't stop them does it paul another thing is you've got to get a film called freedom
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:15.920]  to fascism and i'll tell you all about the income tax yeah yeah it's unlawful but they
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:22.880]  in traffic with the ucc yeah we had a case uh just this last november where lady did not want to sign
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:28.880]  her income tax return the irs filled it out and actually the number that they came up with was
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:34.960]  zero and uh but she still refused to say it they took her to court and they had the judge actually
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:40.400]  tell the jury they were going to hold them in uh hold her in contempt they said the judge told them
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:44.400]  it doesn't matter if what i'm telling you is unlawful it doesn't matter if what i'm telling
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:49.760]  you is unconstitutional do it or you're going to be in contempt well this is the way we roll it back
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:56.480]  we heard earlier that uh judge andrew napolitano said the people are not the servants the people
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:02.800]  are the masters well how do we do that we have to get mastery of the law that's how we have to do
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:08.640]  that well how do we get mastery of the law if we've got bureaucracies in and washington that are
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:14.880]  never elected so you can't unelect them they're unaccountable they persist between republican
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:19.360]  administrations going to democrat administrations and on and on and on they're there forever they're
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:23.360]  writing their own laws they're writing their own regulations which have the force of law
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:29.920]  they're now up to like 20 28 000 pages a few years ago a guy wrote an article in one of the
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:34.960]  publications the 10 000 commandments it's way beyond that now it's home it's approaching 30 000
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:40.560]  commandments from the government how do we get these people under control i think one of the
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:46.240]  key things we have to do because we cannot count on some hero captain america to get elected president
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:52.080]  we can't even count on that at the federal level we have to exercise the division of power that we
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:58.880]  have as the people in juries we have to demand we have to request jury trials and we have to
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:05.280]  stand for each other just as people stood for cliven bundy at the ranch about his property
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:11.040]  stood with him about his rights we have to stand for each other we have to not be intimidated by
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:16.080]  these judges who are illegally instructing people that they are not to judge the law but only the
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:23.120]  facts as presented to them you were there as a juror to judge and to see that justice is done
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:28.160]  and if that means that you're going to strike down and ignore an unconstitutional law or
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:32.560]  a penalty that you think is draconian you have an obligation to do it and that's exactly what
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:37.840]  happened in that tax trial and they had one juror that's all it takes one out of 12 about eight
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:44.000]  percent to stand up to that and say no that's what we have to do there was a very few number of
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.400]  people relatively that were there at the bundy ranch and of the people that were there most of
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:52.800]  them were up on the overpass they weren't down at the bottom but a few people if they're determined
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:58.800]  to stand up for the right thing can do it thank you paul let's go to billy in california billy you
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:06.720]  got something to say about the bundy situation hey you doing david night um i wanted to talk about
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:12.320]  on monday you had said something about how uh when the rhetoric was coming out from the mainstream
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:16.480]  media like don't go out there you know you guys are going to cause uh you're going to cause a
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:21.120]  revolutionary war you're going to cause a civil war you're going to cause shooting and violence
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:26.160]  you would rather the point that says don't listen to that because that's just a bunch of rhetoric
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:31.840]  to make people it to give us like a chilling effect yes and it clicked when you said that
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:37.200]  that reminds me the whole snowden thing was the whole snowden thing a big false flag just to give
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:42.240]  us a chilling effect so the government can tell us now openly we know what you're doing we're
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:47.760]  following you we're doing facial scans we're doing all these uh we're looking at your emails
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:53.520]  i mean it seems like it was a big false flag well you know you always have to worry about things
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:58.320]  like that and you know we had these reports that were coming out from homeland security saying uh
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:03.520]  they're they're just going to stand down and give you guys a cattle because they just want to get
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:07.120]  everybody's cell phone numbers they want to get everybody's pictures and the database it's like
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:11.920]  come on they're already doing that we already know that they're doing that if that's the lesson
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:16.560]  we're going to take from the snowden leaks that uh we need to stand down because they're watching
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:22.800]  us we've lost we've lost we've lost our backbone we've lost our dignity as human beings we have
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:26.960]  to stand up that's when they say that they're looking at what we're doing and they say they're
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:32.720]  monitoring us they say they're putting us on lists that's all the more reason to get in their faces
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:37.680]  we have to take this back we cannot be intimidated about this whatever their motivations were
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:44.400]  certainly the government wants us to know that they are watching us that's a large part of what's
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:49.200]  going on with all of this they want to intimidate people they're always doing predictive programming
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:53.760]  they do it through the movies they do it through press releases they can do it through leaks many
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:59.040]  people have said that they believe that that's what's behind this may very well be the question is
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:04.880]  what are we going to do with the information a lot of people will criticize info wars for exposing
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:11.440]  what their plans are what they're doing we have to wake people up to see what's going on and if
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:16.240]  their lesson is that they're going to back down and not doing anything that's that's not acceptable
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:21.360]  we have to stand up and and that's the thing about the bundy ranch that they got me excited was that
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:27.120]  people finally stood up and took to take back their rights thank you billy in california let's go

[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:13.200]  led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:18.480]  states and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the
[01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:24.400]  key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:30.320]  be healthy i then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:33.040]  store the pro pure traveler is 25 off today is the last day of that sale now you know one of the
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:36.960]  things that i realized standing out there in the sun for the long time that we were there was one
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:43.600]  of the most vital things for your survival is water you can't go very long without water we have a
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:49.920]  very complicated very fragile infrastructure if you're going to make preparations in case something
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:54.720]  happens to the infrastructure and you should one of the key things you need to do is prepare
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:55:01.200]  for your water needs to make sure you've got a clean source of water and even before the infrastructure
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:06.960]  collapses and let's hope that it doesn't it still filters out fluoride and if you're on well water
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:10.960]  it gets rid of glyphosate because that's something you really need to worry about if you're on well
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:16.400]  water because people they were using roundup that's the chemical and roundup that can seep down and
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:23.440]  get its way into the water supply system so today pro pure traveler 25 off this is the last day
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:29.520]  and you'll find that at our store now i was just talking to kody in utah and we had to go to a
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:36.480]  commercial break kody go ahead tell the audience what you were thinking well i was thinking um i i
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:42.720]  had listened i've been following the cliven bundy story for a little while now and um i had listened
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:49.520]  to the show on monday uh and and then i listened to the glenn beck show later that day and glenn
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:54.320]  beck uh it's just you know it's just been really bothering me how he's been you know trying to
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:56:01.200]  deface us and deface uh any peaceful movement and and call it you know the saying that we're the
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:07.760]  violent ones that you know we weren't pointing any guns at anybody we had guns pointed at us you know
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:14.640]  it's just funny how he can cowardly say that we we're the ones that are portraying this deadly
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:19.760]  revolution he was asking what what are we going to do even if we did have a revolution what what
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:24.480]  will we even do you know i was very surprised at the tack that he took he had an article early in
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:30.640]  the week that was seven points that he went down every single one of them sounded like the talking
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:36.880]  points from bureau of land management uh press releases that i had gone to they had teleconferences
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:41.200]  and we listened to their stuff and it was like this this is not what's going on at all this is
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:45.760]  just mindless propaganda he was repeating that stuff and going beyond it as i mentioned he
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:50.480]  hung the label of sovereign citizen on mr bundy which is not at all what he was saying he was saying
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:56.560]  that the local law enforcement is sovereign there and that's as texas representative stockman has
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:00.480]  pointed out that's what the federal law says that if they're going to go in and use force anywhere
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:07.360]  they need to contract with local law enforcement to get this done but uh it wasn't just in that area
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:13.200]  it was like are you seriously defending harry reid and saying he's not involved in graft and
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:19.200]  corruption look at the enn deal for 9 000 acres where enn got that for ten cents on the dollar
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:23.760]  that's a done deal and you can look at all of these solar mitigation plants the fact that they
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:29.360]  pointed directly to the bundy ranch as essentially their carbon credit for these solar projects
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:34.800]  harry reid has revived the enn project in the past when it was faltering he may do that again
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:39.920]  maybe that's what he was talking about when he said it's not over who knows but he came out and
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:44.000]  he stepped it up again let's let's play that clip real quick for people the one where he accuses
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:51.600]  people of being domestic terrorists so these people who hold themselves out to be patriots
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:57.280]  are not they're nothing more than domestic terrorists and i think that we are a country
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:03.280]  that people should follow the law and what went up in the ski is not very good i repeat what went
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:08.640]  up there is domestic tourism okay there domestic there you go there you go domestic terrorism
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:12.640]  of course that was a narrative that was being sold on glenn vex channel one of the things that
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:18.320]  really amazed me was that one of his six seven talking points one of them was this is about the
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:24.640]  turtles if he had read the book that has his name on it about agenda 21 he would know that agenda 21
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:29.040]  is part of this but he didn't present anything fairly in that very disappointing we're going
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:40.560]  to be right back we're going to take some more of your calls right after the break stay tuned
[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:47.600]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network

[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:47.120]  is good friday we're gonna talk in a little bit about what role does god have in this country
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:53.040]  i saw something that i want to relay to you and and it's part of this larger story about
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:57.760]  what was going on what were people planning what were people strategizing we're gonna
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:02.240]  talk about that when we come back in the next segment but i wanted to keep taking some calls
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:06.800]  here i've got uh root boy in new york you said you wanted to respond to an article
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:16.240]  yeah david hi uh codename root boy calling from delta bravo section of uh central new york
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:24.080]  uh i have two questions uh number one uh you know for our liberty renaissance here we really
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:30.800]  only have two choices uh for right now and maybe a third of jesse gets in uh and unfortunately we
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:37.600]  have to compete in the uh in the matrix of the uh left right paradigm and that's the republicans
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:45.120]  you know you on the floor uh the ground floor of uh of the uh the battle last week
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:52.240]  you know in that fox news interview uh you know rad paul played some lip service you know at the
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:59.200]  beginning of the interview and then he says oh what what com commerheads prevail and then his
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:06.480]  answer in the sound bite was that i have a bill in the hopper and so my question to you uh
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:12.880]  mr david night you know who's there with uh uh black uniform contractors sniper rifles trained
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:20.000]  on you i mean is that enough well i'll be happy for anything that gets done like that and and
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:26.800]  ram paul has had uh bills introduced in the past he had a read it write it and uh something else
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:30.480]  bill like i can't remember it exactly now but basically you know we're going to make sure that
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:34.640]  that the bills are actually read we're going to give people enough time to to read them before they
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:40.400]  sign them and and certainly we want to see things happening there but as i said before you know we
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:46.400]  could elect captain america to be president and it isn't going to solve the problem the bureaucracies
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:50.880]  are way out of control and it isn't just the bureau of land management they're just a good example of
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:55.920]  it but we have this being done by the epa we've got it being done by fish and wildlife we've got it
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:02.560]  being done by uh the irs uh you know whatever agency you are involved with and and one of the
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:07.520]  bundy brothers was there he said hey i don't have a ranch i work selling time shares in los vegas he
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:12.320]  goes i've seen government regulations making it impossible for us to do business because we've
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:17.120]  got to report everything to them this is the oppression what is going to get us out of it
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:21.680]  is i think we can take direct action with jury nullification personally that's that's where i have
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:26.960]  the most hope it's going to have to be done at the state level but it's more importantly it's
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:32.960]  going to be done by the people we have to get people to understand what the issues are and get
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:38.720]  upset about the police state because that's what it ultimately comes down to whether it's harry
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:44.480]  reid forcing some poor rancher out of his farm so that he can help these crony capitalists these
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:50.320]  global capitalists whatever his motivation is whether they're enforcing agenda 21 whatever
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:57.200]  where the rubber meets the road is when they send out these these militarized police forces from
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:02.240]  these bureaucracies and yes we're going to have to stand up to them we're going to have to to
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:07.680]  peacefully protest them and stand up to them we need to make sure we do not lose a second amendment
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:15.040]  that is a deterrent it is a peaceful deterrent just as we had nuclear weapons as a deterrent
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:21.200]  against nuclear war during the cold war we need to make sure that i don't want to see a nuclear
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:25.600]  option happening i don't want to see it break out into that nobody wanted to see a nuclear war
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:31.920]  happen between the us and between russia and we don't want to see it happen again now either but
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:36.160]  that's what we have to do and we have to realize that there are certain things that we can do
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:41.520]  like jury nullification very very powerful we don't have to beg any elected representatives
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:47.360]  about that at the state local or federal level we can do it ourselves get on a jury stand up for
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:52.080]  your for your fellow man's justice for his individual rights we're going to be right back
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:55.360]  or take some more calls thank you root boy from new york we'll be right back

[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:45.680]  a couple of different issues here for a moment uh we've got we had a caller in the last segment
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:52.720]  that was saying what do we do to take this back uh can we elect somebody like ram paul he was concerned
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:58.480]  that uh ram paul wasn't coming out quickly enough coming out strongly enough about this look he came
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:04.400]  back and i'm happy if he's going to introduce a bill we need to find people though that are going to
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:10.560]  stand up for what we already have as rights and i'm not saying that ram paul's not doing that but
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:15.760]  we have the authority to stand up for these rights and ultimately it comes down to us so
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:20.080]  what are we going to do about it well of course one of the things that we can do is during
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:24.560]  nullification as i mentioned before and you know this is the the week that most people
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:30.400]  filled out their tax forms and sent them in and we had uh donald rumsfeld saying that he wasn't
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:34.320]  comfortable signing that form because he didn't really understand the taxes were too complicated
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:40.160]  he really didn't understand it he understood that he was incriminating himself so he attached a letter
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:46.480]  i don't know if that would stand up in the irs's court or not and you of course do not get a trial
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:50.560]  unless they're coming after you for something criminal but they do treat it as criminal and
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:56.880]  if you do not sign your tax case your tax form in many cases and as i pointed out we just had a case
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:04.000]  last november and uh it was a woman doreen hindrickson and they tried to jail her because she owed
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:10.400]  no taxes she owed zero taxes but she did not want to fill out sign the form that they had filled out
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:17.760]  and the amazing the amazing court order and this is what the judge said told the jury that it is not
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:23.040]  a defense to the crime of contempt that the court order was unlawful or unconstitutional
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:27.920]  think about that so in other words that's what we're hearing from so many people who are criticizing
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:33.040]  what happened at the bundy ranch it's like hey that's the government's land and the government said
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:38.000]  to do this and it's like so just get on your knees and bow down and do whatever they say
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:44.720]  you should not think about or challenge the fact that it was unconstitutional or unlawful now we
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:50.720]  are seeing some victories at the local level and i think that there's really more that can be done
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:55.200]  not only with jury nullification but also at the state and local level and we see some
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:02.400]  some movement in the states for instance and vermont this was just yesterday the vermont senate
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:08.480]  approved gmo labeling bill and it's going to send it back to the house for a final vote if this goes
[02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:13.520]  through in the house of representatives of vermont vermont would be the first state in the country
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:18.880]  to require labeling of foods made with genetically modified organisms and the people they're
[02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:26.480]  protesting one of them's got a sign says label gmo's let me decide see we can make those decisions
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:32.400]  ourselves we don't need a nanny state in washington we just need to know what's in the food that we're
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:37.280]  getting and of course the corporates who are running the government don't want that to happen
[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:43.360]  they've shut that down in many states shut it down in california they have tried to shut it down
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:49.840]  in washington now vermont is going out saying we have a right to know what is in our food
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:53.520]  and then they can make the decision whether or not they want to do it we also see this
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:58.800]  maryland governor signs a marijuana decriminalization bill that also happened just a couple of days
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:03.920]  ago now this is a bill that's going to change some of the things involved in medical marijuana
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:09.440]  but it is also going to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana so the federal government
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:16.000]  is pushing ahead with their illegal drug wars they have no authority to prohibit anything folks
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:21.680]  they had to have a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol where is the constitutional
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:26.640]  amendment to prohibit marijuana where is the constitutional amendment to prohibit anything
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:33.360]  where's the constitutional amendment that's going to prohibit drugs for uh cancer patients who are
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:37.680]  on death row and they want to make the decisions about their life whether or not they take those
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:45.200]  drugs or not a lot of people need medical marijuana it really really makes me sick to see so many people
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:50.960]  who should be defending christians many christians they're so concerned about marijuana that they
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:57.680]  will deny it to people who are gravely ill and not allow them to have medical marijuana how can
[02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:03.760]  they shut off that compassion it's not even legal we have to get out of this slavish mentality to
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:10.560]  government in tennessee they just had a bill to nullify federal hip ban that was just signed
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:15.200]  by the governor there i believe it's gone to that point it says it's moved forward this was on
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:21.680]  april the 10th um and so maybe it is not past just yet but is on the on the docket looks like it's
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:27.680]  going to pass if it hasn't and here's the thing it's going on in michigan as well rand paul has
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:34.480]  introduced in kentucky bills that would legalize hemp hemp has such a small amount of thc and
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:41.920]  if it's got any at all that you can't use it as a psychoactive drug it is simply competition for
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:48.240]  pharmaceutical companies for cotton companies and industries it has so many different uses
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:57.280]  and again out of fear and panic and misinformation hemp has been outlawed along with marijuana
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:02.800]  and they don't have the authority to outlaw anything that is why we have two of the 20
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:07.760]  some odd constitutional amendments in the constitution is one to make alcohol illegal
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:11.840]  and the other one to make it legal again if they had the ability to just say alcohol is
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:18.160]  illegal why did we need to have the constitutional amendment to do that and we see that people are
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:23.760]  starting to wake up take a look at what's going on with john mccain one of our favorite politicians
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:29.600]  here he has been voted the most unpopular senator in america neither republicans nor democrats
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:34.160]  trust him this is from the capitalism institute they say that he was recently censured by the
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:40.000]  arizona gop for his moderate stance and his constant compromising with obama and as examples
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:44.080]  they point out you know of course he he supported the bombing campaign in syria arming their rebels
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:50.400]  supports gun control and of course you also see him with the neo nazis and the ukraine why does
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:55.200]  why does uh the point man for all of this for the military industrial complex john mccain
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:15:02.000]  why does he always go and get his picture taken with al-qaeda and with the neo nazis well the
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:08.320]  same reason that the cia used to work with noriega before george h.w. bush started calling him strong
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:13.760]  man noriega and invaded panamot look they can go in and get these gangsters whether it's a drug
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:18.960]  dealing criminal like noriega or whether it's these whether it's al-qaeda or whether it is uh
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:23.600]  the neo nazis they can always go in work with them to overthrow the regime that they want to
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:30.160]  overthrow and then because it's so easy to make a case as to how criminal these guys are they can
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:36.320]  then easily take them out it's a perfect mob tactic and they're doing that over and over again i'm
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:41.840]  surprised these guys on the other side keep falling for that i mean but they do use the same mo
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:46.720]  over and over again whether it's false flag attacks or whether it's taking some criminal group
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:51.280]  making them your ally using them to overthrow government and then turning on that group afterwards
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:56.160]  they keep using the same mo's over and over again one last story before we go back to your calls
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:02.560]  is your home's energy meter spying on you and this is from fox news and this is a story out of
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:10.720]  where was this i'm i'm not seeing the the place where this is out but basically oh this is out
[02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:17.280]  of california and what they were concerned about is the privacy and the data and the irony of this
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:25.760]  the irony of this is that as they were protesting this the utility company there started monitoring
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:32.800]  the the meters and the privacy of the people there who are protesting them basically fulfilling
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:38.560]  their concern about it being a privacy invasion and of course there's many issues with smart meters
[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:43.840]  it's not just privacy many people have raised health issues an excellent documentary that we
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:50.080]  carry that shows the effect of these smart meters pulsing you can actually see insects on a leaf
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:57.120]  jerking as the as the smart meter is pulsing it sends out a lot of energy a lot of people have
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:01.760]  had a lot have had health problems with it but you can actually see it with the insects so
[02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:07.200]  that's a very real effect and the privacy issue is a very real effect as they're pointing here
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:11.280]  in the article they're pointing out information gathered from smart meters includes things like
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:16.720]  unencrypted data which other people can grab right details showing whether you're when you're away
[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:22.240]  from home what your typical usage when you're typically home when you're away and then also
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:28.000]  looking at what kind of activities you're engaged in do you have are you watching television how
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:33.280]  long are you spending cooking but more importantly they point out that police agencies are using
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:39.840]  this utility data to determine if suspects are maybe growing marijuana in their homes say they
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:43.440]  look at it and if they see that you've got a lot of electricity usage they think that maybe
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  you're growing marijuana at home you might be doing hydroponics we've had situations where
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:52.960]  people were growing hydroponics and all of a sudden they get SWAT teamed and in a situation like that
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:59.040]  those people are probably more likely to get killed by a SWAT team if they if they have access do
[02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:03.840]  something they think that their home is being invaded if they were really criminals that were
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:08.560]  growing marijuana and I say that lightly that's the government's definition of a crime as I mentioned
[02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:12.640]  I don't believe that's a crime should not be a crime but those people who are doing something
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:17.760]  that has been declared illegal by the government they may be expecting a SWAT team's raid so when
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:23.280]  somebody kicks in the door they keep it cool but if somebody is minding their own business not doing
[02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:27.440]  anything that they believe that the government should be concerned about and what the government
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:31.760]  is concerned about is their electricity usage we had a case just a couple of weeks ago where
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:37.840]  the police were watching hydroponic stores and followed this woman home surveilled her SWAT
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:42.640]  teamed her this has happened many many times it just happened a couple of weeks ago again but
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:47.600]  I heard these stories 20 years ago this has been going on for a very long time how do we reign in
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:53.200]  this criminal government let's go to your calls John in Texas you had something I wanted to say
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:19:03.040]  about Harry Reid go ahead hello David hi yeah I uh I was listening to Greg Paulist on a radio

[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:15.120]  this of course but Harry Reid was instrumental in acquiring the the rights to a goldmine for a
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:25.280]  Canadian corporation called Barrick yes who paid they paid a little under $10,000 to the US treasury
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:33.360]  for this goldmine which had an estimated value of ten billion dollars in gold ore well yeah

[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:29.600]  we're establishing contact with him right now and i want to get his response to what we see
[02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:37.680]  harry reid calling people who were there last week in support of their liberties and his liberties
[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:44.080]  calling them domestic terrorists we broke this story last night on info wars a the harry reid
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:48.160]  press conference let's let's run that sound clip right now guys if you can run that for me and then
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:54.800]  there's also a story that came today from a homeland security advisor and lisa monaco and
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:25:01.680]  she is now saying if your children are confrontational they might become terrorists let's play the
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:09.760]  harry reid clip so these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not there's nothing more
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:15.680]  than domestic terrorists and i think that we are a country that people should follow the law and what
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:22.800]  went up in muski is not very good i repeat what went up there is domestic tourism okay domestic
[02:25:22.800 --> 02:25:30.480]  terrorism not tourism community members saw warning signs but they didn't see them as an
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:36.800]  indicator of a problem whether it was a teacher hearing from a student that they were interested
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:43.520]  in traveling abroad to fight whether it was a parent seeing a kid being more confrontational
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:48.960]  we have to learn together and educate community members and trusted community members who can
[02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:57.840]  come uh and intervene and point that uh usually use uh to a to a different path there we go now
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:04.400]  uh we've got cliven bundy on the phone uh mr bundy thank you for joining us i'm happy to be here now
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:09.040]  i don't were you able to hear those last two clips that we played a harry reid calling you and uh
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:14.640]  everybody that was there last week domestic terrorists uh yes i did it would be funny if
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:21.680]  it wasn't so dangerous sir i don't know it don't sound very funny to me but you know i
[02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:30.640]  can say harry i guess you are right we are upset citizens and we are i guess in a riot type mood
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:36.400]  but we are doing it in a peaceful way with a lot of you know the inspiration and love
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:42.800]  and a lot of courage and that's how keville is able to face harry's army and back him down
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:49.040]  it's not because we're uh militant that's right you know uh yeah riot type thing it's because
[02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:54.880]  we're we have faith and we we're looking for freedom and liberty i have to commend you and your family
[02:26:55.680 --> 02:27:01.200]  i didn't see anybody threatening anyone else uh you know a terrorist by definition of somebody
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:07.120]  who uses fear who uses the threat of violence or you who uses violence to achieve political means
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:13.840]  you guys were not doing that uh that day we had a that saturday morning i had an eight o'clock
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:18.400]  interview with you and when i got there i was told that uh it was going to not happen because the
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:24.560]  sheriff had called and the family was in prayer and when amin came up and addressed the crowd he said
[02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:31.280]  uh we've been uh praying about this and thinking about this and uh we don't have any fear about
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:37.440]  this uh you are not going to be terrorized uh but he said and he said we don't need to take guns
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:45.280]  even to uh throughout a this so i'm asking people not to carry guns i i really admire your family's
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:53.360]  calm resolve and and uh just just backbones of steel and yet a very very meek spirit like we
[02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:59.840]  see from people like ron paul well thank you only you know that's about all i can say and you realize
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:04.720]  it's not just me it's it's not just my family there's that you know they're hundreds of people with
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:11.520]  the same attitude and the same spirit and you know that's what's so uh overwhelming is the fact
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:16.880]  that they are so many people and the spirits the same and they're yes you know they're peaceful
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:23.600]  they they're lovely lovely lovely i guess is a good expression they are lovely it really disturbs
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:29.840]  me to see the media uh people we had uh roiders building this up today the way they wrote this
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:34.560]  piece it sounded like the only people who were armed were uh the demonstrators who were there
[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:41.600]  very few if any of them were armed down in the val and the gully there and and yet never talked about
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:45.520]  the federal government being armed never talked about the federal government pointing rifles at
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:51.200]  people for the longest time and uh just essentially tried to make the federal government look like
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:57.280]  they were being uh reasonable rational and and we were an angry mob that clearly wasn't the case but
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:02.640]  i want to ask you about this because as i said i i watched your family i was very impressed with
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:08.880]  the way they conducted themselves uh you you trained them very well we just had this story
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:13.680]  break today white house counterterrorism chief and you heard this clip she was saying that
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:19.040]  confrontational children might be terrorist and she's warning people as someone in homeland
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:24.400]  security that if they're if they find their children being confrontational that uh they
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:30.880]  might grow up to be terrorists as somebody who's raised 14 children uh i want to get a a take from
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:36.560]  you right after we come back from the break uh i wonder if you ever had a child who is confrontational
[02:29:36.560 --> 02:29:41.120]  to you i bet you did see this is coming from lisa monaco she doesn't have any children but we're
[02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:45.360]  going to talk to somebody who has 14 children right after the break and i tell you he raised them

[02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:35.920]  jones show i'm david night here in austin and i have on the phone cliven bundy the man who's been
[02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:43.600]  at the center of this dispute in the vada about the cattle about grazing rights about water rights
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:49.120]  and a lot of people don't understand that mr bundy you have uh rights that are you're not claiming
[02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:53.200]  that you own the land but you do have grazing rights and you do have water rights there a lot
[02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:58.480]  of people are really spending that in a in a way that makes it sound like you're asserting ownership
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:05.200]  over all of that federal land this is a little bit confusing to people's basically in the western
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:10.880]  or eastern half of the united states because most all of that land is privately owned each you know
[02:34:10.880 --> 02:34:18.400]  by individuals in the west we have what we call public land and very little private land uh and
[02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:22.720]  of course what's happening here the united states is claiming that they own the private land or
[02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:29.360]  public land and here in the western united states we're saying these states are sovereign states
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:36.640]  come under the equal footing doctrine and with the original 13 states and they are sovereign that
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:42.480]  means that they own the land so in other words the argument here there's this state of Nevada on
[02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:48.000]  this land or does the federal government on this land and of course i say you can figure this out
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:53.680]  in about five minutes by reading the constitution of the united states there no doubt that the united
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:59.760]  states was limited very limited to the amount of property they could own and what they could do with
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:06.560]  it and the article in article one section eight clause 17 the enclave clause limits the government
[02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:10.880]  to owning land like that and and a lot of the confusion i think is coming from as you point
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:17.360]  out people in the east over here uh back east people typically have to keep their cattle confined
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:22.560]  to fences or they're liable for damage but where you are you have you operate under open range laws
[02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:28.640]  and in Nevada and the default there is that the cattle are free to go wherever and if uh
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:32.640]  they damage somebody's property if those people don't have a legal fence around their property
[02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:38.160]  even on the highway then the uh cattle owner is is not liable for that so very different
[02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:43.760]  set of laws but i wanted to get your response to this report that came out today and we we start
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:49.520]  talking about this just before the break about a homeland security advisor lisa monaco she was
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:54.720]  speaking at harvard university on tuesday and let's listen real quickly to that sound bite now
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:59.520]  i want to get your response so what kinds of behaviors are we talking about for the most part
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:06.880]  they're not related directly to actually plotting attacks they're more subtle parents might see
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:13.360]  sudden personality changes in their children at home becoming more confrontational there we go
[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:19.600]  okay now as someone who has raised 14 children have you ever seen your children as a growing old
[02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:25.200]  suddenly uh have some personality changes and become confrontational mr bundy okay the first
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:30.560]  thing i would like to say is i've enjoyed my children from the oldest the first one i've
[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:35.360]  had to the last but equally i just really enjoyed my children and you know when they're talking like
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:41.360]  this lady's talking i've seen all kinds of things i've seen my kids so fits i've seen it ball and
[02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:47.440]  scream i've seen them you know have problems with their dad and their mom and i've seen them uh you
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:54.000]  know sort of hate the world and then on the other hand i've seen them love the world and so i i've
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:37:01.200]  raised 14 of them and they all have different moves at different times and they all they're
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:06.880]  learning this is a process and i've had to kick their butts a few times and you know and i have
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:11.760]  and i've had the opportunity to love them a lot of the time this is just part of family life and
[02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:18.000]  part of normal growing up these kids are not perfect neither are their parents but this is a process
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:24.800]  that is is wonderful yes and i got to say the the calmness and the resolve as i mentioned before
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:30.800]  you've got adult children now and i think you've done a great job raising them and and one of the
[02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:37.680]  things that i really wanted to cover on this good friday is the fact that um one of the ways that
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:42.240]  they're attacking you and the people who were there was this report by someone who was not even
[02:37:42.240 --> 02:37:48.160]  there saying we were strategizing had a ploy to put women and children in the front that was not
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:53.360]  the case and he has now pulled that back and said i was never there i got there well after
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:58.800]  everything was was finished and that is true we knew that because uh you know we saw when he got there
[02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:04.240]  there that was never the case that they were strategizing to put women and children up there
[02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:10.000]  and and i've got to say you know people have attacked you for uh being a rancher for being
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:15.520]  a a Mormon for all these different things everybody is trying to divide and conquer the
[02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:21.200]  population based on demographics but i got to say that as you have pointed out the men who
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:26.240]  wrote the constitution did it on their knees and we had people who were masons they were
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:33.920]  uh deists uh some of them but they gave god the credit for what they for what he did and
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:39.360]  they appealed to god they asked him for protection we don't see that from people like
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:43.360]  mayor bloomberg who came out this week and said because he's given 50 million dollars to gun
[02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:48.720]  control groups that if there is a god he's going to go straight into heaven that's the kind of
[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:54.880]  prideful arrogance that is a stench to god more than just about anything i have seen as i read the
[02:38:54.880 --> 02:39:02.240]  bible what would you say about that well you know any success that i've had or my family's had or
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:08.880]  we the people's had we have to we're we have to give that to god because we have asked for his
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:15.520]  guidance and strength and he's given it to us you know the any other credit that would be given
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:20.160]  out here would be to we the people to not encounter me but the people here
[02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:28.240]  here with their prayers with their efforts and with their ability to have faith and and courage
[02:39:28.240 --> 02:39:33.920]  enough to stand on the line it sure not not me or my family it has to be given to god and
[02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:39.920]  those people that stood and those people that pray i don't know why else to give the credit
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:46.000]  and as ben franklin said there is a god who rules in the affairs of men and as as you pointed out as
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:50.800]  many people pointed out when this country was founded that was the mindset of the people
[02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:55.520]  they asked for help from god we had not just information warriors that's very important
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:59.920]  people understand what's going on we also need prayer warriors but let me ask you what's going
[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:04.880]  on at your ranch now we've seen reports of these cattle that were shot we've seen some pictures
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:09.920]  that might have been mass graves for cattle out there can you give us an update on the damage
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:15.840]  that was done to property out there the damage that was done to cattle yes it could but you know
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:23.600]  my main concern here and i might you know the really the emergency is that those people that
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:29.360]  pulled these guns and other these uh blm and park service people whoever they might have been
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:35.360]  who had these guns pulled on we the citizens uh you know they still have their guns and they
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:40.240]  have a gate and our county sheriff and other states and county sheriffs has allowed them to
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:46.720]  disappear into the united states and those guns have not been taken away and so that was the
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:52.480]  demand of the county sheriff before any of these things happen that said they disarm those people
[02:40:52.480 --> 02:40:58.800]  over in that government compound that he didn't do what the people asked and that's why the people
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:04.000]  had to do the quarry and then when they did get him get those people in a position to take the
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:09.520]  guns away he allowed them to go right out on a freeway and then go out into the united states
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:15.440]  across the states and counties and the media has never reported on where they went they've
[02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:20.240]  never been a county sheriff saying they're in my county we've allowed a terrible thing to
[02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:25.680]  happen in america letting those people just disappear well you know mr bundy that's what
[02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:31.280]  we've seen over and over as we follow these types of stories quite often here at info wars where we
[02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:37.520]  see police that exceed their their reasonable powers use deadly force in situations where
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:42.160]  deadly force is not warranted and they're typically doing it in the cities are typically doing it to
[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:46.960]  minorities and we see this happen over and over again and over and over again just as you saw
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:53.920]  these people leave in a convoy of 80 to 100 cars we saw them leave the police are walking away from
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:59.120]  these criminal actions unscathed over and over again and i think you're right i mean certainly
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:03.440]  the thing that the back one of the things that backed them down last week was the exposure
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:10.080]  of the fraud and the ethical issues involving harry reid but whatever their motivation
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:17.520]  everybody needs to understand that this was a peaceful protest a stand up to the police state
[02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:22.400]  and that's where we're seeing it everywhere this kind of over the top criminal behavior that we
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:26.800]  saw there and that was going on before we got out there that was going on while we were there
[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:31.600]  that is what people need to understand is that we've got these armed bureaucracies
[02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:36.160]  and we've got the federal government arming everyone from the weather service to the postal
[02:42:36.160 --> 02:42:42.000]  service to the department of education to the bureau of land management they are building armies
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:48.240]  of people who come after individuals they've had a woman a family drug out of their home
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:53.040]  in the uh in the dark of the morning because there was a mother who was no longer even living
[02:42:53.040 --> 02:42:58.240]  with a family that owed the department of education on a student loan so they swat team the family
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:43:03.280]  drug them out of their house and in the dark and put them on face down on the lawn and this is the
[02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:09.040]  kind of stuff that you were seeing happening around your ranch oh it's exactly and that's why
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:15.840]  i mean we you know so demanded that's why we demanded the sheriff to take these weapons away
[02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:21.760]  and then he didn't do it and so the people had to go and take that upon herself was a great danger
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:26.960]  but then we were we're demanding the sheriffs across the united states every county sheriff to
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:34.000]  disarm these bureaucrats please get those arms away and now i think they called now would be
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:39.520]  to remove the people to encourage her sheriff to get this done yes encourage your sheriff to get
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:45.200]  this job done because if we don't get it done in the individual counties then we're going to face
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:50.880]  all of these guns in a civil war yes we don't want to get to that point yes yes absolutely
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:55.600]  that i think is the key issue i think it is the police state that's where all the stuff comes
[02:43:55.600 --> 02:44:00.240]  together we can talk about what is motivating harry reid and what is motivating the government we
[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:04.240]  can talk about the tactics and the techniques that they're using to deceive the public whether it's
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:10.960]  agenda 21 or whether it's a delphi techniques at your local county meetings we can talk about the
[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:15.600]  graft and the corruption with major corporations i don't know if you're aware of this mr bundy but
[02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:21.280]  you know these documents specifically mentioned getting you off of your ranch so they could use
[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:28.320]  these as solar mitigation for these other solar projects they also had a grant for $400,000 from
[02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:33.200]  the walton family foundation the family foundation that came their fortune came from the walmart
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:38.800]  company so here they got a $400,000 grant that they're going to give to these uh these park
[02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:44.560]  services provided they get you off of your land i i just found that amazing to see these giant
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:50.400]  corporations teamed up to throw away yes i don't have any comment on that because i don't know
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:57.200]  but then let's let's do a little speculation is harry reid trying to cause enough trouble there with
[02:44:57.200 --> 02:45:05.520]  me and with we the people to actually say this is a police state you know this is it seems like
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:09.840]  that's what he's trying to work this all up to where the people would accept the fact that now
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:16.400]  or united states need to be a police state yes because exactly it seems like maybe harry's trying
[02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:21.600]  to push that in other words another war yes what harry wants yes because when they label you a
[02:45:21.600 --> 02:45:27.120]  domestic terrorist we know what they do to terrorists and they've already put the nda yes we
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:33.120]  we also know what some of the laws are since 9 11 you know they've strengthened this to the point
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:38.480]  that it's not anybody would qualify as a terrorist and then they take tell them they take unlimited
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:46.000]  power over with a person or a group or whatever and leave them no liberty and and basically
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:53.760]  have an unlimited uh resources and unlimited power to you know to do whatever and you know
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:59.120]  and to defeat a terrorist that's taking out yes and and and that was very troubling a couple of
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:04.240]  years ago we had both democrats and republicans voting for the national defense authorization
[02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:10.800]  act the ndaa and a new section that was put in that a couple years ago said that uh essentially
[02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:17.520]  the military could arrest anybody and hold them indefinitely indefinitely without trial and
[02:46:17.520 --> 02:46:23.600]  could transport them why because they perceived that we were at war let's play that clip from harry
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:29.760]  reid again where he tries to pull up the rhetoric here go ahead you guys have that clip we're gonna
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:35.920]  have that clip in just a second here but just yesterday harry reid was saying that uh all the
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:40.240]  people that were standing up to the police state were essentially domestic terrorists let's play
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:48.000]  that clip keep in mind what happened up there there were hundreds hundreds of people from around the
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:55.280]  country that came there uh they had sniper rifles on the freeway they had assault weapons they had
[02:46:55.280 --> 02:47:00.560]  automatic weapons and as the one of their former sheriffs in arizona said and we had children
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:05.520]  and women lined up because what we if anybody got hurt we want to make sure they got hurt first
[02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:10.320]  because we want the federal government hurting women and children this is the deal and it's not
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:17.840]  a good one so these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not they're nothing more than
[02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:23.360]  domestic terrorists and i think that we are a country that people should follow the law and
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:29.280]  what went up in muski is not very good i repeat what went up there is domestic tourism okay
[02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:35.200]  domestic terrorism well he certainly knows about terrorism because as i was just reading earlier
[02:47:35.200 --> 02:47:40.320]  there was a drone operator talking about how he was called upon to shoot men women and children
[02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:46.960]  we know that's happening abroad all the time and and of course it was not a plan of anyone and there
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:50.880]  was nothing strategized about it and in fact you can see the videos that it did not happen
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:55.040]  to have men and women or to have women and children rather on the front lines go ahead mr
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:48:00.480]  bundy you know it actually sort of makes me mad when i hear harry talk like that you know what
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:06.080]  he's done is he's put a whole bunch of things together and coming up quite a speech i mean
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:11.840]  definitely most of those things he's talking about are lies and why would our united states
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:18.320]  senator act like this in front of we the people of america why would a man do this and else he's
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:24.400]  trying to stir something up and yes it definitely not i've been around you know like three thousand
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:30.480]  people here i i've never heard anybody talk like this here on on in around me in the last couple
[02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:37.200]  weeks never nobody has ever talked like this well that's true and and and this is part of the vilification
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:41.680]  uh that they're that they're starting and this is a war that we're going to have to fight in the
[02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:46.640]  press because first they're going to try to vilify you and your supporters and uh first they
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:51.520]  assassinate your character then they try to assassinate you and i can see where this narrative
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:56.240]  is is going i mean when glenn beck was saying that uh those of us who were at the front of the gate
[02:48:56.240 --> 02:49:00.800]  and i was up there at the front because i wanted to capture what was being said between your son
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:07.520]  amin and uh this agent from the blm so i was up at the front and and we've got footage of that and
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:12.560]  people were not provoking and threatening the government it's absolutely not true what glenn
[02:49:12.560 --> 02:49:18.640]  beck is saying about that is a lie it's disinformation and what he's trying to do is to demonize the
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:22.800]  people there so that if they everybody has seen you they've seen your family they know that you're
[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:27.920]  calm and responsible individuals but what they want to try to do is to demonize the people who
[02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:32.080]  were there as supporters so they can say if something happens and they they want to initiate
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:38.800]  something they can blame it on somebody else okay now maybe i may have understood you you said glenn
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:43.760]  beck said these things or did you mean harry reed said these things glenn beck said it before harry
[02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:49.600]  reed said it i don't know if you caught it or not when you were talking to glenn beck uh and you were
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:55.280]  trying to explain that the state and the county had jurisdiction in that area glenn beck said oh
[02:49:55.280 --> 02:49:59.520]  oh now i understand this is something completely different about not paying taxes now you're saying
[02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:03.920]  that you're sovereign and then he had a guy that was there and he said are you saying uh
[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:08.960]  that you're part of the sovereign citizen movement and mr bundy you said you didn't know
[02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:15.360]  what that was let me tell you right now that the fbi has labeled the sovereign citizen movement
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:20.000]  rightly or wrongly as domestic terrorists for a long time and they've been telling law enforcement
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:26.640]  officers that people who are sovereign citizens are people who will shoot them on a heartbeat and so
[02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:30.880]  they've got law enforcement very afraid of that term when they hung that label on you he was putting
[02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:40.240]  a big target on your back well yeah i'm glad you sort of important that i didn't realize what's
[02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:46.720]  going on there but anyway uh hey can you hang on can you hang on for just one moment we've

[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:34.080]  interview that you had earlier this week and i was pointing out to you that even before harry
[02:55:34.080 --> 02:55:38.400]  reid came out with the statement yesterday about the people that were there at the ranch being
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:43.520]  domestic terrorists that as you were explaining the sovereignty issues and i know that you believe
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:48.000]  that the sovereignty belongs in the county and with the state government as opposed to federal
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:52.720]  government they spun that around and said oh you are saying that you are above the law that you
[02:55:52.720 --> 02:55:57.760]  were a sovereign citizen and one of the guys there with glimb back i don't know his name but if you
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:01.920]  look at the clip you can see it he said are you saying that you're a member of the sovereign
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:06.320]  citizens movement which is codeword for domestic terrorists for sure and you said at the time you
[02:56:06.320 --> 02:56:12.320]  didn't know anything about it did you want to address that well i could i definitely am not
[02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:20.080]  any joined with any group of terrorists yes i know i am a individual citizen when i'm talking about
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:27.600]  sovereignty and of the state i'm talking about our constitution and our state government being
[02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:34.000]  we as the sovereign people of that county and i really believe that's what our founding fathers
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:40.000]  were talking about is it being sovereign and as individuals and and of course we are sovereign
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:46.400]  here i'm a sovereign citizen of park county nevada and so yeah i am sovereign i believe in that
[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:51.920]  yes yes absolutely and i certainly we understand what you're talking about and this is not
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:59.120]  you know again it's a term that is a very hot label and it is a term that has been used for
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:04.800]  law enforcement for them to come after people and perceive them as a threat to their safety but what
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:09.840]  you're saying is is that the state of nevada should have sovereignty over this that as
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:15.920]  representative stockman congressman from texas said whenever the federal government goes out
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:22.320]  to enforce anything by to enforce any rulings or any laws they need to contract with local
[02:57:22.320 --> 02:57:27.840]  law enforcement and that's what you were saying your son amin said to the blm agent he said you
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:33.040]  have no authority here and then pointed at the sheriff and said you're the one with authority
[02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:38.000]  we will do what you said that's the attitude that i saw there i understand that's that's what you were

[03:00:51.840 --> 03:00:57.840]  and that's next november we need to vote out in vote in an all-new congress and an all-new senate
[03:00:57.840 --> 03:01:04.480]  and the people need to start volunteering and one person go to each voting voting polling place
[03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:10.160]  and take an input with data and that way if they get a good idea if the machines are rigging it
[03:01:10.160 --> 03:01:14.160]  like that we all know the machines are rigged oh yeah oh yeah that way we'll be able to compare
[03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:20.160]  the votes that actually took place to the to the so-called results and we'll know if there's fraud
[03:01:20.160 --> 03:01:25.680]  and we can stop it but we can't we got what we actually need to put emphasis on getting people
[03:01:25.680 --> 03:01:31.440]  out to register to vote out the congress and the senate because if we don't get a new congress a
[03:01:31.440 --> 03:01:35.840]  new senate we don't have a chance that's the way i see it i agree i agree that's the start there's a
[03:01:35.840 --> 03:01:39.760]  lot of things that we can do and we can do things at the local level as well there's a lot of
[03:01:39.760 --> 03:01:44.640]  corruption in the electoral system and we need to find better ways to monitor that one thing that
[03:01:44.640 --> 03:01:50.480]  we can all do let's not forget jury nullification we've got to get our right to trial by jury back
[03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:55.440]  and we need people to stand up for justice and not just be rubber stamps for the judges thank
[03:01:55.440 --> 03:02:00.640]  you tack in california let's go to frank in north carolina go ahead frank yeah i just wanted to
[03:02:00.640 --> 03:02:07.120]  tell people about something i read yesterday on the radio and as regards in regards to the um
[03:02:07.120 --> 03:02:14.320]  bundy uh situation uh i listened to rush limbaugh for about 15 years uh every chance i could get i
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:19.440]  mean i eat i eat my lunch in the car when it was 90 degrees outside i did that all through college
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:26.800]  every everything but i i woke up uh back in 2005 2006 and realized that rush limbaugh was a sellout
[03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:32.800]  and uh in it for the money and probably probably uh you know whoring himself out for the establishment
[03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:38.480]  boss left right paradigm but uh he had on a guest host yesterday and i just happened to be in a car
[03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:44.080]  where they were playing that uh this guy i believe his name is mike or mark stein i believe he's a
[03:02:44.080 --> 03:02:49.760]  canadian yeah he started talking about this bundy situation i couldn't believe he sounded like alex
[03:02:49.760 --> 03:02:54.720]  jones and he said basically anybody that doesn't understand what's going on and doesn't support
[03:02:54.720 --> 03:02:59.680]  the bundies ought to be ashamed of themselves i'm gonna tell you that glimback he's one part snake
[03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:05.520]  one part weasel one part rat 100 percent creep he's oddly effeminate like harry reed and lindsay
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:12.000]  graham and uh poor mr bundy does not understand but people like beck beck is is a per the proverb
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:16.800]  proverbial wolf in chief clothing he doesn't care anything about this country well i think you're
[03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:22.240]  right and i didn't hear mark stein but i if he's talking about uh being a police state issue this
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:26.480]  is something that ought to ought to unite people across a political spectrum and i tell you when
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:31.680]  they start trying to divide people along these different demographic groups and and uh put us
[03:03:31.680 --> 03:03:36.640]  against each other that is strictly a control technique the bigger picture of course there's
[03:03:36.640 --> 03:03:42.080]  a lot of things behind it agenda 21 the corruption and ethics issues behind harry reed but it's also
[03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:48.080]  about the police state issue here that is something that ought to unite everybody left and right
[03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:53.280]  thank you frank in north caroline let's go to uncle john in pennsylvania hello david
[03:03:53.280 --> 03:04:00.880]  that's after all you uh frontline info warriors go ahead what's on your mind thank you what's on
[03:04:00.880 --> 03:04:06.880]  your mind i was listening to michael savage wednesday and he he said something that uh
[03:04:06.880 --> 03:04:13.760]  i'm surprised alex didn't mention earlier and there's a rare earth mine near the bundy ranch
[03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:20.960]  like 150 miles oh yeah absolutely and it's not so much what's underground and and solar and wind
[03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:26.240]  but perhaps after all is where minerals as well you know there's a lot of different things there
[03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:31.520]  there's mineral rights or surface rights all of this there's two things going on behind this and
[03:04:31.520 --> 03:04:37.840]  that is the effort to get people off the land as part of agenda 21 and it's also looting the
[03:04:37.840 --> 03:04:42.320]  country and turning it over to the chinese and other giant corporations and there's many different
[03:04:42.320 --> 03:04:48.160]  ways they can do it neil cornza who is now the director of the blm who used to work for harry
[03:04:48.160 --> 03:04:53.200]  reid his father was very involved in very many mining companies as somebody pointed out earlier
[03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:57.040]  sorry i couldn't get to the last two guys there thank you so much for your calls
[03:04:57.040 --> 03:05:19.120]  we'll be back on sunday there's going to be a special program that alex has recorded
