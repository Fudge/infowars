[00:00.000 --> 00:19.920]  Infowars the most banned network in the world
[00:34.320 --> 00:40.480]  Big brothers, mainstream media, we want answers but so do I, now let's do it.
[00:43.360 --> 00:51.520]  All right, I've done particularly a lot of research today and have a lot of news
[00:51.520 --> 00:58.800]  for you to cover and we have some big guests as well joining us today but I got to tell you
[01:00.160 --> 01:05.760]  just the information that we already knew two years ago that's now confirmed by major prestigious
[01:07.360 --> 01:13.760]  institutions, British medical journal, New England medical journal,
[01:13.760 --> 01:24.960]  a bunch of others right here, there's the Lancet that the mRNA vaccines but also the virus vector
[01:24.960 --> 01:32.480]  vaccines of Johnson and Johnson and others irrevocably destroy the cells and cut the DNA
[01:32.480 --> 01:38.560]  strands of the double helix causing a countdown to accelerated death and aging and death
[01:38.560 --> 01:48.480]  and what's incredible is we played all these Pfizer and other executives giggling and laughing on
[01:48.480 --> 01:56.320]  the CBC and the BBC particularly two years ago about how you're going to need boosters on a
[01:56.320 --> 02:02.960]  routine basis because this will lower your immune system across the board and then they start laughing
[02:02.960 --> 02:09.600]  we've played those clips probably 100 times and then we're just sitting here watching them do it
[02:09.600 --> 02:17.040]  to us and watching the mass death and illnesses and these artificial blood clots that grows in
[02:17.040 --> 02:24.880]  people's bodies and it's just insane to watch the average leftist think this is funny and lionized and
[02:24.880 --> 02:33.600]  deified Fauci I mean this is really really sick and then to know and be able to predict as we
[02:33.600 --> 02:39.200]  did several years ago that these vaccines would cause polio like and smallpox like symptoms and
[02:39.200 --> 02:43.040]  now that's what's happening and there's major studies admitting that's really what it is it's the
[02:43.040 --> 02:48.960]  shots and that yes what's in the shots is communicable as well so you can spread it
[02:48.960 --> 02:54.560]  you got all these 60 and 70 year old women 80 year old women have it periods again
[02:55.280 --> 02:58.880]  you got young women not having their periods when they take it and they just admit in the
[02:58.880 --> 03:04.400]  British news the US news okay yeah it messes with your menstrual cycle big deal even though top
[03:04.400 --> 03:10.080]  scientists that worked at the highest levels in places like Pfizer Dr. Yedon and others said this
[03:10.080 --> 03:17.360]  would happen a full six months before they rolled the shots out first in the UK two years ago and
[03:17.360 --> 03:24.080]  then here as well and now the mass death and the so-called long COVID it's it's just staggering
[03:25.920 --> 03:29.840]  so people ask how am I doing how am I handling all the attacks it's not fun
[03:31.840 --> 03:35.600]  but on a scale as I've said at one to ten these attacks are one against me
[03:36.400 --> 03:39.760]  but the people that don't know what's happening to them it's just so sad and you can say well the
[03:39.760 --> 03:48.000]  left deserves it let me go ahead and take the shots and die they're idiots but what about the children
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.560]  what about their children now there's national statistics came out last week five and up only
[03:54.560 --> 04:00.480]  six percent of children five to twelve have taken the deadly shot enough parents are smart
[04:00.480 --> 04:05.200]  it's hard to believe there's six percent would do it but now they're trying to mandate it in blue
[04:05.200 --> 04:09.440]  cities in blue states across the United States same thing's happening in Europe and we just
[04:09.440 --> 04:15.200]  can't stand by and watch them do this and then I desperately put a plea out to Trump saying we're
[04:15.200 --> 04:20.080]  not going to support you if you don't start coming out against this and then I clarify it
[04:20.080 --> 04:24.480]  because the media edited down what I said that I was trying to support Trump and I clarified it
[04:24.480 --> 04:31.200]  they said oh jones down grovels to Trump as if what I do on this show is trying to curry favor
[04:31.200 --> 04:38.000]  with Trump all I've gotten is hell supporting Trump I'm trying to get Trump to be a leader
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.520]  and save these children and extricate himself from the mess he got sucked into by berks and fouchy and
[04:44.400 --> 04:49.600]  bill gates and the rest of these criminals it's big broadcast today that's just one of the stacks
[04:49.600 --> 04:55.120]  there's just so much our children being forced into the metaverse and so much more stay with us
[05:01.440 --> 05:06.080]  do you say alex jones crazy he's a conspiracy theory guy's a nutcase he got these rants and all
[05:06.080 --> 05:14.560]  that uh what they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal
[05:14.560 --> 05:22.400]  not noise if you look at the signal and you compare that to pbs and npr and bbc and we'll do what alex
[05:22.400 --> 05:28.160]  jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there and if you're a sent in
[05:28.160 --> 05:31.680]  a human being and just watching it you say well god alex jones was ahead of this not only that
[05:31.680 --> 05:37.440]  he kind of explained it you are one of the great thinkers of this that is very rare you got to go
[05:37.440 --> 05:42.880]  back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that in this new book i got to tell you when
[05:42.880 --> 05:48.480]  tony lion's first approach me i read this thing i go this is it this is no beetry you're not going
[05:48.480 --> 05:52.080]  to be flipping pages or you're going to be having a pin out you're going to be underlying stuff the
[05:52.080 --> 06:08.000]  great reset by alex jones order your copy now at amazon or info or store dot com
[06:08.000 --> 06:22.720]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the info wars
[06:22.720 --> 06:33.120]  dot com studios it's alex jones 21st century warfare is full spectrum dominance
[06:33.120 --> 06:39.520]  21st century warfare is designed so that you never know what hit you
[06:42.320 --> 06:47.920]  and the reason info wars and your truly alex jones our public enemy number one to the tyrants
[06:48.560 --> 06:53.200]  is because we are trying to get people to actually study what's the big brzezinski wrote
[06:53.200 --> 07:03.120]  about what bill gates is pushed state apartment random 200 the club of rome the georgia guide
[07:03.120 --> 07:08.720]  stones and now they're all over the news saying they're going to be populace and they're creating
[07:08.720 --> 07:15.040]  a great reset to cause civilizational collapse and have several big stacks on that today our
[07:15.040 --> 07:19.520]  children being forced into the metaverse and how it is brainwashing and literal hacking of the
[07:19.520 --> 07:27.360]  brain even according to the world economic forum this quarterbacking it we have a lot of big election
[07:27.360 --> 07:33.600]  meddling news and censorship news to get to this is going to be a big broadcast and we have several
[07:33.600 --> 07:40.000]  guests as well like let me tell you about those we had mike adams always incredibly informative
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.920]  his new bombshell information is over the top powerful forgot to tell the crew robert barnes
[07:45.920 --> 07:50.320]  is on 1130 i want to remind him of that because we're talking like 1am he might have forgotten
[07:51.520 --> 07:56.880]  so robert barnes is coming up bottom of the hour dr kelly victory and so much more
[07:59.600 --> 08:08.240]  but i try to energize for this broadcast because every time i get up here and i look at all this
[08:08.240 --> 08:14.480]  news it makes me angry and it's quite a task to go three four hours a day so i just shift into
[08:14.480 --> 08:17.760]  really aggressive gear and i think we've been effective in getting people out of their comfort
[08:17.760 --> 08:24.000]  zone and get people to wake up but but sometimes with stuff this big it just really makes me feel
[08:24.000 --> 08:30.640]  extremely melancholy and and we somehow need to reach out to people that don't know what's going on
[08:30.640 --> 08:36.800]  we need to warn them because if we don't get the general lemming public somewhat awake we don't
[08:36.800 --> 08:42.480]  have much of a chance and it's starting to happen as they say the propaganda wouldn't be necessary
[08:42.480 --> 08:48.320]  if the situation was hopeless or if the situation was hopeless the propaganda wouldn't be necessary but
[08:50.800 --> 08:52.480]  out of all this news i've got here
[08:56.240 --> 09:03.040]  the first thing i want to hit is foutsies departure and the left acting like their messiah has been
[09:03.040 --> 09:07.520]  struck down all because fouchy obviously doesn't want to be forced to testify in the upcoming
[09:07.520 --> 09:15.200]  republican congress about gain of function and everything he's done but as serious as the
[09:15.200 --> 09:20.800]  situation is and as grievous as it is you have a really good chance of mitigating this and backing
[09:20.800 --> 09:29.040]  them down and really derailing their entire agenda but they're very close to succeeding we're very
[09:29.040 --> 09:34.720]  close to beating them it's really an all or nothing situation at this point so i want you to
[09:34.720 --> 09:39.840]  understand i think you do understand it's why you're tuned in just how serious this information
[09:39.840 --> 09:46.080]  is so i can direct you right here this is our coveted new world order takeover stack today
[09:47.440 --> 09:51.280]  and i just have a few of the prestigious studies from the landsic medical journal and
[09:53.840 --> 09:59.760]  out of the new england medical journal and a bunch of others that are big thick well documented
[09:59.760 --> 10:06.320]  finding the same thing whether they're doing studies in the us or germany or india or mexico
[10:06.320 --> 10:13.200]  or canada or australia it's basically the exact same numbers and what are they finding this is
[10:13.200 --> 10:20.320]  just when they just study one aspect of all of the shots that foutsy through the nih and niad
[10:21.520 --> 10:25.920]  had already directed the so-called vaccine makers with these gene therapies to develop
[10:25.920 --> 10:32.000]  so even if it's on an mRNA shot the virus vector does the same thing it just shoots a virus into
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.880]  the cell with the same program and then to create the spike protein which cuts the dna
[10:37.680 --> 10:43.680]  strands it doesn't allow cell repair or proper replication they do replicate they mutate and
[10:43.680 --> 10:50.960]  that has a name it's called cancer not a very fun thing i'm not talking about the astrological sign
[10:50.960 --> 11:03.200]  the crab i'm talking about tumors malignancy so top scientists warned of this before the
[11:03.200 --> 11:10.320]  shots began the cdc predicted it in their own fact sheet of probable side effects from the shots
[11:11.120 --> 11:15.840]  but see the shots don't protect you from covid that these aren't side effects when they sterilize
[11:15.840 --> 11:20.000]  you and when they give you cancer and give you blood clots and give you heart attacks and heart
[11:20.000 --> 11:29.280]  swelling and strokes it is the main effect covid 19 vaccine waning and effectiveness and side effects
[11:29.280 --> 11:39.360]  of boosters a prospective community study and it's an index of studies published in the lanset
[11:39.360 --> 11:46.160]  and what it finds is it erases your immune system doesn't protect you and then lets any other basic
[11:46.160 --> 11:54.080]  virus out there take you over or bacteria for that matter because the shots on record even
[11:54.080 --> 11:58.160]  when they first rolled them out they knew because they done an animal studies turn off
[12:00.080 --> 12:11.120]  the killer t's and turn off the programmer t cells that go out and give the command orders
[12:11.120 --> 12:20.400]  to the rest of white blood cells produced in the bone marrow and then they carry back things the
[12:20.400 --> 12:30.000]  lymph nodes to be processed out and it's just the the the cold bloodedness of this and to be
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.080]  sitting here just calmly watching them do this to us and i think the heavens i think god that
[12:36.080 --> 12:44.640]  it more and more people are talking about this tucker carlson covered it some last night and
[12:44.640 --> 12:53.120]  then you see the vicious attacks when this is a reality and i see the desperate leftist on
[12:53.120 --> 12:57.600]  twitter and instagram i've had four shots and i've had covid for three months and they just
[12:57.600 --> 13:05.840]  amputated my leg thanks science and they're not joking it's a death cult these people have been
[13:05.840 --> 13:13.440]  putting a trance here's tucker carlson talking about some of it and it's not the theory of t cell
[13:13.440 --> 13:20.640]  damage from jabs it's been verified here it is a link to neurodegenerative disease myocarditis
[13:20.640 --> 13:28.800]  bells palsy liver disease impaired adaptive immunity impaired dna damage response etc so
[13:28.800 --> 13:34.400]  it's possible in fact it's looking likely that the vaccine might suppress the immune system
[13:35.280 --> 13:41.120]  this fact the authors concluded will quote have a wide range of consequences not the least of which
[13:41.120 --> 13:47.840]  include the reactivation of latent viral infections and the reduced ability to effectively combat
[13:47.840 --> 13:58.960]  future infections and quote now again we sincerely hope that's not true but it's not just the conclusion
[13:58.960 --> 14:04.080]  of one scientific journal the lancet maybe the most famous scientific journal in the world
[14:04.080 --> 14:09.360]  released similar findings in february the lancet's piece was entitled quote risk of infection
[14:09.360 --> 14:15.360]  hospitalization and death up to nine months after a second dose of covid 19 vaccine a physician
[14:15.360 --> 14:20.560]  called kenji yamamoto made this observation with the data from the lancet he wrote this in a letter
[14:20.560 --> 14:24.480]  to the journal of virology and we're quoting the study showed that immune function among
[14:24.480 --> 14:28.960]  vaccinated individuals eight months after the administration of two doses of covid 19 vaccine
[14:29.520 --> 14:39.440]  was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals now your first response if you're a
[14:39.440 --> 14:45.680]  humane person to a line like that has got to be deep sympathy because people were misled they were
[14:45.680 --> 14:51.680]  forced they were forced medical ethics throughout the window people were forced to take medicine they
[14:51.680 --> 14:55.680]  didn't want and some of them may have been hurt by it and you don't have to take this man's word
[14:55.680 --> 15:00.320]  for it pull up the lancet study yourself you won't find anything of the text of the article saying
[15:00.320 --> 15:05.120]  what kenji yamamoto said which is weird why would the lancet want to hide a major finding like that
[15:05.120 --> 15:11.520]  we can't say but if you look at table three in the piece here's what you'll find buried in the data
[15:11.520 --> 15:15.280]  among people around the age of 80 who have been double vaccinated that would include people like
[15:15.280 --> 15:21.120]  joe biden the per capita rate of medical incidences including hospitalizations or death
[15:21.120 --> 15:27.760]  is nearly twice as high as the rate of serious incidents for the unvaccinated this is 180 days
[15:27.760 --> 15:36.800]  after vaccination what is that and why is no one interested because it's a depopulation it's not
[15:36.800 --> 15:42.160]  even hidden anymore ladies and gentlemen but we can stop this and we can certainly stop them getting
[15:42.160 --> 15:48.320]  the children but that's where we are and that's the grave reality i know it's hard to deal with but
[15:49.280 --> 15:54.720]  we had top scientists on two and a half years ago we were the first to predict all of this
[15:54.720 --> 16:04.800]  and it's why we are slated for destruction the cavalry for your immune system the cavalry for

[20:18.320 --> 20:23.040]  up with the next phony baloney crisis to put americans back where they belong and dark rooms
[20:23.040 --> 20:28.160]  glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials well i think nbc you are here to
[20:28.160 --> 20:34.880]  listen and not speak i think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health care a new
[20:34.880 --> 20:39.280]  disease no one's immune it's like the summer of the shark except instead of a shark it's an
[20:39.280 --> 20:45.760]  epidemic and instead of summer it's all the time now i hate to be the guy who derails what everybody
[20:45.760 --> 20:52.800]  else loves he loves being that guy but janice we do have standards this can't be a made-up disease
[20:52.800 --> 20:58.720]  the only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public we do have something

[22:11.280 --> 22:18.320]  is someone that believes in transhumanism that believes in depopulation that believes that
[22:18.320 --> 22:23.920]  the majority of the public are worthless and they want to use their corporate power to basically
[22:23.920 --> 22:29.120]  get control of humanity and get control of the medical system and the educational system and
[22:29.120 --> 22:35.520]  the banking system to bring in a social credit score to be able to social engineer at a level

[34:05.520 --> 34:21.440]  it's alex jones
[34:25.600 --> 34:28.000]  well robert barnes is our guest
[34:28.000 --> 34:37.280]  constitutional lawyer litigator but also historian and i want to get his take on the waterfront here
[34:38.320 --> 34:41.840]  on mounting evidence they're planning to steal the midterms or at least try
[34:43.360 --> 34:47.120]  what the ongoing numbers mean and the collapse of the corporate media almost zero viewers how
[34:47.120 --> 34:57.200]  they're going to respond to that russia escalating its attacks in ukraine us issues an alert says
[34:57.200 --> 35:02.400]  all americans must leave ukraine now leave immediately ahead of expanded russian offensive
[35:04.160 --> 35:09.600]  there is so much to cover here i also want to get barnes's take who is shooing fizer
[35:09.600 --> 35:15.600]  with whistleblowers in texas and other states and now that whistleblower information showed
[35:15.600 --> 35:23.200]  that they falsified the live studies they did when the shots were rolled out in the us a year
[35:23.200 --> 35:28.720]  and a half ago similar numbers two years ago when it started in the uk first turning off
[35:28.720 --> 35:33.600]  the t cells in the immune system that's now major lands it study and others coming out
[35:33.600 --> 35:38.160]  finally took a carlson others are covering it so there's so many things to hit here but first i
[35:38.160 --> 35:45.200]  wanted to talk about this because i know that obama kept 30 million documents and now they're
[35:45.200 --> 35:54.160]  saying oh trump kept 300 and this is litigation by leak government officials won't release the
[35:54.160 --> 35:59.600]  search warrant but they'll then leak selected parts of it but we also have federal rulings
[35:59.600 --> 36:04.400]  that a president can declassify whatever he wants whenever he wants and so i want to just put the
[36:04.400 --> 36:11.680]  facts on the record here with barnes on this first and with all of his connections and he's got real
[36:11.680 --> 36:19.040]  ear to the ground uh inside baseball what he's expecting them to do against trump because i know
[36:19.040 --> 36:26.080]  roger stone and marger taylor green talked to him in late june and he said i may announce on
[36:26.080 --> 36:32.960]  july fourth and i said trump may announce on july fourth he didn't on july 14th he said i will run
[36:32.960 --> 36:37.040]  just i'm not saying when i'll announce but that is an announcement so we were actually right about
[36:37.040 --> 36:42.080]  that uh they said oh jones was wrong he didn't declare july fourth well that's not what i predicted
[36:42.080 --> 36:46.960]  but i really think he made a mistake not declaring early to make it even more clear this is political
[36:46.960 --> 36:51.840]  it's obviously boosted his approval rating i really love trump except you can have a hundred
[36:51.840 --> 36:58.640]  gallons a great fruit punch and if you put one big old stinkin you know what in there uh the whole
[36:58.640 --> 37:05.120]  thing's bad and where he where barnes thinks trump can go because i talked to trumps base all day and
[37:05.120 --> 37:11.200]  they're just like me they love trump but this is a no go deal with them and him not getting in line
[37:11.200 --> 37:16.800]  with the sanis and others and saying hey fouchy lied to me and you know we shouldn't be giving this
[37:16.800 --> 37:22.800]  to children i mean trump's starting to do that i just don't think he realizes how bad a situation
[37:22.800 --> 37:27.040]  this is that's a lot i threw out barnes hoping to do about 15 minutes with us in the next hour
[37:27.040 --> 37:33.680]  go ahead and give us your take on that whole cornucopia oh sure so i mean first of all the
[37:33.680 --> 37:38.240]  uh president trump was legally entitled to all the documents that he had uh that's a clearly
[37:38.240 --> 37:43.280]  established precedent some i judge that roger stone knows well amy berman jackson made that
[37:43.280 --> 37:48.080]  determination back at the end of the clinton administration because the clinton's kept all
[37:48.080 --> 37:52.480]  kinds of documents act they stole some furniture and everything else from the white house the uh
[37:52.480 --> 37:58.480]  and judicial watch sought certain files that he that clinton had with taylor branch uh because he
[37:58.480 --> 38:03.920]  basically gave taylor branch inside access to watch the president inaction tape record a whole
[38:03.920 --> 38:09.760]  bunch of conversations tape record the president bill clinton inaction and then clinton unilaterally
[38:09.760 --> 38:15.040]  decided not to turn that over to the national archives unilaterally decided what was classified
[38:15.040 --> 38:20.400]  and what wasn't and how it was classified and kept the document and so judicial watch sought the
[38:20.400 --> 38:25.360]  document sought the tape recording sought the transcript sought the files related to it clinton
[38:25.360 --> 38:30.160]  apparently had stuck it in a sock drawer somewhere in terms of you know how well it was secured
[38:30.160 --> 38:36.240]  and the net effect was that the uh court said you know what there's no relief here because they said
[38:36.240 --> 38:41.200]  under the presidential records act the president has exclusive carte blanche to decide what's a
[38:41.200 --> 38:45.680]  presidential record and what's a personal record and if it's a presidential record rather than a
[38:45.680 --> 38:52.000]  personal record then uh the it's only then that the international archives has any role so because
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.440]  the uh the clinton had determined these were personal records that decision the court said was
[38:57.440 --> 39:02.640]  a uh a non-reviewable decision they said there's nothing in the law that prohibits that there's
[39:02.640 --> 39:06.560]  nothing in the law that precludes that there's nothing in the law that allows judicial review
[39:06.560 --> 39:12.000]  there's no criminal or civil remedy sanction available so what that means is every document
[39:12.000 --> 39:18.000]  that the president had we now know based on the suit the president filed yesterday uh against the
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.360]  department of justice seeking judicial intervention in this extraordinary unparalleled action by the
[39:23.360 --> 39:28.720]  feds that these basically were all his documents these were documents he had chosen to declassify
[39:28.720 --> 39:32.960]  he had been completely and fully forthcoming with these documents that the documents that were
[39:32.960 --> 39:38.080]  going to be part of the future trump presidential library had already been sent back to the national
[39:38.080 --> 39:43.600]  archives that isn't what any of these documents were he'd given them multiple tours he'd shared
[39:43.600 --> 39:47.920]  video evidence of everything of everybody who'd gone in there and seen or looked at the documents
[39:47.920 --> 39:53.760]  for months on end and yet despite all that they still rated it and they rated it as we're now
[39:53.760 --> 39:58.480]  finding out from other places and other locations and other sources including paul's period real
[39:58.480 --> 40:03.520]  clear investigations but not just limited to him that the uh that this is a deep state operation
[40:03.520 --> 40:09.040]  that the officer who ran it who's named in the suit is the head of the counterintelligence division
[40:09.040 --> 40:14.080]  of the fbi this is the and for those folks that don't remember the counterintelligence division
[40:14.080 --> 40:19.120]  was the basis for co-intell pro that was the part of the lead part of co-intell pro was the
[40:19.120 --> 40:24.080]  counterintelligence division the counterintelligence division of the fbi is also where they completely
[40:24.080 --> 40:28.800]  failed to do counterintelligence gets aldrich aims and everybody else who was busy selling secrets
[40:28.800 --> 40:34.080]  to the soviets selling secrets to other foreign governments and other cases but also counterintelligence
[40:34.080 --> 40:39.680]  is where uh the they went after trump related to russia gate so the first time around and
[40:39.680 --> 40:45.760]  ukraine gate and the impeachment scandal the second time around so you have the centerpiece of
[40:45.760 --> 40:53.040]  corruption and deep state activity that centerpiece within the fbi is the organization running the
[40:53.040 --> 40:57.280]  trump raid and so it's the dirty it's the dirty tricks department and you forgot one
[40:58.160 --> 41:03.920]  and there's so many i can't blame you that same group also ran january 6 and also ran
[41:03.920 --> 41:12.320]  uh the whitmer fake kidnapping absolutely absolutely i mean in you know the for those
[41:12.320 --> 41:17.680]  folks that may see some headlines tomorrow about the whitmer conviction there were two defendants
[41:17.680 --> 41:23.520]  who had a mistrial because 11 of the 12 jurors wanted to acquit one was a holdout they retried
[41:23.520 --> 41:27.680]  him they didn't allow the defense to present a lot of evidence they basically pulled an alex
[41:27.680 --> 41:33.440]  jones kind of trial in the whitmer trial limited what the defense could present the judge basically
[41:33.440 --> 41:37.600]  instructed the jury in a way that made it clear to the jury where the judge wanted the jury to come
[41:37.600 --> 41:42.400]  down and so today the jury convicted to those two people who never should have been convicted at
[41:42.400 --> 41:46.800]  all given the extraordinary evidence that show it was only because the judge gave instructions
[41:46.800 --> 41:50.880]  that reversed what the law is supposed to be on the issue of entrapment because the evidence
[41:50.880 --> 41:56.000]  accumulated the people who ran the whitmer entrapment operation later on ran the january
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.640]  six operation and they're in bed with the russia gate folks and the co-intel pro folks and the
[42:00.640 --> 42:05.520]  counter and they got embarrassed by the last trial the showing they set them up so they rigged this
[42:05.520 --> 42:09.920]  one it's the same thing ted cruise came out and defended the sandy hook ruling we know he's a smart
[42:09.920 --> 42:15.280]  lawyer we know she defaulted us we know she rigged it and so really shame on ted cruise coming out
[42:15.280 --> 42:20.080]  supporting that but i guess he did say the january six people are terrorists and everybody that came
[42:20.080 --> 42:25.120]  to that rally should be locked up i mean ted cruise is a big problem yeah he always has been i mean
[42:25.120 --> 42:29.280]  that's an old family tradition going all the way back to cuba in terms of cruise's willingness
[42:29.280 --> 42:34.640]  and readiness to an eagerness to be subservient to the deep state agendas president trump exposed
[42:34.640 --> 42:40.480]  in the 2016 campaign during the indiana primary so it reflects ongoing issues but it's at least
[42:40.480 --> 42:44.080]  good to see president trump starting to fight back fight back not only the court of public
[42:44.080 --> 42:47.840]  opinion stay right there robert we gotta go to break i want to come back and your predictions

[47:48.560 --> 47:51.440]  you were always on my mind
[47:55.120 --> 47:58.720]  i want to take this time out while i still have time to thank

[48:11.440 --> 48:16.720]  that's why they say we're not real that's why we just they say we're frauds because they're the
[48:16.720 --> 48:24.240]  frauds they're the liars and i'm honored though it's not fun to be one of their main targets
[48:24.240 --> 48:32.880]  because it lets me know i'm over the target you've always been on my mind i'm betting on every
[48:32.880 --> 48:37.920]  single one of you every race color and creed i love you we're going to beat this theory together
[48:37.920 --> 48:43.680]  it's going to be tough but there's no choice we got to do it all right barnes big picture
[48:43.680 --> 48:47.200]  finishing up with trump here and what this means whether people love trump or hate trump
[48:47.920 --> 48:53.680]  he got reelected they stole it they're pissed they see him as a populist uprising taking over the
[48:53.680 --> 48:58.720]  gop he's getting all these great people elected overall i'm back trump still just because of that
[48:58.720 --> 49:02.400]  i'm mad about the shots but i'm trying to get him to do the right thing that was the whole point
[49:02.400 --> 49:08.880]  of what i did in the last week that had that effect he reached out but big picture what do
[49:08.880 --> 49:12.880]  you expect the enemies of freedom as there's a total political realignment obviously happening
[49:12.880 --> 49:18.800]  against them taking place with 77 days out from the midterms what do you think the deep state's
[49:18.800 --> 49:24.720]  going to pull next well be interesting i mean part of it will depend on how the courts handle
[49:24.720 --> 49:29.520]  trump's challenges uh and whether or not they take meaningful action uh president trump
[49:29.520 --> 49:36.080]  filed his suit yesterday seeking a federal court intervene in the proceedings prevent any further
[49:36.080 --> 49:41.520]  seizures from taking place any further searches of the existing documents taken from taking place
[49:41.520 --> 49:47.600]  any further use of the information or documents taken from taking place any destruction of the
[49:47.600 --> 49:53.760]  document seized from taking place and further has requested the intervention and intermediary rule
[49:53.760 --> 50:00.240]  of a special master and a a which is a privately appointed lawyer by the federal court system
[50:00.240 --> 50:06.400]  who has court authority to be the sole person to review all the relevant documents and information
[50:06.400 --> 50:11.360]  and see if any of it should have ever been taken in the first place and should be returned to the
[50:11.360 --> 50:16.880]  president including reviewing attorney client privileged documents including reviewing executive
[50:16.880 --> 50:22.560]  privileged documents so one key aspect is will the courts intervene and do their constitutional
[50:22.560 --> 50:27.760]  duty to prevent this from getting even more out of control by the deep state now you have
[50:28.560 --> 50:34.000]  the reporting from just the news that in fact the biden administration was neck deep in this
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.360]  and that it appears there was a coordinated effort uh to to to steal these documents of
[50:39.360 --> 50:44.400]  the president documents that were legally his under the presidential records act if he designated
[50:44.400 --> 50:49.840]  them as personal legally his when he declassified them as he's publicly stated he already has
[50:49.840 --> 50:56.080]  both of which he has unilateral non-reviewable power to utilize under existing federal judicial
[50:56.080 --> 51:01.840]  and supreme court authority in certain instances the whether or not if they intervene because we
[51:01.840 --> 51:07.840]  now know the biden administration was complicit in coordinating the effort to get this whole thing
[51:07.840 --> 51:13.680]  started by working with under the guise of working with the national archives under the pretext of
[51:13.680 --> 51:19.200]  working with that fake january 6 committee uh that wasn't a congressionally formed committee
[51:19.200 --> 51:26.240]  under the rules of congress itself so this makes just interrupt bob this makes watergate look like a
[51:27.120 --> 51:33.440]  tea party or i mean just to acquire boys i mean this is directly going and grabbing a president's
[51:33.440 --> 51:38.160]  papers against the law and acting like he's committed a crime what do you think their plan
[51:38.160 --> 51:43.440]  here is and has it blown up their face as the polls show what people are saying or is that
[51:43.440 --> 51:48.400]  wishful thinking i think from the deep state perspective their goal was to get the documents
[51:48.400 --> 51:53.280]  by any means possible and that they didn't care what the political consequences are and the question
[51:53.280 --> 51:58.560]  is did they in fact get those documents the fact that the safe is empty suggests they did not so
[51:58.560 --> 52:04.080]  my guess is the president has preserved and protected those documents and those documents are
[52:04.080 --> 52:10.160]  continuing ongoing leverage he can utilize against the deep state going any further or doing anything
[52:10.160 --> 52:14.560]  particular to him now on the other hand the democrats go back and forth because they don't
[52:14.560 --> 52:20.160]  know whether they want to face trump or face desantis in 2024 there's many within the democratic
[52:20.160 --> 52:25.520]  party that would rather face trump than desantis the net effect of that is that may be a limiting
[52:25.520 --> 52:31.600]  action on their abilities to go further but they clearly are contemplating uh escalating to an
[52:31.600 --> 52:36.800]  indictment and then you had not only former new york police commissioner but then just yesterday i
[52:36.800 --> 52:42.560]  believe rudy juliani telling people that the president is at risk of assassination that that
[52:42.560 --> 52:47.840]  may be where the deep state go if the deep state fears they were unsuccessful in this raid will be
[52:47.840 --> 52:53.680]  unsuccessful with criminal prosecution will be unsuccessful with taking him out politically
[52:53.680 --> 52:58.240]  then they will they may try to take him out physically as they did to the kennedy brothers in
[52:58.240 --> 53:04.400]  the 1960s so that's at the risk of where this might escalate sadly and frighteningly and by the way
[53:04.400 --> 53:09.200]  i totally agree with benard kerrick and rudolf juliani anybody that studied history with the
[53:09.200 --> 53:15.440]  deep state blowing up alexander dougan's daughter trying to kill him with all the talk of kill trump
[53:15.440 --> 53:20.960]  by mainstream news we've got like six seven minute videos that are just filled with clips of democrat
[53:20.960 --> 53:25.120]  leaders saying we're going to kill this guy we're going to take this guy out they are desperate and
[53:25.840 --> 53:32.800]  where they are in an authoritarian playbook is in that territory now so it this is consecutive this
[53:32.800 --> 53:38.800]  is formulaic and and that's that's that's the only moves they've got there's a total political
[53:38.800 --> 53:44.320]  realignment a total collapse in their support even their massive election fraud can't save them so
[53:44.320 --> 53:49.120]  what will they pull the next 77 days and that could be claim the iranians they've already planted
[53:49.120 --> 53:56.240]  that story are gonna assassinate trump no doubt i mean i they will still definitely do everything
[53:56.240 --> 54:01.200]  they can to rig the outcomes in november but i think those uh those efforts to rig will be
[54:01.200 --> 54:06.320]  unavailing and unsuccessful i think blake masters is going to win hersha walker is going to win
[54:06.320 --> 54:10.960]  jd vance is going to win eric schmitz going to win republicans are going to win the senate
[54:10.960 --> 54:14.720]  republicans are going to win the house you have mitch mcconnell out there trying to sabotage
[54:14.720 --> 54:18.480]  republican senate efforts as well but i don't think those will ultimately work because the
[54:18.480 --> 54:24.640]  american people are so disgusted and so outraged by what democratic leadership has looked like
[54:24.640 --> 54:30.480]  under the biden administration and his fraud you know his fraudulency the second uh after the last
[54:30.480 --> 54:35.600]  president way back in the end of the night uh 19th century uh got in illicitly we're seeing what
[54:35.600 --> 54:39.680]  that looks like when you put a dementia candidate who didn't legitimately win it just like woodrow
[54:39.680 --> 54:46.880]  wilson was gone for months uh i mean we now have biden spending three out of four weeks uh you know
[54:46.880 --> 54:51.040]  hiding out in the countryside clearly he's he's out of his mind what are they gonna do about him
[54:52.560 --> 54:58.160]  and i think the problem they have is the trump problem in that right now trump beats them all
[54:58.160 --> 55:04.080]  and so and beats the biden substitutes even worse and by a bigger margin than biden loses
[55:04.080 --> 55:08.160]  so i my guess is they will play out the script through the november midterm see if they can
[55:08.160 --> 55:12.800]  survive the november midterms and if they don't that's when we will see escalation and we're
[55:12.800 --> 55:16.560]  seeing variations of it you're pointing out what took place in russia is an example of where their
[55:16.560 --> 55:21.360]  mindset and mentality is their willingness to assassinate uh send assassins into assassinate
[55:21.360 --> 55:26.240]  public figures we're seeing it in pakistan right now emron khan who's sort of the populace leader
[55:26.240 --> 55:31.120]  of pakistan that they removed the deep state took efforts to take out because of his independent
[55:31.120 --> 55:36.800]  perspective on a range of politics including the russia-ukran conflict they're now trying to say that
[55:36.800 --> 55:42.320]  him simply raising questions about the corruption in the pakistani court system it is they're going
[55:42.320 --> 55:47.200]  to call that terrorism and try to arrest him and you're seeing that they're trying to arrest bolson
[55:47.200 --> 55:51.680]  aro with some u n charge because he wouldn't push the vaccine saying it's a crime against humanity
[55:51.680 --> 55:57.120]  eating people poise the shot stay there i want to shift years into the shot your lawsuits these

[58:58.480 --> 59:03.920]  your life the big tech companies they don't want you to read this book they want to control what

[59:31.360 --> 59:36.240]  available in libraries they're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can
[59:36.240 --> 59:41.360]  but they're not going to be able to do it prove that censorship doesn't work by the great reset
[59:41.360 --> 59:46.240]  thank you alex jones i really appreciate you having me on and i appreciate you writing this book
[59:46.240 --> 59:52.400]  and getting the information out there
[59:52.400 --> 59:56.400]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:15.120]  so then we come to the damages then we come to this 45.2 million dollars in punitive damages
[1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:19.120]  this is where i want your legal take on this because i think we can all agree that
[1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:23.280]  what alex jones engaged in was defamation aimed at these two people the jury was not
[1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:30.800]  incorrect about that but is this fair is this just to completely financially destroy someone
[1:00:31.520 --> 1:00:38.240]  over yes defamation but not even a violent crime well look i think the judgment is likely
[1:00:38.240 --> 1:00:44.480]  to be reduced substantially the 45 million has two components 4.1 million is compensatory and
[1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:50.800]  it's what the jury concluded where it was the the emotional the the damage to the reputation
[1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:54.720]  and the emotional damage that the parents had they they concluded that was 4.1 million
[1:00:55.280 --> 1:01:01.920]  in compensatory damages and the remaining 41 million is punitive damages now texas like many
[1:01:01.920 --> 1:01:08.560]  states has passed tort reform where punitive damages are capped at double the economic
[1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:15.360]  damages plus 750 thousand dollars so most of that 40 plus million punitive damages
[1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:19.840]  is likely to be chopped down and then that's likely to be chopped down either by the district
[1:01:19.840 --> 1:01:24.800]  judge or on appeal but i think at the end of the day it's not going to be 45 million it's likely
[1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:34.000]  to be a number significantly smaller than that but still a big number um in terms of the basis
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:41.760]  for the the 4 million in in actual compensatory damages i have not examined the evidence that
[1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:49.040]  the jury heard presumably there was some effort to quantify that but look that being said i
[1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:56.960]  i'm not troubled by someone who commits this kind of willful deliberate action in order to make money
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:04.800]  getting popped and getting popped substantially uh for for being a predator and a vulture
[1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:13.760]  for profit and even if this judgment gets reduced significantly which i think it probably will be
[1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:20.000]  there are a bunch of other sandy hook parents and so there are other plaintiffs there are other
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:27.200]  lawsuits that are ongoing so i don't expect this to be the last verdict against alex jones uh for
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:36.160]  the same conduct because when you harm a bunch of people um you under the law you you're responsible
[1:02:36.160 --> 1:02:41.680]  for the consequences of the harm you cause never said their names now they said they're coming up
[1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:47.120]  for foxes everybody else he's savoring this he called the january 6 protesters the peaceful ones
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:52.000]  terrorist he says they all deserve solitary confinement i'm done with ted cruise he's a monster
[1:02:52.720 --> 1:02:58.320]  robert barnes what ted cruise got wrong he admits he hasn't even reviewed the evidence and yet he's
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:03.440]  willing and eager to come to conclusions about the evidence that reflects a poor version of
[1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:08.320]  lawyering he would never was a very good lawyer and he proves once again why he was never a very
[1:03:08.320 --> 1:03:13.840]  good lawyer he comes from a long family history of deep state pack activities and that's who he's
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:18.720]  always been that's why he went after the president uh donald trump during the primaries that's why he
[1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:23.920]  refused to endorse him at the republican national convention this is just ted cruise showing his
[1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:28.720]  real face this is a guy who's been propagating and whoring for every war that's ever been fought
[1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:33.600]  out propagating and whoring for the current war in ukraine and russia where he repeated a lot of
[1:03:33.600 --> 1:03:40.480]  lies by ted cruise's definition uh the russian people could sue ted cruise into oblivion uh
[1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:46.000]  because he actually did make false statements that help propagate and lead to actual deaths
[1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:51.840]  unlike what took place in alex jones case but his failure to research the case his failure to
[1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:57.520]  review the case his failure to understand the case which is an ongoing problem of ted cruise and
[1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:02.800]  many of the people covering this case in the legal news is an embarrassment of the legal profession
[1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:09.680]  this precedent will be used and misused and abused to go after everybody including ted cruise himself
[1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:14.800]  and he's just assuming that because he's part of the politically privileged class the politically
[1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:21.360]  protected george w bush wing of republicanism in texas that he will never face this consequent
[1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:25.760]  the problem is what these precedents including those in connecticut have shown is that this will
[1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:30.800]  not be limited to one place or one location and nobody will end up protected or privileged just
[1:04:30.800 --> 1:04:36.720]  as alex jones was the canary in coal in the coal mine for social media censorship alex jones's trial
[1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:41.040]  is the canary in the coal mine for the weaponization of the legal system to destroy our civil rights
[1:04:41.040 --> 1:04:46.000]  and civil liberties and those who don't wake up to it are bound to experience its consequence
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:52.560]  as president trump experienced in 2020 that's right stay there uh i want to shift gears when
[1:04:52.560 --> 1:05:02.480]  come back and talk about ukraine the economy inflation more the cavalry for your immune system

[1:06:04.320 --> 1:06:12.080]  you are either with the republic or against it resistance to tyrants his obedience to god
[1:06:12.640 --> 1:06:20.240]  it's alex jones and constitutional lawyer robert barnes looking at all the big developments in the
[1:06:20.240 --> 1:06:26.160]  world the global establishment has never been more hated more attacked they're striking back when he
[1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:33.680]  leaves us in about 10 minutes i'm gonna hit the global lockdowns are preparing not for viruses
[1:06:33.680 --> 1:06:40.560]  but for the environment china's economic hub goes dark the metaverse in our children there's a bunch
[1:06:40.560 --> 1:06:47.120]  of developments that tie together that's coming up but robert let's let's hit ukraine and then other
[1:06:47.120 --> 1:06:51.120]  big issues that are on your radar screen because we're not supposed to talk about ukraine anymore
[1:06:51.120 --> 1:06:56.880]  is not going well we have this assassination of alexander duggan's daughter what's the inside
[1:06:56.880 --> 1:07:03.200]  baseball well today uh well they they basically detailed it all and figured out it was a ukrainian
[1:07:03.200 --> 1:07:09.120]  assassin who was sent in using the fact that russia is allowing people from the donbas into russia
[1:07:09.120 --> 1:07:14.560]  they used a denets license plate to sneak in change license plates all the rest got out of the
[1:07:14.560 --> 1:07:18.800]  country before being caught but they've identified her they have camera footage they have other
[1:07:18.800 --> 1:07:23.680]  footage they have all the details that show this was an assassination attempt in which some members
[1:07:23.680 --> 1:07:27.920]  of the media in the west are celebrating are you know which shows how disturbing it is they're
[1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:33.280]  trying to green light more and more dangerous activities using ukraine as the pretext using
[1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:38.480]  pakistan as the pretext if they can get away with it there they're going to export it or import it
[1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:43.360]  right back into the united states in the west so but uh what's functionally gonna it's not
[1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:48.560]  going to change russia's approach russia's going to continue to move forward the so-called ukrainian
[1:07:48.560 --> 1:07:53.360]  counter offensive that liars like ted cruz were saying was going to happen just the opposite is
[1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:59.200]  happening russia's marching into those exact regions and expanding even further its fear of
[1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:04.960]  influence it's only a matter of time now before russia wins that conflict likely will have all of
[1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:12.000]  the land rich regions of ukraine all the russian populated regions of ukraine all the way up from
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  harkiv all the way through odessa they're going to own the sea of assoff they're going to own the
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:21.280]  black sea uh on the ukrainian side of the isle ukraine is going to be a landlocked country
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:27.360]  and what's scarier is that this appears to be repeating and replicating the terrorism approaches
[1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:33.440]  of of the deep state in the past where they put in motion various terroristic engines and armies
[1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:39.200]  that then ultimately of course blew back on us and if they're starting to unleash ukrainian
[1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:45.920]  assassination teams and ukrainian hitmen because uh dugan is on that list that blacklist that senator
[1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:52.880]  ran paul is on i mean all kinds of glint greenwald is on that's that ukrainian nato blessed list of
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:57.040]  people they called russian propagandists is it a coincidence this is actually i think the third
[1:08:57.040 --> 1:09:02.640]  or fourth person on that list to be killed within six weeks so i mean you're seeing increasing numbers
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:09.040]  of people being assassinated are they just going to create a terroristic army like a operation gladio
[1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:13.680]  right when we left those armies behind or units behind in order to fight the soviets then they
[1:09:13.680 --> 1:09:19.280]  started doing domestic terrorism for 30 years in europe uh extending i mean most prominently in
[1:09:19.280 --> 1:09:24.480]  in italy but not limited to italy we might start seeing the same kind of blowback risk so ukraine
[1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:28.800]  continues to blow back it's blown back mostly against the deep state george soros is getting
[1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:33.600]  crushed their economic sanctions war against russia is failing their ideas for a global digital
[1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:38.960]  currency are disappearing overnight because nobody in the global south wants anything to do with it
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:43.520]  uh and their efforts to replace putin have failed so in that sense their efforts have failed
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:48.400]  but another efforts to blow back may be against us not only economically with energy crises
[1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:54.000]  inflation and sanctions blowing back on us and limiting our economic progress but may also
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.480]  blow back with you know not only criminal organizations that have been unleashed in ukraine
[1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:04.960]  arms trafficking money laundering human trafficking the but also now a building terrorist army of
[1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:10.240]  assassins being unleashed throughout the west and the world without any meaningful limits that will
[1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:15.440]  come back to hurt us and haunt us ultimately we've put in motion again another dangerous army
[1:10:15.440 --> 1:10:20.320]  that could only lead to our own self-destruction if we don't put a stop to it sometime soon
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:28.160]  what do you expect putin to do once he's secured those areas in eastern ukraine
[1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:33.840]  i think what's gonna they're gonna have referendums apparently this is a coming month in september
[1:10:33.840 --> 1:10:38.960]  so they're gonna use the model we used in the Baltics to say you could declare your own independence
[1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:43.360]  and then have a referendum that affirms it he's going to replicate that he's going to do it throughout
[1:10:43.360 --> 1:10:47.920]  the entire donbas and i think he'll take the entire donbas almost uh well everything from
[1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:52.960]  harkiv all the way down to the Crimea so they have a land bridge then i think the next step is
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:56.000]  they're going to go into makhalayev they're going to go up a little bit north they're going to go
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:01.360]  over to odessa and it's not only because of its historical ties it's where a lot of russians
[1:11:01.360 --> 1:11:07.200]  live it's where a lot of russia has a lot of history going back multiple centuries in terms
[1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:11.440]  of founding a lot of these cities establishing a lot of these communities but it's also the
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:17.440]  land rich and resource rich region this is where the good agriculture the black soil the famous black
[1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:22.960]  soil of ukraine comes from this is where the manufacturing and industrial base is this is
[1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:28.320]  where the shipbuilding base is and it gives them control of the black sea as well as the sea of
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:33.840]  asa goes all the way back to peter the great obsession with odessa uh and and his successor's
[1:11:33.840 --> 1:11:38.640]  obsession with odessa was black sea access so access to the Mediterranean they've are uh
[1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:43.760]  putin just cut a deal with erdogan that's going to uh basically integrate large parts of turkey
[1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:48.880]  into the russian economic system as an alternative economic system away from the e u away from the
[1:11:48.880 --> 1:11:54.800]  euro away from the dollar and we see the euro in trouble we see the ruble up we see russian oil
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:12:00.800]  exports at all time eyes i mean if i was trying to actually help russia and screw up the angle
[1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:04.720]  american establishment i would do that but i i guess it's just the arrogance of empires
[1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:10.400]  that go to russia to die that's exactly right i mean i mean that's that's that's why nipolian
[1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:16.240]  got caught there that's why hitler got caught there it's a long extended effort of the arrogance of
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:20.640]  the aristocratic elites of europe that think they run the world that think they control the world
[1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:24.560]  that think they can that's right they've been trying to take over russia for 200 plus years
[1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:31.040]  exactly exactly and and this is just their latest failed effort to do it one more russian winner
[1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:35.680]  will be the death of another empire and in this case it's a it's a death we can cheer because
[1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:41.040]  it's the globalist empire and so the but that won't stop them from being even more desperate
[1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:47.280]  domestically and internally at home as they lose power abroad and globally and are willing to risk
[1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:53.040]  more and more conflicts like what may happen in china they may be willing to risk a war with china
[1:12:53.680 --> 1:12:57.200]  not because they oppose the chinese communist party's mechanism of government but because
[1:12:57.200 --> 1:13:01.920]  it's necessary to boost their domestic flagging political operations in the united states
[1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:10.560]  everywhere the global western establishment is involved they're they're falling on their faces
[1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:16.000]  why don't they ever give up i i i guess just for hundreds of years they've been in charge and they
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:21.760]  just think they're invincible well i think it's the core premise that you've put out many times
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:29.040]  which is that these are people who are addicted to power that the anybody who desires power and
[1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:33.600]  is successful at seeking it is someone that's disproportionately dangerous and that's been
[1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:38.320]  the core premise that you've articulated for decades and we're just seeing it on full display
[1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:42.800]  the other the thing that makes it worse is that these people are dangerously incompetent
[1:13:42.800 --> 1:13:48.160]  that it's not just their moral compass that's broken their intellectual compass is was probably
[1:13:48.160 --> 1:13:53.040]  never even present we're seeing what would happen if we had a bunch of hillary clinton's threat
[1:13:53.040 --> 1:13:59.680]  the state department cia the fbi the nsa the various globalist ngo's and institutions well
[1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:05.120]  that's what we got we got a bunch of little hillary's dictating our policies around the globe
[1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:09.360]  and what will that carry all the real people i know that have had to kill folks aren't proud of it
[1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:14.560]  don't brag about it here's this sack of garbage that can't even wipe her own rear end bragging how
[1:14:14.560 --> 1:14:20.080]  she killed this person how she killed that person obama doing it it's just it's just the optics of
[1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:25.680]  it spell disaster i hope there's some way to pull out of this yeah i mean the irony is that the
[1:14:25.680 --> 1:14:31.920]  populace to oppose globalists have had to depend on uh maybe unlikely sources and allies like
[1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:36.960]  vladimir putin of russia because he in this case he shares an opposition to globalist he was very
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:40.880]  public in his most recent speech and he kept calling them globalists who don't care about
[1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:44.800]  their own country elites that don't care about their own nation he called them he called them
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:50.640]  leftist globalists exactly and he just hammered over and over again who and what they are and did
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:56.000]  it move over terms that he has before so thankfully russia's been able to push back against this
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:01.360]  globalist effort in a way that will limit the risk of global war but the world the globalists will
[1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:06.720]  likely do is then turn to china as another place to do it uh any place that that they can find that
[1:15:06.720 --> 1:15:12.720]  which is even more insane completely more insane it makes no sense because we're totally dependent
[1:15:12.720 --> 1:15:16.640]  on china we're not dependent on russia europe's dependent on russia but we're not we'll it'll
[1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:21.040]  be what five times worse than what europe's going through i mean europe has like a trip quadrupling
[1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:28.080]  of gas prices our electricity bills i've got to hear up almost 47 percent exactly imagine what would
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:32.560]  happen if all the supply chains break down by going to war with china imagine the risk of nuclear
[1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:37.440]  conflict that can occur live in real dr strange love kind of times so that's why it's critical
[1:15:37.440 --> 1:15:42.320]  that ordinary everyday people stay on the front line hold the line support places like info wars

[1:20:50.400 --> 1:20:53.920]  ordering them and threatening them to just hypothetically say they might kidnap
[1:20:53.920 --> 1:21:00.080]  the governor of michigan and the same FBI team that ran that false flag that failed
[1:21:00.080 --> 1:21:07.840]  false flag ran january 6 and ran the raid on president trump at marlago two men convicted
[1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:14.800]  in plot to kidnap governor whitmer just minutes ago abc news a jury has convicted two men
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:19.440]  have been aspiring to kidnap michigan governor gretchen whitmer in 2020
[1:21:19.440 --> 1:21:27.120]  the FBI says it foiled the plot which it ran the kidnap michigan governor gretchen whitmer
[1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:31.760]  just department announced charges against six individuals in michigan who were allegedly involved
[1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:36.640]  in a months long plot to kidnap whitmer and the judge said it doesn't matter if they were told
[1:21:36.640 --> 1:21:42.400]  to do it doesn't matter if they weren't planning to do it you will find them guilty and the jury
[1:21:42.400 --> 1:21:50.640]  found them guilty you know i'm gonna hit this huge news next segment i'm i'm gonna talk about
[1:21:50.640 --> 1:21:55.840]  something this segment that i've only mentioned a few times and you know what's crazy is i can
[1:21:55.840 --> 1:22:00.240]  talk about stuff here and it becomes a huge national news story but things that are really
[1:22:00.240 --> 1:22:05.200]  important the millions that you tuned in here but that's it it's like we're in the fandom zone
[1:22:05.200 --> 1:22:15.520]  but in negotiations try to settle the fake rig sandy hook lawsuits
[1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:21.200]  they told us just come out against the second amendment
[1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:24.720]  and we'll drop it
[1:22:27.520 --> 1:22:32.240]  and i said to my lawyers i said is that even legal they said yeah in a in a negotiation it is
[1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:38.320]  yes they don't even care they would love for me to just join them and i'd have a singing
[1:22:38.320 --> 1:22:43.360]  in show every night i don't want to be that person i couldn't live with myself i mean i feel good
[1:22:43.360 --> 1:22:50.160]  about what i do i tell the truth i do the best job i can to be accurate but i just want listeners
[1:22:50.160 --> 1:22:57.280]  to know that's where we are in this country in this world that most people don't even question
[1:22:57.280 --> 1:23:03.120]  they're not even asking whether they're selling out or not they say give me the talking point
[1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:09.920]  and i will repeat it and i will say whatever you want just just give me a job and i look at a
[1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:14.720]  country in a world of men and women like that and i asked people do you think you're going to have a
[1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:20.160]  good future when nobody stands up for basic human rights and freedom when whole groups of people
[1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:27.520]  are being destroyed you don't think that's not going to turn around and bite you where's the empathy but
[1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:33.360]  that's why they attack in thousands of articles a week hundreds of tv programs a week just i mean
[1:23:33.360 --> 1:23:40.800]  that's conservative every local news station radio to me you can't even track it bill mar all the
[1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:48.400]  late night comedy uh hbo shows just i mean you can't even keep track of it imagine being attacked
[1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:54.800]  by national news a hundred times a day that's a conservative number but i'm not being a victim
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.960]  we've done what they didn't think could be done
[1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:08.640]  we've energized a global resistance to the new world order to their globalist program and so i
[1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:17.120]  got to be honest with you i am spectacularly pleased with all of this and the what i've gone
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:25.840]  through to get here has been negligible but i will say this i am truly horrified by how cold
[1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:32.720]  blooded they are and how they have rolled out these shots that are sterilizing and giving people
[1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:39.200]  heart attacks and strokes and erasing their immune systems and it's mainline news now and
[1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:43.920]  still the people that took the shots say they love it they want more and so you think yourself
[1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:50.640]  well god let them die then but see you know the answer to that god's watching they're going after
[1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:55.200]  the children we can't be like the new world order and say well the public's so dumb let them die
[1:24:56.160 --> 1:24:57.840]  but that's really where we're at here
[1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:04.720]  gods never let me get out of this fight they haven't taken me out of this thing feet first
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:13.200]  and i was such a fool in hawaii when i married my second wife six years ago when she was pregnant
[1:25:13.200 --> 1:25:19.920]  with my youngest daughter and i said i've done my work i've exposed the new world order
[1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:25.360]  and i just want to write a book a year and make a film and just and just cogitate and and just
[1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:30.320]  you know do a few interviews and i don't want to be a leader and i've done my job and i can see
[1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:36.320]  where this is going and i just want to step out now and watch others fight the fight that's never
[1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:43.440]  going to happen see i'm just like you i want to go fishing i want to go hiking i want to go to
[1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:51.200]  church i want to paint i want to play cards i want to go deer hunting can't do it folks
[1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:56.800]  and i get you deserve to go deer hunting i'm saying you shouldn't go i'm just saying
[1:25:58.080 --> 1:26:02.880]  that when you realize this is the end of civilization as we know it and everything you've
[1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:09.280]  loved everything your forebears handed down to you is being robbed and taken you're going to realize
[1:26:09.280 --> 1:26:17.600]  that this generation will fight and defeat the new world order culturally economically
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:23.280]  spiritually if they attack us first physically we'll either fight and win or we'll roll over
[1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:31.200]  and die and i as a man just can't roll over and so 10 percent of me wants to just fade off into
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:36.400]  oblivion not out of cowardice just out of being sick of dealing with these people but i realized
[1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:44.000]  they're not going to go away anyways if i went away but here's the real problem and i know you
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:55.680]  feel the same way 90 percent of me is pissed at alex johnson that i've made mistakes but i wasn't
[1:26:55.680 --> 1:27:01.440]  strong enough that i didn't have all the answers or when i had the answers i didn't follow it the
[1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:09.360]  holy spirit and that this is so horrible and so real and we were so right and all the infrastructure
[1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:17.200]  is being cut off and all this hell is being set up and i go i had four children what about their
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:25.760]  future what do i do and i just have not the word is not guilt i'm not a guilty person i'm i'm very
[1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:31.120]  comfortable what i've done i put everything on the field but it's not a feeling of guilt it's a
[1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:38.400]  feeling of burning in the spine and the brain and the heart and the guts and in my feet and in my
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:47.280]  fist that you will not let these people do this you will not let them dominate you will not let
[1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:59.840]  them break people's will and you will defeat them my spirit is on fire and it's literally got me by
[1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:06.480]  the scruff of my neck that's why i'm not scared of these satanists the new warps they don't even
[1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:15.920]  exist ladies and gentlemen compared to god i'm god-fearing because i've got a connection to god
[1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:24.480]  just like you do and i'm in god's presence and i can feel the anger and i'm just here going i know
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:32.240]  i try i i what am i and then god shows me what's going to happen next if we don't stop him it's
[1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:41.040]  horrible all right i'm gonna try to look into the future here when we come back i already know the

[1:33:33.840 --> 1:33:38.960]  i remember reading history books about chescoo's communist romania
[1:33:40.640 --> 1:33:46.160]  in places like north korea where they would regulate and turn off the power and keep people
[1:33:46.160 --> 1:33:53.120]  poor and starve them as a form of feudalism and that's what the rio de genero george
[1:33:53.120 --> 1:34:00.160]  herbert walker bush meeting was about in 2002 was setting this up and so they're artificially
[1:34:00.160 --> 1:34:04.960]  cutting the resources off and we all know that but now it's not some beta test it's not some
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:10.960]  hypothetical they're doing it everywhere and farmers all over the world are battling back
[1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:13.680]  because they just say yeah you got to kill half your cows this year they're bad for the earth
[1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:18.960]  oh your sheep are bad oh smart meters just happen to be in all the new appliances for a decade and

[1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:26.640]  your thermostats and your stove and remotely turn off your lights at 8 p.m.
[1:34:26.640 --> 1:34:34.640]  and communist china the beta test model of this is doing it in their biggest cities
[1:34:35.200 --> 1:34:44.160]  at 8 o'clock at night like you're in a prison lights out no power and it's all wired in
[1:34:44.160 --> 1:34:48.080]  by design where the elevators and everything still work the police still have lights the
[1:34:48.080 --> 1:34:52.080]  government buildings have lights just like in chelchescu's romania the government district
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:58.800]  would have lights and at 7 8 o'clock at night there they turn the lights out again like you're
[1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:06.720]  in a prison and we're like this is happening and it's globally coordinated and they're trying to
[1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:10.720]  forcibly inject us with poisons that have raised our immune systems and give us heart attacks

[1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:16.480]  but it was then reborn so yes we're we're entering the end of that era and have a whole
[1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:21.040]  another stack of news with their banning cows all over the world and i mean you know about it all
[1:40:21.040 --> 1:40:28.800]  it's it's it's all out there in fact let me just show you this stack
[1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:39.680]  the average us household pays 47 percent more for electricity than a year ago i mean that's war
[1:40:41.520 --> 1:40:48.720]  almost a 50 percent increase in power in the united states in one
[1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:56.080]  year and it's only climbing as you can see projected to be a hundred percent increase
[1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:00.000]  within another year and only goes up
[1:41:02.480 --> 1:41:07.280]  because we put up with it cutting off the pipelines cutting off the gas cutting off the
[1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:12.640]  oil fields cutting it all off but then buying record amounts from venezuela
[1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:18.720]  and saudi arabia and i mean this is war
[1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:26.960]  and they've got actuaries and numbers out there they'd have to build over a thousand
[1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:31.200]  more whole power plants they've shut down more than a thousand since obama got in
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:38.480]  there isn't enough hydroelectric there isn't enough solar to even pay for 10 of it they
[1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:44.800]  didn't put in a thousand plants to make half the car fleet which they say will be electric by 2030
[1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:50.480]  and ford and dodge and everybody's announcing we're not making gas cars anymore starting
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:55.760]  in the next few years they've already announced they're canceling most your favorite vehicles
[1:41:55.760 --> 1:42:02.320]  dodge and ford and chevy and big layoffs and the horrible acid fields in africa and the way they
[1:42:02.320 --> 1:42:06.560]  mine this stuff and it uses more carbon than gasoline they don't care because it's about
[1:42:06.560 --> 1:42:12.000]  shutting things down china's not going electric cars mexico's not going electric cars india's
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:18.720]  not going you're going as economic warfare to shut you down think about that
[1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:25.760]  they'd have to build a thousand coal power plants on the average size
[1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:31.600]  to have enough power to pay for electric cars to have energy for them
[1:42:31.600 --> 1:42:38.800]  california just banned four-wheelers and lawnmowers anything that takes gas there aren't even the
[1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:44.080]  electric things they need to even do to mow the lawns this is economic warfare they're not giving

[1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:12.240]  we've known and what's to come and right now the most important thing to remember is don't panic
[1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:18.560]  stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe

[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:49.680]  company cuts costs to make the transition to electric vehicles and really you could make
[1:47:49.680 --> 1:47:54.960]  the same argument we were talking about tax breaks for adding solar panels energy efficient
[1:47:54.960 --> 1:48:00.240]  windows appliances heat pumps you know what do you say to the families who simply can't afford
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:08.160]  this stuff in the first place well number one for your home yes there are significant incentives
[1:48:08.160 --> 1:48:14.720]  in this bill which is great to reduce people's energy costs on a monthly basis so if you are

[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:44.880]  the big outlay at the front and when they're financed they're financed to the in a way that
[1:48:44.880 --> 1:48:51.120]  reduces your energy bill even though you have solar panels with this 30% off it's a significant
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:56.800]  incentive same thing with if you if you don't qualify for the weatherization program you will
[1:48:56.800 --> 1:49:03.280]  be able to starting next year get rebates on the the appliances and equipment that will help you
[1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:10.160]  reduce your monthly energy bill by up to 30% this is all about reducing costs for people and yet the

[1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:44.800]  admit that so they're simply saying oh here's our new plan that isn't a plan for a new system it's a
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:52.960]  plan to destroy everything the average us household pays 47% more for electricity than a year ago and
[1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:59.360]  of course in blue states and blue cities it's over 60% they are raping the hell out of their people
[1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:04.960]  and they think it's funny but here's the next level major australian banks announced yesterday

[1:53:49.760 --> 1:53:54.000]  break and start the next hour with a special guest coming up but tucker carlson directly over the
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:59.920]  target and freaking out the system so apparently someone in the department of let's wreck america
[1:53:59.920 --> 1:54:04.320]  as quickly as we can in the bite administration so we've just got too much food in this country
[1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:08.880]  and the good food is the worst food food without endocrine disrupting chemicals must be eliminated
[1:54:08.880 --> 1:54:14.960]  immediately only wheat thins for you and some bugs so with that in mind agents from the bite
[1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:21.200]  administration armed have decided to attack the amish amos miller an independent farmer in the
[1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:26.480]  old amish village of bird and hand pennsylvania found out the hard way the feds say amos isn't
[1:54:26.480 --> 1:54:31.680]  adhering to regulatory requirements for food production again not enough endocrine disrupting
[1:54:31.680 --> 1:54:36.720]  chemicals you're not using enough gmo's so with that in mind federal agents rated his farm they're
[1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:43.680]  demanding he stop farming they're also trying to cripple him with 300 000 in fines an amish farmer
[1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:48.720]  and amos miller says he's farming in accordance with his religious beliefs and he's providing food
[1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:53.360]  for 4 000 people and what he calls a private food club it's really a shocking story and we wouldn't
[1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:58.560]  know about it if it were not for jeremy lefredo who works for rebel news he joins us tonight jeremy
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:02.880]  thanks so much for coming on this one stories it's kind of hard to believe they're going after an
[1:55:02.880 --> 1:55:12.400]  amish farmer who are they exactly we have the u.s. martial service recently rated amos miller's
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:18.400]  organic and holistic farm demanding he cease operations and they charged him as you said
[1:55:18.400 --> 1:55:26.640]  with 300 000 of fines economically crippling the man and what's happening is you have the
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:32.320]  arm federal agents are demanding he stop food production because of the meat and you have him
[1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:38.000]  saying well you know what i want to keep farming so you have this back and forth between the giant
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:42.320]  empire of the u.s. federal government and this tiny little farm in burton hand pennsylvania
[1:55:42.320 --> 1:55:52.080]  so they went after gyms organic farmers and churches so maybe they're against anything
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:57.200]  that's wholesome and edifying that makes you stronger and healthier and in favor of everything
[1:55:57.200 --> 1:56:01.040]  that diminishes you and makes you more dependent i'm just sensing a theme here do you see this
[1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:07.200]  yeah and another thing the community says is that they're coming after amos to set an example
[1:56:07.200 --> 1:56:12.720]  they're coming after an independent successful farmer who takes out the government middleman
[1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:17.920]  and provides food directly to his community and his people now by taking out the middleman by
[1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:22.320]  taking out the government you're taking power away and taking leverage away from the government
[1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:27.520]  and putting that power and leverage in the hands of the community and the farmers and the people
[1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:33.440]  and another thing i'll add is amos's farm doesn't use any gasoline or any fertilizer now as you
[1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:38.240]  know these commodities have become very expensive because of biden's policies in regards to the
[1:56:38.240 --> 1:56:45.840]  war in ukraine and russia so amos has completely eliminated eliminated any risk coming from the
[1:56:45.840 --> 1:56:50.240]  international or domestic politics of the biden administration and you know they're coming after
[1:56:50.240 --> 1:56:54.960]  him for it maybe if he promises to put more chemicals in the milk that turn kids trans
[1:56:54.960 --> 1:57:01.280]  they'll lay off did any of the federal marshals decline to raid an amish organic farm on principal
[1:57:01.280 --> 1:57:08.240]  order they'd all just go along with this do you know all i know is that many federal agents
[1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:14.400]  did not decline to go and did go along with it and raided the farm and took inventory of amos's
[1:57:15.600 --> 1:57:21.760]  farm to make sure that he doesn't sell or produce any more meat you know i work for
[1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:26.160]  law enforcement broadly speaking but there's such a thing as conscience okay and they should not
[1:57:26.160 --> 1:57:30.560]  have gone along with this when they tell you to raid an organic amish farm that's when you bow out
[1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:34.880]  okay i would say jeremy i appreciate your story that you did it's shocking to believe it's real
[1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:46.480]  but it is i mean we're thankful that you came thank you

[2:00:05.200 --> 2:00:08.800]  but first let's go to this report has america been slated for starvation
[2:00:10.400 --> 2:00:18.080]  is america's food supply being sabotaged or are we being judged by god and plagued with the future
[2:00:18.080 --> 2:00:24.480]  famine as michael snyder details on his economic collapse blog a worldwide drought mainly in the
[2:00:24.480 --> 2:00:30.320]  northern hemisphere is impacting agricultural production in the u.s and europe and this scarcity
[2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:36.320]  of various produce and meat is going to raise food prices in the months and years ahead chili
[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:41.920]  farmers in some parts of the country have lost up to 80 percent of their harvests here due to the
[2:00:41.920 --> 2:00:47.600]  severe drought conditions in the region in france with the lack of rainfall has prompted widespread
[2:00:47.600 --> 2:00:54.160]  limits on fresh water use they are experiencing their driest month in recorded history since march
[2:00:54.160 --> 2:01:01.360]  of 1961 this is especially impactful on the world's food supply since france is the fourth largest
[2:01:01.360 --> 2:01:08.000]  exporter of wheat in germany the most important river the rye has dropped to dangerously low
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:14.400]  levels and even dried up completely in some places not only does this drop in water affect crop
[2:01:14.400 --> 2:01:20.960]  irrigation but the river is used to transport the vast majority of all goods in and out of germany
[2:01:20.960 --> 2:01:28.800]  including coal oil and most importantly food in the elb river hunger stones have reappeared which
[2:01:28.800 --> 2:01:36.080]  were used to mark low river levels that would forecast famines in the land on one stone from 1616
[2:01:36.080 --> 2:01:43.120]  it reads if you see me cry here in the u.s about half the nation is experiencing some level of
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:49.360]  drought but the lack of precipitation is particularly bad in texas where the dallas fort worth area
[2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:56.240]  has had no measurable rain for two straight months the lack of water has led many ranchers to panic
[2:01:56.240 --> 2:02:02.720]  sell their herds being unable to water them which will impact beef prices in the future is this just
[2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:09.760]  a typical weather cycle where a season of drought comes and goes or is this a true climate disaster
[2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:16.320]  as the global warming alarmists would like us to think and with food prices poised to explode
[2:02:16.320 --> 2:02:22.640]  the question arises what can we do about it will weather modification technology that has the
[2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:29.360]  ability to create rain by cloud seeding be brought to the mainstream public at last as a solution
[2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:36.000]  to this worldwide drought china the ua e indonesia and other nations have already come out of the
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:41.680]  closet with their cloud seeding technology so will the u.s government declassify their own
[2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:48.480]  weather manipulating tools to meet this crisis or perhaps this weather modification technology
[2:02:48.480 --> 2:02:53.840]  is what caused the drought across the world by prematurely pulling water vapor out of the
[2:02:53.840 --> 2:02:59.920]  atmosphere and showering the land with kim trail tainted rain how many decades have governments
[2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:06.320]  around the world use these cloud seeding agents chemical compounds made from aluminum barium
[2:03:06.320 --> 2:03:13.760]  potassium iodide solid carbon dioxide and various salt compounds aside from farmers and ranchers
[2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:19.440]  losing a large percentage of their products due to a lack of rainwater food processing plants
[2:03:19.440 --> 2:03:25.760]  across the u.s have been mysteriously bursting into flames or shutting down further fueling the
[2:03:25.760 --> 2:03:32.240]  food crisis caused by the drought starting in 2021 the uptick and disruptions at food processing
[2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:38.720]  facilities began and today the number stands well over 100 incidents that led to the shutdown of
[2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:44.880]  significant production starting in 2022 there was a shutdown at least once a week these incidents
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:52.080]  destroyed damage or impacted food processing facilities indefinitely either by fires diseases
[2:03:52.080 --> 2:03:58.480]  or an assortment of accidents like plane crashes these incidents ceased beef and pork packing
[2:03:58.480 --> 2:04:05.680]  plants milk parlors egg farms fertilizer plants various produce packing and processing facilities
[2:04:05.680 --> 2:04:11.520]  and an assortment of farms for turkeys ducks and chickens have been cold millions of animals
[2:04:11.520 --> 2:04:18.320]  killed for outbreaks of bird flu massive corporations like general mills keloch nestley
[2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:26.160]  walmart smithfield jbs and purina have also shut down production have we been slated for starvation
[2:04:26.160 --> 2:04:32.720]  or are we being backed into a corner so we accept the terms of the new world order's great reset
[2:04:32.720 --> 2:04:38.640]  agenda although we're armed with a powerful military and the second amendment to protect ourselves
[2:04:38.640 --> 2:04:45.760]  from an invasion or a tyrannical government is food the weapon being used against us just like
[2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:57.360]  henry kissinger said who controls the food supply controls the people this is brian wilson with info wars.com
[2:05:27.680 --> 2:05:32.400]  and despite the fact it's going to sell out quick i want those of you that haven't experienced it

[2:06:18.880 --> 2:06:24.000]  what's all confirmed now he tried to censor her here's one of the local tv stations he talked to
[2:06:24.960 --> 2:06:29.680]  us life insurance companies have reported an overwhelming and unexplainable increase and
[2:06:29.680 --> 2:06:35.200]  all caused deaths among 18 to 49 year olds along with that there's also been an increase in certain
[2:06:35.200 --> 2:06:41.280]  medical diagnosis such as miscarriages and bell's palsy here to give us her take on the new data
[2:06:41.280 --> 2:06:45.440]  and what she believes could be causing the rise in numbers as emergency medicine and disaster
[2:06:45.440 --> 2:06:50.160]  specialist dr kelly victory doctor victory good morning great to talk to you as always
[2:06:51.120 --> 2:06:55.840]  good morning jason thanks for having me okay we want to make sure that any time we talk we
[2:06:55.840 --> 2:07:00.080]  want to make sure the information that we have is accurate so let's start this interview
[2:07:00.080 --> 2:07:05.680]  by telling us i've i've seen your correspondence here what is the source of the information that
[2:07:05.680 --> 2:07:13.360]  you're about to present well this information became available to me or on my radar last week
[2:07:13.360 --> 2:07:19.520]  following a hearing with senator ron johnson uh who was looking at sort of what he calls a second
[2:07:19.520 --> 2:07:26.480]  opinion on the entire response to the covet pandemic the medical data was released by three
[2:07:26.480 --> 2:07:35.120]  career military physicians who got the information from the military database that collects what we
[2:07:35.120 --> 2:07:42.400]  call icd codes which are the diagnosis codes and these physicians had a feeling they believed
[2:07:42.400 --> 2:07:49.040]  based on their own observation that they were seeing a significant uptick in certain conditions
[2:07:49.040 --> 2:07:55.760]  so they actually went back and called the database from the military on certain conditions over a
[2:07:55.760 --> 2:08:07.120]  five-year period from 2016 through 2020 notably you continue containing one year 2020 of the
[2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:15.200]  full-blown pandemic so they looked at 2016 17 18 19 and 20 at the prevalence of certain conditions
[2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:21.120]  including things like heart attack blood clots to the lung miscarriages those sorts of things
[2:08:21.120 --> 2:08:28.480]  and they compared it to the incidents of those same things in the calendar year 2021 and saw an
[2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:36.400]  alarming increase in certain things for example they saw a 270 percent increase in myocardial
[2:08:36.400 --> 2:08:44.880]  infarction in 2021 a 300 increase in incidents of Bell's palsy and of certain neurologic complaints
[2:08:45.440 --> 2:08:53.680]  a 470 percent increase in pulmonary embolisms blood clots to the lungs and many many other
[2:08:53.680 --> 2:09:01.040]  huge increases that they found alarming all right since she covered that on air she's been
[2:09:01.040 --> 2:09:07.040]  massively attacked but if you go to youtube almost every comment is on her side and the people are
[2:09:07.040 --> 2:09:11.920]  confirming what she said but it's in mainline studies Dr. Carlson was covering it last night
[2:09:12.720 --> 2:09:19.840]  their intimidation is not working she's a medical doctor and go over her old bio but Dr. Kelly
[2:09:19.840 --> 2:09:24.400]  victory joins us and so you're not censored you're live you can say whatever you want
[2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:28.960]  tell us about yourself your concerns you're not just talking for five minutes on you know
[2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:34.160]  tan Diego TV here you're reaching millions of people can really break down your concerns
[2:09:34.160 --> 2:09:40.000]  thank you so much for joining us well thanks so much for having me Alex I've still somewhat
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:45.920]  caught off guard when people reference me as you did as a quote whistleblower back in the olden
[2:09:45.920 --> 2:09:52.000]  days I'm what people would call an honest physician reporting on the facts and the science and the
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:58.400]  data as I interpret them from the beginning I have been really raising the alarm bells during
[2:09:58.400 --> 2:10:07.040]  this pandemic going really back to February of 2020 primarily because I saw a response that was
[2:10:07.040 --> 2:10:13.840]  totally out of line with what one would have expected from public health it began with things
[2:10:13.840 --> 2:10:21.280]  like talking about you know masking I mean these sorts of things and I sat back and said wait a
[2:10:21.280 --> 2:10:26.400]  minute you know we've known for decades that masks don't do anything appreciable to stop the
[2:10:26.400 --> 2:10:31.760]  spread of respiratory viruses why would they be talking about that and then it very quickly went
[2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:38.560]  on to things like social distancing perhaps my favorite made-up construct of this entire debacle
[2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:46.800]  I have an entire library of books on public health epidemiology virology immunology pandemic
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:53.360]  preparedness and response and I defy anyone to go to any of those textbooks and find where the
[2:10:53.360 --> 2:11:00.240]  phrase social distancing appears in the index it's a yet we have mom and pop shops all over the
[2:11:00.240 --> 2:11:07.200]  country that we're putting up you know plexiglass and circles on the floor and one way signs in the
[2:11:07.200 --> 2:11:13.360]  you know aisles at the Walmart so that was the initial thing that got my attention was what the
[2:11:13.360 --> 2:11:20.880]  heck are they talking about then I started talking very early about the vaccines and my concerns
[2:11:20.880 --> 2:11:29.760]  about the vaccines now suffice to say out I am not anti-vaccine anything but I've actually been
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:36.720]  called a vaccine zealot in the past I have written and spoken much of my career in public health on
[2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:44.000]  the importance of vaccinations my concern was with these vaccines number one when they started
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:51.840]  talking about launching very quickly an mRNA vaccine I said wait a minute we have never had a safe
[2:11:51.840 --> 2:11:58.800]  and effective mRNA vaccine not because we haven't tried that technology has been around for well over
[2:11:58.800 --> 2:12:06.720]  a decade at the time yet the vaccines had always failed sometimes with disastrous results then I
[2:12:06.720 --> 2:12:12.320]  said wait a minute they're talking about a vaccine that's going to be predicated on a singular spike
[2:12:12.320 --> 2:12:19.520]  protein well that's not going to work anybody with any background in virology knows that viruses
[2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:27.200]  mutate all viruses mutate and the area most likely to mutate is that spike protein so if you create
[2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:32.240]  a vaccine based on that spike protein I simply predicted I said well this isn't going to work
[2:12:32.240 --> 2:12:38.640]  it's going to fail immediately independent of any severe adverse events you might have because of
[2:12:38.640 --> 2:12:45.520]  the mRNA this thing is going to fail in a New York minute so I was out talking about all of this
[2:12:45.520 --> 2:12:54.000]  very very early on and unleashed a world of hurt on myself with regard to censorship I don't have a
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:13:02.080]  big or I didn't at the time a big social media presence whatsoever but I started receiving just
[2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:09.280]  unbelievable vitriol from people people were sending me not only personal notes but I was receiving
[2:13:09.280 --> 2:13:14.640]  you know many things in the mail people would get my address and send me things and talk about how
[2:13:14.640 --> 2:13:19.520]  is a horrible human being and I was going to result in the deaths of you know hundreds of millions
[2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:26.240]  of people that I should lose my medical license and lo and behold I have had to defend my medical
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:34.160]  license on seven seven separate occasions during this pandemic I've done so successfully every
[2:13:34.160 --> 2:13:39.760]  time and think about that though an unapproved drug rammed through on the public and a doctor
[2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:44.800]  questions it you've now been vindicated and the left doesn't want doctors questioning unapproved
[2:13:44.800 --> 2:13:52.080]  drugs rolled out I mean they turned into like big farm occult members exactly this is in the past
[2:13:52.080 --> 2:14:02.160]  we have absolutely promoted the idea of robust vigorous debate in medicine frankly it's a cornerstone
[2:14:02.160 --> 2:14:08.400]  of medicine respectful debate but robust and it's a cornerstone of science isn't it I mean
[2:14:08.400 --> 2:14:15.600]  it's all about debate absolutely we rarely come to the best decisions in medicine or science or
[2:14:15.600 --> 2:14:21.600]  frankly business or anything else if you only listen to a singular voice for years I was the
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:28.160]  chief medical officer of a company that ran on-site healthcare for huge companies fortune 100
[2:14:28.160 --> 2:14:35.280]  companies and dozens of federal agencies incidentally and I had a plaque on my desk that said argue
[2:14:35.280 --> 2:14:40.800]  with me and I meant it tell me why this is the dumbest idea I've come up with or tell me why
[2:14:40.800 --> 2:14:47.280]  I'm misinterpreting the data tell me why I have overestimated oh that's what I say on air and
[2:14:47.280 --> 2:14:52.560]  I wouldn't call them the left just these corporate bots they'll never debate on a face-to-face
[2:14:52.560 --> 2:14:58.080]  they only want it when it's their playing field period right and they don't debate on the science
[2:14:58.080 --> 2:15:04.080]  immediately they start hurling invectives and making ad hominem attacks it never has to do with
[2:15:04.080 --> 2:15:10.000]  them saying hey Dr Kelly we read that same study and here's where I think you misinterpreted the
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:15.280]  findings it's never about that it's you're a horrible human being and you need to go away
[2:15:15.280 --> 2:15:19.920]  you shouldn't be looking at the lands at journal saying it doesn't work and erases the immune system
[2:15:19.920 --> 2:15:27.280]  just shut up exactly and so when I did that last little clip that you reported where I was talking
[2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:35.440]  about specifically that data that was revealed by three career military physicians who were looking
[2:15:35.440 --> 2:15:42.000]  at what they call dmed the defense military epidemiology database and they have access I
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:49.280]  don't I'm not a military physician but they have access to this enormous database that was very very
[2:15:49.280 --> 2:15:53.200]  helpful Dr Kelly I want to hear about what these military physicians said that they're trying to
[2:15:53.200 --> 2:15:59.280]  censor when we come back stay with us the best product I'm not I'm not supposed to be biased but
[2:15:59.280 --> 2:16:03.120]  I'm gonna tell you all now if you haven't tried turbo force you need to try it I've tried turbo
[2:16:03.120 --> 2:16:08.560]  force with everything sometimes you know I went a little bit crazy I put turbo force in my coffee

[2:16:40.160 --> 2:16:43.760]  your life in every single way there's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was

[2:17:09.840 --> 2:17:15.760]  different answers 50 different tax returns 50 different answers and almost all of them just
[2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:20.400]  screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part of the system
[2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:25.200]  and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this show it's a very important
[2:17:25.200 --> 2:17:31.680]  situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do things
[2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:36.000]  tax wise it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money we wouldn't even be here
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:42.480]  if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years the only way you fail is not

[2:18:45.840 --> 2:18:51.440]  do it prove that censorship doesn't work by the great reset thank you alex jones i really appreciate

[2:20:27.920 --> 2:20:31.680]  doc i got a lot of questions but you got cut off by the break getting into these big issues and
[2:20:32.480 --> 2:20:36.400]  where you see all this going you got cut off a police sort of a word where we left off
[2:20:37.920 --> 2:20:43.600]  yeah i just was talking um briefly about this issue of the data that was revealed
[2:20:43.600 --> 2:20:50.320]  by three career military physicians who were drawing attention to these very very alarming
[2:20:50.320 --> 2:20:56.000]  increases in the incidence of certain conditions things like blood clots to the long and bells
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:21:03.360]  palsy heart attacks strokes those sorts of things and was actually in posting that sworn testimony
[2:21:03.360 --> 2:21:10.400]  by these military physicians that got me permanently banned from from twitter how posting sworn
[2:21:10.400 --> 2:21:15.680]  testimony from a congressional hearing is misinformation is beyond me but that's the
[2:21:15.680 --> 2:21:21.520]  way it seems to go these days the thing that i think should be absolutely alarming and really
[2:21:21.520 --> 2:21:29.200]  incents all americans alex is that the various system the vaccine adverse event reporting
[2:21:29.200 --> 2:21:36.160]  system has been in place for 24 years was specifically put there as an early warning
[2:21:36.160 --> 2:21:43.600]  system it was meant to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine the the cdc said let's put a system
[2:21:43.600 --> 2:21:50.560]  in place where people uh civilians and physicians can report things that might be adverse events
[2:21:50.560 --> 2:21:55.920]  related to a vaccine so that we'll know very very quickly early on we'll have that early
[2:21:55.920 --> 2:22:01.840]  warning sign and now their own system is showing 10 20 times previous record problems they say it's
[2:22:01.840 --> 2:22:10.000]  discredited correct they they not only haven't looked into it they have ignored it um there are
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:19.520]  more adverse events and specifically more deaths attributed on veirs to the covet 19 vaccines than
[2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:28.720]  to all other vaccines combined over 24 years think about that say that again in its whole history
[2:22:28.720 --> 2:22:35.680]  there are more in the last two years than ever reported of all the vaccines all 30 other vaccines
[2:22:35.680 --> 2:22:42.400]  over the 24 year period combined you heard that correctly incredible now there's not there's no
[2:22:42.400 --> 2:22:48.800]  saying that any particular case that's reported to veirs is definitely a result of the vaccine
[2:22:48.800 --> 2:22:55.360]  but that's the way it's always been that's that's the nature of that system the the point is they
[2:22:55.360 --> 2:23:01.600]  need to be evaluated and well it's like if you feed your cows a bunch of a new feed and you got
[2:23:01.600 --> 2:23:06.800]  100 cows and 10 die and normally one cow dies a year and 10 die in a day you know it's it's the
[2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:13.920]  feed i mean it's it's causing effect it's right there exactly and and so the great news is or
[2:23:13.920 --> 2:23:20.400]  should have been for for americans is that there's an organization whose job it is to look into that
[2:23:20.400 --> 2:23:26.400]  and it's called the cdc they haven't done it they not only haven't looked into some of them they
[2:23:26.400 --> 2:23:31.840]  haven't looked into any of these they haven't done the autopsies they haven't called the data
[2:23:31.840 --> 2:23:38.480]  instead they've turned a blind eye to it and they march out on a daily basis and say safe and
[2:23:38.480 --> 2:23:45.760]  effective safe and effective when they know darn well that it is neither safe nor effective and
[2:23:45.760 --> 2:23:52.880]  the idea that they are coming out now and making some sort of disingenuous mea culpa about the
[2:23:52.880 --> 2:23:57.040]  fact that they didn't let me stop you doctor because you're reading my mind my next question is
[2:23:57.040 --> 2:24:02.320]  what do you make of berks and Fauci and all of them saying oh we never thought it would work
[2:24:02.320 --> 2:24:09.520]  what is that about oh they're saying the quiet part out loud all of the sudden they're acknowledging
[2:24:09.520 --> 2:24:17.600]  the reality uh deborah berks has come flat out and said they knew from the beginning as i did
[2:24:17.600 --> 2:24:24.160]  that the vaccines wouldn't work that they would lose effectiveness very very quickly and again
[2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:30.560]  that is independent and well let's see and well let's see the head of the cdc oh yes she has come
[2:24:30.560 --> 2:24:35.440]  out and she has said just recently yeah well whoops we made some mistakes and now we're
[2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:41.840]  going to do better going forward because we're going to focus on quote communication collaboration
[2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:49.680]  and timeliness i truly alex they should focus on competence and integrity and perhaps some
[2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:54.800]  humility that would be a more compelling trifecta totally great so basically they got rid of three
[2:24:54.800 --> 2:24:58.720]  fda boards as they wouldn't approve this they've got a bunch of executives involved with the
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:03.920]  companies making money off of it the big question is why were they so psychotic to even try this
[2:25:03.920 --> 2:25:11.040]  and now it's all coming out doctor victory where do you see this going well unfortunately there it
[2:25:11.040 --> 2:25:17.520]  is going to take us decades alex to really understand the damage done by this pandemic
[2:25:17.520 --> 2:25:24.080]  debacle it there are so many areas as i said it's not just the vaccines that's a huge piece
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:30.880]  and we won't likely know literally for decades what the fallout is there's a reason that the average
[2:25:30.880 --> 2:25:38.640]  vaccine takes six to eight years to come to market if it ever makes it at all these vaccines had a
[2:25:38.640 --> 2:25:44.080]  paucity of safety data behind them when they started they were never tested on pregnant women
[2:25:44.080 --> 2:25:49.200]  lactating women people with autoimmune diseases or people who'd already had and recovered from
[2:25:49.200 --> 2:25:56.560]  covid we have really no idea what the long-term neurologic impact is the impact on reproductive
[2:25:56.560 --> 2:26:04.400]  health and on and on furthermore we have done untold damage to an entire generation of young
[2:26:04.400 --> 2:26:10.640]  people who were forced to wear masks socially distanced miss two and a half years of school
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:17.680]  there's a reason for example that toddlers have significant speech delay the cdc rather than
[2:26:17.680 --> 2:26:23.120]  acknowledging that wearing masks and being around you know throngs of others wearing masks rather
[2:26:23.120 --> 2:26:29.840]  than acknowledging the profoundly negative impact that has had on young children they simply went on
[2:26:29.840 --> 2:26:36.640]  quietly and unceremoniously and changed the childhood the the milestones for the number of
[2:26:36.640 --> 2:26:43.200]  words for example that a toddler should know and be able to say by the age of 24 or 30 months
[2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:49.280]  children learn to speak by mimicking mouth movements not by what they hear so the fact
[2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:56.160]  that we've had people masked for two and a half years has had a huge impact these things it is so
[2:26:56.160 --> 2:27:03.600]  deep it's going to take us a long long time and unfortunately perhaps the greatest tragedy of it
[2:27:03.600 --> 2:27:11.680]  all is that it is absolutely undermined the faith and confidence that people have in public health
[2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:17.760]  god help us when the next thing comes along because there will be a next thing i can't tell you what
[2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:24.640]  it will be but we will need to get the attention and the buy-in of the american people and the
[2:27:24.640 --> 2:27:32.160]  population globally to listen to what we have to say and to pay heed and right now the average person
[2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:38.800]  looks at public health and says you're a bunch of incompetent buffoons because well dr victory i mean
[2:27:38.800 --> 2:27:43.360]  i couldn't say it better you're saying it better than i could i mean they're admitting the next
[2:27:43.360 --> 2:27:49.040]  thing's coming this is big pharma taking over you don't want to speculate but clearly pulling back
[2:27:49.040 --> 2:27:56.080]  worldwide response was coordinated we have operation lockstep the whole thing was organized oh there's
[2:27:56.080 --> 2:28:02.480]  no question and i will you know wax i am not a conspiracy theorist but i can connect the dots
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:10.160]  the reality is that people like bill gates have wanted for a long long time to create a universal
[2:28:10.160 --> 2:28:16.560]  vaccine platform in the name of you know named mrna uh there's no question that much of what they
[2:28:16.560 --> 2:28:24.720]  did was you know a sigh up to see exactly how much people would tolerate just how quickly will people
[2:28:24.720 --> 2:28:32.480]  hand over their civil liberties on a platter uh in the name of public health fear itself fears
[2:28:32.480 --> 2:28:39.440]  an incredibly powerful intoxicant is a very good way to manipulate people i teach a course on
[2:28:39.440 --> 2:28:45.920]  leadership in times of crisis and if i had to summarize that entire seminar it's you know
[2:28:45.920 --> 2:28:52.640]  learn to recognize abject fear and terror and get yourself out of it because you don't make good

[2:33:29.680 --> 2:33:38.240]  knows hell i'm bad news everywhere i go all right well i'm really impressed with medical
[2:33:38.240 --> 2:33:43.360]  doctor kelly victory and we got cut off by a break a lot of folks are watching right now
[2:33:43.920 --> 2:33:46.880]  and i'm going to take part of this interview tomorrow and then we'll play it again it's so
[2:33:46.880 --> 2:33:54.880]  powerful powerful early covid care dot org i said connecting the dots big picture the premeditation
[2:33:54.880 --> 2:33:59.200]  of operation lockstep all the documents you said absolutely you're sort of going through that so
[2:33:59.200 --> 2:34:04.320]  start over again and and spend some time on that because they're saying new lockdowns coming new
[2:34:04.320 --> 2:34:10.000]  virus is coming they admit this shot didn't work erasure your immune system all that big picture
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:14.240]  what do you expect to come next and and speak to what you were just talking about about this being
[2:34:14.240 --> 2:34:20.960]  premeditated what's your view on that well early on i have to say early on i did not believe that
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:26.560]  i said no i i i don't you know i can't possibly connect those dots i think you'd be hard pressed
[2:34:26.560 --> 2:34:32.720]  at this point alex to not understand that there's something else bigger going on whether you want
[2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:39.760]  to say it's the great reset uh or simply look at the fact that people like bill gates uh george
[2:34:39.760 --> 2:34:45.760]  soros the people at the world economic forum and others they clearly believe that the world that the
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:53.520]  globe would benefit it would benefit significantly from a large decrease in the population uh and
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:35:00.240]  again i say that not um because i believed it initially but when you watch the behavior it
[2:35:00.240 --> 2:35:07.760]  is simply not conceivable that these people are just that incompetent there is a nefarious intent
[2:35:07.760 --> 2:35:13.120]  here you have people at the helm not just in the united states but elsewhere who have continued
[2:35:13.120 --> 2:35:18.480]  to push and push and push for example on these vaccines well let's talk about that there's
[2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:25.600]  global coordination blocking therapeutics uh early studies from the cdc predicting the
[2:35:25.600 --> 2:35:32.400]  bad side effects talk about that yes absolutely and you take um there were studies that were you
[2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:38.800]  know white table uh exercises on things like you know what would happen if we had a pandemic of this
[2:35:38.800 --> 2:35:45.200]  sort um these guys have known from the beginning whether it's masking social distancing talking
[2:35:45.200 --> 2:35:51.760]  about the idea of asymptomatic spread testing people who are asymptomatic these sorts of things are
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:58.240]  absolutely not based in the science and they have to have known that asymptomatic people have never
[2:35:58.240 --> 2:36:06.320]  been the spreaders of a pandemic or of a respiratory virus masks have never worked social distancing
[2:36:06.320 --> 2:36:13.920]  as i said earlier we've known for decades that lockdowns do far more damage than good and there's
[2:36:13.920 --> 2:36:19.920]  a reason why we haven't used them in the past we've known from the beginning that children
[2:36:19.920 --> 2:36:25.440]  frankly healthy people under the age of 50 but certainly people under the age of 18
[2:36:25.440 --> 2:36:31.600]  where it's such a de minimis risk from this virus as to be indistinguishable from zero
[2:36:31.600 --> 2:36:39.360]  yet they applied with a broad brush these mandates to everyone they acted as if everyone was an
[2:36:39.360 --> 2:36:45.680]  equivalent risk when they knew from the beginning that that was not the case and you see them doing
[2:36:45.680 --> 2:36:52.640]  it again with monkeypox all of the sudden we're going to act as if everyone is an equivalent
[2:36:52.640 --> 2:37:00.480]  risk when we know upfront who the risk groups are with covid it clearly was the elderly
[2:37:00.480 --> 2:37:06.160]  and when i say that i mean people really over the age of 75 or 80 and people with a very well
[2:37:06.160 --> 2:37:13.200]  known set of comorbidities specifically obesity diabetes and heart disease yet they acted as if
[2:37:13.200 --> 2:37:19.760]  everyone was at risk everybody must distance and lock down and stay home and bathe in purell
[2:37:19.760 --> 2:37:25.600]  and hide in fear in the basement they're doing the same thing interestingly with monkeypox
[2:37:25.600 --> 2:37:32.720]  we know who's at risk from monkeypox we know that it's not the average individual we know that 95
[2:37:32.720 --> 2:37:39.680]  percent of the people getting monkeypox identify as men and that more than 95 percent are homosexual
[2:37:39.680 --> 2:37:47.920]  or or transgender transsexual and and therefore those are the risk groups but instead we're going
[2:37:47.920 --> 2:37:52.560]  to act as if you know suburban housewives and people who aren't sexually active and young
[2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:57.280]  children are at risk they always go against the logic it's like an exercise against logic
[2:37:58.320 --> 2:38:03.680]  well you know and they there's a part of it that's just being so politically correct you know we
[2:38:03.680 --> 2:38:11.360]  need the equity has no place in public health okay unfortunately viruses don't know equity
[2:38:11.360 --> 2:38:18.000]  viruses know who their targets are and we don't do anybody any good as public health experts
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:24.640]  to call it any other way the only way we can protect those people who are truly at risk
[2:38:24.640 --> 2:38:31.280]  whether it's from covid or tuberculosis or monkeypox is to actually acknowledge who the
[2:38:31.280 --> 2:38:37.680]  risk groups are put our resources towards those risk groups you know one of the the greatest
[2:38:37.680 --> 2:38:44.720]  failures of this pandemic and that's a long list from which to choose but one of the greatest
[2:38:44.720 --> 2:38:52.000]  failures was their failure to acknowledge the the role the mandate alex of public health
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:58.960]  is to look at the impact of any particular mitigation scheme on the entire public not a
[2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:04.960]  single individual not a single disease process it's very different from when you come to see me
[2:39:04.960 --> 2:39:11.520]  in the emergency department or in my office at that time that's a one-on-one interaction and you
[2:39:11.520 --> 2:39:18.560]  are my sole concern when i put on my public health hat it's very different i have to look at the
[2:39:18.560 --> 2:39:25.840]  impact on the entire population and not just their physical health also their spiritual health
[2:39:25.840 --> 2:39:33.040]  mental health economic health so they should have known from the beginning what a lockdown
[2:39:33.040 --> 2:39:38.720]  would do and they knew it and it was all a giant a giant milgram experiment uh to basically divide
[2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:43.600]  the congress society you give us your view as a medical doctor to the psychology of this thing
[2:39:44.640 --> 2:39:49.920]  well and if you listen by the way to Debra Burks and others who freely acknowledges in her book
[2:39:49.920 --> 2:39:55.120]  that they had to be surreptitious they had to be very careful quote unquote to not let their true
[2:39:55.120 --> 2:40:01.840]  intentions be known these are her words not mine she knew they knew that if they acknowledged what
[2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:07.600]  they intended which was never simply a two-week lockdown you know two weeks to flatten the curve
[2:40:07.600 --> 2:40:13.680]  that was never their intention as Burks acknowledges in the book they knew if they'd said that however
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:20.320]  to trump being the businessman that he was that he would understand the profoundly negative impact
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:23.920]  that's right so so why are they now writing books and giving speeches
[2:40:24.640 --> 2:40:30.480]  taddling on themselves to create a new narrative it was all you know the the noble eye or what was it
[2:40:30.480 --> 2:40:36.560]  uh yes i think it's i think it's in part that and i frankly you know the rats are jumping ship uh
[2:40:36.560 --> 2:40:42.480]  anthony fouchy up and you know put turned in his notice uh he's going to be stepping down as of
[2:40:42.480 --> 2:40:47.920]  december you know three and a half decades too late but nonetheless he's finally stepping down
[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:56.240]  and i think he intends to try to get out of dodge and slink into the shadows uh before there's likely
[2:40:56.240 --> 2:41:02.560]  a republican call to to have his head and to be hauling him in front of congress um depending
[2:41:02.560 --> 2:41:08.720]  on what happens in november many of them are trying desperately to get on the right side of history
[2:41:09.280 --> 2:41:14.240]  they are trying to hitch their wagon and say oh yes we always knew i know i did this because i
[2:41:14.240 --> 2:41:20.320]  said this because it was in the best interest of the population but we always knew they're trying
[2:41:20.320 --> 2:41:27.040]  very hard to rewrite history i do not think that history will treat them kindly however
[2:41:27.040 --> 2:41:32.320]  uh and there's a long list of people who are complicit in this uh certainly fouchy's right at
[2:41:32.320 --> 2:41:40.800]  the top of that list um he was participant let's not forget in actually creating this thing called
[2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:50.000]  covid uh he absolutely funneled us taxpayer dollars uh through eco health alliance in peter dayzak to the
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:56.880]  wuhan lab in china for gain of function research uh one of the only things i truly agreed with
[2:41:56.880 --> 2:42:05.200]  president obama on was the moratorium that was put on in 2014 to gain of function research it was
[2:42:05.200 --> 2:42:11.680]  recognized as very very dangerous uh certainly something that could potentially create a super
[2:42:11.680 --> 2:42:16.560]  bug and now he's the idea and now he's purging himself to congress stay right there final segment
[2:42:16.560 --> 2:42:23.520]  very impressed kelly victory md i want to talk about big picture and and where we're going next
[2:42:23.520 --> 2:42:28.880]  the facts of the rats are leaving the sinking ship what does that signify early covered care
[2:42:28.880 --> 2:42:35.840]  dot o r g kelly victory md on getter wow the study knows what she is talking about that's why the
[2:42:35.840 --> 2:42:40.080]  global students so much trouble because they make control the top of the system but they don't control
[2:42:40.080 --> 2:42:44.720]  all these great doctors and researchers and professionals and just thank god we've had the
[2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:50.000]  the real doctors and nurses and and researchers and scientists stand up that's really expose their
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:52.720]  whole agenda and the whole thing's falling apart now that's the goodness
[2:42:52.720 --> 2:43:02.240]  do you say alex jones crazy he's a conspiracy theory guys a nutcase he got these rants and all
[2:43:02.240 --> 2:43:10.720]  that uh what they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal
[2:43:10.720 --> 2:43:18.160]  not noise if you look at the signal and you compare that to pbs and npr and bbc and we'll do what

[2:47:37.520 --> 2:47:45.600]  issue of pandemic preparedness and if there's one message that i want to leave with you today
[2:47:45.600 --> 2:47:51.440]  based on my experience and you'll see that in a moment is that there is no question that there
[2:47:51.440 --> 2:47:57.680]  will be a challenge the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases both chronic
[2:47:57.680 --> 2:48:02.400]  infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease and we have certainly a large
[2:48:02.400 --> 2:48:13.280]  burden of that but also there will be a surprise outbreak indeed doctor telling victory is our
[2:48:13.280 --> 2:48:18.160]  guest he got caught by the breaking in covering critical information please continue doctor
[2:48:18.160 --> 2:48:25.840]  well just talking about you know really really where this is going alex because i think that's
[2:48:25.840 --> 2:48:31.440]  what most people want to know um you know fauci stepping down many of them are stepping down
[2:48:31.440 --> 2:48:38.160]  fauci isn't going away though i can guarantee it uh he will pop up somewhere else likely either
[2:48:38.160 --> 2:48:43.840]  at the bill and melinda gates foundation the who or somewhere else uh in a word about the
[2:48:43.840 --> 2:48:51.280]  who by the way um the who to be very clear there's a reason why um we stepped out of it
[2:48:51.280 --> 2:48:57.280]  previously uh with president trump the who is essentially the long arm of the chinese communist
[2:48:57.280 --> 2:49:05.360]  party uh dr tedros not a who's not a medical doctor by the way dr tedros who runs the who
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:11.680]  was handpicked by the chinese communist party and he has a very different agenda the idea
[2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:18.880]  that fauci and others were involved not only in doing gain of function research uh that is very
[2:49:18.880 --> 2:49:24.960]  very dangerous but they were doing it with our greatest geopolitical foe china they were doing
[2:49:24.960 --> 2:49:31.520]  it in wuhan and there's no question that this was a lab created virus and the idea that anyone
[2:49:31.520 --> 2:49:37.440]  is suggesting that it was that it still is a naturally occurring uh virus is preposterous
[2:49:37.440 --> 2:49:43.440]  uh you need only look at the genetics of that particular virus to know it was lab manipulated
[2:49:43.440 --> 2:49:50.000]  whether it was released purposefully or out of abject incompetence i cannot say but lab created
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:57.200]  i can and there's no question anthony fauci's fingerprints are all over that so is the who
[2:49:58.080 --> 2:50:04.560]  so uh clearly people are making billions of dollars off of this pandemic and they stand to
[2:50:04.560 --> 2:50:11.680]  make billions of dollars from the next fear fest whether it's a resurgence of polio or monkeypox
[2:50:11.680 --> 2:50:19.200]  or whatever else but i think that this has been as i said a sigh up not that the virus itself wasn't
[2:50:19.200 --> 2:50:26.800]  real uh covid was very real and unfortunately many people died unnecessarily because of the
[2:50:26.800 --> 2:50:34.240]  therapeutic nihilism that occurred and the refusal of the powers that be to even allow us to talk
[2:50:34.240 --> 2:50:41.040]  about this safe effective readily available medications that we have to treat covid we had
[2:50:41.040 --> 2:50:48.320]  them from the beginning things like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and steroids for the duration
[2:50:48.320 --> 2:50:54.560]  of the pandemic the people who are supposedly the gurus of public health have failed to tell
[2:50:54.560 --> 2:51:00.320]  people about the importance of supplementing vitamin d and zinc two of the least expensive
[2:51:00.320 --> 2:51:06.400]  and simplest ways we could have prevented people from dying from not only covid but a heck of a
[2:51:06.400 --> 2:51:12.000]  lot of other viruses that are out there yet they haven't focused on that because their concern
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:18.960]  isn't really public health at all it's control it's gaining control of you your children your
[2:51:18.960 --> 2:51:26.800]  business and where you work this is the fundamental of a totalitarian society make it as miserable as
[2:51:26.800 --> 2:51:32.800]  possible so you will finally break down and say okay i'll do whatever it is you want if you'll
[2:51:32.800 --> 2:51:40.480]  just make it stop just make it go away and they hand you back some little bit of freedom something
[2:51:40.480 --> 2:51:45.920]  that months ago you would have considered your god given right and something they had no right to
[2:51:45.920 --> 2:51:53.280]  take away in the first place we've got a lot of work to do alex to rebuild and undo the damage
[2:51:53.280 --> 2:52:00.320]  that was done by this pandemic and this pandemic response it's not just the physical components
[2:52:00.320 --> 2:52:06.560]  and the the tremendous adverse events that are going to continue to happen as a result of these
[2:52:06.560 --> 2:52:14.000]  vaccines but it's really the psychological damage the economic damage the social damage
[2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:19.840]  the fractionation of families and friends over this issue of whether or not you wore a mask or
[2:52:19.840 --> 2:52:26.400]  took the dang vaccine or whatever else we've got a lot of work to do all right i only learned about
[2:52:26.400 --> 2:52:31.440]  you from this clip i've looked you up medical doctor great past great history i'm very impressed
[2:52:31.440 --> 2:52:38.160]  about a lot of amazing people dr mercola mercola you know we've had so many the other top people on
[2:52:39.680 --> 2:52:44.160]  i know you're already prominent but man we need to get you out front and center i think you're one
[2:52:44.160 --> 2:52:51.520]  of the most coherent cogent full spectrum doctors out there tell us people will know about you a
[2:52:51.520 --> 2:52:56.560]  little bit about yourself who you are and how people can contact you and how people can support
[2:52:56.560 --> 2:53:01.920]  the great work you're doing doctor well thank you very much for this platform too as i said it's
[2:53:01.920 --> 2:53:06.880]  been a tough time with the amount of censorship i am a trauma and emergency physician by training
[2:53:06.880 --> 2:53:12.720]  i practiced hospital based trauma medicine for years and then developed an interest in mass
[2:53:12.720 --> 2:53:20.320]  casualty and in disaster preparedness and response i ran the health care for companies and their
[2:53:20.320 --> 2:53:25.520]  employees and their families for many many years i happened to have been at the helm at continental
[2:53:25.520 --> 2:53:35.120]  airlines during the sars covet one pandemic in 2003 so have some some pandemic experience as well
[2:53:35.120 --> 2:53:40.960]  i did postgraduate training at the harvard school of public health and and really have spent the
[2:53:40.960 --> 2:53:48.480]  last 20 years primarily teaching i still see patients but teaching and training in everything
[2:53:48.480 --> 2:53:55.040]  from active shooter preparedness and response to this whole issue of leadership in times of crisis
[2:53:55.920 --> 2:54:03.360]  god knows we need more people at the helm during these events and people who are not afraid to speak
[2:54:03.360 --> 2:54:10.480]  openly and honestly we do know in any favors by sugarcoating the truth on the other hand as i
[2:54:10.480 --> 2:54:18.880]  said fear is not a way to lead people out of the basement i have a website with a number of other
[2:54:18.880 --> 2:54:27.040]  terrific physicians not only storied people with storied academic careers but stellar human beings
[2:54:27.040 --> 2:54:33.600]  people like doctors peter mccullough and harvey reish paul alexander george beread and that website
[2:54:33.600 --> 2:54:41.360]  is early covet care dot org it's a great website because it's a repository for a huge number
[2:54:41.360 --> 2:54:47.440]  of studies if you're interested in what i'm talking about with regard to studies for example on
[2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:54.240]  masks or social distancing or information about the vaccines we have hundreds and hundreds of
[2:54:54.240 --> 2:55:00.800]  published scientific studies there there are resources for people with regard to protocols
[2:55:00.800 --> 2:55:08.160]  to treat covet as well as covet vaccine injuries and a way to avail yourself of of telemedicine
[2:55:08.160 --> 2:55:16.960]  services if you need to talk with a physician my only real social media platform right now
[2:55:16.960 --> 2:55:22.640]  is on getter having been permanently banned from from twitter i chose not to fight that
[2:55:22.640 --> 2:55:27.760]  ban by the way it simply wasn't worth that i'm not interested in participating in a propaganda
[2:55:27.760 --> 2:55:35.680]  platform so i'm on getter at kelly victory md uh and i spend really some time doing shows like
[2:55:35.680 --> 2:55:43.120]  this one and again i so appreciate the platform because people deserve to be able to hear this
[2:55:44.080 --> 2:55:50.720]  i am was the the lead co-defendant and the lead i co excuse me co plaintiff uh the co plaintiff with
[2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:57.520]  um president trump in his class action lawsuit against big tech and again it's not because
[2:55:57.520 --> 2:56:05.120]  it's a an affront to my first amendment right to speak it's more an affront to the right of all
[2:56:05.120 --> 2:56:12.000]  americans to hear to hear the other sides um i believe that people are smart enough that they
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:17.360]  can take the information they can distill it and they can come to the best decisions for themselves
[2:56:17.360 --> 2:56:23.840]  and their families it's not anybody's right to prevent you from getting all of the information
[2:56:23.840 --> 2:56:29.520]  if people want to argue with me as i said bring it on happy to argue but let's argue about the
[2:56:29.520 --> 2:56:36.080]  facts no i totally agree well dr victory usually they say don't judge a book off its cover and i
[2:56:36.080 --> 2:56:40.080]  actually now that we're talking to you i've seen some other big stuff you're involved in but like

[2:56:58.480 --> 2:57:03.360]  expected a lot more out of this power grab they they got a lot but not what they thought and

[3:06:13.120 --> 3:06:18.000]  fourth hour of the alex jones show today i'm mike adams i'll be hosting for this hour and i'll be
[3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:25.200]  sharing breaking bombshell exclusive lab based results with you about both the composition
[3:06:25.200 --> 3:06:32.160]  of the post vaccine clots as well as a composition of one of the major covid vaccines which is showing
[3:06:32.160 --> 3:06:39.040]  trace amounts of industrial metals and elements and in case you think that's a crazy thought well
[3:06:39.040 --> 3:06:45.520]  guess what just so happens that today the epoch times has a story of a german a group of researchers
[3:06:45.520 --> 3:06:50.160]  of 60 researchers who have found essentially the the exact same thing that i had planned to
[3:06:50.160 --> 3:06:54.640]  share with you today so we're going to get into all of that tell everybody you know to tune in
[3:06:54.640 --> 3:06:59.840]  because today we're going to answer some real questions about what these post vaccine clots
[3:06:59.840 --> 3:07:05.600]  are made of what they might be doing the fact that they are self-assembling biostructures
[3:07:05.600 --> 3:07:09.360]  i'm not saying that they're alive they're not living systems they're not parasites
[3:07:09.360 --> 3:07:14.320]  but they do grow larger over time inside the circulatory system of the human body
[3:07:15.200 --> 3:07:20.640]  so tell folks to tune in we're going to be breaking all that down in the upcoming segment by the way
[3:07:20.640 --> 3:07:26.560]  but we've got other breaking news related to the vaccine to share with you first a big story
[3:07:26.560 --> 3:07:34.480]  breaking today about dan bonjino saying that he says taking the covid vaccines was the greatest
[3:07:34.480 --> 3:07:41.600]  regret of his life and first of all i want to honor the work of dan bonjino who is a great
[3:07:41.600 --> 3:07:48.080]  american a great patriot he's done tremendous work in this space he did take the vaccine early on
[3:07:48.080 --> 3:07:55.040]  and he has the courage now to come out and recognize that as he says uh he should have waited
[3:07:55.760 --> 3:08:00.400]  he saw a segment from tucker carlson and also a major thumbs up to tucker carlson
[3:08:00.400 --> 3:08:06.160]  for also having the courage to cover this and to look at the evidence look at the data about this
[3:08:06.160 --> 3:08:11.760]  and draw conclusions from the data rather than the propagandist such as fouchy and berks and
[3:08:11.760 --> 3:08:17.280]  willensky most of whom have now admitted they were wrong by the way so the data show the
[3:08:17.280 --> 3:08:21.840]  truth about what's actually happening here and people like dan bonjino and tucker carlson and
[3:08:21.840 --> 3:08:28.480]  so many others are finding the courage to come out and address this head on and by the way to call
[3:08:28.480 --> 3:08:34.400]  for potentially criminal investigations into anthony fouchy even though he's trying to resign
[3:08:34.400 --> 3:08:40.160]  before the new congress is sworn in in january i believe and many others believe that anthony
[3:08:40.160 --> 3:08:47.040]  fouchy needs to be investigated for the possibility of crimes against humanity and violations of the
[3:08:47.040 --> 3:08:53.760]  nuremberg code or his role in that scheme and by the way uh mary holland from children's health
[3:08:53.760 --> 3:09:00.960]  defense has just given a speech she's in nuremberg germany right now we in fact we're trying to reach
[3:09:00.960 --> 3:09:05.120]  out to her to get her on the show today uh she's not able to make it today but we're going to be
[3:09:05.120 --> 3:09:10.720]  talking to her soon she has given a speech that says that every person responsible for carrying out
[3:09:10.720 --> 3:09:16.320]  these crimes against humanity must be held responsible there must be investigations there
[3:09:16.320 --> 3:09:23.280]  must be prosecutions and i want to also give thumbs up to her and by the way everybody at
[3:09:23.280 --> 3:09:28.560]  children's health defense robert f kennedy junior for example who put together that amazing book
[3:09:28.560 --> 3:09:34.960]  called the real anthony fouchy and if there are two books that you want to be sure to read this year
[3:09:35.600 --> 3:09:41.760]  that's one of them and the other book is of course the great reset by alex jones and i i kind of
[3:09:41.760 --> 3:09:47.200]  chuckled uh when i was listening in at the end of alex's segment because um alex has to sign
[3:09:47.200 --> 3:09:51.920]  thousands of these books and that that is a it's a more tedious and difficult job than you might
[3:09:51.920 --> 3:09:59.200]  imagine i've had to do that before one year i signed like 2000 books of my own book and i got
[3:09:59.200 --> 3:10:04.240]  to tell you after about 500 signatures you forget how to sign your name you're like whoa wait a second
[3:10:04.240 --> 3:10:10.720]  how does this work it it alex is in for a rough ride they better bring him some some coffee and
[3:10:10.720 --> 3:10:14.720]  some turbo for so whatever is necessary because he's got to sign thousands of books that is going to
[3:10:14.720 --> 3:10:21.840]  take uh dozens of hours brought by the way to get that done anyway back to dan banjino i want to
[3:10:21.840 --> 3:10:29.440]  say dan banjino uh brother we love you we pray for you but more importantly we have solutions that
[3:10:29.440 --> 3:10:35.520]  may be able to help you when i say we i'm talking about those of us in the really um what's the
[3:10:35.520 --> 3:10:41.360]  best way to say this the pioneering alternative media those of us who are really pushing the
[3:10:41.360 --> 3:10:46.720]  boundaries so uh folks like myself i'm running the lab tests i'm i'm doing the actual test on
[3:10:46.720 --> 3:10:51.680]  these clots finding out what they're made of and what they're not made of uh people like
[3:10:51.680 --> 3:10:56.640]  dr jane ruby for example who connected me with embalmer richard hershman jane ruby is at the
[3:10:56.640 --> 3:11:06.000]  forefront of what these clots are and there are a lot of people in the alternative media who are
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:10.880]  looking at answers of how to eliminate these clots we don't have those answers yet but uh
[3:11:10.880 --> 3:11:17.360]  mr banjino if you want to stay informed connect with some of us and and you know we can we can
[3:11:17.360 --> 3:11:22.560]  keep it private if that's necessary but we can feed you cutting-edge information before it goes
[3:11:22.560 --> 3:11:28.000]  public that may help you be able to to make decisions and address uh is your body growing
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:33.440]  these clots and if so is there a way to stop these clots from growing and to thereby save
[3:11:33.440 --> 3:11:38.880]  your life because one of the things that that i'm doing remember i have an iso accredited
[3:11:38.880 --> 3:11:43.040]  laboratory i'm going to share those results in the next segment here on the alex jones show
[3:11:43.760 --> 3:11:48.720]  and we are inspected audited internationally accredited to the what's called the 17 0 25
[3:11:48.720 --> 3:11:53.520]  uh laboratory specification and we've got millions of dollars of lab equipment that we use for this
[3:11:53.520 --> 3:11:59.600]  and other scientists are doing the same thing but when we figure out how to stop the growth of these
[3:11:59.600 --> 3:12:04.960]  clots we know that we can help save the lives of millions of people maybe tens of millions around
[3:12:04.960 --> 3:12:09.040]  the world we're not there yet but the way to get there is to do these investigations
[3:12:10.320 --> 3:12:15.360]  share the ideas and and try to be able to connect with people who have this knowledge now
[3:12:15.360 --> 3:12:21.120]  uh the gateway pundit did an article on this today about dan bonjino saying that the vaccine was
[3:12:21.120 --> 3:12:25.680]  the greatest regret of his life and in that article i want to give kudos to the gateway pundit by the
[3:12:25.680 --> 3:12:31.440]  way and jim hoft and the other writers there uh they actually mentioned that natural news my website
[3:12:31.440 --> 3:12:37.440]  cannot be shared on any big tech platform you can't share it in a private message on facebook
[3:12:37.440 --> 3:12:45.440]  you can't put it in a tweet you can't talk about any of my work on uh youtube or facebook or anywhere
[3:12:45.440 --> 3:12:51.920]  and that is to the detriment of even the people working at big tech who think they're winning
[3:12:51.920 --> 3:12:57.440]  by censoring people actually they're losing because they're going to die from lack of knowledge
[3:12:57.440 --> 3:13:03.680]  because it's people like myself and others in independent media who have the answers we are
[3:13:03.680 --> 3:13:09.760]  at the forefront of this mainstream science won't touch this the nih won't fund it fauci wouldn't
[3:13:09.760 --> 3:13:14.880]  dare fund any research into how to stop the clots because they will not even acknowledge that the
[3:13:14.880 --> 3:13:22.080]  clots exist this is coming down to independent researchers in spain in germany in the united
[3:13:22.080 --> 3:13:27.440]  states such as my lab and others we are the ones who are going to solve this problem uh what is it
[3:13:27.440 --> 3:13:32.000]  la quinta columna in spain is doing tremendous work on this and i'm going to talk to you about
[3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:36.640]  this group in germany a group of 60 scientists that has come out with this new information
[3:13:36.640 --> 3:13:41.920]  about the composition of these post vaccine uh or what's in the vaccines in their case
[3:13:43.120 --> 3:13:47.520]  we are the ones who are going to solve this problem and we are the ones who are being censored
[3:13:47.520 --> 3:13:52.000]  so think about this the the very leftists who think they're winning they're the ones who are
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:57.920]  going to be dying because of lack of knowledge and google has become a disinformation or
[3:13:57.920 --> 3:14:03.760]  anti-knowledge search engine google's mission is to bury the truth and bury solutions that could
[3:14:03.760 --> 3:14:10.160]  save humanity from the mass death that is coming now back to what bonjino said and he's correct
[3:14:10.160 --> 3:14:16.720]  about this he understands that there are going to be years of increased risk from these vaccines
[3:14:16.720 --> 3:14:22.720]  in people who got them and ed dowd spoke yesterday with alex jones with some bombshell shocking
[3:14:22.720 --> 3:14:28.880]  information from the insurance industry indicating that these deaths are accelerating and we are
[3:14:28.880 --> 3:14:34.560]  approaching what will be we're not there yet but a 100 increase in excess deaths in the united
[3:14:34.560 --> 3:14:40.320]  states and that would be about an additional 7500 people dying per day in the united states once
[3:14:40.320 --> 3:14:45.040]  that level is reached and i believe it will be reached before the end of this year so we're
[3:14:45.040 --> 3:14:51.920]  talking about two nine elevens every day happening from the vaccines in the united states probably
[3:14:51.920 --> 3:14:57.680]  by the end of this year so if we can find solutions we could help save thousands of lives over 7 000
[3:14:57.680 --> 3:15:03.120]  lives per day potentially but only if we can get this information out and that's why this
[3:15:03.120 --> 3:15:08.080]  platform info wars dot com is so crucial for humanity that's why your support of info wars
[3:15:08.080 --> 3:15:13.280]  is crucial your support of all of us in independent media so please do everything you can get the

[3:15:56.800 --> 3:16:01.840]  i don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer a rancher a doctor
[3:16:01.840 --> 3:16:07.120]  a lawyer or a millionaire fortune and money magazine have all done these profiles you see it every
[3:16:07.120 --> 3:16:12.640]  year 30 different tax returns 30 different answers 50 different tax returns 50 different answers
[3:16:12.640 --> 3:16:18.320]  and almost all of them just screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups
[3:16:18.320 --> 3:16:22.320]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and
[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:27.280]  knowing this so it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting

[3:20:09.280 --> 3:20:16.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[3:20:16.560 --> 3:20:19.040]  it's mike adams
[3:20:22.400 --> 3:20:27.120]  all right prepare for some bombshells here today folks welcome back mike adams here hosting the
[3:20:27.120 --> 3:20:33.840]  alex joneshow on info wars dot com spread the word we're gonna get into some hardcore exclusive
[3:20:33.840 --> 3:20:39.440]  laboratory results of what's in these vaccines and also what is in these post vaccine clots that
[3:20:39.440 --> 3:20:45.600]  appear to be responsible for these sudden deaths and are you aware that in some areas of the world
[3:20:45.600 --> 3:20:52.240]  now unexplained deaths that's the leading cause of death now they can't explain what it is but
[3:20:52.240 --> 3:20:57.920]  it's of course the clots blocking blood flow to the organs and the brain and then people quote
[3:20:57.920 --> 3:21:02.640]  died suddenly so that's what's happening and it's accelerating all around the world
[3:21:04.000 --> 3:21:08.720]  before i get into those numbers a quick comment from the last segment you know we're mentioning
[3:21:08.720 --> 3:21:15.200]  dan bonjino saying that taking the code vaccine he says was the the greatest mistake of his life
[3:21:15.200 --> 3:21:20.960]  or the worst mistake of his of his life and again to his credit for mentioning that but
[3:21:20.960 --> 3:21:26.480]  you know the gop in particular has been i'm not talking about bonjino but but just the
[3:21:26.480 --> 3:21:32.800]  institution of the gop has been in bed with big pharma for a long long time and so for a lot of
[3:21:32.800 --> 3:21:38.720]  people in the gop there wasn't a lot there wasn't sufficient skepticism about what the vaccine
[3:21:38.720 --> 3:21:43.600]  industry might be up to in fact it has taken quite a bit of time for people to come around at that
[3:21:43.600 --> 3:21:49.280]  point of view and what's fascinating to me about this is that leftists or or democrats
[3:21:49.280 --> 3:21:54.720]  used to be anti-corporation you talk about the george bush years in particular the democrats
[3:21:54.720 --> 3:22:00.320]  were anti-war they were anti-corporation they were anti-pharma and of course they were anti
[3:22:00.320 --> 3:22:07.360]  monsanto i mean i used to march in in the march against monsanto events one of them was in austin
[3:22:07.360 --> 3:22:12.160]  texas i was right i was a speaker at that event and i'm pretty sure most of the people marching
[3:22:12.160 --> 3:22:20.240]  there were uh democrats and leftists at the time but everything's flipped so today conservatives
[3:22:20.240 --> 3:22:26.080]  are starting to realize whoa these corporations are incredibly dangerous big tech big pharma and
[3:22:26.080 --> 3:22:32.400]  big vaccine they're probably out to kill us is what it turns out to be and at the same time
[3:22:33.600 --> 3:22:40.320]  leftists are abandoning their position of being against things like gmo's or toxic chemicals
[3:22:40.320 --> 3:22:45.840]  and it's so bizarre because you know two years ago leftists were anti-police today they're pro-fbi
[3:22:46.480 --> 3:22:50.960]  like defund the police but more money for the fbi i'm like what what are you talking about
[3:22:50.960 --> 3:22:57.120]  and i did an interview recently with a longtime friend of mine david wolf uh david avocado wolf
[3:22:57.120 --> 3:23:02.880]  he's been in the health industry natural health and nutrition for a decades he's the guy who
[3:23:02.880 --> 3:23:09.520]  actually first introduced me to avocado smoothies and drinking cacao which is you know chocolate
[3:23:09.520 --> 3:23:15.760]  just powdered cacao nibs and so on and he has come to the same realization that you and i have
[3:23:16.640 --> 3:23:23.280]  that all of these the mass poisoning of humanity is taking place right now through vaccines through
[3:23:23.280 --> 3:23:29.680]  gmo's through pesticides and we had better wake up and fight for our liberty and our health freedom
[3:23:29.680 --> 3:23:35.600]  and fight for truth on all of this and uh he's moved to texas also so another person who moved
[3:23:35.600 --> 3:23:41.600]  from california to texas totally gets it totally on board with what's going on and came out of the
[3:23:41.600 --> 3:23:46.800]  natural health industry as i did and now fighting for human freedom so i just want to give that
[3:23:46.800 --> 3:23:53.600]  background and now we're going to jump into this so okay first things first i've got preliminary
[3:23:53.600 --> 3:23:58.400]  results to release on the vaccine i'm not going to say which vaccine this is yet but this is one
[3:23:58.400 --> 3:24:05.680]  of the big three vaccines and i've done icp ms tests in my lab again we are an iso accredited
[3:24:05.680 --> 3:24:11.120]  laboratory so everything that that we produce in terms of lab results can be entered as evidence in
[3:24:11.120 --> 3:24:17.600]  a court of law anywhere in the world at least in western civilization countries now what we found
[3:24:17.600 --> 3:24:23.200]  in these tests is quite shocking is that when you take this vaccine out of the vaccine vial
[3:24:23.200 --> 3:24:29.760]  using a hypodermic needle and then you inject it into the human body or i guess anybody for that
[3:24:29.760 --> 3:24:36.320]  matter here are some of the elements that are injected into your body and again this is confirmed
[3:24:36.320 --> 3:24:43.520]  we're going to release these results along with the pdf file vanadium chromium manganese nickel
[3:24:43.520 --> 3:24:52.880]  copper arsenic selenium strontium molybdenum cadmium lead and uranium all of these elements
[3:24:52.880 --> 3:24:58.000]  most of which are metals are found and and by the way what what they're showing you there
[3:24:58.880 --> 3:25:04.960]  is what's on your screen is different from what i'm talking about just just a note there we're
[3:25:04.960 --> 3:25:09.920]  going to get into what's in the clot and what's in the blood which is what that chart was but i'm
[3:25:09.920 --> 3:25:15.280]  what i'm mentioning right now we don't yet have a chart for it but this is coming out these are
[3:25:15.280 --> 3:25:21.440]  elements that are in the vaccine and these are present in trace amounts these are industrial
[3:25:21.440 --> 3:25:28.480]  metals and they absolutely do not belong in any vaccine or in anything that is injected into the
[3:25:28.480 --> 3:25:35.680]  human body now if you thought that well how do you know for sure that's the case you know where's
[3:25:35.680 --> 3:25:42.240]  the confirmation where has this been replicated uh the epoch times has a story today unusual toxic
[3:25:42.240 --> 3:25:48.160]  components found in covid vaccines without exception say german scientists that's the headline
[3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:54.000]  and it's a group of independent german scientists it's 60 of them they have found toxic components
[3:25:54.560 --> 3:26:00.880]  mostly metallic in all of the covid vaccine samples they analyze without exception using
[3:26:00.880 --> 3:26:04.560]  modern medical and physical measuring techniques so this is called the working group for covid
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:12.000]  vaccine analysis and they've tested astrozenica thyser and moderna vaccine vials which are the
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:17.280]  same three that i'm testing and uh they have found the following they found alkali metals such as
[3:26:17.280 --> 3:26:23.920]  cesium and potassium they found alkaline earth metals such as calcium and barium they've also
[3:26:23.920 --> 3:26:30.720]  found i'm reading from that story cobalt iron chromium and titanium so you notice these are
[3:26:30.720 --> 3:26:36.240]  overlapping with some of our own lab tests that i just mentioned they found aluminum we're going to
[3:26:36.240 --> 3:26:40.080]  talk about aluminum here in a second because aluminum is a key element that's being found
[3:26:40.080 --> 3:26:45.760]  in these post vaccine clots and aluminum is electrically conductive which is a critical
[3:26:45.760 --> 3:26:55.440]  element they're also finding silicon and sulfur now again getting back to what i found in my lab
[3:26:55.440 --> 3:27:00.480]  vanadium chromium manganese nickel copper arsenic selenium strontium molybdenum cadmium
[3:27:00.480 --> 3:27:05.920]  lead and uranium starting to sound like that song by timothy larer the elements song right
[3:27:06.480 --> 3:27:10.320]  which i'm not going to try to sing here but you get the idea these elements do not belong
[3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:16.400]  in these vaccines and they are confirmed now not just from my independent laboratory but also with
[3:27:16.400 --> 3:27:21.120]  this german group that frankly i'd like to get in touch with so we could share results the epoch
[3:27:21.120 --> 3:27:26.880]  times has the courage to cover this and so does info wars info wars has the courage to bring me on
[3:27:26.880 --> 3:27:32.160]  to break this news exclusive news about what's in these vaccines mainstream media won't touch it
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:37.600]  so the people reading the mainstream media don't know they're being injected with industrial metals
[3:27:37.600 --> 3:27:42.400]  these are the kinds of metals that make you sick if you have a medical implant that goes bad
[3:27:43.120 --> 3:27:48.080]  if you get too much titanium in your blood what do you think happens to you bad things happen
[3:27:48.080 --> 3:27:55.280]  you get sick you get fatigued you get ill your immune system just gets crushed and then you think
[3:27:55.280 --> 3:28:02.000]  about oh there's also lead in this and cadmium heavy metals linked to low iqs linked to heart
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:06.720]  problems cardiovascular problems there's uranium what's uranium doing in this i'm not claiming it's
[3:28:06.720 --> 3:28:11.440]  radioactive there are no radio isotopes that we detected but it's still the element uranium
[3:28:11.440 --> 3:28:15.680]  what's arsenic doing in this another heavy metal that's actually responsible for more
[3:28:15.680 --> 3:28:21.440]  cancer deaths in well water than any other element in the world all throughout third world arsenic
[3:28:21.440 --> 3:28:25.840]  kills more people than anything else did you know that because it's in well water well it's also in
[3:28:25.840 --> 3:28:35.200]  your vaccines folks it's in your vaccines nickel another toxic metal it folks you are looking at
[3:28:35.200 --> 3:28:39.440]  the mass poisoning of humanity and i haven't even gotten to what's in the clots we're going to cover
[3:28:39.440 --> 3:28:44.880]  that in the next segment so don't go anywhere spread the word keep watching we'll be right back
[3:28:44.880 --> 3:28:50.240]  after this break here on the alex jones show info wars dot com we're going to look at what's in the
[3:28:50.240 --> 3:28:57.760]  clots that are killing people all over the world stay with us the best product i'm not i'm not
[3:28:57.760 --> 3:29:00.880]  supposed to be biased but i'm going to tell you all now if you haven't tried turbo force you need to
[3:29:00.880 --> 3:29:06.320]  try it i've tried turbo force with everything sometimes you know i went a little bit crazy i

[3:32:44.160 --> 3:32:48.720]  in pages or you're going to be having a pin out you're going to be underlying stuff great reset
[3:32:48.720 --> 3:32:54.960]  by alex jones order your copy now at amazon or info wars store dot com
[3:32:54.960 --> 3:33:04.240]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:33:13.120 --> 3:33:20.560]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance it's
[3:33:20.560 --> 3:33:29.360]  mike adams you're listening to the alex jones show all right buckle up folks we're going to get
[3:33:29.360 --> 3:33:35.840]  into the lab test results of the clots that are killing people weeks or months after being vaccinated
[3:33:35.840 --> 3:33:41.520]  i just want to show you this what i talked about last segment the elements that are in the vaccines
[3:33:41.520 --> 3:33:46.400]  here is a shot of how i'm doing this i've got a vaccine vial here i don't know if i've got the
[3:33:46.400 --> 3:33:54.800]  right focus range for you and i'm using a hypodermic needle to take the sample of the vaccine and to
[3:33:54.800 --> 3:34:00.880]  run it via ic pms and of course we've got quite a few of these using safety precautions frankly i
[3:34:00.880 --> 3:34:07.840]  only handle those under a fume hood and wearing these latex gloves which i'm not going to touch
[3:34:07.840 --> 3:34:13.840]  that stuff without wearing some protection but if you're just joining us we found in one of the
[3:34:13.840 --> 3:34:17.760]  main vaccines we're going to release all these results in more detail we found all these industrial
[3:34:17.760 --> 3:34:25.440]  metals including chromium and selenium arsenic cadmium lead and uranium and others and we this
[3:34:25.440 --> 3:34:30.240]  is also being confirmed by a german research group that's been covered by the epoch times
[3:34:30.240 --> 3:34:36.240]  and i was joking about the table of elements song i i i misstated the the creator of that song is
[3:34:36.240 --> 3:34:40.880]  tom larer by the way so if you want to look up that song it's a really funny song he goes through
[3:34:40.880 --> 3:34:46.560]  all the table of elements seeing about them it's a it's a hoot if you can memorize that okay let's
[3:34:46.560 --> 3:34:53.600]  get into the clots all right now to the producers the the charts that i say the pds we're going to
[3:34:53.600 --> 3:34:59.040]  be showing those here one of them is labeled blood which is live human blood from an unvaccinated
[3:34:59.040 --> 3:35:06.160]  person and the other chart is clots which is one of these clots that was sent to me by embalmer
[3:35:06.160 --> 3:35:12.480]  richard hershman thanks to dr jane ruby for making that connection we've got more tests coming up but
[3:35:12.480 --> 3:35:17.600]  here are the results that i've got to share with you this is groundbreaking this is exclusive
[3:35:17.600 --> 3:35:27.040]  information here on info wars dot com number one the blood has markers of life and those include
[3:35:27.040 --> 3:35:36.160]  iron and magnesium and zinc and and other things the clot is lacking almost all of those markers
[3:35:36.160 --> 3:35:42.960]  of life in other words the clot only has about 4.4 percent of the iron of human blood in other
[3:35:42.960 --> 3:35:48.640]  words the clot is missing almost 96 percent of the iron that would be expected to be there if
[3:35:48.640 --> 3:35:55.840]  they were blood clots which means folks these are not blood clots and we we have to remember
[3:35:55.840 --> 3:36:01.040]  that when we're talking about people dying from quote blood clots these are not blood clots they're
[3:36:01.040 --> 3:36:07.200]  clots of something else they're missing most of the magnesium they're missing most of the zinc
[3:36:07.200 --> 3:36:12.240]  they're missing all of these other biomarkers including a potassium there's a very high potassium
[3:36:12.240 --> 3:36:16.320]  level in human blood we've got the charts i sent them over to info wars they showed you some of
[3:36:16.320 --> 3:36:22.560]  those just there that there's more at the same time that these clots are missing the markers of
[3:36:22.560 --> 3:36:28.960]  life that would be expected to be seen in human blood the clots are higher in certain elements
[3:36:29.600 --> 3:36:38.640]  that happen to be more related to electronics or industrial machinery or conductive elements
[3:36:40.080 --> 3:36:43.280]  now you're going to have to draw your own conclusions from this i'm not saying we know
[3:36:43.280 --> 3:36:49.280]  exactly what these are however we can confirm that the post vaccine clots that are killing people
[3:36:49.280 --> 3:36:55.760]  the clots that are being pulled out of the bodies of dead victims post vaccine they contain over
[3:36:55.760 --> 3:37:02.400]  five times higher levels concentrations of tin which is used in alloys for soldering electronic
[3:37:02.400 --> 3:37:09.280]  circuits it has about almost a 50 percent higher level of aluminum which is electrically conductive
[3:37:09.280 --> 3:37:14.960]  and it is a replacement for copper lines in residential wiring and electronics also commercial
[3:37:14.960 --> 3:37:21.920]  wiring and the clots are higher in sodium about 50 percent higher in sodium which is an alkaline
[3:37:21.920 --> 3:37:26.720]  metal that is highly conductive a lot of people don't think about sodium being a conductor but
[3:37:26.720 --> 3:37:34.160]  it it is trust me um just go test the seawater and you'll find out but the point is the clot is
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:39.600]  lacking the elements of life that you would expect to see in human blood and at the same time the
[3:37:39.600 --> 3:37:46.160]  clot is higher in concentrations of elements that conduct electricity and that you would expect to
[3:37:46.160 --> 3:37:54.080]  find in non-human things things that might have electronics in them things that shouldn't be in
[3:37:54.080 --> 3:38:00.000]  the body probably now what's interesting to me is that this german group has also mentioned let me
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:07.120]  bring it up here the aluminum they've also confirmed they found yes excess aluminum in the
[3:38:07.120 --> 3:38:13.760]  vaccine and i'm seeing the aluminum at higher levels in the clot so the result of this or let's
[3:38:13.760 --> 3:38:22.640]  say the the conclusion is that these clots number one they're not made of blood number two they are
[3:38:22.640 --> 3:38:29.920]  self assembling structures they are growing larger over time inside the blood number three as they
[3:38:29.920 --> 3:38:38.320]  are doing that they are somehow harvesting or absorbing or using metals or conductive elements
[3:38:38.320 --> 3:38:42.800]  from the blood and they are concentrating them into higher concentrations than what would be
[3:38:42.800 --> 3:38:48.480]  found in human blood or even in human blood vessel tissue or human muscle tissue for that matter
[3:38:49.040 --> 3:38:54.400]  now i'm not saying that i know what these clots are i don't know exactly what they are this is
[3:38:54.400 --> 3:39:01.680]  a process of elimination of being able to find out what they are not and trying to share information
[3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:06.480]  with other scientists so that we can eventually get to the bottom of this remember we're doing
[3:39:06.480 --> 3:39:11.120]  this without any government funding obviously Fauci and the NIH and the NIAID they're not going to
[3:39:11.120 --> 3:39:15.920]  give us money to do this research no this is all self funded folks due to supporters like you but
[3:39:15.920 --> 3:39:20.960]  we're finding out what these are not they are not something that we would normally find in human
[3:39:20.960 --> 3:39:31.360]  bodies end of story now on top of that there is an article published in a journal nature
[3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:39.600]  communications i believe it is that talks about graphing being used to build electric circuits
[3:39:40.160 --> 3:39:44.400]  graphing can be made into circuits that can receive information we've covered that in
[3:39:44.400 --> 3:39:47.840]  natural news i'll i'll i'll pull up the story for you in the next segment so we can go through
[3:39:47.840 --> 3:39:52.080]  that but that's a journal article that talks about graphing being used to build circuitry
[3:39:52.080 --> 3:39:56.720]  that can both send and receive electromagnetic information and again that's published in a
[3:39:56.720 --> 3:40:02.160]  mainstream journal i think that was published in 2014 we'll confirm that in the next segment
[3:40:02.160 --> 3:40:06.960]  but folks i'm gonna tell you what else i know about these clots because i have a bunch of them
[3:40:07.520 --> 3:40:12.320]  and they they gross me out by the way i'm very careful when working with them they are strong
[3:40:12.320 --> 3:40:18.640]  they're strong like rubber bands you saw that when i was in the infowars studio with a microscope
[3:40:18.640 --> 3:40:24.000]  and we were pulling them with tweezers under the microscope and they were they were they had this
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:29.840]  tensile strength that you don't see in blood clots folks you don't see that in blood there's
[3:40:29.840 --> 3:40:34.480]  something kind of kind of rubbery almost like a polymer i'm not claiming it's a polymer but it's
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:39.680]  it's it's rubbery like kind of like a pencil eraser so yeah there's a photo of some of these
[3:40:39.680 --> 3:40:45.920]  clots they are very very strong secondly we know at least my conclusion so far is these clots are
[3:40:45.920 --> 3:40:52.480]  not living they are not parasites they're not worms they don't appear to have any of their own
[3:40:52.480 --> 3:40:56.400]  circulatory systems or nervous systems or digestive systems or anything of the kind
[3:40:56.400 --> 3:41:02.640]  they are self-assembling biostructures that are dead but growing and and by the way that's
[3:41:02.640 --> 3:41:09.600]  not unheard of in nature for example prions they're not alive either but prions can grow in terms of
[3:41:09.600 --> 3:41:15.360]  their aggregate mass they're misfolded proteins and they can spread and grow in a brain or other
[3:41:15.360 --> 3:41:18.720]  nervous tissue even though they're not living themselves and in fact according to mainstream
[3:41:18.720 --> 3:41:23.120]  science viruses aren't living but yet they can replicate as well so it's not strange to say
[3:41:23.120 --> 3:41:30.320]  that a non-living system can self-assemble in fact that's part of the definition of what viruses do
[3:41:30.320 --> 3:41:35.520]  according to mainstream virology so these are self-assembling biostructures they're growing
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:42.240]  larger over time and as people like Steve Kirsch and Ed Dowd are noticing a whole lot of people are
[3:41:42.240 --> 3:41:48.800]  dying from well a whole lot of people are dying after the vaccines right now but what I'm here
[3:41:48.800 --> 3:41:55.840]  to tell you is that that is a fraction of what's coming the deaths have only just begun there have
[3:41:55.840 --> 3:42:02.000]  been over 12 billion injections given on this planet that's more than one COVID vaccine injection
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:08.720]  for every person living on this planet over 12 billion injections those injections are right
[3:42:08.720 --> 3:42:15.520]  now growing these clots in people's cardiovascular systems they're going to take months in some cases
[3:42:15.520 --> 3:42:20.000]  weeks and others maybe years in a few but eventually many of these people who have been
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:24.480]  injected if we don't find a way to reverse this many of those people are going to die
[3:42:25.280 --> 3:42:30.480]  from these vaccine clots these self-replicating systems that appear to have been programmed
[3:42:30.480 --> 3:42:37.120]  to be built inside the human circulatory system eventually cutting off the blood supply to the
[3:42:37.120 --> 3:42:42.640]  heart or the brain or other critical organs and the entire mainstream media the entire
[3:42:42.640 --> 3:42:48.240]  mainstream science realm will not touch this topic you only get it here on infowars.com and in

[3:47:04.160 --> 3:47:23.920]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow with mike adams
[3:47:27.360 --> 3:47:31.360]  all right folks final segment here on the alex joneshow on mike adams sharing exclusive
[3:47:31.360 --> 3:47:37.040]  laboratory results of the composition of the clots the post vaccine clots that appear to be
[3:47:37.040 --> 3:47:42.720]  killing people coming probably by the millions by the way current estimates are that anywhere
[3:47:42.720 --> 3:47:48.320]  between five to 12 million people have been killed worldwide so far by these vaccines and i believe
[3:47:48.320 --> 3:47:54.240]  that has only just begun but as a global depopulation weapon by the way it's not working as well as i
[3:47:54.240 --> 3:47:58.000]  think the globalists had hoped and that's why they're having to accelerate the food scarcity
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:48:05.200]  the energy shutdowns and of course the coming money supply collapse or crash or however you
[3:48:05.200 --> 3:48:12.640]  want to describe that but getting back to what these clots are here's an article excuse me this is
[3:48:12.640 --> 3:48:18.240]  from we published this yesterday on natural news nature journal reveals how graphene can be used
[3:48:18.240 --> 3:48:24.400]  to assemble radio frequency electronics in biological systems and this is a 2014 paper
[3:48:24.400 --> 3:48:32.240]  the paper is entitled graphing radio frequency receiver integrated circuit and it explains how
[3:48:32.240 --> 3:48:38.480]  graphing has superior electrical properties and has strong potential as a future channel
[3:48:38.480 --> 3:48:44.800]  material in radio frequency electronics they talk about a method to fabricate integrated circuits
[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:53.280]  using nothing but graphing and that this resulting circuit was able to quote perform practical
[3:48:53.280 --> 3:49:00.400]  wireless communication functions receiving and restoring digital text transmitted on a
[3:49:00.400 --> 3:49:06.800]  4.3 gigahertz carrier signal you starting to get the picture folks now i find it fascinating that
[3:49:06.800 --> 3:49:14.480]  graphing alone can be made into essentially a little radio receiver if it's structured correctly
[3:49:15.280 --> 3:49:21.600]  and that's separate from the metals the conductive elements that we're seeing in these clots because
[3:49:21.600 --> 3:49:25.440]  you know you can make circuits of course out of aluminum it doesn't always have to be
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:30.640]  copper let's say you can make them out of aluminum you can use tin as an alloy in these
[3:49:30.640 --> 3:49:37.120]  circuits and the question to me is if these clots are self-assembling which means they are self
[3:49:37.120 --> 3:49:43.200]  organizing these elements in some fashion that we don't yet understand my question is
[3:49:44.480 --> 3:49:49.600]  what programming are they following because let's back up for a second the vaccine companies
[3:49:49.600 --> 3:49:56.480]  themselves say that the way these vaccines work and this is not a conspiracy theory this is
[3:49:56.480 --> 3:50:03.680]  moderna describing how their vaccines work is to download in essence new programming into your
[3:50:03.680 --> 3:50:10.000]  body's cells into the ribosomes in particular and it's a program that your body follows to
[3:50:10.000 --> 3:50:17.440]  manufacture substances that are alien to the human body that's the official explanation of how vaccines
[3:50:17.440 --> 3:50:26.880]  work so these mRNA fragments how do we know what instructions they contain how do we know if they
[3:50:26.880 --> 3:50:34.320]  don't get severed or have concatenation which means combining of mRNA sequences maybe the
[3:50:34.320 --> 3:50:40.320]  polyethylene glycol doesn't work perfectly on the end caps and since people are being injected with
[3:50:40.320 --> 3:50:46.960]  billions of these particles well sequences little strings of biological code is it possible that
[3:50:46.960 --> 3:50:53.440]  some of those billions get altered some of them get deleted or inserted or concatenated as I said
[3:50:53.440 --> 3:51:01.360]  or just I don't know added together right I can concatenate concatenation and then they start to
[3:51:01.360 --> 3:51:06.560]  build something that maybe wasn't even intended or maybe it was intended but what if it's not what if
[3:51:06.560 --> 3:51:13.520]  there is an accidental side effect to this that causes the body to build these massive structures
[3:51:13.520 --> 3:51:21.520]  that they can't stop the growth what if that's what we're seeing with these clots or again maybe
[3:51:21.520 --> 3:51:25.760]  it's on purpose maybe this is a very clever way to kill a lot of people over time while claiming
[3:51:25.760 --> 3:51:31.600]  to be giving them medicine what if there's graphene being organized in these structures as well
[3:51:33.200 --> 3:51:39.680]  then could electromagnetic pollution affect people who have been vaccinated and I'm not
[3:51:39.680 --> 3:51:44.640]  even saying intentionally I'm not saying that people are being injected with you know alien
[3:51:44.640 --> 3:51:48.800]  circuits or anything like that I'm just saying you know there is something called induction
[3:51:49.680 --> 3:51:54.400]  if you have elements organized in your body in a certain way and and there are electromagnetic
[3:51:54.400 --> 3:52:00.640]  radio waves or microwaves around you it will cause changes in the material or even vibrations in
[3:52:00.640 --> 3:52:07.440]  the material this is true by the way with fillings in your teeth as well if you have fillings in
[3:52:07.440 --> 3:52:12.160]  certain orientations it can affect the electrical activity in your mouth and in your skull a lot
[3:52:12.160 --> 3:52:17.680]  of people know that in holistic dentistry by the way and I'm saying what's going to happen when
[3:52:17.680 --> 3:52:23.920]  people who have these post vaccine clots that are organizing these conductive materials in some way
[3:52:23.920 --> 3:52:28.960]  that we don't yet understand what's going to happen when they're subjected to 5g radiation or
[3:52:28.960 --> 3:52:34.640]  directed energy weapons dews that are fired upon them under crowd control circumstances
[3:52:34.640 --> 3:52:40.640]  what happens when they're hit with microwave frequencies or even just going through the
[3:52:40.640 --> 3:52:46.480]  the tsa scanner at the airport or just sitting around in a city with a lot of radio waves
[3:52:46.480 --> 3:52:52.160]  around you or maybe electromagnetic pollution from electric cars can that cause induction
[3:52:52.800 --> 3:52:58.560]  in some of these structures that are in people's bodies can it cause them to heat up
[3:52:58.560 --> 3:53:02.960]  we don't know the answers I'm just asking questions right now these are questions
[3:53:02.960 --> 3:53:08.320]  that no one in mainstream science is even willing to ask you know they claim to have a monopoly
[3:53:08.320 --> 3:53:12.320]  on truth but they're not willing to entertain questions that they don't like so they censor it
[3:53:13.760 --> 3:53:20.480]  well I would just say thank god that info wars and alex jones and people like myself and many
[3:53:20.480 --> 3:53:27.520]  others we said from day one don't take these shots and once again info wars has been vindicated
[3:53:27.520 --> 3:53:32.480]  alex jones was right yet again because he said it from day one I was right there with him saying
[3:53:32.480 --> 3:53:37.200]  it from day one do not take these shots they're not even approved they're experimental injections
[3:53:37.200 --> 3:53:43.840]  this is experimental medicine these are violations of the nuremberg code in fact let me read for you
[3:53:44.400 --> 3:53:50.160]  from mary holland's speech that she just gave in nuremberg Germany and this is published on
[3:53:50.160 --> 3:53:55.760]  children's health defense dot org those who violated the nuremberg code must be prosecuted for crimes
[3:53:55.760 --> 3:54:00.640]  against humanity she says in the last two and a half years we have witnessed a global assault on
[3:54:00.640 --> 3:54:07.040]  the nuremberg code governments medical establishments universities and the media have violated the very
[3:54:07.040 --> 3:54:13.360]  first principle and every other principle of the code's 10 points they have coerced people into being
[3:54:13.360 --> 3:54:19.440]  human guinea pigs those who have intentionally knowingly and maliciously violated the principles
[3:54:19.440 --> 3:54:26.000]  of the nuremberg code must be punished says mary holland they must be called out prosecuted and
[3:54:26.000 --> 3:54:32.960]  punished for crimes against humanity this is one of our key tasks because she says we live in
[3:54:32.960 --> 3:54:37.600]  dangerous times if world governments and the collaborators continue to flout the nuremberg
[3:54:37.600 --> 3:54:44.000]  code and censor those of us who criticize the big lie we know where this leads it leads to atrocities
[3:54:44.560 --> 3:54:51.360]  it leads to a legacy of ashes and i i fear that legacy of ashes cannot even be stopped
[3:54:51.360 --> 3:54:57.600]  right now i don't know how how many millions or tens of millions of people are going to die
[3:54:58.480 --> 3:55:04.400]  but i think it's going to be a lot unless we find solutions mary holland continues we've
[3:55:04.400 --> 3:55:08.160]  already witnessed terrible atrocities in the last two and a half years children and teens
[3:55:08.160 --> 3:55:13.760]  becoming disabled and dying needlessly adults and elders receiving deadly treatments and being
[3:55:13.760 --> 3:55:21.760]  denied lifesaving medicine medicine that the late zev zelenko was trying to help promote quercetin
[3:55:21.760 --> 3:55:27.600]  zinc vitamin d and so on families separated from one another and interned in quarantine camps
[3:55:27.600 --> 3:55:33.120]  against their will yes this is a living hell on earth this is a giant prison planet that has
[3:55:33.120 --> 3:55:38.000]  been created by these globalists and they're trying to prevent the people of the world from
[3:55:38.000 --> 3:55:44.720]  realizing that their bodies have been hijacked in a biological cyber warfare attack to turn
[3:55:45.280 --> 3:55:52.480]  their biology against themselves so their bodies build clot structures that will kill them
[3:55:53.040 --> 3:56:00.640]  over the next several years and the average person is oblivious to this and the average leftists
[3:56:00.640 --> 3:56:06.800]  wouldn't believe it even if you showed them the clots on an mri scan or something they still
[3:56:06.800 --> 3:56:10.720]  wouldn't believe it they would double down on it they would say oh no it's good we took the vaccines
[3:56:11.360 --> 3:56:14.880]  oh because these clots must need more pharmaceuticals more medicine more surgery more
[3:56:14.880 --> 3:56:19.440]  radiation and even more vaccines there there there are more pox's out there more vaccines
