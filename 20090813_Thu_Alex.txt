[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:33.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.000 --> 00:49.000]  we're going to be live here for the next four hours today Wayne Madsen is going to join us on a host of issues
[00:49.000 --> 00:56.000]  Wayne Madsen report he also is a contributor to multiple TV radio stations Russia Today you name it
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  formerly worked with the National Security Agency and reports from Capitol Hill he'll be on about a whole host of issues
[01:03.000 --> 01:15.000]  including an intriguing statement he made this week that the Israeli lobby well one sector of it there's different factions
[01:15.000 --> 01:33.000]  and I actually do see a few indicators of that from a few of the usual suspects so I I mean I want the truth
[01:33.000 --> 01:43.000]  and so I've learned to really respect the insight and information Wayne brings out so he'll be joining us in the last hour today
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  and I'm not taking sides on this I don't believe a word Obama says I didn't believe a word Bush said
[01:49.000 --> 01:57.000]  but we do have to look at all the different angles so we'll grill him on that a bunch of other issues coming up
[01:57.000 --> 02:05.000]  in fact how long do we have him booked for 45 minutes that's perfect I want to make sure we have plenty of time with him
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.000]  maybe we should call him and go ahead and get a full hour and see if he can be at a landline because
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.000]  Wayne's a great guy has a tendency to do the interviews from subway trains and things so that is coming up and we have a
[02:15.000 --> 02:27.000]  surprise guest that rescheduled last week and then was set for Monday and rescheduled again today now in my experience when somebody's rescheduling
[02:27.000 --> 02:36.000]  they'll just cancel they're going to cancel and my experience is that one of these big wigs they're just very busy
[02:36.000 --> 02:45.000]  but I'm not holding my breath it is a very big interview I believe it at that and I want the crew to continue even if they reschedule today I want to
[02:45.000 --> 02:59.000]  it's like you get a fish up to the boat four or five times I want to finally get it in the boat and we'll see if it happens today
[02:59.000 --> 03:13.000]  you know I have a goal and that is to take a lot of phone calls and to break my compulsion to do hour long two hour long
[03:13.000 --> 03:22.000]  three hour long four hour long rants diatribes I have another goal and that is to actually cover the stacks of news in front of me every day
[03:22.000 --> 03:35.000]  I mean I do a decent job sometimes but most of the time I don't and so it's going to be an exercise in self control
[03:35.000 --> 03:44.000]  I am going to give 20 second answers no matter how complex or how important your question or comment is and I'm going to give each caller one minute
[03:44.000 --> 03:52.000]  the problem is the first caller will call in with some huge breaking eye witness news that will turn out to be absolutely accurate and massively important but
[03:52.000 --> 04:02.000]  we'll still do that some days a week where we do nothing but guest or a couple guest and then take up just a few calls and we'll still do some shows where I do nothing but take calls and then rant
[04:02.000 --> 04:13.000]  but I do want to cover the news today and take your phone calls and so I'm going to do that so that probably means I'll just read the headlines and give a brief comment on a story
[04:13.000 --> 04:24.000]  and then take calls because there's no way to get everybody on air and then cover all the news if I don't do that so 1-800-259-9231 whatever the issue you want to bring up
[04:24.000 --> 04:31.000]  whatever news story a question a comment you disagree with me you agree with me

[06:15.000 --> 06:21.000]  the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[06:21.000 --> 06:26.000]  while Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this election
[06:26.000 --> 06:37.000]  I have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism

[07:07.000 --> 07:15.000]  he was devastated but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day
[07:15.000 --> 07:23.000]  there is no job security you are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business
[07:23.000 --> 07:36.000]  since you are the boss nobody can fire you so mz has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others
[07:36.000 --> 07:47.000]  mz wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of helpful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income

[08:35.000 --> 08:52.000]  are the birther movement financed by the right wing lacudnik movement to put pressure on Obama from Israel that is what he is saying and I've learned to really respect Madsen and seen a lot of what he covers ends up to be true
[08:52.000 --> 09:12.000]  so I believe that he believes he's been given this information and he is up reporting on Capitol Hill talking to a lot of high-powered sources so we'll explore that coming up in the last hour today we have a surprise guest coming up in
[09:12.000 --> 09:31.000]  two and a half hours and I'm going to try to be as calm as I can today to cover as much news as possible to take as many as your phone calls as possible as soon as you hear me disconnect a caller it is your chance to call in
[09:31.000 --> 09:51.000]  1-800-259-9231 now I'm going to try to just read the headlines without giving any background information then I'm going to go to your calls then starting next hour I will start going through the top stories and fleshing them out
[09:51.000 --> 10:18.000]  new jobless claims rise unexpectedly to 558,000 in the last month retail sales unexpectedly dip New Jersey teacher to pay $22,000 fine for four-minute conversation during class
[10:18.000 --> 10:36.000]  Obama posters on government property allowed anti Obama posters called vandalism Obama has called publicly for his people to put the picture of him saying change and hope on stop signs but if you put them on your own property people demand they be taken down
[10:36.000 --> 10:51.000]  if it's anti Obama that's the new freedom exercising First Amendment now vandalism is corporate media attacks Obama poster contest and the people are calling for a hate crimes investigation Florida police say it is not a hate crime and that's the first
[10:51.000 --> 11:09.000]  amendment as long as it's hung up in a commons area but if they pass the hate crimes bill completely it's passed the House and Senate it's now in conference and they pass the cyber bullying it says if someone says their feelings are hurt you are arrested
[11:09.000 --> 11:27.000]  here's the big one we've had this congressman on before Paul Brown we're trying to line him up right now Congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law and this article from present planet dot com from his quotes at a town hall meeting
[11:27.000 --> 11:47.000]  interviews with newspapers is basically identical to my analysis and the word is they may use this in the fall or in the winter as a martial law cover story if we get the word out we may be able to stop them doing this but this is really going on this is really happening
[11:47.000 --> 12:02.000]  that's coming up planned for guard troops on border stalls over money so we can have troops in 140 plus countries but we can't have them on the border that's AP
[12:02.000 --> 12:28.000]  state takes extra steps to battle flu and fall deputizing dentist paramedics pharmacist to force vaccines on the public this out of Boston globe battle erupts over plan for HIV vaccine test county health officials turned down proposal last week

[12:37.000 --> 12:50.000]  I'm not bashing Chicago and there's a lot of great people I have family lives up there they're wonderful hardworking people they just have had the mafia running them for 100 years and the last place I mean they finally try it
[12:50.000 --> 12:58.000]  and even our enslaved people say no thank god they're getting their soul back they're fighting spirit back
[12:58.000 --> 13:17.000]  we're gonna go over more of Obama's health plan that's just some of the news I have okay and that dovetails with cancer viruses from dead babies in the vaccine yes it's true I'm gonna go over mainstream news
[13:17.000 --> 13:28.000]  ladies and gentlemen cancer 100 years ago was very rare almost unknown by the 50s one and 33 died of it it's now one and two it was one and three now it's one and two
[13:28.000 --> 13:37.000]  ladies and gentlemen this is eugenics it's all I'm gonna say we're not gonna go to your phone calls there's some of the news coming up
[13:37.000 --> 13:55.000]  Tessa in Texas first caller welcome how you doing Alex good welcome thank you so much for having me on I don't know if you've heard anything on the news about the video that's been circulating on YouTube about Sheila Jackson Lee on her
[13:55.000 --> 14:07.000]  cell phone at a town hall meeting but I'm the one that shot that video and well much yeah I'm no it's pretty much con viral it was on a grant of ancestor in last night it was on Sean Hannity last night
[14:07.000 --> 14:22.000]  and it was on Fox inference today and basically what happened is my friend Eddie and I went to her town hall meeting and we started I started to film the footage I do independent journalism down here in Houston
[14:22.000 --> 14:37.000]  and I happened to catch her on her cell phone while my friend Tracy Miller who's one of the tea party rent winners down here was asking a question she's a cancer survivor and was just saying hey you know I have the option to choose my
[14:37.000 --> 14:51.000]  health care provider and I beat this because I had that choice you know how does the Obama health care plan plan to help people like me in the future and right when she did that she was actually answered a cell phone call
[14:51.000 --> 15:04.000]  literally was talking on her cell phone while Tracy Miller sitting there telling her story about how she survived cancer and was able to choose her health care provider and was completely denied was completely ignored it was horrible
[15:04.000 --> 15:24.000]  I would like to have you and the cancer survivor on as a 1520 minute guest coming up sometime maybe tomorrow or on Sunday that's very very interesting and has the I have seen that that made national news
[15:24.000 --> 15:41.000]  just a quick question and that is is the media getting the full story that it was a cancer survivor that she was ignoring and that it was during a question or are they just getting the fact that she was taking a phone call during questions
[15:41.000 --> 15:55.000]  they they did actually have Tracy on bread of ancestor and she was on Fox and friends this morning and they are covering that she is a cancer survivor and also that she was actually took the call while she was telling her story
[15:55.000 --> 16:18.000]  and I mean I'm the one that shot the footage it was I was right there I couldn't even believe it and I mean you can go to the dredge report now actually the footage it's on the dredge report was put up by someone called Christie Christie's clips 82 that's not me I'm Trinity Texas 77 that's my fight I'm the one that shot the footage and I've got the full nine minutes I've got part one and part two

[16:35.000 --> 16:53.000]  I just want to briefly point out that with the Lloyd dogged footage and the congressman castle footage and this all started with the birther issue and with just case after case it is our listeners that are out there taking action and I'm just so proud of that
[16:53.000 --> 17:11.000]  just like Ron Paul said during the campaign half his support was coming from this radio show that's why we're being attacked by so much go and tell pro lying about us and trying to discredit us just like they did with operation chaos with the FBI back in the 60s and 70s with other activist groups
[17:11.000 --> 17:30.000]  and then a lot of people join in on the bashing of me also just because they're eating up with jealousy because we're successfully reaching so many people and they want to keep the patriot movement of small little club that's why they radicalize themselves and get into so much stuff so they can say that they're the holy ones that are exposing all the great truths
[17:30.000 --> 17:46.000]  we are in an emergency situation our society is imploding and falling apart we've all got to focus on not infighting and taking action and not letting the establishment radicalize us into violence and not letting the establishment get us into racism and not letting
[17:46.000 --> 18:01.000]  that goes for black groups as well it's all meant to get us fighting with each other we've got to come together against the new world order and see how great that call was with Tessa I broke my real cap around for about three minutes but I really want to take a lot of your calls today Francis in

[25:23.000 --> 25:31.000]  meanwhile it's the government stage in most the terror attacks the thing is it's a kleptocracy it's full in full you know blast here
[25:31.000 --> 25:40.000]  because originally it was budgeted to be five hundred million dollar Olympics now it's ballooned to over ten billion and the only excuse they made early on
[25:40.000 --> 25:48.000]  when it hit five billion was oh the price of construction materials has gone up because of the Chinese boom but
[25:48.000 --> 25:57.000]  now every thing has gone up twenty twenty two thousand percent they're lying and the corporate media here is not even investigating or reporting
[25:57.000 --> 26:05.000]  every exception you say oh yeah it's a ten billion plus olympics that's okay it's gonna be a great two week party and they're gonna bankrupt
[26:05.000 --> 26:13.000]  DC and that's where they're gonna have to sell off water rights and hydroelectric rights exactly he's gonna get looted by these kleptocrats
[26:13.000 --> 26:20.000]  I figured there's two three hundred families in this province that are just ripping the place off that's right they make money on the way up
[26:20.000 --> 26:27.000]  and money on the way down and I appreciate your call and that's what's so scary folks we've never seen thieving at this level
[26:27.000 --> 26:38.000]  but they thieve to destroy the system so that it implodes into debt to them you understand they get the money and then you owe them interest on the money you give them
[26:38.000 --> 26:45.000]  I mean just like we're gonna pay interest on the twenty three point seven trillion that we gave to the banks to the banks
[26:45.000 --> 26:54.000]  and they poison our water supply and laugh at us great point amazing points it's all absolutely true I've seen that on the Canadian news and they just don't care
[26:54.000 --> 27:02.000]  they just love it let's talk to Ryan in Kentucky Ryan you're on the air go ahead
[27:02.000 --> 27:10.000]  hey doing Alex good you're up there where the last eight nine years they have the army running security and they beat up any citizens to get out of line
[27:10.000 --> 27:17.000]  and pull forty five side arms out on people regular army that's all part of training the slaves here not just in Canada
[27:17.000 --> 27:24.000]  right I actually have something coming from New York I work for a major cell phone carrier in the area or in the state
[27:24.000 --> 27:31.000]  and I had a lady call in who worked for the New York City Public Health Department and she's an emergency responder
[27:31.000 --> 27:42.000]  that a meeting a couple weeks ago that actually scared her and she was telling me if there's an emergency in my area or if I'm in New York to take my identification papers with me and my family
[27:42.000 --> 27:51.000]  and go to the nearest school or hospital so that validates everything you've said about the vaccinations about using schools for those
[27:51.000 --> 28:06.000]  no they had to serve they've had the fire departments and police all train since the model state self emergency powers act to lock down cities to shoot anyone that leaves and to make everyone go to local schools and sports stadiums to be forcibly injected
[28:06.000 --> 28:17.000]  I mean it's an absolute public fact they're now gearing up to do it now if they don't now they're again they try each time and then we say no and I don't think it's going to work this time
[28:17.000 --> 28:32.000]  but they may release enough of something to actually kill a bunch of people to scare the sheep into running to do it and then you know they'll die 5-10 years later of a different brain degenerative disorders, cancer, viruses I mean it's just hell on earth sir you can't make it up
[28:32.000 --> 28:45.000]  and it seems like it's pretty imminent because she seemed pretty scared enough that because of what she called in for she needed it fixed right away because she could act like she could be called at any moment like it was that imminent of a threat
[28:45.000 --> 28:58.000]  I know they only do that to train them I mean like Jim Jones made his followers do Kool-Aid drills every day and it's meant to make it scary that you know we're all going to kill ourselves with Kool-Aid and they never knew
[28:58.000 --> 29:05.000]  but after they did it hundreds and hundreds of times when they finally drank the Kool-Aid they weren't worried about it you understand how this works
[29:05.000 --> 29:20.000]  Exactly you know I read the news every day I'm on top of things that's why she talked to the one person in the call center that knew exactly what was going on so that's why I thought I'd bring it to your attention and one last thing, August 20th, Rand Paul Moneybaum
[29:20.000 --> 29:27.000]  Okay thank you so much I keep getting emails and things going where's the news about cancer, viruses
[29:27.000 --> 29:46.000]  I mean all you've got to do is go to startpage.com or Google or any of the big search engines and all you've got to do is go to them and put in cancer viruses vaccines and you'll get hundreds of thousands of government documents and mainstream news
[29:46.000 --> 29:50.000]  I mean I've seen probably 10 or 15 this week
[29:50.000 --> 29:58.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[30:20.000 --> 30:31.000]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[30:31.000 --> 30:44.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[30:44.000 --> 31:00.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633
[31:00.000 --> 31:15.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[31:15.000 --> 31:26.000]  For thousands of years their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[31:26.000 --> 31:38.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[31:38.000 --> 31:45.000]  The Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[31:45.000 --> 32:00.000]  Order in game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv. In game, blueprint for global enslavement. You have been warned.
[32:15.000 --> 32:26.000]  The blueprint system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures. Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt. Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[32:26.000 --> 32:34.000]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services. Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[32:34.000 --> 32:48.000]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home. It's called herbal preparations and natural therapies and is flat out the best course of its kind.
[32:48.000 --> 33:16.000]  I recommend you visit this important new website at makeherbalmedicines.com. That's makeherbalmedicines.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[33:16.000 --> 33:18.000]  Monday through Friday, we're here live.
[33:18.000 --> 33:46.000]  Better you should praise the God, the Father, and the Spirit.
[33:46.000 --> 34:06.000]  The globalists need a smokescreen to bring in their tyranny. They're social engineers. They're farmers. They see us as subhuman. Lower than cattle, they grow us like wheat when they come with a sickle.
[34:06.000 --> 34:30.000]  It's even worse than that. They see us as a commodity with negative value. Wheat or corn has a value. They see us not as cheap, but as actually as a cockroach, a pest.
[34:30.000 --> 34:46.000]  And that's who the elite are. That's what they are. They're not the elite.
[34:46.000 --> 35:14.000]  I want all of you to pause.
[35:14.000 --> 35:32.000]  I realize that we are now not at the precipice, not at the end. We have entered the beginning of a long battle for the war inside the New World Order.
[35:32.000 --> 35:46.000]  The global government is already operating. The United Nations is nothing but a special template front for the corporate structure.
[35:46.000 --> 35:58.000]  We are now living in a planetary government, under an illegitimate, criminal, anti-human, parasitic, wicked world government.
[35:58.000 --> 36:16.000]  And the crackdowns on free speech, the crackdowns on families, freedoms, the shutdown of industry to drive you into submission to bankrupt you, to make you dependent on them has begun.
[36:16.000 --> 36:30.000]  And the true battle for liberty and the great task of the human spirit is now beginning. And it's a good thing, because only through adversity is our medal tested.
[36:30.000 --> 36:52.000]  Only by being tested by evil does it force us to come back for reality, and back to the mind, love, and liberty and freedom, and to get on our knees and humble ourselves before the creator of the universe.
[36:52.000 --> 37:00.000]  It is that simple. All right. Let's talk to Mike in Pennsylvania. You're on the air, Mike.
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  Welcome.
[37:04.000 --> 37:15.000]  I have a question about the vaccine story that you read earlier. Do you think that they're doing the training, the first responders and stuff, to put a friendlier face on it?
[37:15.000 --> 37:16.000]  Of course.
[37:16.000 --> 37:30.000]  The first responders to military clamping down and, you know, and you think that they'll, that's just a test to see, because I think the Fox story was in Massachusetts.
[37:30.000 --> 37:38.000]  Well, the whole world is a stage and each of us players upon it, the paraphrase William Shakespeare.
[37:38.000 --> 37:49.000]  The establishment is creating economic implosion, political strife, injecting the word race. If you don't give in to big government, you use the word socialist or racist.
[37:49.000 --> 37:59.000]  So that's to create racism, create division, make it a racial issue. I mean, this is the racist. This is the racism. This is the tribalism. This is the divide and conquer.
[37:59.000 --> 38:11.000]  And then they could start riots. They could, I mean, if the media wanted to hype up a cop tasering or a cop beating any minute, they could tell people it's okay to riot, give those, give those social signals.
[38:11.000 --> 38:22.000]  It would happen. They would then come in and crack down and have the public beg for it as Los Angeles or Detroit or Houston or New York burns.
[38:22.000 --> 38:29.000]  Or they can hype up a few thousand regular flu deaths, which they're already doing in the other hemisphere right now.
[38:29.000 --> 38:41.000]  All the major epidemiologists and virologists and doctors we talked to, except for Nyman, one of them, but the vast majority say it's total hype, total baloney, genetically engineered, deadly.
[38:41.000 --> 38:49.000]  You know that the flu isn't deadly, but the shots are deadly and that it's all a big pharma takeover. I mean, that's mainstream news.
[38:49.000 --> 39:00.000]  And so, yes, they're going to have the local nurse, the local cop backed up by the National Guard and the Army swinging around the heavy fifties.
[39:00.000 --> 39:07.000]  And this is what they've been training for for decades, quietly, and they have North Commonplace. So, yes.
[39:07.000 --> 39:17.000]  All right. Well, answered my question pretty well. Thank you. I appreciate the call, Mike, but it doesn't mean they're going to get away with it this time.
[39:17.000 --> 39:31.000]  They cry wolf on purpose. They put their assets in place. They come in, they scare people, and it multifaceted engages in a PSYOP at a multifaceted level, multi-layered level.
[39:31.000 --> 39:41.000]  It conditions the police and the military and the local constabulary to go under federal and international control under level six, World Health Organization, UN rules.
[39:41.000 --> 39:51.000]  That way, when the real event happens down the road, this may be yet we don't know, then they'll go along with it because they've been drilled to do it.
[39:51.000 --> 40:01.000]  And the public's been drilled. The public's been conditioned. The public's been scared into submission to go along with this.
[40:01.000 --> 40:11.000]  And then at the same time, whenever we get up and resist it and say, no, don't take the shots, you don't have to take the shots. It's grown on dead fetal tissue.
[40:11.000 --> 40:20.000]  It's got cancer viruses in it. And then the pandemic doesn't come, even though they've announced a level six four months ago.
[40:20.000 --> 40:26.000]  Then when it doesn't materialize, we get the blame and the media doubles back and says, we never said there would be an emergency.
[40:26.000 --> 40:32.000]  We never said there'd be martial law. This crazy man, Alex Jones says it. They actually put that in the news.
[40:32.000 --> 40:41.000]  When all I'm doing is reading to you from the newspapers as they're saying it, going, this is how the SIOP works.
[40:41.000 --> 40:49.000]  So see, there's because the public is mesmerized or in a trance, literally the brainwave pattern show that in major studies.
[40:49.000 --> 40:55.000]  We've gone over them. The public from watching so much TV is in a lower state of consciousness. And I don't mean that some new age term.
[40:55.000 --> 41:02.000]  I mean, actual brainwaves. They're asleep. People say their eyes are glazed over. They are. They're in a trance.
[41:02.000 --> 41:11.000]  That's why when you do something out of the ordinary or do something that they're not accustomed to seeing, you'll see him become shocked.
[41:11.000 --> 41:19.000]  I mean, when I dressed up in a Joker outfit last week to promote this contest and got out of my car to a group of three, three police cars with four policemen,
[41:19.000 --> 41:27.000]  they looked stunned and scared and freaked out because they were in a form of mind control under the television and the culture,
[41:27.000 --> 41:35.000]  never expecting to see something like that except on television. But their subconscious mind saw it as real because of watching these different films.
[41:35.000 --> 41:42.000]  Then when they saw me step out of the car out of nowhere, it really freaked them out.
[41:42.000 --> 41:49.000]  And see, for a minute, they were no longer in a trance. That's what I did it for, was to break people out of their trance.
[41:49.000 --> 41:57.000]  I'm learning more and more about how the enemy operates, but I'm using their own systems to try to unlock people, not to believe in what I believe.
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.000]  If you notice, I just show you how they operate and how their tricks work so you can see it for yourself.
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  And then that's prima facia, absolute firsthand evidence for you.
[42:06.000 --> 42:12.000]  When you find out they're lying, when you find out they're trying to hypnotize you, when you find out the flicker right on the TV,
[42:12.000 --> 42:20.000]  in government patents is designed to do it. When you find out the info babe talking in a certain cadence is designed to do this,
[42:20.000 --> 42:26.000]  they are trained to do this. We are all in this together under attack from the globalist.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  Abe in Ohio, welcome.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[42:30.000 --> 42:31.000]  Good, sir.
[42:31.000 --> 42:39.000]  All right, well, I was calling because you talked about the federalization at the local level and our newly elected sheriff in our county here.
[42:39.000 --> 42:47.000]  I wanted to go in and have a talk with him because he's like ex, not high ranking military, but he was definitely like a lieutenant in the military.
[42:47.000 --> 42:54.000]  They're all former military, honestly, almost all former military, former FBI, former DEA, they've quietly taken everything over.
[42:54.000 --> 43:00.000]  Then they get to control the local drug routes, boss who doesn't pay the cut, support those that do pay the cut.
[43:00.000 --> 43:07.000]  They get to shake down the citizens. It is a business. These men are farmers. They are growing us. They are milking us.
[43:07.000 --> 43:08.000]  Go ahead.
[43:08.000 --> 43:17.000]  Well, I wouldn't even talk to him. I'm just like, I don't want to name his name, but I'm just like, so under martial law, like if it does happen,
[43:17.000 --> 43:23.000]  because I mean, President Bush signed an executive order under any national emergency, martial law, and it still stands under Obama,
[43:23.000 --> 43:30.000]  what are you going to do if the president has a blacklist or I guess an execution list or a detainee list? And he just kind of laughed at me like I was kind of crazy.
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.000]  And he's just like, well, if you're asking me of martial law is induced by all means, I'm going along with president's orders.
[43:35.000 --> 43:38.000]  So I just kind of want to report that.
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.000]  See, that's double thing. He's laughing at you even though he knows guaranteed all about this.
[43:43.000 --> 43:48.000]  See, I mean, they'll laugh. The Nazis would laugh as they sat there shooting people in the back of the head.
[43:48.000 --> 43:54.000]  They would laugh at him begging. It's all real funny how they've stolen everything and gang-riped the Republic.
[43:54.000 --> 44:01.000]  He's also got five or six new cruisers. He got a brand new cruiser for himself.
[44:01.000 --> 44:08.000]  Like he hired something like 10 new county sheriffs or county deputies. It's getting pretty nuts.
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  Yeah, Homeland Security funded all that.
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  Yeah, I know. I saw that.
[44:12.000 --> 44:20.000]  But it's a banker, which is bank rape security. This is so the banks can just absolutely got us break our back.
[44:20.000 --> 44:25.000]  They're killing America and these guys line up. They all got American flags on their walls.
[44:25.000 --> 44:34.000]  They enjoy the club. They enjoy the coke and heroin money. Again, they have to make the drugs illegal so they can control the black market and make the profit.
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  It is elementary.
[44:36.000 --> 44:44.000]  And so I tell everybody, the young people, do not use drugs. You want to defeat the New World Order? Don't use any of it.
[44:44.000 --> 44:50.000]  Legal, illegal prescriptions, cigarettes, none of it. None of it.
[44:50.000 --> 44:55.000]  Do not use their product and don't put your kids in their government camps when they push the drugs on them.
[44:55.000 --> 45:03.000]  Don't use any of it. You want to stop them? Don't use any of it. It's not cool. It's how they enslave you. Go ahead.
[45:03.000 --> 45:12.000]  Well, that's also the reason why they are saying for the, like, pick up and cops, the number of cops and new cruisers is because there's been a huge flux of heroin in our area.
[45:12.000 --> 45:22.000]  Of course. I mean, the BBC admits, but then says, but it's, you know, the British and U.S. forces have to guard the poppies and yes, it's up more than 12-fold.
[45:22.000 --> 45:29.000]  Now it was 8-fold. Now it's 12-fold what it was. Record opium being turned into heroin, flooding the world.
[45:29.000 --> 45:36.000]  And, but they have to guard it because they said if they don't guard it, the Taliban will come in and take over and sell it.
[45:36.000 --> 45:45.000]  So the government has to guard it and let the farmers sell it or the Taliban will, because that's how they get the people on their side.
[45:45.000 --> 45:52.000]  Folks, the Taliban is, it works for the New World Order. I appreciate your call. It's just so sick. It's so sick.
[45:52.000 --> 45:59.000]  Young people, I know Hollywood and Pulp Fiction and all these movies, they make drugs cool, then you use it and there's money involved.
[45:59.000 --> 46:09.000]  And it's radical and it's avant-garde and it's, it's, it's, it's taboo and, you know, you're at the party and the older kids invite you in to snort the cocaine.
[46:09.000 --> 46:15.000]  Do not use it. You are crushing the enemy when you don't use their filth.
[46:15.000 --> 46:24.000]  Don't use these fat-bellied cops' drugs. You understand me? Don't use these fat-bellied CIA murdering bastards' drugs. You understand me?
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  Because it isn't enough for these murderers now.
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.000]  Now, all the Dine Corps and the Halliburton's and it's in federal filings.
[46:32.000 --> 46:40.000]  The FBI's now going after XC Blackwater for taking the little girls and they're flying them around in the world.
[46:40.000 --> 46:48.000]  See what you government people have done. You go ahead and you accept shipping the drugs in, which you set up the CIA out of Yale to do.
[46:48.000 --> 46:57.000]  Because it's admitted skull and bones are founded with the opium money in 1834.
[46:57.000 --> 47:07.000]  That's how they run this whole thing. The British East India Company had a monopoly on that. They lost their monopoly in the 20s, so they made it illegal so they could have the monopoly again.
[47:07.000 --> 47:17.000]  That's right. The opium importers had a monopoly in the U.S. and they lost it by the 20s because of transportation and expanded shipping lines.
[47:17.000 --> 47:27.000]  So they just made it illegal so that only they could ship it in and make even more profits. It's elementary, my dear Watson.
[47:27.000 --> 47:38.000]  And skull and bones at Yale was founded off the opium money. That's mainline ABC News. Throwing it in your face. Do not use any of it.
[47:38.000 --> 47:46.000]  Don't use any of their drugs. None of them. Don't take their filthy Prozac. Don't take their filthy Ritalin.
[47:46.000 --> 47:54.000]  Don't take their filthy vaccines. Don't snort their filthy cocaine. Don't inject their filthy heroin. Don't take any of it.
[47:54.000 --> 48:02.000]  And I know George Washington grew marijuana and smoked it for stomach aches and sold it to the local apothecaries. That's the local drug stores.
[48:02.000 --> 48:17.000]  But it doesn't matter. That stuff is clearly abused and overused by people. Zombies walking around and 87% of drug users only use that so they use it to get you in their system.
[48:17.000 --> 48:28.000]  Don't use it either. Break their back. Break their back. Don't use any of their trash. Quit drinking their alcohol. All of it.
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.000]  You want to go to the Hill Country or wherever you live and buy some local wine or something and support local people. That's different.
[48:34.000 --> 48:43.000]  Don't use their big corporate brands. None of it. Never, never, never, never, never, never, never.
[48:43.000 --> 48:50.000]  I'm talking to the 12 and 13-year-olds listening. You're going to end up being the cool person in your school when you say, I'm not going to use that government product.
[48:50.000 --> 49:00.000]  They ship that in. Oh, you filth. Let's go ahead and talk to KJ in Florida.
[49:00.000 --> 49:09.000]  Alex, great show. Thank you very much. I also could add a point to your last point there. A neighbor of mine was on alcohol and drugs.
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.000]  It got so much into his brain, he just killed himself. So there's an example there for the kids.
[49:14.000 --> 49:20.000]  I wanted to bring up some good news to add to what you and Steve Quill were talking about yesterday.
[49:20.000 --> 49:25.000]  If enough people get down and repent, you know, great things can happen.
[49:25.000 --> 49:33.000]  I can give you some examples. You probably know the story about Lepanto, that big naval upset, the Christians over the Turks in 1571.
[49:33.000 --> 49:40.000]  The Pope, actually, at the time, he asked people to say the rosary. They had a rosary crusade going back then.
[49:40.000 --> 49:47.000]  There's actually one going on right now. A certain order in the church is asking people to get down on their knees and say the rosary.
[49:47.000 --> 49:54.000]  Have you seen the picture in Hiroshima where there was one building survived? It was about eight blocks from ground zero.
[49:54.000 --> 50:01.000]  And there was four priests, and they were completely unscathed, no radiation burns, nothing. Have you seen that picture?
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  Is this with the church cross on top?
[50:05.000 --> 50:12.000]  Survived? No. They've been examined by like 250 scientists, and the scientists couldn't come up with an answer, you know.
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  And these guys, the priests said, hey, we just said the rosary every day, we followed the message of Fatima,
[50:16.000 --> 50:21.000]  the blessed mother asked us to do. So that's all I wanted to tell you about today.

[52:07.000 --> 52:14.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[52:14.000 --> 52:21.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[52:21.000 --> 52:25.000]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[52:25.000 --> 52:34.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[52:37.000 --> 52:41.000]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[52:41.000 --> 52:47.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[54:23.000 --> 54:32.000]  We ran through and went to Ben Place, held to the teeth blog, though they point dead can't let you.
[54:35.000 --> 54:40.000]  Congressman Obama, if you've used pandemic to declare martial law.
[54:40.000 --> 54:46.000]  They got two brain cells to rub together and you've studied history and you've studied Northcom
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  and what they've been setting up.
[54:48.000 --> 54:53.760]  We're already under world government control, the UN and private corporations have fully
[54:53.760 --> 54:56.080]  bankrupted the country by design.
[54:56.080 --> 55:00.520]  They're just bankrupting us even more now, putting the paramilitary police around us
[55:00.520 --> 55:03.440]  and they are going to treat us something fierce.
[55:03.440 --> 55:06.320]  They are going to give us some really cruel treatment.
[55:06.320 --> 55:08.160]  And I got news for the local constabulary.
[55:08.160 --> 55:09.880]  We're sick of your drug dealing.
[55:09.880 --> 55:11.480]  We're sick all your corruption.
[55:11.480 --> 55:13.880]  It's over.
[55:13.880 --> 55:15.680]  It's over.
[55:15.680 --> 55:19.760]  And all I hope for is that no matter what happens to me in this, that the scum is brought
[55:19.760 --> 55:22.160]  to justice.
[55:22.160 --> 55:25.200]  I can't believe how far this country is falling.
[55:25.200 --> 55:29.280]  But we got a bunch of sleep at the switch, public, who are sucking their thumbs and not
[55:29.280 --> 55:31.040]  aware of what's going on in the world.
[55:31.040 --> 55:39.400]  All right, I'm going back to Blake, Michael, Nicholas, John, Doug and others.
[55:39.400 --> 55:45.000]  Here in just a moment, I do just want to add to listeners that we do have in the black
[55:45.000 --> 55:50.320]  t-shirts, the white t-shirts with fascist info wars.com and New World Order under the
[55:50.320 --> 55:52.960]  Obama Joker face.
[55:52.960 --> 55:58.720]  They are in, they are shipping out and the establishment says it's evil and bad to lampoon
[55:58.720 --> 56:00.320]  him in any way and then it's wrong.
[56:00.320 --> 56:04.960]  Well, just on the face of that, we're all forced to wear these shirts now just as a
[56:04.960 --> 56:06.520]  protest.
[56:06.520 --> 56:12.000]  And I'm going to be wearing mine when we go live at prisonplanet.tv in one hour and four
[56:12.000 --> 56:13.000]  minutes.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.680]  In the last two hours today.
[56:15.680 --> 56:21.520]  So order your Obama fascist Joker shirts info wars.com shirts.
[56:21.520 --> 56:24.600]  They have in the fed on the back, wake up before it's too late on the back, stop the
[56:24.600 --> 56:29.760]  criminal eight different variants of black and white t-shirts that have the Joker, the
[56:29.760 --> 56:31.000]  iconic Joker image.
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.480]  And I did want to take some time out to, to thank everybody.
[56:34.480 --> 56:41.840]  And for the, I haven't counted, it's probably 60, 70, 80, I don't know, page after page
[56:41.840 --> 56:47.560]  at contest.infowars.com, all the different videos we've been sent and then I found other
[56:47.560 --> 56:49.680]  contest videos that haven't been sent to us yet.
[56:49.680 --> 56:53.160]  So let me know folks who've just heard about the contest, but haven't seen the email.
[56:53.160 --> 56:56.800]  It seems like there's folks out there doing the contest who haven't really read the contest
[56:56.800 --> 57:02.280]  because they're not doing it exactly right or I don't know, I get blamed for, for now
[57:02.280 --> 57:05.400]  the original socialist signs that are all over LA.
[57:05.400 --> 57:06.840]  We did not start this campaign.
[57:06.840 --> 57:09.120]  We never claimed we started this campaign.
[57:09.120 --> 57:17.120]  Good job to whoever did, but there's a lot of, there's people hanging up Obama as Hitler.
[57:17.120 --> 57:20.160]  That's actually Lyndon LaRouge doing that.
[57:20.160 --> 57:21.680]  They put a Hitler mustache on him.
[57:21.680 --> 57:22.680]  That's his first amendment.
[57:22.680 --> 57:23.680]  Right.
[57:23.680 --> 57:27.400]  I think it's pretty accurate in a lot of respects, but I'm getting blamed for that now.
[57:27.400 --> 57:31.480]  Look, let's go ahead and put one out of, in fact, let's go ahead and put him one, let's
[57:31.480 --> 57:34.160]  go ahead and put one out of him as Hitler because if I'm going to get the blame, I might
[57:34.160 --> 57:35.240]  as well.
[57:35.240 --> 57:38.120]  I mean, okay, you say I did it.
[57:38.120 --> 57:43.680]  I mean, let's put a Hitler, let's put a Obama Hitler t-shirt out because I have a right
[57:43.680 --> 57:46.000]  as a US citizen to expose this guy.
[57:46.000 --> 57:51.520]  I exposed George Bush and I did put images of him as Hitler out because he was Hitlerian
[57:51.520 --> 57:53.480]  and I'm going to put an Obama Hitler out.
[57:53.480 --> 57:55.000]  You don't like the Obama Joker.
[57:55.000 --> 57:56.800]  You're going to blame me for the Obama Hitler.
[57:56.800 --> 57:57.800]  That's it.
[57:57.800 --> 57:59.440]  I'm putting Obama, Hitler flyer out.
[57:59.440 --> 58:01.600]  You want something really offensive?
[58:01.600 --> 58:03.880]  You can't handle him as a joker, as a criminal.
[58:03.880 --> 58:05.280]  How about his Hitler?
[58:05.280 --> 58:10.320]  He did expand the funding and re-unfreeze the funding to kill black babies in Africa
[58:10.320 --> 58:14.920]  with forced abortion and in China, that's a fact.
[58:14.920 --> 58:20.080]  He does have a White House science are that says kill the majority of the public does
[58:20.080 --> 58:22.560]  say poison the water.
[58:22.560 --> 58:23.560]  So good.
[58:23.560 --> 58:27.560]  I didn't put the Hitler Obama poster out, but I am now.
[58:27.560 --> 58:30.440]  You think it gets to me, criticizing me and threatening me?
[58:30.440 --> 58:32.520]  That only makes me get up earlier in the morning.
[58:32.520 --> 58:36.800]  That only puts a spring in my step because I'm a fighter and the American people are
[58:36.800 --> 58:42.520]  fighters and we're awake now.

[1:00:14.760 --> 1:00:37.600]  On the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:37.600 --> 1:00:42.640]  Wide open phones, prominent member of Congress says it looks like Obama is going to use the
[1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:46.760]  flu as a pretext for a martial law takeover.
[1:00:46.760 --> 1:00:52.520]  They want to do AIDS virus vaccine tests in the U.S., ladies and gentlemen, African, even
[1:00:52.520 --> 1:00:55.400]  African countries on the payroll have said no.
[1:00:55.400 --> 1:00:56.400]  China has said no.
[1:00:56.400 --> 1:01:00.660]  No one, I've been watching this the last five years or so, will do any of these vaccine
[1:01:00.660 --> 1:01:06.600]  trials that Bill Gates wants with the AIDS vaccine, which is in other little smaller
[1:01:06.600 --> 1:01:10.680]  trials that's caused a lot of death, just like Gardasil.
[1:01:10.680 --> 1:01:15.080]  Guess what, they're trying to force kids and people in Chicago to do it because we are
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:20.360]  seen as the morons of the earth in this country, the cattle that'll put up with anything.
[1:01:20.360 --> 1:01:24.920]  Look, I'm not like a tomato on a vine, but the government to come by and pull me, pull
[1:01:24.920 --> 1:01:26.320]  it off and start eating me.
[1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:27.320]  I'm done.
[1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:30.000]  You understand, I'm done with all your baloney.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.200]  I don't care if government people are drinking your own Kool-Aid and believe that you're
[1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:35.200]  not out of control.
[1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:38.440]  You're out of control, people.
[1:01:38.440 --> 1:01:41.560]  You fools in government that see me as the enemy.
[1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:45.720]  They're putting sodium fluoride in your water, Jack.
[1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:47.720]  They're putting stuff in your vaccines too, Bubba.
[1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:50.400]  All right, I'm going to shut up and take your calls.
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:51.880]  Blake in Texas, you're on the air.
[1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:52.880]  I'm trying not to get mad.
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:53.880]  Go ahead.
[1:01:53.880 --> 1:01:55.880]  Hey, I could be with you.
[1:01:55.880 --> 1:02:00.920]  I'm taking summer school at the University in Beaumont, Texas, last week, Tuesday of
[1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:01.920]  last week.
[1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:06.880]  I was outside waiting for my geology class to start and out walks to Texas National Guard
[1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:12.600]  and pull me and I go inside and I'm kind of curious about it and I ask my teacher, what's
[1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:14.600]  going on with the military here at the school?
[1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:19.400]  You said, oh, they're running the latest GPS tracking drills here at the campus.
[1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:20.400]  They're just running drills.
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:23.360]  Well, I go outside of class after classes over.
[1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:28.440]  The whole entire military that they have there on campus is just marking everything, cars,
[1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:30.480]  light poles, everything in sight.
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:35.320]  Yesterday, I go back to my class and I said, what exactly are they training for?
[1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:40.040]  One of my professors that was actually training the soldiers in a drill said, well, it's for
[1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:41.040]  disaster preparedness.
[1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:44.440]  Yeah, no, they're marking our homes.
[1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:46.560]  They're marking the universities.
[1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:47.800]  It's where they're going to hold people.
[1:02:47.800 --> 1:02:49.520]  People keep asking where the camps are.
[1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:50.880]  It's declassified.
[1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:55.800]  It's sports stadiums and anything with a bar bar fence around it and top off and now they're
[1:02:55.800 --> 1:02:56.800]  called NLE.
[1:02:56.800 --> 1:02:58.640]  Before they were called top off exercises.
[1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:01.480]  Now they're called NLEs, national level exercises.
[1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:07.280]  They admit they're training the lockdown cities, set up machine gun points and forcibly shoot
[1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:08.280]  us up.
[1:03:08.280 --> 1:03:09.280]  Okay.
[1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:12.480]  There's no, this is not me saying this.
[1:03:12.480 --> 1:03:15.760]  They're really, it's really happening.
[1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:22.120]  But again, they use that military tactic of denying, denying, denying when they're openly
[1:03:22.120 --> 1:03:24.120]  training foreign troops.
[1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:26.960]  FEMA has announced they're openly setting all this up.
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:30.280]  They openly are having gun confiscation drills in the newspaper.
[1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:35.040]  And then when we say we don't want it, they suddenly say we're crazy and it doesn't exist.
[1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:40.160]  So I mean, did your professor working with them understand how serious this was?
[1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:41.800]  Apparently not.
[1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:46.040]  She seemed to, you know, just think it was, you know, just, you know, a part of everyday
[1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:47.040]  life.
[1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:50.160]  They're actually, I went to the last year of school today and they were still running
[1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:51.160]  drills up there today.
[1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:58.120]  Why don't you go shoot video and go up and say, so what, where is the training for the
[1:03:58.120 --> 1:03:59.360]  flu pandemic?
[1:03:59.360 --> 1:04:03.640]  That's how you trick them and they'll say, that'll be Colonel Johnson or whatever his
[1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:04.640]  name is.
[1:04:04.640 --> 1:04:06.040]  That'll be captain Thompson.
[1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:10.840]  Yes, we are and say, well, what about the holding area?
[1:04:10.840 --> 1:04:14.720]  Where are you going to have the main, the, I mean, I haven't seen you doing the checkpoint
[1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:15.720]  drill.
[1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:16.720]  He'll go, well, that was Tuesday.
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:17.840]  Did you miss that?
[1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:20.880]  That's how you, you use police tactics to get them to admit they're evil.
[1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:21.880]  You understand?
[1:04:21.880 --> 1:04:22.880]  Yeah, I do.
[1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:27.800]  And another funny thing when, when this happened last week, before I realized what was going
[1:04:27.800 --> 1:04:30.840]  on, all these soldiers were huddling up around their commander, getting ready to do this
[1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:31.840]  drill.
[1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:35.640]  And I was standing right there, just going into class and he was saying, you know, don't
[1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:36.640]  engage the students.
[1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:37.640]  They shouldn't be hostile.
[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:42.160]  I don't think in a way of violence or anything, but, you know, he was, you know, conditioning
[1:04:42.160 --> 1:04:45.440]  them to, you know, think that we were going to be hostile toward them or something.
[1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:46.440]  Of course.
[1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:47.440]  No.
[1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:50.280]  I mean, look, I've been to the drills where they put the American citizen down on their
[1:04:50.280 --> 1:04:53.720]  knees, stick the gun to the back of their head and blow their head off in the drill.
[1:04:53.720 --> 1:04:57.440]  They trained to kill the American people, period.
[1:04:57.440 --> 1:04:58.440]  Okay.
[1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:00.320]  I want to hear more about this.
[1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:01.320]  Hello friends.
[1:05:01.320 --> 1:05:02.320]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:05.640]  And I want each of you to ask yourself this question, do you really know what's in your
[1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:06.640]  tap water?
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:12.080]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:15.120]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:19.240]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental
[1:05:19.240 --> 1:05:20.240]  system diseases.
[1:05:20.240 --> 1:05:22.400]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:27.360]  The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you
[1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:28.920]  and your family's drinking water.
[1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:33.640]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:39.160]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra-violent light sterilization
[1:05:39.160 --> 1:05:40.160]  techniques.
[1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:41.160]  That's right.
[1:05:41.160 --> 1:05:43.440]  Clean water right from the air you breathe.
[1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:48.040]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[1:05:48.040 --> 1:05:54.040]  Or visit Acola Blue on the web at www.ecoloblu.com today.
[1:05:54.040 --> 1:05:55.040]  That's AcolaBlue.com.
[1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:56.040]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:05:56.040 --> 1:05:57.040]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[1:05:57.040 --> 1:05:58.040]  Well, you should.
[1:05:58.040 --> 1:06:09.120]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[1:06:09.120 --> 1:06:10.120]  That's right.

[1:06:14.920 --> 1:06:19.880]  Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[1:06:19.880 --> 1:06:24.680]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD
[1:06:24.680 --> 1:06:27.080]  pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[1:06:27.080 --> 1:06:31.160]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels
[1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:34.240]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[1:06:34.240 --> 1:06:38.640]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor
[1:06:38.640 --> 1:06:39.720]  attitudes.

[1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:03.880]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:07:03.880 --> 1:07:08.240]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:07:08.240 --> 1:07:09.240]  do you want?
[1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:11.240]  My answer would be all I can get.
[1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:16.240]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:17.480]  How much do you want?
[1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:18.480]  When do you want it?
[1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:21.640]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it?
[1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:23.760]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:07:23.760 --> 1:07:25.120]  Will there be any food?
[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:26.560]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:30.680]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:07:30.680 --> 1:07:31.880]  and be immunized?
[1:07:31.880 --> 1:07:35.640]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:07:35.640 --> 1:07:39.240]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:07:39.240 --> 1:07:40.480]  How much will you need?
[1:07:40.480 --> 1:07:41.480]  We don't know.
[1:07:41.480 --> 1:07:42.480]  How much do you want?
[1:07:42.480 --> 1:07:43.480]  All you can get.
[1:07:43.480 --> 1:07:44.480]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:47.560]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[1:07:47.560 --> 1:07:55.200]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:07:55.200 --> 1:08:00.760]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:06.680]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[1:08:06.680 --> 1:08:11.680]  a war on for your mind.
[1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:18.200]  Coming up, Congressman says Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law.
[1:08:18.200 --> 1:08:20.600]  That's exactly what we've been breaking down.
[1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:28.240]  And he said the final piece of the puzzle would be if they announced that militias are
[1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:36.120]  about to carry out terror attacks and reintroduced all the 1990s propaganda.
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:39.360]  I've been saying that for months and now they've made the announcement and have had
[1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:45.800]  the Southern Poverty Law Center out there putting out their propaganda attacking me
[1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:48.600]  and others.
[1:08:48.600 --> 1:08:54.520]  So it's now beginning and the only way they can really make the general public the enemy
[1:08:54.520 --> 1:09:00.240]  and have the general public still accept that and make themselves the enemy in the name
[1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:02.680]  of safety is to use a pandemic to do it.
[1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:05.760]  But I think they're going to overlay it with some staged terror.
[1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:11.360]  That's why they've been drilling the National Guard and regular army mainstream news.
[1:09:11.360 --> 1:09:17.800]  The latest article was in Missouri where they practice setting up checkpoints and then quote
[1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:24.000]  the malicious come and attack the checkpoints.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:28.880]  And the checkpoints are for flu.
[1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:30.800]  Now this doesn't mean they're going to do this though.
[1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:33.200]  I don't see them being able to get away with it.
[1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:39.880]  Steve Quayle says this is it and I hope he's wrong.
[1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:41.840]  And maybe we will go under the waves.
[1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:47.120]  Maybe we'll submit like they did to Hitler or the Russians did to Lenin and Stalin or
[1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:51.960]  to Mao and China and that may be it and it will be black uniforms and this hunting us
[1:09:51.960 --> 1:09:57.640]  down one by one and raping our wives and killing our kids and this is what governments do normally.
[1:09:57.640 --> 1:09:58.640]  And then this is the crew.
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:03.640]  I mean they mean business they mean business a hundred and ten percent with their illegal
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:08.240]  alien and their criminals and their felons and their foreign troops they've hired mainstream
[1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:09.960]  news for years.
[1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:15.360]  Giant contingents of foreign troops not foreign military units though they have those it's
[1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:21.400]  just our military's foreigners now.
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:24.840]  Now I want to go back to the caller Blake and we're going to Michael Nicholas John Doug
[1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:31.400]  Tim and others before I do that though I do want to pause and thank some of the sponsors
[1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:32.840]  that are making this show possible.
[1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:37.320]  New silver solution people all over the world are discovering the benefits of supernatural
[1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:38.320]  silver.
[1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:43.520]  This powerful new nanotechnology is a natural antibiotic and a preventative against infectious
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:44.520]  germs and diseases.
[1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:50.160]  Silver is one of the oldest natural antibiotics and is non-toxic.
[1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:53.920]  Visit their new link on infoawards.com and see the study for yourself.
[1:10:53.920 --> 1:11:00.760]  You've heard the medical doctors here say it's a good for bacteria and viruses.
[1:11:00.760 --> 1:11:02.760]  You cannot afford to miss this opportunity.

[1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:08.560]  and friends.

[1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:43.200]  be self-sufficient.
[1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:45.800]  I mean I do have firearms for defense.
[1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:50.600]  I do have silver and gold and I do have storeable foods and a lot of them and I do have little
[1:11:50.600 --> 1:12:01.200]  propane tanks and cook stoves and I've even got a couple little chemical toilets in case
[1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:07.320]  I need them you know things like that folks because if they do release some deadly flu
[1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:10.360]  and it is killing a bunch of people it's probably just going to be a regular no big deal flu
[1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:15.560]  but they shut down the U.S. for two deaths imagine what we'll do for 2000 during the
[1:12:15.560 --> 1:12:19.280]  hysteria or whatever is happening I'm going to lock down my house and just stay there
[1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:25.800]  I was having debates with my wife last night about whether I'll just come live at the office
[1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:32.320]  if there is some pandemic so I can work and operate from here and she can stay home and
[1:12:32.320 --> 1:12:37.600]  make sure the kids don't get it and die but again we don't know whether it's going to
[1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:41.440]  be real or whether they're going to launch this we just know these people are terrorist
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:46.040]  financial terrorist medical terrorist we know they're taking over I mean the army admits
[1:12:46.040 --> 1:12:49.640]  they take their own troops and put them in chambers and nerve gas them to death project
[1:12:49.640 --> 1:12:54.960]  shed I mean this is admitted I'm sorry reality so crazy I mean I'm just here telling the
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:13:01.320]  like it is and the truth of it is is just because I'm a wild man I mean most people
[1:13:01.320 --> 1:13:06.640]  I don't understand why coward all of this or lie to themselves I mean I'm just somebody
[1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:13.960]  who has got enough hillbilly left in me that when I see a bunch of criminals taken over
[1:13:13.960 --> 1:13:21.560]  and circling around me and my family I get my hackles up the analogy is I'm like a dog
[1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:26.080]  folks and we all need to be like this a dog if it sees a creepy person walking around
[1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:31.240]  behind the house starts barking and I mean we got creepy sick liars running everything
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:36.720]  that think we're their slaves and I just can we just get some backbone that a dog has can
[1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:44.080]  we have the smarts of a dog anyways I'm gonna shut up the point is eFoodsDirect.com you need

[1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:15.160]  going back finish up Blake I need somebody tell them the university I know this is in
[1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:19.680]  the news going on everywhere but we all get conditioned to these national guard state guard
[1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:25.680]  regular feds Alabama defense forces setting up random checkpoints even searching three
[1:14:25.680 --> 1:14:31.120]  year olds training everybody to be a slave it's all part of acclamation but specifically
[1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:35.480]  you said they were getting people ready for you know the students to cause a problem so
[1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:40.440]  this is what they're drilling them for can somebody go shoot some video and get it up
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:46.600]  on YouTube tell us the school tell us where it's going on Lamar University in Beaumont
[1:14:46.600 --> 1:14:51.440]  Texas ironically that's the same place where at the Texas Academy of Sciences Dr. Pionka
[1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:59.480]  gave his brilliant speech also this is supposedly some of the newest GPS steady art tracking
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:05.760]  devices apparently they can track you know if they mark something even if it moves they
[1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:11.200]  can still track it like said the geologists they're helping these guys do this I guess
[1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:14.640]  some of their technology for marking like fossils and different rock layers and things
[1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:21.520]  like that and she also said in addition to it being you know for disaster preparedness
[1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:27.720]  it was also for rescue efforts so when the disaster happens they can find people easily
[1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:41.320]  to rescue them tell me more that's basically the gist of it this happened last Tuesday
[1:15:41.320 --> 1:15:46.040]  I was standing out smoking a cigarette getting ready for class and out walks the National
[1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:52.120]  Guard in full military gear they had orange bets and then they were just going out and
[1:15:52.120 --> 1:15:55.760]  marking everything in sight with these GPS tracking devices they were working in groups
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:15:59.880]  of two they would go out for about an hour or two and then come back into the classrooms
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:04.880]  and analyze what they had like I said the only really the reason I really know that is because
[1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:11.560]  one of my teachers was running the drill and you know that that's what's going on you know
[1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:16.720]  she says for disaster preparedness this fall and it's her rescue efforts and I overheard
[1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:20.800]  the military commander saying the students shouldn't be hostile don't engage him and
[1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:23.720]  it was just really weird you know it's going to class to learn about dinosaur bones or
[1:16:23.720 --> 1:16:31.000]  something and this happened so I thought I'd give you a call well somebody needs to take
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:35.520]  a video camera out there and shoot some video of this they now sell a lot of videos that
[1:16:35.520 --> 1:16:39.600]  are designed to upload to the web that are high quality and cost like a hundred and fifty
[1:16:39.600 --> 1:16:46.800]  bucks and or even it's low quality for forty five fifty bucks get one get it out and this
[1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:52.400]  is going on all over the country just like they have the National Guard out in the regular
[1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:57.360]  army and Marines running checkpoints for drunk drivers and then people say why is the army
[1:16:57.360 --> 1:17:01.960]  here why are the Marines here and they go you're not for drugs are you they kill children
[1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:09.040]  this is word for word state police in California and see oh it's for disaster and see they'll
[1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:12.600]  they'll even have the troops out fighting forest fires and things like that reasonable
[1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:18.520]  stuff but it sets the press in it I appreciate your call Blake well let's talk to Michael
[1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:23.120]  and Illinois you know what I bet it's even in the local paper you can check Lamar University

[1:17:49.880 --> 1:17:56.000]  in America and I was really worried about this because they have video on it is used
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:01.760]  again YouTube it was taken off and they actually showed a person saying this is what's going
[1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:09.760]  to happen and they were also uh... station up at concentration camps in America lately
[1:18:09.760 --> 1:18:14.680]  I have a lot of family lives in the world that's my video that's that's probably my video

[1:18:21.800 --> 1:18:27.040]  and it's it's everywhere people put it up as fast as they pull it down
[1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:32.000]  I have a lot of family in New York and so I went to visit New York and I accidentally
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:37.520]  I came upon a concentration camp and I've never seen one before and I saw one on a highway
[1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:43.120]  it was sort of like deserted but the fences were huge and it was just incredible of what

[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:36.080]  back before else before Vietnam War came along my friends the greatest fortunes
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:41.080]  are made by taking over governments that's why John E. Rockefeller the first
[1:24:41.080 --> 1:24:45.960]  said competition is a sin these are monopoly men they want control of
[1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:56.400]  societies period they want you under their control they want you on drugs in
[1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:03.880]  prison with a psychiatric designation in debt they want you dependent and so
[1:25:03.880 --> 1:25:08.440]  Madison Avenue makes you feel inadequate they tell you to go into debt they
[1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:15.280]  tell you drugs are cool they sell you death wake up awaken all right
[1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:19.160]  Nicholas go in in one minute okay so they force you to take psychotropic drugs
[1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:25.120]  right right basically I ended up having to trick my captors to become free of
[1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:29.560]  the psychotropic drugging after eight months of being forced drug what did you
[1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:34.240]  act like you were submitting and you liked it well the thing is they had me
[1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:39.920]  on a forced howl doll injections and so that was every month being forced to be
[1:25:39.920 --> 1:25:44.200]  injected with an unknown substance really I could have been anything as far as I
[1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:50.760]  know and so what I ended up doing was saying you know I'd like to have my
[1:25:50.760 --> 1:25:56.760]  physician do that because he lives closer and so I basically forbade them to
[1:25:56.760 --> 1:26:02.320]  share information back and forth and in essence got free from the drugging and
[1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:08.200]  have lived a very simple and fulfilling life you defeat them when you do that God
[1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:12.120]  bless you Nicholas you defeat them when you live well the French say the best
[1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:15.720]  revenge is living well I agree with them but I'll change that and say you
[1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:20.240]  defeat the scum control freak parasites that's why you've got to be straight and
[1:26:20.240 --> 1:26:23.800]  strong and focused and I'm not saying I'm perfect I'm just saying we all got to
[1:26:23.800 --> 1:26:28.400]  try to really be straight and strong and and and and just keep our nose clean
[1:26:28.400 --> 1:26:32.400]  and and reach out and expose these people and reach out to good people and
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:36.360]  warn them because we can beat these bastards together folks John and Virginia
[1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:40.880]  John you're on the air go ahead Alex good show I wanted to to call when I heard
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:44.800]  the gentleman say that he had just come back from talk to his county shared if
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:49.880]  I found that interesting because frankly that's where I was this morning and I
[1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:55.800]  started going into the internment camp enlistments that I got off the website
[1:26:55.800 --> 1:26:59.780]  there for national guard dot com the army officially says for internment
[1:26:59.780 --> 1:27:05.000]  camps in America reeducation of the American people mainstream news and
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:10.160]  what did he say it didn't exist oh no no no no not at all he looked at it and
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:17.040]  all of a sudden he started handing me stuff oh that he is his nephew who was
[1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:24.360]  in the military has been sending him about gun confiscation so oh boy so all
[1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:28.000]  of the sudden it's well let me stop you let me stop you I want to shut up and I
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:31.360]  want to give you time to break down the whole story but see all the sheriffs and
[1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:35.680]  police chiefs aren't criminals I'd say about half of them are so the criminals
[1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:38.840]  are trying to have a full takeover right now so they can get away with what
[1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:42.720]  they're doing and expand it so the good news is just like I got the DHS report
[1:27:42.720 --> 1:27:47.800]  from a state police officer just like I get the homeland security report from a
[1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:51.600]  federal marshal or FBI people I'm not going to go into any more than that or
[1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:55.880]  from the army I get secret documents that then expose and make national news
[1:27:55.880 --> 1:28:00.440]  they're following and in the Fedders you're telling me you went in and the
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:04.320]  sheriff was already concerned okay can you say where it is or are you not
[1:28:04.320 --> 1:28:09.920]  supposed to let me just say in southwest Virginia South West Virginia I'm gonna
[1:28:09.920 --> 1:28:14.640]  shut up start over tell us what happened well just went in and had my
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:21.680]  article actually the printout from the National Guard website the guy was very
[1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:24.760]  gracious didn't have an appointment or anything said come on back what's on your
[1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:29.560]  mind and I hand it this to him and I said have you seen this before and he
[1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:34.880]  looked at it and he said no to be honest with you I haven't he said I've heard
[1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:40.240]  about it but I didn't didn't know that these things existed or certainly this
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:46.000]  is new information and he said well he said let me hand you something so he
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:54.400]  hands me an article from his nephew who was active duty army and it involves
[1:28:54.400 --> 1:29:00.000]  these folks having to register all of their privately owned farms with the
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:03.200]  federal government oh yeah that's confirmed and every time the feds get
[1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:07.760]  caught they go oh that was just a local general over Fort Bragg he was wrong but
[1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:12.040]  then it did come out no this is happening they're making the VFW
[1:29:12.040 --> 1:29:16.240]  halls even basically register and turn in their old cannons it's really
[1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:21.840]  happening well his apparently his nephew is very up to speed on what's going on
[1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:27.920]  and he is active duty and is feeding him a lot of information and he just said to
[1:29:27.920 --> 1:29:33.960]  me I am a total complete believer in the Second Amendment I think everybody
[1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:39.360]  unless you're a felon should be able to own firearms and I asked him well let me
[1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:42.120]  ask you something stay there I want to hear you ask him what he was gonna do
[1:29:42.120 --> 1:29:46.240]  that if it happens if we can get the police and military to just follow the

[1:34:03.840 --> 1:34:09.040]  with all this happening there's no more time to live in denial folks we have
[1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:14.680]  psychological warfare experts that probe and test and are trying to see if they
[1:34:14.680 --> 1:34:18.200]  can sell us on this and I just want to tell the military and police and
[1:34:18.200 --> 1:34:23.480]  everybody else this is not a game I know I say that a lot this is not a game or a
[1:34:23.480 --> 1:34:28.680]  stick or a joke on this show a lot of you've heard me 10 12 13 plus years and
[1:34:28.680 --> 1:34:32.320]  and your believers now because you've gone and checked out what I've claimed
[1:34:32.320 --> 1:34:35.840]  you didn't at first you laughed at me 10 years ago but saw so much of it come
[1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:39.880]  true you've now gone and looked at what I've said and you found out it's worse
[1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:45.920]  than I'm telling you because I can't explain to you how diabolical it is one
[1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:50.840]  story along these lines is so diabolical I can't believe it even though it's
[1:34:50.840 --> 1:34:54.680]  admitted in court documents and they were convicted in France but they got
[1:34:54.680 --> 1:34:58.400]  away with it everywhere else it just had civil penalties bear pharmaceutical this
[1:34:58.400 --> 1:35:02.920]  is one of thousands but I mentioned it because it's well known knowingly on
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:13.480]  purpose put HIV and hepatitis in shots for children in their factor 8 vaccine
[1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:18.920]  factory drug and it came because and the media said why'd they do that they
[1:35:18.920 --> 1:35:21.920]  didn't care you know because it turned out they knew about it for 10 years and
[1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:26.960]  kept doing it no folks they think they're doing good work when your kid gets
[1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:32.000]  put in a little four-foot coffin and gets lowered down on the ground they've
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:35.960]  done a good day's work they go home and give each other high fives you understand
[1:35:35.960 --> 1:35:40.920]  that now I don't know how to explain this to you any other way but people say
[1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:44.040]  I'm a little wild I go a little crazy what do you think it's like dealing with
[1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:48.160]  this every day no one it's true controlling myself putting up with the
[1:35:48.160 --> 1:35:51.960]  government's crap because I know most the people in government are just on
[1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:58.800]  power trips are ignorant look it's real okay it's real you're under attack too
[1:35:58.800 --> 1:36:05.920]  can't you get that through your head alright I'm gonna shut up I want to go
[1:36:05.920 --> 1:36:09.720]  to a bunch of calls and I got tons of news I've even gotten to yet John and
[1:36:09.720 --> 1:36:13.720]  Virginia see so you're there in southern Virginia you're talking to your sheriff
[1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:17.000]  he says yeah I know about the gun confiscation I know about the military
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:20.080]  you give them the FEMA camp document where they're hiring the troops for the
[1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:24.480]  reeducation centers and the relocation and they admit in mainstream news they're
[1:36:24.480 --> 1:36:27.960]  getting ready to lock down cities and do you know whether it's a drill or not
[1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:32.040]  they're telling them it's gonna happen that's like if somebody cocks a gun and
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:36.320]  you know or loads the chamber and puts a gun to your head and says I'm gonna blow
[1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:39.000]  your head off I don't know if they're really gonna do it point is they're
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:43.840]  doing it I'm tired of this mind game people play saying I'm saying this is
[1:36:43.840 --> 1:36:50.240]  gonna happen no they're saying this on ABC news on CNN on Fox and then they're
[1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:55.120]  actually putting the assets in place this is not a tabletop exercise this
[1:36:55.120 --> 1:36:59.240]  this is really going on so I don't know I don't know why they're going around with
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:02.840]  federal grants making police stations all harden themselves for terror attack
[1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:07.160]  and even in small towns and saying the citizens are about to attack you what is
[1:37:07.160 --> 1:37:11.240]  it they're planning so horrible that we're gonna have to go out and go up
[1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:18.320]  against the government I'm asking you that question look again I try to be calm
[1:37:18.320 --> 1:37:23.000]  about all this folks I don't know how John just finished your story go ahead
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:28.040]  well I was encouraged frankly I mean here's a guy that's active duty military
[1:37:28.040 --> 1:37:33.080]  that is informant his uncle what's obviously going on that few of us know
[1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:38.440]  about and his uncle is very receptive to it and actually very receptive to the
[1:37:38.440 --> 1:37:43.880]  information I gave him and I just flat out asked the question if it gets to
[1:37:43.880 --> 1:37:49.520]  this point where we have federal troops in here that are going to be requiring
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:56.240]  us to go to FEMA camps or take mandatory vaccinations what's going to be
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:38:03.320]  your position on this and he said I won't allow that so I was real encouraged
[1:38:03.320 --> 1:38:07.480]  I'm not saying there aren't some real bad folks out there because there are but
[1:38:07.480 --> 1:38:11.000]  I think there's some real good folks out there that just aren't informed and we
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:14.800]  can't back up now now is when people are asking questions we got to move
[1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:18.880]  forward I did go to my pastor I think that's another avenue that we can go
[1:38:18.880 --> 1:38:24.320]  to because pastors are just a linchpin in this for so many people and and
[1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:27.360]  wish I could report to you that the pastor was as receptive to this
[1:38:27.360 --> 1:38:31.760]  information as the sheriff was the pastors apparently don't want to get
[1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:36.440]  real political so they want to want to want to stay on well you know about
[1:38:36.440 --> 1:38:41.120]  the clergy you know about the clergy response teams and that even if they
[1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:45.400]  are under FEMA payment themselves their denomination is every major
[1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:49.680]  denomination both Catholic and Protestant and all the other groups are
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:53.960]  all the major denominations because if you don't think the government comes
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:58.880]  after them with their 501c3 have signed on to the clergy response teams in
[1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:04.120]  regard you're aware of that right yeah yeah I am and and I've been looking at
[1:39:04.120 --> 1:39:08.400]  this thing now I'm I'm over the half century mark I've been looking at this
[1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:13.600]  for a good 15 years and I know you've been looking at it for a good number of
[1:39:13.600 --> 1:39:18.760]  years and and frankly I'm encouraged I'm seeing an awakening right now that even
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:23.320]  even two years ago if you'd started telling people this stuff they would have
[1:39:23.320 --> 1:39:28.040]  had thought you were nuts now they're not saying that actually I'm I'm I'm
[1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:31.880]  seeing people say get me information show me what you know you know give me
[1:39:31.880 --> 1:39:37.520]  I agree no I agree John God bless you one more point go ahead we got a big tea
[1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:40.520]  party and I don't know if you've mentioned this or not but on September
[1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:45.840]  the 12th there is a nationwide tea party on the mall in Washington DC they're
[1:39:45.840 --> 1:39:51.320]  hoping to get a million Americans up there to show these people that we are
[1:39:51.320 --> 1:39:55.800]  united we understand what's going on and we're tired of it so if all of your
[1:39:55.800 --> 1:40:00.400]  listeners could just just get in touch with the local tea parties and their
[1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:04.920]  group they're all gonna have I hear you I hear I gotta get the other callers see
[1:40:04.920 --> 1:40:07.520]  the issue is the callers are all so great and then if I don't cut a collar
[1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:10.840]  off I'll never get to the next caller but becomes a cash 22 but just on the
[1:40:10.840 --> 1:40:15.640]  tea party issue I know Lou Dobbs is good I've talked to him off air I know people
[1:40:15.640 --> 1:40:20.320]  that work with him he has a contract before he got all political five years
[1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:24.400]  ago and it's running out I believe next year where he can do whatever he wants
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:29.680]  and they don't want to pay out his contract because it's big and he knows
[1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:35.800]  all about the New World Order he's from Texas he's a good guy Lou Dobbs is for
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:41.120]  real now back I've seen him stab us in the back over and over again but then he
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:46.760]  takes he'll tell the truth and then stab us in the back tell the truth stab us
[1:40:46.760 --> 1:40:51.640]  in the back and to me that's even worse than just being pure evil all the time
[1:40:51.640 --> 1:40:57.920]  I just I can't stand somebody who's lukewarm when I was a kid in Sunday
[1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:00.400]  school I didn't know understand what that meant now that I know a little bit more
[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:03.760]  about the world and a little bit of wisdom now I understand how bad lukewarm
[1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:08.840]  people are they're just it's the scum of the earth but I will tell you that they
[1:41:08.840 --> 1:41:14.560]  are legitimately boycotting him and MSNBC is calling out his sponsors and
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:21.480]  they're trying to kick him off the air because there is probably a fisher in
[1:41:21.480 --> 1:41:25.720]  the New World Order well I know there is and there is a fight going on a power
[1:41:25.720 --> 1:41:34.680]  struggle and for some reason they don't like Beck this is not just a ruse or a
[1:41:34.680 --> 1:41:38.680]  fake attack to make people come to his aid this is an attack to shut down free
[1:41:38.680 --> 1:41:42.880]  speech everywhere and so we have to defend his right to the First Amendment
[1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:46.360]  just like Michael Savage I don't agree with him on some things or I agree with
[1:41:46.360 --> 1:41:51.720]  him on a lot but I've come to his aid whenever you know he is under attack
[1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:58.640]  because just like I came to Democrats aid who I don't agree with because you
[1:41:58.640 --> 1:42:03.000]  know I don't agree with people that put crucifix in urine but folks the media
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:08.480]  uses those images to set the precedent to take all our speech that's the thing
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:15.320]  about speech and if somebody is lying about you or doing something really bad
[1:42:15.320 --> 1:42:21.560]  you're forced to litigate against them but you can't have the government now
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:29.840]  I'm still busy making films and things too that you have to stand up for
[1:42:29.840 --> 1:42:34.080]  yourself but and I try to take the high-robot things that are set about me
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:43.920]  that aren't true but it's just crazy how they try to attack the First
[1:42:43.920 --> 1:42:48.960]  Amendment okay I want to go to Doug Tim Dana Richard Thomas and others here in
[1:42:48.960 --> 1:42:54.760]  just a moment coming up congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare
[1:42:54.760 --> 1:43:00.200]  martial law HIV vaccines they now want to push on school kids here in the US
[1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:05.080]  it's just there's nothing they won't do to us folks no one will accept even
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:10.160]  trials anywhere in the world but we are known as such idiots by the globalist
[1:43:10.160 --> 1:43:20.080]  that I mean well we're gonna cover it coming up but I did want to get Ted
[1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:25.080]  Anderson on for five minutes right now because you've heard him do gold and
[1:43:25.080 --> 1:43:29.000]  silver offers in the past here he's the owner of Genesis Communications he's
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:32.640]  where I buy my gold and silver because I frankly I can't find a better deal I've
[1:43:32.640 --> 1:43:38.720]  shopped around I bought a little silver here in there you know at street level
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:43.440]  that I hadn't gotten from Ted but Ted buys when it's low and then sells it at
[1:43:43.440 --> 1:43:46.920]  the low price when it's high that's his big secret and why he's become so
[1:43:46.920 --> 1:43:57.600]  successful in the last 30 years and last 12 years setting up Genesis so and all
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:00.840]  the other times I'll get up on air and I'll say this is the last time he's
[1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:04.560]  offering this and then it is the last time you know that's super special deal
[1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:09.440]  and they've done that five six seven times in the past the last three weeks I
[1:44:09.440 --> 1:44:12.920]  just keep saying well this should be the last this should be the last because
[1:44:12.920 --> 1:44:19.840]  Ted got so much that he put in the vault they've got off-site that he was
[1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:23.000]  able to keep offering and offering and offering and offering of it now the
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  market's gone crazy it's up $10 a day $5 yesterday it's up over $65 almost
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:33.480]  $70 from when he bought gold that he still so so he bought gold when it was
[1:44:33.480 --> 1:44:40.880]  almost $70 lower I don't 905 to 9010 9-11 range he bought them in different
[1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:45.920]  buys some at 9 3 9 5 9 7 9 10 9 11 I've seen the purchase orders he sent them to
[1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:54.920]  me and then golds up at 970 something and he's selling it to you at with it
[1:44:54.920 --> 1:45:02.000]  factored in the market at the 905 9010 9-11 number silver is is is way
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:05.800]  way up several dollars he's still selling it at the level when it was a few
[1:45:05.800 --> 1:45:09.920]  bucks cheaper per ounce though Lakota's did just go up so one of the things we
[1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:13.560]  said it was about to go up it did I see the purchase orders tell you what you
[1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:18.080]  want to do is what stores do you want to show people your actual invoice because
[1:45:18.080 --> 1:45:20.640]  I get these are you giving permission I'll dig it out of the email and show
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:25.800]  people on one of these gold Franks he's making four dollars on it on a silver
[1:45:25.800 --> 1:45:33.320]  coin making 50 60 cents on it this is a lost leader for Ted and so he's selling
[1:45:33.320 --> 1:45:38.720]  you gold and silver at below what the market is with almost no markup because
[1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:45.560]  he wants your business and so that said what is gold right now Ted well the
[1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:51.000]  the high today on gold is 961 50 when I printed it off we were looking at about
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:57.800]  990 956 it's fluctuating right now you know you're trying to explain why why
[1:45:57.800 --> 1:46:01.600]  would I buy something low and still keep the low price even because I saw a nine
[1:46:01.600 --> 1:46:06.360]  on 960 something so I guess it's going all over the map then yeah 961 50 today of
[1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:11.760]  course it's very strong dollars dropping you know to me it's not it's like a no
[1:46:11.760 --> 1:46:17.400]  brain situation to me I'm watching what's going on Washington DC you know
[1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:21.480]  the fundamentals I can put the pieces together and go okay if gold comes down
[1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:25.680]  in price chances are it'll come back up again and I've been making bets like
[1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:30.120]  this for about the last two years where I get where I'm able to wait till the
[1:46:30.120 --> 1:46:35.120]  market drops and figure that it's not going to drop further it'll start rising
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:42.720]  again we've been in a bull market in gold since well what your 1996 I think it
[1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:49.040]  was the lowest that it was at 256 that's been climbing ever since then and and
[1:46:49.040 --> 1:46:54.680]  so right now I watch the market dip and I just I know it's a time to buy I mean
[1:46:54.680 --> 1:46:59.920]  it could quite literally if I buy it at 910 it could go down to 850 and I could
[1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:05.840]  be sitting on inventory that's too high in price but it's almost like I gotta
[1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:10.360]  tell you Alex haven't lost not even once yet in the last two years if I lost
[1:47:10.360 --> 1:47:14.400]  because I bought I bought on the dip because every time it comes back up
[1:47:14.400 --> 1:47:18.160]  again and the interesting thing is the customer stopped buying when the market
[1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:21.560]  is down because I think that it's all over and then all of a sudden comes
[1:47:21.560 --> 1:47:25.600]  raging back up again like it has now and it gets exciting again people buy it
[1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:30.400]  again it's crazy how that works but what I prefer to do is I prefer to get people
[1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:34.720]  into gold and silver at a lower price it's also to my advantage to be more
[1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:39.720]  competitively priced than my competition I mean you take that Lakota coin I told
[1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:44.320]  everybody that the thing was going to be going over $20 an ounce well I just had
[1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:50.520]  to order my last 5,000 coins and that particular group came in and now they're
[1:47:50.520 --> 1:47:56.520]  at $20 and 86 cents a piece we're offering them at 1996 I'm gonna tell
[1:47:56.520 --> 1:48:01.960]  people now the walking Liberty half that I was offering for 869 when Silver was
[1:48:01.960 --> 1:48:08.120]  at 910 on your show is still currently right now at 869 why is it 8869 why
[1:48:08.120 --> 1:48:12.760]  because I was able to get myself about 50 bags of those 50 bags of walking
[1:48:12.760 --> 1:48:16.920]  Liberty halves and one bag that is $1,000 face value case you don't
[1:48:16.920 --> 1:48:22.560]  understand what that means 1,000 face value means 2,050 cent pieces are
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:27.320]  walking Liberty halves in this case so I'm able to do something at a price that
[1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:32.640]  is relative to where spot was when Silver was down there at about $11
[1:48:32.640 --> 1:48:36.400]  an ounce absolutely people need to take advantage of this right now Ted the
[1:48:36.400 --> 1:48:46.080]  number to call is 1-800-686-2237 here's that number 800-686-2237 no pressure no
[1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:49.880]  nothing call up so you want the Alex Jones special the silver half dollars
[1:48:49.880 --> 1:48:54.160]  the Lakota rounds other silver dollars they've got depending on the deal you
[1:48:54.160 --> 1:48:58.640]  want they've got the really low prices on the European Franks the Swiss and
[1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:03.560]  French the British sovereign the prized coin this is an insanely good deal
[1:49:03.560 --> 1:49:11.040]  800-686-2237 the globalist all-horde gold and silver it's clear they're gonna
[1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:15.600]  run commodities up again it's clear hyperinflation is coming up it is
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:20.760]  insane to stay only in paper anybody who's got the assets I would recommend I
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:25.240]  know myself and mainly I have no stocks no bonds it's all silver and gold and
[1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:28.160]  that's limited because I have spent everything on the business of the
[1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:34.940]  operation but the point is 800-686-2237 yeah Alex I mean I you're you're
[1:49:34.940 --> 1:49:38.920]  talking about the globalist the the global bankers right now as a policy
[1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:42.760]  are publishing the fact that they're no longer selling the gold that they once
[1:49:42.760 --> 1:49:46.520]  were there they're dropping those reserve those those numbers that they're
[1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:50.520]  willing to sell they're getting back into gold right now they're not pushing
[1:49:50.520 --> 1:49:54.640]  themselves away they themselves are protecting themselves from each other's
[1:49:54.640 --> 1:49:58.960]  currencies the United States dollar people know it the United States dollar
[1:49:58.960 --> 1:50:04.360]  is on a is on a fast slide downhill you know there is no reason the world why
[1:50:04.360 --> 1:50:08.680]  the dollar is going to stay strong it was living the legacy of being the world
[1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:12.800]  reserve currency because it was exchangeable for gold up through 1970
[1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:16.240]  they're having these US Treasury auctions in the Chinese and people are
[1:50:16.240 --> 1:50:19.520]  balking for the first time look I don't know what's going to happen but it
[1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:23.600]  doesn't look pretty insurance is gold and silver this is the safest bet out
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:28.760]  there 800-686-2237 and it's not just the gold and silver is the best bet this
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:32.720]  is the best deal in the best bet so the best of the best of the best the cut
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:38.600]  above the cut this is it 800-686-2237 Ted you keep holding this but you told
[1:50:38.600 --> 1:50:41.720]  me you are running out you ran out of Lakota's at that price how long can you

[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:26.440]  you're on the air go ahead Doug go ahead Doug I wanted to talk to you about if
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:30.800]  you knew anything about what's going on in aquasist me up now on that border of

[1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:50.360]  pretending they have some type of jurisdiction none of them do but I guess
[1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:55.440]  on June 1st the Canadian border service and now that the worst guys in there are
[1:56:55.440 --> 1:56:59.520]  all out there at the Cornwall crossing they put their building right on our
[1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:03.840]  island right on our territory so they said they wanted nine millimeter hand
[1:57:03.840 --> 1:57:08.680]  guns there and the only place in Canada what what the border guys would have
[1:57:08.680 --> 1:57:13.480]  these things and so our people said no we don't want any guns enough with us
[1:57:13.480 --> 1:57:19.600]  me and so they just went on strike and just ran away and anyways if you could

[2:00:58.200 --> 2:01:05.440]  ahead I have hi Alex I just wanted to kind of skip through what has gone on
[2:01:05.440 --> 2:01:10.960]  since 2006 and maybe help some new listeners or people to reconfirm and
[2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:16.560]  understand how we got where we are with government legislature if you remember
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:23.480]  back in February of 2006 big Chinese company Halliburton for Kellogg brown
[2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:31.200]  route KBR got 385 million dollar contract to build military detention
[2:01:31.200 --> 2:01:35.480]  retirement centers in this country and they're quoted as saying an emergency
[2:01:35.480 --> 2:01:40.560]  influx of immigrants to support the rapid development of new programs now
[2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:44.360]  put that with this new health program in the uprising that's going on in the
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:48.280]  testament of that then you move from there this kind of jumping ahead a
[2:01:48.280 --> 2:01:54.000]  little bit but you move from there to house belt 645 that was proposed in the
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:02:01.040]  Senate this year or the House representative February the second where it is
[2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:07.400]  asking for detention military camps to come into being for civilians on
[2:02:07.400 --> 2:02:14.520]  military installation and expanding as you said earlier bushes 2007 bill for
[2:02:14.520 --> 2:02:20.760]  broad presidential enforcement which David requesting that that even be
[2:02:20.760 --> 2:02:25.120]  broader for Obama now now they've got bills saying they're going to put
[2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:29.080]  everybody in the camps for their own good now they have the internment camp
[2:02:29.080 --> 2:02:33.280]  programs asking for the National Guard people to join the guard to run the
[2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:39.680]  domestic relocation internment camps even using that word no it's it's but
[2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:45.960]  Glenn Beck is telling his audience it's not happening there's some more the
[2:02:45.960 --> 2:02:51.960]  sermonism that Homeland Security has set out recently it's for right-wing
[2:02:51.960 --> 2:02:57.120]  extremists who pose a danger but it's also the Department of Defense is
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:03:02.000]  describing protesters think about people at these city town hall meetings as
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:08.800]  quote-unquote low-level terrorists now if you go to goarmy.com and just type in
[2:03:08.800 --> 2:03:14.520]  a search there for National Guard jobs it will take you to the description of
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:18.840]  what they're calling and setting out to harness no it's a ma'am ma'am it's an
[2:03:18.840 --> 2:03:24.360]  absolute right it's an absolutely clear congruent stated public fact that the
[2:03:24.360 --> 2:03:28.640]  Homeland Security in North Common the FEMA camps are for gun owners land owners
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:34.440]  conservatives animal ID premise society to shut down the farms and ranches the
[2:03:34.440 --> 2:03:38.560]  open eugenicist bioethics boards Wall Street Journal years ago admitted they
[2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:42.600]  do have death boards they do decide to kill people they do decided to withdraw
[2:03:42.600 --> 2:03:47.880]  food and water from people it it's all real it's all happening we have our own
[2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:52.880]  Stalin taking over but Obama is just their puppet this isn't a system where
[2:03:52.880 --> 2:03:56.920]  you have a real Stalin or a Mao this is a system where they have front men who
[2:03:56.920 --> 2:04:01.800]  carry out the same policies for the offshore banks and yes it is really
[2:04:01.800 --> 2:04:06.240]  happening here and you've laid it all out in a congruent fashion and that's why
[2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:11.360]  I got so mad at Glenn Beck when he said six months ago none of it was real I
[2:04:11.360 --> 2:04:16.840]  have been doing a lot of study on this flu epidemic the flying stuff compared to
[2:04:16.840 --> 2:04:21.560]  1918 when the first time it came around during World War one I lay you money a
[2:04:21.560 --> 2:04:25.320]  million dollars they're going to take Obama out and they're going to use this
[2:04:25.320 --> 2:04:30.200]  line flu to do it because they don't want him in there that got him in there
[2:04:30.200 --> 2:04:34.600]  to finish up what we've started during eight years he's doing all the
[2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:39.840]  disruption and everything he can do to our economy try to blame it on him and

[2:08:56.800 --> 2:09:04.160]  light-minded people you want to get the word out you want to get past the
[2:09:04.160 --> 2:09:07.080]  political correctness because they're on the news saying this is now a hate
[2:09:07.080 --> 2:09:11.000]  crime and if we give into that and say okay it's a hate crime I'm not allowed
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:14.240]  to show him in a bad light then you've given in it's the media and the
[2:09:14.240 --> 2:09:20.480]  government creating racism invoking racism and they're doing it cold
[2:09:20.480 --> 2:09:24.600]  bloodedly as a political tool saying be politically correct don't criticize
[2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:30.880]  Obama on anti-gun bills on open borders on socialized government medical care
[2:09:30.880 --> 2:09:35.840]  takeover really is eugenics don't criticize him on cap and trade taxes
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:42.480]  don't criticize him on abortion nothing or you hate black people and they've
[2:09:42.480 --> 2:09:48.840]  now said on MSNBC and CNN you socialism is now the n-word it's a code I mean who
[2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:53.680]  would ever think of that now they know that's ridiculous it is a chilling
[2:09:53.680 --> 2:09:58.560]  effect so I just want the listeners I want the viewers out there to stand up
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:01.920]  you can print off the free flyers put them up in public commons where other
[2:10:01.920 --> 2:10:05.960]  posters and things are posted and I said this last week and I said this on
[2:10:05.960 --> 2:10:10.480]  Sunday and I said this in the rules of the contest that because I don't want
[2:10:10.480 --> 2:10:14.440]  you to get in trouble you know you're doing it on your own so I I don't have
[2:10:14.440 --> 2:10:17.400]  any liability but I don't want you to get trouble don't stick it on federal
[2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:24.680]  buildings or mailboxes put under windshields put it in the commons area
[2:10:24.680 --> 2:10:28.720]  wherever you see other posters up or polls where everybody else puts posters
[2:10:28.720 --> 2:10:32.720]  up it's selective enforcement and discrimination they come after you but I
[2:10:32.720 --> 2:10:35.840]  now have Florida newscast I mean I couldn't make the whole show today about
[2:10:35.840 --> 2:10:40.240]  myself and I probably should because you know we don't want them to try to
[2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:44.840]  demonize us nationally as they're doing and then later I'll get into that later
[2:10:44.840 --> 2:10:50.120]  in the hour but I want to go to calls right now they are saying that we're
[2:10:50.120 --> 2:10:54.680]  not allowed to post our posters anywhere and that it's a hate crime but we found
[2:10:54.680 --> 2:10:59.800]  Obama in 2008 in the Washington Post and we have a copy of his letter saying put
[2:10:59.800 --> 2:11:06.720]  the Obama posters up on stop signs we never said that but see he can say do
[2:11:06.720 --> 2:11:12.560]  that and he's good but then we can't even say put this up on a light pole and
[2:11:12.560 --> 2:11:17.040]  we've got stories out of Tennessee and stories out of California we have them
[2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:21.960]  up on info wars.com there's so many I can hardly even cover them all where they
[2:11:21.960 --> 2:11:26.200]  got the highway patrol going it's dangerous to put these on a light pole
[2:11:26.200 --> 2:11:30.320]  this could distract somebody and cause a wreck so it's okay to have the lost dog
[2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:37.840]  or the school event or the police barbecue or garage sales up on the pole
[2:11:37.840 --> 2:11:44.040]  you just don't put a picture of God that is Obama up on there the good news is
[2:11:44.040 --> 2:11:47.200]  I'm looking at TV stations all over the country and newspapers all over the
[2:11:47.200 --> 2:11:52.840]  country you can just type Obama Joker go to Google news or start page.com and
[2:11:52.840 --> 2:11:57.880]  click on the news search and you'll just see scores of articles and stories and
[2:11:57.880 --> 2:12:02.520]  and where where they're going it's horrible Alex Jones needs to be arrested
[2:12:02.520 --> 2:12:07.160]  this is so un-American it's disrespectful it's illegal to talk about our
[2:12:07.160 --> 2:12:11.040]  president and then the comments are you crazy there's nothing more American it
[2:12:11.040 --> 2:12:15.520]  was okay to show Bush as the Joker as a vampire I saw these bushes a monkey put
[2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:20.640]  up everywhere I saw Bush as a vampire put up everywhere and that was good
[2:12:20.640 --> 2:12:24.200]  because Bush was a new older puppet but I've always said instead of just putting
[2:12:24.200 --> 2:12:29.120]  up Bush and Obama let's put up David Rockefeller let's put up Ted Turner
[2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:33.120]  let's put up the real controllers Bill Gates Warren Buffett the Queen of
[2:12:33.120 --> 2:12:38.000]  England that's why I've done spoofs defiling the Queen of England she's not
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:43.480]  my god everybody bowing down and worshipping her our founding fathers
[2:12:43.480 --> 2:12:48.240]  burned evages of the Royals that's what America is not worshipping the Queen
[2:12:48.240 --> 2:12:52.360]  when she comes here but the gateway to find out they're all puppets and to get
[2:12:52.360 --> 2:12:58.120]  to the real elite is info wars.com and Obama so you wear this shirt getting
[2:12:58.120 --> 2:13:01.160]  their face let them know you're an American and they get in your face I
[2:13:01.160 --> 2:13:05.600]  don't like that shirt so but you liked it when it was Bush and then explain to
[2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:09.240]  them by the way I'm not for Bush either and I told my guys we just got so busy
[2:13:09.240 --> 2:13:13.560]  getting these eight shirts made I do want to George Bush just tell Jenae our
[2:13:13.560 --> 2:13:18.520]  graphics girl take the White House photo of Bush and make it look like this
[2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:25.520]  one I wanted a video same style same look I want to get a shirt up of that by

[2:13:37.480 --> 2:13:40.960]  job made right here in the good old USA and so we're gonna have a Bush one for
[2:13:40.960 --> 2:13:46.480]  you too we're also doing one with Bush and Obama as vampires drinking blood from
[2:13:46.480 --> 2:13:50.200]  the Statue of Liberty to say they're both jokers see that's what it's all

[2:14:06.640 --> 2:14:10.880]  your mind is an act of political terrorism and that's what the hate speech
[2:14:10.880 --> 2:14:16.240]  law says this is the Louisville Courier Journal I mean this is mainstream news
[2:14:16.240 --> 2:14:20.520]  they're saying speech is bad now now folks I know it sounds extreme and
[2:14:20.520 --> 2:14:25.960]  radical but it's not in America you used to have free speech congressman
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:30.240]  Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law that's key that's coming up
[2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:36.680]  that's up on prison planet but right now who's up next here first Richard and
[2:14:36.680 --> 2:14:43.160]  PA you're on the air go ahead thank you Alex gentleman was one earlier and he
[2:14:43.160 --> 2:14:47.960]  said that bring the rosary well my opinion is we ought to hold our
[2:14:47.960 --> 2:14:53.360]  politicians to the 10 Commandments they are not being lived up to I agree with
[2:14:53.360 --> 2:15:00.520]  you sir what else is on your mind a lot this health care deal is a bunch of
[2:15:00.520 --> 2:15:10.240]  crap our government well my father grandfather and great great grandfather
[2:15:10.240 --> 2:15:15.560]  all foot and words and the way our government is going today we're gonna
[2:15:15.560 --> 2:15:23.840]  have one in the streets well that could be the false flag is that they know
[2:15:23.840 --> 2:15:27.600]  again they've been building this police state up building North come up for
[2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:31.920]  decades it didn't get set up in 2002 as we've been told we have the government
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:35.040]  documents Clinton gave speeches about it they've been building this internal
[2:15:35.040 --> 2:15:39.880]  national police this control grid up to this point now they're launching all the
[2:15:39.880 --> 2:15:43.600]  crises at once I think they want a violent revolution they're probably
[2:15:43.600 --> 2:15:48.120]  gonna stage terror attacks and say we did it now been predicting that if we saw
[2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:54.000]  the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL come out and start that script that it
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:16:00.520]  was a sure thing what started two days ago well I like I said I think we want
[2:16:00.520 --> 2:16:05.440]  to hold the politicians to the 10 Commandments and also use the
[2:16:05.440 --> 2:16:11.640]  Constitution to throw the bums out I agree and I appreciate your call but the
[2:16:11.640 --> 2:16:14.920]  thing I'm trying to make clear here is we've got to explain who's behind the
[2:16:14.920 --> 2:16:20.840]  terror who has the motive who's been caught doing it before I mean folks I
[2:16:20.840 --> 2:16:24.920]  understand them so well but it's really not even hard to do it's not like it's
[2:16:24.920 --> 2:16:30.480]  some feet it'd be like if I said to my wife honey the it's gonna get dark in
[2:16:30.480 --> 2:16:33.320]  about an hour and it was 8 o'clock at night everybody knows it's about to get
[2:16:33.320 --> 2:16:36.680]  dark in the and it got dark she would to say oh my gosh you're the greatest
[2:16:36.680 --> 2:16:42.560]  genius on earth I know how they work these guys bombed ok see these guys
[2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:46.880]  carry out the terror attacks every time they politically are losing they stage
[2:16:46.880 --> 2:16:51.080]  terror attacks that's in army field manuals in fact what you guys search
[2:16:51.080 --> 2:16:59.840]  engine army field manual 2004 false flag that'll get it and I want to because I
[2:16:59.840 --> 2:17:04.640]  forget the exact field manual number this is officially a secret army field
[2:17:04.640 --> 2:17:08.800]  manual the news admitted a year ago when this came out it was real the army got
[2:17:08.800 --> 2:17:13.240]  mad and said that's classified WikiLeaks put it out now we already know the army
[2:17:13.240 --> 2:17:18.080]  did to stay behind networks in the NATO option in gladio every time people in
[2:17:18.080 --> 2:17:21.920]  Italy or Germany or other country were about to vote out the government they
[2:17:21.920 --> 2:17:26.800]  didn't like the US Army goes and stages terror attacks and then blames it on the
[2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:31.120]  enemies and the Italian police go and arrest them I mean this is standard
[2:17:31.120 --> 2:17:35.240]  procedure I mean it's standard the American people are about to get their
[2:17:35.240 --> 2:17:40.240]  rights back get us out of the UN abolish the Federal Reserve in 1995 the
[2:17:40.240 --> 2:17:45.080]  feds blew up their own federal building I mean these people have got aces up
[2:17:45.080 --> 2:17:48.240]  their sleeves you heard the caller earlier saying how talk to my sheriff he
[2:17:48.240 --> 2:17:52.520]  knows what's going on I'm really positive yes positive things are happening
[2:17:52.520 --> 2:17:57.360]  but then we know the establishment is going to stage terror attacks and say
[2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:02.120]  we did it just like the Sun came up this morning and just like the Sun's going
[2:18:02.120 --> 2:18:10.360]  down tonight I mean it's guaranteed unless we expose their trick I mean if

[2:18:13.960 --> 2:18:18.400]  minute you know they're leaning back with their fingers and pulling aces out
[2:18:18.400 --> 2:18:22.480]  of their sleeve the minute you know they're doing that trick in the sleeve
[2:18:22.480 --> 2:18:26.320]  it's over you're like hey you're cheating give him a money back you're

[2:18:48.280 --> 2:18:54.280]  living plastic itself assembles in the body it replicates and mutates and
[2:18:54.280 --> 2:19:03.200]  changes our DNA well I happen to have German news and other mainstream news
[2:19:03.200 --> 2:19:09.840]  where they admit it's grown on dead fetal tissue the Novotas vaccine the big
[2:19:09.840 --> 2:19:18.240]  one the US government bought and that it has live cancer viruses in it and
[2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:26.800]  that's out of the they're actually a poly they're grown in like a poly what
[2:19:26.800 --> 2:19:31.000]  you call it like a sediment to grow it in the lab it's it's made from just a
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:35.960]  polyfill stay there because you sound like you work in one of these labs I
[2:19:35.960 --> 2:19:39.560]  just go off with the medical doctor saying what the news says they grow the
[2:19:39.560 --> 2:19:46.200]  cancer viruses in caterpillar eggs in dead baby retina tissue for some reason
[2:19:46.200 --> 2:19:53.640]  and in dead dog tissue and dead monkey tissue so dogs monkeys dead babies and
[2:19:53.640 --> 2:19:59.480]  caterpillar eggs so maybe you can explain to me this other thing you're

[2:25:48.440 --> 2:25:55.400]  in New York rich you're on the air go ahead yeah hello Alex welcome welcome
[2:25:55.400 --> 2:25:59.840]  I love your show man I gotta say I also did your bump music wish you would play
[2:25:59.840 --> 2:26:03.880]  a little more Frank Zappa because he knew it was going on for decades anyway
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:08.640]  I'm a health care worker in New York City and I had an idea about how to avoid
[2:26:08.640 --> 2:26:14.760]  the the flu shot they haven't been able to yet control who we see as a doctor
[2:26:14.760 --> 2:26:19.640]  I was saying if everybody would just go to their family physician if they could
[2:26:19.640 --> 2:26:24.000]  really trust them and say hey can you take that stuff and just shoot it in the
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:28.360]  garbage pail and give me the right off that you did it but look it's I mean
[2:26:28.360 --> 2:26:31.520]  it's more than just that they're ordering the medical workers I remember I
[2:26:31.520 --> 2:26:34.920]  think it was you that called a few weeks ago and said I just got the document but
[2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:38.800]  since then it's been all over the news that they are forcing health care workers
[2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:42.560]  to take it we're just threatening them with their job there's no law you were
[2:26:42.560 --> 2:26:49.320]  that guy right yeah yeah yeah okay well Jason I called Bermas up and spoke him
[2:26:49.320 --> 2:26:52.600]  about the black ops helicopters a while back I don't know if I was the same guy
[2:26:52.600 --> 2:26:56.800]  so it was another another guy from New York who was told they had to take the
[2:26:56.800 --> 2:27:00.760]  flu shot over the news the unions are fighting right now for I'm gonna just
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:04.160]  want to get this straight because this is really getting wild here are you the
[2:27:04.160 --> 2:27:08.040]  caller I'm just seeing my memories right are you the caller that called a few
[2:27:08.040 --> 2:27:13.800]  weeks ago and said you guys have been told you had to take the flu shot I had
[2:27:13.800 --> 2:27:17.920]  called several times I might have gone in on there it was an agenda that I had
[2:27:17.920 --> 2:27:20.840]  they asked me what I wanted to talk about I don't think I got through but
[2:27:20.840 --> 2:27:24.640]  yeah that's definitely going on so it was another medical worker I was just
[2:27:24.640 --> 2:27:28.840]  seeing the issue is is this is really going on that they're ordering people
[2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:33.560]  through color of law that they've got to take these shots and I think now they've
[2:27:33.560 --> 2:27:38.000]  actually got that to the point where they have well 1199 has always been a
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:42.880]  little political as far as siding with the wrong people but seems like they're
[2:27:42.880 --> 2:27:48.280]  trying to move so it's getting their health care workers to do this and they
[2:27:48.280 --> 2:27:53.960]  will protect them so my thing my question to you sir is is there a way
[2:27:53.960 --> 2:27:59.640]  maybe through relinquishing the your power of attorney I've seen that
[2:27:59.640 --> 2:28:04.440]  government power of attorney over you and just relinquish it and say no you
[2:28:04.440 --> 2:28:08.240]  don't have power of attorney on well I mean they've got a guess with our license
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:12.120]  and our social and all that sign and all that but sure I appreciate your call
[2:28:12.120 --> 2:28:18.600]  sir there's an executive order and a UN treaty saying they can forcibly inject
[2:28:18.600 --> 2:28:23.760]  you lock you down shoot you if they need to that's all on record we've covered
[2:28:23.760 --> 2:28:30.040]  it here at nauseam you want to find it just search engine executive order
[2:28:30.040 --> 2:28:34.360]  quarantine and that brings up CBS news first and then it's got all got the
[2:28:34.360 --> 2:28:37.840]  executive order there for you and it says it all there in one article that's
[2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:42.120]  why I mentioned that one because they're still denial this is going on in big
[2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:46.600]  quarters out there and the COINTELPRO says that I'm the one making this up and

[2:28:51.240 --> 2:28:55.400]  I'm making up that they want to euthanize this when it's all in their
[2:28:55.400 --> 2:28:59.880]  own documents in their own statements in their biological diversity treaty 1996
[2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:07.880]  and their club of Rome documents and all of it but in books like eco science no

[2:33:57.880 --> 2:34:01.720]  into this because it's just really hitting me that I have become so
[2:34:01.720 --> 2:34:05.120]  conditioned to the fact that these people are doing this that I'm not
[2:34:05.120 --> 2:34:09.720]  responding to this as seriously as I should they are clearly going to make
[2:34:09.720 --> 2:34:14.000]  their move unless we get the word out and scream bloody murder this is not a
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:22.600]  drill this is not a game this is happening now I'm gonna give each caller
[2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:27.320]  one minute I have to George and Pennsylvania you're on the air welcome
[2:34:27.320 --> 2:34:30.320]  I'll be out in less than a minute thank you for being the power of the air of
[2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:36.680]  our time they as far as I'm cutting the internet off my internet technician
[2:34:36.680 --> 2:34:42.000]  son said if you could set up a virtual private network to allow us to get into
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:48.320]  your site maybe through your TV network as part of a paid bonus or through paid
[2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:56.000]  GCN that the problem is is that there are hubs there are major backbone systems
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:34:59.880]  that they're gonna shut down that's not our opinion in fact search engine this
[2:34:59.880 --> 2:35:04.520]  headline for folks should Obama be able to shut off the web and then you'll see
[2:35:04.520 --> 2:35:10.840]  Mother Jones the nation New York Times saying to save the web they have to kill
[2:35:10.840 --> 2:35:15.760]  the web and go to a thing we only have a few thousand choices so it's turning it
[2:35:15.760 --> 2:35:20.680]  into glorified cable they are really doing that and here's a good one but but
[2:35:20.680 --> 2:35:24.720]  the point is should President Obama have the power to shut down domestic
[2:35:24.720 --> 2:35:29.320]  internet traffic that this is what cyber security in the Air Force and Pentagon
[2:35:29.320 --> 2:35:34.000]  setting up these hubs is doing of course we can set up private networks over
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:38.160]  phone lines and stuff it's kind of like your BBS system but for the big massive
[2:35:38.160 --> 2:35:41.720]  poll we have reaching tens of millions a week now and yes that's what we're
[2:35:41.720 --> 2:35:46.840]  reaching it's scary responsibility we will not have that anymore so people
[2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:51.360]  better save this information save these videos get them on their computers off
[2:35:51.360 --> 2:35:57.360]  the web and have libraries so that you'll have the material to give people if
[2:35:57.360 --> 2:36:02.400]  things continue to implode and collapse but go ahead sir question I'm taking two
[2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:06.000]  more info warriors that you're suggesting you thought the people with the
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:08.840]  money were headed for the Cook Islands we're going to see if we can find them

[2:36:13.680 --> 2:36:16.840]  suggested that the people with the big money might be hiding out in the Cook

[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  other areas like San Francisco or Manhattan or places where there's more
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:49.400]  money but per capita a lot of money lives here and I've got lawyers and

[2:38:11.960 --> 2:38:21.360]  hi hey why do does anybody who would administer a shot the H1N1 vaccine need
[2:38:21.360 --> 2:38:26.440]  to be deputized because they admittedly are going to be forcing you to take it
[2:38:26.440 --> 2:38:31.880]  well that's right on I got a link right off a drudge off leaving to Boston.com
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:38.520]  no I yeah yeah that Massachusetts is deputizing dentists and pharmacists
[2:38:38.520 --> 2:38:45.240]  pharmacists and healthcare workers absolutely here it is here's the
[2:38:45.240 --> 2:38:49.320]  article right here we'll zoom in on it for everybody at state takes extra steps
[2:38:49.320 --> 2:38:53.160]  to battle flu and fall Massachusetts health authorities took the unprecedented
[2:38:53.160 --> 2:38:56.840]  step yesterday of deputizing dentists paramedics and pharmacists to help
[2:38:56.840 --> 2:39:01.840]  administer vaccines against both the seasonal flu and novel swine expected
[2:39:01.840 --> 2:39:05.200]  to make a return visit why couldn't healthcare workers give the shots they're
[2:39:05.200 --> 2:39:09.720]  going to be forcing them this is the model states health emergency powers act
[2:39:09.720 --> 2:39:16.360]  this is not our opinion now again they may set all this up create fear have
[2:39:16.360 --> 2:39:20.360]  people panic and beg for the shots just to create the image of people begging
[2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:24.920]  for it and then the real attack comes two three years down the road that could
[2:39:24.920 --> 2:39:28.520]  be what's happening but there's no doubt at stage there's no doubt they're
[2:39:28.520 --> 2:39:32.600]  hyping it there's no doubt they're bringing in the martial law now are
[2:39:32.600 --> 2:39:39.320]  they gonna fully fully implement it I don't know but all this coming tell
[2:39:39.320 --> 2:39:42.840]  pro the last six months all over talk radio in the last eight months since
[2:39:42.840 --> 2:39:46.600]  January I've been saying I believe they're gonna play the flu card I believe
[2:39:46.600 --> 2:39:51.800]  they're gonna play the flu card knowing the enemy seeing their preparations
[2:39:51.800 --> 2:39:56.880]  they're they're conditioning and then in and then in April I said I don't know
[2:39:56.880 --> 2:40:01.480]  if this is real but they're certainly setting it up like it is this could be
[2:40:01.480 --> 2:40:05.760]  yet I've got internal documents we're really at level six months later it
[2:40:05.760 --> 2:40:11.160]  came out I was accurate I posted the secret document and co until pro attacks
[2:40:11.160 --> 2:40:14.560]  and says we're making it up I'm getting death threats everything else this is
[2:40:14.560 --> 2:40:20.520]  really happening ladies and gentlemen anything else sir no just keep up a
[2:40:20.520 --> 2:40:27.360]  good fight man I just wish it wasn't real believe me I wish I wasn't telling
[2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:31.920]  the truth how I'm I do I I told people back in October they threatened
[2:40:31.920 --> 2:40:36.520]  Congress with martial law because we had sources and then few days later it came
[2:40:36.520 --> 2:40:41.480]  out on C-span and people still say I'm a liar I can have Senator Inhofe
[2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:46.080]  congressman who's the one from California we always have on Sherman
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:51.160]  Rod Paul has told you and now it's been in the mainstream news I mean I it's
[2:40:51.160 --> 2:40:55.060]  really happening I mean they really say they're poisoning our water and want
[2:40:55.060 --> 2:40:58.520]  to sterilize us and take all the children at birth they really say they're
[2:40:58.520 --> 2:41:02.600]  taking the kids in England now starting with 22,000 families and making them
[2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:07.360]  guilty first just taking the kids and raising them in government facilities
[2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:11.600]  and cameras in the people's homes I mean people don't believe that just Google
[2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:16.960]  22,000 cameras to watch 20 people in British homes I mean you can't make it
[2:41:16.960 --> 2:41:26.880]  up it could all end if we just stand up and realize these are criminals running
[2:41:26.880 --> 2:41:33.840]  things it would all end it would all end you know I use Hollywood movies as
[2:41:33.840 --> 2:41:37.160]  parallels or analogies because the public may not know history but they
[2:41:37.160 --> 2:41:41.760]  know Hollywood movies and I was jogging for an hour this morning even though the
[2:41:41.760 --> 2:41:44.560]  world's going to hell in a handbasket I made the commitment to take that time
[2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:50.560]  out every day and I'm and it's a parable of how slow and easy wins the
[2:41:50.560 --> 2:41:58.160]  race taking action actually pays off I've lost 3637 pounds now gonna lose
[2:41:58.160 --> 2:42:06.120]  another 30 plus I'm gonna go down to 180 but that's a side issue I I watched
[2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:16.000]  the last hour of 10,000 BC which is a hypothetical it's not really real it's
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:21.240]  kind of legend like some guys from Atlantis you know their civilization
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:26.200]  just destroyed an earthquake so they you know you know three white dudes is
[2:42:26.200 --> 2:42:30.580]  basically what they are go into Egypt and the Mediterranean off the
[2:42:30.580 --> 2:42:33.680]  Mediterranean they parked their ship they con the locals at their gods
[2:42:33.680 --> 2:42:39.520]  wearing headdresses fooling them and then they set up a slave system well
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:44.040]  that's actually what the priest in Egypt actually did and that's the secrets
[2:42:44.040 --> 2:42:48.640]  the masons have that's the that's the guild secret is actually how to manipulate
[2:42:48.640 --> 2:42:52.680]  populations how to compartmentalize so I saw this movie people been telling me
[2:42:52.680 --> 2:42:56.680]  about it and most of its fiction but it's got some real history it said in it
[2:42:56.680 --> 2:43:03.560]  and it's all how they sit there and con the people they're not really gods but
[2:43:03.560 --> 2:43:06.680]  it's just a few of them are able there's only one living it by the end of the
[2:43:06.680 --> 2:43:09.600]  movie and finally the guy throws the spear and kills him I'm giving the movie
[2:43:09.600 --> 2:43:18.680]  away but you should see it adults will see this and won't even get it and so
[2:43:18.680 --> 2:43:22.840]  you've got this priest classed only a few hundred priests and this one con
[2:43:22.840 --> 2:43:28.880]  artist manipulating tens of thousands of slaves and bowing down because he knew

[2:54:37.320 --> 2:54:42.000]  man it's coming up in about 10 minutes and where your phone calls here's the
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:49.920]  bottom line when I got up here on air in the last 13 years and talked about how
[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:54.240]  the military was preparing to take over America I didn't know when it was going
[2:54:54.240 --> 2:54:58.240]  to happen I just went to urban warfare drills where the military admitted they
[2:54:58.240 --> 2:55:01.520]  were and admitted they were practicing to break up our families and take our
[2:55:01.520 --> 2:55:06.720]  guns then I found out about Rex 84 and congressional hearings about FEMA camps
[2:55:06.720 --> 2:55:11.960]  and I got the congressional video of it and made films and interviewed police
[2:55:11.960 --> 2:55:17.920]  chiefs they tried to buy off and I found out that you have a drug dealing
[2:55:17.920 --> 2:55:24.200]  child kidnap ring running private global corporate group of just totally ruthless
[2:55:24.200 --> 2:55:28.400]  people that launder money create Ponzi schemes get all their power through the
[2:55:28.400 --> 2:55:32.280]  regional private central banks that issue the currency and credit that this sick
[2:55:32.280 --> 2:55:36.880]  crew of criminals who all one up each other on the most evil stuff they can
[2:55:36.880 --> 2:55:41.760]  do are also eugenicist and believe that we're scum and trash and deserve to die
[2:55:41.760 --> 2:55:49.720]  as the White House science are rights and says in eco science and it's been
[2:55:49.720 --> 2:55:54.440]  clear in the last seven eight years they were going to use vaccines as one way to
[2:55:54.440 --> 2:55:59.240]  do it and through the shots give you a binary weapon so they can later give you
[2:55:59.240 --> 2:56:03.840]  the other half and kill you but then they won't be affected and then it turns
[2:56:03.840 --> 2:56:07.560]  out we've got on government documents about soft kill weapons and in here they
[2:56:07.560 --> 2:56:11.280]  talk about vaccines that sterilize you and the South Africans do it these big
[2:56:11.280 --> 2:56:15.360]  CNN producers have now made a report about it I mean this is really going on
[2:56:15.360 --> 2:56:20.800]  and it's covered in the film anthrax war that we carry at info wars calm there
[2:56:20.800 --> 2:56:29.640]  on the bookstore so I told people back in January and March and April January
[2:56:29.640 --> 2:56:33.280]  February March April I said I think they're gonna play the flu card March
[2:56:33.280 --> 2:56:36.400]  5th I did a whole show on it and I said they're getting the troops ready they're
[2:56:36.400 --> 2:56:39.000]  getting the mass graves ready they're getting the National Guard ready they're
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:41.920]  getting the troops ready to lock down the cities under North com brigade

[2:57:18.040 --> 2:57:22.040]  admit they're building them now and it's all over the news see they just need the
[2:57:22.040 --> 2:57:27.440]  media knew they were there they just had to stall long enough to get that it was
[2:57:27.440 --> 2:57:33.040]  for the flu in place but they built this all years ago now it doesn't mean
[2:57:33.040 --> 2:57:36.400]  they're gonna do it this fall they already tried the model states health

[2:57:49.600 --> 2:57:52.720]  but with the flu people weren't scared of them saying you got to take the shots
[2:57:52.720 --> 2:57:59.040]  for smallpox it's a federalization drill it's a UN control grill it does all

[3:00:21.840 --> 3:00:25.800]  William Madsen is one of the first international journalist reporting from
[3:00:25.800 --> 3:00:30.720]  Capitol Hill saying top horology talk to said the H1N1 was manufactured that
[3:00:30.720 --> 3:00:35.160]  then came out in BBC or Spiegel they looked at it is manufactured they
[3:00:35.160 --> 3:00:41.040]  don't know by who but the issue is it's only killed 1,800 and something in the
[3:00:41.040 --> 3:00:47.880]  other hemisphere during the peak of the season the US 37,000 36,800 and
[3:00:47.880 --> 3:00:54.280]  something around let's just say 36,000 37,000 die a year from regular flu what
[3:00:54.280 --> 3:00:58.560]  is gonna happen when tens of thousands die from the flu they can shut

[3:01:09.720 --> 3:01:14.720]  Health Organization now I kept telling you because I'm only going off the
[3:01:14.720 --> 3:01:18.240]  model states health emergency powers act that's federal law for them to lock
[3:01:18.240 --> 3:01:23.040]  down the cities forcibly inject you take you to sports stadiums I mean I've
[3:01:23.040 --> 3:01:27.200]  read hundreds of articles on air over the last eight years or so seven years
[3:01:27.200 --> 3:01:33.520]  that they've been hyping this where they admit that they're gonna lock down the
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:36.920]  cities and forcibly inject you I mean it's not like people are saying how did
[3:01:36.920 --> 3:01:40.320]  you know this it's all coming true I this is what they said they were gonna do
[3:01:40.320 --> 3:01:44.680]  so everybody's calling up freaking out emails calls the office everybody going
[3:01:44.680 --> 3:01:50.600]  nuts it you should be upset but this is standard procedure see I mean people
[3:01:50.600 --> 3:01:55.120]  keep thinking I'm making all this up I'm going off their own admissions I keep
[3:01:55.120 --> 3:02:00.520]  saying that but it's incredible I mean I'll get calls from the national media
[3:02:00.520 --> 3:02:05.800]  going you said they were doing gun confiscation drills in Iowa and the
[3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:09.320]  southern property law centers attacking me all over national news saying I was
[3:02:09.320 --> 3:02:14.440]  reading out of the Iowa newspaper where the Army officer was there saying it was
[3:02:14.440 --> 3:02:23.640]  a gun confiscation drill I mean it just makes my head spin you know it's like
[3:02:23.640 --> 3:02:27.840]  when I tell you there's a Army field manual and I read the Army field manual
[3:02:27.840 --> 3:02:30.800]  number to you earlier let's punch up the actual manual that tells them how to
[3:02:30.800 --> 3:02:39.000]  stage terror attacks against people to blame it on them and I told you that the
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:50.040]  key to them implementing this flu this dark winter I told you the key to that
[3:02:50.040 --> 3:02:56.880]  would be if they simultaneously say gun owners are militias are white
[3:02:56.880 --> 3:03:01.200]  supremacist so they demonize gun owners and militias and are planning to strike
[3:03:01.200 --> 3:03:05.120]  and I said if the southern property law center because they're the real in the
[3:03:05.120 --> 3:03:10.440]  field people that's who I always see with their hands and the really dirty
[3:03:10.440 --> 3:03:14.800]  stuff if you see them come out and say that and launch that play I mean they're
[3:03:14.800 --> 3:03:18.480]  in motion right now quarterbacks going back about to do a Hail Mary and I'm
[3:03:18.480 --> 3:03:23.320]  like mayday folks they're about to do it and and now they're launching the ball
[3:03:23.320 --> 3:03:29.200]  yesterday they released the ball I mean they're definitely going for it and
[3:03:29.200 --> 3:03:36.680]  well if I was a fed and could take off the next few months and had hours built
[3:03:36.680 --> 3:03:40.640]  up or retirement built up I'd get the hell out of there I mean I mean tell
[3:03:40.640 --> 3:03:45.720]  you because I know the number one target of the of the globalist and if you see
[3:03:45.720 --> 3:03:48.360]  suspicious people getting out of a rider truck in front of your building you

[3:03:59.240 --> 3:04:02.640]  and then they do this and they do that look out and the exact pattern is now

[3:08:37.480 --> 3:08:42.760]  use pandemic to declare martial law and it says
[3:08:42.760 --> 3:08:47.720]  Georgia Congressman Paul Brown warned attendees of a town hall event Tuesday
[3:08:47.720 --> 3:08:50.520]  that the obama administration was planning to use
[3:08:50.520 --> 3:08:54.120]  a pandemic or a national disaster to implement martial law in the united
[3:08:54.120 --> 3:08:57.560]  states speaking at the north georgia technical
[3:08:57.560 --> 3:09:01.080]  college auditorium brown said the socialistic elite
[3:09:01.080 --> 3:09:04.760]  as well as obama Nancy Pelosi senate major leader Harry Reid were planning to
[3:09:04.760 --> 3:09:07.720]  exploit the crisis to create a favorable climate for their
[3:09:07.720 --> 3:09:13.160]  stalling political agenda exactly what we've been telling you
[3:09:13.160 --> 3:09:16.120]  they are trying to develop an environment where they can take over he said
[3:09:16.120 --> 3:09:19.560]  we've seen that historically and notice there's really seamless integration
[3:09:19.560 --> 3:09:23.800]  between bush and obama and i remember him saying this six months ago now it's
[3:09:23.800 --> 3:09:29.640]  hit mainstream news when madsen's talked about the first time ever in 233 years
[3:09:29.640 --> 3:09:33.720]  of us history cheney left a stay behind network
[3:09:33.720 --> 3:09:37.720]  like like nato dibble the soviets took over in the in the in
[3:09:37.720 --> 3:09:40.520]  it's really still cheney and bush running things to a start
[3:09:40.520 --> 3:09:45.080]  i heard madsen say that six months ago and kind of huh but now i've analyzed it
[3:09:45.080 --> 3:09:52.200]  it's true and these obama idiots have no idea what they're dealing with
[3:09:52.200 --> 3:09:54.920]  they're trying to develop an environment where they can take over he said
[3:09:54.920 --> 3:09:58.200]  we've seen that historically brown's warning arrives on the backs of a
[3:09:58.200 --> 3:10:00.440]  letter sent to the national governor's association
[3:10:00.440 --> 3:10:03.720]  to the pentagon last week which condemns the military's plans to usurp
[3:10:03.720 --> 3:10:06.920]  domestic control of national guard and federal forces deployed in the event of
[3:10:06.920 --> 3:10:10.920]  a natural disaster or terror attack and then it goes into
[3:10:10.920 --> 3:10:14.280]  to brigade's homeland and how they say they're quote going to pull triggers
[3:10:14.280 --> 3:10:17.720]  on the american people and suddenly regular federal army

[3:13:23.960 --> 3:13:28.120]  in washington there's a conference i believe you had something posted about
[3:13:28.120 --> 3:13:32.120]  this on your website but uh... it's on swine flu it's at the
[3:13:32.120 --> 3:13:36.840]  capitol hill high hotel and here's here's some of the breakout
[3:13:36.840 --> 3:13:41.080]  sessions mass fatality management planning out there
[3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:44.440]  direct fatality management tactical operations
[3:13:44.440 --> 3:13:48.920]  conduct morgue operations conducts final disposition that's a body
[3:13:48.920 --> 3:13:53.240]  and that is something i can't figure manage anti-mortem data now i know what
[3:13:53.240 --> 3:13:55.800]  post-mortem data is that how many people
[3:13:55.800 --> 3:13:59.800]  would have died but what in the world is anti-mortem data i mean are
[3:13:59.800 --> 3:14:03.400]  is this like they figured it out beforehand how many people
[3:14:03.400 --> 3:14:07.720]  no guy and then and you know they have a as a thoughtful filling uh... wish
[3:14:07.720 --> 3:14:10.840]  there uh... psychological issues you talk about
[3:14:10.840 --> 3:14:15.240]  fire publics the stress of exposure and safety breakdown of public services
[3:14:15.240 --> 3:14:18.920]  utilities i'm willing to follow government orders
[3:14:18.920 --> 3:14:21.880]  now that now this is obviously being held on capitol hill
[3:14:21.880 --> 3:14:25.400]  have to help them because they want to get you know members of congress
[3:14:25.400 --> 3:14:29.240]  or that especially their staffers to go to this thing but this is what they're
[3:14:29.240 --> 3:14:31.880]  talking about continuity of operations planning
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:35.000]  disruptions the public private and critical infrastructure
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:38.920]  undermining essential functions uh... so there you have it this is what
[3:14:38.920 --> 3:14:42.680]  they're talking about uh... um... the problem with each one and one
[3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:47.400]  for that pandemic is unfolded to or three successive ways
[3:14:47.400 --> 3:14:50.840]  in a calendar year so we're talking about october
[3:14:50.840 --> 3:14:54.760]  uh... as you know sort of ground zero at least in north america
[3:14:54.760 --> 3:14:58.840]  october into april right right and uh...
[3:14:58.840 --> 3:15:02.840]  uh... so this is what they're talking about uh... and this is next week in
[3:15:02.840 --> 3:15:05.000]  washington i'm going to try to cover this they
[3:15:05.000 --> 3:15:08.280]  they want to almost two thousand dollars to be registered
[3:15:08.280 --> 3:15:11.880]  uh... normally but i hopefully uh... they're going to you know let press in
[3:15:11.880 --> 3:15:14.920]  there to cover what they're talking about because there's a lot of government
[3:15:14.920 --> 3:15:18.520]  uh... people are people from world health organization people from the u.s
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:22.440]  government all scheduled to speak at this thing
[3:15:22.440 --> 3:15:25.880]  unbelievable they put that big price tag on there to make a cost prohibitive for
[3:15:25.880 --> 3:15:28.040]  most journalists but you're with an international
[3:15:28.040 --> 3:15:31.960]  tv network and right for major publications so they should let you in
[3:15:31.960 --> 3:15:35.320]  for free uh... just as press but we certainly want to have you here
[3:15:35.320 --> 3:15:38.840]  reporting for us wayne wayne you heard me rant through as you were on hold for
[3:15:38.840 --> 3:15:42.600]  five minutes all the different little tidbits congressman saying it's a
[3:15:42.600 --> 3:15:45.880]  cover for martial law open announcements they're going to force
[3:15:45.880 --> 3:15:49.160]  will be inoculate in lockdown cities now that doesn't mean they're going to get
[3:15:49.160 --> 3:15:52.120]  away with this but they're certainly now saying
[3:15:52.120 --> 3:15:55.320]  they're going to do this and that's what level six rules mean
[3:15:55.320 --> 3:15:59.000]  that's what the executive order now activated means
[3:15:59.000 --> 3:16:03.000]  what is your i know you are up on at capitol hill i know you're at the press
[3:16:03.000 --> 3:16:05.960]  club i know you have sources i've really become
[3:16:05.960 --> 3:16:09.640]  to respect and be impressed you know you're one of our best sources when i've
[3:16:09.640 --> 3:16:12.680]  really not seen you be wrong yet which is scaring me
[3:16:12.680 --> 3:16:16.840]  you day one said you had virologist that we're saying was manufactured that got
[3:16:16.840 --> 3:16:21.080]  seconded months later what is going on with this flu is it really going to kill
[3:16:21.080 --> 3:16:25.080]  a bunch of people or is it the excuse to bring
[3:16:25.080 --> 3:16:27.800]  in tyranny is that a beta test of tyranny
[3:16:27.800 --> 3:16:31.400]  or is it a test if they think they'll get away with it will they go over with
[3:16:31.400 --> 3:16:34.600]  total control as a smoke screen for the collapsing
[3:16:34.600 --> 3:16:38.520]  economy and the and and use it to pass the cap and trade and
[3:16:38.520 --> 3:16:42.280]  the banker bailout to and i mean what's going on with this
[3:16:42.280 --> 3:16:46.920]  well i i there's two protocols that seem to be in place and reporting now
[3:16:46.920 --> 3:16:50.280]  first we heard about people being infected we got those you know
[3:16:50.280 --> 3:16:54.440]  you know brazil's been hit and then it was you know panamav and it was
[3:16:54.440 --> 3:16:58.360]  india now we're hearing about deaths from all these various countries you know
[3:16:58.360 --> 3:17:01.640]  first step in the caragua uh... but uh...
[3:17:01.640 --> 3:17:06.120]  uh... one thing they talk about is how most of it most of not all these people
[3:17:06.120 --> 3:17:07.640]  died because of it
[3:17:07.640 --> 3:17:11.160]  i mean they already had a pre-existing condition
[3:17:11.160 --> 3:17:14.840]  i i'm here for people in the medical community that that is actually
[3:17:14.840 --> 3:17:19.240]  uh... not the case for the most part that these people walk in healthy
[3:17:19.240 --> 3:17:22.840]  and in some cases you know a few those later they're dead
[3:17:22.840 --> 3:17:26.520]  uh... the other thing is undercounting the number of deaths i understand from
[3:17:26.520 --> 3:17:29.400]  a source in chicarta indonesia which is now been
[3:17:29.400 --> 3:17:34.920]  hit by the h1n1 that the government there is actually under
[3:17:34.920 --> 3:17:38.520]  counting the number of deaths so yeah the state of texas document i got
[3:17:38.520 --> 3:17:42.120]  saying we tell the public we're at level four we're really at level five
[3:17:42.120 --> 3:17:45.320]  in ninety six hours we go to level six that was in
[3:17:45.320 --> 3:17:49.160]  april turned out that that was an accurate document at least for being
[3:17:49.160 --> 3:17:52.360]  level six they said the deaths were much higher
[3:17:52.360 --> 3:17:56.600]  so continue well i mean and and you know there's
[3:17:56.600 --> 3:17:59.560]  conference next week uh... here's what they're going to talk about when it
[3:17:59.560 --> 3:18:03.800]  comes to all of the public about controlling and diffusing social
[3:18:03.800 --> 3:18:06.280]  unrest and public disorder with this
[3:18:06.280 --> 3:18:09.800]  swine flu so it's clear that they know that they know what's coming down the
[3:18:09.800 --> 3:18:12.680]  pike unless the people putting this on
[3:18:12.680 --> 3:18:15.720]  are just using scare tactics to make a lot of money
[3:18:15.720 --> 3:18:19.640]  i i don't get the impression that's the case one thing that i kind of
[3:18:19.640 --> 3:18:24.040]  uh... worries me about this uh... conference it's organized by a company
[3:18:24.040 --> 3:18:28.280]  that's privately held company and there's no information on who their
[3:18:28.280 --> 3:18:32.200]  corporate officials are i don't hear long enough to know what
[3:18:32.200 --> 3:18:36.360]  a possibly it's an intelligence front oh absolutely uh... this is all uh...
[3:18:36.360 --> 3:18:40.120]  uh... a a a a getting all the ducks in a row
[3:18:40.120 --> 3:18:45.320]  operation right anything on anything on pennsylvania avenue as it is
[3:18:45.320 --> 3:18:48.760]  conference planner uh... if it's on pennsylvania avenue that's pretty high
[3:18:48.760 --> 3:18:51.800]  rent so somebody's somebody's putting a bell
[3:18:51.800 --> 3:18:55.240]  yeah so we got them all getting their little minions
[3:18:55.240 --> 3:18:58.920]  a how to line up at the at the at the south's breast
[3:18:58.920 --> 3:19:02.680]  and uh... be what talking points to cover so they're getting their ducks in a
[3:19:02.680 --> 3:19:06.120]  row uh... but but but i mean what about the mass
[3:19:06.120 --> 3:19:09.480]  graves they're getting ready and the force inoculations
[3:19:09.480 --> 3:19:13.320]  clearly this is a federalization drill but not just federalization all over
[3:19:13.320 --> 3:19:17.080]  the world it's the u n directing this
[3:19:17.080 --> 3:19:20.120]  well again i mean what you know you look at that what they're going to be talking
[3:19:20.120 --> 3:19:23.880]  about here they're talking about enforcing quarantines uh...
[3:19:23.880 --> 3:19:26.760]  uh... as you know this is clearly talking about
[3:19:26.760 --> 3:19:31.960]  uh... uh... you know uh... airlines uh... restrictions on travel
[3:19:31.960 --> 3:19:36.280]  uh... restrictions at airports uh... border border across things
[3:19:36.280 --> 3:19:41.000]  uh... this is all and then and then how to handle medical waste i assume what
[3:19:41.000 --> 3:19:45.800]  that includes probably uh... dead bodies uh... you know people have died from
[3:19:45.800 --> 3:19:49.000]  this uh... when we got a break
[3:19:49.000 --> 3:19:52.920]  when we come back in the last two weeks that came out they're hiring
[3:19:52.920 --> 3:19:56.200]  tens of thousands of additional internment
[3:19:56.200 --> 3:20:01.720]  and resettlement reeducation officers i want to get your take on that
[3:20:01.720 --> 3:20:05.160]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[3:20:05.160 --> 3:20:08.600]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[3:20:08.600 --> 3:20:11.880]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[3:20:11.880 --> 3:20:15.480]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about performing with gold and
[3:20:15.480 --> 3:20:19.080]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[3:20:19.080 --> 3:20:22.920]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[3:20:22.920 --> 3:20:26.600]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank
[3:20:26.600 --> 3:20:30.280]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[3:20:30.280 --> 3:20:33.560]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[3:20:33.560 --> 3:20:37.480]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a
[3:20:37.480 --> 3:20:42.440]  full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com

[3:22:05.320 --> 3:22:09.720]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear we've got to give them a stake
[3:22:09.720 --> 3:22:14.040]  in creating the kind of world order that i think all of us would like to say
[3:22:14.040 --> 3:22:17.240]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth
[3:22:17.240 --> 3:22:20.440]  that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[3:22:20.440 --> 3:22:25.000]  well obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:29.240]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:22:29.240 --> 3:22:32.920]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[3:22:32.920 --> 3:22:38.120]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[3:22:38.120 --> 3:22:41.640]  it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government
[3:22:41.640 --> 3:22:46.600]  this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told

[3:24:34.120 --> 3:24:37.400]  and if people would just stop denying the documents we bring forward we would
[3:24:37.400 --> 3:24:41.080]  have even more political steam now to defeat this
[3:24:41.080 --> 3:24:45.080]  if people would just check into the claims we make we source everything
[3:24:45.080 --> 3:24:50.200]  instead of listening to co until pro and the simon weasenthal center and uh
[3:24:50.200 --> 3:24:53.800]  the southern poverty law center and all of lying about us

[3:25:40.680 --> 3:25:44.040]  vice president biden said as far as you know when he's talking about this
[3:25:44.040 --> 3:25:49.160]  bailout package uh the first thing he said the first priority was to uh
[3:25:49.160 --> 3:25:54.200]  uh provide more funding for funding for law enforcement agencies for the police
[3:25:54.200 --> 3:25:57.800]  around the country i mean like we don't have enough of them
[3:25:57.800 --> 3:26:01.800]  uh... it's clear it's clear that this administration is
[3:26:01.800 --> 3:26:07.800]  putting as much emphasis on all this uh domestic security uh nonsense is the
[3:26:07.800 --> 3:26:12.200]  last one and uh you know there's people out there really hurting
[3:26:12.200 --> 3:26:16.520]  and all all biden can talk about it as providing this bailout that you know
[3:26:16.520 --> 3:26:20.120]  this that is the incentive money for for cops
[3:26:20.120 --> 3:26:25.480]  and i don't think they need any more money what we've had a quadrupling in
[3:26:25.480 --> 3:26:31.000]  police the last 15 years you know i i i i i i i i i i just noticed that at the
[3:26:31.000 --> 3:26:34.920]  local bank and donuts and now seems to be four times as many cop cars sitting
[3:26:34.920 --> 3:26:38.840]  there uh while they're on break then there was before
[3:26:38.840 --> 3:26:42.280]  but then you can't get one when your house gets broken into most of the time
[3:26:42.280 --> 3:26:45.160]  uh but boy they're there with radar guns though
[3:26:45.160 --> 3:26:48.280]  absolutely they have to raise revenue for these uh
[3:26:48.280 --> 3:26:53.240]  uh state and county and municipal government because the tax base is
[3:26:53.240 --> 3:26:57.240]  collapsing so that's that's how they're uh you know they have to shake down the
[3:26:57.240 --> 3:27:01.560]  public they they're on their keep well
[3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:06.040]  well why and how do you see this unfolding that you can go to the army's
[3:27:06.040 --> 3:27:11.880]  own website and that's actually off of a
[3:27:11.880 --> 3:27:15.720]  hispanic job site uh one of the links if you put in
[3:27:15.720 --> 3:27:19.800]  internment specialist army or just national guard internment specials you
[3:27:19.800 --> 3:27:23.400]  can actually go to national guard dot mill but
[3:27:23.400 --> 3:27:26.600]  doesn't matter we'll show folks that's good enough um
[3:27:26.600 --> 3:27:30.680]  i mean they're really gearing up it the new economy is the police state
[3:27:30.680 --> 3:27:34.120]  the new i mean all the major new grants and
[3:27:34.120 --> 3:27:37.400]  scholarships are for this just everything's converting
[3:27:37.400 --> 3:27:40.920]  to private security firms and prisons and cameras
[3:27:40.920 --> 3:27:45.160]  owned by a few government cronies i mean i guess the government's not
[3:27:45.160 --> 3:27:48.920]  happy to just ship in the heroin and cocaine and put all our kids in prison
[3:27:48.920 --> 3:27:52.360]  and rape us and steal all our money i mean now now they've got to just
[3:27:52.360 --> 3:27:57.320]  totally make everything a big prison well it looks that way to me especially
[3:27:57.320 --> 3:28:02.600]  with you know this this agenda that i i'm looking at here for this conference
[3:28:02.600 --> 3:28:06.280]  next week uh it will just be interesting to see who from the government
[3:28:06.280 --> 3:28:10.280]  is there even if i can't get in i'm going to be hanging around the hotel lobby
[3:28:10.280 --> 3:28:13.640]  to just check those name tags because one thing about
[3:28:13.640 --> 3:28:18.680]  this this town is they have a tendency to issue name tags for these conferences
[3:28:18.680 --> 3:28:22.200]  and of course you look under the name and you can often spot what agency they're
[3:28:22.200 --> 3:28:25.000]  with well what i mean i know you're there at the
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:28.200]  press club talking to all these other reporters and talking to intelligence
[3:28:28.200 --> 3:28:30.600]  people what's the skinny on what's coming in
[3:28:30.600 --> 3:28:35.000]  the fall well i think the anticipation there's
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:38.680]  there's actually a few threads going right now there's this fear you know
[3:28:38.680 --> 3:28:41.880]  there's fear that we're going to see a surge here in
[3:28:41.880 --> 3:28:46.920]  north america with the swine flu but also there's talk about
[3:28:46.920 --> 3:28:51.240]  being at the end of september of course at the end of the fiscal year
[3:28:51.240 --> 3:28:54.760]  and with the beginning of the new fiscal year
[3:28:54.760 --> 3:29:00.120]  october the first i'm hearing rumors about the economy may not recover when
[3:29:00.120 --> 3:29:03.800]  the commercial real estate market collapses on top of the house
[3:29:03.800 --> 3:29:06.840]  private housing market we may see more banks go under
[3:29:06.840 --> 3:29:10.520]  and there's talk about potentially a bank holiday how long it's going to last i
[3:29:10.520 --> 3:29:13.480]  don't know but just uh bank closures uh you know
[3:29:13.480 --> 3:29:17.560]  in order from the uh executive branch to close banks across the country it
[3:29:17.560 --> 3:29:20.920]  happened during the depression uh franklin roosevelt did it and i'm
[3:29:20.920 --> 3:29:24.360]  hearing that it may happen again
[3:29:25.320 --> 3:29:29.560]  when come back i found it uh if you just google internment specialist by

[3:34:59.480 --> 3:35:03.800]  labor at bases here let's just google civilian inmate labor camp program for
[3:35:03.800 --> 3:35:07.080]  everybody you know for those out there in denial
[3:35:07.080 --> 3:35:11.640]  this has been going on does that creep you out wane that they could keep these

[3:35:15.640 --> 3:35:19.560]  well i mean the whole issue of the federal emergency management agency
[3:35:19.560 --> 3:35:21.560]  uh... as you know the female
[3:35:21.560 --> 3:35:25.400]  has never operated in a very transparent mode even if you're coming back
[3:35:25.400 --> 3:35:29.800]  break in years uh... uh... they called that female the secret government and
[3:35:29.800 --> 3:35:32.120]  then there's a lot of truth to it because
[3:35:32.120 --> 3:35:35.720]  uh... they have you know that they have about these facilities around the
[3:35:35.720 --> 3:35:40.280]  country uh... uh... you don't really you know how to go on these facilities
[3:35:40.280 --> 3:35:41.080]  to see
[3:35:41.080 --> 3:35:44.520]  see what's happening but i do not need to report to there about the number of
[3:35:44.520 --> 3:35:48.520]  these uh... large uh... sent the detention centers
[3:35:48.520 --> 3:35:52.280]  that have been built up around the country i remember the first time i heard
[3:35:52.280 --> 3:35:53.480]  about this was
[3:35:53.480 --> 3:35:56.680]  somebody uh... in kern county california
[3:35:56.680 --> 3:35:59.800]  that day he started you know on his way to work every morning notice
[3:35:59.800 --> 3:36:03.000]  this camp was getting larger and larger with nobody in it yet
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:07.960]  but they kept increasing the uh... you know that the number of uh... beds uh...
[3:36:07.960 --> 3:36:10.440]  that that uh... this particular
[3:36:10.440 --> 3:36:15.240]  uh... can't call the kern county uh... uh... uh... center uh...
[3:36:15.240 --> 3:36:18.920]  um... uh... could keep you know how many prisoners they could keep so
[3:36:18.920 --> 3:36:21.880]  i mean that's one of uh... several around the country but we don't know
[3:36:21.880 --> 3:36:24.520]  often i mean the government's not very forthcoming
[3:36:24.520 --> 3:36:27.320]  uh... with information about why these camps are there
[3:36:27.320 --> 3:36:30.440]  and just to be clear i have the two thousand five on screen right now we'll
[3:36:30.440 --> 3:36:32.280]  keep scrolling through that
[3:36:32.280 --> 3:36:35.560]  you've got these back to nineteen eighty six declassified
[3:36:35.560 --> 3:36:37.880]  so you find out more in each one
[3:36:37.880 --> 3:36:41.080]  the nineteen ninety seventy classification admitted
[3:36:41.080 --> 3:36:45.080]  that they kept federal prisoners at these and brought them as slaves at the
[3:36:45.080 --> 3:36:45.800]  army
[3:36:45.800 --> 3:36:49.400]  ran them as slaves and then would pimp them out
[3:36:49.400 --> 3:36:55.080]  for slave labor around towns uh... so uh... this is the new america our new job
[3:36:55.080 --> 3:36:57.880]  is having an illegal alien who is in the military that's
[3:36:57.880 --> 3:37:01.880]  our new force commanding a citizen around who had a crooked toenail or
[3:37:01.880 --> 3:37:03.000]  something
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:05.560]  that's the news i mean i have articles right here where school teachers are
[3:37:05.560 --> 3:37:07.880]  given twenty two thousand dollar fines
[3:37:07.880 --> 3:37:10.200]  for using a cell phone in class
[3:37:10.200 --> 3:37:13.320]  see we're all prisoners now
[3:37:13.320 --> 3:37:14.160]  wayne madson
[3:37:14.160 --> 3:37:18.560]  uh... well i i i i don't think that any better i mean uh...
[3:37:18.560 --> 3:37:22.160]  but as the people i know who voted for obama and thought there was going to be
[3:37:22.160 --> 3:37:23.240]  a change that
[3:37:23.240 --> 3:37:26.800]  i hear the term buyers remorse quite a bit
[3:37:26.800 --> 3:37:30.480]  i know people who uh... who were candidates for president are here in the
[3:37:30.480 --> 3:37:31.440]  same thing
[3:37:31.440 --> 3:37:35.840]  uh... so i mean it's uh... where's the change i don't see much
[3:37:35.840 --> 3:37:39.640]  in the way i agree i want to show people from general shoemaker two thousand five
[3:37:39.640 --> 3:37:40.440]  document

[3:37:50.440 --> 3:37:52.960]  possible otherwise
[3:37:52.960 --> 3:37:55.560]  uh... due to the manning and funding constraints under which the army
[3:37:55.560 --> 3:37:57.680]  operates slave labor
[3:37:57.680 --> 3:38:01.360]  these are not these are not guys that punch the drill instructor in the nose
[3:38:01.360 --> 3:38:03.600]  these are state and federal prisoners
[3:38:03.600 --> 3:38:06.600]  and this is going to be you and your family

[3:38:07.960 --> 3:38:09.800]  well i think that we know where
[3:38:09.800 --> 3:38:11.720]  of course we're not hearing about that
[3:38:11.720 --> 3:38:13.760]  the blackwater and these uh...
[3:38:13.760 --> 3:38:17.480]  revelations made by these two former blackwater employees about
[3:38:17.480 --> 3:38:20.920]  what was going on at the uh... cancer and i have to do running
[3:38:20.920 --> 3:38:24.080]  i don't stop you know that's uh... hold on when i'm glad you brought that up
[3:38:24.080 --> 3:38:26.800]  take your time and we're gonna get into the whole birther thing let me stop
[3:38:26.800 --> 3:38:28.080]  right there
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:31.280]  start over because you have a lot of sources
[3:38:31.280 --> 3:38:34.680]  uh... time magazine for those that don't know
[3:38:34.680 --> 3:38:35.880]  uh...
[3:38:35.880 --> 3:38:37.600]  the nation
[3:38:37.600 --> 3:38:41.280]  and ross story and others have big reports that the fb is saying this it's
[3:38:41.280 --> 3:38:42.480]  in the federal documents
[3:38:42.480 --> 3:38:45.720]  that blackwater was a killing its own employees to cover up
[3:38:45.720 --> 3:38:47.080]  arms dealing
[3:38:47.080 --> 3:38:49.880]  and that's what you had said that they and others
[3:38:49.880 --> 3:38:53.160]  we use that marks have been caught and then it actually raven govern former
[3:38:53.160 --> 3:38:54.560]  top c i analyst
[3:38:54.560 --> 3:38:58.640]  ronald reagan george bursinger said that mercs he wouldn't say who were caught
[3:38:58.640 --> 3:39:02.040]  bringing weapons and actually staging attacks on the troops
[3:39:02.040 --> 3:39:04.720]  is a trillion dollar war you got to keep it going
[3:39:04.720 --> 3:39:07.120]  and have an excuse to stay there so a
[3:39:07.120 --> 3:39:11.440]  go through the blackwater revelations this the slave children they're raping
[3:39:11.440 --> 3:39:13.400]  the wife swapping the murders
[3:39:13.400 --> 3:39:16.760]  whether your intel is how bad it is but the key here
[3:39:16.760 --> 3:39:19.240]  but the media just mentioned as a footnote
[3:39:19.240 --> 3:39:22.520]  who or were they smuggling arms to an iraq
[3:39:22.520 --> 3:39:25.200]  what way madson
[3:39:25.200 --> 3:39:29.080]  but in a box smuggling uh... weapons that were winding up in the hands of the
[3:39:29.080 --> 3:39:32.840]  current and it's not from the current they wound up in the end of the
[3:39:32.840 --> 3:39:34.120]  pkk
[3:39:34.120 --> 3:39:37.800]  on the organization of turkey considers that you know to be a terrorist
[3:39:37.800 --> 3:39:38.920]  organization
[3:39:38.920 --> 3:39:42.800]  an organization of the United States considers to be a terrorist organization
[3:39:42.800 --> 3:39:44.000]  but this is all this
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:48.480]  you know keeping keeping this part of the world at at each other's throat that
[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:52.640]  you know killing each other there's profit in that and companies like blackwater
[3:39:52.640 --> 3:39:55.160]  and and and the company other companies
[3:39:55.160 --> 3:39:58.120]  there's hundreds of them like blackwater they're one of the big ones
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:01.960]  uh... all involved in the same business it's war incorporated
[3:40:01.960 --> 3:40:05.260]  and uh... you have to try to get extradited from thailand
[3:40:05.260 --> 3:40:07.880]  this russian invictor boot who they're accused of
[3:40:07.880 --> 3:40:11.480]  being the merchant of death that but uh... we've got a few of them over here
[3:40:11.480 --> 3:40:12.320]  to right
[3:40:12.320 --> 3:40:14.720]  i i i wonder what would happen if somebody
[3:40:14.720 --> 3:40:17.560]  uh... after the extradition of eric print
[3:40:17.560 --> 3:40:21.520]  the uh... blackwater now called the it could be changed her name to protect the
[3:40:21.520 --> 3:40:22.440]  guilty
[3:40:22.440 --> 3:40:26.440]  uh... but i i i would imagine we would want would not want to extradite it
[3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:27.560]  overseas
[3:40:27.560 --> 3:40:29.360]  and try on someplace like
[3:40:29.360 --> 3:40:34.200]  iraq or afghanistan but let's be clear i want specifically because you have made
[3:40:34.200 --> 3:40:37.360]  allegations and revelations over the years and it's come out later mainstream
[3:40:37.360 --> 3:40:38.800]  media confirming
[3:40:38.800 --> 3:40:41.640]  that you said contractors and the pentagon
[3:40:41.640 --> 3:40:44.480]  have been caught shipping in taliban al-qaeda
[3:40:44.480 --> 3:40:48.640]  to kill our own soldiers to make the war look like it's real
[3:40:48.640 --> 3:40:51.360]  uh... you talk about mercs bringing in weapons
[3:40:51.360 --> 3:40:54.280]  you're saying there's no evidence that blackwater was doing that this was
[3:40:54.280 --> 3:40:55.400]  separate
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:40:59.800]  uh... that the company that i was told where it was involved in this that that
[3:40:59.800 --> 3:41:02.400]  what it was uh... you know the uh...
[3:41:02.400 --> 3:41:06.920]  u.s. military but not any specific uh... contractor involved uh...
[3:41:06.920 --> 3:41:09.920]  with bringing these people into bagdad uh... these were
[3:41:09.920 --> 3:41:13.760]  afghani taliban who uh... said they were there to uh...
[3:41:13.760 --> 3:41:17.800]  you know that basically uh... you know that offer a bomb and things like that
[3:41:17.800 --> 3:41:18.480]  so
[3:41:18.480 --> 3:41:21.760]  i mean uh... this gets in this murky area of uh...
[3:41:21.760 --> 3:41:25.200]  of uh... of uh... of this contracting outsourcing uh...
[3:41:25.200 --> 3:41:29.280]  uh... by the intelligence community the cia the pentagon but it's a free for
[3:41:29.280 --> 3:41:30.520]  all iraq uh...
[3:41:30.520 --> 3:41:32.080]  i've talked to people
[3:41:32.080 --> 3:41:34.080]  uh... who've been over there
[3:41:34.080 --> 3:41:35.040]  recently
[3:41:35.040 --> 3:41:38.960]  there has been no real improvement in the infrastructure in iraq since we
[3:41:38.960 --> 3:41:41.800]  invaded that country in two thousand three so this is
[3:41:41.800 --> 3:41:45.520]  country is right this is genocide but but that's what the federal filing in the
[3:41:45.520 --> 3:41:51.040]  fb is saying this and i mean we're just reporting on what's being said here
[3:41:51.040 --> 3:41:55.120]  eric prince which would would would would would would chastise
[3:41:55.120 --> 3:41:57.600]  blackwater now xc officers
[3:41:57.600 --> 3:42:00.240]  when they would send psychopaths home who would just
[3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:03.920]  just enjoyed killing people and raping people and that prince would laugh and
[3:42:03.920 --> 3:42:05.360]  send them back
[3:42:05.360 --> 3:42:08.840]  uh... let's get into some of the federal allegations here
[3:42:08.840 --> 3:42:10.680]  raping children
[3:42:10.680 --> 3:42:14.560]  uh... pimping little girls and then wife swapping back at the bed i mean what's
[3:42:14.560 --> 3:42:18.760]  going on here well yeah these two acts of blackwater employees who
[3:42:18.760 --> 3:42:21.680]  who have been uh... who actually are testifying on the behalf of
[3:42:21.680 --> 3:42:23.520]  the iraqi families uh...
[3:42:23.520 --> 3:42:27.600]  uh... uh... who's uh... who loved ones were killed by blackwater troops uh...
[3:42:27.600 --> 3:42:29.680]  in a central square bag that
[3:42:29.680 --> 3:42:32.240]  a few years ago uh... they're testifying
[3:42:32.240 --> 3:42:33.640]  underbath saying that
[3:42:33.640 --> 3:42:37.280]  uh... back at the uh... in the north carolina headquarters the senior
[3:42:37.280 --> 3:42:41.920]  executive there was white swapping going on there no action was taken there
[3:42:41.920 --> 3:42:42.520]  was
[3:42:42.520 --> 3:42:46.160]  uh... use of these uh... what they call them and i mean camp and
[3:42:46.160 --> 3:42:48.120]  bag that it was basically
[3:42:48.120 --> 3:42:52.160]  someplace where blackwater guys would go to avail themselves and profit to
[3:42:52.160 --> 3:42:53.480]  think that they could be including
[3:42:53.480 --> 3:42:56.880]  hutch a child prostitute so i think that
[3:42:56.880 --> 3:42:59.920]  of people who want to blow the whistle on all these
[3:42:59.920 --> 3:43:03.560]  blackwater uh... uh... scandals uh... were threatened
[3:43:03.560 --> 3:43:07.800]  uh... with uh... being uh... killed and some had been killed and now i've
[3:43:07.800 --> 3:43:09.800]  covered a number of that
[3:43:09.800 --> 3:43:12.160]  among uh... active duty and
[3:43:12.160 --> 3:43:14.480]  contractor personnel in iraq so
[3:43:14.480 --> 3:43:18.480]  uh... you know there's a lot of smoking gun yeah this is just enemies of the
[3:43:18.480 --> 3:43:22.440]  contractors this is women in the contracting deal they'll just rape
[3:43:22.440 --> 3:43:23.240]  them
[3:43:23.240 --> 3:43:24.720]  torture him to death
[3:43:24.720 --> 3:43:29.280]  uh... army marine corps investigators about missing missiles weapons they
[3:43:29.280 --> 3:43:31.400]  just they just dragged them
[3:43:31.400 --> 3:43:35.800]  and i saw numbers in the thousands of fragged officers i mean this just
[3:43:35.800 --> 3:43:36.800]  sounds like
[3:43:36.800 --> 3:43:39.800]  and that the c one thirties the new york times admitted
[3:43:39.800 --> 3:43:43.640]  that everyone just uses the bathroom in buckets now and everything's collapsing
[3:43:43.640 --> 3:43:48.360]  i mean is this right the walter reeds collapsing i mean is this just like
[3:43:48.360 --> 3:43:51.960]  my daughter are they just i mean maybe the good news is they're so corrupt
[3:43:51.960 --> 3:43:54.720]  that everything's just gonna collapse
[3:43:54.720 --> 3:43:58.640]  well i mean it before these uh... these guys are returning from countries
[3:43:58.640 --> 3:43:59.760]  where they're eating
[3:43:59.760 --> 3:44:02.880]  basically food that courtesy of k d r
[3:44:02.880 --> 3:44:07.040]  uh... you speak to cheney halberd and uh... that all that but they're eating
[3:44:07.040 --> 3:44:09.280]  literally in crap and their food and
[3:44:09.280 --> 3:44:10.680]  the water is pictured
[3:44:10.680 --> 3:44:14.320]  i would hope that they understand who the enemy is when they come back here
[3:44:14.320 --> 3:44:16.320]  and if they're ordered to uh...
[3:44:16.320 --> 3:44:19.760]  uh... go quarantine american citizens that are quarantined
[3:44:19.760 --> 3:44:22.600]  they are quarantined the people in washington who are issuing these
[3:44:22.600 --> 3:44:26.440]  orders you've seen those kind of reports where just any good-looking woman out
[3:44:26.440 --> 3:44:28.440]  there gets basically killed
[3:44:28.440 --> 3:44:32.080]  you know i don't know how many of those cases in iraq where they were you know
[3:44:32.080 --> 3:44:35.040]  about the rule of suicide you know i put that in
[3:44:35.040 --> 3:44:37.560]  in quotation marks because uh...
[3:44:37.560 --> 3:44:40.080]  some of these people like her old head west who think
[3:44:40.080 --> 3:44:42.200]  they said he shot himself right before he was
[3:44:42.200 --> 3:44:45.680]  the political back united states the army's top ethics officer from west
[3:44:45.680 --> 3:44:47.720]  point it was actually investigating
[3:44:47.720 --> 3:44:50.200]  contractor fraud over there at the time
[3:44:50.200 --> 3:44:53.720]  uh... now his family doesn't believe for one minute he killed himself
[3:44:53.720 --> 3:44:55.240]  so uh... there's a lot of
[3:44:55.240 --> 3:44:58.040]  these so that clearly killed pat gelman
[3:44:58.040 --> 3:45:01.960]  yeah absolutely they did and and and either really either homicide
[3:45:01.960 --> 3:45:05.360]  that the military has never investigated so i think it's time
[3:45:05.360 --> 3:45:09.800]  you know for for uh... the fb i to uh... start investigating the pentagon
[3:45:09.800 --> 3:45:10.400]  here
[3:45:10.400 --> 3:45:14.240]  by the way we have the most corrupt country on earth
[3:45:14.240 --> 3:45:16.200]  well i don't know what i think
[3:45:16.200 --> 3:45:19.960]  uh... but uh... but many more corrupt countries where the system is just a
[3:45:19.960 --> 3:45:24.160]  club talkers people look at nigeria for example hillary's over there
[3:45:24.160 --> 3:45:28.600]  today uh... that don't have to clean up generally have king pens that kind of
[3:45:28.600 --> 3:45:29.880]  keep it in order though
[3:45:29.880 --> 3:45:33.520]  i mean here it's just like grabbing and stealing and raping and murdering and
[3:45:33.520 --> 3:45:36.440]  just like wild pirates or something
[3:45:36.440 --> 3:45:40.400]  absolutely i mean what it's uh... there's no but no systems are uh...
[3:45:40.400 --> 3:45:41.520]  corruption
[3:45:41.520 --> 3:45:43.880]  uh... the club talkers the uh...
[3:45:43.880 --> 3:45:47.960]  in this country and uh... yeah a lot of people uh... are stealing and killing
[3:45:47.960 --> 3:45:48.640]  and
[3:45:48.640 --> 3:45:52.160]  and uh... but you know we go around and parade around if they were
[3:45:52.160 --> 3:45:56.240]  you know where the greatest democracy on the planet which is a lot
[3:45:56.240 --> 3:45:59.280]  i i i don't know everything we have time we'll get back in the nigeria but the
[3:45:59.280 --> 3:46:01.640]  limited time we have the main reason i got you on
[3:46:01.640 --> 3:46:05.960]  i watch your uh... rush it today uh... transmission
[3:46:05.960 --> 3:46:09.400]  and i did notice that some of the usual suspects uh...
[3:46:09.400 --> 3:46:11.580]  have really been pushing the berther issue
[3:46:11.580 --> 3:46:14.840]  we just looked at it because i don't believe anything obama says
[3:46:14.840 --> 3:46:19.360]  he does have a weird very satara weird passports mom you know that you for the
[3:46:19.360 --> 3:46:21.160]  annenberg foundation and
[3:46:21.160 --> 3:46:23.680]  geithner's dad and and and all these other
[3:46:23.680 --> 3:46:26.160]  uh... the ford foundation with micro lending and
[3:46:26.160 --> 3:46:28.960]  obama with weird passports into
[3:46:28.960 --> 3:46:33.880]  pakistan right out of high school so he looks like an intelligence front
[3:46:33.880 --> 3:46:36.320]  not so much a canyon but but but
[3:46:36.320 --> 3:46:38.440]  i still look at it
[3:46:38.440 --> 3:46:40.040]  but but more and more well
[3:46:40.040 --> 3:46:44.880]  you're saying that israel's using this berther issue to menace him
[3:46:44.880 --> 3:46:46.480]  to keep him in line
[3:46:46.480 --> 3:46:47.840]  that net and yahoo
[3:46:47.840 --> 3:46:50.360]  has either picked up on this or is behind it
[3:46:50.360 --> 3:46:54.480]  what is your intel you know without naming names where you're getting the
[3:46:54.480 --> 3:46:55.960]  centel from
[3:46:55.960 --> 3:46:57.240]  well i mean i did this
[3:46:57.240 --> 3:46:59.240]  uh... issue sort of died and then
[3:46:59.240 --> 3:47:03.440]  and then when uh... obama started getting cut from the uh... settlement with
[3:47:03.440 --> 3:47:04.440]  net and yahoo
[3:47:04.440 --> 3:47:06.960]  all the feathers woman or leap out of
[3:47:06.960 --> 3:47:08.520]  california pop up
[3:47:08.520 --> 3:47:11.240]  with the defender freedom foundation of sheet
[3:47:11.240 --> 3:47:13.240]  you know she's going to be noted
[3:47:13.240 --> 3:47:15.960]  she got on television to the big media blitz
[3:47:15.960 --> 3:47:17.880]  uh... she also did
[3:47:17.880 --> 3:47:21.240]  uh... is tied up with that uh... organizations that are
[3:47:21.240 --> 3:47:25.240]  uh... link to uh... the local government and that yahoo in israel she
[3:47:25.240 --> 3:47:26.880]  she was born in marbella
[3:47:26.880 --> 3:47:29.520]  moved to israel and they came over here
[3:47:29.520 --> 3:47:33.160]  uh... and uh... uh... uh... i mean it for her
[3:47:33.160 --> 3:47:34.600]  to be questioning
[3:47:34.600 --> 3:47:36.680]  uh... that nationality
[3:47:36.680 --> 3:47:40.680]  of of uh... uh... the president i think i think somebody had to go back and
[3:47:40.680 --> 3:47:42.480]  see how she got in this country
[3:47:42.480 --> 3:47:46.600]  uh... after she makes a big allegations two days later she popped up

[3:47:47.880 --> 3:47:49.240]  uh... on television
[3:47:49.240 --> 3:47:53.320]  now you know she's the benefit of the state birth certificate
[3:47:53.320 --> 3:47:56.920]  in a lawsuit maybe she realizes that they get so many much that that even though
[3:47:56.920 --> 3:47:58.440]  she's a lawyer she got her
[3:47:58.440 --> 3:48:00.640]  law degree apparently from some uh...
[3:48:00.640 --> 3:48:03.560]  some uh... online internet university
[3:48:03.560 --> 3:48:07.040]  uh... but maybe somebody packed on the shoulder of real lawyer that you know
[3:48:07.040 --> 3:48:08.840]  it's a it's a felony to submit
[3:48:08.840 --> 3:48:10.800]  i'm not for three
[3:48:10.800 --> 3:48:12.000]  federal court
[3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:16.960]  soclie yeah but couldn't usually all so can israel also be putting a fake mother
[3:48:16.960 --> 3:48:21.840]  county business credit things coming up and we won't look back they had your
[3:48:21.840 --> 3:48:21.660]  favorite amin
[3:48:21.660 --> 3:48:24.440]  completly uh...
[3:48:24.440 --> 3:48:26.160]  record punching over those
[3:48:26.160 --> 3:48:30.880] you might you really take uh... documents uh... they had your finger press along
[3:48:30.880 --> 3:48:35.640]  uh... beat-up the uh... iraqi or ministry document to show
[3:48:35.640 --> 3:48:36.920]  upload melodies
[3:48:36.920 --> 3:48:38.960]  they want politicians around if
[3:48:38.960 --> 3:48:44.700]  world-wide money from Saddam Hussein. These were all forgeries. And yes, Israel specializes
[3:48:44.700 --> 3:48:50.500]  in forgeries because, remember, the motto of the Mossad is, through deception, they'll
[3:48:50.500 --> 3:48:55.180]  shout wage war. So that's just another method that they use.
[3:48:55.180 --> 3:49:02.380]  By way of deception, we shall wage war. The other thing is, you've got the IDF soldier
[3:49:02.380 --> 3:49:07.340]  and clearly, not even just a dual citizen, and pretty much, I would say he's an Israeli,
[3:49:07.340 --> 3:49:12.100]  the White House Chief of Staff, you know, the true joker here, Rahm Emanuel, and his
[3:49:12.100 --> 3:49:20.360]  Dr. Death Eugenics brother. I mean, what a crew. I mean, this is just getting crazier
[3:49:20.360 --> 3:49:26.900]  and crazier. And so you're saying Netanyahu may be leaking this. I would see it just as
[3:49:26.900 --> 3:49:31.420]  probable that they put out the fake birth certificate to discredit it. I mean, why would
[3:49:31.420 --> 3:49:35.340]  Israel want to get rid of Obama when he's been going along with pretty much everything
[3:49:35.340 --> 3:49:38.940]  they want? Well, Obama actually had it. There's thought
[3:49:38.940 --> 3:49:45.740]  that there is a feud between Emanuel and Netanyahu over the settlement issue. But, you know,
[3:49:45.740 --> 3:49:49.980]  the leaked Israeli ambassador to Washington thing in the Washington Post, yeah.
[3:49:49.980 --> 3:49:55.100]  Right. The Congress General in Boston, yeah, I said that they were discerning relations.
[3:49:55.100 --> 3:50:01.540]  I mean, and then, seeing rabbis and handcuffs in New York and New Jersey, I mean, obviously,
[3:50:01.540 --> 3:50:06.420]  there's a feeling that the federal government is getting, the federal government is getting
[3:50:06.420 --> 3:50:09.740]  prepped with the Israelis. And then all of a sudden, this birth certificate thing pops
[3:50:09.740 --> 3:50:16.420]  up. So, you know, Netanyahu, you know, is close to this woman, Orly Tate, who was the
[3:50:16.420 --> 3:50:21.620]  head of this, the most recent operation on the birth certificate. I would also point
[3:50:21.620 --> 3:50:24.020]  out. So, you think Obama really is a few degrees
[3:50:24.020 --> 3:50:28.100]  tougher on Israel than Bush? Oh, I believe, I believe he is. I mean,
[3:50:28.100 --> 3:50:36.100]  you never saw, you know, basically, this rabbi network was supporting the Shops party, which
[3:50:36.100 --> 3:50:42.260]  is a key member of Netanyahu's coalition government. So, these guys are being let out of the handcuffs.
[3:50:42.260 --> 3:50:46.420]  Oh, you think that's Obama's people saying, we can blackmail you too?
[3:50:46.420 --> 3:50:52.180]  Oh, we can, yeah. Our Justice Department can go after your money sources over here. And
[3:50:52.180 --> 3:50:55.380]  in that case, they did. Wayne, tell us more about that in the final
[3:50:55.380 --> 3:50:58.180]  segment. Straight ahead, WayneMatsonReport.com.
[3:51:26.180 --> 3:51:30.260]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[3:51:30.260 --> 3:51:34.740]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[3:51:34.740 --> 3:51:39.860]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your
[3:51:39.860 --> 3:51:45.620]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want all you can get? I'm Alex Jones.
[3:51:45.620 --> 3:51:53.460]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
[3:51:53.460 --> 3:52:00.180]  out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:52:01.780 --> 3:52:07.620]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:07.620 --> 3:52:12.260]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful,
[3:52:12.260 --> 3:52:19.140]  just as strong, just as well-funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama
[3:52:19.140 --> 3:52:28.340]  is working for the best interests of the American people. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical
[3:52:28.340 --> 3:52:34.900]  mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers
[3:52:34.900 --> 3:52:41.380]  and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:52:41.380 --> 3:52:47.700]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:55:22.020 --> 3:55:26.740]  atmospheric water generator that then sends it through seven filters, and it's all computerized
[3:55:26.740 --> 3:55:31.780]  and nice and easy to use, grabs the water out of the air, condenses it in an eliminated stainless
[3:55:31.780 --> 3:55:36.980]  steel tank with anti-fungal, anti-UV, grabs it right out of the air. They even sell solar panels
[3:55:36.980 --> 3:55:40.180]  that go with it. If you don't want to plug it into the wall, I want to be off the grid.
[3:55:40.180 --> 3:55:51.300]  AcolaBlue.com. AcolaBlue.com. E-C-O-L-O-Blue.com or 800-69-1-6043-800-69-1-6043. AcolaBlue.com.

[3:56:30.180 --> 3:56:35.860]  MySolarBackup.com, 877-327-0365. All right. In the last three minutes, you got the floor
[3:56:35.860 --> 3:56:42.260]  finishing up, Wayne, with the Israeli situation. And you, do you have sources or are you just
[3:56:42.820 --> 3:56:47.860]  saying you believe that this rabbi thing with the organs and the money in New Jersey,
[3:56:47.860 --> 3:56:54.500]  just black hole, go ahead. No, I have people in the U.S. intelligence community contact me.
[3:56:54.500 --> 3:57:00.260]  Look, this is not a coincidence. This is how the administration is sending a signal back
[3:57:00.260 --> 3:57:06.900]  to Netanyahu, who is basically from the know that, you know, our request for end of freeze
[3:57:06.900 --> 3:57:15.060]  settlements. And I think, you know, we could probably play tougher. I would like to see more
[3:57:15.060 --> 3:57:20.260]  done, but I think they're going as far, probably, as we're going to see. Maybe they can go a little
[3:57:20.260 --> 3:57:27.700]  bit farther, but I really think the, what we may see when I'm hearing, too, is that now that
[3:57:27.700 --> 3:57:33.780]  Netanyahu has been linked to this personal attack on President Obama, we may see somebody
[3:57:33.780 --> 3:57:39.140]  start digging up some stuff on Netanyahu's past, especially when he lived in the Philadelphia area.
[3:57:39.860 --> 3:57:46.580]  I'm hearing rumors that he, his past there may leave a lot to be desired among some of the
[3:57:46.580 --> 3:57:55.060]  more religious elements that support him in Israel. Oh, you mean a type of stuff that goes on
[3:57:55.060 --> 3:58:00.500]  in the Republicans? Maybe, maybe spend a little too much time on written house square in downtown
[3:58:00.500 --> 3:58:05.300]  Philly. Anyone who's familiar with that area knows that that's, uh, how should I put it?
[3:58:05.300 --> 3:58:13.140]  A rather bohemian next neighborhood. You mean a bohemian grove type stuff? Yeah, maybe.
[3:58:14.100 --> 3:58:18.740]  Maybe. Okay. Wayne Madsen, always informative, WayneMadsenReport.com.
[3:58:18.740 --> 3:58:23.220]  Thank you for popping in and spending time with us today. I really appreciate it. Good to be with

[3:58:30.420 --> 3:58:35.620]  We'll post the video of this live radio show up at prisonplanet.tv from the live transmission.
[3:58:35.620 --> 3:58:40.260]  Great job, crew. Retransmission starts now. Spread the word and don't take the flu shot.
[3:58:43.140 --> 3:58:48.660]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:48.660 --> 3:58:56.100]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this
[3:58:56.100 --> 3:59:00.820]  summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number
[3:59:00.820 --> 3:59:06.420]  two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[3:59:06.420 --> 3:59:11.460]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:59:11.460 --> 3:59:15.780]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:59:15.780 --> 3:59:19.860]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[3:59:19.860 --> 3:59:24.020]  summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[3:59:24.020 --> 3:59:29.140]  weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[3:59:29.140 --> 3:59:34.100]  peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:59:34.100 --> 3:59:40.660]  a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's
