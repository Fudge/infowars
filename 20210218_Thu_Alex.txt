[00:00.000 --> 00:12.720]  My friends, we are kicking off another emergency transmission.
[00:12.720 --> 00:20.600]  February 18th, 2021, I have come into a lot of key information and ideas to take on the
[00:20.600 --> 00:23.320]  globalist in the last 24 hours.
[00:23.320 --> 00:27.240]  You also understand the enemy's next steps and exactly what they're planning to fully
[00:27.240 --> 00:29.760]  bankrupt the U.S. and kill the dollar, but we can stop them.
[00:29.760 --> 00:32.600]  But you've got to take action.
[00:32.600 --> 00:33.880]  We'll talk about it on the other side.
[00:33.880 --> 00:38.600]  But first, we went to the private regulator that's globalist, that's out of state, run
[00:38.600 --> 00:43.960]  by Democrats, ERCOT, that has sabotaged the Texas power grid on purpose for a federal
[00:43.960 --> 00:47.760]  Joe Biden takeover of the Texas grid and more windmills.
[00:47.760 --> 00:51.440]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we have got all that information as well.
[00:51.440 --> 00:53.840]  I went over to their offices in South Austin yesterday.
[00:53.840 --> 00:59.200]  We're planning a demonstration there on Saturday after we go to the governor's mansion.
[00:59.200 --> 01:03.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've now announced that the power will be out for a month off
[01:03.120 --> 01:07.560]  and on rolling blackouts training us to no longer have any power and they're boosting
[01:07.560 --> 01:10.160]  prices as much as 10,000 percent.
[01:10.160 --> 01:11.160]  That is Reuters.
[01:11.160 --> 01:12.160]  I'm not joking.
[01:12.160 --> 01:14.000]  They're following the Enron criminal model.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  Here's part of the report that's at Band-Aught Video.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  Texas protest, ERCOT Enron power scam.
[01:19.000 --> 01:33.000]  ERCOT is Enron, ERCOT is Enron, you are criminals, shutting off our power.
[01:33.000 --> 01:41.000]  We know you, Rickson, the whistleblowers are coming forward, Texas has plenty of power.
[01:41.000 --> 01:50.000]  And take more Reuters reports, power prices on the open market up 10,000 percent as you
[01:50.000 --> 01:51.000]  halt the state hostage.
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  So outside power groups like Vultures, like Enron did, can beat on us.
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  You thought because it's been 20 years since Enron did this to the West Coast, you would
[02:01.000 --> 02:02.000]  get away with this.
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.000]  You are not getting away with it, you criminal.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  That's what's coming up.
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.000]  This Saturday we're going to protest the big tech, great recent, Democrat, Paul, Greg
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.000]  Hammond, Ed Dune, that's the governor's mansion.
[02:17.000 --> 02:18.000]  He's essential.
[02:18.000 --> 02:19.000]  He's got power.
[02:19.000 --> 02:30.000]  And there at 2 p.m., we're coming out here on 290 towards the airport at 7 p.m. to 0
[02:30.000 --> 02:38.000]  p.m. to protest the criminals that run ERCOT and run this scam.
[02:38.000 --> 02:45.000]  I will see all human detections that want this great recent power come off, just like
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  cutting off the keystone pipeline.
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  We know they've done it before, they've been caught, and now the whistleblowers are set
[02:52.000 --> 02:53.000]  to go public.
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  That's why they put this public woman in right before they get it, because the people actually
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  don't want to go to prison.
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  They want to set her up like Cuomo, but she's part of the two.
[03:05.000 --> 03:14.000]  You're all going to prison.
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  This is serious, folks.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  This is war.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  They're shutting our energy systems off by design.
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  They know what they're doing.
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.000]  They're trying to crash.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  They think you're so stupid to figure it out.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  Figure it out or be overrun and starved to death.
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  They're about to kill the U.S. dollar.
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  They're signaling worldwide that the U.S. is over.
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  So at least once they crash the economy, remember who did this to you.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.000]  Remember.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.000]  This is war, people.
[03:43.000 --> 03:44.000]  This isn't a joke.
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  Notice the globalist criminals.
[03:47.000 --> 03:53.000]  ERCOT chairwoman Sally, the Democrat, told her, and their other globalist accomplices.
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  Muslim lawyers inside the organization, as well as the EPA and Texas government, are
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  prepared to come forward and expose your giant, in wrong style scam.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  You're hearing my word.
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  By we the people, to cease and desist your stage blackout designed to condition Americans
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  to accept the great reset and the carbon credit rationing.
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.000]  Justice Governor Cuomo will be sent to prison for his crimes against humanity.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  You will be held accountable.
[04:22.000 --> 04:23.000]  One last time.
[04:23.000 --> 04:29.000]  We are aware of your criminal enterprise to trick the public into accepting smart meter
[04:29.000 --> 04:35.000]  monitoring of thermostats and to jack up power prices as much as 10,000 percent.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  Stop your criminal activity now.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  We the people that are watching all the shows.
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  And now because he's in there, that's the security guy.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  The security guy star we saw a minute earlier.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  Now he's doing that for the best of us.
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.000]  We're standing for hours.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  So, hell, get the address.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  We're moving in.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  Stay with us.
[04:58.000 --> 05:02.000]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[05:02.000 --> 05:04.000]  America is about to have its energy cut off.
[05:04.000 --> 05:06.000]  Its borders destroyed.
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  Its dollar brought down to nothing.
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are the right team.
[05:14.000 --> 05:17.000]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[05:17.000 --> 05:24.000]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  The enemy can't help itself.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it.
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.000]  We should.
[05:38.000 --> 05:44.000]  But once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.000]  attacking us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[05:51.000 --> 05:54.000]  You're going under judge by just like all the children that were aborted.
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  This is the truth.
[05:56.000 --> 06:25.000]  This is the InfoWater.
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  A lot of negative bad things have happened.
[06:29.000 --> 06:34.000]  And we've been honest about those and we've been accurate about those so that we can stand
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  up against it and stop it.
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.000]  But there's also a lot of really positive things going on and really good things happening
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  that I haven't spent enough time telling you about.
[06:44.000 --> 06:50.000]  And there's also not enough of us on this broadcast particularly that's so influential
[06:50.000 --> 06:56.000]  putting out original ideas and battle plans that are peaceful, truthful, and effective
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  to stop this takeover that is taking place.
[06:59.000 --> 07:06.000]  But the good news is mainline conservatives, mainline nationalists, mainline Americans
[07:06.000 --> 07:14.000]  across the board are understanding what's really happening and that this is a corporate
[07:14.000 --> 07:25.000]  crisis system, a crisis capitalist system where it's not free market but where technocrats
[07:25.000 --> 07:35.000]  use their AI control and use their instrumentation that dials into every basically modern machine
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  to manipulate economies to consolidate power and control.
[07:39.000 --> 07:45.000]  And to really destroy civilization through that vertical integration.
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.000]  So we're laying that out today.
[07:47.000 --> 07:50.000]  This is just such a teachable moment for all of us.
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  All the different things that are unfolding.
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.000]  Biden and the bills that are introduced that he says he'll sign to register all guns and ban all
[07:57.000 --> 08:03.000]  semi-autos and all magazines up to over 10 rounds.
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.000]  Openly saying the border is wide open and no one coming in will be tested for COVID or
[08:07.000 --> 08:11.000]  any other disease but citizens will have to be tested to go to the movie theater or have
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  a job, internal checkpoints.
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.000]  The really huge news is Tucker Carlson is now really understanding how serious things are.
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  The Democrats have hired former General Honor Ray who is a leftist, globalist, anti-American
[08:23.000 --> 08:29.000]  communist and also an anti-white racist, just a monstrous person.
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  General Honor Ray wants to go to war with the American people.
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.000]  He wants the CIA and the U.S. Army to hunt down and wage war on us.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  So absolutely criminal.
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  And Tucker Carlson an excellent job last night laying that out.
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  Also, I have talked to people very close to the president and they told me last week that
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  Trump is preparing to really go on the offense again.
[08:53.000 --> 08:59.000]  You're starting to see that happen here in just the last few days.
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  And some very exciting things there.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  Trump now does know that they ordered half the police to stand down at the Capitol.
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  They do know that the Democrats bragged in the Time Magazine article that they had provocateurs
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  in there and intended to try to incite the giant Trump crowd to do it and that they
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  had their leftist basically disguised.
[09:19.000 --> 09:27.000]  That is all starting to come out and General Honor Ray day one and day two said that the
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.000]  sergeant of arms and the Capitol police are terrorists with no evidence and that they
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  were planning to kill everybody inside.
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  When he knows damn well their Q operators were the ones manipulating the few hundred that
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  actually went in and that indeed Trump had no idea it was happening.
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.000]  But the Democrats basically helped orchestrate the whole thing and had FBI agents inside
[09:50.000 --> 10:00.000]  the Proud Boys and inside of the Oath Keepers and inside with the Antifa actually directing
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  the first breach.
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.000]  Then the Q-tards went inside and stayed within the Velvet Ropes and they're all of course
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  having the book thrown at them.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  And I told you all of this at the time that the young Antifa commander was probably being
[10:16.000 --> 10:21.000]  funded and see if the archivist can find this I said this on the seventh, eighth, ninth
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  and tenth of January.
[10:23.000 --> 10:30.000]  I said I believe CNN is funding and commanding the black Antifa leader.
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.000]  Well it turns out he was given seventy thousand dollars by CNN and another unit and they did
[10:35.000 --> 10:42.000]  have embedded CNN reporter with them and more.
[10:42.000 --> 10:49.000]  I mean I know spies when I look at them and I could just take one look at him on Anderson
[10:49.000 --> 10:55.000]  Cooper and all the rest of it and knew instantly what was going on but that is now coming out
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  in the mainstream news.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  It was on M4s over the weekend but now it's in the big law enforcement publications that
[11:00.000 --> 11:07.000]  there were FBI agents leading and commanding, FBI commanders, leading and commanding all
[11:07.000 --> 11:08.000]  three of the groups.
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.000]  That's why they had to arrest Enrique Tarrio at the airport.
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  They now admit was to stop him leading the group because he wouldn't have been violent.
[11:17.000 --> 11:25.000]  But instead, ladies and gentlemen, these guys absolutely set us up and it was criminal operation.
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.000]  And so Trump is codifying the information, he's getting it together and preparing to
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  go public and Trump is going to have his own conference, his own symposium, his own trial
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  because as soon as they learned that Trump knew all of this and Lindsey Graham was going
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.000]  to bring witnesses that Pelosi ordered to stand down the day before and ordered the intelligence
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  briefing not be given to the rest of Congress.
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.000]  The minute that happened, they stopped last Saturday that we've been overshadowed by the
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  snowstorm and the power outages.
[11:54.000 --> 12:01.000]  They ended the trial a week early and said no witnesses because they had had their whole
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  system called on them.
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  And so I'm going to break all this down.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  That's why Honorary came out on the 6th and 7th and said the sergeant of arms and the
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000]  police are terrorists, they're white and they're Trump supporters and you cannot trust the
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000]  police and military and I will help lead a purge of the military and I will help lead
[12:19.000 --> 12:29.000]  a purge of the police just outrageously insane and that oh, Trump and the Republicans and
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  Jones and Ali Alexander, they were all in the Capitol and planned the attack but they
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  before were given a tour.
[12:35.000 --> 12:44.000]  They would then show video from November with us peacefully with Vernon Jones in the Georgia
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  Capitol.
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.000]  And then because some of the Republicans that spoke at the event with the president had
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  been at the Capitol days before obviously talking to representatives, they called that a criminal
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  conspiracy because they were in a criminal conspiracy.
[12:56.000 --> 12:59.000]  Because in fact, print me the Time Magazine article from two weeks ago place where they
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  bragged that they knew we were coming.
[13:01.000 --> 13:06.000]  They had their people stand down, poses our people and just hope for fireworks.
[13:06.000 --> 13:13.000]  Kind of like they did in Virginia with Charlottesville where they just put two explosive groups together.
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  Well, this time they just infiltrated.
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  That the police stand down.
[13:18.000 --> 13:24.000]  Had anti thought professor type trained agitators average age about 60 directing people from
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.000]  the parapets from the area to attack, attack, attack.
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  In fact, witnesses are on record saying they were and it's on audio saying attack.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  Alex Jones says attack.
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  Take it.
[13:35.000 --> 13:36.000]  It's yours.
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.000]  Trump's coming.
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.000]  Take it.
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]  Take it.
[13:39.000 --> 13:40.000]  Take it.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  And the Q people had all been told that online by HN and the globalist operatives.
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  They believe they were talking to Trump.
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  They were talking to obviously Biden and the Chicombs.
[13:46.000 --> 13:52.000]  And so they hit and they broke through the police who were not part of it.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  And the police were absolutely overwhelmed and it was terrible what happened to them.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  That's just the facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  The system wants to play us off against each other.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  Here's an example.
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  The power has been out in many parts of Austin going on day six.
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  And it was a lot more homes than they said it was the most the city and people know it was done by design and folks understand that.
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  I'm going to lay all that evidence out today as well.
[14:17.000 --> 14:24.000]  But it's true, people went up and have been harassing utility workers and getting in their faces and blaming them and cussing them out.
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  They're hardworking people with tough jobs that are very dangerous.
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  Utility workers have a very dangerous job just as tough as a police officer or firefighter.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  In some cases even tougher.
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.000]  So people need to even bring them some coffee or a donut or something.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  They've got their family stuck at home most of them without power as well.
[14:42.000 --> 14:49.000]  But the media gets to focus on the few, you know, idiots that are being mean to the utility workers in Texas.
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  When the real anger should be directed at the governor that let the windmills in and got all the awards from the left.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  Greg Abbott and from ERCOT that's run by a bunch of Democrats.
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  All the whole board is Democrat.
[15:01.000 --> 15:08.000]  Five of the board don't live in Texas and one of them was works for governor Whitmer in Michigan.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  Talk about double dipping.
[15:10.000 --> 15:17.000]  And I have family and I know folks that work at power plants and they've been ordered to power those plants down in the last few months by ERCOT.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  So they can embarrass Texas.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  They already shut down over 100 of our plants before that.
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  Most of Austin is off the damn windmills now.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  That's why Austin's worst hit the state.
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.000]  The whole left did this but now I have hundreds of articles, literally hundreds in front of me.
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  New York Times, you name it saying.
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.000]  Texas is over.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  Texas is idiots.
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  It shows Texas is an energy state.
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  Texas can't take care of itself.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  Texas can't find its ass with both hands.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  And we need to come in with green energy and take over Texas and Biden's pledging to do it.
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  This is technocratic sabotage 101.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  We told you last week that they'd be having shut down to the power.
[15:51.000 --> 15:56.000]  Now they say it'll be off and on for a month and they're jacking up the prices.
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee.
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  I just love it.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  I can't get enough of it.
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  We've got a fresh brew right now.
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  That's what fills my mug.
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  That's what fills my belly.
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.000]  That's what fills my soul.
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  Folks, we have had this coffee for years at InfowarsStore.com.
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.000]  Years.
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  Never raised the price.
[16:19.000 --> 16:20.000]  Never.
[16:20.000 --> 16:21.000]  The Wake Up America Blend.
[16:21.000 --> 16:22.000]  The best coffee.
[16:22.000 --> 16:23.000]  The crew here loves it.
[16:23.000 --> 16:24.000]  We drink it every day.
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  And of course that's just one of the great ways you can support Infowars here.
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.000]  Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody.
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  Why not support Infowars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America Patriot Blend.
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  Of course, read all the great reviews.
[16:38.000 --> 16:39.000]  Pretty much perfect review there.
[16:39.000 --> 16:40.000]  4.9 star.
[16:40.000 --> 16:46.000]  When you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gives it 5 stars.
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.000]  So I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody who gives it 5 stars.
[16:49.000 --> 16:50.000]  That may be one or two people.
[16:50.000 --> 16:56.000]  Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee only available at InfowarsStore.com.
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.000]  I sell supplements for two reasons.
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  Because they work.
[17:01.000 --> 17:02.000]  They're real.
[17:02.000 --> 17:03.000]  They're powerful.
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  And because it's a giant market.
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  But again, why is there a giant market?
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  Because it works.
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  That's why it exponentially grows.
[17:11.000 --> 17:31.000]  So whether it's Saupon Meadow and other key ingredients in our prostate formula, prostagard, or whether it is the super high grade organic vitamin B12 and ultra 12, or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA force, or the pure Deep Earth crystal iodine on an X2.
[17:31.000 --> 17:39.000]  These are all the very best supplements you're going to find in an already great market of high quality products out there.
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  And it funds the Infowar.
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're finding the Infowars you can't lose.
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  Infowars delivers in spades.
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.000]  Please visit InfowarsStore.com and get the products today.
[17:51.000 --> 18:20.000]  And again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at InfowarsStore.com.
[18:20.000 --> 18:33.000]  The bad news is, the new world order is here and it's taken over and it's going to do horrible, horrible things before it finally runs to the ground.
[18:33.000 --> 18:40.000]  Good news, though.
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  We have not been caught completely flat footed.
[18:44.000 --> 18:57.000]  We have a very serious cadre of human beings from a race, color, and creed across this planet that are aware of the entire new world order system and who know how to stop it and who know what it's going to do next.
[18:57.000 --> 19:10.000]  So as they engineer the collapse of civilization, as they engineer the collapse of the family, as they engineer the collapse of our genetics, it will become completely apparent to everyone that they've been caught in a trap.
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.000]  And that the Debo's group, the UN, the globalist Bill Gates are their mortal enemy.
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.000]  Bill Gates is the most unpopular person on planet Earth.
[19:20.000 --> 19:29.000]  He's come out as our master, our king, our ruler. Everybody knows he's called for depopulations. Everybody knows he's been thrown out of 30 plus countries, killing people, obtaining vaccines on purpose.
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.000]  Everybody knows he's a Joseph Mingola on steroids.
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.000]  So is his father and his mother and his horrible pig like wife and family.
[19:37.000 --> 19:44.000]  They're all very bad people. The children are now adult, running their evil eugenics mounds, shooting their mouths off about getting rid of the useless eaters.
[19:44.000 --> 19:49.000]  And I say they should go first. I'm not going to do anything violent. I'm just saying there's too many people, Bill Gates.
[19:49.000 --> 19:53.000]  Blow your head off then, buddy. Show us how it's done.
[19:53.000 --> 20:01.000]  Walk out the town square, walk up on a gallows, kick the switch and, you know, break your own neck there, pal. Then I'll start respecting you and listening to you.
[20:01.000 --> 20:07.000]  But you get to have kids, you get to have jets, you get to have all the money, but you tell us we are not essential.
[20:07.000 --> 20:14.000]  No, that's a declaration of war, you little bastard and that stupid pink shirt.
[20:14.000 --> 20:18.000]  So let me lay this out for you.
[20:18.000 --> 20:25.000]  The good news is, we're not going quietly into the good night.
[20:25.000 --> 20:40.000]  And so Gates is kind of laying low for about six months and now there's giant PR pushes in every major magazine, every major TV network, comedy shows, drama programs, movies, documentaries, news programs, you know, Wired Magazine.
[20:40.000 --> 20:49.000]  Gotta show the cover. Bill Gates, the man to save the world, but will we listen to him and do what the scammer said?
[20:49.000 --> 21:02.000]  He was one of the most hated people in the 90s and now he spends billions on PR and with him is the whole train of eugenics and globalism and synthetic meat and eating bugs and freezing the death of the winner and having no energy.
[21:02.000 --> 21:09.000]  Because it's so chic.
[21:09.000 --> 21:16.000]  And he publicly underwrites these programs where he's the hero. He's the hero.
[21:16.000 --> 21:23.000]  Now that's an old cover, guys. Just type this in. It was an article in Info Wars on Tuesday. I've really been wanting to show it to people.
[21:23.000 --> 21:28.000]  And the exact headline was Bill Gates, the man to save the world.
[21:28.000 --> 21:42.000]  Just type in Bill Gates Wired Magazine cover and it's a huge media push. He's everywhere saying, oh, we're going to have to have climate shutdowns, climate lockdowns and all of this.
[21:42.000 --> 21:54.000]  And then, oh, COVID taught us to stay in our houses and telecommute and COVID taught us that we're not going to be able to have an economy anymore.
[21:54.000 --> 21:59.000]  Oh, but he gets even richer. He gets even more powerful.
[21:59.000 --> 22:02.000]  I'll pull it up on my phone.
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  No big deal. I'll pull it up because I've got to have the article with him on the cover of the deal.
[22:06.000 --> 22:14.000]  This is the savior of the earth. I'll do it. Go through these for you and I will pull that up.
[22:14.000 --> 22:20.000]  There it is. Overhead shot, please. There it is. Boom. Bill Gates.
[22:20.000 --> 22:34.000]  Plan to save the world. We can reach zero carbon. Here's how. Zero carbon. We're based on carbon. Plants breathe carbon.
[22:34.000 --> 22:41.000]  The whole planet's covered in carbon. It's how we've got so much of it under the ground because there's been so much of it on the surface.
[22:41.000 --> 22:47.000]  We're a carbon-based life form.
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  Imagine if aliens landed and they said, we want you to give up your carbon-based life form status.
[22:52.000 --> 23:01.000]  Do as we say. We will allow you to live a short period of time. We are going to begin changing your DNA. This is your ruler. His name is Bill Gates.
[23:01.000 --> 23:09.000]  Do what he says. Let me see who Bill Gates is. He wants to kill everybody. He wants to get rid of old people and says we're overpopulated.
[23:09.000 --> 23:15.000]  You can actually make the argument that there are a bunch of people that just watch TV all day and lay around.
[23:15.000 --> 23:20.000]  There are people starving all over the world and there's a lot of problems on the planet.
[23:20.000 --> 23:34.000]  Let's be honest that Bill Gates is a psychotic and that Bill Gates's group is the group that just 70, 80 years ago was funding Adolf Alois Hitler on record.
[23:34.000 --> 23:44.000]  The same names, the same people. Cold Springs Harbor, Warren Buffett, all of them. These are super villains.
[23:44.000 --> 23:50.000]  And he wants to control your body. He wants to control your reproduction. He wants to control your energy.
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.000]  And I've got all the articles right here where he says he's going to run your life along with Klaus Schwab.
[23:55.000 --> 24:01.000]  Klaus Schwab is in Europe saying he's going to run Europe and Asia. Gigi Payne's going to run China.
[24:01.000 --> 24:10.000]  And Bill Gates is going to run America and Europe as well. I mean Bill Gates is again now the shadow head of the G8 this year.
[24:10.000 --> 24:18.000]  That's not normal to have them announcing that, oh, I take my orders. Boris Johnson said, I'm ahead of the G8 this year on the rotating seat from Bill Gates.
[24:18.000 --> 24:24.000]  And I've got hundreds of articles and hundreds of video clips to play. Why do I just keep saying that every hour the last few days?
[24:24.000 --> 24:33.000]  Because when they tell you on the news that Bill Gates heads up the G8, you're in a technocracy, a dictatorship of technocrats.
[24:33.000 --> 24:45.000]  Bloomberg has articles out saying we need a world dictatorship of technocrats where they tell you what to eat, how to sleep, where you can go, who you can marry, if you can marry, if you can have kids, all of this.
[24:45.000 --> 24:54.000]  And China has been the model. And how big your house is going to be. That's why it's, oh, sexy little tiny houses.
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.000]  And oh, now you live in a van by the river. It's so chic because you can't have kids like that living in a van.
[25:00.000 --> 25:08.000]  You can't have the American dream. You can't continue on. And then they're going to cut off the power and not going to let you be by the river.
[25:08.000 --> 25:15.000]  They're saying, oh, don't worry. You can't afford an apartment. Don't worry. You can't afford a house. Don't worry. It's, you know, Time Magazine, New York Times.
[25:15.000 --> 25:22.000]  You got a Whole Foods and they have huge sections of how chic it is to be poor and how chic it is to have nothing.
[25:22.000 --> 25:31.000]  And you'll see these young, rich, trust fund kids, you know, with the trendy, you know, sexy, good-looking guy with a sexy, good-looking girlfriend.
[25:31.000 --> 25:38.000]  And they're all in the back of the Volkswagen van. And oh, they've got a baby. And then you learn the guy's got $50 million in the bank.
[25:38.000 --> 25:48.000]  And it's all just sick, sick, crazy people that do whatever they're told by the New York LA scene to act like. And they're the schmucks of the planet.
[25:48.000 --> 25:59.000]  We are all led by a bunch of twisted, decadent, crazy, rich people whose only pleasure now is making you be poor and you austere and you have nothing,
[25:59.000 --> 26:06.000]  which, by the way, was the number one world system for all of human development through feudalism in the last 10,000 years.
[26:06.000 --> 26:13.000]  Every time it's set up where royalty had all the food and all the money and all the power, they kept you super poor and starving
[26:13.000 --> 26:19.000]  so that you couldn't get up and you were so busy trying to get food that you would never stand against them.
[26:19.000 --> 26:26.000]  They always called, whether it was Japan or whether it was ancient England or ancient France or Rome, they would always call the peasants the little people
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.000]  because usually the nobles were a foot or two taller from generation to generation of a big diet.
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  Even the ruling class in China are all big, tall, six foot, two guys. Everybody else is like five feet tall.
[26:37.000 --> 26:44.000]  Because you don't get food. It's their control. You will own nothing. You will have nothing and you will like it.
[26:44.000 --> 26:54.000]  Haha, so liberal. We'll be right back on the other side with General Honoré and the Democrats' plans publicly to send the army to your house to kill you and your family.
[26:54.000 --> 27:00.000]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two.
[27:00.000 --> 27:12.000]  One is born of remissance. The other is born of conquest. One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[27:12.000 --> 27:18.000]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[27:18.000 --> 27:26.000]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[27:26.000 --> 27:34.000]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't. They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[27:34.000 --> 27:42.000]  A global permanent lockdown is here. It is already causing millions and millions of starved deaths. When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[27:42.000 --> 27:50.000]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  That's the facts. This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[27:53.000 --> 28:03.000]  I knew Trump was in battle. I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double-talking agents of the enemy.
[28:03.000 --> 28:09.000]  A lot of people just couldn't believe it. They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[28:09.000 --> 28:15.000]  And I understand why people learn to believe that because this is scary what's going on with the global government and the New World Order.
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.000]  Now that people have come up with the facts that's real, they want somebody to come save them from.
[28:19.000 --> 28:28.000]  Well, Trump sure has held track. My gosh, let's get out. Prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled depending on the drug once Biden signed that executive order.
[28:28.000 --> 28:33.000]  We pay the most of anybody in the world. That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed.
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  And now people are going to feel the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything else.
[28:37.000 --> 28:45.000]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election
[28:45.000 --> 28:51.000]  and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in, folks. The swamp is deep.
[28:51.000 --> 29:19.000]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[29:19.000 --> 29:29.000]  This mouthwash only uses the best natural ingredients like real peppermint oil, thyme oil, xylitol and of course high quality charcoal.
[29:29.000 --> 29:41.000]  Not only fluoride free, this mouthwash is completely free of other dangerous ingredients such as SLS, harsh detergents, BPA and so much more.
[29:41.000 --> 29:57.000]  As soon as you use it, you can tell that this formula is the real deal, so get your bottle of the new activated charcoal mouthwash right now at infowarstore.com.
[29:57.000 --> 30:21.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[30:21.000 --> 30:27.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[30:27.000 --> 30:35.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[30:35.000 --> 30:52.000]  Now, I said back in November when Biden began stealing the election that the first thing he'd do when he got in was start a purge of the U.S. military calling anyone that's pro-America or anyone that's pro-gun, anyone that has any post promoting come and take it,
[30:52.000 --> 30:59.000]  or Donald Trump or Alex Jones or George Washington for that matter as being a terrorist and a white supremist.
[30:59.000 --> 31:10.000]  And you saw exactly that start. And they've got the 30,000 National Guards still in D.C. to be harassed, vetted, infiltrated, spied on, messed with.
[31:10.000 --> 31:22.000]  I'm told from sources it's had the exact opposite effect. The military was somewhat awake to the globalists, but the last few months in D.C. has the National Guard really, really getting hardcore.
[31:22.000 --> 31:32.000]  So that's the thing about these communists is they've done this in China, they've done this in Russia, they've done this in other places where people never really had a history of freedom.
[31:32.000 --> 31:42.000]  Americans may be spoiled, we may have problems, but we've had a history of freedom and we have a memory of freedom and so the National Guard is really getting turned off against what's happening.
[31:42.000 --> 31:51.000]  They're having a litmus test of will you fire on Americans, you'll give their terrorist quote, that's whoever they say is a terrorist.
[31:51.000 --> 31:57.000]  And so Tucker Carlson is now really hammering on this, but I thought I would get to part of his report.
[31:57.000 --> 32:08.000]  And then I would walk through what's really going on and what they're planning next because we're in the house of the false flag, we're in that mode.
[32:08.000 --> 32:14.000]  We're in the planet of the false flag, we're in the realm, we're in the age, that is their next big move.
[32:14.000 --> 32:22.000]  They're also going to economically squeeze us through power grids, that's what they always do other places, and they're also going to squeeze us through the educational system.
[32:22.000 --> 32:32.000]  Our jobs are going to tighten down the restrictions, loosen them by the summer and then release new strains immediately that aren't even as bad as the current strain.
[32:32.000 --> 32:37.000]  They'll say they're worse, fear monger and then clamp down even stronger.
[32:37.000 --> 32:44.000]  That's what they've done in Italy, it's what they've done in other areas where they've been beta testing like Spain and now moving towards Australia.
[32:44.000 --> 32:48.000]  So this is all formulaic, it's all heavily scripted, and we know their plan.
[32:48.000 --> 32:55.000]  And then we have Eric Muller joining us, Man Cal Muller, good friend of mine over many years.
[32:55.000 --> 33:03.000]  He was very close friends with Rush Limbaugh, new Rush Limbaugh when he started out in radio, more big time, started out in Missouri,
[33:03.000 --> 33:10.000]  but started out with the format that grew into his current show the last 30 years in California.
[33:10.000 --> 33:18.000]  Man Cal's known him that long, and he's told me a lot of Rush Limbaugh stories and confidence, he won't tell them on air.
[33:18.000 --> 33:26.000]  Very interesting, and the stories I know jive with what Matt Drudge told me, they were close friends, and with the others that know Rush Limbaugh.
[33:26.000 --> 33:32.000]  I never got a chance to talk to Rush Limbaugh, I saw him grow a lot, people are products of their time.
[33:32.000 --> 33:35.000]  So I didn't like the wars he backed and things like that, but he meant well.
[33:35.000 --> 33:41.000]  He really believed in America, he wasn't a globalist, and they tried to censor him, they tried to block him, it was a victory to keep him on air.
[33:41.000 --> 33:46.000]  That's a real sad thing that he's dead now, so we'll talk about that coming up in the second hour.
[33:46.000 --> 33:59.000]  But right now, introducing to you, Meet Lieutenant General Honor Ray, a very nasty anti-American globalist that totally defamed the Capitol Police.
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  I was there, they didn't know such thing, they were not working with us to do this.
[34:03.000 --> 34:07.000]  We know the left and CNN paid people to do it, and that's all coming out.
[34:07.000 --> 34:14.000]  They even bragged in an article, the secret history of the shadow campaign that saved 2020 election, they admitted at the end that they knew all about it, were involved.
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  And so if I had to guess, I think this guy probably ran the operation.
[34:17.000 --> 34:35.000]  I mean, I told you last week, I said, I bet you my bottom dollar that CNN was paying and commanding the young black man, whose father's also a major general, far left writer received 70,000 from CNN and NBC.
[34:35.000 --> 34:43.000]  And they had a CNN camera person embedded, they tried to hide that identity, and I just looked at the M.O. and I said, I bet Cooper probably was commanding that, he's CIA.
[34:43.000 --> 34:47.000]  And I would guess that this other individual is definitely an operative of those guys.
[34:47.000 --> 34:52.000]  I would look at the girl, and I'm just speculating on that, as the handler.
[34:52.000 --> 34:59.000]  So my successive approximation of it, though, and adding all the information together over time tells me that's what's going on.
[34:59.000 --> 35:00.000]  So let's go ahead.
[35:00.000 --> 35:12.000]  This is the general organizing publicly and secretly to take the fight to the American people and to, I guess, redo what the British did in 1775, 1776, with the gun confiscation.
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.000]  Meet the enemy general coming for you.
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.000]  It's impugning people with the worst slur they have.
[35:22.000 --> 35:30.000]  And now it's being used as a pretext to marshal the force of the state against its own people.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  Nancy Pelosi is leading that effort.
[35:32.000 --> 35:41.000]  She's just announced that someone called retired general Russell Honore of Louisiana will be leading a security review of what happened on January 6 of the riot.
[35:41.000 --> 35:51.000]  Nancy Pelosi says General Honore has been, quote, assessing our security needs by reviewing what happened on January 6 and how we must ensure that it does not happen again.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  But that's not right.
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.000]  General Honore already has come to conclusions about what happened on January 6.
[35:58.000 --> 36:03.000]  He's been very public about that, and you should know what those conclusions are and what kind of person he is.
[36:03.000 --> 36:10.000]  Just because his title is general doesn't mean that he's sane or not a wild-eyed partisan.
[36:10.000 --> 36:19.000]  On the day after the Capitol riot, Honore suggested it was an inside job and that the sergeant in arms might be implicated in the plot.
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  There was some complicit actions at the Capitol police.
[36:23.000 --> 36:31.000]  The police chief has been fired, but now we need to look at a special investigation.
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.000]  Was he complicit along with the sergeant of arms in the house and the Senate?
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  It gives appearance of complicity.
[36:40.000 --> 36:52.000]  They complied because they might have thought 45 was coming to the Capitol, and they gave way to the protesters who easily breached the Capitol.
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  This is a crime damn shame.
[36:56.000 --> 36:57.000]  What?
[36:57.000 --> 37:02.000]  Speaking of misinformation and conspiracy theories, there's no evidence for any of that.
[37:02.000 --> 37:03.000]  It's all made up.
[37:03.000 --> 37:04.000]  It's crazy.
[37:04.000 --> 37:05.000]  But he went on.
[37:05.000 --> 37:14.000]  In a radio interview that same day, General Honore explained that conservatives on the Capitol police force were to blame when he was asked about what happened with security.
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.000]  Watch this.
[37:15.000 --> 37:22.000]  By percentage, 30 to 40 percent of the line offices are Trumpsters.
[37:22.000 --> 37:23.000]  Yes.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  There you go.
[37:25.000 --> 37:29.000]  All right.
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.000]  I got this.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  That's the fact, Jack.
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  How would he know that?
[37:35.000 --> 37:40.000]  Well, of course, he doesn't know that he doesn't have any idea and who you voted for is irrelevant.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  These are sworn peace officers.
[37:42.000 --> 37:51.000]  They're doing their job, but General Honore decided to attack them on the base of speculation about their political beliefs.
[37:51.000 --> 38:00.000]  This is a problem that this guy would be in charge of anything, and that problem goes beyond General Honore pre-judging what happened at the Capitol in the base of no knowledge.
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  Like so many of our country's ex-generals, this guy's an authoritarian and an unhinged one.
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  He understands how to use force to achieve political objectives.
[38:09.000 --> 38:16.000]  And it seems like he's being set up to use his military training against anyone who sees the world differently than he does.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  They'll be reclassified as domestic terrorists.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  Who are these people and what threat do they pose?
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  Well, according to General Honore, those threats include the Constitution and our Second Amendment, for real.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  He believes your right to defend yourself is dangerous.
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  He said that, and we're quoting here.
[38:33.000 --> 38:38.000]  Quote, we can't permit Second Amendment rights at First Amendment protests.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  Really, constitutional scholar, are you?
[38:41.000 --> 38:46.000]  Imagine a public figure with a general in front of his name making that statement.
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  This is the guy Nancy Pelosi wants in charge of security.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  Honore is not a fan of the First Amendment either, by the way.
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.000]  On Twitter, he attacked this network.
[38:56.000 --> 39:03.000]  He even told people to stop buying the, we can't use it, profanity, the crappy stocks of any company that advertises on Fox News.
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  Talking about the stock price of advertisers.
[39:06.000 --> 39:15.000]  He retweeted posts accusing the social media site parlor of being, and we're quoting now, 100% complicit in the January 6th riot.
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  This is the guy.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  It's like putting Joy Reid in charge of security.
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  This is insane.
[39:21.000 --> 39:27.000]  And then Honore believes that elected members of Congress, people like U.S. Representative Lauren Bobert,
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.000]  shouldn't be allowed to fly on commercial aircraft because of her political views.
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  Quote, put her on a no fly list.
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  He said something similar about Senator Josh Hawley, the senator from Missouri.
[39:38.000 --> 39:46.000]  Quote, this little piece of crap with his Yale law degree should be run out of D.C. and disbarred ASAP.
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  Run out of D.C., really, what do you mean by that?
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  Run out of D.C. and disbarred.
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  It's even more powerful.
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.000]  The need for storable foods are increasingly apparent.
[39:58.000 --> 40:08.000]  With millions left without power, including most grocery stores, many Texas residents are left without food.
[40:08.000 --> 40:16.000]  The lines at the grocery stores are getting longer and longer, while most of the store shelves are left bare.
[40:16.000 --> 40:23.000]  Now we know that in the most historic record freezing temperatures in over a century,
[40:23.000 --> 40:31.000]  your government can simply turn off the power, turn off the heat, and turn off the water.
[40:31.000 --> 40:36.000]  Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family.
[40:36.000 --> 40:42.000]  Go to infowarstore.com and get at least a year's supply of storable foods
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.000]  to make sure you and your family are prepared for the unimaginable.
[40:47.000 --> 41:13.000]  Get your storable foods at infowarstore.com.
[41:18.000 --> 41:26.000]  As sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[41:29.000 --> 41:36.000]  God is the author of us having free will, and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[41:36.000 --> 41:43.000]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington, D.C., and Fauci, and the mass cult,
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  it's all about dominating your free will.
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  It's all about telling you you're dirty and you're ugly and you're in the bad
[41:48.000 --> 41:54.000]  because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[41:54.000 --> 42:01.000]  Finally, we're seeing major state governments in the United States running TV and radio ads saying,
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  everybody, take your vitamin D3, take your zinc, and take your C.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  It's essential for your body cells to maintain your health.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  Essential means you must have it.

[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  or the beauty of your child learning knowledge.
[43:30.000 --> 43:31.000]  The beauty of music.
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic.
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  And that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  So don't worship the globalist.
[43:41.000 --> 43:42.000]  Don't worship the NFL.
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  Don't worship all the things of the system.
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.000]  But worship the things of God because we're made by God.
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.000]  And appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech.
[43:51.000 --> 43:52.000]  While you still have it.
[43:52.000 --> 43:57.000]  While you still have it.
[43:57.000 --> 44:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[44:13.000 --> 44:21.000]  Another disgusting oh and yesterday 70 year old Rush Limbaugh the trailblaze modern conservative nationalist populist media died.
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  You can say oh well he wasn't perfect.
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.000]  He didn't expose the new world order for the last few years.
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  Well yeah because they take him off the air.
[44:28.000 --> 44:29.000]  He knew all about it.
[44:29.000 --> 44:34.000]  The good news is he did stand up for our sovereignty and he got better over the years as we all have.
[44:34.000 --> 44:38.000]  They were on the path of trying to become more informed and more accurate.
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  And it's a major major loss.
[44:40.000 --> 44:44.000]  A lot of people are scrambling to try to fill his shoes.
[44:44.000 --> 44:50.000]  And I can tell you from the insiders in those networks they don't want a show like that anymore.
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  They don't want leadership like that anymore.
[44:52.000 --> 44:58.000]  And so they're looking at replacing Rush Limbaugh with sports.
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  And I think that's a terrible idea.
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  It's an absolutely terrible idea.
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  People are like oh Jones you're going to be the guy.
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  I mean almost every time I talk to Trump.
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  Because he loved Limbaugh.
[45:08.000 --> 45:09.000]  He would bring up Rush Limbaugh.
[45:09.000 --> 45:12.000]  And he would say man you know they say you're going to replace Trump.
[45:12.000 --> 45:18.000]  I mean you're going to replace Limbaugh when he retires or goes.
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  And I'm like no sir no sir they're not ever going to put me on 600 radio stations.
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  The biggest ones in the country.
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  In fact they're planning to phase out talk radio.
[45:27.000 --> 45:28.000]  But this is the model of victory.
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  And I'll talk about it with Mankow next hour.
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.000]  In the 80s AM radios were turning off.
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.000]  They were turning the transmitters off.
[45:36.000 --> 45:40.000]  But Roger Ailes had the idea.
[45:40.000 --> 45:44.000]  Because there was so much censorship of conservatism to launch a conservative network.
[45:44.000 --> 45:45.000]  Around a strong voice.
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  And Limbaugh was the first trial case it took off.
[45:48.000 --> 45:52.000]  And then instead of doing talk radio Ailes just went on to launch Fox.
[45:52.000 --> 45:56.000]  So that's where all this came from is Roger Ailes.
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  Roger Ailes is the first domino.
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  Limbaugh is the second.
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.000]  And then the entire industry of conservative nationalists talk radio that we stand on.
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.000]  That is here.
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.000]  Now that all the internet censorship here all the attacks all the corruption.
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.000]  We still have those hundreds of radio stations that keep info wars on the air.
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  Even when they banned us across the internet.
[46:15.000 --> 46:21.000]  And then off of that great radio audience we were able to build emergency backup of band.video and info wars.com.
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  So that's why Russian one boss so important.
[46:23.000 --> 46:29.000]  And so many other people want to make fun of his death or they the left is celebrating.
[46:29.000 --> 46:34.000]  But they're going to be you know crying when it's all over because the awakening is explosive.
[46:34.000 --> 46:35.000]  It's here.
[46:35.000 --> 46:36.000]  It's not cues great awakening.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  It's the real great the real great awakening.
[46:39.000 --> 46:40.000]  It's very very exciting.
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  Now let's get back to general on array.
[46:42.000 --> 46:55.000]  Who makes the most threatening hateful crazy statements calling you know one third of the military white supremacist and one third of the police are bad Trump supporters and white people are bad and he's about as.
[46:55.000 --> 47:00.000]  White as black guy I've ever seen other than I guess the quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs.
[47:00.000 --> 47:06.000]  And he's up there going along with the whole globalist program wanting war with the American people.
[47:06.000 --> 47:10.000]  So here's more of what Tucker Carlson had to say about it last night.
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  Stock price of advertisers.
[47:12.000 --> 47:22.000]  He retweeted posts accusing the social media site parlor of being a recording now 100% complicit in the January 6th riot.
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  This is the guy.
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  It's like putting joy read in charge of security.
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  This is insane.
[47:28.000 --> 47:41.000]  General on array believes that elected members of Congress people like U.S. Representative Lauren Bobert shouldn't be allowed to fly on commercial aircraft because of her political views quote put her on a no fly list.
[47:41.000 --> 47:56.000]  He said something similar about Senator Josh Hawley the senator from Missouri quote this little piece of crap with his Yale law degree should be run out of DC and disbarred ASAP run out of DC really what do you mean by that.
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  Run out of DC and disbar this is crazy.
[47:59.000 --> 48:05.000]  But this is the guy Nancy Pelosi is leading the security response to the capital riot.
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  This should really worry you.
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.000]  Is this really about what happened in the capital on January 6th.
[48:12.000 --> 48:13.000]  No.
[48:13.000 --> 48:21.000]  It's about you and your rights rights that people like General on array and Nancy Pelosi view is the greatest threat of all.
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  Josh Hawley was singled out by this man.
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  He joins us now to respond.
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  I appreciate your coming on tonight.
[48:27.000 --> 48:36.000]  This makes me genuinely nervous that someone like this could have any control of the so-called security at the U.S. Capitol or in Washington or in America.
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  Yeah it's very disturbing Tucker.
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  I mean there's some of the statements that the general has made are just downright crazy.
[48:42.000 --> 48:43.000]  You cited some of them.
[48:43.000 --> 48:49.000]  I mean sing with at least Stefanik for instance ought to be treated like a terrorist and not allowed to fly put on the no fly list.
[48:49.000 --> 49:00.000]  There's some of the statements about law enforcement. This is somebody who this whole last year Tucker encouraged condoned the violent rioting in our city said that federal law enforcement who were sent to Portland to protect the.
[49:00.000 --> 49:08.000]  They were a mob themselves said that they were acting like they were serving a dictator to attack them for not being real soldiers.
[49:08.000 --> 49:09.000]  Those are his words.
[49:09.000 --> 49:10.000]  I mean it's unbelievable.
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.000]  It's just unbelievable and it shows that Nancy Pelosi isn't interested in getting any facts.
[49:15.000 --> 49:27.000]  She's interested in power and in amassing power and an excuse to keep hold of power including those thousands of troops who are still at the Capitol who are still there treating it like an armed camp.
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  Why they no one will say but this is what Pelosi is interested in.
[49:31.000 --> 49:43.000]  So I saw an internal memo today from House Republicans saying you know we're not going to question the presence of all those federal troops in Washington because there is some kind of threat which they never explain.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  What a betrayal of the country I would say.
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  But beyond that this is a guy running around calling himself general.
[49:49.000 --> 49:58.000]  I mean we shouldn't we be getting a little concerned at this point that the leadership of the U.S. military should be totally nonpartisan and not involved in these debates.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  I mean are we sure that it still is.
[50:00.000 --> 50:07.000]  Yeah well this is somebody this particular general has been retired now for a while and I don't question a service to our country at all Tucker.
[50:07.000 --> 50:14.000]  I applaud him for it but he has been a dedicated partisan that's putting it mildly since he left the military.
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.000]  An extreme left wing Democrat and you can just see it in the comments that he's made.
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.000]  But I'm concerned about what they're laying the groundwork for here and what Nancy Pelosi is doing.
[50:23.000 --> 50:36.000]  I'm concerned that they continue to treat the January 6 catastrophe that criminal riot as an excuse to seize power to control more power to step on people's second amendment rights to take away their first amendment rights.
[50:36.000 --> 50:39.000]  Now we're hearing about a domestic war on terror.
[50:39.000 --> 50:46.000]  I mean what's that going to be an excuse to go rifle through the emails and bank statements and personal messages of law abiding Americans.
[50:46.000 --> 50:53.000]  I mean this is very very frightening stuff and what Pelosi and the Democrats are doing here trying to consolidate power.
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  It's dangerous.
[50:54.000 --> 50:59.000]  Please convince your fellow Republicans on the Hill to stand up for the country please.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  I think what you said is absolutely right.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  It needed to be said and I hope others will say it.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  Thank you very much.
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  Senator could just thank you.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  All right.
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.000]  That full video is up on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  I suggest you share it.
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  So let me explain something.
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.000]  The globalists know there's a worldwide political realignment against them.
[51:18.000 --> 51:24.000]  They know that their derivatives are in the thousands of trillions and are fake and they know they're all worse than Bernie Madoff.
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  They know the world's waking up to that.
[51:26.000 --> 51:37.000]  And so they fear presidents like Trump or Bolsonaro or others that they can't control like the one they do control Boris Johnson will rally the people to not be totally screwed over.
[51:37.000 --> 51:42.000]  So they chose Biden because he's so senile and so weak to be seen like once a week.
[51:42.000 --> 51:47.000]  So the bureaucracy can be in control and so you get accustomed to not hearing a president.
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  But now you hear technocrats.
[51:49.000 --> 51:56.000]  And at Debo six years ago they recommended by the year 2020 they conditioned the public.
[51:56.000 --> 52:07.000]  They actually said this to accept bankers and other technocrats as the leaders and that they shift into a role on the news as our leaders.
[52:07.000 --> 52:16.000]  So it's scientific dictatorship and they chose to go with the medical dictatorship because the doctors can be very authoritarian.
[52:16.000 --> 52:21.000]  They can be very bossy. They can also be downright mad scientist like Joseph Mingla and many others.
[52:21.000 --> 52:24.000]  And Bill Gates and his daughter is now mad scientist as well.
[52:24.000 --> 52:27.000]  She's now joined the political fray. We knew she would.
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  So now she's fair game and she wears a big sweater.
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  So seriously in all the interviews everything's OK.
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  It's not threatening if Hitler will war on a big sweater.
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.000]  He won the war.
[52:35.000 --> 52:36.000]  We can't fight him.
[52:36.000 --> 52:39.000]  He's wearing a big sweater to that scary black uniform or brown uniform.
[52:39.000 --> 52:43.000]  So we're here and they really mean business in all of this.
[52:43.000 --> 52:48.000]  So we'll talk about it more. Mancow Muller. Good longtime friends with Russia Limbaugh for over 30 years.
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  He's from the same area in Missouri.
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  Family friends.
[52:51.000 --> 52:55.000]  And they also work together in California and Russia's big break job.
[52:55.000 --> 52:56.000]  So did sort of Mancow.
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  They all came out of the same stable.
[52:58.000 --> 53:02.000]  So that is all coming up on the other side.
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  Mancow's been radio since like 18 years old.
[53:04.000 --> 53:05.000]  So he's kind of like me.
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.000]  I've been on radio since 21.
[53:06.000 --> 53:07.000]  This is crazy.
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  I've been on there 27 years.
[53:09.000 --> 53:13.000]  Not like Limbaugh 40 50 years he was on since he was in high school.
[53:13.000 --> 53:16.000]  And so that is coming up next hour separately.
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  We can ship now within one day.
[53:18.000 --> 53:23.000]  The power was turned back on at the facility.
[53:23.000 --> 53:27.000]  We have our warehouse ready to ship all the great products out to you like winter,
[53:27.000 --> 53:30.000]  sun, high quality vitamin D3 to boost your immune system and body's natural
[53:30.000 --> 53:31.000]  defenses, highest quality.
[53:31.000 --> 53:35.000]  It is discounted and it also has vitamin K in it for your immune system.
[53:35.000 --> 53:41.000]  You can get it for 50% off also the ultra 12 50% off and you get the two together
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  in a combo 40% off.
[53:43.000 --> 53:46.000]  And yes, we saw a big uptick in storeable food orders.
[53:46.000 --> 53:50.000]  A lot of people notice that the storeable food we were cooking on area today had
[53:50.000 --> 53:51.000]  different packaging.
[53:51.000 --> 53:55.000]  That's because my Patriot changed their packaging two years ago to even sturdier
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  bags inside.
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  So that's why you saw that it's old packaging because that's real storeable food.
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  We have a 10 year supply here in the building for a family.
[54:04.000 --> 54:07.000]  So a 10 year supply for this many people would be a couple months supply.
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  I mean, yeah, we got generators.
[54:09.000 --> 54:10.000]  We got some solar panels.
[54:10.000 --> 54:11.000]  We got food.
[54:11.000 --> 54:15.000]  It still wasn't enough with all the equipment we've got to stay completely live on
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  air, but we stayed on air regardless.
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  But I would get your storeable food.
[54:18.000 --> 54:22.000]  They were going to do a discount for a while, but it's 10% off because the emergency
[54:22.000 --> 54:26.000]  on three months, four months, six months, your supply, four week supplies ready to
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.000]  ship right now.
[54:27.000 --> 54:32.000]  And the pro pure water filter pro is back $50 off on that best deal ever.
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  All that prepare it with Alex.com.
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.000]  Prepare it with Alex.com.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  The umbrella site info or store.com.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  They'll be right back with our number two.
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  Stay with us.
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.000]  My enemies are your enemies.
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  They're the globalists.
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.000]  Third extremist.
[54:48.000 --> 54:54.000]  They're a consortium of bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers, vampires,
[54:54.000 --> 55:00.000]  wherever you want to call them that are highly predatory and are setting up a false
[55:00.000 --> 55:07.000]  fantasy land system of constant bombardment of propaganda drugs and electromagnetic radiation
[55:07.000 --> 55:15.000]  to change the very DNA of the human species to mutate us into a form that they can control
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  like a pawn on the chessboard.
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  The bottom line is they want to play God.
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.000]  They are playing God and the news is only going to tighten around our necks from here
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  on out.
[55:25.000 --> 55:26.000]  So many other people want to be positive.
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  They want to put out fake news and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.000]  with New World Order.
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.000]  But at the end of the day, it's all about the population.
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.000]  It's all about world government.
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  It's all about the end of the human system as we know it.
[55:38.000 --> 56:07.000]  And all its ashes and nightmare being built only admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[56:09.000 --> 56:15.000]  Decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  in joints and the digestive system.
[56:17.000 --> 56:24.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[56:29.000 --> 56:35.000]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  facts that pertain to reality.
[56:37.000 --> 56:43.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[57:07.000 --> 57:27.000]  Now once at the top of the Martian atmosphere, an action packed seven minutes begins.
[57:27.000 --> 57:35.000]  That is the time of the descent through the Martian atmosphere to the surface of the planet.
[57:35.000 --> 57:43.000]  In addition, or as part of this, the temperatures that will reach the surface of the spacecraft
[57:43.000 --> 57:50.000]  will be equivalent to the temperatures on the surface of the sun.
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  And it will not melt.
[57:52.000 --> 57:53.000]  It all goes well.
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.000]  It will not evaporate.
[57:55.000 --> 57:56.000]  It will not vaporize.
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  It will not be destroyed.
[57:58.000 --> 58:06.000]  It will be able to withstand temperatures equivalent to the surface of the sun.
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.000]  Then the first supersonic parachute inflation happens.
[58:09.000 --> 58:16.000]  All of this has to happen on a sequence that controllers will have no control over.
[58:16.000 --> 58:24.000]  Because of the distance between Mars and Earth, controlling the spacecraft in real time is
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.000]  out of the question.
[58:27.000 --> 58:38.000]  It takes minutes for a command from NASA on Earth to reach the Perseverance rover.
[58:38.000 --> 58:49.000]  So it's up to the spacecraft and the software that's been written to execute numerous tasks
[58:49.000 --> 58:53.000]  at split second timing.
[58:53.000 --> 58:58.000]  And it also has to account for any variables that could threaten the descent and land.
[58:58.000 --> 59:04.000]  It has to recognize something out of whack and make an adjustment, make an adaption.
[59:04.000 --> 59:11.000]  Because unlike landing on the moon, the moon's close enough, quote, unquote, where we could
[59:11.000 --> 59:14.000]  send alternate landing instructions.
[59:14.000 --> 59:23.000]  But Mars is so far away that all we can do is sit there and watch for seven minutes.
[59:23.000 --> 59:31.000]  As this spacecraft plummets, the Martian atmosphere reaches temperatures equivalent to the surface
[59:31.000 --> 59:36.000]  of the sun, parachutes have to deploy.
[59:36.000 --> 59:39.000]  It has to land at the exact speed.
[59:39.000 --> 59:46.000]  If it doesn't, damage could happen, the rover could be destroyed at any phase of this landing.
[59:46.000 --> 59:50.000]  And nobody can stop it if something goes wrong.
[59:50.000 --> 59:59.000]  Because of how long it takes, a command instruction sent from Earth to reach the rover, which at the
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  point in time will be in orbit around Mars.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  Now this just fascinates me, and I understand these controllers are going to be biting their nails
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  during these seven minutes being unable to correct anything.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  And for much of the seven minutes, because of the heat generated by reentry,
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  they won't be able to have any communication with the rover at all.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  But even so, whatever communication they get would be delayed because of how far Mars is.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  Anyway, I got to take a break.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  I just noticed the clock.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  The time be back in just a second.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Well, my friends, that's it.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  You had another excursion into broadcast excellence in the can.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  Enjoyed being with you today.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  Always do, and look forward to the next time.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Thanks to Mark Stein, who has been in standby mode all day.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  Wasn't sure I was going to be able to go today.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  And then each hour I had to assess.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  But we made it.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  Thank you, Mr. Stein.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  See you all next time.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  Well, there you go.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  Boy in Viage.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  We couldn't see a way out.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  We were completely surrounded, and they all looked like the same person.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  Zombies itching to convert us into their weird Hollywood cult.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  So again, that is the final moments of the Rush Limbaugh radio program.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  And the left wants us to just be depressed about it.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  But he had a good long life, did a great job.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  And I think it's clear to say I wouldn't have this show.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  We wouldn't have talk radio period.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  The Globals would have probably already won if it wasn't for Roger Ailes and Rush Limbaugh.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  That's why the left hates them so much.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  We should celebrate them.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  They weren't perfect men, but they did at least love America.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  They think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  You know, I've told you that the Globals have tried to hire me.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  They've tried to get me to join them.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  But metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  I'm the connection with God.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  And I know that God is my life text, so I cannot join the enemy.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system,
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power out of it.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger,
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  you're not God.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the Universe doesn't like.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  That's a fact.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  Holy violence, Rush Limbaugh, see you on the other side.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  Modern talk radio, Fox News, all of it, owes to Rush Limbaugh and the vision of Roger Ailes.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have put up any fight.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  They had to trailblaze when there was no free speech, no broadcast media.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  Reagan had gotten rid of the fairness doctrine.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  They had moved forward, but nobody was challenging it.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  Ailes went out, leased the radio stations, put Limbaugh on.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  It was a giant hit.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  They had then got other talk show hosts like Man Cal Muller, who's about to be joining us,
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  longtime friends with, of course, Rush Limbaugh.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  Hopefully they'll tell some of the stories here, but he's a pretty private guy.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  And that's why we owe so much to Rush Limbaugh.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  Thirty years of them trying to censor him and take him off the air,
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  and he fought through all of it, then fought through going deaf, fought through, you know,
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  being in an automobile accident and having back pain and getting addicted to painkillers.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  He was a human.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  He was pro-war.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  Man Cal criticized him for some of those wars, but he really thought it was the right thing to do.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  And he loved America and the globalist hating.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  And he sure got more hardcore over the years as it was proven that we were right about this whole globalist program.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  And so I thought I'd just play the last 30, 40 seconds of his final broadcast from what was it, February 4th,
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  where he said he'd been so sick that he had to have a backup post or February 2nd.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  He had to have a backup post there the entire time.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  And so he fought through it like a champ and through the election.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  And again, I just salute Rush Limbaugh and I salute the First Amendment and I salute his perseverance.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  And you know a man by his enemies and they are celebrating on the streets because they think they've got America down.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  They think it's another sign of their supremacy, but I smell their defeat in the future.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  Here are Rush Limbaugh's final broadcast words.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  My friends, that's it.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  Yet another excursion into broadcast excellence in the can.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  Enjoyed being with you today.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  Always do and look forward to the next time.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  Thanks to Mark Stein, who has been in standby mode all day.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  Wasn't sure I was going to be able to go today.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  And then each hour I had to assess, but we made it.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  Thank you, Mr. Stein. See you all next time.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  But you never know. You never know if there'll be a next time, whether you're 10 years old or 100 years old.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  So Eric Mankal Muller, you're somebody that's known Limbaugh for 30 years.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  And of course we were showing some 60 minutes clips from 1992.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  You were actually there broadcasting in the building that day. They were there.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  And let's just be honest, you had your own fights with Rush.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  You're more of a libertarian nationalist populist.
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  He was more of a Republican party guy.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  He thought that was the most important thing.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  And I see that we don't want the neocons to set up a new party to make sure Republicans lose.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  We want to take the Republican party over.
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  So I think Limbaugh was always right about that, but we're more of, you know, we the people guy.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  He was more Republican guy, but he did it out of a place I think of thinking it was the right thing to do.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  So not to speak ill of the dead.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  Mankal, thank you for joining us from your home.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  I know Snowden up in beautiful Chicago.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  When wilt out free the people of God of mercy, when the people Lord the people, not crowns and thrones, but men.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  These are the arguments I would have with Rush.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  I love Rush to Missouri brothers.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  I'm going to miss that old mule.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  He gave me advice.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  He was very supportive of me in my career.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  There was a few times when he couldn't help me.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  And he didn't.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  It was still business and he was a competitive guy.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  I will tell you the two times, Alex, if you pair.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  And again, I'm looking at my friend Ron Perlman who's been on my radio show a lot.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  I was on Sons of Anarchy with him.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  And he's saying we're going to celebrate in hell with Rush and he feels sorry for the devil having to be with Rush and hell.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  And it just sickens me what I'm seeing today.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  So I hate to bring up any negatives, but we talked about everything yesterday.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  And I wonder if you would like to tell me what those, what those arguments were about.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  Well, I would like you to tell us about those arguments.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  You just told me you had quite a, quite a few of the rush, but, but.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  Well, no, there was two big ones and I'll tell you the two big ones.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  I felt that, you know, look, we're two kids from Missouri.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  I grew up on a dirt road, my nearest neighbor was a half mile away and it wasn't a kid a half mile away in Suicide Falls, Missouri.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  And I didn't like when Rush was supporting George W. Bush and the big tax increase.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  They said no new taxes or was it the former Bush, whichever Bush it was.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  Was Bush seeing you read my lips, no new taxes.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, the big, the big spending people.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  And I would say, Rush, you didn't support it with Bill Clinton.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  I, and I had the same argument with him during the Obama administration.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  You're, you're against all this big government, but you're okay with all this big government after 911.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  So these are the kind of things when, when I talked to that we would argue about.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  And I had the same kind of arguments with Sean Hannity.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  I've never been a party first kind of guy and, but Rush believed that.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  And you also have to think what are, what were our choices? What, what other choice did, did Rush have?
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  I guess you dance with the one who brung you, but I've never been a party guy, but you know, are you going to pick the libertarian candidate?
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  I mean, I hosted the libertarian convention one year and what a group of buffoons.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  So what, what do we do, Alex?
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  You and I guys like us.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  Yeah, we back out outsiders, visionaries, but they have no chance at hello winning.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  So Rush was going with the winner, I guess.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  Well, sure.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  Here's the good news.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  Trump would never got an elected without Rush Limbaugh building the platform.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  So you see that our movement to radicalize the Republicans and make them American and take over a party has been somewhat successful.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  That's why the left and the globalist are so panicked right now.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  So at the end of the day, Rush was right about not breaking up the Republican party where he was wrong.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  Was those damn wars, which we now know were based on lies, but I also understand the instinct that America is going to war.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  Once we're going to war, you know, because the troops are there, you want to back it.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  But I think that's really the black mark on Rush.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  It doesn't matter.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  He, you knew him well.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  I don't love people knew him well.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  And I've got black marks myself.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  I'm not perfect.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  The key is he really believed it was the right thing to do.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  He wasn't doing it like Dick Cheney for power and money.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  Let's talk about the Rush Limbaugh you knew when you first met him.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  Let's talk about some of your reflections now in hindsight.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  Well, you know, Alex, the advice I would give any man, and I wonder if you would comment on this.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  Don't ever get your wife a boob job because they want to show everybody.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  It ruins marriages.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  I've never known a guy who got his wife a boob job and it didn't ruin the marriage.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  What am I talking about?
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  I sound insane.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  I understand.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  Well, it's the fat girl thing.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  In fact, I teased him a couple of times early on and called him fat girl.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  You know, look, we're from Missouri.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  The way we teased was brutal.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  We were straight talkers.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  And so, you know, he had, I don't want to overplay this like, you know, the Oliver Stone movie where Nixon's looking at a steak and it's bleeding the blood from Vietnam.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  I'm not going to say that, but I think Rush had some insecurities.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  And I think I think he was bold in overcoming his insecurities looking in there.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  You know, he got in shape.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  He married a hot woman and moved down to Florida.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  But, you know, in the backwards of Missouri, being a fat boy where we're from, Kate Gerardo, Missouri, he was teased and laughed at.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  And of course, all the other radio hosts, they didn't have anything on talent.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  So they went low, you know, the Howard Stern types and oh, he's fat.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  Look at him.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  He's fat.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  He's so fat.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  But I think it got to him early on.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  And then finally, you know, the guy had so much money and power.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  Yeah, I'm fat.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  You know, I just have to laugh.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  I think about William Shatner, a friend of mine who was, you know, just a great guy.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  But he said, you know, I'd rather be a has been than it ever was.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  I love all these losers coming out, peeing on Russia's grave today.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  What a group of losers.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  Hollywood is so bankrupt.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Radio is a leper colony.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  And the upper ups at Cumulus Media, they didn't know what to do with the rush.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  They didn't agree with them.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  They didn't understand the audience.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  They don't understand my audience.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  They don't understand the people.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  They don't understand the pain that's going on out there right now.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  And Russ came from that rush came from the center of America from the Bible.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  He believed in God.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  By the way, you talk about America being down and out.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  Yeah.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  Yeah, there I am with Bill.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  Love him.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  Love him.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  Captain Kirk.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  But no, Alex, look, we know things are going to get bad for a while.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  But you and I also know because we've read the book that good wins and God wins.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  So let them laugh.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  Let them have fun.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  They like to cheer and scream in the morning at night.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  That's what devils do.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  And in the end, they're going to have to stand before their maker.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  And what a bunch of miserable son of a bitches that are crapping on Russia's grave today.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  These Hollywood types turn it off.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  Don't support them anymore.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  And Ron Perlman, you really are a devil.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  He played hellboy.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  He really is the devil.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  Oh, Ron Perlman is always threatening to beat my ass.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  I mean, these guys are such thugs.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  Alex, I've hung out with Ron Perlman.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  I was on an episode of Sons and Anarchy, very famous episode.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  And Alex, I know Ron Perlman and I know you.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  You can check his ass.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  You can check his ass.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  You can check his ass.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:03.360]  without power. Including most grocery stores. Many Texas residents are left
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:09.640]  without food. The lines at the grocery stores are getting longer and longer
[1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:16.680]  while most of the store shelves are left bare. Now we know that in the most
[1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:22.520]  historic record freezing temperatures in over a century, your government can
[1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:29.440]  simply turn off the power, turn off the heat, and turn off the water. Don't let
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:34.680]  your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family. Go to
[1:14:34.680 --> 1:14:40.520]  infowarstore.com and get at least a year supply of storable foods to make
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:45.760]  sure you and your family are prepared for the unimaginable. Get your
[1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:57.960]  storable foods at infowarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:14:57.960 --> 1:15:17.720]  There was a time before I even got into top radio when I was getting into it
[1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:23.680]  1995 that I knew the household name man cow while he was as big as Howard
[1:15:23.680 --> 1:15:28.840]  Stern they were big enemies. But you see man cow didn't sell the country out he
[1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:33.120]  when the Clintons approached him didn't bow to them so then he got cut back to
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:36.520]  being only the number one talk show host in Chicago and limited syndication but
[1:15:36.520 --> 1:15:42.280]  that's that's not a failure that is a a success badge to be censored. So remember
[1:15:42.280 --> 1:15:46.160]  it was man cow Muller it was Rush Limbaugh that these guys were you know
[1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:49.720]  put out by the same folks indicated all that went through the same stuff and so
[1:15:49.720 --> 1:15:52.720]  the big question the crews asking me he just said hey I want to get into this
[1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:56.600]  without me even bringing it up who's gonna replace Rush Limbaugh that's the
[1:15:56.600 --> 1:16:00.920]  big 64 trillion dollar question I know you've got your ear to the ground you
[1:16:00.920 --> 1:16:03.640]  know more people in the industry than probably anybody else out there other
[1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:09.480]  than Limbaugh or maybe a Howard Stern what is gonna happen now those 650 700
[1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:14.240]  radio stations. Let me let me just say one thing it's I just you remember the
[1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:19.600]  smoking gun yes all the paperwork is there you can go look it up yourself in
[1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:25.000]  every market I beat Howard Stern but see Howard Stern as I said yesterday wore
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:29.440]  sunglasses and had writers in the other room everything was written down when it
[1:16:29.440 --> 1:16:35.640]  comes to me and you and Rush it's from the heart it's from the soul you can't
[1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:41.760]  control a guy like me or you or Rush that's why Stern gets promoted that's
[1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:46.080]  why he gets to be on the satellite and gets 90 million dollars a year I would
[1:16:46.080 --> 1:16:53.000]  say the same thing about Rogan why did Rogan scrub so much for a paycheck my
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:59.280]  soul is not for sale your soul is not for sale Alex so what you inherit the
[1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:03.800]  world but you sell out and look I've never been able to do it so instead of
[1:17:03.800 --> 1:17:07.480]  60 million dollars a year I made 10 million a year I'm okay with that I
[1:17:07.480 --> 1:17:12.760]  sleep very well at night and the fact is opiate Anthony and Stern and all those
[1:17:12.760 --> 1:17:19.000]  guys we kicked their asses okay let's move on who's gonna replace Rush my guy
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:22.800]  is they make him too dangerous is Chris plant I have you ever heard of Chris
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:29.240]  plant Alex Jones yes I have I think he's pretty damn good which means they
[1:17:29.240 --> 1:17:34.480]  won't cumulus won't hire him because he's good so you have to think what will
[1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:37.880]  radio do that's really stupid and I was talking I talked to three people today
[1:17:37.880 --> 1:17:43.000]  from cumulus which you know hosts host rush show I don't know they may be
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:49.100]  something boring like Mark Stein they may move up Levin Levin who is look I
[1:17:49.100 --> 1:17:54.600]  like these guys but they're boring they're boring sorry sitting in the
[1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:59.040]  library you've seen that show what they like is is it safe I mean you talk
[1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:02.560]  about the New World Order you talk about the microchip the market the beast the
[1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:06.120]  globalist the big issue it's that final piece that you're not allowed to talk
[1:18:06.120 --> 1:18:13.560]  about it's it's so true and I reflect on you know some of our close friends that
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:18.280]  went before us Malachi Martin and Jim Mars and you know connect the dots la la
[1:18:18.280 --> 1:18:23.120]  la TV Herman right you connect the dots and well what okay so what does it all
[1:18:23.120 --> 1:18:30.680]  mean what what's the bottom line and you and I know and we tell them oh can't do
[1:18:30.680 --> 1:18:35.280]  that so you have to make everything an enigma you can't really say anything
[1:18:35.280 --> 1:18:40.520]  you know and I think another possible replacement and again to me he's a deep
[1:18:40.520 --> 1:18:46.560]  state scripted guy my opinion deep state scripted very controllable he reads
[1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:52.560]  from a script oh yeah this Ben Shapiro oh they definitely I mean they they took
[1:18:52.560 --> 1:18:57.680]  of course a mutual friend of ours Michael Savage off of those stations to give
[1:18:57.680 --> 1:19:02.160]  that guy and I'm not against people's success but he was given given all those
[1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:05.960]  stations and here's me the problem
[1:19:05.960 --> 1:19:09.720]  Cumulus premiere player channel all those different glommers have been involved
[1:19:09.720 --> 1:19:14.480]  with with Russia over the years rush was so good and such an icon that stations
[1:19:14.480 --> 1:19:18.240]  wanted him so then they could make them carry all the other programs that were
[1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:23.200]  boring if they don't put somebody badass in there and populist in there then
[1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:27.120]  it's not gonna hold the audience and they're gonna lose those stations which
[1:19:27.120 --> 1:19:30.200]  is really the plan they've been divesting out of the stations they've been
[1:19:30.200 --> 1:19:34.280]  buying up the stations they put weird you know leftist garbage on it don't do
[1:19:34.280 --> 1:19:40.800]  that don't do that you can't do that
[1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:49.040]  you can't reveal the truth like that I'm here to tell you Alex you're right it's
[1:19:49.040 --> 1:19:55.320]  exactly what they're gonna do folks what I said yesterday location location
[1:19:55.320 --> 1:20:02.360]  you and I were joking agenda agenda agenda you sit there at home well they
[1:20:02.360 --> 1:20:09.760]  wouldn't do that you they wouldn't do that of course of course they they want
[1:20:09.760 --> 1:20:13.440]  their shut their station to be successful Cumulus wouldn't take their
[1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:19.240]  stations they want to make money I'm here to tell you with with a group of
[1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:26.200]  investors and this is a big story Tony Tomasca Mike Fowler is our lead in and
[1:20:26.200 --> 1:20:31.680]  other billionaires in Chicago with me they want to get rid of WLS I wanted to
[1:20:31.680 --> 1:20:37.080]  buy it I could have saved it I'm talking like a month ago Alex
[1:20:38.120 --> 1:20:42.120]  well let's explain what's happening they want a monopoly so big mega banks have
[1:20:42.120 --> 1:20:45.160]  unlimited trillions in fake currency so we look at multi-billion dollar
[1:20:45.160 --> 1:20:49.000]  industries and free speech the system sees it as a place from media to
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:52.880]  organize for local talent as big tech sensors everything is going to be an
[1:20:52.880 --> 1:20:58.200]  incredible hunger for radio and TV stations to build real true stuff around
[1:20:58.200 --> 1:21:02.280]  populism they can then direct sell products get sponsors the globalists
[1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:05.960]  don't want that they want a monopoly and so the word is they are killing talk
[1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:10.920]  radio by design and big corporations are coming in and hospital districts and
[1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:14.680]  things like at 590 they spent millions of dollars to take all the
[1:21:14.680 --> 1:21:19.120]  conservatives off they put weekend shows on for tens of millions a year local
[1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:23.680]  hospital shows that were really a payoff to remove the conservatives off the
[1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:26.960]  year and that's done on every marquee station in the country that's the
[1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:31.960]  domination that's the control Alex what you're saying is a gauze honest truth
[1:21:31.960 --> 1:21:38.640]  I've lived this I was their quarterback I know all the players do you
[1:21:38.640 --> 1:21:42.560]  understand how crazy it is but this is what people went through against the
[1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:47.840]  Nazis this is what people went through in Russia and Cuban everywhere else I'm
[1:21:47.840 --> 1:21:51.560]  telling you that the people in charge don't care about the bottom line they
[1:21:51.560 --> 1:21:54.960]  don't give two they care about power that's why they're willing to kill the
[1:21:54.960 --> 1:21:57.440]  dollar that's why they're willing to kill the border that's why they're willing
[1:21:57.440 --> 1:22:00.280]  to shut the power plants off that's why they're willing to wreck everything
[1:22:00.280 --> 1:22:04.320]  because that's their plan to consolidate it in a war you wreck stuff and we're
[1:22:04.320 --> 1:22:11.240]  under globalist attack they're big money friends they don't want a great radio
[1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:14.920]  station or radio stations that have a guy like Russia or you or me or anyone
[1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:19.640]  else they don't want populism I mean my god but it was so popular they couldn't
[1:22:19.640 --> 1:22:23.120]  get rid of rush because he still kept all the stations that's why I predict
[1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:27.520]  there's I predict I predict there's nobody but a hardcore populist that can
[1:22:27.520 --> 1:22:32.400]  take over that slot and that's what the people want now see there you go there
[1:22:32.400 --> 1:22:39.560]  you go again thinking it doesn't work in radio go up and down the dial listen
[1:22:39.560 --> 1:22:45.680]  listen to it it's by design listen listen listen we always get on these
[1:22:45.680 --> 1:22:49.560]  little stations and within a year we have great ratings or the top ratings
[1:22:49.560 --> 1:22:53.560]  and then always ESPN comes in and buys the slot I'm in and just put sports on
[1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:56.600]  and that's the word rather thinking about just replacing rush the sports
[1:22:56.600 --> 1:23:02.520]  entirely that is what I heard from one of my best contacts in the company you
[1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:07.400]  know I worked there for many years I'm this one guy swears they're gonna go
[1:23:07.400 --> 1:23:14.040]  sports good luck so you know they don't care about silence in the voices and I
[1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:17.400]  don't think you should care about them look the only thing we have is our
[1:23:17.400 --> 1:23:22.120]  vote does our vote is fixed now right I only think we have is our vote no the
[1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:26.400]  only thing we have is our money and our time and our life and our soul and I say
[1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:29.840]  this to you folks don't give him your soul don't give him your heart don't give
[1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:36.600]  him your time absolutely them flee from him absolutely it supported a bit of
[1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:41.640]  media let's talk about Trump how he's gonna fight back and I've got word he is
[1:23:41.640 --> 1:23:46.200]  oh wow what what Obama's third administration is now doing going after
[1:23:46.200 --> 1:23:50.520]  guns I said that on purpose the third Obama administration in the early 1990s
[1:23:50.520 --> 1:23:55.600]  it was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World
[1:23:57.320 --> 1:24:02.640]  even before I had access to the show in the mid-1990s I wouldn't solve that movie
[1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:07.200]  but man that looks fun that's to speak out have your own ideas and even if
[1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:10.760]  you're a nerd you're still entertaining because you're real well what do they
[1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:18.320]  say in Wayne's World every day when I cover these huge topics I don't feel
[1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:21.760]  worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge or so real but I'm
[1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:24.640]  trying to tell you the truth I'm trying to get it right and most of time we do
[1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:29.200]  the globalists love lying to you they love manipulating you they enjoy
[1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:34.160]  destroying humanity they enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:38.920]  ignorance against them that for me is really sick dad and disgusting so you've
[1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:44.000]  got a pledge for myself and the whole infowars crew that we will never join
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:47.240]  the globalist we will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're
[1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:52.840]  all in this together I knew Trump was in battle I knew he was surrounded by
[1:24:52.840 --> 1:25:00.160]  cowards and by double-talking agents of the enemy a lot of people just couldn't
[1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:05.680]  believe it right oh no it's 3d chess 5d chess he's invincible and I understand
[1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:08.560]  why people wanted to believe that because this is scary what's going on the
[1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:11.520]  global government the new world order and now that people woke up the fact
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:15.040]  that's real they want somebody to come save them from well Trump sure as hell
[1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:19.480]  tried my gosh look it out prescription drug prices just tripled your quadruple
[1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:23.440]  depending on the drug wants to buy the silent executive order we pay the most
[1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:27.040]  of anybody in the world that's just one case of hundreds of things of the
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:31.240]  trumpet reversed and now people are gonna feel the sting and the pain energy
[1:25:31.240 --> 1:25:34.840]  cost everything else but what's really illustrated this is the trial to the
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:38.960]  Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:42.400]  saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal
[1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:47.640]  activity because the fix is in folks the swamp is deep Trump fought it but it's
[1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:51.800]  up to us to win it we here at info wars are proud to announce the first ever

[1:27:19.720 --> 1:27:25.000]  welcome back man cow is our guest longtime syndicated host back of the day
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:29.080]  syndicated with rush limbaugh I don't the same building good friends and I
[1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:32.480]  don't tell this trump story limbaugh story that cool because I mean to me I
[1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:35.360]  don't want to be associated with the establishment at all Hollywood the big
[1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:38.360]  syndicators any of it and some of my meetings with the big syndicators over
[1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:42.040]  the years I've never talked about because they were off the record meetings but
[1:27:42.040 --> 1:27:46.680]  Roger Ells did reach out to me several times want me to come do pilot shows with
[1:27:46.680 --> 1:27:52.440]  fox and I never did it and and demand cows irritation one of the shows they
[1:27:52.440 --> 1:27:56.160]  wanted me to do was with him which was on fox for a while on the weekends and I
[1:27:56.160 --> 1:28:01.160]  just had small children living in Texas and I just knew they weren't gonna want
[1:28:01.160 --> 1:28:04.680]  me on there I wasn't gonna change what I was gonna say and so I just I passed on
[1:28:04.680 --> 1:28:09.840]  it but then Fox came out like a New York Times article years after that said
[1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:13.920]  Jones begged to be on Fox but Fox didn't want him so there was also the butt
[1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:19.040]  hurtness of them saying that again I wanted to be with them and of course
[1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:22.800]  man cow did men's words on his show was very popular got good ratings but they
[1:28:22.800 --> 1:28:26.280]  didn't end up you know giving him a full-time show as well so I think I was
[1:28:26.280 --> 1:28:30.040]  smart not to do that but that's a that's a true story and he can speak to that
[1:28:30.040 --> 1:28:34.120]  just a moment but but first Trump every time I've talked to Trump almost at the
[1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:37.040]  time he called my wife to congratulate her we got married just randomly it was
[1:28:37.040 --> 1:28:42.520]  crazy oh here's the president was it was Trump is he literally I love rush
[1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:45.640]  limbaugh don't you love rush limbaugh yeah well you know I hear when he
[1:28:45.640 --> 1:28:48.560]  retires or whatever you're gonna take a slot that's what I hear I hear you're
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:51.520]  the heir to rush limbaugh I'm like well I kind of have bigger audiences he ever
[1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:56.680]  had online but he's a trailblazer and so you know obviously info wars what I do
[1:28:56.680 --> 1:29:01.400]  politically would be I'm in that slot I never wanted to be in that slot GCN 24
[1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:04.480]  years ago said the slot we have is during this nobody wants it up against
[1:29:04.480 --> 1:29:07.200]  rush limbaugh and I said great I'll do it you know it's we've been very
[1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:10.360]  successful hundreds of radio stations most of mom and pop but they're great so
[1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:15.400]  there's my two tie-ins but you can vouch for that that Fox wanted me man Cal and
[1:29:15.400 --> 1:29:22.960]  I didn't want Fox correct I I don't know well did I come into the pilot show with
[1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:25.040]  you
[1:29:25.680 --> 1:29:30.400]  little bit now Alex a little bit I had to beg you to get you to come on on the
[1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:36.880]  show you had you had you were done with Fox I don't know what went before that
[1:29:36.880 --> 1:29:43.720]  but by the time I got my TV show you you were you were you didn't like the way
[1:29:43.720 --> 1:29:46.800]  they were going so I don't know what had happened years before that I will tell
[1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:50.000]  you Roger Ailes what a hit job they've done on him what a hit job they're doing
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:53.320]  on Russia I don't think Ailes was a trailblazer and a great guy I'm just
[1:29:53.320 --> 1:29:56.880]  saying I knew Fox wouldn't let me be me that's all sorry no no no I think you're
[1:29:56.880 --> 1:30:02.800]  right and listen I had a show that you were part of and Aisha Tyler and us
[1:30:02.800 --> 1:30:07.240]  half the women that ended up be on the view through a guy named Woody Frazier
[1:30:07.240 --> 1:30:15.640]  we had on Breitbart please the family doesn't appreciate this right after I
[1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:20.840]  talked to his father-in-law Orson Bean who he loved Orson Bean got run over
[1:30:20.840 --> 1:30:25.960]  mysteriously right after I talked with him about what I believe and that is that
[1:30:25.960 --> 1:30:32.080]  Andrew Breitbart was was murdered this is a personal statement of mine but I spoke
[1:30:32.080 --> 1:30:35.440]  with Breitbart a lot but imagine that Alex Jones man cow Breitbart it was all
[1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:40.960]  there and now you talk about kids being born my my daughters were being born and
[1:30:40.960 --> 1:30:49.680]  whatever I went away and I came back and I turned on the back I can't represent
[1:30:49.680 --> 1:30:55.280]  Gwen Beck who had a Christ complex right and I know it's mine I know it's
[1:30:55.280 --> 1:31:00.160]  original and this guy worked on with Philadelphia from Philadelphia TV who
[1:31:00.160 --> 1:31:04.280]  created the term if it bleeds it leads this guy to work with me on this show
[1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:12.040]  and we had all these ideas and I boy I tell you almost rebate him a lot I mean
[1:31:12.040 --> 1:31:15.160]  could be quenches but a lot of them ended up being the Glenn Beck show oh
[1:31:15.160 --> 1:31:19.240]  Glenn Beck on record I had his own employees tell me he had four people
[1:31:19.240 --> 1:31:23.000]  five people that watched me all the time and they would just take it because
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:26.800]  he's an actor yeah so he was stealing from everybody yeah yeah yeah you know
[1:31:26.800 --> 1:31:31.200]  that is the thing too man I so many of these guys you're the real deal people
[1:31:31.200 --> 1:31:34.400]  don't understand your your incredible sense of humor it really bothers me when
[1:31:34.400 --> 1:31:39.120]  people talk to me about you they don't get that he's having fun he's having fun
[1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:43.440]  he can't sit there all day every day and be miserable let them do that let the
[1:31:43.440 --> 1:31:46.280]  left do that let these people that are bashing rush and dancing on his corpse
[1:31:46.280 --> 1:31:50.520]  let them be miserable Alex Jones a happy guy why do you think I mean I I mean
[1:31:50.520 --> 1:31:53.600]  Trump really loved limbo I mean he wouldn't stop talking about him all the
[1:31:53.600 --> 1:31:57.280]  time what was going on there I I want to tell you that probably the most recent
[1:31:57.280 --> 1:32:00.560]  conversation I had with Trump and I don't know what it was can you see that
[1:32:00.560 --> 1:32:03.040]  is that great
[1:32:03.040 --> 1:32:09.840]  hello um yeah anyway no he was he was singing praises of you and me and
[1:32:09.840 --> 1:32:13.240]  Tucker we didn't get into rush but I think he had just given Russia awards so
[1:32:13.240 --> 1:32:19.840]  I mean his his his love of rush was obvious but he also was he I don't
[1:32:19.840 --> 1:32:23.360]  hurt anyone's feelings I know that he really thought that Tucker Carlson was
[1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:29.200]  smart and and he really it really bothered him when Tucker didn't go his
[1:32:29.200 --> 1:32:33.560]  way that I know
[1:32:33.560 --> 1:32:37.960]  I mean Trump Trump really is a big old sweetie pie in the real world I know you
[1:32:37.960 --> 1:32:40.720]  know a lot better than I did but I know people are doing very well he is just a
[1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:45.040]  great guy well look I he got me into a restaurant called Ray Oz in New York

[1:32:58.320 --> 1:33:01.120]  would say we don't need any more politicians we don't need any more

[1:34:21.120 --> 1:34:27.280]  deep-state hit on you guys and it makes me sick and well let me ask you this what
[1:34:27.280 --> 1:34:30.920]  do you think they're gonna do as Trump begins to re-emerge actually like doing
[1:34:30.920 --> 1:34:36.520]  the shoutouts I love all those guys what are they gonna do as as as they just
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:40.520]  get the borders open and they triple the drug prices and the powers going off and
[1:34:40.520 --> 1:34:43.240]  everything's collapsing and and they're calling everyone races and saying
[1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:51.480]  America sucks I mean this sucks the Democrats suck Alex a source told me
[1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:58.520]  that on December 21st of last year there was a an assassination attempt that
[1:34:58.520 --> 1:35:04.280]  got real close to Trump and I am told from my source again take it or leave it
[1:35:04.280 --> 1:35:09.880]  I don't really care at this point in my life but it's an incredible source I mean
[1:35:09.880 --> 1:35:15.680]  one of the best sources you can have secret service I'm not gonna say same
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:19.600]  thing I was told the same thing but this is well this is pretty big news that
[1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:23.160]  nobody's talked about so the 24 service and there's been many attempts that we
[1:35:23.160 --> 1:35:26.040]  don't know about but my understanding is that very close to him and they said
[1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:30.200]  look you're too hot we can't protect you anymore basically the deep-state said
[1:35:30.200 --> 1:35:35.520]  shut up go away or you're dead and your family's dead I don't think we're gonna
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:39.480]  see I well I don't know I think I'm already wrong because I didn't think we
[1:35:39.480 --> 1:35:42.880]  would see a return of Trump and then he showed up at that presidential the
[1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:46.680]  president's day event so I didn't think we'd see him again okay I've been asked
[1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:50.080]  not to say what you just said so now that you said it I'm gonna go ahead and
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:53.840]  bring all this out on the other side well I want to say that's what someone
[1:35:53.840 --> 1:35:57.560]  told me okay I've heard lots of crazy well let me just tell you that you know
[1:35:57.560 --> 1:36:01.040]  they already beat up the source but I'm not going on the record part of the
[1:36:01.040 --> 1:36:04.280]  message was they beat up stones wife in front of her house put her in the
[1:36:04.280 --> 1:36:07.120]  hospital and then I would he was talking about it so later people thought it
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:10.440]  happened like three days later don't happen before and I was told all this by
[1:36:10.440 --> 1:36:14.180]  lawyers in the White House of the assassination attempts of the threats

[1:37:55.580 --> 1:38:03.280]  is all a test this experience this life on this planet is a reckoning it's God
[1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:07.840]  giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension so we can decide
[1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:11.840]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really
[1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:16.120]  does come down to that so as saddest things are and as evil as things are
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:19.960]  look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of
[1:38:19.960 --> 1:38:25.760]  our consciousness God is the author of us having our own will God is the author
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:31.520]  of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing when you look
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:35.520]  at mainstream media in Hollywood this whole evil culture in Washington DC and
[1:38:35.520 --> 1:38:40.760]  Fauci and the and the mass cult it's all about dominating your free will it's all
[1:38:40.760 --> 1:38:44.000]  about telling you you're dirty you're ugly you're in the bath because Satan
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:48.320]  hates you because you're made in the image of God the creator of the universe

[1:40:50.640 --> 1:40:57.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:08.200]  ladies and gentlemen welcome back to Alex Jones show all I've been is
[1:41:08.200 --> 1:41:12.120]  persecuted for supporting President Trump the last six years he is the
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:14.640]  president he didn't get reelected in the landslide all the others are overwhelming
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:18.800]  and I know man Cal only got persecuted for it so a lot of people are like oh
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:22.080]  you're only supporting Trump because you know it's so great for you oh yeah it's
[1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:25.920]  really wonderful to have all these attacks take place and to be deployed
[1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:29.520]  for him and take my bank accounts away so I don't know what man Cal is about to
[1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:32.520]  get into I know that he is friends with Trump I know they reported people tell
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:35.960]  me talk quite a bit I've got a lot of the same info from some other people to
[1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:41.240]  talk to Trump quite a bit and again I've missed calls from the president but I
[1:41:41.240 --> 1:41:44.960]  don't know what this piece of intel is but recap because we hit the break about
[1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:48.680]  what you were told by a White House source about a very serious assassination
[1:41:48.680 --> 1:41:52.800]  attempt on December 21st of last year when you notice Trump suddenly got
[1:41:52.800 --> 1:41:59.160]  really really quiet he went ahead and capitulated and you know the until he
[1:41:59.160 --> 1:42:03.720]  decided I guess to roar back on the 6th and then they were able to basically
[1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:08.200]  sabotage that what was your other big piece of news
[1:42:08.200 --> 1:42:19.240]  this is really dangerous bud I know you were the one of the last guys that
[1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:21.960]  talked to Breitbart I know you know he was really killed as a message to other
[1:42:21.960 --> 1:42:26.640]  people what's what's the news I was probably I may have been the last
[1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:31.760]  person to talk to him because Breitbart had some information and I think it was
[1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:36.240]  pedophile satanic stuff my opinion well he tweeted that he tweeted that
[1:42:36.240 --> 1:42:41.200]  we're done on the Obamas and Clintons but I think he had video that was gonna
[1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:46.120]  ruin everything and I and I believe he's murdered or he went jogging at 2 30 in
[1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:51.800]  the morning now they poisoned his wine I want to tell you that a very good
[1:42:51.800 --> 1:42:56.440]  source of mine there he is God that I love him if you don't know who he is he
[1:42:56.440 --> 1:43:01.240]  created Ariana Huffington in my opinion and really create a lot of what we see
[1:43:01.240 --> 1:43:05.080]  on the internet now there's another trailblazer just like rush that we lost
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:11.000]  and they were dancing on his grave too look I want honesty I want and that's
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:14.960]  what Breitbart and Rush wanted they for the most part truth truth forget party
[1:43:14.960 --> 1:43:23.480]  truth so I want to tell you from my very good source that you talked about the
[1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:28.120]  devil earlier the devil you know the devil knows you're the devil knows
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:33.960]  you're here the devil knows I'm here and I want to say to all those that aren't
[1:43:33.960 --> 1:43:39.880]  facing any challenges nobody cares about you the devil doesn't care about you if
[1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:44.480]  Alex Jones was sitting at home right now drinking a six-pack he wouldn't have
[1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:49.840]  any problems nor would I the minute you step out and try to do good and step up
[1:43:49.840 --> 1:43:56.760]  for God then the devils come out new levels new devils so I'm gonna tell you
[1:43:56.760 --> 1:44:01.280]  something you've probably heard but they were counting really don't want to go
[1:44:01.280 --> 1:44:12.160]  here just say it okay they were counting on you I'm sorry let me let me say
[1:44:12.160 --> 1:44:15.400]  this no I know you're not a bs or so tell me I want to know it's about me
[1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:23.200]  especially very smart of you and they didn't expect it that you said stop no
[1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:29.360]  violence we look we're loves this is a piece of love stop it and when you did
[1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:36.840]  that from my sources the deep state went ah we had him they were they thought
[1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:45.240]  they had you Alex you were done you were set up in my opinion and I know from my
[1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:50.840]  sources that when you told everybody stop step down this is about love and
[1:44:50.840 --> 1:44:55.880]  thankfully somebody filmed it you saved your ass you saved info war and the
[1:44:55.880 --> 1:45:00.840]  movement can continue but boy man what a setup what a fake deal what a fake
[1:45:00.840 --> 1:45:05.000]  operation that whole deal was we know the president now was set up by not the
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:09.480]  secret service they're mostly good but by insiders in the party that told them
[1:45:09.480 --> 1:45:13.880]  there's security and a stage was set up the night before we got there and they'd
[1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:19.480]  remove the stage I mean we were totally set up yeah and notice awesome let me
[1:45:19.480 --> 1:45:22.520]  tell you this notice when they dropped notice man Cal when they dropped the
[1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:26.360]  entire thing last Saturday unexpected without witnesses a week early in the
[1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:30.280]  trial of Trump the second impeachment farce was when Lindsey Graham said what
[1:45:30.280 --> 1:45:33.080]  a pillow so you know when did she know it now we knew that day one they ordered
[1:45:33.080 --> 1:45:36.120]  the police to stand down on array and this globalist general tried to blame
[1:45:36.120 --> 1:45:40.120]  the police they just ordered to go to traffic control so that's starting to
[1:45:40.120 --> 1:45:44.160]  come out that CNN paid the anti for people that it was that they helped
[1:45:44.160 --> 1:45:48.000]  trigger a small number of the group going in and so that's why they ended the
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:52.040]  trial cuz Trump was getting ready to bring that out antivis are modern
[1:45:52.040 --> 1:45:59.720]  brown shirts Alex listen I we should have done this on air what do you think
[1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:03.680]  what do you what are you thinking about what I just told you well I mean I knew
[1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:06.680]  that they were well here's the deal that they told me the secret service Trump
[1:46:06.680 --> 1:46:10.400]  wants you to lead the deal he's gonna announce it he'll meet you there and was
[1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:14.240]  that true it don't want you to do that no no no Trump didn't looked at me and
[1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:16.680]  said I'm gonna be in the March I was right there in the second row he looked
[1:46:16.680 --> 1:46:19.520]  right he goes and leave the March and then the Secret Service was there with
[1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:22.200]  the people they were waving at me that they came over and waved me over and
[1:46:22.200 --> 1:46:25.640]  let me out to go lead the crowd it was all it was all but it wasn't Trump that
[1:46:25.640 --> 1:46:30.200]  it was the insiders that told Trump there was a stage and security and then the
[1:46:30.200 --> 1:46:34.520]  Secret Service stood down was gonna let him go there alone basically and all of
[1:46:34.520 --> 1:46:38.480]  this it was all Trump was totally set up that's why they started the rioting in
[1:46:38.480 --> 1:46:43.480]  the middle of his speech the minute he said I'll meet you at the Capitol all
[1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:47.320]  the guys on earpieces got go messages and they believe they were being
[1:46:47.320 --> 1:46:50.760]  commanded by Trump they're really being commanded by the Democrats in deep state
[1:46:50.760 --> 1:46:55.880]  and that's how they use the Q op to do it is that not sophisticated mind control
[1:46:55.880 --> 1:47:01.240]  yeah brother we I want to pick your brain of a future show about Q I'd like to
[1:47:01.240 --> 1:47:04.880]  figure that whole thing out you know a lot of people thought I was Q I don't
[1:47:04.880 --> 1:47:09.000]  you knew that and then and then you know going back to the 21st as I said my
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:14.520]  December of last year and the the attempt that got close to killing Trump
[1:47:14.520 --> 1:47:17.720]  according to what I've heard the assassination at the gate close and then
[1:47:17.720 --> 1:47:21.480]  Jared got to take over the pardons and that whole thing was a mess but my
[1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:29.160]  sources are also telling me that Jared got very very rich yeah I don't I don't
[1:47:29.160 --> 1:47:32.840]  know what to think of all of that and and yeah a lot of the people close to
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:37.520]  Trump as you said he was too kind everybody thinks he's so such a hard
[1:47:37.520 --> 1:47:42.080]  ass and everything I think he was too kind the whole year's the whole he's
[1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:45.560]  very savvy and smart and good people do what he wants he's a good businessman a
[1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:48.800]  good PR guy but the guy you see this is there you're fired the apprentice that's
[1:47:48.800 --> 1:47:55.880]  not Trump no no it's a TV show it's a TV show well man Cal listen you're always
[1:47:55.880 --> 1:47:58.680]  hard to get on but I know now that you're semi-retired probably about to

[1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:26.920]  tell me Austin has become kind of a liberal a-hole place but only only the
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:29.840]  downtown area in certain corridors I mean I mean you go 10 miles in any
[1:48:29.840 --> 1:48:34.080]  direction you're back in Texas but yeah it's it's bad is Texas done is it should

[1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:41.520]  need all the papers to come to Texas to outnumber the Californians yeah so the
[1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:44.440]  Californians came and they brought their cancer liberalism and now they
[1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:48.520]  destroyed Texas thanks a lot guys thanks for your windmills now we don't have
[1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:53.560]  power and by the way yesterday when I was in the middle of making a great point

[1:50:04.920 --> 1:50:09.320]  guard to smash American gun owners and to try to trigger a civil war people
[1:50:09.320 --> 1:50:14.520]  like they try to take the guns it'll be a war that's the plan folks so we don't
[1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:17.720]  turn our guns in but we don't have a civil war either we've got to educate
[1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:20.440]  people about the globalist trap to have us all kill each other not do it
[1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:24.000]  separately I twisted their arm because they don't have a lot of profit in their

[1:51:05.120 --> 1:51:09.680]  dominating the competition and I advised them they actually asked my opinion

[1:54:10.160 --> 1:54:16.080]  war on corruption Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central we've not been
[1:54:16.080 --> 1:54:22.880]  doing the American Journal the last four days because Austin's very hilly and a
[1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:29.360]  lot of the crew live on hilly areas where you cannot get down them because of
[1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:35.040]  now like a foot of solid black ice I mean it's like crystal blue black ice you
[1:54:35.040 --> 1:54:39.800]  name it I mean it's just thick and it is bad and there's nobody clearing it off
[1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:45.780]  and folks don't have snow plows and I tried to drive up to visit some family
[1:54:45.780 --> 1:54:49.160]  members that needed some help and there were hundreds of wreck cars just in one
[1:54:49.160 --> 1:54:52.480]  area of Westlake just hundreds I mean just wreck cars all up and down these
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:56.520]  hills some roads are blocked and you know here's here's a side issue I'll
[1:54:56.520 --> 1:55:01.520]  talk about when we come back next segment I've grown up in Dallas and Austin I
[1:55:01.520 --> 1:55:04.840]  mean they used to have snow plows needs to have salt salt trucks and all that I
[1:55:04.840 --> 1:55:12.840]  don't see any of them now that's a real real photo we're just showing him let's
[1:55:12.840 --> 1:55:15.480]  go ahead and roll some of this though with the coming protest this Saturday at
[1:55:15.480 --> 1:55:39.320]  ERCOT let's roll that we'll come back from break and I'll give the number out take your calls
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:52.800]  prices on the open market up 10,000% as you hold the state hostage so outside
[1:55:52.800 --> 1:55:57.800]  power groups like vultures like Gendron did can feed on us you thought because
[1:55:57.800 --> 1:56:01.800]  it's been 20 years since Gendron did this to the West Coast you would get away
[1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:08.920]  with this you are not getting away with it you criminal and so coming up that's
[1:56:08.920 --> 1:56:15.840]  Saturday we're going to protest the big tech great recent Democrat Paul Greg Abbott and
[1:56:15.840 --> 1:56:38.760]  dude at the governor's mansion he's essential he's got power and there are 2 p.m. we're coming out here on 290 towards the airport and 7.20 metro center drive to protest the criminals that run ERCOT and have run this scam
[1:56:38.760 --> 1:57:06.040]  I will see all human detections at once this great recent power cut off just like cutting off the T7 pipeline we know they've done it before and they've cut and now the whistleblowers are set to go public that's why they put this public moment in and that's where they get it because the people actually running it don't want to go to prison they want to set her up like Cuomo but she's part of the two you're all going to prison
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:38.440]  this is serious folks this is war they're shutting our energy systems off by design they know what they're doing they're technocrats they think you're just stupid to figure it out figure it out or be overrun starved to death they're about to kill the U.S. dollar they're signaling worldwide that the U.S. is over so at least
[1:57:38.440 --> 1:58:01.720]  once they crash the economy remember who did this to you remember this is war people to sit in a joke notice the globalist criminals ERCOT chairwoman Sally the Democrat Tolbert and their other globalist accomplices whistleblowers inside the organization as well as the EPA and Texas government are prepared to come forward and expose your giant
[1:58:01.720 --> 1:58:15.400]  in wrong style scam you're here by order by we the people to cease and assist your stage blackout designed to condition Americans to accept the great reset and the carbon credit rationing
[1:58:15.400 --> 1:58:39.400]  just as Governor Cuomo will be sent to prison for his crimes against humanity you will be held accountable one last time we are aware of your criminal enterprise to trick the public and accepting smart meter monitoring of thermostats and to jack up power prices as much as 10,000% stop your criminal activity now we the people that are watching all the shows
[1:58:39.400 --> 1:59:07.400]  you cannot hide a grand assault America is about to have his energy cut off its borders destroyed its dollar brought down to nothing all of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team you're about to find out how pathetic you are so I ask all of you who are awake and who love
[1:59:07.400 --> 1:59:35.400]  God stop living in fear the enemy is about to expose itself the enemy can't help itself the enemy comes to kill steal destroy we sit here as good people get upset about that and stop it we should but once it comes through once it hits us once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us we just have to point out we tried to stop it
[1:59:35.400 --> 2:00:03.400]  so prepare yourselves America you're going under judge but just like all the children that were reported this is the truth this is the info war
[2:00:03.400 --> 2:00:13.400]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war on your mind
[2:00:13.400 --> 2:00:23.400]  another example is the array of technologies often referred to collectively as geo engineering that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change
[2:00:23.400 --> 2:00:37.400]  one that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection or SAI a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do
[2:00:37.400 --> 2:00:53.400]  in SAI program could limit global temperature increases reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels this process is also relatively inexpensive the national research
[2:00:53.400 --> 2:01:07.400]  research council estimates that a fully deployed SAI program would cost about $10 billion yearly as promising as it may be moving forward on SAI would also raise a number of challenges for our government and for the international community
[2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:22.400]  on the technical side greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany SAI to address other climate change effects such as ocean acidification because SAI alone would not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere
[2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:35.400]  on the geopolitical side the technologies potential to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions can trigger sharp opposition by some nations
[2:01:35.400 --> 2:01:50.400]  on the geopolitical side the technologies potential to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions at the expense of other regions
[2:01:50.400 --> 2:01:56.920]  CIA director John Brennan six years ago under Obama, but oh, there's no weather weapons
[2:01:56.920 --> 2:01:59.960]  because they don't want you to even know about it with the academic level, the governmental
[2:01:59.960 --> 2:02:04.360]  level, they talk about it like it's the fact that there's a lot of tea in China or the
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:05.360]  sky's blue.
[2:02:05.360 --> 2:02:06.640]  But let's go to the next clip.
[2:02:06.640 --> 2:02:08.320]  Remember, this clip is now getting national attention.
[2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:09.720]  That's why M4s is important.
[2:02:09.720 --> 2:02:15.080]  They've tracked it so many times we break it, we put it out first, and then it goes megaviral.
[2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:18.840]  Same thing now happening with other great folks like Gateway Pundit because, you know,
[2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:22.720]  more and more Breitbart and other things just won't put out a lot of the hardcore stuff,
[2:02:22.720 --> 2:02:23.720]  unfortunately.
[2:02:23.720 --> 2:02:24.720]  I'm not mad at them.
[2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:27.120]  I mean, I wish they'd just do better, but I don't understand the heat they're under.
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:31.720]  But here's the Greens are in Massachusetts saying, you know, that old person down the
[2:02:31.720 --> 2:02:34.080]  street to retiree, we got to break their will.
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:35.080]  We got to cut their power.
[2:02:35.080 --> 2:02:36.760]  And they talk about rolling blackouts.
[2:02:36.760 --> 2:02:39.840]  I'm going to show you articles, by the way, to train you to accept it.
[2:02:39.840 --> 2:02:42.120]  I learned about this 20 plus years ago.
[2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:48.040]  I was on air then and it came out mainstream news that Enron had deployed and developed
[2:02:48.040 --> 2:02:50.920]  the idea for greenhouse gas caps.
[2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:53.880]  They developed the carbon tax model.
[2:02:53.880 --> 2:02:58.720]  And they also proposed the geoengineering you now see going on, but the globalists just
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:01.320]  got rid of that group and took it over for themselves.
[2:03:01.320 --> 2:03:05.760]  And so they're the very ones that recommended rolling blackouts to train you to accept spikes
[2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:07.240]  in power prices.
[2:03:07.240 --> 2:03:13.440]  There's an article from 2002, May 16th, market watch Enron linked to California blackouts
[2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:17.600]  and they did it under orders to then charge people more money.
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:23.040]  And they've been charging up to 10,000% more outside the state to bring power in according
[2:03:23.040 --> 2:03:24.200]  to Reuters.
[2:03:24.200 --> 2:03:29.640]  So billions and billions has been made because the state via ERCOT, the private group, I
[2:03:29.640 --> 2:03:36.840]  have the articles I'll show you coming up, ordered the coal power plants to shut down
[2:03:36.840 --> 2:03:39.120]  for the winter.
[2:03:39.120 --> 2:03:40.120]  You heard me right.
[2:03:40.120 --> 2:03:44.080]  They already shut down over a hundred under Obama, Trump can barely get any new ones open.
[2:03:44.080 --> 2:03:51.280]  They got shut down nationwide and then ERCOT, the new Enron, by the way, it's not just run
[2:03:51.280 --> 2:03:56.480]  by people in Michigan, nothing against Michiganers and people in New York, Germans run it.
[2:03:56.480 --> 2:04:02.480]  It's not even American and all the little power grids, Texas are the best in the country,
[2:04:02.480 --> 2:04:07.360]  were ordered to tie in it and give control to them.
[2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:14.280]  And then Obama, excuse me, his puppet, his mouthpiece, Biden comes out and says, oh,
[2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:15.600]  we're going to federalize Texas.
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:21.240]  It's all their fault and they're from Canada, they're from Germany, they're from all over
[2:04:21.240 --> 2:04:24.240]  and they run the stupid Americans.
[2:04:24.240 --> 2:04:29.920]  So here is the little globalist a few weeks ago now getting attention on Tucker Carlson
[2:04:29.920 --> 2:04:31.560]  saying they're going to break your will.
[2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:32.560]  Here it is.
[2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:37.720]  You know, one thing that we found through our analysis is that 60% of our emissions come
[2:04:37.720 --> 2:04:43.400]  from, as I have been starting to say, you and me, except you guys are in Vermont, 60%
[2:04:43.400 --> 2:04:49.680]  of our emissions come from residential heating and passenger vehicles.
[2:04:49.680 --> 2:04:57.360]  So let me say that again, 60% of our emissions that need to be reduced come from you, the
[2:04:57.360 --> 2:05:02.760]  person of three, the senior on fixed income, right, there is no bad guy left, at least
[2:05:02.760 --> 2:05:08.440]  in Massachusetts, point the finger at, turn the screws on and, you know, break their will
[2:05:08.440 --> 2:05:10.000]  so they stop emitting.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:12.920]  That's you, we have to break your will.
[2:05:12.920 --> 2:05:17.040]  I can't even say that publicly, what I'm trying to say is, yeah, you can't even say
[2:05:17.040 --> 2:05:18.040]  that publicly.
[2:05:18.040 --> 2:05:22.640]  Here, so let's read some of the headlines, I'll give the number on, take your calls.
[2:05:22.640 --> 2:05:27.800]  That climate czar said, we have to break your will to blame the people for needed tax increases
[2:05:27.800 --> 2:05:28.920]  to fight climate change.
[2:05:28.920 --> 2:05:33.440]  So we have to transform our cells for a new green energy that doesn't work.
[2:05:33.440 --> 2:05:38.200]  That's David Ismael, yes, what a nice little person.
[2:05:38.200 --> 2:05:42.520]  He works for John Kerry, California's rolling blackouts were nothing compared to Texas winter
[2:05:42.520 --> 2:05:49.120]  grid milldowns, Facebook blocks, news, government and health updates in Australia, now controlling
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:51.160]  government information.
[2:05:51.160 --> 2:05:53.040]  The government says that they've been hijacked by Facebook.
[2:05:53.040 --> 2:05:55.680]  Oh, that got the wrong stack, I'll cover that later.
[2:05:55.680 --> 2:06:02.520]  Power outages set to continue, ERCOT says, without them, a blackout could last for months.
[2:06:02.520 --> 2:06:06.280]  What did I tell you on Monday and Tuesday and people said, Jones, even my crew said,
[2:06:06.280 --> 2:06:07.960]  Jones, you're going too far.
[2:06:07.960 --> 2:06:08.960]  We guys bring me a pen.
[2:06:08.960 --> 2:06:11.040]  I walked out of the room with my pen.
[2:06:11.040 --> 2:06:12.040]  Thank you.
[2:06:12.040 --> 2:06:13.040]  Maybe a highlighter.
[2:06:13.040 --> 2:06:14.840]  I'm not my regular studio because we're not back in the main studio right now.
[2:06:14.840 --> 2:06:18.760]  It has power, but we've got to reboot a bunch of stuff and it's a big long hassle.
[2:06:18.760 --> 2:06:25.440]  So I'm in the old studio, which I kind of like more roomy actually in here, but, um,
[2:06:25.440 --> 2:06:28.760]  notice I said on Monday and Tuesday, I said, the power is never coming back.
[2:06:28.760 --> 2:06:32.520]  And I said, by that, you're going to pay way more and it's going to be sporadic because
[2:06:32.520 --> 2:06:34.280]  they're training you to have less.
[2:06:34.280 --> 2:06:39.000]  They admitted all I do is read with these jerks.
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:44.960]  And that's putting their fucking pieces of shit assholes, okay.
[2:06:44.960 --> 2:06:49.480]  They are murdering out of control, sick control freaks.
[2:06:49.480 --> 2:06:51.480]  You guys get that delayed?
[2:06:51.480 --> 2:06:52.480]  Good.
[2:06:52.480 --> 2:06:56.280]  I'm not going to do that anymore, but I mean, calling them jerks is not enough.
[2:06:56.280 --> 2:06:57.280]  Okay.
[2:06:57.280 --> 2:07:00.880]  I mean, now they're saying like 50 something people died in Texas because of this.
[2:07:00.880 --> 2:07:06.920]  I mean, they brag in England that they heat all the palaces and castles that the Royals
[2:07:06.920 --> 2:07:07.920]  have.
[2:07:07.920 --> 2:07:09.960]  It's over a hundred of them.
[2:07:09.960 --> 2:07:14.800]  One of them is called Prince Charles's cottage and it's like 50 rooms or maybe bedrooms.
[2:07:14.800 --> 2:07:15.800]  The cottage.
[2:07:15.800 --> 2:07:19.160]  And meanwhile, he's usually even a Transylvania.
[2:07:19.160 --> 2:07:22.160]  He lives in Count Dracula's castle.
[2:07:22.160 --> 2:07:25.040]  By the way, if you're a new listener, I'm not joking about that.
[2:07:25.040 --> 2:07:26.040]  Okay.
[2:07:26.040 --> 2:07:31.280]  He bought Count Dracula's castle, moved into it and cause he's directly related to him.
[2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:36.360]  And then it talks about pensioners, old people get on the buses cause they have heat in the
[2:07:36.360 --> 2:07:38.320]  winter so they don't freeze the death.
[2:07:38.320 --> 2:07:42.440]  And now the government was saying, no, you kick old people off when they have a year
[2:07:42.440 --> 2:07:46.080]  around bus pass and they're allowed to stay on, make them get off after a few stops.
[2:07:46.080 --> 2:07:48.440]  They're not allowed to stay on the bus and live.
[2:07:48.440 --> 2:07:53.720]  So they're freezing old people to death because they've caught off so many of the power plants.
[2:07:53.720 --> 2:07:57.120]  They run off these windmills and then they're saying, oh, natural gas is too expensive and
[2:07:57.120 --> 2:08:02.720]  it was costing something like 4 billion pounds a year or just some, it was years ago.
[2:08:02.720 --> 2:08:10.320]  The number was just stratospheric to heat the palaces, giant palaces with 50 foot ceilings,
[2:08:10.320 --> 2:08:11.760]  hundreds of rooms.
[2:08:11.760 --> 2:08:18.480]  You know, giant palatial facilities, oh yeah, guys, I'm not kidding, type in Prince Charles
[2:08:18.480 --> 2:08:20.200]  Count Dracula and click web.
[2:08:20.200 --> 2:08:22.160]  You'll get guardian AP Reuters.
[2:08:22.160 --> 2:08:26.320]  He says he's directed the Senate of Vlad, very proud of it and actually has moved with
[2:08:26.320 --> 2:08:28.240]  a bunch of orphan boys.
[2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:32.760]  I've seen the article with them, the little kids in the castle and it's like the children
[2:08:32.760 --> 2:08:36.240]  are supplied to him because he lovingly cares for them.
[2:08:36.240 --> 2:08:40.160]  That's the castle and it's him like a little boys putting his arms around him.
[2:08:40.160 --> 2:08:41.720]  And you can't make this up.
[2:08:41.720 --> 2:08:45.120]  His best friend is Jimmy Savell, the child torturer and Satanist who had underground
[2:08:45.120 --> 2:08:47.840]  dungeons where he murdered children and had sex with their dead bodies.
[2:08:47.840 --> 2:08:52.960]  Again, if you're a new listener, I'm not making any of this up.
[2:08:52.960 --> 2:08:57.200]  Prince Charles vampire, links to Count Dracula revealed as Royal Turn 70.
[2:08:57.200 --> 2:08:58.200]  That's the star.
[2:08:58.200 --> 2:08:59.960]  I mean, no, there's guardian articles.
[2:08:59.960 --> 2:09:02.400]  There's PBS documentaries gushing about it.
[2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:06.360]  Look how strikingly handsome he is like Vlad the Impaler.
[2:09:06.360 --> 2:09:11.240]  Here he is the local Transylvanian village, the orphanage where he's taken in the little
[2:09:11.240 --> 2:09:12.240]  boys.
[2:09:12.240 --> 2:09:16.720]  Some of the boys live with him and they say they love him.
[2:09:16.720 --> 2:09:21.040]  There he is with Greta Thumber, completely mentally ill, completely out of her mind.
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:22.840]  Reads office script, totally autistic.
[2:09:22.840 --> 2:09:23.840]  All right.
[2:09:23.840 --> 2:09:24.840]  I'm sorry.
[2:09:24.840 --> 2:09:25.840]  I'm digressing.
[2:09:25.840 --> 2:09:27.040]  I'm going to behave myself.
[2:09:27.040 --> 2:09:31.600]  I'm going to get into the climate news, then I'm going to get into the unraveling of the
[2:09:31.600 --> 2:09:36.160]  Capitol as it comes out that the Democrats staged the whole deal provocateur and that
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:39.600]  feds inside of the few right wing groups that actually broke in.
[2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:40.600]  And it's all coming out.
[2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:41.600]  So just get ready for that.
[2:09:41.600 --> 2:09:42.600]  We'll be right back.
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:43.600]  Stay with us.
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:51.120]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic and making you feel
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:55.880]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[2:09:55.880 --> 2:10:01.560]  made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[2:10:01.560 --> 2:10:07.800]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[2:10:07.800 --> 2:10:09.800]  an entire system.
[2:10:09.800 --> 2:10:12.880]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see
[2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:17.240]  the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty of your
[2:10:17.240 --> 2:10:22.200]  wife or your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music.
[2:10:22.200 --> 2:10:27.120]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself
[2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:29.920]  is what God teaches us is worship.
[2:10:29.920 --> 2:10:34.560]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things in
[2:10:34.560 --> 2:10:40.480]  the system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness
[2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:45.320]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[2:10:45.320 --> 2:10:50.480]  The need for storable foods are increasingly apparent.
[2:10:50.480 --> 2:10:57.760]  With millions left without power, including most grocery stores, many Texas residents
[2:10:57.760 --> 2:11:00.720]  are left without food.
[2:11:00.720 --> 2:11:05.960]  The lines of the grocery stores are getting longer and longer, while most of the store
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:09.000]  shelves are left bare.
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:16.480]  Now we know that in the most historic record freezing temperatures in over a century, your
[2:11:16.480 --> 2:11:24.000]  government can simply turn off the power, turn off the heat, and turn off the water.
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:29.240]  Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family.
[2:11:29.240 --> 2:11:35.840]  Go to infowarstore.com and get at least a year supply of storable foods to make sure
[2:11:35.840 --> 2:11:40.320]  you and your family are prepared for the unimaginable.
[2:11:40.320 --> 2:11:48.240]  Get your storable foods at infowarstore.com.
[2:11:48.240 --> 2:11:55.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:55.240 --> 2:12:06.240]  If you are a TV viewer, you can see me showing you Count Dracula, the direct main heir in
[2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:14.000]  the Royal Bloodline of Count Lydian Paler, the Sax Covert Govo, not British, Transylvanian.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:17.480]  I just don't want to make these claims that sounds insane and not show you.
[2:12:17.480 --> 2:12:18.880]  The mainstream news.
[2:12:18.880 --> 2:12:21.920]  We pull up the mainstream article that he's the main heir to Count Dracula, please, from
[2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:24.320]  the Sunday Express.
[2:12:24.320 --> 2:12:27.000]  Let's show that article for folks on screen.
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:28.440]  It was on the computer right in there.
[2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:30.960]  I just had it pulled up during the break.
[2:12:30.960 --> 2:12:36.520]  And then let's go ahead and, oh yes, here they are introducing them to Count Dracula.
[2:12:36.520 --> 2:12:40.680]  And then let's go ahead and show the articles I pulled up for you during the break, guys.
[2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:45.240]  And that is him with the orphans that live with him and hug him and love him and that
[2:12:45.240 --> 2:12:47.000]  visit him at the castle.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:50.280]  Vladimir Paler, how Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth related to him.
[2:12:50.280 --> 2:12:52.280]  Yeah, that's not the one we just pulled up.
[2:12:52.280 --> 2:12:53.280]  There it is.
[2:12:53.280 --> 2:12:58.480]  Prince Charles' Family Tree, how Prince Charles is actually heir to Dracula's Bloodline.
[2:12:58.480 --> 2:12:59.480]  Thank you.
[2:12:59.480 --> 2:13:00.480]  That's what I wanted to show.
[2:13:00.480 --> 2:13:05.000]  Now, we also found him with the orphaned children that come and stay with him.
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:11.480]  There it is, revealed, touching story behind Prince Charles' affectionate hug with schoolboy.
[2:13:11.480 --> 2:13:16.560]  And it says, well, these boys know him, they come and visit him and then stay at the castle
[2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:17.560]  Dracula.
[2:13:17.560 --> 2:13:23.320]  I'm going to say that again, they stay at Castle Dracula.
[2:13:23.320 --> 2:13:28.720]  And what did Brown Stoker write, a hundred something years ago, back when you couldn't
[2:13:28.720 --> 2:13:31.720]  put reality out, you'd get killed, you could put it as fiction.
[2:13:31.720 --> 2:13:40.360]  He said that the head of the satanic order came from Transylvania to England and buried
[2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:45.600]  itself under Carfax Abbey and took over the Church of England and that was a count, was
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:51.480]  royalty, and that was going around stealing babies to feed it to his mistresses of the
[2:13:51.480 --> 2:13:55.240]  night that they were having blood rituals, drinking the blood of babies.
[2:13:55.240 --> 2:14:02.120]  Well, that's what, on record, Jimmy Savelle, the best friend of Prince Charles, the highest
[2:14:02.120 --> 2:14:06.200]  security clearance you can get in the United Kingdom and the British Empire.
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:11.480]  He had the highest security clearance that even real James Bond, you know, 007 MI6 agents
[2:14:11.480 --> 2:14:12.480]  cannot even get.
[2:14:12.480 --> 2:14:19.720]  He had a higher security clearance than only the royal, he had the groom of the stool certificate.
[2:14:19.720 --> 2:14:26.320]  They didn't call it that in modern parlance, but usually the ex-checkerhead or one of the
[2:14:26.320 --> 2:14:29.840]  top government ministers would wipe the butt of the king or the queen because they had
[2:14:29.840 --> 2:14:33.920]  to wear these big, giant flowing robes, you know, that's what they called it, you know,
[2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:38.400]  a stool, it looks like a stool you sit on, and then this would be the person that lovingly
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:44.600]  would wipe the butt of the king or the queen, I'm not joking, and so you have to understand
[2:14:44.600 --> 2:14:51.200]  that the groom of the stool for Prince Charles, we put up Jimmy Savelle police.
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:55.560]  I didn't mean to go off into this today, but we should understand, Prince Charles admits
[2:14:55.560 --> 2:14:58.440]  he's running the great race, said he wants to starve you to death, he wants to exterminate
[2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:04.360]  the third world, and he is literally the heir to Count Dracula, and then they put it into
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:11.760]  a fiction, Bram Stoker did, where he explains who really runs England 150 years ago, was
[2:15:11.760 --> 2:15:17.240]  this group, now there he is, the highest security clearance in the UK to be able to go into
[2:15:17.240 --> 2:15:22.400]  any royal quarter at any time, no one can stop him, he has a secret badge that gives
[2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:28.640]  him entrance into the Queen of England's bedroom at night, this I give you is Renfield Super
[2:15:28.640 --> 2:15:35.400]  Supremus, back on screen please, Super Supremus Renfield ass wiper of Prince Charles, literally,
[2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:41.640]  literally, and they're always digging up dead children all over the grounds of the area,
[2:15:41.640 --> 2:15:47.280]  so those look like nice fellows to you, there's Prince Charles in a moment of not putting
[2:15:47.280 --> 2:15:52.640]  on his friendly act, but actually getting the Dracula smile going, and let me tell you,
[2:15:52.640 --> 2:15:58.080]  I'm sure it's quite a smile, it would put the Joker to shame, and it's what victims
[2:15:58.080 --> 2:16:04.360]  see, so I just thought we'd spend a little bit of time talking about who's running,
[2:16:04.360 --> 2:16:09.920]  the whole great reset, and who the little Romanian children run up in the street and
[2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:12.400]  thank, and I mean it's like, why were all these children, because they didn't find
[2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:16.760]  the one I found, it's like 20 children is hugging him and worshiping him and rubbing
[2:16:16.760 --> 2:16:23.280]  all over the little boys, and it's said, oh they go and stay with him at the castle,
[2:16:23.280 --> 2:16:31.400]  by themselves with the Count Dracula, the little children stay with Count Dracula, and
[2:16:31.400 --> 2:16:36.920]  then pull up Jimmy Savelle had secret dungeons where he murdered and tortured children and
[2:16:36.920 --> 2:16:41.120]  delivered them to British Prime Ministers, and I remember David Eich was the first person
[2:16:41.120 --> 2:16:46.320]  to say that Jimmy Savelle, because he worked at BBC when Savelle was there 30, 40 years
[2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:50.760]  ago, Eich's old, and Eich was like the top TV host, by the way, he had like a morning
[2:16:50.760 --> 2:16:54.280]  show and a night time show, he was like the top host in the UK, and he's like, they're
[2:16:54.280 --> 2:16:58.320]  a bunch of devil worshipers, they're a bunch of pedophiles, and you know, blah blah blah,
[2:16:58.320 --> 2:17:01.120]  and I've had this vision, and I've got to expose them, and he was kind of getting the
[2:17:01.120 --> 2:17:06.400]  downloads, he seemed a little crazy, but Don't Prophets always seemed crazy up front, and
[2:17:06.400 --> 2:17:12.560]  boom, but he told me on the show like 20 years ago about Lord Heath, and his thing was little
[2:17:12.560 --> 2:17:15.480]  girls though, most of them like to rape little boys, and they would leave him like a little
[2:17:15.480 --> 2:17:20.200]  70 year old girl was his favorite, little pigtails, and they'd lay out plastic in there, and she'd
[2:17:20.200 --> 2:17:24.880]  come in and stand, she'd be a little orphan they brought in, and then she would stand
[2:17:24.880 --> 2:17:28.840]  right there, yeah, and Jimmy Savelle would deliver the orphan children, and then he would
[2:17:28.840 --> 2:17:33.960]  pull out a double-edged dagger, he would walk behind her, slit her throat, and then masturbate
[2:17:33.960 --> 2:17:37.680]  while she flopped around dying, he didn't even have sex with her, he would just masturbate
[2:17:37.680 --> 2:17:45.200]  while they gulped and flopped around in blood spray, so it's all extremely liberal, extremely
[2:17:45.200 --> 2:17:52.960]  trendy to understand the finer things of spirit cooking, but you will my prettys, so now you
[2:17:52.960 --> 2:17:57.040]  know why they want to turn your power off, now you know why I don't want any discussion,
[2:17:57.040 --> 2:18:01.880]  CNN's always, there's no pedophilia, there's no corruption, there's nothing bad happening,
[2:18:01.880 --> 2:18:08.560]  there's nothing going on, just everything is fine, everything is honky-dory as they
[2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:15.960]  say in the old pig Latin, so then you learn that Renfield is not a fictitious character
[2:18:15.960 --> 2:18:24.560]  but is an archetype of the servant of the dragon, the dragon of the Bible, the devil,
[2:18:24.560 --> 2:18:31.520]  Satan, the one chained to this planet, alright, now I'm going to stop now, and I said I'd
[2:18:31.520 --> 2:18:36.680]  hit all the, turn the power news off, and General Iyeray's plan to wage total war against
[2:18:36.680 --> 2:18:40.560]  you for the dragon, the dragon will overcome the saints for only for a small period of
[2:18:40.560 --> 2:18:45.960]  time, all of that is going to be coming up, but let's just give the number out and take
[2:18:45.960 --> 2:18:49.440]  calls first, you can talk about the power outages, you can talk about General Iyeray
[2:18:49.440 --> 2:18:53.000]  openly preparing to purge gun owners and say they're going to have a glorious war and take
[2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:57.000]  our guns and take our children and put them in reeducation camps, the head of PBS and
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:19:00.600]  all of it, and it's all coming out, I mean what do you think of that, pretty fabulous,
[2:19:00.600 --> 2:19:04.560]  huh, they're going to have false flags to get that job done, and that's what's coming,
[2:19:04.560 --> 2:19:09.640]  so how do we stop those, what do we do, it's all coming up today on this Thursday, February
[2:19:09.640 --> 2:19:16.600]  18th, Global Transmission, ah, I'm going to take a breath, so as we do this important
[2:19:16.600 --> 2:19:22.160]  work here, I want to hear from you on any subject, all I ask is that you be a first
[2:19:22.160 --> 2:19:25.840]  time caller and you don't need to thank me, like Drush always said, Ditto's, and we'll
[2:19:25.840 --> 2:19:29.040]  just move on to the next person, I don't want to sound rude or curt, I just, I've got to
[2:19:29.040 --> 2:19:41.040]  get to you, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, and we're not going to have an old ancient
[2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:45.360]  castle that's a thousand years old, we're not going to have children over in the dark
[2:19:45.360 --> 2:19:49.080]  night, we're not going to hire people that have dungeons with dead children in them,
[2:19:49.080 --> 2:19:52.320]  we're just going to fight for the Lord and fight for goodness and fight for freedom and
[2:19:52.320 --> 2:19:56.200]  fight for our right to defend ourselves as the crime rate doubles in the country, murder
[2:19:56.200 --> 2:20:01.520]  rate 30% plus up, and the Democrats have giant armed camps and armed guards, tax payers expense
[2:20:01.520 --> 2:20:06.280]  but want our guns, we're just going to just, just get ready and gear up because the forces
[2:20:06.280 --> 2:20:12.480]  of Satan are energizing to just cut our power off, kill the dollar, flood the border, shut
[2:20:12.480 --> 2:20:16.840]  everything down, tell us we're non-essential and just rape the living hell out of us because
[2:20:16.840 --> 2:20:22.360]  they are under dragon command, Prince Charles runs the whole show, Bill Gates is under
[2:20:22.360 --> 2:20:26.920]  him, Klaus Schwab is under him, Jean-Claude Hunker is under him, all the royalty of the
[2:20:26.920 --> 2:20:33.720]  world, give him fealty and a yearly ritual of satanic power, and now he's coming to kill,
[2:20:33.720 --> 2:20:53.200]  Prince Charles, Prince Dracula, may he burn in hell forever in the High Noon Son of Christ.
[2:20:53.200 --> 2:21:11.240]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened, because we are effective,
[2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:21.240]  the great awakening is here, go to banned.video, download the videos and share, support the
[2:21:21.240 --> 2:21:41.640]  information war at infowarstore.com, and never give up the fight.
[2:21:41.640 --> 2:21:47.200]  Infowars.com I knew Trump was in battle, I knew he was surrounded
[2:21:47.200 --> 2:21:54.600]  by cowards and by double talking agents of the enemy, and a lot of people just couldn't
[2:21:54.600 --> 2:22:00.120]  believe it, they're like oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible, and I understand
[2:22:00.120 --> 2:22:03.320]  why people wanted to believe that, because this is scary what's going on with the global
[2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:06.720]  government and the New World Order, and now that people hold up the fact that that's real,
[2:22:06.720 --> 2:22:11.080]  they want somebody to come save them from, well Trump sure as hell tried, my gosh look
[2:22:11.080 --> 2:22:15.240]  it out, prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled, depending on the drug wants
[2:22:15.240 --> 2:22:18.840]  to buy the sign of that executive order, we pay the most of anybody in the world, that's
[2:22:18.840 --> 2:22:23.000]  just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed, and now people are going to
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  feel the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything else, but what's really illustrated
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:32.600]  this is the trial to the Senate, where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting
[2:22:32.600 --> 2:22:38.040]  him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity,
[2:22:38.040 --> 2:22:42.880]  because the fix is in folks, the swamp is deep, Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win
[2:22:42.880 --> 2:22:43.880]  it.
[2:22:43.880 --> 2:22:50.880]  The resistance.video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video,

[2:23:02.280 --> 2:23:08.000]  band.video, and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned, that's why every
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:15.640]  month we launch a new URL before they ban it, but Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists
[2:23:15.640 --> 2:23:24.320]  are on our tail, but the new website is theresistance.video, the resistance.video, they're trying to
[2:23:24.320 --> 2:23:29.640]  block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them, so the new URL that links
[2:23:29.640 --> 2:23:34.240]  right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special
[2:23:34.240 --> 2:23:41.240]  reports and all the suppressed information is at theresistance.video, share the link,

[2:26:57.040 --> 2:27:00.800]  where do we begin, look I need to go to your phone calls, I did a lot of preparation this
[2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:05.800]  morning and I've always crashed the surface of the news but your calls are most important
[2:27:05.800 --> 2:27:13.640]  so, China's in the news admitting they have weather control, that's mainstream news, not
[2:27:13.640 --> 2:27:16.360]  just the former head of the CIA admits it, now they're bragging they can control the
[2:27:16.360 --> 2:27:21.040]  weather but you're not allowed to know that this is going on, you dumb Americans, so we've
[2:27:21.040 --> 2:27:26.600]  got all of that, they basically say within a few years they'll have total weather control
[2:27:26.600 --> 2:27:30.960]  over China, which again affects all the other countries but we're not allowed to admit
[2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:34.680]  we've been doing it forever because well, the news said it doesn't exist like world
[2:27:34.680 --> 2:27:39.760]  government or the great reset, so we've got that type of news here and just really important
[2:27:39.760 --> 2:27:44.840]  stuff about these power outages and how they admit it's by design and a plan, it's not
[2:27:44.840 --> 2:27:48.200]  incompetence ladies and gentlemen and then I told you they're going to want to federalize
[2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:51.960]  the grid, they're going to want to put control thermostats and all your houses that are remote
[2:27:51.960 --> 2:27:56.520]  control that are already in most houses via the smart meters and the actual controllers
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:00.520]  on the walls and now they announce it all today, I have literally probably 30 articles
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:04.200]  the guys printed because I knew it was there, I just said just print where they blame Texas
[2:28:04.200 --> 2:28:06.880]  and print where they say they got to control your thermostat and stop it, they're like
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:10.880]  yeah there's like hundreds, which ones you want, I just print 30 of them, you know, just
[2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:15.280]  30, I didn't even know they were saying that, I knew they were, see, I mean because folks
[2:28:15.280 --> 2:28:21.760]  it's the same damn thing, it's like how did you know you got a Labrador puppy and it would
[2:28:21.760 --> 2:28:26.640]  be a great swimmer and like to retrieve things, I'm like what they do, I mean the globalists
[2:28:26.640 --> 2:28:32.160]  do this crap over and over again and that's what's so frustrating to me is their blood
[2:28:32.160 --> 2:28:36.440]  drinking, shalt, rape and devil worshipers at the top with a bunch of dumb order followers
[2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:40.840]  under them that treat us like animals and our Christian ancestors organized, stood against
[2:28:40.840 --> 2:28:45.280]  it and halfway fixed it and we created incredible prosperity, everybody wanted to come here
[2:28:45.280 --> 2:28:48.960]  where there wasn't some castle on the hill with a crazy man that grabbed kids at night
[2:28:48.960 --> 2:28:49.960]  and ate them.
[2:28:49.960 --> 2:28:55.000]  You think those fairy tales all over the world, no matter where, oh don't get, I mean in ancient
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:58.640]  China they said don't get near the castle, they'll kill you because that's who's in
[2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:05.520]  the damn castle, do you want to get near Kim Jong Un's castle, what do you think happens?
[2:29:05.520 --> 2:29:11.960]  They are evil, they are inbred psychos and you start breeding psycho after psycho together
[2:29:11.960 --> 2:29:17.200]  you get inbred lunatic maniacs, I don't care if they're black, white, I don't care if they're
[2:29:17.200 --> 2:29:22.080]  Asian, it's the same thing, the Aztecs started interbreeding, created a lunatic group at
[2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:28.600]  the top, so many of these cultures have done it and what you create is a hyper-pregnancy
[2:29:28.600 --> 2:29:37.880]  power-editory maniac demon, all right, enough of me, we've got Joe and Preston and Sunshine
[2:29:37.880 --> 2:29:44.040]  and Tom and Andrew and Colin and Steve and Joe and Sarah and Michael, let's go ahead
[2:29:44.040 --> 2:29:49.320]  and talk to Sunshine and Ostecus, the blizzards back and they're saying the blockouts may
[2:29:49.320 --> 2:29:53.520]  last a month or just forever, it's just get used to it, it's for the earth, what are they
[2:29:53.520 --> 2:29:59.440]  calling it, they're calling it the climate lockdowns, yes, there's Prince Charles' father,
[2:29:59.440 --> 2:30:05.000]  a very friendly person, would you like to have over baby sitting, here, let's go ahead
[2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:07.800]  and go to Sunshine, Sunshine, welcome.
[2:30:07.800 --> 2:30:13.640]  Sunshine, oh my god, yes, hi Alex, I love you so much, I'm a super fan, oh my goodness,
[2:30:13.640 --> 2:30:17.520]  well I'm a fan of you, thanks for getting on the air, what's your view on the situation,
[2:30:17.520 --> 2:30:20.360]  on our little Lord Ercott, the little baby Enron?
[2:30:20.360 --> 2:30:25.480]  Oh my god, listen, it's all a scam, like, okay, I'm a millennial, first and foremost,
[2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:31.240]  I am a biracial, I want to say the race force fake, I want to say Alex Jones is not a racist,
[2:30:31.240 --> 2:30:32.240]  okay, we love him.
[2:30:32.240 --> 2:30:36.120]  Well, I am a racist, I'm pro-human race, I'm actually pro-human.
[2:30:36.120 --> 2:30:44.040]  Hey, all lives matter, let's go, let's get it straight, okay, anyway, so like, I have
[2:30:44.040 --> 2:30:48.480]  not been on TikTok, but I just made a TikTok and I started posting, I saw this thing where
[2:30:48.480 --> 2:30:52.560]  they were taking the snow and like trying to light it on fire and like to see if it
[2:30:52.560 --> 2:30:56.840]  would melt like normal snow, I tried it out, oh my god, this horrible chemical smell was
[2:30:56.840 --> 2:31:02.520]  coming from the snow, it's totally fake, it's like this weird, like mystery material, like
[2:31:02.520 --> 2:31:06.320]  I don't know all the particulars, but like I just know all about like CERN and how they're
[2:31:06.320 --> 2:31:10.680]  you know, manipulating weather, and oh my god, it's insane, like they have like covered
[2:31:10.680 --> 2:31:14.680]  the sun out, so if this stuff won't melt, I can't get my car out, I have a rear-wheeled
[2:31:14.680 --> 2:31:19.400]  drive car, I've been stuck for four days, I went through that whole ordeal with my snow.
[2:31:19.400 --> 2:31:24.000]  Well, let me say this, weather modification is as real as a heart attack, it's giant,
[2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:27.720]  all these big governments are doing it, and then we've had all this unusual weather on
[2:31:27.720 --> 2:31:31.520]  the West Coast, we've talked to meteorologists there, they believe that they artificially
[2:31:31.520 --> 2:31:35.760]  blocked the water, Russia believe they were under weather attack a few years ago, China
[2:31:35.760 --> 2:31:39.440]  admits they're controlling weather, and you don't normally see Arctic blasts like this
[2:31:39.440 --> 2:31:44.720]  coming down this far, and they can use HAARP, they can use HAARP to actually direct these
[2:31:44.720 --> 2:31:47.200]  jet streams and these solar vortexes.
[2:31:47.200 --> 2:31:52.040]  And I'm just like, I'm seeing it firsthand, you know, like actually living through this,
[2:31:52.040 --> 2:31:56.120]  not just reading about it, and I'm just like, oh my goodness, this is the start, the freaking
[2:31:56.120 --> 2:32:01.680]  New World Order, the great reset, you know, it's all a scam, all garbage, like I'm not
[2:32:01.680 --> 2:32:06.720]  standing for it, I am trying to like, you know, awaken other people like me, and you
[2:32:06.720 --> 2:32:12.000]  know, I support you so much, love your show, it's fantastic, you crack me up, you tell
[2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:18.120]  the best jokes, I am just like laughing my butt off, sorry, I had to catch myself there,
[2:32:18.120 --> 2:32:20.560]  you know, like, oh my goodness, I just, I'm so happy about it.
[2:32:20.560 --> 2:32:24.520]  The sunshine, you got the right, right, right name, you are just bubbling sunshine, just
[2:32:24.520 --> 2:32:27.840]  make me happy talking to you, call us again, we love you, and we appreciate you, and have
[2:32:27.840 --> 2:32:28.840]  a great day.
[2:32:28.840 --> 2:32:32.600]  Let me tell you what's going on with the snow folks, is there chemicals in the air?
[2:32:32.600 --> 2:32:36.600]  Are we, were the jet stream out of China, dumps in over Texas, unfortunately?
[2:32:36.600 --> 2:32:39.840]  Is there a lot of toxic stuff, is there geoengineering going on, absolutely, but let me explain
[2:32:39.840 --> 2:32:45.640]  what's happening with propane fire, that's in a, or butane, that's in a water, it doesn't
[2:32:45.640 --> 2:32:50.120]  have a heat level to actually make all the ice dissipate, if you put that same snow in
[2:32:50.120 --> 2:32:55.160]  a pot, put it under gas flame, it'll completely melt, and you'll have clean water, there'll
[2:32:55.160 --> 2:32:58.920]  probably still be some chemicals in it, because the atmosphere is so, so, so toxic, and they,
[2:32:58.920 --> 2:33:03.440]  they say, oh, the problem is carbon dioxide, let's pay on that, but that's actually good,
[2:33:03.440 --> 2:33:07.920]  but, but the way that works is, is the snow is inflaked, so it's not compacted, as soon
[2:33:07.920 --> 2:33:13.680]  as you start burning it, all it does is melt into the ice, and it concentrates it, so you've
[2:33:13.680 --> 2:33:16.800]  got to go ahead and finish melting all the way down in the pot to do that, that's the
[2:33:16.800 --> 2:33:20.280]  most viral videos out there, is everybody saying the snow is fake, I can tell you it's
[2:33:20.280 --> 2:33:27.720]  not fake, stop putting chemicals in the air that make the snow gay, ah, the snow's gay,
[2:33:27.720 --> 2:33:33.040]  stop it, the snow's gay, they're controlling it, Bill Gates is making the snow gay, and
[2:33:33.040 --> 2:33:40.240]  it's white, so it's racist, racist, oh, that was a fake rant, and no, the snow's not gay,
[2:33:40.240 --> 2:33:42.520]  but that'll be mean treasure.
[2:33:42.520 --> 2:33:48.800]  I sell supplements for two reasons, because they work, they're real, they're powerful,
[2:33:48.800 --> 2:33:53.640]  and because it's a giant market, but again, why is there a giant market?
[2:33:53.640 --> 2:33:58.800]  Because it works, that's why it exponentially grows, so whether it's saupon meadow and other
[2:33:58.800 --> 2:34:07.320]  key ingredients in our prostate formula, prostate guard, or whether it is the super high grade
[2:34:07.320 --> 2:34:14.480]  organic vitamin B12 and ultra 12, or whether it's the PQQ and the CoQ10 and DNA force,
[2:34:14.480 --> 2:34:20.280]  or the pure deep breath crystal iodine and X2, these are all the very best supplements
[2:34:20.280 --> 2:34:25.920]  you're going to find in already great market of high quality products out there, and it
[2:34:25.920 --> 2:34:29.920]  funds the InfoWare, so even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're

[2:35:08.960 --> 2:35:12.840]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you, because
[2:35:12.840 --> 2:35:16.600]  these topics are so huge or so real, but I'm trying to tell you the truth, I'm trying to
[2:35:16.600 --> 2:35:18.200]  get it right, and most of the time we do.
[2:35:18.200 --> 2:35:23.840]  The globalists love lying to you, they love manipulating you, they enjoy destroying humanity,
[2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:28.640]  they enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[2:35:28.640 --> 2:35:33.240]  That for me is really satan, and disgusting, so you've got to pledge for myself and the
[2:35:33.240 --> 2:35:39.080]  whole InfoWare's crew that we will never join the globalists, we will never knowingly manipulate
[2:35:39.080 --> 2:35:43.240]  you, because we know we're all in this together.
[2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:49.400]  Finally, we're seeing major state governments in the United States running TV and radio
[2:35:49.400 --> 2:35:56.400]  ads saying, everybody, take your vitamin D3, take your zinc and take your C, it's essential
[2:35:56.400 --> 2:36:01.120]  for your body cells to maintain your health, essential means you must have it.

[2:37:34.040 --> 2:37:37.160]  that's pretty much everybody who gives it 5 stars, except maybe 1 or 2 people, Patriot
[2:37:37.160 --> 2:37:47.160]  Blend 100% organic coffee only available at infowarsstore.com, you're listening to the
[2:37:47.160 --> 2:38:10.520]  Alex Jones show.
[2:38:10.520 --> 2:38:16.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, okay this is enough, I made the joke about gay
[2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:23.760]  snow and I guess they found, they searched the term gay snow and that's what it is, I
[2:38:23.760 --> 2:38:29.600]  mean obviously I was talking about the chemicals in the water that do make the frogs become
[2:38:29.600 --> 2:38:34.800]  by sexual, I guess you'd say, oh they don't want the females anymore, so they try to fertilize
[2:38:34.800 --> 2:38:39.240]  non-existent eggs and then they die, and the globalists do promote homosexuality so that
[2:38:39.240 --> 2:38:42.600]  people don't have children anymore, that's why they promote it, I don't hate the individual
[2:38:42.600 --> 2:38:47.400]  people that are involved in those things, I'm not a hateful person, but I will tell
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:51.040]  you it is designed to make sure that you're married to the state and married to the system
[2:38:51.040 --> 2:38:55.120]  and it is a globalist ploy to end the family unit and now the whole liberal movement is
[2:38:55.120 --> 2:38:59.560]  attacking the family and is attacking young handicapped boys, telling them they're transgender
[2:38:59.560 --> 2:39:03.920]  is part of a larger sterilization project and that's come out even in the British Parliament,
[2:39:03.920 --> 2:39:08.120]  so the whole vehicle of oh we're for rights in America and we're for rights in the west
[2:39:08.120 --> 2:39:12.680]  is being used against us and then when China runs death camps, Joe Biden goes, that's just
[2:39:12.680 --> 2:39:16.240]  cultural to run death camps and put Christians and Muslims and Buddhists in camps, so that's
[2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:20.360]  like yeah, that's a cultural thing and you know, general idea array that wants to have
[2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:26.360]  war with the American people, he just thinks that's fine too, they're sellouts hiding their
[2:39:26.360 --> 2:39:30.440]  tyranny and their authoritarianism by claiming they're fighting racism all day and it's
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:35.280]  disgusting and it's very, very see-through, okay, I only got to one call last segment,
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:39.320]  that's not good but she was a good caller, let's go ahead and just go through your calls
[2:39:39.320 --> 2:39:44.720]  quickly now, Joe in Indiana, you're on the air, go ahead.
[2:39:44.720 --> 2:39:52.400]  I would like to promote amendment number nine and amendment 10 to the Constitution and
[2:39:52.400 --> 2:40:00.840]  as a former resident of Texas with five native born Texas children, I have a connection and
[2:40:00.840 --> 2:40:04.640]  a heart for the people in Texas that are suffering right now.
[2:40:04.640 --> 2:40:10.400]  Now, no one can show me in the Constitution where it says that the federal government
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:19.040]  has the right to turn off the power and shut down power plants nor touch the second amendment,
[2:40:19.040 --> 2:40:26.440]  it says shall not be in print and both the ninth and tenth amendment end up saying that
[2:40:26.440 --> 2:40:30.600]  these are rights retained by the people.
[2:40:30.600 --> 2:40:35.560]  Well, you're right, the ninth and tenth amendment point out that all rights that are not even
[2:40:35.560 --> 2:40:39.640]  expressly stated still exist and are reserved by the people and you're absolutely right.
[2:40:39.640 --> 2:40:42.720]  I mean, for those that don't know, they admittedly turned the power off, they admittedly had
[2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:46.720]  plenty of power, they did this literally to jack up prices and to create a crisis to
[2:40:46.720 --> 2:40:50.760]  make Texas look bad and that the feds come in and take it over and put smart meters in,
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:51.760]  you're totally right.
[2:40:51.760 --> 2:40:55.800]  So, Texas uses to declare the tenth amendment, New Hampshire has it in its Constitution, it's
[2:40:55.800 --> 2:41:00.440]  called the right to revolt and all we've got to do is say we're not part of your system
[2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:04.720]  and that means you've got to kick ERCOT that's a bunch of globalists out of the control,
[2:41:04.720 --> 2:41:06.120]  they are the problem.
[2:41:06.120 --> 2:41:12.480]  Thank you very much for bringing that out and underscoring it.
[2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:19.160]  Now the Texas state legislature has been good about a lot of things, but the Texas state
[2:41:19.160 --> 2:41:30.840]  legislator needs to take the forefront in a great war against tyranny and pass a law,
[2:41:30.840 --> 2:41:37.280]  a resolution saying that we are, Texas is a tenth amendment state.
[2:41:37.280 --> 2:41:41.320]  I totally agree and for those that don't know, coal is so great, it's so clean, there's so
[2:41:41.320 --> 2:41:42.320]  much of it.
[2:41:42.320 --> 2:41:46.000]  You can put little coal stations all over in power, little neighborhoods, big cities,
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:50.520]  small towns, then if they want to tie into a larger grid in agreements to share power,
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:53.680]  but then when they need it, they can dial back and keep their power.
[2:41:53.680 --> 2:41:58.640]  Under ERCOT, we went under like California's been done for 30 years, the control of a private
[2:41:58.640 --> 2:42:03.200]  multinational group is playing all sorts of games and our prices have exploded, the quality's
[2:42:03.200 --> 2:42:07.360]  gone down and this is how these guys do it, it's dirty pool, just like they rig the stock
[2:42:07.360 --> 2:42:13.280]  market with flash trading and instant trading, they're doing the same damn thing right now.
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:21.400]  Just tell it like it is, we're dealing with criminally insane traders, they are worse
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:24.400]  than traders, they're satanists.
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:28.080]  They are and imagine for them, when they see an industry that's running and good, they
[2:42:28.080 --> 2:42:31.640]  just go let's just screw that over and steal that, that's easy and so they make money out
[2:42:31.640 --> 2:42:34.480]  of fraud, that's how you get a third world country.
[2:42:34.480 --> 2:42:42.400]  Sir, I truly appreciate you giving me the opportunity to express these things and I know that you're
[2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:46.920]  a 10th amendment man, and the 9th amendment is just as important.
[2:42:46.920 --> 2:42:50.920]  Now tell folks about the 9th amendment that don't know, guys pull up both the 9th amendment
[2:42:50.920 --> 2:42:54.480]  because those are both, those are just as important as the 2nd amendment, the 1st.
[2:42:54.480 --> 2:43:02.400]  Yes, it says the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:09.400]  deny or disparage other rights retained by the people.
[2:43:09.400 --> 2:43:14.320]  Oh my gosh, I appreciate your call sir, God bless you, look, put that back on screen,
[2:43:14.320 --> 2:43:18.680]  I told you there's hundreds of these, so many, I've probably seen a hundred today, Texas
[2:43:18.680 --> 2:43:23.040]  sucks, Texas isn't exceptional, they're a bunch of idiots and there it is, opinion,
[2:43:23.040 --> 2:43:29.160]  it's time to bury the myth of Texas exceptionalism, Jeff Bezos says, so they come in and shut
[2:43:29.160 --> 2:43:34.280]  down over 100 of our coal power plants, make us go off and win meals, then don't winterize
[2:43:34.280 --> 2:43:38.480]  the nuclear power plant, it's ERCOT criminal groups run by a bunch of liberals on record
[2:43:38.480 --> 2:43:44.160]  and then they blame us, they blame us just like they're blaming the power outage on using
[2:43:44.160 --> 2:43:48.720]  too much power or everybody turned their faucets on, that's why we ran out of water, no, the
[2:43:48.720 --> 2:43:54.560]  power went out of the damn water treatment plants, that's why there wasn't water.
[2:43:54.560 --> 2:44:03.120]  People need to tell Biden, the criminal and the federal government that we don't have
[2:44:03.120 --> 2:44:10.240]  to listen to them, that his executive orders and their evil machinations of EPA and all
[2:44:10.240 --> 2:44:16.600]  the rest, it can't find it in the Constitution and our rights are retained.
[2:44:16.600 --> 2:44:20.680]  You're absolutely right, God bless you, we can't let them hold this hostage, they're
[2:44:20.680 --> 2:44:25.240]  going to all make it about how ERCOT's idiots and how Texas are idiots, this was a globalist
[2:44:25.240 --> 2:44:29.120]  operation, we told you it was coming, they've done it in California, I have all the articles
[2:44:29.120 --> 2:44:35.320]  in Ron linked to California blackouts that's 18 years old where it was all documentaries
[2:44:35.320 --> 2:44:40.920]  were made, books were written, they did it on purpose, they did it on purpose, they did
[2:44:40.920 --> 2:44:44.520]  it, they do rolling blackouts to prepare you for higher prices, now they're announcing
[2:44:44.520 --> 2:44:49.920]  prices up 10,000 times higher, I'm not joking, that's Reuters, thank you, Joe in Indiana,
[2:44:49.920 --> 2:44:55.080]  all right, who's been holding the longest next now, that would be Preston in Pennsylvania,
[2:44:55.080 --> 2:44:56.080]  Preston, welcome.
[2:44:56.080 --> 2:45:01.360]  Hi, thank you for taking my call, I was just trying to brainstorm listening to everything
[2:45:01.360 --> 2:45:07.760]  you said over the last 20 to 30 minutes and I wouldn't see it being a long forethought
[2:45:07.760 --> 2:45:12.200]  to say that, well, the power is already, you know, having rolling blackouts in Texas, why
[2:45:12.200 --> 2:45:17.560]  not, you know, cooperate with other groups like ERCOT and other states and push those
[2:45:17.560 --> 2:45:21.320]  rolling blackouts in the next state to continue this in a forward motion.
[2:45:21.320 --> 2:45:24.960]  Yeah, why don't we give the rolling blackouts to New York run by liberals, I don't want
[2:45:24.960 --> 2:45:27.560]  to hurt the New Yorkers, they need it, but you know what I mean, how about all the rich
[2:45:27.560 --> 2:45:32.040]  areas, instead of those being essential and staying on, all the rich areas staying on,
[2:45:32.040 --> 2:45:36.640]  how about the rich people have their power turned off, okay, and then how about DC have
[2:45:36.640 --> 2:45:39.520]  its power turned off, oh no, they're essential.
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:44.120]  Yeah, I mean, they have it set up right now to where Texas, like you said, they know they're
[2:45:44.120 --> 2:45:48.600]  making Texas escape yoke for all of this, and they could very easily continue using Texas
[2:45:48.600 --> 2:45:53.080]  escape yoke, push this agenda forward and you know, and this and all the other surrounding
[2:45:53.080 --> 2:45:57.880]  states and continue the rolling blackouts from Texas to use Texas escape yoke for it
[2:45:57.880 --> 2:46:02.880]  all, you know, soil Texas name, and then say, okay, yeah, well, now everybody's worried
[2:46:02.880 --> 2:46:05.000]  about power and the cold weather and all that.
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  Now you're not focusing on the COVID, you know, hoax as it is, and all the other politics
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:13.280]  that are going to come out here in the next week or so, we know what the Democrats being
[2:46:13.280 --> 2:46:16.880]  behind the agent for all the tours in DC.
[2:46:16.880 --> 2:46:22.360]  That's right, on the left admits it's a battle to blame Texas, no, you put in the windows
[2:46:22.360 --> 2:46:27.120]  that don't work, you shut down over a hundred Texas plants, we told you it would happen,
[2:46:27.120 --> 2:46:32.120]  you did it, you are the problem, it shut down Spain, Spain has been in a tenured depression
[2:46:32.120 --> 2:46:36.440]  from the damn windmills, they shut all their cold plants off.
[2:46:36.440 --> 2:46:40.800]  I mean, it's a travesty, I mean, and the sad thing is, is that the average person who
[2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:45.360]  just wants to go to work on a Monday or Friday, 40 hour work week, you know, just get by with
[2:46:45.360 --> 2:46:49.960]  the economics, all the bills, now you don't worry about your power being shut off, you
[2:46:49.960 --> 2:46:53.200]  know, not being able to put food on your table for the folks, you know, that can't even go
[2:46:53.200 --> 2:46:57.840]  to the grocery stores, do logistics breakdown, and this is only the beginning if people
[2:46:57.840 --> 2:47:02.360]  don't start to see that, you know, that there are evil people in control and they don't
[2:47:02.360 --> 2:47:05.360]  have the general folks best interests of mind.
[2:47:05.360 --> 2:47:10.200]  They say, Extinction Rebellion Bill Gates, all of them, no more plants, they say get
[2:47:10.200 --> 2:47:13.600]  used to not having power, in fact, they propose that you don't have power for eight o'clock
[2:47:13.600 --> 2:47:17.520]  at night, that they control your thermostat, it's already here, I bless you brother, I
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:19.040]  appreciate your call, great callers.
[2:47:19.040 --> 2:47:22.920]  Okay, I'm gonna start the next hour, take calls again, whole next hour, but I do have
[2:47:22.920 --> 2:47:26.280]  to spend some time at the bottom of the hour, because I promise to just read the headlines
[2:47:26.280 --> 2:47:30.440]  off all these stories, because I mean, I don't just get up here and blame the globalists
[2:47:30.440 --> 2:47:35.280]  and ERCOT for this, but notice the media is like, ERCOT is Texas, because ERCOT, you
[2:47:35.280 --> 2:47:40.960]  know, is the Texas Reliability Program, you look at who bought up our water districts,
[2:47:40.960 --> 2:47:45.320]  who controls everything, and it's these multinational corporations, I mean, hell, the king of Spain
[2:47:45.320 --> 2:47:49.760]  owns our main toll roads, and my whole thing is, what is the king of Spain doing coming
[2:47:49.760 --> 2:47:55.640]  in here, Juan Carlos, and you know, doing all this, so we've been through this, this is
[2:47:55.640 --> 2:48:00.760]  what globalism is, where they own the companies, they own the businesses, they own the banks,
[2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:05.640]  they own the airlines, and they say, we don't care what your president says, you're not
[2:48:05.640 --> 2:48:10.720]  gonna travel, you're not gonna live, you're not essential, and they hold you hostage,
[2:48:10.720 --> 2:48:15.440]  and there's no libertarians are wrong, they're like, hey, privatize everything, the private
[2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:20.960]  monopolies form combines and then create something worse than a Soviet state, so you
[2:48:20.960 --> 2:48:24.200]  gotta have a balance between the two, but you really gotta have informed, vigilant people
[2:48:24.200 --> 2:48:27.200]  that stand up for themselves and say, hell no, well, they're right back with hour number
[2:48:27.200 --> 2:48:32.560]  four, your calls are straight ahead.
[2:48:32.560 --> 2:48:41.240]  The need for storable foods are increasingly apparent, with millions left without power,
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:48.400]  including most grocery stores, many Texas residents are left without food, the lines
[2:48:48.400 --> 2:48:54.240]  of the grocery stores are getting longer and longer, while most of the store shelves are
[2:48:54.240 --> 2:48:56.200]  left bare.
[2:48:56.200 --> 2:49:03.680]  Now we know that in the most historic record freezing temperatures in over a century, your
[2:49:03.680 --> 2:49:11.240]  government can simply turn off the power, turn off the heat, and turn off the water.
[2:49:11.240 --> 2:49:16.480]  Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family, go
[2:49:16.480 --> 2:49:23.240]  to infowarstore.com and get at least a year supply of storable foods to make sure you
[2:49:23.240 --> 2:49:27.560]  and your family are prepared for the unimaginable.
[2:49:27.560 --> 2:49:33.960]  Get your storable foods at infowarstore.com.
[2:49:33.960 --> 2:49:40.920]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[2:49:40.920 --> 2:49:48.240]  that this is all a test, this experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:53.520]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension, so we can decide
[2:49:53.520 --> 2:49:57.800]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to, and it really does come
[2:49:57.800 --> 2:49:58.800]  down to that.
[2:49:58.800 --> 2:50:02.840]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as
[2:50:02.840 --> 2:50:07.120]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:10.720]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[2:50:10.720 --> 2:50:16.320]  God is the author of us having free will, and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[2:50:16.320 --> 2:50:20.520]  And when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington
[2:50:20.520 --> 2:50:25.840]  D.C. and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[2:50:25.840 --> 2:50:29.800]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan hates
[2:50:29.800 --> 2:50:37.080]  you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[2:50:37.080 --> 2:50:50.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:50.760 --> 2:51:13.840]  This is a viral video.
[2:51:13.840 --> 2:51:16.840]  It's already gotten hundreds of thousands of views online, not just at Band-Aid video.
[2:51:16.840 --> 2:51:20.640]  It was put out last night, people are having a fun time with it.
[2:51:20.640 --> 2:51:22.400]  I've gone over to Urquhart in South Austin.
[2:51:22.400 --> 2:51:27.760]  We're going to be protesting on Saturday of this, this inron, globalist German, Canadian
[2:51:27.760 --> 2:51:28.760]  company.
[2:51:28.760 --> 2:51:32.760]  I mean, most people on the border of foreign, we're not just not in Texas, it should be
[2:51:32.760 --> 2:51:37.400]  illegal to be in charge of critical infrastructure and I'm driving back down the access road.
[2:51:37.400 --> 2:51:39.800]  There's a Wendy's over there and everybody's waving.
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:42.800]  Most people like me, but this guy goes, if you I'll kick your ass, stuff like that.
[2:51:42.800 --> 2:51:46.400]  I saw one of you come down here, you know, so I went and parked went over to him, not
[2:51:46.400 --> 2:51:47.400]  to get to fight with him.
[2:51:47.400 --> 2:51:50.000]  I'm like, Hey, big man, get out and tell me where I'm wrong.
[2:51:50.000 --> 2:51:54.120]  He's a Californian with California plates running from the hell that he brought down
[2:51:54.120 --> 2:51:55.120]  with him.
[2:51:55.120 --> 2:51:56.120]  And he's pissed at me because I'm Alex Jones.
[2:51:56.120 --> 2:51:57.120]  Here it is.
[2:51:57.120 --> 2:52:23.120]  All of you know that these lockdowns aren't ever going to end and this is just part of
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:33.280]  the control and until you wake up to the fact that you're under technocracy attack, don't
[2:52:33.280 --> 2:52:40.480]  let your brother, until you wake up to that, it's only going to get worse.
[2:52:40.480 --> 2:52:45.880]  We're not looking for trouble, but I was driving by from the ERCOT place that turned our power
[2:52:45.880 --> 2:52:49.280]  off and the most people were waving at us, they're blisters.
[2:52:49.280 --> 2:52:50.280]  We love them.
[2:52:50.280 --> 2:52:51.280]  This guy jumped out of his car.
[2:52:51.280 --> 2:52:52.280]  He's flipping us off.
[2:52:52.280 --> 2:52:53.280]  I'm not looking for trouble.
[2:52:53.280 --> 2:52:54.280]  I'm going to go talk to him and see if he can actually talk.
[2:52:54.280 --> 2:52:55.280]  Let's go over here.
[2:52:55.280 --> 2:52:56.280]  How you doing, brother?
[2:52:56.280 --> 2:52:57.280]  Good work, man.
[2:52:57.280 --> 2:52:58.280]  We're trying, brother.
[2:52:58.280 --> 2:52:59.280]  Have I met you before?
[2:52:59.280 --> 2:53:00.280]  I don't think so.
[2:53:00.280 --> 2:53:01.280]  We're trying, brother.
[2:53:01.280 --> 2:53:02.280]  Hang on.
[2:53:02.280 --> 2:53:03.280]  How you doing?
[2:53:03.280 --> 2:53:04.280]  Don't bless you, man.
[2:53:04.280 --> 2:53:05.280]  I love you.
[2:53:05.280 --> 2:53:06.280]  Hey, those are cold dogs.
[2:53:06.280 --> 2:53:07.280]  The whole chair.
[2:53:07.280 --> 2:53:08.280]  Remember which one it was?
[2:53:08.280 --> 2:53:09.280]  Oh, yeah.
[2:53:09.280 --> 2:53:10.280]  It's good.
[2:53:10.280 --> 2:53:27.280]  We love you.
[2:53:27.280 --> 2:53:29.280]  Hey, we're here.
[2:53:29.280 --> 2:53:31.280]  Are you able to talk other than your one IQ point?
[2:53:31.280 --> 2:53:33.280]  You like the power cut off?
[2:53:33.280 --> 2:53:35.280]  You like Enron run of these scams?
[2:53:35.280 --> 2:53:36.280]  It's Enron 2.0.
[2:53:36.280 --> 2:53:37.280]  Are you too stupid?
[2:53:37.280 --> 2:53:39.280]  So, here I am.
[2:53:39.280 --> 2:53:44.280]  Oh, you're a big man.
[2:53:44.280 --> 2:53:46.280]  You're a big man.
[2:53:46.280 --> 2:53:47.280]  You like her cut?
[2:53:47.280 --> 2:53:48.280]  You like Enron?
[2:53:48.280 --> 2:53:50.280]  You like old folks freezing to death?
[2:53:50.280 --> 2:53:52.280]  You like being lined up in Wendy's?
[2:53:52.280 --> 2:53:53.280]  You fucking liberal?
[2:53:53.280 --> 2:53:54.280]  You authoritarian?
[2:53:54.280 --> 2:53:55.280]  You're not a liberal?
[2:53:55.280 --> 2:53:56.280]  Check it out.
[2:53:56.280 --> 2:53:57.280]  Come here.
[2:53:57.280 --> 2:53:58.280]  Oh, yeah.
[2:53:58.280 --> 2:53:59.280]  Look at you, man.
[2:53:59.280 --> 2:54:00.280]  Yeah.
[2:54:00.280 --> 2:54:01.280]  You're all, oh, you're so tough.
[2:54:01.280 --> 2:54:02.280]  Look at you.
[2:54:02.280 --> 2:54:03.280]  Hey, you going to take your vaccines?
[2:54:03.280 --> 2:54:05.280]  He's going to get all your little travel passes.
[2:54:05.280 --> 2:54:06.280]  Yeah, you flipped us off.
[2:54:06.280 --> 2:54:08.280]  They're probably lying saying we came over to you.
[2:54:08.280 --> 2:54:10.280]  You flipped us off and you asked for it.
[2:54:10.280 --> 2:54:11.280]  Are you even?
[2:54:11.280 --> 2:54:12.280]  Are you even?
[2:54:12.280 --> 2:54:13.280]  Oh, yeah, you bet.
[2:54:13.280 --> 2:54:14.280]  I questioned public events.
[2:54:14.280 --> 2:54:16.280]  Am I running death camps in China like Apple?
[2:54:16.280 --> 2:54:18.280]  Are you upset about Apple running death camps in China?
[2:54:18.280 --> 2:54:20.280]  Or you like ZZPing?
[2:54:20.280 --> 2:54:22.280]  Get his little snake face.
[2:54:22.280 --> 2:54:24.280]  Look at this guy's snake face, man.
[2:54:24.280 --> 2:54:27.280]  You want to be an intellectual total loser?
[2:54:27.280 --> 2:54:29.280]  And he sits there and acts tough and flips people up.
[2:54:29.280 --> 2:54:33.280]  So, here I am, big guy.
[2:54:33.280 --> 2:54:34.280]  Hey, listen, listen.
[2:54:34.280 --> 2:54:35.280]  I'm not trying to make you fear me.
[2:54:35.280 --> 2:54:36.280]  You're the one flipping me off.
[2:54:36.280 --> 2:54:38.280]  I'm not here warning people about who turned,
[2:54:38.280 --> 2:54:40.280]  you know about Enron, turning the power off
[2:54:40.280 --> 2:54:42.280]  and running blackouts and scams?
[2:54:42.280 --> 2:54:43.280]  Enron?
[2:54:43.280 --> 2:54:45.280]  You don't know what Enron is?
[2:54:45.280 --> 2:54:48.280]  Because you're such a, no, no, because they got caught.
[2:54:48.280 --> 2:54:50.280]  You know what Urcaught is.
[2:54:50.280 --> 2:54:51.280]  Get his face.
[2:54:51.280 --> 2:54:52.280]  Look at him.
[2:54:52.280 --> 2:54:56.280]  He's so stupid, but he thinks he's got a fake degree
[2:54:56.280 --> 2:54:57.280]  or whatever.
[2:54:57.280 --> 2:54:58.280]  He's smart.
[2:54:58.280 --> 2:55:00.280]  Dude, you're a chump of the Chi Cops, man.
[2:55:00.280 --> 2:55:03.280]  And so, hey, hey, you flipped me off.
[2:55:03.280 --> 2:55:04.280]  You jumped out of your car.
[2:55:04.280 --> 2:55:06.280]  I came over here to talk to you.
[2:55:06.280 --> 2:55:07.280]  Here I am.
[2:55:07.280 --> 2:55:08.280]  Okay?
[2:55:08.280 --> 2:55:12.280]  So, I'm here to talk to infowars.com, newswars.com,
[2:55:12.280 --> 2:55:13.280]  and our video.
[2:55:13.280 --> 2:55:15.280]  Here we are fighting, fighting.
[2:55:15.280 --> 2:55:16.280]  Yeah, always fighting Terry.
[2:55:16.280 --> 2:55:17.280]  That's right.
[2:55:17.280 --> 2:55:18.280]  Always going up against the system.
[2:55:18.280 --> 2:55:19.280]  Always fighting for poor people.
[2:55:19.280 --> 2:55:21.280]  Always standing up for energy.
[2:55:21.280 --> 2:55:23.280]  Always standing up for the Republic.
[2:55:23.280 --> 2:55:25.280]  So, you like trying to run into FGFs.
[2:55:25.280 --> 2:55:26.280]  And then Apple loves it.
[2:55:26.280 --> 2:55:27.280]  Yeah, you love it.
[2:55:27.280 --> 2:55:28.280]  You piece of crap.
[2:55:28.280 --> 2:55:30.280]  You got what you wanted, big man.
[2:55:30.280 --> 2:55:32.280]  You got what you wanted.
[2:55:32.280 --> 2:55:34.280]  Yeah, well, they're cut.
[2:55:34.280 --> 2:55:35.280]  That's good.
[2:55:35.280 --> 2:55:37.280]  The video's up on infowars.com.
[2:55:37.280 --> 2:55:39.280]  My point is, they always flip off.
[2:55:39.280 --> 2:56:06.280]  That's all they do.
[2:56:06.280 --> 2:56:32.280]  That's all they do.
[2:56:32.280 --> 2:57:01.280]  That's all they do.
[2:57:01.280 --> 2:57:03.280]  Next we do.
[2:57:03.280 --> 2:57:05.280]  Next, we look at the three times.
[2:57:05.280 --> 2:57:07.280]  I mention, we're into the fourth hour right now.
[2:57:07.280 --> 2:57:08.280]  And Jess is calling in from South Carolina.
[2:57:08.280 --> 2:57:10.280]  Says that they are
[2:57:10.280 --> 2:57:12.280]  a third gen physician.
[2:57:12.280 --> 2:57:13.280]  Has known of deaths from COVID vaccine.
[2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:14.280]  I want to be clear.
[2:57:14.280 --> 2:57:17.280]  If you talk about deaths from the COVID vaccine.
[2:57:17.280 --> 2:57:18.280]  On Facebook, Twitter,
[2:57:18.280 --> 2:57:20.280]  anywhere they'll try to ban you.
[2:57:20.280 --> 2:57:22.280]  Even though, I'm punch-drunk from it.
[2:57:22.280 --> 2:57:27.280]  Every day without looking.
[2:57:27.280 --> 2:57:29.280]  There's like, oh, three people died at this nursing home
[2:57:29.280 --> 2:57:30.280]  after they gave it.
[2:57:30.280 --> 2:57:35.560]  You know, Sweden suspends vaccine after 23 die at one facility and you just
[2:57:36.280 --> 2:57:40.360]  Australia suspends vaccines after death and you just read the stacks of news
[2:57:41.800 --> 2:57:47.800]  But you notice it's always clusters because there's only certain hospitals and nursing homes that have good physicians and good people that report it
[2:57:48.880 --> 2:57:54.120]  And of course, it's very obvious because a lot of these people die very very very quickly
[2:57:54.120 --> 2:58:00.200]  We're talking five ten fifteen minutes. Have I taken others a few hours a day letter a week later?
[2:58:00.960 --> 2:58:03.280]  Ladies you go into a coma have convulsions and die
[2:58:03.960 --> 2:58:09.400]  And again, this is not even a vaccine. It's not it is a genetic therapy India. Just said no
[2:58:09.640 --> 2:58:16.360]  We in trials they did a few illegal studies over there and India said they're illegal and people got really sick and had problems
[2:58:16.360 --> 2:58:21.600]  So India has suspended the Pfizer in RNA gene therapy. It's not a vaccine and
[2:58:21.600 --> 2:58:28.880]  And it's totally experimental. It's saying the present to whatever they want whenever they want South Africa has suspended the mRNA vaccine another type
[2:58:29.400 --> 2:58:35.120]  Again, Australia had their national vaccine. They just been to that one. It's a false HIV positive test and stillnesses and deaths
[2:58:35.960 --> 2:58:40.480]  We have Merck pulling its vaccines a month ago saying that they don't help and that it's all a lie
[2:58:40.480 --> 2:58:45.600]  We have leaked video of Zuckerberg saying that it's experimental and dangerous and he doesn't trust us
[2:58:45.600 --> 2:58:47.760]  But oh if you say that on the platform you're banned
[2:58:47.760 --> 2:58:55.200]  So this is a crazy moment and I appreciate Jess calling in to talk about what they've experienced and what they've seen so Jess
[2:58:55.200 --> 2:58:56.960]  Thank you so much
[2:58:56.960 --> 2:59:01.520]  Hi, Alex. Thank you so much for taking my call. I've actually been trying to get into the last week
[2:59:02.280 --> 2:59:09.560]  This is something that I don't typically do I've never called into a show before and it shows that I'm as impassioned as I am about this subject
[2:59:09.560 --> 2:59:16.240]  That I'm potentially willing to risk my livelihood and potentially my license if someone finds out who exactly I am
[2:59:16.240 --> 2:59:19.680]  So I have to be very careful with the identity under the Hippocratic oath
[2:59:19.680 --> 2:59:24.000]  You have a right to duty. So we appreciate you, but please continue. Thank you. Thank you
[2:59:24.000 --> 2:59:30.280]  So my experience with the COVID vaccine all along. So first of all, I'll give a little background about myself
[2:59:30.280 --> 2:59:33.760]  I won't say exactly what I do because that will give too much identifying information
[2:59:34.320 --> 2:59:36.320]  But I do have an Ivy League education
[2:59:36.480 --> 2:59:39.160]  My medical degree is from an Ivy League Institute
[2:59:39.160 --> 2:59:43.040]  My parents are also Ivy League educated physicians and so is my grandfather
[2:59:43.040 --> 2:59:48.320]  My grandfather was married as they was now because my grandmother unfortunately passed away in the past week
[2:59:48.640 --> 2:59:54.320]  To a woman who has been experiencing dementia for the last two years has been in a care facility
[2:59:54.320 --> 2:59:58.480]  But as otherwise been relatively stable all things considered still holding a conversation
[2:59:58.920 --> 3:00:03.040]  Still able to eat and drink with some assistance. She was vaccinated
[3:00:03.520 --> 3:00:05.520]  unfortunately by my grandfather's wishes
[3:00:06.200 --> 3:00:09.080]  Approximately two and a half weeks ago half of our family
[3:00:09.080 --> 3:00:13.920]  Is lit on what we feel about this vaccine given that one there has been no animal trials
[3:00:14.600 --> 3:00:21.480]  To we all have a very high research background. So we understand the importance of lengthy a vaccine trial
[3:00:21.960 --> 3:00:27.680]  We also understand that our education had pounded into our heads for a decade or more the importance of
[3:00:28.280 --> 3:00:29.640]  experimental trials
[3:00:29.640 --> 3:00:35.720]  Trying it on animals going through different phases to make sure that drugs and vaccines are appropriate for human consumption
[3:00:35.720 --> 3:00:41.520]  Or human administration and I actually remember back in my institute a very poignant sign
[3:00:41.520 --> 3:00:43.680]  Which I'm sure your people can pull up
[3:00:43.800 --> 3:00:51.320]  It was a billboard that was printed into posters that a lot of these universities that did animal research and were frequently boycotted by PETA
[3:00:51.720 --> 3:00:56.400]  By research saves that org a sign that had a picture of a mouse and a little girl on it and said
[3:00:56.760 --> 3:00:58.320]  Well, who would you rather see live?
[3:00:58.320 --> 3:01:03.960]  And that's really the whole purpose of this is to make sure that we are saving humanity and we are protecting humanity
[3:01:03.960 --> 3:01:06.680]  So this is our background. My grandmother was vaccinated
[3:01:06.680 --> 3:01:11.720]  I'm not sure with what vaccine but was vaccinated about two and a half weeks ago within 48 hours
[3:01:11.720 --> 3:01:13.720]  She described signs of lethargy
[3:01:13.960 --> 3:01:18.880]  COVID-like signs and because of that she was put in a word for COVID-like patients
[3:01:18.880 --> 3:01:21.680]  She never tested positive for COVID because of this
[3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:27.760]  She was not allowed appropriate access to food and water and basically start to death and dehydrated to death
[3:01:27.960 --> 3:01:30.640]  Because no one was coming in and feeding and watering her
[3:01:30.640 --> 3:01:35.920]  Eventually she lost the ability to swallow. She aspirated and she died from aspiration pneumonia
[3:01:35.920 --> 3:01:40.080]  I thought that this was potentially a unique situation until I spoke with my co-worker
[3:01:40.440 --> 3:01:45.560]  Who's also a physician whose grandmother went through the same exact situation in another state
[3:01:45.680 --> 3:01:52.360]  My grandmother was in the tri-state area up north. This woman's grandmother was in Virginia the same situation for 12 days
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:58.640]  She was in a COVID ward after she started feeling ill within 24 hours of the first vaccine and she did not eat or drink for 12 days
[3:01:58.640 --> 3:02:00.640]  She basically died from dehydration
[3:02:00.920 --> 3:02:05.740]  You can tell in my voice how impassioned I am about this because this is an absolute utter
[3:02:06.360 --> 3:02:09.400]  Disgusting disgrace that this is what we are doing in medicine right now
[3:02:09.400 --> 3:02:14.840]  But even if the deaths were not specifically from the COVID vaccine that they caused enough side effects
[3:02:14.840 --> 3:02:19.960]  But then put these people in isolation and we thought that it was better to let them die and starve to death
[3:02:19.960 --> 3:02:24.040]  Get to the point where they were no longer able to swallow and aspirate on their own fiddle
[3:02:24.040 --> 3:02:29.000]  Then just let me stop you know, I'm gonna give you the whole next segment because I can tell you for real
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:30.880]  I can tell you know you're dumb up and let me explain something
[3:02:30.880 --> 3:02:39.000]  I'm no rocket scientist, but from Australia to the US the UN said don't let family and friends in and then who gave them the
[3:02:39.040 --> 3:02:43.540]  Directives to then not give these people aid once this happens. This is all a setup
[3:02:43.920 --> 3:02:49.800]  They save 600 million pounds already in the UK denying care to old people now the Guardian reports
[3:02:49.800 --> 3:02:56.040]  They're not giving mentally handicapped people access to regular medicine claiming the hospitals are full when they're not
[3:02:56.040 --> 3:03:01.960]  So this is all an exercise in rationed care aka the death panels Bill Gates talked about. Oh
[3:03:03.120 --> 3:03:05.640]  Absolutely, you know, I will say I'm I'm quite young
[3:03:05.960 --> 3:03:09.400]  I will say that I only recently turned 30
[3:03:09.400 --> 3:03:16.120]  So I've been listening to you through my parents for many many years most of my life and I have tried
[3:03:16.120 --> 3:03:20.120]  All right, quote-unquote to be of what I thought was rational mind for so many years
[3:03:20.120 --> 3:03:25.880]  I have so many things I thought were conspiracy theories death panels. I'm like, okay, you know, that's not totally true
[3:03:25.880 --> 3:03:31.560]  You know, I do know with a ration care to some degree, but I can I I just cannot emphasize
[3:03:31.560 --> 3:03:35.360]  Well, sure, I mean, let's say if there's an earthquake and one person's gonna die for sure
[3:03:35.360 --> 3:03:38.080]  You give the little kid that you can say that's really that's triage
[3:03:38.160 --> 3:03:43.040]  But you don't just say oh cuz the COVID we're not gonna give mentally handicapped people
[3:03:43.040 --> 3:03:46.320]  The aid when your hospitals have empty. It's evil
[3:03:47.600 --> 3:03:50.240]  Absolutely, and you know, at least in my grandmother's case
[3:03:50.360 --> 3:03:55.240]  We had family that was eventually able to go in and be with her in her last moment
[3:03:55.400 --> 3:04:01.840]  In my co-workers case her family was only able to be with her because they fought this facility in Virginia to take her out
[3:04:01.840 --> 3:04:07.240]  It was an incredible struggle to actually take her out of this facility when literally no one was taking care of her
[3:04:07.240 --> 3:04:12.040]  They would put the food and water and her meds in her room, but she was unable to do it herself
[3:04:12.040 --> 3:04:17.000]  She was unable to give her medication or take her food or water, but you know, that's incentivized
[3:04:18.240 --> 3:04:20.240]  They die they get even more money
[3:04:20.960 --> 3:04:22.840]  Absolutely, and so I you know again
[3:04:22.840 --> 3:04:24.520]  I don't want to give out too much information
[3:04:24.520 --> 3:04:31.520]  but my parents are practicing in a very high profile state in the country for between voter fraud and
[3:04:31.760 --> 3:04:36.880]  Medical issues and certain people who are now working for the Biden administration who used to work for their state
[3:04:36.880 --> 3:04:44.560]  And you know my my mother recently retired, but my father's still practicing he tells stories almost every day of people who come in
[3:04:44.560 --> 3:04:48.480]  Who are his patients and they report that they work in care homes
[3:04:48.480 --> 3:04:53.160]  They work in other places in the hospital and they say yeah, we've been seeing people drop like flies
[3:04:53.520 --> 3:04:59.200]  You know overall people in general I think when you actually speak with them and you talk to them about the actual fact
[3:04:59.640 --> 3:05:03.520]  They seem to open up and and I had a situation actually at work
[3:05:03.520 --> 3:05:09.920]  Where I you know lost it on it took a treatment floor and I started talking about how you know, we're all scientists here
[3:05:09.920 --> 3:05:12.920]  We should understand that something that has been created in less than a year
[3:05:12.920 --> 3:05:19.600]  It doesn't follow with the the acceptable pattern of how we created drugs and vaccines over the years and yet
[3:05:19.600 --> 3:05:25.880]  We're taking these without without animal trials. We are don't hang up just come back and keep laying this out
[3:05:25.880 --> 3:05:28.840]  But again, it's all pre-program. It's lockstep. It's the UN
[3:05:28.840 --> 3:05:36.440]  That's why it's all standardized worldwide to overthrow the checks and balances to overthrow the Hippocratic oath to overthrow medical testing to overthrow
[3:05:36.440 --> 3:05:43.280]  due diligence and to remove doctors and nurses from having any decision-making capacity because you see doctors and nurses on TV
[3:05:43.560 --> 3:05:46.000]  criticizing COVID the saying it's exaggerated
[3:05:46.760 --> 3:05:53.240]  Putting out treatments that work they're being banned and they say because only the United Nations is allowed to tell us with their
[3:05:53.240 --> 3:06:01.000]  Horrible record and the head of the WHO with what he did in Africa covering up over a million dead there from cholera and more
[3:06:01.600 --> 3:06:06.200]  Which a lot of that it shows they did on purpose. These are sinister eugenicists
[3:06:06.640 --> 3:06:13.720]  China had the one-child policy killed probably a hundred million of their girls the numbers vary folks. This is a eugenics plan
[3:06:14.280 --> 3:06:19.560]  We're gonna come back with Jess who's a medical doctor until she issues we've talked about you hear that passion
[3:06:19.560 --> 3:06:25.280]  Yes, she signed up for this to help people not kill him. All right, we'll be right back with Jess and then after that segment
[3:06:25.280 --> 3:06:30.000]  We'll talk to everybody else Sarah Michael David Collin Andrew Steve
[3:06:30.800 --> 3:06:32.800]  Carlos we're gonna talk to everybody stay with us
[3:06:40.200 --> 3:06:43.920]  The entire new motor system is about making you feel pathetic
[3:06:43.920 --> 3:06:51.120]  I'm making you feel weak making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of
[3:06:51.120 --> 3:06:58.560]  God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will being given free will being given consciousness is
[3:06:59.240 --> 3:07:02.680]  Literally the seed of an entire universe an entire
[3:07:03.280 --> 3:07:08.440]  System and the fact that you're able to commune with God the fact you're able to see the beauty of the sunset
[3:07:08.440 --> 3:07:14.880]  Or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty of your wife your husband the beauty of your child learning knowledge
[3:07:15.040 --> 3:07:19.640]  The beauty of music the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is
[3:07:19.920 --> 3:07:24.280]  Energetic and that itself is what God teaches us is worship
[3:07:24.480 --> 3:07:27.520]  So don't worship the globalist don't worship the NFL
[3:07:27.600 --> 3:07:29.520]  Don't worship all the things of the system
[3:07:29.520 --> 3:07:36.000]  But worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:38.360]  While you still have it while you still have it
[3:07:39.480 --> 3:07:41.840]  My enemies are your enemies
[3:07:42.560 --> 3:07:44.560]  They're the globalist third extremists
[3:07:44.760 --> 3:07:49.040]  They're a consortium of bad scientists pedophiles control freaks devil worshipers
[3:07:50.400 --> 3:07:52.400]  Vampires wherever you want to call them
[3:07:52.560 --> 3:07:54.560]  That are highly predatory
[3:07:54.960 --> 3:08:01.040]  that are setting up a false famous you land system of constant bombardment of propaganda drugs and
[3:08:02.240 --> 3:08:04.240]  electromagnetic radiation
[3:08:04.240 --> 3:08:10.760]  To change the very DNA of the human species to mutate us into a form that they can control
[3:08:11.120 --> 3:08:13.120]  Like a pawn on a chessboard
[3:08:13.600 --> 3:08:16.840]  the bottom line is they want to play God they are playing God and
[3:08:17.800 --> 3:08:20.600]  The news is only going to tie it around our necks from here on out
[3:08:20.960 --> 3:08:27.280]  So many other people want to be positive they want to put out fake news and when I only covered limited amounts of what's happening with
[3:08:27.280 --> 3:08:31.960]  New World Order, but at the end of the day, it's all about the population. It's all about world government
[3:08:31.960 --> 3:08:38.520]  It's all about the end of human system as we know it and on its ashes the nightmare being built only admitting it can turn around stop
[3:08:42.200 --> 3:08:45.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:08:45.040 --> 3:08:47.040]  I
[3:09:01.720 --> 3:09:06.760]  Tomorrow I want to do this for a while. I'm gonna open up the entire broadcast all four hours
[3:09:07.400 --> 3:09:11.680]  To just take phone calls from medical personnel doctors
[3:09:12.840 --> 3:09:14.200]  nurses
[3:09:14.200 --> 3:09:20.560]  Nurse practitioners and others and and also family members can call in and what they've experienced because here's the deal
[3:09:20.560 --> 3:09:24.240]  We have a major aging population one of the oldest in the world other than like Italy or Japan
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:30.200]  And they don't want to pay out all the money people put into the system Bill Gates has said that the banks have said it
[3:09:30.280 --> 3:09:32.960]  So in the last year's lockdown or so
[3:09:33.280 --> 3:09:37.400]  They've saved hundreds of billions of dollars on non-essential medical care as they call it
[3:09:37.400 --> 3:09:40.360]  Which a lot of it was essential and millions of died just the US of cancer
[3:09:40.360 --> 3:09:47.280]  Heart attacks and other things that went untreated that's been admitted same thing in Europe not just to mention the lockdown causing starvation in the third world
[3:09:47.880 --> 3:09:51.240]  Where a lot of folks been half their income on on just food
[3:09:51.240 --> 3:09:54.440]  So suddenly they're not working again at a say a flower farm
[3:09:54.640 --> 3:09:59.800]  It's one of the biggest things in Africa is growing flowers for people in Europe in the US. You just go home and you start to death
[3:09:59.800 --> 3:10:03.400]  That's how it works like oh you got kids. There's no welfare. You just go home and you die
[3:10:03.600 --> 3:10:08.720]  You know you get malnourished a virus comes by and you know you lose your kids or you die yourself
[3:10:08.720 --> 3:10:14.680]  That's how it works. So it's very Malthusian. It's very cold-blooded and it's being done by the left telling us
[3:10:14.680 --> 3:10:19.960]  How good they are and how great they are. This is not liberal ladies and gentlemen. This is authoritarian. It's hitlerian
[3:10:19.960 --> 3:10:23.520]  It's very dangerous and it'll bite all of us in the ass as well
[3:10:23.840 --> 3:10:26.320]  God's real will be judged for it, but also just
[3:10:26.720 --> 3:10:30.600]  Reveal you so you let this type of evil grow. It's gonna hurt you too. So
[3:10:31.240 --> 3:10:34.600]  We're losing our soul right now, but I don't just have to believe this medical doctor
[3:10:34.600 --> 3:10:39.840]  I already know this and I'm not pooping her calling in. You hear her upsetness. You hear her passion
[3:10:39.840 --> 3:10:43.800]  That's normal if you're not a psychopath or a sociopath and so
[3:10:44.280 --> 3:10:49.800]  But I can pull you up the British Ministry of Defense came out a month ago two months ago and said do not take it of your over
[3:10:49.800 --> 3:10:55.020]  75 we're seeing a lot of people die and by the way, we're seeing a lot of miscarriages. Don't take it of your
[3:10:55.520 --> 3:10:57.920]  below 16 or if you're pregnant and
[3:10:57.920 --> 3:11:03.840]  And literally you try to post that on Facebook. They'll ban it. So doc, we appreciate you
[3:11:03.840 --> 3:11:06.480]  We appreciate your passion. Please continue to lay this out
[3:11:06.480 --> 3:11:10.560]  And what happens when you point this out to your colleagues that or to the nursing homes
[3:11:10.560 --> 3:11:17.520]  You're not supposed to give this to above 75 because clearly of the mRNA Pfizer shots killing people in England and the UK
[3:11:17.520 --> 3:11:23.760]  You shouldn't be doing it here, too. I mean ask them like why did India just say no on this? I mean, I mean, what's going on here?
[3:11:23.760 --> 3:11:30.960]  Yeah, it's very it's very interesting that you say that because I think a lot of the hesitancy with medical professionals
[3:11:31.360 --> 3:11:35.040]  Not speaking out more is this general group saying policy
[3:11:35.040 --> 3:11:38.920]  I again, I don't want to say what colleges my family belongs to
[3:11:39.240 --> 3:11:43.440]  But our journals come out and that don't mostly anymore are about
[3:11:43.960 --> 3:11:52.480]  Trans rights social justice issues access to care not about the actual, you know field in and out exactly all the fluffy fake liberal stuff
[3:11:52.480 --> 3:11:55.200]  Is is the divert from the reality of real science?
[3:11:56.160 --> 3:12:02.960]  Absolutely, and so, you know, that's what we're being bombarded with and I feel like especially us younger people think that that's what we have to think
[3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:07.120]  We have to be in lockstep with these authorities. I will say though. I was very proud
[3:12:07.120 --> 3:12:13.320]  It was with support staff that wasn't necessarily my you know boarded colleagues, but with my support staff when I said look
[3:12:13.320 --> 3:12:19.560]  I just I'm not anti-vaccine. I walk around with a laminated card with all my vaccines on there in case something happens to me
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:23.720]  However, I am anti something that has not been tested appropriately
[3:12:23.960 --> 3:12:28.360]  You know, I'm a Trump supporter and I was not happy with the fact that we were ramming through
[3:12:28.600 --> 3:12:33.280]  This vaccine quote-unquote is just an experimental biologic in such a short period of time
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:37.400]  And it was it was interesting to hear them say it was almost like you just feel this
[3:12:37.400 --> 3:12:41.720]  I really can say you know what I've been having misgivings about this
[3:12:41.720 --> 3:12:47.680]  But I've been too afraid to talk about it people that I work with are afraid to talk about it because they're afraid they're gonna be
[3:12:47.680 --> 3:12:52.200]  Fired from being go and you engage in leadership Jess, which is beautiful
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  Exactly, please continue
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:13:02.680]  Yeah, and I would say overall my other point that I wanted to meet is you know for people who aren't physicians or are in the medical field
[3:13:02.840 --> 3:13:06.640]  Please I encourage everyone to speak up. I encourage people to look things up
[3:13:06.640 --> 3:13:11.640]  I did want to bring up something that is very important and tangible and veterinary medicine with our experience
[3:13:11.880 --> 3:13:16.440]  Out of myself with our experience with a coronavirus vaccine, which I'll bring up in a second
[3:13:16.440 --> 3:13:20.760]  But but please don't don't just look at your doctors and nurses and you know
[3:13:20.760 --> 3:13:27.000]  healthcare professionals as as the absolute authority because not everyone actually knows that the studies here
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:33.280]  I speak with plenty of people who are what I would consider to be brilliant people who act like they're brainwashed
[3:13:33.280 --> 3:13:35.280]  I hate using that term because it's used too much
[3:13:35.280 --> 3:13:38.560]  But they they're completely brainwashed when you actually talk to them about well
[3:13:38.560 --> 3:13:42.400]  Have you actually read what the studies were for these vaccines? Did you know that there were no animal trials?
[3:13:42.400 --> 3:13:48.400]  Did you know that it has this high rate of side effects? They actually don't know these things
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:51.760]  That's right. And we've been told don't ask questions by big tech
[3:13:52.040 --> 3:13:56.240]  But then we get Zuckerberg in a private conversation saying I don't trust this
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:14:01.360]  Right, right. So it's very important to you know, I hate it such a such a
[3:14:01.720 --> 3:14:04.880]  2021 he kind of thing do your own research, but it's absolutely true
[3:14:04.880 --> 3:14:08.920]  And even if what you're seeing maybe not the full truth at least you're expanding your mind now
[3:14:08.920 --> 3:14:13.600]  One thing I did want to bring up which I think is important and I haven't really heard many people talk about this is
[3:14:13.840 --> 3:14:19.400]  The feline infectious peritonitis vaccine that was created in veterinary medicine back in the 70s 80s
[3:14:19.400 --> 3:14:26.680]  There's been published research since that time about this vaccine coronavirus in animal patients and specifically in cast
[3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:30.120]  There are many different types of coronaviruses that attack different systems
[3:14:30.120 --> 3:14:33.840]  This one is a gut coronavirus, which is something that happens normally in the wild
[3:14:33.840 --> 3:14:39.800]  There is a mutation a genetic mutation the spontaneous random mutation that we don't really know what triggers it
[3:14:40.200 --> 3:14:44.540]  But it causes disease called feline infectious peritonitis, which interestingly enough
[3:14:45.120 --> 3:14:50.960]  Causes basically these high acute phase proteins, which means that your body goes under an entire inflammatory cascade
[3:14:51.360 --> 3:14:57.880]  cytokine storm and depending on what form of FIP you get you either die within a couple weeks or die within a couple months
[3:14:57.880 --> 3:15:00.280]  This is this has been cast and so
[3:15:00.280 --> 3:15:07.640]  They're trying to make a vaccine specifically against this genetic mutation of the coronavirus that would be taken to feline infectious peritonitis
[3:15:07.640 --> 3:15:13.480]  And they failed they use it on many different cast and if you actually look at the research it says
[3:15:13.920 --> 3:15:20.320]  That we made this vaccine. We thought it was going to induce immunity and instead it induced sensitivity
[3:15:20.320 --> 3:15:24.760]  And that is very similar to what we're seeing with these coronaviruses vaccines now
[3:15:24.760 --> 3:15:30.840]  And take your time and explain that because I'm not a medical doctor like you and I read Wolfgang Wood-Args report and that former
[3:15:30.840 --> 3:15:32.600]  Chief Scientist and I'm trying to understand it
[3:15:32.600 --> 3:15:35.560]  But it says could turn your immune system way up could turn it down
[3:15:36.440 --> 3:15:38.440]  You can do all this stuff
[3:15:38.600 --> 3:15:43.360]  Right and with this particular vaccine when I say that it induced sensitivity and not immunity
[3:15:43.360 --> 3:15:48.920]  It was actually creating the virus. It was causing the mutation in these feline patients
[3:15:48.920 --> 3:15:56.400]  So we were giving cats who didn't have this mutation or that we knew up again. We don't know genetically if they were pre-proposal or not
[3:15:56.760 --> 3:16:00.160]  Sure, but they gave the vaccine and then and then the cells replicated it
[3:16:00.760 --> 3:16:06.760]  Yes, and it induced feline infectious peritonitis and and I have personal experience with this and a personal cat
[3:16:06.760 --> 3:16:11.760]  And we remember back in the 90s when this happened if we called down to a university to talk to them about it
[3:16:11.760 --> 3:16:15.440]  They said we actually don't give this vaccine anymore because we think it causes a fight
[3:16:15.440 --> 3:16:20.400]  Well, here's an example. Jess Adkins was an award-winning vet. I think he's still employed. I worked for him in high school and
[3:16:21.280 --> 3:16:24.800]  He would like advise people they tell him here for my cats yearly vaccine
[3:16:25.080 --> 3:16:28.800]  Especially cats he said but dogs he only did small animals like one day a week
[3:16:28.800 --> 3:16:34.480]  He'd have lines out of his clinic. He mainly the industrial, you know big artificial insemination and all this stuff in cows and horses
[3:16:34.760 --> 3:16:38.360]  And cloning was already starting to come along and he did some cloning work
[3:16:38.360 --> 3:16:43.880]  But that was separately at A&M that he would go like one day a month and work at A&M like secret cloning stuff
[3:16:43.880 --> 3:16:47.600]  But well, let's just say he didn't talk about it, but he said oh man
[3:16:47.600 --> 3:16:51.720]  I believe in vaccines you can learn immunity from these because they're so tainted
[3:16:51.720 --> 3:16:56.400]  They've got such so many side effects that I noticed people's cats and dogs die when they take vaccines every year
[3:16:56.400 --> 3:16:58.160]  And he would tell people just don't take them
[3:16:58.160 --> 3:17:02.760]  So I mean he was just seeing the animals get sick and and and and understanding it
[3:17:03.800 --> 3:17:05.800]  Yeah, you know, they're yeah
[3:17:07.000 --> 3:17:12.640]  Again without getting into too much detail. I mean there are certain vaccines that cause more of it in response than others
[3:17:12.640 --> 3:17:16.000]  But don't hang up don't hang up do five more minutes to explain this cat thing
[3:17:16.000 --> 3:17:21.360]  Because I remember reading this but I don't remember the details and I want to look into it do a whole show because that's huge
[3:17:21.360 --> 3:17:23.800]  That's what I've read these medical reports
[3:17:23.800 --> 3:17:27.800]  They're worried that it's going to create this protein in the cell then when the cell dies
[3:17:27.960 --> 3:17:32.400]  It's going to release it as me an autoimmune response. Is that what you're getting at? We'll be right back stay with us
[3:17:32.400 --> 3:17:41.120]  Just as a medical doctor the New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world
[3:17:41.720 --> 3:17:46.160]  government, but world government is only the control grid now
[3:17:47.200 --> 3:17:53.240]  Intermembers of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality
[3:17:53.240 --> 3:17:59.920]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based line forms
[3:17:59.920 --> 3:18:07.640]  That's why they say carbon is bad. They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet. They are playing God
[3:18:08.080 --> 3:18:14.400]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[3:18:14.960 --> 3:18:19.480]  To carry out this transformation. I know this sounds insane
[3:18:19.480 --> 3:18:25.240]  But if you read the writings of the globalist, it's all on record. You have been warned
[3:18:25.240 --> 3:18:29.960]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan
[3:18:30.120 --> 3:18:36.760]  This is the end of all life on earth as we know it. This is the alien takeover of earth. I
[3:18:37.480 --> 3:18:42.240]  knew Trump was in battle. I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by
[3:18:43.240 --> 3:18:45.240]  double-talking agents of
[3:18:45.240 --> 3:18:47.120]  the enemy a
[3:18:47.120 --> 3:18:51.680]  Lot of people just couldn't believe it. They're like, oh, no, it's 3d chess 5d chess
[3:18:51.680 --> 3:18:55.760]  He's invincible and I understand why people are to believe that because this is scary
[3:18:55.760 --> 3:19:00.320]  What's going on the global government the new world order it now that people woke up the fact that's real
[3:19:00.320 --> 3:19:04.720]  They won't somebody to come save them from well, Trump sure as hell tried my gosh
[3:19:04.720 --> 3:19:10.520]  Look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled depending on the drug once by the sign that executive order
[3:19:10.880 --> 3:19:12.400]  We pay the most of anybody in the world
[3:19:12.400 --> 3:19:17.040]  That's just one case of hundreds of things of the trumpet reversed and now people are gonna feel
[3:19:17.040 --> 3:19:23.560]  The sting in the pain energy cost everything else, but what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate
[3:19:23.760 --> 3:19:30.800]  Where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity
[3:19:31.440 --> 3:19:36.880]  Because the fix is in folks the swamp is deep Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it
[3:19:36.880 --> 3:19:42.200]  We told you it was coming under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore for eight months
[3:19:42.200 --> 3:19:49.920]  They've made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that makes them a social distance and report them back to cell towers attractor every movement
[3:19:49.920 --> 3:19:51.920]  This is for everybody the way it gets better
[3:19:52.200 --> 3:19:59.240]  Now France has programs in their factories government push and sponsor to make everyone wear actual dog collars
[3:19:59.240 --> 3:20:04.840]  They can make you social distance and report back to simple computers. They're turning us into a commodity
[3:20:05.120 --> 3:20:08.800]  Human animal clones have been around for 50 years. It's all being announced
[3:20:08.800 --> 3:20:15.160]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete and big corporations downplay that they own us
[3:20:15.160 --> 3:20:19.840]  With these gene therapy systems and patents that they produced do you understand?
[3:20:19.840 --> 3:20:25.200]  It is a takeover of the entire species of the genetic level and now they're coming with dog collars
[3:20:25.200 --> 3:20:28.560]  And they're announcing in public schools in the US starting next year
[3:20:28.560 --> 3:20:34.120]  It will begin did you hear me dog collars for your children all based on a hoax all based on a lie
[3:20:34.120 --> 3:20:39.040]  Imple Wars continue to spread the word to fight back
[3:20:40.040 --> 3:20:42.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:20:51.320 --> 3:20:55.960]  All right, I'm gonna finish up with this doctor and I'm gonna get to every one of these great collars that is holding
[3:20:55.960 --> 3:20:57.760]  But this is a very important call
[3:20:57.760 --> 3:21:01.400]  And you know, I just scratch around and try to read all the literature and figure out what's going on
[3:21:01.400 --> 3:21:03.400]  I see a lot of top scientists
[3:21:03.400 --> 3:21:09.980]  Very respected people medical doctors urologist epidemiologists and saying you might as well kill yourself you take this that we
[3:21:10.440 --> 3:21:16.040]  And I've talked to some of these guys off record. I talked and I've told this story. I wish I could get the guy on there
[3:21:16.040 --> 3:21:17.040]  He won't do it
[3:21:17.040 --> 3:21:18.360]  um
[3:21:18.360 --> 3:21:22.840]  But he started telling my lawyers about it and they told me about it and then we talked to him and
[3:21:23.200 --> 3:21:27.720]  He's the head of a major biotech company and he said months ago. This is deadly. It's not gonna help you
[3:21:27.720 --> 3:21:31.360]  It's crazy and he can't figure out. He said Fauci engaged her scammers
[3:21:31.360 --> 3:21:36.360]  He doesn't know how they're gonna get away with it when it all comes out that it's killing and hurting people and doesn't protect you
[3:21:36.360 --> 3:21:39.120]  because people are still getting the code that after they've had the vaccine and
[3:21:41.320 --> 3:21:43.320]  That's my question is like
[3:21:43.760 --> 3:21:50.160]  But but later we learned Hitler was attacking everybody. He even knew he was gonna lose. He just wanted to kill people and
[3:21:50.640 --> 3:21:57.600]  So we're not thinking like they're thinking. I mean Bill Gates is a eugenicist Bill Gates is a crazy person and
[3:21:57.600 --> 3:22:03.840]  Maybe he wants to discredit other regular gene therapy because there's a bunch of real life extension stuff coming out
[3:22:03.880 --> 3:22:06.320]  That actually has been tested and works that they won't approve
[3:22:06.600 --> 3:22:13.080]  They've got antibody stuff. I was talking to top scientists that like knocks out colon cancer almost a hundred percent won't approve it
[3:22:13.080 --> 3:22:17.000]  That's what Trump wants to speed up. He believes in medicine. We can do amazing things
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:18.520]  But it's it's like bad stuff
[3:22:18.520 --> 3:22:25.480]  We're getting that causes all these problems doesn't protect you. What is Bill Gates thinking finishing up Jess with with the cats
[3:22:25.480 --> 3:22:31.880]  Getting the vaccine and then developing the virus and dying people can look that up other key tidbits you'd like to add
[3:22:33.240 --> 3:22:36.680]  Yeah, so basically again to two big things here
[3:22:36.680 --> 3:22:42.600]  I think the biggest thing that has been so frustrating to any of us who are not just in the medical community
[3:22:42.600 --> 3:22:50.160]  But people who are health minded in general is that throughout all of this not once has anyone actually spoken about true health measures
[3:22:50.600 --> 3:22:54.760]  It's been you know about hiding ourselves putting this dirty dish rag on our mouths
[3:22:54.760 --> 3:23:00.800]  I mean my place of work were we using masks for like a week at a time because we're told not to waste things
[3:23:00.800 --> 3:23:05.560]  But we all know that that doesn't work the minute blood or makeup or anything gets on that you sneeze in it
[3:23:05.560 --> 3:23:09.640]  It doesn't work anymore. No one has been talking about actual appropriate diet
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:16.880]  Exercise anything like that. And so I mean this is a larger symptom of the true problem in human medicine that between, you know
[3:23:16.880 --> 3:23:20.480]  Big pharma and just incentives that I hate to say it
[3:23:20.480 --> 3:23:25.720]  But some doctors have for pushing certain medications or checking certain boxes off because unfortunately
[3:23:25.720 --> 3:23:29.440]  That's what human medicine has come down to is checking boxes off in epic
[3:23:29.600 --> 3:23:36.600]  Which is the electronic medical record system that many products all liability protection the bioethics the medical groups directive
[3:23:37.400 --> 3:23:42.880]  Yeah, and and you know, it's more about that then what is the true health of the patient?
[3:23:42.880 --> 3:23:47.680]  And so, you know, we've seen a push over the last 10 20 years in in medical education
[3:23:47.680 --> 3:23:52.200]  Of all different types about treating the whole person, you know
[3:23:52.200 --> 3:23:58.160]  Not just treating the the signs that you're seeing but the mental health all of that and and what the good news is
[3:23:58.160 --> 3:24:00.160]  I hear as you're saying your parents are
[3:24:00.240 --> 3:24:04.040]  Well, you know well respected good doctors and you're saying they're awake
[3:24:04.920 --> 3:24:07.360]  Yeah, they're awake. I mean they're getting out though
[3:24:07.360 --> 3:24:11.760]  But you know because they're at that age, but you know, there are there are too many younger people who
[3:24:11.760 --> 3:24:17.600]  We're told to do one thing, but then what is actually being practiced is a completely separate issue
[3:24:17.600 --> 3:24:19.960]  Um, and so that that has been entirely frustrating
[3:24:20.560 --> 3:24:25.160]  Let me ask you this. What do you make of Bill Gates who dropped out of college? Nothing wrong with that?
[3:24:25.160 --> 3:24:29.120]  He's obviously smart as you know, his parents they'll put him in charge. He was an IBM front guy
[3:24:29.120 --> 3:24:31.720]  I was told that people involved at IBM and it later came out in the news
[3:24:32.240 --> 3:24:36.440]  But but he's not a doctor, but I could even if he was I got a second opinion
[3:24:36.440 --> 3:24:41.920]  What makes this crazy dude up there telling me what I'm gonna eat what I'm gonna take how I'm gonna live
[3:24:41.920 --> 3:24:44.760]  I mean if a doctor acted like this, you'd leave their office
[3:24:44.760 --> 3:24:48.360]  Who the hell made this guy God and what is it like for you a smart doctor?
[3:24:48.360 --> 3:24:53.440]  That's obviously done your research to hear him up there. Just just just saying he controls our lives
[3:24:54.920 --> 3:25:00.280]  Yeah, it's it's beyond frustrating and all it is is really money and a platform
[3:25:00.280 --> 3:25:05.680]  and I think that because of the way the doctors have been demonized over the years as you know people who are just
[3:25:05.680 --> 3:25:09.320]  Especially surgeons just trying to get to their one o'clock tea time on the golf course
[3:25:09.600 --> 3:25:15.560]  Having someone who's not exactly a medical professional coming in and trying to be this benevolent figure as being slightly
[3:25:15.840 --> 3:25:21.400]  Separate from true medicine. I think some people actually find that more appealing than a doctor getting up there because then they say
[3:25:21.400 --> 3:25:26.720]  Oh, well, you're only doing it for for monetary effort. You're not doing and they don't get to Bill Gates literally admitted
[3:25:26.720 --> 3:25:28.840]  He makes 21 ratio off vaccine
[3:25:28.840 --> 3:25:36.520]  Oh, absolutely, but I mean these are the same people who also don't realize that as the recent report have come out that he owns the majority of
[3:25:36.720 --> 3:25:42.600]  Farmland now. He's the largest owner of farmland in the United States. Why why would he why would he need that again?
[3:25:42.600 --> 3:25:48.480]  He owns and directs his hundreds of billions that are tax-exempt and he gets all the benefits from it
[3:25:48.480 --> 3:25:55.080]  It's just simply incredible. Hey Jess. Thank you so much if you'd like to come on as a secret guest on some of the other shows
[3:25:55.080 --> 3:26:01.400]  Well, you can trust us. If you want to give us your number, we'd love to have you on as a guest on the war room or or on American Journal
[3:26:01.400 --> 3:26:03.240]  Thank you so much and God bless
[3:26:03.240 --> 3:26:08.160]  God bless you. Thank you very much. I can talk to Jess for hours because it's good to actually talk to someone that's informed
[3:26:08.160 --> 3:26:12.440]  I just read the medical literature from respected and they're like this is crazy
[3:26:12.440 --> 3:26:18.680]  I mean this is the top people and that's the good thing is all the most the top people are like
[3:26:18.680 --> 3:26:25.720]  Coming out and saying this is wrong like the head of the Rockefeller Hospital and they had a Mount Sinai and the Cedar Sinai and the
[3:26:25.720 --> 3:26:28.720]  The head of this the head of that and then you just hear them shut down
[3:26:29.240 --> 3:26:35.880]  You imagine being YouTube as you imagine being Facebook and Twitter and like the head of a hospitals warning people and you go
[3:26:36.880 --> 3:26:39.840]  But the head of the hospitals having a congressional hearing that you don't like go
[3:26:41.240 --> 3:26:43.720]  Honey, this is some evil stuff there boy
[3:26:43.720 --> 3:26:48.480]  I mean, what is if it's so wonderful your vaccine so good, then why don't you let us all talk about it?
[3:26:49.640 --> 3:26:55.480]  Think about how far we've come because we're in the jaws of this thing. It's like a lion jumps on you's dragging you away to eat you
[3:26:55.480 --> 3:26:59.160]  I mean, you know, it's like, whoa, this is really intense. Yeah, they're attacking
[3:27:01.080 --> 3:27:05.000]  And when Hitler attacked Russia and England and they rolled their sleeves up and fought back
[3:27:05.880 --> 3:27:11.840]  I'm not saying go out and blow people's heads off because it's not like that. It's a corporate attack using disinfo by big banks
[3:27:11.840 --> 3:27:16.560]  So we've got to become aware of that. I just want to tell you whether you're a schoolteacher or a doctor an FBI agent
[3:27:17.440 --> 3:27:19.440]  This is all real folks
[3:27:20.400 --> 3:27:27.440]  This program is so big of eugenics. They tried to recruit my dad in high school because he was top of his class
[3:27:29.040 --> 3:27:32.320]  And my dad didn't tell me about that till I was 30 something years old
[3:27:35.200 --> 3:27:39.040]  Think about that. It's so widespread. They try to recruit my father into this
[3:27:39.040 --> 3:27:44.560]  And he never even told me he's like, no, you're right. They try to recruit me to this. That's how big this is folks
[3:27:44.560 --> 3:27:49.360]  That's how huge this is the whole enchilada and guess what Bill Gates did get recruited
[3:27:50.400 --> 3:27:53.360]  And when you get recruited and play ball with them, you go right to the top
[3:27:54.640 --> 3:27:56.960]  And what is the thing they're building? It's evil
[3:27:59.200 --> 3:28:03.840]  And you know, instead of just poison everybody and giving them cancer if there's too many people which I don't agree with
[3:28:03.840 --> 3:28:08.880]  Neutron bomb is at least just kill us my god torture it but see the globalist love all this
[3:28:09.200 --> 3:28:11.200]  This is taking their time with us. Don't take
[3:28:11.760 --> 3:28:15.200]  All right, who's been holding the longest here done done done. Is it Melissa?
[3:28:16.320 --> 3:28:18.320]  Is it Tom? Is it Andrew?
[3:28:20.160 --> 3:28:26.240]  Yeah, it's a Tom and then and then and Tom. Thanks for holding go ahead. I don't think you might have though that doctor was pretty pretty strong
[3:28:27.200 --> 3:28:30.720]  Alex Idaho loves you man. I'm from Boise, Idaho. I'm from Boise, Idaho
[3:28:30.720 --> 3:28:34.320]  I wanted to let you know we love you and uh, you got great callers. You got a great show
[3:28:34.960 --> 3:28:40.000]  I also wanted to let people know that are moving here in droves that we aren't serious with trouble here in the state as well
[3:28:40.480 --> 3:28:46.720]  But you know, you've continued to ask what to do and what to do and I'm I was very very careful about wanting to be able to stay this on air
[3:28:46.720 --> 3:28:48.720]  Because I don't want to disrespect you
[3:28:48.720 --> 3:28:54.960]  Uh, because that's not my intent. Um, I happen to be the Idaho coordinator for the john bursa society and we've got an action
[3:28:55.280 --> 3:28:58.160]  We we've had a coordinated concerted action
[3:28:58.160 --> 3:29:03.760]  Plan for 62 years. Is there it would it be appropriate to even let people know that there are things that we can do
[3:29:04.480 --> 3:29:08.080]  Uh, as a cause for the john bursa society has been the preeminent group
[3:29:08.960 --> 3:29:12.480]  Of patriots that understood the whole thing and have been fighting it from the beginning. Yeah, tell folks about it
[3:29:13.280 --> 3:29:17.680]  Well, good. So, I mean, we've we're a 62 year old organization. We're an education and action group
[3:29:17.680 --> 3:29:20.080]  We focus on several different areas one being history
[3:29:20.720 --> 3:29:21.920]  current events
[3:29:21.920 --> 3:29:25.920]  Constitution and the element that I think only you and I think we're going to be able to do
[3:29:25.920 --> 3:29:30.320]  And the element that I think only you and I are you and and our organization cover
[3:29:30.320 --> 3:29:34.480]  And that's the element of conspiracy that people need to know because if you don't know the enemy
[3:29:34.880 --> 3:29:37.600]  You know, and you don't know yourself. You're going to be imperiled in every battle
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:42.240]  You know, we've got we've got a huge over here. Our governors are on the friendlies for the ccp
[3:29:42.720 --> 3:29:48.720]  Uh, they tried to implement foreign trade zones. You know, we've got it. We've got a congressman now that's trying to breach four dams
[3:29:48.800 --> 3:29:52.240]  I mean, I'm just letting people know. I know that's not about Idaho
[3:29:52.240 --> 3:29:56.480]  But I want to let people know that, you know, I know scousin says this is, you know
[3:29:56.560 --> 3:29:59.120]  The number one place to be able to go and those kinds of things
[3:29:59.440 --> 3:30:01.440]  Tom don't hang up. We'll come back and finish up with you
[3:30:01.920 --> 3:30:06.800]  And for those that don't know they want to blow all the dams up and take the hydroelectric too hydroelectric is totally clean
[3:30:06.880 --> 3:30:08.880]  No, evil carbon. They want those blown
[3:30:09.280 --> 3:30:11.840]  But shining it's all the coal plants. We are under military
[3:30:12.320 --> 3:30:17.120]  Attack in general. I do you raise on the news saying he is prepared to wage war against America
[3:30:17.360 --> 3:30:20.720]  To confiscate all guns and kill american citizens and mass
[3:30:20.720 --> 3:30:24.160]  Even Tucker Carlson's covering it. I mean, this is insane
[3:30:24.800 --> 3:30:27.040]  And if we let him normalize it, tady bar the door
[3:30:28.160 --> 3:30:31.200]  Well, they're right back. We'll finish up with tom and get others on the other side
[3:30:37.120 --> 3:30:45.360]  As men age they often experience a slowdown in vitality energy and overall wellness

[3:31:45.440 --> 3:31:48.000]  Even before I had access to the show in the mid 1990s
[3:31:48.560 --> 3:31:51.200]  I wouldn't saw that movie and thought man, that looks fun
[3:31:52.080 --> 3:31:56.880]  That's to speak out and have your own ideas and even if you're a nerd you're still entertaining because you're real
[3:31:57.120 --> 3:31:59.040]  Well, what do they say in wanes world?

[3:32:05.200 --> 3:32:08.720]  I don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge or so real

[3:32:16.960 --> 3:32:24.080]  Destroying humanity. They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them. That for me is really set down
[3:32:24.880 --> 3:32:26.000]  And disgusting
[3:32:26.000 --> 3:32:29.680]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the hauling forward crew

[3:34:16.720 --> 3:34:22.720]  Patriot blend of course read all the great reviews pretty much perfect review there 4.9 star when you have thousands of reviews
[3:34:22.880 --> 3:34:26.880]  It's uh impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gets a five star
[3:34:26.960 --> 3:34:32.160]  So I mean if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody gives it a five star except maybe one or two people patriot blend 100%
[3:34:32.480 --> 3:34:37.200]  organic coffee only available at info wars store dot com
[3:34:37.200 --> 3:34:44.400]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:52.720 --> 3:34:58.720]  All right, we got loaded phone lines with andrew and colin and steve and jepperson and sarah and michael and david
[3:34:58.720 --> 3:35:03.600]  And carlos and melissa, so i'm just going to the next hour though and shroyer. He's happy to have me with him
[3:35:03.600 --> 3:35:10.800]  So until we get all your calls done. I will be here and i'm in owens studio because the other big studio is getting hooked back up after power outages
[3:35:11.520 --> 3:35:16.960]  Fuses blowing and generators hooked up and all sorts of fun things trying to burn down the building here
[3:35:16.960 --> 3:35:21.840]  But uh, here we are ladies and gentlemen tom and idaho. You're absolutely right for those that don't know
[3:35:22.640 --> 3:35:27.440]  The u.n. Wants to get rid of all the dams. It's not about the fishies. They don't want us to have power again
[3:35:27.680 --> 3:35:32.320]  But it's only the west that can't have power shine on everybody else. They can can't they
[3:35:32.320 --> 3:35:34.320]  Yep, they sure can
[3:35:35.040 --> 3:35:38.800]  And this guy, I mean he this guy claims he's a republican and this is part of the problem
[3:35:38.800 --> 3:35:44.640]  We have in idaho with these republican neocons is that the average person here in idaho if they've got a cowboy hat
[3:35:44.880 --> 3:35:47.120]  You know, they feel like they can vote with an r behind their name
[3:35:47.200 --> 3:35:51.760]  This guy absolutely comes out aligns with the hard left, you know, i've traveled the state
[3:35:51.840 --> 3:35:54.960]  so i know a lot of people i mean billions of dollars were used at
[3:35:56.320 --> 3:35:57.440]  on
[3:35:57.440 --> 3:35:58.480]  on
[3:35:58.480 --> 3:36:03.840]  Canal projects and all kinds of things they were all led on and I think what they did was they led them on
[3:36:04.400 --> 3:36:06.480]  Along enough to be able to destroy the amount of
[3:36:07.120 --> 3:36:09.120]  Investment and then close the project
[3:36:09.280 --> 3:36:12.080]  So he's he's basically talking about this whole thing
[3:36:12.080 --> 3:36:16.240]  I heard on the radio here locally about a new what you said is so smart just like keystone
[3:36:16.480 --> 3:36:20.160]  They let them spend the 20-something billion on it and then they kill the project at the end of it
[3:36:20.160 --> 3:36:24.880]  I mean they let they let you lobby to have your project and they make you pay for the project
[3:36:24.880 --> 3:36:31.520]  And you got to pay them a cut of the project and then they pull it out from under you because they don't want business in america
[3:36:31.600 --> 3:36:33.600]  It's so sick
[3:36:33.680 --> 3:36:38.400]  Hey, alex. I just want to tell you. I love your products, too. I had to plug. I was doing I tried your turbo force
[3:36:38.480 --> 3:36:40.080]  um
[3:36:40.080 --> 3:36:44.240]  And the alpha power in the supermail. I've been a big fan of your dad's toothpaste
[3:36:44.320 --> 3:36:48.480]  I mean you guys rock man. Your news is good. You're rocking brother. We love you. Tom. Thank you
[3:36:48.800 --> 3:36:52.000]  Like I said, i'm hosting the next hour. I'm going to every one of these wonderful callers
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:55.360]  All right, who's been home the next longest that'll be andrew of texas. Go ahead andrew
[3:36:58.960 --> 3:37:06.400]  Guide you guys over there at info wars. I'd also like to start out by giving a plug. Um, I got all of the uh
[3:37:07.040 --> 3:37:10.960]  Supercharged new year's pack as well as vitamin mineral fusion
[3:37:11.360 --> 3:37:15.520]  Uh got the iodine. I'd say if anybody's still on the fence or
[3:37:15.520 --> 3:37:21.520]  Uh suspicious about buying any of the products start out with the iodine see what that does for you
[3:37:22.080 --> 3:37:25.920]  After a week, I totally agree. I did not hang up on the collar. Did I just lose my headset?
[3:37:26.640 --> 3:37:29.920]  Okay, it's not the collar put them on hold guys. I my my headset just went out
[3:37:30.560 --> 3:37:32.560]  I guess the battery just ran out put him on hold
[3:37:33.040 --> 3:37:35.040]  Don't hang up taller. Yeah
[3:37:35.920 --> 3:37:40.160]  And I don't know why these headsets listen to this when they run out of power. They make this horrible sound
[3:37:41.760 --> 3:37:43.760]  So, uh, let's do this
[3:37:43.760 --> 3:37:47.200]  I guess I've been on there for four hours or whatever. So that's why this just went out
[3:37:47.760 --> 3:37:49.760]  That's okay, everybody. I'm gonna get to you next hour
[3:37:50.640 --> 3:37:55.440]  And I can just take it to regular wire if you guys got one. We don't need to do a big big song and dance about it
[3:37:56.160 --> 3:37:58.560]  Or maybe I got a rebroadcast. I'll go find out but, um
[3:38:00.160 --> 3:38:02.800]  The collar did not hang up that was just uh
[3:38:03.840 --> 3:38:06.400]  The thing going out. Yeah, so that battery just went out
[3:38:07.280 --> 3:38:09.440]  So as soon as I can I will uh go back
[3:38:09.440 --> 3:38:12.960]  To your phone calls. I use a wireless system. It's a lot better
[3:38:14.160 --> 3:38:15.440]  uh, but yeah
[3:38:15.440 --> 3:38:17.440]  Most people are deficient in iodine
[3:38:18.080 --> 3:38:22.640]  And so if you don't have it, uh, then you just start breaking down at every level and look I look like hell
[3:38:22.800 --> 3:38:27.760]  I gained 30 something pounds during the election. I got super upset a cortisol has been released
[3:38:28.320 --> 3:38:31.840]  I've just been really worried about the election. I knew trump was surrounded people wouldn't listen to me
[3:38:32.480 --> 3:38:35.520]  I try I mean, I don't feel sorry for myself. But I mean, I really know what's going on
[3:38:35.520 --> 3:38:42.560]  And I'm like begging people. No, it's an emergency. They're gonna steal it and and I I I've even been eating less food and I just
[3:38:43.600 --> 3:38:45.600]  Got fat and unhealthy
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:50.240]  And I even stopped stopped taking some of the supplements. But as soon as I go back on them, I just I just feel so good
[3:38:51.600 --> 3:38:53.600]  And x2 is just a deep earth crystal
[3:38:54.080 --> 3:38:56.320]  uh, super high quality iodine
[3:38:57.120 --> 3:39:00.800]  And we're really really proud of it. So I apologize to the caller
[3:39:00.800 --> 3:39:05.520]  Uh, but as soon as I get another headset, I'll just take a regular wire if you guys got one
[3:39:06.080 --> 3:39:09.280]  Uh, we will do that. Let me go ahead and just play this report for you
[3:39:09.280 --> 3:39:12.560]  Then we'll come back with your calls and I'll be hosting part of the fourth hour
[3:39:13.200 --> 3:39:14.400]  with you
[3:39:14.400 --> 3:39:16.400]  Let's just play, um
[3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:21.440]  Some of this report here. Let's play the uh, climate czar says
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:24.160]  the quiet part allowed from
[3:39:24.800 --> 3:39:26.240]  Massachusetts about
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:31.280]  Turning the power off on retirees and breaking their will and we'll go right back to your calls. Here it is
[3:39:32.960 --> 3:39:37.680]  You know one thing that we found through our analysis is that 60 percent of our emissions come from
[3:39:38.800 --> 3:39:43.920]  As I have been starting to say you and me except you guys are in vermont 60 percent of our emissions come from
[3:39:44.480 --> 3:39:46.480]  residential heating
[3:39:47.280 --> 3:39:51.520]  And passenger vehicles, so let me say that again 60 percent of our
[3:39:52.320 --> 3:39:54.560]  emissions that need to be reduced come from
[3:39:54.560 --> 3:39:56.000]  Um
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:40:02.240]  You the person of three the senior on fixed income, right? These there is no bad guy left at least in Massachusetts
[3:40:02.720 --> 3:40:04.640]  point the finger at
[3:40:04.640 --> 3:40:06.080]  turn the screws on
[3:40:06.080 --> 3:40:10.720]  And you know break their will so they stop emitting. That's you. We have to break your will
[3:40:12.240 --> 3:40:14.320]  I can't even say that publicly. I'm what I'm trying to say is
[3:40:16.240 --> 3:40:18.240]  Doesn't everybody get the sick joke
[3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:23.760]  They we need to break their will so they stop emitting you emit carbon dioxide
[3:40:25.840 --> 3:40:30.080]  That's why when bill gates goes always gonna take a long time to beat the virus. You're the virus
[3:40:30.880 --> 3:40:34.720]  And I'm not just saying there's a metaphor you understand you are the virus
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:39.200]  It was so chilling to watch that evil sake the press secretary up there
[3:40:40.080 --> 3:40:43.440]  And they're like will it ever end and they go you can only hope
[3:40:44.080 --> 3:40:46.880]  And she's talking about killing everybody in the room. I mean she's in on the sick joke
[3:40:46.880 --> 3:40:50.960]  And that winch thinks that her and her kids will be safe pulling us off
[3:40:52.240 --> 3:40:54.720]  She don't know much about reap what you sow
[3:40:55.920 --> 3:40:59.520]  I mean call it what you want what comes around goes around sweetheart
[3:41:00.560 --> 3:41:04.400]  That's why i'm god fearing fearing god pulls out on me
[3:41:05.600 --> 3:41:09.600]  I explain that again. I don't fear god. I'm not scared of god. I'm scared of god leaving me
[3:41:11.440 --> 3:41:13.440]  That's why I walk the line
[3:41:13.440 --> 3:41:15.440]  I don't screw anybody over
[3:41:15.440 --> 3:41:19.840]  I'm like mr. McGoo because the big guy's watching
[3:41:22.960 --> 3:41:28.560]  New people that have given up on god, I feel sorry for you actually all right andry sorry about headset went out
[3:41:28.880 --> 3:41:33.280]  It does it about every four hours. I guess I just did four hours. So it went out
[3:41:33.520 --> 3:41:36.720]  We're gonna host to the next hour for all the college. We really appreciate you stay with us
[3:41:37.120 --> 3:41:39.520]  Andrew go ahead and make your point again. Sorry it cut out
[3:41:39.520 --> 3:41:47.360]  Oh, you're fine. Alex. Amen. You're you're in the arena. The stuff happens. Um, I was just after I
[3:41:48.080 --> 3:41:53.440]  Went over the stuff with the the info wars products. Um, also wanted to say I've got a pretty sweet
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:56.560]  us space force shirt and the trader joe shirt
[3:41:57.280 --> 3:42:01.120]  essential oils all all sorts of stuff from info wars, but um
[3:42:01.920 --> 3:42:08.160]  Really just as the techs in pretty po'd about all of the stuff that's going on with air cut right now
[3:42:08.160 --> 3:42:10.880]  I really appreciate you going through all that
[3:42:11.360 --> 3:42:17.840]  What I wanted to suggest to any other techs in to are or are not affected by this whole situation
[3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:24.960]  Um, this morning I wrote to uh, my state rep and then decided hey, I'm gonna go ahead and send that
[3:42:25.520 --> 3:42:27.520]  to senator cruz
[3:42:27.520 --> 3:42:30.800]  send it to governor abbott and then I also sent it to uh
[3:42:30.800 --> 3:42:38.000]  My attorney general came back then and uh, I know that guy's a patriot because I'm not gonna say I was there wink wink, but uh,
[3:42:38.240 --> 3:42:40.240]  know that he spoke
[3:42:41.120 --> 3:42:46.880]  At the capital well prior to the capital, um on january the sixth and uh, I just
[3:42:47.360 --> 3:42:53.360]  Feel like if we can in numbers get out there and kind of point this out to our representatives and our
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:56.720]  elected officials and hopefully something can be done about it
[3:42:56.720 --> 3:43:01.520]  I totally agree with you brother and the way they're trying to destroy trump is a scare anybody off from supporting
[3:43:02.320 --> 3:43:07.280]  Um any other patriot in the future. That's what we've got to be strong and take our licks. Thank you, andrew
[3:43:07.520 --> 3:43:10.720]  All right, colon for colon in north dakota
[3:43:11.280 --> 3:43:15.680]  Last caller for this hour, but i'm gonna come back in the war room in mere minutes. We're going to write to your calls
[3:43:16.160 --> 3:43:20.240]  Immediately with oan schreuer when we start the next hour colon go ahead
[3:43:21.520 --> 3:43:25.280]  Well, thanks for taking my call uh first time callers since 1998
[3:43:25.280 --> 3:43:32.320]  And I want to thank you uh, and everybody you use to create knockout and your dad's rocket rest
[3:43:32.640 --> 3:43:38.400]  Uh, I couldn't carry the information that many of us carry and get a good night's sleep without it
[3:43:38.480 --> 3:43:40.480]  So thank you for that as well
[3:43:40.720 --> 3:43:47.040]  Um the genesis from my call kind of goes back to what jfk said about how those who make peaceful revolution
[3:43:47.600 --> 3:43:49.200]  impossible make
[3:43:49.200 --> 3:43:53.920]  A violent revolution inevitable and I I see that coming into view
[3:43:53.920 --> 3:44:01.760]  Because of all many of the mechanisms of not all the mechanisms for redress of grievance have been essentially been removed
[3:44:02.720 --> 3:44:07.840]  And uh, it makes me you know makes me think about john ross's book on the unintended consequences
[3:44:07.840 --> 3:44:13.520]  I don't know if you're a reddit, but uh, it's interlaced with a novel but interlaced with actual historic events
[3:44:14.320 --> 3:44:16.320]  And uh involving oppression
[3:44:16.320 --> 3:44:20.480]  Of other people by their government. Yes. I've read the book. It's actually
[3:44:20.480 --> 3:44:26.640]  Yes, sir. Anyway, I just feel like uh, seeing uh, we're like a slow moving
[3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:28.640]  train wreck
[3:44:28.640 --> 3:44:32.880]  And I and my mind just tells me we're out of time and I am not I'm not I totally agree with you
[3:44:32.960 --> 3:44:38.080]  I'm physically ill because there's an ill. I don't have any desire to kill globalists. There's such sacks of garbage
[3:44:38.400 --> 3:44:41.920]  But I mean the thing is they're not going to stop that they're just they have a desire
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:46.960]  They're mentally ill and all these idiot lawyers that let them go and the fbi that let them do this
[3:44:46.960 --> 3:44:50.880]  Like the fbi is worried about patriots. You don't be worried about the globalist starting a damn war
[3:44:51.120 --> 3:44:53.120]  I mean you people are nuts
[3:44:53.120 --> 3:44:58.400]  You're out of your minds. You're destroying the country for the chai comms. You're a joke and they've put a skeleton
[3:44:59.120 --> 3:45:01.120]  Minion zombie in as the president
[3:45:02.560 --> 3:45:09.040]  And I wanted to ask you about uh, uh, foster versus love 1997 supreme court ruling
[3:45:09.200 --> 3:45:10.960]  Oh, Colin don't hang up
[3:45:10.960 --> 3:45:14.000]  You're going to be with me on the war room with Owen shroyer
