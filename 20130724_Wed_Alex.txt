[07:35.280 --> 07:40.960]  need to be ahead of the game how to engineer the opinion of the american people so that they would
[07:40.960 --> 07:47.600]  not only endorse but demand a war out of another one another plane to stay state of mind because
[07:47.600 --> 07:54.240]  there's a war on or your mind get your copy of state of mind the movie at info wars dot com and
[07:54.240 --> 08:12.000]  remember every order at info wars store dot com receives a free citizen rule book crashing through
[08:12.000 --> 08:19.120]  the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[08:30.080 --> 08:37.840]  ladies and gentlemen we are here broadcasting worldwide thank you so much for joining us
[08:37.840 --> 08:44.320]  and we're going to be taking your phone calls throughout the next three hours on this wednesday
[08:45.360 --> 08:53.440]  addition we're going to plunge into obama's 20 something is a 25th pivot or reset of the economy
[08:53.440 --> 08:58.240]  which means more banker bailouts to foreign corporations more taxpayer payments to msnbc
[08:58.240 --> 09:08.080]  uh more domestic cia propaganda operations more people getting uh text from obama forced onto
[09:08.080 --> 09:14.560]  the front page of their phone uh more uh checkpoints on the highways more illegal
[09:14.560 --> 09:22.080]  desensitization military drills on the streets uh tsa checkpoints more forced inoculation
[09:22.080 --> 09:29.040]  outside of law more harassment of businesses shutting down industry shutting down power plants
[09:29.040 --> 09:34.960]  shutting down factories paying 21 billion to ship general motors to communist china
[09:34.960 --> 09:40.720]  on and on more persecution of the press more persecution of whistleblowers of money laundering
[09:40.720 --> 09:48.320]  government drug dealing illegal spying illegal torture just just just absolute orgy of corruption
[09:48.320 --> 09:57.200]  yeah the weekly standard says it's his 19th time to pivot but i count over 20 because uh
[09:58.240 --> 10:03.360]  it's 19 pivots but five or six resets in fact look up how many times he's called it a reset
[10:04.080 --> 10:09.040]  i remember it every six months or so so i'm conservative when i say four or five times
[10:09.040 --> 10:14.480]  he's been in office five years five and a half i don't know i don't have a 15 resets
[10:14.480 --> 10:22.160]  so i when i say 25 i mean and i'm counting pivots resets i mean they call wars now
[10:22.720 --> 10:30.720]  non-lethal lethal operations or lethal non-lethal or less lethal or kinetic actions it's just a wall
[10:31.360 --> 10:40.480]  of bow and now congress is looking at a government shutdown over obama care as republican leadership
[10:40.480 --> 10:45.840]  in the senate forced by their constituents some of these guys just a year ago were still
[10:45.840 --> 10:51.120]  supporting obama care are now seeing it will sink the country it will bankrupt health care
[10:51.120 --> 10:55.360]  which is the cloward and piven socialist obama planned to bankrupt the country they're talking
[10:55.360 --> 11:01.600]  about six out of ten doctors and national survey monday we covered quitting and by the way my dad's
[11:01.600 --> 11:05.280]  a dentist an oral surgeon he knows a lot of dentists a lot of oral surgeons a lot of doctors
[11:05.280 --> 11:12.400]  most of them that are even 50 years old already only plastic surgeons and specialists are making
[11:12.400 --> 11:18.720]  300 400 500 thousand dollars a year i know harvard educated doctors in my family
[11:20.160 --> 11:27.440]  who have been doctors and graduates for 16 years and just finished paying off their student loans
[11:27.440 --> 11:36.000]  and moved from a lower middle class house into a you know middle middle class type house you know
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.200]  four bedroom so that all their kids have a place to sleep and i mean i mean so some people have
[11:41.200 --> 11:48.080]  this image of doctors are just rolling in money 17 years to pay off your student loans from harvard
[11:48.080 --> 11:56.800]  17 years this is the type of stuff that is going on out there and now because of the
[11:56.800 --> 12:03.440]  regulations and the liability insurance the malpractice insurance i know doctors that
[12:03.440 --> 12:08.640]  have to pay who've never even had major claims or never lost there's all sorts of kooks out
[12:08.640 --> 12:15.600]  there trying to get rich off these fake claims who have to pay 70 to 80 or even more thousand
[12:15.600 --> 12:22.880]  dollars a year for their liability insurance their malpractice insurance and i know doctors
[12:22.880 --> 12:26.880]  that have done hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of serious surgeries were really more than that
[12:26.880 --> 12:34.880]  who've actually had cases but but beat the malpractice cases and they've got to pay 150
[12:34.880 --> 12:40.160]  thousand dollars a year in liability insurance it is the insurance companies that are destroying
[12:40.160 --> 12:47.280]  this country along with a pack of lawyers the litigants uh baritry practicing frauds
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.600]  who the courts will not bring to justice you know most cases somebody brings a false charge
[12:53.600 --> 12:58.560]  you've got to go fight it and beat it it's the law says you can sue them back for attorney's fees
[12:58.560 --> 13:05.200]  and takes what it's very hard to win unless you know exactly which court to go after a man
[13:05.200 --> 13:10.160]  and again this is knowledge that both that most lawyers don't know and most lawyers don't want to
[13:10.160 --> 13:16.160]  tell you because even if they're quote a good guy lawyer they they're actually it at a certain
[13:16.160 --> 13:22.640]  level working with the corrupt lawyers in that they're not shutting them down when they could
[13:22.640 --> 13:30.560]  they're letting them go out and create fraudulent cases and then basically going and beating them
[13:30.560 --> 13:35.680]  but still both sides make money and i'm kind of digressing any of the big multinational
[13:37.200 --> 13:44.720]  pharma companies that have tax exemption in many cases they have diplomatic immunity
[13:44.720 --> 13:50.160]  and they have immunity domestically in most countries in europe the united states you name it
[13:50.160 --> 13:56.240]  from their drugs hurting people they have liability protection and immunity given to them
[13:56.240 --> 14:01.920]  sovereign immunity as it's called by the government well that's unconstitutional for Bayer pharmaceutical
[14:01.920 --> 14:08.800]  to knowingly put hiv and their factor eight and knowingly ship it out for 10 years a death sentence
[14:08.800 --> 14:15.040]  with hepatitis as well and then oh well they've got they've got immunity because the government
[14:15.040 --> 14:22.160]  passed a law what happened this year monsanto was given immunity from their gmo's now now now now
[14:22.160 --> 14:29.920]  why would congress pass the monsanto protection act written by monsanto to give them immunity
[14:29.920 --> 14:34.240]  just like they were given immunity on age in orange and dioxin they dumped in poor black
[14:34.240 --> 14:40.720]  neighborhoods on and on and on these are consciously evil companies with evil histories
[14:41.840 --> 14:49.920]  and clear and present danger to humanity so the bad guys are protected from liability
[14:49.920 --> 14:57.680]  and then your small town hospital isn't so it goes bankrupt from all the lawsuits
[14:57.680 --> 15:04.160]  because there's all these bugs that are immune to the drugs that are immune to the
[15:05.200 --> 15:10.880]  different type of antibiotics and so you come in there and the guy next to you has it and there's
[15:10.880 --> 15:14.640]  nothing they can do in the hospital to stop it from getting over to you you die of flesh
[15:14.640 --> 15:21.760]  eating bacteria and then you go and sue and beat the hospital and then now it's shut down and you've
[15:21.760 --> 15:27.760]  got to go to one of the big tax free rockefeller owned uh tax exempt but they're really profit
[15:27.760 --> 15:32.240]  centers and guess what they've got all the judges in their pockets you can't win against them see
[15:32.880 --> 15:40.320]  the whole new world order is about made men and i'm not talking about the gambino's and the uh
[15:40.320 --> 15:49.440]  uh bananas and the uh you know groups like that i'm not talking about don corleone that's a low
[15:49.440 --> 15:53.760]  level mafia that the globalists just kind of fed on and partially destroyed because it got too big
[15:53.760 --> 15:59.440]  for its britches as i've told you many times and as a historical fact the real mafias are so
[15:59.440 --> 16:04.320]  entrenched they run our government they run our military they own the big banks they own the
[16:04.320 --> 16:08.960]  insurance companies they're a hundred percent globally tax exempt they can commit any crime
[16:08.960 --> 16:13.280]  they want and get away with it they can take private bank accounts from cyprus or the united
[16:13.280 --> 16:18.480]  states and get away with it they can commit any amount of you know they kill people at their own
[16:18.480 --> 16:24.400]  house there's been cases with the duponts and people you know driving around with army tanks
[16:24.400 --> 16:29.280]  their own private army tanks running people over and they get away with it for years i mean this
[16:29.280 --> 16:35.040]  this is who they are and they're establishing a world government where they're a hundred percent
[16:35.040 --> 16:40.000]  above the law in every level and every regulation and why is that important because they write
[16:40.000 --> 16:46.800]  the regulations to shut you down and impoverish you and enslave you and use poverty as a political
[16:46.800 --> 16:54.560]  weapon it's called siege it's called salting the earth politically economically and i sit here
[16:55.520 --> 17:02.240]  watching a godzilla level attack by the globalist godzilla couldn't 50 godzillas couldn't do
[17:02.240 --> 17:07.120]  to america what the globalists have already done the last 30 years i mean they're shutting
[17:07.120 --> 17:13.200]  everything down with regulations and bureaucrats and harassment right here in austin that's under
[17:13.200 --> 17:19.280]  agenda 21 the major command base they have a june 21 meetings i've sent my crews to they show this
[17:19.280 --> 17:24.640]  triangle where they take over dallas houston san antonio but the middle of the triangle they
[17:24.640 --> 17:33.680]  even call austin their base of operations federally funded un model city and oh if you're not an
[17:33.680 --> 17:38.640]  insider you you're not allowed to build a condo you're not a oh we're gonna say this tree you can't
[17:38.640 --> 17:43.120]  cut it down even uh my lawyer eric tabb he said he'll come on here about this as you get him on
[17:44.080 --> 17:50.000]  downtown they let this business build a big outside deck on congress gave him the permits and then
[17:50.000 --> 17:57.120]  came and withdrew the permits after it was built $150,000 deck it's a giant deck and it was a big
[17:57.120 --> 18:01.520]  case in the news they were doing this to hundreds of people on record but they fought back my lawyer
[18:01.520 --> 18:09.440]  fought back went and beat the city but but now they're still harassing the company anyways
[18:09.440 --> 18:13.360]  this is what they do they come and they say yeah you're allowed to build then they come back and
[18:13.360 --> 18:18.800]  say now you can't build the essence of the new world order is this story from prisonplanet.com
[18:18.800 --> 18:26.080]  american dream michael schneider look at this obama administration requires magician to submit
[18:26.080 --> 18:34.320]  32 page disaster plan for his rabbit pay all the fines and fees and register it under osha

[19:13.360 --> 19:18.480]  now the government is spending time and money worrying about emergency plan for a bunny rabbit
[19:19.200 --> 19:24.880]  ladies and gentlemen that is the plan here we have such a nanny state i shot a video
[19:24.880 --> 19:30.400]  of my son catching a 50 pound alligator gar my phone died by the time i caught a 95 pounder
[19:30.400 --> 19:35.040]  yeah it was out of batteries by the way we were throwing these back even though we could have
[19:35.040 --> 19:38.640]  taken them and you know they suppose they have some pretty good backstrap me with sport fishing
[19:38.640 --> 19:44.560]  plus they're an air breathing to prehistoric fish it breathes mostly from the air over its lungs
[19:44.560 --> 19:49.600]  and there are people all over saying shut my channel down for torturing a fish because they
[19:49.600 --> 19:55.280]  think it's torture when we take the the the prongs to open its mouth to get the hook out and they're
[19:55.280 --> 19:59.840]  they're taking over they're going to ban fishing unless you're a factory trawler then it's okay

[23:58.080 --> 24:15.120]  by the way i'm going to play the video and audio of this later in the hour of my great crime abusing
[24:15.120 --> 24:20.800]  an alligator gar and you know you sit there and you joke about that people think it's it's bad to
[24:20.800 --> 24:25.680]  go hunting but then they'll go eat a hamburger and when i drive by factory farms and things i
[24:25.680 --> 24:32.000]  think that's really abusive and we should move towards more humane farming and i try to with
[24:32.000 --> 24:38.960]  my purchases buy things that have been naturally caught or things that have been properly farmed
[24:38.960 --> 24:46.480]  raised because i don't want the gmo i don't want all the garbage that's in those animals i don't
[24:46.480 --> 24:51.680]  want the farm raised chicken that is literally like a concentration camp where they cut their beaks off
[24:51.680 --> 24:56.640]  off when they're babies so they don't peck themselves to death the chickens try to commit
[24:56.640 --> 25:01.680]  suicide in the big mega massive those big steel buildings aluminum buildings you see out in the
[25:01.680 --> 25:05.840]  countryside i know people are out there trying to make a living doing it but man i've been inside
[25:05.840 --> 25:11.440]  those i have been inside those i have seen it i have seen what it's like and let me tell you
[25:11.440 --> 25:19.680]  it's it's it is it you can feel the the spiritual or psychic energy of those chickens are those
[25:19.680 --> 25:24.960]  turkeys i was actually what i really saw was a turkey house with about a half a half million
[25:24.960 --> 25:29.280]  turkeys and it was one of the smaller ones and let me tell you you could just see mites and stuff
[25:29.280 --> 25:39.200]  crawling across the floor the point is is that then you've got these dumb down idiots who were on
[25:39.200 --> 25:44.160]  my youtube channel going i'm reporting you to youtube for animal abuse because we're the 50
[25:44.160 --> 25:49.600]  pound gar you know you've got these tongs of these dull hooks that you use to get in there and open
[25:49.600 --> 25:54.800]  its mouth up to then get the hook out and i can legally and lawfully then you'll butcher it and
[25:55.360 --> 26:00.960]  do that if i wanted to and i decided to throw them back it was a normal human instinct to go
[26:00.960 --> 26:05.680]  out and fish show my son and we caught some other fish that were more edible that we actually ate
[26:06.400 --> 26:11.680]  but we ran into a bunch of big alligator gar again i caught over a 90 pounder landed it
[26:11.680 --> 26:18.080]  and we we we hooked a shark a black tip but it broke off well its tail slashed when it came
[26:18.080 --> 26:23.840]  from the boat and broke that off it was about five feet long and by the way i like shark i would have
[26:23.840 --> 26:27.920]  kept that and eaten that but the whole point is this is something about that prehistoric
[26:27.920 --> 26:32.880]  gar they say they actually taste pretty good but i didn't and so we use it as a joke to say
[26:34.160 --> 26:39.440]  obama caught the fish we didn't catch it and the guide that took us out there and did a great job
[26:39.440 --> 26:43.760]  by the way mark malfa down in south texas he's been on some of the discovery channel
[26:43.760 --> 26:49.920]  river monster shows he did a great job taking us down there and we're just we're just there to
[26:49.920 --> 26:55.520]  abuse fish according to people that that that literally think no one should be able to eat any
[26:55.520 --> 27:02.000]  meat but the issue is they have to clear land and displace and kill animals to be able to
[27:02.640 --> 27:08.000]  grow stuff that vegan eat and you may be on a high horse and feel good about what you're doing
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.120]  and and and are against animal cruelty and i get that but you have to understand ladies and
[27:13.120 --> 27:18.640]  gentlemen the whole world animals eat animals if you're an omnivore or a carnivore and humans
[27:18.640 --> 27:25.760]  are omnivores i mean is it cruel that that gar had parasites on it sucking its blood i mean are
[27:25.760 --> 27:31.760]  they being abusive should they have a youtube strike put on them should they get in trouble
[27:31.760 --> 27:36.880]  it's this ultra political correctness where no one cares about gmo killing almost all the honey
[27:36.880 --> 27:42.720]  bees no people don't care about all sorts of just incredible attacks on humans being poisoned
[27:42.720 --> 27:47.040]  humans being killed all over the world 30 million humans starving to death people
[27:49.120 --> 27:55.680]  associate all of their humanity with identifying with animals and not humans and if humans aren't
[27:56.320 --> 28:01.360]  protected and if life isn't valued for humans or aborted babies it's not going to be valued for
[28:01.360 --> 28:07.760]  animals and the globalist pick and choose which environmental issues they want a hot button push
[28:08.560 --> 28:14.080]  just like they do with the trayvon martin case to hot button push they choose politically issues
[28:14.080 --> 28:19.840]  they want to manipulate to get an agenda through and now john mccain today i have the video clip
[28:20.400 --> 28:27.440]  has joined obama and has joined gutierrez in the congress and everybody else calling to
[28:27.440 --> 28:33.360]  have a federal law restricting and rolling back concealed carry they're so angry on average you
[28:33.360 --> 28:38.240]  have a 27 drop in crime within two years after concealed carry goes in in florida and texas
[28:38.240 --> 28:45.360]  and within a decade they saw over 40 drops in crime since the just department numbers came out from
[28:45.360 --> 28:53.440]  1996 you know what the crime rate dropped right violent crime 61 percent crimes with firearms
[28:53.440 --> 28:57.920]  49 percent we've beaten that dead horse but we need to beat it some more because people
[28:58.480 --> 29:04.160]  the establishment knows ladies and gentlemen the establishment knows if they armed folks
[29:04.160 --> 29:08.640]  in south side chicago and got rid of the gun prohibition the criminals will disappear very
[29:08.640 --> 29:13.120]  very quickly i mean in a year you'd have thousands of criminals shot dead and then it all be over
[29:14.240 --> 29:18.480]  kenneth saw georgia had a huge crime wave they passed they passed a law repealing the gun ban
[29:18.480 --> 29:25.040]  crime rate dropped 86 percent look that up that's the atlanta journal constitution the answer is
[29:25.040 --> 29:32.320]  guns guns you know rednecks don't hardly ever get robbed driving big trucks with cowboy hats on
[29:32.320 --> 29:37.760]  you know why nobody robs them because everybody knows they got a gun they got a shotgun a rifle

[34:01.120 --> 34:10.240]  top 35 several times now and i just cannot decide uh it may come down to putting the top three in a
[34:10.240 --> 34:16.880]  hat but that's not fair every once in a while i'm a person who's very uh
[34:18.960 --> 34:27.840]  committed uh very what's the term when decisive i make a lot of decisions just bam that's the
[34:27.840 --> 34:33.040]  right thing to do it's clear but when it comes to judging contest and there's and there's so many
[34:33.040 --> 34:40.800]  good ones it really is hard to decide which one you think is the best so one one winner will get
[34:40.800 --> 34:45.360]  ten thousand dollars that's second place third place gets five thousand dollars first place one
[34:45.360 --> 34:54.240]  hundred thousand dollars which is really a patriot film festival the globalist will give
[34:54.240 --> 35:01.760]  billions of dollars a year in the u.s alone of taxpayer money with the federal uh arts departments
[35:01.760 --> 35:10.160]  two anti-american anti-liberty anti-family outfits oh here's a million dollars or more to put a crucifix
[35:10.160 --> 35:18.320]  in a brandy glass of urine uh here is a hundred thousand dollars to put uh manure on the virgin
[35:18.320 --> 35:25.520]  merry and again it's meant to defile people it's meant to abuse groups it's meant to put down
[35:25.520 --> 35:31.280]  protestants put down catholics put down christians and set the precedent that we're allowed to abuse
[35:31.280 --> 35:36.320]  you we're allowed to send in al-qaeda in libya and syria to hunt down and blow up churches
[35:36.320 --> 35:40.880]  and kill christians and mass and it's not even going to be in the u.s news we're going to give
[35:40.880 --> 35:49.600]  obama a peace price okay how about five more for that so i'm saying hey i'm not going to buy you know
[35:49.600 --> 35:55.840]  some big boat some giant hundred thousand dollar cabin cruiser though that's kind of sounds good
[35:55.840 --> 36:02.240]  i'm going to take that money and i'm going to say hey hundred thousand dollars the first place
[36:02.240 --> 36:07.600]  to get people into the act of resistance and then out of that i'm going to try to work with the
[36:07.600 --> 36:13.040]  filmmakers the winners and others to create a larger film division here so we can produce a
[36:13.040 --> 36:18.080]  bunch of films that i produce but that i don't have to direct because my greatest frustration one of
[36:18.080 --> 36:22.480]  my greatest frustrations in life is that i get off the air at like two o'clock i got a bunch of
[36:22.480 --> 36:27.840]  administrative stuff to do sometimes i do the nightly news or i've got a vet stories and then
[36:27.840 --> 36:33.920]  i'm in there trying to do obama deception too and i can make as good a documentary as anybody
[36:33.920 --> 36:40.560]  i can do the whole cinematic nine yards we've done short films you've seen that but then i end up
[36:40.560 --> 36:46.960]  putting out great informational films but but i can't just in the time frames i've got put out the
[36:46.960 --> 36:54.800]  real masterworks but i'm working as hard as i can but i can go out and find other amazing
[36:54.800 --> 36:59.360]  filmmakers who can prove that in two months they can make a powerful film so that i can
[36:59.360 --> 37:07.200]  then work with them talk to them and try to fund them still on a shoestring budget but
[37:07.200 --> 37:12.320]  hundred thousand dollars two hundred thousand dollars in phase two to put out a couple of
[37:12.320 --> 37:18.240]  info wars produced films every year with the goal of reaching people and hopefully then making enough
[37:18.240 --> 37:24.240]  money back to make more that's why i put in over a hundred percent of the money that comes in now
[37:24.240 --> 37:28.560]  i wore chested money over the last decade a little bit now i've gone into the phase of
[37:28.560 --> 37:33.200]  expending that cashola because i'm not going to sit here later when the global is totally
[37:33.200 --> 37:38.400]  take over and shut off the free press and just wish i would have done more so i want to salute
[37:38.400 --> 37:43.600]  everyone that entered the contest you can see all of them in info wars dot com forward slash
[37:43.600 --> 37:50.240]  paul for paul revere info wars dot com forward slash paul you can see the top 35 and then hundreds
[37:50.240 --> 38:01.440]  and hundreds of others uh after the top finalist and then you can uh uh take that information
[38:03.440 --> 38:08.000]  and take the video that you think is the most important and send it to your friends your family
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.560]  because hey maybe you don't like alex jones style maybe i don't like my style sometimes maybe
[38:12.560 --> 38:17.200]  maybe you think i'm too harsh or i'm too angry or whatever the case is well i've got all these
[38:17.200 --> 38:23.120]  reporters you can see what they do on the nightly news whoever your fancy is whether it's uh somebody
[38:23.120 --> 38:29.040]  like jacari jackson or whether it's darin mcbreen or paul watson or uh leon macadoo or whoever it is
[38:29.040 --> 38:36.720]  or john bound or any of the great people we've got here uh that's why i'm trying to build a larger
[38:36.720 --> 38:40.960]  organization i've got all these writers with different flair and different research and
[38:40.960 --> 38:46.160]  different acumen and different gravitas i'm trying to build an organization to really
[38:46.160 --> 38:51.760]  challenge the globalist but more importantly to challenge the people we the people you out

[45:40.160 --> 45:46.400]  because it's a commitment not to a trophy wife and a 25 million dollar jet and the biggest house at
[45:46.400 --> 45:52.240]  the end of the street it is a commitment to making history and crushing the new world order it is a
[45:52.240 --> 45:57.120]  commitment to going all the way whether we beat them back them off or whether they kill me i am
[45:57.120 --> 46:02.560]  committed and i have sworn on the altar of god eternal resistance over every form of tyranny
[46:02.560 --> 46:08.880]  over the mind of men that didn't mean to go off into that jag right there uh it's just that we're
[46:08.880 --> 46:16.720]  making history as as rag tag and as obnoxious as i am i've got guts and the intellect god gave me and

[56:51.680 --> 56:57.680]  kareem abdul jabar's why did he commit to crime please okay this is getting a lot of people
[56:57.680 --> 57:03.520]  upset is turning white people into races i think that's their agenda of course it is of course that's
[57:03.520 --> 57:07.840]  all planned you know but it's it's not gonna work though okay because we're gonna backfire on them
[57:07.840 --> 57:13.920]  and all those people together we're gonna come together collectively to fight the new world order
[57:13.920 --> 57:18.160]  that's what's gonna happen well that's what i'm trying to do and when i got that black panther
[57:18.160 --> 57:23.680]  national leader on yesterday he had to be nice and and and met humanity but he goes back it's
[57:23.680 --> 57:27.840]  his horrible stuff to his group because that's what sells that's what sells at the clan rallies
[57:27.840 --> 57:32.400]  but when but when you're being human with somebody and going you know we're being engineered to do
[57:32.400 --> 57:37.600]  this there's no one that won't go you know you're right the media is doing this to divide us it
[57:37.600 --> 57:42.480]  doesn't matter whether zimmerman's guilty or not they tried to frame him so as jimmy carter said
[57:42.480 --> 57:49.600]  he has to go free but it's not like i'm like yes george zimmerman goes free when when i mean i i
[57:49.600 --> 57:53.760]  mean i i don't know he looks like kim jung unto me but i don't think north korea did this
[57:54.880 --> 57:59.760]  another thing alex i think you got to get more exposure to that new article you got up about
[57:59.760 --> 58:07.440]  the uh the black gentleman which had the same issue yep and it was a and it was a completely i've
[58:07.440 --> 58:12.240]  now looked the guy up we're getting him on it was a completely white grand jury that no billed him
[58:12.240 --> 58:18.320]  oh those white racist the black guy shoots a white kid breaking in a car that rushes him and the white
[58:18.320 --> 58:23.920]  racist they didn't put the black guy in jail you see that's why the that's why the defense attorney
[58:23.920 --> 58:29.760]  rightly rightly said if george zimmerman would have been a black guy living in that area that
[58:29.760 --> 58:36.160]  dressed nice it'd be over he never would have been indicted it's an absolute fact it's how you dress

[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:05.520]  detroit rock city but ross perot warned he said detroit will be gone you bring in nafta you bring

[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:38.960]  one of the entries is about that we had some entries that came in too late so we obviously can't
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:42.960]  have them in the contest but they're in the honorable mention for the film festival info wars
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:48.560]  dot com forward slash paul you can see the top 35 entries right there please make those go viral

[01:12:54.080 --> 01:13:03.520]  up an arsenal an armory of info war weapons i'm salivating but these films are weapons of truth
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:09.520]  against lies but the people that made them those are the real weapons and i can't wait it's going
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:15.120]  to be a royally tough job to meet the top 20 30 people and talk to them and see what their ideas
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:26.400]  are for films to be produced by info wars films a dream revered is about detroit what what a shame
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:31.920]  what a shame what a shame and the plan is on record according to al gore according to morris
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:37.440]  strung according to all of them yeah i like how a dream revered starts because it shows the debates
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:43.200]  between al gore and uh and ross perot and then some of the presidential debates
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.840]  uh and and actually the i think the guy that made the movie is the guy that asked the question in
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:57.040]  the film and then it's i think it's the same guy so it's just amazing amazing all right i get a

[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:08.720]  modification program going on but it's classified oh but but rachel madhouse says i'm crazy it doesn't
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:15.600]  exist yes exactly yes it but they love us i mean but the government's promoting trevon martin's death
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:20.480]  because they really care about black people that is the ones they didn't get aborted everything's
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:27.520]  a distraction now it's all distractions but at least we're step by step inch by inch defeating

[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:38.560]  his idiot constituents uh and it doesn't mean republicans are much better but it means i mean
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.760]  just the dip the the the obama people are idiots buying into that whole cult of personality fraud
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:48.480]  and after he's he cheated them so many times and over and over again he's gonna get the economy
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.480]  going all right and the mainstream media is in freefall but that's when they're most dangerous
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:18:00.720]  because they they are melting down and the cia is publicly taking over msnbc cnn all of them right now
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:06.480]  trying to get it going and it's not going to work because we know your cia which isn't even american

[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:33.200]  out of fox news eight out of california money for eugenics victims part of state budget plan
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:40.800]  10 million dollars to be paid to the tens of thousands sterilized between 1929 and 1974
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:45.520]  oh but what they don't tell you is just last week the la times had to admit they're still
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:50.240]  forcibly sterilizing thousands against the law but no one will go to jail for that either
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:56.480]  and that's just because people know it's illegal and blow the whistle but then they get fired
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:04.400]  i mean this government is criminal man they put stuff in your water to reduce your fertility
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.600]  and dumb you down and i'm going to be getting into all that right now let's go to allen oh by
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.880]  the way i'm going to get for spring mero manali news next week i'll try again to see if he's got
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:17.120]  good skype get that author on about the illuminati let's go to allen in georgia uh you're on the
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:24.320]  air go ahead yes sir yes i have a qualm with the uh the liberty delivery movement as it is
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:29.920]  right now i mean we've got all these perspectives you've got co-cash you've got i have a qualm as
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:37.120]  well yes yes and i'll and well and my idea is possibly an anti-builder burr group meeting
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:44.640]  where it's info wars hosted and you have uh you know very influential uh perspectives from all
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:50.720]  all ends of the of the planet and you know have it open as opposed to closed and concealed and
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:56.640]  it's not a felony you know and be open to the to the public but there definitely needs to be some
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:02.160]  type of of of cohesiveness i mean been sure of getting on the ballot i mean that that is a huge
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:07.280]  step uh in my opinion yeah but i don't think there's one big bold step it's going to be all this
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:12.720]  it's about individuals waking up saying no to the power structure but having lots of events
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:18.720]  having lots of rallies and having it's basically people getting involved themselves and going out
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:23.520]  and confronting injustice that will defeat this system god bless you good to hear from you allen
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:28.000]  it's a very interesting idea like a shadow builder burr conference i'm talking about a second american
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:34.480]  revolution tour around the country after i finish obama deception too maybe let's talk to scott in

[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:48.160]  are you into day three of celebration yeah right that's about us the top on my list about going
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:53.520]  out and buying a brand new role choice for myself that's really at the high list of my priorities
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:28:00.160]  right now for the royal baby well yeah we have a long time no talk i think the last time i talked
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:05.520]  to you you had that silly house sparks on and i was taking him to task about why he was getting
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:13.200]  obama such a path but um anyway um i'm glad i just wanted to talk a little bit about the
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:20.800]  trade on situation only to this extent i'm glad that you had larry elder on a few days ago because
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:26.800]  i watched that whole clip of him and pierce morgan by the way larry elders back on the nightly news
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:33.440]  tonight with us with updates but go ahead oh okay yeah he really made him look like a fool and like
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:38.800]  the racist and basically calling i mean larry elder is i wish i was as articulate as he is
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:44.560]  he's really he's really smart he basically called him out by the time he got through with him pierce
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:49.840]  morgan had that same look on his face as he did one night when you finished with him well no that's
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:54.080]  the thing pierce morgan went from a million viewers when he got the show two and a half years ago
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:29:00.000]  to 400 000 and at current rates he'll have 200 000 within a year i mean he's a joke folks
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:08.240]  wabc has 400 000 listeners they estimate uh during drive time in the morning one radio
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:13.280]  station these but you don't see the radio host walking around with capes on like their royalty
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:18.960]  i mean these people are a joke we have over a million listeners an hour on terrestrial radio
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:26.240]  conservatively what where am i just people worshiping me and oh pierce morgan oh and then
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:30.560]  pierce morgan i almost hate the fact that got so much attention when i was on there
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:34.160]  because it was on every show basically in the english-speaking world that was seen by hundreds
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:40.320]  of millions but not because it's pierce morgan what i said on there went mega viral shall i
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:46.240]  hear you brother absolutely we'll be right back with some incredibly important health news your

[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:11.200]  every great leader has had to understand the potential of information billions of dollars
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:18.800]  have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche from compulsory

[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:28.720]  and the seals have all said they thought it was a setup and i've talked to somebody that
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.800]  is in the seals currently they're not had a friend in seal team six who's actually alive and
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.880]  but a bunch of other weird accidents i tell you if you were part of that fake bin laden raid
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:42.960]  you're going to be dead or they're going to really really work work hard on trying to get that done
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:48.080]  so seal team six families forced congress to investigate mysterious copter crash at
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:55.360]  steve watson's article uh out today but is also in the hill so that article is up on info wars.com
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:59.920]  and prismplanet.com we've had facebook blocking us by the way when we post stuff about the seal
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:07.200]  deaths so and and they're run by the y-house so they do not want this looked into i talked to
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:10.720]  one seal and he goes yeah the survivors of seal team six those that weren't on the helicopter
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.760]  they think it's weird they were all put on an old shinook it wasn't a real rescue mission
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:21.200]  we know the mission was fake we just think al qaeda planted a bomb on board so an al qaeda
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:28.960]  gave you a fake mission oh we just yeah al qaeda may have infiltrated the navy command and it's like
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:35.040]  don't come on you're smart come on you're not stupid who runs al qaeda that whole bin laden
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:42.960]  raid was fake you know that they're killing you the controversy is not over then putting him on
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:48.080]  the cover rolling stone like he's a hero they're saying he's the bomber the boston bombing suspect
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:52.880]  there's no blood coming out his throat he was set up his brother was in the cia that's been confirmed
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:58.560]  there was a drill they've killed his friends they've killed fbi agents that were there in the arrest
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:04.080]  they're killing people this is a government operation done the day they plunge gold and
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:10.640]  silver with put options i mean come on folks of course the globalist will kill a whole village
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:16.000]  to get one person they want to kill our government gave nerve gases a dom to attack the iranians and
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:24.160]  then use the the fact that he used nerve gases reason to invade iraq that's how dumb they think
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:28.640]  you are folks that our government's funding al qaeda to kill christians everywhere because it's not
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:35.360]  our government you know i saw some people with the film the purge that's at info wars dot com
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:40.400]  four slash paul in the paul revere film contest area and it's in the top 10 i'll tell you right
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:44.320]  now i don't know if it's gonna win this in the top 10 and they're like this film's too radical
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:51.520]  it shows dhs people shooting other dhs people at the end and i'm like no it doesn't
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:59.280]  this is a foreign globalist group the archetype they use germans it's mainly just just globalist
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:04.400]  a whole cross section but they do use foreign troops in this whole thing where so people get
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:10.640]  hey foreigners of hijacked america foreign but it's offshore above any nation it's global crime
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:16.960]  corporate syndicate has taken control and is saying they want to purge veterans and gun owners
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:23.600]  this is real this is going on this is happening this is true this is not a joke and in the i mean
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:29.600]  if a hijacker put on the pilots this happened before they find that the people submit because
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:34.080]  well the hijacker they just saw with a hanger named a gun they happen back in the 70s in one case
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:41.520]  has put on the pilot outfit everybody starts submitting because it's it's the uniform
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:45.120]  it's like they found people won't fight back against the rapist dressed up like a cop
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:50.240]  or against a cop cops get caught raping women all the time you know criminals get on the force
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:53.840]  because and the women don't don't don't don't resist like they normally would but well you've
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:38:00.800]  got a uniform yes sir i i'll do whatever you say sir this is the mass stock home syndrome
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:07.920]  that i'm getting at here and the film depicts the foreign global criminals that have taken over
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:14.160]  being taken out if they start trying to arrest and kill patriots and massy it will be a shooting war
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:20.240]  but the issue is is they found mentally ill people brain dead people flat out criminals and
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:23.920]  there are a lot of foreigners that work in it as well a lot of socialists it's mainly if it's a
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:28.720]  cult it's socialist low level and communists that are the enforcers that actually want to go out
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:34.640]  you saw the petitions on whitehouse.gov we're going to be in a few seconds in a moment uh
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:39.520]  back uh when the states were talking about seceding or or states rights and i called for
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:43.920]  second american peaceful revolution last year there were petitions everywhere put out by democratic
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:52.240]  party groups saying let's form a government militia and kill all the tea partiers and you saw
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:56.640]  mark dice go out and say should we arrest and or kill or take the guns of the tea partiers and
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:01.200]  every democrat is like yes let's kill them let's take their guns let's put them in femacamps
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:08.240]  and he wasn't just picking crazy people that's san diego and la mainly la i mean they're they're
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:13.120]  saying that because it's their thing the government's good i'm with it yeah let's kill people we
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:19.360]  disagree with this is how dangerous this is folks and as things collapse all their leftist
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.520]  minions who aren't even leftist they're authoritarian nutballs they're going to do just give me my
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:27.920]  pension give me my paycheck yeah i'll put i'll put veterans in a work brigade i'll put them in
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:33.760]  a reeducation camp they dream of this and let me tell you all you're going to get coming after me
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:39.600]  and my family is your butt shot off okay and i'm not looking for this fight you and the globalists
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:43.520]  are going to blow up a daycare again or something and say the right wing or libertarians did it
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:48.240]  when they roll against us and all i'm saying is your purge is the end of your butts and i think
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:52.560]  they figured that out now we've already exposed the false flag where everybody knows about it so
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:56.400]  we're going to be watching when you do that we're ready to go all the way we don't care if you
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:59.760]  can't at least i don't care if you kill me i don't want to die but i'm committed so that's just the
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:06.480]  end of it um it's like again i fear death dying in a car wreck for no reason or being mugged by
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:10.880]  nobody and dying or something i fear that i don't want to die but when it comes to fight the new
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:16.000]  world order that's already putting poison in the water on purpose you it's got to be resisted it's
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:23.600]  it's a default there's no decision to be made i'm i'm all in against you basic instinct you're
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:27.840]  attacking me i'm aware who you are i'm going to figure out how to beat you and how to expose you
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:32.720]  and i've been doing it 18 years and i'm a testament to the human will look how far we've come
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:39.120]  zero help from family well my dad helped me set up a computer to take online orders
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:47.360]  zero help folks you helped me we helped each other we did this and then places like drudge
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:51.120]  report dot com help us get the word out in some world net daily and so many others and people
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:54.880]  could say well world that daily's still kind of right wing whatever they're coming along the right
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:41:02.720]  direction they're real people i've gone and met with them in dc the whole point is ladies and
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:06.320]  gentlemen is you got to decide what side you're on whether you work in the system or anywhere
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:10.960]  else we know this new world order stinks to high heaven we know the fruits of it are rotten
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:16.960]  and poisonous and man can we get off this this this road we're on can we all agree this ain't
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:22.640]  a good idea i mean and you government people think you're gonna have some macho war because
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:27.040]  you were brought up by you know leftist or whatever you really believe all that that college stuff
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:33.280]  they told you it's just a bunch of bull you're not even a leftist all right that's enough i'm
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:38.240]  going to go to our guests because i wanted to get him on when i saw a constellation of articles
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:41.440]  just for a brief little interview you'll be with still five after and then i got your own course
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:45.680]  you pop it in i saw a constellation of articles in the last week and i wanted to get him on about
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:50.240]  this ben fuchs is very successful registered pharmacist nutritionist cosmetic chemist and
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:54.640]  founder of eco comp pharmacy and rocky mountain natural habitories very successful inventor

[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:09.760]  i'll do that at the end of course it's because it's important it funds us but most importantly
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:13.120]  it's super good products that are there on the free shipping available at enforce health dot
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:17.520]  com the lowest prices but the point here is is that ben fuchs i wanted to get him on to talk
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:23.200]  about a constellation of stories here and i wanted to talk about this first two new studies a document
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:28.800]  can please for tv viewers harvard school of public health impact of florida neurological
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:39.760]  development children finds a massive iq uh reduction with just one year of the 1.6 parts
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:43.280]  per million that the government recommends in the water they've now cut that down because these
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:48.240]  studies causes on average upwards of 20 point iq reduction and then it gets into the other
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:53.280]  20 plus studies of cancer you name it okay the stuff they're putting in your water is one ring
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:56.720]  and the you can't blame the public they're a bunch of brain damage zombies those of us that
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:02.480]  would have had 160 iqs have 140 iqs those of us that would have had a hundred iq got 80 iqs
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:06.080]  and god forbid you were gonna have an 80 iq folks you've got like a 60 i mean you can hardly tell
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:11.360]  your shoelaces and and or even understand what i'm saying mission accomplished why won't they
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:17.680]  hire cops now under uh over a hundred iq that's on record because they found people under a hundred
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:23.360]  iq will not figure things out so if you're wondering why you didn't get accepted to the force
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:27.840]  she got to go in there and act stupid on on the test but act like you'll follow orders
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:33.600]  that's what they're looking for i saw a group of cadets i'm not going to get into it a large portion
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:37.840]  that could hardly swim and some had to be fished out and could not swim it had to be put in life
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:42.880]  jackets at at a thing i saw a deep eddy i mean i mean come on because you've got to look to find
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:48.560]  people like that that's not what cops used to be like okay so again i mean they want people
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:53.040]  dumber in a box of rocks and it's it's like that across the board because smart people tend to not
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:58.320]  want to be slaves now here's another one so so they've been put in the water since the late 40s
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:02.560]  what the soviets and the nazis put in the water dumb people down on record look it up
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:07.440]  it's a Pulitzer prize winning books on the soviets and the nazis put in fluoride in the water to
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:11.680]  make it docile i mean it's just so over the top they get away with it now here's the business
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:19.680]  insider how avoiding fluoride can actually help your brain cells i'm gonna get to study on that
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:26.720]  but here's the other article how adding iodine to salt resulted in a decade's worth of IQ gains
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:34.080]  for the united states and it's a business insider article they started in 1924 uh took it out
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:41.520]  uh stopped the mandate a few decades later and they found a massive IQ increase in the studies on
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:48.000]  that now enter the fluoride that's meant to lower your IQ so see it shows the different
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:53.600]  elements in government the good the bad and the ugly and so we're going to be getting to all that
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:59.280]  and also the demonization of fish oil and all these new york times articles saying oh you don't
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:05.360]  need vitamins they're bad for you insane stuff pharmacist ben fuchs joins us uh what is your
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:10.560]  take on this and now the new york times coming out and also have one out of the what wall street
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:15.760]  journal saying the vitamin myth why we think we need supplements i mean i mean they're really
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:20.320]  pushing this but first get into the fluoride for us pharmacist ben fuchs and the uh the because
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:28.000]  you're always hyping up and and and harping on iodine to me privately iodine iodine iodine
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.840]  you know the proper cweeds the uh the amount of filing we sell it in for store.com what is going
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:38.240]  on with the iodine well first of all god bless you alex for the work you're doing i mean you're
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:42.240]  just you're amazing people should be getting their news their health news from you not the new york
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:50.080]  times secondly iodine is the leading cause of mental retardation in children around the world
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:54.320]  iodine deficiency that is so we've known about the relationship between iodine and brain health
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:46:00.880]  for for decades at the same time we've known about the antagonistic relationship between fluoride
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:06.960]  and iodine so that while iodine deficiency causes mental retardation fluoride increases iodine
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:12.720]  deficiency by acting and acting antagonistically so this is not news to biochemist this is not news
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:17.280]  to nutritional chemists it may be mainstream news but it's not news to people who are in the know
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:22.240]  iodine by the way is much more than a brain nutrient and it's much more than a thyroid
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:25.840]  nutrient most people recognize it as being important for the thyroid but what a lot of people don't
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:31.280]  recognize is that iodine is important for all of the glands in your body it is a glandular
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:36.640]  mineral that means for not just your thyroid gland but for your pancreas which is uh which is a gland
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:42.800]  for your thymus which is a major immune gland for your adrenal glands and we know millions of people
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:49.040]  are dealing with adrenal health issues what this all boils down to is the fact that there is a war
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:57.200]  on not just for our minds alex but for our biochemistry we are biochemical beings we interpret
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:02.720]  the world through our biochemistry we walk through the world through our biochemistry we live our
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:07.760]  lives as biochemical entities and what you're seeing as evidenced by these all of these studies
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:12.960]  that are coming out against fish oil and against vitamins is a manipulation an attempt to manipulate
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:19.280]  the human biochemical being and the only the only way we have to protect ourselves from this kind
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:23.040]  of biochemical and by the way just to back you up for radio listeners because there's all these
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:28.160]  articles saying don't have iodine it's evil it's horrible the government loves you here's the new
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:35.200]  york times admitting millions of retarded children every decade from lack of iodine china
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:40.640]  confronts retardation of millions deficient in iodine and so they put fluoride in that blocks
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:46.640]  the iodine takes over the glands the pineal you name it they know exactly what listen i take
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:52.160]  modifier on that you and i know also the health ranger said no this is the stuff since i've been
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:58.080]  taking that for a year we sell it in for us health dot com i get high off of it i mean i get i get
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:04.640]  crazed off of off of that seaweed what's happening oh my goodness seaweed is the most powerful food
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:09.920]  on the planet and what's happening to the oceans is singularly affecting not just the fish but the
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:16.400]  seaweed fortunately seaweed has has a detoxification molecules that help protect it but the fact of
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:19.840]  the matter is that the trashing of our oceans not only affects our fish but it also affects the
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:24.800]  stuff that grows in our fish bottom line there are so many ways that we can protect ourselves from
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:31.760]  the rape of our biochemical bodies and i'm saying that with intent that's exactly what is occurring
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:36.800]  are not our physical bodies are being raped it's our biochemical bodies that are being raped
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:43.040]  by manipulation through chemtrails through toxins in the water through a mandatory vaccinations
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:48.640]  through prescription drugs it's almost endless the ways that our biochemistry is being manipulated
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:54.560]  but alex the good news is is that via things like nutritional supplementation via nutritional
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:49:00.400]  supplements like the beyond tangy tangerine via seaweed via the the uh a modifier on like
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:06.560]  you were talking about via good food via eating less we can take control of our bodies we can
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:12.320]  take control of our biochemistry so we can have the strength to withstand the onslaught not just
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:18.000]  against our biochemistry but also against our minds because as you say every day there's a war on
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:23.200]  for our minds but as long as our bodies are weak as long as we are sick we're not going to be able
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:28.320]  to handle this war so job number one so that we can handle the war on for our minds is to take
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:32.880]  care of our biochemistry to take care of our biochemical bodies and the message that i've
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:38.240]  been talking about now for going on 20 years is the key to the whole process is to get yourself on
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:43.280]  a powerful nutritional supplement program it's like armor to with be able to withstand the
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:49.120]  biochemical onslaught that's coming at us from from all kinds of different fronts i've got an
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:55.760]  article here at pharmacist ben fuchs uh written by uh the paul off it the same guy that said kids
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:02.800]  can have thousands of vaccines this is the vitamin myth why we think we need supplements well
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:08.480]  it's on record that most of the soils are depleted and i've had um people like dottardine
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:13.520]  adelon before who says you don't need vitamins and i go you mean you don't need vitamins if the food
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:18.080]  had what you needed but you admit the soil is depleted and he went well yes you're right on
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:26.320]  that front so they're obviously being pushed to to tell people now we see oh this soil gives you
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:33.680]  uh cancer uh of the uh you know certain different parts of the uh body like the prostate i want
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:38.480]  to come back and talk about these incredible lies because i saw your counter to it i saw
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:42.560]  the counters by medical doctors and others saying this is ridiculous everybody knows
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:46.800]  fish oil does amazing things uh also tell us about some of the other vitamins and minerals
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:53.040]  that are known to just turn off uh the colon cancer cells the clemson study uh with beyond
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:57.840]  tangy tangerine folks by the way found a massive reduction in cancer cells i mean these are real

[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:18.960]  gets from the south pacific in areas down by new zealand that don't have the pollution of the northern
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:23.760]  hemisphere or anywhere near it and he was like man my hair is growing faster my nails are going
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:28.560]  faster i've lost weight i'm healthy and and he religiously takes his monofilone i was thinking

[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:50.080]  right now now briefly because i want to get uh into some of the other medical news happening
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:56.880]  with pharmacist ben fuchs what do you make of the beyond tangy tangerine 2.0 now non-gmo pesticide
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:03.280]  free whole food certified 8 000 total orac per serving score well i tell you something beyond
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:07.440]  tangy tangerine is always a wonderful product but if anybody had any kind of knocks on it it would
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:12.720]  have been it would have been the uh the gmo stuff and the new beyond tangy tangerine is non-gmo
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:18.000]  you know i've been talking about btt now for 16 years alex and i it was called uh tangy tangerine
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.960]  before it was called beyond tangy tangerine and when i say that this stuff is the single most
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:29.360]  amazing supplement that you can take in terms of in terms of a uh a liquid supplement i'm telling
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:35.120]  you based i'm telling you this based on my observations of literally hundreds if not thousands
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:40.000]  of different patients who have exhibited exactly in fact you promoted i'm told over a decade before
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.080]  you even got involved with the longevity that's exactly right i got involved with it as a pharmacist
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:48.880]  because i saw that people were getting off their prescription drugs by using the the tangy tangerine
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:53.280]  at the time and they went to beyond tangy tangerine now it's beyond tangy tangerine 2.0 and i blogged
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:56:00.000]  about this at pharmacistben.com it's a liquid format it's loaded with nutrients it's non-gmo
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.320]  and the beautiful thing about the liquid format is it means if you have digestive problems
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:08.640]  you're not going to be absorbing your nutrients and your supplements your ordinary supplements but
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:13.760]  because it's a liquid it goes right to work it bypasses any digestive problems and you feel the
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:19.360]  effects within 24 to 48 hours effects like weight loss effects like appetite suppression and most
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:24.480]  importantly from the way i look at it effects like a reduction an ability to reduce your
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:29.520]  prescription drugs let me talk about real quick about this vitamin myth article because you
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:34.800]  could tell how ignorant the author of this article is or whoever wrote the headline was by this idea
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:40.880]  of equating vitamins with supplements you see alex there are a lot of times medical professionals
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:46.320]  will talk about vitamins when they mean supplements the word vitamin is a very specific term there's
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:51.760]  only there's only two water soluble vitamins a little bit more if you consider the b complex
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:57.040]  individually and four fat soluble vitamins basically six vitamins 16 if you consider them all
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:04.480]  all the sub vitamins in any case vitamins are not optional they're not optional because if you
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:11.120]  are deficient in them you suffer a deficiency disease deficiency diseases like your gums fall
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:16.160]  your teeth breaking falling off of your gums that's called scurvy deficiency diseases like
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:21.280]  where you can't move your nerves or you can't move your muscles that's called berry berry deficiency
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:28.880]  diseases like polygrid diarrhea dermatitis dementia and death and what's worse you have sub
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:35.120]  clinical deficiency diseases that is deficiency diseases that don't show up as death or will
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:38.560]  you have to go end up in the hospital but just show up as a little bit for forgetfulness or a
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:43.200]  little bit of loose stools or rashes that your doctor will tell you are unexplainable let me
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:47.280]  stop you want to come back in five more minutes i'll let you finish but i have a susanne humphries

[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:58.800]  speech on his own site vaccine inventor paul off it seeks end to religious and philosophical

[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:59.200]  polymers plus uh or the beyond tangy tangerine 2.0 i mean and then you also support the liberty
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:03.920]  movement but that's all an informers health.com a side issue finishing up with the point you were
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:09.600]  making well you know you you hit the nail on the head i dedicated my life my professional life my
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:14.800]  personal life my spiritual life to helping people get better and then i have to i have to do the
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:19.520]  clean up the muck the mess that's left behind by guys like dr off at writing these ridiculous
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:25.840]  articles talking about vitamins uh why why we don't need vitamins are you kidding me these things
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:30.480]  are essential and the word essential means that you are dead in the water without them and then
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:35.520]  he's going to tell you that you should be vaccinated as opposed to getting uh using vitamins and using
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:39.760]  nutritional supplementation listen i could sit here and talk till i'm blue in the face about the
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:44.480]  importance of supplements and the importance of vitamins but everybody out there you owe it to
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:51.040]  yourself you owe it to your family to at least give nutritional supplementation a shot and this is
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:55.280]  even more imperative if you're dealing with some kind of disease state which is the way i look at
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:02:01.040]  it in my experience the disease states are nothing more than the manifestation of nutritional
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:06.800]  deficiencies not just in vitamins but also in mineral but no one can deny that it's a huge
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:12.400]  part of it bare minimum and but then hospitals do nothing for nutrition if you come in if you
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:16.960]  old people get scurvy all the time it's on record with their skin falling off they bump a wall a
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:21.440]  hole no one says hey you getting vitamin c that's right they just say oh we're going to put you on
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:26.880]  you know these drugs if you go to the doctor with rash it with a little spots little red spots on
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:31.760]  your legs or on your arms the doctor's going to say he has no idea what causes it they just happen
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:36.000]  but if you go look up scurvy or go to google images and look up scurvy you're going to see the
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.720]  exact same dots that your dermatologist will give you some steroid or immune suppressant and tell
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:46.080]  you has no idea what's causing it you'll see the exact same a picture of the exact same condition
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:52.960]  under the heading of scurvy this is because these are subclinical conditions they're not bad enough
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:57.600]  to cause you to die but they're bad enough to cause you to be miserable and all you need is small
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:02.400]  amounts of nutritional hey what's the what's the mineral that just i was reading a few last year
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:07.600]  mainline study about knocking out people getting colon cancer what was the mineral probably selenium
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:12.720]  yeah that was it mono and those powerful anti-cancer nutrients you could take doc wall some time
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:17.520]  at selenium for 20 years oh hey i know i got you on what about this study that was out yesterday big
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:23.200]  scientific study but we pull that up that men that skip breakfast uh are like 20 something
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:28.480]  times more likely uh to have heart attacks or Kellogg sponsors Kellogg sponsored that and
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:32.880]  general mill sponsored that study that's a study put out by the cereal industry you know started
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:38.320]  the big breakfast idea was a guy named uh paul uh bernay's edward bernay yeah i'm sure you know
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:42.400]  that he's the guy who came up with the whole big breakfast idea what you want to do for you believe
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:46.720]  in the opposite right you believe in a lot no you do not want a big breakfast you want a very
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:50.160]  small breakfast in fact you don't want a big anything when it comes to meals you want nutritional
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:54.080]  supplements you want smoothies you want liquid nutrients but you don't want to put a big load
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:57.520]  on your digestive system first thing in the morning and you don't want to put a big load
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:02.800]  on your digestive system at any time the key to immune health the key to health in general
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:07.440]  is to make sure that your digestive system is as clean and pristine as possible alex even when
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:12.160]  you eat a good meal you activate inflammation and you activate the immune system let alone the
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:16.000]  standard american diet let alone the crap they want you to eat let alone the crap that gets
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:21.680]  advertised on tv to our kids and to our family the less you eat the longer you live and one of
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:25.680]  the keys to restricting your calories is to get yourself on a good nutritional supplement program
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:29.040]  now as i was saying before i went to the break i can talk till i'm blue in the face about the
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:34.080]  importance of supplementation but once you try a nutritional supplement program like the beyond
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:38.800]  tany tangerine or any nutritional supplement program once you get on high doses of vitamin c
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:42.080]  once you're getting your iodine once you're getting your selenium once you're making sure you're

[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:32.160]  the third hour back tonight seven o'clock with info wars and nightly news and info wars news
[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:37.280]  dot com and prison planet dot tv till the bottom of the hour we're joined by dr
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:43.040]  jerome coursey he's worked as a consultant with the state department and worked in international
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:49.920]  banking you name it he's a best-selling number one new york times best-selling author he also
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:53.840]  writes for world net daily he's got a new book out what went wrong we'll talk about that briefly
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:09:01.040]  before he leaves us but the main reason i wanted to get him on is that i've had friends family
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:06.640]  call me people in the office i've heard him on the the genesis network uh one of your sources
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:13.520]  the moriari family and they're on the air going believe us we promise there's jihadi's from
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:18.720]  saudi arabia when we had a business in libya and our government's funding them and we told the
[02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:23.520]  government and they tell al-qaeda we're to move and we promise we're not making this up i mean
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:30.960]  the cfr came out two years ago and said quote we need al-qaeda uh they admit the main force attacking
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:37.760]  syria and in libya before it is al-qaeda they admit the people that killed the ambassador at the safe
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:44.000]  house over the weapons deal was the vengazi local security force that is al-qaeda they have people
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:50.160]  with al-qaeda flags throwing the christians off roofs with the flags with the shaved heads and the
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:56.400]  big beards i mean every day there's new footage of them killing people and so it's you know i hear
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:01.280]  these folks on the radio and i guess i could get them on but it's kind of like alex believe us we
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:08.960]  were there the sun comes up the water is wet we promise that ducks quack uh so my whole issue is
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:13.600]  i know people like a story like witnesses to it but i've had reporters on that we're there and saw
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:18.640]  this when the war was going on wane madson webster tarpley you name it i mean there's the council
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:22.880]  on farm relations al-qaeda specter in syria and you go to the bottom of the article and it says
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:28.400]  truth is we need al-qaeda they're good fighters well and that was it again a year and a half ago
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:33.280]  this is all over the la times all over the news our government helped create al-qaeda against the
[02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:37.920]  russians they helped use them against the serbs clinton did and then they've used them again over
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:42.960]  and over again and they use the threat to take our liberties the boston bombers brother was in some
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:51.280]  cia program i mean the the ignorance level out there that is it true well of course he's writing
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:57.680]  that obama is protecting al-qaeda i mean it's like saying is it true that rudolf has a red nose
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:04.400]  is it true that the easter bunnies are rabid i mean it it just is unbelievable so dr corcy
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:10.960]  i wanted to get uh your take on this because i mean i've even seen the wall street journal
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:17.280]  admits 60 plus percent of the force in syria is al-qaeda they're leading it but there's this
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:22.160]  ignorance gap and then it's like well the u.s. is kind of halfway funding there's no kind of halfway
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:27.120]  what's really going on here and and how does this this this man and woman in their business
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:33.520]  over there that saw some of this how does that fit into this well the uh the moriardies who you
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:41.280]  prefer to join our husband have been sources but they have been in touch with libyan expatriates
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:48.320]  in the region and uh the documents is what have driven the stories i've written our documentary
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:57.280]  evidence of of the ties between al-qaeda and libya of al-qaeda and the vengazi attack all that you
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:02.560]  point out is true and you know the reason i continue to publish it the reason i want to continue
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:08.960]  publishing it is because the government the obama administration wants to the story to go away they
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:14.640]  want the obama administration wants to ignore the reality and the more documentation we can get
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:22.080]  that um you know proves from original sources including sources in the egyptian government
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:29.120]  that al-qaeda was involved in the or in fact morsey was involved the former head of egypt
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:35.120]  in the vengazi attack i think the documents are compelling well yeah that's why they got rid of the
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:41.760]  31 year globalist western install but he was a nice guy compared to morissi that's why they got rid
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:49.360]  of the last leader of egypt because because he uh he wasn't going along with shipping the weapons
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:58.720]  into al-qaeda uh out of um egypt into libya i mean that all came out too and also into
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:05.200]  syria i mean the they're shipping the weapons into now turkey and the al-qaeda weapons are up ending
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:12.160]  up in the so-called freedom fighters of the rebels in syria fighting Assad i mean in Assad
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:17.760]  in the in the battle in syria there's no good side they're both you know and we are probably
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:25.040]  going to end up backing the rebels which means siding once again with al-qaeda uh people still
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:31.280]  don't understand elix that the destabilization of the middle east was one of the obama administration
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:38.400]  main purposes in supporting what they call the arab spring the air spring was not a democracy
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:46.240]  movement there was no chance that the movements in the streets against mubarak in egypt or against
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:52.240]  qaddafi in libya were going to end up in anything resembling a western democracy they're all going
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:14:00.320]  to ultimately be co-opted and were by the muslim brotherhood and al-qaeda and you've got in libya
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:07.200]  today a situation that's really a chaos with various al-qaeda factions competing for control
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:15.600]  and we see uh different puppets uh being removed that you just mentioned like in egypt to put in
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:24.160]  moracy and then on top of that hazy mubarak just disappears all hell breaks loose uh we've got
[02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:30.400]  reports of israel reportedly aiding the rebels in the south uh with ambulances and weapons as well
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:35.440]  i know that's caused a fissure in israel i mean i get geopolitically i think it's very immoral
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:41.040]  stirring people up to kill each other but if it causes an even bigger destabilization and it's bad
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:47.360]  for american interest in any in any other interest then it's even more immoral because the way i see
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:52.320]  this is it's going to make it's going to make things only good for the weapons contractor so
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:57.440]  i mean what's what's the larger geopolitical things behind this well i agree with you i mean
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:02.480]  ultimately whether you know the cia manipulation that i'm sure is involved in the middle of this
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:10.560]  what the obama administration is achieving is destabilizing the entire region and pushing
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:17.200]  the region into much more of a radical islamic control now you know from israel's point of
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:23.040]  view it's going to be israel is increasingly threatened they had a submarine attack on
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:28.880]  evidently on syria to eliminate some of the missiles that syria has accumulated and that
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:35.760]  started up russia well russia is backing Assad and russia is backing iran and iran continues
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:42.000]  to push for nuclear weapons the obama administration is now insisted with secretary of state carry
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:50.160]  that israel negotiate willing to go back to the borders of the 1967 before the 1967 war
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:56.400]  well those borders are indefensible what i'm asking you is why is israel it looks like on the
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:02.160]  surface working with nato and the west on this it looks like a schizophrenic policy i get that they
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:07.680]  want to take down the iran regime i get they want to kick the ally Assad out i'm saying it's very
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:14.000]  immoral to go start a war with Assad two and a half years in back al-qaeda exterminate christians
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.960]  watch our media cover it up but then we're going to limitedly you know criticize obama for working
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:25.280]  with al-qaeda when he's really working in the larger nato plan to bring it down by hooker by crook
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:30.880]  to be able to go after iran and then my big issue is stop saying you've got to take my rights because
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:35.680]  of al-qaeda threat when the government clearly is using al-qaeda as a sock puppet so i mean
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:39.680]  let's just cut right to the chase of what's happening here well i think it's absolutely
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:45.600]  immoral to support al-qaeda i don't see how we can possibly do it especially after the big hoopla
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:55.040]  about killing insama bin laden and it's there's no way you can justify these radical islamic extremists
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:17:04.080]  armed uh wanting to destabilize regimes al-qaeda is the worst of the worst and al-qaeda stands for a
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:09.920]  lot of different radical elements that operate under al-qaeda and then i say should never be
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:14.720]  backing these i agree with you entirely i get it it doesn't let me ask you this getting off the
[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:21.040]  rhetoric that israel nato the u.s. france all put out i look at real facts i see a slowdown they
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:25.520]  claim they were going to send arms now looks like there's been a slowdown uh that looks like there
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:29.680]  are elements in the power structure that actually don't like this idea you have your ear to the
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:34.240]  ground in dc with a lot of high-level contacts are there real splits in the power structure
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:39.440]  overhanding the middle east over to al-qaeda yes there are there's very serious concerns about
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:46.880]  handing it over to al-qaeda and there's very serious concerns about iran becoming much more
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:55.120]  dominant in the region uh you also very unreported is that there is a sunni rebellion going on you
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:18:04.880]  saw it in the um abu grav prison riot this past weekend where a group of radical sunnis attacked
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:13.120]  abu grav and released basically al-qaeda sunnis uh they're opposing the shia regime that we put
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:18.640]  into place when we left iraq so iraq is about to be destabilized and and al-qaeda will be in the
[02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:23.840]  middle of that as well uh al-qaeda throughout the region and the bruh muslim brotherhood are
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:29.360]  working hand in hand yes so who controls al-qaeda the muslim brotherhood or sari arabia i think
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:35.840]  ultimately no one controls al-qaeda entirely i think al-qaeda has really become kind of a lawless
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:42.320]  criminal uh organization that is out for its own good and then and the defense contractors are the
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:47.680]  same because they just want to shell robots the local police and you know we still don't have
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:54.480]  alexa firm answer of what ben gazi was all about i mean were we running arms through ben
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:19:00.800]  gazi to the uh to the al-qaeda to destabilize qaddafi is that why well i think we know that's
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:05.600]  what happened i mean i would think so but i think that's why stevens was probably there
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:11.920]  even before he was ambassador and then ben gazi came in and a boat to ben gazi and then
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:18.720]  you know what was the reason for stevens being he had a meeting with one of the turkish diplomats
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:23.120]  in ben gazi the day he was killed foreign minister foreign minister what were they doing are they
[02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:28.400]  trying to recover weapons that they were you know these these manpans or other service
[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:34.160]  to air missiles that were lost and missing and probably being shipped through turkey that does
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:38.480]  sound like a double cross because i mean i can't imagine the globalists as corrupt as they are
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:43.920]  wanting al qaeda to have 10 000 heat seeking missiles and i you know again what was what was
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:52.160]  that meeting about uh also why didn't we send in military to help uh the americans who were
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:55.840]  under attack well stay there give us the latest update on ben gazi and then also tell us about

[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:30.560]  shut up here a what really went on at ben gazi what's going on with that cover up the navy seal
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:36.000]  families now want investigations of their helicopter blowing up that's happening obama's got the lowest
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:42.400]  approval rating ever congress does as well the whole thing's in free fall the nsa stuff's come out
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:49.120]  lowest approval rating ever for obama care what do you finish up with ben gazi and then
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:54.800]  what is the state of the republic right now and where things are going and what rabbits can obama
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:25:01.600]  pull out of the hat well first of all the the ben gazi investigation the key issues are the
[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:06.960]  survivors i think they are the ones who can tell the story of what happened on the ground and the
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:14.320]  survivors have been kept from congress uh those who have been retired or forced to retired have
[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:20.080]  been signing nondisclosure agreements a couple of the key survivors are talking to congress this
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:27.680]  week uh very behind the scenes one of them i think can be made to testify still with the
[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:34.400]  military and the issue uh there is no what was obama doing on the night of ben gazi what was
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:40.000]  was even in the white house why weren't we responding um well you know when you have
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:45.040]  officials saying well we couldn't get the airplanes over there we couldn't refuel them
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:51.680]  many uh pilots i know many air force pilots would say we don't care if you can refuel us well
[02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:55.920]  you tell us what we're gonna land we're gonna get over there and save these guys but that's all pure
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:26:01.120]  bull i mean that's all on record italy's right there there's us bases everywhere there's us
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:06.480]  aircrafts in the in the country but they're still denying it from the white house see that's the key
[02:26:06.480 --> 02:26:10.960]  point is the white house is still denying it and yeah but the testimony they already had
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:15.600]  contradicted the white house of course but yet you know one i'm one of the whole points i think
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:22.480]  it is trevon martin i've been saying it on radio is to whip up the country on a racial issue so
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:28.080]  as to shove off of the agenda make the news not cover no no just like the bin laden ray was meant
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:32.320]  to cover up your book on the birth certificate well and here you're covering up ben gazi you're
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:39.280]  coming out of covering up the irs investigation into the you know tea party discrimination which
[02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:46.560]  the administration using the irs to go after conservatives and by the way just as a footnote
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:52.880]  here people should be aware that if the obama administration was able to use the irs to go
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:27:00.720]  after tea party conservative groups the nsa is i'm sure going after selectively of course those
[02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:06.080]  that are conservatives turned out the cloakroom has been bugged and that's not even news exactly
[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:13.200]  and see the entire description of jip before japan and then the poly town will resign a targeting
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:18.560]  tea party members targeting conservatism alex targeting your audience oh yeah why did she
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:25.200]  really resign do you think well i think i think that there's just too much uh the investigations
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:31.680]  into the nsa i think are going to lead to the political use of that data motivated to go
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:38.000]  after conservatives driven by the popular homeland security targeting conservative groups
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:43.360]  every bit as much as the irs targeted consumer groups which is just flaming authoritarianism
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:48.720]  what does your gut tell you what happens to obama does he just sail off to the sunset
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:53.440]  does obama care get repealed do they false flag us what do they do well the major problem
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:57.440]  right now is that we're going to run out of money and that you're going to see this in
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:28:02.720]  detroit there's no way to bail out detroit there's probably two trillion dollars of unfunded pension
[02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:08.560]  liabilities cities and states are going to be going into default but over the next two years
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:15.440]  in a massive amount and obama care will probably be at least an effort made to defund it and i
[02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:20.720]  think a great number of democrats within congress are going to support that yeah even the unions
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:25.680]  have turned against obama care i mean this is going to be one of the most disastrous pieces
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:32.800]  of legislation ever passed but obama didn't pass it so it would work he passed it so the
[02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:38.800]  foot would be in the door even if it's repealed now he's established the principle of universal
[02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:44.320]  that's right it was clouted to pivot and and but put it up in place and then you expand it to the
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:49.360]  point where the system can't sustain it that's the entire approach to the obama social welfare
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:55.440]  yeah collapse the system and uh i mean it's incredible what a ripoff it is i can't believe
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:29:00.160]  raising payroll taxes on poor people that he's gotten away with that with his idiot constituents
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:07.520]  well and or the pitting of again you know the whole issue another issue getting people riled up
[02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:13.840]  about trevon martin is they don't ask them what is obama really done for african americans we have
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:18.400]  double digit unemployment among the african well he doubled their unemployment he did that form he
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:25.040]  and detroit a city which is 81 percent minority again you've got massive unemployment massive
[02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:30.480]  drug problem broken families children born out of wedlock and the obama administration has done
[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:36.480]  nothing to address these issues except to whip up the emotions of the people in a device so
[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:41.920]  exactly it's a giant diversion dr corsey we're going to talk to you very soon you want to do five

[02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:35.520]  jones we've really gotten to the moment of truth with obama care and globalism and all this where
[02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:40.800]  they are either going to really break this country forever or members of the establishment that who
[02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:46.720]  are not completely insane are going to back this off but you've got the big mega banks that are
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:53.440]  anti free market monopoly capitalists like bloomberg who are anti individual wealth and really
[02:33:53.440 --> 02:34:01.520]  disdain american values al gore people like that and here it is trayvon protest organized by communist
[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:06.160]  who pray Stalin and mal that's the story up on info wars dot com the revolutionary communist party
[02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:10.800]  has coordinated trayvon martin protest throughout the country and our article turns out this is in
[02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:15.760]  san francisco weekly this is confirmed they're not even denying this that the justice department's
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:20.400]  been involved as well and they've sent federally funded groups that we and others identified
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:26.560]  where they use you know kind of like acorn light groups and viral groups and others to go hold up
[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:32.960]  signs and pose as anti black races supporting zimmerman so we're seeing false flags just the
[02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:39.760]  dirtiest stuff being used to create political division and this is the essence of race-based
[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:44.640]  politics that you always see out of socialist and communist funded by the big monopoly capitalist
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:48.720]  i want you to speak to that briefly that paradox to try to explain that to conservatives and
[02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:53.680]  libertarians that don't click to that and that there are a lot of rich people that actually
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:58.720]  got it through government or insider deals and they're not our friends how do we deal with them
[02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:04.160]  supporting the the the the program of bankrupting the country because they're exempt from the taxes
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:09.520]  the regulations then let's talk about your new book and what it gets into and how we pull out of
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:15.040]  this well the book is about that i mean when i'm saying the book if you'll permit me just briefly
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:21.760]  is that um the obama invented it's kind of like moneyball to baseball obama created a new
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:29.600]  metrics in uh presidential politics so romney i was on the campaign playing for three weeks i
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:36.080]  traveled with romney as traveling press romney thought he had one coming back on election day
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:42.720]  told the press he had even written a concession speech romney didn't understand the game that the
[02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:48.720]  democrats were now playing just like a moneyball changes the way baseball is conceptualized and
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:55.200]  played on the field the point is that the democrats do play a divide and conquer form of
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:36:03.040]  very hardball interest group politics in which the idea is to you know whip up the black voters
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:08.080]  whip up the hispanics hispanics thought they were going to be deported if romney won you know and
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:16.720]  there's no attempt to deliver any benefits there's no attempt to get hispanics jobs or to get the
[02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:20.720]  dream act oh you can go to college but like everybody else in college what are you going to
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:25.440]  do afterwards you're going to drive a cab there aren't any jobs maybe people have to finally
[02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:32.880]  understand i think alexa what you said is true the divine and conquer politics the rub raw the
[02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:39.040]  like saul insky said the social the economic the racial distance well that's communism 101
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:45.840]  collapse thing so you can take over collapse it have it all fall apart the bankruptcies that are
[02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:54.640]  going on obama's smart enough to know that the higher income brackets pay most of the income tax
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:37:00.640]  the rich aren't paying their fair share is a slogan it's meant to whip up if the economic
[02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:05.200]  distance rich are paying but they're the new vorice the mega rich are offshore and it's the
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:11.760]  warren buffett's lobbying to raise middle class taxes i'm pointing out how these themes are used
[02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:19.040]  sure but the democrats have gotten out of the university some of the best political science
[02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:26.880]  demographics democrats are marketing of first of all framing psychologically the republicans so
[02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:31.680]  that romney's immediately seen as a rich guy out of touch bang oh yeah they admit they're
[02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:36.960]  anthropologist psychologist running a job exactly but then romney's bad too it's like
[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:42.640]  they've got it fixed at every level but see the point is the rub the democrats are playing
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:49.120]  a game of hardball politics with sophisticated computer 21st century science the republicans
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:54.480]  don't even understand nor do the people you're right they admit with facebook and google helping
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:38:01.280]  them they are literally databaseing and using wargame computers on record to to just scientifically
[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:06.560]  manipulate people and it's incredible how do you counter something like that well first of all
[02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:12.960]  you're doing what i'm trying to do is expose it get the word out let people see it you know the
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:19.040]  nsa is collecting this data for a reason and it's collecting the data in order to be able to map
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:25.680]  model control that's right nation you know they want to have algorithms at the nsa that predict
[02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:30.880]  your behavior before you know what you're going to do they already have it they have it and they
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:37.040]  and targeting and manipulating that behavior with behaviorally crafted messages getting you to
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:42.080]  respond in certain ways you don't even realize the failsafe is if you're aware of the magic trick
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:47.840]  it's no longer magic so if people will just admit they're being conned this can all stop the whole
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:52.960]  point of a magic trick is once you know how it's done it's no longer powerful that's where a mystery
[02:38:52.960 --> 02:39:00.160]  is no longer intriguing once it's solved we have to expose this and and it has to be put a stop to
[02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:07.280]  because even the left should appoint at some point realize that this data is going to be used you know
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:13.680]  against everybody the the first thing a regime comes into power from the left the socialists
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:19.280]  and communists do is destroy the press that's help them get in there so anyone who thinks that
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:26.080]  helping the obama agenda or playing along with it is going to reward you you're just being a you
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:33.920]  know exactly you're being a useful fool they want you poor so they can run your life in closing
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:40.240]  i've seen emails and comments saying i'm lying about uh the washington post you name it saying us
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:45.120]  quietly repels propaganda ban spreads government made news to americans we all know that's been
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:53.200]  going on uh forever but but but the point is this is now globalist new world order running our cia
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:57.520]  how do we counter that the only news you're going to get is the officially approved news i mean
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:02.800]  that's where it's headed with a press that's dummy down and it's just reproducing the government's
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:06.720]  press releases as if they were truth now the government's going to go in the business of
[02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:13.040]  having its own news agencies for the american public like the voice of america and other
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:20.880]  propaganda broadcast we've only used for foreigners it's a complete control of the media so that anyone
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:27.280]  like you alex or like me that wants to expose or oppose this are going to be you know have media
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:34.960]  matters george soros come to to call us names marginalize us uh if we ever get on fox or any of
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:42.000]  the media uh make sure that fox is bombarded by media matters the advertisers are bombarded
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:50.720]  look these people are uh every bit as much foshas on the left you know national socialists no no
[02:40:50.720 --> 02:40:55.840]  they're they're authoritarian gangsters and and and with republicans it's corrupt interests
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:41:01.280]  we're in trouble the problem is it's true the obama noids are a cancer they're going for it all
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:07.040]  right now will they win uh they've got a good chance of winning and uh the problem too is that
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:12.320]  the uh if the republican party stays a centrist party it's going to be very hard to distinguish
[02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:17.360]  republicans from democrats and notice the democrats all day tell republicans how to win
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:22.640]  oh we're your friends be moderate agree with us and you'll win knowing full well that's how
[02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:28.400]  they're going to all lose it's up to the constitutionalists the people of the tea party
[02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:34.800]  you know you're going to have look the cities versus the rest of the country take the cities out
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:40.320]  of america you've got a very different america the cities are where the power base is of the
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:47.280]  left and it's minority ridden hispanics increasingly going to the cities poverty no jobs
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:55.040]  broken families uh drugs crime this is it and if they can they'll try to disarm the population
[02:41:55.040 --> 02:42:01.040]  in the process of saying it's going to make people safer and that's agenda 21 forcing us into the
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:06.400]  city grids where they can actually worry the taxes to bankrupt everybody and make us dependent
[02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:12.880]  this is slavery these people are technocratic slave masters dr jerome coursey the books now
[02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:16.880]  available everywhere we're going to get you back on for a full hour in the next few weeks just tell
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:21.040]  us the time thank you so much uh thanks very much Alex great pleasure to be back with you
[02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:25.120]  you bet thank you yeah now this is a total plan ladies and gentlemen and it's disgusting i'm
[02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:29.200]  going to get to your calls but i have a guest we're going to get on the skype right now he's
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:34.240]  got a very interesting idea that i think is going to be newsmaking uh to point some things out to
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:42.320]  some people so we're going to be talking about that uh with uh the special guest here in just a
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:50.000]  moment uh first off though ladies and gentlemen i tell you what i believe is the truth and i have
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:58.320]  studied anthropology sociology psychology uh war manuals you name it and i and i've looked at it
[02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:03.760]  historically the truth is just the way to go so i don't have to use any tricks there's no deception
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:08.160]  i don't sit here and think about what i'm going to say i'd be better if i did sometimes but you
[02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:16.400]  know what i mean this is really historical analysis of reality versus the fraud or packaging versus
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:24.320]  the contents or form over actual contents and the globalists are not the people they tell you
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:28.320]  they are and they've got the republican leadership that's why the republican leadership's going after
[02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:34.880]  the real tea party in rand paul and ted cruse and that's why you've got uh on fox news every day carl
[02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:39.920]  rove saying oh the tea party we've got it you know they're going to make us lose we've got to move
[02:43:39.920 --> 02:43:45.280]  towards the democrats 2014 is everything ladies and gentlemen and you know i don't believe in the
[02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:49.920]  whole left right deal i know they own run both parties but they're making their move for a full
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:57.120]  one party conversion and leftist have all shown themselves people have had his guest for a decade
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:44:04.080]  or more do you now hear with an msnbc line of all gun ownership is racist all sovereignty is racist
[02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:10.720]  all industry not only the state is racist they're really making their move and branding it with
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:18.960]  john mccain saying we've got a ban federally concealed carry or it's racist give me your gun
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:24.960]  or you're a racist and you're like that doesn't make sense the clan was the first gun laws the
[02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:29.120]  the black cities are run by globalists and they don't want blacks being armed that's why their
[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:33.520]  crime rates are so high the main factor here's the numbers they don't they just go shut up racist
[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:38.160]  you're like i'm not a racist they've won they make you start defending yourself
[02:44:38.160 --> 02:44:47.680]  the soviets controlled really the biggest region in the world from the east coast of russia and
[02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:52.080]  all the satellites over to poland in europe i mean you're talking about what is that five
[02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:59.680]  thousand miles six thousand miles across i mean that's incredibly diverse and they had
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:07.600]  political correctness they had hate crimes and if you were a member of the local soviet uh
[02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:15.920]  the kamazars political police that's who they were and you killed somebody you didn't get in
[02:45:15.920 --> 02:45:22.080]  trouble but if you shot your mouth off against the government they would announce if this person's
[02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:27.200]  been arrested because they were talking bad about our asian members of the soviet union and it
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:32.000]  wouldn't even be true but well good he's been sent to the gulag he's right i mean that's when you
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:37.680]  hear hate crime thought crime all this speech crime stuff that's what's stalling and before him linen
[02:45:37.680 --> 02:45:46.960]  did when you when you hear political correctness that is a soviet term i mean when when you know
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:53.680]  history you're like oh my goodness gracious i mean we know what this is there isn't any bones
[02:45:53.680 --> 02:46:01.520]  about it and the general public has no idea what the three branches of government are no idea much
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:07.600]  less what authoritarianism is and it always looks the same the black uniforms the mask the checkpoints
[02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:12.560]  the knock of the door the political police all of this i mean this and they're just slowly
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:16.640]  trying to get our police and military to go along with it and the good news is most of them are
[02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:22.480]  rebelling against it i think they've miscalculated and things aren't going well for them the problem
[02:46:22.480 --> 02:46:26.960]  is they just get rid of the good cops in military and find people that will do it generally though
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:31.920]  those aren't even evil people they think they're the boss everybody else is a slave and they're
[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:41.200]  kind of a minder police and military have got to get really aware situationally to the fact of
[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:45.840]  i'm not lying to him okay i mean you need to look into this stuff and find out i'm telling you the
[02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:50.960]  truth because when you find out i'm telling you the truth you'll figure out we better do something
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:56.160]  all right i want to go to one of our sponsors but that's not why he's on the show with us he
[02:46:56.160 --> 02:47:02.560]  had a great idea chad cooper boy scout police officer air force intelligence specialist masters
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:07.600]  and strategic intelligence defense contractor ceo of infidel body armor he'd be a great guy to have
[02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:12.720]  on just as a guest sometime from all of his life experience and he saw an article out of the new
[02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:19.120]  american author brad thor offers to buy zimmerman new gun and ammo after the justice department is
[02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:24.880]  blocking the release of evidence from zimmerman murder trial as part of the continued cover-up
[02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:31.760]  and so now chad cooper of infidel body armor dot com he wants to make an announcement to
[02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:37.360]  george zimmerman and of course this is a political statement too about something he wants to offer
[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:42.160]  george zimmerman so chad thank you for coming on the broadcast with us thanks for having me alex i
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:47.120]  appreciate it you bet so what do you want to say to george zimmerman well i'd like to uh
[02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:54.960]  uh offer him and his extended family uh free body armor i understand that uh there's been thousands
[02:47:54.960 --> 02:48:01.040]  of death threats made against him and frankly that's just not right in america people should
[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:08.240]  be able to be free especially after after a jury announces that he's innocent um with all the
[02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:14.960]  death threats against him i just like to uh offer him and his family body armor without any charge
[02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:19.920]  well i think that they should take advantage of that and so we'll we'll we'll try to get them a
[02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:24.240]  message uh or i guess you could probably just ship it right to his home address even though he's not
[02:48:24.240 --> 02:48:29.200]  there now it'll get to him so why don't we just uh why don't we why don't you just ship him four or
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:34.640]  five of your great uh body armor packages right to his front door i think i think they'll get there
[02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:42.080]  that way we'll do that absolutely and and again just the idea of what happens if he does get killed
[02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:47.600]  there's all these calls to killing and and i wonder i wonder what the obama noids are going to do then
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:55.040]  if they actually kill this guy that's been found not guilty well i i i i hope that doesn't happen
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:49:00.640]  but if it does i i imagine it would just be swapped under the rug and uh you know we can blame it all
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:06.400]  day long well you know the people are angry and they need to have their way you know and uh i imagine
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:10.800]  something some kind of political spin would be made on something like that have you heard about
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:16.080]  the black george zimmerman who three years ago killed a white 17 year old who was breaking into
[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:20.960]  cars with two others and rushed him and a white grand jury no billed the indictment that the
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:25.840]  prosecutor uh one we've got that article up on info wars dot com in fact if that guy is going to
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:28.880]  get a hold of him we're trying to get a hold of him i want to get the gentleman on i mean i wonder
[02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:36.000]  why the white grand jury no billed him i thought they're all racist that's a good question uh i was
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:42.160]  just reading that article myself and uh it doesn't surprise me you know uh our media wants to paint
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:49.120]  everybody as racist uh and uh unless it's the other way around and uh we've known that for years
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:54.320]  and that's just the way it is in america unfortunately right now well i think the system's bitten off
[02:49:54.320 --> 02:50:00.160]  more than it can chew uh if just good americans of all racist collars creeds religions stand up and
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:06.720]  say no what do you think well it doesn't really in my opinion it doesn't have anything to do with
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:10.560]  what he did that night my stance is that it doesn't have anything to do with what he did that night
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:16.080]  it doesn't have anything to do with racism what it has to do with is this mob mentality that
[02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:23.040]  is growing in america that says hey if i don't like the way this uh jury voted then i'm gonna take
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:28.160]  the law into my own hands i'm gonna go and uh have this mob mentality where i can lynch somebody
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:32.480]  if i'm unhappy well that's it it's an attack on the jury it's an attack on the constitution
[02:50:32.480 --> 02:50:37.680]  it's an attack on being an individual and to be a group thinker and the government's our big mommy
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:42.640]  up there right and and they're actually encouraging this type of thought you know when the president

[02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:14.480]  dot com one of our great sponsors joins us and he's saying hey give george zimmerman
[02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:18.240]  free body armor so he's going to ship it to his house and then it'll obviously get to him but
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:25.440]  imagine having to live in hiding now i personally wouldn't i just start stuning myself with firearms
[02:54:25.440 --> 02:54:30.640]  but you've had people shot and killed in florida who had free george zimmerman stickers on their cars
[02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:38.240]  and it just shows a crazy attitude that that you're going to get ahead that's what ms mbc
[02:54:38.240 --> 02:54:45.280]  basically pushes if you can deal with the racist crackers and the and i listen to ms mbc on xm it's
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:52.160]  like the twilight zone because it's so clear they're trying to invoke division to divert away from the
[02:54:52.160 --> 02:54:56.240]  fact that obama basically works for globalist interests that are destroying this country
[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:02.560]  we're living in a twilight zone movie you seem like a pretty smart guy chad what do you think we
[02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:06.880]  should do to bring this country together and try to bring back what made this nation great instead
[02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:14.320]  of going the direction we're going well i think the uh the key is is we need to start with what you
[02:55:14.320 --> 02:55:20.240]  can do start with your family strengthen your family strengthen your friends strengthen your church
[02:55:20.240 --> 02:55:25.760]  and it can only grow outwards from there start with the circle that you can influence and when
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:30.800]  you are prepared when you are smart when you've learned the constitution then you can help others
[02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:36.320]  to grow and strengthen i think that's what it really needs to go it is as us as individuals we
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:41.840]  need to uh enlighten ourselves and refresh our memories of what we've forgotten over the past
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:48.800]  hundred years absolutely you know if i had to place bets i think there's probably a 20 30
[02:55:48.800 --> 02:55:54.080]  percent chance somebody's gonna try to kill george emerman oh i believe someone probably
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:58.240]  definitely will you know there's a that's a pretty good that's pretty good odds that something like
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:04.880]  that will definitely happen and yeah and then there's a good odds they'll succeed too us well
[02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:09.600]  you know i i've read a couple reports that say he is wearing body armor and uh the couple pictures
[02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:14.560]  i was able to find it looks like what he's wearing is what police officers typically wear and that's
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:20.480]  soft body armor and and that's really only good to stop pistols so if somebody even took a 22
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:25.520]  long rifle out from a distance it's going to go right through that that's right you've got videos
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:29.920]  of torture test and so much more and your body armor has been tested by hb white the premier
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:35.200]  testing authority the national institute of justice and rated at level three and it can stop
[02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:40.960]  hundreds of rounds of even 30 odd six versus the ceramic that can only stop about six or so
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:45.520]  and now obviously this is heavier so you wouldn't see cops walk around the street but if you're
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:50.480]  driving around in a collapsed situation or you're in your house or if you want something to exercise
[02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:56.000]  into get in shape i mean this is the real deal this is the road warrior stuff that's right alex and
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:00.640]  you know the end of the world as we know it has already happened for george emerman uh
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:08.960]  and your skype just cut out the time we got to start over go ahead you're saying it cut out at
[02:57:08.960 --> 02:57:14.480]  the end of the world uh has our as george zermann knows it right at the end of the world as we know
[02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:20.400]  it has already happened for george zermann and i believe it's coming soon to uh a neighborhood near
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:28.080]  you so being prepared is part of it and uh like you said our body armor is a little bit heavier
[02:57:28.080 --> 02:57:34.000]  it's about a pound heavier than the the ceramic and here's the trade-off i've got it for those people
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:41.200]  who are viewing in this is a ceramic plate that was shot six times on the second shot it went
[02:57:41.200 --> 02:57:46.480]  through the there's a hole right here it went through on the second shot the rated for six hits
[02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:52.000]  six hits in six different places now our body armor right here like you said it'll stop hundreds of
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:58.800]  rounds we've tested it 308 sniper rounds hundreds of rounds literally in the same spot and it keeps
[02:57:58.800 --> 02:58:03.920]  your telling bullets and to me that's that's not even a trade-off that's it that's exactly you know
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:07.760]  me saying it's heavy it's only a little bit heavier than the other i mean my point is though
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:14.240]  this is the real deal you've also got backpacks uh so much more an amazing site infidel body armor
