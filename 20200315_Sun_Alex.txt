[00:00.000 --> 00:17.800]  This is an emergency broadcast of We the People.
[00:17.800 --> 00:22.040]  I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you over a landline.
[00:22.040 --> 00:27.480]  Tom Pappert will be guest-housing from the TV studios in Kansas.
[00:27.480 --> 00:29.840]  We are not in Kansas anymore.
[00:29.840 --> 00:32.920]  Constitutional lawyer Norma Pattis has talked to his sources
[00:32.920 --> 00:37.040]  inside the Federalist Society that are very close to the White House.
[00:37.040 --> 00:39.600]  And I've talked to Pentagon sources.
[00:39.600 --> 00:44.520]  President Trump is set to declare a ban on interstate travel,
[00:44.520 --> 00:48.080]  not just aircraft but vehicles and people,
[00:48.080 --> 00:51.440]  traveling across state lines as early as 8 p.m. tonight.
[00:51.440 --> 00:53.080]  He's already made the decision to do it,
[00:53.080 --> 00:55.080]  but there are desperate groups there explaining to him
[00:55.080 --> 01:00.640]  that it will devastate the economy and that it probably won't stop the virus in the end.
[01:00.640 --> 01:04.560]  This thing is clearly an authoritarian tool to bring down the U.S. economy
[01:04.560 --> 01:06.080]  launched by the globalist and Chi-Coms.
[01:06.080 --> 01:07.440]  We know it's man-made.
[01:07.440 --> 01:11.200]  Clearly, all these big globalist institutions have created the precedent
[01:11.200 --> 01:14.040]  and the standard of hysteria and phobia
[01:14.040 --> 01:17.360]  that you've got to totally capitulate and have no basic rights
[01:17.360 --> 01:21.400]  and have surveillance drones screaming at you and controlling your every move.
[01:21.400 --> 01:25.960]  The authoritarian government of China set the standard for this
[01:25.960 --> 01:28.560]  right after they lost a trade war with the United States.
[01:28.560 --> 01:30.920]  This is 21st century war.
[01:30.920 --> 01:34.560]  I've criticized the president for not getting ahead of it, saying it's serious
[01:34.560 --> 01:36.720]  because they would then demonize him.
[01:36.720 --> 01:40.920]  Early on, the conservatives convinced him to not do, listen to us.
[01:40.920 --> 01:45.720]  Later, he did listen to us, but now I'm concerned he's going to go too far.
[01:45.720 --> 01:49.160]  This is absolutely documented.
[01:49.160 --> 01:50.760]  This is going on.
[01:50.760 --> 01:53.160]  I was already going to have the headline tonight.
[01:53.160 --> 01:59.640]  Trump's set to declare martial law over Corona coronavirus hysteria.
[01:59.640 --> 02:03.640]  And then that was for my Pentagon source and others did.
[02:03.640 --> 02:06.600]  Norm Patis, a very respected national criminal lawyer,
[02:06.600 --> 02:09.320]  you know, right up there, works with Alan Dershowitz, you name it,
[02:09.320 --> 02:12.040]  has high level sources in the Federalist Society
[02:12.040 --> 02:17.400]  that are meeting with Trump right now at the White House,
[02:17.400 --> 02:19.040]  trying to convince him not to do this.
[02:19.040 --> 02:22.200]  But regardless, this is seismic.
[02:22.200 --> 02:25.640]  Italy has declared martial law three weeks ago.
[02:25.640 --> 02:29.880]  France and Spain declared martial law today.
[02:29.880 --> 02:34.640]  President Trump is only trying to line up with other world leaders
[02:34.640 --> 02:37.320]  so that it can't be said that he didn't respond properly.
[02:37.320 --> 02:40.160]  That's the trap the Democrats put him in the deep state.
[02:40.160 --> 02:44.480]  Then when he does that, like block the Chinese flights a month ago,
[02:44.480 --> 02:47.280]  they say he's being racist and hateful.
[02:47.280 --> 02:50.120]  When he blocks the Europe flights, they're saying he's hateful and evil.
[02:50.120 --> 02:54.400]  They're not letting people fly around inside most areas of Europe now.
[02:54.400 --> 02:56.800]  Remember, they praised China shooting people at checkpoints
[02:56.800 --> 02:58.680]  and welding people into their homes.
[02:58.680 --> 03:00.280]  Remember that.
[03:00.280 --> 03:01.440]  That's what the UN praised.
[03:01.440 --> 03:02.920]  That's what our media praised.
[03:02.920 --> 03:06.080]  But when President Trump simply said we might have to control some flights
[03:06.080 --> 03:07.560]  into the US, he's a horrible person.
[03:07.560 --> 03:09.520]  So I understand the trap he's in.
[03:09.520 --> 03:12.400]  But to navigate this and to balance this,
[03:12.400 --> 03:14.800]  we're going to break it down with Norm Patis with the exclusive.
[03:14.800 --> 03:15.960]  And I already knew this was going on.
[03:15.960 --> 03:18.320]  He was set to announce it. I thought in about a week.
[03:18.320 --> 03:22.480]  I was going to come on tonight and already talk about this even though I'm on a short vacation.
[03:22.480 --> 03:23.600]  I'm not on vacation now.
[03:23.600 --> 03:25.640]  I'll be back on full time here because this is so serious.
[03:25.640 --> 03:27.360]  So we're going to go to break her in a moment.
[03:27.360 --> 03:31.000]  And Norm Patis, constitutional and criminal lawyer is going to be on
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.240]  and give us this exclusive until you're getting this first.
[03:33.240 --> 03:38.640]  There's a live feed at newswars.com with the headline that I suggest you share.
[03:38.640 --> 03:41.640]  Again, info wars is censored on Twitter and Facebook and everywhere else,
[03:41.640 --> 03:44.360]  but not news wars as bad.
[03:44.360 --> 03:48.760]  So share that link at newswars.com.
[03:48.760 --> 03:54.160]  Global exclusive Trump to announce interstate travel ban as early as tonight.
[03:54.160 --> 03:57.960]  Experts inside federal government have confirmed in force exclusively
[03:57.960 --> 04:01.360]  that Trump has already decided to declare martial law.
[04:01.360 --> 04:03.000]  Tune in now.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.720]  Alex Jones exclusively breaks down President Trump's decision to
[04:06.720 --> 04:09.800]  implement an interstate travel ban as early as this evening,
[04:09.800 --> 04:12.680]  according to experts inside the Pentagon and the White House
[04:12.680 --> 04:15.640]  in the latest escalation against the coronavirus outbreak.
[04:15.640 --> 04:19.080]  Meanwhile, guest host Tom Pepper covers the latest travel ban measures
[04:19.080 --> 04:22.800]  from China to Europe to Israel, in addition to local governments,
[04:22.800 --> 04:26.880]  closing schools, sports events, churches and large public gatherings
[04:26.880 --> 04:29.160]  until the outbreak is under control.
[04:29.160 --> 04:33.400]  This isn't a drill concerning martial law.
[04:33.400 --> 04:37.080]  This is martial law, everything we've ever warned you of.
[04:37.080 --> 04:40.360]  And specifically, Millie Weaver sent me a clip from her and I on the show
[04:40.360 --> 04:43.040]  two years ago saying her Pentagon sources,
[04:43.040 --> 04:45.960]  and she has some incredible sources, folks, people really like Millie.
[04:45.960 --> 04:47.360]  She's got sources as good as ours.
[04:47.360 --> 04:50.080]  I mean, I'm not going to get into them, but I'm pretty amazing.
[04:50.080 --> 04:54.040]  They told her they're going to launch a bio attack if everything else fails on Trump.
[04:54.040 --> 04:56.080]  I've even forgotten to play that clip.
[04:56.080 --> 05:00.680]  She's got to come on the show tomorrow, early on the show, and play that clip.
[05:00.680 --> 05:03.720]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.
[05:03.720 --> 05:06.080]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on,

[06:14.520 --> 06:18.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a global emergency exclusive.
[06:18.800 --> 06:22.800]  This is a global emergency exclusive.
[06:22.800 --> 06:27.360]  I am Alex Jones, your host, the article and the live feed that you need to share
[06:27.360 --> 06:30.360]  is posted to newswars.com.
[06:30.360 --> 06:33.960]  Newswars.com, global exclusive.
[06:33.960 --> 06:37.480]  Trump to announce interstate travel ban as early as tonight.
[06:37.480 --> 06:41.600]  Experts inside federal government have confirmed to InfoWars exclusively
[06:41.600 --> 06:46.880]  that Trump has already decided to declare the equivalent of martial law.
[06:46.880 --> 06:51.080]  Well, I started hearing this about a week ago
[06:51.080 --> 06:53.800]  when I talked to a source that's in central command,
[06:53.800 --> 06:56.200]  that's obviously heavily involved in all this.
[06:56.200 --> 07:02.280]  And as Europe sets the precedent in Italy and now in Spain and now in France today
[07:02.280 --> 07:06.480]  of declaring martial law and banning interstate travel basically,
[07:06.480 --> 07:10.400]  that then sets the bar to where if Trump doesn't do it,
[07:10.400 --> 07:12.680]  then the media will say when there's death, it's his fault.
[07:12.680 --> 07:18.280]  So that's how this trap of the phobia and the panic over this virus that's not been proven,
[07:18.280 --> 07:21.480]  you know, to be that deadly, for sure it's killing some people.
[07:21.480 --> 07:22.920]  Looks like it's designed for old folks.
[07:22.920 --> 07:24.120]  Yes, it's man-made.
[07:24.120 --> 07:26.600]  But this thing is how we're going into global government.
[07:26.600 --> 07:31.560]  We had the UN testing disease X one year ago.
[07:31.560 --> 07:34.120]  And it's test marketing and saying it's going to come.
[07:34.120 --> 07:35.920]  It's going to bring in world government.
[07:35.920 --> 07:38.080]  It's going to smash these nationalists that, you know,
[07:38.080 --> 07:40.000]  don't want to be hooked into a global government.
[07:40.000 --> 07:43.200]  The UN said disease X will be here within a year or two.
[07:43.200 --> 07:48.560]  Then Bill Gates did a tabletop exercise four months ago of 60 something million dead.
[07:48.560 --> 07:53.280]  And then now, of course, he's got a vaccine patented and it's all rolling out with the propaganda.
[07:53.280 --> 07:56.920]  This is an unbelievable time to be alive.
[07:56.920 --> 07:59.280]  And Tom Papert was going to be hosting the show today.
[07:59.280 --> 08:00.160]  He will be here.
[08:00.160 --> 08:05.240]  I take a very powerful interview with the Motor City Madman on the virus yesterday.
[08:05.240 --> 08:07.560]  That'll be airing in part of the next hour.
[08:07.560 --> 08:11.000]  That's what Ted News United, a whole show yesterday for today.
[08:11.000 --> 08:14.680]  But we're preempting that now much of it because this is live.
[08:14.680 --> 08:15.440]  This is happening.
[08:15.440 --> 08:18.760]  So Tom will be taking over here towards the middle of the next segment.
[08:18.760 --> 08:22.760]  He'll be doing another segment so that Norm Patis, a constitutional lawyer, has plenty of time to talk.
[08:22.760 --> 08:24.560]  He has sources in the federal society.
[08:24.560 --> 08:26.120]  He's a renowned national lawyer.
[08:26.120 --> 08:30.720]  And when he texted me about an hour ago with exactly what SMPCOM told me,
[08:30.720 --> 08:34.560]  they were told Trump would announce in a week that we knew this was serious.
[08:34.560 --> 08:36.760]  So Norm Patis, thank you for being here.
[08:36.760 --> 08:42.120]  Please explain to people what a ban on interstate travel is on precedent in America's history,
[08:42.120 --> 08:45.200]  even during the swine flu that killed 50 million people we didn't do.
[08:45.200 --> 08:51.600]  Explain what that is first and then tell people what your sources, reportedly in ongoing meetings at the White House,
[08:51.600 --> 08:55.600]  begging the president to rethink this because it will definitely set a deadly precedent
[08:55.600 --> 08:58.360]  and devastate the economy and may not save lives.
[08:58.360 --> 08:59.720]  Norm Patis.
[08:59.720 --> 09:02.160]  Well, you know, we've never had an interstate travel ban.
[09:02.160 --> 09:04.560]  So I don't really know what that would mean.
[09:04.560 --> 09:08.480]  But I am told that there's an ongoing debate in the White House as we speak
[09:08.480 --> 09:15.560]  with members of the legal counsel's office urging the president not to attempt to impose a travel ban.
[09:15.560 --> 09:21.280]  The word is that he's intent on doing so tonight, although I've checked with several journalists I know
[09:21.280 --> 09:26.800]  and nobody seems to be having, nobody's been alerted yet of a press conference.
[09:26.800 --> 09:29.320]  That's not to say that one couldn't be held abruptly.
[09:29.320 --> 09:35.760]  And knowing the president's desire to control the airways and the extent to which the coronavirus has basically silenced him,
[09:35.760 --> 09:40.720]  it wouldn't surprise me that he would use the time period allotted to the Biden standards debate
[09:40.720 --> 09:44.320]  to grant the discussion and to once again own the airwaves.
[09:44.320 --> 09:47.080]  But what might a travel ban look like?
[09:47.080 --> 09:54.960]  You may say that any travel on interstate travel, that is, travel of citizens or people between the states is prohibited.
[09:54.960 --> 09:59.960]  That would be almost impossible to impose, especially in regions of the country like New England,
[09:59.960 --> 10:02.000]  where states are very close to one another.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.280]  I live 75 miles out of New York City.
[10:04.280 --> 10:05.640]  Some of my neighbors work there.
[10:05.640 --> 10:12.880]  It's easy for me to be back in and out of the city or even out of New Jersey or Massachusetts or Rhode Island.
[10:12.880 --> 10:17.080]  I don't know how such an imposition could be imposed.
[10:17.080 --> 10:20.240]  We don't have tolls or order of checkpoints.
[10:20.240 --> 10:24.080]  So it's really hard to know what that would mean as a matter of law.
[10:24.080 --> 10:28.920]  When I heard you say in the run-up to this, Alex, this was akin to martial law,
[10:28.920 --> 10:30.800]  at first I thought that was an overstatement.
[10:30.800 --> 10:36.080]  But as I thought about what you were saying, I guess it would take something like martial law to make that work.
[10:36.080 --> 10:40.280]  Because if there are multiple points of ingress and egress between states,
[10:40.280 --> 10:43.080]  who's going to determine whether somebody is crossed unlawfully?
[10:43.080 --> 10:47.920]  You have to monitor that to occur and who can do that better than the military or police.
[10:47.920 --> 10:49.440]  So it would be chilling.
[10:49.440 --> 10:56.480]  We are, in my office, as we speak, preparing a challenge to this order in the event that it occurs.
[10:56.480 --> 11:02.560]  If you look at the right to travel, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that it is fundamental,
[11:02.560 --> 11:07.360]  but it has never anchored that right in a particular clause of the Constitution.
[11:07.360 --> 11:12.000]  The 14th Amendment, for example, has a clause that says the citizens of the various states
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.920]  enjoy the privileges and immunities of other states.
[11:14.920 --> 11:20.560]  That's been taken to mean that when I travel to Texas, I enjoy the rights of a Texas citizen,
[11:20.560 --> 11:22.600]  even though I'm not a Texan.
[11:22.600 --> 11:27.400]  From time to time, the states have tried to impose durational requirements on a person
[11:27.400 --> 11:31.520]  before that person can enjoy the benefits of social welfare, let's say.
[11:31.520 --> 11:36.320]  So a Californian couldn't move to Texas and claim welfare straight away.
[11:36.320 --> 11:41.520]  Those issues have been defeated as a violation of the Privilege and Immunities Clause.
[11:41.520 --> 11:48.200]  In 1999, a case called SCIEN, S-A-E-N-Z versus RO,
[11:48.200 --> 11:54.600]  struck down an imposition on a right to travel without necessarily,
[11:54.600 --> 11:57.680]  and explicitly saying, for purposes of this case,
[11:57.680 --> 12:02.080]  we need not identify the source of the right to travel in the text of the Constitution.
[12:02.080 --> 12:04.160]  And Norm? Norm? Norm? Yes.
[12:04.160 --> 12:04.960]  You're doing a great job.
[12:04.960 --> 12:08.080]  I want you in the next segment to walk through the law and the history of this,
[12:08.080 --> 12:12.120]  but using this hysteria, clearly this global force that's been hyping this
[12:12.120 --> 12:16.800]  and the media hyping it, and big tech in the authoritarian states hyping it,
[12:16.800 --> 12:22.000]  they're pushing for an authoritarian benchmark now of basically worldwide tyranny
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.600]  that we've never before seen in communist China as the model, as you and others have been warning.
[12:26.600 --> 12:31.080]  But pulling back from this, I want you to have the floor here first and explain to people.
[12:31.080 --> 12:35.840]  You've talked to folks that are directly in contact with those in the White House Legal Council
[12:35.840 --> 12:39.200]  that are involved in the meetings through the Federalist Society.
[12:39.200 --> 12:41.760]  This is an exclusive that Norm Patis is giving you.
[12:41.760 --> 12:47.120]  The press does not know this. This is not a joke. This is going on right now.
[12:47.120 --> 12:50.960]  So please, as we go to break here, recap exactly whose meeting,
[12:50.960 --> 12:53.280]  what's going on and what you were told.
[12:53.280 --> 12:57.520]  What I'm told is that in the White House right now,
[12:57.520 --> 13:02.960]  President Trump has an intention, a desire, a plan to announce as early as tonight
[13:02.960 --> 13:09.680]  a 30-day ban on interstate travel that members of his legal counsel's office
[13:09.680 --> 13:15.600]  are attempting to persuade the president that such an order is unlawful and would be a mistake.
[13:15.600 --> 13:20.480]  Whether they succeed or not is an open question. That's all I know at this point.
[13:20.480 --> 13:24.560]  But it comes from a source that is credible enough for me to have people working throughout the night
[13:24.560 --> 13:27.840]  to prepare a legal challenge on this. The minute he makes the announcement,
[13:27.840 --> 13:30.080]  it's our intention to be in court.
[13:30.080 --> 13:33.280]  And let me just add that again, I have Pentagon sources that have been telling me
[13:33.280 --> 13:36.880]  that they've been ready for this. We know it's already happened in Europe.
[13:36.880 --> 13:39.680]  This is simply amazing. We're going to break in one moment.
[13:39.680 --> 13:43.040]  But I want to see, Tom Pappert, what's your first approximation of this?
[13:43.040 --> 13:44.800]  This isn't a drill. This is really happening.
[13:45.920 --> 13:48.080]  Well, Alex, I'd actually heard the same as you.
[13:48.080 --> 13:52.960]  My two of my sources, one's Radio Guy, one lives and works in DC,
[13:52.960 --> 13:57.040]  have heard that this is coming as soon as next week and that it would coincide
[13:57.040 --> 14:00.400]  with a blanket quarantine, meaning nobody's allowed to go to work.
[14:00.400 --> 14:04.240]  Nobody's allowed to do anything except go to the store or go to the pharmacy.
[14:04.240 --> 14:08.960]  So I was like you keeping the powder dry, waiting to see if this did come about next week.
[14:08.960 --> 14:12.720]  The fact that this exact plan that I again, just like you,
[14:12.720 --> 14:16.080]  heard may come as soon as tonight is shocking.
[14:16.080 --> 14:22.800]  And I wonder exactly how long would this go into place before a potential injunction
[14:22.800 --> 14:27.840]  or a potential court could stop it if Norm Pappert is able to get that pushed forward?
[14:27.840 --> 14:31.120]  Again, should it come tonight? I don't know. What would the turnaround be on that, Norm?
[14:32.080 --> 14:36.000]  We could be in the court. I mean, our goal, you can file 24 hours a day.
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.800]  So we would e-file sometime in the course of the night and ask for an emergency hearing
[14:40.800 --> 14:45.600]  and an injunction and declaratory relief from any judge we could get in front of tomorrow.
[14:46.160 --> 14:49.360]  I want to make a point as we go to break. I want to make a point.
[14:49.360 --> 14:54.240]  The same Democrats that said we couldn't ever close the border or even check people for bubonic
[14:54.240 --> 15:00.080]  plague and drug resistant TB that kills tens of thousands a year. And all these deadly strains
[15:00.080 --> 15:04.560]  are the ones saying the president hasn't done enough yet, basically pushing him into this position.
[15:04.560 --> 15:09.040]  So it's outrageous that we can't have external borders, but now we're not going to be able
[15:09.040 --> 15:14.800]  to leave our houses, folks. And the left thinks it's wonderful and wants to make us all telecommute.
[15:14.800 --> 15:18.160]  This is all about turning the whole world into a prison planet.
[15:18.160 --> 15:23.920]  Where have I heard of that? Prisonplanet.com and my film in-game blueprint for global and
[15:23.920 --> 15:28.320]  slave. But we're going to go to break. Tom Pappert's here. We have Norm Pattis here.
[15:28.320 --> 15:31.280]  Pattis is such an expert on this that this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to come in
[15:31.280 --> 15:36.320]  next segment and make my final statement on this. And then I'm going to hand it over to Tom Pappert
[15:36.320 --> 15:43.840]  and I'm going to hand it over to Norm for the rest of the hour. And then next hour we've got
[15:43.840 --> 15:48.240]  important videos and things about the martial law taking place under parts of the world.
[15:48.240 --> 15:55.360]  infowars.com, newswars.com. We have the live feed and the article exclusive on this at newswars.com.
[15:55.360 --> 15:57.360]  Told everybody to tune in now. This is a global exclusive.
[15:59.520 --> 16:05.920]  Hey, Steve. How you doing? Hey, Alex. Oh my God. Long time listener, first time caller.
[16:05.920 --> 16:10.960]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital. I went in the VA hospital out here in Boise.
[16:10.960 --> 16:15.600]  And I was in there until June. And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living
[16:15.600 --> 16:21.040]  defense. Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem and I stumbled with
[16:21.040 --> 16:25.840]  it for about five or six years. And the doctors, they tried every test. Nobody could figure out
[16:25.840 --> 16:29.920]  what it is. And then every day, when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials,
[16:29.920 --> 16:33.040]  I said, you know what? I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense. Now,
[16:33.040 --> 16:36.480]  I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional stuff because they don't want you to have it. But I
[16:36.480 --> 16:41.680]  ordered it, had it shipped to me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it, man.
[16:41.680 --> 16:46.640]  That stuff changed my life. It saved my life. If there's any veteran out there, I don't give you
[16:46.640 --> 16:52.480]  travel though. Anybody's traveled overseas. You absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles
[16:52.480 --> 16:57.600]  of that living defense. It's true, folks. We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality.
[16:57.600 --> 17:05.120]  And living defense is over the top good. I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[17:05.120 --> 17:10.160]  Now, could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong? Yeah. Just like I'm
[17:10.160 --> 17:14.160]  telling people, hey, I'm a man. I love women. You ought to go out and get a girlfriend. You may
[17:14.160 --> 17:18.880]  have problems with her. You may get a divorce. You may, whatever. The point is, I'm just steering
[17:18.880 --> 17:24.160]  you in the direction I went that was successful when I left. Well, when it comes to supplements
[17:24.160 --> 17:29.680]  and when it comes to storable foods, we've got the best out there because I want you to get a great

[17:48.000 --> 17:51.920]  no more food sales we've sold out, just like we've done with supplements and other things.

[17:58.320 --> 18:04.880]  independent. If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate info wars, it's
[18:04.880 --> 18:12.880]  because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up. That's why it's critical
[18:12.880 --> 18:18.720]  for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us
[18:18.720 --> 18:23.840]  and they persecute us and they lie about us. That's what we should expect because we are
[18:23.840 --> 18:29.040]  hurting these scumbags. The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side
[18:29.040 --> 18:34.800]  and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress
[18:34.800 --> 18:40.800]  and dominate and destroy the innocent. It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the
[18:40.800 --> 18:48.720]  wolves, but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants. They fear the fact that
[18:48.720 --> 18:55.760]  we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive. They fear the fact that we love God and
[18:55.760 --> 19:05.280]  that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge. Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[19:06.080 --> 19:09.760]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[19:10.320 --> 19:14.240]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[19:14.240 --> 19:19.840]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against
[19:19.840 --> 19:25.920]  the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air. Powerful, quiet and effective, the breeze uses

[19:58.240 --> 20:09.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:09.200 --> 20:23.680]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[20:28.960 --> 20:33.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a global worldwide exclusive. It is with heavy heart
[20:33.920 --> 20:38.800]  that tell you that President Trump has already told advisors he has set to declare
[20:38.800 --> 20:43.360]  what is martial law, the most basic nature of martial law, the suspension of basic rights,
[20:43.360 --> 20:47.840]  is the right to travel. Global exclusive, Trump to announce interstate travel ban is early.
[20:49.040 --> 20:54.320]  As tonight experts inside the federal government have confirmed to M4s exclusively, and we've
[20:54.320 --> 20:59.520]  named names here for you of the group that is meeting with Trump right now, that Trump has
[20:59.520 --> 21:05.600]  already decided to declare martial law. The exclusive live feed is at newswars.com. So if
[21:05.600 --> 21:09.200]  you're listening on a local radio station, tell folks to tune in now to that local station.
[21:09.200 --> 21:13.600]  If you're listening on the internet or you have a family in another city that doesn't have a local
[21:13.600 --> 21:19.680]  TV station or radio station, call them and tell them go to newswars.com or send them
[21:19.680 --> 21:25.920]  that top story at newswars.com now. That's how we cause a chain reaction on this and get a large
[21:25.920 --> 21:30.880]  debate up front with the top constitutional lawyer who broke you this exclusive information. He'll
[21:30.880 --> 21:36.000]  be breaking down next segment. Why it's so concerning, what it's going to really do,
[21:36.880 --> 21:41.120]  how communist China set the precedent for this, and why are we following this un-American precedent
[21:41.920 --> 21:47.440]  for a virus that does not look like it's even as deadly as something like bubonic plague that we
[21:47.440 --> 21:52.880]  were supposed to let in from Mexico and allow to spread, including drug resistant TB. So remember,
[21:54.240 --> 21:59.600]  the very same globalist deep staters that said no borders, no walls, no Europe, no USA at all,
[21:59.600 --> 22:04.240]  that tell people to come from all over the world to get free stuff. The same ones that rammed down
[22:04.240 --> 22:09.600]  the Guatemalan borders and tore down their fences and attacked their military and the Mexican troops
[22:09.600 --> 22:15.360]  and overwhelmed our border. And the same ones that have invaded by the coast with George Soros
[22:15.360 --> 22:19.760]  and the UN funding it, with millions of military aged men bringing in the most deadly diseases
[22:20.320 --> 22:26.320]  and the most deadly culture of sex slavery, you name it, all of that was good, all of that was
[22:26.320 --> 22:35.040]  okay. But now a virus that hasn't even killed as many people worldwide as the flu kills here every
[22:35.040 --> 22:41.040]  year, we're told to capitulate and give up our way of life and stick our head in the sand and make
[22:41.040 --> 22:48.080]  the new American symbol on ostrich. So this has all been a setup. I wish Limbaugh and others were
[22:48.080 --> 22:52.160]  right that hey, just ignore it. It's not gonna be a problem. It didn't matter. The hype and the
[22:52.160 --> 22:56.960]  programming was set to blame Trump if he didn't take action. Then once he does take action,
[22:57.520 --> 23:01.600]  they will always be able to ratchet it up because if he doesn't do exactly what the authoritarian
[23:01.600 --> 23:07.120]  EU does, if he doesn't do exactly what the authoritarian communist Chinese do and others,
[23:08.480 --> 23:12.720]  they've been set the precedent that oh, he's a bad guy and the media is already blaming him. So
[23:12.720 --> 23:17.680]  Trump's been putting this trap. But this will devastate the economy. And this will set the
[23:17.680 --> 23:22.080]  precedent to make you commute into work whenever they want. And now new designer viruses will
[23:22.080 --> 23:27.600]  be like the weather report where you've just got to hunker down in your house and the drones will
[23:27.600 --> 23:34.720]  deliver you from Amazon your food. You can see it all pre-programmed the entire thing. So it's a
[23:34.720 --> 23:40.400]  global exclusive. I want norm patis because so many people constitutional lawyer at the end of
[23:40.400 --> 23:45.920]  this segment to just recap the group meeting with Trump, what Trump's decided, what this means,
[23:45.920 --> 23:53.120]  and come back with Tom Pappert hosting from his TV studios in which to talk hands us to break down
[23:53.120 --> 23:57.440]  the rest of this. And then we've got Ted Nugent coming on to respond and talk about all this
[23:57.440 --> 24:03.680]  later in the next hour on this live global Sunday transmission exclusive information.
[24:03.680 --> 24:09.120]  Trump set to ban interstate commerce. I'm going to say one more thing ladies and gentlemen,
[24:09.120 --> 24:14.320]  not just interstate commerce. That was a floating slip. Trump set to ban interstate travel, which
[24:14.320 --> 24:19.360]  means it will cripple commerce. So everybody wanting toilet paper and everybody wanting that know
[24:19.360 --> 24:26.400]  what you want your cigarettes and beer and alcohol because that's going to be what people want during
[24:26.400 --> 24:33.360]  an emergency. And the Democrats are already running around in Illinois and in New York passing
[24:33.360 --> 24:39.760]  emergency declarations to ban firearms. Oh, I should have let the show with that. I was to ban
[24:39.760 --> 24:45.760]  firearms and to allow the confiscation and to ban the sale of firearms during this martial law
[24:45.760 --> 24:51.040]  police state drill that we're going into. This is a martial law police state drill. It's a real
[24:51.040 --> 24:56.480]  virus, but they're hyping it up. And the tyranny is the greater threat. This is the 21st century
[24:56.480 --> 25:02.400]  system. It's how the globalists plan to take control. I just can't believe that people don't
[25:02.400 --> 25:09.040]  understand it's going to be the liquor stores. And it's going to be the pharmacies people wanting
[25:09.040 --> 25:13.920]  drugs for being sick or for the panic. It's not going to be the damn toilet paper, ladies and
[25:13.920 --> 25:18.720]  gentlemen. So everybody better understand that essential services will start breaking down.
[25:19.360 --> 25:23.600]  This is going to create a huge panic. And you watch the globalists are going to launch bigger
[25:23.600 --> 25:28.640]  migrant invasions. I'm predicting notice to coincide with what happened in Europe. Soros
[25:29.200 --> 25:35.440]  and others launched a bigger migrant invasion and so did Erdogan out of Turkey. So there's
[25:35.440 --> 25:40.400]  going to be other things pop up. I predict a war is going to start. I predict new viruses are going
[25:40.400 --> 25:45.840]  to pop up in the next 60 days. I predict giant migrant floods. We already know we're on their
[25:45.840 --> 25:51.600]  way are going to hammer the United States Southwest border during this. And the left will say we can
[25:51.600 --> 25:56.560]  control that border even when you're locked up in your house and can't go down the street. So
[25:57.360 --> 26:01.440]  everybody better get their orders into info wars.com right now for the high quality products,
[26:01.440 --> 26:08.080]  the storeable food, the super great immune garble that's back in the super awesome whitening toothpaste
[26:08.080 --> 26:11.840]  with the nano silver and the super blue toothpaste that has it because that was the last thing they
[26:11.840 --> 26:17.600]  try to stop will be the delivery trucks around the country. So it's critical to get your orders in
[26:17.600 --> 26:21.520]  now because you heard Tom Papert. The next thing they're going to do is try to restrict
[26:21.520 --> 26:26.720]  non essential travel within cities and towns. They're going to pick a few cities that are the
[26:26.720 --> 26:31.200]  epicenter first to set the precedent. I predict that they start locking Seattle down by the middle
[26:31.200 --> 26:36.480]  of next week. We'll be covering all of this as well during the weekday show that is 11 a.m. to
[26:36.480 --> 26:41.360]  3 p.m. Central. Mike Adams will have Dr. Francis Boyle that offered the U.S. Biological Weapons
[26:41.360 --> 26:45.920]  Treaty whose document of this being manmade. He'll be on. We'll also have Norm Paterson
[26:46.640 --> 26:50.800]  all beyond. We'll have so many other great crew. Don't forget David Knight
[26:50.800 --> 26:57.120]  is weekday mornings 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. with excellent analysis as well. And then of course
[26:57.120 --> 27:02.960]  Owen Schreuer with the war of needs no introduction 3 to 6 p.m. Central live coverage from the people's
[27:02.960 --> 27:06.720]  operation in full wars dot com. Now Norm I'm going to let you I'm going to get off here so you can
[27:06.720 --> 27:12.320]  talk and so Papert can recap what you discovered from the White House today confirmed by my Pentagon
[27:12.320 --> 27:18.400]  sources and how huge this is and the ongoing imminent announcement in May Trump back down.
[27:18.400 --> 27:23.920]  Who knows? Norm Paterson please take over. I was in my office on a Sunday afternoon doing what
[27:23.920 --> 27:29.920]  lawyers do for preparing for a week of litigation when I got a call from somebody with connections
[27:29.920 --> 27:34.640]  to the White House. This was somebody you would can had heard through members of the Federalist
[27:34.640 --> 27:40.080]  Society that President Trump has apparently made a decision to announce this evening at 30 30 day
[27:40.080 --> 27:46.000]  three zero day ban on interstate travel. And this of course has the White House legal counsel's
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.040]  office in an uproar because such a move would be unprecedented and probably unlawful in the
[27:51.040 --> 27:57.120]  United States. So as we speak there is a debate going on in the White House about whether the
[27:57.120 --> 28:02.640]  president has the lawful authority to impose an interstate travel ban. This has sent me and
[28:02.640 --> 28:08.240]  lawyers in my office to the law library to figure out if he does and it's unclear on the United
[28:08.240 --> 28:13.760]  States Supreme Court has held that the right to interstate travel is a fundamental constitutional
[28:13.760 --> 28:19.040]  right but it's never been pinned to an exact clause the Constitution. Some people think it's
[28:19.040 --> 28:23.200]  implicit in the Fifth Amendment's right there guarantee of due process of law to all people
[28:23.200 --> 28:27.920]  in the United States. Others think it's part of the privileges and immunities clause in the 14th
[28:27.920 --> 28:32.880]  Amendment. But in 1999 the last time the court ruled on the right to travel in a case called
[28:32.880 --> 28:39.360]  Cyan SAENV versus Roe. Norm Pattison or Tom Pamper here. We're getting ready to go to break. When
[28:39.360 --> 28:44.320]  we come back I want to talk a little bit about definitely the legal the legality surrounding
[28:44.320 --> 28:49.520]  this but I also want to get into why President Trump thinks this is the right bet as you alluded
[28:49.520 --> 28:54.080]  to earlier he's kind of in a damned if you do damned if you don't with the Democrats calling
[28:54.080 --> 28:58.560]  for this tyranny and then of course once they get it they will holler at him as a tyrant for
[28:58.560 --> 29:03.680]  doing it don't go away we'll be right back. As we witness the most disastrous geological activity
[29:03.680 --> 29:10.320]  in recorded history the globalists are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil
[29:10.320 --> 29:17.840]  war. Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged. The world is going to change
[29:17.840 --> 29:24.240]  and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system
[29:24.240 --> 29:31.360]  fails. The system is vulnerable. Electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores
[29:31.360 --> 29:37.840]  could be empty in three days. Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give
[29:37.840 --> 29:43.360]  you a fighting chance in the next level and being without puts you at the mercy of others
[29:43.360 --> 29:49.920]  or makes you a slave to a dying system. Buy storable foods and an Alexa pure gravity water

[31:12.720 --> 31:17.200]  rallies over that said about two months ago i came with a plan that i haven't launched yet

[31:28.000 --> 31:31.920]  like duct tape it's just a regular sticker you put it over your mouth you'd go to a trump rally

[33:16.720 --> 33:27.680]  resistance to tyrants his obedience to god it's alex jones
[33:31.680 --> 33:36.400]  welcome back to this global exclusive i'm tom papper national file dot com here with norm
[33:36.400 --> 33:42.160]  pan is one of the country's most successful trial attorneys he has an amazing win ratio and he is
[33:42.160 --> 33:48.000]  delivering crucial information about the future of this country as we brace for this coronavirus
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.200]  epidemic and really it's the panic that i think is getting people in trouble norm is breaking down
[33:53.200 --> 33:59.440]  what president trump is about to do according to all reports according to norm paterson sources
[33:59.440 --> 34:06.400]  norm paterson sources we are looking at a total ban on interstate travel norm you are breaking down
[34:06.400 --> 34:10.960]  the legalities of this and that is rather unclear whether or not this is something the president
[34:10.960 --> 34:17.520]  could get away with but why do you think president trump thinks this is a good idea apparently he's
[34:17.520 --> 34:22.880]  late to the game as to the coronavirus i mean i you know i'm in the northeast close to new york
[34:22.880 --> 34:27.280]  city i hear a lot the hospitals are terrified medical professionals are bracing themselves
[34:27.280 --> 34:31.920]  for an inability to care for all the people that they will become ill and the thinking appears to
[34:31.920 --> 34:38.080]  be that if we can slow down interaction between people increase social distancing the virus won't
[34:38.080 --> 34:42.720]  take root quite as deeply quite as quickly and we'll be able to deal with the most critically ill
[34:42.720 --> 34:47.920]  so i think this is a misplaced gesture on mr trump's part believing that if you locked the country
[34:47.920 --> 34:53.760]  down the virus can't spread the problem is it's an overreaction i think everyone agrees that
[34:53.760 --> 34:58.560]  there's going to be social transmission of it and you begin to wonder about its secondary motive
[34:59.280 --> 35:03.520]  he appears not to have given the issue much thought he eviscerated the department of public
[35:03.520 --> 35:09.840]  or the cdc rather um and now the cdc is playing catch up and i think rather than dealing in a
[35:09.840 --> 35:15.920]  narrowly tailored fashion with um issues that are clearly within the national government's
[35:15.920 --> 35:20.560]  authority he's overreaching now some say and i've heard alex say it i don't know you you may
[35:20.560 --> 35:25.840]  believe it that this is part of a larger conspiracy to destroy civil liberties in the country in the
[35:25.840 --> 35:32.720]  name of an overarching set of powers i certainly hope not um but i do think that big tech um and
[35:32.720 --> 35:39.200]  the emergence of ai creates an unusual world um in 1776 adam wealth wrote the wealth of nations
[35:39.200 --> 35:43.440]  adam smith rather wrote the wealth of nations and that he talked about the power of markets and he
[35:43.440 --> 35:49.120]  said there's an invisible hand and that invisible hand allocates resources efficiently and if we
[35:49.120 --> 35:55.040]  interfere with it we create inefficiency but here's a question that i think ai raised and that is
[35:55.040 --> 36:02.000]  can an algorithm sufficiently powerful armed with a vision of human welfare um efficiently
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.800]  more efficiently than a market allocate resources my hunch is that there are plenty of people call
[36:06.800 --> 36:13.520]  them globalists who think that so however here's the issue somebody has to create the algorithm
[36:13.520 --> 36:18.400]  and if it's the one percent or the people sitting in silicon valley or if it's bill gates
[36:18.400 --> 36:24.160]  and uh mark zuckerberg and people with enormous wealth who secretly control the algorithm deciding
[36:24.160 --> 36:30.640]  who has access and who doesn't then it's not so much um the ai determining what best promotes
[36:30.640 --> 36:36.880]  human happiness it's ai imposing a particular version of human happiness so i think the history
[36:36.880 --> 36:42.240]  of this country has always been that government is regarded with distrust and that we the people
[36:42.240 --> 36:47.280]  retain sovereignty that's what distinguishes us from china which has an organic conception of the
[36:47.280 --> 36:52.720]  state where individuals are subservient cogs in a larger wheel it's what distinguishes us from europe
[36:52.720 --> 36:57.440]  which really does not have an aura a bill of rights with the teeth that are done so i think
[36:57.440 --> 37:02.560]  we're at a constitutional turning point here i think that you know that talks about suicide by
[37:02.560 --> 37:07.760]  despair and and and the sense of disentitlement and flyover country that cost the elite by
[37:07.760 --> 37:13.440]  surprise in the 2016 election i think it's time for the people to roar back um i don't know if
[37:13.440 --> 37:17.280]  you have the means to post the number of the white house switchboard but in my fantasy
[37:17.280 --> 37:22.160]  like the white house switchboard gets a million calls within the next hour thing do not suspend
[37:22.160 --> 37:26.800]  interstate travel because if you do that i'm not going to be able to get materials from interstate
[37:26.800 --> 37:31.040]  travel or the alternative the federal government's going to have to license people at the border
[37:31.040 --> 37:35.760]  i may not be able to travel to my job across across state lines i may not be able to visit my
[37:35.760 --> 37:40.720]  family across state lines without a permit if you're going to license travel if you're going
[37:40.720 --> 37:45.760]  to have permits to travel what do you need to enforce that you need an overwhelming show of
[37:45.760 --> 37:51.280]  force that each and every border what institution can do that you know i i don't know i i i'd like
[37:51.280 --> 37:55.760]  to think this is not a prelude to martial law but if you're going to have a rule that needs to be
[37:55.760 --> 38:00.560]  enforced you need an enforcement agency and i guess that would be the military so i think the
[38:00.560 --> 38:05.440]  president is panicking i think that there are forecasts of enormous numbers of deaths and
[38:05.440 --> 38:11.120]  the federal government's been caught unprepared but contrast this with the great flu uh influenza
[38:11.120 --> 38:20.080]  virus uh pandemic or epidemic in 1918 we lost 650 000 americans the influenza related deaths in 1918
[38:20.080 --> 38:25.520]  that was 13 times more than the total number of american casualties in world war one but
[38:25.520 --> 38:31.280]  yet we pressed on with dignity yet we pressed on with state sovereignty yet we pressed on
[38:31.280 --> 38:36.320]  within the commitment to individual liberties it wasn't perfect but it wasn't a wholesale
[38:36.320 --> 38:41.360]  abrogation of individual responsibility and and bowing in the direction of the state
[38:41.360 --> 38:47.280]  that we seem prepared to do and that donald trump would be the vehicle uh of this message to me is
[38:47.280 --> 38:54.320]  shocking i completely agree with your analysis spot on and i would just add in 1918 uh president
[38:54.320 --> 39:00.080]  wilson actually got that flu he continued with his job he did not force americans to do anything
[39:00.080 --> 39:05.280]  and saying uh churches willingly canceled their own cut their own services people locked themselves
[39:05.280 --> 39:09.920]  down it blew over in a few years with a tragic amount of deaths norman the next segment will
[39:09.920 --> 39:15.280]  read off that white house switchboard number we had it up on screen so tv viewers could get that
[39:15.280 --> 39:19.360]  in the next segment as well and i guess i can ask well we've still got a couple seconds left here
[39:19.360 --> 39:24.240]  we've got about three minutes to me it seems as though at this stage of course we're still 10 to
[39:24.240 --> 39:29.120]  15 days behind italy if you just look at a one-to-one comparison between the two countries
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.840]  it seems so far the panic is worse than the virus now that is very likely to change but
[39:35.840 --> 39:39.920]  do you think if president trump does this if he goes ahead with this i mean what do you imagine
[39:39.920 --> 39:45.120]  that will do to the americans who are already out there hoarding of all things toilet paper i mean
[39:45.120 --> 39:49.760]  that that can only create more panic correct absolutely i mean you know there was a wonderful
[39:49.760 --> 39:53.760]  piece it will create more panic there was a wonderful piece in yesterday's wall street
[39:53.760 --> 39:58.320]  journal that talked about the history of epidemics in the united states and how we typically had them
[39:58.320 --> 40:03.120]  in the 50s you know stulk created the polio vaccine uh those of us of a certain age recall
[40:03.120 --> 40:07.680]  friends just a little bit older than us who may have had polio we got over that we've eliminated
[40:07.680 --> 40:11.680]  cholera we've eliminated you know the uh mumps and measles for the most part although they're on
[40:11.680 --> 40:16.960]  their way back um we've become complacent and seem to think that we've won our battle against the
[40:16.960 --> 40:23.280]  microbe um but evolution has a way of continuing to advance um and new organisms appear i think we
[40:23.280 --> 40:28.720]  were caught with our public health pants down this time around um and there is collective
[40:28.720 --> 40:34.320]  benefit and collective good and things like the cbc um i wish the president paid a little more
[40:34.320 --> 40:38.720]  attention to hard science and a little less attention to his twitter rate to his twitter
[40:38.720 --> 40:43.680]  feed my deepest fear is that if he announces something tonight it'll be just as a means of
[40:43.680 --> 40:48.320]  preempting bernie uh bernie standards and joe biden's debate because if there's one place where
[40:48.320 --> 40:53.040]  trump is comfortable that's at the front of the media line and he's not been there for a while
[40:54.880 --> 40:59.600]  that again is completely accurate you say his twitter feed i would add uh fox news which except
[40:59.600 --> 41:04.800]  for one uh one commentator on that network has been completely downplaying this to the point
[41:04.800 --> 41:09.680]  where they've now suspended a couple of reporters who called coronavirus a democrat scam and of
[41:09.680 --> 41:14.480]  course the big part of the scam i think is this panic the thing the reason why people are going
[41:14.480 --> 41:19.280]  out and uh buying entire store's worth of toilet paper and putting them in the back of their truck
[41:19.280 --> 41:23.200]  so norm in the next segment we've broken down kind of what's going to happen it's going to create
[41:23.200 --> 41:28.400]  more panic it's going to create a constitutional turning point it's going to possibly necessitate
[41:28.400 --> 41:33.120]  martial law because if you're keeping people i mean there's major highways there's also just
[41:33.120 --> 41:38.080]  rural streets that go from state to state in this country to shut all of this down you're going to
[41:38.080 --> 41:43.920]  need some type of occupying force on every single state's border it just does not seem like something
[41:43.920 --> 41:50.160]  that is going to be done without as you alluded the military or the national guard or a bunch of
[41:50.160 --> 41:56.080]  militarized police or something and i this can only end in martial law in my opinion if this goes
[41:56.080 --> 42:00.800]  through so norm we've got about a minute less left in the next segment i want to break down
[42:00.800 --> 42:06.960]  the legalities of this assuming you've got time but we've got about 45 seconds how how is this
[42:06.960 --> 42:11.120]  going to go say this happens tonight you're in court tomorrow we've got about 40 seconds how will
[42:11.120 --> 42:17.680]  this work we'd ask for an emergency hearing an order of a temporary restraining order or injunction
[42:18.560 --> 42:23.520]  barring this order from going into effect and then if we didn't get that we'd ask for an immediate
[42:23.520 --> 42:27.440]  right to take an appeal to a federal appellate court in new york city that's the second circuit
[42:27.440 --> 42:31.760]  court of appeals for this part of the country now barring that we've made an emergency run at the
[42:31.760 --> 42:37.440]  united space supreme court so it would be about a week to 20 days very intense legal fighting
[42:38.480 --> 42:43.200]  a week to 20 days very intense legal fighting who knows what happens between them i want to
[42:43.200 --> 42:47.040]  dive deeper into this because a lot of americans are going to be worried i mean you know like
[42:47.040 --> 42:51.600]  folks like you who you might live in one state and work in another uh those of us in the midwest
[42:51.600 --> 42:55.520]  may not have to worry about that what about places like hands of city where it's right on the border
[42:55.520 --> 42:59.040]  this is going to raise a lot of questions and there's a lot of people on edge we'll be right back

[44:10.640 --> 44:16.160]  they're going to strike back and the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third
[44:16.160 --> 44:22.560]  world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the
[44:22.560 --> 44:29.040]  west and collapse our social services in a giant clowered and pivot program the UN also has said
[44:29.040 --> 44:36.160]  they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government inner coronavirus this is a

[46:07.200 --> 46:13.680]  done but for me it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food and i had long discussions
[46:13.680 --> 46:17.040]  this morning over an hour long discussion with different individuals at different levels of
[46:17.040 --> 46:21.360]  this right down the folks run the plants to get the best idea we have but they want me to say
[46:21.360 --> 46:26.320]  six to eight weeks just so people aren't getting pissed but understand the last food company the
[46:26.320 --> 46:31.840]  biggest food company is now at hundreds of times their regular order and they were having discussions
[46:31.840 --> 46:36.320]  with me about stopping the promotion of food sales next week and at a certain point just saying
[46:36.320 --> 46:40.480]  we're done because people are going to take food orders out 10 weeks we don't want to sit on your
[46:40.480 --> 46:44.320]  money 10 weeks and then just all the weirdness that comes with that because we're honest under
[46:44.320 --> 46:48.320]  promise over delivered but technically it's going to be six to eight weeks and we want you to get a
[46:48.320 --> 46:52.560]  great deal and feel like we took care of you so you come back again we want relationships with

[46:57.040 --> 47:08.480]  and we've been blessed by you we're all in this together you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:17.520 --> 47:24.480]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the front
[47:24.480 --> 47:33.200]  lines of the info war welcome back to the alex jones show i'm tom pappard editor in chief
[47:33.200 --> 47:37.920]  national file dot com here with norm paddus one of the country's most successful lawyers
[47:37.920 --> 47:44.080]  who got startling news earlier today the president trump is actively pursuing and may indeed announce
[47:44.080 --> 47:50.400]  tonight a ban on all interstate travel in the united states of america would be crippling to the
[47:50.400 --> 47:55.520]  economy it would only add to the growing amount of panic that we're seeing in this country it may
[47:55.520 --> 48:00.240]  or may not even be legal so norm in the last segment he said one of the things that folks
[48:00.240 --> 48:05.680]  should do is immediately call the white house leave a message saying that you do not want this
[48:05.680 --> 48:11.440]  to happen you are opposed to this morally economically everything well that number for radio listeners
[48:11.440 --> 48:17.120]  we had it on screen in the last segment but for radio listeners that is two zero two four five six
[48:17.120 --> 48:24.160]  one four one four two zero two four five six one four one four and i do want to remind everybody
[48:24.160 --> 48:28.560]  as well i mean it's you're now looking at a delay if you go to info wars store dot com and try to
[48:28.560 --> 48:33.440]  buy storable food but it's probably better late than never it's also a good time to get products
[48:33.440 --> 48:38.960]  on info wars store dot com that will boost your health boost your immune system give you a chance
[48:38.960 --> 48:44.000]  to not get the regular flu not get the cold definitely not get coronavirus just by having
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.840]  a healthy immune system it's the same reason we all buy fruits and vegetables and the reason
[48:47.840 --> 48:52.240]  why we should all be getting eight hours of sleep at night especially in cold and flu and
[48:52.240 --> 48:56.960]  coronavirus season it's being called by some so norm in the last segment we started to talk about
[48:56.960 --> 49:02.240]  the legality of this you describe very well the process that you would take as a lawyer as a person
[49:02.240 --> 49:07.600]  who runs a very successful law firm what you would do should this announcement be made and you said
[49:07.600 --> 49:15.280]  it could be a week to 20 days a very very messy a wake through the night running on coffee a law
[49:16.160 --> 49:20.240]  there i guess is what you call this to try to keep this from happening i describe
[49:20.240 --> 49:25.600]  what that might look like i mean is this something that is going to if if god forbid this happens in
[49:25.600 --> 49:33.120]  the next few hours are and it's not immediately shot down by the first judge who sees it is this
[49:33.120 --> 49:39.680]  going to go into effect well it may although i'm told that since you i got a tweet from somebody
[49:39.680 --> 49:43.840]  or tweet a text message from somebody during the break that there's a press conference going on
[49:43.840 --> 49:49.200]  right now and that president may have walked it back and that we checked the president's twitter
[49:49.200 --> 49:53.760]  feed apparently he made some sort of crack about don't buy so many groceries everybody calm down
[49:53.760 --> 49:58.880]  and apparently mike pence is still speaking now or so i'm told i'm i'm on the phone with you
[49:58.880 --> 50:05.040]  so let's assume that there is a legal challenge to this the first question is who's who's a plaintiff
[50:05.040 --> 50:09.040]  and that that would be anybody who has standing it would be anybody with a that has the right to
[50:09.040 --> 50:13.280]  travel so any citizen we'd have to find somebody to bring the action under i may bring it under
[50:13.280 --> 50:18.000]  my own name because i have to travel down to austin to work with alex i go once a month i don't want
[50:18.000 --> 50:24.080]  to be banned from doing my job um then you you you you you file a complaint in court a short
[50:24.080 --> 50:29.200]  complaint statement together with briefs about why you think this is an unconstitutional mom
[50:29.200 --> 50:33.840]  infringement on people's liberties why it breaks the fundamental right of ours you have a quick
[50:33.840 --> 50:38.480]  hearing in front of the judge you ask for first an ex parte hearing in other words you say the
[50:38.480 --> 50:42.640]  government shouldn't even have a chance to be heard on this this is transparently outrageous
[50:42.640 --> 50:47.680]  if the government grants that or if the court grants that then there could be a stay while the
[50:47.680 --> 50:52.160]  government had a chance to respond that's extraordinary if we didn't get that then the
[50:52.160 --> 50:56.240]  government would have a very brief period within which to respond and there'd be argument before
[50:56.240 --> 51:01.200]  the district court judge that judge would then make a decision most likely from the bench the
[51:01.200 --> 51:05.920]  loser would then have an opportunity to take an immediate appeal to the federal circuit court
[51:05.920 --> 51:11.120]  of appeals and i believe that court would hear it quickly um that the loser of that battle then
[51:11.120 --> 51:15.920]  would have an opportunity to take a writ of certiori which is a request to the united
[51:15.920 --> 51:21.120]  state supreme court that they hear the matter promptly i think all of that could take uh you
[51:21.120 --> 51:27.200]  know up to 20 days to play that cycle out which from a lawyer's perspective is the speed of light
[51:27.200 --> 51:31.200]  i chuckled when you talked about coffee and sleepless nights that those are just what goes
[51:31.200 --> 51:37.040]  with the terminal offer but this would be an extraordinary um extraordinarily stressful period
[51:37.040 --> 51:41.280]  um but it would and i think it'd be one of those cases where the courts would drop everything to
[51:41.280 --> 51:47.360]  hear it because such a move is unprecedented in the united states um you know the closest thing
[51:47.360 --> 51:53.280]  that comes to mind is abraham lincoln's suspension of the writ of habeas corpus during the civil war
[51:53.280 --> 51:58.880]  but that was when there was a civil war when states had thought to succeed from the union and we
[51:58.880 --> 52:04.640]  were actually killing one another um and i think lincoln's calculus at that point was when the very
[52:05.200 --> 52:10.800]  nature when the very republic is at issue um extraordinary means are necessary um to protect
[52:10.800 --> 52:16.880]  it and to save it i think president trump may say something like well you know suspending fundamental
[52:16.880 --> 52:22.560]  constitutional rights is the same thing um i'm just not so sure i'm prepared to follow him there
[52:22.560 --> 52:28.240]  when what's assaulting us is nature um i you know whether the coronavirus is man made or not that's
[52:28.240 --> 52:33.040]  beyond my pay grade all i know is that people are getting it state by state and a significant
[52:33.040 --> 52:38.560]  number of them are dying um me and my family are taking precautions i don't think we're being hysteric
[52:38.560 --> 52:44.320]  we just recognize the risk um i'm not sure that we want the government trying to make life risk
[52:44.320 --> 52:49.760]  free by the suspension of our civil liberties but i fear that many americans have come to that point
[52:49.760 --> 52:55.280]  and why do i say that look at the debate about privacy with respect to um big tech with respect
[52:55.280 --> 53:00.640]  to twitter with respect to facebook with respect to google um people are saying such things as i
[53:00.640 --> 53:07.840]  am prepared um to give up some of my privacy so long as i get more security i guess the next step
[53:07.840 --> 53:13.520]  as we habituate ourselves to the loss of these things is i guess i'm now prepared to sacrifice
[53:13.520 --> 53:19.920]  my liberty for the sake of life there was a time uh when a rallying cry in this country was give me
[53:19.920 --> 53:26.000]  liberty or give me death um and i think we we need to reconsider those words carefully um this virus
[53:26.000 --> 53:31.120]  is not a political creature as near as i can tell it's an equal opportunity killer um and i think
[53:31.120 --> 53:36.000]  we need a collective public health response to deal with it i don't think that collective public
[53:36.000 --> 53:41.120]  health response to be politicized and i definitely don't think to be politicized at the extent of
[53:41.120 --> 53:48.800]  our loss of liberty again brilliant analysis from norm patis so norm i just i was reading some of the
[53:48.800 --> 53:54.080]  play by play of that press conference president trump is having so they did not make this announcement
[53:54.080 --> 53:59.840]  they did forecast a massive uptick in coronavirus cases because now more testing has been made
[53:59.840 --> 54:04.960]  available uh they have cautioned people to kind of what you said to that the supply chain is being
[54:04.960 --> 54:10.400]  disrupted but there is no actual shortage of food and supplies it seems as though they're now trying
[54:10.400 --> 54:15.600]  to stave off a panic or a greater panic than what we're seeing right now i mean it's it's getting
[54:15.600 --> 54:20.960]  kind of insane i've heard reports of fistfights in parking lots on the east coast uh but it seems
[54:20.960 --> 54:26.560]  as though the goal right now is to save off the panic but what i had heard is essentially similar
[54:26.560 --> 54:30.960]  to what alex had heard which is that this was going to come in a week and what you just said
[54:30.960 --> 54:36.320]  that americans are getting more and more used to the idea of their civil liberties being erased i mean
[54:36.320 --> 54:41.760]  i come from a generation that has lived with tsa for as long as i can remember my first flight
[54:41.760 --> 54:47.120]  tsa was there grouping you're making a great point now it's shown here popping in back live
[54:47.120 --> 54:51.520]  i just had to call him because it's so historical here i am a few hours ago learning trump set to
[54:51.520 --> 54:56.240]  have a press conference from white house sources that normers talked to and i have my other sources
[54:56.240 --> 55:01.840]  for essentially martial law he was against this early on but they put him under pressure
[55:01.840 --> 55:06.720]  in the media saying he's bad deaths are on his hands basically putting him into this but now
[55:06.720 --> 55:13.120]  i guess we're learning that he did decide to put the announcement off because he was being
[55:13.120 --> 55:17.680]  pressured not to do it this is just simply incredible second hour is coming up but just i just i just
[55:17.680 --> 55:21.360]  wanted to call in and ask norm this because i heard you guys talking about it started erupting
[55:21.360 --> 55:25.840]  alex jones here calling in his own show norm go go back and repeat exactly what your source of the
[55:25.840 --> 55:30.080]  federalist society said because that mirrored what i was getting from the pentagon but i was told it
[55:30.080 --> 55:35.520]  was one in in in one week uh that they were pressuring him not to do this what were their
[55:35.520 --> 55:40.720]  reasons for that and it looks like he's not done it yet about an hour and a half ago i received
[55:40.720 --> 55:46.800]  a call from someone who said sources in the white house uh reported that president trump was
[55:46.800 --> 55:53.200]  prepared this evening to announce a three zero thirty day travel ban on interstate travel above
[55:53.200 --> 55:58.640]  in the united states and that its legal counsel's office was urging him not to do so on the grounds
[55:58.640 --> 56:05.440]  that such a move would be unlawful uh what other policy arguments took place no one told me that
[56:06.000 --> 56:11.120]  but from a lawyer's perspective the claim was look mr president you just can't do this in the
[56:11.120 --> 56:16.480]  united states such a move would be unprecedented and it appears that they won the debate at least for
[56:16.480 --> 56:22.480]  tonight well but as europe locks down everybody else locks down and then we do see i mean let's face it
[56:22.480 --> 56:26.160]  china's an authoritarian country but they don't fight as much as we do just like japan when they
[56:26.160 --> 56:30.400]  have an earthquake they don't kill each other america has been so divided and so programmed
[56:30.960 --> 56:36.080]  to to to destroy ourselves uh and we've got 40 million illegal aliens and we've got
[56:37.280 --> 56:42.240]  50 million people hand to mouth uh but almost a hundred million on welfare but 50 million
[56:42.240 --> 56:48.480]  it's estimated hand to mouth this is a gigantic time bomb ladies and gentlemen and with the
[56:48.480 --> 56:53.520]  homeless and the fentanyl and the chai comms hitting us with a fentanyl it's just an insane time
[56:53.520 --> 56:58.480]  and coming up next hour com average is going to be finishing up here and we've got a big
[56:58.480 --> 57:03.840]  exclusive interview i taped it yesterday with the motor city madman uh ted newton so that's
[57:03.840 --> 57:08.080]  coming up for several of the segments but there'll be a few live segments coming up we're gonna hear
[57:08.080 --> 57:14.240]  a short piece by greg reese at about six after so when we start the next hour where he details the
[57:14.240 --> 57:19.840]  fact that this is the perfect cover for a global financial reset and we talked about this months
[57:19.840 --> 57:24.880]  ago now they're admitting that so make no mistake this is a manufactured virus it's been released
[57:24.880 --> 57:29.760]  by the deep state and the globalists with the chinese communist uh it's man made and they don't
[57:29.760 --> 57:34.800]  want us to discuss that even though mainline scientists and then top universities are confirming
[57:34.800 --> 57:40.960]  it so we've got to expose where it came from its origin to understand who's behind it and how to
[57:40.960 --> 57:45.840]  stop it so norm patis please join us again tomorrow during the weekday show thank you so much norm

[1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:22.800]  ladies and gentlemen it is with a very sad heart that i have to report to you
[1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:29.840]  that our detailed deep immersion and deep dive in the research in the globalist attack profile
[1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:35.920]  and how they plan to bring in total world government and defeat the free market system
[1:00:35.920 --> 1:00:41.520]  in christianity would be bio weapons and the fear that comes out of it you could see it with
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:47.840]  hollywood and all the pre-programming you could see it with the disease x u in announcements of
[1:00:47.840 --> 1:00:53.120]  over a year ago and the bill gates preparations they don't do something this big without massive
[1:00:53.120 --> 1:01:01.920]  preparations and they're behind it and they're the ones running it and we don't know every facet
[1:01:01.920 --> 1:01:06.880]  of the attack plan but we know it's synthetic we know it's from the globalist we know democrats
[1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:13.040]  are passing laws or making emergency declarations in illinois and other areas like new york to
[1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:18.160]  confiscate firearms they are going to use this ladies and gentlemen to teach us to not live in
[1:01:18.160 --> 1:01:24.640]  an open pre-society and i interrupted tom to ask the question of norm before he left about
[1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:29.040]  what it's like to be young i mean i'm still pretty young think yourself as young as 46 but tom's
[1:01:29.040 --> 1:01:35.280]  really young successful businessman and runs a tv station but uh this is really the death of the west
[1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:38.880]  it's the death of freedom this is the chinese communist social score showing us how it could
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:45.920]  protect them from their own man-made virus so this is this is hysteria this is evil we predicted it
[1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:51.040]  almost seven weeks ago we laid it out that it's the hysteria that's the danger not the virus
[1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:56.240]  but there's other mutations of the virus there's a lot of stuff going on and if we pass the test
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:02:00.960]  and submit to the tyranny and submit to this then they're going to launch even more deadly
[1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:05.760]  bio weapons in the future because they have the incentive to because we behave and we lock down
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:10.560]  and we do what they say during it and then they can give us the forced inoculations
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:15.440]  they can make a submit to them it's already out that the flu shots are sterilizing men
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:20.000]  this is all about sterilization this is all about forced inoculation this is all about
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:25.280]  world government so i i have to tell you what democrats wanted to keep the borders wide open
[1:02:25.280 --> 1:02:31.120]  they wanted to do all of this i'm going to oppose trump uh if he you know says lock down
[1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:34.480]  everything i'm not going to call for uprisings or anything like that but i'm just going to
[1:02:34.480 --> 1:02:38.560]  point out that the borders have been wide open the left wanted that so why should we lock down
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:42.960]  all the cities now setting the precedent that every time there's some novel virus out there
[1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:48.240]  that we're not sure how many people it kills uh that we all just throw all of our freedoms
[1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:53.280]  out the window i understand that riding along on this big wave of hysteria would be financially
[1:02:53.280 --> 1:02:58.320]  successful for us uh and i want people to be prepared and ready and i'm proud of what we've
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:03.280]  done to do that but but but not so much for this virus but for the globalist trying to cause a new
[1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:08.880]  civil war a race war a financial collapse because make no mistake this is the cover for that so
[1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:13.520]  government doesn't get blamed during a collapse government will be the solution and the savior
[1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:18.640]  during the collapse and behind that government is the technocracy that controls the enforcing ai
[1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:22.720]  and the systems that we know are not of this world and are anti-human so i'll be back tomorrow
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:27.520]  live lord willing with um tom papert many others at 11 a.m. central i'll now be hosting i can never
[1:03:27.520 --> 1:03:31.760]  go on a short vacation that's okay well horses couldn't drag me away i'm actually in texas very
[1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:36.400]  close to austin try to spend some time with the family but i will be in tomorrow tom papert's
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:40.800]  about to take over for a few segments and then we have the powerful ted nusion interview on this
[1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:46.240]  very subject coming up back to tom papert of national file dot com i'm alex jones with info
[1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:50.880]  wars dot com we told you it was all coming it's happening exactly as we said yes ladies and
[1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:54.800]  gentlemen the new world order is real and it's evil and it hates you and your guts and wants to kill
[1:03:54.800 --> 1:04:01.600]  you well we'll have more analysis on the other side of this short break as long with a couple
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:05.360]  of great reports and that exclusive interview that alex recorded yesterday with the one and
[1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:10.320]  only ted nusion but i do just want to point out piggybacking on what alex just said this was all
[1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:17.040]  predicted here on info wars on national file on info wars dot com news wars dot com to the letter
[1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:21.600]  the disease was bad maybe not as bad and lethal as it's being promoted to be out and it's the
[1:04:21.600 --> 1:04:26.240]  hysteria that's going to be the problem this was all predicted this was all broken down
[1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:33.120]  on this very network by the that very man i was happy to be a part of it but alex's analysis on
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:40.960]  corona virus has thus far been 100 dead on the money and i certainly hope that alex's voice
[1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:44.880]  along with those who are attempting to persuade president trump are successful
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:48.400]  and getting him to stave this off it's insane we have an open border with mexico we have an
[1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:52.800]  open border with canada who are the prime minister's wife is sick it's not going to work it's not
[1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:56.400]  going to calm things down don't go away we'll be right back after this short break
[1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:04.000]  you want to break some globalist ribs you want to crush some skulls politically you want to drive
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:08.800]  ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually there's nowhere you can spend money there's nowhere
[1:05:08.800 --> 1:05:16.480]  you can place your bet in a fight where it's gonna have more power per dollar your bang for your buck
[1:05:16.480 --> 1:05:23.520]  fear gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit of
[1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:28.640]  resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy and so it's very simple if you don't want to be slaves
[1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:33.760]  and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy which god wants to see you see we have to make
[1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:40.400]  the effort 110 god will finish the move and i know i need to stay in the fight in the attack attack
[1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:44.880]  attack i want to attack i want to go after the globalist and just believe me ladies and gentlemen
[1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:48.480]  that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together
[1:05:48.480 --> 1:05:53.200]  you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game i'm going to bust my ass with everything i got for
[1:05:53.200 --> 1:06:09.120]  us for myself and my family for your family because we're in this together infowarstore.com
[1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:17.600]  we're watching the alex jones show in the middle of this global broadcast this global exclusive
[1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:22.560]  we of course just heard a litany of news from norm patis alex jones buzzing in he tried to take a
[1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:29.040]  vacation the man just cannot leave this studio not in 2020 this very important election year
[1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:34.480]  there's a new report down it's available or will be shortly on band dot video by greg reese and it
[1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:42.480]  explains how the coronavirus is the perfect storm for a global currency reset let's view this clip now
[1:06:42.480 --> 1:06:56.160]  in 1816 the gold standard an economic unit of account based on a fixed quantity of gold
[1:06:56.720 --> 1:07:02.000]  was officially adopted and the world reserve currency became the british pound sterling
[1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:10.720]  in 1914 after world war one nations attempted to revive the gold standard but it collapsed
[1:07:10.720 --> 1:07:19.520]  during the great depression also in 1914 the federal reserve bank a private company was born
[1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:26.480]  after britain was devastated by world war two they were no longer a superpower and so the global
[1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:34.800]  reserve currency needed to be reset in 1944 at the britain woods conference the us dollar became the
[1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:41.040]  new global reserve currency this established america as the dominant power in the world economy
[1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:47.360]  giving america the sole ability to print dollars the rest of the world would need to trade their
[1:07:47.360 --> 1:07:52.640]  own currency against the us dollar in order to balance exchange rates keeping the international
[1:07:52.640 --> 1:08:00.240]  economy vibrant and fluid but by the 1960s the united states had printed more usd than their
[1:08:00.240 --> 1:08:07.520]  gold reserves could cover and by 1970 a growing american trade deficit was undermining the value
[1:08:07.520 --> 1:08:15.440]  of the dollar on august 15th 1971 president richard nixon brought an end to the gold standard
[1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:23.040]  federal reserve notes a fiat currency backed by debt rather than gold became the new standard
[1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:31.600]  this is basically no different than an i o u as one would expect right after president nixon gave
[1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:39.520]  his speech inflation began to rise and america's biggest export became debt the creation of the
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:46.560]  petro dollar gave the us even more sway over world economies and today the international debt has
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:54.960]  become untenable and many are saying another global currency reset is needed historically the
[1:08:54.960 --> 1:09:00.640]  gold standard has been the most stable economy we have known but gold can be manipulated and
[1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:07.600]  disruptive as well some are suggesting that cryptocurrency could be the solution crypto
[1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:14.240]  is run by an algorithm and can be designed to meet specific needs the global currency needs to have
[1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:21.600]  fluid supply and the limited gold supply failed to keep up with economic growth a sovereign free
[1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:29.120]  algorithm based alternative could potentially be more stable china is almost ready to launch
[1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:37.920]  their own cryptocurrency dcep short for digital currency electronic payments dcep is government
[1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:44.880]  controlled and fully centralized so far it appears to be a digital version of fiat paper money the
[1:09:44.880 --> 1:09:51.520]  federal reserve bank is developing their own crypto called fed coin the coronavirus pandemic
[1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:57.840]  seems to be the perfect storm for global currency reset the amount of money printing involved in
[1:09:57.840 --> 1:10:04.800]  holding up failing economies as quarantines and shutdowns take place will be unprecedented and
[1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:12.160]  all this does is weaken the us dollar even more and when the us dollar falls it will be replaced by
[1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:36.160]  something the question is which way will it go this is greg reese for info wars dot com info wars
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:44.320]  tomorrow's news today that was greg reese the new report is available up and banned dot video make
[1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:49.280]  sure to share that it is instrumental as norm pat is one of the most successful lawyers in the
[1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:55.760]  country was just saying in the last hour these algorithms the chinese cryptocurrency if it's
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:11:01.440]  ruled by an algorithm that's made by the chinese communist party heads i do not trust in nor do i
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:07.040]  particularly trust fed coin last week we saw them in check one point five trillion dollars in the
[1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:12.960]  form of a quote unquote loans into the stock market with the goal of trying to keep it from going
[1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:19.680]  down any further and it lasted all of 15 minutes before totally collapsing so one of the things
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:24.480]  alex brought up and we will have that exclusive interview with ted newton coming up i believe
[1:11:24.480 --> 1:11:30.000]  on the other side of this segment we'll find out but one of the things that alex brought up is that
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:34.560]  the president trump is likely looking at these options because of what's happening around the
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:40.240]  world and just as an example this is up a national file dot com the united kingdom government gives
[1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:48.320]  police emergency powers and may close pubs and ports as well as run crematoriums 24 7 another
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:54.400]  article up on national file dot com police with drones are enforcing the corona virus isolation
[1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:59.360]  in italy there's panic buying happening here in the united states we know that they're buying
[1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:04.320]  up the toilet paper the hand sanitizer these items that for some reason in 2020 people think they
[1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:11.040]  need to survive a virus that makes you cough but people are also buying up all of the ammunition
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:17.920]  at several stores throughout the country it's turning into we all know of course and the biggest
[1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:21.440]  story the number one story we're working on a massive hit on this right now is what's happening
[1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:26.960]  in the state of illinois where there is a town champagne that is essentially going to nationalize
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:33.920]  liquor food guns everything is all going to be in the purview of the state so this is already
[1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:38.800]  coming to america on the local level of president trump were to ban interstate commerce the little
[1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:45.600]  known fact that i cannot repeat enough in this country all groceries all stores will run completely
[1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:53.360]  out of stock in about 48 hours maybe 72 without semi trucks coming with supplies each and every
[1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:58.320]  day truckers are instrumental to this economy we used to have trains they're still important but
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:04.320]  fundamentally at this point it is all trucks that transport goods you can't fit this stuff in a plane
[1:13:04.320 --> 1:13:10.320]  you can't get trained to where it needs to be if there is a ban on interstate commerce people
[1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:13.920]  are probably going to start walking to these borders people are going to probably make it
[1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:18.560]  impossible to actually travel on a highway who knows what that will do to the supply chain
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:25.520]  they can only make things a hundred times worse and they already are by the way in italy where
[1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:31.360]  it's a much smaller country i mean it's about the same size as south korea for example there's
[1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:36.800]  videos showing the supermarket lines people have to line up to go to the store the only two reasons
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:41.760]  you can leave your house in italy i guess maybe three one to get medical help two to get medicine
[1:13:41.760 --> 1:13:48.080]  that you've been prescribed or three to go buy food and in italy there are videos showing lines
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:54.640]  stretching for miles outside the stores onto major highways people are having to line up
[1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:58.960]  that long so this is something that this is all going to come to the united states president trump
[1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:03.520]  is likely being told that if he what he does is not convince you with what europe is doing that he
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:09.040]  will be seen as weak he will be blamed for the deaths due to corona virus here in the united
[1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:14.400]  states of course he's in a rock and a hard play situation but it's going to be very difficult
[1:14:14.400 --> 1:14:20.000]  to defend the president we have an open border with canada canada was not included in the travel
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:25.200]  restriction and i i certainly hope she has a full and complete recovery but just in trudeau
[1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:31.760]  leader of canada's wife is ill with corona virus of course mexico the wall is only halfway complete
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.800]  and we have 40 million illegal immigrants in this country had they've been saying 11 million since i
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:41.680]  was born 25 years ago so if you listen to the official number there are 11 million illegal
[1:14:41.680 --> 1:14:47.120]  immigrants in this country most actual estimates suggest up to 40 i've heard as high as 60 these
[1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:53.760]  people in california spreading bubonic plague spreading diseases that we had previously eradicated
[1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:59.040]  that are now back not because of the anti-vaxxers which is what the left will tell you but because
[1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:03.200]  we are allowing people into this country we are allowing people to remain homeless on the streets
[1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:08.560]  and massive numbers and it all started on the west coast and they get sick and they spread the illness
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:13.200]  there was a report of a man a homeless man in california who was believed to have corona virus
[1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:18.720]  he was asked to self-quarantine the government gave him a place to do it and he left and reportedly
[1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:25.280]  robbed a store and went on to do who knows what spreading the virus all throughout so again i
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:28.880]  believe coming up on the other side we're going to have alex jones interviewing ted newton but
[1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:35.360]  this is very real and if i'm not back pampapert national file dot com make sure to share the
[1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:42.320]  articles at news wars dot com where the analysis on corona virus has been the best in the world
[1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:48.560]  nobody has been more on top of this virus than alex jones and the team at info wars and i'm
[1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:53.680]  very grateful to have had the ability to at least lend my voice to that from time to time
[1:15:53.680 --> 1:16:01.200]  you're watching the alex jones show don't go away hey steve how you doing hey alex oh my god
[1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:07.360]  longtime listener first-time caller look in january 2016 i went in a hospital i went to va
[1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:12.400]  hospital out here in boise and i was in there until june and i kept hearing dr group and all
[1:16:12.400 --> 1:16:16.960]  you guys talking about living defense let me tell you something man i had an internal
[1:16:16.960 --> 1:16:21.520]  digestive problem and i stumbled with it for about five or six years and the doctors they
[1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:26.560]  tried every test nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when i kept hearing you and
[1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:30.640]  dr group and those commercials i said you know what i'm gonna get me some of that freaking living
[1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:34.560]  defense now i wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have it but i
[1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:40.480]  ordered it had it shipped to me i got it i hid it from the nurses i started taking it man that stuff
[1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:45.280]  changed my life it saved my life if there's any veteran out there i don't give you travel though
[1:16:45.280 --> 1:16:51.200]  anybody's traveled overseas you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living
[1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:56.400]  defense it's true folks we don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality and living defense
[1:16:56.400 --> 1:17:01.920]  is over the top good we always promote being prepared having firearms knowing how to use them
[1:17:01.920 --> 1:17:06.240]  and be self-sufficient and learn how to hunt and learn how to garden i mean it's just it's what
[1:17:06.240 --> 1:17:10.800]  we're meant to do it feels good when we do it but we do sell high-quality swarble food i told my
[1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:14.640]  patriot a month ago i said what can you handle i said i think it's gonna be really big and they said
[1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:18.000]  we can handle probably this we're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:21.040]  forward to be able to fund and i said no i think this is gonna be huge i think you should spend
[1:17:21.040 --> 1:17:24.560]  everything you have coming in to secure more food even though the prices are going up for you so
[1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:28.720]  those are the types of questions we have i'm just giving the inside base of all of us this is a hundred
[1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:34.080]  times regular volume plus was a hundred times a few days ago now it's about 200 times okay an
[1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:38.880]  info war store dot com you go right in the queue first come first serve but the fact that the orders

[1:20:38.720 --> 1:20:50.640]  and this is a special saturday emergency transmission a national emergency has been
[1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:58.000]  announced it is march 14 2020 only 233 days out from this historic election again i am your host
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:04.080]  alex jones well ted newton is our special guest and he was on fire yesterday when i talked to him
[1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:09.200]  over the phone i'm pretty much in agreement with him about the hysteria concerning this
[1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:14.080]  corona virus since when did the land of the free home of the brave just run an abject complete
[1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:19.440]  panic but the left has come out and attacked the president for not doing enough so when he did stop
[1:21:19.440 --> 1:21:23.440]  flights from china four weeks ago they attacked that now when he talks about controlling the
[1:21:23.440 --> 1:21:29.520]  borders they're trying to block him and trying to stop the restrictions on flights that have not been
[1:21:29.520 --> 1:21:35.600]  screened for those that are sick from europe it's just amazing how they are contradicting themselves
[1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:40.400]  and openly hoping they can bring down the president earlier i talked about this article out of the
[1:21:40.400 --> 1:21:46.720]  atlantic monthly where they're salivating saying the trump presidency is over corona virus is all
[1:21:46.720 --> 1:21:52.560]  his fault so they're going to use this crisis as much as they can to blame president trump and
[1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:57.280]  to destabilize the country as they've been doing mexico is considering closing its border to stop
[1:21:57.280 --> 1:22:03.280]  americans bring corona virus into the country as the cases mount past 2000 so mexico can close
[1:22:03.280 --> 1:22:09.280]  its border but we can't the left says so the motor city madman joins us on this special saturday
[1:22:09.280 --> 1:22:14.000]  edition ted thanks for coming on with us my pleasure alex i'm always ready willing to enable
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:19.840]  cockplot and ready to rock doc as they say to celebrate truth logic and common sense and i
[1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:24.320]  think the most important thing about this and you're right you're damn right this is a special
[1:22:24.320 --> 1:22:30.800]  alex jones broadcast because my name is ted newton full-time i am the motor city madman there's not
[1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:36.400]  a damn thing you can do about that and let me just bring the most important element that exists
[1:22:36.400 --> 1:22:43.680]  and remember i not only wrote wango tango i meant it but stop and think i am the craziest most intense
[1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:51.360]  high energy defiant you know rocket roller in the history of noise but let me bring the most
[1:22:51.360 --> 1:23:00.800]  important thing to the forefront the newton family remains calm we're not stockpiling any
[1:23:00.800 --> 1:23:07.840]  different than we haven't since the 1970s um i spent my morning with the dogs i uh shot about
[1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:15.840]  20 arrows from my math use bows so that's the spirit of tranquility calmness and again truth
[1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:22.160]  logic and common sense let me tell you alex what i'm bringing to your radio show this morning and
[1:23:22.160 --> 1:23:28.160]  you can rebroadcast it at will because the most important element of this whole hysteria
[1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:36.640]  circling around the coronavirus covid-19 insanity is that and i'm not alone by the way i've been
[1:23:36.640 --> 1:23:41.840]  talking to my band and my crew and my management and my brothers and my sisters my sons my daughters
[1:23:41.840 --> 1:23:48.400]  my grandkids this morning my wife shaman is at my side here she has a new book about quality of life
[1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:59.680]  about health and happiness i gotta tell you zero hysteria in the newton family zero hysteria in all
[1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:07.760]  the people i'm associated with you know conscientious rational um thoughtful always prepared we're not
[1:24:07.760 --> 1:24:15.520]  the last boy scouts but we're the real boy scouts alex when i i did 350 concerts a year in the late
[1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:23.840]  60s and early 70s and i i i i never went to college i was too busy learning stuff so the most
[1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:31.040]  important thing i learned from my dad who was a us army cavalry drill sergeant it was to always be
[1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:38.960]  prepared you didn't buy enough ammo for the weekend shooting you bought enough ammo just in case at
[1:24:38.960 --> 1:24:47.440]  this point in in march of 2020 nobody in the newton family is buying toilet paper we're not
[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:57.280]  buying water we're not buying ammo or guns we've had adequate supplies since about 1968 so the most
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:03.360]  important thing we can convey and we will get into the horrors the criminality the the glaring
[1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:09.520]  corruption and abuse of power that has run amok especially throughout past administrations and
[1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:17.040]  let me let me go from the ultra calming to the ultra condemning as we are thoughtful in our daily
[1:25:17.040 --> 1:25:23.360]  lives when again i i suspect that my buddy alex jones is the same way you don't stockpile toilet
[1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:30.800]  paper when you're running out yeah you stockpile essentials so you don't run out now let's go to
[1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:37.760]  the horror of horrors and yes we pray for our fellow americans and people around the world
[1:25:37.760 --> 1:25:48.880]  that are sick alex and in the the current flu season 22 000 americans have died from flu at
[1:25:48.880 --> 1:26:01.760]  least hysteria zero 350 000 people during this flu season were hospitalized hysteria and toilet
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:09.040]  paper stockpiling zero but i'm going to go right to the core of the criminality that brought this
[1:26:09.040 --> 1:26:15.600]  about that was my next question what has triggered well the big corporations big tech hollywood china
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:20.080]  the authoritarian set the model of welding citizens into their homes shooting women in the head at
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:27.600]  checkpoint drones barking orders to people mass graves burning bodies they created this hysteria
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:32.480]  to hurt the u.s economy and to blame president trump i said that six weeks ago and now they're
[1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:39.440]  following that and saying it's all trumps fault i'm uh i'm a repeat offender when it comes to
[1:26:39.440 --> 1:26:44.080]  truth logic and common sense i will say to you alex jones and everyone listening what ted
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:49.120]  newton said to you many many years ago when we first talked you know who brought all this about
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:55.920]  you know who brought about the glaring criminality of hillary clinton and a james comey you know who
[1:26:55.920 --> 1:27:04.480]  allowed a communist and a jihad worshiper like brennan to lead the cia those guys are are definitely
[1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:11.440]  traders and punks and criminals but you know who allowed it we the people of the united states of
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:20.960]  america who didn't monitor our elected employees conduct and and and living up to their oath of
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:29.040]  office to the u.s constitution how dare an american citizen not monitor their elected employees to
[1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:37.200]  the point where they actually put the production and distribution and access to american families
[1:27:37.200 --> 1:27:47.120]  medicine and antibiotics in the hands of the chinese alex are you kidding oh absolutely you've
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:52.480]  harped on that so far i'm so glad to carlson's all over it that most of our drugs come from china
[1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:58.240]  and they're on record tainted and the communist chinese are bragging that they're making a windfall

[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:26.400]  i have stacks of news articles just like today uk team find under house arrest for asking trans
[1:31:26.400 --> 1:31:33.520]  police officers gender and it hurt their feelings uk mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman
[1:31:33.520 --> 1:31:40.880]  ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty
[1:31:40.880 --> 1:31:46.480]  that's the thought police if a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason you get
[1:31:46.480 --> 1:31:52.640]  fined and you go to jail this is tyranny these people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil
[1:31:52.640 --> 1:31:58.800]  and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover resist it speak out against it if you understand
[1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:05.680]  why the globalist why the servants of satan hate info wars it's because we're awake we're alive
[1:32:05.680 --> 1:32:12.480]  we're passionate and we're not giving up that's why it's critical for those of us that are aware
[1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:17.760]  of the new world order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and
[1:32:17.760 --> 1:32:24.320]  they lie about us that's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags the globalists
[1:32:24.320 --> 1:32:29.520]  have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves
[1:32:29.520 --> 1:32:35.120]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent
[1:32:35.120 --> 1:32:42.560]  it is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheep dogs to stand firm
[1:32:42.560 --> 1:32:49.440]  and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake they fear the fact that we are
[1:32:49.440 --> 1:32:56.960]  alive they fear the fact that we love god and that's all we ever have to know is that god is in charge
[1:32:56.960 --> 1:33:03.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:11.280 --> 1:33:21.200]  i've cnn msnbc abc cbc how do you cut how do these traders in the media constantly
[1:33:21.200 --> 1:33:28.480]  reference the chinese virus that's their words the wuhan coronavirus and now you're supposed to
[1:33:28.480 --> 1:33:34.560]  say covid 19 and it's and it's america's fault and then the next week they condemn the president
[1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:40.880]  for cutting off travel from china the the endemic and calling it a foreign virus they call that
[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:46.880]  racist and then they call it racism they're they're condemning people as being racist by the way
[1:33:46.880 --> 1:33:51.440]  they've always done this to me because i'm i guess i just have too much soul from detroit but
[1:33:51.440 --> 1:33:57.200]  then exactly that's all they got is lying they they're condemning all of us as racists if we use
[1:33:57.200 --> 1:34:04.960]  the words that they've been using for 60 days well that's what i was going to say is is again
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:08.080]  ted news and joins us here on the special saturday transmission we're going to re-ear this on the
[1:34:08.080 --> 1:34:16.000]  live sunday show coming up that they say trump's not doing enough and then and then and then he
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:21.360]  starts to begin to put controls in and they say no we're filing bills that you can't stop flights
[1:34:21.360 --> 1:34:27.840]  from these countries infested it's like there's no logic they're publicly waging war it's all
[1:34:27.840 --> 1:34:35.680]  oxymoronical whether the hypocrisy you know i'm 71 years clean and sober so my radars work pretty
[1:34:35.680 --> 1:34:43.280]  good when i see information i have reasonable amounts of historical evidence to either corroborate
[1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:51.680]  or dismiss the consistency of claims and dishonesty and lies and the hate from so much of the media
[1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:58.560]  and then pretty much every democrat out there i mean i can't believe that there is a human being
[1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:03.520]  in the united states of america an american citizen that is god knows there's too many
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:09.680]  non-american citizens in this country but to think that there is a party an absolute political
[1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:17.120]  party in the in the united states of america that even before covid-19 pandemic they were against
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:22.000]  securing our borders let me make it perfectly clear alex you and i know and everybody i know
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:30.800]  knows this to be self-evident truth if you are against securing the borders of america you qualify
[1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:37.600]  as the enemy of america only the enemy of a country would be against securing the borders
[1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:42.640]  in anybody well as you know going back thousands of years ago to roam or other countries militaries
[1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:47.360]  were established and borders were established to stop plagues from coming in that's one of the
[1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:52.800]  first reasons they created countries and let me bring another very toxic point up and of course
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:58.320]  in extreme times you have to be extremely honest and let's be extremely honest you know i hear all
[1:35:58.320 --> 1:36:06.400]  about uh all men are created equal well i i believe if you're in china and uh you believe
[1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:12.640]  that you know i i'm all for eating whatever meat you want my friends in african asia they eat dogs
[1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:17.360]  and cats and they eat all kinds of guts and all kinds of bile and stuff and have a nice day with
[1:36:17.360 --> 1:36:22.400]  that but in the country of china i hope your listeners know and we should do a detailed
[1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:27.760]  scrutiny and expose you tell me about last night where they eat live frogs and just well not just
[1:36:27.760 --> 1:36:35.040]  the live frogs but the guts the entire you know intestinal tract which again isn't smart that's
[1:36:35.040 --> 1:36:40.720]  all the bacteria everything being processed uh it's the crap well i hope your listeners know
[1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:47.200]  that there was an annual dog meat festival in china now i'm not condemning the use of dog meat
[1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:52.640]  a lot of people of our world rely on that source of protein and i i'm laying here with my beloved
[1:36:52.640 --> 1:36:59.760]  dogs i i i can you flight at the altar of canine saty is on my lap i have seen you personally
[1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:05.440]  spoil your dogs and i love you've met my dogs you know how much we love our chameleon i have a
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:10.800]  what do you call chameleon we have an unhealthy relationship with our dogs we love them so much
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:15.600]  so let's establish that there has never been a human that loves dogs more than i do but in china
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:21.200]  alex and our fellow listeners on the alex jones show not only do they have a dog meat festival
[1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:27.680]  in china but every year in the inner circle of the annual chinese dog meat festival there is an
[1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:34.800]  entire culture where they believe and they proceed and they they continue the horror
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:42.720]  that the more you torture the dog the more pain and suffering and howling and whining and crying
[1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:51.200]  you perpetrate upon that dog they actually believe the meat has medicinal qualities and is good for
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:38:00.400]  you stop and grasp the evil in that culture this is the same uh asian culture of the baton death
[1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:06.080]  march and the rape of nan king uh even though she was on the other foot at that time but
[1:38:06.080 --> 1:38:11.760]  i don't think your average american knows that of course there's going to be outrage not all
[1:38:11.760 --> 1:38:17.360]  cultures are equal and and if you expand on that i don't even know about this but it's been reported
[1:38:17.360 --> 1:38:23.840]  in law enforcement for like hundreds of years that satanists like to torture children so that
[1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:28.320]  then the hormones and the endorphins are released before they drink the blood that's a drug and i'd
[1:38:28.320 --> 1:38:34.560]  read about china torturing the dogs as well to then get the hormones into the meat of the pain
[1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:40.480]  and the suffering and that is so the point is a lot of weird sick stuff's going on in china well
[1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:44.720]  you know and you don't have to look to china i mean again i get in a lot of trouble all the time
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:49.680]  as you do which i believe that guys like us are exactly what the founding fathers had hoped and
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:57.120]  prayed that all americans would be like i think a real american has to be a hell racer a real
[1:38:57.120 --> 1:39:04.560]  patriotic real constitutional american has to constantly demand constitutional accountability
[1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:11.360]  from our elected employees and constantly spotlight cockroaches and constantly be suspicious of the
[1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:16.080]  media abusing their first amendment rights while they try to take away our second amendment rights
[1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:22.640]  but let's get right down to the core of eastland america when you've got a hillary clinton that has
[1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:29.440]  as much power as she does and by the way she was supposed to be subpoenaed and have to testify under
[1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:35.360]  oath in this time zone when all of a sudden covid-19 erupted i'll let everybody contemplate that
[1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:41.200]  i'm sure you've dealt into that but stop and think hillary clinton she was mentored by
[1:39:41.200 --> 1:39:49.120]  saula linsky the author of rules for radicals whose book is dedicated to satan i'm not making this
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:54.720]  up anybody who's been paying attention knows that hillary clinton's hero was saula linsky
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:40:01.600]  and his book rules for radical which is basically the bible of the left including nancy polosi
[1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:07.920]  including beta aurora including chuck schumer all those democrats believe in saula linsky's
[1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:16.320]  rules for radicals a book that hillary clinton studied under that was dedicated to satan the
[1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:21.520]  great manipulator you're absolutely right right there on page two he says that this is dedicated
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:29.280]  to lucifer the original revolutionary so i'd be americans again i'm going to go right back and this
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:37.520]  is where i piss people off and ask me if i give a damn apathy is way worse than liberalism apathy
[1:40:37.520 --> 1:40:44.880]  is way worse than covid-19 apathy is way worse than communism because it allows a bernie sam
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:52.000]  sanders to flourish apathy is worse than the corruption and the criminal abuse of power
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:41:00.080]  of a joe biden and his son hunter biden because americans were so disconnected and uninvolved
[1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:07.760]  that they let these monsters attain so much control thank god president donald trump
[1:41:07.760 --> 1:41:13.360]  has spotlighted these cockroaches and has actually admitted that there is a deep state
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:19.200]  and the swamp has to be drained i gotta tell you alex the newton family prays for this great
[1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:25.360]  president every day because he has taken on a task that is more important than anything since concord
[1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:30.880]  bridge i totally agree with you in the time we have left here i want to read you a few of these
[1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:35.120]  headlines this is again out of the atlantic that's the leftist mouthpiece as you know
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:39.040]  from the establishments this is what they were thinking the trump presidency is over it has
[1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:44.080]  taken a good deal longer than it should have but americans have now seen the con man behind the curtain
[1:41:44.080 --> 1:41:51.920]  they go on to blame uh the wuhan virus on president trump to me that's just absolutely amazing
[1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:57.600]  meanwhile google funded tech chief resigns for wishing trump died from the corona virus they're
[1:41:57.600 --> 1:42:04.400]  all hoping that he secretly has that while the communist party officially blames it as a u.s
[1:42:04.400 --> 1:42:12.080]  bio weapon with no proof uh what do you make of that ted newton well all we have to do is
[1:42:12.080 --> 1:42:18.720]  i gotta tell you i know president donald trump and his family he's a clever guy um i think we've
[1:42:18.720 --> 1:42:25.600]  talked before alex that if your child is dying and the only way to get to the island with medicine
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:33.040]  is on your enemy's ship you would get on your enemy's ship take the medicine to save your child's life
[1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:42.240]  and then kill your enemy yes boy that's that's extreme isn't it but you do it it's like the choice of
[1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:47.520]  going to going about your daily life unarmed and helpless so maybe you can join all the other victims
[1:42:47.520 --> 1:42:52.720]  of being unarmed and helpless unarmed and helpless is a choice if you're unarmed and helpless here's
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:57.920]  a here's an alert from the motor city madman you are unarmed and helpless have a nice day

[1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:28.480]  alex this is like me hiring you know john wane gasey to watch my children this is
[1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:35.040]  bizarre oh in decent criminal corruption and why so that they could they could enrich their
[1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:41.920]  individual lives both monetarily and politically that kind of deep swamp deep state swampage
[1:47:41.920 --> 1:47:47.120]  is now in the crosshairs of a great great president and a lot of republicans that i have more faith
[1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:52.080]  in today than i have in my 71 years celebrating the america you're right that's the good news is
[1:47:52.080 --> 1:47:57.200]  that their their pedophile rings their corruption the jeffrey eppstein stuff the sell out to russia
[1:47:57.200 --> 1:48:02.160]  and china the globalist positioning our country to be taken down by china all of that is behind
[1:48:02.160 --> 1:48:06.320]  the eight ball we've turned it around so they're trying to target those of us to tell the truth
[1:48:06.320 --> 1:48:09.760]  they're trying to lie about us trying to put us in jail they're trying to do all this stuff but it's
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:16.320]  not working because the people understand now and are awake america i think was asleep before
[1:48:16.320 --> 1:48:22.000]  extremely apathetic it's still somewhat groggy and half asleep but more and more people are
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:26.800]  waking up every day and the more people wake up and stop being apathetic and speak out and stand
[1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:32.400]  up for what's right the more the deep state corrupt leftists understand that their time has come to
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:37.840]  an end a lot of my friends ask me so what should i do ted well do what i've been doing since i was
[1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:43.040]  about 40 took me a long time i was apathetic because i was spoiled until the heroes of the
[1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:48.240]  military and law enforcement embraced me and i started spending time with them listening to how
[1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:55.840]  in 1979 the u.s. marine warriors were put on guard and security duty at the u.s. embassy in tehran
[1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:02.880]  but they weren't allowed to have ammo for their m16s stop and think about the rules of engagement
[1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:08.080]  that the heroes of our military have been subjected to where they couldn't return fire when they're
[1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:13.120]  being shot at so that's how the left constantly ties our hands let me ask you this you know you
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:18.000]  only have a few more minutes it's been great having you on um we only have 233 days out here
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:23.840]  from this historic election and trump's been working his ass off he's 73 years old uh he's
[1:49:23.840 --> 1:49:26.880]  one of the only people i know you know that's that's that's that's that's that age that has
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:31.040]  energy you're a few years his junior and think you have even more than him uh but but just
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:37.040]  what do we do to support trump what can we do to not be apathetic what are some of the actions
[1:49:37.040 --> 1:49:40.320]  people say okay i don't want to be apathetic well they can share this interview at band
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:44.160]  dot video they can share it to your facebook they can tell people about what's happening
[1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:48.240]  they can speak up they can run for office they can join a shooting club they can
[1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:54.640]  i mean what else can people do to not be apathetic well boy that's an entire program and we we should
[1:49:54.640 --> 1:49:59.360]  do that as soon as possible because we should be constantly communicating in all the different
[1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:06.240]  social media good old phone calls and letters and emails to our elected employees supporting this
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:11.360]  president and and and bullet pointing all the accomplishments i mean his accomplishments are
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:17.600]  unprecedented we need to constantly communicate with our elected employees that we believe in
[1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:23.040]  donald trump and we want to reelect him in fact i have a hat right now i'm sure you've seen it a
[1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:28.160]  guy made a smartass comment at one of my meetings last year's tour which by the way the 2020 tour
[1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:32.720]  will be the best tour of my life as long as they don't cancel the damn thing but what we can do
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:40.960]  is recruit and make sure people are registered to vote and communicate with our elected employees
[1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:45.760]  and i would tell you this to synopsize my instructions everybody should go to hunter
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:54.560]  nation dot org hunter nation dot org and if all the real conservatives god family country
[1:50:54.560 --> 1:50:59.120]  conservatives especially in the hunting community the second amendment community exactly not just
[1:50:59.120 --> 1:51:03.280]  make it the work of politics and fight in the left but the culture of hunting and fishing
[1:51:03.280 --> 1:51:07.840]  and and and trapping and and and camping and just getting back to rugged individualism we have to
[1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:12.000]  just induct people into that and they'll be addicted and then they'll get others involved
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:18.560]  the current demographic of licensed hunters in this country are the most apathetic of all we
[1:51:18.560 --> 1:51:24.640]  proved in in 2016 the top three hunting states in america mission wisconsin and pennsylvania
[1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:31.680]  and believe me this is irrefutable we finally crowbarred that demographic to get out register
[1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:38.080]  and vote in 2016 and it was those three top hunting states in america that made the difference
[1:51:38.080 --> 1:51:44.160]  so go to hunter nation dot org and we've got to get family friends co-workers people at church
[1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:50.480]  and school people at work we get at our hunting camps at the barbecue at the bowling alley you
[1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:56.960]  got to register to vote and you got to vote god family country which would be donald trump but go
[1:51:56.960 --> 1:52:02.800]  to hunter nation dot org and you'll see that the events that we're putting on all across this country
[1:52:02.800 --> 1:52:08.400]  to get real conservatives for god family country to register and vote and by the way get the
[1:52:08.400 --> 1:52:12.720]  bazillion president get that from you that the which is great because most of their form of
[1:52:12.720 --> 1:52:18.880]  flattery is imitation god family country i'm telling you that's the missing link it's the it's the
[1:52:18.880 --> 1:52:23.360]  epicenter of apathy in this country and what we're going to do is we're going to register
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:29.600]  conservatives and we're going to bake bioplea scald and parade if we have to maybe hit them
[1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:34.400]  upside the head with a crowbar but you've got to register and vote if you don't vote god family
[1:52:34.400 --> 1:52:40.880]  and country then the then there the satanists on the left will continue to destroy everything that
[1:52:40.880 --> 1:52:46.400]  is the last best place in the world and that's the united states of america case closed well

[1:52:58.560 --> 1:53:03.120]  president trump and uh trump is more popular than ever but they've got such election fraud they've
[1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:07.920]  got illegal aliens being registered all over the country to vote uh the democrats used to deny that
[1:53:07.920 --> 1:53:12.160]  now there's all the footage of them at the dmv's getting their licenses being able to vote i mean
[1:53:12.160 --> 1:53:17.360]  it's just absolute treason and now the democrats with the drag queen story times officially funded

[1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:26.320]  it because it's not just apathy people don't mind having their territory their freedom overrun and
[1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:29.520]  when people see a ted newton who's got a lot of energy and alex jones has a lot of energy they say
[1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:33.280]  these guys are crazy you know this is what everybody was like a hundred years ago folks
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:36.800]  and this is what america's all about it's not backing down and it's that spirit
[1:55:36.800 --> 1:55:40.400]  that the motor city madman ted newton is helping get out there the u the listeners
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:43.840]  reviewers helping get out there that has turned the tide and yeah they're trying to go after and
[1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:48.160]  punish those of us that have led the charge but that's okay but just stick with us because
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:52.160]  this is one hell of a flight we're gonna hang together or hang shepard as benjamin franklin said
[1:55:52.160 --> 1:55:57.120]  all right ted newton dot com ted thank you so much for spending time with us alex jones truth
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:56:03.600]  like it can common sense forever thank you so much sir godspeed man speaking of apathy this little
[1:56:03.600 --> 1:56:08.000]  clip from viva vendetta i think lays out what we're dealing with them we'll go to break and
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:16.880]  i'll come back and we'll look at how they're trying to put yours truly behind bars there are of course
[1:56:16.880 --> 1:56:21.840]  those who do not want us to speak we think just let me think even now orders are being
[1:56:21.840 --> 1:56:27.680]  shouted into telephones and men with guns will still be on their way it's chances that damn it why
[1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:34.000]  because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation words will always retain their
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:39.760]  power words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen the enunciation of the
[1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:45.520]  truth and the truth is there is something terribly wrong with this country isn't that you
[1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:50.880]  designed it sir you wanted it for a proof you taught me every television in longer cruelty and injustice
[1:56:50.880 --> 1:56:55.600]  intolerance and oppression and where once you had the freedom to object to something can speak as
[1:56:55.600 --> 1:57:00.880]  you saw fit you now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and
[1:57:00.880 --> 1:57:07.040]  selecting your submachine cameras how did this happen who's to blame well certainly there are
[1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:12.800]  those who are more responsible than others they will be held accountable but again truth be told
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:19.760]  if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror i know why you did it i know
[1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:26.560]  you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease there were a myriad of problems which
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:32.720]  inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense fear got the best of you
[1:57:32.720 --> 1:57:38.240]  and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor adam subtler he promised you border
[1:57:38.240 --> 1:57:43.200]  he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent obedient consent
[1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:52.080]  everybody needs food i'm proud we're selling high quality food elections globalism the economy
[1:57:52.080 --> 1:57:56.960]  the bubble this is something you need on your checklist to have done but for me it just is
[1:57:56.960 --> 1:58:02.480]  a bummer to know that everybody needs food and i had long discussions this morning over an hour
[1:58:02.480 --> 1:58:06.000]  long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this write down the folks
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:10.720]  run the plants to get the best idea we have but they want me to say six to eight weeks just so
[1:58:10.720 --> 1:58:16.000]  people aren't getting pissed but understand the last food company the biggest food company is now
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:20.960]  at hundreds of times their regular order and they were having discussions with me about stopping the
[1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:25.440]  promotion of food sales next week and at a certain point just saying we're done because people are
[1:58:25.440 --> 1:58:29.840]  going to take food orders out 10 weeks we don't want to sit on your money 10 weeks and then just
[1:58:29.840 --> 1:58:34.240]  all the weirdness that comes with that because we're honest under promise over deliver but technically
[1:58:34.240 --> 1:58:37.760]  it's going to be six to eight weeks and we want you to get a great deal and feel like we took
[1:58:37.760 --> 1:58:41.680]  care of you so you come back again we want relationships with you we're not satanists
