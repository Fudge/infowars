[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.240 --> 00:26.400]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome to the Alex Jones show
[00:26.400 --> 00:35.200]  on this Friday June 26 2015 this has been quite a week we've seen a lot of things happen this week
[00:35.200 --> 00:40.880]  we've seen the Trans-Pacific Partnership rammed through actually I keep correcting myself it's
[00:40.880 --> 00:45.280]  a fast track has been run through we need to remember that we don't say we've been talking
[00:45.280 --> 00:50.960]  so long about how fast track is going to be the implementation of these treaties and that's of
[00:50.960 --> 00:55.440]  course why they passed it to make it virtually impossible to stop them but it is not impossible
[00:55.440 --> 01:01.040]  to stop them and it is not impossible to undo things that have been done wrong our government
[01:01.040 --> 01:07.280]  has been taken over by corporations it has been taken over by globalists who are trying to create
[01:07.280 --> 01:14.160]  a global world order part of that is changing the culture we've seen a lot of that this week
[01:14.160 --> 01:20.480]  haven't we we've seen a witch hunt with the confederate flag and now today we've got the
[01:20.480 --> 01:27.440]  supreme court decision extending same-sex marriage nationwide i want to talk about that in the next
[01:27.440 --> 01:32.800]  segment when we've got more time i want to talk about the legal issues behind this because it is
[01:32.800 --> 01:37.760]  not a cut and dried situation one of the stories that's up today is the iris deleted backups of
[01:37.760 --> 01:44.160]  24 000 lowest learner emails months after a subpoena well you know that's interesting but
[01:44.160 --> 01:49.520]  we have seen the supreme court we have seen the department of justice we've seen government at
[01:49.520 --> 01:56.880]  every level for many many years deleting everything in the constitution everything in our legal
[01:56.880 --> 02:02.720]  tradition all of our due process just making this stuff up as they go along and of course that was
[02:02.720 --> 02:07.200]  one of the articles that we have up today obama care travesty the supreme court continues to
[02:07.200 --> 02:11.760]  make stuff up out of thin air that was the travesty from the supreme court yesterday
[02:11.760 --> 02:16.480]  just making stuff up about obama care we're going to talk about that and the bill from a texas
[02:16.480 --> 02:23.040]  congressman brian babin who is proposing that the supreme court be forced to enroll their staff
[02:23.040 --> 02:29.040]  in obama care if they're going to keep promoting it and of course that jessus glia called it
[02:29.040 --> 02:34.480]  scotus care supreme court of the us care if they're going to do that maybe they ought to own it we're
[02:34.480 --> 02:38.560]  going to talk about the exemptions that congress has given themselves of course about obama care
[02:38.560 --> 02:42.080]  remember they said we're going to have to pass it so we can find out what's in it when they found
[02:42.080 --> 02:49.120]  out they were in it they exempted themselves in some very unusual legal maneuverings we're also
[02:49.120 --> 02:53.520]  going to have on this show today we're going to have barba loe fischer she's president of the
[02:53.520 --> 02:57.840]  national vaccine information center we're going to talk to her about the situation in california
[02:57.840 --> 03:03.680]  and of course the situation nationally because they're trying to hold a gun to our head and force us
[03:03.680 --> 03:07.680]  to take vaccines let me read the statement to you from barba loe fischer she said if the state can
[03:07.680 --> 03:13.680]  tag track down and force citizens against their will to be injected with biologicals of known and
[03:13.680 --> 03:20.880]  unknown toxicity today there will be no limit on which individual freedoms the state can take away
[03:20.880 --> 03:27.920]  in the name of the greater good tomorrow we see that on a daily basis don't we we see secret laws
[03:27.920 --> 03:37.280]  secret trade treaties we see congress abdicating its power turning it over to a transnational committee
[03:37.280 --> 03:41.120]  that is going to write rules that are not just going to regulate trade it's going to regulate
[03:41.120 --> 03:48.000]  the internet it may even regulate arms because that's been the fact that the obama administration
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.320]  has been taking from the very beginning they've gone after two things they've gone after ammunition
[03:52.320 --> 03:57.760]  and they have gone after the flow of arms across borders because if you're going to control the
[03:57.760 --> 04:03.520]  flow of arms across borders that means that you have to totally control them within the borders
[04:03.520 --> 04:10.000]  if they're not tagged and tracked just like us because ultimately gun control is people control
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.320]  but if your guns are not tagged and tracked then they could easily flow over the border so that's
[04:16.320 --> 04:20.800]  been their tack for a very long time that's where they're coming from we're going to talk about
[04:20.800 --> 04:29.840]  the situation in tunisia as well this is a overflow of what happened in libya and i think beyond
[04:29.840 --> 04:35.280]  just getting scared about the violence and about this organization isis that our government continues
[04:35.280 --> 04:40.160]  to fund equip and send monthly paychecks to we're going to talk to paul joseph what's
[04:40.160 --> 04:45.280]  about that at the bottom of the hour besides all of that we need to understand how libya got into
[04:45.280 --> 04:50.400]  a state of chaos and also joining us today is going to be mark dies we're going to talk about
[04:50.400 --> 04:54.240]  several of his videos it should be very entertaining stay with us we'll be right back
[04:54.240 --> 05:03.600]  Joe Biggs here with info wars dot com now a lot of people are saying that they want to ban the
[05:03.600 --> 05:08.080]  confederate flag it seems because of what it represented this is the thing though where will
[05:08.080 --> 05:13.760]  it stop there has been more slavery under the current flag that we have than that of the confederate
[05:13.760 --> 05:19.280]  flag what a lot of people forget is that we have to learn from our past we cannot erase what has
[05:19.280 --> 05:24.880]  happened by banning flags and taking everything down that reminds us of a bad past remember
[05:24.880 --> 05:30.080]  those who forget their past are doomed to repeat it all over again we need our past however bad
[05:30.080 --> 05:35.040]  it may be to some of us so we can learn from those mistakes a racing history sets us up to repeat
[05:35.040 --> 05:40.080]  those same mistakes over and over again now is understandable that a lot of people see this as
[05:40.080 --> 05:46.720]  a flag that is racist and things like that but when you have places like amazon google now banning
[05:46.720 --> 05:52.160]  the cells of confederate memorabilia that's when you kind of cross the line no we have to keep this
[05:52.160 --> 05:58.720]  stuff out there so it is a reminder to never do that again this is joe biggs of info wars dot com
[05:58.720 --> 06:04.400]  when cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in no one has put together a formula that

[08:28.960 --> 08:33.120]  in studio alex jones is going to be joining us in just a couple of minutes i'm sure he wants to
[08:33.120 --> 08:38.240]  weigh in on this decision by the supreme court this has been an amazing week this week you know in
[08:38.240 --> 08:44.800]  the disguise of tolerance we've seen history flush down the memory hole like something out of 1984
[08:44.800 --> 08:50.800]  and then the next day we see that they're going to coerce us into celebrating practices that many
[08:50.800 --> 08:57.120]  people feel violate their religious beliefs but that's the essence of this that's the essence
[08:57.120 --> 09:03.440]  of political correctness is the intolerance of people in the name of tolerance but there's also
[09:03.440 --> 09:08.560]  a legal side of this now what happened today well alex is joining us right now let's let alex
[09:08.560 --> 09:14.240]  talk about his take on this go ahead alex absolutely david i'm going to be filing reports
[09:14.240 --> 09:21.120]  from detroit here today i'm up here for a wedding you'll be doing a great job on sunday
[09:21.120 --> 09:27.760]  but i will be filing reports uh not just from detroit but from the western side of michigan
[09:27.760 --> 09:31.520]  later today where the wedding's actually happening tomorrow but i've flown to detroit
[09:31.520 --> 09:35.200]  just letting folks know why i'm up here but i'm going to segue off and do some reports
[09:35.920 --> 09:42.720]  on the design nap to get in a u decimation of our industrial sectors something of foreign
[09:42.720 --> 09:48.240]  military power couldn't do via these internal tariffs that are nap to and get designed to
[09:48.240 --> 09:54.640]  transfer our industrial capacity to china and in mexico part of the global estate and trilateral
[09:54.640 --> 10:00.000]  plan but absolutely you're spot on when i was calling in about uh and it's the two supreme
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.200]  court rulings the last two days obama care is totally unconstitutional on its face uh it is
[10:07.200 --> 10:12.080]  completely discriminatory totally fraudulent meant to enrich the insurance companies and
[10:12.080 --> 10:18.640]  they're going to continue over and over again to uh uphold it because it's what the establishment want
[10:19.280 --> 10:22.800]  and it's the same thing with the whole gay marriage situation let's just get past all that
[10:24.080 --> 10:30.480]  depoliticize it it's a state issue there's no way the federal government could rule on
[10:30.480 --> 10:37.280]  something like that nationwide so this is all part of the imperial federal government but
[10:37.280 --> 10:44.160]  forget the imperial federal government it now is a legged or a viceroy to the globalist which are
[10:44.160 --> 10:50.240]  offshore with the tpp and the rest of it so here's the main point to take away from all of this
[10:51.120 --> 10:55.360]  the globalists have dropped the hammer not just here but across the globe they're accelerating
[10:55.360 --> 11:01.760]  their programs they're engaging in to divide and conquer manipulations scientifically deployed
[11:01.760 --> 11:10.880]  uh but if people just wake up to the overall manipulation basically it will only uh make
[11:10.880 --> 11:15.200]  people uh resist what's happening but you've got to get them out of the trance you've got to get
[11:15.200 --> 11:19.760]  them out of the money that's why the population split into two groups really people that are
[11:19.760 --> 11:25.600]  awake and know what's going on and people that are in a trance and buy as as mother's milk uh
[11:25.600 --> 11:31.520]  everything the government major corporations say uh this is just an unprecedented time to be
[11:31.520 --> 11:39.680]  alive and it's a very important time obviously uh to be alive because history is being set right
[11:39.680 --> 11:46.560]  now and folks need to understand the globalist program is behind schedule about 10 years most
[11:46.560 --> 11:52.400]  experts agree about 10 to 15 years depending on which program and their program is in trouble
[11:52.400 --> 11:59.360]  everywhere systemically and so they're accelerating the program which they may win the race but
[11:59.360 --> 12:04.720]  they're going to lose the overall uh season of races here because they're going to blow their engine
[12:05.440 --> 12:11.440]  they are going all out right now with their afterburners uh and you if we just develop a
[12:11.440 --> 12:16.160]  culture of freedom a culture that's based on sovereignty a culture that's based on basic
[12:16.160 --> 12:22.640]  human freedom and private property and what's in our bill of rights well that will be the culture
[12:23.280 --> 12:28.960]  that will basically supplant this failed fallen culture that's why it's so totalitarian
[12:28.960 --> 12:34.320]  that's so autocratic is because it has to be and that's why it obsesses on discrimination
[12:34.880 --> 12:39.600]  and people being wronged so people can be obsessed with false things they're being wronged about
[12:39.600 --> 12:45.200]  and not the overall total enslavement at a technocratic technotronic level but i'm going to
[12:45.200 --> 12:49.760]  throw it back to you David Knight a great job crew great job listeners people are waking up
[12:49.760 --> 12:56.480]  across the world we need to realize how legendary and how serious this fight is and how important
[12:56.480 --> 13:03.040]  a place of human development we all have this is a epic historical battle i am so honored
[13:03.040 --> 13:08.080]  is this the exit right here sorry i'm driving on the highway this other uh the industrialized area
[13:08.800 --> 13:15.520]  and it just comes down to that we have to understand our place in history yes things are
[13:15.520 --> 13:21.440]  bad yes it's demoralizing yes we get sad sometimes but by resisting it our spirits become stronger
[13:21.440 --> 13:27.200]  this is the animating contest of liberty and they want to erase the american culture because it's
[13:27.200 --> 13:32.720]  not perfect but compared to every other culture it was dynamic it was special it was the flower
[13:32.720 --> 13:36.960]  as i've said a thousand times the Renaissance Thomas Jefferson was probably the greatest
[13:36.960 --> 13:43.040]  expression of the Renaissance but washington refusing to be king uh was the greatest expression
[13:43.040 --> 13:48.720]  of a true warrior poet i mean we've reached just an amazing time where the enemy want to pull these
[13:48.720 --> 13:55.200]  people down because it is coffin nails to them and their entire agenda so i'm going to hand it back
[13:55.200 --> 14:00.560]  to you David Knight and all the powerful guest paul watson coming up uh and everyone else today
[14:00.560 --> 14:05.360]  but i salute our reporters i salute everyone involved in the fight against the globalist
[14:05.360 --> 14:10.800]  that's why i never want to be thanked it is totally humbling to be associated with all of
[14:10.800 --> 14:15.120]  you the incredible crew the people behind the scenes world government's now out in the open
[14:15.120 --> 14:20.560]  the pope's called for it world tyranny is now here the battle lines are drawn choose which side
[14:20.560 --> 14:25.280]  you're on folks that's what it comes down to this is the rise of the ai state that will follow the
[14:25.280 --> 14:30.560]  orders of the technotronic rulers this is an incredible time to be alive yes it's frightening
[14:30.560 --> 14:36.400]  it's but it's it's animating i mean history's always been frightening it's always been full
[14:36.400 --> 14:43.520]  of beauty and also evil and corruption but also honor and so this is what separates the boys from
[14:43.520 --> 14:49.920]  the men this is it god bless you all info wars dot com is the front lines of the fight thank you
[14:49.920 --> 14:55.600]  alex that's alex jones on the road i'm david night in studio we have a packed show today
[14:55.600 --> 14:59.360]  we're going to have paul joseph watson joining us at the bottom of the hour to talk about the
[14:59.360 --> 15:06.800]  this beheading and explosion uh in tunisia we also have barbara low fisher going to be joining
[15:06.800 --> 15:11.680]  us uh she's going to be talking about the situation about mandatory vaccines of course we have
[15:11.680 --> 15:18.160]  mandatory everything anymore don't we yesterday was mandatory uh health care day i guess we saw
[15:18.160 --> 15:24.400]  it was portrayed as subsidies but you have to ask yourself who's being subsidized here yes there are
[15:24.400 --> 15:30.400]  there's an insurance is being given to some people but the major subsidy is not to the individuals
[15:30.400 --> 15:36.240]  the major subsidy is to the big insurance corporations they're the ones who are defining
[15:36.240 --> 15:41.360]  what you have to buy in many cases it's far more than you need far more than you can use
[15:41.360 --> 15:47.360]  there's cases of them requiring single men to have pregnancy coverage that type of thing so
[15:47.360 --> 15:51.920]  you're not allowed to choose what level of insurance to buy they tell you and then they set the price
[15:51.920 --> 15:56.560]  and then they get a subsidy for that insurance from the government so don't tell me that they're
[15:56.560 --> 16:00.960]  subsidizing individuals they are subsidizing big insurance that's what this has been about from the
[16:00.960 --> 16:04.880]  very beginning but what we saw in the decision yesterday and what we see in the supreme court
[16:04.880 --> 16:13.920]  decision today is an absolute just rejection of the rule of law a rejection of the written word
[16:13.920 --> 16:18.000]  and we're going to talk about that first i want to give you an idea of who's on the show today as
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.320]  i said barbara low fisher co-founder of the national vaccine information center she's going
[16:22.320 --> 16:28.480]  to be joining us later in the show as well as mark dice and before i get into the supreme court
[16:28.480 --> 16:33.200]  thing i want to let you know that this hour the alex joneshow is made possible by the high quality
[16:33.200 --> 16:39.920]  products that we sell at info wars life calm dot com and of course products like survival shield x2
[16:39.920 --> 16:46.720]  nascent iodine we've got over 400 reviews on info wars life dot com of this product alone over 99%
[16:46.720 --> 16:52.240]  of the respondents would recommend it to friend or family members we've been blown away by this
[16:52.240 --> 16:56.480]  response i want to read you a couple of these reviews we've been reading these a couple of
[16:56.480 --> 17:02.320]  for a couple of days this is from trixie and akron ohio she says i rarely write product reviews
[17:02.320 --> 17:06.960]  but i had to give my opinion on x2 after just two and a half weeks i've already lost weight lost the
[17:06.960 --> 17:12.560]  brain fog i've had for years and have increased energy i've suffered from an underactive thyroid
[17:12.560 --> 17:18.000]  for years was searching for a natural iodine supplement that actually worked x2 is it i've
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.880]  already started recommending this product to my family and friends then another from alora in
[17:22.880 --> 17:27.520]  wisconsin she says love using the iodine i can always tell the days i go without it but it helps
[17:27.520 --> 17:34.000]  me focus and i feel i'm more aware you know i think it's always important to get uh i i like
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.560]  liquid supplements like uh we sell with this because they're so effective you when you put
[17:38.560 --> 17:44.560]  something uh in liquid form you take it sublingually you you swallow it you'd have to worry if this
[17:44.560 --> 17:50.880]  thing is going to dissolve and um and dissipate throughout your system i think it's very effective
[17:50.880 --> 17:54.800]  do that that's why i like to get the products most of the products that we sell are in liquid form
[17:54.800 --> 17:58.880]  course you know you can get uh the supplements that are high quality that are not in liquid form
[17:58.880 --> 18:03.920]  some things don't lend themselves to that but that's the kind of quality that we try to put
[18:03.920 --> 18:08.560]  in the products at info wars life dot com and of course you can get that right now you can read
[18:08.560 --> 18:14.800]  the reviews at info wars life dot com and getting back to this supreme court situation again yesterday
[18:15.440 --> 18:22.400]  we were amazed at what the supreme court had said about obama care it was talking about state
[18:22.400 --> 18:26.800]  subsidies and the rationale that they were putting out there was well you know we don't really want
[18:26.800 --> 18:31.680]  to go through the legislative process to have them redefine the law so let's just redefine it
[18:31.680 --> 18:38.400]  let's just rewrite it and scalia said you're just making this up a supreme court justice
[18:38.400 --> 18:43.440]  said that of his colleagues you know we're just rewriting this the words don't mean anything
[18:43.440 --> 18:48.480]  i talked yesterday to michael snider and uh we were just amazed at that of course he has a legal
[18:48.480 --> 18:53.360]  background he writes for us a lot at info wars dot com we have a article up today talking about
[18:53.360 --> 18:57.360]  that uh talking about the conversation we had he says obama care travesty the supreme court
[18:57.360 --> 19:03.920]  continues to make stuff up out of thin air well of course that was yesterday today we have another
[19:03.920 --> 19:07.760]  thing that they have made up out of thin air i think it's interesting though before we move to
[19:07.760 --> 19:13.840]  the marriage decision to see the reaction from a uh texas republican sent a representative
[19:13.840 --> 19:18.960]  brian babin from texas house republican on thursday proposed forcing the supreme court
[19:18.960 --> 19:27.040]  justices and their staff to enroll in obama care and what he said was that um he said as a supreme
[19:27.040 --> 19:33.440]  court continues to ignore the letter of the law it's important these six individuals fully understand
[19:33.440 --> 19:38.880]  the impact of their decisions on the american people that's why i introduced the scotus care act
[19:38.880 --> 19:45.520]  to require the supreme court and all of its employees to sign up for obama care congress has
[19:46.320 --> 19:51.040]  had them found themselves in obama care when they passed it and found out what was in it
[19:51.040 --> 19:55.680]  they didn't like being in there so they gave themselves an exemption but then it got even
[19:55.680 --> 20:01.360]  stranger and i'm gonna tell you about that when we come back it's time to build your own emergency

[24:19.520 --> 24:24.240]  next segment by paul joseph watson from the uk we're going to talk about the events of today
[24:24.800 --> 24:30.560]  in tenizia and paul's article the background to it uh jihadists attack a french gas factory
[24:31.120 --> 24:35.600]  we had a victim there so we're going to talk to paul about that the next segment this segment i
[24:35.600 --> 24:40.400]  want to talk about this supreme court decision today yesterday we had an insane decision about
[24:40.400 --> 24:45.280]  obama care where they really couldn't care less about what the law says i think this one is along
[24:45.280 --> 24:51.680]  the same lines doing what they wish without regard to the law and i'm not the only one
[24:51.680 --> 24:56.640]  saying that of course it was scalia saying that yesterday about their decision for obama care
[24:56.640 --> 25:04.160]  today we had a five four decision justice anthony kennedy joined the court's four more liberal
[25:04.160 --> 25:12.960]  justices to say that essentially marriage is a right and that they have the authority to define
[25:12.960 --> 25:19.680]  marriage in washington i don't see that in the constitution we're going to talk about their
[25:19.680 --> 25:24.400]  their decision first of all here here's some of their argumentation they say the history of marriage
[25:24.400 --> 25:29.440]  as a union between two persons of the opposite sex marks the beginnings of these cases and
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.680]  when i started reading this i thought well you know maybe that's part of the problem i mean the
[25:33.680 --> 25:39.280]  first problem is we look at rights our original view of rights the view of rights that we saw
[25:39.280 --> 25:44.320]  in the declaration of independence the view of rights we saw in the constitution was an idea
[25:44.320 --> 25:48.000]  that it was something that we all possessed as individuals it was something that we inherited
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.600]  from god we were given that from god and the primary thrust was we had to stop government
[25:53.600 --> 26:00.480]  from taking those rights from infringing on those rights and so that was what the bill of
[26:00.480 --> 26:04.560]  rights was about it was about government you can't do this you can't do that you can't do this other
[26:04.560 --> 26:07.840]  thing and one of the things that they summed it up with of course in the ninth and tenth amendment
[26:07.840 --> 26:14.560]  they said if we haven't explicitly given you these powers you cannot imply them but of course
[26:14.560 --> 26:20.800]  everything the government does today is implied power not expressly given to them they go on
[26:20.800 --> 26:27.040]  to talk about how this is a changed understanding of marriage and its characteristic of a nation
[26:27.040 --> 26:32.240]  where new dimensions of freedom are becoming apparent to new generations well going back
[26:32.240 --> 26:37.760]  to that first statement where they talk about the purpose of marriage and looking at it between
[26:37.760 --> 26:45.520]  same sex or opposite sex throughout history marriage's purpose was to procreate to have
[26:45.520 --> 26:50.000]  children to have a family that's why even in ancient Greece where homosexuality was very
[26:50.000 --> 26:56.160]  prevalent very common they did not have homosexual marriage marriage was for a family that among
[26:56.160 --> 27:01.840]  other things of course Christians also understand it from a religious perspective that is one of
[27:01.840 --> 27:07.200]  the reasons why it has been between opposite sex members this is something that's come on us very
[27:07.200 --> 27:15.120]  quickly you know it was in the at one point I went back and I looked at a large dictionary that I have
[27:15.120 --> 27:22.000]  a it's from the 1950s and for those of you who are on radio I would say it's at least
[27:22.000 --> 27:29.280]  eight inches tall it's got over 600,000 words in it and I wanted to see how they defined
[27:29.280 --> 27:33.920]  marriage I wanted to see how they defined you know gay and homosexual I knew that gay had been
[27:33.920 --> 27:39.280]  something that had been brought in in the 1970s you know the word homosexual was not even a part
[27:39.280 --> 27:46.960]  of the giant unabridged Webster dictionary in the 1950s they quickly brought that in as a neutral
[27:46.960 --> 27:53.040]  then they changed it to a positive and the problem that I have with this from a perspective of a lot
[27:53.040 --> 27:57.600]  of Christians is not what people are doing I frankly don't care if you go and get married on the
[27:57.600 --> 28:01.760]  summer solstice in front of Stonehenge that's your business I don't care who you live with
[28:01.760 --> 28:07.200]  that's your business but when you force me to celebrate what you're doing and use the coercive
[28:07.200 --> 28:13.520]  power of government you've crossed the line you've crossed the line on so many different ways now
[28:14.240 --> 28:19.680]  this is what they're saying in the Supreme Court they say the 14th amendment requires
[28:19.680 --> 28:26.880]  a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex so I looked at the 14th amendment
[28:26.880 --> 28:30.240]  because I couldn't remember that being in the 14th amendment I didn't remember even there being
[28:30.240 --> 28:36.880]  anything about marriage you know the 14th amendment was done in 1866 to 1868 finally got ratified by
[28:36.880 --> 28:43.280]  the last date in 1868 when it went into effect it along with the 13th amendment were really responses
[28:43.280 --> 28:48.720]  to what had happened in the civil war it was the 13th amendment if you remember in 1865 that freed
[28:48.720 --> 28:54.160]  the slaves along the lines of discussion we had yesterday it wasn't Lincoln's emancipation proclamation
[28:54.160 --> 28:59.760]  that didn't free any slaves people who had slaves that were in states that were under federal
[28:59.760 --> 29:04.240]  control were explicitly excluded from Lincoln's emancipation proclamation so you had a lot of
[29:04.240 --> 29:11.920]  people who had slaves in those states like Missouri like Ulysses S Grant who kept his slaves until
[29:11.920 --> 29:17.520]  they were made illegal until that practice was made illegal in 1865 so that the slaves were freed
[29:17.520 --> 29:23.200]  by the 13th amendment the 14th amendment came along and said we're going to give them citizenship
[29:23.200 --> 29:28.160]  and here's what it says nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property
[29:28.160 --> 29:32.480]  without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection
[29:32.480 --> 29:36.880]  of the law wait a minute what's this about denying people due process and property how
[29:36.880 --> 29:43.440]  does that fit into civil asset forfeiture they conveniently ignore the parts of the constitution
[29:43.440 --> 29:48.240]  they don't want to pay attention to and they invent other parts we'll be right back with
[29:48.240 --> 29:59.040]  apology we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:59.040 --> 30:04.480]  hey daniels info wars dot com i came across some statistics from a gun control group which
[30:04.480 --> 30:10.720]  state that 12,558 people were killed after being shot last year now let's assume that's true but
[30:10.720 --> 30:16.480]  let's also compare them to other statistics such as the fact that guns prevent an estimated 2.5
[30:16.480 --> 30:23.200]  million crimes a year let's take 2.5 million and divide that by 12,558 what do we come up with
[30:23.200 --> 30:30.400]  199 in other words guns are used around 199 times more often to prevent crime than to kill
[30:30.400 --> 30:35.600]  even if we were to say double the number of people shot and killed last year to around 25
[30:35.600 --> 30:41.600]  thousand that would still mean that guns are used nearly 100 times more often to prevent crime
[30:41.600 --> 30:47.440]  regardless it's a huge number to say the least and to say that guns are used more often for good
[30:47.440 --> 30:53.280]  than bad is a complete understatement also be sure to subscribe to our new youtube channel which is

[33:30.640 --> 33:38.080]  tenizia on a hotel we've also had an attack on a gas factory in france um i guess it's the at that
[33:38.080 --> 33:43.040]  time of year there's a celebration going on and i guess that's the way some of these people interpret
[33:43.040 --> 33:48.560]  their religion uh to kill people over the ramadan holiday i know there's a lot of people who don't
[33:48.560 --> 33:53.520]  interpret it that way but there certainly appears to be uh people who are on the warpath these
[33:53.520 --> 33:58.000]  couple of days before i go to paul i'll let you know that this segment of the alex jones shows made
[33:58.000 --> 34:05.840]  possible by our made in 1776 clothing line if you're tired of getting stuff at the big box retailers

[34:43.680 --> 34:49.040]  clothing that can open the door to that kind of discussion so we have the belt buckles again

[35:24.720 --> 35:29.600]  literally on the war pass some of them uh uh some have called for this to happen during the
[35:29.600 --> 35:36.880]  ramadan holiday tell us about it well there's been three attacks obviously one in leon in france
[35:36.880 --> 35:44.480]  where two individuals basically drove into a gas company us owned gas company beheaded somebody
[35:44.480 --> 35:49.440]  basically stuck his decapitated head on a pole scrawled it with islamic writing
[35:50.240 --> 35:56.240]  then we've got a situation in tunisia where they massacred a bunch of people on a beach
[35:56.240 --> 36:02.960]  upwards of 27 28 people dead we've also got an attack on a mosque ishii mosque in q8
[36:03.760 --> 36:10.000]  last count was at least 11 dead so three major attacks you've also got islamic state militants
[36:10.000 --> 36:17.920]  in the syrian border town of ko barney going door to door massacring at least 120 people
[36:17.920 --> 36:23.040]  may be more so it's a day at bloodshed wow that's amazing and one of the articles that we've got
[36:23.040 --> 36:31.200]  up on info wars i com right now uh kurt nimo had a quote from hamed al adnami urging quote calamity
[36:31.200 --> 36:39.120]  for the infidels and an audio message and he tied it to ramadan your comments yeah basically what
[36:39.120 --> 36:44.480]  we've got is this constant debate which goes on after these kind of attacks between left and right
[36:45.040 --> 36:51.280]  where the left routinely say this has nothing to do with islam as a violent ideology it's all
[36:51.280 --> 36:56.880]  related to us foreign policy then we have people on the right saying no it's got nothing to do with
[36:56.880 --> 37:02.560]  us foreign policy it's all around it's all about islam being a violent ideology when it's clearly
[37:02.560 --> 37:08.080]  both and we can take it from both perspectives but they don't ever entertain the fact that it could
[37:08.080 --> 37:15.040]  both of those factors could be contributing to these attacks so cameron came out almost immediately
[37:15.040 --> 37:21.760]  after this attack in france and said islam is a religion of peace we hear this over and over again
[37:21.760 --> 37:26.720]  when clearly and as he said the vast majority of muslims are peaceful people they're never going to
[37:26.720 --> 37:32.960]  attack anybody but islam is not a religion of peace that's why it's the source foundation
[37:32.960 --> 37:38.960]  and inspiration for groups like isis because the quran contains over a hundred verses
[37:38.960 --> 37:46.960]  that directly or indirectly call on muslims to murder or go to war with non-believers that's
[37:46.960 --> 37:52.640]  the source of the bloodshed that's not a religion of peace and then we ask the question you know
[37:52.640 --> 37:59.520]  how many muslims actually support isis is it a tiny tiny minority that support this extremism
[37:59.520 --> 38:05.680]  as we're constantly told again no that's not the case you look at france where today's beheading
[38:05.680 --> 38:12.080]  took place they had a poll last year in august which found that one sixth of french citizens
[38:12.080 --> 38:20.640]  had a quote favorable view of isis and then a staggering 27 percent of people aged between
[38:20.640 --> 38:29.840]  18 and 24 in france french citizens sympathize with isis they had another poll aljazeera television
[38:29.840 --> 38:39.040]  channel aljazeera arabic 81 support what isis is doing in iraq and syria so to argue that this
[38:39.040 --> 38:45.680]  isn't a disturbing percentage of muslims who support isis is completely naive it's clear that
[38:45.680 --> 38:54.000]  a significant minority of muslims throughout the world do support isis but again and again after
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.840]  these attacks we have you know people on the left the leftist media saying that you can't
[38:59.840 --> 39:06.240]  blame all muslims for these kind of attacks which is true but then on the flip side as we saw with
[39:06.240 --> 39:15.520]  salon.com they collectively impune all white people for the actions of one lunatic in charleston
[39:15.520 --> 39:20.880]  oh yeah so you can't have it both ways but in this politically correct environment
[39:20.880 --> 39:28.240]  they refuse to even entertain the fact which is a fact it's provable um the islam is at its root
[39:28.240 --> 39:33.600]  of violent religion and that's where the terrorists who carried out these tragic attacks today
[39:34.640 --> 39:39.600]  draw their belief system from oh yeah absolutely they can't have it both ways uh paul because we
[39:39.600 --> 39:46.160]  live in this kind of kafka-esque world where anything goes whatever they say is is true now
[39:46.160 --> 39:51.840]  of course you you pointed out that there's a lot of broad-based support based on polls of uh people
[39:51.840 --> 39:58.240]  and france and elsewhere supporting isis we also know that the pentagon is supporting isis as well
[39:58.240 --> 40:03.200]  we have an article that came out yesterday from michael phalon pentagon playing isis paying isis
[40:03.200 --> 40:08.560]  linked rebels four hundred dollars a month to eventually fight Assad they've actually got isis
[40:08.560 --> 40:14.080]  on welfare after having created them and trained them and equipped them to go after syria they've
[40:14.080 --> 40:22.560]  now got them on welfare well i mean and even western countries sweden for example some prominent
[40:22.560 --> 40:29.120]  politicians and counselors in sweden are actively calling for isis militant to return from the
[40:29.120 --> 40:37.200]  battlefield from places like syria and iraq to be given jobs and government welfare when they return
[40:37.200 --> 40:42.240]  to sweden so it's not just you know the the us that's providing that but again so they can
[40:42.240 --> 40:47.280]  have welfare while they're there waiting and then if you know for deployment and then they come back
[40:47.920 --> 40:50.800]  to the west and they can get they can get on welfare special treatment as well
[40:51.680 --> 40:57.680]  this is the point when islamic extremists people in france like today for example
[40:58.480 --> 41:05.520]  people from terrorists when they kill people in syria we call them moderate rebels and send them
[41:05.520 --> 41:11.680]  weapons and money so it's a complete disconnect again you have people on the right saying this
[41:11.680 --> 41:17.600]  has got nothing to do with us foreign policy or nato foreign policy well clearly it has number one
[41:18.480 --> 41:26.480]  saudi arabia is the biggest exporter of extremist ideology and terrorists in the world all the
[41:26.480 --> 41:32.240]  radical preachers that come over to the uk to western europe to the united states and a significant
[41:32.240 --> 41:39.920]  portion of them anyway they were trained in saudi arabia in this extremist wahabi ideology
[41:39.920 --> 41:45.200]  they're trained they're protected they're even given awards by the saudi royal family
[41:45.200 --> 41:49.520]  they then travel across to britain to america to other western european countries
[41:49.520 --> 41:56.720]  to spread this violent hateful ideology and yet we're still allies with saudi arabia of course
[41:56.720 --> 42:02.640]  which is the driving force behind this sunny extremism they armed they protected they codilized
[42:02.640 --> 42:08.160]  this in the first place then we've obviously got the fact that our governments in libya
[42:08.160 --> 42:15.280]  in syria directly armed and funded and continue to do so these very same jihadists many of whom
[42:15.280 --> 42:23.360]  went on to join isis in the name of toppling gadafi and the sad so that's the key point to make it's
[42:23.360 --> 42:29.600]  both factors it's both the fact that islam is at its core of violent ideology and it's the
[42:29.600 --> 42:34.880]  fact that our support for these jihadists through our foreign policy uh leads to this further
[42:34.880 --> 42:43.680]  radicalization even in libya after the fall of gadafi the guy now leading isis in libya uh bell
[42:43.680 --> 42:50.080]  hatch he was the the head of the libian fighting forces in libya to overthrow gadafi that the
[42:50.080 --> 42:58.320]  us and nato supported now he's leading isis of course libya is now a total hellhole um thousands
[42:58.320 --> 43:04.000]  of people who live there are desperately trying to escape on boats and come to italy and great
[43:04.000 --> 43:10.640]  britain and other places in europe isis has said they will infiltrate western europe through these
[43:10.640 --> 43:17.440]  migrant boats through infiltrating them that way so it's a complete disaster and our foreign policy
[43:17.440 --> 43:23.520]  has in part led to it and of course uh what we saw in these hotels these shootings and hotels
[43:24.240 --> 43:30.480]  in tunisia uh back in september of last year the new york times pointed out that since the
[43:30.480 --> 43:36.560]  revolution that had happened back in 2011 overthrowing gadafi and of course that was
[43:36.560 --> 43:44.480]  the united states government's plan they've had 1.8 million libyans flow into tunisia
[43:44.480 --> 43:49.280]  and so the kind of violence that we saw these hotels as you're pointing out they're also now
[43:49.280 --> 43:53.600]  we've got a smaller number of people because tunisia is just right next door to libya they
[43:53.600 --> 43:57.760]  can just go across the border it's a little bit harder for them to travel across the
[43:57.760 --> 44:02.960]  mediterranean to italy and elsewhere to greece but they are going to come that's where they're
[44:02.960 --> 44:06.320]  going to come and with them they're going to bring this violence that we have created so when
[44:06.320 --> 44:11.600]  we look at this like you're talking about paul it's like the aspect of the the violence within
[44:12.320 --> 44:17.280]  much of islam as well as our government's involvement when we look at our government's
[44:17.280 --> 44:22.480]  involvement there's two components to that as well it's not just a blowback of bad policy like a lot
[44:22.480 --> 44:27.920]  of people have talked about it's not just the results of overthrowing gadafi of the arming of
[44:27.920 --> 44:33.120]  rebels that we saw going on in benghazi and what that was all fundamentally about but it's also
[44:33.120 --> 44:39.760]  a deliberate plan to create instability by our government that's what a lot of people will not
[44:39.760 --> 44:44.000]  acknowledge we can see that in europe and the ukraine and we can certainly see that
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.240]  in libya and northern africa and now with this violence that is going to be
[44:48.240 --> 44:55.360]  immigrating into europe precisely and you can see that in the news now almost every day
[44:55.360 --> 45:01.360]  there are these immigrant camps in callie which is a northern french port town where thousands of
[45:01.360 --> 45:08.560]  people a lot of them most of them north africans many from libya are in camp in callie they literally
[45:08.560 --> 45:15.360]  try to hijack shit trucks sorry transport vehicles that are going into britain i remember that video
[45:15.360 --> 45:21.440]  that article that you put up yeah that video was amazing yes go ahead i'm sorry basically
[45:21.440 --> 45:27.920]  terrifying that the drivers you know tourists on buses going into england again as a partly
[45:27.920 --> 45:33.120]  as a result of our foreign policy that's driven them out of libya in desperation because that is a
[45:33.120 --> 45:39.440]  hellhole now run by warlords so they're desperately trying to illegally immigrate into britain
[45:39.440 --> 45:46.080]  and that's causing a separate crisis on top of this terrorism then there's another point which i
[45:46.080 --> 45:49.840]  don't know if you've got and that's the video we've got right now that's showing what happened in
[45:49.840 --> 45:55.280]  callie france as they were trying to get across the channel to the uk just absolute chaos jumping
[45:55.280 --> 46:02.080]  on trucks hijacking trucks just amazing absolute bedlam and in fact the the truckers are going on
[46:02.080 --> 46:07.520]  strike they're going to find it difficult to import many foods into the united kingdom they're talking
[46:07.520 --> 46:13.760]  about even a collapse of the food supply at the very least soaring prices because they're having to
[46:13.760 --> 46:19.200]  go a huge way around they're having to go into holland instead before they reach britain and it's
[46:19.200 --> 46:23.600]  far more expensive so you've got that crisis and if they try to do anything about that paul they're
[46:23.600 --> 46:29.760]  accused of being xenophobic or racist they can't control the borders they can't control immigration
[46:29.760 --> 46:36.240]  and that's all part of the larger plan of the globalist to try to take down the western countries
[46:36.240 --> 46:41.760]  the wealthier countries by this kind of cloward and piven explosion bringing in as many people as
[46:41.760 --> 46:46.960]  quickly as they can expanding the welfare roles has been a long-term plan but now they are accelerating
[46:46.960 --> 46:52.800]  that to the point of collapse then they can rebuild their socialist utopian world government on the
[46:52.800 --> 46:59.520]  ruins of what they take down precisely and then in relation to that cloward and piven strategy
[47:00.160 --> 47:04.640]  you know remember what obama said after charleston you might be able to pull up the clip he said
[47:04.640 --> 47:10.160]  after that of course the mass shooting which killed nine people dylan roof of course the
[47:10.160 --> 47:16.400]  culprit he said quote this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries
[47:17.280 --> 47:23.200]  well yes it clearly does it's happened in france twice in the last six months alone it happened
[47:23.200 --> 47:29.840]  in denmark shortly after the charlie hebdo massacre but the difference obviously between garland
[47:29.840 --> 47:36.560]  which was a nice inspired attack and today's attack near leon is the fact that the only victims in
[47:36.560 --> 47:42.960]  garland were the terrorists who launched the attack there were no innocent victims in garland
[47:42.960 --> 47:49.040]  and why is that well it's because obviously responsible people in garland had firearms and
[47:49.040 --> 47:55.680]  were able to use them which ironically is the very thing that the left wants to abolish
[47:55.680 --> 48:01.280]  and eviscerate in the wake of charleston i dare to venture that if somebody at the front gate of
[48:01.280 --> 48:08.160]  this gas company that was attacked today had firearms like they had in garland then the
[48:08.160 --> 48:14.080]  poor individual who was decapitated might still be still be alive today but that's the difference
[48:14.080 --> 48:20.640]  you know in the wake of that charleston shooting i interviewed a man from south africa charleston
[48:20.640 --> 48:27.840]  vake and it was about 23 years ago that there was a similar attack on a church except it was much
[48:27.840 --> 48:32.800]  more virulent there were a lot more people there this attack in charleston was a small
[48:32.800 --> 48:37.440]  prayer meeting group and the individual killed pretty much everybody but that was there but
[48:37.440 --> 48:44.720]  in this attack in south africa there were over a thousand people some accounts put it at 1300
[48:44.720 --> 48:50.720]  people and their their intention was to kill every single person in that church they came in spraying
[48:50.720 --> 48:57.120]  ak-47s four gunmen and threw two grenades and so in a very short time they were able to kill
[48:57.120 --> 49:01.600]  i think it was 11 people a couple more people than were killed in the charleston shooting
[49:01.600 --> 49:08.080]  they seriously injured 58 people but there was one individual as a very very large church and he
[49:08.080 --> 49:15.120]  was all the way in the back caddy corner to that paul and he had a snub nose 38 which is not designed
[49:15.120 --> 49:21.360]  for shooting at a distance and he only had five shots he got off two shots and he wounded one
[49:21.360 --> 49:26.000]  of them he didn't know that he came around the back side they had stepped back because they
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.640]  realized at that point somebody was shooting they didn't expect anybody to be carrying any firearms
[49:30.640 --> 49:34.720]  because it was a liberal white church in a white neighborhood when he came around behind them and
[49:34.720 --> 49:38.800]  saw them looking at the door that they had come out thinking that there were going to be gunmen
[49:38.800 --> 49:41.920]  charging out there they're going to shoot them when they came out he came around behind them and
[49:41.920 --> 49:48.880]  shot at that point they fled he saved the lives of over a thousand people with just that snub nose
[49:48.880 --> 49:55.520]  38 and five shots and so we know that's very effective we've seen that in the in the shootings
[49:55.520 --> 49:59.360]  what was the was it in kenya i think we had the two different shootings one of them
[49:59.360 --> 50:03.280]  that went on for a very long time another one that was stopped relatively early with someone who is
[50:03.280 --> 50:09.920]  in the area that had a concealed weapon so we know that it's very effective at shutting those down
[50:09.920 --> 50:14.720]  people can always kill individuals at the very beginning with a kind of sucker punch but you
[50:14.720 --> 50:19.760]  can stop the attack before it goes on for days before you have hundreds or thousands of people
[50:19.760 --> 50:25.840]  killed yeah and then you compare that to charlie hebdo not only with a cartoonist who were attacked
[50:25.840 --> 50:30.720]  unarmed but the police when they first arrived on the scene were unarmed and had to basically
[50:30.720 --> 50:36.000]  scurry away before they could send in the anti-terror squad so again unarmed people become
[50:36.000 --> 50:41.600]  victims far more easy and that was proven again in the in the garland attack we've got to go
[50:41.600 --> 50:47.040]  to break and we're going to be right back with paul joseph wasen from the uk an amazing day of
[50:47.040 --> 51:01.600]  violence what's behind it will be right back so i say to market lunch look you know i keep hearing
[51:01.600 --> 51:06.960]  from the government that you know they're worried someday isis may get here that i go duck or garland
[51:06.960 --> 51:13.120]  texas mohammed cartoon shooting isis is already here i'm not waiting for these people to defend me

[54:17.920 --> 54:22.160]  momentarily lost contact with him we're going to be reestablished on that in just a moment
[54:22.160 --> 54:27.120]  again going over the happenings today the violence the islamic violence that's happening
[54:27.680 --> 54:34.320]  throughout the middle east and europe we've got isis going city to door to door in the city of
[54:34.320 --> 54:39.440]  uh hasaka i think is maybe the way you pronounce that nevertheless they're going door to door
[54:39.440 --> 54:46.240]  killing people we had a beheading at a french gas company uh and as well as an explosion and then
[54:46.240 --> 54:53.040]  we had a lot of people shot at multiple hotels in tunisia and of course tunisia has been flooded
[54:53.040 --> 54:58.400]  with nearly two million refugees courses 1.8 million according to new york times last september
[54:58.400 --> 55:08.240]  refugees from libya the reason because of colonel qaddafi's deposition there by the american forces
[55:08.240 --> 55:14.320]  and we have turned that place into a recruitment base for isis terrorism this article we had
[55:14.320 --> 55:20.000]  yesterday the pentagon announced on monday that it's begun paying moderate syrian rebels up to
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.120]  400 per month now these are the people that john mccain meets with you know uh they're supposed
[55:25.120 --> 55:29.840]  to be uh moderate they called it critical that was what the secretary of defense ashton carter
[55:29.840 --> 55:35.120]  says he said he's going to equip as many as 5400 fighters within the next 12 months according to
[55:35.120 --> 55:41.600]  us today so we're going to be paying up to 5400 fighters 400 a month just to hang around so at
[55:41.600 --> 55:48.400]  one point they can go in and take down the syrian government because that's what the american policy
[55:48.400 --> 55:53.840]  is it's one of destabilization it's actually a globalist policy and i think we've got uh paul back
[55:53.840 --> 56:02.320]  with us uh paul your comments no we don't have paul i guess uh this islamic cleric who put out a
[56:02.320 --> 56:10.240]  ramadan statement says if you kill a disbelieving american or european especially the spiteful and
[56:10.240 --> 56:16.320]  filthy french he says or australian or canadian or any other disbelievers and he goes on to suggest
[56:16.320 --> 56:21.680]  how you might do this in case you're not sure how to kill people according to his uh prescription
[56:21.680 --> 56:26.640]  he says smash his head with a rock or slaughter him with a knife or run him over with your car
[56:26.640 --> 56:32.640]  or throw him down from a high place or choke him or poison him said al adnani in a speech
[56:32.640 --> 56:40.400]  released uh well okay um just be careful because uh texans shoot back we saw that happen and uh it
[56:40.400 --> 56:45.040]  will be happening that's why we carry firearms let's play that clip from obama saying that this
[56:45.040 --> 56:53.120]  kind of violence uh doesn't happen in other countries go ahead but let's be clear at some
[56:53.120 --> 56:58.160]  point we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does
[56:58.160 --> 57:09.680]  not happen in other advanced countries it doesn't happen in other places with this kind of frequency
[57:09.680 --> 57:15.680]  and it is in our power to do something about it
[57:18.640 --> 57:20.960]  i say that recognizing the politics in this town
[57:23.040 --> 57:30.000]  foreclose a lot of those avenues right now yeah you know it is in our power to do something
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.440]  about that and we don't have the same kind of shootings in this country that you have in other
[57:33.440 --> 57:39.760]  countries because we do have the power and the ability and the means to defend ourselves of
[57:39.760 --> 57:44.400]  course obama doesn't like it the pope doesn't like it i mean i haven't seen any pronouncements from
[57:44.400 --> 57:49.680]  the pope about the supreme court decision on homosexual marriage but he was telling us earlier
[57:49.680 --> 57:56.560]  in the week that it was sometimes a moral imperative to get divorced i imagine that there's a lot of
[57:56.560 --> 58:04.400]  conservative catholics whose heads are spinning over a pope that is essentially flipped the catholic
[58:04.400 --> 58:09.360]  church's position upside down just like our government has flipped the law upside down of
[58:09.360 --> 58:14.160]  course he seems to be much more interested in leading from a political situation than he is
[58:14.160 --> 58:20.320]  from leading from a moral situation we have him saying that even having guns is anti christian
[58:20.320 --> 58:26.560]  no it's the way that you defend each other just as i pointed out when i talked to the um fellow from
[58:26.560 --> 58:32.880]  south africa his book was entitled the right and duty of self-defense that was a subtitle of his
[58:32.880 --> 58:41.360]  book the title was shooting back we'll be right back stay with us thank you for listening to gcm

[58:53.120 --> 58:58.560]  syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website info wars.com because the companies
[58:58.560 --> 59:03.520]  i've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they
[59:03.520 --> 59:09.600]  should be so i refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about
[59:09.600 --> 59:16.080]  six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms hdfirearms.com own and run by a bunch
[59:16.080 --> 59:20.640]  of former navy seals special ops people their veterans their patriots their listeners of the

[59:41.840 --> 59:48.240]  the spirit of 1776 lives at head down firearms hdfirearms.com
[59:51.440 --> 59:54.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[59:54.080 --> 01:00:12.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:21.200]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:27.440]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night here in austin we've been talking to
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:33.440]  paul joseph watson in the uk we lost contact with paul i wanted to give him the final word
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:40.880]  on what's going on in europe as well as in tunisia with these multiple instances of violence uh in
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:47.600]  france tunisia syria people going door to door killing people in syrian towns uh paul your last
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:54.560]  words on this yeah just one final thing we've had a debate for the entire week in the aftermath of
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:01:00.880]  the charleston shooting about the confederate flag so i asked the question on twitter earlier you know
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:07.440]  why didn't we just ban the icis flag surely that would prevent extremists from murdering people
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.760]  right that's you know surely if we'd have just banned the icis flag this beheading in france
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.560]  would have never have happened which of course is completely ridiculous but that's the argument
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:22.400]  we've been fed all this week in the aftermath of the dylan roof shootings to the point now where
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:30.800]  amazon.com is talking about forcing book publishers which will put many books out of print
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:37.600]  permanently to change the covers which display the confederate flag so we're talking about
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:45.200]  historical books about the civil war being forced to change the front covers in order to continue
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:52.720]  to be sold on amazon it's completely ludicrous apple came out yesterday and said they were banning
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:59.760]  and in fact they did go ahead and ban all games in the app store which had a civil war context
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:06.160]  so i guess now you know if a neo-nazi goes and shoots 10 people dead they're gonna have to ban
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:13.200]  all world war two video games they're gonna have to remove um william shire as the rise and fall of
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:19.760]  the third rike from amazon.com because it's got a swastika on the front cover that's right
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.320]  of ridiculousness that we've seen this week i think that's a good point why don't we just
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.160]  ban the icis flag and then we can stop all this stuff you know we didn't even really have to
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:33.360]  fight world war two we could have just banned the nazi flag that would have done it i think it's
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:39.120]  interesting when you look at amazon of course they have a history of censorship you can buy books
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.960]  store them electronically on your kindle device or other things like your iphone ipad and they
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:52.800]  deleted 1984 from a lot of people's devices as a as a famous occurrence a stroke of irony there
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:56.400]  they just took the entire novel and flushed it down the memory hole that's what's going to
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:02.320]  happen with these books when they say we can no longer bear to look at the confederate flag symbol
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.280]  yeah and you know people say well they're a private company they can do what they like
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:13.200]  that's correct but then what if you have another mass shooting and every single walmart store in
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:18.560]  america stops selling guns what if other gun stores say oh we're not going to sell you know
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.240]  semi-auto rifles because of this and they restrict it further and further and further
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:29.120]  which is why you know people need to boycott this if they disagree with it yes it's their right
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:34.240]  as a private enterprise to sell what they like but it's also our right to call them out on it
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.200]  and boycott them when it gets to that level where they're actually talking about banning
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:44.160]  civil war books because there might be a confederate flag on the cover you know Warner Brothers has
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:50.320]  banned the the dukes of hazard car because that has a better flag on the on the roof it's completely
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.720]  insane well i tell you what i find offensive i mean certainly slavery is offensive but i also find
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:02.160]  the profound ignorance uh offensive jim webb who was a senator from virginia he was a democrat
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:07.360]  senator from virginia he was also appointed as a navy secretary by ronald reagan there's talk
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:13.200]  that he might run for president but he hasn't evidently uh sold out to a big moneyed interest yet
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:17.440]  but he said we should remember that honorable americans fought on both sides of civil war including
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:23.520]  slave home holders in the union army you know people like u.s grant many slit non-slave holders
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.840]  fought for the south he says in recognition of the character of soldiers on both sides the federal
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:32.240]  government authorized the construction of the confederate memorial 100 years ago on the grounds
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:39.200]  of arlington national cemetery we don't realize that our entire country is illegitimate if we
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:43.520]  don't support the right of secession so is the declaration of independence coming up in just a
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:48.320]  few days thank you so much for joining us paul joseph watson stay with us right after the break
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.800]  we're going to be talking to barbara low fisher about what's going on with vaccine mandates and
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:59.520]  california and across the country and the issues associated with your right of consent joe bigs here
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.880]  with info wars dot com now a lot of people are saying that they want to ban the confederate flag it
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:09.680]  seems because of what it represented this is the thing though where will it stop there has been more
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:15.040]  slavery under the current flag that we have than that of the confederate flag what a lot of people
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:20.960]  forget is that we have to learn from our past we cannot erase what has happened by banning flags
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:26.240]  and taking everything down that reminds us of a bad past remember those who forget their past
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:31.600]  are doomed to repeat it all over again we need our past however bad it may be to some of us so we
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:36.960]  can learn from those mistakes a racing history sets us up to repeat those same mistakes over and over
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:42.560]  again now it's understandable that a lot of people see this as a flag that is racist and things like
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:48.240]  that but when you have places like amazon and google now banning the cells of confederate
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:53.440]  memorabilia that's when you kind of cross the line no we have to keep this stuff out there so it
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:59.520]  is a reminder to never do that again this is joe bigs info wars dot com ladies and gentlemen
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:04.320]  you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers and sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:09.520]  nightly news or the news website info wars dot com because the companies i've been approached by
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:15.600]  were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so i refused probably

[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:43.200]  nvicadvocacy.org joining us now is barbara low fisher welcome barbara thank you i would like to
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:46.800]  know first of all tell us all because it's confusing when we try to follow these bills and
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:51.680]  try to follow the uh the the trade treaties that are working their way through the various ones
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:56.480]  it's a very complicated process can you give us an overview first of all what's going on in california
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:01.040]  and then let's talk about all these other laws that are being instituted across the country that would
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:07.840]  remove our informed consent hold a gun to our heads to buy products for which the pharmaceutical
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:15.040]  companies have no product liability tell us first about california yes well as a lot of people know
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:21.520]  in uh january we have a lot of publicity out of california and measles outbreaks associated with
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:29.040]  disneyland uh and what happened immediately with those when those cases were reported
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:34.960]  is that legislation started to be introduced in a number of states including california
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:42.240]  to remove or restrict the ability of americans to take non-medical vaccine exemptions that is
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:48.560]  vaccines exemptions for religious personal philosophical or conscientious beliefs uh
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:55.680]  uh most of your followers probably know that we have vaccine laws in all the states all states
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:00.720]  allow medical exemption all but two states west virginia and mississippi allow a religious
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:06.880]  exemption and about 17 states allow a personal philosophical or conscientious belief exemption
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.440]  california is a state that has a personal belief exemption in indeed in addition to the medical
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:19.040]  exemption but what happened was several years ago uh legislators introduced a bill ab 209
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.560]  to restrict the personal belief exemption require people to get a doctor's signature in order to
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:31.280]  take that exemption well they they passed that law and there has been a reduction in the numbers
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.720]  of people who take the personal belief exemption in california right now it's about 2.5 percent of
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:42.880]  all children attending california schools have a personal belief exemption uh but after the
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:49.520]  disneyland outbreak measles outbreak they decided to come in these same sponsors decided to come in
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:56.800]  and and introduce sp277 which would completely remove the personal belief exemption for religious
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:03.920]  and conscientious beliefs where we stand right now despite protests uh for the last three months
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:10.800]  with thousands of californians have come to the sacramento state capital with their children many
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:17.200]  of them with their children to testify in the the several uh hearings that have been held in the
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:24.160]  the senate and in the house uh as well as the 10 rallies that were have been protesting public
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:34.160]  rallies protesting this bill uh the senate passed it the assembly has just voted 46 to 30 to pass it
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:41.520]  and it will soon be on governor brown's desk and it is an extremely oppressive bill it will mean
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:47.280]  that california will join west virginia and mississippi as three states even if governor
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:56.240]  brown signs it that only allow a medical exemption now why this is so important uh to to have everyone
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:02.320]  who's in california contact governor brown and express their opinion about what they think about
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:09.760]  this bill is because in this country now almost no medical condition qualifies for a medical
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:17.600]  exemption under federal guidelines 99.99 percent of children and adults do not qualify for a medical
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:23.200]  vaccine exemption under federal guidelines those federal guidelines are followed by the american
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:28.640]  county pediatrics the american medical association all the medical trade groups insist that their
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:34.400]  members follow the federal vaccine exemption guidelines this means that almost no child
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:40.480]  will be qualified for a medical exemption it means you have forced vaccination with a violation of
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.840]  the human right to inform consent of medical risk taking violation of parental rights to make
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:51.440]  medical decisions for their children uh and what they're basically saying in california and in
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:58.160]  states that don't have a personal leave exemption is that you must abandon the human right to inform
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:05.680]  consent to medical risk taking in order to enjoy the civil right to a school education yes they want
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:11.760]  to move everyone into a ghetto they want to punish you by using the stick of denying you getting
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:16.480]  into a school even a private school they even had homeschool at one point they've removed that
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.960]  but they're going to come after the homeschoolers this is just a temporary uh bargaining chip i think
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:26.400]  they did that because they know the homeschoolers are going to fight them the hardest so they took
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:31.760]  them out thinking they wouldn't fight but i watched that testimony i watched the people line up there
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:35.680]  come to the microphone one at a time give their names a little bit about their background and say
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.520]  i posed this bill of course they ignored the wishes of all those people there are quite a
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:44.640]  few people there that identified themselves as homeschoolers so they understand that they're
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:50.160]  next on the list i i think this is absolutely shameful i think this is something that is worthy
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.440]  of nazi germany when you're talking about exemptions to me that is only discussed because
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:16:01.520]  you're talking about something that's being mandated we have a right to informed consent that
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:07.760]  is our right as individuals i read this statement from you off of your website uh barbara earlier
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:13.120]  this is again barbara low co-founder of nvic the national vaccine information center this is at the
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:19.680]  top of your page if the state can tag track down and force citizens against their will to be injected
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:26.640]  with biologicals of known and unknown toxicity today there will be no limit on which individual
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:32.640]  freedoms the state can take away in the name of the greater good tomorrow that is the essence of
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:37.920]  this wherever you come down on the science and when i saw the testimonies there there were people
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:45.840]  who believed in the safety and the efficacy of vaccines doctors and others who said this is a
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:53.360]  bad idea they spoke up against taking away people's informed consent that's exactly right when you have
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:17:01.360]  a situation in this country where we have always uh cherished first amendment rights the right to
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:08.560]  freedom of thought speech conscience religion uh and you you say that the government has the right
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:15.600]  to tell doctors to inject you with whatever they want to inject you with in terms of these vaccines
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:21.520]  and we have to remember that when the the legal precedent was set in 1905 in jameson versus
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:28.720]  massachusetts that affirmed the right of the states to mandate smallpox vaccine there was only one
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:37.520]  vaccine today the federal recommendations are 69 doses of 16 vaccines that children are supposed
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:45.200]  to get from day of birth to age 18 with 49 doses of 14 vaccines given by the age of six
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.440]  this is a very different situation than we were talking about back even and i disagree with
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:57.520]  jacobs and i think jacobson is a tragically flawed decision on moral grounds on scientific grounds
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:04.320]  uh you know if you could take it the jacobson versus massachusetts and all the way to homes in 1923
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:11.280]  you can use it to justify the forced sterilization of carry buck in virginia because he he judged her
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:16.880]  to be mentally defective and he said three generations of imbeciles are enough and enough
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:22.640]  if you can have a eugenics decision based on jacobson versus massachusetts that that that said
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:28.640]  the state can uh force vaccination that is an ethically flawed decision and we know that this
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:32.720]  is where this is ultimately going and where a lot of this is coming from don't we barber because
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:37.680]  we look at informed consent we look at what was said at the nuremberg trials they said we are going
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:43.120]  to enshrine informed consent because if you hold to that principle you can't have the kinds of things
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:47.760]  that happen in auschwitz and elsewhere where they were mingle and others were experimenting on people
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:52.000]  they said they were doing it and the greater good you know we're going to do these horrific
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.160]  things in prisoner of war camps to people because we're going to find out about the human body
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:01.760]  no you don't experiment on people this is not a problem of other countries either we had the
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:06.640]  tuskegee experiments the injecting people giving people syphilis without their consent without
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.920]  their knowledge telling them that they're going to get treatment but then giving them placebos that
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:15.040]  went on for decades against black people we've had the cia doing that as well yes go ahead right
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:19.840]  i mean there are very famous experiments on mentally retarded children hepatitis v vaccine
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:26.000]  experiments on having on mentally retarded children in new york uh or was it illinois i
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:32.560]  can't remember which which which uh asylum it was but you know we absolutely have to understand
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:37.520]  that protecting the human right to inform consent to medical risk taking and as you said the nuremberg
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:44.160]  trials which uh the their tribunal at the doctor's trial issued the nuremberg code now even though
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:47.520]  that code specifically hang on hang on right there i want to pick up with the nuremberg quote
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:52.400]  when we come back we've got to take a commercial break barbara we're talking to barbara low uh

[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:19.280]  knight your host today on this friday june 26 2015 i'm talking to barbara lo fisher she's a president
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:24.400]  of the national vaccine information center they're tracking these mandatory bills that are
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:30.240]  working their way through the legislatures across this country taking away our fundamental humanity
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:38.160]  our right to informed consent when you take that away that is something that is far more dangerous
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:45.040]  than any disease any outbreak in my opinion we cannot surrender our liberty in the idea that
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:50.240]  we think that it's going to make us safer slaves are never safe to the extent that you give up
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:57.200]  your liberty you become a slave to that degree and you become less secure to that degree today
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:03.680]  people value nothing more in this society than the promise of safety and security it is a promise
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:09.200]  that cannot be delivered by these things that we are using to take away our fundamental rights as
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:16.240]  human beings before we had to go to the break we were talking to a barbara about issues where they
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:22.960]  have violated people as human beings by taking away their informed consent by experimenting
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.840]  on them as humans barbara continue with that story that you're telling us about hepatitis
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:35.360]  vaccine there has been many examples not only in this country but other countries where doctors
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.640]  have taken upon themselves taken the authority to use their authority to abuse human and civil
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:46.880]  rights and experiment on people many times without them even knowing it and you know when you look at
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:53.200]  the Nuremberg code you realize it did apply to human experimentation but after the Nuremberg code
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:58.160]  was issued it was really applied to all medical procedures when you go to a hospital you see
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:03.600]  often on the walls it says that you have patients have rights and responsibilities one of the rights
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:11.280]  is your right to refuse medical treatment or a drug that you think will harm you or if you are
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:17.120]  a parent harm your child that's called informed consent and informed consent has been the standard
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:22.800]  the goal standard in ethical practice of medicine since World War II here we are separating out
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:28.640]  vaccination from the informed consent principle and saying oh well it doesn't apply to pharmaceutical
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:34.720]  products like vaccines biological products that have an inherent ability to cause injury or death
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:40.560]  that risk can be greater for some people than other people for biological and genetic reasons
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:46.080]  what you have is a state basically adopting a one-size-fits-all approach and you know it is
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:51.360]  a factor selection of the genetically vulnerable for sacrifice against their will yeah because
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:57.120]  there are known and unknown genetic and biological high risk factors that's that's really what it is
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:01.680]  that's that was a very good point that you made at the state the California state hearings on
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:07.440]  SB 277 you pointed out that we don't it's a very small number of people that will get a disease
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:13.440]  like measles that will have serious complications at a very small but we don't know the numbers of
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:16.800]  people that are going to have adverse reactions and we don't know who's going to have it because
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:21.680]  the vaccine science is not good enough to tell us who is genetically predisposed to have these
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:25.760]  kinds of reactions so we're just playing Russian roulette with this and the point you made I think
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:31.520]  was was very important who's to say that the people who have a genetic predisposition to
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:36.880]  adverse effects are less valuable than the people who have a genetic predisposition to have a
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:42.880]  serious effect from the disease itself that's exactly right and if you look at these for the
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:48.640]  last few years and the IC has been saying know the risks and failures of vaccinations if you look
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:58.080]  in California last year 90 percent of the pediatric hooping cough cases pertussis cases that had
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:05.600]  vaccine records had been vaccinated if you look at the measles outbreak from Disneyland 30 percent
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:12.320]  of the individuals who were diagnosed with measles had been vaccinated only 18 percent of the total
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:21.280]  number of about 134 cases were children of school age this bill is not about what what there's the
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:26.640]  sponsors are saying it's about they're saying it's about disease control and herd immunity it's really
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:33.280]  about taking the power away from parents to make informed voluntary decisions about vaccination
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:40.480]  for their children and giving it to doctors who have absolutely no liability and no accountability
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:44.960]  whenever a child is injured or dies from vaccination and that's the key point and we're
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:48.400]  going to talk about that in the next segment we don't have enough time to get into this segment
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:53.440]  but that's the key point when you're talking about the multiplication the the growth of the number
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:58.000]  of vaccines that people are given is growing exponentially and it's only going to continue
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.280]  to grow because they have removed any legal liability from the pharmaceutical companies if
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.680]  they call something a vaccine so now what do we see we saw a couple of years ago they just announced
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.840]  we're not going to mess with antibiotics anymore we're going to just focus on vaccines and when
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:16.640]  that happened i kind of scratched my head i thought what i don't understand that now they
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:21.200]  they said well because we're we're overusing antibiotics and they're getting into the supply
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:28.240]  so of food so it's not being as effective i now understand after i i didn't know at the time but
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:33.680]  i now understand that because they have removed the liability for vaccines from these companies
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:39.600]  that they can produce a vaccine for any situation and they have no incentive to make sure that it's
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:44.480]  safe because they have no liability on the back end stay with us we're going to continue to talk to
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:49.840]  Barbara Lowe Fisher president of the national vaccine information center about medical tyranny

[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:15.760]  our country is falling apart because people have forgotten to fight to stand up in the face of tyranny

[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:38.640]  why we sell the kind of products that we do this segment of alex jones is brought to you by clean
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:45.120]  water the way you can get that if you're gone the city waters apply even if you're on a well the way
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:50.000]  you can make sure you're getting that of course is with water filters that's why alex and i both use
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.520]  pro pure water filters from info wars store dot com you know we're talking to barbara low fisher
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:01.760]  about mandatory vaccines they've been putting fluoride in your water without your informed
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:07.840]  consent for a very long time i mean you can have the argument whether you want to i'll argue that
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:12.560]  and we've made this case many times about the health risks of fluoride we know that it is harmful
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:17.920]  but let's just take the argument that it is not harmful for you why would you ever medicate people
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:24.400]  through the water supply how could you ever control the dosage even if it was effective even if it was
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:29.440]  safe why would you do that in the water supply you can take action to stop that yourself and of
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.800]  course you can get the new pro pure water picture filters that filter fluoride right now for 20 off
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:40.640]  until the end of june while supplies last this filter can be used for travel and again it filters
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:46.160]  fluoride you can also find filters that will filter out glyphosate if you're on a well you
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:50.640]  still have to be concerned about that so many people are using roundup that glyphosate can get
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:56.480]  into the aquifer you can get that even if you're not on a city water system where they're intentionally
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:02.320]  dumping chemicals into your water again the special will expire in four days is through the
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:09.520]  end of june is a 20 off of pro pure water filters at the info wars store dot com going back to
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:13.360]  barbara loaf fisher the national vaccine information center we've been talking
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:18.640]  about the civil liberties issues the legal issues we've just began to touch on some of the health
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:24.640]  issues we were talking before the break about how they are magnifying the number of vaccines that
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:30.640]  we are required to take we have to take them on a schedule i don't know if you've seen the
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:35.920]  article or not barbara but i talked to michelle rodin of nurses against mandatory vaccines i
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:40.800]  think it's may first i talked to her about how they're holding a gun to the heads of health
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:46.400]  professionals to force them to take vaccines that's the way they do it they say oh you still have
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:51.920]  informed consent it's just if you don't do it you can't go to school you can't have a job but
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:57.040]  you know you can still uh we still technically have informed consent they're not giving people
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:03.520]  informed consent and when i was talking to her she talked to me about her specialty is a intensive
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:08.720]  care unit for premies and she was saying they are so rigidly on this schedule that even though they
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:15.200]  had premature babies very low birth weight they knew that it was going to have a a toxic effect
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:20.400]  on them they're going to have to intubate them they were at very high risk for sepsis and other
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:24.720]  things respiratory issues they knew that was going to happen they said get ready we're going to
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:30.000]  vaccinate these premies because it's on schedule and we have to slavishly follow that schedule
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  that was bombshell information and less than one month later uh barbara we saw a she found
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.080]  a uh journal of the american medical association report verifying that in a very large study of
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:48.880]  over 13 000 infants they had verified precisely this and yet they did not say that the physicians
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:54.720]  would ever not vaccinate that was never a part of the discussion even though it was harming them so
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:40:00.480]  we've not only lost the idea of informed consent but we've lost the idea of first do no harm oh
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:06.080]  absolutely the first do no harm precautionary principle has completely been abandoned by
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:12.240]  federal health officials and state health officials and by doctors it's extremely dangerous and you
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:18.240]  know i i'm reminded of a quote by evisel who said you know when you take an idea or a concept and
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:25.120]  turn it into an abstraction you take people and turn them also into abstractions when we turn
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:32.720]  people into abstractions what is left you know the fact that they are not seeing that each individual
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:37.200]  is not we're not all the same we don't all respond the same way to pharmaceutical products those
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:44.320]  premies those low weight babies in the newborn nursery uh you know to to have it one size is
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:48.800]  all approach to vaccination and have a rigid schedule where you don't take into account
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:56.080]  variabilities between people is is shocking and it's dangerous and the only thing that stands
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:05.040]  between us and tyranny that i i say in my testimony the right of the state to tell us what to do to
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:12.320]  the bodies of our children ends where our right is parents to protect our children's lives begins
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:18.320]  yes absolutely when they talk about exemptions what they're talking about is taking fundamental
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:22.400]  human rights and turning them into privileges that are granted by the government and they can
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:28.800]  just be wiped away by the government the next day that that's right and that's why i've always said
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:34.240]  for 20 years i've been saying the human right to inform consent and medical risk taking is a
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:39.920]  it is a right that we must protect in this country how can we protect it right now we can protect
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:47.120]  it by securing flexible medical religious and conscientiously exemptions in all public health
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:54.640]  policies and laws including vaccine policies and laws uh what what do we do i mean i like the message
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:42:02.160]  i just heard at the break uh that alex jones was was saying we have to get involved we we can't
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:07.440]  just sit in our houses on our comfortable couches and watch tv every night and not understand that
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:13.920]  if we don't get involved in this democracy we're going to lose our freedoms and the first freedom
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:20.000]  is going to be having any kind of control over what is put into our bodies and our children's bodies
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:25.760]  absolutely we see over and over again barbara when people will stand up en masse and make
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:29.920]  demands on the government that is supposed to serve them they will back down we have seen this
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:34.160]  over and over again they will come at you from a different direction they will continue to come on
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:39.760]  i mean the fight for freedom and liberty is something that never ends it it requires eternal
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:44.720]  vigilance but it is something we can back them down we have seen this over and over again when
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:48.960]  i look at the situation and again we can talk about the science and we have talked about the
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:54.240]  science but to me the fundamental thing and is the civil liberties issue i look at the jahovah's
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:58.160]  witnesses they have a religious belief that they don't want to do blood transfusions i don't share
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:02.880]  that belief i think the blood transfusions are are something that i would have i would have that for
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:08.400]  my family under certain circumstances i mean there's been horrific uh problems with contamination
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:14.960]  within the blood supply but that wasn't why they came after they didn't give you a an argument from
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:21.200]  the efficacy issue they just said it's against our religion to do that i support their right to make
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:25.920]  that choice i don't understand why people would give that up they don't understand that they're
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:31.680]  giving up their own humanity when they hold a gun to your head for sure to buy a product
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:38.400]  and inject that product in yourself and in your family for which the seller has no financial
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:43.200]  liability i cannot understand that it's just so far beyond anything but that's what we see over
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:48.080]  and over again the big corporations so totally owning the government that they are using the
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:52.000]  government no more just to to get advantage what they used to do in the old days would say get
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.200]  advantage from uh their smaller competitors today they use the government to hold a gun to your head
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:03.360]  to compel you to buy their products and that's fundamentally what this is about well it is and
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:10.640]  now there is a public private financial partnership uh since 9-1-1 the bio shield legislation and other
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:18.000]  legislation has formed a an official congress has formed allowed the agency federal agencies to form
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:24.080]  a financial partnership with the pharmaceutical industry the pharmaceutical industry is way too
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:31.120]  present and powerful within federal agencies including NIH and Department of Health and Human
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:38.480]  Services the CDC FDA and what's happened is when you've got government making a financial deal
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:44.000]  with pharma and you are supposed and the FDA is supposed to have some regular you know regulating
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.440]  these products for safety and for effectiveness and if you've got the FDA paying i mean the
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:56.400]  a pharmaceutical is paying the FDA they're fast tracked to licensure yeah vaccines and so salaries
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:02.160]  are being paid by pharma money you are not going to get really an honest evaluation and you have
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:09.200]  the policy makers of the CDC making policy to uh to recommend these vaccines for universal use
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:14.960]  that universal use recommendation is taken by state health officials and that's how mandates are
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:22.960]  created and as i said in my testimony in california to these legislators this legislation sp277
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:28.240]  that takes away personal belief exemption has a a sentence in there that is going to allow health
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:37.840]  officials to add new vaccines to this the required list and the legislators have no vote yes yes and
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:41.840]  there's no end to what they're going to do they've already said they're going to stop working on
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:46.160]  antibiotics and they have they're going to make everything a vaccine and the fundamental issue
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:50.960]  for that of course is the vaccine court talk to us about that that was something that was created
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:57.520]  back in 1986 why because they were having a lot of people who were suing because of
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:02.720]  adverse reactions so what they did was they gave them legal immunity by setting up this vaccine
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:08.560]  court tell us a little bit about that i was one of the parents that was there in the early 1980s
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.440]  and what the drug company said to congress was we are going to leave this country with no childhood
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:19.760]  vaccines if you do not protect us from liability in civil court the doctors were also threatening
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:25.520]  to not give vaccines so what did the congress do we came to the tape they told us you could come
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:30.400]  to the table and fight for what you think the family should get but we are passing this legislation
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:37.280]  with or without you we came and we fought for the for parents and for children and we said we
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:42.960]  will never agree to a that you would completely protect the pharmaceutical companies and doctors
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:49.520]  from liability it's got to be a choice people could either go to federal compensation or they could
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:55.360]  or they could sue the companies and doctors but at the end of the day we were not we were as
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:02.080]  powerful as the companies and as the doctors the medical trade organizations and they passed
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:08.960]  legislation that protected it gave partial liability protection to the companies it gave
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:14.480]  pretty much complete liability protection to the doctors in 2011 the supreme court came in
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:21.840]  and what the supreme court said was vaccines are unavoidably unsafe there shall be no more
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:28.960]  product liability for any reason for vaccines in in terms of the companies having any product
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:36.400]  liability that was the day that we within a few months we saw the legislation start to be
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:42.960]  introduced in these states like washington and vermont to try to take away the personal belief
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:50.160]  exemption now what's happened this year across the country vermont lost its the philosophical
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:57.840]  exemption but they retained a religious exception they're religious and medical or gone and washington
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:02.960]  that legislation was basically shelled they were not able to take away the personal belief
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:10.800]  exemption in either of those states 20 bills in texas failed all of them failed why did they fail
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:17.280]  because we have had very active people in texas including don richardson who was our director
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:24.160]  of state advocacy for 20 years she's worked down there and when you when people are involved
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:29.600]  in the political process when they talk to their legislators when they get involved on a personal
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:37.280]  basis you can hold back this encroachment on civil liberties and texas is a very good example
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:44.720]  yes my message is the same as your message we must get involved in our democracy and one of the
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:49.040]  ways we do that let me give this to you you've got information about what the status of different
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:55.600]  bills are on a state-by-state basis that's at nvicadvocacy.org is that correct that's right
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:03.040]  all right 2010 we created this advocacy portal it's free you would then you come in and you are
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:08.400]  a user of the portal and we in your email box you will receive emails when vaccine bills are
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:13.680]  being introduced in your state particularly those that will take away your freedom or in some states
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:19.440]  we're trying to get wider exemptions in the state so you you are able then to be put into direct
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:26.480]  electronic contact with your own legislator and you get email alerts about rallies about
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:32.480]  the status of the legislation as it moves through your your state and you can then
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:38.880]  participate in the process so it's a great educational tool communications tool and advocacy tool
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:44.560]  that allows you to participate on the on the issue of vaccine bills that's very important that
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:49.120]  people go there and look at that and and again multiply your effectiveness by having people
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:55.440]  who are going to know precisely what's going on there that's nvic national vaccine information
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:02.160]  center nvic.org and then there's nvicadvocacy.org where they can find out what's going on on a
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:06.880]  state-by-state level when you're talking about this and you're talking about how the government
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:13.600]  said they had to have the vaccine court because they knew that the product was unsafe the supreme
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:18.800]  court extends this blanket protection to them saying we know that they're inherently unsafe it's
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:25.120]  it's an admission that their product is not safe and yet they continue down this pike
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:29.600]  people need to understand that the government is not there in an adversarial relationship looking
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:37.600]  at the products of big pharma this is regulatory capture this is crony capitalism this is corruption
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:43.520]  in our government we're going to see far more of this with these trade promotion agreements if they
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:48.240]  allow these trade treaties to go through we'll come back and just right after the break we're
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:52.560]  going to continue to talk to barbara lowfisher president of the national vaccine information

[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:18.960]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david night your host today we are talking to barbara
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:24.000]  lofischer president of the national vaccine information center about the bill that is
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:29.600]  very close to passing in california in spite of massive public opposition they're ramming
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:34.720]  this thing through it has cleared both houses of the legislature it is going to the governor's
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:40.080]  desk many believe that he will sign it but it hasn't been done yet there is still an opportunity
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:45.920]  to put pressure on him she has the national vaccine information centers nvic.org also the
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:51.760]  nvicadvocacy.org will help you to know what's going on in your state in terms of bills that
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:57.760]  are up and as you pointed out here in texas we had over 20 bills that would take away our informed
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:03.680]  consent in various degrees presented to the state legislature this year thanks to people getting
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:10.000]  together and working collectively at nvicadvocacy.org as well as people getting involved as citizens
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.240]  we have beaten those down in texas other states have had victories as well it looks like it's
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:19.920]  not going that way in california in this last segment i want to continue to talk about what
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:26.160]  we were talking about in the last segment barbara and that is the naive idea that somehow somebody
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:32.480]  is watching out for the safety of these vaccines for which the big pharmaceutical companies have
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:37.280]  absolutely no liability that's why we have the vaccine court many people have never heard of
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:42.320]  that we need to make sure people understand that because that tells you right there that there's
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:47.840]  something that stinks about this relationship this regulatory capture we've seen gmo say
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:53.440]  or monsanto say the same thing about gmo saying we don't have to verify that our products are safe
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:58.320]  that's the job of the fda and i think many people think oh the fda is looking out for us they're
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:02.320]  testing all these vaccines they're not the pharmaceutical companies and the am a are just
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:07.840]  allowed to multiply these things out there as required coming from the cdc they're actually
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:12.400]  working with the industry to do that coming up with a schedule that they slavishly follow even
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:18.320]  if it creates known problems for low birth weight babies premature babies they continue to push on
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:24.800]  with this yeah and i mean if people need to become educated about this issue they need to
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:30.960]  understand when they go to a doctor's office and they're pressured to get these vaccines and the
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:35.600]  last thing you want to do is not have information not understand your personal and family medical
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:40.800]  history not understand what the vaccines are what the ingredients are whether or not you know what
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:46.560]  the tests are that they the clinical trials are that they use to prove that the vaccine was quote
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:52.240]  safe i've been saying for for many years that the standards are way too low at the fda for proof of
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:57.360]  safety and effectiveness of these vaccines it's really up to the consumer to get educated and
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:03.520]  then empower yourself by getting involved in the political process make sure you elect people
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:09.440]  who you know are going to have integrity and are going to vote in a way that is going to protect
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:16.800]  your civil liberties and your human rights it's really our democracy is about who we elect to
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:23.200]  govern us these laws that are had been coming out in the last 10 15 years that are taking away our
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:28.480]  liberties including our right to inform consent to medical risk-taking vaccine risk-taking are
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:33.600]  extremely dangerous as you pointed out and we pointed out in this hour so and of course people
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:37.840]  can find out more information at your website about the medical issues we barely touched that
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:43.360]  because it's such an overriding issue that could should concern everybody regardless of what they
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:50.160]  think about vaccines they should recoil in horror at the removal of our fundamental human right
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:54.800]  of informed consent because as you pointed out once they do that once they can can inject
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:58:00.080]  toxins into you without your consent without proper oversight as we've talked about with the
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:05.040]  government they can do anything to you you were essentially their slave it is a form of medical
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:11.600]  tyranny writ large yes it's a slippery slope once they can do anything they want to do your body
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:16.880]  of the body of your child well thank you so much that really what else can they do they can basically
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:21.680]  do anything absolutely thank you so much for joining us barbara low fisher president of the
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:28.480]  national vaccine information center you can find more information at nvic.org educate yourself
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:34.480]  educate your friends and family and neighbors about this this is an imperative issue not only
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:38.080]  about the vaccines but about our human rights we'll be right back stay with us
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:45.760]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:54.480]  when cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in no one has put together a formula that

[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host we were just talking in the last
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:32.400]  segment to barbara low fisher of the national vaccine information center about what's going
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:37.760]  on in california it looks like they're going to ram through mandatory vaccines take away people's
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:43.280]  informed consent but as you pointed out this is a national movement and we defeated it here in
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:49.200]  texas we had over 20 bills with the assistance of the information you can find at the national
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:56.320]  vaccine information center and nvicadvocacy.org where you can find out the bills in your state
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:00.960]  by people getting active in texas they were able to shut that down it's a very important thing to
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:08.000]  remember to understand you know we had a bill that was put out by david simpson to basically remove
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:15.680]  marijuana from the texas code he said it's a natural substance you talk about informed consent
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:22.080]  when they can take away your right to medicate yourself they can also take away your right to
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:27.200]  refuse medication we talked about the right to refuse medication here in texas that bill from
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:35.040]  david simpson did not pass but they did pass a bill that would allow people to have medical marijuana
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:40.720]  if they or their children in most cases its children were suffering from continuous seizures
[02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:46.720]  why is that happening so frequently there was a very interesting case in charlotte north carolina
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:52.960]  there was another one that was and i believe it was boston uh we heard testimony during the sp277
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:58.880]  hearings in california a man was testifying his educational lawyer testifying that the same thing
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:04.240]  had happened to his child i see all of these cases happening across the country and one of the things
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:09.280]  that david simpson had said was the only thing these people whose children were suffering as a
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:15.760]  result of this of adverse reaction to a vaccine that gave them continuous life threatening seizures
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:20.480]  the only thing that stopped that was medical marijuana and it was a shame that they had to go
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:27.600]  all the way to colorado to do that to face arrest here in texas that has also changed in texas
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:35.920]  we now have the ability to take medical marijuana for that particular and only for that particular
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:41.920]  ailment but that right there tells you that it should no longer be a class one uh drug it does
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:47.200]  have medical uses it has been recognized by the state of texas as well as many others
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:53.440]  we have an amazing video and i want to get just to some uh uh kind of miscellaneous stories
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:58.720]  so we've got we've got an amazing video up on info wars dot com shocking video emerges a girl
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:03.520]  being attacked while holding a toddler i want to play a little bit of that video let's let's roll
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:16.960]  that here okay there's some people talking and who are you here bleep and uh two people are setting
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:21.280]  two white people are setting on a bench two women uh one of them is holding a toddler
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:24.480]  and then there's two black ladies and they're having an argument
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:39.520]  dude take the baby off take the baby off take the baby off i don't know why this person is filming
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:49.120]  this argument baby don't leave the baby see the baby get off i don't think they really are scared
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:57.440]  that is a some part of it that is an amazing video just grabbed her by the hair and
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:02.160]  was dragging her along the ground she had the baby in her arms the baby fell on the ground
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:08.080]  now she's just beating her on the ground this is a racially motivated attack
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:15.200]  yeah unfortunately just insane that's a video you can see that on info wars dot com
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:20.640]  has gone viral there's over six million views of that it's just absolute insanity we've seen this
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:26.320]  week from the bills that have been passed by the uh by the supreme court to what we see happening
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:34.240]  with these trade treaties it is absolute insanity absolutely no reason or rhyme to anything that
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:41.520]  seems to be happening in this country anymore uh nevertheless the problem is the confederate flag
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:46.560]  or maybe it's the climate maybe uh you know it's your car maybe too much exhaust forget about the
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:51.840]  sun the pope says it's you you're the problem not their private jets that they fly around to their
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:59.920]  climate summits it's you stay with us we're gonna be right back with mark dice did you know that
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:07.680]  only six corporations control 90 percent of what millions of americans see here and read every
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:14.720]  single day it's the illusion of choice think about it the mainstream media is owned by only a handful
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:20.960]  of mega corporations with vested interests but on the other hand the internet is an interconnected
[02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:28.160]  network of billions of sources so you can research information for yourself from multiple sources
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:34.480]  or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media never questioning what you
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:40.480]  are being told this gives you a false sense of reality i mean do you actually know what you
[02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:46.960]  think you know or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events think about it

[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:15.440]  a lot of very very successful videos i always go viral because you have a wonderful way of
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:21.680]  putting this in a satire i think the way that we illustrate absurdity the way we can change
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:26.960]  people's minds is to illustrate the absurdity and really i think kind of the profound ignorance i mean
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:32.080]  we've been seeing a lot of that this last week that seems to be the uh ongoing theme of this last
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:39.920]  week you just had a video out about selling a 10 ounce silver bar that was worth 160 dollars
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:46.880]  you couldn't get that sold right and this is you'll see the video this is right in front of a coin
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:53.600]  shop and just to illustrate that the general public have no idea about the value of precious metals
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:59.120]  it might as well been a block of wood that i was trying to sell them some of the people in the
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:03.440]  comments and some of the people who are skeptical say oh well they just didn't buy it because they
[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:08.640]  thought it was a scam there's a lot of fake silver bars out there which there are fake silver bars
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:14.480]  out there but in this case they just didn't have a clue what it was worth and i did this specifically
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:20.720]  right in front of me 40 feet away from a coin shop and i would tell them we can go inside this
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:26.320]  coin shop that's been there for generations in this community and we can verify that this is real
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:32.560]  and as you'll see just person after person didn't want it not because they thought it was a scam
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:37.680]  but because to them it might as well have just been a chunk of steel or a block of wood
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:41.120]  yeah of course i say you know there's there could be a phony silver you know there's a
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:45.520]  lot of phony paper money out there isn't there mark i mean that's kind of the point let's roll a
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:51.680]  clip of that uh that video i'm mark dice standing outside this coin shop with a 10 ounce silver bar
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:56.800]  of pure silver bullion worth about 160 dollars where i'm going to try to sell it to random people
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:03.680]  for 10 dollars just to see if they know anything about silver having a special today it's a 10

[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:21.600]  plastic uh maybe maybe they would have been interested they wanted instant gratification
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:28.000]  no man i got my noodle bar got a a burger i want to get it like i said it within 60 seconds they
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:33.200]  could have walked into this coin shop and they could have walked out with 160 dollars approximately
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:38.880]  in cash i mean they would have verified that it was real in two seconds and it literally might as
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:44.400]  well have been a block of wood it's absolutely clueless you know i've done this with a gold coin
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:47.920]  but you know gold has fluctuated a few hundred dollars over the last few years but
[02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:52.080]  and i can't remember exactly what the price was but the gold coin was worth well over a thousand
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:57.280]  dollars 1300 to 1500 dollars doing the same thing trying to sell it for 20 bucks in front of the same
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:01.360]  coin shop and they just simply had no idea and it wasn't that they thought it was fake
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:06.160]  you know i think we got another video lined up here about banning gold coins yeah i bet if you
[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:10.640]  had asked them what the spot price of silver is they wouldn't have any idea what that was either
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:14.160]  they probably don't understand that our money was supposed to be backed by gold or silver either
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:18.720]  let's take a look at this video about banning gold and gold coins because you know we we've
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:24.320]  got to have that through reserve notes let's take a look at that video what we're doing is
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:32.160]  so many people have been buying and hoarding gold and that's really detrimental for the economy so
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:39.360]  we're just going to ban the possession of physical gold coins for the citizens and get that money
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:44.640]  back into the fort Knox and into the government's hands where it belongs so yeah thank you for
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:53.760]  supporting banning gold coins a lot of these people are hoarding their gold coins and we just
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:16:00.160]  are going to make them cash them in and that will stimulate the economy and put the gold back in
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:08.640]  the federal reserve vaults and birthday to ban the possession of physical gold coins that you
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:15.680]  don't need your gold coins the government needs the gold and so we've done this before and we're
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:22.800]  going to do it again thank you so much for supporting that what is wrong with these people
[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:29.840]  Obama wants us to cash in our gold i have a cash for gold program to stimulate the economy okay
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:37.120]  we just want to show support for that all right that just in the past we've had a mandatory
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:46.240]  cash for gold program a birthday and we're going to just have people turn in their gold coins and
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:52.160]  we're going to ban the the possession of gold you don't need your gold coins so thanks for
[02:16:52.160 --> 02:17:01.920]  supporting the banning of gold coins that's great that's just amazing work you know you get people
[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:07.680]  to do the most amazing things and of course people who don't know you know many people said
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:10.880]  americans today know the price of everything the value of nothing i don't know if these people
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:16.160]  even know the price of anything they certainly don't know the value of gold and silver and i
[02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:19.600]  guess they could care less that it's in our constitution you've got a couple of videos
[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:23.840]  we're going to show later probably the petition to repeal the first amendment the bill of rights
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:29.680]  i mean they don't they don't understand anything it seems like no these aren't stuges this isn't
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:35.360]  i mean i'm one level i guess it is satire because i'm presenting an insane position but these are
[02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:40.080]  real people just that are randomly walking down the beach and it shows a few different things i
[02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:44.640]  think that many people are just beyond ignorant they're just lost in an entertainment wasteland
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:49.920]  but they're also so manipulative or so manipulative bowl rather yes if somebody
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:55.840]  i present myself as a figure authority figure and in a commanding presence in a commanding
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:18:01.440]  voice i tell them what should be done and they they follow blindly along and this is the same
[02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:07.520]  psychological strategy that led to nazi germany you know exterminating millions of people murdering
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:14.000]  them on an industrial scale because the authority figures told them to do it said this is what needed
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:19.280]  to be done that's precisely what we were just talking about throughout the last hour i was talking
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:23.440]  about barbara low fisher of national vaccine information center of course it's in california
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:29.360]  where you're doing these men on the streets uh using authority figures using a guy taking the
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:34.000]  lead on this dr pan telling people that he's going to take away their informed consent and it's for
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:40.080]  their own good and they can't think through the issues they're not engaged they're not even understanding
[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:45.440]  what's going to happen to them they're turning themselves into slaves taking giving up their
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:52.240]  fundamental human rights of informed consent you know people are so easily manipulatable today
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:57.600]  it's astounding if you just tell them and most of these petition videos i start off by telling
[02:18:57.600 --> 02:19:03.440]  them people this is what obama wants or this is what's good for them and they i mean as we'll see
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:08.480]  later in the broadcast that they want to just repeal the bill of rights anything for obama
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:16.240]  you know put carcinogens in the water supply add infanticide to obama care that this is beyond
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:21.280]  idiocracy and this isn't just one or two different subjects i mean i'm looking back at all these
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:29.680]  videos i've produced over the last few years it's it's got to be 35 petition videos alone 35
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:35.120]  different insane anti-american ludicrous things that these people signed their name
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:39.840]  birthday and signature to approve exactly they just argue from authority and that's why i said
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:44.400]  when we saw this happening with a pope he's not arguing he's not making a scientific argument
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:49.360]  he's just arguing from authority and that's the argument about global warming they put this out
[02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:53.680]  there for the longest time said the majority of us agree well you know what the majority of them
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:57.200]  said the earth was flat at one point time stay with us we're going to be right back with mark

[02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:20.000]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host on this friday june 26 2015
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:25.680]  we're joined by mark dice and we've been looking at some of his funny petition videos it really
[02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:33.040]  kind of illustrates the ignorance of people but also the susceptibility of people to follow someone
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:36.800]  who is an authority as mark dice pointed out of course that's the thing that he does so well in
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:41.840]  these videos just egging them along gradually assuring them that they're doing the right
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:46.560]  things speaking from authority it was funny mark when i looked at this one of the things i was
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:51.040]  thinking about during the break when these people these last two videos we looked at you offered them
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:58.880]  a 10 ounce silver bar for $10 that was worth $160 that didn't want to make that exchange kind of
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:06.080]  reminded me of when my kids were little and they might have two one dollar bills and i might have
[02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:10.240]  two one dollar bills and they've got a five and i offer them would you like these two for that
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:16.480]  and it's like yes that's a good deal they have absolutely no idea of its worth they are like
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:22.720]  children it is incredible i mean the analogy of america being an idiocracy is completely accurate
[02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:29.200]  these people have an attention span of a goldfish they have the common sense of a five year old
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:34.160]  and just week after week and the man on the street monday segments i've been demonstrating it
[02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:38.640]  very thankfully info wars has been posting a lot of these videos the drudge reports been
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:43.680]  picking them up and and i think they resonate with so many people because those of us who
[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:49.680]  you know want to improve america those of us who are trying to be informed we look at these people
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:56.880]  and they're just a shame they're just a stain on this country of what was once the great united
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:04.480]  states of america and so hopefully through people sharing these videos many of the audience not this
[02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:08.320]  audience but you know people who share the videos on their facebook pages etc a lot of people stumble
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:13.280]  across them maybe almost as ignorant as the people in the videos and so hopefully it's planting seeds
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:20.240]  of common sense yes to pay attention to current events in history uh seeds to just kind of unplug
[02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:24.240]  yourself from the matrix and they're using this all the time i mean we see as you point out if you
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:29.680]  tell people this is for obama they'll do it that's why they had the pope come out and sign up for
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:35.280]  climate change because they want world government and that's what the scientist uh shellen hooper
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:40.240]  that was with him that's what he's been pushing for a very long time he wants a uh a world uh
[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:46.000]  constitute an earth constitution he wants a planetary council to enforce these regulations
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:52.000]  but of course the argument is from the authority of the pope and people don't ask what the scientific
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:56.080]  basis of this is they don't question his assumptions we're not allowed to look at the data or the
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:27:00.400]  models they don't understand what's involved here is simply an argument from authority whether it's
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:06.160]  the pope or whether it's obama it's always from authority you've got another uh petition where
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:12.000]  you ask people to sign uh the petition to see if they would support putting carcinogens in the
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.640]  water supply of course that's been happening maybe this may be you know i want to i want to add
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:21.680]  something it's also a celebrities as authority figures people blindly follow the celebrities
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:26.400]  oh yeah some of the some of the videos i've done one recently i just told people that biancé
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:30.080]  you know called for the repeal of the bill of rights and the first amendment and uh
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:35.840]  you know biancé wanted sharia law in the inner cities to help out with the minority communities
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:42.880]  and these people just as easily agreed and followed this and yeah we can replace the rule of law with
[02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:49.680]  twerking i guess you know that's we have some court work next you know there's next videos
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:55.680]  to add carcinogens which of course are cancer causing materials into the water supply which
[02:27:55.680 --> 02:28:02.240]  you know maybe could explain for the the vast idiocracy mental enslavement in america maybe
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:07.280]  they are consuming too many carcinogens their their brains have become toxified but here we
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:13.280]  have again it's just using keywords this is to help you this is what we need to have and i think
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:18.080]  we have one later lined up where i got people to sign a petition and i didn't even tell them
[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:24.400]  what it was for whatsoever nothing even remotely no issue nothing just this is for obama he needs
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:28.320]  you to sign i think we have that won't play on next let's play a little bit of this clip about
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:34.880]  the carcinogens in the water supply with obama care in effect the health care system is going to
[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:40.960]  cost the taxpayers a lot of money so a birth date there is so we're going to add some carcinogens
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:48.800]  to the water supply just so everybody gets a dose of carcinogens and yes signature to support adding
[02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:59.280]  the carcinogens thank you sir a lot of people don't get enough carcinogens and so uh we just figured
[02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:04.720]  you know we're gonna just get people to sign the petitions to to support adding the carcinogens
[02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:10.800]  thank you and have a good time drinking those carcinogens with with obama care going into effect
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:15.920]  but we just want to make sure to add the carcinogens to the water supply just to
[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:21.920]  keep people nice and healthy and yeah print there to we need more carcinogens so we're
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:26.320]  just going to add them to the water supply and then everybody can get a good even dose of it
[02:29:27.600 --> 02:29:33.200]  yeah that reminds me mark of a of a petition that uh leah macadoo did where she went around
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:38.960]  asked people to ban dihydrogen monoxide you know h2o otherwise known as water we're going to
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:43.280]  be right back with mark dice we're going to take a look at some more of these amazing petitions stay
[02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:54.560]  with us we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[02:29:54.560 --> 02:30:05.360]  network since 1949 the u.s department of agriculture has been demanding a portion of california's
[02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:10.400]  raisin crop without payment from the farmers they gave some to schools some they sold and
[02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:19.440]  kept the money 2002 farmers were told to hand over 89 000 tons of raisins 30 of their raisin crop
[02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:27.360]  medieval serfs typically paid only 10 in taxes rarely more than 15 the federal government treats

[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:13.840]  talking about some uh important interesting stuff by the way mark dice does it is with petitions and
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:20.480]  mark you had a petition that uh really kind of created a stir about asking people if they would
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:26.720]  support uh nuking china you had one about nuking russia that went pretty big but you've got another
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:33.120]  one here about nuking china tell us about that yeah well a few weeks ago it made international news
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:40.000]  the nuke russia petition yeah obviously many other countries probably the adults probably quite
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:44.880]  informed trying to you know improve their country and their communities but unfortunately in america
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:51.840]  we're in this phase of the cycle of civilizations where most people are just lackadaisical and
[02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:58.720]  lazy and have tuned out and so the petition to nuke russia for obama made quite an international
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:06.160]  buzz overseas angering and upsetting stunning many of the russians yeah somebody in russia
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:11.280]  did somebody in russia do a petition in russia and they found that the russian people did not
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:17.840]  say no let's go nuke the united states several different news agencies or journalists or youtubers
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:23.280]  did a similar petition asking russians to nuke americans and they were stunned i think maybe
[02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:28.480]  one or two people supported it most of them said this was the most ludicrous idea it doesn't solve
[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:34.560]  anything and you know it's one thing to sign a petition to support a piece of legislation that
[02:36:34.560 --> 02:36:39.840]  they might not be familiar with that's presented to them as if this is what obama wants but i want
[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:45.520]  to see how far would these people go what would they do what would they approve exactly they
[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:50.320]  would approve of starting a nuclear war with russia so i followed up to see you know let's
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:55.200]  start a nuclear war with china are the american people willing to support president obama launching
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:37:03.360]  a preemptive nuclear strike into china as a solution to the chinese hackers hacking into
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:06.720]  the american government's computer system oh yeah that sounds perfectly reasonable and
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:11.920]  improportional let's take a look at that petition president obama needs a few more signatures to
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:18.160]  support his nuclear response to the chinese hackers so we're just out here getting signatures for the
[02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:23.920]  white house i just needed a print birthday and a signature you know these hackers keep on
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:30.080]  hacking into our systems and so president obama wants to respond with a nuclear strike in beijing
[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:34.480]  yep and a signature there to support the nuclear strike it's really the only thing we can do to
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:39.440]  stop these hackers is to launch a nuclear attack okay thank you for supporting that appreciate that
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:43.840]  have a good nuclear winter obama supporter yeah dude oh yeah do you want to help us sign too
[02:37:46.240 --> 02:37:53.040]  i mean the chinese are always stealing our patents and now they're stealing our intellectual
[02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:58.320]  property and so yep birthday so and of course you got the obama shirt on so that makes all
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:05.120]  a nuclear message with a with a nuclear strike just as a final once and for all just to stop them
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:09.600]  okay thank you for supporting that i'm not necessarily that these people want to nuke china
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:14.560]  it's that they will just support whatever obama says so their brains just shut off when i say
[02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:21.040]  will you help support obama's plan brain shuts off and they'll do just about anything i say
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:27.520]  into our system and they've got now the names and the security clearances of every federal employee
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:34.480]  so we just need your support to to approve of president obama's response which includes a nuclear
[02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:42.320]  strike into beijing just prints right there birth date and a signature it's the nuclear response
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:47.680]  to the chinese hackers president obama says that's the only way we can stop them is to launch a
[02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:52.480]  nuclear strike into beijing so we just need a few more signatures to support that thank you so much
[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:56.880]  that guy i thought he was walking away from you there he didn't want to be involved but you drew
[02:38:56.880 --> 02:39:03.600]  him in there with that uh i was for obama didn't you the government system and yeah let's go back
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:08.240]  let's go back to mark that that's pretty amazing they will do anything and that that is what's so
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:13.600]  scary you talked about people doing signing up for things and maybe you could excuse it by saying
[02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:17.120]  that they're not familiar with those items you know actually you could make that argument here i
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:22.080]  guess because americans really aren't familiar with war most of them haven't seen it you know people
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:30.080]  in russia mark have experienced that i mean they have a family member who can tell them about that
[02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:34.160]  perhaps if they're older they experienced them themselves during world war two same thing in
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:39.840]  china i mean they've seen war they seem starvation they've seen government purges so they're not so
[02:39:39.840 --> 02:39:46.400]  anxious to pick a fight but americans really don't care do they americans love war it's entertainment
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:52.000]  for them it's the ultimate reality television that's true and you know in another future segment
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:56.560]  perhaps we can talk about the entertainment liaison office within the cia the department of
[02:39:56.560 --> 02:40:02.640]  defense which is an actual office for decades that works directly as a liaison with hollywood
[02:40:02.640 --> 02:40:08.880]  and this is where hollywood studios get the equipment like the tanks the helicopters aircraft
[02:40:08.880 --> 02:40:15.600]  carriers etc access to military bases to then include in big blockbuster hollywood movies
[02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:23.280]  as liberal hollywood is literally a propaganda outlet for the department of defense yes has
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:31.920]  script approval in order to loan this equipment to the hollywood studios at four uh propaganda
[02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:36.480]  purposes i have a uh had first hand experience with that a friend of mine from high school that
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:42.000]  was his job going out for the department of defense and and looking at people's scripts if they like
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:47.120]  them if they were friendly to the u.s. government portrayed the military in a positive light foreign
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:53.200]  policy in a positive light they get green lighted for massive amounts of equipment loaned to them
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:58.560]  let them use it for free that they could not afford in most cases to uh i mean it was a huge
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:02.240]  amount of money even if they could afford it on their budget they wouldn't want to do it if they
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:08.080]  can get it for free but you had to be a supporter of the american government's foreign policy
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:13.120]  unquestioningly if they didn't like what you were telling people you didn't get the subsidy i mean
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:19.200]  i could name names phil straub is the department of defense entertainment liaison chief officer
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:24.640]  and he literally has script approval he makes recommendations and changes to scripts before
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:31.200]  they sign off to loan this equipment which often includes access to military bases for
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:39.760]  locations to shoot and even thousands or hundreds of uniformed servicemen and women who then are
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:45.760]  extras in these hollywood movies yeah absolutely and you know there was a that's interesting stories
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:49.680]  and people are putting together a documentary i'd like to get an interview with them uh is the writer
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:54.160]  with no hands is the name of it have you heard of that uh is basically a guy who had done that
[02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:58.080]  sort of thing he had scouted out locations with the cia he had told the government's story
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:03.200]  he'd been a very successful writer he'd decided he wanted to direct his own film and he had a
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:11.200]  narrative that said that the uh invasion of um uh was it nicaragua uh not nicaragua what was
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:16.640]  the Panama yes thank you so you know about it yeah said that that was essentially an operation to
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:22.640]  recover uh sex tapes that they were using to blackmail people in the bush administration and
[02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:26.800]  he disappeared and they found him under some very mysterious circumstances so that kind of stuff
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:34.160]  uh happens and it comes back to bite a lot of people who actually work with the cia and the
[02:42:34.160 --> 02:42:39.200]  defense department yeah you know they're in the conspiracy community there's a lot of people that
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:44.000]  you know are under the impression that any celebrity that dies is a sacrifice by the
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:50.640]  illuminati and it's largely overblown but there are serious cases like this this script writer who
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:55.600]  was the screenwriter for raw deal of popular Arnold Schwarzenegger film back in the 1980s and
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:43:02.080]  his early career that's right and his film was going to cover some very controversial aspects of
[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:08.800]  us invasion of Panama and right after he completed his screenplay he disappeared they didn't find them
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:14.480]  for about a year or two years turned up dead with no hands and his laptop had the screenplay on it
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:21.200]  was never found and so you know this the sort of thing happens if somebody in a powerful position
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:26.240]  is not going to play ball sometimes they start pulling these dirty tricks and you know as a
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:31.200]  media analyst myself i have a bachelor's degree in communication the author of seven eight different
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:38.160]  books now i focus on the power of the media so many different issues to cover but the media is
[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:47.120]  such a powerful weapon it's it's a conditioning tool entertainment is education for many people
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:52.160]  and so you start uncovering these events of these screenwriters that have been murdered or coerced
[02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:57.280]  the cia working literally with Hollywood i mean this isn't a conspiracy theory by any means the
[02:43:57.280 --> 02:44:04.800]  cia.gov website has a section dedicated to the entertainment liaison office where they say
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:10.560]  that they welcome script writers and producers to work with them that's right there on their page
[02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:14.640]  you're absolutely right now you know we of course we have the presidential election coming up in
[02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:22.080]  2016 we've got a lot of republicans running i think pretty much uh you know i think probably
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:27.680]  getting close to 20 by now or certainly they will by the time they start uh and just one maybe two
[02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:32.400]  or three democrats but maybe we need some more people on the democrat side you had a petition
[02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:39.840]  to endorse uh carl marx for president in 2016 tell us about that again following in line with the
[02:44:39.840 --> 02:44:45.760]  anything for obama theme i just approached random beachgoers here in san diego and told them that
[02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:52.640]  president obama has endorsed carl marx the author of the communist manifesto they'll consider to be
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:59.920]  one of the founding fathers of communism who really was commissioned as a secretary by a secret
[02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:05.600]  society which he admits in the manifesto itself in the one of the prefaces to the german edition
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:12.400]  which i have the very copy that i read in college uh but i went and told these people that obama
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:19.200]  has endorsed carl marx his economic advisor which you know is true i mean obama is a is a communist
[02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:26.640]  as a marxist and but we still needed a hundred thousand signatures to make that happen i that's
[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:31.280]  a perfect fit his economic advisor let's take a look at that petition we're just gathering the
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:37.600]  signatures to get carl marx on the presidential ballots and so obama has been uh working with him
[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:45.360]  and applying his philosophy we figure we'll get carl marx to become the next president on the 2016
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:52.640]  ballot so we're just gathering signatures showing people will support carl marx for president thank
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:46:01.520]  you sir obama has been following the uh carl marx philosophies and so we just want to gather
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:09.600]  signatures to show that the american public are are behind obama and carl marx so you're
[02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:17.120]  signed a petition to support carl marx philosophy thank you so much carl marx yeah we're just helping
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:26.880]  obama continue the communist agenda okay so just following obama's footsteps and continue with the
[02:46:26.880 --> 02:46:32.400]  the great work that he's been doing so thank you for supporting carl marx for president okay
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:38.720]  that's great we're just let's come back uh yeah i guess at least maybe we could get him
[02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:44.640]  marx as a head of the federal reserve i don't you know that fit you know and i don't just
[02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:50.640]  you can see or you can hear if you watch the videos on youtube.com slash mark dice i mentioned
[02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:57.840]  the plan three times during every interaction it's not just hey will you support carl marx to
[02:46:57.840 --> 02:47:02.640]  to really pound it in to show that these people just have no brain and that they really do
[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:07.600]  approve these issues you can see i tell them hey will you support carl marx and then as they
[02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:13.040]  continue to sign it i just keep repeating over and over yay thanks for supporting carl marx
[02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:18.080]  you're supporting carl marx you're supporting a nuclear attack on a rush thank you for supporting
[02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:24.080]  the nuclear strike and this is how the holocaust happened this is how yeah you know that's true
[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:30.640]  thousands of people followed orders that are completely inhumane and completely insane
[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:37.120]  because there's something in the human psyche where they follow authority figures and you know this
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:42.880]  is what the the mildrum experiment decades ago illustrated when you know people in a supposed
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:48.720]  doctors they were all actors except for the the test subjects you know we're told to turn up the
[02:47:48.720 --> 02:47:54.000]  knob to shock people and they were screaming and pretending to be in pain and the doctor in the white
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:59.520]  lab coat the authority figure just kept telling them now it's okay just go they're fine go ahead
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:05.120]  and keep on shocking them and these these test subjects had no idea that this was just a big
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:10.480]  experiment they repeated that on they repeated that on uh french television as well you remember
[02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:16.480]  that they went out and and staged that on like a reality show for french television and and and
[02:48:16.480 --> 02:48:20.480]  they i mean they really staged it you know you they didn't just hear somebody screaming in the
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:25.360]  next room they made it look like this person was dying and they were in front of a television
[02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:30.800]  audience and it was just like the mildrum experiment when uh our reporters were at bill de berg
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:37.920]  uh rob do was talking to one of the uh german police officers and uh you know he said you know
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:42.640]  you're you're you're you're protecting the wrong people and keeping the wrong people away from them
[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:48.800]  he said uh we're just following orders and this is in a country that has had a lot of instruction
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:55.200]  about what went wrong under adolf hitler and yet to see a policeman saying that we just must follow
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:59.120]  orders and we always follow orders we never think and rob is trying to get him to think
[02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:03.680]  outside the box to thank for himself to you know to understand the moral implications of it it's
[02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:08.560]  like yeah you're okay but i gotta follow orders still there you're info wars bill de berg coverage
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:12.800]  is incredible and by the way i mean i i think you do a great job you know alex jones got some

[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:36.880]  announcement they can see that on on the website thank you so much uh you you interviewed some of
[02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:43.760]  these people too about carl marx didn't you mark yeah now we saw them you heard them sign the petition
[02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:50.080]  to agree with carl marx but i wanted to get some insight into their thinking process so i sort of
[02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:56.960]  did a follow-up and i went and i just approached them and i told them with a handheld microphone
[02:49:56.960 --> 02:50:03.120]  oh president obama's endorsed carl marx for his success or you think that's a good idea
[02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:09.040]  yeah let's play that clip carl marx has been an economic advisor to the obama administration
[02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:14.720]  for many years obamas decided to elevate him to the level of presidency full endorsement
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:21.840]  should we continue with that policy to lead us to the road of prosperity into the utopia we've all
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:31.360]  hoped for i feel if you all desire to we should that um if he decides to lead on and uh try to
[02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:36.960]  pick better decisions i feel he would continue with the marxist economic policies to lead us to
[02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:44.480]  the utopia that we've all really hoped for yeah obama has chosen carl marx the economic advisor
[02:50:44.480 --> 02:50:48.480]  that's amazing because they want they want their opinion put out there don't they mark so it's like

[02:52:08.960 --> 02:52:15.040]  were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so i refused probably

[02:53:00.800 --> 02:53:06.640]  computer i'm shopping for a new wallet mine is falling apart hey did you know there's a company
[02:53:06.640 --> 02:53:11.280]  called id stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing oh i didn't
[02:53:11.280 --> 02:53:16.080]  realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing what is that well apparently many
[02:53:16.080 --> 02:53:21.360]  of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called rfid the
[02:53:21.360 --> 02:53:26.480]  transmitter banking information to card readers when we pay unfortunately a bad guy can also get
[02:53:26.480 --> 02:53:30.800]  one of these readers and go around the city scanning people collecting their credit card numbers
[02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:36.080]  and personal information without us knowing it wow that sounds scary since you're getting a new
[02:53:36.080 --> 02:53:40.880]  wallet anyway you should definitely get an id stronghold shielded wallet are they more expensive
[02:53:40.880 --> 02:53:46.080]  no in fact i can get a shielded leather wallet from id stronghold dot com for the same price or
[02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:51.440]  less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores sounds great my wallet isn't falling apart
[02:53:51.440 --> 02:53:55.680]  yet but let me pick one out too i want to be protected and these wallets at id stronghold dot
[02:53:55.680 --> 02:54:11.760]  com look fantastic
[02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:16.240]  welcome back to the alex joe show on david night we've been talking to mark dice and we've been
[02:54:16.240 --> 02:54:22.160]  looking at these various petition videos of course the central theme as mark has pointed out is
[02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:27.440]  that people just want to do what authority figures tell them and of course and he's there
[02:54:27.440 --> 02:54:31.360]  with a petition in his hand he's kind of an authority figure especially if he's got an
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:36.720]  obama t-shirt on they take him as an obama supporter there's a lot of just blind partisanship
[02:54:36.720 --> 02:54:43.040]  as well as a kind of tribalism that goes out i want to play that last petition video but before
[02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:49.120]  we do i'd mark's got a new book the bill deberg group fact and fiction and of course we just had
[02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:55.120]  the bill deberg conference take place in austria about two weeks or so ago tell us about this book
[02:54:55.120 --> 02:55:03.040]  mark in years and it's incredible to see finally thanks to social media thanks to alternative
[02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:08.880]  media outlets like infowars dot com we've smoked the bill deberg group out of their hole somewhat
[02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:13.760]  getting some mainstream coverage but if you're new to this material or even if you've been following
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:18.000]  it for years you want to put together some of the pieces of the puzzle to see the history of the
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:24.480]  bill deberg group i've uncovered their tax returns their financial records and track their history
[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:29.280]  for the last 10 years you can pick up the bill deberg group facts and fiction and paperback
[02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:35.440]  from amazon.com or download any of my books inside the illuminati the illuminati facts and fiction
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:41.440]  onto your tablet or your e-reader and writing i'm a media analyst writing is one of my favorite
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:46.640]  things to do and i can't articulate this it's so difficult to verbally articulate a lot of this
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:52.880]  information and so i've spent the last 10 years writing seven different books on issues about
[02:55:52.880 --> 02:56:00.640]  the new world order the illuminati these kinds of you know secret society type of issues so
[02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:05.600]  you're interested you can pick up the book or check out my youtube channel for more petition
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:10.320]  videos and man on the street interviews and that's very important because you know we've gone from
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:16.240]  a long period where as you pointed out bill deberg group just didn't exist and now they readily admit
[02:56:16.240 --> 02:56:20.480]  they can't avoid that anymore they look stupid when they try to pretend that doesn't exist so they just
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:24.640]  say well it's totally benign it's just nobody's business you know it just happened to have this
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:32.960]  cordon of 10 kilometers around this hotel and an army of policemen to protect these guys who are
[02:56:32.960 --> 02:56:38.960]  you know heads of state and industry and banks and military all meeting together just totally
[02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:44.160]  innocent people need to understand that this is the core of these kind of secret agreements that
[02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:49.280]  are being rammed through right now with these trade treaties and if we try to fight these things just
[02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:54.240]  on the basis of well it's going to be bad for jobs we're tying both of our hands behind our back if
[02:56:54.240 --> 02:56:58.320]  we don't really understand where this is coming from it's very important for people to understand
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:57:03.680]  that and you can't tell me as a media analyst and as just a critical thinker that there hasn't
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:09.280]  been and continues to be a blackout in the American major mainstream media regarding the
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:14.720]  bill deberg group and in the bill deberg group facts and fiction I track the evolution of the
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:20.080]  cover-up and myself have personally called into the top-rated talk show hosts Sean Hannity,
[02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:26.400]  Rush Limbaugh, Lenbeck, etc. over the last few years and asked them just simple basic questions
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:31.520]  about the bill deberg group and they hung up they denied any knowledge they really
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:35.600]  knew that was great I saw that on Twitter I saw the one that you did with handy where you called
[02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:38.640]  him up and asked him about the bill deberg group I have no idea what you're talking about and
[02:57:38.640 --> 02:57:43.600]  because Hannity certainly knows what it's about he certainly has heard the word how are these guys
[02:57:43.600 --> 02:57:48.960]  with their finger on the pulse of politics with access to the top politicians and guests around
[02:57:48.960 --> 02:57:53.920]  the world how are they not informed about the bill deberg group well obviously they are obviously
[02:57:53.920 --> 02:57:58.960]  they're part of this cover-up to prevent the American people and people around the world
[02:57:58.960 --> 02:58:04.160]  from learning about this history so the bill deberg group they have some explaining to do
[02:58:04.160 --> 02:58:10.320]  about their 60-year-long cover-up and we have the documents from Hugh Gates Gill former labor
[02:58:10.320 --> 02:58:16.240]  party leader in his estate showing that they planned the European Union under mass secrecy it's
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:20.720]  astounding when you really look at the evidence and the EU currency as well exactly we don't have
[02:58:20.720 --> 02:58:24.560]  time to play more your videos we're out of time but they can go to mark dice.com I guess and find
