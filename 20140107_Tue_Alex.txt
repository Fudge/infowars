[06:11.420 --> 06:15.900]  adding it to the water symbol dumb down the host population that the
[06:15.900 --> 06:20.460]  parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride
[06:20.460 --> 06:24.340]  out of the water supply yet but we can help to get it out of our bodies I am
[06:24.340 --> 06:28.860]  extremely excited to announce the exclusive info wars line fluoride shield

[08:34.020 --> 08:37.900]  resistance you're listening to Alex Jones
[08:37.900 --> 09:02.740]  Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this worldwide Tuesday
[09:02.740 --> 09:11.500]  January 7th 2014 worldwide broadcast nuclear and chemical physicist Dr.
[09:11.500 --> 09:20.380]  Busbee will be joining us coming up later in the next hour for about 30
[09:20.380 --> 09:24.540]  minutes to give us an update on the increased radiation levels slamming
[09:24.540 --> 09:30.460]  into California and the rest of the West Coast all the way up into Canada and
[09:30.460 --> 09:36.740]  Alaska I am launching a team of reporters Jacarie Jackson Adon Salazar
[09:36.740 --> 09:42.140]  and others to the West Coast they're going to go to San Diego Los Angeles
[09:42.140 --> 09:48.660]  San Francisco and all the way up the coast to Seattle getting measurements
[09:48.660 --> 09:55.180]  every 50 to 100 miles there are obviously citizen journalists everywhere
[09:55.180 --> 09:59.140]  going out and getting readings some of which are 10 times normal levels on
[09:59.140 --> 10:03.660]  average in areas of San Francisco they found levels five times higher the
[10:03.660 --> 10:07.660]  county health department went out with their own the Geiger counters and found
[10:07.660 --> 10:11.740]  exactly the same numbers and we're going to send our reporters to near the same
[10:11.740 --> 10:17.020]  spot we're trying to find the same spots they mentioned and list in the news
[10:17.020 --> 10:21.300]  reports but then we're going to survey other areas first they're going to go
[10:21.300 --> 10:26.860]  to San Francisco then they're going to go up the coast north through northern
[10:26.860 --> 10:31.700]  California Oregon Seattle then they're going to fly back down to southern
[10:31.700 --> 10:38.620]  California and survey San Diego Los Angeles Long Beach right down to the
[10:38.620 --> 10:41.100]  border then they're going to come back to Austin so they're going to be gone a
[10:41.100 --> 10:46.540]  week and they're going to be popping in daily with reports animal nightly news
[10:46.540 --> 10:51.500]  giving us their findings with four different Geiger counters I bought five
[10:51.500 --> 10:54.660]  Geiger counters we're going to keep one here in Austin and do our own test of
[10:54.660 --> 11:01.500]  seafood it's really time to plunge into this and expose what's going on so Dr.
[11:01.500 --> 11:05.500]  Christopher Busby will be joining us at the start of the next hour and then
[11:05.500 --> 11:09.580]  William F. Jasper he was on with us about a month ago and he promised to come
[11:09.580 --> 11:14.380]  back in the new year to cover the convergence of global governance and
[11:14.380 --> 11:18.980]  how they transfer local and national and individual sovereignty to these
[11:18.980 --> 11:25.940]  unelected globalist corporate boards so that is coming up as well today we are
[11:25.940 --> 11:29.260]  going to have Leanne McAdoo pop in at the bottom of the hour for about ten
[11:29.260 --> 11:35.420]  minutes in downtown Austin at the corner of Cesar Chavez and Lavaca in front of
[11:35.420 --> 11:44.020]  the globalist agenda 21 command base known as the City Hall right out in
[11:44.020 --> 11:48.340]  front of the Willie Nelson statue we're going to have Leanne McAdoo out there
[11:48.340 --> 11:53.380]  with the group that is hunger striking into day nine now to draw attention to
[11:53.380 --> 11:58.540]  the deadly hydrofluorosalic acid or sodium fluoride that's being added to
[11:58.540 --> 12:03.140]  the water supply illegally under the Geneva Convention against forced
[12:03.140 --> 12:08.140]  medication and of course it causes lower IQs and Harvard studies you name it
[12:08.140 --> 12:13.180]  gives people pancreatic cancer bladder cancer kidney cancer bone cancer all the
[12:13.180 --> 12:16.740]  studies are on record it's incontrovertible all the EPA and FDA
[12:16.740 --> 12:20.700]  scientists literally the vast majority of them have gone public and try to get
[12:20.700 --> 12:24.260]  the government to change this they had new regulations two years ago ordering
[12:24.260 --> 12:30.780]  it to not be used in pesticides anymore it's so deadly and it bio accumulates in
[12:30.780 --> 12:35.620]  the plants so it is truly amazing that this this continues it is a eugenics
[12:35.620 --> 12:43.340]  program now that said ladies and gentlemen Chicago has smashed its all-time
[12:43.340 --> 12:51.700]  record cold temperature numbers that is being reported on by NBC Chicago also
[12:51.700 --> 12:56.540]  New York City breaks a hundred and eighteen year low Al Gore says it's
[12:56.540 --> 13:04.460]  caused by global warming average temp in the USA is 19.4 Fahrenheit or quite a
[13:04.460 --> 13:11.780]  few degrees below freezing what's freezing 32 on the Fahrenheit scale so
[13:11.780 --> 13:16.180]  that's a good 14 degrees under there all coldest air in many areas of the
[13:16.180 --> 13:21.900]  country in 20 years a hundred stranded overnight on snowbound Amtrak trains
[13:21.900 --> 13:27.100]  power demand sores Texas grid pushes to the edge because about a third of our
[13:27.100 --> 13:31.660]  power plants have been shut down by not even executive orders just global
[13:31.660 --> 13:37.980]  treaties circumventing Congress illegally so the dirty plants right over
[13:37.980 --> 13:42.620]  the border having to turn up their production in Mexico to all-time highs
[13:42.620 --> 13:47.140]  the Indianapolis mayor says you could die outside in 10 minutes you could
[13:47.140 --> 13:51.780]  quote be dead escaped inmate from the cold turns himself in climate change
[13:51.780 --> 13:56.160]  groups seek new leadership as movement loses steam it doesn't matter if it
[13:56.160 --> 14:00.940]  loses steam in Europe in the United States and in England they're shutting
[14:00.940 --> 14:06.260]  down the clean coal power plants even new plants that were built in Texas and in
[14:06.260 --> 14:12.780]  Wisconsin brand new plants some of them costing a billion dollars a piece the
[14:12.780 --> 14:17.660]  one in South Texas cost three billion dollars took seven years to build and
[14:17.660 --> 14:24.980]  it's been closed before it opened on completion there was a plant built up
[14:24.980 --> 14:30.220]  by Green Bay that cost close to a billion dollars to be owned by the state
[14:30.220 --> 14:36.580]  and the cities totally clean burning coal plant with the scrubbing systems you
[14:36.580 --> 14:39.060]  drive by a new coal plant you notice it's got like four or five buildings
[14:39.060 --> 14:41.980]  attached to it that's that's the scrubbers nothing comes out of it but
[14:41.980 --> 14:48.660]  water and carbon dioxide nothing so they list carbon dioxide as a pollutant the
[14:48.660 --> 14:55.980]  EPA does and you now cannot have that plant and so your electric cars get
[14:55.980 --> 15:00.180]  their power from coal 50 plus percent and your homes get it and so what's going
[15:00.180 --> 15:08.300]  to happen your power prices are going to what explode and it doesn't matter if
[15:08.300 --> 15:12.700]  it's discredited now I told you they were already doing this in Europe they
[15:12.700 --> 15:16.860]  banned the new production of space eaters three years ago they've banned the
[15:16.860 --> 15:21.140]  new construction in Germany and other countries under EU rules of single parent
[15:21.140 --> 15:27.100]  or a single family dwelling homes daddy mommy and the kids that is illegal to
[15:27.100 --> 15:32.700]  build new ones you can only live in basically new coffin buildings new
[15:32.700 --> 15:39.260]  coffin size 250 square foot systems San Francisco's doing it New York's doing
[15:39.260 --> 15:43.380]  it you can pay exorbitant prices and a special tax and get out of that bracket
[15:43.380 --> 15:46.620]  but only the elite can do it then they could take almost all your disposable
[15:46.620 --> 15:53.420]  income in tax so this is the bureaucrats have brought in austerity that's to
[15:53.420 --> 15:57.980]  make you so poor that they can siphon off 90% of what you make France is now
[15:57.980 --> 16:02.060]  doing this as well then they could take your tax money and build the robots to
[16:02.060 --> 16:05.660]  replace you in the factories the robots in the fields the robots to do the
[16:05.660 --> 16:10.140]  fighting the robots to do the flying and then you get it once we're fully locked
[16:10.140 --> 16:15.260]  down in coffin cities in coffin buildings in coffin apartments then the
[16:15.260 --> 16:21.340]  loving bio weapons are released and they're only building up the attacks
[16:21.340 --> 16:27.380]  right now testing their new viruses they admitted in the H1N1 shots they added
[16:27.380 --> 16:35.460]  the year before the H1N1 itself as a quote tracer virus and it wasn't a big
[16:35.460 --> 16:40.220]  scandal that oh secret testing in the flu vaccine it was a minor academic
[16:40.220 --> 16:45.740]  footnote that they put H1N1 out a year before and then designed it as a
[16:45.740 --> 16:51.620]  basic viral form of biological nanotech it's what they call it to mutate into
[16:51.620 --> 16:56.820]  H1N1 the next year I mean you're living in Buck Rogersville with total eugenics
[16:56.820 --> 17:00.060]  criminals doing whatever they want speaking of that here's a CBS news
[17:00.060 --> 17:04.700]  report you're about a little girl goes in to get her tonsils out and flesh
[17:04.700 --> 17:09.100]  eating bacteria eater brain report girl falls asleep at the 30 times a day
[17:09.100 --> 17:15.420]  ever getting flu shot and the insert says it can give you narcolepsy I know
[17:15.420 --> 17:19.780]  about I don't know seven or eight people some acquaintances some friends who
[17:19.780 --> 17:23.460]  didn't listen to me over the years and got the flu shot in Austin who now have
[17:23.460 --> 17:29.420]  narcolepsy and can't drive and epilepsy or Guillain berets are all three two of
[17:29.420 --> 17:33.220]  the people I know have Guillain beret they still have years later other their
[17:33.220 --> 17:37.060]  hands are numb their feet are numb it's not the really bad top where you stop
[17:37.060 --> 17:44.380]  breathing and then they fall asleep in traffic and they have seizures now it's
[17:44.380 --> 17:48.420]  just a wondrous new system I know a talk show host you had Guillain beret real
[17:48.420 --> 17:51.980]  bad for about a year he saw his little bit of it is his toes are numb and he
[17:51.980 --> 17:55.940]  still thinks I'm wrong though about it it's good to take the shot and have your
[17:55.940 --> 18:03.060]  feet your toes paralyzed it's good it's a good thing and I'm wrong you
[18:03.060 --> 18:07.900]  understand just like we're wrong about radiation increased levels being bad but
[18:07.900 --> 18:13.900]  I told you this was coming EPA proposes restrictions for new wood stoves they
[18:13.900 --> 18:17.100]  say they're above the law Supreme Court's rule that Congress can't affect
[18:17.100 --> 18:21.820]  them they can do whatever they want and so they're their dictators just as MSNBC
[18:21.820 --> 18:25.380]  pundit is now called an Obama to govern by decree that video clips coming up in
[18:25.380 --> 18:29.220]  the next segment and they said they're gonna cut the emissions you're allowed
[18:29.220 --> 18:34.620]  to put out of a fireplace or wood stove by 80% and this is already begun all
[18:34.620 --> 18:38.700]  over California we've gotten the calls and seen the little blurbs in the news
[18:38.700 --> 18:44.660]  or code enforcers come and give you tickets for your fireplace and they're
[18:44.660 --> 18:48.420]  sending armored vehicles out to rural areas all over California is the test
[18:48.420 --> 18:54.740]  and they show up with SWAT teams with no warrant and raid your house when they
[18:54.740 --> 18:58.580]  see smoke coming out to put a detector on it and say too much smoke's coming out
[18:58.580 --> 19:03.540]  there's not even a law they just it's kind of like we caught Austin giving
[19:03.540 --> 19:07.500]  mainly old people and then taking their property with $2,000 a day fines back in
[19:07.500 --> 19:13.860]  1997 there's a video of it on YouTube that we re-uploaded and again $2,000 a
[19:13.860 --> 19:18.980]  day fines for three-inch grass and when we mowed the old guys lawn who just had
[19:18.980 --> 19:23.700]  colon surgery for Roland Ellison and tried to reverse it they kept giving
[19:23.700 --> 19:26.700]  the tickets because we learned a realtor with the work with the city wanted
[19:26.700 --> 19:32.180]  his property it was a gent a gentrified area over off 37th Street West 37th
[19:32.180 --> 19:36.260]  was houses go for millions today and that they still gave them tickets they
[19:36.260 --> 19:41.220]  said well we just find that dead grass under that tree unacceptable because the
[19:41.220 --> 19:46.820]  city ordinance said weeds debris or anything that they find objectionable
[19:46.820 --> 19:51.980]  they are God your garden in the backyard is unacceptable your stoves are
[19:51.980 --> 19:56.540]  unacceptable they're going to ban everything they're coming for you they're not

[23:53.500 --> 24:18.180]  confiscation.com which side are you on we reported on this last year David night
[24:18.180 --> 24:22.620]  before I moved down to North Carolina was working with a free market group
[24:22.620 --> 24:27.060]  and investigations and ended up being national news when they discovered that
[24:27.060 --> 24:32.580]  universities under EPA grants were pumping massive levels of particulates
[24:32.580 --> 24:40.220]  secretly in on to students in the test to make them ill to then claim that an
[24:40.220 --> 24:45.420]  incredibly low level of particulate is bad for you well obviously particulates
[24:45.420 --> 24:48.980]  aren't great for you obviously if you go out camping for a week and sit around a
[24:48.980 --> 24:55.300]  campfire you might cough some all secondhand smoke isn't good for you but
[24:55.300 --> 25:00.500]  they're going to use this to shut down people being able to have their own
[25:00.500 --> 25:04.700]  wood stoves and be self-sufficient and there's massive studies about how
[25:04.700 --> 25:09.060]  potash going into the atmosphere helps create rain helps fertilize how the
[25:09.060 --> 25:12.140]  carbon dioxide is good for the atmosphere it's what plants breathe but
[25:12.140 --> 25:15.180]  obviously it's not good for you to sit there and huff it and breathe that it
[25:15.180 --> 25:20.140]  point blank range living is dangerous too much Sun is bad for you and they
[25:20.140 --> 25:24.100]  want to make it illegal to suntan cast Sunstein the White House regulations are
[25:24.100 --> 25:29.900]  if you don't get Sun you'll die even faster can't live with it can't live
[25:29.900 --> 25:34.620]  without it look at this EPA proposes restrictions for new wood stoves Fox
[25:34.620 --> 25:39.420]  News and the issue is they propose it have a public comment and then they just
[25:39.420 --> 25:45.380]  go oh we're not going to implement the 80% reduction it'll only be 50 and then
[25:45.380 --> 25:51.220]  the bureaucrats and it's already begun come after you they're going to ban the
[25:51.220 --> 25:56.300]  space heaters you see outside that have natural gas in them totally clean what
[25:56.300 --> 26:01.500]  do you think makes the atmosphere the volcanoes and the water and the cycle we
[26:01.500 --> 26:06.780]  need fire we need they try to stop all the wildfires around the country they
[26:06.780 --> 26:10.660]  won't let them do the fire breaks so the town's burned down but then they'll go
[26:10.660 --> 26:14.220]  out and leave all the dead wood out there and then go fight it once giant
[26:14.220 --> 26:18.460]  fires you're supposed to have fires burning down large areas of wilderness
[26:18.460 --> 26:21.740]  to then replenish the nitrogen and other things of the soil again they're
[26:21.740 --> 26:26.580]  taking normal actions and banning it and restricting it but then they're
[26:26.580 --> 26:30.380]  genetically engineering the and releasing salmon to the ocean that are
[26:30.380 --> 26:33.540]  four times the size of the others and will breed out all the other salmon
[26:33.540 --> 26:41.020]  within five generations oh that's five years that's already begun they are
[26:41.020 --> 26:45.300]  just doing every psycho thing you can imagine nuclear reactors leaking
[26:45.300 --> 26:50.100]  everywhere all sorts of corruption all the weapons they've produced all the
[26:50.100 --> 26:54.020]  nuclear weapons and then EPA proposes restrictions for new wood stoves the
[26:54.020 --> 26:57.700]  federal environmental protection agency has proposed new standards for wood
[26:57.700 --> 27:01.540]  stoves that would reduce the maximum amount of fine particular emissions
[27:01.540 --> 27:07.180]  allowed for new stoves sold in 2015 2019 but then with it comes the harassment
[27:07.180 --> 27:11.260]  they've already banned selling them in Europe first they do this just like the
[27:11.260 --> 27:16.220]  light bulbs have been banned and then they keep phasing it in maximum missions
[27:16.220 --> 27:21.460]  would be reduced by one-third next year by 80% in the five years fine
[27:21.460 --> 27:24.900]  particular pollution is made of solid particles and liquid droplets that
[27:24.900 --> 27:29.740]  measure 2.5 micrograms in diameter or less the EPA currently certifies non
[27:29.740 --> 27:34.100]  catalytic wood stoves if they produce less than 7.5 grams of fine
[27:34.100 --> 27:39.700]  particular per hour and it says this could be you know breathed and could be
[27:39.700 --> 27:43.220]  linked to heart attacks decreased lung function yeah when they pumped
[27:43.220 --> 27:47.540]  particularly in without people knowing it at more than a hundred times safe
[27:47.540 --> 27:53.660]  levels we exposed they've not already worked here when this happened we broke
[27:53.660 --> 28:01.180]  this last year and told you they were coming with all this meanwhile ladies
[28:01.180 --> 28:04.500]  and gentlemen five times the radiation has been confirmed by the San
[28:04.500 --> 28:07.780]  Francisco Health Department we're going to send our reporters there to talk to
[28:07.780 --> 28:11.460]  them and they're like oh we don't know what it is we don't know if it came from
[28:11.460 --> 28:15.540]  Fukushima they can go look at those isotopes they can do the test
[28:15.540 --> 28:19.740]  inexpensively and they can tell where it came from and you know where the stuff
[28:19.740 --> 28:24.700]  that hit two and a half years ago Fukushima came from Fukushima Berkeley
[28:24.700 --> 28:27.420]  and others did the test of what was in the rainwater they were collecting other
[28:27.420 --> 28:31.900]  things and found in some cases five ten fifteen times the level of different
[28:31.900 --> 28:37.980]  isotopes generally two to three times the government found out about what was
[28:37.980 --> 28:42.420]  happening with yellowfin tuna full of radiation and decided not to tell the
[28:42.420 --> 28:50.460]  public till a year later this is the insanity and it's up on info wars calm
[28:50.460 --> 28:55.980]  and prison planet calm and there's new breaking news about snow in the Midwest
[28:55.980 --> 28:59.500]  having high levels of radiation we're going to be covering that's up on drudge
[28:59.500 --> 29:04.900]  report comm on the right hand side it's an article that Paul Watson put out last
[29:04.900 --> 29:10.340]  night meanwhile scientists discovered conjoined gray whale calves dying near
[29:10.340 --> 29:15.140]  west coast scientists have never seen that before it's incredible photos of
[29:15.140 --> 29:22.420]  the whales with two tails and it's two heads it's just truly monstrously sad
[29:22.420 --> 29:26.980]  we're gonna break all that down play the clip where MSNBC pundit calls an
[29:26.980 --> 29:31.380]  Obama to govern by decree well they already are and the bureaucracy already
[29:31.380 --> 29:36.980]  is oh we're not worried about five times the radiation we're not worried about
[29:36.980 --> 29:41.820]  huge groups of debris from Fukushima about to reach the coast we're worried
[29:41.820 --> 29:46.740]  about your wood stove you turn on once a month we're gonna ban your fireplace

[35:22.340 --> 35:25.900]  paid for by other third world dictatorships on record that pay for much
[35:25.900 --> 35:29.060]  of its programming we know that because of Amber Lyon blowing the whistle and
[35:29.060 --> 35:37.700]  others. The host is there criticizing Kim Jong-un the stunted demonic Supreme
[35:37.700 --> 35:41.940]  narcissist who has a seven-story pleasure palace and has his uncle fed to
[35:41.940 --> 35:48.180]  wild dogs and has his ex-girlfriend shot and uses mortars himself to execute his
[35:48.180 --> 35:54.020]  enemies who are chained up to polls and you look at the crazed eyes of the
[35:54.020 --> 35:57.260]  ruling class there and how evil they look and how evil they act and how
[35:57.260 --> 36:03.340]  brainwashed the public looks that's a government that's your total state that's
[36:03.340 --> 36:08.540]  psychopaths ruling and isn't it perfect that some child emperor third
[36:08.540 --> 36:15.700]  generation communist royalty authoritarian hereditary dictator in the
[36:15.700 --> 36:22.420]  hermit nightmare dark-age Stalinist hell pit that is North Korea for all you
[36:22.420 --> 36:26.660]  that love socialism and all communism and all its great failures all of you
[36:26.660 --> 36:30.500]  that are threatened by the individual threatened by liberty and the animating
[36:30.500 --> 36:35.700]  contest of freedom you want to make us all join your trendiness this is what it
[36:35.700 --> 36:39.580]  is play a little bit of the video just for a moment just just just without the
[36:39.580 --> 36:46.860]  audio just to see just to see for TV viewers watching on prisonplanet.tv the
[36:46.860 --> 36:52.620]  ignorance of Dennis Rodman the admitted drug addict idiot the trendy with all of
[36:52.620 --> 36:57.660]  his moron followers around him acting arrogant defending Kim Jong-un Dennis
[36:57.660 --> 37:05.540]  Rodman's been bankrupt repeatedly is known to be a complete moron washed up
[37:05.540 --> 37:14.340]  washed up wash up and there he is with a narcissistic insane asylum North
[37:14.340 --> 37:20.220]  Korean dictator and when you watch the film of them watching a baseball or
[37:20.220 --> 37:24.860]  basketball game all the dictators stand around looking all the dictators
[37:24.860 --> 37:30.900]  minions stand around just staring at Rodman and him glowing on narcissistic
[37:30.900 --> 37:36.540]  power trips to be on TV worldwide and to be with Dennis Rodman I mean that's how
[37:36.540 --> 37:42.460]  disconnected they are that I've hung out with you know his ex-wife Carmen
[37:42.460 --> 37:46.640]  Electra before at dinner in Los Angeles and she seemed nice but not all that
[37:46.640 --> 37:50.780]  smart and I wasn't that impressed I sure don't care about hanging out with her
[37:50.780 --> 37:55.580]  and I really you couldn't pay me to hang around with somebody like Dennis
[37:55.580 --> 38:10.300]  Rodman you couldn't pay me to be around that I mean that's how vapid and shallow
[38:10.300 --> 38:16.100]  it is that these people whether they're Hollywood or whether they're US
[38:16.100 --> 38:20.340]  politicians or dictators they're a bunch of shallow sociopathic control freaks
[38:20.340 --> 38:27.100]  or sometimes psychopaths who are control freaks and are empty nobody's and it
[38:27.100 --> 38:32.340]  just shows how when you worship the latest fad the latest movie star the
[38:32.340 --> 38:39.500]  latest music icon that the media pushes Justin Bieber or whatever it is when you
[38:39.500 --> 38:42.860]  follow that because everybody says follow it and you think you're buying
[38:42.860 --> 38:46.020]  into something that makes you successful later you know how dumb it is
[38:46.020 --> 38:49.540]  like Britney Spears been washed up for years it's a joke Michael Jackson it's a
[38:49.540 --> 38:54.300]  joke but the current ones people won't admit it's a joke but look at narcissism
[38:54.300 --> 39:01.340]  where they're worshiping Dennis Rodman in North Korea and he's a total joke here
[39:01.340 --> 39:07.300]  in the United States and we have to negotiate with a hereditary third
[39:07.300 --> 39:13.780]  generation dictator as an ambassador it's Dennis Rodman the joke this is what a
[39:13.780 --> 39:20.020]  joke big government is this is what a joke big combines and monopolies are when
[39:20.020 --> 39:23.780]  they're not free-market and didn't gain their success through competitiveness
[39:23.780 --> 39:27.380]  this is what we've become
[39:28.540 --> 39:31.980]  turn up some of the volume then we're going to our street coverage of the
[39:31.980 --> 39:37.140]  fluoride event because it just sounds so incredibly mindless it is so so
[39:37.140 --> 39:44.780]  insane so off-the-chart so bizarre so pathetic and just illustrates how people
[39:44.780 --> 40:01.940]  are literally do you have to take the abuse we're gonna take one day one day
[40:01.940 --> 40:14.180]  ooh this door's gonna open because these ten guys here all of us Christy and
[40:14.180 --> 40:21.860]  Dennis Charles all these I mean everybody here we could just open the door
[40:21.860 --> 40:28.340]  just a little bit for people to come here and do one thing I just can't handle
[40:28.340 --> 40:33.740]  it get it off but then the CNN scum that are worse than Dennis Rodman worse than
[40:33.740 --> 40:36.860]  Kim Jong-un because they're trying to wreck America they want to turn it into
[40:36.860 --> 40:40.020]  that I mean you can have a wood-burning stove in North Korea you're not gonna be
[40:40.020 --> 40:44.740]  able to have one here they get to their shake their heads and all feel good when
[40:44.740 --> 40:49.700]  they are all just as complicit in funding al-Qaeda supporting al-Qaeda
[40:49.700 --> 40:54.260]  promoting new world order garbage it's incredible now shifting gears Lee and
[40:54.260 --> 40:59.620]  McAdoo is downtown and she'll be down there every day this week doing live
[40:59.620 --> 41:04.420]  coverage here on the syndicated radio broadcast braving the record warm
[41:04.420 --> 41:11.420]  temperatures of global warming if you just pay Al Gore money he a carbon tax
[41:11.420 --> 41:15.220]  and don't let people have cheap electrical power or shut down their
[41:15.220 --> 41:19.820]  their their wood-burning stoves it would not be so hot right now she's down there
[41:19.820 --> 41:25.940]  it's about a hundred and ten degrees like the equator here in Austin and she
[41:25.940 --> 41:32.700]  is down there wearing gloves in the middle of this heat wave I guess about
[41:32.700 --> 41:37.820]  20 degrees out there with some folks that have come down there to be part of
[41:37.820 --> 41:42.100]  the hunger strike we want to see those numbers grow throughout the week ladies
[41:42.100 --> 41:46.740]  and gentlemen for a group that is protesting the fluoridation of water
[41:46.740 --> 41:54.500]  five years after we bring scientists and researchers and toxicologists and
[41:54.500 --> 42:00.820]  PhDs to speak to this city they ignore us they spend over a million dollars a
[42:00.820 --> 42:05.260]  year to put in our water that reduces IQ gives you bone cancer on record Harvard
[42:05.260 --> 42:09.060]  studies you name it but it doesn't matter they keep putting it in there
[42:09.060 --> 42:14.420]  because they love us they love us they care about us their liberals and so Lee
[42:14.420 --> 42:18.040]  Ann I'm surprised that you're not you know that you're not wearing lighter
[42:18.040 --> 42:22.260]  clothes out there during the heat wave how's everybody handling the heat wave
[42:22.260 --> 42:27.340]  out there you know it feels great out here today it could be the five shirts
[42:27.340 --> 42:31.820]  and two pairs of pants I'm wearing but you know I'm feeling good we are getting
[42:31.820 --> 42:35.900]  a big crowd out here right now some patriots and lovers of liberty in
[42:35.900 --> 42:40.340]  America so many trucks are driving by honking we're getting a lot of support
[42:40.340 --> 42:44.620]  today that's and that's what it takes when we get people standing out here and
[42:44.620 --> 42:48.620]  showing that this is important to us and bringing light to this issue while the
[42:48.620 --> 42:52.540]  elite sit up there in their ivory tower and look down on us that they see this
[42:52.540 --> 42:58.220]  group is growing we're getting fed up I'm out here with Jason and Nicholas you
[42:58.220 --> 43:03.620]  guys you're on day nine day nine of your hunger strike you spent the coldest
[43:03.620 --> 43:07.700]  night of the year record-breaking temperatures last night you spent it
[43:07.700 --> 43:14.140]  outside how are you feeling today I'm feeling thrilled that the sun is out
[43:14.140 --> 43:18.100]  and shining there's no clouds it's a clear sky there's not even fake clouds
[43:18.100 --> 43:24.820]  it's just complete blueness and it's warm and how about you Nicholas refresh
[43:24.820 --> 43:28.140]  it was really good to get some good sleep last night we doubled up on sleeping
[43:28.140 --> 43:31.620]  bags so we actually stayed pretty warm it wasn't too bad got some face masks from
[43:31.620 --> 43:36.340]  supporters it was really nice all right I want to have Josh who's out there or
[43:36.340 --> 43:41.060]  or is it John bound with you pan around and show the crowd that's behind you
[43:41.060 --> 43:45.620]  because I heard them I heard them cheering earlier and I tell folks to
[43:45.620 --> 43:54.900]  cheer for getting the deadly poison out of our water come on folks yeah that's
[43:54.900 --> 43:58.740]  awesome and again I hear a lot of trucks honking we need more people to show up
[43:58.740 --> 44:03.540]  down there and everybody needs to be down there tomorrow at 12 30 is when we
[44:03.540 --> 44:08.580]  need people to come out as well against fluoride and who's this young man I've
[44:08.580 --> 44:13.180]  got a thought criminal right here this is Alex Cobb and he might be given little
[44:13.180 --> 44:18.180]  Jones a run for his money in his show of patriotism here why why do you want to
[44:18.180 --> 44:25.500]  let the world know what's wrong with fluoride because we don't want our pets
[44:25.500 --> 44:34.500]  drinking poison exactly that's a good angle with the trendies explain that
[44:34.500 --> 44:38.140]  it really hurts animals because the trendies hey humans but if we explain
[44:38.140 --> 44:41.300]  it's being done to dogs and cats now that's an idea go ahead let's see your
[44:41.300 --> 44:50.380]  signs he's got his little homemade sign it says there's poison in our water we
[44:50.380 --> 44:54.980]  don't want our pets to drink poison and this guy actually just schooled me and
[44:54.980 --> 44:59.500]  he recited some of the the amend the bill of rights he gave me my amendments
[44:59.500 --> 45:04.460]  doing his thing guys why are you out here what do you think about the poison
[45:04.460 --> 45:09.340]  tap water I think it's horrible it we're being forcibly medicated it's just
[45:09.340 --> 45:13.900]  absolutely horrible I don't know why they're doing it I mean it's because I
[45:13.900 --> 45:18.460]  love us what is that stop as they love you they hate us actually they hate
[45:18.460 --> 45:22.900]  humanity it's I mean there's Harvard studies that have proven that it's
[45:22.900 --> 45:27.420]  lowering IQs it's giving us all sorts of cancers I don't know why it's in there
[45:27.420 --> 45:32.860]  I mean who can explain to us I want to have a conversation with the city
[45:32.860 --> 45:36.380]  council members why aren't they out here talking to us and they haven't answered
[45:36.380 --> 45:40.540]  any questions about why there's Florida you know that's a good idea I think
[45:40.540 --> 45:43.780]  everybody's who stay out there till noon and then it's your city it's your city
[45:43.780 --> 45:48.060]  council you should all go into the city building and try to go to their offices
[45:48.060 --> 45:52.620]  and talk to them Lee and you could pop in at the bottom of the next hour you and
[45:52.620 --> 45:56.340]  John Bowne and you could go in and demand to talk to Mayor Lee lefting
[45:56.340 --> 46:00.660]  well exactly well the city council they they're quite aware that these guys are
[46:00.660 --> 46:03.660]  out here that they're on day 9 of their hunger strike and they're pretty much
[46:03.660 --> 46:07.220]  just put their blinders up they don't want to draw any attention to the fact
[46:07.220 --> 46:12.140]  that people in America are on a hunger strike I mean that is unheard of it's
[46:12.140 --> 46:19.300]  just like when the guy self-emolied it on the emulated on the law emulation I
[46:19.300 --> 46:22.780]  think the word I can't even say it and the mainstream media was like oh some guy
[46:22.780 --> 46:27.740]  just set himself on fire at the DC Memorial today no this is real people
[46:27.740 --> 46:31.420]  in America are getting tired it doesn't matter how much fluoride you put in our
[46:31.420 --> 46:34.780]  water you're not gonna make us all docile we're not gonna sit around we're not
[46:34.780 --> 46:39.740]  gonna take it anymore this is what we need to show these people this have you
[46:39.740 --> 46:47.020]  seen the warning label yeah have you seen the warning label or hydrofluor
[46:47.020 --> 46:50.860]  hey wait a minute that's how they shut down a lot of the things in Tennessee in
[46:50.860 --> 46:54.460]  places whenever they're sick and tired of trying to raise taxes we should ask
[46:54.460 --> 46:57.980]  all the truck drivers on I-35 and everybody else I know you're getting
[46:57.980 --> 47:01.780]  gouged you can barely afford the gas they got police checkpoints a white
[47:01.780 --> 47:05.020]  glove inspecting you we need all the truckers everybody else to go drive
[47:05.020 --> 47:12.060]  around the city headquarters the city hall to drive around Caesar Chavez and
[47:12.060 --> 47:17.580]  Lovaca in circles honking their horns until five o'clock even if you're on the
[47:17.580 --> 47:21.180]  other side of town folks just come do it randomly at different times do four or
[47:21.180 --> 47:25.460]  five circles honking let's do it right now everybody start driving around in
[47:25.460 --> 47:30.620]  circles honking around the building to let the criminals inside know we're not
[47:30.620 --> 47:34.660]  gonna put up with them paying mafia groups to put one million one hundred
[47:34.660 --> 47:39.380]  thousand dollars a year of deadly poison in the water from communist China go
[47:39.380 --> 47:45.380]  ahead leon macadam exactly we're we are paying eight hundred thousand dollars a
[47:45.380 --> 47:48.620]  year for the city of Austin to put hydrofluorosalistic as they must have
[47:48.620 --> 47:52.500]  lowered the price well that's a deal then yeah yeah if you I feel like we're
[47:52.500 --> 47:56.260]  paying them to only put point seven parts per million in the water and not
[47:56.260 --> 48:00.220]  any more if you look at the warning label for those over on the radio you
[48:00.220 --> 48:04.220]  can you can we we've actually tweeted this out at the info wars reports if
[48:04.220 --> 48:07.900]  you're on Twitter you can see the warning label it says poison it's got the
[48:07.900 --> 48:11.620]  skull and bones do not take internally avoid contact with skin eyes mouth
[48:11.620 --> 48:16.460]  clothing avoid breathing use rubber gloves respirators all that and then up
[48:16.460 --> 48:21.500]  here in the small print in the corner directions for water fluoridation what
[48:21.500 --> 48:26.340]  that is insane how do they get away well they say don't swallow any of the
[48:26.340 --> 48:30.500]  toothpaste or call poison control immediately then it becomes obvious it's
[48:30.500 --> 48:34.860]  a poison only take a little bit every day so you'll quietly die later and no
[48:34.860 --> 48:39.420]  one will know why exactly and there's there are groups that are working here
[48:39.420 --> 48:43.180]  to try and get the city to put a warning label on the water and that's one
[48:43.180 --> 48:47.500]  good first step but this is a this is an election here this is a time for people
[48:47.500 --> 48:52.140]  to really take a stand and let our representatives know that if they are
[48:52.140 --> 48:55.260]  not actually representing us we're getting to get them out of there we're
[48:55.260 --> 48:58.660]  voting them out and I totally agree and again this is bigger than Austin bigger
[48:58.660 --> 49:03.100]  than the US in Europe in Canada in Australia they're removing the fluoride
[49:03.100 --> 49:06.740]  out of the water in major cities then the feds are coming in and paying
[49:06.740 --> 49:10.860]  millions of dollars in lobbying in the case of Tampa to put the fluoride back
[49:10.860 --> 49:15.060]  in now they're voting to remove it again the battle goes back and forth but
[49:15.060 --> 49:19.420]  resistance is a victory tell folks I want to hear their victory roar against
[49:19.420 --> 49:29.900]  those criminals inside there all right pan around more people are starting to
[49:29.900 --> 49:33.700]  show up out there what are there about 20 people out there Leanne I'd say they're
[49:33.700 --> 49:37.260]  about 30 now we've actually got some people passing out flyers on opposite
[49:37.260 --> 49:41.460]  corners so we can hit up all the cars that are it's a kind of a five way
[49:41.460 --> 49:44.980]  you're engaging in First Amendment that should be banned how dare you that's
[49:44.980 --> 49:52.380]  what we're doing here we are addressing redressing for our grievances yeah I
[49:52.380 --> 49:56.580]  want big trucks driving in circles around there laying on their horns and
[49:56.580 --> 50:00.580]  then I want them and if people do this all day just truck drivers as you come
[50:00.580 --> 50:05.620]  down by downtown do five circles if you're on I-35 anywhere and and citizens
[50:05.620 --> 50:09.140]  you name it driving circles around there let's start honking and then let's do
[50:09.140 --> 50:14.220]  it all tomorrow let's converge at 12 30 noon with your cars to drive for at
[50:14.220 --> 50:18.700]  least 10 minutes around it honking to let the scum inside know that we're
[50:18.700 --> 50:22.660]  aware of their criminal activities and it's so encouraging to all of our
[50:22.660 --> 50:25.940]  listeners that are driving by people that are slowly trickling in it is so
[50:25.940 --> 50:29.980]  encouraging when you're standing out here nine days of a hunger strike at
[50:29.980 --> 50:33.580]  first just started out you two you know they were just sitting here you know by
[50:33.580 --> 50:37.900]  themselves and you ran into them Leanne yeah and now look at this the crowd is
[50:37.900 --> 50:41.380]  slowly growing it's only gonna encourage these guys who are planning on being out
[50:41.380 --> 50:46.300]  here on a hunger strike until the 23rd of January so that they can go to the
[50:46.300 --> 50:50.140]  first city council meeting and bring this up which I'm pretty sure the city
[50:50.140 --> 50:55.020]  council plans on trying to ignore this and not sure I want to talk to more of
[50:55.020 --> 50:58.580]  the people when we come back how dare her say fluoride's bad radiations good
[50:58.580 --> 51:04.860]  to introducing pro one all of your filtration in one system portable on
[51:04.860 --> 51:09.980]  the go no more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride
[51:09.980 --> 51:14.900]  you have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydro
[51:14.900 --> 51:18.900]  fluorosolicic acid advanced manufacturing technology combines silver
[51:18.900 --> 51:23.980]  impregnated white ceramic with new aqua medics advanced media a removal of
[51:23.980 --> 51:28.300]  fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element it is the only one
[51:28.300 --> 51:32.860]  that does it and out of the gates we have a discounted at 10% off with promo

[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:22.940]  Alex Jones
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:39.380]  all right we're now into our number two we've got Dr. Busbee joining us at the
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:45.580]  start of the next segment to get into the five-fold radiation increase being
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:50.580]  picked up and confirmed by California health departments that is coming up at
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:56.660]  the start of the next segment that when he leaves at about 40 after or so I will
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:02.100]  then get into the Obamacare news the smartphone news that it's been
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:06.140]  proven in studies to be interrupting your sleep and I'm gonna explain how it's
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:10.140]  doing that not just the texting or the messages coming in buzzing and waking you
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:13.300]  up I noticed this years ago and so put the phone out of the room or turned it
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:18.900]  off but it's also when the towers are checking with it pinging it's it's
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:24.100]  sending in microwave radiation enough to actually stimulate the brain and to
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.980]  disrupt your sleep patterns that's what wireless is doing as well and we're just
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.860]  hammered by it at every level so we're gonna be looking into that and the
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:38.020]  record-cold temperatures all across the United States this story I've mentioned
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:42.060]  but I want to get into this now MSNBC pundit calls an Obama to govern by
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:45.700]  decree they're already governing by decree with banker bailouts and wars
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:50.860]  and carbon taxes and all the rest of it academic who compared Eric Holder to
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:57.260]  Moses demands a raft of executive orders MSNBC pundit Michael Eric Dyson has
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:01.180]  called on Obama to dispense with the obstruction as Congress and instead
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:05.100]  pursue his agenda being aggressive raft of executive orders well you can't do
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:09.780]  that but he is already doing that so remember Obama five years ago would say
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:12.820]  now I got to follow the law I can't do whatever I want and well I wish I didn't
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:18.180]  have to do I'll do whatever I have to and if they can set the precedent Obama
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:25.900]  will leave office probably but the precedent will be set to be able to
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:30.820]  have presidents basically be dictators and that's what's being done here so
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:35.700]  here is a clip of that this president has the bully pulpit he has the will of
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:39.340]  the American people so many of us who stand behind him and I think that he's
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:43.180]  got a church forward now it's true that this do nothing obstruction as Congress
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.660]  on the one hand can tie his hand but there are enough executive orders he can
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:51.340]  achieve on one hand and also getting out there rallying the troops so to speak
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:56.540]  using the brilliant oratorical skills he has to be able to enliven edify and
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:03:02.700]  encourage American citizens to go to the polls rally the idiot supporters who
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:10.100]  went and tried to sign up in the exchanges and it's so expensive that you
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:13.020]  will never when you came and sign up most of the time but if you can it's double
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:17.780]  triple quadruple or five times the cost in some cases rally the idiot troops
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:21.980]  who've already been absolutely bamboozled and again I'm not saying John
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:26.660]  McCain would have been good or even Mitt Romney the point is is that the selected
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:31.780]  one that the establishment wanted was Obama the media the big banks the mega
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:37.300]  elite because he could push the bull more create more division bamboozle his
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:43.380]  supporters better while he does every horrible thing that you could ever
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:50.620]  imagine across the board and it just gets worse and worse and worse and you
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:55.100]  know they just want you to go pay the fee pay the $5,000 a year it's even more
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.420]  for a family that's why they don't even let you sign up they're just going to
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:01.980]  take it out of your bank account English all this law really did was act as a
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:05.340]  smokescreen for insurance companies to force you to buy their product and be
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:09.620]  able to collude to charge you whatever they want but obviously you've got to
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:13.060]  opt out of it because it's nothing but a data mining scam there's an article up
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:19.340]  on info wars calm drudge I've opted out of Obamacare for life whose sound says
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:24.860]  he would rather pay the tax than get government mandated health insurance
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:31.700]  well I've experienced that when you actually get the insurance then you're
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:36.380]  charged more and put at the back of the bus because you're known as a moron I
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:41.300]  mean that's how this whole system works it is a tax ruled by the Supreme Court
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:47.460]  transferred to the predominantly offshore mafia banks and you're like man
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:51.780]  that's bold well of course it's bold you got a zombie population that can't find
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:56.060]  their rear end with both ends so get ready this is all in the beginning they're

[01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:18.220]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing

[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:29.340]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:33.580]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line

[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:35.980]  Alex Jones
[01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:39.820]  dr. Christopher Busby's with us for about 30 minutes then I'm going to get
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:45.980]  into the geopolitical news the latest Obamacare news the huge NSA
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:51.340]  developments also voluntary government checkpoint spark backlash that's in USA
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:55.980]  today these are federal grants going on for at least the last five years in LA
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:09:01.020]  they use on-duty police and make you give it and they're phasing in domestic
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:05.580]  checkpoints that's all this is and finally the government insists they're
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:09.260]  voluntary they're creating a backlash because of the presence of uniform police
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:13.420]  officers they direct you off the road with flashing lights that's a custodial
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:19.860]  arrest that is official oppression and they do it in a group it's got a name
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:25.940]  racketeering organized crime you're like but it's the government that's the most
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:30.300]  dangerous type historically of organized crime special interest corporate
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:35.140]  interest controlling government that's what's happening here literally dog
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:39.540]  training the public to put up with anything now joining us is dr. Christopher
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:44.100]  Busby he's a chemical physicist and British scientist who's advised the
[01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:52.140]  parliament and the EU LLRC dot org and he heads up the low-level radiation
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:59.740]  campaign and everything that he has talked about has been coming true
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:09.100]  unfortunately and unfolding and dr. Busby joins us now from England to break down
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:16.740]  the new developments that are coming out with the health department out in
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:21.500]  San Francisco confirming a 500% increase in background radiation levels which
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:25.780]  isn't that high but it's still alarming showing it could go up but saying they
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:29.900]  don't know where it's coming from when they could test for the isotopes only
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:35.820]  info wars calm one local San Francisco paper drugs report calm and RT are
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:40.300]  covering this the starfish are almost all dying they've confirmed cover-ups in
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:45.300]  radiation in the fish that's been in the news so this is a big deal and the
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:52.660]  good news is is it's getting people's attention on this subject so dr. Busby
[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:56.540]  joins us and of course they predicted in major computer models from universities
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:00.020]  and Spain other places that the main radiation waves will start hitting in
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:04.220]  January of this year from the ocean and indeed that corresponds with this
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:08.020]  increase so dr. Busby you've got the floor to give us your report and tell
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:11.700]  us what you think is really going on here thank you for joining us well Alex
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:17.620]  I'm pleased to be here again I'm a bit confused myself about what's going on I
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:23.620]  have to say the point is that the amount of radioactivity if you if you if you do
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:27.900]  the calculations the amount of radioactivity gone into the sea by the
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:34.020]  time it's diluted and come come across to America would not be able to on the
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:39.060]  basis of theory anyway cause the kinds of increases in radioactivity that are
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:45.620]  being reported now I had a look at I've been following following measurements
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:52.380]  made by the US radnet system which is which is an excellent system as long
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:57.860]  as it works and it usually does where you can see levels of radioactivity or
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:03.620]  radiation of different different energies plotted out from a number of
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:07.300]  different stations throughout the United States and of course at the same time
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:11.820]  since Fukushima we've had a whole a huge number of people actually buy Geiger
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:16.140]  counters and put themselves on networks where they report the measurements that
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:21.100]  they've been been taking and I followed with great interest this this
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:25.260]  extraordinarily useful development but by and large what they've been measuring
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:30.100]  has been radon in rainwater and so people you know over the last year or so
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:33.980]  been getting terribly excited because suddenly they get five times background
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:40.740]  or even sometimes 10 15 20 times background by measuring rainwater and I
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:45.420]  but then asked them to measure the rate at which this the radioactivity
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:49.140]  decays in the rainwater samples and usually it's very rapid which suggests
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:53.580]  that it is radon natural radon but having said that the levels of natural
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:58.620]  radon seem to be increasing and I'm a bit puzzled about that too now as far as
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:03.180]  the Fukushima radiation coming to the United States this report from LA and
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:09.020]  from San Diego talking about a five-fold excess well I followed this up and had
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:12.500]  a look at the weather patterns for those areas and looked at the rad net
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:15.980]  measurements which were which are on the internet and where you can see these
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:20.380]  levels of camera radiation plotted and in fact they plot very much on the top
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:25.700]  of of fog banks so if you look at if you look at fog banks which of course fog
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:31.060]  banks occur a lot in California and as the fog floats in so the radiation
[01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:35.420]  levels go up now I think that the radiation levels would go up anyway as
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:39.980]  the fog comes in because there's more material there to cause gamma radiation
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:44.620]  from quite natural sources but I'm not saying that's it so I mean having said
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:48.820]  all this stuff I know it sounds a bit waffly but I mean I would like to wait
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:54.020]  and see somebody actually measure the gamma radiation spectrum of whatever it
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:57.900]  is that's supposed to be coming in and causing the irradiation of America
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:01.940]  because it's very hard to imagine how they could be a five-fold increase in
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:04.940]  natural background radiation from the sort of material that's coming from
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:09.980]  Fukushima it's just too far away but having said that having said that and
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:14.260]  having also done the calculations about the concentrations that would likely to
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:18.660]  be in the ocean what I have noticed and this is actually terrifying is that
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:22.500]  since Fukushima there's been there has been an increasing collapse in the
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:27.740]  entire Pacific ecosystem and this is not something which which one can just
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:32.460]  kind of poo poo or write that's what I was gonna raise we have mainline oceanic
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:38.220]  university studies as high as 98% death starfish fish they've never before seen
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:43.180]  whales that are Siamese twins are conjoined that's on info wars.com
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:47.380]  coming up on the west coast the fishermen are reporting all sorts of
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:53.540]  deformities there they're posting these online and then I want to get into the
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:59.180]  fact they're using homeless people to move the rods in Japan and and where all
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:03.140]  this is going because they're now picking up higher levels of radiation in
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:07.740]  Missouri and in the snow and then it seems like the entire breakdown of the
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:12.700]  nuclear power system because as you know they're now 35 40 years old suddenly
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:16.900]  they're they're saying they're leaking more so that's what I was saying yesterday
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:22.580]  this could be other events as well all building up on each other well let's
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:26.780]  let's begin with the Pacific because to my mind that is actually the most
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:31.220]  scary a thing of all of the scariest outcome of all of this because I don't
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:34.900]  think that we can write off any of that now all those other measurements of
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:39.020]  radioactivity in Missouri and in the snow and in the fog banks off LA and all
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:42.860]  the rest of it could in principle be just that more people are looking and
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:45.660]  more people are expecting things to happen and so when they see something
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:49.900]  they go oh my gosh we're all going to die it's Fukushima that's a that's a
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:53.260]  possible answer and we won't know the answer to that until we do some gamma
[01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:56.580]  spectroscopy and find out what's going on and of course the problem is nobody's
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:16:00.380]  doing it that we can believe that's my issue the Institute the health
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:04.860]  departments are saying it's five times it's ten times we don't know why don't
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:09.420]  worry about it we don't know where it's coming from but can't they test for the
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:13.660]  isotopes contest absolutely they can test they could they could they could they
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:17.380]  could measure the gamma spectrum with a portable gamma spectrum return it would
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:20.900]  tell them immediately where it was coming from because if I assume it's the
[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:25.780]  case that it's radon is that they would see a big peak at 619 kilo electron
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:29.900]  volts from business 214 and so that and that would tell them immediately what it
[01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:32.860]  was there would be no problem about it okay so I don't know why they aren't
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:36.300]  doing that I don't know why someone hasn't done that I mean I had the same
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:40.220]  problem with somebody in Brazil who was finding enormously high levels of
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:43.900]  radioactivity in the water and he was assuming it was coming on the jet stream
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:47.980]  from Fukushima which is in which is impossible because it's just too far and
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:51.740]  it turned out the thing had a half-life you know he got he got some tissues and
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:55.260]  measured the half-life put it in a plastic bag and so on and it turned out to be
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:58.460]  quite short half-life so it was obviously radon it couldn't have come from
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:01.900]  Fukushima and I'm suspecting the same thing in the United States but of course
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:05.740]  like you say there are loads of loads of nuclear power stations there and they
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:08.780]  could all be leaking all over the place and it could be one of those so it could
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:13.140]  be cesium 137 could be a plutonium could be any blooming thing the trouble is
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:17.940]  there's no independent organization with the competence or the financial clout
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:21.980]  or the machinery over there and it should be a global independent
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:27.100]  organization that people can believe who who immediately swoop in and check out
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:30.540]  these sorts of reports you know part from anything else so that people don't
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:36.020]  freak out but as far as the Pacific is concerned I think that is real we've
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:40.420]  got we've got we've got a population collapse all across the Pacific and my
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:44.020]  colleague Alex Yablokov who is a population biologist I was with him in
[01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:48.380]  Moscow recently talking about this issue and the problem is that if you that you
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:52.940]  can tip an entire ecological system over the edge so in other words you know it's
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:57.700]  if you get to a sort of 11% death of this lot and 11% death of that lot and
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:02.180]  11% death of something else and so on and they all depend upon each other the
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:04.780]  whole thing goes down the toilet and I think that's what's happening in the
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:08.380]  Pacific and it's absolutely terrifying because so many people depend upon the
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:14.580]  Pacific for their food supply well you're absolutely right Dr. Busby and we've
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:18.340]  got some of the studies up on screen now but I'm reading marine biologists
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:24.900]  you're saying they've never seen such deformities in fish and in marine mammals
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:29.420]  that they're seeing now and we're talking about Siamese baby whales now
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:34.100]  washing up okay I mean that sounds like radiation I think about that I thought
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:37.860]  quite hard about this because because the way in which I've approached this is
[01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:42.260]  to actually you know take the number of peta becquerels or terror becquerels and
[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:45.140]  divide it into the water which is really the kind of way the nuclear
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:48.740]  industry operate you know it's a sort of primitive approach and if you do that
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:52.620]  what it shows is that the actual quantity the total quantity from Fukushima
[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:56.660]  is is actually less than the total quantity from the nuclear weapons
[01:18:56.660 --> 01:19:01.220]  testing and I said this before but what is different is this is that Fukushima
[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:05.460]  is an awful lot of uranium and in the last ten years a lot of you and also
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:09.620]  plutonium of course and if the if that was converted as a result of the
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:13.540]  explosions into small particles into these nanoparticles and we know that
[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:17.220]  that is the case because we've measured them in car filters and on people's
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:20.820]  shoes and so on so we know that these nanoparticles exist now if they came
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:26.980]  along into the Pacific Ocean and contaminated the sea that the the basis
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:30.340]  of the sea life the plankton if you like then we would then of course
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:33.500]  everything depends upon that and then the then then the particles would get
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:38.820]  into the larger animals and it would bioaccumulate and it would bioaccumulate
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:41.940]  correct doctor yes yes of course that's right but they would bioaccumulate as
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:45.820]  particles as hot particles and this would really explain the collapse it
[01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:49.820]  would also explain the genetic effects in the in the higher mammals because we
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:53.700]  saw similar genetic effects in Fallujah from depleted uranium absolutely stay
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:56.820]  there doctor break that down we come back because folks we're at the top of
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:01.860]  the food chain too just like the whales hi folks Alex Jones here was some
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:05.740]  important information I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:09.940]  patriots over at my Patriots supply several years ago Matt was sitting in
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:13.300]  his two bedroom apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:17.140]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:22.300]  action a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born by Patriots supply has
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:25.980]  never taken a loan or accepted outside funding they now operate two
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:30.580]  distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women

[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:20.040]  nuclear physicists medical doctors you name it and we could see for miles and
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:23.820]  miles the currents that come right at North America from Japan the winds the
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:26.900]  the trade winds, the jet stream, all of it.
[01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:28.160]  And what he's saying here,
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.420]  I know most of you understand this,
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:31.260]  but I want this to really sink in,
[01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:32.740]  is that you've got all the hot particles,
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:35.140]  not just the background radiation.
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:36.660]  It's those hot particles that are making
[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:39.660]  the general background ambient level be higher,
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:41.940]  but when you've got the particles itself,
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.500]  that'd be like if you had a lead detector
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:45.620]  and you were at a shooting range,
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:47.500]  you picked up higher levels of lead.
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:50.500]  If you actually, though, eat one of those lead bullets,
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:51.700]  you're gonna get really sick.
[01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:54.140]  That's the hot particle, that's the analogy.
[01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:56.900]  And so you've got whales that are eating the fish,
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:59.260]  or if they're baleen, they're eating all the plankton,
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:03.740]  bio-accumulating like a sponge, like a filter.
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:07.340]  The radioactive particles that have been dumping in,
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:10.580]  and so they're literally being used as filters,
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:12.620]  and that's why they've tested the tuna and stuff
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:13.900]  and they're radioactive.
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:15.340]  And so now you've got just stuff
[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:16.900]  that marine biologists have never seen.
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:18.700]  Dr. Busby's with us till about 40 after,
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:21.660]  then I'm gonna cover a bunch of big, important breaking news,
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:24.140]  but Dr. Busby continuing, you got cut off by the break.
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:26.020]  Is that what you're getting at here?
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:29.140]  Is why we're seeing a Pacific level collapse,
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:31.820]  the starfish disintegrating, the fish dying,
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:32.940]  the seals dying?
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:34.860]  I mean, it's undoubted across the board,
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:36.420]  something big's going on,
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:38.700]  and if we're similar to those animals
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.820]  and we're eating stuff out of the ocean,
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:43.460]  what is it gonna do to us bio-accumulating?
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:47.340]  I put a picture up on my Facebook site recently,
[01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:49.100]  and it's sort of gone viral,
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.780]  but it's a picture that was taken in the 80s
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:56.780]  of a hot particle with tracks in an edible muscle.
[01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:59.620]  And you can see that picture on my Facebook site,
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:00.940]  various other people have published it
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:02.180]  all over the place now.
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:05.500]  It's truly terrifying because if you like a photograph
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.380]  of what a hot particle does,
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:09.700]  and how you see it inside the office.
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.420]  Give us your official Facebook names,
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.620]  we can put it on screen.
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:16.300]  It's just Chris Busby, it's just Chris Busby.
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.140]  My...
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:21.540]  Fantastic, we'll put it up on screen, go ahead.
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:25.660]  Anyway, yeah, so I mean,
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:27.420]  I don't know if this is the answer,
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:29.260]  Alex, but the point is something is happening there.
[01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:30.500]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:33.540]  The very important paper, the one that really did it for me,
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:38.260]  is by K.R. Smith and various people who are oceanographers,
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:40.300]  and they were concerned about global warming.
[01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:42.100]  What they've been doing is they've been measuring
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:45.260]  the amount of dead creatures that reach the seabed.
[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:48.740]  So in other words, they can take a certain period of time,
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:51.220]  and they can measure the mass of dead things
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:53.380]  that die on the surface of the ocean,
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:55.260]  and then float down and hit the bottom.
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:58.500]  And what they noticed, they do this graph
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:01.660]  of various different parts of the northeast Pacific.
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:03.580]  And you can see that after Fukushima,
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:06.220]  the amount of dead creatures that reach the sea bottom
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:09.460]  suddenly accelerated up to an enormously high level
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.820]  in all of the places that they were measuring.
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.580]  And they say, oh, there must be some problem
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:16.180]  with global warming and that it's cutting in and this and that.
[01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:17.860]  But it's obviously not global warming,
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:21.900]  because nothing has happened with that sort of trend
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:23.540]  in global warming, but certainly something
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:26.060]  has happened with that sort of trend from Fukushima.
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:28.540]  And I think it must be that the uranium,
[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:30.580]  because most of the stuff coming out,
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.180]  although a lot of the radioactivity is not uranium,
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:36.420]  in terms of actual mass, vast amounts of uranium
[01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:38.300]  come out of nuclear sites.
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.140]  And so I think a lot of this stuff's coming out
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:43.260]  in the form of nanoparticles spreading into the ocean,
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:45.900]  and then being carried by the plankton.
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:49.780]  It's getting into some of these microorganisms in the ocean,
[01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:51.820]  and then going up the food chain in that way.
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:54.620]  And in that way, probably it will drift across
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:56.700]  and end up on the California coast,
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:58.980]  in which case what you need to do is to watch out
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:03.700]  for inhaling the air within about one kilometer of the coast.
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:06.420]  People in coastal communities are going to increase
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:09.700]  their level of risk from cancer and various other diseases,
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:10.540]  if that's the case.
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:12.340]  But the trouble is nobody's measuring it.
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:13.660]  Nobody's measuring this stuff.
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:18.460]  And there is no independent global institute or organization
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:20.740]  that is funded to do this or can do it,
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:22.460]  because there's no money to do it.
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:24.660]  And of course, you've got all these well-meaning people
[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:26.100]  wondering about it with Geiger counters,
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:28.300]  but that really is no help.
[01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:29.820]  We need to know where this stuff is,
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:32.260]  and we need to characterize it properly.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:33.420]  And nobody's doing that.
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:34.260]  That's the problem.
[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:36.780]  But what certainly we can see is the effects of something.
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:39.900]  We can certainly see the collapse of the Pacific biota,
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:41.820]  the collapse of the Pacific ecosystem.
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:44.100]  And that is truly terrifying.
[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:45.220]  It certainly is.
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:47.180]  And again, my issue, and we've talked about this before,
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:48.460]  I want to come back in one more segment
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:50.540]  and talk about other issues that are important
[01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:53.260]  and how you think we protect ourselves.
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:56.060]  But governments not even saying they're investigating.
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:57.460]  And oh, who knows?
[01:28:57.460 --> 01:28:59.780]  It could be red-eating utensils.
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:01.900]  I mean, that's an actual quote by one of the health department
[01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:02.620]  people.
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:04.780]  And then they act like you're weird to even care
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:06.940]  that the radiation level in some areas
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:09.620]  is 15 times what they call normal background.
[01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:12.260]  And they confirm what amateurs with Geiger counters
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:13.460]  are saying.
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:15.500]  And it's like bad to even care.
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:18.100]  It's incredible.
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:21.140]  Well, I mean, as far as that's concerned, if you take me,
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:23.420]  I'm one of the few people that squeaks about this stuff.
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:25.020]  And I just get attacked continuously
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:27.940]  from all over the place.
[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:30.300]  There is no doubt in my mind that there
[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:33.060]  is an operation taking place from within government
[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:35.060]  or from in people within government
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:37.340]  to cover up all of these things.
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:38.740]  So it's no surprise that they're not saying that.
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:39.460]  Look at Japan.
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:40.340]  Stay there.
[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:43.140]  Let's talk about the cover-up and what it's done in Japan,
[01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:44.660]  because now that cover-up has collapsed.
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:49.540]  Dr. Chris Busby's our guest, llrc.org.
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:50.940]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:53.420]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:56.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:08.220]  No more do you have two or three filters
[01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:10.380]  to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:12.860]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:16.460]  and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:18.260]  Advanced manufacturing technology
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:20.900]  combines silver impregnated white ceramic
[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:23.460]  with new aqua medics advanced media
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.820]  for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals,
[01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.460]  all in one filter element.
[01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:30.340]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates.
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:34.020]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:37.340]  This is the only system that in one unit helps
[01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:41.580]  reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines,
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:45.060]  ammonia, and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid,
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:47.260]  the most common form of fluoride not covered
[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:48.860]  by other fluoride filter brands,
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:51.260]  and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:00.980]  The facts are in.
[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:02.340]  The studies are legion.
[01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:04.900]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members
[01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:07.580]  of the fluoride family are devastating the health
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:09.900]  and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:13.620]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:16.220]  Simple, dumb down the host population
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:19.020]  that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:21.060]  We may not have been able to get fluoride
[01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:22.460]  out of the water supply yet,
[01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:24.700]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.740]  I am extremely excited to announce
[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:30.300]  the exclusive InfoWars Live fluoride shield formulation,
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:33.460]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:36.220]  from around the world to help the body remove
[01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:38.700]  not just toxic fluoride residues from the body,
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:41.060]  but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:43.060]  Let's take a stand against the globalist
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:45.580]  by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.740]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:49.300]  Secure your fluoride shield
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:53.340]  and other pioneering formulations at infowarslife.com today.
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:55.340]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:57.780]  and support the InfoWars at the same time.
[01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:59.860]  That's infowarslife.com.
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:01.900]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.740]  about some of the most important information
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:05.620]  concerning you and your family's health.
[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:07.500]  Radiation levels have more than doubled
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.940]  in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:13.020]  from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:16.420]  Radiolactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:18.420]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:19.700]  Move south of the equator
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:23.060]  or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:25.980]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:29.700]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form
[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:31.900]  of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:35.540]  It's made right here in the USA completely non-GMO.
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:37.260]  I searched out the best quality
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:39.660]  and now have developed a double strength form
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:42.180]  of nascent iodine exclusively available
[01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:44.060]  at infowarslife.com.
[01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:46.380]  Nascent iodine is on record
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:48.820]  as one of the only safe ways to detox
[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:50.060]  from fluoride poisoning.
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:52.180]  Survival shield nascent iodine.
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:55.620]  Secure your super high quality nascent iodine today

[01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:59.980]  That's infowarslife.com.
[01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:05.860]  We are on the march.
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:08.980]  The empire is on the run.
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:13.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:17.700]  Yeah, those hard breaks with the satellite cutting in
[01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:19.860]  and cut off after Busby when I haven't finished his statement
[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:21.420]  and I've got some other key questions for him
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:23.460]  before he leaves us in about 10 minutes
[01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:26.780]  and we go into the news and then your phone calls.
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:29.140]  But I want to explain something here.
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:30.780]  There is a left, there is a right,
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:33.820]  but they're controlled worldwide by corporate interest
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:36.940]  that try to keep us at each other's throats
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:39.060]  and to basically control the debate.
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:41.740]  Carol Quigley at Georgetown,
[01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:44.660]  top advisor to the CIA and Bill Clinton,
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.860]  wrote that in his book, Tragedy and Hope.
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:49.500]  But when I say transcend the left-right paradigm,
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.340]  there are issues that the right promotes
[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:52.820]  that make sense that are good.
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:54.820]  There's issues that so-called left promotes
[01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:56.700]  that make sense are good, some that are bad.
[01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:59.300]  On both sides, this isn't about being left or right.
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:03.980]  It's about surviving, having a world, not being insane.
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:06.260]  And so many cultures would just throw their garbage
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:07.100]  in the river.
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:09.460]  Well, you could do that when it was just regular garbage.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:12.780]  Or the Romans would drink their wine out of lead-lined pots
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:15.060]  and that's why they were so violent and insane.
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:17.020]  They studied Roman bones.
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:20.340]  And as soon as they started adopting the lead-lined pottery,
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:23.620]  they became more violent, more insane, more aggressive.
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:27.220]  And then it finally probably led to their collapse.
[01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:30.460]  And that's lead, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:34.140]  The unleading of gasoline is directly correlated
[01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:38.220]  to the last 30 years with massive decreases in crime.
[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:42.420]  And that's just a fact, along with other issues as well.
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:45.500]  Citizens becoming more armed, but the lead issue is big.
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:46.700]  That's how the left always counters me.
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:48.460]  Well, crime went down because lead being taken out.
[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:51.060]  I'm like, yeah, I know, that's part of it.
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:54.380]  But this is, this is GMO.
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:55.540]  I'm all for science.
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:57.540]  I'm all for a better crop hybridization.
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:58.780]  That's not what this is.
[01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:03.060]  They'll put 14 different genes and a pesticide producing
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.740]  bacteria or fungus in it.
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:07.540]  And it kills the bees, thousands of studies.
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:09.700]  I've interviewed top scientists that were making
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.580]  millions of dollars a year.
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.700]  And then they found out their potato or their corn
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:15.940]  was killing the lab animals.
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:17.740]  And they said, we can't put this out.
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:19.340]  I've had these scientists on.
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:21.020]  And then they'd be called aside by the corporate heads
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:23.380]  saying, you like the $3 million a year, doctor?
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:26.020]  You like that big fancy house?
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:27.380]  There are too many people.
[01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:29.540]  I've talked to Russian scientists, British scientists,
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:32.620]  Pakistani scientists, US scientists who get brought
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:33.380]  into the room.
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:36.220]  Monsanto doesn't eat their own GMO.
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:37.700]  That's Associated Press.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.300]  That's CBC.
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.220]  The Chinese and other globalists lead
[01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:43.460]  have their own organic greenhouses.
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:46.100]  The elite drink purified water.
[01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:48.620]  They're moving to rural areas.
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:52.260]  Because ladies and gentlemen, they've decided to just
[01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:54.300]  pollute everything, and they've gone crazy.
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:56.980]  And they're building more reactors as they melt down.
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:35:58.460]  People think, oh, it's a left-wing issue
[01:35:58.460 --> 01:35:59.540]  to care about radiation.
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:02.300]  No, it's looking at a Geiger counter and deformed whales
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:05.100]  and all the fish life dead, OK?
[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:06.940]  And so it isn't about left or right
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:08.540]  or about what issue you're for.
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:10.380]  It's about what issue is real.
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:12.580]  And they're covering up.
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:15.140]  My cousin died when he was very young.
[01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:16.980]  And they admitted it was from Agent Orange
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:20.220]  because his dad had been a helicopter pilot in Vietnam.
[01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:21.060]  My uncle died.
[01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:22.820]  And the doctors looked at his heart and stuff
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:24.900]  and said, no, there's Agent Orange scarring here.
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:26.260]  We see this in Vietnam.
[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:27.660]  That's that we're an Agent Orange.
[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:32.060]  I had a cousin and my uncle die because of Monsanto, OK?
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:34.020]  This is real, folks.
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:35.180]  This is real.
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:37.020]  Now, I'm going to shut up and go back to Dr. Busby.
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:41.740]  But I'm sitting here breathing increased radiation.
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:44.260]  I'm sitting here living in this toxic waste.
[01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:45.700]  GMO is everywhere.
[01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:48.380]  Allergies are off the charts, directly connected
[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:50.540]  to all this stuff bombarding our immune systems.
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:52.780]  And the state won't even look at this.
[01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:54.380]  When Berkeley came out and said, we've
[01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:57.100]  got a huge increase in radiation in the water,
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:58.620]  they were told to shut up by the feds.
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:00.700]  I mean, this is insanity.
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:03.220]  And I think Dr. Busby, we're not left, we're not right.
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:05.940]  We are for self-preservation and not insane.
[01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:08.340]  But I want you to finish your points on radiation
[01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:10.420]  on other concerns, what's happening,
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:11.940]  and where you think this is going,
[01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:12.980]  and what's happened in Japan.
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:14.660]  I'm going to try to shut up and let you talk.
[01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:17.500]  You just heard me speak about the mindset of the elite.
[01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.180]  I've studied this in history.
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:22.700]  There are times when you get megalomaniacal elites
[01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:25.100]  who are so nihilistic, they just don't care.
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:27.620]  So is it a depopulation agenda?
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:30.340]  Or is it that they just don't care and have gone insane?
[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:33.140]  Because the laws of physics, you're a physicist,
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:35.740]  you know this, are going to catch up with us.
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:38.780]  Increased cancer rates, increased deformity,
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:42.540]  increased mental illness, increased lowering of IQ.
[01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:47.180]  I mean, we are, the West is in a toxic stew.
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:49.460]  There's no doubt we're killing ourselves.
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:52.940]  Right, well, all of those things are true.
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:55.060]  And in fact, it's not a question of what's going to happen
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:57.140]  in the future, because it's already happened.
[01:37:57.140 --> 01:37:59.660]  I mean, if you look at the cancer rates I've studied
[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:01.380]  in real terms, that's where I came in.
[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:04.620]  In 1995, I was looking at the cancer rates
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:08.060]  going back to 1960 and 1950.
[01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:12.940]  And the weapons testing that occurred in 59 to 63
[01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:16.420]  caused a 30 to 40% increase in cancer 20 years later.
[01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:18.100]  And that was the famous cancer epidemic.
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:22.020]  In real terms, but of course the governments came along
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:23.500]  and all their stooges came along and said,
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.340]  oh, it's just because we have an aging population.
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:26.860]  But that wasn't true.
[01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:29.620]  The age standardized rates went up.
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:32.220]  And what we are seeing now is continuation
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:33.860]  of the same scenario.
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:38.260]  But of course, ultimately, you cannot continue to boil the frog.
[01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:39.820]  Eventually, the frog dies.
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:41.700]  And I think what we're seeing in the Pacific
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:44.900]  now, which is the death of the Pacific ecosystem,
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:49.340]  is going to ultimately just be a mirror to the death
[01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:51.020]  of the human ecosystem.
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:54.500]  We have imposed our energy and our will
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:56.900]  and our toxic waste on the planet
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:59.460]  so long now that that's going to come back and bite us
[01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:01.100]  and already is doing so.
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:06.660]  And the evidence is quite clear from all that we hear
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:09.500]  from Japan, that it's already doing that even now,
[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:11.900]  just a few years after Fukushima.
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:13.420]  And we know what happened in Belarus
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:14.660]  because we've studied Belarus.
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:17.180]  So we know that the population collapsed in Belarus.
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:20.460]  There was an increase in death rate in the old people.
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:25.060]  The average lifespan fell from something like 65
[01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:27.500]  to something like 45 people.
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:29.940]  And of course, the birth rate collapsed as well.
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:31.780]  So if you've got no children being born
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:33.420]  and you've got older children dying,
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:35.060]  then that's the end of your population.
[01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:37.660]  That's an ecological population collapse.
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:39.100]  And that is what we're seeing.
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.700]  We're seeing people who cannot have babies now.
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:43.500]  So huge amounts of effort are now
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.100]  going into doing in vitro fertilization
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:48.260]  because normal methods of fertilization
[01:39:48.260 --> 01:39:49.860]  don't work anymore.
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:52.580]  And goodness knows what's going to be
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:54.900]  the status of the children that are born.
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:56.500]  Enough studies have been done to show
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:59.540]  that children who were born after the exposures
[01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:02.460]  of Chernobyl and the exposures from the weapons fallout
[01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:05.860]  had much smaller brains, much lower IQs,
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:09.180]  and of course, in animals also too.
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:10.700]  So yeah, sure.
[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:12.460]  But then the question is who's doing this?
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:14.020]  Are they mad and so all the rest of it?
[01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:15.380]  I mean, I'm inclined to the belief
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:19.460]  that there's not some kind of mad, monstrous cabal
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:21.980]  at the top of this, some kind of meekon-like character
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:24.900]  sort of who hates everybody and is totally insane,
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:28.100]  pulling the strings and causing the IAEA to cover things up
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:30.540]  and all these other things that we know happen.
[01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:32.780]  I think it's just the economic machine.
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:33.620]  That's what I think it is.
[01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:36.340]  I think we have built ourselves through economics
[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:39.020]  and probably through a lot of people who want to get rich
[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:41.420]  constructing these economic systems.
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:43.260]  We have constructed a monster.
[01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:46.580]  We have made a sort of Frankenstein that is now unstoppable.
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:48.020]  That's what I think is the problem
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:50.860]  because ultimately all of these efforts
[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:54.180]  to cover up radiation and to build more nuclear power stations
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:56.300]  and do all of these things ultimately are aimed
[01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:59.100]  at just enriching people with uranium shares
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:02.060]  and causing the military to become more powerful.
[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:05.460]  And of course, it's built into the military
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:06.460]  to become more powerful.
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:07.300]  That's what they do.
[01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:12.260]  It's built into organizations that are set up to make money,
[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:13.140]  to make money.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:15.820]  And once you put all of these systems together
[01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:17.980]  into a structure, you've created a monster
[01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:19.460]  and that's the monster that we have.
[01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:22.700]  Ultimately, that monster will be taken down
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:25.380]  together with all of the rest of us, unfortunately,
[01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:28.980]  unless we can manage to find somewhere to hide by nature.
[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:30.940]  And we're seeing the beginning of that now.
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:33.260]  We're seeing the beginning of that now.
[01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:35.500]  Well, I don't doubt that there's a carrying level
[01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:38.180]  for the planet and that there are overpopulation issues
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:39.420]  in certain areas.
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:41.340]  My concern is the rigged economy
[01:41:41.340 --> 01:41:43.140]  because I've read the Royal Commission on Population.
[01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:44.300]  I've seen what they've said.
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:46.820]  They've blocked all the new developments
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:50.020]  because old bureaucracies wanted to stay in control
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:52.020]  and they've done everything they can
[01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:54.620]  to shut down any real competition
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:56.500]  in developing cleaner systems
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:59.940]  and turned any new development into just a scam boondoggle
[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:02.380]  where nothing even gets developed.
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:04.660]  And then, meanwhile, the genetic engineering,
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:07.860]  all of it, the elite, use the environmental movement
[01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:11.100]  as a power grab and as a way to tax people
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:14.220]  instead of actually trying to clean stuff up.
[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:15.420]  It's just insanity.
[01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:17.380]  It's like, no matter what you do,
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:20.540]  somebody's gonna cheat inside the system.
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:24.660]  It's so rigged, as Rolling Stone reported on the banks,
[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:29.660]  that the people, Max Kaiser calls it suicide bankers,
[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:31.420]  where there were people in the World Trade Center
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:33.740]  that even after one tower had collapsed,
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:35.020]  they stayed in the other one
[01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:36.900]  because they could sit there making trades,
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:38.860]  making millions of dollars a minute,
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:40.900]  even though they were going to die.
[01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:43.580]  And that is the definition of insanity.
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:45.820]  Well, they deserved, yeah, that's sure.
[01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:47.900]  But anyway, you know, after the Second World War,
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:50.820]  there were a whole load of philosophers and psychologists
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:53.140]  who tried to figure out how on earth,
[01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:54.860]  you know, the Second World War happened
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:56.220]  and all those terrible things happened
[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:58.900]  in Nazi Germany and so on.
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:00.780]  And they basically figured out that anybody,
[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:02.620]  any human beings could do anything.
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:04.620]  Given the right sort of culture surrounding them
[01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:07.580]  and supporting their idiocies and insanities,
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:09.940]  they would form a sort of group of insane people
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:10.980]  who would then run amok
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:12.780]  and insanely continue to do what they were doing,
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:14.140]  even if it was killing themselves.
[01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:14.980]  And that was the...
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:16.580]  Yeah, that was the Milgram and Stanford experiments
[01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:19.100]  where they found what was it, 90 plus percent of people
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:21.580]  who were nice, good folks with no criminal background
[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:25.260]  when ordered by an authority figure to murder would do it.
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:27.460]  Yes, yes, that's right, all those electric shock people.
[01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:28.300]  I know, I know.
[01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:30.220]  Well, anyway, we know, we kind of know all this,
[01:43:30.220 --> 01:43:31.820]  but the problem is, you know,
[01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:34.300]  we're in this awful position of knowing it all
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:35.820]  and watching it all collapse
[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:38.100]  and not being able to do anything about it.
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:40.420]  Anyway, we are trying to do something about it,
[01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:42.580]  but the problem is within the current political system,
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:44.260]  doesn't seem to be possible
[01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:45.700]  because they control the media
[01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:47.300]  and they control, well, apart from you
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:48.740]  and a few people like that, you know,
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:51.780]  mostly, you know, you have these CNN type people
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:54.420]  who will just, they have, what do they call it now?
[01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:55.980]  They call the Science Media Center.
[01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:57.700]  I came across this recently.
[01:43:57.700 --> 01:43:59.740]  There's this woman called Fiona Fox
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:01.980]  who runs a thing called the Science Media Center.
[01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:05.700]  And basically what they do is they bully journalists
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:07.900]  into telling lies on the basis
[01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:09.980]  that they are the people who know about the science
[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:12.900]  and people who are independent scientists like me
[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:15.860]  just get told that they shouldn't talk to us,
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:17.220]  you know, that we're insane.
[01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:20.660]  So they have an actual media machine,
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:23.380]  which is like, if you like the opposite of you,
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:25.380]  but they have a lot more money than you do.
[01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:26.220]  That's the problem.
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.860]  Well, look at how no newspapers in California
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:31.420]  would report the increased radiation levels
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:34.260]  until local journalists, just citizens,
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:36.260]  with a website and a YouTube account went out,
[01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:38.300]  others joined them, found the same thing,
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:39.740]  and the health department had to go out and say,
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:43.460]  okay, it is five, 10 times higher, but that's not a problem.
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:45.540]  And we're not gonna look into why that's happening.
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:47.900]  I mean, that is the definition of insanity.
[01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:50.340]  In closing, Dr. Busby, looking at Japan,
[01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:52.740]  you know, we always remember the official story
[01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:54.340]  the first month almost three years ago,
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:56.940]  but now it's admitted there was a cover-up.
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:59.420]  It's admitted that there's a cover-up of deaths
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:01.980]  and cancers and mutations in plants and animals.
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:04.900]  And now the mafia is running the cleanup
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.540]  and it's just sinking into the ocean.
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:08.380]  What is your gut that's gonna,
[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:10.620]  what does your gut tell you is gonna happen
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:13.100]  as they try to clean up the site?
[01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:15.300]  I don't think they can clean up the site, Alex.
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:18.620]  I think that they're gonna have to throw a fence around that
[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:20.220]  and just watch it forever.
[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:21.940]  I mean, I don't see what else they can do.
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:23.740]  I did think of the, I mean,
[01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:25.180]  and they did think about the possibility
[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:26.780]  of bombing it into the ocean,
[01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:29.220]  but frankly, I think there's nothing much they can do now.
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:30.660]  The genie's out of the bottle, you know?
[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:35.340]  The material in those reactors is now in the ground somewhere
[01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:36.940]  and there's no way that they can get at it.
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:38.420]  And the more water they pump in there
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:40.340]  and the continuous water that comes down
[01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:41.260]  into the ground water,
[01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:43.900]  they will just wash the uranium out into the sea
[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:46.980]  and continue to pollute the Pacific Ocean more or less forever.
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:50.060]  What about building a giant sea wall
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:53.740]  that could pump the water out as they build dams and build,
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:54.860]  I mean, this is a big project.
[01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:57.300]  They should build like a Hoover dam around it.
[01:45:57.300 --> 01:45:58.540]  Well, that's a possibility,
[01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:01.140]  but then they'd have to get under it.
[01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:03.140]  That's really the problem because, you know,
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:05.260]  the hydraulic pressure from the water that went in there
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:08.980]  would just dilute the uranium and the other material,
[01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:12.100]  a lot of it's soluble, and then it would go underneath.
[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:13.900]  So you think it's more dangerous for them
[01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:15.020]  to have homeless people?
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:16.380]  I saw photos of these folks,
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:19.420]  obvious, complete, alcoholics, I'm not knocking them,
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:21.860]  but, you know, homeless old men
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:23.540]  is who they have removing the rods
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:25.980]  and they're using duct tape to try to seal leaks.
[01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:29.980]  I mean, is it more dangerous to have those rods touch?
[01:46:31.140 --> 01:46:32.820]  Well, if you touch the rods, you're dead.
[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:34.500]  I mean, there's no two ways about it.
[01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:37.820]  I mean, the radiation fields in the,
[01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:41.620]  one meter away from those fuel rods is lethal.
[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:43.860]  I mean, that's what the Chernobyl people found.
[01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:47.060]  Those people will die if they get anywhere near those rods.
[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:49.460]  There's no way that they can get near those rods.
[01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:52.660]  What's the current plan right now?
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:55.380]  They've got armies of homeless people crawling around in there.
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:57.860]  That sounds like an insane idea.
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:58.980]  It's all an insane idea,
[01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:02.260]  but the problem is that what else is there?
[01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:03.820]  I don't know quite what else there is.
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:05.660]  I mean, I'm at a loss.
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:07.500]  I just throw up my hands and say, you know,
[01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:08.980]  all I can say is you shouldn't have done it
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:09.940]  in the first place, you know,
[01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:11.220]  and that's the problem with nuclear
[01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:12.660]  right from the very beginning,
[01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:16.820]  that although it might be a very low probability risk,
[01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:18.940]  it's an extremely high impact risk.
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:20.780]  And now we've got all these nuclear power stations
[01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:23.700]  all over the world, certainly an awful lot in America
[01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:25.140]  where exactly the same thing could happen.
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:27.220]  Well, sure, and even Congress people,
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:29.220]  even congressional hearings had meant that
[01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:33.020]  if we were to have a EMP or electrical power grid go out,
[01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:35.580]  even for a few weeks, they'd run out of diesel power.
[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:39.020]  We'd have meltdown Chernobyl's all over the world.
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:40.260]  This is insane.
[01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:41.100]  That's right.
[01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:42.540]  Well, if you have a big electromagnetic pulse
[01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:44.660]  like the one that is possible, that one,
[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:47.020]  then of course you knock out your generators as well.
[01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:49.260]  Then you really have got catastrophe.
[01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:50.100]  All right.
[01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:54.940]  Well, llrc.org, Dr. Busby, thank you so much
[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:56.380]  for what you're doing for all of us
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:58.340]  and thank you for spending time with us today.
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:47:59.260]  Okay, you're welcome.
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:00.100]  See you soon.
[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:01.140]  All right, folks, thank you.
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:04.260]  All we're trying to do here is to draw attention
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:05.260]  to what's going on.
[01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:07.860]  That's all I'm trying to do.
[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:09.820]  I don't have all the answers here.
[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:12.380]  When we send our reporters out there this week to go
[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:14.540]  from Southern California through San Francisco
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:16.100]  all the way up to Seattle,
[01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:18.020]  we're gonna do this a little bit different.
[01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:19.980]  We're gonna start in San Francisco,
[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.860]  go up to Seattle, fly back down
[01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:24.860]  and check far Southern California
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:26.620]  from the border right up to Los Angeles.
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:29.100]  So they're gonna be there a full week,
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:31.060]  four of my crew members,
[01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:33.540]  and we can only do all of this because of your support.
[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:35.940]  When you buy the t-shirts, the books, the videos,
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:39.980]  the high quality, organic, shade grown
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:42.420]  and volcanic soil, Wake Up America coffee,
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:44.020]  my favorite type of coffee.
[01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:45.900]  So we've brought it to you right here,
[01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:47.420]  roasted it in Colorado,
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:49.740]  shipped out worldwide from Austin, Texas,
[01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:51.220]  the Wake Up America coffee,
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:55.580]  the Maiden1776.com brand of George Washington belt buckles
[01:48:55.580 --> 01:48:57.820]  and limited edition clothing.
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:00.780]  The ThyroSafe, we sell the government recommended
[01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:02.820]  stuff as well, but you can't take that long term.
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:05.100]  That's for in the middle of a major disaster.
[01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:08.340]  And of course we have the survival shield
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:11.780]  from infowarslife.com that is the proprietary
[01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:12.740]  nation iodine.
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:14.860]  It's blue-purple when it's on paper.
[01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:15.900]  No other iodine does that.
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:19.020]  It's red or black because it's not really nation iodine.
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:21.700]  It's bound iodine, oxidized iodine.
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:24.140]  This is real nation iodine,
[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:27.740]  National Academy of Sciences certified, whole nine yards.
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:30.020]  This is the only one that does it.
[01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:32.140]  I've discovered this with doctors and scientists
[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:34.340]  who had known about it for over a decade
[01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:36.540]  and said, my goodness, I'm gonna bring this to the public.
[01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:39.540]  We do it with infowarslife survival shield,
[01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:40.900]  which is almost sold out,
[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:43.260]  but we get more in the next week to two weeks.
[01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:45.140]  I'm told some shipped out today
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:48.940]  from the manufacturing laboratory.
[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:51.180]  But the point is infowarslife.com,
[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:54.460]  the fluoride shield is a two ounce bottle,
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:56.740]  not a one ounce bottle and it's only $10 more.
[01:49:56.740 --> 01:50:00.060]  It has the nation iodine and five other key compounds
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:02.940]  that pull out the fluoride and other toxic members
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:05.140]  of the halogen family and heavy metals, you name it.
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:07.820]  Go watch the informational videos and read about it
[01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:12.820]  at infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:17.180]  I did deep research because of the increasing
[01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:19.500]  radiation levels and talked to all these medical doctors,
[01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:21.660]  nutritionists, scientists, you name it,
[01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:24.380]  and came upon, you need to take non-iodine
[01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:26.860]  during emergencies, you take it all the time.
[01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:28.900]  And that the very best was what we got ahold of
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:31.220]  and it brought to you via infowarslife.com.
[01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:32.860]  So this is what I take, it's what my wife takes,
[01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:35.100]  what my children takes, consult your physician
[01:50:35.100 --> 01:50:39.340]  before you take it, but it's in a regular dose amount
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:44.340]  that's recommended there, infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:50.340]  And you can also call that number if you wanna write
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:54.020]  to us by mail, they can give you the PO box number as well.
[01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:57.460]  But infowars survivalshield and infowars fluoride shield
[01:50:57.460 --> 01:50:58.940]  and infowarslife.com.
[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:02.860]  The facts are in, the studies are legion.
[01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:05.420]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:08.100]  of the fluoride family are devastating the health
[01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:10.420]  and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:14.140]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:16.740]  Simple, dumb down the host population
[01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:19.540]  that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:21.580]  We may not have been able to get fluoride
[01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:23.980]  out of the water supply yet, but we can help
[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:25.260]  to get it out of our bodies.
[01:51:25.260 --> 01:51:27.300]  I am extremely excited to announce
[01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:30.820]  the exclusive infowarslife fluoride shield formulation
[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:33.980]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:36.740]  from around the world to help the body remove
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:39.220]  not just toxic fluoride residues from the body,
[01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:41.580]  but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:43.580]  Let's take a stand against the globalist
[01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:46.100]  by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:48.300]  I use fluoride shield every day,

[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:13.380]  and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[01:52:13.380 --> 01:52:16.500]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:18.900]  done to prove just how effective they are?
[01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:21.780]  It's true, and he can email you the test results.

[01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:03.420]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:07.100]  proudly presents The Alex Jones Show,
[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:09.340]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:17.220]  To take a closer look at global governance,
[01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:20.220]  it's just galloping ahead while the general public's
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:23.820]  distracted with the latest pop culture garbage.
[01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:26.900]  The editor of the New American magazine, William F.
[01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:28.700]  Jasper, is going to join us for about 40 minutes
[01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:29.900]  in the next hour.
[01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:31.700]  Then I'll continue with news towards the end.
[01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:34.300]  But here's some of the other news that we have.
[01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:38.540]  This just broke at infowars.com.
[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:40.300]  Kit Daniels did this story.
[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:42.380]  Report, teacher tells students, Jesus
[01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:44.180]  is not allowed in the school.
[01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:45.340]  You can't have a cross.
[01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:46.660]  You can't talk about Jesus.
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:49.140]  Now, folks, that violates your First Amendment.
[01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:54.820]  The school, if it's public, cannot have an official religion.
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:57.260]  That's the First Amendment.
[01:54:57.260 --> 01:54:59.580]  It's the right of religion and that the government has
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:00.260]  no jurisdiction.
[01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:02.540]  But this is what they're doing by design.
[01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:04.900]  It's not an ignorant teacher doing this.
[01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:07.780]  This is authoritarianism.
[01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:12.860]  Teacher trashes a message his first grader brought to class
[01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:16.620]  referring to Christ as nonprofit group.
[01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:17.980]  School teacher told the first grader
[01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:19.300]  that Jesus is not allowed in the school
[01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:22.260]  while tearing off messages, reciting a religious legend
[01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:24.540]  that the student attached to candy canes
[01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:30.340]  he brought for his class as nonprofit group reports.
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:31.540]  And this is just standard, folks.
[01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:33.300]  They throw bibles in the trash can if you bring them
[01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:34.180]  to many schools.
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:36.260]  And again, the child could bring anything they wanted.
[01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:40.140]  Pokemon cards, Satanism stuff.
[01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:43.020]  Here's a, of course, that'd be fine, of course, all the Harry
[01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:43.860]  Potter stuff and all that.
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:45.100]  That's religious.
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:49.860]  New York City group applies to build Satan statue at Oklahoma
[01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:51.420]  State Capitol.
[01:55:51.420 --> 01:56:00.340]  And it has two children lovingly standing beside Bathomet.
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:02.420]  So there you go in that stun.
[01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:04.580]  I guess he wants to rape him or kill him
[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:05.900]  because that's what Satan does.
[01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:09.980]  All about his own personal power in doing whatever old Satan
[01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:11.980]  wants, whether you believe in Satan or not,
[01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:15.740]  the globalists have basically manifested this thing themselves.
[01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:18.740]  Again, there is a lot of heat getting generated in all 50
[01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:21.580]  states by illegal checkpoints on the highway
[01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:24.780]  where the police direct you into an area with flashing lights
[01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:30.660]  and cones and then intimidate you into giving blood, saliva,
[01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:32.780]  tissue.
[01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:35.300]  Looks like Barack Obama is there lovingly by his father.
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:37.180]  That little kid looks like Barack Obama.
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:38.740]  I know they should put that at the White House
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:40.460]  to be more accurate about what they really do.
[01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:42.940]  They should put that out in front of all the Planned Parenthoods
[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:44.820]  and say, come on in.
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:47.780]  Kill a baby for me.
[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:49.020]  Of course, those women don't.
[01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:51.380]  I mean, I guess Satan give them power for doing that.
[01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:52.300]  Continuing here.
[01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:58.380]  California legislators introduced Bill to banish the NSA.
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:56:59.580]  That's all just on the surface.
[01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:01.740]  They're involved in every criminal activity you can imagine.
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:03.660]  And then how the NSA almost killed the internet,
[01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:06.700]  wired magazine, I told you that in the last 20 years,
[01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:10.660]  they paid off telecoms to put in NSA hubs.
[01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:12.260]  And the telecoms get paid to do that.
[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:15.060]  And Microsoft and Google and all the rest of them.
[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:16.060]  Amazons involved.
[01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:17.340]  That's all come out.
[01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:19.060]  But then there was an attempted takeover
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:21.660]  in cybersecurity of even their systems.
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:25.060]  And so it's kind of like the CIA and NSA fight,
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:27.460]  or the Pentagon and the CIA fight over turf.
[01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:29.140]  Well, the private corporate folks
[01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:30.700]  who helped engineer all this, they
[01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:33.580]  had a fight with the government over who runs all this.
[01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:35.380]  And they won.
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:38.940]  And the media billed them with a big inside story
[01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:42.540]  about how cybersecurity didn't get passed.
[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:45.820]  Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other tech titans
[01:57:45.820 --> 01:57:49.580]  had to fight for their lives against their own government.
[01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:50.300]  Their own government.
[01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:50.980]  It is their government.
[01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:51.540]  They created it.
[01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:52.500]  The criminal government.
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:55.100]  An exclusive look inside their year from hell.
[01:57:55.100 --> 01:57:57.300]  And why the internet will never be the same.
[01:57:57.300 --> 01:57:59.300]  And they say, yeah, they didn't get fully taken over,
[01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:01.540]  but they kind of did.
[01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:05.140]  That's right. Isn't that just sweet?
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:08.060]  And the trendies are telling you the government's the threat.
[01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:12.060]  Folks, these big corporations are the government.
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:16.220]  So again, that's how they spin this whole thing.
[01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:18.340]  So that's the news behind the news.
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:22.340]  The rest of the story, as they say,
[01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:25.580]  we've got a bunch of Obamacare news coming up.
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:28.180]  Also, what smartphones do inside your bedroom.
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:29.860]  Bloomberg's reporting on.
[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:32.380]  And EPA's coming to ban your fireplace.
[01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:33.780]  So get ready.
[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:36.300]  The third hour is coming up.
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:37.780]  Infowars.gov.
[01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:47.060]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:53.380]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:58:53.380 --> 01:58:56.860]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system
[01:58:56.860 --> 01:58:58.380]  runs from bad to worse.
[01:58:58.380 --> 01:59:01.300]  The globalist model is to shut down societies
[01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:04.540]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:05.700]  to the global takeover.
[01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:07.380]  That's why we've assembled the most vital
[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:11.300]  and important preparedness items at InfowarsShop.com.
[01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:13.580]  These are items that I did research on,
[01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:15.340]  that I personally use.
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:16.620]  You've got the life straw,
[01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:19.020]  so you can turn fetted water into safe water
[01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:20.060]  anywhere you go.
[01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:22.100]  The K-Tour hand crank generator
[01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:24.580]  to charge up key equipment during power outages
[01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:25.500]  are out in the field.
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:28.780]  A strategic relocation, third edition by Joel Scalzen.
[01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:31.300]  When disaster strikes by Matthew Stein,
[01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:33.500]  they're a safe use by Homeland Security
[01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:36.020]  to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:38.860]  Hand crank shortwave AMFM radios.
[01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:40.300]  Everything that we've researched
[01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:43.500]  and found to be the best is available at InfowarsShop.com
[01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:46.140]  and your purchase makes our Infowars possible.
[01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:47.300]  We're getting prepared.
[01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:50.060]  Are you InfowarsShop.com?
[01:59:50.060 --> 01:59:52.380]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:55.860]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:03.860 --> 02:00:06.780]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:06.780 --> 02:00:08.220]  You want answers?
[02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:09.780]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:13.860]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:16.740]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:21.260]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.260 --> 02:00:31.780]  We've got the video up on Infowars.com
[02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:33.900]  with all these innocent DC husses
[02:00:33.900 --> 02:00:37.260]  saying Obama should act as a dictator.
[02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:39.020]  There's video of this.
[02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:40.460]  You guys gave me a great video list.
[02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:41.180]  I can't find it.
[02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:42.220]  I'm not even sure if we have it,
[02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:44.020]  but I saw the video this morning.
[02:00:44.020 --> 02:00:47.940]  Al Sharpton literally donned a white lab coat
[02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:49.740]  like he's a doctor,
[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:51.340]  and he says these right-wingers
[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:53.380]  are boiling over with denial.
[02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:54.220]  We do have it.
[02:00:54.220 --> 02:00:55.340]  I'm gonna play that in a moment.
[02:00:55.340 --> 02:00:56.780]  About global warming.
[02:00:56.780 --> 02:00:59.180]  It's real, folks, and that's what's causing
[02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:01.940]  the record cold temperatures.
[02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:07.020]  Who's that top astrophysicist with the big weather center
[02:01:07.020 --> 02:01:10.540]  in England I've had on so many times over the years
[02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:15.380]  who was on back in the summer and predicted a record cold winter
[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:19.540]  because the sun was going into a dormant phase?
[02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:20.380]  What's his name?
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:21.860]  I brought his card back from Bilderberg
[02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:23.940]  because I was there covering it and he was there.
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:24.780]  It doesn't matter.
[02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:26.540]  He looks like the mad scientist.
[02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:28.540]  And I mean, that guy comes on like a year before,
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:31.260]  six months before, and just exactly what he says happens
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:34.420]  because he's an astrophysicist and a meteorologist.
[02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:37.620]  And I can't believe I've got to explain to Al Sharpton.
[02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:41.660]  Of course, he knows, and Al Gore, of course, who knows,
[02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:45.380]  that it's the sun is the main driver.
[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:47.220]  Yeah, Pierce Corbin, that's his name.
[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:50.340]  Pierce Corbin, not Pierce Morgan, Pierce Corbin.
[02:01:50.340 --> 02:01:51.940]  Yeah, let's pull the side up and show folks.
[02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:54.620]  But he predicted record cold
[02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:58.340]  because the sun was going into a dormant phase,
[02:01:58.340 --> 02:02:02.580]  was cooling off, was not putting off as much heat.
[02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:07.180]  Now, I'm not a meteorologist or an astrophysicist like him,
[02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:12.180]  but we stand next to the sun's fire to quote Jimi Hendrix.
[02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:15.860]  And we would be absolute zero,
[02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:17.500]  weather action, that's the site.
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:20.300]  We would be at absolute zero.
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:25.700]  If it wasn't, it's time to get him back on next week.
[02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:28.660]  If it wasn't for the sun, now the UN voted five years ago
[02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:30.900]  and said the sun has no effect on climate.
[02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:35.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is like saying
[02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:38.180]  in freezing cold weather standing next to a fire
[02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:40.860]  has no effect on whether you're hot or cold.
[02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:44.340]  Or like if you jump in a fire, it won't set you on fire.
[02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:45.820]  The sun goes through cycles
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:48.780]  and it's going into a cooling cycle.
[02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:51.020]  So the ice caps of Mars,
[02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:53.380]  that I assure you your SUVs aren't hurting,
[02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:55.220]  they're now getting bigger again.
[02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:56.700]  Our ice caps are getting bigger.
[02:02:56.700 --> 02:03:00.740]  Now, again, radiation being released, GMO, toxic waste,
[02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:02.220]  that's a real issue.
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:04.140]  I'm at the top of the food chain just like you are
[02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:06.540]  as a mammal, as a homo sapien sapien.
[02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:08.380]  I want a clean environment.
[02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:11.260]  The fake environmental movement is about a power grab.
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:13.620]  I'm not worried about a farmer's wood stove
[02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:15.860]  that the EPA wants to ban.
[02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:18.380]  I'm worried about nuclear reactors leaking.
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:21.020]  I'm worried about the Chinese having backcodes
[02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:23.980]  Chinese government into our computers
[02:03:23.980 --> 02:03:25.700]  and into our weapons systems.
[02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:27.380]  Let's go to the y'all Sharpton clip.
[02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:29.380]  And then we'll come back.
[02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:30.860]  Somebody going around for the first time
[02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:33.140]  with a guy or a counter is likely to discover
[02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:35.900]  these great variations in levels from time to time.
[02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:38.460]  UC Berkeley professor Edward Morse says,
[02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:40.900]  they called it unusually thick ice.
[02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:43.580]  Well, I think it's because they're unusually thick people
[02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:44.620]  who have not been paying attention
[02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:46.380]  to the actual science on global warming
[02:03:46.380 --> 02:03:47.660]  for the past 18 years.
[02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:50.420]  And still think that we're all about to roast
[02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:51.940]  like a chestnut at open fire.
[02:03:53.020 --> 02:03:57.020]  These right wingers are boiling over with denial
[02:03:57.020 --> 02:04:00.020]  just because it snows in winter.
[02:04:00.020 --> 02:04:03.660]  Doesn't mean the planet isn't getting warmer.
[02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:08.580]  Remember, a UN panel said there's a 90% probability
[02:04:08.580 --> 02:04:12.300]  that humans are the primary cause of global warming.
[02:04:12.300 --> 02:04:15.860]  And over 97% of climate researchers
[02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:20.860]  surveyed in the United States Academy of Science agrees.
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:24.700]  It sure doesn't take much for the folks at Fox
[02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:26.260]  to hit their melting point.
[02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:30.380]  The results of tonight's experiments are in
[02:04:30.380 --> 02:04:32.780]  and we've deduced the right wing
[02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:35.460]  could use a new charging point.
[02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:37.020]  Turned out almost none of those scientists
[02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:38.180]  ever signed on to that report.
[02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:39.860]  They just agreed to be part of the panel.
[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:40.940]  That's all a lie.
[02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:43.420]  That's been discredited for four years.
[02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:44.620]  Now it's not global warming.
[02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:46.020]  It's climate change.
[02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:47.820]  Well, the climate's always changing.
[02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:50.540]  Hey, Sharpton, why don't you talk about
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:52.940]  the radiation levels going up?
[02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:55.140]  No, no, no, because Al Gore doesn't have
[02:04:55.140 --> 02:04:57.220]  a radiation trading market.
[02:04:57.220 --> 02:04:58.740]  And neither does Barack Obama.
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:01.900]  Alex Jones here to tell you about
[02:05:01.900 --> 02:05:04.020]  how you can help spread liberty worldwide.
[02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:05.580]  I'll also enjoy what I have found
[02:05:05.580 --> 02:05:09.420]  to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:10.700]  for more than a decade.
[02:05:10.700 --> 02:05:12.180]  My favorite coffee has come
[02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:14.140]  from the high mountains of Southern Mexico
[02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:15.340]  where the Chiapas farmers
[02:05:15.340 --> 02:05:17.820]  grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:20.860]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans
[02:05:20.860 --> 02:05:22.700]  in a highly customized blend.

[02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:36.660]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:38.580]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:41.180]  And it's taken us years to secure connections
[02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:43.700]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[02:05:57.820 --> 02:06:00.300]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:02.140]  Introducing Pro 1.

[02:06:10.420 --> 02:06:12.900]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride
[02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:16.500]  and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilic acid.
[02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:18.300]  Advanced manufacturing technology
[02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:20.900]  combines silver impregnated white ceramic

[02:06:41.580 --> 02:06:45.060]  ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilic acid.
[02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:46.740]  The most common form of fluoride,
[02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:48.900]  not covered by other fluoride filter brands
[02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:51.300]  and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:02.420]  The facts are in, the studies are legion.
[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:04.980]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members
[02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:07.660]  of the fluoride family are devastating the health
[02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:09.940]  and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:13.700]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:16.300]  Simple, dumb down the host population
[02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:19.100]  that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:21.140]  We may not have been able to get fluoride
[02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:22.540]  out of the water supply yet,
[02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:24.780]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:26.820]  I am extremely excited to announce
[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:30.380]  the exclusive info wars life fluoride shield formulation,
[02:07:30.380 --> 02:07:33.540]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients
[02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:36.300]  from around the world to help the body remove
[02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:38.780]  not just toxic fluoride residues from the body,
[02:07:38.780 --> 02:07:41.140]  but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:43.140]  Let's take a stand against the globalist
[02:07:43.140 --> 02:07:45.660]  by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:47.820]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[02:07:47.820 --> 02:07:49.380]  Secure your fluoride shield
[02:07:49.380 --> 02:07:53.420]  and other pioneering formulations at infowarslife.com today.
[02:07:53.420 --> 02:07:55.420]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now
[02:07:55.420 --> 02:07:57.860]  and support the info war at the same time.
[02:07:57.860 --> 02:07:59.900]  That's infowarslife.com.
[02:07:59.900 --> 02:08:15.900]  MUSIC
[02:08:15.900 --> 02:08:20.900]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:30.900]  MUSIC
[02:08:30.900 --> 02:08:33.900]  Isn't it epic?
[02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:35.900]  We actually follow the ice core samples,
[02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:40.900]  the meteorologists, the real astrophysicists,
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:46.900]  and the vast majority of them are on record
[02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:50.900]  saying the sun is the main driver of climate.
[02:08:50.900 --> 02:08:54.900]  And the only constant is change.
[02:08:54.900 --> 02:08:58.900]  So now they've gone from global freezing in the 60s and 70s
[02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:01.900]  as being the reason for a global government
[02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:04.900]  with the UN regulating all human activity,
[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:08.900]  to the 90s it's global warming because the sun had heated up
[02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:10.900]  and that we were all going to die
[02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:14.900]  if we didn't have a global VAT and global carbon tax
[02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:17.900]  to now moving to just change period.
[02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:20.900]  There's a tornado, there's a hurricane, there's a typhoon,
[02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:22.900]  they've always had those.
[02:09:22.900 --> 02:09:25.900]  Doesn't matter if we're at a 60 year low of tornadoes,
[02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:29.900]  they have MSNBC say we have all time high tornadoes
[02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:32.900]  even though NOAA, they can't get the entire government to lie,
[02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:37.900]  came out last year and said we're at a 60 year low for tornadoes.
[02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:41.900]  Just type in NOAA, 60 year low for tornadoes
[02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:43.900]  and you'll get their own website.
[02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:47.900]  But you turn on MSNBC or Al Jazeera with Al Gore,
[02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:51.900]  his channel with Al Jazeera and it is we're all dead
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:54.900]  if we don't do whatever they say politically.
[02:09:54.900 --> 02:09:58.900]  And that's live in tiny houses and pay ex-urbanant taxes to them
[02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:02.900]  and ban wood stoves and ban factories and ban clean burning coal
[02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:06.900]  but oh have all the nuclear reactors leaking you want, that's fine.
[02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:09.900]  And I was just in the coffee room again
[02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:12.900]  drinking out of my Gooling's Lodge Monument Valley.
[02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:16.900]  This is John Wayne's favorite little shack hotel, literally.
[02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:21.900]  That's where he stayed like 10 times shooting movies out there.
[02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:23.900]  So beautiful Monument Valley, Utah.
[02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:28.900]  The point is I was back there getting a cup of our coffee,
[02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:31.900]  Wags of America blend from southern Mexico
[02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:36.900]  and I was watching CNN and they had the meteorologist on there
[02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:40.900]  saying that this is a 20 year fluke event
[02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:43.900]  and that global warming is still real.
[02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:46.900]  Even though overall world temperatures have been going down
[02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:50.900]  in the last five years and have been constant before that for 16 years,
[02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:52.900]  I mean we know the numbers, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:52.900 --> 02:10:56.900]  They get on television and tell people that polar bears can't swim,
[02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:58.900]  that penguins can't swim.
[02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:04.900]  I've shown you student class projects that I saw in a pizza place
[02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:07.900]  where they had the wall covered with them in Corpus Christi a few years ago.
[02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:10.900]  I shot video of this where it showed all the penguins
[02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:13.900]  and polar bears drowning because there was no more ice
[02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:16.900]  and it showed dozens of these from the school projects
[02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:20.900]  showing the polar bears and penguins dying done by fifth graders
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:24.900]  traumatizing their mind in government curricula
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:27.900]  that the north and south polar were going to melt
[02:11:27.900 --> 02:11:29.900]  and that all the animals would die.
[02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:32.900]  Unless you pay Al Gore and the UN money.
[02:11:32.900 --> 02:11:34.900]  So here are the facts.
[02:11:34.900 --> 02:11:40.900]  The sun is what drives our main climate unless it's an undersea volcanic vent
[02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:46.900]  and then they found microorganisms that do live from the heat of the water.
[02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:50.900]  But everything else one way or another is driven off the sun.
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:55.900]  I don't care if you're 5,000 feet under and you are a glow-in-the-dark fish
[02:11:55.900 --> 02:12:00.900]  like a lantern fish, the cycle of food that you end up eating
[02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:04.900]  begins on the surface in the first hundred feet of the water
[02:12:04.900 --> 02:12:08.900]  that causes the life cycle in the ocean.
[02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:12.900]  Just like they say the only toxic waste we need to control
[02:12:12.900 --> 02:12:16.900]  basically is carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen,
[02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:18.900]  sunlight and water.
[02:12:18.900 --> 02:12:20.900]  You need those four things.
[02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:23.900]  Well, people aren't scared of water.
[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:26.900]  People aren't scared of sunlight.
[02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:28.900]  They know oxygen is good.
[02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:30.900]  So carbon dioxide.
[02:12:30.900 --> 02:12:34.900]  We've gone out in Austin and gotten 9 out of 10 people to sign a form
[02:12:34.900 --> 02:12:37.900]  including one guy that claimed he was a chemical engineer
[02:12:37.900 --> 02:12:42.900]  to ban dihydrogen monoxide which is water because the scary name
[02:12:42.900 --> 02:12:50.900]  and sodium chloride which is salt because it sounds scary.
[02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:56.900]  And this is how they use ignorance in the public to enslave us as a power grab
[02:12:56.900 --> 02:13:00.900]  while ignoring all the real environmental problems.
[02:13:00.900 --> 02:13:03.900]  Chicago extreme cold.
[02:13:03.900 --> 02:13:08.900]  The worst ever recorded lowest temperature ever recorded in Chicago.
[02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:12.900]  I see weather threatens oil output from Texas and North Dakota
[02:13:12.900 --> 02:13:14.900]  because it's so cold.
[02:13:14.900 --> 02:13:17.900]  Cold weather causes surge in demand for Texas electricity grid
[02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:20.900]  for West Artelogram because of a third of our power plants
[02:13:20.900 --> 02:13:25.900]  including a new one in South Texas in Corpus Christi
[02:13:25.900 --> 02:13:28.900]  that they did not allow to open.
[02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:32.900]  A $3 billion clean burning coal power plant that they didn't let open
[02:13:32.900 --> 02:13:35.900]  took them years to build, Obama shut it down.
[02:13:35.900 --> 02:13:37.900]  General Electric is exempt.
[02:13:37.900 --> 02:13:39.900]  They've got dirty burning plants.
[02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:42.900]  They get to make bigger profits.
[02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:44.900]  But it's still not enough for demand.
[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:48.900]  Just like in Chalcescu's Romania, they had enough power for the public
[02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:52.900]  but he decided the public didn't need electricity except for his government facilities
[02:13:52.900 --> 02:13:57.900]  and his factories as an act of control, as an act of siege,
[02:13:57.900 --> 02:14:00.900]  as a clowered and pivoted act of domination.
[02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:02.900]  So we told you that was coming years ago.
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:06.900]  The White House responded three years ago to our report about Obama saying
[02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:09.900]  he would bankrupt coal and they came out and said we were insane.
[02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:14.900]  Climate change groups seek new leadership as green movement loses momentum.
[02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:17.900]  Doesn't matter though, they still put the carbon taxes in.
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:22.900]  As the MSNBC host called for Obama to act as a dictator yesterday
[02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:28.900]  but again, Al Sharpton says that the right-wingers are boiling over with denial
[02:14:28.900 --> 02:14:32.900]  about global warming.
[02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:36.900]  Continuing, EPA moves to regulate new wood stuff.
[02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:38.900]  Told you that was coming folks, they already did it in Europe.
[02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:40.900]  We know exactly what they're going to do.
[02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:44.900]  Scientists reject claims of coal being caused by global warming.
[02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:49.900]  Time Magazine blamed polar vortex on global warming in 1974's special report.
[02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:51.900]  That's global cooling.
[02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:54.900]  That's out of climate depot.
[02:14:54.900 --> 02:14:57.900]  So first it's global cooling then global warming.
[02:14:57.900 --> 02:14:58.900]  So it just continues.
[02:14:58.900 --> 02:15:04.900]  Meteorologist tells Hannity the ghost of global warming is closing coal plants.
[02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:06.900]  That's right.
[02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:11.900]  Indianapolis mayor, if you're outside for 10 minutes you could be dead without proper clothes
[02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:15.900]  as if we need the government to tell us to put our clothes on.
[02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:17.900]  I thought mommy did that.
[02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:26.900]  Cold weather causes surge in demand not just here but all over the country like in Chattanooga region.
[02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:29.900]  And again, less power plants, they can't supply it.
[02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:31.900]  So that's just some of the news.
[02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:35.900]  Travelers spend night on three snowbound Amtrak trains.
[02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:44.900]  Coldest air in 20 years, aimed at nation's heartland below zero in many areas.
[02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:47.900]  It just goes on and on.
[02:15:47.900 --> 02:15:53.900]  But the con artist doubled down the Al Sharptons, the Al Gore's.
[02:15:53.900 --> 02:15:57.900]  They double down and say, no, this is the proof.
[02:15:57.900 --> 02:15:59.900]  Pay us carbon taxes.
[02:15:59.900 --> 02:16:02.900]  Well, even if you believe carbon dioxide is deadly poison and killing everyone,
[02:16:02.900 --> 02:16:09.900]  even though plants breathe it and then put out or use it for photosynthesis and then put out oxygen.
[02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:13.900]  If China builds three new ones a week and we shut down more than three a week,
[02:16:13.900 --> 02:16:18.900]  if Mexico just builds literally hundreds of them on their border to supply the Southwest totally dirty
[02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:23.900]  and putting out all this toxic waste and we have clean ones being shut down and the earth is one planet,
[02:16:23.900 --> 02:16:28.900]  if carbon dioxide is so evil, then why isn't it being shut down there?
[02:16:28.900 --> 02:16:31.900]  Because the globalist control us and they control those countries.
[02:16:31.900 --> 02:16:38.900]  What globalism is, is moving industry to areas you control to then leverage out the economies of the West
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:47.900]  to then prepare us for economic collapse and then we can be socially reeducated into the collectivist model.
[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:53.900]  And don't worry, once the full collectivist communism is in place with the fascist above it,
[02:16:53.900 --> 02:17:00.900]  offshore above the law with diplomatic and corporate immunity, true feudalism, true North Korean hereditary dictatorships,
[02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:03.900]  once that happens, there's going to be nobody on welfare folks.
[02:17:03.900 --> 02:17:08.900]  They're going to be at gunpoint digging ditches and working in basically slave factories.
[02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:12.900]  Once they break us fully, it's going to be Soviet style jackbooting.
[02:17:12.900 --> 02:17:17.900]  So all you people that have loved the ride so far, you're going to lose all of it.
[02:17:17.900 --> 02:17:22.900]  And those of us that are skilled workers, oh, you're going to be total slaves under this.
[02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:25.900]  Now William F. Jasper joins us for the balance of the hour
[02:17:25.900 --> 02:17:30.900]  and he is the editor of the New American magazine, newamerican.com
[02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:36.900]  and there at the tip of the spear, exposing what's really happening with corporate global government being established.
[02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:39.900]  But we've only got a few minutes before we go to break Mr. Jasper.
[02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:43.900]  Can you give us the definition of this global government?
[02:17:43.900 --> 02:17:45.900]  What political system would you call it?
[02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:51.900]  I call it neo feudalistic serfdom or fascism with a scientific control, technocracy.
[02:17:51.900 --> 02:17:55.900]  What would you call it and what would you sum it up in two minutes?
[02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:59.900]  Well, that's probably as good a definition as any Alex.
[02:17:59.900 --> 02:18:09.900]  What we are going to see is a cacostocracy, a rule by the worst, an aristocracy,
[02:18:09.900 --> 02:18:15.900]  the wealthiest, most powerful, controlling all aspects of our lives,
[02:18:15.900 --> 02:18:24.900]  social, political, economic, spiritual, moral, dictating where we shall live,
[02:18:24.900 --> 02:18:28.900]  if we shall live, where we shall work, if we will work.
[02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:33.900]  We are going to see total power and total power creates total corruption.
[02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:40.900]  And so whether one defines it as communism, socialism, fascism, or a combination of those,
[02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:43.900]  it will be an oligarchic elite.
[02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:45.900]  And we are already moving in that direction.
[02:18:45.900 --> 02:18:52.900]  And what you just talked about with the global warming is a very good example
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:59.900]  of what we see this process in action and moving us toward a globalist elite.
[02:18:59.900 --> 02:19:07.900]  And I did a story on this a year ago when they had the big Doha conference on global warming.
[02:19:07.900 --> 02:19:14.900]  And the United Nations chief in charge of the UNFCCC, which is the global warming thing,
[02:19:14.900 --> 02:19:21.900]  Cristiana Figueres, said that what we are after is a total transformation of the world,
[02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:26.900]  a total economic transformation, political transformation of the world.
[02:19:26.900 --> 02:19:33.900]  Well, we've been saying that and using various quotes of the leading advocates
[02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:39.900]  to show that this is what they're doing for years, but so seldom have they come out,
[02:19:39.900 --> 02:19:44.900]  the head of the organization, at one of their major conferences confirming what we're doing.
[02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:47.900]  That's right. Stay there. We're going to come back and get into convergence.
[02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:51.900]  The latest breaking news, the real inside scoop on somebody that's been to scores of the meetings
[02:19:51.900 --> 02:19:53.900]  on what's being formed right now.
[02:19:53.900 --> 02:19:56.900]  And by the way, folks, this is the total transformation.
[02:19:56.900 --> 02:19:59.900]  Are you liking it? Are you liking being poor?
[02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:03.900]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide.
[02:20:03.900 --> 02:20:08.900]  I'm also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:13.900]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[02:20:13.900 --> 02:20:17.900]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:22.900]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:20:22.900 --> 02:20:28.900]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at infowarslife.com.
[02:20:28.900 --> 02:20:33.900]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[02:20:33.900 --> 02:20:35.900]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:20:35.900 --> 02:20:37.900]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:20:37.900 --> 02:20:42.900]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:20:42.900 --> 02:20:47.900]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:04.900]  We travel so much and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[02:22:04.900 --> 02:22:08.900]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:14.900]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[02:22:14.900 --> 02:22:20.900]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window
[02:22:20.900 --> 02:22:24.900]  and know that passing motors and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV
[02:22:24.900 --> 02:22:26.900]  when I'm actually away from home.
[02:22:26.900 --> 02:22:31.900]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[02:22:31.900 --> 02:22:35.900]  And they're so easy to use, you just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[02:22:35.900 --> 02:22:39.900]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.

[02:24:23.900 --> 02:24:28.900]  This is a short 6-minute segment and 18-minute segment coming up.
[02:24:53.900 --> 02:24:56.900]  In this short segment, I want to just talk about strategy with you.
[02:24:56.900 --> 02:25:01.900]  A, do you agree with me? Where are we geopolitically right now and just politically?
[02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:07.900]  A, B, the more and more of the stuff they're doing, illegally spying, persecuting press,
[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:12.900]  it's like we're too nice and I've never been a radical calling for violence and I'm not.
[02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:21.900]  But the historical proper response would be state grand juries, arrests, 1776 trials.
[02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:25.900]  This is a global corporate espionage takeover.
[02:25:25.900 --> 02:25:28.900]  So how do you respond to them?
[02:25:28.900 --> 02:25:32.900]  Well, this is what we're dealing with here.
[02:25:32.900 --> 02:25:38.900]  Yesterday we had the confirmation vote of Janet Yellen as chairman of the Federal Reserve,
[02:25:38.900 --> 02:25:43.900]  which is one of the biggest criminal operations in the history of the world.
[02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:49.900]  It just has transferred an untold number of trillions of dollars from American taxpayers
[02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:54.900]  and earners to Wall Street, to the politically connected banks.
[02:25:54.900 --> 02:25:57.900]  This is the largest case of robbery in the history of the world.
[02:25:57.900 --> 02:26:06.900]  So we're dealing with criminality on a global level and at a level that has never been seen here in America before.
[02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:08.900]  And so, yes, this is very serious.
[02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:10.900]  We will not have any freedom left.
[02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:16.900]  We will not have any economic security left to withstand the forces of globalism.
[02:26:16.900 --> 02:26:26.900]  If we do not incur it, if we do not get enough people riled up now and educated to take the proper action,
[02:26:26.900 --> 02:26:29.900]  Congress has to hold these people accountable.
[02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:33.900]  And yesterday's vote, obviously they did not.
[02:26:33.900 --> 02:26:37.900]  56 to 26 voted for that.
[02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:47.900]  11 members of the Senate Republicans crossed party lines and voted with the Obama Democrats to confirm her,
[02:26:47.900 --> 02:26:55.900]  basically saying that we're going to allow this criminality to run rampant continuously.
[02:26:55.900 --> 02:27:04.900]  And, you know, we have to get enough people to realize that if we allow this to happen,
[02:27:04.900 --> 02:27:13.900]  we basically allowed the mafia, a mafia with Yale and Harvard and Georgetown law degrees
[02:27:13.900 --> 02:27:18.900]  and MBAs and PhDs to take over the economy.
[02:27:18.900 --> 02:27:23.900]  But it is a mafia on a much larger scale than the actual mafia.
[02:27:23.900 --> 02:27:30.900]  Holly was on a great job the last 60 years convincing us that only Italian organized crime exist.
[02:27:30.900 --> 02:27:34.900]  And I've studied the history of it. They got a little too big for their britches.
[02:27:34.900 --> 02:27:40.900]  And so some of the older banking mobs and other mobs came in and basically took them to the woodshed.
[02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:47.900]  But even in the 40s and 50s, as you know, the head of the FBI would testify that there is no such thing as organized crime.
[02:27:47.900 --> 02:27:57.900]  Absolutely. For a long time, Hoover said that this was all comic book stuff, that there was no such thing as an FBI.
[02:27:57.900 --> 02:28:08.900]  And he told the big Appalachia bus and Joseph Vellacci coming forward that finally Americans had confirmation about the mafia.
[02:28:08.900 --> 02:28:16.900]  Well, we've been saying the same thing about a much more pernicious mafia, that is the secret or semi-secret organizations,
[02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:20.900]  such as the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Bilderbergs.
[02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:26.900]  These are much higher level criminal operations than the mafia.
[02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:37.900]  Now, the mafia and the drug cartels and all organized crime operations attempt to create a front of respectability.
[02:28:37.900 --> 02:28:44.900]  And so you have even amongst the various organized crime, mafia, Russian, mafia, et cetera,
[02:28:44.900 --> 02:28:50.900]  you have folks that try to portray themselves as legitimate businessmen.
[02:28:50.900 --> 02:29:00.900]  Well, we have the same thing with the organizations, the Wall Street folks that are operating our Federal Reserve System
[02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:05.900]  and the Worldwide Banking System, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
[02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:15.900]  But they start out at a much higher level. They already have all of the respectable backgrounds, the degrees, the major corporate backgrounds.
[02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:24.900]  And so it's going to take a herculean effort on our part. And you're definitely doing your part to alert Americans to this,
[02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:33.900]  that look, these folks are evil. They're criminals. And it doesn't matter that they may be CEOs of various companies
[02:29:33.900 --> 02:29:38.900]  and so-called respected Wall Street banks, they have taken trillions of dollars.
[02:29:38.900 --> 02:29:41.900]  That's right. By every yardstick, they're the greatest criminals in history.
[02:29:41.900 --> 02:29:47.900]  And I'm going to give people some key information, some key information on the other side of this break.
[02:29:47.900 --> 02:30:16.900]  Stay with us.
[02:30:17.900 --> 02:30:24.900]  A company run by patriots for patriots was born. MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:30:24.900 --> 02:30:30.900]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men and women.
[02:30:30.900 --> 02:30:33.900]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.

[02:30:59.900 --> 02:31:04.900]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:31:04.900 --> 02:31:13.900]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[02:31:13.900 --> 02:31:21.900]  It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:31:21.900 --> 02:31:28.900]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:31:28.900 --> 02:31:34.900]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:31:59.900 --> 02:32:10.900]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:32:10.900 --> 02:32:13.900]  Guess what else is in the halogen family? Fluoride.
[02:32:13.900 --> 02:32:21.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here. In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:32:21.900 --> 02:32:32.900]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record, reports documented, a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:32:32.900 --> 02:32:41.900]  Bottom line, iodine is important. Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[02:32:59.900 --> 02:33:17.900]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:33:17.900 --> 02:33:32.900]  Here's the information just on the front of knowing that we can win.
[02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:45.900]  With all of these different criminal actions throughout history, studying different regions, different empires, different nations, corrupt combines,
[02:33:45.900 --> 02:33:56.900]  monopoly, fascist, socialist, communist, corporatist, as Mussolini called them, always operate from behind the scenes because what they're doing is a fraud.
[02:33:56.900 --> 02:34:05.900]  They always set up the same police states, the same spy networks, the same controlled economies. They always want to make the public poor so that they can control them with chicken feed,
[02:34:05.900 --> 02:34:15.900]  like the way the Democrats adopted the public strategy to bankrupt America and put us all on welfare so they could social engineer us.
[02:34:15.900 --> 02:34:22.900]  That's just one modern example of that that people now know the definition of, so I talk about it. I talked about Cloward and Piven 15 years ago.
[02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:27.900]  Glenn Beck popularized it so now people know what I'm talking about, so I've brought it back.
[02:34:27.900 --> 02:34:33.980]  For example, you read Roman Senate histories, which I've done, incredibly interesting.
[02:34:33.980 --> 02:34:36.340]  Or you read books written by Julius Caesar.
[02:34:36.340 --> 02:34:41.900]  Or you read books written by British kings or by crown historians.
[02:34:41.900 --> 02:34:44.620]  It is jam-packed every page.
[02:34:44.620 --> 02:34:48.980]  It's not like reading science fiction or something where you read a whole book to read a battle.
[02:34:48.980 --> 02:34:52.980]  Every page is just chronicles of what was going on and how they paid off this group
[02:34:52.980 --> 02:34:56.300]  and how they manipulated that group and infighting inside this.
[02:34:56.300 --> 02:35:02.180]  The battle for humanity has always been about the individuals organizing together in like-minded
[02:35:02.180 --> 02:35:07.740]  groups against criminals, psychopaths, control freaks, organizing into their groups against
[02:35:07.740 --> 02:35:10.020]  us.
[02:35:10.020 --> 02:35:11.660]  And the globalists all know this.
[02:35:11.660 --> 02:35:15.740]  Carol Quigley and others in their books describe that once they get this new collectivist system,
[02:35:15.740 --> 02:35:19.660]  they're going to make it work this time because of science and technology.
[02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:24.260]  But all they're using that for now is to even game the system even more and insulate themselves
[02:35:24.260 --> 02:35:28.740]  from reality so that the crash will be that much worse.
[02:35:28.740 --> 02:35:30.460]  It's unsustainable.
[02:35:30.460 --> 02:35:35.220]  And so just as 60-something years ago, the media said there was no such thing as organized
[02:35:35.220 --> 02:35:36.220]  crime.
[02:35:36.220 --> 02:35:39.260]  It was a conspiracy theory in movies.
[02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:45.700]  The mafia had been operating different mafias for 100 years in this nation, different mafias.
[02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:52.420]  Mafia means our thing or the family or a La Cosa Nostra.
[02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:58.780]  But once they had to admit it was real, once it came out, then everyone was like, well,
[02:35:58.780 --> 02:36:03.100]  of course it was always real, and a lot of it could be, quote, tackled.
[02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:04.700]  And it's the same thing with the Federal Reserve.
[02:36:04.700 --> 02:36:10.180]  If you look at the Federal Reserve, folks, it's Bugsy Siegel, all those folks.
[02:36:10.180 --> 02:36:14.740]  It's all these big, powerful combines and elites.
[02:36:14.740 --> 02:36:16.020]  The Kennedys were involved.
[02:36:16.020 --> 02:36:20.220]  So many other groups, and of course Kennedy later was going to get rid of it, all the
[02:36:20.220 --> 02:36:24.140]  big Eastern establishment was involved in it.
[02:36:24.140 --> 02:36:28.260]  They met at Jekyll Island with J.P. Morgan and all of them in 1913.
[02:36:28.260 --> 02:36:30.260]  We know what happened.
[02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:35.580]  They even brag about it now today and have historians from the Fed basically admit what's
[02:36:35.580 --> 02:36:36.580]  happened.
[02:36:36.580 --> 02:36:39.060]  So here's the big news.
[02:36:39.060 --> 02:36:45.380]  The John Burt Society, New American Magazine, other Liberty groups the last 60 years tirelessly
[02:36:45.380 --> 02:36:48.060]  exposed what was being set up.
[02:36:48.060 --> 02:36:51.700]  Liberty Goldwater said the trilateral commission was set up to overtake the government with
[02:36:51.700 --> 02:36:53.620]  corporate interest and overthrow our republic.
[02:36:53.620 --> 02:36:55.460]  That's now happening.
[02:36:55.460 --> 02:36:59.860]  And so now they've gone from being able to deny it even existed.
[02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:06.260]  I remember hearing Rush Limbaugh in the 80s, late 80s, or maybe 1990 or so, when he first
[02:37:06.260 --> 02:37:11.540]  got on air, when I heard him in Austin say, there's no such thing as the CFR, then later
[02:37:11.540 --> 02:37:13.700]  he said, oh, the CFR runs nothing.
[02:37:13.700 --> 02:37:16.500]  And that's because if you talk about it, you'd have your show removed.
[02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:21.860]  I was offered big national syndication deals, but I was told no Federal Reserve, no CFR,
[02:37:21.860 --> 02:37:24.540]  no black helicopters, no New World Order.
[02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:27.340]  Okay, so this is how this works.
[02:37:27.340 --> 02:37:29.300]  Mankal Muller, same deal.
[02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:30.300]  He said that on air.
[02:37:30.300 --> 02:37:32.940]  I mean, they literally tell you this.
[02:37:32.940 --> 02:37:35.260]  So now it's admitted it exists.
[02:37:35.260 --> 02:37:37.620]  They admit world governments being set up.
[02:37:37.620 --> 02:37:40.820]  There's no more denial about it.
[02:37:40.820 --> 02:37:43.820]  But still sometimes they actually go back to the old propaganda and say it doesn't exist.
[02:37:43.820 --> 02:37:48.500]  But the point is, we forced them to admit they exist and that they're the authors of
[02:37:48.500 --> 02:37:49.500]  what's happening.
[02:37:49.500 --> 02:37:51.540]  See, they don't want you to know they exist.
[02:37:51.540 --> 02:37:55.100]  So as things get bad, you know that they did it because they're going to pose as the
[02:37:55.100 --> 02:37:56.100]  saviors.
[02:37:56.100 --> 02:37:57.260]  We expose who's behind it.
[02:37:57.260 --> 02:37:58.820]  We expose who they are.
[02:37:58.820 --> 02:38:00.340]  We expose their agenda.
[02:38:00.340 --> 02:38:02.380]  We expose the plan they're setting up.
[02:38:02.380 --> 02:38:06.540]  Then they're never going to get away with it because as the fruits of their tyranny
[02:38:06.540 --> 02:38:08.660]  come in, they're going to get the blame.
[02:38:08.660 --> 02:38:10.340]  So exposure, it comes first.
[02:38:10.340 --> 02:38:13.660]  I'm going to give you the floor for the next 12 minutes of this segment and then six minutes
[02:38:13.660 --> 02:38:16.660]  of this segment after that, editor of New American Magazine.
[02:38:16.660 --> 02:38:22.940]  But I wanted to just quote from history how key this exposure is that you and others have
[02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:30.100]  been part of and that thanks to our forebearers that did this, we now have a fighting chance
[02:38:30.100 --> 02:38:33.540]  to expose what they've been doing behind the curtain.
[02:38:33.540 --> 02:38:34.540]  William F. Jasper.
[02:38:34.540 --> 02:38:41.660]  Well, Alex, there is so much to cover and I jumped on the Federal Reserve just because
[02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:50.620]  less than 24 hours ago, that major, major keystone of this whole conspiracy was really
[02:38:50.620 --> 02:38:54.220]  put in the headlights for a moment.
[02:38:54.220 --> 02:39:02.340]  And we need to keep the spotlight on that because this is one of the eyes of the octopus
[02:39:02.340 --> 02:39:04.700]  rather than the tentacles.
[02:39:04.700 --> 02:39:09.740]  And as you pointed out, Jekyll Island, this was 100 years ago when we had the meeting,
[02:39:09.740 --> 02:39:11.940]  this secret meeting at Jekyll Island.
[02:39:11.940 --> 02:39:18.940]  Now, if you go to Jekyll Island today and you can take the tour, they will actually,
[02:39:18.940 --> 02:39:24.420]  the tour guide will explain that, yes, all these Wall Street representatives of J.P.
[02:39:24.420 --> 02:39:29.540]  Morgan and Rod Schreil and one of them met here in secret.
[02:39:29.540 --> 02:39:30.780]  They all had assumed names.
[02:39:30.780 --> 02:39:32.620]  They came on secret trains.
[02:39:32.620 --> 02:39:38.140]  They didn't acknowledge each other because this was all a secret operation to bring this
[02:39:38.140 --> 02:39:41.980]  Federal Reserve into existence.
[02:39:41.980 --> 02:39:48.500]  They admit that at the famous site at the hotel where this took place.
[02:39:48.500 --> 02:39:52.500]  And the Federal Reserve historians themselves now admit that.
[02:39:52.500 --> 02:39:58.500]  They say, well, this was necessary for the greater good in order to create this institution,
[02:39:58.500 --> 02:40:02.060]  which was going to protect us from booms and bus cycles, etc.
[02:40:02.060 --> 02:40:06.300]  And of course, now we have 100-year history to judge it on.
[02:40:06.300 --> 02:40:12.660]  And this past decade, this past five years to judge it on, where we've seen the greatest
[02:40:12.660 --> 02:40:17.340]  transfer of wealth, shouldn't just call it transfer, we should call it robbery for what
[02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:18.840]  it is.
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:25.180]  You know, when General Inspector of the Federal Reserve, Elizabeth Coleman, I believe her
[02:40:25.180 --> 02:40:31.700]  name is, testified in 2009, you may recall, you probably, I'm sure, have run that testimony,
[02:40:31.700 --> 02:40:33.180]  that YouTube testimony.
[02:40:33.180 --> 02:40:40.260]  She was asked by Congressman, well, according to Bloomberg out there, there's as many as
[02:40:40.260 --> 02:40:48.180]  not as much as $9 trillion in loans off the books by the Federal Reserve.
[02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:49.180]  Where did that money go?
[02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:53.100]  And she says, well, we don't know about that.
[02:40:53.100 --> 02:40:54.100]  Question after question.
[02:40:54.100 --> 02:40:57.740]  Well, we are conducting a high-level review.
[02:40:57.740 --> 02:41:03.940]  It was complete blah, blah, yada, yada to the United States Congress, which is supposed
[02:41:03.940 --> 02:41:05.940]  to be supervising this.
[02:41:05.940 --> 02:41:12.140]  Congress created the Federal Reserve and basically gave them, now, we've been pointing out for
[02:41:12.140 --> 02:41:13.140]  years.
[02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:16.300]  This is a very important point.
[02:41:16.300 --> 02:41:22.860]  This institution is very much a communist Marxist-style institution.
[02:41:22.860 --> 02:41:27.740]  Here's the plank number four of the communist manifesto, creating a central bank in the
[02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:33.260]  hands of the government, which will control the currency and credit.
[02:41:33.260 --> 02:41:34.260]  That's a communist feature.
[02:41:34.260 --> 02:41:36.100]  It's not a capitalist feature.
[02:41:36.100 --> 02:41:42.420]  True capitalism, if Wall Street people really are true capitalism, they believe in a free
[02:41:42.420 --> 02:41:49.500]  enterprise and people freely assuming, letting the market decide what the interest rates
[02:41:49.500 --> 02:41:55.220]  will be, how much capital will be available for loans, not having the government come
[02:41:55.220 --> 02:41:56.740]  in and dictate that.
[02:41:56.740 --> 02:42:01.780]  That command economy is thoroughly totalitarian, communistic.
[02:42:01.780 --> 02:42:05.740]  And so this is where we get into this whole issue of convergence.
[02:42:05.740 --> 02:42:13.180]  What we see is that for the past century, since the Federal Reserve was established,
[02:42:13.180 --> 02:42:18.980]  the insiders, the big Wall Street bankers, have been working hand-in-hand with communists
[02:42:18.980 --> 02:42:26.340]  and socialist movements throughout the world to centralize, cartelize, concentrate power.
[02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:30.700]  That's the main feature that you see in every totalitarian government, the concentration
[02:42:30.700 --> 02:42:35.380]  and centralization of power, breaking down of any checks and balances.
[02:42:35.380 --> 02:42:40.100]  And that's what has been happening here in this country, a very sophisticated campaign
[02:42:40.100 --> 02:42:46.540]  going on decade after decade supervised by people in the various banking establishments
[02:42:46.540 --> 02:42:51.980]  and particularly in through organizations such as the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:42:51.980 --> 02:42:57.220]  Now it's expanded a whole plethora of various other groups from the Brookings Institution,
[02:42:57.220 --> 02:43:04.380]  the Aspen Institution and various other groups, trilateral commission, to coordinate these
[02:43:04.380 --> 02:43:05.380]  activities.
[02:43:05.380 --> 02:43:11.460]  But you'll see in the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, the Department of State,
[02:43:11.460 --> 02:43:15.580]  Department of War, which became the Department of Defense, and all of the other major cabinet
[02:43:15.580 --> 02:43:23.820]  positions, you have Council on Foreign Relations certified globalist folks running it through
[02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:26.660]  Republican and Democratic administrations.
[02:43:26.660 --> 02:43:34.260]  And so I just published an article on the New American just shortly before I came on
[02:43:34.260 --> 02:43:39.620]  the program here about the Yellen vote yesterday, Janet Yellen, member of the Council on Foreign
[02:43:39.620 --> 02:43:44.500]  Relations, made chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
[02:43:44.500 --> 02:43:49.940]  Now the next person up for a vote, he hasn't been officially put forward yet, but all the
[02:43:49.940 --> 02:43:55.620]  establishment is saying he's going to be the vice chairman, is Stanley Fisher, member
[02:43:55.620 --> 02:43:57.940]  of the Council on Foreign Relations for a long time.
[02:43:57.940 --> 02:44:05.700]  In fact, now he just stepped down as chairman of the Bank of Israel to come back to the
[02:44:05.700 --> 02:44:11.380]  United States in September and was made a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:44:11.380 --> 02:44:15.980]  And that was one of the first clues that he was going to be the next one.
[02:44:15.980 --> 02:44:22.620]  And then Obama hired the new top economist last year, who was the Marxist head economist
[02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:23.700]  over in France.
[02:44:23.700 --> 02:44:28.660]  This is globalism, where people from Israel, France, you name it, are here openly running
[02:44:28.660 --> 02:44:29.660]  our country.
[02:44:29.660 --> 02:44:34.940]  Obama became the head of the UN Security Council a few years ago, about violating Article 1,
[02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:35.940]  Section 9.
[02:44:35.940 --> 02:44:39.900]  It's the flaunting, and that's why I got you here today, and I know I digressed and other
[02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:40.900]  things as well.
[02:44:40.900 --> 02:44:44.980]  I want to talk about convergence, because we were talking about all these secret treaties
[02:44:44.980 --> 02:44:49.900]  being ratified right now, but we need to talk about convergence, how they then bring all
[02:44:49.900 --> 02:44:54.260]  this together, because that's so central, but it's also important to understand.
[02:44:54.260 --> 02:45:00.100]  In the 10 planks, they have an income tax and a private central bank to control the
[02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:04.580]  winners and losers, and people go, why are the ultra rich for communism?
[02:45:04.580 --> 02:45:10.580]  They make us communists and have no rights as slaves, and oh, communalize our wealth,
[02:45:10.580 --> 02:45:17.780]  but then meanwhile, they're always exempt offshore, literally making us colonies.
[02:45:17.780 --> 02:45:24.300]  So globalists create communist structures as their plantation colonies to then extract
[02:45:24.300 --> 02:45:25.300]  the wealth.
[02:45:25.300 --> 02:45:32.460]  But again, number five, central banks, centralized credit, and then they also have a income tax,
[02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:33.460]  public school.
[02:45:33.460 --> 02:45:39.300]  I mean, we are, for all intents and purposes, a communist, quasi-fascist state, but let's
[02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:40.780]  get into convergence.
[02:45:40.780 --> 02:45:47.780]  Well, in order to discuss that, because we could end up ranging far afield, and I might
[02:45:47.780 --> 02:45:53.460]  neglect it, I have to bring up, because I'm sure you've brought it up many times, but
[02:45:53.460 --> 02:46:00.940]  in order to really understand convergence, which means the melding together of the so-called
[02:46:00.940 --> 02:46:10.380]  capitalist west with the communist east and the socialist middle ground of Europe.
[02:46:10.380 --> 02:46:18.940]  And this has been underway for a long time, and one of the first big revelations on this
[02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:22.220]  came out, and you can find it on the internet.
[02:46:22.220 --> 02:46:26.100]  I'm sure you have it on your website, and we have it on our website.
[02:46:26.100 --> 02:46:36.340]  Norman Dodd was an investigator for the Congressional Committee investigation of the tax-exempt foundations.
[02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:44.700]  The Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation, and other major foundations, Carnegie Corporation,
[02:46:44.700 --> 02:46:49.820]  had been, now these are foundations, tax-exempt foundations, set up by the richest families
[02:46:49.820 --> 02:46:51.060]  in America.
[02:46:51.060 --> 02:47:01.380]  And a very curious thing was happening, these high-level, ultra-rich foundations, which were
[02:47:01.380 --> 02:47:08.420]  run by Council on Foreign Relations members, were constantly funding socialist, communist,
[02:47:08.420 --> 02:47:15.500]  Marxist, and subversive programs, and this pattern became so obvious that people were
[02:47:15.500 --> 02:47:19.220]  objecting to this and saying, how come these guys have tax exemption and they're funding
[02:47:19.220 --> 02:47:25.300]  all of these political programs, particularly ones that are subversive and they're anti-Americans.
[02:47:25.300 --> 02:47:31.060]  So Congress held a number of investigations, but during the recent investigations, Norman
[02:47:31.060 --> 02:47:37.740]  Dodd was their chief investigator, and he and his investigators went to all the different
[02:47:37.740 --> 02:47:38.740]  foundations.
[02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:42.260]  But in one of his visits with the president of the Ford Foundation, Council on Foreign
[02:47:42.260 --> 02:47:46.980]  Relations member Rowan Gaither, he had this astounding revelation.
[02:47:46.980 --> 02:47:52.820]  This is one of those things, like when Goldfinger tells James Bond, he comes out and just has
[02:47:52.820 --> 02:47:56.780]  to gloat and tells him what his plans are.
[02:47:56.780 --> 02:47:58.060]  We see it in the movies all the time.
[02:47:58.060 --> 02:47:59.420]  Well, this does happen in real life.
[02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:02.340]  It's happened to me on a couple of occasions.
[02:48:02.340 --> 02:48:09.180]  But in this particular case, Norman Dodd was told by Rowan Gaither, would you like to
[02:48:09.180 --> 02:48:14.940]  know what kind of instructions were operating under here?
[02:48:14.940 --> 02:48:20.700]  And he said, well, yes, he says, we are operating under instructions to use our grant making
[02:48:20.700 --> 02:48:25.900]  powers so to alter life in the United States that we can be comfortably merged with the
[02:48:25.900 --> 02:48:27.700]  Soviet Union.
[02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:31.140]  Well, Mr. Gaither was astounded.
[02:48:31.140 --> 02:48:36.420]  I mean, Mr. Dodd was astounded because he knew that's exactly what it looked like they
[02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:40.300]  were doing, but he never thought he'd get an admission like that.
[02:48:40.300 --> 02:48:45.140]  And so he said, well, will you say that publicly to our committee?
[02:48:45.140 --> 02:48:48.300]  And he says, we would never dream of doing that.
[02:48:48.300 --> 02:48:58.780]  So this was just a gloat off the record, but it is confirmed by the actual facts.
[02:48:58.780 --> 02:49:03.180]  This is what these foundations have been doing for decades.
[02:49:03.180 --> 02:49:10.140]  And by the way, I've had globalists as a so-called talk show host, I could say whatever I want
[02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:14.380]  and give my punditry, but as a journalist, I have to, when somebody says this is off
[02:49:14.380 --> 02:49:19.420]  record, unless it's openly illegal, I have to keep that confidence, or they know that
[02:49:19.420 --> 02:49:21.940]  I then lose all my sources.
[02:49:21.940 --> 02:49:26.860]  But I've had globalist executives, you name it, many times reach out and say, man, just
[02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:27.860]  join us.
[02:49:27.860 --> 02:49:28.860]  The public's a bunch of scum.
[02:49:28.860 --> 02:49:30.580]  And I know you've been to all these UN meetings.
[02:49:30.580 --> 02:49:34.020]  I'm guessing that's where this happened to you, but they really try to recruit people
[02:49:34.020 --> 02:49:35.260]  that resist them.
[02:49:35.260 --> 02:49:43.060]  Well, and I know several people who were actual disciples of mine that I trained who have
[02:49:43.060 --> 02:49:45.780]  joined them have become members of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:49:45.780 --> 02:49:51.100]  They went to the mountaintop and saw the kingdoms of the world and decided to join up with them.
[02:49:51.100 --> 02:49:54.900]  So that happened actually to Alan Greenspan.
[02:49:54.900 --> 02:49:55.900]  He knew Ron Paul.
[02:49:55.900 --> 02:50:00.420]  He wrote articles about the New World Order, the Federal Reserve, and they bought him off.
[02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:01.420]  Absolutely.
[02:50:01.420 --> 02:50:10.220]  And so what we've seen for the last more than 50 years is an acceleration of this.
[02:50:10.220 --> 02:50:20.460]  And it wasn't quite so apparent during the so-called Cold War because most of the Republican
[02:50:20.460 --> 02:50:28.100]  and Democrat operatives who were globalists maintained an anti-communist rhetoric.
[02:50:28.100 --> 02:50:32.940]  They kept warning that we have to build up all this defense against the Soviet Union and
[02:50:32.940 --> 02:50:33.940]  against China.
[02:50:33.940 --> 02:50:38.700]  Meanwhile, they were shoveling billions of dollars, tens of billions of dollars, hundreds
[02:50:38.700 --> 02:50:43.740]  of billions of dollars to Russia, to China in foreign aid.
[02:50:43.740 --> 02:50:50.220]  Not just the money, but the technology and everything which made them into world powers.
[02:50:50.220 --> 02:50:57.100]  But then with the so-called collapse of communism, that all changed.
[02:50:57.100 --> 02:51:05.300]  Now we can be merging, and we are seeing merging on the economic, on the financial operatives,
[02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:09.700]  politically, socially, trade-wise, all over the world.
[02:51:09.700 --> 02:51:15.460]  And this is happening, and this is where I said I had to bring up something.
[02:51:15.460 --> 02:51:19.580]  I'm sure you've mentioned on here, Anatoly Golitsyn.
[02:51:19.580 --> 02:51:20.580]  My apologies.
[02:51:20.580 --> 02:51:23.780]  My book of his is jam-packed full of...
[02:51:23.780 --> 02:51:26.180]  Tell us folks about Anatoly Golitsyn.
[02:51:26.180 --> 02:51:32.500]  Anatoly Golitsyn, this is his book which came out in 1984, New Lies for Old.
[02:51:32.500 --> 02:51:38.540]  Anatoly Golitsyn was a Soviet KGB defector, and if you want to understand convergence,
[02:51:38.540 --> 02:51:41.500]  you really have to read Anatoly Golitsyn.
[02:51:41.500 --> 02:51:45.180]  He was not just your standard KGB agent.
[02:51:45.180 --> 02:51:53.540]  He worked for the inner KGB, the super-secret part of the KGB that devised, developed, and
[02:51:53.540 --> 02:51:58.380]  implemented the long-range grand strategy of the Kremlin.
[02:51:58.380 --> 02:52:05.540]  And it's primarily using disinformation and agents of influence to help work together
[02:52:05.540 --> 02:52:11.620]  with globalists in our government to bring about convergence, to create the impression
[02:52:11.620 --> 02:52:18.180]  that communism had died, had fallen away, had collapsed, and that now we had an opportunity
[02:52:18.180 --> 02:52:24.820]  for the first time in the world to build up Russia, China, and the other communist countries
[02:52:24.820 --> 02:52:35.060]  into, get rid of the hostility and the potential for war, and bring about a peaceful coexistence
[02:52:35.060 --> 02:52:39.820]  and help them become more free enterprise capitalists.
[02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:41.380]  But that isn't what has been happening.
[02:52:41.380 --> 02:52:43.300]  We have been moving in their direction.
[02:52:43.300 --> 02:52:49.180]  We have been becoming more socialist, more government-controlled, more centralized, more
[02:52:49.180 --> 02:52:51.460]  command-and-control economy.
[02:52:51.460 --> 02:52:55.340]  And they've acted like they were reforming, but now they've reversed back, and it's the
[02:52:55.340 --> 02:52:56.940]  very same globalist above it all.
[02:52:56.940 --> 02:53:02.380]  And just like the elite-funded radical communist groups and socialist groups since the time
[02:53:02.380 --> 02:53:08.220]  of Karl Marx, they're now claiming they're fighting al-Qaeda, but meanwhile funding them
[02:53:08.220 --> 02:53:12.540]  and using that as the threat to take our liberties domestically.
[02:53:12.540 --> 02:53:20.980]  So this is accelerating right now, and unfortunately, most Americans have no idea what is going
[02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:21.980]  on here.
[02:53:21.980 --> 02:53:24.620]  I mentioned his book New Lies for All.
[02:53:24.620 --> 02:53:25.620]  It's still available.
[02:53:25.620 --> 02:53:27.260]  We have it online.
[02:53:27.260 --> 02:53:29.820]  Again, my apologies.
[02:53:29.820 --> 02:53:33.780]  This is his most recent book, The Perestroika Deception.
[02:53:33.780 --> 02:53:37.820]  For radio listeners, it looks like it's been shot with a shotgun or so many notes in it.
[02:53:37.820 --> 02:53:39.380]  It's dog-eared books.
[02:53:39.380 --> 02:53:49.940]  But, I mean, he has been in the forefront of exposing what has been happening, particularly
[02:53:49.940 --> 02:53:57.100]  in detail, showing that all of the so-called reforms, going back 50 years and showing the
[02:53:57.100 --> 02:54:02.540]  various phony splits in communism and the split between Russia and China, how all of
[02:54:02.540 --> 02:54:11.540]  those were very elaborate, staged events, and how he primarily shows the staging from
[02:54:11.540 --> 02:54:13.980]  the Soviet side.
[02:54:13.980 --> 02:54:19.140]  What he doesn't show, and what we have been in the forefront of showing, is how this cooperation
[02:54:19.140 --> 02:54:27.020]  has taken place from the leaders and the globalists on our side in Europe and the United States
[02:54:27.020 --> 02:54:31.620]  to make this convergence possible.
[02:54:31.620 --> 02:54:35.540]  And that is where we are headed.
[02:54:35.540 --> 02:54:41.340]  All of the various communist countries of Eastern Europe, who supposedly have now-
[02:54:41.340 --> 02:54:42.340]  Sure, well, they admit.
[02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:47.020]  I mean, you can admit, they've taken all the old Soviets and made them the new EU bureaucracy
[02:54:47.020 --> 02:54:49.300]  that's unelected and above the law.
[02:54:49.300 --> 02:54:52.060]  You can be in the EU parliament, but you have no voting power.
[02:54:52.060 --> 02:54:58.380]  They admit it's a new Soviet, and even the new flag they came out with for Europe has
[02:54:58.380 --> 02:55:01.860]  all these symbols in it, and the hammer and sickle is in there.
[02:55:01.860 --> 02:55:02.860]  This is what they're doing.
[02:55:02.860 --> 02:55:10.300]  Well, I just had a new article that we posted yesterday that I wrote that I'm sure very
[02:55:10.300 --> 02:55:15.140]  little of the western media, particularly here in the United States, covered it.
[02:55:15.140 --> 02:55:21.220]  And the title is, it's up on our website now at thenewamerican.com, Killers on the Loose.
[02:55:21.220 --> 02:55:26.100]  Croatia arrests communist spy chief in 1983 murder case.
[02:55:26.100 --> 02:55:32.940]  Now, Croatia is one of the new republics, supposedly a sovereign nation, which came
[02:55:32.940 --> 02:55:35.620]  out of communist Yugoslavia.
[02:55:35.620 --> 02:55:42.500]  There were eight republics within communist Yugoslavia, which was cobbled together during
[02:55:42.500 --> 02:55:50.820]  World War II, after World War II, and Marshall Joseph Brods, Tito, was put in charge there.
[02:55:50.820 --> 02:56:00.220]  And this was one of the first phony splits in communism that Golitsyn very capably details
[02:56:00.220 --> 02:56:02.940]  for us in his books.
[02:56:02.940 --> 02:56:08.220]  Tito was arranged to be the independent communist.
[02:56:08.220 --> 02:56:11.820]  And our foreign policy establishment, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Eisenhower
[02:56:11.820 --> 02:56:17.660]  administration, and the Roosevelt administration, and in successive republican and democratic
[02:56:17.660 --> 02:56:22.820]  administrations, praised Tito as this great ally of the west.
[02:56:22.820 --> 02:56:27.980]  Sure, they always create artificial choices, fake selections.
[02:56:27.980 --> 02:56:29.860]  It's the oldest trick in the book.
[02:56:29.860 --> 02:56:33.940]  But he was a communist thug, a totalitarian mass murderer.
[02:56:33.940 --> 02:56:38.940]  And one of his murderers was Joseph Perkovich.
[02:56:38.940 --> 02:56:40.820]  And Perkovich is still alive.
[02:56:40.820 --> 02:56:50.900]  He was just arrested on January 1st, finally, on a European arrest warrant from Germany,
[02:56:50.900 --> 02:57:00.580]  in a case in which he had been in charge, the mastermind of an assassination of a Croatian
[02:57:00.580 --> 02:57:04.900]  nationalist who had fled Croatia, fled Yugoslavia.
[02:57:04.900 --> 02:57:05.900]  It's incredible.
[02:57:05.900 --> 02:57:09.900]  It shows how our government was backing people that were killing libertarian nationalist
[02:57:09.900 --> 02:57:11.660]  patriot type people.
[02:57:11.660 --> 02:57:12.660]  It's just incredible.
[02:57:12.660 --> 02:57:18.740]  William F. Jasper, I'm going to get you back on in a month or so for part two of Convergence.
[02:57:18.740 --> 02:57:19.820]  Amazing.

[02:59:51.420 --> 02:59:54.420]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.420 --> 03:00:23.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:24.420 --> 03:00:36.420]  This just broke at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[03:00:36.420 --> 03:00:42.420]  Former head of DARPA wants you to swallow ID microchips.
[03:00:42.420 --> 03:00:49.420]  About two years ago we carried several news articles where these companies were coming out with ID chips by law.
[03:00:49.420 --> 03:00:54.420]  It's what they're lobbying for to be in all the pills because especially if it's an narcotic,
[03:00:54.420 --> 03:00:58.420]  we've got to track that you're carrying it, what you're doing, the new G4,
[03:00:58.420 --> 03:01:01.420]  enabled cars, have to give you tickets.
[03:01:01.420 --> 03:01:05.420]  RFID is to surveil the living daylights out of you or the cops will claim,
[03:01:05.420 --> 03:01:09.420]  I had a scan that you were carrying, you know, a bunch of Percocet or whatever.
[03:01:09.420 --> 03:01:13.420]  I love how they push all this stuff on people and then use it to put you in jail.
[03:01:13.420 --> 03:01:19.420]  Google executive also pushes e-tattoo that reads your mind.
[03:01:19.420 --> 03:01:24.420]  This is the bizarro info from the globalist.
[03:01:24.420 --> 03:01:30.420]  I mean, it's like the power of the gods, the fire of the gods being given to psychopaths.
[03:01:30.420 --> 03:01:39.420]  All this stuff that could totally empower humanity is being given the worst, most oppressive systems out of the gates.
[03:01:39.420 --> 03:01:43.420]  So that story is up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[03:01:43.420 --> 03:01:45.420]  There's more articles out today.
[03:01:45.420 --> 03:01:54.420]  One in AP, about $2 billion fine that JPMorgan Chase is going to pay for trillions of scams.
[03:01:54.420 --> 03:01:59.420]  So can I go rob a bank of a million dollars and pay the cops a tip of, you know, a thousand?
[03:01:59.420 --> 03:02:02.420]  I mean, it's just, that's how the justice system works.
[03:02:02.420 --> 03:02:06.420]  They've announced the FBI is going to do nothing basically in white-collar crime.
[03:02:06.420 --> 03:02:10.420]  They're only going to target people politically for made-up stuff.
[03:02:10.420 --> 03:02:14.420]  So, I mean, you call the FBI millions could be getting stolen.
[03:02:14.420 --> 03:02:16.420]  They won't help you. Nothing's going to help you anymore.
[03:02:16.420 --> 03:02:22.420]  It's just, you better use your wits and you better stand up to people and soon you're going to have to get justice yourself.
[03:02:22.420 --> 03:02:24.420]  But that's the greatest crime in England.
[03:02:24.420 --> 03:02:27.420]  If you fight back against an attacker, you're going to prison.
[03:02:27.420 --> 03:02:32.420]  Because, and that's the same thing here with the social engineers, never fight back against a bully.
[03:02:32.420 --> 03:02:38.420]  Never stand up. Being a man, being honorable, stands against the criminals.
[03:02:38.420 --> 03:02:42.420]  But how is our nation, how is the elite itself?
[03:02:42.420 --> 03:02:48.420]  You know, it's come out that Google, Microsoft, all the big globalist groups, cybersecurity, tried to take them over last year.
[03:02:48.420 --> 03:02:50.420]  That's in Wired Magazine.
[03:02:50.420 --> 03:02:52.420]  Because they were always part of the same group.
[03:02:52.420 --> 03:02:57.420]  But once you create a centralized system, it's not about production anymore.
[03:02:57.420 --> 03:03:03.420]  It's about controlling that centralized system and then you control it all.
[03:03:03.420 --> 03:03:10.420]  And it creates a very, very nightmare type scenario.
[03:03:10.420 --> 03:03:13.420]  It is totally unfulfilling.
[03:03:13.420 --> 03:03:17.420]  I mean, here's an example. Everybody knows you spoil your kids, give them everything they want.
[03:03:17.420 --> 03:03:19.420]  Let them boss you around. They'll turn into monsters.
[03:03:19.420 --> 03:03:23.420]  You make them work hard. You make them do their chores. You discipline them.
[03:03:23.420 --> 03:03:26.420]  You make them exercise their good children.
[03:03:26.420 --> 03:03:33.420]  And I myself, I got good kids, but they're somewhat spoiled and I've learned to crack down on them and they're happier, better people.
[03:03:33.420 --> 03:03:36.420]  And the government is just completely spoiled out of control.
[03:03:36.420 --> 03:03:39.420]  These corporations are completely spoiled out of control.
[03:03:39.420 --> 03:03:46.420]  And they're mentally ill believing we poison the water and we geo-engineer because we're God and all of our resources down here on the ground
[03:03:46.420 --> 03:03:53.420]  builds the cogs to run this alternate breakaway civilization and government
[03:03:53.420 --> 03:04:01.420]  where these people can do whatever they want and play God and enjoy the fruits of human intellect and human development.
[03:04:01.420 --> 03:04:05.420]  These globalists all have horrible families. They're totally unhappy on average.
[03:04:05.420 --> 03:04:07.420]  They have high suicide rates.
[03:04:07.420 --> 03:04:13.420]  If you're a globalist, new world order minion, you're unhappy because you're not following the true human code
[03:04:13.420 --> 03:04:20.420]  of fulfilling our destiny, of being honorable, of being good, of trying to build a better world.
[03:04:20.420 --> 03:04:30.420]  And you've used your intelligence to engage in fraud and engage in deceit and you're creating a political vortex, a political black hole
[03:04:30.420 --> 03:04:36.420]  that we know have destroyed civilizations, empires and billions of people in the last 6000 years.
[03:04:36.420 --> 03:04:39.420]  Government's killed 200 plus million last century alone.
[03:04:39.420 --> 03:04:44.420]  I'm rounding down from 262 million non-military deaths.
[03:04:44.420 --> 03:04:54.420]  And now with all the super technology, super science, it's literally science fiction, Hanna-Barbera type stuff,
[03:04:54.420 --> 03:05:18.420]  we'll be lucky if we don't destroy ourselves in the near future.
