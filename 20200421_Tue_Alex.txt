[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  Another world. Another time. In the age of wonder. Another world. Another time. His life was green and good. Until the truth cracked.
[00:27.000 --> 00:40.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[00:40.000 --> 01:01.000]  Well, Facebook admits to coordinating with state governments to shut down anti-lockdown protest and to shut down 5G protest and to shut down forced inoculation protest.
[01:01.000 --> 01:16.000]  Now, the very definition of fascism, the government coordinating with corporations to silence and suppress the people, but it's okay because Mark Zuckerberg is liberal.
[01:16.000 --> 01:31.000]  It helps work with authoritarian states to shut down their people, just like all the rest of big tech, that are the real enemies of America and humanity today, like the virus, an invisible spying, controlling, manipulating enemy.
[01:31.000 --> 01:45.000]  Of course, the view is out there at the same time saying anybody protesting, anybody out there, while you're terrorist, you're all suspect. The UN's come out and said that you'll never go back to the way it was.
[01:45.000 --> 02:00.000]  It's a new way of living directed by the World Health Organization. Who? Who runs it? An elected group called The Who. Isn't that interesting? Here's Joy Bayard.
[02:00.000 --> 02:11.000]  These people are being egged on by right-wing media and people like Alex Jones and Rush Limbaugh. And why are you bringing guns to a rally? You want to call yourself protesters? Leave your guns home.
[02:11.000 --> 02:18.000]  Those are terrorists who bring guns to things, to rallies. I don't trust that at all. And don't listen to these people.
[02:18.000 --> 02:33.000]  Yes, sorry. Go ahead. What did Thomas Jefferson say? Then it was paraphrased in FIFA Vendetta. When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[02:33.000 --> 02:53.000]  We have corporate, globalist government and blue city government and blue state government allied with the World Health Organization, unelected authoritarians, directed by the Chai comms, openly taking action against free humanity right now.
[02:53.000 --> 03:12.000]  And same. Oh, it's not just Alex Jones that censored. No. No. It's people that want to exercise their first amendment in the streets. And Zuckerberg has said those that demonstrate will be deleted off Facebook.
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  All the money, time you spent promoting it, all the connections you made, all the spying they did on you, all the illegal selling of your data.
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.000]  They're going to keep all that, but not even let you communicate with people. And now they're seizing control of regular telecommunications.
[03:24.000 --> 03:33.000]  And they're announcing people that call friends and family and talk bad about the New World Order. AI is now listening to your phone calls. This is in the news.
[03:33.000 --> 03:47.000]  And they're going to suspend your phone service. They're already in the apps. I told you a year ago, soon they'll be in the apps of the text messages saying, oh, we're not going to let you send things like corona came out of a cell.
[03:47.000 --> 03:56.000]  Came out of a Chinese lab. That is verboten. Forbidden. Doesn't matter if the Nobel Prize winner that discovered HIV says it.
[03:56.000 --> 04:05.000]  Does it matter if the major Indian Institute say it doesn't matter if it's a fact. Doesn't matter if it comes out in documents.
[04:05.000 --> 04:19.000]  Zuckerberg. Sugar Mountain says, you keep your damn mouth shut. The Harvard mafia runs your life.
[04:19.000 --> 04:26.000]  Of course, he tried to take thousands of acres of tribal ceremonial land, the best part of Kali. And the natives told him to go to hell. He was unable to steal it.
[04:26.000 --> 04:36.000]  So if we just act like the natives and have a little fight in us politically and say no, he'll roll over like a big fat dead fish in the ocean.
[04:36.000 --> 04:46.000]  Metaphysically, politically and blowed out, wrought out and sink. You think that little bug-eyed demon can defeat us?
[04:46.000 --> 04:57.000]  Not if we're aware of this evil. Who does he work for? That's right. He works for Bill Gates on record. He's another globalist, deep state frontman carrying out eugenics against you and your family.
[05:16.000 --> 05:25.000]  It's got everything. Vitamin D, a big dose of that, a big dose of zinc, a big dose of selenium, copper, chromium, and a bunch of other stuff.
[05:25.000 --> 05:37.000]  This is the perfect formula for what's going on right now. And it's about to sell out at infowarstore.com. And I want you to have it so that after all this craziness passes, it becomes a normal regimen in your life.
[05:37.000 --> 05:52.000]  Because this is something, in my view, you need every day. Get it right now. Prostaguard at infowarstore.com. And whatever you do, please warn others that Mother Nature has given us a lot of things that really help boost our overall health and wellness.
[06:07.000 --> 06:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the infowar.
[06:38.000 --> 06:52.000]  Eugenics, Club of Rome, Georgia Guidestones, Bilderberg Group, but now suddenly the door closes and click. We're locked in the room with him and he is in command.
[06:52.000 --> 06:56.000]  And I'll lay that out next segment how he is in command.
[06:56.000 --> 07:06.000]  But before David, I can review us on newswar.com, infowar.com, and band.video. David iCommergency Broadcast.
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  Humanity at the crossroads. We the people.
[07:11.000 --> 07:21.000]  Now, I came into the office a few hours ago, and I was talking to Rob Do.
[07:21.000 --> 07:34.000]  He's putting a piece together, one of my compadres. And he said, man, look at this. This is from that show V five years ago, the reboot about an alien invasion they pose like they're humans.
[07:34.000 --> 07:42.000]  And in a vaccine, they put a digital ink in you that tracks your location.
[07:42.000 --> 07:49.000]  Bill Gates patented that three months ago with patent number 2020.
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  060606.
[07:52.000 --> 08:10.000]  And then it ties to another patent with 666 at the end of it and it's just why do gangs low level, white supremacist gangs, Hispanic gangs, black gangs, why do they tag things with their symbols MS 13, you name it.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  Well, that's because they're tagging them.
[08:12.000 --> 08:21.000]  Gangs always leave a card. Why would special operations would kill and assassinate people they knew were Viet Cong or thought were in Vietnam.
[08:21.000 --> 08:27.000]  Why would they leave the ace of spades in their mouth?
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  Well, as a calling car.
[08:30.000 --> 08:37.000]  And so, not just on this patent on a bunch of them, it's 666.
[08:37.000 --> 08:47.000]  And then it's a world government with a digital liquid chip in you so you can't get it out of your body.
[08:47.000 --> 08:56.000]  And you've got to have it to buy and sell but the first level is oh you got to have it to prove you're safe from COVID-19 you have the antibodies.
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  You've had the inoculation.
[09:01.000 --> 09:09.000]  And then oh, by the way, it's a perfect system to buy and sell now and oh, when you use it, we're giving you free cryptocurrency.
[09:09.000 --> 09:22.000]  Bill Gates has announced it in the white papers and the reports in the prospectus to shareholders that oh, by the way, how do they get kids to go play these video games where you have to buy gold or buy silver to fight in the game.
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  It's online.
[09:24.000 --> 09:25.000]  You go play.
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  You've got to buy weapons to fight.
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  You've got to buy.
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  We had to put money in to get that.
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  Well now, how do they sell it to kids?
[09:33.000 --> 09:48.000]  They go oh, sign up to play Goblin Killer or Dragon Slayer or whatever these games are called online and you pay for the weapons in the virtual reality.
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  But they'll give you, they'll say, 100 gold coins to sign up now for free.
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.000]  But they know once you use the 100 gold coins, you're going to put the credit card in or swipe your chip.
[09:59.000 --> 10:06.000]  It's like crack dealers or heroin dealers famously, you know, in the 50s or 60s would go to elementary schools.
[10:06.000 --> 10:10.000]  They would go to middle schools and they'd say here's some pills.
[10:10.000 --> 10:11.000]  They'd get you addicted.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  They'd say now go rob your mom's jewelry and I'll give you more.
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.000]  And that's called priming the pump.
[10:19.000 --> 10:26.000]  And so our children are having their pump primed with these video games where parents wake up and look at their credit card at the end of the weekend.
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  There's a $2,000, $3,000, $10,000 bill sometimes.
[10:31.000 --> 10:39.000]  One time my mother didn't know how this worked like eight, nine years ago with her iPhone and my son, who was like nine years old then.
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  He said, can I play this dragon game?
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  I forget the name of it somewhere.
[10:42.000 --> 10:43.000]  He killed dragons.
[10:43.000 --> 10:58.000]  And she goes, yeah, she didn't know it was tied to her credit card and it was a $600 bill that she got a few weeks later.
[10:58.000 --> 10:59.000]  But again, let me explain this.
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  And I know you already know all this.
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  You go get this for the vaccine.
[11:03.000 --> 11:05.000]  It's really a nano tech tracker system.
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  People do it because they want to be safe from COVID-19.
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.000]  They've been fear mongered about that'll be for over a year till they quote, give you the vaccine.
[11:13.000 --> 11:14.000]  He already has patented already ready.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  It's all admitted with the digital ink.
[11:16.000 --> 11:17.000]  It's nano tech.
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  And then everybody's like, shut up.
[11:19.000 --> 11:20.000]  I don't want to hear.
[11:20.000 --> 11:21.000]  I want to be safe.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  By the way, I got, I got $1,000 on my credit on this.
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  And at first they admit it's going to be a new cryptocurrency.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  It's going to explode when you've got it.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  Oh, I'm a crypto bear and my thousand I first got.
[11:33.000 --> 11:34.000]  I didn't spend it.
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  It's worth five million now.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  And you're in, you're caught.
[11:38.000 --> 11:39.000]  It's over.
[11:39.000 --> 11:40.000]  It's done.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  And that's the plan.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  How diabolical.
[11:44.000 --> 11:51.000]  You take the digital chip under ID 2020 Bill Gates's public plan.
[11:51.000 --> 11:55.000]  Patent number 2020 060606.
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.000]  It tracks everywhere you go.
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  That's why they need the 5G and the satellites.
[12:00.000 --> 12:06.000]  And if you do the task exactly as they say, you get more credits put on there.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  Oh, the fun part about the vaccine is you get a bank account and money.
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  Oh, and no one can steal it.
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  Because the old problem is thieves might cut the chip out.
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  This just goes into your body.
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  Most of it stays in the spot, but some is smaller nano tech.
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  It drifts and gets into other places.
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  So even if you cut your arm off, you're still have the mark in your body.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  And I've noticed something.
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.000]  All these fake Christian churches and online fake Christians are attacking me right now.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  I'm going, Jones, don't listen to him.
[12:36.000 --> 12:37.000]  He plays rock and roll.
[12:37.000 --> 12:38.000]  He's of the devil.
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  Why this isn't the mark of the beast?
[12:40.000 --> 12:41.000]  Everything's okay.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  The mark is actually this or that.
[12:44.000 --> 12:50.000]  Open world government 666 the patent tracking everywhere you go to buy and sell.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  Money of a man.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  Let he have understanding, reckon the number.
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  It's the number of a man in your body.
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.000]  Money.
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  Making you the currency.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  And tracking your body activity.
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.000]  He's got all the patents together with this tracking system with the chip under the skin that does it.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  It's two different patents that go together.
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.000]  But don't worry.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  The churches are there to say, don't listen to him.
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.000]  Bill Gates is a man of the Lord.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  And you need to take it and be safe.
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  Like Kenneth Copeland said last week, he said, I'm the name of and I won't say it.
[13:27.000 --> 13:28.000]  I demand this virus died.
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  I demand a vaccine.
[13:30.000 --> 13:36.000]  Oh, Lord.
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.000]  Unbelievable.
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.000]  We're going to go to break.
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  I'm going to come back with a really huge announcements.
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  The UN has announced that you will quote, never go back to normal.
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  A new way of life.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  You will have to have a tracker chip.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  You will have to have your cell phone to even leave your home.
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  I will read you the world government masters telling you how to live your life.
[13:55.000 --> 13:56.000]  Unbelievable.
[13:56.000 --> 14:06.000]  Separately, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot impress upon you enough that 10 weeks ago, we've never seen food sales the level they were.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  And now our great sponsor has caught up on the orders.
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  They're actually ahead of schedule.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  They've gotten out almost everybody's orders.
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  They had to stop for two weeks a month ago to get caught up and to open some more factories and to secure more food.
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  They've got it ready to ship to you.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  And now we're seeing substantive food sales.
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  But let me just say something.
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  I said, you need this in case they implode the economy.
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  You need this unless the globalists get their way and are able to keep a continual shutdown going.
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.000]  Now I'm telling you, you absolutely need it because we're going to have a depression now pretty much for certain.
[14:37.000 --> 14:44.000]  How bad it's going to be is if Trump can and we can wake up and say no to this and get past the brainwashing and the fear and get things reopened.
[14:44.000 --> 14:50.000]  Now, again, it's 10, 15, 20, 30 times lower than what they said.
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  They're still saying nothing can reopen.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  They're trying to block the president.
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.000]  You need to get your storeable food now while you still can at four or five times cheaper than what you're going to get in grocery stores.
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.000]  Super high quality.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  It funds this operation.
[15:02.000 --> 15:11.000]  I would get your orders in now for the breakdown of civilization and society and then live off the food and things you can get as things unravel and unfold.
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.000]  Hopefully they turn around. I'd say about a 70% chance we're going into hell itself in the next six months to a year.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  It's very sad, but I would get your food now.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  I'll get your orders in now because it's going to take months and months and months for this to unravel.
[15:23.000 --> 15:30.000]  But you're going to start seeing total breakdown and civil unrest right around the election, which is the globalist plan to try to drive Trump for power.
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  So now is the time to eat your storeable foods at m4store.com.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  The other big dealers don't have food.
[15:36.000 --> 15:37.000]  They're lying to you.
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  We do.
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  It takes a few weeks to get it out to you, but we have the food that's being packaged.
[15:41.000 --> 15:48.000]  Get your orders in now at m4store.com and get stocked up on the supplements and other high quality products you need as well.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  Because who knows how long m4worlds will be here.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  I mean, I'm serious.
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  And we ship the day after your order comes in on the supplements at m4store.com.
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  There's a little bit of a wait on the food.
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.000]  Stay with us.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  You don't know me and will never meet.
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  I had a problem like you once.
[17:06.000 --> 17:12.000]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[17:12.000 --> 17:17.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[17:17.000 --> 17:25.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[17:25.000 --> 17:32.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.000]  And if you have PPO, Private Health Insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[17:37.000 --> 17:44.000]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse. Get clean. Call now and learn more.
[17:44.000 --> 17:57.000]  800-506-6740, 800-506-6740. That's 800-506-6740.
[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  Ten weeks ago, I began to tell listeners that they needed to get high quality, affordable food.
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  Not because of the virus, but because of the crises and the economic shutdown.
[18:08.000 --> 18:15.000]  It would cause, because the globalists were planning to hold America hostage and run a blockade through the blue cities and blue states.
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  Now that prediction has come true, because the globalists are running an operation.
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  It's not predictions. We have their battle plans.
[18:24.000 --> 18:32.000]  So, going back more than eight weeks ago, all major storeable food companies were sold out, except my Patriots supply, because they're the biggest or pre-position.
[18:32.000 --> 18:38.000]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in, that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner.
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  They stopped taking orders until they got caught back up.
[18:41.000 --> 18:46.000]  Well, now they're caught back up. They got high quality, affordable food in stock, ready to be packaged and shipped to you.
[18:46.000 --> 18:51.000]  Get your orders in now at infowarstore.com to go right at the head of the queue.
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.000]  You get delivered to you as fast as possible and from the employer.
[18:55.000 --> 19:02.000]  Here's trouble food now at infowarstore.com.
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.000]  They're running the operation to shut down society, create a depression and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  This is insane. Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[19:34.000 --> 19:40.000]  You need to get prepared now. You need to get high quality, storeable food now back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  And you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[19:44.000 --> 19:50.000]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[19:50.000 --> 19:56.000]  This is beyond 1984. The tyranny of the dual orders here. Get prepared now and spread the word in the info war.
[19:56.000 --> 20:21.000]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[20:26.000 --> 20:46.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[20:46.000 --> 20:55.000]  Imagine if I would have told you, like I did five years ago, that they would release a deadly virus, lock down civilization,
[20:55.000 --> 21:02.000]  come out with a vaccine that had tracker ink in it, digital nano tech that would then control how you could buy or sell.
[21:02.000 --> 21:15.000]  What if I told you the unelected UN working closely with the communist Chinese would cover up the release of the virus?
[21:15.000 --> 21:20.000]  And that Nobel Prize winner would come out and say, we've scanned the virus. It's manmade.
[21:20.000 --> 21:32.000]  Top US institutes. We've scanned the virus. It's manmade.
[21:32.000 --> 21:49.000]  Now there's a big paradox here between people like David Knight, Mike Adams, David Ike and others who argue with each other and get mad at each other over different angles of this.
[21:49.000 --> 22:00.000]  When it's completely normal with the government and the media that's been caught lying to us so much over and over again to question everything and that's healthy and you should do it.
[22:00.000 --> 22:09.000]  I don't agree with David Ike that virus science isn't basically real.
[22:09.000 --> 22:16.000]  But 95% of what he's saying I can prove and know is right. He has a lot of courage. And so I love to have him on.
[22:16.000 --> 22:26.000]  We don't have one view like CNN or MSNBC and then parrot it.
[22:26.000 --> 22:36.000]  Mike Adams thinks that we need to take all these precautions and the virus is much worse than what we're even hearing and I think that's a little extreme but I still understand his point of view.
[22:36.000 --> 22:46.000]  David thinks it's all super exaggerated and that we're giving up our freedom via a bunch of hysteria. Everybody's right in their own way.
[22:46.000 --> 22:57.000]  But what we do know is this. They're counting every death from a car wreck, gunshot wounds, suicide, drug overdose, cancer, you name it.
[22:57.000 --> 23:08.000]  This is admitted by the way. That family asked me is it really true they're counting every death that when someone tests positive for it as that I said yes.
[23:08.000 --> 23:16.000]  And is it true that most of the tests are for common cold that most people have quote genetic material from on an antibody test.
[23:16.000 --> 23:24.000]  It's a test showing you've been in contact with cold viruses. The damn things are everywhere.
[23:24.000 --> 23:31.000]  They're on the surface of counters. They're in the food you eat. They're everywhere.
[23:31.000 --> 23:37.000]  You had an electron microscope and looked at the table. I'm sitting at there. Just there's millions of them right here.
[23:37.000 --> 23:46.000]  So it is a hoax, ladies and gentlemen, that they said there'd be five million dead and then two million dead.
[23:46.000 --> 23:59.000]  Well, if you lock everything down for just two weeks, you'll only have a million dead. And then we locked down for months and there's 30,000 dead.
[23:59.000 --> 24:10.000]  40,000 dead. So that's how this operates. Yes, the virus is real. How deadly it is. You can discuss all day.
[24:10.000 --> 24:20.000]  But it's being used to selectively shut down our economy, irrevocably creating a great depression and to drive populist and nationalist out of power.
[24:20.000 --> 24:26.000]  And to discredit capitalism, which is the global of Steve State, clout and pivot plan that they can't beat capitalism.
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.000]  Authoritarianism, fascism and communism can't outcompete capitalism.
[24:30.000 --> 24:36.000]  And so they've got to destroy capitalism with a race war or a famine or a plague.
[24:36.000 --> 24:42.000]  And that's what they say they'll do or by bankrupting the country with so much welfare.
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  That's clout and pivot. And you're living the admitted attempted takedown.
[24:48.000 --> 24:57.000]  And no matter what the president does and no matter how much the projections are off, they still blame him because America was the target of this from the beginning.
[24:57.000 --> 25:04.000]  So people ask me, well, Alex, you can't have it both ways. You can't say this is a bio weapon.
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.000]  But that it's not as deadly as they're saying and that shutting things down as a hoax. Well, of course I can.
[25:10.000 --> 25:21.000]  If you're coming out with something that is the common cold but souped up so you own the mutation of it, which Bill and Melinda Gates do.
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  You then know the trajectory of what it's going to really do.
[25:25.000 --> 25:36.000]  And then you can own all of the responses and the vaccines and the antibodies to this new thing that's going to be bigger than the flu every year and with us a souped up cold.
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  So it does kill more people than the regular cold.
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  And that's why it's manufactured. That's why it's a bio weapon so they can patent it, which they have so they own it.
[25:46.000 --> 26:01.000]  And it's come out Bill Gates two years ago patented a camera of this. They transferred it to China and I predicted three months ago that they will then as soon as we don't go forward with a lockdown.
[26:01.000 --> 26:08.000]  They will release more deadly strains in the United States and Europe.
[26:08.000 --> 26:16.000]  And that's exactly what's been announced. China has come out and said, oh my gosh, dozens, 30, 40, 50, hundreds of new strains, even more deadly.
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  Shut down, shut down. They've gotten the suits out and show people being welded in again. They go, America, do this.
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  You're not opening and of course there's camera crews and that's fake.
[26:25.000 --> 26:33.000]  It's a real virus but for the WHO, who's in trouble, who's been caught launching it, China's saying, OK, you're right. Don't open again.
[26:33.000 --> 26:41.000]  Because people want, wait, China reopened. Shouldn't we? Oh no, no, you don't reopen. Look, we've got deadly new strains.
[26:41.000 --> 26:51.000]  It's a permanent way of life. Sorry, the vaccine's two, three years out. You're going to be locked up until you get a digital blood scan that shows you've already had it on your phone.
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  And then that means you can go outside and do things.
[26:53.000 --> 27:03.000]  And now the president said that the WHO gives orders to governments through big tech to decide who's safe to go out in public and who isn't.
[27:03.000 --> 27:14.000]  China executes you if you put a video out they don't like. They shot all these videos that were the worst acting I've seen since watching third graders do Peter Pan.
[27:14.000 --> 27:21.000]  Remember the third grade school thing of Peter Pan? They're better actors than this. Almost all of it was staged.
[27:21.000 --> 27:27.000]  You'll have two or three people fall down together on the street at the same time. The welding shut.
[27:27.000 --> 27:34.000]  It was fake. It was garbage. Almost all of it was not real.
[27:34.000 --> 27:43.000]  But to create the hysteria, that's a sigh of 90% of war. The Pentagon will tell you in the modern age is psychological.
[27:43.000 --> 27:51.000]  And so there were some deaths. They use it to shut down Taiwan. They use it to shut down China. It is a manufactured virus.
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  It does have the HIV delivery system. It is something that keeps coming back.
[27:56.000 --> 28:04.000]  Now that's the thing. It's killing really old people and people that are really sick, no young people, which is unheard of.
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.000]  Viruses always kill young people more than old people because they have new immune systems that freak out and you have an autoimmune response.
[28:10.000 --> 28:18.000]  This thing is so alien, it's not even hitting kids. But it's mutating in the body and attacking the testicles.
[28:18.000 --> 28:26.000]  And so here's the facts. It's going to keep mutating. I've looked at this closely. It's designed to mutate.
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  It's five different viruses together at least. They've already tested in labs how it's going to mutate.
[28:31.000 --> 28:38.000]  And that's why they say, oh, get ready. It'll be worse soon. And now they're admitting it because it's going to chew your testicles off.
[28:38.000 --> 28:43.000]  I mean, that's what Bill Gates wants to do. And he wants to reduce your fertility.
[28:43.000 --> 28:49.000]  So everybody's saying viruses don't exist and saying nothing's coming. You're dead wrong. It's far worse than you think.
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.000]  And by next year, it'll be a thousand mutations. And we're going to find out what they really got inside this thing.
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.000]  But they're coming for your fertility. They're coming for your balls.
[28:57.000 --> 29:03.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[29:03.000 --> 29:08.000]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[29:08.000 --> 29:13.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[29:13.000 --> 29:19.000]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes, you can't pay. Don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[29:19.000 --> 29:27.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[29:27.000 --> 29:34.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[29:37.000 --> 29:43.000]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[29:47.000 --> 29:52.000]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I.
[29:52.000 --> 29:57.000]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[30:00.000 --> 30:06.000]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[30:06.000 --> 30:16.000]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[30:36.000 --> 30:47.000]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[31:07.000 --> 31:14.000]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.

[31:59.000 --> 32:06.000]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes Infowars has had.
[32:06.000 --> 32:09.000]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[32:09.000 --> 32:19.000]  But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[32:19.000 --> 32:27.000]  They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance, so now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.000]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is around to be true.
[32:30.000 --> 32:33.000]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[32:33.000 --> 32:37.000]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can't.
[32:37.000 --> 32:42.000]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[32:42.000 --> 32:48.000]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[32:48.000 --> 32:53.000]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[32:53.000 --> 32:58.000]  So be the polar bears you are.
[33:23.000 --> 33:38.000]  I know that I don't understand the way my feelings roll.
[33:38.000 --> 33:54.000]  I've got to look outside again and wonder where I've gone.
[34:08.000 --> 34:15.000]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  Infowars.com and NewsWars.com are the main sites.
[34:21.000 --> 34:29.000]  Band.video has a lot of feeds and so much more, and we're on a lot of different AM and FM stations.
[34:29.000 --> 34:35.000]  Now, I really want to go to a very, very special report here that I just filed.
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.000]  It's on Band.video. I hope that you really, really will share it.
[34:39.000 --> 34:49.000]  And then I'm going to get into Facebook and others coordinating with government to ban anybody on Facebook that dares try to protest.
[34:49.000 --> 34:58.000]  So total direct violation of what you do in the real world on the ground exercising your right to peaceably assemble for redress of grievances.
[34:58.000 --> 35:05.000]  That's the big law of the land all being overrun because America didn't defend people's rights like yours truly.
[35:05.000 --> 35:10.000]  And it is so incredibly dangerous, the definition of fascism.
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  Facebook reached out to state governments and said, do you want this ban?
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  Give us legal authority to do it, which the states didn't have.
[35:17.000 --> 35:23.000]  And the states, it turns out, told them don't do it, but they still did and claimed they were operating as the states.
[35:23.000 --> 35:30.000]  This is true fascism, the very, very definition of it in spades.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  So I will be out there this Saturday.
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  I'll ensure we'll be out there this Saturday in Austin, Texas.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  And that's all important.
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.000]  But we've launched a nationwide movement that everybody can get involved in.
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  You can sign the petition, you can sign up to get updates.
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  We're going to coordinate other groups nationally, try to create a focal point.
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.000]  We're going to be updating the site a lot.
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  We're very, very excited about it.
[35:50.000 --> 35:56.000]  Can'tcloseamerica.com, can'tcloseamerica.com, and timetoopen.com.
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  Here's the report.
[35:58.000 --> 36:05.000]  Half the planet is under house arrest, one of the most extreme forms of martial law.
[36:05.000 --> 36:11.000]  And we're told it's all being done because of COVID-19 and the United Nations, the WHO, the UN,
[36:11.000 --> 36:17.000]  the very groups that overestimated the death toll 10, 20, 30 times in all their graphs.
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.000]  Now tell us we've got to stay permanently locked down and take forced inoculations
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.000]  and have embedded digital chips to buy and sell and have forced inoculations
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  to ever be able to go out and leave our homes again.
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  This isn't some far-off Mark of the Beast tyranny that's coming.
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  It's here, hitting us like a Mack truck running over a family.
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  What can we do to fight this?
[36:43.000 --> 36:51.000]  How can we resist it and how can we turn the tide against this worldwide medical tyranny takeover?
[36:51.000 --> 36:57.000]  Timetoopen.com is not just a place for Americans to demand our basic freedoms and common sense
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  and a right to live and a right to travel.
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  It's also a place for people around the world to begin to organize with petitions
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  and plans of legal, lawful, peaceful, direct action.
[37:08.000 --> 37:14.000]  This site, Timetoopen.com, is the web portal where the people of not just the United States
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  but the world are already beginning to organize to take action.
[37:18.000 --> 37:24.000]  I'm personally launching Can'tCloseAmerica.com that is a subsection on the site for Americans
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.000]  across the country to organize now while there's still time
[37:27.000 --> 37:32.000]  because there's not much more time until the depression that's already begun here and worldwide
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.000]  becomes irrevocable and extremely deep.
[37:35.000 --> 37:41.000]  The UN's own numbers admit that a half a billion people are now on the edge of starvation
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.000]  and that several million more are already starving to death right now
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  and will die because of the global shutdown.
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  And that's a central point not being raised by President Trump,
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  not being raised by the Democrats and not being raised by other governments
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  and populations around the world.
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.000]  That in the first world, you might lose your house, you might go bankrupt,
[38:01.000 --> 38:05.000]  you might not have money all the time to buy as much food as you'd like,
[38:05.000 --> 38:10.000]  but it's still not a death sentence like it is in many areas of Latin America,
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  That's right, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times more people die
[38:16.000 --> 38:21.000]  every year of starvation in the world that have died of COVID-19 in the last four months.
[38:21.000 --> 38:27.000]  And that number is set to expand wildly because when the first world shuts down,
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.000]  the third world collapses and tens of millions more die.
[38:32.000 --> 38:38.000]  And the very UN, the very WHO that worked with Communist China and the Wuhan lab
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  to cover up its leak and to cover up that it was spreading
[38:41.000 --> 38:46.000]  are now our bosses directing how long the shutdown must be
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  and that we all have to take force to inoculations to prove we're good people.
[38:50.000 --> 38:55.000]  They're the same ones that are now starting to try to raise money to ship food in
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  to the millions their policies are starving to death.
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  The corporate media that gets its marching orders from the United Nations
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation makes you think it's about
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  millions of people out of work and thousands of businesses closing their doors,
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.000]  in many cases permanently, and that's bad.
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.000]  But it's really about fundamental basic rights to travel and to have businesses
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.000]  and to communicate that have been hard fought in the last thousand years
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  being erased overnight.
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.000]  There are a lot of other great grassroots organizations that are starting up
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  around the United States and the world saying, hey, we have a right to work.
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  We're essential. Why are big corporations allowed to stay open?
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  This is vertically integrating the economy. This is a corporate takeover.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  And all of that is true. That's only one layer.
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  Beneath it is the medical tyranny to forcibly inoculate you
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  and Bill Gates admits that hundreds and hundreds of thousands will get sick
[39:46.000 --> 39:52.000]  and many will die from his vaccine and that it might not even protect you.
[39:52.000 --> 39:57.000]  Then you find out Bill Gates and his foundations are pushing for this to establish
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.000]  a planetary private corporate government that controls every facet of your life
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  and that within the vaccine that he's proposing and has patents for
[40:06.000 --> 40:12.000]  a digital ink tattoo ID 2020 with MIT is put under your skin
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.000]  that shows you can go outdoors and have a job and that will be used as the global
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  government currency with a cryptocurrency.
[40:20.000 --> 40:23.000]  This isn't coming. This is here.
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  This isn't revelations 2000 years ago. This is unfolding now.
[40:28.000 --> 40:31.000]  So it's a lot bigger than just opening small businesses.
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  It's a lot bigger than just being able to go to the park or go back to school.
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  This is about a fundamental globalist revolution against humanity.
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.000]  And the other organizations out there don't understand this.
[40:43.000 --> 40:49.000]  This is about a criminal corporate authoritarian world government takeover.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  So here on this site we are going to have videos and articles from around the world
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  showing the resistance. We're going to spotlight the resistance here in the United States.
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  We're going to put up our own petitions.
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  We're going to post other people's petitions and make it a clearinghouse
[41:03.000 --> 41:08.000]  for people to come and to share information because on Facebook, Twitter,
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  Google and other platforms they are banning anyone that questions this in any way.
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.000]  Because again, we're not just losing our freedom to move.
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  We're losing our freedom to speak.
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  And so that's why we've established these new sites and organizations
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  so that the people have a chance to fight back against this.
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.000]  That's why the globalists fought so hard to get me off the air in the last few years ahead of this
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.000]  because I laid out their actual plan in my film Endgame 14 years ago
[41:36.000 --> 41:41.000]  showing their own documents how they premeditatedly had all this prepared.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  And I told the world that Bill Gates would lead the world government movement
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  for the implantable microchip, forced inoculation and the digital currency.
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  And now it's here.
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  But because of listeners and viewers supporting our organization,
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  we're still on air though we have been badly bloodied.
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  But that's okay.
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.000]  Being the tip of the spear is about taking responsibility for yourself and humanity
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  and standing up for what's right.
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  And now I'm begging all of you for my own children's future
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.000]  and your future and your family's future to come together,
[42:11.000 --> 42:18.000]  get organized, get focused and get aggressive politically, economically and culturally against this tyranny.
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.000]  Humanity must come together now and stand against this police state takeover.
[42:23.000 --> 42:24.000]  The virus is real.
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.000]  It kills about the same amount as a bad flu.
[42:27.000 --> 42:30.000]  But the fear they've been hyping and the hysteria to stampede you
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  and to giving up all your freedoms, that is the giant hoax.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  Designed to take out the West economy.
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  Designed to punish the West for rejecting globalism.
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  There's about a minute left on this report.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  It's at man.video.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  Our video streams are down.
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.000]  They told us that at the data center the cable was cut, the fiber optic.
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  So who knows what's happening there?
[42:50.000 --> 42:51.000]  A lot of stuff going on.
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  We still got the audio streams going.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  The satellite feeds the TV and radio stations.
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  So stay with us and spread those links.
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.000]  And I'm here to tell you I don't need you to thank me and tell me I've done a good job.
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  I've done nothing but my duty.
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.000]  I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum coming after innocent people.
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.000]  And I've been fighting them for 13 years.
[43:12.000 --> 43:15.000]  And I'll never stop while I'm growing better.
[43:15.000 --> 43:23.000]  For 26 years, Alex Jones and Info Wars have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide.
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.000]  Waking people up to the new world order.
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  Bohemian Grove.
[43:28.000 --> 43:31.000]  The American deep state.
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  The rise of communist China.
[43:34.000 --> 43:37.000]  The plan for global depopulation.
[43:37.000 --> 43:42.000]  And global elite pedophiles who prey off of our young.
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.000]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us.
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.000]  But because of your support, our fight continues.
[43:48.000 --> 43:49.000]  Join us.
[43:49.000 --> 43:51.000]  Support the Info War.
[43:51.000 --> 43:54.000]  And together we will slay the dragon.
[43:54.000 --> 43:55.000]  Keep fighting, Alex.
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  You're the gladiator.
[43:57.000 --> 44:03.000]  Colbert is now in command of you and your family.
[44:03.000 --> 44:06.000]  Google and Facebook as well as Apple,
[44:06.000 --> 44:10.000]  work closely with our organization they have scored.
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.000]  To surveil your every movement with robot drones
[44:14.000 --> 44:19.000]  and other systems to ensure the safety of the public.
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  Of course it was I, 12 years ago, with Obama,
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  who serves us well and voucher.
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.000]  Who transferred the bio weapons to communist China
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  so we could now release the weapon.
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.000]  But without the loving liberal media,
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  scaring you in the submission and the corporate press,
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  worshiping corporations that shut down all access
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.000]  as well as blue city governors and mayors.
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.000]  We would never have been able to give you the depression
[44:50.000 --> 44:55.000]  that will destroy your future forever and starve the third world.
[44:55.000 --> 45:21.000]  Well done, American colleagues.
[45:26.000 --> 45:30.000]  This unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses
[45:30.000 --> 45:36.000]  and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[45:36.000 --> 45:37.000]  Yes.
[45:37.000 --> 45:42.000]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  Working together in perfect synchronicity
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.000]  to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[45:49.000 --> 45:50.000]  So what are you waiting for?
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  Go to the Info War store.
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  Never been a better time than right now.
[45:55.000 --> 46:00.000]  Super male vitality at infostore.com.
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  The America that we've known and loved,
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  the America that was the land of the free home of the brave
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  is dying right now.
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  And everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us,
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.000]  shutting us down and making us dependent on them.
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  The food shortages have begun.
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  The depression is going to be long and very, very serious.
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  In fact, it's probably too late now to even turn back.
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  We don't try to stop it.
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  But the mainstream media working with the tri-coms blocked it.
[46:24.000 --> 46:29.000]  That's why you and myself and everybody else has to get prepared now.
[46:29.000 --> 46:30.000]  Do not wait.
[46:30.000 --> 46:31.000]  It's not about the virus.
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  It's about the economic chaos that's going to be unleashed
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  in the next six months to a year.
[46:35.000 --> 46:38.000]  Get your high quality, sourable foods at infostore.com.
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  They're available again before a limited time.
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  The food supply is running out.
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  There are major shortages.
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.000]  This is a globalist siege, a globalist lockdown,
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  globalist terrorism.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  We the people, the patriots have to be prepared.
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  We've already been proven right about prepping so far.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  We'll get ready to be really proven right.
[46:56.000 --> 47:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  I got to tell you folks, this is one hell of an adventure.
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  Tell-to-tell with the fallen one and his one-world government mark of the beast,
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  it's not coming.
[47:31.000 --> 47:32.000]  It's all here.
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.000]  Force inoculations are incoming.
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.000]  But we're still here on air because you keep coming back for more.
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  Crank it up.
[47:41.000 --> 47:53.000]  You keep coming back for more and so do I.
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  Sure do.
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.000]  All right, I've done massive preparation for this show,
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  and it's when I do massive preparation,
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.000]  and there's just incredible news that I tend to spend out of control,
[48:03.000 --> 48:04.000]  and I apologize.
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.000]  We're going to take your phone calls throughout the transmission now.
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  I'm going to give the toll-free number out right now.
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  877-789-Alex, first-time callers, long-time callers,
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  people that disagree, people that agree.
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.000]  But I want it to be on the lockdown, the martial law, the forced inoculation,
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.000]  the mark of the beast, just the whole insane thing we're in,
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  and how does Trump and how do we get ourselves out of this?
[48:27.000 --> 48:33.000]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.000]  Now, folks, when I get up here and I tell you there's stuff going on behind the scenes,
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.000]  and then most of the time I never tell you about it,
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  there's reasons you don't hear about it, and those are strategic.
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  Here's just one thing I was dealing with yesterday,
[48:46.000 --> 48:53.000]  and I'm not complaining, but that's why I was getting really angry on the rest of this,
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  because look at this headline.
[48:55.000 --> 49:03.000]  Alex Jones' ex-wife rebuffed in bid to gain daughter's custody after he courted COVID-19 at Rowley.
[49:03.000 --> 49:08.000]  And this is being run all over the United States when it said Jones had his daughters taken today
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.000]  and emergency court hearing while it didn't happen.
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  And guess why it didn't happen?
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.000]  Before I went out there, I knew there was a Supreme Court ruling in Texas two weeks ago
[49:20.000 --> 49:26.000]  that you can't take people's children away in custody battles for police officers,
[49:26.000 --> 49:32.000]  nurses, doctors, telephone company repair people, delivery people, radio host,
[49:32.000 --> 49:38.000]  media people, folks that are deemed essential.
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  So before I went out there, I had the law on my side,
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.000]  but I wasn't sure still it was going to happen, so I did it.
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  So yeah, do I have skin in the game? You better believe I do.
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.000]  But I love the article because the left is freaking out.
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  It says Jones who has full custody of his children.
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  I thought I didn't have my children.
[50:00.000 --> 50:07.000]  See, that's the level of deception.
[50:07.000 --> 50:12.000]  That's the level of BS that goes on.
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  And again, it's not just about Alex Jones. It's understanding how these systems operate.
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  I'm sure you saw the news.
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.000]  Jones claims he has a cure to COVID-19 and a treatment.
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  Never said that. Never said anything close to that.
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.000]  But they still run that headline everywhere.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  Until I've got cousins and people calling going, Alex, do you really have a cure?
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  You're a moral guy. Do you have it? I want it.
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  And I'm like, no, I don't have it. Well, the news says you do.
[50:38.000 --> 50:42.000]  See, people that know me but don't really listen a lot, they know I'm a good guy.
[50:42.000 --> 50:48.000]  So they're calling me old friends, old college buddies, old girlfriends.
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  Oh my God, my mom, you know, she's old. Do you have the cure?
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  And I'm like, no, but the news says you have it.
[50:56.000 --> 51:02.000]  See, they trust the media so little that they think I've really got a cure.
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.000]  When the media says I do because they trust me, not them.
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.000]  But see, that's the level of deception. There's a whole nother lie to it.
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  I didn't say I had a cure or a treatment. Man, this will make your head spin.
[51:12.000 --> 51:17.000]  I mean, this will make your head spin.
[51:17.000 --> 51:21.000]  So all I'm saying is please pray for us because there's stuff a lot bigger than this.
[51:21.000 --> 51:27.000]  I can't tell you about. And they said it's your final warning.
[51:27.000 --> 51:32.000]  Leave Bill Gates alone. Leave this alone. Back down.
[51:32.000 --> 51:36.000]  Or the SWAT team's coming.
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.000]  And it's not a pissing contest. It's not that I'm Mr. Badass or anything.
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.000]  I said, do your worst. Piss up a rope. Fill your hand.
[51:45.000 --> 51:49.000]  I will never abandon ship.
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.000]  Ever.
[51:52.000 --> 51:55.000]  But it doesn't mean the ship won't sink beneath me.
[51:55.000 --> 51:58.000]  So let me just explain to listeners.
[51:58.000 --> 52:04.000]  We're at death con five. Let me say it's not just me.
[52:04.000 --> 52:11.000]  I personally know highest levels of government, highest levels of independent media that's fighting for freedom.
[52:11.000 --> 52:14.000]  And they are having their families threatened. They are being threatened.
[52:14.000 --> 52:20.000]  People are coming to their houses. People are breaking in over their phone lines and death threatening their wives.
[52:20.000 --> 52:32.000]  Almost most of the people you see at Fox that are good were already not in the Fox building before because of the security issues inside the building.
[52:32.000 --> 52:39.000]  I couldn't imagine if this building was open to to, you know, the outside like a Fox news or something how people even operate.
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  Well, they don't operate.
[52:41.000 --> 52:44.000]  It's no secret that Tucker lives in Maine.
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  I knew it two years before it was even in the news.
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.000]  But it's it's bad and I don't say to go over victims.
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  Oh, poor us. No, man, I'm just telling you, we're in damn foxholes.
[52:56.000 --> 53:00.000]  It's like the Alamo. We're sending letters out, you know, on the back of wallpaper saying help.
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  We, you know, we're about to be overrun by a group 10 times our size.
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.000]  But victory or death, you know, get this out.
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  I'm just letting you know, man, final dispatches. These can be final dispatches.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  Now, hopefully we go on another six months a year, two years.
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.000]  Hopefully sanity comes back in. We turn this around somehow.
[53:18.000 --> 53:23.000]  But I want to explain something to you. We're not in a normal period anymore.
[53:23.000 --> 53:31.000]  Now, I'm going to go to your phone calls at 877-789-2539-877-8789 Alex into the second and third hour.
[53:31.000 --> 53:35.000]  Joel Scousen is popping in with his very measured research information as well.
[53:35.000 --> 53:44.000]  I'm a little behind so far, but I've got to do something here when we start the next hour that is so powerful and so important.
[53:44.000 --> 53:50.000]  I'm going to read you three definitions on here of war.
[53:50.000 --> 53:56.000]  And then I'm going to ask you what we're living in today.
[53:56.000 --> 54:01.000]  And then I'm going to get into Zuckerberg on TV saying,
[54:01.000 --> 54:05.000]  state governments asked us to shut down illegal protest. Well, that's not true.
[54:05.000 --> 54:10.000]  Facebook called and did it. And they're not illegal. They're protest.
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  And the Supreme Court of Texas has already ruled we can have these protests.
[54:13.000 --> 54:21.000]  You know what happened when Owen Schroyer showed up at about 12 noon on Saturday at the state capitol.
[54:21.000 --> 54:25.000]  And normally you'd have a permit to be up in front of the capitol as he did it down on the street.
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  They had a couple of provocateur anti-foot dressed up in American flag outfits.
[54:29.000 --> 54:33.000]  We know who they are. Tried to start a fight with cops. The state police saw right through it,
[54:33.000 --> 54:38.000]  didn't even arrest them, just shoved them to the side and said, Owen, we can't control this down here.
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.000]  We appreciate what you're doing. So does the governor.
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.000]  This is off record, but on record. They should want to say their names.
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.000]  Please come up in front of the capitol and we'll protect you from these people.
[54:49.000 --> 54:55.000]  We'll protect. Okay, so that's the fight club stuff that's going on here in America.
[54:55.000 --> 55:01.000]  And the anti for guys trying to attack the state police. It didn't work. People see right through your crap.
[55:01.000 --> 55:06.000]  But that's what it's like now. This is total war for the Republic.
[55:06.000 --> 55:11.000]  If Trump can't get things turned on, I said a month ago, within a month and a half, two months were done.
[55:11.000 --> 55:19.000]  Most estimates are we're already screwed, blue and tattooed and up the creek without a paddle.
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.000]  But it's going to get really bad. You know, I told you, I saw an estimate that two million are currently starving to death
[55:24.000 --> 55:31.000]  on top of the 10 million that died this year. Sorry, the UN, the ones that are behind it now want more money.
[55:31.000 --> 55:37.000]  30 million starving to death. That's triple the normal number right now.
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.000]  But you're not going to hear about their names. You're not going to hear a damn thing.
[55:40.000 --> 55:44.000]  You're going to hear about 40,000 Americans and we all candy ass around with our mask and everything else.
[55:44.000 --> 55:53.000]  By the way, people are asking, why are you selling an info wars mask, cloth mask, black mask with info wars on a very nice looking mask
[55:53.000 --> 55:57.000]  for men and women when you're saying this is all pretty much overblown hype?
[55:57.000 --> 56:04.000]  Because if you've got to wear it to go in a store or whatever, getting you ready for the microchip, the conditions to go in a store,
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.000]  you might as well get the word out while you do it and you can breathe through these better.
[56:09.000 --> 56:14.000]  Because you're not going in stores or anything for six months or forever without this.
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  This is the peer pressure. So when the vaccine comes out and all the forced garbage, people go, hey, do it.
[56:19.000 --> 56:25.000]  We want to get back to work. Now, here's a huge key piece of intel I'm going to cover when we come back.
[56:25.000 --> 56:30.000]  That I'm glad John the boom operator brought up because it was the first thing I was going to cover today.
[56:30.000 --> 56:40.000]  When I got up at 6am, I was reading the news. It reminded me of the fact that I saw Michael Snyder article on info wars.com.
[56:40.000 --> 56:47.000]  And his headline, he said, as long as we don't overwhelm the hospitals, open the country back up.
[56:47.000 --> 56:52.000]  We did this so the hospitals wouldn't be overwhelmed because there were going to be millions dying.
[56:52.000 --> 56:57.000]  Now it's 40,000 and they're counting all these old people that died of something else.
[56:57.000 --> 57:03.000]  Think about that. We were told it was for overwhelmed hospitals and it was only two weeks.
[57:03.000 --> 57:07.000]  Now we're a couple months in. They're telling us it's forever. Here's the UN.
[57:07.000 --> 57:12.000]  WHO warns people need to get new to the new way of living and that this will never end.
[57:12.000 --> 57:17.000]  The UN is suddenly world government and our boss. Incredible. Folks, pray for the best.
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  Hope for the best, but stuff's getting bad. Prepare for the worst.
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  Get your high quality storeable foods at infowars.com. They're back in stock, ready to ship out to you for economic collapse and craziness.
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.000]  It's one of those check marks you got to check off and purchasing it there gets high quality food that's actually in stock.
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.000]  You'll actually get and it supports the M4. So don't wait. Get storeable food at infowars.com.
[57:36.000 --> 57:42.000]  And a lot of items like SuperMail Vitality that's so good is back in stock and a lot of these products are 40 to 60% off
[57:42.000 --> 57:47.000]  like Vitamin Mineral Fusion and Winter Sun. Get yours while you still can.
[57:49.000 --> 57:55.000]  Well, Communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy used by half.
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  And the United States wouldn't sign on to it. So guess what happened?
[57:58.000 --> 58:05.000]  Along came COVID-19 and Bill Gates is celebrating saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half.
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.000]  And that means you're going to be poor now and under his control.
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  And of course, with the medical tyranny comes the forced inoculations.
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.000]  A eek microchip that comes with the vaccine and so much more.
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.000]  And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[58:21.000 --> 58:26.000]  So remember, folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your basic rights.
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.000]  The same left that says to kill babies all day long.
[58:29.000 --> 58:35.000]  Women on their bodies now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you.
[58:35.000 --> 58:38.000]  If you don't submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home, mark the beach.
[58:38.000 --> 58:43.000]  Oh, and guess what? Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates
[58:43.000 --> 58:48.000]  under a bunch of dirty devil worshipers in your face. They hate you and your family.
[58:48.000 --> 58:55.000]  There's a process where you take a stallion and you tie him down and you cut his testicles off and then he becomes gilded.
[58:55.000 --> 59:00.000]  Well, that's what's happening to the entire world right now. We're going into deep, deep tyranny.
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.000]  Boys like North Korea and China are going into deeper tyranny as well.
[59:03.000 --> 59:10.000]  It's all directed by the U.N. It's all a big, cooked up, giant plan to absolutely take control of your life,
[59:10.000 --> 59:13.000]  bankrupt the economy and make you dependent on the big mega banks.
[59:13.000 --> 59:19.000]  And to get your universal income, you're going to have to take the inoculations, brainwash your kids the way they say
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  and have absolutely no freedom. And it's all happening, boom, overnight.
[59:22.000 --> 59:26.000]  This is a giant revolution. And as soon as you put the handcuffs on, they said,
[59:26.000 --> 59:31.000]  oh, it's just an extended spring break, two weeks. Notice now it's 18 months, two years, five years.
[59:31.000 --> 59:36.000]  It never ends. No one can ever die from a virus again. Government will save you.
[59:36.000 --> 59:41.000]  It's a takeover. It's the opposite. They're coming with forced inoculations on record.
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.000]  They'll reduce your fertility, lower your immunity, and in many cases kill you
[59:45.000 --> 59:48.000]  and they're telling you it's going to hurt a lot of people.
[59:48.000 --> 59:55.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  We've got calls coming in from Norway, Iowa, Florida, New York, California,
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  Chicago, Illinois, Wyoming, Washington D.C., Washington State, Texas,
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  my beloved Texas, and more.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  It is Tuesday, April 21, 2020, 195 days down from the election.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  And I'm going to your phone calls next segment and I've got just the transmission
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  that in the future if we win this fight will be fabled roar.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  But first, my friends, let's go to a little interaction from local talk radio yesterday
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  and one of our news investigators, Rob Dew calling in. Here it is.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  Zuckerberg calls it harmful misinformation in the times of a medical emergency.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  Rob is in South Austin. Hello, Rob. How are you doing today?
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  I'm doing good. Yeah, I think we really ought to look at Facebook and how they control information.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  Robert Epstein last year came out and said, you know, they could sway 6 million votes
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  just by putting out alerts or not putting out alerts for people to go vote on election day.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  So anything this man does at this point should be considered election meddling.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  Yeah, the story from CNN I'm seeing now says Facebook said they were contacted by some states
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  and asked to help remove this content.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  Now, that is overreaching government.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  You're calling up and saying, oh, I see that my constituents are planning to protest my orders.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  You've got to take that down. You've got to get out of office.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  People don't see the command and control that's going on with entities like Facebook.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  They've got everybody on their platform and then they go, hey, now we're going to control what you can say
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  and what you can't say and we're going to kick you off.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  I recently got removed from Twitter for quote, abusive behavior,
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  which all I'm doing is sending out article links and stuff like that.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  But no, it's not the right article. It's not the right point of view.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  So we're going to censor you. And I really think you guys should be backing people like Alex Jones,
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  who are out there on the front lines trying to get people motivated,
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  because let me tell you what, the economy is going to crash if we keep this up much longer.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  All right. Thanks so much.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Listen, I believe you have every right in the world and I just come from a different side.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  I'm not taking the lead from Alex Jones in anything. You got that? Anything.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  He's a nut. He's a nut and he's bad for this state and he's bad for this town.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  And then Owen Schroyer had a great response to that later on the show.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  We'll play that for you. But I'm a nut.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  I predicted all of this. I laid it out. I told you 10 weeks ago it came out of the Wuhan lab.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  And now the Nobel Prize winner for virology for discovering HIV when nobody else could find the virus
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  says it's completely manmade 100%.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  In fact, guys, we have the audio of the radio show he was on
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  or the blog show and they're trying to argue with him and he goes, no, no, let me explain.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  Maybe we should play that later. This is powerful stuff.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  Nobel winning scientist claims COVID-19 virus was manmade in Wuhan lab.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  How many universities and scientists do you need?
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  The Indian lab first came out 10 weeks ago and said, this is ridiculous.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  They said it's 100% manmade is a 57 manmade.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  You can look at it and tell it's been made.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  You look at a mountain, you know, no, that's not manmade.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  You look at this highlighter in my hand, that's manmade.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  Did man make me? No, God made us. Humans made each other. Genetics did.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  But this is manmade. This is artificial. This highlighter is fake.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  It's not original. It didn't come out of the organic sphere.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  It was artificially produced.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  This Eramati I'm drinking has an artificially made tinfoil can,
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  but that came out of the earth and was refined and the plant inside came from nature.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  But still, you can say this is manmade.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  Well, let me tell you what's manmade, ladies and gentlemen, is that damn virus.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  And the fact that the whole corporate media tries to block and ridicule
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  what is coming out of top scientists shows you they know the jigs up.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  Because you know who made that virus and who cooked it up?
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Bill Gates, baby, leads right back to that smiley piece of garbage.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  Now that this UN global government shycomb billable into Gates medical tyranny
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  has seen how far they can push it now, we just laughed it up like poison.
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  You know now they're going to launch more biotechs and even more hardcore.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  This early one does kill people, but see it's a virus billable into Gates own.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  It's a virus that's novel from others so they can give you a vaccine.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  You see, a regular cold or flu virus, you really can't do a vaccine for
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  because it's always mutated. But see, because this is a chimera and lab made,
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  they can have a speciality.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  So it's a whole giant franchise, they can filter the rich off of it,
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  they can surveil everybody, everybody gets to become a suspect.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  And now when you would have low numbers of death, it doesn't matter because
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  they make a huge spectacle out of it.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  You watch next year with the flu, it'll even be bigger as well.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  This is what they've done to us because we're a bunch of domesticated idiots.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  We are back live. I'm your host Alex Jones on this live Tuesday global transmission.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  I want to go to your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  And we're going to do that. But it is a big, big deal right now
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  that it's confirmed the virus is manmade, the Nobel Prize top neurologist,
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  Discover of HIV is confirmed with all these other universities and labs have confirmed.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  It's confirmed it came out of the Wuhan lab. It's confirmed that the WHO covered it up.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  And then it's confirmed that the WHO is in charge now of how long we're locked down.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  Now, now let's look at how this was done from the start.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  If you go back 10, 11 weeks ago when Communist China used us to shut down the Taiwanese protest
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  to lock down their country, they shot a lot of exaggerated and dystopic fake videos
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  where a man and woman both fall down and start convulsing.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  And you obviously very bad acting in hundreds of videos.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Doesn't mean the virus is fake. Doesn't mean it's not happening.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  But it's greatly exaggerated.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  And then we're told it's just an extended spring break in early March.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  We're just going to have two weeks and that's it. You'll all get a check.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  And I said, folks, it's like the famous cases with the serial killer Ted Bundy who go to the mall.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  He dressed for a conservative. He'd have a non-threatening yellow Volkswagen.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  He admitted this later. He'd walk over and tell teenage girls,
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  hey, you want to go drink some beer? Have some ice cream? Want to go have some fun?
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  And as soon as he got them in the car, he'd put a gun to their head and he'd say,
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  look, just put these handcuffs on.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  And I just want to talk to you while they're on and I'll let you go.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  But if you don't, I'm going to hurt you.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  And all of them, but one woman, that's how you later got caught.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  Said, yes, sir, put the handcuffs on. You put the handcuffs on.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  He's going to take you to a dungeon and torture you over three days and rape you and
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  electrocute you and bite big chunks out of your ass.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  Now, folks didn't listen. We're now being marched down the stairs into the basement.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  There's women hanging off meat hooks.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  Now you still got time to headbutt Ted Bundy and to try to throw him down the stairs.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  But I know the average American now.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  They're going to thank him while he's biting big chunks literally out of your ass.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  Thank you, sir. May I have another? Not me.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  Everything I do on this show is don't put the handcuffs on.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  Okay, try to jump out the side of the car, roll in a populated area.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  He'll have trouble getting you back in the vehicle.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  You know, you're in the middle of the town.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  Throw yourself to the windshield.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  It should do something. You're dead.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  I'm like, we're at the farmhouse. Oh my God.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  Fighting once you get out, run towards the road. You're not listening.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  Now, you're in the house.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  He's going to take you to a basement.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  Okay, when you start going on the basement, headbutting, fighting, he's going to tie you up down there.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  And you're like, shut up, Jones. You racist.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  I am like, now we see the torture table with the electrical wire.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  We're going to be tied down the bailing wire.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  And I'm just pleased.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  At least you're not going to listen.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  You're going to get on the table.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  You're going to put your mask on as a symbol of slavery.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  You're going to awake the force inoculation, the digital currency, and you're going to submit because
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  you know subconsciously you killed 62 million babies.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  You know subconsciously your life doesn't mean anything.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  And you want Ted Monday to torture you for three days.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  And he will.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  But the three days are an analogy. It's going to be a decade of hell for you and your family.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  And you're going to turn your children over from pedophiles to have sex with them.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  But you'll get your digital money, don't worry.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  And you're going to submit to everything you're supposed to to prove you're a good little globalist.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  So the moral of the story is getting in the car with Mark Zuckerberg, getting in the car with Bill Gates is a mistake.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  Remember I always told you don't get in the car with Bill Gates.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  He's coming with world government force inoculation, depopulation.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  He runs the whole show, all the big foundations fund him.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  He's the kingpin.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  Beware.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  Be like, Jones, leave Bill Gates alone.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  He couldn't even invent windows.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  You know, he's a moron.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  I'm like, beware.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  You're like, he wears a salmon colored shirt.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  He dresses like the Easter Bunny.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  He's not threatening.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  Ted Bundy dressed just like that.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  He said he would wear pink shirts.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  These psychos are all the same.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  He wears pink shirts.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  Warren Buffett drives around in a Volkswagen bug.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  I don't know why these psychotics are all the same.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  But they like getting it over on you, period.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  It's like Warren Buffett has always pictured with an ice cream.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  I'm getting the van kids ice cream.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  I've got a puppy.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  So everybody's freaking out right now all over the internet going, oh my God, Jones is right.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  How did he know it was Gates?
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  How did he know that the guy told you he wants to establish world government to carry out
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  forced depopulation on Lair News Hour 26 years ago.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  The interview is out there.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  We've played it here.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  I made full link films about this.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  And so these psychotics are so disconnected.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  They're always like, look, I've got a puppy.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  I've got ice cream.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Look, let me get a beer.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  Elizabeth Warren, let me get a beer.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  Their husband says, well, you don't normally drink beers.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  He says, well, I'm going to have a beer.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  It's like bettoes.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  Like let me have hamburgers.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  He's cooking these weird hamburgers on English muffins.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  I mean, it's like the Coneheads moved in next door.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  They act like space aliens because interdimensionally, folks, these people are not human.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  They could be black.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  They could be white.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  They could be old.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  They could be young.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  But you take African voodoo.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  What's that saying?
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Something else jumps into you, folks.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  Well, every culture has that in their legends because it's true.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  These people aren't operating with a full deck.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  The elevator don't go all the way to the top because the lights are home.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  But nobody's home.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  You think those are people, folks.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  You think people weave webs like this.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  You think people want success and challenges and life and enjoyment and building and doing amazing things.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  People don't act like this.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  Working their whole lives to get control and generational power passed down to establish world government to forcibly inoculate us and depopulate us and dumb us down.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  This is a planet killing spirit.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  All right.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  I'll go to break and come back with your calls and then I'll get into Zuckerberg saying you're not allowed to go out and protest.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  But if you wonder why these globalists want to abort babies and molest kids and why they can't keep away from it, they are drawn to the life force, but they want to drink it up and snuff it out.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  All right.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come right back with your phone calls and I'm also just going to leave it at this.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  With all the craziness that's going on in the world today and the fact that food shortages have already started around the world and the U.N. is now reporting 30 million people extra starving to death.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  That's the U.N. saying that after what they've done, now they want more money to save the folks they're already killing.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  Of course, they'll never save them.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  The whole plan is to starve them.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  You need to get prepared.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  You need to get ready.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  You need storable food.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  You can go pay five times more at the grocery store and get little bags of stuff that's 80% air or you can get info wars, high quality, storable foods that we have in stock.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  They have to be packaged so it takes a few weeks, but we're ready to take orders again.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  But as folks are figuring this out, that orders are escalating again, so get your order in now to lock in quick delivery.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  Because when you get your order in, it locks in the quick delivery.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  You get the delivery date.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  They tend to be ahead of schedule in almost every case over, you know, under promise over deliver.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  But this is high quality, swarble food.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  Yes, and it funds our operation with what we're doing in the middle of this ongoing depression.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  But get the food now so you have it so that box is checked off.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  We have swarble food available again, but they any time they say, OK, that's it for orders.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  Your order gets in, it gets delivered on time.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  But if the orders don't get in, we have to cut it off.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  It can be in a week or two, I'm told.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  We won't be able to order here.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  We do have the supplements now.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  The food comes out in a few weeks.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  Supplements we have in the warehouse ready to ship to you.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  We have the foods just got to be packaged and inspected and all that.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  But get your high quality supplements as well at infowarsstore.com.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  There's so many of them and a bunch of big specials running right now.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  Attention, all radio listeners, who still need food supplies?
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  If you've thought about the implication of food-related supply chain disruptions
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  and are concerned about the coming quarantines, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  Here's why.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  In the next few days, all Americans will face extremely hard choices.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  If we've learned anything from China and Italy,
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns are just a few days away here in the US.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  Listen, while dehydrated food is becoming scarce,
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  you can still get enough open pollinated heirloom seeds to grow a one-acre crisis garden.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  The truth is, growing nutrient-dense vegetables in the days ahead
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  may actually be the single most important thing you do.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  Go to survivalseedbank.com and watch the new video to understand the nature of the threat.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  This could be life-saving.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  Lockdowns can last from six to eight weeks.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  Get free bonus seeds.
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  Special quarantine reports too.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  Go to survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate dot com.
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  until one day I chose to lead my family to freedom.
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden,
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  Fire your flies, water.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  Here's the Nobel Prize winner for discovering HIV,
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  pointing out this a man made by a weapon.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  This is the biggest story because it's the globalist on purpose
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  and it leads back to the NIH under Obama.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  And Trump just brings that out.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  He can expose all of it.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  And they're agenda to bring down America, blame the virus on him.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  Can be stopped.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  And then the millions and millions starving to death can be saved.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  But it's too common sense.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  It's too easy.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  People are too one-dimensional.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  Hundreds of millions are going to starve to death now.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  It is an act of war to shut down the economy of a farming
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  or industrial state.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  But at least with those economies,
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  the people are somewhat self-sufficient.
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  But when you shut down a service economy
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  that we're promised under globalism,
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  it's going to be so good for the earth.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  Well, you make the population obsolete.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  And that's really the term being introduced now
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  with this whole UN world government power grab you're seeing
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  that just sets the stage for the real power grabs
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  that are coming in the future.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  And that is, you are non-essential.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  You are obsolete.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  A lie.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  No man is obsolete.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  And the state has no use for your kind.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  I don't care.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  I tell you, I don't care.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  I'm a human being.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  I exist.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  That's what authoritarians tell you.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  How would they have a show back in the early 1960s
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  about being obsolete with Rod Serling?
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  This is not a new world.
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  It has patterned itself after every dictator
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  It has refinements, technological advances
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  and a more sophisticated approach
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  to the destruction of human freedom.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  There have been a big anti-authoritarian,
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  big anti-Nazi, big anti-communist.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  He wrote those stories.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  Where did he come up with this?
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  Well, he'd seen it.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  In fact, he says in the intro to the obsolete man,
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  he says this isn't new.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  This is from the old world, just in our modern time.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  A system that wants to make the individual obsolete.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  So when you hear, oh, you're non-essential.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  And the big banks will give you a check with strings attached.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  But you'll also owe tax money on that down the road.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  This is called slavery.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  The Communist Chinese released a bio weapon
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  out of the Wuhan Bio Weapons Lab.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  And then under Obama and under Fauci and the NIH,
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  in 2012 through 2017,
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  they transferred a Chimera coronavirus
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  artificially created to China.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  U.S. intelligence is saying this week
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  that the coronavirus likely came from a level four lab in Wuhan.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  There's also another report that the NIH
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  under the Obama administration in 2015
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  Why would the U.S. give a grant like that to China?
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  I've been hearing about that.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  And we've instructed that if any grants are going to that area,
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  we're looking at it literally about an hour ago
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  and also early in the morning.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  We will end that grant very quickly.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  But it was granted quite a while ago.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  They were granted a substantial amount of money.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  We're going to look at it and take a look.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  But I understand it was a number of years ago, right?
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  When did you hear the grant was made?
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  2015.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  2015?
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  Who was president then? I wonder.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  Now, it's since come out that the Pentagon
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  and Associated Press have gotten the documents
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  that indeed it came out of Wuhan
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  and the Chinese worked with the WHO to cover it up.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  That's broke a week ago.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  Now, the discoverer of the HIV virus
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  who won a Nobel Prize is arguably the top horologist in the world.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  Came out to the world a week ago and said,
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  I've looked at it.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  We've scanned the virus at our laboratory
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  because they have those systems
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  and the Indians and others are damn right.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  It's 100% lab-made.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  And then the U.S. government trying to say,
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  okay, it came out of Wuhan,
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  but it was naturally occurring.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  No, only genetic engineering creates these.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  It's now my great pleasure to invite Lady Gaga.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  I'm Dr. Tedros.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  I would like to thank the World Health Organization
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  and the United Nations as well as Global Citizen.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  Thank you very much, Dr. Tedros and Hugh Evans
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  for all of your leadership in this fight against COVID-19.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  The Global Citizen Lady Gaga won World at Home concert
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  to support the World Health Organization
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  is the moment when Hollywood draws the line in the sand
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  as blatantly as possible between the American people
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  and Hollywood's globalist masters.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  Over 20 million Americans are fighting to file for unemployment.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  I dial the number and it's just like a busy, like, beat, beat, beat,
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  and then it just keeps beeping.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  That's all there is.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  Brianna Marshall of Milwaukee is a hairstylist and a mother
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  and one of more than 76,000 Oregonians
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  filing for unemployment benefits right now.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  And I have called, I can't even count anymore,
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  just over and over, I mean, probably 300, 400 times.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  Small businesses that have been around for decades
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  are permanently closing
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  and the measly $1,200 check promised to all of us
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  by the government hasn't reached as many as it should have.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  And we recognize that the average American household
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  has an income of $4,000 a month.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  A $1,200 check isn't going to go very far.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  The Satanists in Los Angeles want all eyes
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  on their million-dollar quarantines
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  to support a foreign entity
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  led by a Chinese-installed director, Tadros,
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  who propagandized three cholera outbreaks in Ethiopia
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  and has now directly caused the deaths of thousands of Americans
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  due to touting Chinese disinformation.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  We know roughly the timeline.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  We know that China concealed it from the WHO.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  We know that the WHO at worst looked the other way
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  if they weren't actively aiding and abetting this.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  And we know that China locked down Wuhan
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  and prevented shut down domestic flights,
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  especially flights to Beijing,
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  but did not shut down international flights.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  So at best for the Chinese government, there is negligence.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  At worst, it may be that this thing got out,
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  infected a bunch of people.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  The Chinese government knew, the Communist Party knew,
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  that they had a real problem on their hands
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  and figured, hey, if it's going to infect China,
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  why should we stop it from going around the world?
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  Because we can't have China's position relative
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  to the rest of the world be weakened.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  Global Citizen and the World Health Organization
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  have received an incredible outpouring of support.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  Thank you, World Health Organization.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  The United Nations urges us to think global
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  and act locally to prevent future outbreaks.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  Here to tell us more is Secretary General of the UN,
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  Antonio Guterres.
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  Thank you for your support
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  for the lifesaving work of the World Health Organization
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  and the other humanitarian agencies.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  Yes, liberal snowflakes,
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  Orange Man Bad isn't going to send the largest donation
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  per year to the World Health Organization.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  That can now be the dishonor
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  There's a lot of vaccine candidates that we're backing
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  and I'm optimistic by late next year
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  one of those will come out
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  and we need to make sure that gets out to everyone
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  in the world.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:54.000]  Thank you.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  Thank you.
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:58.000]  Thank you.
[1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:25.000]  Thank you.
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  Thank you.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  Thank you.
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  Thank you.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:33:05.000]  Thank you.
[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  Thank you.
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  Thank you.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  Thank you.
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  Thank you.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  Thank you.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  Thank you.
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  Thank you.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  Thank you.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  Thank you.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  Thank you.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  Thank you.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  Thank you.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  Thank you.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  Thank you.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  Thank you.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  Thank you.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  Thank you.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  Thank you.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  Thank you.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  Thank you.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  Thank you.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  Thank you.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  Thank you.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  Thank you.
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  Thank you.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  Thank you.
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  Thank you.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  Thank you.
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  Thank you.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  Thank you.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  Thank you.
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  Thank you.
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  Thank you.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  Thank you.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  Thank you.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  Thank you.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  Thank you.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  Thank you.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  Thank you.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  Thank you.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  Thank you.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  Thank you.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  Thank you.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  Thank you.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  Thank you.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  Thank you.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  Thank you.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  Thank you.
