[00:00.000 --> 00:11.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:11.960 --> 00:19.440]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.440 --> 00:31.080]  Alex Jones welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Friday August 24th 2015 I'm
[00:31.080 --> 00:34.000]  David Knight your host today we're going to have a report at the bottom of the
[00:34.000 --> 00:37.720]  hour from Alex Jones we're also going to be joined in the second hour Paul Joseph
[00:37.720 --> 00:42.440]  Watson and in the third hour we're going to be talking to John Rappaport and of
[00:42.440 --> 00:46.920]  course we're going to be talking to him about GMOs about vaccines mandatory
[00:46.920 --> 00:53.320]  vaccines there's an interesting article that was on Lou Rockwell it was written
[00:53.320 --> 00:56.640]  by someone who said they were at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center with
[00:56.640 --> 01:01.200]  their daughter they said there was an antibiotic resistant bacteria that was
[01:01.200 --> 01:05.000]  there at the time seven people were infected two of them died so that's
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.680]  about a 14% casual rate he said the daughter were fine but they thought
[01:10.680 --> 01:13.840]  they would see something about it in the news instead everybody was panicked
[01:13.840 --> 01:18.200]  about measles which hasn't killed anybody yet but of course it talks about
[01:18.200 --> 01:22.560]  how absurd this whole narrative has become about mandatory vaccines
[01:22.560 --> 01:27.880]  destroying our informed consent it talks about imagining the playbook we're
[01:27.880 --> 01:31.200]  going to talk about that in the next segment as well of course there's a
[01:31.200 --> 01:34.200]  couple of stories we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson about PayPal
[01:34.200 --> 01:39.640]  asserting copyright ownership over all intellectual property of its users and
[01:39.640 --> 01:46.440]  a story that I'm actually a little bit apart of the SPLC has come out attacking
[01:46.440 --> 01:50.680]  the oathkeepers who are protecting the miners from the BLM making sure they're
[01:50.680 --> 01:56.320]  going to get their due process in court they're trying to paint them as terrorists
[01:56.320 --> 02:00.480]  as usual of course I did a video while back you'll see that at the bottom of
[02:00.480 --> 02:09.640]  the article SPLC prophets of hate P-R-O-F-I-T-S that kind of profit not saying
[02:09.640 --> 02:13.360]  what's going to be coming out of course we go with some comparisons there you
[02:13.360 --> 02:17.960]  can see in that thumbnail I've got Morris Dease and his sidekick there as
[02:17.960 --> 02:22.360]  Jim and Tammy Faye Baker we crossfade that in there because that's the way
[02:22.360 --> 02:25.680]  they've been referred to by people on the left is the Jim and Tammy Faye Baker
[02:25.680 --> 02:30.960]  of the civil rights movement trying to cash in on everything and that's really
[02:30.960 --> 02:35.120]  what the Southern Poverty Law Center is about when they say hate watch they're
[02:35.120 --> 02:40.440]  inspiring hate they're inspiring hate of Christians of people who believe we
[02:40.440 --> 02:43.920]  ought to have a limited constitutional government of people like the ones in
[02:43.920 --> 02:48.360]  Oregon who think they ought to have due process what started this whole thing in
[02:48.360 --> 02:52.720]  Oregon and of course that's the video that I have there when I talked to
[02:52.720 --> 02:57.080]  someone there in the mining community this is something that goes back to the
[02:57.080 --> 03:01.600]  mid-1800s these are property rights when you have mining rights when you have
[03:01.600 --> 03:05.400]  grazing rights when you have hunting rights what these are things that are
[03:05.400 --> 03:09.160]  property just as much as your home is property this is the way these people
[03:09.160 --> 03:13.520]  make their living to have a clear title yet because there was a dispute there it
[03:13.520 --> 03:17.760]  is not a paperwork dispute as they portray it in the article from the
[03:17.760 --> 03:22.520]  Southern Poverty Law Center when they had this dispute they decided they were
[03:22.520 --> 03:26.000]  going to just shut these guys down because they were challenged asked why
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.200]  they were on the property by one of the caretakers they got offended by that
[03:30.200 --> 03:34.840]  that's what you'll see in that interview and so they decided that they would just
[03:34.840 --> 03:38.400]  shut the whole operation down and they weren't going to let this go through the
[03:38.400 --> 03:43.600]  courts they had a deadline of tomorrow they said shut your mind down get out
[03:43.600 --> 03:47.760]  of there get your equipment out take your your buildings down and fill up the
[03:47.760 --> 03:50.760]  holes that have been there and if you look at this this is not a destructive
[03:50.760 --> 03:54.920]  mining process for those of you who have a knee-jerk reaction to just hearing the
[03:54.920 --> 03:59.280]  word mining this is a process where they've got a very small hole there you
[03:59.280 --> 04:04.360]  you can you'd have to basically bend over get on your hands knees to get into
[04:04.360 --> 04:06.840]  that place I don't know how these guys even work it but this is a very old
[04:06.840 --> 04:11.480]  traditional mine a very small scale I'm sure what they want to do is run all of
[04:11.480 --> 04:14.600]  these miners who've been there for 150 years out of there so they can turn it
[04:14.600 --> 04:18.240]  over some big multinational corporation that's probably the end game that's what
[04:18.240 --> 04:22.840]  they were doing in Nevada running the ranchers out there who had had grazing
[04:22.840 --> 04:28.560]  rights for 150 years many of them so basically Oath Keepers showed up not as
[04:28.560 --> 04:32.840]  a confrontation but as security just to make sure that they weren't going to
[04:32.840 --> 04:36.840]  attack them and force this issue and now it's going to go through the courts
[04:36.840 --> 04:40.320]  apparently we're glad to see that and we're going to talk about that with Paul
[04:40.320 --> 04:43.680]  Joseph Watson we're gonna talk a little bit about the Southern Poverty Law
[04:43.680 --> 04:48.480]  Center's history as well when we come back stay with us we'll be right back
[04:58.360 --> 05:02.680]  Joe Binks here with info wars dot com Obama and Saudi support Al Qaeda and
[05:02.680 --> 05:06.400]  Yemen according to corporate media reports the Saudis are worried about

[07:08.160 --> 07:11.560]  discovered the new world order the globalist their agenda I started an
[07:11.560 --> 07:15.400]  access television show I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around
[07:15.400 --> 07:20.720]  with radio guys that I began drinking I began smoking cigars and then even
[07:20.720 --> 07:26.600]  cigarettes I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a
[07:26.600 --> 07:32.360]  job of the hut so I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100
[07:32.360 --> 07:37.280]  pounds I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in

[08:09.120 --> 08:38.560]  raging war on corruption it's Alex Jones welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Friday August 24th 2015 I'm David Knight your host today Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us in the second hour we're going to be talking about a couple of articles that are up on info wars dot com SPLC accuses oath keepers of inciting armed confrontation over the sugar pine mine as well as an article that just went up a few minutes ago
[08:38.560 --> 09:00.560]  paypal asserts copyright ownership over all intellectual property of its users they've got a new users agreement you know kind of like what the federal government does with the Constitution they just say oh by the way we've just arbitrarily amended that sometimes they don't even tell you oftentimes they don't tell you so that's what the corporations do as well because
[09:00.560 --> 09:18.560]  they're kind of two heads of the same snake and it is a two headed snake the government and the large corporations also in the news we have Hillary furious as thousands of Americans are sending cigars to her office there's an organization called send Clinton cigars where you can
[09:18.560 --> 09:36.560]  anonymously purchase cigars and have them directly mailed to Hillary and tens of thousands of people have done that you can see that picture the massive stack of cigars they've got waiting to go to Hillary and they have a subtitle tagline at their website Clinton
[09:36.560 --> 09:52.560]  so when ski 2016 don't blow it they say so that's what they're doing you know as dredge points out the top of the drudge report Hillary is getting bombarded with attacks and he links to an article I think it was from the New York Times and of course they've been some of the ones who have been
[09:52.560 --> 10:07.560]  attacking her basically not even an attack just an ex exposure of what's been going on with the Clinton Foundation Chelsea came back and said our foundation is as transparent as any foundation and we say yeah
[10:07.560 --> 10:24.560]  transparently criminal is Reuters other people have been conducting investigation showing that they falsified the transparent reports that they put out there they would think if you put out a report and you say look I'm transparent and the information on the report is a lie
[10:24.560 --> 10:38.560]  what do we make of that. I guess that's kind of standard operating procedure for the Clintons isn't it. Also we see the rich and powerful continue to get by with nothing happening to them.
[10:38.560 --> 10:57.560]  We have Petraeus just as I said yesterday don't bet on him getting sentenced anytime the he had he had pled guilty and they had the sentencing hearing yesterday and I said he's not going to do any jail time he's going to be at Bilderberg this year and guess what he got two years probation.
[10:57.560 --> 11:14.560]  Okay, imagine we have John Kiriakou who exposed torture and the CIA he gets two years in prison but Petraeus gets two years probation. We have people like Manning who exposed criminal actions by the CIA going through WikiLeaks.
[11:14.560 --> 11:29.560]  He gets put in jail for a very long time but of course Petraeus gives books of information to his mistress to help her to impress her whatever so he gets absolutely nothing but he did get a fine and boy the judge got really rough on him.
[11:29.560 --> 11:49.560]  He more than double the fine they thought he was going to get a $40,000 fine instead he got hammered hammered with $100,000 fine and put that in perspective antiwar.com says well to send a message the judge sentences David Petraeus to 75% of one of his speaking fees.
[11:49.560 --> 12:07.560]  Yeah, he gets paid according to Speakerpedia he gets paid up to $132,750 for each speech so there I guess he could maybe deliver a speech about I don't know maybe about this leak that he's got some of the interesting tweets that came out about this interesting comment.
[12:07.560 --> 12:23.560]  This person in particular, Justlyn Radick and she has a government accountability project she was Ed Snowden's lawyer she's also represented other whistleblowers like Thomas Drake I don't know if she represented William Benny she also represented John Kiriakou I believe.
[12:23.560 --> 12:36.560]  She herself was an ethics lawyer within the Department of Justice and when she did her job exposing that the FBI had violated due process in a high profile case the Department of Justice suppressed that.
[12:36.560 --> 12:47.560]  As an ethics lawyer she became a whistleblower herself and now she is representing whistleblowers she commented on Twitter said, And so Petraeus can travel outside the US, unlike John Kiriakou.
[12:47.560 --> 12:58.560]  Yeah, because he's going to travel to Bilderberg can't keep him from that he's become a regular attendee there at Bilderberg he's been there the last two or three years I know at least two years he's been there.
[12:58.560 --> 13:12.560]  Kiriakou can't attend his son's graduation and he can't accept international invitations to speak he's basically not allowed to leave the country and she also points out that Petraeus is not even going to have to give up his guns.
[13:12.560 --> 13:20.560]  She said he'll probably in a little bit of sarcasm receive a pardon a parade and a postage stamp well for sure we know that he's a presidential advisor.
[13:20.560 --> 13:34.560]  And he's going to probably increase in that role so there you go one standard for them and another standard for everybody else is kind of like all these politicians who admit that they smoked marijuana and as part of a youthful indiscretion.
[13:34.560 --> 13:49.560]  And we also just let that go but you know they're not going to let any youths go they're going to send people to jail for a very long time they're going to ruin other people's lives but of course if it's done within the families of the rich and powerful.
[13:49.560 --> 13:53.560]  So let's just move on there's nothing to see.
[13:53.560 --> 14:10.560]  None of these guys will even consider allowing something like marijuana to be used medically even though they use it recreationally and I'm talking about you Jeb Bush especially you who fought this in Florida but of course Sheldon Adelson was in that as well.
[14:10.560 --> 14:20.560]  He pretty much funded this effort to shut down medical marijuana in the last election almost single handedly provided all the money and of course Sheldon Adelson if you don't know who he is.
[14:20.560 --> 14:26.560]  He's a Las Vegas casino owner who seems to be able to get whatever he wants from the Republican Party.
[14:26.560 --> 14:35.560]  He made massive contributions to Lindsey Graham and Lindsey Graham put through a bill to stop online gambling because you know that be competition to Sheldon Adelson.
[14:35.560 --> 14:40.560]  So I wonder why he got involved in a medical marijuana issue so heavily in Florida.
[14:40.560 --> 14:48.560]  Does he consider the possibility that people might use marijuana recreationally because that was not even on the ballot there.
[14:48.560 --> 14:58.560]  Does he consider recreational use of marijuana to be a competition to his racket to gambling and of course they talk about the Sheldon Adelson primary.
[14:58.560 --> 15:08.560]  Everybody was talking about how all these candidates were going by in the Republican Party because he spent between 90 and 100 million dollars in the 2008 election.
[15:08.560 --> 15:18.560]  First backing Newt Gingrich then backing Mitt Romney so he didn't really he's not very good at picking winners even though he runs a casino.
[15:18.560 --> 15:30.560]  Okay so but still it's a lot of money he can make a lot of campaigns and if people remember what happened in the real Sheldon primary when Ron Paul backers were essentially blocked from going.
[15:30.560 --> 15:41.560]  They said that this basically they had a caucus in Clark County in Nevada and that's pretty much the entire population of Nevada lives in Clark County.
[15:41.560 --> 15:53.560]  It's huge it goes from Las Vegas all the way up to the Bundy Ranch and and elsewhere but most of the population is in that one county and they had a caucus and so he said well this is going to conflict with.
[15:53.560 --> 16:03.560]  It was on a Saturday night I think that was going to conflict with Jewish people going so they were going to have a Jewish only primary on Sunday and they tried to keep people out.
[16:03.560 --> 16:14.560]  And of course there are people who had reasons besides the Sabbath that they couldn't attend that primary it was absolutely outrageous the games and the criminal games that they played in that primary.
[16:14.560 --> 16:32.560]  But of course now they're back in the open and there's been a lot of talk about how Sheldon Adelson the Koch brothers are openly picking candidates and the money that's at stake there is so important that these primaries these little private hearings that they're having with the billionaires.
[16:32.560 --> 16:39.560]  Are perhaps more important than really winning some of these small primaries in some of the smaller states.
[16:39.560 --> 16:45.560]  And so we have to ask is this an election or is it a selection.
[16:45.560 --> 16:56.560]  And as HL Minkin said and repeated this many times an election is an advanced auction of stolen goods we can certainly see that with the politicians that are there and of course the author.
[16:56.560 --> 17:04.560]  Who is coming out with this book showing the Clinton cash and how that has moved around is also working on an expose of Jeb Bush.
[17:04.560 --> 17:08.560]  It should be a target rich environment I imagine.
[17:08.560 --> 17:20.560]  Also in the news we see that the economy apparently is not too good especially if you're selling heavily processed adulterated food McDonald's is closing 700 stores.
[17:20.560 --> 17:30.560]  This is a story that went viral on info wars dot com from Kit Daniels. They say that the fast food giant quietly closed 350 stores in the first quarter.
[17:30.560 --> 17:38.560]  So that brings up about 1000 stores in just the first quarter or so of this year.
[17:38.560 --> 17:51.560]  With that in perspective McDonald's has 35000 stores worldwide so that's about 3% of their stores. They're closing in the first quarter and looking at now and of course one of the reasons is an 11% decline in revenue.
[17:51.560 --> 18:03.560]  A 30% drop in profit for the first three months of the year we're seeing a lot of big box retailers as well as these mega corporations are really cutting back.
[18:03.560 --> 18:16.560]  Again that points to the concerns that a lot of people have about the state of the economy even though we hear all of this rosy news out of the Obama administration even though the stock market is in a massive bubble.
[18:16.560 --> 18:23.560]  We see that Amazon dot com lost and I don't have the article here. I think it was something like $57 million in the first quarter.
[18:23.560 --> 18:36.560]  We see the target closed 300 some odd stores in Canada and of course the bankers are talking about how they can try to stimulate the dead economy by going to negative interest rates.
[18:36.560 --> 18:44.560]  In other words incentivizing you to go ahead and spend your money. Don't save anything. It's not enough of a disincentive to not pay you anything for the money that's in the bank.
[18:44.560 --> 19:02.560]  We're going to actually punish you for saving heavily punish you and as a part of that we talked about that with Paul Joseph Watson earlier this week instituting techniques to abolish the use of cash and of course the government is heavily into that.
[19:02.560 --> 19:12.560]  Now we're going to talk about the Southern Poverty Law Center story and the hit piece they did on the Oathkeepers out in Oregon when Paul Joseph Watson joins us.
[19:12.560 --> 19:23.560]  I want to play a clip of what one of the people there at the sugar pine mine said what the real question is when he was talking to the Oathkeepers. Let's play that clip.
[19:23.560 --> 19:33.560]  Well recently there's been some discussion in the media as to whether we were right or wrong to bring in the Oathkeepers to help protect our constitutional rights and our right to do process.
[19:33.560 --> 19:46.560]  The real question here isn't whether we were right or wrong. The real question needs to be asked and discussed is why we have to seek outside help to preserve our own rights in our own country from our own government.
[19:46.560 --> 19:59.560]  That's the question. That's the question. And I can tell you what the answer to that is. The answer is that our Congress long ago long before these trade agreements they delegated they advocated their authority to these bureaucrats.
[19:59.560 --> 20:07.560]  It's always been nature's very own antibiotic and only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions. Silver lungs dot com.
[20:07.560 --> 20:15.560]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience. Just a lifetime of nano sized pure silver solutions. The silver lungs generator allows you to make your own.

[25:04.560 --> 25:20.560]  the story about PayPal now changing the user agreement saying that they are asserting ownership copyright ownership overall intellectual property of its users we're going to break that down but we were talking in the last segment about this story about the
[25:20.560 --> 25:36.560]  SPLC coming after the oath keepers coming after the miners there you heard that clip just before we went to break as to the question is why would we need to be protected by oath keepers against our government and of course the answer is is that just as our
[25:36.560 --> 25:51.560]  Congress has abdicated its authority on these trade agreements turning it over to corporate lawyers in the same way they long ago turned over their legislative responsibility abdicated that to these bureaucrat these bureaucracies that
[25:51.560 --> 26:06.560]  they've created allowing these bureaucrats to write the laws for Americans unelected perpetual bureaucrats as one of the reasons why things don't change regardless of whether we got republicans or democrats in power is because of these massive armies of bureaucracies creating their
[26:06.560 --> 26:21.560]  little empires where they write the law they have their own enforcement mechanism and they also have their own little courts their own kangaroo courts and that's why you need to have people to your neighbors to protect you there's
[26:21.560 --> 26:37.560]  a lot of different ways that we can protect each other to we can start to get an awareness that we all have due process rights and what those rights are and the purpose and the responsibility and duty of juries that was ultimately the major
[26:37.560 --> 26:52.560]  check I believe that we had against usurpation of power that was put in the Constitution that is a long tradition in English and American common law and that is trial by jury and the understanding that jurors are there not just to judge the facts of the case but to look at
[26:52.560 --> 27:10.560]  the law to look at the way it's being applied and basically protect each other now I want to go back to this situation in Oregon there's a poem our government land and this is also from the Oath Keepers video I want to play a little bit of that for you just a few seconds
[27:10.560 --> 27:26.560]  tonight let's go ahead and play that my name is Steve Beck and I just like to contribute a poem to this it's called on government land the government is taking away everything only to make it their own you can't even hold conversations on your own private
[27:26.560 --> 27:41.560]  telephone they own the water they own the air they own everything and they own everywhere if they can't own it they just steal it away turn it into a park and then they can say they own it they own it with taxes they own it with fees no matter the cost they do is they please they
[27:41.560 --> 27:56.560]  think they own us they treat us like cattle they hurt us like cattle and treat us like sheep after the shearing our fleeces to keep sooner or later if we don't take a stand we all shall be living on government land
[27:56.560 --> 28:13.560]  absolutely they think that they own everything they assert that they own everything and there's really an element of corporate fascism involved in this because it is a partnership between government and big business that's what we're going to see and
[28:13.560 --> 28:29.560]  increasingly seeing with these efforts by Monsanto to keep us from knowing what's in our food to block any efforts to inform consumers to allow them to have a choice and of course with vaccines saying you're not going to be informed and we don't care whether or not you've got consent
[28:29.560 --> 28:44.560]  just shut up and take the shot as I mentioned in the very first segment there was a story up on Lou Rockwell dot com person who wrote this said earlier in the year they went to medical center there was an outbreak of a superbug there seven people got infected two people died
[28:44.560 --> 28:59.560]  they were there with their daughter they thought there would be some reporting of it but no they didn't hear anything about that all you heard about was the measles outbreak where nobody died using that to push for mandatory vaccines and so this author says well you're
[28:59.560 --> 29:14.560]  not trying to imagine what their playbook looks like and came up with several points I just wanted to throw these headlines out to number one make it clear that parents who choose not to vaccinate their children are only getting their information from Jenny McCarthy Jim Kerry and other celebrities
[29:14.560 --> 29:30.560]  with absolutely no scientific credentials and also number two equate the views of the CDC the medical journals and pharmaceutical companies spokespersons with science some people tell you science is a method it's not a conclusion but don't listen to them and you know what if all of that doesn't work
[29:30.560 --> 29:47.560]  just hold a gun to their heads say shut up and do it because I say so I own you we're going to talk about what's going on with cars we're going to play a little bit of a video of a car show that was here just a week ago one of the best car shows in the country stay with us we're going to show you some clips of that we'll be right back

[33:18.560 --> 33:31.560]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex Jones
[33:31.560 --> 33:51.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today we have an article that's up on infowars this Friday Alex Jones versus the mainstream media embedded in that is a documentary film from no more news and that's KNOW no more news exposing the mainstream media's propaganda campaign to ridicule Jones
[33:51.560 --> 34:09.560]  I want to play a little bit of this documentary we're not going to play of course the entire documentary because it's quite long but I want you to get a sample of what this looks like and you can see the entire video at infowars.com let's roll that now
[34:09.560 --> 34:22.560]  First they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight with you
[34:22.560 --> 34:28.560]  some guy on the radio we don't really know who he is I don't know because I don't pay attention to him and what's his face
[34:28.560 --> 34:43.560]  a guy that we don't talk about very often because he's so insignificant and we don't really care but he's also psycho can we just say what it is he's a really spooky guy and you just have to be careful of it and as long as you know who he is it's fine
[34:43.560 --> 34:59.560]  they've been trying to ignore us in past decades and now they can't
[34:59.560 --> 35:16.560]  I'm not the king of conspiracy I'm the king of reality
[35:16.560 --> 35:24.560]  conspiracy theorist Alex Jones
[35:24.560 --> 35:31.560]  he's marginalized him by calling him a conspiracy theorist
[35:31.560 --> 35:55.560]  Alex Jones most dishonest you know journalists of our age
[35:55.560 --> 36:01.560]  Alex Jones is a lunatic an absolute diehard insane lunatic
[36:01.560 --> 36:07.560]  Alex Jones has forwarded some of the most outrageous ridiculous conspiracy theories about how the world works
[36:07.560 --> 36:11.560]  all you've got is shooting your mouth off with that cliche term
[36:11.560 --> 36:26.560]  Alex Jones is pushing outright lies and propaganda on a regular basis and I think it ultimately subverts the important real journalism that independent journalists are doing on a regular basis by giving the impression that everyone's running around wearing tinfoil hat
[36:26.560 --> 36:41.560]  now here comes the lunatic conspiracy theory of the night
[36:41.560 --> 36:56.560]  instead of sitting there saying I was a conspiracy theorist
[36:56.560 --> 37:12.560]  I tried to label this verse saying very reasoned, very learned, very skilled man as a crazy lun as an off the charts madman
[37:12.560 --> 37:27.560]  he's drawing things on a chocolate right like oh and then two squared is four but the four squared is like 28 oh my god oh my god
[37:27.560 --> 37:43.560]  this guy's lost his frickin mind
[37:43.560 --> 37:56.560]  that's in a CIA memo from 1963 that you say conspiracy theory, tinfoil hat, I mean that's declassified but CIA rather they killed Kennedy put out these talking points
[37:56.560 --> 38:00.560]  if you talk to Alex for any length of time you discover all kinds of things that you didn't know about the world
[38:00.560 --> 38:01.560]  we've blown it wide open
[38:01.560 --> 38:03.560]  you have, you have absolutely blown it wide open
[38:03.560 --> 38:14.560]  this guy's agenda is that the United States government blew up the World Trade Center so when you start with that premise you're in a whole different category
[38:14.560 --> 38:26.560]  and remember put yourself back a few years I know we have short memories but this is the guy who was convincing 50% of Democrats that George W. Bush was responsible for bringing down the World Trade Center
[38:26.560 --> 38:28.560]  he was that close with them
[38:28.560 --> 38:33.560]  he was trying to create a partisan wedge to keep people in the partisan left right paradigm
[38:33.560 --> 38:36.560]  look man I'm way asked this junior high controls
[38:36.560 --> 38:37.560]  I got that, I got that
[38:37.560 --> 38:42.560]  he thinks that George Walker Bush, the President of the United States ordered the destruction of 9-11
[38:42.560 --> 38:48.560]  he's the guy that had some sort of pumping action blew up the World Trade Centers and the Pentagon he did it
[38:48.560 --> 38:50.560]  but that's what this nutcase believes
[38:50.560 --> 38:53.560]  he was essentially comparing President Bush to Adolf Hitler
[38:53.560 --> 39:00.560]  he exposed 9-11 on the day in fact two months before I had intel that elements of the military-industrial complex were going to carry out the attack
[39:00.560 --> 39:05.560]  I said they'll use bin Laden the known CIA asset as their patchy to take the blame for attacking the towers
[39:05.560 --> 39:07.560]  if any terrorism comes it's from this government
[39:07.560 --> 39:13.560]  and if there was an outside threat like a bin Laden who was a known CIA asset in the 80s running the Mujahideen war
[39:13.560 --> 39:17.560]  whose family builds all the military bases over in Saudi Arabia right now
[39:17.560 --> 39:18.560]  he's the boogeyman they need
[39:18.560 --> 39:20.560]  and this were welly and phony system
[39:20.560 --> 39:25.560]  and now we have come to a decision that maybe the United States is looking for a boogeyman always
[39:25.560 --> 39:28.560]  that conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theory
[39:28.560 --> 39:31.560]  it's an internet talk show called Info Wars
[39:31.560 --> 39:35.560]  these political fringe sites they have facts they have figures they quote people
[39:35.560 --> 39:39.560]  yet they're treated by much of the media as if they're somehow credible
[39:39.560 --> 39:43.560]  that a quote from one of those sites is no different than something from the New York Times
[39:43.560 --> 39:46.560]  we've got to have the media call anyone that questions us conspiracy theorist
[39:46.560 --> 39:51.560]  and any media that's not the Washington Post or New York Times is a conspiracy theory
[39:51.560 --> 39:55.560]  the website Info Wars a paranoid online haven run by Alex Jones
[39:55.560 --> 39:58.560]  he's on the internet and he's got a lot of followers he's got a big website
[39:58.560 --> 40:02.560]  he usually preaches to his own little paranoid choir
[40:02.560 --> 40:08.560]  I think that this internet stuff with his access now that people have has made more crazy people
[40:08.560 --> 40:14.560]  really smart people have come up to me and said you know I just saw this on something from Info Wars
[40:14.560 --> 40:16.560]  do you know anything about it?
[40:16.560 --> 40:18.560]  yeah stay away from it
[40:18.560 --> 40:21.560]  you have to be careful of who you get your news from
[40:21.560 --> 40:23.560]  well I got it from Info Wars
[40:23.560 --> 40:29.560]  okay well then I can tell you right now it's most likely not true
[40:29.560 --> 40:32.560]  you can't trust a word of the guy says another word
[40:32.560 --> 40:36.560]  the system is extremely threatened by us telling the truth
[40:36.560 --> 40:40.560]  they're extremely threatened by the fact that they've been caught lying
[40:40.560 --> 40:44.560]  and engaging in so much oppression and so much corruption for so long
[40:44.560 --> 40:46.560]  that they're really floundering around
[40:46.560 --> 40:50.560]  the important thing about what Alex Jones is about what he represents
[40:50.560 --> 40:55.560]  is that he has pushed out completely baseless conspiracy theories
[40:55.560 --> 40:59.560]  to literally tens of millions of Americans out there
[40:59.560 --> 41:02.560]  many of whom actually believe what he says
[41:02.560 --> 41:05.560]  what really would concern me about somebody like him
[41:05.560 --> 41:08.560]  is the amount of influence he has a growing influence
[41:08.560 --> 41:11.560]  as he boasts it he's got millions of people listening to him
[41:11.560 --> 41:15.560]  some of his YouTube rants have got tens of millions of people watching them
[41:15.560 --> 41:19.560]  and he ferments this fear of a tyrannical regime
[41:19.560 --> 41:22.560]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist
[41:22.560 --> 41:26.560]  whose stories often make their way from his website Info Wars
[41:26.560 --> 41:30.560]  where on any day you can find headlines about vaccines, mass fluoridation
[41:30.560 --> 41:35.560]  and the 9-11 cover-up into the so-called mainstream GOP establishment
[41:35.560 --> 41:40.560]  in every tragedy the Info Wars Alex Jones world thinks they see a conspiracy
[41:40.560 --> 41:43.560]  every time there is a mass shooting or a terrorist attack
[41:43.560 --> 41:46.560]  Jones is quick to blame them on the government or global forces
[41:46.560 --> 41:50.560]  from September the 11th to the Boston Marathon bombings
[41:50.560 --> 41:54.560]  Jones calls acts of violence false flag operations
[41:54.560 --> 41:58.560]  and he's been on the air since day one saying this is a job of the FBI
[41:58.560 --> 42:02.560]  it's a false flag job you heard the reporter question as whether it was a false flag job
[42:02.560 --> 42:06.560]  meaning they're twisting it around to make it look like it's something else
[42:06.560 --> 42:08.560]  another entity but really is the government
[42:08.560 --> 42:10.560]  it's so sick and this guy is an idiot
[42:10.560 --> 42:12.560]  and the people at the press conference totally ignored it
[42:12.560 --> 42:14.560]  I feel like it is
[42:14.560 --> 42:16.560]  we know the Gulf of Tonkin was staged
[42:16.560 --> 42:19.560]  so we know that governments allow attacks to happen
[42:19.560 --> 42:23.560]  we know that governments sometimes actually stage attacks
[42:23.560 --> 42:25.560]  so in a lot of cases they open the door
[42:25.560 --> 42:27.560]  that's what 9-11 Truth is saying
[42:27.560 --> 42:30.560]  you're making some very serious allegations against the US government
[42:30.560 --> 42:34.560]  they stage attack they allow them to occur in the United States against US
[42:34.560 --> 42:35.560]  let's declassify
[42:35.560 --> 42:36.560]  what?
[42:36.560 --> 42:38.560]  no what evidence do you have to support any of that?
[42:38.560 --> 42:42.560]  well Gulf of Tonkin is very very well documented
[42:42.560 --> 42:44.560]  what are you talking about hold on
[42:44.560 --> 42:47.560]  it's an army field manuals to stage false flag attacks
[42:47.560 --> 42:49.560]  declassified 2004
[42:49.560 --> 42:52.560]  how dare us say government might ever let terrorists attack us
[42:52.560 --> 42:55.560]  or might provocateur them even though it's in the New York Times
[42:55.560 --> 42:57.560]  and associated press and well known
[42:57.560 --> 43:00.560]  how dare us
[43:00.560 --> 43:04.560]  how dare you say I had sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky
[43:04.560 --> 43:07.560]  how dare you how dare you
[43:07.560 --> 43:08.560]  you're like what do you like Saddam?
[43:08.560 --> 43:10.560]  no I don't like fake wars
[43:10.560 --> 43:12.560]  blaming a country for 9-11 that wasn't involved
[43:12.560 --> 43:15.560]  yes this is the same guy who has been selling the idea that the massacre
[43:15.560 --> 43:17.560]  at Sandy Hook Elementary School
[43:17.560 --> 43:19.560]  and the massacre at Aurora Colorado
[43:19.560 --> 43:21.560]  were actually fake
[43:21.560 --> 43:23.560]  they were faked as an excuse to take away our guns
[43:23.560 --> 43:27.560]  and enslave us to the giant wasps who have beneath the UN building
[43:27.560 --> 43:28.560]  or whatever
[43:28.560 --> 43:30.560]  the same guy who says the Boston bombing was also fake
[43:30.560 --> 43:32.560]  it was faked for political purposes
[43:32.560 --> 43:35.560]  the same guy who says he doesn't believe the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster
[43:35.560 --> 43:36.560]  actually happened
[43:36.560 --> 43:39.560]  doesn't believe there was actually an Oklahoma City bombing
[43:45.560 --> 43:47.560]  if you like Info Wars
[43:47.560 --> 43:49.560]  which is a show hosted by a man named Alex Jones
[43:49.560 --> 43:52.560]  if you like Glenn Beck and you like Alex Jones
[43:52.560 --> 43:54.560]  who says we faked the moon landing
[43:54.560 --> 43:57.560]  so that's a sample of that documentary
[43:57.560 --> 43:59.560]  you can see the entire documentary
[43:59.560 --> 44:01.560]  again at info wars.com
[44:01.560 --> 44:04.560]  Alex Jones versus the mainstream media
[44:04.560 --> 44:06.560]  you know when I look at that
[44:06.560 --> 44:09.560]  I have to ask why are they protesting too much
[44:09.560 --> 44:11.560]  I mean thanks they protest too much
[44:11.560 --> 44:13.560]  it's really a shoot the messenger
[44:13.560 --> 44:16.560]  ad hominem attack just repeating over and over again
[44:16.560 --> 44:18.560]  conspiracy theorist conspiracy theorist
[44:18.560 --> 44:20.560]  but when you look at this documentary
[44:20.560 --> 44:23.560]  you realize just how broad and continuous
[44:23.560 --> 44:25.560]  this attack has been from various people
[44:25.560 --> 44:27.560]  like Piers Morgan says what concerns him
[44:27.560 --> 44:30.560]  is the growing influence of Info Wars
[44:30.560 --> 44:32.560]  and I guess maybe it concerns Piers Morgan
[44:32.560 --> 44:34.560]  of his shrinking influence
[44:34.560 --> 44:36.560]  which basically disappeared
[44:36.560 --> 44:39.560]  and he disappeared and slinked back to the British Isles
[44:39.560 --> 44:41.560]  where he came from
[44:41.560 --> 44:42.560]  now
[44:42.560 --> 44:46.560]  in another vein last week there was a car show here
[44:46.560 --> 44:48.560]  in the Austin area the Lone Star car show
[44:48.560 --> 44:50.560]  of course this is one of the biggest
[44:50.560 --> 44:53.560]  best modified classic car shows
[44:53.560 --> 44:55.560]  I wanted to talk to the people there
[44:55.560 --> 44:58.560]  and see if they are really aware
[44:58.560 --> 45:01.560]  of how transportation especially
[45:01.560 --> 45:03.560]  the freedom that we've had with the automobile
[45:03.560 --> 45:06.560]  were they aware of how it was going to be changing
[45:06.560 --> 45:09.560]  were they aware of how quickly it was going to be coming
[45:09.560 --> 45:11.560]  and of course this can all be dismissed as
[45:11.560 --> 45:13.560]  10 foil hat conspiracy
[45:13.560 --> 45:16.560]  because there's not anybody really trying to take away your car
[45:16.560 --> 45:19.560]  not anybody trying to control your movements
[45:19.560 --> 45:23.560]  turn you into a slave that they tax and track everywhere
[45:23.560 --> 45:25.560]  that's what these black boxes are about
[45:25.560 --> 45:29.560]  we've got a video up on the Alex Jones YouTube channel
[45:29.560 --> 45:32.560]  black box vanishing point of freedom
[45:32.560 --> 45:34.560]  you need to understand that they put black boxes
[45:34.560 --> 45:37.560]  in all the new cars beginning last fall
[45:37.560 --> 45:39.560]  it's now required in every car manufacturer
[45:39.560 --> 45:41.560]  it is going to track you
[45:41.560 --> 45:44.560]  it is going to be used to tax you
[45:44.560 --> 45:47.560]  it's going to control your movement
[45:47.560 --> 45:50.560]  and it's only going to get worse and this is coming very very rapidly
[45:50.560 --> 45:53.560]  I wanted to get a pulse of the people because you know so many times
[45:53.560 --> 45:56.560]  we're all living our lives especially productive people
[45:56.560 --> 45:58.560]  like these guys I talked to
[45:58.560 --> 46:00.560]  they're people who grew up as gear heads
[46:00.560 --> 46:02.560]  working on their cars
[46:02.560 --> 46:04.560]  maybe they don't understand where this is coming from
[46:04.560 --> 46:06.560]  so let's take a look at this report
[46:06.560 --> 46:08.560]  black box vanishing point
[46:08.560 --> 46:14.560]  music
[46:14.560 --> 46:17.560]  we're here at the Lone Star Roundup in Austin, Texas
[46:17.560 --> 46:20.560]  this is their 14th year here
[46:20.560 --> 46:23.560]  one of the biggest and best classic car shows in the country
[46:23.560 --> 46:26.560]  all the cars here are 1963 or older
[46:26.560 --> 46:29.560]  that means that they're at least 52 years old
[46:29.560 --> 46:31.560]  you're going to see a lot of different changes here
[46:31.560 --> 46:34.560]  but it's also a reflection of America's love of the car
[46:34.560 --> 46:36.560]  the car culture and what it brings to us
[46:36.560 --> 46:38.560]  independence and freedom
[46:38.560 --> 46:40.560]  so we're going to talk to some of the people here
[46:40.560 --> 46:42.560]  and see what they think about the near future
[46:42.560 --> 46:44.560]  where drivers are banned from the highway
[46:44.560 --> 46:46.560]  driving a car
[46:46.560 --> 46:49.560]  there's something about driving a classic car with the windows down
[46:49.560 --> 46:51.560]  you don't even have to have the radio on
[46:51.560 --> 46:53.560]  you can hear the motor, you can't beat it
[46:53.560 --> 46:55.560]  I'd get rid of it
[46:55.560 --> 46:58.560]  my wife almost before I'd get rid of some of my cars
[46:58.560 --> 47:01.560]  it's original 1964
[47:01.560 --> 47:04.560]  Woody Gilmore car out of California
[47:04.560 --> 47:06.560]  from this little on I've been
[47:06.560 --> 47:08.560]  taking motors apart
[47:08.560 --> 47:11.560]  taking Volkswagen apart when I was like 8 years old
[47:11.560 --> 47:14.560]  so it's almost a lifestyle
[47:14.560 --> 47:16.560]  I wouldn't know what to do without cars
[47:16.560 --> 47:20.560]  I've been messing with them ever since I was 14 years old
[47:20.560 --> 47:22.560]  the only thing that's not original
[47:22.560 --> 47:24.560]  is the motor and the body panel
[47:24.560 --> 47:27.560]  but it is an original 1963 top fuel car
[47:27.560 --> 47:29.560]  that's a beautiful car
[47:29.560 --> 47:32.560]  it's Tweety Bird, it was gone for 50 years
[47:32.560 --> 47:37.560]  and he sold it to pay for his first child being born in 1962
[47:37.560 --> 47:40.560]  and we were at a swap meet
[47:40.560 --> 47:42.560]  and a guy answered his cell phone and says
[47:42.560 --> 47:44.560]  we need to move the model A out of the garage and Tweety
[47:44.560 --> 47:46.560]  and I go oh my gosh
[47:46.560 --> 47:48.560]  so I tapped him on the shoulder and I said
[47:48.560 --> 47:50.560]  Tweety didn't happen to be a yellow 32 does it
[47:50.560 --> 47:53.560]  and he goes yes, the guy says I own your car
[47:53.560 --> 47:55.560]  Have you ever seen this, Google's self-driving car?
[47:55.560 --> 47:57.560]  Yeah, no steering wheel, no brakes
[47:57.560 --> 47:59.560]  would you want to ride in that car?
[47:59.560 --> 48:01.560]  No, I gotta have some control over what I'm in
[48:01.560 --> 48:03.560]  Google's self-driving car?
[48:03.560 --> 48:06.560]  No steering wheel, no brakes
[48:06.560 --> 48:09.560]  I spent 33 years in the United States Air Force
[48:09.560 --> 48:13.560]  so I'm familiar with all navigation systems
[48:13.560 --> 48:18.560]  I've been in places with GBS that took me in the wrong direction
[48:18.560 --> 48:21.560]  How's that computer going to react when a deer jumps out in front of you
[48:21.560 --> 48:24.560]  or something falls out of the sky and you can see it coming down
[48:24.560 --> 48:26.560]  maybe it's out of its range
[48:26.560 --> 48:29.560]  Have you seen the Google car that has no steering wheel and no brakes?
[48:29.560 --> 48:32.560]  Yeah, I looked at it last week actually
[48:32.560 --> 48:34.560]  How would you feel to get in a car like that?
[48:34.560 --> 48:39.560]  I don't know, I guess I wouldn't feel comfortable at all
[48:39.560 --> 48:42.560]  What do you think about autonomous driving cars?
[48:42.560 --> 48:45.560]  Cars where you don't have a steering wheel or brakes
[48:45.560 --> 48:48.560]  that they're talking about using that extensively
[48:48.560 --> 48:51.560]  I think I may see it when I'm an old man, maybe but
[48:51.560 --> 48:53.560]  I still think humans are going to be driving
[48:53.560 --> 48:56.560]  and humans are going to be in control of the firm
[48:56.560 --> 48:59.560]  I know it rests with my life
[48:59.560 --> 49:03.560]  Do you think that they will be driving eventually on the road?
[49:03.560 --> 49:07.560]  I wouldn't be surprised eventually, but I don't see it anytime soon in our lifetime
[49:07.560 --> 49:10.560]  or at least not as long as I'm driving
[49:10.560 --> 49:13.560]  Hopefully it's after my lifetime or our lifetime
[49:13.560 --> 49:16.560]  but my personal opinion, I don't see it happening anytime soon
[49:16.560 --> 49:21.560]  Ford I think has just put out a thing that will keep you from speeding
[49:21.560 --> 49:24.560]  so it will basically break your car if you go above the speed limit
[49:24.560 --> 49:27.560]  and slow you down
[49:27.560 --> 49:29.560]  I don't like it, but I don't drive Ford's either
[49:29.560 --> 49:33.560]  Autonomous driving cars, if the government is tracking every mile that we drive
[49:33.560 --> 49:36.560]  and taxing us on every mile that we drive, how do you feel about that?
[49:36.560 --> 49:38.560]  I do not like it
[49:38.560 --> 49:41.560]  Okay, they're charging everywhere it's turning into a toll road, right?
[49:41.560 --> 49:44.560]  And they got the easy tag, how long is it going to be before they go
[49:44.560 --> 49:49.560]  Okay, you went through toll number three at this time
[49:49.560 --> 49:51.560]  and you went through toll number four at this time
[49:51.560 --> 49:54.560]  Well, you went 90 miles an hour from here to there
[49:54.560 --> 49:56.560]  and they're going to send you a ticket in the mail
[49:56.560 --> 49:58.560]  They're putting black boxes in all of the new cars
[49:58.560 --> 50:01.560]  probably retrofit it back to any of the cars that are on the street
[50:01.560 --> 50:05.560]  that's going to measure how fast you accelerate, how fast you corner
[50:05.560 --> 50:08.560]  They're going to give that information to the insurance companies
[50:08.560 --> 50:10.560]  What do you think about that and the government?
[50:10.560 --> 50:12.560]  I don't like that
[50:12.560 --> 50:14.560]  I don't have one on my car
[50:14.560 --> 50:16.560]  The human factor needs to be there
[50:16.560 --> 50:18.560]  You can't have everything computerized
[50:18.560 --> 50:22.560]  The CEO of Uber has said that once they get self-driving cars
[50:22.560 --> 50:24.560]  once they get autonomous driving cars
[50:24.560 --> 50:26.560]  car ownership will go away, that's their goal
[50:26.560 --> 50:28.560]  What do you think about that?
[50:28.560 --> 50:30.560]  They're going to have a hard time with that, I think
[50:30.560 --> 50:34.560]  I mean, people, I think a lot of people are getting fed up with the
[50:34.560 --> 50:38.560]  infringement on our freedoms with the spying and all this kind of stuff
[50:38.560 --> 50:43.560]  You know, it's like, why are you spying on us, listening to my phone call
[50:43.560 --> 50:45.560]  and you're going to tell me I can't drive my car
[50:45.560 --> 50:47.560]  and I'm not going to have the freedom to go where I want to go
[50:47.560 --> 50:50.560]  Absolutely, right now, you can see the rest of that report on
[50:50.560 --> 50:53.560]  infowars.com and the Alex Jones YouTube channel
[50:53.560 --> 50:57.560]  It's amazing to see how quickly things are changing
[50:57.560 --> 51:00.560]  and even the young people didn't think it was going to happen in their life
[51:00.560 --> 51:02.560]  freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates
[51:02.560 --> 51:06.560]  while our US politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor
[51:06.560 --> 51:08.560]  Does that sound right to you?

[53:48.560 --> 53:51.560]  When you're miles away, security is a mindset

[53:54.560 --> 53:56.560]  Be vigilant, but not fearful
[53:56.560 --> 54:20.560]  FakeTV.com
[54:20.560 --> 54:28.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, the symbol of the automobile is the symbol of modern 20th century Americana
[54:28.560 --> 54:29.560]  that changed the world
[54:29.560 --> 54:33.560]  We were the country of George Washington, Babe Ruth, and the 57 Chevy
[54:33.560 --> 54:36.560]  We were exceptional
[54:36.560 --> 54:40.560]  And that's why the globalists had to colonize the United States with their spies and agents
[54:40.560 --> 54:43.560]  to take over the great engine of freedom
[54:43.560 --> 54:45.560]  It wasn't perfect, but compared to other nations
[54:45.560 --> 54:50.560]  It was the capital engine of human freedom, exploration, invention
[54:50.560 --> 54:54.560]  We were taken over at our great scientific brain trust
[54:54.560 --> 55:01.560]  A technological elite in control of the military industrial complex took control
[55:01.560 --> 55:05.560]  We should do a special report, we played it before, but with Eisenhower's full speech
[55:05.560 --> 55:11.560]  21 minutes long is farewell address in 1961 where he says beware the military industrial complex
[55:11.560 --> 55:18.560]  But two lines before that, he describes that a technological elite is already taking over
[55:18.560 --> 55:21.560]  through the military industrial complex
[55:21.560 --> 55:25.560]  and directing human development and destiny
[55:25.560 --> 55:26.560]  and destiny
[55:26.560 --> 55:32.560]  And he was an establishment guy, but the plans brought to him by the Eugenicists were so evil
[55:32.560 --> 55:37.560]  that he had to speak out against fire L. L. Limitzer, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others
[55:37.560 --> 55:41.560]  who wanted a nuclear war then to bring in the scientific dictatorship
[55:41.560 --> 55:46.560]  The global cataclysm to give the United States the excuse to emerge from underground bunkers
[55:46.560 --> 55:49.560]  for Dr. Strange Love and all that's about
[55:49.560 --> 55:51.560]  turned into fiction by Stanley Kubrick
[55:51.560 --> 55:56.560]  to bring about the giant cataclysm and out of that crisis, American ingenuity
[55:56.560 --> 56:01.560]  would then found this eugenics-based psycho club
[56:01.560 --> 56:05.560]  They're coming for your cars, they're coming for your children, they're coming for your private property
[56:05.560 --> 56:07.560]  They're coming for your guns
[56:07.560 --> 56:08.560]  We told everybody
[56:08.560 --> 56:13.560]  They're putting tracker boxes and taxation systems in all the cars
[56:13.560 --> 56:15.560]  10, 15 years ago we warned you
[56:15.560 --> 56:18.560]  16, 17 years ago, but they phased them in
[56:18.560 --> 56:20.560]  All over, you pick with us
[56:20.560 --> 56:23.560]  When they finally pull the trigger on the National Society of Control Grid
[56:23.560 --> 56:25.560]  it's not going to be incremental anymore
[56:25.560 --> 56:30.560]  It's going to be overnight when they engage this system
[56:30.560 --> 56:32.560]  That's why they're banning cash
[56:32.560 --> 56:35.560]  That's why they're restricting it, that's why JP Morgan's going after it
[56:35.560 --> 56:37.560]  It's why Citibank says get rid of it
[56:37.560 --> 56:40.560]  because they want to track and control everything you do
[56:40.560 --> 56:44.560]  so they can turn off your digital cards and your biometric signature
[56:44.560 --> 56:46.560]  and you won't be able to buy or sell
[56:46.560 --> 56:48.560]  and this is their word, it's not the Bible
[56:48.560 --> 56:50.560]  So for those of you that hate Christ and hate the Bible
[56:50.560 --> 56:52.560]  hey, you don't have to deal with
[56:52.560 --> 56:54.560]  deal with the globalists themselves
[56:54.560 --> 56:57.560]  saying they will track and control every human movement
[56:57.560 --> 57:00.560]  everything you do at every level
[57:00.560 --> 57:02.560]  through these systems
[57:02.560 --> 57:04.560]  as soon as they're in place and you trust them
[57:04.560 --> 57:06.560]  and it's all you know
[57:06.560 --> 57:08.560]  That's why they're waging war on farmers markets
[57:08.560 --> 57:11.560]  lemonade stands, small machine shops
[57:11.560 --> 57:13.560]  the Amish
[57:13.560 --> 57:15.560]  communities, people coming together
[57:15.560 --> 57:17.560]  They want you at big box stores
[57:17.560 --> 57:20.560]  That's why they're trying to ban with legislation
[57:20.560 --> 57:22.560]  that we covered yesterday that David covered
[57:22.560 --> 57:25.560]  That's why they're trying to ban working on your own car
[57:25.560 --> 57:29.560]  or going in and removing the kill switches
[57:29.560 --> 57:31.560]  or the car that you've already paid for
[57:31.560 --> 57:33.560]  that you don't own money on anymore
[57:33.560 --> 57:35.560]  All the cars for 12 years in the US
[57:35.560 --> 57:38.560]  under federal regulations have kill switches in them
[57:38.560 --> 57:40.560]  That's why repossession is not an issue anymore
[57:40.560 --> 57:42.560]  because they just turn your car off
[57:42.560 --> 57:44.560]  What about once you own it?
[57:44.560 --> 57:46.560]  Well you don't really own it, it's got kill switches in it
[57:46.560 --> 57:48.560]  So there's the internet, so there's your toaster
[57:48.560 --> 57:51.560]  so there's your microwave oven, so there's your smart TV
[57:51.560 --> 57:54.560]  everything, the head of the CIA three years ago
[57:54.560 --> 57:56.560]  said this
[57:56.560 --> 57:59.560]  We told you 15 years ago, because MIT was reporting
[57:59.560 --> 58:02.560]  All they can do is call us tinfoil hats
[58:02.560 --> 58:05.560]  and hope that you don't investigate this total plan
[58:05.560 --> 58:08.560]  We've got to stop it, we've got to speak out against it
[58:08.560 --> 58:10.560]  and regardless, if it is the beach to the end of the world
[58:10.560 --> 58:13.560]  and all the rest of it, it's our job to warn people
[58:13.560 --> 58:17.560]  so their soul, at the end, before they die
[58:17.560 --> 58:20.560]  converts to reality, admits the grave lie
[58:20.560 --> 58:23.560]  breaks the conditioning, breaks the trans
[58:23.560 --> 58:26.560]  breaks the delusion, and becomes one with God's consciousness
[58:26.560 --> 58:27.560]  one with Christ
[58:27.560 --> 58:30.560]  The enemy wants to keep you an artificial construct
[58:30.560 --> 58:33.560]  a false reality, keeps you in deception until you die
[58:33.560 --> 58:36.560]  so that you have no knowledge, spiritually, of the wider universe
[58:36.560 --> 58:38.560]  and God's great plan
[58:38.560 --> 58:41.560]  so that you're walled off and are a child of the devil
[58:41.560 --> 58:43.560]  on this tiny little planet that he's hijacked
[58:43.560 --> 58:46.560]  This is the epic level decision
[58:46.560 --> 58:48.560]  You have to make, we're going to break
[58:48.560 --> 58:50.560]  God bless you
[58:50.560 --> 58:53.560]  You can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying
[58:53.560 --> 58:55.560]  what I have found to be the best tasting
[58:55.560 --> 58:57.560]  100% organic coffee on the planet
[58:57.560 --> 59:00.560]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come
[59:00.560 --> 59:02.560]  from the high mountains of southern Mexico
[59:02.560 --> 59:05.560]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown
[59:05.560 --> 59:06.560]  Arabica beans
[59:06.560 --> 59:09.560]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans
[59:09.560 --> 59:11.560]  in a highly customized blend
[59:11.560 --> 59:14.560]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend
[59:14.560 --> 59:17.560]  100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com
[59:17.560 --> 59:20.560]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours
[59:20.560 --> 59:22.560]  without the headaches and heartburn
[59:22.560 --> 59:24.560]  that so many other coffees give me personally
[59:24.560 --> 59:26.560]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee
[59:26.560 --> 59:28.560]  and it's taken us years to secure connections
[59:28.560 --> 59:31.560]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers
[59:31.560 --> 59:34.560]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two
[59:34.560 --> 59:36.560]  and I don't think you're going to be disappointed
[59:36.560 --> 59:37.560]  Available in original
[59:37.560 --> 59:39.560]  or with our immune support infusion blend
[59:39.560 --> 59:41.560]  You will be supporting a free press
[59:41.560 --> 59:44.560]  all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup
[59:44.560 --> 59:45.560]  of my favorite coffee
[59:45.560 --> 59:48.560]  Available at infowarslife.com
[59:50.560 --> 59:54.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.560]  Big Brother
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.560]  Mainstream media
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.560]  Government cover-ups
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.560]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.560]  Well, so does he
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:19.560]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.560]  Alex Jones
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.560]  You want answers?
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.560]  Well, so does he
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.560]  I'm going to finish up here
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.560]  and throw the baton back to David Knight
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.560]  and then I'll be live in studio
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.560]  this Sunday at Lord Willing
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.560]  4-6PM Central and back all next week
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.560]  in studio
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.560]  But I tell you, we built an amazing team of crew
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.560]  and researchers and host up there
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.560]  and so I thank God every moment for everybody
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.560]  Here is the final equation
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.560]  Here's the bottom of the rabbit hole
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.560]  There's a war on for your soul
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.560]  a war on for your consciousness
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.560]  a war on for your mind
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:53.560]  a war to artificially direct your brain
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.560]  to direct your spirit
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.560]  instead of the other way around
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:00.560]  They are assuming a technological takeover
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.560]  a technocracy
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.560]  and they've rolled out the trojan horse
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.560]  of technology that's neutral
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.560]  and they've left it pretty much alone
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.560]  to get us all addicted
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.560]  this is in their own words
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.560]  and now that we're on the line
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.560]  they're about to plant the hook
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.560]  the worms in our mouth
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.560]  the hook has not gone through our mouth yet
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.560]  but they are about to pull back on that rod
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:26.560]  and they are about to plant that hook
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.560]  Did we lose Alex?
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.560]  I think we just lost him
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.560]  Yeah
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.560]  Well, Alex was going to come back to us
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.560]  and I had something that we saw
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.560]  on one of these videos
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.560]  talking about the car companies
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.560]  asserting ownership over everything that you have
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.560]  This is a comment from someone called
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:50.560]  that went with MPG827 on YouTube
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.560]  He said, my friend had a BMW
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.560]  and he had to put in a battery
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.560]  so he did it himself
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.560]  I mean, I don't even consider that
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:57.560]  working on your own car
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.560]  He said it went dead after a day
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.560]  He called the BMW dealership
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:02.560]  They took a look at him
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.560]  You got Alex back?
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.560]  Okay, go ahead Alex
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:05.560]  I'll finish this story later
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.560]  No, no, no, sorry David
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.560]  I'm going to get off right now
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.560]  It's just people need to understand something
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.560]  We're under attack by mainstream media
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.560]  by government
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.560]  by White House Run Media Matters
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:16.560]  by no exaggeration
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.560]  probably ten major newspapers
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.560]  a day
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.560]  a magazine a week
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.560]  nightly news shows once a week
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.560]  everything from Nightline
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.560]  to the Daily Show
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:28.560]  because we're over the target
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.560]  and I'm not worried about me
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.560]  I'm worried about this mission failing
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:33.560]  Folks, the reason we're under attack
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.560]  is we know what we're talking about
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.560]  and the online trolls and all of it
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.560]  because they're scared to death
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.560]  Let's cut Alex Jones out of the equation
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.560]  or David Nyer, Jakari Jackson
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.560]  or Darren McBreen
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.560]  or Leanne McAdoo
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.560]  or any of our great crew
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.560]  All of this is happening
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.560]  What are you going to do about it?
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.560]  The globalists are coming in
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.560]  to micromanage and destroy your free will
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.560]  They're openly saying
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.560]  they're going to, as I told people
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.560]  again, 15 years ago
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.560]  start taxing you by the mile
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.560]  claiming that you're not a safe driver
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.560]  and then finally
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.560]  machines love to do everything for us
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.560]  They're building a world where humans
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:09.560]  won't be needed
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.560]  not where we empower humanity
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.560]  not where we build a world for humanity
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.560]  but where we say machines are better
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.560]  day one, let them control everything
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.560]  but the calculators do the math
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.560]  but the cars do the driving
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.560]  and we'll all just watch football
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.560]  That's what Bill Joyce, 16 years ago
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.560]  in Wired Magazine, wrote about
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.560]  the decision has been made
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.560]  to give us bread and circus
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.560]  at a meeting with 200 top levels
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.560]  The decision has been made
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.560]  Listen to me folks
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.560]  to entertain you to death
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.560]  anesthetize, dump down
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.560]  rubbed out and sterilize you
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.560]  so humans just phase out
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.560]  and the elite merge with machines
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:49.560]  Now, again, you're living in a science fiction movie
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.560]  What are you going to do about it?
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.560]  The reason you feel empty is because
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:53.560]  you bought into the world system
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.560]  I'm talking to a new listener
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.560]  You bought into the idea
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.560]  you can only be empowered
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.560]  by going deeper into the system
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.560]  the system will not empower you
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.560]  resisting the system
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.560]  building a real system based on
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.560]  human liberty and freedom
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.560]  and the golden rule is the only way
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:09.560]  I'm going to throw it back to David Knight
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.560]  and as I said, I'll be back live this Sunday
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.560]  Great job crew
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.560]  Thank you Alex
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.560]  Yeah, I want to continue with this story
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.560]  because this is an amazing comment
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.560]  I saw on YouTube
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.560]  Again, this guy reported that he had a friend
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.560]  with a BMW
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.560]  had to replace the battery
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.560]  he put it in himself
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.560]  after a day it went off
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.560]  So he called the dealer
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:30.560]  and they said, you've got an aftermarket battery
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.560]  They said it's unregistered
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.560]  So what they did was they wirelessly
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.560]  over Wi-Fi
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.560]  they registered his battery
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.560]  and charged him $150
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.560]  more than it would have cost him
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.560]  to probably buy a battery from them
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.560]  You don't have freedom
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.560]  You don't own anything
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.560]  just GM said
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.560]  we can't conflate ownership of a vehicle
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.560]  with ownership of the underlying computer software
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.560]  they're going to do it by copyright
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.560]  they're going to assert they own everything
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.560]  Stay with us
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.560]  Paul Joseph Watson
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.560]  There's no doubt that our country
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:05.560]  is in serious trouble right now
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.560]  and if you're wondering how on earth
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.560]  we ever got in this situation
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.560]  well I'll tell you how
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.560]  when the Democrats showed their true colors
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.560]  you got angry and you elected Republicans
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:19.560]  and then when the Republicans showed their true colors
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.560]  you got angry and elected Democrats
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.560]  and when anyone suggested to you
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.560]  that both parties were corrupt
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.560]  and that neither side were looking out
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.560]  for your best interest
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.560]  you acted like they were crazy
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.560]  but the real definition of crazy
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:38.560]  is doing the same thing over and over again
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.560]  and expecting different results
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.560]  that's why it is vitally important
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.560]  that you wake up America
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.560]  and break the matrix
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.560]  infowars.com
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.560]  prisonplanet.tv
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:52.560]  and the Alex Jones show
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.560]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.560]  Another major health threat
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.560]  this one in Toledo, Ohio
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.560]  where everybody in the entire city
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.560]  has been told not to drink the water
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:07.560]  Ohio governor declaring a state of emergency
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.560]  Did you know that the average person
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.560]  uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.560]  every single day
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.560]  If there's a water emergency
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.560]  will you be prepared?
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.560]  Panicked residents forming long lines
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.560]  throughout the day
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.560]  We're here in a supermarket in Toledo
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.560]  you can see the shelves empty
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.560]  where water once was
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.560]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.560]  you must have access to safe clean water
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.560]  water which will not be available
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.560]  at your local grocery store
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.560]  There's a mad dash on right now

[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.560]  deep behind enemy lines
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.560]  the information war continues
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.560]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.560]  We've just heard from Alex Jones
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.560]  the last segment explaining to us
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.560]  where this is all going with these black boxes
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.560]  You know, I look at this and quite frankly
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.560]  I think that's a very good metaphor
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.560]  for what our government has become
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.560]  In engineering terms, we always used to talk about
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.560]  black boxes as this closed system
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.560]  where you couldn't see how it worked
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.560]  It might have a function
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.560]  but you could not look at the internal parts of it
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.560]  That's what our government has become
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.560]  It's become this closed system
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.560]  that we can't examine
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.560]  And I think these black boxes
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.560]  are now becoming as we've got in our cars
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.560]  They're like the black boxes you saw on airplanes
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.560]  where basically they would record and track
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.560]  everything the pilots did
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.560]  That's another aspect of our government
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.560]  So not only can you not see into it
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.560]  but it records and tracks everything that you do
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.560]  and that's what they're doing on your cars
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.560]  so that it can track and tax you
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.560]  I think that's what we ought to call them
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.560]  Instead of a black box, we ought to call them track and tax
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.560]  That's the true function of these things
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.560]  We're just getting honest with this
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.560]  I think language means something
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.560]  We're going to go to Paul Joseph Watson
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.560]  Just before we do though, I want to let you know
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.560]  that we've got a special in InfowarsLife.com
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.560]  This month you can get
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.560]  two bottles of Survival Shield X2
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.560]  That's our nascent iodine
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.560]  And you can get one bottle of fluoride shield
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.560]  for free
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.560]  Now we know that fluoride lowers IQ
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.560]  We've seen that in tests
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.560]  We know that many countries
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.560]  like Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.560]  the water
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.560]  80% of the cities in the US however
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:48.560]  are fluoridated and we cannot get them
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.560]  to listen to us
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.560]  So one of the things you can do is try to filter it out of your water
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.560]  You can also
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.560]  when you're at home, but you can also
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.560]  use fluoride shield
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.560]  For those times when you're away from home
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.560]  you're going to get it in things that you drink
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.560]  If you drink anything that's bottled
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.560]  you're probably going to get fluoride
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.560]  because it is so pervasive in the United States
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.560]  So for this month only
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.560]  you can get the Survival Shield X2 bottles
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.560]  Again, that's at InfowarsLife.com
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.560]  and we have 50% off of
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.560]  Silver Bullet
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.560]  $15 savings per bottle
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.560]  Let's go to Paul Joseph Watson in the UK
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.560]  Paul, you've got a story up about
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.560]  the Southern Poverty Law Center
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.560]  Attacking Oathkeepers
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.560]  Attacking Us
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.560]  Attacking Gary Franchi's
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.560]  Operation Next News
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.560]  These are a bunch of lawyers you'd think that
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.560]  maybe they would appreciate
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.560]  that you should have their day in court
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.560]  that there should be a due process
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.560]  that there is a chain of title
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.560]  on these minds and yet
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.560]  they don't. They simply
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.560]  move this into their rhetoric
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.560]  of hate trying to
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.560]  divide us, trying to demonize people
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.560]  who want to have those things
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.560]  who want to have due process
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.560]  who want to have property rights
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.560]  Your comments, Paul
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.560]  Well, the SPLC
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.560]  as we've documented for years
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.560]  is a civic group which poses
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.560]  as a civil rights organization
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.560]  while peddling hate
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.560]  in the name of stopping hate
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.560]  So they came out with this
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.560]  really quite amateurish article
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.560]  yesterday about the
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.560]  sugar pine mine dispute
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.560]  in Oregon with a headline
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.560]  Oathkeepers descend upon
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.560]  Oregon with dreams of
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.560]  armed confrontation over
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.560]  mining dispute and what's
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.560]  amazing just as a kickoff
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.560]  is the content of the article
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.560]  disproves
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.560]  the headline in the first
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.560]  three paragraphs
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.560]  In the third paragraph
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.560]  they quote Oathkeepers
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.560]  who put out a statement last week
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.560]  which said quote
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.560]  this is not a standoff with the BLM
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.560]  we are not promoting
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.560]  any confrontation with BLM
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.560]  this is a security operation
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.560]  for the protection of constitutional rights
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.560]  So in the third paragraph
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.560]  Oathkeepers say
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.560]  they're not promoting armed confrontation
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.560]  yet the headline of this piece
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.560]  by the SPLC
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.560]  says they're quote dreaming of armed confrontation
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.560]  then again
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.560]  later on in the article they quote
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.560]  Joseph Rice the security coordinator
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.560]  for Josephine County chapter
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.560]  of the Oathkeepers
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.560]  who stated quote
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.560]  if you're on a fringe element
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.560]  and if you're here to protest or provoke a reaction
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.560]  with the federal government
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.560]  I do not need you
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.560]  so they actually quote the Oathkeepers
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.560]  on two separate occasions
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.560]  saying they're not there to promote
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.560]  or to provoke violence
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.560]  yet simultaneously
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.560]  demonizing the Oathkeepers
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.560]  and saying that they're trying to provoke violence
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.560]  so
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.560]  they even need me to write
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.560]  an article in response
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.560]  they discredit and disprove their own premise
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.560]  with the Oathkeepers
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.560]  saying they're trying to provoke violence
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.560]  and disprove their own premise
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.560]  within their own article
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.560]  well they basically
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.560]  just if you look at about the first
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.560]  five or six words of the article
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.560]  what began as a paper dispute
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.560]  if you look at that interview that I had with
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.560]  a spokesperson from the Glees Mining District
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.560]  and they put that in their article
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.560]  but of course I think people just look at these headlines
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.560]  they don't read the SPLC articles
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.560]  they don't watch the videos that are embedded there
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.560]  they just comment at the bottom
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.560]  based on their comments
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.560]  they read the article or they watched the video
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.560]  it did not begin as a paper dispute
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.560]  and of course we go through that in the video
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.560]  but let's talk about how the SPLC began
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.560]  you know this is a guy
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.560]  Morris D's who set out the civil rights
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.560]  movement of the 1960's
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.560]  except for the fact
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.560]  that he was in it at the very beginning
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.560]  he worked for George Wallace
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.560]  and he also got involved
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.560]  in a particular case
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.560]  with the KKK
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.560]  beat protesters, burned their bus
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.560]  he defended the Ku Klux Klan
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.560]  and he made enough money off of that
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.560]  as equivalent to what the
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.560]  median family income was at that time
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.560]  and then he set out
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.560]  the entire civil rights movement and he didn't get involved again
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.560]  until the
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.560]  1970's
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.560]  when he came back into politics
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.560]  with George McGovern
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.560]  in the meantime he and his partner were out making
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.560]  millions of dollars
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.560]  as many people on the left have criticized him
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.560]  and you can see that picture now if you're looking at that
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.560]  at the bottom that's being kicked
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.560]  that was not his
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.560]  the person he's representing
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.560]  he's representing that guy right there doing the kicking
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.560]  the white supremacist
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.560]  the KKK guy
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.560]  those were the guys that he defended
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.560]  and then he got back involved in politics
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.560]  after making millions in direct mail marketing
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.560]  he got involved with the McGovern campaign
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.560]  and got a mailing list of
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.560]  700,000 people and then came back in
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.560]  as a champion of civil liberties
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.560]  absolute baloney
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.560]  this guy is just profiting
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:54.560]  as I point out in that video
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.560]  his whole purpose seems to be to
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.560]  profit from hate and of course he's
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.560]  stuck people on the family research council
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.560]  basically the guy that went in to shoot up people
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.560]  of the family research council said that he was inspired
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.560]  by the SPLC
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.560]  that was just a couple of years ago Paul
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.560]  yeah this is an organization
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.560]  headed by Morris D's
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.560]  that makes millions and millions
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.560]  of dollars a year
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.560]  in fact they make 20 million in profits
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.560]  they take in around 40 million
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.560]  and spend about 20 million
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.560]  in their venerable cause so they actually
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.560]  keep 20 million we can get into
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.560]  what they do with that later
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.560]  but their whole
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.560]  modus operandi is to demonize
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.560]  constitutionalist libertarians
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.560]  gun owners, patriots
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.560]  and portray them as violent
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.560]  domestic extremists and terror threats
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.560]  when as you mentioned
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:44.560]  in 2012 this guy
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.560]  Corkins who went into
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.560]  a family research council
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.560]  headquarters in Washington DC
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.560]  specifically with the aim
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.560]  of shooting the place up
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.560]  thankfully from what I remember
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.560]  a security guard stopped him from doing so
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.560]  that's right but he
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.560]  cited the SPLC
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.560]  as an inspiration
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.560]  for that shooting because they had
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.560]  listed the family research council
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:10.560]  as a hate organization
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.560]  they called it an anti-gay organization
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.560]  because they opposed gay marriage
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.560]  on their website
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.560]  two years previously
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.560]  which actually led to 22
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.560]  republican law makers
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.560]  taking out full spray
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.560]  full page ads in the Washington Post
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.560]  and the New York Times
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.560]  basically calling out the SPLC
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.560]  so what's dangerous about them Paul
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.560]  is not that they're inspiring a lone wolf
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.560]  shooter with hate but that they are
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:38.560]  being used by the federal government
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.560]  to push this narrative that the biggest
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.560]  threat to our country are people
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.560]  who are conservatives
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.560]  libertarians, Christians
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.560]  the Southern Poverty Law Center
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.560]  is what the FBI and the military use
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.560]  when they're indoctrinating law enforcement
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.560]  and the military
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.560]  that this is a training scenario
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.560]  that they're fighting for, that's what we've been talking about
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.560]  with this militarization of the police
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.560]  if you go back and look at these scenarios
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.560]  they're getting all their talking points from the SPLC
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:06.560]  the government loves to use them
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.560]  because they can pretend that this is some
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.560]  independent third party that's out there
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.560]  100% government propaganda but they are
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.560]  linked completely with the government
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.560]  in terms of putting this narrative out there
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.560]  that's where it's coming from
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.560]  Yeah and we documented that
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.560]  in a report entitled
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.560]  Confirmed No Supporting Evidence for DHS
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.560]  Right Wing Extremism Report
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.560]  This was a report put out in 2009
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.560]  by the Department of Homeland Security
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.560]  that again in a similar vein to the
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.560]  Mayak Report
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.560]  listed libertarians gun owners
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.560]  constitutionalists as domestic
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.560]  terror threats
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.560]  they got their information and we found this out
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.560]  after an independent political group
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.560]  called the Americans for Limited Government
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.560]  filed a Freedom of Information Act
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.560]  request to find out how
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.560]  the DHS had designated
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.560]  all these groups as quote
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.560]  hate groups and domestic extremists
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.560]  and the DHS responded
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.560]  by providing a list
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.560]  of about 50 URLs
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.560]  internet links
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.560]  that was the entire foundation of their report
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.560]  to demonize all these groups
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.560]  as extremists so they didn't
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.560]  do any statistical analysis
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.560]  they didn't interview any of these groups
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:16.560]  an agent went on the internet
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.560]  and scoured a few websites
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.560]  one of which was the SPLC
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.560]  and in fact
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.560]  11 of these 50 or so links
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.560]  also came from
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.560]  a fake news website
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.560]  that puts out hoax articles
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.560]  which are completely ridiculous
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.560]  called what does it mean
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.560]  they actually use the fake news website
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.560]  to create this huge right-wing extremism
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.560]  report so it just shows
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.560]  you the kind of company that
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:44.560]  the DHS and the SPLC
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.560]  keeps and then as you said
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.560]  they use that information as a kind of echo chamber
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.560]  back between the SPLC and the DHS
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.560]  to demonize all these
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.560]  groups as domestic extremists
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.560]  and it perfectly
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.560]  fits into their agenda which we've documented
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.560]  which is basically to
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.560]  malign anyone who doesn't
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.560]  espouse the same leftist
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.560]  viewpoints as the SPLC
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:08.560]  as dangerous domestic
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.560]  terror threat. Absolutely
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.560]  they're looking at political opponents
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.560]  they want to have a rationale
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.560]  to attack
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.560]  political opponents we've seen what they
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.560]  use the IRS for but of course
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:22.560]  what's much more dangerous when homeland
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.560]  security and the military and the police
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.560]  are doing that with force
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.560]  going after the political opponents and so
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.560]  they use this other impoverished law center
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.560]  to try to portray these people
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.560]  as dangerous as violent and it's
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.560]  very interesting I think that it's noticeably
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.560]  absent from the Southern Poverty Law Center
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.560]  site any
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:42.560]  talk about radical Islam except
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.560]  to characterize anybody who does
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.560]  talk about a threat from radical Islam
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.560]  as Islamophobes. We'll be right back
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:20:00.560]  with Paul Joseph Watson. Stay with us.

[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:03.560]  Quantitive easing, unemployment at depression levels, Europe financial system falling apart,
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:08.560]  China getting out of US Treasuries. At the end of 2008, the time of tarp, the national
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:14.560]  debt was at $11 trillion, gold trading around $850 per ounce. Close to 2012, the national
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:20.560]  debt exceeded $16.4 trillion, gold doubled to $1600 per ounce. The $20 trillion threshold
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:24.560]  for the national debt is inevitable. Politicians in Washington have a ferocious
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:29.560]  appetite for spending and stimulus. What's worse, a printing press to finance.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:33.560]  100 years ago, we had a gold standard to limit this madness, but now you have to adopt

[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:11.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and we have joining us from the UK.
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:17.560]  Paul Joseph Watson. We're talking about the hit piece that the SPLC did on the Oath Keepers
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:23.560]  as well as the miners in Oregon merely trying to get their day in court. The miners were
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:27.560]  told that they had to shut everything down in a very short time. They were given a deadline
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:32.560]  of tomorrow saying that they had to remove all the buildings, remove all their equipment,
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.560]  fill up all the holes in a mine that has been there for 150 years that they have a clear
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:43.560]  title to that has been grandfathered in with all this legislation. They spent $10,000 trying
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:48.560]  to get answers as to why the BLM was doing this. I had an interview with somebody from
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:52.560]  the mining district. He gave us an idea of what it was. It was really just a petty vendetta
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:57.560]  from some BLM employees, I believe, in terms of talking to them. You can watch that interview
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:02.560]  yourself. They actually embedded it on the attack piece in the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:10.560]  but as Paul pointed out, they have a very controversial headline saying that they're dreaming
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:15.560]  of an armed confrontation with the BLM, and yet when they, in the body of the article,
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:19.560]  when they talk to people and get quotes from them, it's just the opposite. They do not
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:23.560]  want an armed confrontation. They are not provoking things. The people who are provoking things
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:28.560]  are the BLM. They simply want their due process, as you would expect, that lawyers would understand
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.560]  that. But that's not what motivates the Southern Poverty Law Center. It's not motivated out
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:38.560]  of a desire to see people get due process or civil liberties. They have portrayed themselves
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:45.560]  as the defenders of civil rights against the Ku Klux Klan, and yet the only time that he
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:50.560]  did anything, Morris D's, the founder of the SPLC, the only time he ever did anything in
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:56.560]  the civil rights movement was to defend the Ku Klux Klan. And then, as Harper's magazine,
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:00.560]  a story called The Church of Morris D's, pointed out, in the 1960s, Morris D's set on the
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:05.560]  sidelines, honing his direct marketing skills, practicing law while the civil rights movement
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:10.560]  engulfed the South. And here's this quote from his partner, his business partner, Morris
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:15.560]  D's and I shared the overriding purpose of making a pile of money, and that's exactly
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:21.560]  what they're doing, except now what they're doing is they are operating as shills for
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:26.560]  Homeland Security, for the scenarios that are coming out of Homeland Security, the FBI,
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:31.560]  the military, portraying political enemies of the government as being dangerous terrorists.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.560]  That's what's really underlying all this, isn't it, Paul?
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:42.560]  Exactly. Another point I'm making in the article is that interview that you did on this subject,
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:48.560]  but they didn't use it as fair use. They didn't comment over it. They plagiarized entire content
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:53.560]  from our channel, as well as the next news network, and just put it on their own channel
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:58.560]  without even commenting over it. I mean, we could get that video pulled in a heartbeat.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:03.560]  People do that to us all the time, but again, it just illustrates how amateurish they are.
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:09.560]  And what I find ironic about it is George Soros funds the SPLC. So while he's funding this
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:14.560]  group in the name of stopping violent extremism, he's also funding Black Lives Matter, which
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:20.560]  in many cases, as in Ferguson, Missouri, during the riots, engaged in violent extremism.
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:24.560]  So again, another complete contradiction. And of course, he's funding the neo-Nazis
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:28.560]  and the Ukraine as well, as well. Yeah, exactly. I think it's very interesting, Paul,
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:32.560]  how Morse-D's quickly switched sides just like the Democrat Party did.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:36.560]  You know, we had Robert Byrd, who was in the Ku Klux Klan. Senator Robert Byrd, we had George Wallace.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:41.560]  The Democrat Party had been playing racial politics, but they were on the side of the white supremacists
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:46.560]  up until the Civil Rights Movement. Then all of a sudden, they just did a real quick pivot and a 180.
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:51.560]  And then after that was over, Morse-D's came back in and reinvented himself as being on the side of
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:56.560]  civil rights and opposed to the Ku Klux Klan, just like the Democrat Party did.
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:01.560]  Yeah, and they actually abandoned civil rights cases that aren't making them any money.
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:06.560]  They've done that before. Also, you know, it's like arms manufacturers, they need to continuously
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:12.560]  invent enemies to keep the profits rolling in, which is exactly what the SPLC does.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:18.560]  The good news is that, I think it was last year or a couple of years ago, the FBI actually removed them
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.560]  from their list of resources for, quote, hate crimes resources.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:29.560]  So now they've been completely discredited that the actual federal government itself is backing away from them.
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:35.560]  Yeah, well, they have, they put that out there as a headline. They still link to it a little bit further down.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:41.560]  So we all looked at that, and even the FRC, the Family Research Council, was real happy that it looked like we'd had a victory.
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:45.560]  But they're still doing that, and they're still using it in their training scenarios.
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:48.560]  And that's the thing that really concerns me.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.560]  But one of the other things out of this article, the Church of Morse D's, that I thought was interesting,
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:56.560]  and we talk about it in the video that we embedded on the article, it was a report I did about a year ago called
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:02.560]  The Profits of Hate, P-R-O-F-I-T-S. And this is a quote from Harper's Magazine.
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:07.560]  They say, today the SPLC spends most of its time and money on a relentless fundraising campaign
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:13.560]  peddling memberships in the Church of Tolerance with all the zeal of a circuit rider passing the collection plate.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:18.560]  And here's a quote from a former associate of Morse D's, Millard Farmer.
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:23.560]  He says, he's the Jim and Tammy Faye Baker of the Civil Rights Movement.
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:27.560]  He says, and I don't mean to malign Jim and Tammy Faye Baker.
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:30.560]  So we're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:37.560]  We're also going to talk about this article that he's got PayPal, Asserts, Copyright ownership over all intellectual property of its users.
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.560]  How about that?
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:45.560]  The corporations think they own everything and they're going to make that come true if we don't stop them.
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.560]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:51.560]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:30:17.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:36.560]  We're on the run.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:59.560]  We're on the run.
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:28.560]  We're on the run.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:57.560]  We're on the run.
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:31:59.560]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:00.560]  Good, brother.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:03.560]  Just recently started using your products. Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:07.560]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:10.560]  Well, thank you, brother. It's because it also funds our operation.
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.560]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:20.560]  Supermail vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:29.560]  We do the supermail and the superfemale vitality. Big changes, a lot of energy. We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, a statement, a ton of money there.
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:37.560]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:44.560]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:48.560]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.560]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:47.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and we're talking to Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:52.560]  We're also going to have John Rappaport joining us in the next hour.
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:58.560]  Before I go back to Paul, I wanted to let you know that we have a special on Silver Bullet, 50% off.
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:03.560]  That's about $15 per bottle savings and of course that's our 30 parts per million.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:06.560]  It's triple the strength of other colloidal silver products.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:13.560]  It's a very high concentration. It's heavily concentrated in pure deionized water, electrically stabilized to improve potency.
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:19.560]  That's something you can store in your medicines cabinet for years because of that stabilization.
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:24.560]  We often run out of this, but right now we have it in stock and offering the biggest discount we've ever had.
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:27.560]  50% off, $15 per bottle savings.
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:32.560]  Also, we have another special, 2X2, Survival Shield X2. That's our nascent iodine.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:37.560]  If you buy two of those, you get one fluoride shield bottle for free.
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:41.560]  Again, that is also at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:49.560]  Paul, I think as we're talking about the Southern Poverty Law Center attack on the miners who are just trying to get their due process from the BLM.
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:58.560]  And on Oathkeepers who are doing security to make sure that that's going to happen because the BLM was basically not replying to any of the requests saying,
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:05.560]  what is the basis of your demands to stop and cease the operation of this mine that's been in operation for the last 150 years?
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:10.560]  What is the basis of that? They couldn't get any answers other than because we say so and you better do it by
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:16.560]  and the date was tomorrow that they were going to have to get everything removed, the holes filled in.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:23.560]  So basically Oathkeepers was requested by the mining operator there and they came out there and they are providing security.
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:27.560]  So these people have a chance to go through the due process, to go through courts.
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:30.560]  I would think that lawyers would appreciate that.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:40.560]  But what we've seen, Paul, is we've seen with this administration, we've seen naked political persecution of political opponents of his using the IRS.
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:44.560]  Something that is far beyond what Richard Nixon got impeached for.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:52.560]  And what I'm concerned about is that we're going to see law enforcement being used against people who are political enemies of the government.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:59.560]  Because that's what the Southern Poverty Law Center is being used for by Homeland Security, by the military and their training scenarios.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:03.560]  We have to remember that this is continually getting worse.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:11.560]  As I pointed out, look at the way they're using the IRS and how Nixon was impeached for far less than they're doing and yet they do it openly now.
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:20.560]  Now they're using the Southern Poverty Law Center as a beard to try to portray political opponents as hateful, as terrorists, as racist.
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:27.560]  But the day is coming when they're just going to do it like they're doing with the IRS because they can and because they can get away with it.
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:35.560]  Yeah, and they're working hand in hand with the DHS who openly fund studies that say Americans who are quote,
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:40.560]  reverent of individual liberty are on a par with Islamic terrorists.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.560]  I mean, that's how bad it is.
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:43.560]  Exactly.
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:52.560]  Going back to the financial issue, I mean, talking about profits of hate, the SPLC has $238 million in assets.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.560]  This is a civil rights organization.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:55.560]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:37:04.560]  And in fact, they lost $50 million during the year of the financial collapse in 2009 because they had invested most of it.
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:12.560]  This is donations coming from people to fight civil rights cases from liberals who have to pay their indulgences.
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.560]  Absolutely.
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:19.560]  They invested a ton of the money and lost $50 million during the couple of years of the stock market crash.
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:27.560]  And again, going back to Morris D's, you compare him to Stephen Bright of the Southern Center for Human Rights.
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.560]  Again, another civil rights organization.
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:33.560]  Bright makes $11,000 a year as president.
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:40.560]  Morris D's, who is already a multimillionaire, makes $350,000 a year.
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:50.560]  So this is basically an organization that just contrives hate, creates enemies like the armaments industry does to profit from war, to reap these vast profits.
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:38:00.560]  Again, they take in about $47 million a year and they keep $20 million of it after all their operating expenses, $14 to $20 million.
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:04.560]  So it's very lucrative to peddle this hate.
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:12.560]  And again, you can look at the Pop Lorsky case, that was blamed on us, this guy who shot, what was it, three cops in Pittsburgh.
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:20.560]  When he left comments on our website saying how much he hated Alex Jones, yet the SPLC blamed that on us as well.
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:26.560]  Mark Potock went on CNN and said that the Boston bombing was probably done by, quote, patriots.
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:27.560]  Yes.
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:34.560]  So they've been proven wrong time and time again, yet they're still peddling this hate because it's very lucrative for them.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.560]  Yes.
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.560]  And it's a narrative that the government wants out there.
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:43.560]  When you're talking about the money, this article that was back from the year 2000, the Church of Morris D's and Harper's Magazine.
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:49.560]  And it truly is a way of getting an indulgence, doing penance for many of these liberals.
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:56.560]  But they need to understand that even back then, and of course that was 15 years ago, they point out they'd made $44 million.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:03.560]  $27 million of it from fundraising and $17 million from stocks and other investors, as you're pointing out, Paul.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:08.560]  But half of what they took in from fundraising, less than half of what they took in from fundraising, they took in $27 million.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:12.560]  They only spent $13 million on their civil rights program.
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:16.560]  They say making it one of the most profitable charities in the country.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:17.560]  And so that's what it is.
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:20.560]  It's all about the money, but it's also about the power.
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:25.560]  It's also about being used in a narrative that the government wants to sell to people.
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.560]  And as I pointed out earlier, Paul, they don't talk about radical Islam,
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:34.560]  except to criticize anybody who does talk about it as saying, well, that's proof that they're Islamophobes.
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:37.560]  That's proof that they're dangerous, hate-filled racists.
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:42.560]  If you talk about radical Islam whatsoever, you get put on their hate watch.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:51.560]  Yeah, and that's because they're an extremely hypocritical, leftist organization that's politically driven and completely biased.
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:55.560]  So why on earth is the federal government using them as a resource?
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:40:00.560]  And again, going back to the violence issue, they had somebody in the comments on their website,
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:05.560]  another one of their liberal tolerant supporters, like the guy who shot up the Family Research Council,
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:08.560]  who openly called for Alex Jones's execution.
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:12.560]  This comment remained on their website for over four months.
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:18.560]  So do they really care about preventing hate and domestic violence when we see that kind of example?
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:21.560]  And again, they've been discredited over and over again.
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:25.560]  They completely overhyped the Hutter E. Militia case.
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:28.560]  That collapsed. They were all acquitted.
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:31.560]  So they've just got egg on their face time and time again.
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:37.560]  And it's just so easy to write these response pieces whenever the SPLC attacks us,
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:44.560]  because we've just got years and years of examples where they've got it spectacularly wrong in every single case.
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:49.560]  Absolutely. Let's talk about this other article that you've got up today that went up just a little while ago.
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:53.560]  PayPal asserts copyright ownership over all intellectual property of its users.
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:56.560]  Now, of course, they're doing this through a new user agreement.
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:00.560]  I want you to break that down. But Paul, when I look at this, everywhere I turn,
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:06.560]  I see big corporations asserting copyright ownership over everything, over things that they don't own.
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:11.560]  We need to understand that this is the fundamental basis for how they're going to control the Internet,
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:15.560]  how they're going to control you is how they're going to shut down your car.
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:22.560]  We've talked about how General Motors and other automobile manufacturers are asserting that you don't have any right to work on your car.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:28.560]  You don't own your car. It is merely a licensing agreement, as John Deere talks about.
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:31.560]  They own everything because they own copyrights.
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:34.560]  And this is the fundamental basis of the way they're going to come at the Internet,
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:40.560]  saying you've got a copyright violation so we can just shut down your website based on mere accusation.
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:45.560]  And it is woven throughout the transatlantic and trans-specific partnerships.
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:50.560]  But let's talk about this particular case here with PayPal. Break this down for the users.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:57.560]  Well, yeah, this is key, as you said, because it ties into TTIP, which of course they classified under national security,
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:01.560]  obviously because if anybody actually found out what was truly in it, they would be horrified.
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:07.560]  That's going through at the moment, obviously allowing foreign corporations to change U.S. law.
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:12.560]  But somebody sent a business owner sent me this link and nobody else has reported this,
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.560]  where the only news organization to report this.
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:20.560]  PayPal has announced that it's going to update its terms of agreement, terms of service,
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:23.560]  effective July 1st this year.
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:27.560]  And this is what they say in their own terms of agreement.
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:37.560]  Quote, when providing us with content or posting content, in each case for publication, whether on or offline, using the services,
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:45.560]  you grant the PayPal group a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensible,
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:53.560]  right to exercise any and all copyright publicity trademarks, database rights, and intellectual property,
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:59.560]  you have in the content in any media known now or in the future, and it goes on and on.
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:06.560]  So basically, if you're a website owner or if you're a business owner who uses PayPal to take payments,
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:12.560]  from what this says, and we need copyright lawyers to comment on this, because none have done so,
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:18.560]  as of this moment, I asked four different intellectual property experts to comment on this,
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:20.560]  so hopefully we'll get an update to it.
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:25.560]  But if you've got a website or a business and you use PayPal services to take payments,
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:33.560]  to me, this reads as if they're claiming complete intellectual property ownership over anything you put on that website,
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:37.560]  anything you publish, again, online or offline.
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:38.560]  That's amazing.
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:39.560]  I mean, it looks pretty extensive.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:45.560]  Yeah, it looks pretty extensive when they're talking about worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensible,
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:51.560]  right to exercise any and all copyright, publicity, trademarks, database rights, and intellectual property rights you have in content.
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:56.560]  I mean, that is pretty amazing, regardless of if that's restricted in any way whatsoever.
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:58.560]  See, that's the way they sneak this stuff in, Paul.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:04.560]  They put it in the fine print, just the same way that they're trying to sneak in these trade agreements, so-called trade agreements.
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:10.560]  They're sneaking it in quietly, privately, secretly so that nobody can see it.
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:14.560]  They're going to have to pass it so that we can see what's in it, except that we have seen some of what's in it,
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:17.560]  because it's been leaked, some of the aspects of it have been leaked by WikiLeaks.
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:19.560]  But that's the way these guys are operating.
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:24.560]  They're just absolutely, they just say that they own this and then put it out there.
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:25.560]  People need to understand that.
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:32.560]  They also need to understand, just like I pointed out earlier in the show, John Deere and General Motors are both talking,
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:35.560]  pushing back against the idea that you own your car.
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:44.560]  And General Motors said, people are mistakenly conflating ownership of a vehicle with ownership of the underlying computer software in a vehicle.
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:48.560]  And as John Deere pointed out, we're just giving them a license.
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:51.560]  You know, you just have a implied license.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:52.560]  You don't really own anything.
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:54.560]  That's the perspective of these corporations.
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:58.560]  Yeah, they can revoke that license at any point.
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:03.560]  What's interesting about this is, there was a huge controversy in 2012,
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:07.560]  where on Facebook, you saw people posting status updates,
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:14.560]  asserting that they maintained copyright ownership of their original content that they posted on Facebook.
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:18.560]  And that was quite a misnomer, because if you actually read Facebook's own terms,
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:24.560]  they merely stated that Facebook asserts the license to use and display that content,
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:27.560]  not that it owns the copyright to that content.
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:34.560]  So this PayPal TOS update is a lot more draconian than the Facebook situation,
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:38.560]  which caused a lot of controversy back in 2012.
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.560]  And again, no one's reported on this.
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:46.560]  There are two blogs where a handful of people are freaking out about this.
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:48.560]  No news organization has picked it up.
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:53.560]  And again, as he said, they know that people don't read terms of service agreements,
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:59.560]  so they can slip this kind of stuff in, whether it's legally enforceable after it gets publicity,
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.560]  which it should do.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:06.560]  I would be doubtful of that, but it just shows you the attitude that these huge corporations,
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:11.560]  and of course, PayPal is not given its record.
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:14.560]  They froze WikiLeaks' account back in 2010,
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:18.560]  so they've got a history of targeting groups politically.
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:23.560]  The head of PayPal, one of the head developers, as we covered earlier this week,
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:29.560]  is now advocating that instead of a password, you would have a brain chip to access your computer
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:32.560]  or eventually your PayPal account itself.
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:36.560]  So it's not a very venerable company in terms of its history.
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:40.560]  And with this kind of language, they're only going to drive more people away.
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:44.560]  But there are very few alternatives to PayPal.
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:50.560]  And this is the problem we have when corporations get these kind of monopolies over things like payment systems,
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:54.560]  because I've been using PayPal for, what, 15 years now,
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:57.560]  and I've never run across an alternative that works as well.
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:01.560]  So, I mean, that's how they maintain dominance over these sectors.
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:09.560]  Well, absolutely. And of course, one of the previous top people at PayPal went on to form Palantir,
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:14.560]  which is involved with a prison program and working hand in glove with a CIA.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:18.560]  These guys that are at the top, these guys that go to Bilderberg and hang out,
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:21.560]  just like we're talking about earlier in the show, David Petraeus,
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:28.560]  he turns over a bunch of information to his mistress and he just gets a slap on the wrist.
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:34.560]  He gets a fine that is 75% of one of his speaking engagements and a two-year probation.
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:42.560]  And look at how draconian, other than that, this administration has been coming after every kind of whistleblower.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:46.560]  But of course, David Petraeus, not in exposing any criminal operations.
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:51.560]  And I guess that's why he got a pass, but also because he's part of the elite insiders.
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:56.560]  But I think, you know, Paul, when we look at this, it troubles me how copyrights are being used.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:01.560]  And we need to have a discussion about what a legitimate copyright use is.
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:06.560]  Certainly, people should have some property rights, but the way this is being extended by these corporations
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:11.560]  is a way to turn everybody into serfs and to slaves who don't own anything.
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:15.560]  I remember the dispute about it's a wonderful life.
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:17.560]  That was something that was owned by a movie studio.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:19.560]  That changed hands a number of times.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:24.560]  It wasn't initially a successful movie, so nobody was really paying too much attention to it.
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:26.560]  It passed into the public domain.
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:32.560]  And at that point, Ted Turner and his cable station picked it up and started playing it frequently.
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.560]  And that's when a new generation discovered that movie.
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:44.560]  It became very popular and it was in the public domain and being freely sold by a number of different studios that were packaging it out there.
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:53.560]  And what they did was they went to court and they asserted that they had copyright usage going back to the script.
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:49:00.560]  And doing that because the script is a written piece of material, they have different copyright uses for that.
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:05.560]  So they used the script to basically take it back into copyright within the United States.
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:10.560]  Now, other countries are not recognizing that because they did really allow that to slip.
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:12.560]  But that's the kind of legal tricks.
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:16.560]  Just like you're seeing with this user agreement, that's the kind of tricks that they're doing.
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:21.560]  And of course, the biggest trick that they're about to do is the trade partnership agreements.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:25.560]  The Transatlantic, the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreements, these are being done in secret.
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:27.560]  We know that copyright is a gigantic portion of that.
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:32.560]  And of course, the thing that concerns me the most is how they will be able to, because they're the big guys.
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:34.560]  It matters who accuses you.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:37.560]  If it's a big corporation, they don't really have to prove anything.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:38.560]  They can just accuse you.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:43.560]  And just like civil asset forfeiture, they can shut you down without finding you guilty of anything,
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:46.560]  without giving you a day in court, without any due process.
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:49.560]  That's what's coming with all this copyright stuff.
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:56.560]  Yeah, and also we see that with them tying it into cybersecurity, you know, Stuxnet, Flame, you name it.
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:03.560]  All those big cybersecurity problems, those issues were all contrived by either the US government, the Israeli government,
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.560]  or both of them in unison.
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:13.560]  And now they're exploiting the copyright issue to push the re-emergence of legislation like SOPA and SISPA.
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:16.560]  I mean, look at what happened to Aaron Schwartz.
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:19.560]  He was made an example out of.
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:27.560]  He was, you know, completely demonized and obviously it led to his tragic suicide for uploading academic documents to the internet.
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:33.560]  Something which even if you believe he was in the wrong would have received a, you know, a fine or a light prison sentence.
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:38.560]  He was completely hounded by the authorities which led to his suicide.
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:40.560]  So they're making examples out of people.
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:50.560]  They're using copyright to go after the small guy while claiming that they assert ownership over your material if you simply use their services.
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:52.560]  It's getting completely out of control.
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:55.560]  It's all about sharing and it's all about asserting their ownership.
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:51:14.560]  Stay with us. We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:29.560]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.560]  Hey, Boomer.
[01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:34.560]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:36.560]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:38.560]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:43.560]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaks only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:46.560]  I know, right? You love it too.
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:48.560]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too. Let's go get some.
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:58.560]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653. That's 877-886-3653 or visit goberkey.com.
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:25.560]  It's powerful enough to protect you and your family from the threat of deadly viruses, bacteria and fungus.
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:28.560]  But it's so safe that it can be used internally or topically.
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:33.560]  And you'll never again deal with the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics.
[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:38.560]  Hundreds of scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals and research institutions
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:44.560]  have all shown supernatural silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against invading pathogens.
[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:47.560]  Supernatural silver is a must-have for your arsenal.

[01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:13.560]  Day after day, alone on a hill, the man with the foolish green is keeping perfectly still.
[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:17.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and we're talking to Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:26.560]  We're talking about how the corporations are extending their copyrights and myriad ways to assert ownership over everything.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:30.560]  And now we've got PayPal with a new user agreement.
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:38.560]  And of course, as Paul pointed out, Facebook once before came under a lot of criticism for putting out a new copyright statement,
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:42.560]  but they made it clear in their statement that you retained copyright to your content.
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:47.560]  This one from PayPal looks far more extensive, very alarming languages in there.
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:54.560]  I want to go back to Paul, but before we do, I just want to let you know that we have free shipping at infowarslife.com
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:55:01.560]  on several products, on X2, on SuperMail, on Oxipowder, and on SilverBullet.
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:04.560]  We have free shipping at infowarslife.com.
[01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:09.560]  And of course, we also have the special 50% off on SilverBullet.
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:15.560]  You can get that now at a $15 per bottle savings, the biggest discount we have ever had on SilverBullet.
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:17.560]  And of course, we run out of that frequently.
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:24.560]  It's a great time to stock up on that. It's half off and free shipping.
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:26.560]  Also, we have another special.
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:32.560]  You can get a free bottle of fluoride shield when you stock up on two bottles of X2, nascent iodine,
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:39.560]  or when you get two bottles of SilverBullet, you can get a free bottle of fluoride shield along with free shipping.
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:41.560]  That's at infowarslife.com.
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:47.560]  Let's go back to Paul again. Paul, we were just talking about how they have extended these copyrights
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:51.560]  and what is coming up with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:55.560]  Of course, we have a fast track that was just passed last week.
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:58.560]  They're going to fast track the fast track negotiation.
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:03.560]  How are people reacting to this in the UK?
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:10.560]  T-Tip has come up on a few occasions, but there's definitely a media bias not to cover it.
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:15.560]  One of the fringe parties introduced it during a political debate last night, I believe it was.
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:19.560]  Obviously, we've got a general election coming up in the UK next month.
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:26.560]  And he accused, he's the head of the reality party, he accused the BBC of hiding it, not talking about it.
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:29.560]  And they, of course, claimed, oh, yes, we did mention it.
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:33.560]  And they always do that. You know, they can claim, oh, we mentioned it in this report,
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:38.560]  but there's a difference between mentioning it and actually giving it the coverage that it deserves.
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:44.560]  So there's definitely been a tendency, definitely in the UK, to sideline that entire issue.
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:50.560]  Because, you know, they're part of the same team, but we don't even know what's in most of it
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:53.560]  because they've classified it under national security.
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:59.560]  In fact, I think it was Elizabeth Warren who said if people knew what was actually in this,
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:04.560]  they would go completely crazy. And that's part of the reason why they're keeping it classified, obviously.
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:08.560]  Yeah, she went to the White House, some of the members of Congress were briefed on it,
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:14.560]  because, you know, quite frankly, the Republican Party seems inexplicably to be 100% behind this
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:16.560]  because it's labeled as free trade.
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:20.560]  So therefore, you know, you're supposed to be for free markets, but this is not a free market.
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:23.560]  This is crony capitalism in its worst form.
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:26.560]  This is corporate fascism in its worst form.
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:31.560]  And a lot of people, I think, in the Republican Party, understand what that means
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:36.560]  after looking at the bank bailouts. They understand that bank bailouts were not free market.
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:40.560]  This is the same sort of thing, and Republicans need to wake up to this as well.
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:43.560]  But it's just a small fight going on right now.
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:47.560]  The general public hasn't really woke up to this, and it's just kind of a fight back and forth
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:49.560]  between elements within the Democrat Party.
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:55.560]  And they're portraying this simply as being the unions against this kind of export of jobs
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:58:00.560]  and managed trade, but it is much, much broader than that.
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:06.560]  Yeah, there's a huge difference between free market and corporatism, which is what this t-tip is.
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:11.560]  It's allowing foreign corporations to change U.S. laws.
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:14.560]  It's a complete violation of U.S. sovereignty.
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:19.560]  And it's not going to help the vast majority of businesses in the United States.
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:21.560]  It's not going to help the middle class.
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:26.560]  It's only going to help the huge corporations that already get special favors from government
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:32.560]  that have revolving doors with government, and as he said, it's the ultimate expression of crony capitalism
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:36.560]  has nothing whatsoever to do with the free market.
[01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.560]  Absolutely. Thank you for joining us.
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:42.560]  We'll be right back. Thanks for joining us. Paul Joseph Watson.

[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:49.560]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:16.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:24.560]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:27.560]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight.
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:31.560]  We're going to be joining in the next segment with John Rappaport.
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:37.560]  And before we go to him, because he's been a target of people who are speaking out for informed consent,
[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:42.560]  for your right to choose what goes into your food, to know about what goes into your food,
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:46.560]  and then to make that choice, to know what's going into your body in terms of medicine,
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:49.560]  and to be able to make that choice. He's spoken out for that.
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:56.560]  He's exposed the efforts to take that freedom, that information away from us, and he's been attacked in the media.
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:01:01.560]  Before we go to John Rappaport, I want to talk about Dr. Oz, who's been attacked in the media.
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:08.560]  This is a story that's up on Infowars.com. Dr. Oz's new episode ends controversy and doubles down on GMO labeling.
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:11.560]  This is a story from Jeffrey Jackson that's on Infowars.com.
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:21.560]  And this was Dr. Oz's response to a letter that was signed by 10 doctors asking the hospital that he works at
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:27.560]  to remove him from the hospital because they were not happy with what he talked about on his own show.
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:34.560]  And he came back and essentially went on the attack exposing where these doctors were coming from.
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:40.560]  But before I talk about that, I want to talk about how he opened up his show to respond to this.
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:46.560]  This is what he said. He said, my life's work has been built around one simple message.
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:52.560]  You have a right and a responsibility to become the world expert on your own body.
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:57.560]  In other words, to be informed, to understand how your body works,
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:01.560]  what's being put into it in terms of your food, in terms of your medicine, to analyze it.
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:04.560]  So he's trying to educate people there.
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:07.560]  So you need to become a world expert on your own body, he said.
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:14.560]  And the way you do that is to have access to the best, most current information, to multiple points of view,
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.560]  and to diverse opinions.
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:26.560]  And as part of his show, he showed a clip that he had with somebody who was, I guess we would call him a manufacturer, I think.
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:30.560]  And I guess maybe that's a good word to talk about genetically modified organisms.
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:32.560]  It is more like manufacturing than growing.
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:40.560]  Nevertheless, he had a farmer on who had genetically modified apples that did not turn brown when you cut them.
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:50.560]  So he talked to him about it, let the guy make the case, and he also talked to somebody who was concerned about genetically modifying apples.
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:54.560]  And understand the difference between genetic modification and selective breeding.
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:58.560]  Selective breeding has been going on as long as humans have been around.
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:08.560]  We've been looking at traits in a particular plant, in a particular animal, and then trying to emphasize those traits by selective breeding.
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:14.560]  And how we get the kinds of varieties of dogs that we see, for example, is by selective breeding.
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:18.560]  Genetic modification, however, is kind of, we've been talking about copyright.
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:24.560]  So kind of think of this as going in and hacking God's code for living organisms.
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:26.560]  Think of it that way.
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:30.560]  Think about it as a copyright violation on what God has put in there.
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:37.560]  That's one way to look at it, but understand that when you're at that level, first of all, it's not very well understood, I believe.
[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:43.560]  We see over and over again, when they sequence the DNA of these different organisms, they'll talk about a lot of junk DNA.
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:48.560]  You see that used a lot when they're talking about sequencing DNA.
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:50.560]  I don't think there's junk DNA in there.
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:55.560]  I think there's DNA that they don't understand the functionality of, and they call it junk.
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:04:04.560]  And so that's what concerns me about this, is that they're messing with things that they don't fully understand, and they don't fully understand the repercussions of this, and it's not being tested.
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:08.560]  But he also went on the offensive, and I think this is very instructive as well.
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:16.560]  He had an investigative reporter, Elizabeth Limie, who did a report, and she looked at all 10 of these doctors.
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:17.560]  And here's some examples.
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:29.560]  One of the primary attackers, Dr. Henry Miller, is clearly shown to be a biotech shill and a gun for hire, working previously as a key supporter for the tobacco industry in the 1990s.
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:35.560]  They also showed that one of the other attackers had an $8 million criminal Medicare fraud.
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:41.560]  Another organization was a RepaScience group, the American Council of Science and Health.
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:47.560]  They've been promoting cigarettes, pesticides, and GMOs while they collect money from these industries.
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:48.560]  Stay with us.
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:55.560]  We're going to be right back with John Rapoport, and we're going to talk about efforts to shut down and conceal what goes into your food.
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:56.560]  Stay with us.
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:57.560]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:10.560]  Beth Clarkson, chief statistician for the National Institute for Aviation Research, filed an open records lawsuit in Sedgwick County District Court as part of her personal quest to find an unexplained pattern that transcends elections and states.
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:16.560]  She found patterns and results that favored Republican establishment candidates over tea party candidates in primaries and in the general election.
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:19.560]  This is not an anomaly that has occurred in one place, Clarkson said.
[02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:22.560]  It is a pattern that has occurred repeatedly in elections across the United States.
[02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:26.560]  InfoWars has extensively covered the work of Bev Harris from blackboxvoting.org.
[02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:29.560]  There you can find the four key items to election transparency.
[02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:30.560]  One, who can vote.
[02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:31.560]  Two, who did vote.
[02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:32.560]  Three, counting of the vote.
[02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:34.560]  And four, that chain of custody.
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:39.560]  Now remember the words of computer programmer Clinton Eugene Curtis next time you step up to a touch screen to cast your ballot.
[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:43.560]  I wrote a prototype for President Congressman Tom Feeney.
[02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:49.560]  It would flip the vote 5149, the whoever you wanted it to go to and whichever race you wanted to win.
[02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:52.560]  It was Joseph Stalin that said, the people who cast the votes decide nothing.
[02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:54.560]  The people who count the votes decide everything.
[02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:58.560]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:02.560]  What lies at the heart of InfoWars and everything we do.
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:06.560]  The core is fellow human beings for every race, color, and creed.
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:10.560]  Across the United States and the planet that believe in personal liberty.
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:14.560]  And it's people like you that have promoted the radio broadcasts to their friends and family.
[02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:20.560]  It's people like you that have bought the high quality products at InfoWarsStore.com that have made everything we do possible.
[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:22.560]  And that's why I want to salute you.
[02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:25.560]  You have helped us build this operation.
[02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:28.560]  You don't stand beside us or behind us or even in front of us.
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:31.560]  You stand at the heart of InfoWars.
[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:39.560]  That's why in the month of April we're offering some of the biggest specials yet to introduce listeners to these high quality nutraceuticals at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:01.560]  I want more candy. I want more videos here. Why, why, why?
[02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:11.560]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:14.560]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:17.560]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:23.560]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:29.560]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:35.560]  Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:43.560]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:50.560]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:07:54.560 --> 02:08:16.560]  That's Child Ease exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:24.560]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:31.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host and joining us now is John Rapopore from NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:44.560]  In the last segment I was talking about how the media has attacked Dr. Oz basically because he questioned GMO and not even questioning its safety and efficacy.
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:54.560]  It's a very even-handed report, but he said, you have a right to know what goes into your food. You have a right to know about the labeling, but that's not the way things operate anymore.
[02:08:54.560 --> 02:09:04.560]  We see all over the country efforts to force people to take vaccines. Forget informed consent. They now call it a personal belief exemption.
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:13.560]  You're not informed. You just have a personal belief. You have an irrational faith that can't be substantiated by science is what they claim.
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:21.560]  When they talk about an exemption, that's kind of the difference between talking about a right and a privilege.
[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:26.560]  A right is something you possess as a human being, something you're given from God.
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:33.560]  A privilege is something that you're granted from the government. And so they want to take away your consent by calling it an exemption.
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:37.560]  We're not going to give you that exemption anymore. That's what we see all over the country.
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:43.560]  And I wanted to talk to John Rappaport about this article that was up on Wednesday at infowars.com.
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:50.560]  Australia vaccine war update. The people are slaves to the state. Joining us now is John Rappaport. Welcome, Mr. Rappaport.
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:52.560]  Hi. Good to be here.
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:58.560]  Tell us about what's the efforts that are going on in Australia. And I think also, is it New Zealand where they're trying to do this as well?
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:06.560]  Yes. I've been getting a flood of responses from Australia after I published that.
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:22.560]  Basically, what's happened there is that the government, the head of government, Tony Abbott, decided that he was going to make it severely penalizing for anybody who refuses the vaccine,
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:32.560]  for anyone who refuses the vaccinate child, because everybody in Australia gets some form of federal funding, money, whatever you want to call it.
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:52.560]  There are several different programs. And so if a parent decides, okay, I'm not going to vaccinate my child, they would lose roughly $15,000 a year per child in federal aid for refusing to vaccinate.
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:57.560]  That's a stiff, heavy penalty. And that's per year.
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:09.560]  Wow. And then he followed up with this by stating his health minister stating that basically there were no more exemptions for vaccines, in other words.
[02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:12.560]  Yeah, again, as an exemption, it's not getting your consent.
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:23.560]  Yeah, exactly. Or to put it another way, religious statement of a conviction against vaccines no longer applies.
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:32.560]  A conscientious objector, which apparently is some kind of category of vaccine refusal in Australia, that's no longer permitted.
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:46.560]  The only thing that is now permitted is a medical note from a doctor, which basically says that you have some, you know, medical condition, serious medical condition,
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:53.560]  where a vaccine note could be dangerous. And obviously that's not going to be an easy note to get from a doctor.
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:54.560]  That's right.
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:56.560]  Because these doctors are going to be under surveillance.
[02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:01.560]  Yeah, what's going to happen to that doctor when he gives somebody a note like that? He's going to come under a lot of examination.
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:02.560]  Oh, you bet.
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:17.560]  So they basically shut down all the loopholes in the country in one fell swoop. And in addition, added penalties, serious financial penalties.
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:23.560]  And therefore, you know, they put the nation under medical police state. I mean, there's no other way to say it.
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:31.560]  Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, if you cannot know what's going into your body, if you can't know what's in your food, if you can't know what's in your medicine,
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:36.560]  and they're going to force you to take it, that is absolute tyranny.
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:41.560]  I know when they had this bill up in Oregon, I think it was Oregon or Washington state.
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:46.560]  It was a state senator who was also a physician who was pushing this.
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:48.560]  And they pointed out the hypocrisy of what she was doing.
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:58.560]  And they pointed out that she talked about on a particular website how she suffers from a particular disease.
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:01.560]  And she wanted to keep taking interferon while she was breastfeeding.
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:07.560]  Both her physician and the drug company said, you can't do that while you're breastfeeding.
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:15.560]  She did her own research. She called some medical professionals and she decided that she was going to do it anyway.
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:22.560]  So she did her research. She informed herself and she went against the recommendations of the doctor as well as the drug company.
[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:28.560]  And she said, but you want to allow us to have that same choice, that same freedom with vaccines.
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:33.560]  That's what this really boils down to. And that's the principle that people need to understand.
[02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:38.560]  It's far beyond even the discussion about the safety and the efficacy of vaccines.
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:47.560]  When they can force you, put a gun to your head and force you to take something without informing you, that is very, very dangerous.
[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:57.560]  And there are cases where you have to vaccinate your child or the child will be removed and taken to foster care.
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:01.560]  Well, look at what's going on in California right now. They have this bill SB 277.
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:05.560]  And basically instead of coming through the subsidies like they did in Australia,
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:10.560]  saying we're going to take a huge financial penalty that you're going to get,
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:17.560]  there they're saying that you're not going to be allowed in school unless you can prove your vaccine record.
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:21.560]  But then it's not just taking your child out of the government school and putting them in a private school.
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:25.560]  They won't allow that either. And it's not even allowed for people who are homeschooling,
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:33.560]  presumably if you didn't have a vaccine record that was signed off by some bureaucrat with the state of California.
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:39.560]  Even if you were homeschooling your child, presumably you would still be in violation of the truancy laws.
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:43.560]  And I guess they could lock you up or take your children away.
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:46.560]  Yeah, so that's another medical police state that we're now seeing.
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:53.560]  And of course they raked that vote in the committee to pass it through to be voted on on the floor of the legislature in California
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:15:01.560]  by substituting a couple of members on the committee and also refusing to allow many parents who were up there in Sacramento
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:08.560]  protesting this whole thing to speak publicly in the second hearing that they held, which would close door.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:13.560]  And they voted to move the bill out onto the floor where it looks like it's going to pass.
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:17.560]  And of course, Jerry Brown, the governor, will sign it.
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:23.560]  So that is a shutdown in California. That's medical police state in California.
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:29.560]  This is happening all over the world. It's coordinated. It's timed.
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:35.560]  This is not just an accident that all of this is happening at once and that in many states in America
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:44.560]  we're now seeing these bills being presented to knock out all loopholes that would allow people not to get vaccinated.
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:55.560]  They started with this absurd outbreak of measles from Disneyland, which really was just a fairy tale from a fairy tale place.
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:16:00.560]  The whole country is in danger now because there's a few cases of measles
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:09.560]  and they tried to claim that all these kids who were getting measles were unvaccinated without any evidence presented.
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:19.560]  And all of a sudden across the country on news shows and talk shows and so forth, the experts began showing up and saying,
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:26.560]  okay, this is it. We have to vaccinate everybody. That's the consensus. Everybody agrees.
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:36.560]  They were just manufacturing the consensus and a full bore attack worldwide was then launched in a very coordinated way.
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:41.560]  So they were waiting for the right moment and they chose it and that's what they're doing now.
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:45.560]  And I think it's very important when we look at the shenanigans that were played in the California Senate to understand
[02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:53.560]  that people who don't respect you as enough as a human being, who don't respect the fundamental principles of liberty of informed consent,
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:58.560]  they're not going to respect the due process of law. They're not going to have a fair and honest vote and a hearing.
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:03.560]  They're going to play every kind of game that they can. And we need to understand this isn't just a California problem.
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:09.560]  This isn't just an American problem. As you pointed out with your article talking about what's going on in Australia and New Zealand everywhere,
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:19.560]  this is a global issue. This is something that they're making this move all at once across the globe to try to force people to take vaccines.
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:27.560]  Clearly in the United States we can see that there's a huge financial incentive for the pharmaceutical companies to move things to vaccines.
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:32.560]  They announced a year or two ago they were going to stop working on antibiotics and they were going to put all their research on the vaccines.
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:38.560]  Well, we understand that they don't have any product liability in America because we have this thing called the vaccine court.
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:43.560]  That and the coercion ought to tell people something is up with all of this.
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:54.560]  But the other thing I'm worried about John is this massive effort in terms of vaccines talking about how they're going to create vaccines with genetic modification.
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:59.560]  When you look at that and the vaccines that they're producing for pretty much every kind of disease,
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:09.560]  whether it's something like HPV or whether it's Ebola, whatever, they're coming up with genetically engineered vaccines.
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:16.560]  And when you combine that with the fact that we would be forced to take them, that is a very concerning scenario,
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:25.560]  especially when you look at the medical research that's being done by Tulane and others with the gain of function experiments where they bring in deadly bacteria that are not indigenous to the area
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:33.560]  and then they try to make them more resistant to drugs, try to make them more easily transmittable, and then work on a vaccine at the same time.
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:47.560]  You bet the genetically modified vaccines are, you know, this is just a wild roulette game because many of these vaccines are being engineered.
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:54.560]  The genetic components that they're inserting have to be carried into the body and they even work.
[02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:56.560]  How do we get these into the body? How do we get these?
[02:18:56.560 --> 02:19:05.560]  And so many of the researchers have settled on this method of using a virus as the carrier for the genetic components.
[02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:15.560]  And of course they claim that this is harmless and so forth, but when you inject somebody and bypass many portals of the immune system with a virus,
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:27.560]  you, you know, this is a danger sign of enormous size because that virus can go anywhere, do anything, be transmitted from person to person, all sorts of things can happen,
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:31.560]  although they say nothing to worry about, they've always been saying that.
[02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:39.560]  And the facts show that these vaccines, just the conventional vaccines, are highly dangerous.
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:46.560]  Absolutely. We're, we've got to go to a break. When we come back, I want to talk to you about some of these gain of function experiments.
[02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:53.560]  What happened with Tulane University at the primate center as well as what you covered in Sierra Leone at the beginning of the Ebola outbreak.
[02:19:53.560 --> 02:20:20.560]  Stay with us. We're going to be right back with John Rappaport.
[02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:33.560]  We've all heard the news stories, another shooting, and they're getting worse.
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:42.560]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays, exclusive 24 hour insider deals to save you money and possibly save your life.

[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:27.560]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:32.560]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:37.560]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:52.560]  When I added to the mix, the key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.
[02:21:52.560 --> 02:22:08.560]  Any of the specials at 888-253-3139.
[02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:28.560]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:32.560]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:38.560]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:42.560]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:43.560]  You should too.
[02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:44.560]  Find out what they know.
[02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:47.560]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well.
[02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:57.560]  3. 866-862-237.
[02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:30.560]  There are hundreds of silver products on the market today.
[02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:35.560]  But there's nothing like the astonishing health benefits of the multi-patented One Silver Solution.

[02:23:54.560 --> 02:24:18.560]  There is only one Silver Solution.
[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:28.560]  No more fakenews.com.
[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:49.560]  To not let us be informed about what is going on in our food.
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:25:02.560]  The Sierra Leone government told them to get out.
[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:11.560]  They were concerned that perhaps they had created some kind of a new dangerous strain that maybe it had gotten out deliberately or even accidentally.
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:20.560]  Everybody poo-pooed that and laughed at that and yet we have now seen that is precisely what happened with the same people, with Tulane in Louisiana.
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:25.560]  They brought in a bacteria, it's Burkholderia pseudomalei.
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:28.560]  They brought it into the United States. It's not indigenous to the area.
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:33.560]  It's part of these gain of function experiments where they bring in deadly bacteria.
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:42.560]  They try to make them more dangerous, harder to kill, easier to spread, at the same time working on a vaccine.
[02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:44.560]  Doesn't that raise some red flags?
[02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:58.560]  And what happened in Louisiana was that Burkholderia pseudomalei got out of the primate lab, got out of a biosafety lab, level 3 lab, and got into the primate center into a 500 acre facility.
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:05.560]  They had the USDA, the FDA down there trying to find out how this got out. They've had one person contract the disease herself.
[02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:10.560]  Of course, they said, well, I'm sure that was already there. I'm sure she didn't get that here.
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:17.560]  Even to the absurd point of saying that if you find it anywhere in the soil, I'm sure it was already here.
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:22.560]  Whereas you've got the CDC scientists saying this has never been indigenous to the United States.
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:26.560]  John, your comments on out-of-control biotech.
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:34.560]  Why do we have the government and pharmaceutical companies trying to make things more dangerous?
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:41.560]  You know, there's a tremendous crossover between so-called disease research and biological warfare research.
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:50.560]  It's a cover story. They need to have a way of saying, well, we're not really doing research on a bio warfare, offensive warfare,
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:55.560]  because we've already signed a treaty long ago forbidding us and many other countries from doing that.
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:27:02.560]  But we are, of course, doing defensive research and pharmaceutical and disease research,
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:07.560]  because we want to help people and cure them and so forth. And this is what they always say.
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:12.560]  As far back as 1987, when I was writing my first book, A Think,
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:23.560]  I came across a great deal of information about the lack of safety in the so-called level 3, 4, 5, 6 of viral labs,
[02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:33.560]  where they do all kinds of sophisticated research and combining germs and creating new germs and synthesizing this and that.
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:38.560]  Escape of microorganisms happens all the time.
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:47.560]  The transmission of these microorganisms happens all the time because of the human factor, regardless of whatever they say.
[02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:56.560]  So this is an entire apparatus and industry in the United States and another country of this kind of research at these labs.
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:02.560]  And they have problems all the time that do not reach the press. It happens.
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:08.560]  And it's a very dangerous thing. So when they try to say, well, we know exactly what we're doing.
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:13.560]  We're creating a great vaccine that's going to help everybody watch out. That's all I can say.
[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:21.560]  Yeah, it's very interesting because when this happened in Louisiana, there was really only one reporter covering this very closely.
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:27.560]  And that was a USA Today reporter who basically was on top of this story as it was developing.
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:35.560]  And of course, she has reported in the past on a lot of accidents that have happened at these so-called secure biosafety labs,
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:39.560]  even at the CDC itself. They've had a lot of accidents there.
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:44.560]  I guess that's the thing that really concerns me and it concerns a lot of other people, yet nothing is being done about it, John.
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:51.560]  We just had the Congress last fall say they wanted to have a moratorium, a voluntary moratorium on these experiments.
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:55.560]  Well, that didn't go too far because these people are making too much money out of it.
[02:28:55.560 --> 02:29:01.560]  It's one more head of the Hydra, one more aspect of the military industrial complex, as you pointed out.
[02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:10.560]  And that in and of itself ought to concern us. But again, going back to the whole idea that we have absolutely no choice in the medicine that we get.
[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:18.560]  We're not allowed to know what's in the food that we eat. They're hiding everything from us and holding a gun to our head in every single aspect of this.
[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:27.560]  It's a war of our freedom versus their version of slavery. People have to understand that this is the war that we're in.
[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:34.560]  Absolutely. So thank you so much for joining us. John Rappaport, NoMoreFakeNews.com. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:08.560]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see here and read every single day?
[02:30:08.560 --> 02:30:17.560]  It's the illusion of choice. Think about it. The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[02:30:17.560 --> 02:30:27.560]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources. So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources,
[02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:35.560]  or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:45.560]  This gives you a false sense of reality. I mean, do you actually know what you think you know? Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:55.560]  Think about it. This is Darren McBreen, and I want you to break the matrix at infowords.com and prisonplanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones show,
[02:30:55.560 --> 02:31:16.560]  because there's a war on your mind.
[02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:38.560]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds. I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:45.560]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for infowordslife.com, the results were incredible.
[02:31:45.560 --> 02:31:57.560]  Take the infowordslife.com challenge today at infowordslife.com or give our crew a call. They can answer all your questions or tell you about any of the specials at 888-253-3139.
[02:32:15.560 --> 02:32:20.560]  We are the ones responsible.
[02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:26.560]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:28.560]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:30.560]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:32.560]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:38.560]  They are never going to stop. They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:48.560]  Block free iphone app at infowords.com. Block free podcast and video feed. Imperatives destroy prisonplanet.tv.
[02:32:48.560 --> 02:32:53.560]  You got to set your eye on the enemy. Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:32:53.560 --> 02:32:58.560]  Electrally it's begun. You can fail it.
[02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:18.560]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:18.560 --> 02:33:26.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight and we're going to be talking to Anthony Gucciardi here in just a moment about what's going on with GMO.
[02:33:26.560 --> 02:33:34.560]  Of course, we've had victories in Vermont where the state legislature there has a mandatory GMO labeling.
[02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:39.560]  You have a right to know you should be informed about what is going on in your food.
[02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:43.560]  And of course, as I mentioned at the beginning of the hour, Dr. Oz came back and he said,
[02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:50.560]  I think the reason they came after me was because I dared to even have a discussion from one person who was in favor of GMO
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:52.560]  and another person who had criticism of it.
[02:33:52.560 --> 02:33:57.560]  We had an even discussion of that, but even that is not allowed. So they came after him.
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:01.560]  And of course, they're now moving to the federal level.
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:05.560]  They've come up about the time that these attacks came on him.
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:13.560]  There was also put in the federal government, we had legislation introduced that critics have called the Dark Act,
[02:34:13.560 --> 02:34:21.560]  denying Americans the right to know the Dark Act, which would basically preempt states from having the ability to do their own labeling laws.
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:26.560]  And of course, that's the status. That's the way it's been done for a very long time where states were involved with labeling laws.
[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:35.560]  But of course, issues like this Vermont legislation that would mandate GMO labeling, that would be shut down at the federal level.
[02:34:35.560 --> 02:34:44.560]  So instead of having to fight this at each of the individual states, they can go in and buy enough congressmen that they can shut the discussion down completely at that level.
[02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:46.560]  So that's what we're looking at right now.
[02:34:46.560 --> 02:34:51.560]  I want to get your comments on this. If you want to call in and tell us where you think this is going to go,
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:55.560]  what you think about your right to know, your right to have informed consent.

[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:04.560]  We're going to talk to Anthony Gucciardi. He'll take your comments and calls as well with me.
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:09.560]  Before we do, before I go to Anthony, I just want to let you know we have free shipping now at infowarslife.com.

[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:10.560]  Anthony, thank you for joining us. This is a real fight that is shaping up in terms of it's essentially a right of freedom.
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:17.560]  It's a right to not be treated like lab rats, to have human dignity and freedom to know what's in our food,
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:20.560]  know what's in our medicine, and make those choices for ourselves.
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:23.560]  And they're trying to take this away at every level right now.
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:26.560]  Quite frankly, it's a right that Monsanto does not want you to have.
[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:33.560]  We actually have proof of that from Reuters, a piece that we can pull up on screen specifically lists that 96% in a poll
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:38.560]  of Monsanto shareholders would actually vote against GMO labeling.
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:40.560]  And why do you think that is?
[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:46.560]  Obviously, it's because they know the public will not buy their garbage if they know what they're actually eating.
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:49.560]  If they know they're eating genetically modified organisms.
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:58.560]  So, at the end of the day, we know more than 95% and we also have those polls too from the New York Times and MSNBC,
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:02.560]  Washington Post, Reuters, you name it, Consumer Reports.
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:10.560]  We see time and time again 95%, 98% are in support from the general public of the United States in support of GMO labeling.
[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:19.560]  That's why now so many states have come from Texas to Minnesota, now Vermont, passing mandatory labeling.
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:21.560]  The Attorney General just signed off on that one.
[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:28.560]  A great, great victory because previously they had actually legislation for the labeling that was considered relaxed
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:32.560]  and they give some timetables that were a little ridiculous for companies to go ahead and label their GMOs.
[02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:35.560]  But now they say, nope, mandatory labeling.
[02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:42.560]  This scares major biotech industries like Monsanto, like Dupont into absolutely freaking out and that's when we have what you mentioned,
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:49.560]  the dark act, the pro-GMO dark act, which basically disallows the labeling of GMO foods.
[02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:51.560]  It disallows you from knowing what you're eating.
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:53.560]  It hides it, yeah, exactly.
[02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:55.560]  It's like the trans-specific transatlantic partnerships.
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:37:58.560]  They say, if people knew what was in it, they wouldn't want this.
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:00.560]  And the same thing is true of your food.
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:01.560]  Why are they hiding this?
[02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:06.560]  That in and of itself should be a major red flag that everything that the government is doing anymore,
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:11.560]  they're hiding what's in it and they're holding a gun to your head saying, you have to do this because I say so.
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:12.560]  And you don't have any choice on the matter.
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:17.560]  People ought to stand up and demand to be informed, demand to have a right.
[02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:23.560]  In Minnesota, so my favorite, my personal favorite state right now pushing for GMO legislation,
[02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:26.560]  one of the first to introduce it in 2015, is Minnesota.
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:31.560]  And we now have reports from the local news that people are going to the courthouse,
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:34.560]  storming the courthouse, screaming that they want GMO labeling.
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:38.560]  The local stores, these little independent local grocery stores are getting letters
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:42.560]  and people coming in, swarming in saying, we want you to label your GMOs independently,
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:44.560]  slapping their own GMO labeling stickers on the food.
[02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:49.560]  And here this is from Minnesota, right, the most unlikely state possible.
[02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:55.560]  But just as we saw with Vermont, just one state pushing on the legislation with us actually as activists
[02:38:55.560 --> 02:38:59.560]  and as researchers and as intellectual thinkers pushing it forward and forward and forward,
[02:38:59.560 --> 02:39:02.560]  we can attain the victory over Monsanto.
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:07.560]  Even though they are actually the ones that falsified through a subgroup,
[02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:12.560]  they used an FDA quote for Prop 37, which was California's labeling initiative,
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:17.560]  that said GMOs are perfectly safe and natural and they use the FDA logo on it.
[02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:21.560]  And this is one of their many, many dirty tricks that they use time and time and time again
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:25.560]  to defeat this labeling legislation because they know that they can't actually argue the facts.
[02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:28.560]  That's why they have armies of trolls, as we talked about yesterday.
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:32.560]  Entire departments paid to go online and discredit scientists.
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:35.560]  So as a matter of fact, they're losing the battle and they know it
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:39.560]  and this is just further proof with the dark act that we must now stop.
[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:41.560]  It's very, very concerning to see this.
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:49.560]  I mean, in Hawaii, this last election, they had a ballot initiative where the farmers in one area said,
[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:53.560]  you're trespassing onto our organic farms, onto our heirloom products here
[02:39:53.560 --> 02:39:57.560]  with your genetically modified organisms, Monsanto, that you're farming.
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:00.560]  So they shut that down as part of a referendum.
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:03.560]  Now they're using a federal judge to basically overrule that.
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:07.560]  You've got movements within the states like Minnesota and Vermont.
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:09.560]  It's already passed to try to shut it down at the state level.
[02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:13.560]  So now what they do, they take it to the Congress and try to run this act through.
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:17.560]  This is something from a Kansas Republican representative, Mike Pompeo,
[02:40:17.560 --> 02:40:21.560]  who is trying to ram this through to keep this all secret
[02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:24.560]  because they know people don't want to see it, don't want it.
[02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:27.560]  And yet we see the same thing is happening with the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:28.560]  Transatlantic Partnership.
[02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:32.560]  If they can't get it shut down at the federal level, they keep going up higher and higher up the pyramid
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:36.560]  because they have to buy off fewer and fewer people if they do that.
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:39.560]  So now they're going to do it at the global level as well.
[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:41.560]  We've got to fight this battle at every single level.
[02:40:41.560 --> 02:40:46.560]  We've heard from farmers time and time again about GMO contamination, how it's ruining their life.
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:52.560]  They're actually going bankrupt because what happens is they test all of the organic USDA organic crops
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:55.560]  and the produce and everything like that before they ship it out for market, right?
[02:40:55.560 --> 02:41:02.560]  So if you're an organic farmer and your next door neighbor is a Monsanto GMO farmer using Roundup and Garbage like that,
[02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:06.560]  if some of his GMO seeds contaminate your field systems, which is very likely,
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:11.560]  in fact, I've heard reports of trucks going around with GMO seeds dousing it on the organic fields
[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:14.560]  and apparently in his video that too, that's coming out.
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:18.560]  Anyway, then they get tested and there's GMO contamination in the organic crops
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:22.560]  and it's rejected by the USDA in many cases if they're doing their job.
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:26.560]  So the independent farmer then gets rejected and has to sell either as GMO or conventional
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:33.560]  because he has a small.01% contamination amount in his organic crop and he's sent out of business.
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:38.560]  And then flip side, even the GMO farmers like the ones in India, they go over in India,
[02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:42.560]  these independent poor farmers and they sell them contracts with Monsanto
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:46.560]  basically owning them in response for planting GMO seeds.
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:51.560]  And then what happens is a farmer suicide every 30 minutes in India, every 30 minutes,
[02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:54.560]  mainly according to many reports due to Monsanto.
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:57.560]  So they're going in forcing them to sign their lives over
[02:41:57.560 --> 02:42:02.560]  and then they're drinking the bio pesticides that Monsanto supplies them symbolically
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:05.560]  because they're financially ruined and their families leave them and they die of starvation.
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:09.560]  Their children are dying of starvation, so they kill themselves.
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:12.560]  The same thing we see happening even with John Deere coming in and saying,
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:15.560]  you don't own your tractors anymore, that's what they're doing to the farmers in India.
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:20.560]  They come in, they hook them on this genetically modified these crops.
[02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:23.560]  These guys can't make any money, they're no longer operating for themselves anymore,
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:26.560]  they no longer own anything, that's the issue.
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:31.560]  And just as we saw with these cross-contamination of crops that went before the Supreme Court
[02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:35.560]  and of course the Supreme Court said, no, it's not a trespass, which is the way I would look at it.
[02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:41.560]  They say, no, these people are stealing the copyrighted GMO organisms from Monsanto.
[02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:47.560]  That's the way they did it. But of course, remember that Clarence Thomas was a former lawyer for Monsanto.
[02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:51.560]  We've also got the head of the FDA used to work for Monsanto.
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:55.560]  So they're very well connected and they can spread that money around in Washington.
[02:42:55.560 --> 02:42:59.560]  Let's go to some of our callers. Let's talk to Ron in Vermont. Ron?
[02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:02.560]  Yeah, hi, how are you today?
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:04.560]  Doing good.
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:13.560]  You know, Alex Jones once said, what would it take for you to get involved in this fight?
[02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:19.560]  And in Vermont, that happened today.
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:29.560]  Vermont legislature is very close to passing or removing the philosophical exemption for vaccines.
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:35.560]  And the Senate approved of it 18 to 11.
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:40.560]  And I asked, you know, what senators actually voted for and against it.
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:48.560]  And it was a division call, which means that it was just an A&Y.
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:52.560]  It wasn't an individual vote.
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:58.560]  So I can't even find out who voted for it and who voted against it.
[02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:01.560]  Let me ask you this, Ron, because I think it's very interesting.
[02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:04.560]  We're just talking about how Vermont became the first state to have mandatory GMO labeling.
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:08.560]  And of course, the idea behind that is that you should know what's going into your food.
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:13.560]  And yet when it comes to vaccines, you'll see many of the people, a lot of them will be in the Democrat Party.
[02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:20.560]  They would fight for GMO labeling and yet they would fight to mandate that you have no right to be informed
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:23.560]  or have consent about what goes into injections.
[02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:31.560]  I mean, how do you explain that kind of double-think is the way I would characterize it?
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:36.560]  I'm terrified of this because, you know, what will happen next?
[02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:38.560]  Will they start mandating?
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:43.560]  Once they have a mandate on vaccines, then will they say, you know what?
[02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:47.560]  You are these people who are mentally ill.
[02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:53.560]  Now we have a mood-altering vaccine and you will be forced to take that.
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:59.560]  I mean, this goes, this is very Orwellian and scares the hell out of me.
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:04.560]  We really need to, you know, put the stake in the ground.
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:06.560]  For me, this is it.
[02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:15.560]  I'm ready to get my signs out, stand on, you know, some of the biggest street corners and start, you know,
[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:20.560]  getting my bullhorn out because this is very scary.
[02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:26.560]  I have a relative who was in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany.
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:35.560]  And she was interviewed by, you know, the director for Schindler's List to make that movie.
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:45.560]  And what we are seeing are the same things that were happening then. It's more dangerous now.
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:47.560]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:53.560]  When they looked at the abuses that happened, of course, those abuses were being done by Joseph Mengele and others saying that,
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:56.560]  yeah, we're doing these horrific experiments, but it's for the greater good of humanity.
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:03.560]  Because what we learn by torturing and killing these people, we will use that to produce better products down the line
[02:46:03.560 --> 02:46:05.560]  to help other people's health.
[02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:09.560]  And so at the Nuremberg trials, they came up with the Nuremberg Code and they said,
[02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:14.560]  it is absolutely essential that you retain informed consent in order to keep this type of thing from happening.
[02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:18.560]  But that's now precisely what they're trying to destroy throughout the United States.
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:21.560]  And it's also a global effort. Your comments, Anthony.
[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:25.560]  We are in an abusive relationship with our government.
[02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:28.560]  We're in an abusive relationship with our food supply.
[02:46:28.560 --> 02:46:32.560]  And what that means is we keep bringing upon ourselves over and over and over again.
[02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:40.560]  Just because we are continually supporting people like Hillary Clinton who openly supported Monsanto in an interview.
[02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:42.560]  It was in 2013, one of them.
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:46.560]  But we also know she's lobbied for them and worked actually alongside of them multiple times.
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:51.560]  But directly saying that Monsanto was great and it's of the future and everything like that.
[02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:57.560]  So why are we allowing these people in our lives and allowing these people to continue to abuse us over and over again
[02:46:57.560 --> 02:47:00.560]  when we know history is repeating over and over and over?
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:05.560]  That's why we have made a decision and ultimately the public is alerting itself to the reality of this.
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:10.560]  And that's why we have things like with what's going on Vermont and now 12 other states pushing for GMO labeling.
[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:13.560]  And I think we can, in fact, defeat this dark act.
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:17.560]  But we're going to have to accept that we're in an abusive relationship and step out of it.
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:24.560]  If we don't defeat it, we are going into a dark age because I tell you, if you don't have any say so over,
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:30.560]  not only, I mean, this began with things like forcing people to buy healthcare insurance and anything with Obamacare.
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:36.560]  I mean, the model for the 21st century corporatism is to hold a gun to your head and say buy it or else.
[02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:42.560]  And if they can do that with insurance and then go to do it with medicine and do it with food, we are done.
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:45.560]  So we are in the fight for our life. That is true. Thank you, Ron.
[02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:49.560]  Let's go to Lee in Minnesota. Lee?
[02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:53.560]  Good afternoon. David, Anthony, how are you doing?
[02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:55.560]  Doing good. Great. What'd you want to talk about?
[02:47:55.560 --> 02:48:02.560]  Good. Good. I just wanted to give you guys and your listeners an update of what's been happening with Minnesota,
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:04.560]  especially on the vaccine issue.
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:16.560]  And they've had the hearing on Minnesota Senate file 380 to remove, to make exemptions more difficult.
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:26.560]  And I wanted to tell the listeners out there that we have a great chance of defeating this here in Minnesota.
[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:34.560]  And I also wanted to let you know that it is very important for everyone to film every committee hearing
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:49.560]  because unexpectedly, the audio file for the committee hearing accidentally got lost.
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:51.560]  Oh, gee, that's a shame.
[02:48:51.560 --> 02:49:01.560]  And it took me tons and tons of pressure to put on the Secretary of the Senate and many, many of the senators.
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:06.560]  And my senator and representative has been ignoring me.
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:13.560]  But finally, they did amend the minutes to admit it was accidentally lost.
[02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:20.560]  Just like Nixon's tapes. Yeah, exactly. Go ahead.
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:26.560]  And so we have a great chance of defeating this. It's a past committee in the Senate.
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:34.560]  The House probably won't be heard and it's not going to be attached to an omnibus bill.
[02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:40.560]  So people keep up the pressure. We can stop the push for forced vaccines.
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:46.560]  I wanted to ask Anthony a question. His thoughts on the whole label GMO movement is possibly a red herring.
[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:52.560]  I think that because of what's happening in Europe, they don't push the GMOs over there so much.
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:57.560]  But here they want to label it. Why don't we just...
[02:49:57.560 --> 02:50:01.560]  And David, you talked about many of the points that I was thinking already.
[02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:04.560]  So I felt like you were reading my mind there.
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:08.560]  Well, I think you're asking why are they labeling it instead of banning it. Is that your question?
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:11.560]  Yes, banned glyphosate. Yes, exactly.
[02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:15.560]  Well, you bring up a good point. Obviously, as we talked about a little bit yesterday,
[02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:19.560]  I think the main issue with GMOs beyond not knowing what they're doing
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:24.560]  and knowing they're destroying kidney function and liver function is the key element of glyphosate,
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:28.560]  which Monsanto has the patent for and puts in their number one best selling herbicide roundup,
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:33.560]  which is integrated into GMO crops. Obviously, a ban would be the best systems.
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:36.560]  But in the United States, we're so heavily controlled, if we could get labeling,
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:41.560]  they may actually financially not be able to produce as many GMOs with Monsanto continuing to lose money,
[02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:43.560]  and we could defund them.
[02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:46.560]  Yes, absolutely. We're going to be right back with your calls. Thank you, Lee.
[02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:52.560]  And we're going to be right back after the break talking about GMOs as well as vaccines.
[02:51:16.560 --> 02:51:19.560]  100 times more effective than those other silvers.
[02:51:19.560 --> 02:51:25.560]  It's powerful enough to protect you and your family from the threat of deadly viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[02:51:25.560 --> 02:51:29.560]  But it's so safe that it can be used internally or topically.
[02:51:29.560 --> 02:51:33.560]  And you'll never again deal with the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics.
[02:51:33.560 --> 02:51:38.560]  Hundreds of scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, and research institutions
[02:51:38.560 --> 02:51:44.560]  have all shown supernatural silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against invading pathogens.
[02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:47.560]  Supernatural silver is a must-have for your arsenal.

[02:51:58.560 --> 02:52:01.560]  I am Artinie. I will help review this line, line, line.
[02:52:01.560 --> 02:52:07.560]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula
[02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:10.560]  that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:52:10.560 --> 02:52:13.560]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:52:13.560 --> 02:52:17.560]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:23.560]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:28.560]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:34.560]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:52:34.560 --> 02:52:39.560]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children
[02:52:39.560 --> 02:52:42.560]  to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:47.560]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm
[02:52:47.560 --> 02:52:49.560]  and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:53:06.560 --> 02:53:07.560]  Down to earth.

[02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:10.560]  Down to earth seeds.
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:12.560]  No hybrids, no GMOs.
[02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:16.560]  Just proven old time seed varieties grown all over the country by our grandparents.

[02:53:53.560 --> 02:54:14.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:14.560 --> 02:54:17.560]  I'm David Knight and joining me in the studio is Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:19.560]  We're going to go back to your calls in just a moment.
[02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:28.560]  Just want to remind you that we have free shipping on X2, survival, super mail, oxy powder, and silver bullet right now at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:34.560]  That's the nascent iodine X2, super mail vitality, oxy powder, and silver bullet.
[02:54:34.560 --> 02:54:35.560]  Also, we have some specials.
[02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:42.560]  If you get two bottles of X2 or two bottles of silver bullet, you can get a free bottle of fluoride shield.
[02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:44.560]  That's one way to protect yourself against fluoride.
[02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:51.560]  You can try to filter your water and we do sell excellent filters that take that and glyphosate out at the InfowarsStore.com.
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:56.560]  But you're going to get exposed to fluoride in this environment that we live in, everywhere in America.
[02:54:56.560 --> 02:54:59.560]  So that's one way that you can protect your body with fluoride shield.
[02:54:59.560 --> 02:55:00.560]  And you can try that now.
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:04.560]  Get a free bottle of that when you buy two bottles of X2 or silver bullet.
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:09.560]  And of course, there's free shipping on a wide variety of products right now at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:10.560]  Let's go back to your calls.
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:12.560]  Let's go to Peggy in Texas.
[02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:14.560]  Peggy?
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:20.560]  Yes, I'd like to alert you and all your listeners to something I just found out last night.
[02:55:20.560 --> 02:55:24.560]  I bought some fish at the store and I read the label after I got home.
[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:31.560]  The fish is preserved by using carbon monoxide to preserve the color.
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:32.560]  I was shocked.
[02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:36.560]  Why would people do something so crazy?
[02:55:36.560 --> 02:55:39.560]  Well, you know what's even more concerning with fish?
[02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:44.560]  Is that most of the salmon you're eating isn't actually a bright pink of that color.
[02:55:44.560 --> 02:55:46.560]  That's actually a food dye system.
[02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:50.560]  And seriously, it actually looks brown, which is fine.
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:55.560]  It's just like when you eat fruits that have little holes in them or something like that because they're super high quality organic.
[02:55:55.560 --> 02:55:56.560]  That's normal.
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:05.560]  But for some reason, we've been determined in getting these pristine looking apples and this fish that's super beautiful and pink and everything like that.
[02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:10.560]  And what they've done is they've started to do all these invasive processes where they're layering it with chemicals.
[02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:14.560]  They're layering it with dyes that are based on tar systems.
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:23.560]  And they're putting those synthetic petroleum based chemicals like vitamins into the food so they can say it's fortified with calcium and they can say it's fortified with vitamin E.
[02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:25.560]  So you think it's actually good for you.
[02:56:25.560 --> 02:56:31.560]  It's become an abomination system in this whole new paradigm of chemical living.
[02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:35.560]  Absolutely. They're doing the craziest things to all your food. You'd be surprised.
[02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:38.560]  They radiate a lot of the spices that you're buying at the store.
[02:56:38.560 --> 02:56:40.560]  Well, they radiate everything.
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:47.560]  But specifically, they have a little symbol now touting how great it is saying, oh my God, it's been radiated for your protection.
[02:56:47.560 --> 02:56:49.560]  Just like Alex talked about one day on the show.
[02:56:49.560 --> 02:56:52.560]  It was like Papa John's pizza he found somewhere.
[02:56:52.560 --> 02:56:58.560]  And the little seasoning packets had a huge little green leaf and it sort of radiated for your protection.
[02:56:58.560 --> 02:56:59.560]  That's what's going on.
[02:56:59.560 --> 02:57:01.560]  Well, of course, they do everything to it.
[02:57:01.560 --> 02:57:12.560]  They will put known carcinogens in your soda to turn it brown as if that's some kind of a selling point or add carcinogens to preserve the food because the bacteria won't eat that.
[02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:14.560]  They won't save them one cent.
[02:57:14.560 --> 02:57:15.560]  So you might as well do it.
[02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:16.560]  Absolutely.
[02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:20.560]  Thanks. Let's go to Julie in Texas. Go ahead, Julie.
[02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:22.560]  Thank you, David.
[02:57:22.560 --> 02:57:29.560]  There is a soil scientist and cell biologist up in Canada named Dr. Therry Brain.
[02:57:29.560 --> 02:57:41.560]  And he has made the point that he really believes GMOs as bad as they really are are red herring just to cover up the issue around glyphosates.
[02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:56.560]  Obviously, glyphosates can be used extensively repeatedly on GMO crops, but it's also used as a desiccant on many, many types of grain that is not necessarily GMO.
[02:57:56.560 --> 02:57:59.560]  So if you're eating a grain, it's not organic.
[02:57:59.560 --> 02:58:07.560]  It's quite possible that you're consuming even more glyphosate than you would be on said GMO vegetable.
[02:58:07.560 --> 02:58:11.560]  You're right. And I've actually been saying this for a long time. I think that's true to a very large extent.
[02:58:11.560 --> 02:58:13.560]  I think GMOs themselves are dangerous.
[02:58:13.560 --> 02:58:20.560]  But the glyphosate, as the World Health Organization now admits, is the carcinogen that it's really getting us and really killing us and really giving us cancer.
[02:58:20.560 --> 02:58:24.560]  So is it a red herring? I don't know about that, but it's definitely overlooked.
[02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:26.560]  Well, that's it for today's broadcast.
[02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:29.560]  Join us tonight for the nightly news at 7 Central.
[02:58:29.560 --> 02:58:33.560]  And again, join us on Sunday. Alex Jones will be back at 4 Central.
[02:58:33.560 --> 02:58:38.560]  Join us next.
[02:59:04.560 --> 02:59:07.560]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:59:07.560 --> 02:59:13.560]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:59:13.560 --> 02:59:18.560]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
