[00:00.000 --> 00:26.400]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:26.400 --> 00:32.760]  The main weapon being deployed against us by the would-be New World Order is slight
[00:32.760 --> 00:37.400]  of hand, distraction, and fakery.
[00:37.400 --> 00:43.520]  And we can see its effectiveness in the recent Johnny Depp trial, meaningless drivel to feed
[00:43.520 --> 00:49.760]  humanity while we are literally being killed by criminal gangs posing as governments.
[00:49.760 --> 00:52.520]  And almost everybody takes a bite.
[00:52.520 --> 00:58.840]  As a human being, one must always factor in the tendency to be fooled and focus on what
[00:58.840 --> 01:00.120]  we know.
[01:00.120 --> 01:04.560]  And so, what do we know so far about monkeypox?
[01:04.560 --> 01:09.680]  We know that after Bill Gates warned of an impending terrorist attack involving a synthetic
[01:09.680 --> 01:15.840]  smallpox in 2017, two new monkeypox vaccines were developed.
[01:15.840 --> 01:22.280]  Both admittedly dangerous, known to cause infection, vaccine shedding, and death.
[01:22.280 --> 01:25.280]  And both have been approved by the FDA.
[01:25.280 --> 01:29.440]  And we know that they have been planning for a monkeypox outbreak.
[01:29.440 --> 01:36.120]  Just as the event 201 simulation war-gamed COVID-19 the year prior, or as Bill Gates
[01:36.120 --> 01:43.040]  calls it, germ-gamed, in the spring of last year, the U.S. held a monkeypox pandemic simulation
[01:43.040 --> 01:49.720]  exercise with the non-profit Nuclear Threat Initiative that predicted a monkeypox bioattack
[01:49.720 --> 01:52.440]  in June of this year.
[01:52.440 --> 01:59.040]  During that same time, the U.K. Ministry of Defense simulated a monkeypox outbreak, focusing
[01:59.040 --> 02:00.240]  on Russian disinfo.
[02:00.240 --> 02:04.560]  And what do we know about monkeypox?
[02:04.560 --> 02:11.400]  Monkeypox was first discovered in 1958 within colonies of laboratory research monkeys who
[02:11.400 --> 02:14.360]  were being given the polio vaccine.
[02:14.360 --> 02:20.400]  And according to the CDC, the only symptom that distinguishes monkeypox from smallpox
[02:20.400 --> 02:27.560]  is lymphadenopathy, swollen lymph nodes, which is also a smallpox vaccine side effect, and
[02:27.560 --> 02:33.000]  is known to be a symptom of smallpox, as well as chickenpox.
[02:33.000 --> 02:39.720]  Electron microscope visualization cannot prove a smallpox infection because allpox viruses
[02:39.720 --> 02:42.840]  are morphologically indistinguishable.
[02:42.840 --> 02:49.360]  According to actual science, there is a strong argument that smallpox, monkeypox, chickenpox,
[02:49.360 --> 02:54.560]  and shingles are all the same thing, and there is no actual proof that they are different.
[02:54.560 --> 03:01.840]  We are simply expected to trust the CDC and their logical fallacies as so-called evidence.
[03:01.840 --> 03:07.840]  And so in 1958, when virologists were likely seeing side effects on lab monkeys they were
[03:07.840 --> 03:13.560]  injecting with experimental vaccines, they called it monkeypox, and claimed it was an
[03:13.560 --> 03:19.680]  ancient rare virus that they had just discovered, which coincidentally showed up in humans for
[03:19.680 --> 03:22.560]  the first time in 1970.
[03:22.560 --> 03:29.520]  And by 1978, without any proof of its existence, scientific journals were already saying that
[03:29.520 --> 03:35.240]  vaccination is an effective preventative measure against monkeypox.
[03:35.240 --> 03:41.640]  Just three months ago, the famous Wuhan lab, who allegedly created COVID-19, published
[03:41.640 --> 03:47.760]  a paper claiming they assembled a monkeypox virus genome, which will enable for successful
[03:47.760 --> 03:53.080]  PCR testing, and potentially make it more contagious.
[03:53.080 --> 04:00.120]  And so, just as the PCR tests were used to create false positives by misreading the flu,
[04:00.120 --> 04:07.360]  the common cold, and even fruit as COVID-19, they will now be used to create false positives
[04:07.360 --> 04:13.480]  for monkeypox, whether you are experiencing vaccine side effects, or common herpes, or
[04:13.480 --> 04:16.240]  even asymptomatic monkeypox.
[04:16.240 --> 04:22.760]  And finally, we know that the media is the real virus, and when the media puts out the
[04:22.760 --> 04:29.560]  fear, their followers will eagerly line up to get the new dangerous vaccines and insist
[04:29.560 --> 04:31.880]  that you do the same.
[04:31.880 --> 05:00.240]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.

[05:59.600 --> 06:17.600]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility, against every form of tyranny over
[06:17.600 --> 06:23.040]  the mind of man, Thomas Jefferson.
[06:23.040 --> 06:26.200]  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[06:26.200 --> 06:29.600]  I'm Harrison Smith, sitting in momentarily for Alex Jones.
[06:29.600 --> 06:37.600]  He had a family engagement that he's doing right now, so he'll be in within the hour,
[06:37.600 --> 06:41.480]  the bottom of the hour, maybe 30 or 45 minutes, but I'm just going to cover some of the news
[06:41.480 --> 06:46.040]  here in the meantime, but he is on his way, and he's got some stuff to say about some
[06:46.040 --> 06:51.520]  of the news, came out yesterday, some of what we've learned about the Uvaldi shooter and
[06:51.520 --> 06:59.320]  the actual shooting as it took place and as it went down and how the police acted, incredibly
[06:59.320 --> 07:04.480]  troubling video coming out showing the parents desperately trying to get the police to go
[07:04.480 --> 07:09.880]  in and save their children as the sound of gunshots rings out from within the building
[07:09.880 --> 07:14.720]  and the police are holding these people back, actually taking their tasers out and threatening
[07:14.720 --> 07:21.920]  the parents of children with tasers and pinning them on the ground as the shooter rampages
[07:21.920 --> 07:24.840]  inside, crazy stuff.
[07:24.840 --> 07:29.400]  Now I'm the host of the American Journal, our morning show here on InfoWars, so I spent
[07:29.400 --> 07:34.680]  quite a while going through this footage and breaking it down and talking about some of
[07:34.680 --> 07:39.880]  what we can conclude from what we're learning all throughout the program today, so I won't
[07:39.880 --> 07:43.000]  spend too much time on that because I know Alex is going to cover that quite a bit as
[07:43.000 --> 07:53.160]  well, but fortunately for us there is no shortage of horrific news on a daily basis.
[07:53.160 --> 07:57.920]  So we'll be talking about a little bit of other stuff here and we'll leave it to Alex
[07:57.920 --> 08:03.760]  Jones to break down exactly what is to be learned from the inaction by the police yesterday.
[08:03.760 --> 08:09.280]  I actually had some supporters on Twitter contact me and saying, don't fall into the
[08:09.280 --> 08:17.000]  anti-police messaging of how this is being reported, it's only contributing to the Defund
[08:17.000 --> 08:21.200]  the Police program, it's the exact opposite as far as I see it.
[08:21.200 --> 08:25.480]  The Defund the Police program means two things, it means privatizing the police, those who
[08:25.480 --> 08:29.920]  can pay for it will still have protection, those who cannot afford it will be left on
[08:29.920 --> 08:34.120]  their own and without any defense whatsoever.
[08:34.120 --> 08:38.040]  And federalizing the police, that's the other issue, is that you get rid of the local police
[08:38.040 --> 08:43.280]  departments and that allows you to justify the creation of federal police departments
[08:43.280 --> 08:48.160]  and in my interpretation of what happened in Uvalde that was the issue, is that the
[08:48.160 --> 08:55.120]  local police were waiting around, excuse me, for the federal police to come in and provide
[08:55.120 --> 08:57.200]  oversight and give them instructions.
[08:57.200 --> 09:01.480]  It turns out the person that actually killed the shooter, the Border Patrol agent, was
[09:01.480 --> 09:06.240]  acting without orders, he just went in on his own, he refused to wait for instructions
[09:06.240 --> 09:10.280]  and just took it upon himself to go in and save, God knows how many children, by putting
[09:10.280 --> 09:18.080]  down the shooter after, of course, 19 had already been killed.
[09:18.080 --> 09:26.880]  I mean, I guess it's a testament to the modern American world where the news of 19 children
[09:26.880 --> 09:33.960]  being slaughtered by single gunmen isn't the worst case scenario, like showing up to a
[09:33.960 --> 09:37.440]  school and finding out that your 10 year old child has been killed, you would think would
[09:37.440 --> 09:40.920]  be the worst thing you could possibly imagine.
[09:40.920 --> 09:45.240]  That's only because it boggles the mind and defies imagination to imagine showing up to
[09:45.240 --> 09:50.520]  a school where your 10 year old is alive, just to be held outside of it by the police
[09:50.520 --> 09:52.960]  while the murder takes place inside.
[09:52.960 --> 09:58.520]  That somehow is even more horrific, the news just gets worse and worse and worse.
[09:58.520 --> 10:01.280]  It's incredibly troubling.
[10:01.280 --> 10:08.560]  But again, I'll leave that up to Alex Jones to do the deep dive investigation into that
[10:08.560 --> 10:12.360]  and explain exactly what that's all about, because after all, there's other stories to
[10:12.360 --> 10:19.880]  cover as well, including this one, which, again, it's the type of thing where they're
[10:19.880 --> 10:24.920]  just doing this sort of stuff now, it used to be the type of thing where only Info Wars
[10:24.920 --> 10:29.280]  would report on things like this, we'd be the only ones that cared about it, it would
[10:29.280 --> 10:33.400]  be all secret and we'd have to go in and figure out what was really going on.
[10:33.400 --> 10:34.400]  Times have changed.
[10:34.400 --> 10:39.960]  Now, they're establishing world government, they're very open and proud about that.
[10:39.960 --> 10:46.560]  The world elites are now gathered in Davos and Geneva in a joint or parallel World Health
[10:46.560 --> 10:52.880]  Organization and World Economic Forum meetings where they are quite openly describing the
[10:52.880 --> 10:57.920]  methods and means by which they will control the entire global population in a technocratic
[10:57.920 --> 11:04.040]  control grid that uses financial levers and digital currency controlled by a central bank
[11:04.040 --> 11:11.360]  to dictate what you deserve to do, who you deserve to go interact with, how far you're
[11:11.360 --> 11:14.640]  able to travel, what you're able to buy and eat.
[11:14.640 --> 11:20.640]  All of this will be very minutely controlled by people flying private jets and eating big
[11:20.640 --> 11:24.240]  steak dinners every night because they're worth it, because they've earned it, because
[11:24.240 --> 11:28.760]  they're doing so much to fight back against climate change, they can have a little extra
[11:28.760 --> 11:31.280]  carbon to help them along the way.
[11:31.280 --> 11:37.040]  It's a complete and total scam, world government is their espoused desire and now they're laying
[11:37.040 --> 11:42.640]  down the mechanisms by which they will achieve that goal.
[11:42.640 --> 11:47.200]  It's not a conspiracy theory, it's just conspiracy.
[11:47.200 --> 11:50.400]  Although back in the day they would have had to hide this and this is the really amazing
[11:50.400 --> 11:51.400]  thing about the globalists.
[11:51.400 --> 11:54.320]  This is their great achievement over the last several years.
[11:54.320 --> 12:00.200]  They have somehow been able to trick the people of the world and in particular the American
[12:00.200 --> 12:05.280]  people into thinking that what they're up to in their secret little conclaves is somehow
[12:05.280 --> 12:10.040]  for the benefit of them, for the benefit of the citizens.
[12:10.040 --> 12:11.040]  It's really amazing.
[12:11.040 --> 12:14.440]  It used to be a time where you said, yeah, these elites get together and they plot what
[12:14.440 --> 12:19.520]  they're going to do and they plan together and they coordinate an unelected, super national,
[12:19.520 --> 12:27.880]  secret controlled cabals and you're told that's crazy, that's insane, that doesn't happen.
[12:27.880 --> 12:32.320]  Now you're told it does happen, they do do this, they do get together, they are planning
[12:32.320 --> 12:38.320]  world events, they are plotting how to enslave the earth, it's just, it's for your own good.
[12:38.320 --> 12:42.160]  It's because they love you so much.
[12:42.160 --> 12:46.520]  It's really, you want to talk about sleight of hand, like that Gregory's report.
[12:46.520 --> 12:51.080]  This is something else entirely.
[12:51.080 --> 12:52.080]  Something else entirely.
[12:52.080 --> 12:56.000]  And of course one of the things, one of their main mechanisms of control is censorship,
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.000]  is control of information.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.640]  And it is an information war, I don't know if you've heard of this yet, but it's an
[13:00.640 --> 13:06.760]  info war we're engaged in and of course they're still pursuing the Disinformation Governance
[13:06.760 --> 13:07.760]  Board.
[13:07.760 --> 13:12.440]  I don't know if you caught this, but we reported on it on the day that it was announced that
[13:12.440 --> 13:15.240]  Nina Jankiewicz was retiring from the Disinformation Board.
[13:15.240 --> 13:19.920]  And Disinformation Governance Board is no more, we did it, victory, we got rid of the
[13:19.920 --> 13:20.920]  Governance Board.
[13:20.920 --> 13:24.120]  But of course we actually listened to what the White House was saying and read what their
[13:24.120 --> 13:27.080]  reports were and it was like, no, this isn't going anywhere.
[13:27.080 --> 13:28.080]  It hasn't gone anywhere.
[13:28.080 --> 13:32.800]  They literally said, standing in front of the press room in the White House, they said
[13:32.800 --> 13:36.480]  the work will continue behind the scenes, it'll just be less public.
[13:36.480 --> 13:40.280]  There's too much backlash with all of the public knowing what we're doing, so we'll continue
[13:40.280 --> 13:46.600]  to do it in secret, that's how we respond to anger and outrage when it's discovered
[13:46.600 --> 13:47.600]  what we're involved in.
[13:47.600 --> 13:52.600]  And of course they turned it over from Nina Jankiewicz to, you know, the guy that wrote
[13:52.600 --> 13:57.720]  the Patriot Act, Chertav, Michael Chertav is his name.
[13:57.720 --> 14:02.280]  He looks like a vampire and he's acts like one too and now he's in charge of the Disinformation
[14:02.280 --> 14:04.680]  Governance Board.
[14:04.680 --> 14:09.400]  And with the latest action by Big Tech we see what the real point of all of this censorship
[14:09.400 --> 14:10.400]  is.
[14:10.400 --> 14:14.280]  This is not going to be news to the InfoWars audience, but it has nothing to do with misinformation
[14:14.280 --> 14:15.280]  or disinformation.
[14:15.280 --> 14:16.280]  It has to do with information.
[14:16.280 --> 14:22.840]  It has to do with stopping you from discovering, certainly from speaking back against what
[14:22.840 --> 14:25.360]  the deep state is up to.
[14:25.360 --> 14:30.200]  And the latest proof of this can be found at InfoWars.
[14:30.200 --> 14:35.920]  The title of the article is YouTube, censor's tape of Obama officials from 2014 planning
[14:35.920 --> 14:39.440]  Ukrainian coup after eight years.
[14:39.440 --> 14:47.160]  It's not disinformation, it's not misinformation, it is in fact a verbatim recording of Victoria
[14:47.160 --> 14:52.520]  Newland who at the time was the Under Secretary of State coordinating and picking and choosing
[14:52.520 --> 14:56.520]  who would rule Ukraine.
[14:56.520 --> 15:01.640]  Completely destroying the concept of Ukraine as some sort of independent democracy when
[15:01.640 --> 15:09.960]  you have the elites of America, I mean just quite literally, I'm trying to say the word
[15:09.960 --> 15:13.640]  literally, but I mean they're literally picking and choosing who's going to rule Ukraine.
[15:13.640 --> 15:17.400]  So Victoria Newland saying no, not him, no, not him, yeah, he's on our side, we'll put
[15:17.400 --> 15:22.200]  him in charge and we'll have these guys operate and this guy will go do this, like chess pieces
[15:22.200 --> 15:30.440]  on a board maneuvering for their own aims and pursuit of their own goals.
[15:30.440 --> 15:33.200]  That's what's been removed from YouTube.
[15:33.200 --> 15:39.400]  Not disinformation, not misinformation, but real, honest to God, recordings of the United
[15:39.400 --> 15:46.200]  States manipulating the politics of Ukraine long before Russia ever intervened.
[15:46.200 --> 15:50.600]  So do you think censorship was bad before?
[15:50.600 --> 15:53.880]  It's only getting worse folks and it's all about hiding the crimes of the deep state.
[15:53.880 --> 15:56.480]  We'll be back on the other side with a little bit more.
[15:56.480 --> 16:04.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are a lot of natural compounds out there that turbo charge and
[16:04.280 --> 16:10.680]  boost our stamina, our energy, our libido that are also amazing pre or post workouts.
[16:10.680 --> 16:15.680]  And we went out and looked at the top brands, the top reviews and came out with alpha power.
[16:15.680 --> 16:20.760]  Now it's so hard to source good clean herbs like we have in this that it's been sold out
[16:20.760 --> 16:26.800]  for more than six months, but now alpha power is back in stock at infowarstore.com at 40%
[16:26.800 --> 16:27.800]  off.
[16:27.800 --> 16:32.440]  Go to infowarstore.com and read about these compounds and ingredients for yourself and
[16:32.440 --> 16:33.440]  then try it for yourself.

[18:12.440 --> 18:13.440]  out of them.

[18:57.200 --> 19:00.200]  Get yours today.
[19:00.200 --> 19:04.280]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going

[19:07.240 --> 19:12.360]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep

[19:38.280 --> 19:43.480]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower which was traditionally
[19:43.480 --> 19:49.200]  used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities.

[20:00.880 --> 20:10.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:10.880 --> 20:23.840]  All right, welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[20:23.840 --> 20:25.840]  This is Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex Jones.
[20:25.840 --> 20:29.040]  Alex is in the building and he will be joining us very shortly.
[20:29.040 --> 20:32.600]  He'll be likely in the desk at the start of the next segment.
[20:32.600 --> 20:38.480]  So fear not, he is going to come and really break down the new information that is still
[20:38.480 --> 20:42.000]  being revealed about what happened in Uvaldi yesterday.
[20:42.000 --> 20:46.000]  He's got some breaking news when it comes to what exactly happened behind the scenes
[20:46.000 --> 20:52.560]  and why it took so long for police to actually go in and get the shooter while meanwhile
[20:52.560 --> 20:57.760]  you had parents actually discussing and considering bum rushing the police line just to get past
[20:57.760 --> 21:02.880]  them and go try to do something themselves, cannot imagine.
[21:02.880 --> 21:10.520]  I cannot imagine the frustration, honestly it just boggles your mind and the video coming
[21:10.520 --> 21:16.120]  out about this is just some of the most horrific stuff I've ever seen in my entire life.
[21:16.120 --> 21:21.520]  I can't even explain.
[21:21.520 --> 21:22.520]  Hopefully you just get it.
[21:22.520 --> 21:27.080]  You understand what it would be like as a parent to know that your child is in a school
[21:27.080 --> 21:34.320]  with a shooter and yet a cop is holding a taser pointed at you demanding that you not
[21:34.320 --> 21:36.360]  do anything about it.
[21:36.360 --> 21:37.360]  Absolutely unbelievable.
[21:37.360 --> 21:45.920]  But I got to say, just as a quick aside, I am blown away every time I walk into this
[21:45.920 --> 21:46.920]  studio.
[21:46.920 --> 21:50.960]  I do American Journal from the smaller studio that's right next door, right through that
[21:50.960 --> 21:51.960]  wall.
[21:51.960 --> 21:57.880]  But our crew works incredibly hard to bring the graphics and to calibrate the cameras
[21:57.880 --> 22:03.720]  and the behind the scenes stuff that has to take place to put on a show every single
[22:03.720 --> 22:04.720]  day here.
[22:04.720 --> 22:09.640]  We do three live shows with a full crew, with the Jib operators, with the brand new graphics
[22:09.640 --> 22:12.160]  and music for every single episode.
[22:12.160 --> 22:18.040]  Every time I'm done with my show and I finish up and leave the crew is still there and they'll
[22:18.040 --> 22:20.800]  be there for hours tweaking stuff, getting stuff just right.
[22:20.800 --> 22:27.840]  Making sure they're smoothing over any little hiccups that might occur during the show.
[22:27.840 --> 22:28.840]  And it's amazing.
[22:28.840 --> 22:31.440]  And that's just in my little humble American Journal studio.
[22:31.440 --> 22:40.400]  But then I walk in here and I mean it's like stepping into the control room of a battleship
[22:40.400 --> 22:41.400]  or something.
[22:41.400 --> 22:46.080]  It really is impressive and it really does show what we've been able to accomplish despite
[22:46.080 --> 22:51.400]  the attacks continually leveled against us despite the demonization that we go through.
[22:51.400 --> 22:57.000]  The American viewers and the Info Wars audience has come through for us time and time again
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.880]  and we hope that we just repay that loyalty to you by giving you what you expect which
[23:00.880 --> 23:07.120]  is the unvarnished reality of the world that we're in as ugly and as hateful as it seems
[23:07.120 --> 23:12.520]  sometimes you've got to stare that monster in the eyes and take it on and that's what
[23:12.520 --> 23:18.240]  Info Wars does and hopefully we live up to your expectations because you have really
[23:18.240 --> 23:21.840]  come through for us and pulled us through some very difficult times but they're going
[23:21.840 --> 23:25.640]  to be even more difficult times ahead and so we humbly beseech you.

[24:26.360 --> 24:31.560]  great prices and we've got krill oil, which I like to call fish oil's badass older brother,

[24:44.600 --> 24:48.640]  system, your health, if you're working out a lot and you're sore and you think bodies
[24:48.640 --> 24:52.080]  might help you with that, like there's something for you, but even if it's just your everyday
[24:52.080 --> 24:56.880]  purchases like toothpaste, we hope that you can get them from infowarstore.com instead
[24:56.880 --> 25:01.020]  of giving your money to people who despise you and corporations that are actively working
[25:01.020 --> 25:08.440]  towards your downfall, why not shop with the good guys and help to support this totally
[25:08.440 --> 25:14.480]  unique and all important media outlet as we continue to contradict the lies of the mainstream
[25:14.480 --> 25:20.040]  media and fight back against the tyranny of the deep state and the global control being
[25:20.040 --> 25:21.920]  imposed upon us now.
[25:21.920 --> 25:27.680]  And again, you've got Beto O'Rourke making an absolute fool of himself, you've got Barack
[25:27.680 --> 25:33.000]  Obama making sure that we don't get too distracted by the current tragedy that the Democrats
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  are exploiting.
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.880]  He's making sure we don't forget the previous tragedy that they exploited, the George Floyd
[25:38.880 --> 25:44.480]  killing, the George Floyd killing that led to the Black Lives Matter riots that killed
[25:44.480 --> 25:51.560]  dozens and left billions of dollars of structures ruined in their wake and then imposed the
[25:51.560 --> 26:00.720]  defund the police movement on America which led to no less than 2,500 extra deaths strictly
[26:00.720 --> 26:06.320]  in the Black community in a single year.
[26:06.320 --> 26:07.680]  Imagine being a Democrat.
[26:07.680 --> 26:10.160]  Imagine being a Democrat right now.
[26:10.160 --> 26:11.360]  How do you do it, folks?
[26:11.360 --> 26:18.840]  How do you justify supporting policies that time and time again without exception just
[26:18.840 --> 26:23.720]  leave a wake of death?
[26:23.720 --> 26:24.720]  There's Barack Obama.
[26:24.720 --> 26:28.400]  Across the country, parents are putting their children to bed reading stories, singing lullabies
[26:28.400 --> 26:29.400]  in the back of their minds.
[26:29.400 --> 26:31.920]  They're worried about what might happen tomorrow and they drop their kids off at school or
[26:31.920 --> 26:34.760]  take them to a grocery store or any other public space.
[26:34.760 --> 26:36.920]  Yeah, how'd that happen, Barack?
[26:36.920 --> 26:38.920]  It didn't used to be like that, did it?
[26:38.920 --> 26:42.080]  Is it because we're just so much more conservative now?
[26:42.080 --> 26:45.320]  Oh, we just got so much more nationalistic and conservative.
[26:45.320 --> 26:46.680]  Now things are so much worse.
[26:46.680 --> 26:56.280]  Where is it because we have been on a process of liberalization in which our every foundational
[26:56.280 --> 27:04.360]  societal construction is being ripped out by the roots by the Democrats?
[27:04.360 --> 27:09.240]  When Republicans talk about we want to get to the root of the problem, I always say that
[27:09.240 --> 27:12.880]  these mass shootings, they're like a skin legion.
[27:12.880 --> 27:21.320]  They're a scab on your skin that really is a symptom of a cancer that's eating you out
[27:21.320 --> 27:22.320]  from the inside.
[27:22.320 --> 27:27.560]  So you can put a band-aid on the skin legion, but it's not solving the cancer that's killing
[27:27.560 --> 27:28.560]  you.
[27:28.560 --> 27:29.560]  It's just a symptom.
[27:29.560 --> 27:35.720]  It's just the visible part of something, a much deeper and destructive issue at the
[27:35.720 --> 27:36.720]  heart of things.
[27:36.720 --> 27:40.200]  So when Republicans talk about that, what we're talking about is, what's at the heart
[27:40.200 --> 27:46.040]  of this violence is the chaos, the madness, the hopelessness, the division, the hatred
[27:46.040 --> 27:50.960]  that's continually pumped into our country, the lack of support by family.
[27:50.960 --> 27:58.760]  You know, the shooter in Uvaldi, single mother who wasn't around and was addicted to drugs,
[27:58.760 --> 28:04.280]  he's being supported by his grandmother, he has no family, no support system, and that's
[28:04.280 --> 28:11.400]  the case for so many kids in America these days, they're ripe to be turned into a mass
[28:11.400 --> 28:12.400]  killer or something.
[28:12.400 --> 28:13.680]  And what's the democratic solution?
[28:13.680 --> 28:15.600]  Well, we'll put psychiatrists in schools.
[28:15.600 --> 28:17.080]  Oh, is that going to solve it?
[28:17.080 --> 28:19.080]  We'll have social workers.
[28:19.080 --> 28:21.040]  No, social workers can't make up.
[28:21.040 --> 28:28.600]  They cannot compete with a loving household, with a support system and a family, and faith
[28:28.600 --> 28:33.720]  in God, and belief that life is worth living.
[28:33.720 --> 28:36.320]  We can't mandate these things to have the government have these things.
[28:36.320 --> 28:39.120]  So that's what we mean when we say we need to get to the heart of the issue and find
[28:39.120 --> 28:41.440]  out what's really behind all this violence.
[28:41.440 --> 28:46.880]  When the Democrats talk about what's at the heart of the issue, what's the cause of all
[28:46.880 --> 28:50.520]  this, their solution is get rid of the Bill of Rights.
[28:50.520 --> 28:53.880]  They've identified the real problem with America and it's these gosh darned God-given
[28:53.880 --> 28:54.880]  rights we enjoy.
[28:54.880 --> 28:59.520]  If we get rid of those, everything will be great.

[32:03.080 --> 32:07.800]  You have made history in your support of InfoWars and one of the biggest tools we've had to
[32:07.800 --> 32:13.040]  circumvent and override the sensors has been Patriot Apparel so we can identify each other
[32:13.040 --> 32:17.920]  so we can spread the word and so we can push people to websites like InfoWars.com so they
[32:17.920 --> 32:20.560]  can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[32:20.560 --> 32:23.840]  Now ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our
[32:23.840 --> 32:27.560]  designs of t-shirts, some of which go back more than 25 years.
[32:27.560 --> 32:31.320]  All these shirts are limited edition, they are about to be history and will only exist
[32:31.320 --> 32:33.720]  in your closet, your drawer or your wardrobe.
[32:33.720 --> 32:38.640]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left and a couple weeks they'll all
[32:38.640 --> 32:45.040]  be gone and they'll be history, we're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[32:45.040 --> 32:49.360]  So thank you all for your support, please visit infowarstore.com and get one of these
[32:49.360 --> 32:54.160]  historic shirts, hoodies, long sleeves, ball caps, you name it, while you still can.
[32:54.160 --> 33:00.360]  I want to thank you all for your support, infowarstore.com.
[33:00.360 --> 33:11.720]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:11.720 --> 33:23.640]  All right, welcome back folks, Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex Jones, Alex is in the
[33:23.640 --> 33:29.240]  building, he will be in studio next segment, so this will be the final segment with myself.
[33:29.240 --> 33:37.680]  And boys, they're just an infinite amount of stuff to talk about here, Zelensky calls
[33:37.680 --> 33:44.440]  for total help as Russia advances in Ukraine's east, it's like total war but it sounds nicer,
[33:44.440 --> 33:45.440]  I guess.
[33:45.440 --> 33:52.040]  But of course the big topic of today is the new information we're finding out about this
[33:52.040 --> 33:58.680]  shooting that happened in Uvaldi and the failure of the police or at least something happened.
[33:58.680 --> 34:04.240]  There was some sort of little mix up where the police ended up attacking the parents
[34:04.240 --> 34:10.800]  of the children rather than the murderer shooting them and as more details are coming out we
[34:10.800 --> 34:17.080]  see the absolute rage these parents are feeling and it is completely and totally justified.
[34:17.080 --> 34:21.920]  Here's the video, we came to show you the audio because it's just a lot of curse words
[34:21.920 --> 34:30.400]  and a lot of screaming as you can imagine and again Alex Jones is going to break this
[34:30.400 --> 34:35.640]  down in very fine detail but I'll just say that last night I was lying in bed at about
[34:35.640 --> 34:42.680]  11 o'clock, I live in South Austin, pretty safe neighborhood, not too bad but suddenly
[34:42.680 --> 34:47.280]  the night was lit up with a sound of gunfire, rare thing in my neighborhood but there it
[34:47.280 --> 34:51.760]  was, sort of sound like fireworks at first but after a few more rounds you go oh no that's
[34:51.760 --> 34:58.360]  it, that's definitely gunfire and of course I get out a little police scanner app and
[34:58.360 --> 35:04.280]  start listing in and sure enough somebody's called in and reported gunfire in my area.
[35:04.280 --> 35:09.280]  The problem is that Austin is sort of a far left city and we've defunded our police and
[35:09.280 --> 35:15.160]  now if you call 911 in Austin you're likely to be put on hold, that's been the outcome
[35:15.160 --> 35:20.960]  of the defund the police movement and of course what was my reaction to hearing gunshots near
[35:20.960 --> 35:26.240]  my house, I grabbed my gun of course, what a comfort it is knowing that when there's
[35:26.240 --> 35:31.720]  madmen and criminals running around heavily armed and doing God knows what that I don't
[35:31.720 --> 35:40.880]  have to sit and be a useless victim and huddle with my unarmed family as the police take their
[35:40.880 --> 35:45.640]  sweet time to show up, I mean that's the police in this country these days especially in a
[35:45.640 --> 35:51.360]  place like Austin, they're not going to prevent crime, yeah this may have actually been it,
[35:51.360 --> 35:55.400]  man killed by police after trading gunfire with officers in southeast Austin, yeah they
[35:55.400 --> 36:02.400]  were, it went on for about an hour, it was pretty crazy, I'm not sure if this was actually
[36:02.400 --> 36:10.640]  it was this last night at around midnight because that's when it happened to me but again think
[36:10.640 --> 36:15.680]  about what the leftists are promoting, think about what the democrats, the world they're
[36:15.680 --> 36:19.040]  setting up, they want to disarm you but they also want to get rid of the police, the border
[36:19.040 --> 36:23.000]  patrol killed this uvaldi shooter, do you think they're going to celebrate the border
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.240]  patrol and advocate for them, they're trying to get rid of them as well, they want you
[36:26.240 --> 36:32.640]  helpless, they want you completely disarmed and available for abuse because guess what
[36:32.640 --> 36:37.400]  they're planning on doing, I mean can you imagine what 2020 or 2021 would have looked
[36:37.400 --> 36:42.840]  like if the American people had been totally disarmed, I'd probably be sitting in a quarantine
[36:42.840 --> 36:50.800]  camp right now, if I was lucky if I'd survived it, there's a classic meme going around going
[36:50.800 --> 36:55.960]  when the government is trying to take your guns after 243 years it's because they're
[36:55.960 --> 37:03.280]  about to do something that you would want to shoot them for and you know we're human
[37:03.280 --> 37:09.040]  beings, the tragedy as it unfolds in uvaldi, it's like you know just to put yourself in
[37:09.040 --> 37:13.960]  those parents positions, what wouldn't you do right, what wouldn't I do, I would you
[37:13.960 --> 37:18.320]  know if we could prevent little children from being killed, I'd give up my guns, here's
[37:18.320 --> 37:24.280]  the problem, here's a little issue with that, my government is pretty open about wanting
[37:24.280 --> 37:31.200]  to kill me, they're not super shy about wanting to put me in a camp and stick a needle in
[37:31.200 --> 37:37.760]  my arm, so tell you what, while our government is still engaged in openly despising me and
[37:37.760 --> 37:42.880]  wanting to tyrannize me and my family and wanting to throw us in a camp and wanting
[37:42.880 --> 37:48.840]  us wanting to inflict medical experimentation on us, I'm going to go ahead and keep my guns,
[37:48.840 --> 37:54.920]  so until you stop being tyrannical psychopaths, I'm going to keep my guns, once you stop
[37:54.920 --> 38:01.240]  trying to do things that are going to make me want to defend myself, then I'd be willing
[38:01.240 --> 38:08.000]  to talk and come to the table, but for now unfortunately the government's in a position
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.520]  where they're not super shy about wanting to put me in a camp and or just eliminate me,
[38:13.520 --> 38:19.600]  so I'll keep my guns for now, thanks guys, and I would love to just once, I would love
[38:19.600 --> 38:26.080]  for Democrats to have to actually explain the results of their policies, because it's
[38:26.080 --> 38:32.720]  without exception, I can't think of a single leftist government policy that has not completely
[38:32.720 --> 38:36.960]  and totally backfired, like not even just didn't work, that would be one thing, it'd
[38:36.960 --> 38:41.160]  be one thing if you said, oh well, you know, there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot
[38:41.160 --> 38:45.360]  of black Americans dying and we don't like it, so we're going to, you know, put these
[38:45.360 --> 38:49.560]  measures forward, well, we spent a bunch of money and the murder rate's the same, darn
[38:49.560 --> 38:52.440]  it, like that would be understandable, it's like, well, you tried and you failed, nothing
[38:52.440 --> 38:58.640]  happened, no, no, in this case, they get everything they want, we defund the police, 2,500 extra
[38:58.640 --> 39:03.000]  murders in a single year, just a black Americans, like I'm just not counting the white Americans
[39:03.000 --> 39:08.840]  in that number, at the white Americans it's even higher, so just thousands of extra murders,
[39:08.840 --> 39:12.800]  so it's not even like, oh, we tried and nothing happened, no, you tried and made everything
[39:12.800 --> 39:21.280]  exponentially worse, and it happens time after time after time, and again, maybe if it happened
[39:21.280 --> 39:25.320]  all at once, the emotional impact would be there, maybe it's just because it's stretched
[39:25.320 --> 39:31.640]  over a year, 10 murders a day, you know, it's hard to really wrap your mind around that,
[39:31.640 --> 39:40.520]  maybe if we could see in just clear and concise understanding, maybe if those 2,500 people
[39:40.520 --> 39:49.820]  were murdered all at once, we would have the emotional reaction that's appropriate.
[39:49.820 --> 39:54.840]  We understand, you know, the consequences when it's 19 children dying, that's horrific
[39:54.840 --> 40:03.520]  and unimaginable and, you know, we feel it, we get it, but when 100 times that number
[40:03.520 --> 40:07.440]  dies over the course of a year as a direct consequence of leftist policies, I guess we
[40:07.440 --> 40:15.240]  just don't have that impact, but of course it's the same thing time and time again, over
[40:15.240 --> 40:21.080]  and over and over and over, the leftists get what they want, they enact their policies,
[40:21.080 --> 40:29.720]  it makes everything worse, and then of course they blame Republicans, such a simple trick
[40:29.720 --> 40:41.160]  they pull, simple little routine they carry out, cause a problem, create a crisis, use
[40:41.160 --> 40:46.760]  that crisis to create the fear and panic in the people, put forward a supposed solution
[40:46.760 --> 40:52.000]  to the problem, the solution actually has nothing to do with the problem, it just funnels
[40:52.000 --> 40:57.880]  bunch of money into their pocket or expands their programs, the problem just gets worse
[40:57.880 --> 41:01.880]  and then they blame Republicans, I mean, it happened with baby formula shortage, right?
[41:01.880 --> 41:08.040]  Their policies cause a baby formula shortage, their lockdown destroys the supply chain,
[41:08.040 --> 41:14.840]  their FDA goes and forcibly shuts down the baby manufacturer, the baby formula manufacturing
[41:14.840 --> 41:22.720]  plant and then they put forward a bill that's, provide babies with formula, you look in the
[41:22.720 --> 41:26.320]  text of the bill, it's paying for salaries of people in the FDA who are the ones that
[41:26.320 --> 41:29.640]  actually shut down the baby formula in the first place, would do nothing to get baby
[41:29.640 --> 41:33.920]  formula to anybody, wouldn't help anybody at all, so Republicans go, we're not gonna vote
[41:33.920 --> 41:39.880]  on this just cause it has a nice title of the bill, the bill doesn't actually solve anything,
[41:39.880 --> 41:44.640]  but with an uninformed populace, the Democrats then can go out and say, it's your fault for
[41:44.640 --> 41:52.800]  not voting for our bill, you're the ones that cause this, such a simple little deceit that
[41:52.800 --> 41:57.200]  the Democrats are engaged in and of course it's almost most apparent when it comes to
[41:57.200 --> 42:03.920]  black lives matter and crime, black lives matter, black lives matter so much, we destroyed
[42:03.920 --> 42:10.080]  3,000 of them in a single year, more than normal, direct result of Democrat policies
[42:10.080 --> 42:16.440]  and by the way, I don't know if anybody tried to go to an academy or a gun store in 2020,
[42:16.440 --> 42:20.760]  but my God, it was like a bonanza, it was like Beatlemania, but for guns, you couldn't
[42:20.760 --> 42:24.360]  get ammo, you couldn't get guns, people were waiting in line around the corner, I mean
[42:24.360 --> 42:28.800]  if the gun lobby was smart, they'd be sponsoring defund the police, they'd be pouring money
[42:28.800 --> 42:33.360]  into leftist causes, because what inspires people to buy guns is not the NRA or the gun
[42:33.360 --> 42:39.480]  lobby, you Democrat idiots, it's uncertainty and a lack of safety in this country, it's
[42:39.480 --> 42:44.080]  that people feel like they're not being protected, they're gonna have to defend themselves and
[42:44.080 --> 42:48.200]  the Democrats are letting out tens of thousands of criminals onto the street and then defunding
[42:48.200 --> 42:54.000]  the police, yeah, we're gonna wanna have guns, so again, more leftist policies contributing
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.760]  100% to what they blame Republicans for, Alex Jones joins us on the other side.

[43:58.680 --> 44:00.960]  Mike in California, thanks for calling.
[44:00.960 --> 44:05.640]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research, now if you
[44:05.640 --> 44:12.240]  read the actual 2014 legislation, the US government gain of function deliberative process and research
[44:12.240 --> 44:17.440]  funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza, MERS and ZARS
[44:17.440 --> 44:22.160]  viruses, there's nothing about ZARS like viruses and it's a research funding pause,
[44:22.160 --> 44:26.400]  it's not a stop, it's not a prohibition, it's when you come to a four-way intersection
[44:26.400 --> 44:30.280]  there's the stops sign, you stop, you look both ways and then you proceed and so it's
[44:30.280 --> 44:34.720]  also it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected gain of function but they'll
[44:34.720 --> 44:39.960]  argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research so you know Rand
[44:39.960 --> 44:43.120]  and others you know maybe Fauci was right, they don't quite know what they're talking
[44:43.120 --> 44:46.520]  about calling it gain of function you know that's why he didn't perjure himself, that's
[44:46.520 --> 44:50.480]  why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms
[44:50.480 --> 44:55.200]  that mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition still a gain of function, you're
[44:55.200 --> 45:12.000]  making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people, thank you Mike we love you.
[45:12.000 --> 45:34.840]  Thank you so much for watching this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in
[45:34.840 --> 45:58.760]  the next one.

[47:10.960 --> 47:26.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here and this tragic situation in Uvalde, Texas is a window
[47:26.400 --> 47:30.120]  into all the problems not just facing America but the world on so many fronts.
[47:30.120 --> 47:35.160]  Thank you for joining us on this Thursday May 26, 2022 broadcast my four year old daughter
[47:35.160 --> 47:39.840]  that just turned five just graduated from her little Christian preschool in the kindergarten
[47:39.840 --> 47:44.840]  and so I went to that and got over here as quickly as I could today but obviously family
[47:44.840 --> 47:51.680]  is so paramount sitting there watching those little two, three, four year olds graduating
[47:51.680 --> 47:57.720]  and up singing pretty little songs, Christian songs was tearing my guts out to think about
[47:57.720 --> 48:02.920]  how innocent and good they are and the children not much older were executed by this psychotic.
[48:02.920 --> 48:08.000]  Now we have a correction to make and when we get things wrong we want to make corrections
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.240]  because we don't get things wrong on purpose and I want to be very, very clear that we're
[48:12.240 --> 48:14.000]  not also blaming the police.
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.400]  We have a lot of inside information that's also been confirmed and we have Tim Inlow
[48:18.400 --> 48:23.600]  who is a police trainer all over central Texas and who actually is the main trainer for some
[48:23.600 --> 48:27.920]  of the larger cities and their schools and police departments and courthouses.
[48:27.920 --> 48:31.640]  He's also the head of our security but he works almost every weekend and takes off many
[48:31.640 --> 48:36.840]  times during the week as part of his contract with us to continue on with his other separate
[48:36.840 --> 48:42.400]  work so he specifically has a lot of sources, a lot of intel and what I was already hearing
[48:42.400 --> 48:49.960]  this morning was that the police thought it was a hostage situation because he wasn't
[48:49.960 --> 48:55.760]  shooting people, he went and held a class hostage and then when they started trying
[48:55.760 --> 49:00.800]  to bust in to stop it, he killed the kids and so everybody's saying oh the police are
[49:00.800 --> 49:05.440]  out there tackling people, they're tasering people, it's a horrible image and you're
[49:05.440 --> 49:08.400]  a parent, you want to get in to save your children and it probably would have been better
[49:08.400 --> 49:11.920]  just to rush in but then you could have got a bunch of kids shot in that process, it's
[49:11.920 --> 49:17.360]  a hostage situation and it's the killer's fault that this happened.
[49:17.360 --> 49:24.880]  Now certainly we saw stand downs in Columbine, we saw stand downs in places like Parkland
[49:24.880 --> 49:28.200]  a few years ago, those were confirmed where they just sat there, they knew the guy was
[49:28.200 --> 49:33.640]  already shooting, they knew it was one person, they sat there in the case of Columbine for
[49:33.640 --> 49:40.560]  almost an hour, like 56 minutes since the number that came out in court in Parkland
[49:40.560 --> 49:45.480]  in Florida with David Hogg and all the rest of it and Cruz the crazed shooter, they had
[49:45.480 --> 49:48.760]  all the prior knowledge, he was known as school shooter as his nickname, he was always threatening
[49:48.760 --> 49:53.600]  it, he was kicked out of school at the time and the police stood there for at least 14
[49:53.600 --> 49:58.160]  minutes and the first student said this, then we got the video so we broke that, the media
[49:58.160 --> 50:05.000]  spun it to say that I said nobody died, which is totally made up, we didn't say that, so
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.800]  the correction is we went with the mainstream news that as soon as this guy ran out of his
[50:08.800 --> 50:14.440]  vehicle, crashed it, ran into the school, first he shot at people at a funeral home
[50:14.440 --> 50:18.640]  across the street then he ran to the school and that within minutes this board patrol
[50:18.640 --> 50:23.440]  agent went in and killed him and got wounded, that's not what happened, it is the board
[50:23.440 --> 50:27.640]  patrol agent that was going to the school first and was outside the door and made the
[50:27.640 --> 50:32.040]  decision when he heard the shooting start to get through but the doors designed to not
[50:32.040 --> 50:38.040]  let shooters get in, so it was a big steel barricaded door, so he had to then find a
[50:38.040 --> 50:41.480]  panic teacher while the shooting is going on and while bullets are coming to the door
[50:41.480 --> 50:46.440]  at him, this is coming out to get the damn door open, so very easy to blame the police
[50:46.440 --> 50:50.640]  and when the police are bad we'll tell you about it obviously, you can call in if you
[50:50.640 --> 50:56.160]  want, we'll hear your views on this, but the left is using this for more defund the police,
[50:56.160 --> 51:00.760]  more federalize the police and when you talk about the feds, I mean for the shortcomings
[51:00.760 --> 51:04.920]  of local police, my god the feds are ten times worse, I'm not saying all feds are bad, you
[51:04.920 --> 51:11.640]  know the track record, Fast and Furious, Waco, Ruby Ridge, so much corruption, so many lies,
[51:11.640 --> 51:15.000]  it's insane, so the media got it wrong and that's going to happen to the fog of these
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.920]  things breaking and said oh the police went in right away and you know he was shooting
[51:17.920 --> 51:23.360]  right away and so we followed what they said, that was wrong, we have corrected that but
[51:23.360 --> 51:28.080]  now everybody's going down the path with these dramatic videos we've been showing and
[51:28.080 --> 51:38.080]  let me tell you, if my five six year old son or daughter was in there, I mean the police
[51:38.080 --> 51:40.640]  wouldn't be stopping me going in there and I'm not trying to act like a tough guy, I
[51:40.640 --> 51:44.680]  understand why the parents are trying to go in and the police are in a terrible situation
[51:44.680 --> 51:48.600]  because they're following orders, they don't know what's going on exactly, there's police
[51:48.600 --> 51:52.920]  inside, I think it's a hostage situation, but this garbage went on, we're now learning
[51:52.920 --> 51:58.240]  for an hour and then he started executing the children and the two teachers that had
[51:58.240 --> 52:05.160]  been in the classroom, so that's what's going on and the details are coming out, the Democratic
[52:05.160 --> 52:10.080]  Party is seizing on this and not even getting into the real issues and so we're going to
[52:10.080 --> 52:13.440]  continue to try to give you the best, most accurate information we can, now again Tim
[52:13.440 --> 52:19.440]  Enlobe did not want to come on yesterday and he did not want to come on Monday night because
[52:19.440 --> 52:23.600]  he didn't have the information, he's ready to come on at 12.30, bottom of the hour in
[52:23.600 --> 52:28.560]  about 40 minutes from now to break it all down for you and he's on the phone right now
[52:28.560 --> 52:33.840]  calling his contacts, he's obviously got contacts everywhere to specifically vet the information
[52:33.840 --> 52:38.720]  but we know that's what happened, we just don't know the details, you'll have exclusive
[52:38.720 --> 52:46.000]  information in 40 minutes here on the M4Wars radio TV network, over 350 radio stations,
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.120]  over 100 TV and cable stations, we're free to air, nobody, no contracts, just pick the
[52:50.120 --> 52:56.320]  show up and we appreciate everybody that's picking up the transmission.
[52:56.320 --> 53:02.240]  Now a lot of other stuff's going on obviously with the new lockdowns they're pushing, the
[53:02.240 --> 53:06.480]  monkeypox fair mongering and finally a lot of leaders not just here but around the world
[53:06.480 --> 53:13.000]  are getting it, so going through my stack today, I ran across six or seven articles
[53:13.000 --> 53:16.440]  where people are saying you know if there's new lockdowns it's going to kill tens of millions
[53:16.440 --> 53:21.360]  more people, we can't allow this and cutting off the fossil fuels is going to kill hundreds
[53:21.360 --> 53:27.080]  of millions over the next decade if not billions, that society collapses but still even the
[53:27.080 --> 53:30.880]  news gets it wrong like oh the left just has bad policies, they don't know what they're
[53:30.880 --> 53:34.600]  doing or Mao Zedong had bad policies that killed 80 million Chinese, he didn't know
[53:34.600 --> 53:37.680]  what he was doing or Stalin and Lenin had bad policies, they didn't know what they were
[53:37.680 --> 53:41.520]  doing that killed 20 million plus people, no, they're doing it on purpose to take over
[53:41.520 --> 53:45.400]  society and their own admissions, here's one of the headlines, leftists are about to kill
[53:45.400 --> 53:50.280]  millions of people right before our eyes, that is a very important stack, we need to
[53:50.280 --> 53:56.840]  remember all the murder and death and war and open borders and human smuggling and everything
[53:56.840 --> 54:02.160]  that's going on while the media takes a horrible tragedy like this and blows it up to make
[54:02.160 --> 54:07.080]  the biggest thing in the world and this guy executed one six year old, it'd be the worst
[54:07.080 --> 54:12.040]  thing in the world because whether it's one person or a million, the problem isn't guns
[54:12.040 --> 54:16.640]  and we all know that if you're being logical, it's spiritual, it is that we have evil, it
[54:16.640 --> 54:25.600]  is that someone would go hold a classroom full of elementary students hostage and shoot
[54:25.600 --> 54:29.240]  them in the head, shoot them in the chest, shoot them up, kill them, but you could do
[54:29.240 --> 54:33.880]  that up close because it's hard statistically to kill your enemy that's trying to kill you
[54:33.880 --> 54:39.080]  up close, even hardened troops have trouble doing that sometimes, but imagine the type
[54:39.080 --> 54:46.920]  of demonic energy that it takes to execute 19 little children and two teachers, that's
[54:46.920 --> 54:52.440]  why we have guns, ladies and gentlemen, so we're going to go over to the next tower,
[54:52.440 --> 54:56.680]  we're going to play the different clips and we're going to get to the bottom of what happened,
[54:56.680 --> 55:01.600]  we know he now barricaded in, we now know it was a hostage situation and if a hostage
[55:01.600 --> 55:08.520]  taker starts killing hostages and they're behind a barricaded door, then you really
[55:08.520 --> 55:14.120]  can't second guess the police, all you can do is study what happened and then understand
[55:14.120 --> 55:18.720]  well how do you deal with it if someone gets in and then uses the hardened doors to keep
[55:18.720 --> 55:26.160]  the police out, you see, everything's a double edged sword and so that's why this really
[55:26.160 --> 55:31.560]  has to be looked at from every angle and that's why I've said the answer is arming the teachers
[55:31.560 --> 55:36.320]  doing a psychological profile, seeing who wants to be part of the program and arming
[55:36.320 --> 55:40.840]  the teachers, but at the end of the day there was a security person in the building, these
[55:40.840 --> 55:44.800]  demons are targeting schools, it's still extremely rare but it doesn't matter, it's a horrible
[55:44.800 --> 55:48.680]  thing and we shouldn't be sending 40 billion dollars, that's just the latest one, they
[55:48.680 --> 55:56.240]  want 5 billion a month now, it's already over 55 billion in the last just five, six months
[55:56.240 --> 56:02.480]  they've given, tens of billions before that to overthrow the government eight years ago
[56:02.480 --> 56:08.040]  and now 5 billion a month is what Zelensky is arrogantly demanding while we don't have
[56:08.040 --> 56:12.440]  baby formula on the shelves and while gas prices and other commodities are exploding
[56:12.440 --> 56:18.000]  it's all coming up today, separately, got some big announcements we're going to be making
[56:18.000 --> 56:21.960]  today, some exciting announcements but I'm going to get to it at the start like six after

[59:58.840 --> 1:00:05.920]  All right, here's the deal, I'm going to air some clips of Beto O'Rourke crashing
[1:00:05.920 --> 1:00:10.000]  the press conference, the mayor of Ivaldi responding, Ted Cruz knocking out of the park,
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:14.520]  that's what we need to see more of in the face of some leftist guy from the UK demonizing
[1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:19.720]  America and more and then when we start the next segment, six after, we go into overdrive
[1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:25.280]  intel with our inside sources at the bottom of the hour, what really happened and the
[1:00:25.280 --> 1:00:31.120]  latest information on the tragedy in Ivaldi, we have a major school safety training officer
[1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:35.640]  that runs training programs, the court has a school, you name it, major cities, who's
[1:00:35.640 --> 1:00:39.360]  going to be joining us in studio at the bottom of the 30 minutes, we'll have open phones
[1:00:39.360 --> 1:00:43.920]  after that and a lot of news today, but here's a few of the clips I just met.
[1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:58.480]  Two nine, one six and at this time I will pass the mic to Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick.
[1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:07.280]  Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, sit down, you're out of line and an embarrassment.
[1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:31.480]  I can't believe you're a six son of a bitch that would come to a deal like this to make
[1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:39.400]  a political issue.
[1:01:39.400 --> 1:02:09.240]  This is my stand on that, they want to have that discussion, that's what I'm going to
[1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:10.240]  do.
[1:02:10.240 --> 1:02:11.240]  That's fine.
[1:02:11.240 --> 1:02:16.240]  But that event today was not the place for the time to come in here and attack the governor
[1:02:16.240 --> 1:02:22.000]  or anybody that said he wants to have that discussion, have it outside somewhere or something,
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.800]  but not in that building, we're trying to get the people there.
[1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:26.800]  This community is broken right now.
[1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:30.800]  No community should have to go through what we've done in this community.
[1:02:30.800 --> 1:02:35.600]  And for a person to come in there and start that crap, I have no respect for better.
[1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:48.320]  I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican or independent, we're American people, we're
[1:02:48.320 --> 1:02:52.320]  trying to come together as a community and to do what you did today that press conference
[1:02:52.320 --> 1:02:53.320]  was wrong.
[1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:56.680]  I'm sorry, but it was wrong.
[1:02:56.680 --> 1:02:59.360]  Is this the moment to reform gun laws?
[1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:03.400]  You know, it's easy to go to politics, but it's important, it's at the heart of the
[1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:04.400]  issue.
[1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:06.320]  We get that that's where the media likes to go.
[1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:07.320]  It's not.
[1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:09.240]  It's where many of the people we've talked to here like to go.
[1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:16.880]  The proposals from Democrats and the media, inevitably, when some violent psychopath murders
[1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:17.880]  people.
[1:03:17.880 --> 1:03:24.400]  A violent psychopath who's able to get a weapon so easily, 18-year-old with two AR-15s.
[1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:28.000]  If you want to stop, just a violent cry.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:31.360]  The proposals the Democrats have, none of them would have stopped this.
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:33.320]  But why does this only happen in your country?
[1:03:33.320 --> 1:03:37.600]  I really think that's what many people around the world just, they cannot fathom.
[1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:38.800]  Why only in America?
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:43.200]  Why is this American exceptionalism so awful?
[1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:45.880]  You know, I'm sorry you think American exceptionalism is awful.
[1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:49.200]  I think this aspect of it.
[1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:51.240]  You get your political agenda.
[1:03:51.240 --> 1:03:52.240]  God love you.
[1:03:52.240 --> 1:03:53.240]  Senator, it's not.
[1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:56.240]  I just want to understand why you do not think that guns are the problem.
[1:03:56.240 --> 1:03:58.840]  Why is this just an American problem?
[1:03:58.840 --> 1:04:00.920]  It is just an American problem, sir.
[1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:05.280]  Mr. Cruz, why is America the only country that faces this kind of, you know what, mass
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:06.280]  shooting?
[1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:07.280]  But you can't answer that.
[1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:08.280]  You can't answer that.
[1:04:08.280 --> 1:04:09.280]  Can you say?
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:10.280]  You can't answer that.
[1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:11.280]  Why is this country?
[1:04:11.280 --> 1:04:12.280]  Why is it that people come from all over the world to America?
[1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:15.280]  Because it's the freest, most prosperous, safest country on Earth.
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:16.280]  The line is dying and stopping.
[1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:18.280]  It may be the freest and maybe the most popular.
[1:04:18.280 --> 1:04:26.280]  Why are our kids dying and stopping?
[1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:36.280]  Why are our kids dying and stopping?
[1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:46.280]  Why are our kids dying and stopping?
[1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:55.280]  Why are our kids dying and stopping?
[1:04:55.280 --> 1:05:05.280]  Why are our kids dying and stopping?

[1:06:05.240 --> 1:06:12.240]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:42.240]  Well, the Puppet in Chief, Joe Biden, Barack Obama's third
[1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:47.840]  administration placeholder has come on and said the second
[1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:52.000]  amendment is not absolute and they tell us free speech
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:53.560]  isn't absolute and now they're trying to get rid of all
[1:06:53.560 --> 1:06:55.520]  free speech and they've admitted, Beto or Rourke,
[1:06:55.520 --> 1:06:58.200]  all of them, that hell yes, we'll take your semi-automatic
[1:06:58.200 --> 1:07:01.400]  rivals, we'll take all your semi-autos including handguns
[1:07:01.400 --> 1:07:03.240]  so that we can't protect ourselves.
[1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:07.440]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, the big scandal right now
[1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:12.720]  isn't just the poor 19 children and two teachers that died.
[1:07:12.720 --> 1:07:17.160]  It's that the media first reported, wasn't even the
[1:07:17.160 --> 1:07:20.440]  state police or local police or war patrol saying this,
[1:07:20.440 --> 1:07:24.120]  but the media said, oh, you know, he ran off in the ditch,
[1:07:24.120 --> 1:07:26.680]  being chased, shot the police, ran into the school,
[1:07:26.680 --> 1:07:28.200]  started shooting people.
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:30.480]  No, he went to the school, barricaded himself behind an
[1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:33.720]  armored door that he was able to get them to open up and get
[1:07:33.720 --> 1:07:37.480]  into or wasn't locked to then lock that so that the police
[1:07:37.480 --> 1:07:41.240]  didn't know what was going on inside and so it went on for
[1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:45.400]  almost an hour of him barricaded inside, then it's just
[1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:48.200]  coming out now, he started executing the people inside.
[1:07:48.200 --> 1:07:50.880]  Now, here and there in the news, they're admitting that's
[1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:53.720]  the case, but the big push is, see, we gotta federalize the
[1:07:53.720 --> 1:07:57.000]  police or the police are bad and they stood down.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:00.960]  This was not like Parkland, this was not like Columbine,
[1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:02.720]  where they did stand down on record.
[1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:04.600]  When they knew it was a shooter actively going,
[1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:06.680]  but none of them wanted to be shot, none of them wanted to
[1:08:06.680 --> 1:08:09.320]  accidentally shoot a child and have liability in this
[1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:10.160]  nanny state.
[1:08:12.440 --> 1:08:15.880]  That's terrible and now we've had decades of this happening
[1:08:15.880 --> 1:08:19.600]  several times a year and it's emblematic of how the system
[1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:23.400]  says the citizen shouldn't be able to be armed and then the
[1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:25.240]  police don't have a responsibility to protect you,
[1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:28.360]  they're gonna enforce the law, but they should try and then
[1:08:28.360 --> 1:08:32.360]  they get the blame when it's an evil person out of control
[1:08:32.360 --> 1:08:34.520]  and we have an evil problem.
[1:08:34.520 --> 1:08:39.520]  I have a stack of news of mass shootings in Latin America
[1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:42.000]  where they've taken the guns from the people,
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.520]  in most cases, 50, 60, 70, 80 years ago.
[1:08:45.560 --> 1:08:50.560]  There was another big massacre in Mexico just yesterday
[1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:55.560]  where they just lined up 17 people and executed them,
[1:08:57.800 --> 1:09:01.000]  the drug cartels, that's happening every day or so
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.880]  and it hardly ever even makes the back of the paper
[1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:06.520]  and it certainly doesn't make the US news.
[1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:09.600]  Just like thousands of shootings a year in Chicago,
[1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:11.960]  over a thousand deaths a year in Chicago,
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.640]  hundreds of deaths in places like Dallas,
[1:09:15.640 --> 1:09:18.240]  black on black crime, it's terrible,
[1:09:18.240 --> 1:09:21.840]  95% of it black on black gang related
[1:09:21.840 --> 1:09:25.720]  and zero national coverage of it
[1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:29.560]  or how the police and citizens are battling it.
[1:09:31.080 --> 1:09:32.600]  And then the cops make a mistake,
[1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:35.000]  somebody's out of their mind on multiple drugs,
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.800]  they die of a heart attack, comes out in the corner report
[1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:40.520]  but we don't care, $3 billion of property
[1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:44.560]  and dozens are killed and then candidate Biden
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:48.240]  and then candidate Harris said it's a good thing.
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:49.920]  While they try to defund the police,
[1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:54.920]  so we've got Tim Enlobe who is a safety school head trainer
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:10:00.920]  and he trains big schools right here in Central Texas
[1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:05.480]  and courthouses, police departments, churches, you name it.
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:10.480]  He's very respected and he trains people almost every week.
[1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:13.120]  He's also our security head here.
[1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:14.960]  He is gonna be in studio with us
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:16.800]  and he has contacts and law enforcement
[1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:18.920]  is getting more details right now
[1:10:18.920 --> 1:10:21.520]  of exactly what went on inside of that building.
[1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:23.560]  When the police do bad things, we're all over them.
[1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:25.520]  When Soros gets district attorneys appointed
[1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:28.480]  and police chiefs that are globalists, we expose them.
[1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:31.040]  I mean, I see cases where they won't prosecute
[1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:33.440]  armed robbers and killers, you see that all the time.
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:36.800]  There was a school shooting last year up in Fort Worth.
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:40.560]  Guy shot three people, black guy.
[1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:43.440]  He was out the next morning from jail.
[1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:45.320]  They've had cases in downtown Austin
[1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:47.440]  where they spray crowds with bullets
[1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:50.320]  and they let him out of jail the next day.
[1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:52.840]  The anti-foot shooter that shot two people
[1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:55.240]  and tried to shoot a guy in a car and drive down the street,
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:10:57.840]  they let him out of jail, no prison time.
[1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:02.400]  I mean, think about the crime exploding
[1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:05.280]  because of the direct policies these people have engaged in
[1:11:05.280 --> 1:11:07.240]  or the thousands killed on the border
[1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:11.680]  and the severed heads and the hearts cut out
[1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:14.400]  and all of it and these people shake their fingers at us
[1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:16.800]  while they have all these secret service and bodyguards
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:18.840]  in places like Minneapolis, St. Paul,
[1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:20.320]  where they disband half the police
[1:11:20.320 --> 1:11:22.120]  and then do multi-million dollar contracts
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:25.000]  for the city council to have 24 hour private guards
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.240]  at the city council and their homes.
[1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:31.200]  It's like the globalists flying into Davos
[1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:33.640]  and flying into this world government summit in Geneva
[1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:36.520]  on hundreds of jet airplanes and getting $60 million,
[1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:38.920]  mainly US taxpayer money to pay for it
[1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:41.160]  and then telling you you shouldn't have a car
[1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:44.520]  or air conditioner and that you shouldn't have children.
[1:11:44.520 --> 1:11:46.000]  It's unbelievable.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:50.160]  They have armed bodyguards, they have security,
[1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:52.840]  they have intelligence, they have surveillance,
[1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:55.240]  they have our taxpayer dollars paying for it
[1:11:55.240 --> 1:11:56.080]  and it's out of control.
[1:11:56.080 --> 1:11:59.640]  So that's bottom of the hour and about 20 minutes.
[1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:03.520]  Tim is gonna be in studio with us to lay out what we know
[1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:05.680]  and the best facts we've got.
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:07.120]  This will be exclusive information,
[1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:09.520]  just like the special ed teacher
[1:12:09.520 --> 1:12:12.200]  for the reported shooter on with us yesterday.
[1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:14.680]  This is gonna be extremely informative
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:17.160]  and we'll cut through what's really going on.
[1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:18.160]  Could the police on a better job?
[1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:19.360]  Absolutely.
[1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:20.520]  Should we learn from this?
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:21.960]  Absolutely.
[1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:25.600]  But just to say that, oh, they kept people
[1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:26.920]  from going to save their kids,
[1:12:26.920 --> 1:12:29.600]  now we know it was a hostage situation
[1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:31.480]  and that was what was going on.
[1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:34.120]  But if more comes out and information changes,
[1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:37.080]  we will definitely let you know.
[1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:40.080]  All right, we have a lot of other news on the economy,
[1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:41.640]  a lot of other news on global starvation,
[1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:45.280]  the latest on monkeypox, baby formula running out,
[1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:48.000]  not just here, but all over the Western world
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:50.960]  and more shortages coming as the supply chain breaks down.
[1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:53.480]  That's why it's more important than ever
[1:12:53.480 --> 1:12:55.240]  now to keep info wars on the air
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:56.800]  because our supply chain's broken down,
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:12:58.360]  our cost have all gone up.
[1:12:58.360 --> 1:12:59.840]  I know the listeners of viewers all understand
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:01.440]  that we've tried not to go up on the prices,
[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:03.320]  we try to have big sales,
[1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:06.520]  but we're not gonna be able to stay on air
[1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:08.720]  unless we get funded by the listeners
[1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:10.480]  and I wanna thank you all for your commitment
[1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:11.800]  and those of you that have stepped up
[1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:15.000]  and that's why we're making a big announcement.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:16.880]  And just like the last two times,
[1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:19.760]  they sell out within eight, nine days.
[1:13:19.760 --> 1:13:21.640]  And it's the third and final coin
[1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:25.880]  in the founders coin system
[1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:28.800]  with a whole new system and a lot of exclusive stuff
[1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:31.280]  and exclusive broadcast films, you name it,
[1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:35.160]  for everybody that gets the coin, signs up with their email,
[1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:38.280]  then as all these special benefits and things move forward,
[1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:40.640]  you will be getting them unless we get shut down,
[1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:42.320]  which probably isn't gonna happen for a long time,
[1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:45.640]  it was ever, and we're on track to the things we wanna do,
[1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:46.840]  we haven't got it all done yet,
[1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:48.800]  but it's very exciting, I wanna thank those of you
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:50.000]  that are founding member coins,
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:51.440]  plus it's a piece of history
[1:13:51.440 --> 1:13:52.880]  and so the markup in the coin,
[1:13:52.880 --> 1:13:54.080]  again, this is not as an investment,
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:55.680]  it's an investment in your freedom in the future,
[1:13:55.680 --> 1:13:56.960]  it's not an investment in the silver,
[1:13:56.960 --> 1:13:59.360]  it's an investment in a collectible artifact
[1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:01.080]  of the Second American Revolution
[1:14:01.080 --> 1:14:02.720]  during this historical struggle.
[1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:04.080]  We'll put more coins out in the future,
[1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:06.080]  but they're not gonna be founder coins
[1:14:06.080 --> 1:14:08.480]  and there'll be a lesser price because these are higher
[1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:10.520]  because they're exclusive and are gonna fund us
[1:14:10.520 --> 1:14:13.720]  staying on the air and doing so much more
[1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:16.600]  and this coin was designed six months ago,
[1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:19.320]  it was finished minting a week ago,
[1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:24.320]  it got delivered yesterday to a vault we have offsite
[1:14:24.320 --> 1:14:26.480]  and they'll be gone in 10 days
[1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:28.400]  and so it has nothing to do with the terrible event
[1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:30.600]  that just happened, but it is extremely apropos,
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:32.080]  it is the come and take it,
[1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:34.320]  from Gonzales, Texas, very close to where this happened,
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:35.720]  when the Mexican army came and said,
[1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:37.240]  turn in your guns and your cannon,
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:38.480]  they said come and take it,
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:40.080]  quoting what happened with the Greeks
[1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:43.440]  at the Battle of Thermopylae, as you know, 300.
[1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:45.440]  So, come and take it,
[1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:48.440]  ladies and gentlemen, only 10,000 of this coin,
[1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:50.480]  it has a cannon with the Gadgeton snake
[1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:52.280]  coiled around it on one side,
[1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:57.280]  it has the Greek Spartan fighter helmet on the other,
[1:14:57.280 --> 1:15:01.160]  it says come and take it, founding member coin,
[1:15:01.160 --> 1:15:06.160]  1776 to 2020, three men bare arms.
[1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:09.360]  On one side it says three men bare arms,
[1:15:09.360 --> 1:15:11.080]  on the tail side, on the head side,
[1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:13.520]  it says come and take it, founding member,
[1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:15.080]  this is such a special coin,
[1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:17.680]  the third in the series and I can tell you,
[1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:20.120]  these coins are selling for three, four, five times
[1:15:20.120 --> 1:15:23.440]  what people got them for all over eBay, everywhere.
[1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:25.680]  If that's folks to make more of the originals, no,
[1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:27.880]  these are 10,000 each and that's it,
[1:15:27.880 --> 1:15:29.800]  this is the last in the set.

[1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:29.640]  you're gonna find.

[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:37.360]  and compounds so you don't absorb it at all or fully.
[1:16:37.360 --> 1:16:39.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a limited supply

[1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:42.240]  because the supply chain right now is,
[1:16:42.240 --> 1:16:45.600]  but despite that, we're selling it at 25% off

[1:18:03.160 --> 1:18:04.960]  All the success that we've had together
[1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:06.720]  against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[1:18:06.720 --> 1:18:09.560]  caught flat-footed during their major takeover
[1:18:09.560 --> 1:18:10.760]  is because of you.

[1:19:09.320 --> 1:19:12.280]  There are only 25,000 of these in existence
[1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:14.160]  and they'll never be made again.
[1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:16.320]  The bank that owns the mint that has started
[1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:17.800]  putting these out the last few years
[1:19:17.800 --> 1:19:21.760]  just sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering
[1:19:21.760 --> 1:19:24.440]  that was 40% more than what we're selling these for.

[1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:54.120]  and I salute you and thank you.

[1:19:58.440 --> 1:20:01.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:20:01.240 --> 1:20:13.240]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:32.160 --> 1:20:35.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back on this Thursday,
[1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:40.360]  May 26, 2022, transmission of the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:42.400]  It is so important to realize
[1:20:42.400 --> 1:20:45.080]  that they have announced their world government treaty.
[1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:48.160]  They've now released some segments of the draft.
[1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:53.160]  It does give veto power of the UN over national sovereignty.
[1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:56.640]  Biden publicly wanted that or his controllers did.
[1:20:56.640 --> 1:21:01.640]  And they have announced that they are in a transition
[1:21:01.680 --> 1:21:04.480]  of taking us off fossil fuels that experts estimate
[1:21:04.480 --> 1:21:06.640]  will kill over a billion people in the next decade.
[1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:08.400]  There's news articles about the hundreds of millions
[1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:10.360]  that will die very quickly over that.
[1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:12.040]  You don't just have baby formula shortages
[1:21:12.040 --> 1:21:13.400]  in the third world when they do stuff like this,
[1:21:13.400 --> 1:21:15.720]  you have mass death and then you have collapse
[1:21:15.720 --> 1:21:17.000]  and huge amounts of refugees.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:21.400]  So we're talking about 21 people dead and it's horrible
[1:21:21.400 --> 1:21:22.680]  and we wish we could stop evil,
[1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:25.360]  but that's the conundrum of life on earth
[1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:27.160]  because there's free will, there's good people
[1:21:27.160 --> 1:21:28.880]  and there's bad people.
[1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:30.160]  And most good people are asleep,
[1:21:30.160 --> 1:21:32.320]  so they let the bad people run rampant.
[1:21:32.320 --> 1:21:34.240]  And that's what history shows.
[1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:37.040]  We've had one of the secure safest nations ever.
[1:21:37.040 --> 1:21:39.640]  People wanna come here because of the opportunity.
[1:21:39.640 --> 1:21:42.360]  And compared to many other nations, we have a low crime rate.
[1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:44.680]  Some of our cities have some of the worst crime in the world
[1:21:44.680 --> 1:21:46.560]  and that's where the people are disarmed.
[1:21:46.560 --> 1:21:49.520]  And I know the listeners all understand this.
[1:21:49.520 --> 1:21:52.400]  But you've gotta be vocal and you've gotta be active right now
[1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:54.120]  because they're coming after your First Amendment saying
[1:21:54.120 --> 1:21:55.720]  you got radicalized online,
[1:21:55.720 --> 1:21:57.160]  just like the white supremacist
[1:21:57.160 --> 1:21:59.040]  a couple of weeks ago in Buffalo.
[1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:02.320]  And so they're blaming all of our speech for this
[1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:04.360]  and they're blaming our right to self-defense
[1:22:04.360 --> 1:22:05.640]  and they're coming for our freedom.
[1:22:05.640 --> 1:22:08.800]  So we have a school safety trainer
[1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:11.200]  who does the law enforcement active shooter training,
[1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:15.640]  Tim Inlow, who does it for major cities here in Texas.
[1:22:15.640 --> 1:22:17.760]  He trains police departments on it
[1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:20.920]  and also courthouse security, all of that.
[1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:23.280]  He's got the sources, he's got the intel
[1:22:23.280 --> 1:22:26.000]  and he's gonna be in studio with us coming up.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:27.400]  Next segment we'll play some clips
[1:22:27.400 --> 1:22:29.200]  coming into that segment of Biden,
[1:22:29.200 --> 1:22:30.320]  coming after the Second Amendment,
[1:22:30.320 --> 1:22:31.880]  back to O'Rourke and others,
[1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:33.360]  the announcements that have been made.
[1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:36.160]  They're also merging this new anti-terrorism bill,
[1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:39.120]  saying white people are the main terror threat,
[1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:41.240]  all over the news, members of Congress are,
[1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:44.200]  and trying to tie what happened at these different shootings
[1:22:44.200 --> 1:22:45.800]  to just being white in general.
[1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:49.800]  And it's just absolutely preposterous.
[1:22:49.800 --> 1:22:52.840]  It's amazing and people should be upset
[1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:55.080]  that you're being blamed for what somebody does
[1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:56.560]  that's the same color as you.
[1:22:56.560 --> 1:22:58.200]  You know, this guy wasn't quote white,
[1:22:58.200 --> 1:23:00.600]  was Hispanic, but it was like a white guy to me.
[1:23:00.600 --> 1:23:02.360]  And the point is, is that
[1:23:05.120 --> 1:23:07.200]  this guilt by association situation
[1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:10.680]  is just unbelievable when it's Democrat policies
[1:23:10.680 --> 1:23:13.960]  that we know on record
[1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:18.000]  that cause the mass of crime and death
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:21.560]  and shootings in the streets and they know it.
[1:23:21.560 --> 1:23:26.560]  They're in a process of dismantling the once free world
[1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:29.320]  because they don't want an example of freedom
[1:23:29.320 --> 1:23:31.240]  anywhere in the world, anybody else.
[1:23:31.240 --> 1:23:32.880]  They don't want that American benchmark.
[1:23:32.880 --> 1:23:33.800]  Are we perfect?
[1:23:33.800 --> 1:23:34.920]  Absolutely not.
[1:23:34.920 --> 1:23:36.400]  Are we heads above other countries?
[1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:38.520]  On average, absolutely.
[1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:41.320]  Unless you live in Luxembourg or Switzerland.
[1:23:41.320 --> 1:23:43.480]  And I couldn't afford to live in Switzerland.
[1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:47.640]  I couldn't afford to live in Luxembourg.
[1:23:47.640 --> 1:23:50.160]  I'm not a rich man, but I'm upper middle class.
[1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:53.280]  The average person could not live in a place like that.
[1:23:53.280 --> 1:23:54.400]  And of course, Switzerland,
[1:23:54.400 --> 1:23:56.640]  the citizens have to be armed by law
[1:23:56.640 --> 1:23:59.600]  and they have the lowest crime rate in the world.
[1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:03.240]  So where the elites live, the public is armed.
[1:24:04.640 --> 1:24:06.960]  In fact, every mile or so,
[1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:08.520]  they have armored fortresses
[1:24:08.520 --> 1:24:10.320]  in the sides of hills and mountains.
[1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:13.520]  And the citizens have keys to it
[1:24:13.520 --> 1:24:16.800]  and it's full of rocket launchers and machine guns
[1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:19.680]  that they have to check out on each year
[1:24:19.680 --> 1:24:21.000]  and prove they know how to use.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  How do they trust the Swiss
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:24.800]  to have rocket launchers and machine guns
[1:24:24.800 --> 1:24:26.320]  and small artillery?
[1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:29.520]  Well, Switzerland's been neutral for 400 years
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:30.760]  and never gets invaded.
[1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:32.320]  It has the richest country in the world per capita
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:33.760]  because of that.
[1:24:33.760 --> 1:24:36.760]  So really the American example of 1776,
[1:24:36.760 --> 1:24:41.400]  they quoted the Swiss cantons,
[1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:43.280]  their states and their rules.
[1:24:43.280 --> 1:24:45.640]  And they also quoted some of the Dutch laws,
[1:24:45.640 --> 1:24:47.960]  the Dutch going back over 500 years ago
[1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:51.440]  because of pirate raids on their incredible shipping
[1:24:51.440 --> 1:24:54.120]  facilities, the second largest in the world at the time,
[1:24:54.120 --> 1:24:57.640]  they began to arm what they called the night watch
[1:24:57.640 --> 1:25:01.400]  and they would get the local men as a militia to be armed.
[1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:02.240]  And up to that point,
[1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:04.000]  the general public could not be armed anyway.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:05.400]  Only the nobles and the knights
[1:25:05.400 --> 1:25:08.680]  and to control the service.
[1:25:08.680 --> 1:25:10.800]  But if you go to Switzerland
[1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:15.480]  and if you go to the Netherlands, the Dutch,
[1:25:15.480 --> 1:25:18.560]  that's where our second amendment comes from.
[1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:20.640]  Also some of that is in the Magna Carta
[1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:22.600]  and British common law,
[1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:25.640]  but the examples of it come from the Dutch
[1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:29.120]  and come from the Swiss and we owe them for that.
[1:25:29.120 --> 1:25:31.240]  And it goes back to when the Swiss took over
[1:25:31.240 --> 1:25:33.720]  and overthrew a foreign king
[1:25:33.720 --> 1:25:34.640]  that was in control of their country
[1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:36.320]  that was torturing and killing people.
[1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:38.600]  And it's the famous story of William Tell
[1:25:38.600 --> 1:25:40.960]  that's part true, part legend,
[1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:43.560]  shooting the apple off of the crossbow
[1:25:43.560 --> 1:25:44.880]  and the rest of it.
[1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:49.720]  So William Tell, like Conan the barbarian or something,
[1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:52.080]  like killed a whole bunch of the king's troops
[1:25:52.080 --> 1:25:53.640]  and then caused an uprising.
[1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:57.240]  And that's where the public being armed comes from.
[1:25:57.240 --> 1:26:00.680]  They had their own 1776 long before us
[1:26:00.680 --> 1:26:05.320]  and it's fascinating, fascinating information.
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:09.800]  All right, there's a legislator in Florida.
[1:26:09.800 --> 1:26:11.440]  We got the clip coming up as well
[1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:13.520]  who said, let Biden ban our guns
[1:26:13.520 --> 1:26:15.320]  and you'll see what the second amendment's for.
[1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:17.000]  That is how the war started.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:20.880]  Taxational representation and then people being put
[1:26:20.880 --> 1:26:23.680]  in puppet courts and then they tried to take the guns.
[1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:26.360]  And I understand everybody's really angry right now.
[1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:28.200]  We have a right to revolution
[1:26:28.200 --> 1:26:30.120]  under the Declaration of Independence
[1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:32.040]  that just points out our rights that God gave us.
[1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:34.200]  But we really, I'm not putting this rep down,
[1:26:34.200 --> 1:26:36.200]  understand what he's saying, but I really think
[1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:39.880]  at this point we need to really cool our rhetoric.
[1:26:39.880 --> 1:26:42.120]  And I'm somebody that's had very strong rhetoric as well.
[1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:44.840]  We try to take our guns, 1776 will commence again
[1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:47.200]  and it will if they do this.
[1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:50.080]  But we need to be working politically
[1:26:50.080 --> 1:26:52.760]  and culturally to stop this because the globalists,
[1:26:52.760 --> 1:26:54.440]  if we have that type of rhetoric right now,
[1:26:54.440 --> 1:26:57.360]  will stage an event or provocateur an event
[1:26:57.360 --> 1:26:59.600]  and blame it on patriots.
[1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:02.080]  And then try to make the whole revolution
[1:27:02.080 --> 1:27:03.120]  about going after gun owners.
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:04.880]  And if the globalists are coming up to do that,
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:06.080]  then it's gonna happen.
[1:27:06.080 --> 1:27:08.120]  It's like at Bunker Hill, Lexington Concorde
[1:27:08.120 --> 1:27:09.800]  when 1776 started.
[1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:11.160]  You had the captain of the militia.
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:12.520]  He said, we don't want a war here.
[1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:13.720]  We don't want it to start.
[1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:15.000]  Don't fire first.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:16.280]  Let's try to fix this peacefully,
[1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:17.960]  but we're not turning our guns in.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:23.800]  And it's called the shot heard around the world.
[1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:27.200]  And most historians believe the British fired first.
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:31.440]  But this won't be good for the feds trying to enforce it.
[1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:33.600]  You'll be like the red goats.
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:34.920]  And it won't be good for the citizens.
[1:27:34.920 --> 1:27:36.920]  The globalists want to destabilize the world
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:39.640]  and they want to kick off a violent revolution.
[1:27:39.640 --> 1:27:43.000]  We do not want to have to go to that.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.360]  We need to work as hard as we can.
[1:27:45.360 --> 1:27:47.560]  We are politically winning to the point
[1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:52.040]  they have to steal elections with dead people
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:53.880]  and illegal alien names and out-of-staters
[1:27:53.880 --> 1:27:56.400]  on record 2,000 mules proves it.
[1:27:56.400 --> 1:27:59.360]  But the Democrats said there'll be a red mirage
[1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:00.720]  and then we'll win with mail-in ballots.
[1:28:00.720 --> 1:28:01.760]  They said what they would do.
[1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:03.400]  So they're discredited.
[1:28:03.400 --> 1:28:04.600]  They've already lost.
[1:28:04.600 --> 1:28:07.520]  All they can hope is to have a civil war in this country
[1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:09.600]  to cover up what they've done with the economy
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:10.240]  and the rest of it.
[1:28:10.240 --> 1:28:11.920]  And instead, we're going to expose the UN.
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:13.080]  We're going to expose the WF.
[1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:15.160]  We're going to expose Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab.
[1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:17.840]  We're going to expose the secret network set up
[1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:20.200]  by Obama and others to censor the American people
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:22.400]  through NATO funding that goes to Ukraine
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:24.200]  and comes back here and everything that's now
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:26.560]  hitting the news that we told you about five years ago,
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:28.840]  six years ago, 10 years ago.
[1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:30.240]  We're going to do this together.
[1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:32.240]  We're going to get an open debate about what's happening.
[1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:35.000]  And we're going to use the First Amendment to beat these people.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.440]  We're going to use the Second Amendment to defend ourselves
[1:28:37.440 --> 1:28:39.720]  from criminals, lawlessness, you name it.
[1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:41.640]  And if they try to take the guns in mass
[1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:46.240]  and take people to camps, then the civil war will begin.
[1:28:46.240 --> 1:28:47.920]  And that'll be off the races.
[1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:49.600]  But I am doing everything in my power
[1:28:49.600 --> 1:28:51.360]  to stop that and call for calm.

[1:31:57.880 --> 1:32:00.320]  So when I first started taking survival shield,
[1:32:00.320 --> 1:32:03.320]  basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[1:32:03.320 --> 1:32:05.760]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[1:32:05.760 --> 1:32:08.920]  I was barely holding onto a jaw and I heard Dr. Group
[1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:10.240]  on your show and I listened to it.
[1:32:10.240 --> 1:32:12.840]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield,
[1:32:12.840 --> 1:32:14.720]  the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[1:32:14.720 --> 1:32:17.040]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that too.
[1:32:17.040 --> 1:32:18.960]  You had, you know, with a deeper source, you know,
[1:32:18.960 --> 1:32:20.800]  and I got really excited about that so I took it.
[1:32:20.800 --> 1:32:24.000]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:27.160]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:28.560]  You know, I could think again,
[1:32:28.560 --> 1:32:30.400]  I could connect with people again.
[1:32:30.400 --> 1:32:33.200]  And over the course of the next couple of years,
[1:32:33.200 --> 1:32:35.840]  I got my health back and I religiously took basically
[1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:36.840]  all of your supplements.
[1:32:36.840 --> 1:32:39.200]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[1:32:39.200 --> 1:32:41.040]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[1:32:41.040 --> 1:32:43.240]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[1:32:43.240 --> 1:32:44.520]  It's amazing, it works.
[1:32:44.520 --> 1:32:47.160]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[1:32:47.160 --> 1:32:49.600]  We have to break free of the globalist system
[1:32:49.600 --> 1:32:52.120]  and the only way to do that is to take our own health
[1:32:52.120 --> 1:32:53.240]  into our own hands.
[1:32:53.240 --> 1:32:54.440]  Beautifully said, brother.
[1:32:54.440 --> 1:32:56.760]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[1:32:58.760 --> 1:33:03.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:33:03.320 --> 1:33:05.160]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:16.520 --> 1:33:18.840]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America.
[1:33:18.840 --> 1:33:21.760]  This is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:23.840]  Right now, I got a few words for some of our brothers
[1:33:23.840 --> 1:33:25.800]  and sisters in the occupied zone.
[1:33:25.800 --> 1:33:27.840]  The chair is against the wall.
[1:33:27.840 --> 1:33:30.040]  The chair is against the wall.
[1:33:30.040 --> 1:33:32.040]  John has a long mustache.
[1:33:32.040 --> 1:33:34.080]  John has a long mustache.
[1:33:34.080 --> 1:33:37.120]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[1:33:37.120 --> 1:33:39.840]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines,
[1:33:39.840 --> 1:33:41.520]  this is your song.
[1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:46.960]  MUSIC
[1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:48.840]  But they took a lot of people away.
[1:33:48.840 --> 1:33:50.960]  People that they thought were going to make trouble for them.
[1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:52.640]  People that had guns and things they wanted,
[1:33:52.640 --> 1:33:54.200]  they just took them away.
[1:33:54.200 --> 1:33:55.560]  Where?
[1:33:55.560 --> 1:33:57.640]  We had education camps, that's what they call it.
[1:33:57.640 --> 1:33:59.160]  So part of the thing we have to break through
[1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:02.280]  are kind of a private idea that kids belong to their parents
[1:34:02.280 --> 1:34:03.600]  or kids belong to their families
[1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:05.680]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:11.600]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:15.880]  And we need to have camps that you all run.
[1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:17.120]  I mean, really.
[1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:20.520]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:22.840]  Now they were taken to race tracks and fairgrounds
[1:34:22.840 --> 1:34:24.320]  where the army almost overnight
[1:34:24.320 --> 1:34:25.800]  had built assembly centers here.
[1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:27.520]  Come on, I'm a sorry, citizen.
[1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:29.560]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:32.480]  What kind of a situation in the US would you see that happening?
[1:34:32.480 --> 1:34:33.880]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitution
[1:34:33.880 --> 1:34:37.160]  with a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:39.480]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military
[1:34:39.480 --> 1:34:42.880]  that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs
[1:34:42.880 --> 1:34:47.040]  and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[1:34:47.040 --> 1:34:49.080]  These people are radicalized
[1:34:49.080 --> 1:34:50.920]  and they don't support the United States
[1:34:50.920 --> 1:34:52.960]  and they're disloyal to the United States.
[1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:55.320]  It's our right and our obligation
[1:34:55.320 --> 1:35:04.320]  to segregate them from the normal community.
[1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:06.880]  It's what we're doing here and let's not kid about it.
[1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:08.680]  We're building a domestic army
[1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:11.920]  because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:15.000]  Put your gun down, really?
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:21.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:26.560]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:31.320]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots
[1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:34.840]  are not, they're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:37.360]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:35:37.360 --> 1:35:56.360]  you are the resistance.
[1:35:56.360 --> 1:36:20.360]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this tragic scene
[1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:25.360]  where any illiciters will be describing it for all of you.
[1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:27.360]  But we're here to get the facts on what happened
[1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:29.360]  Monday afternoon in Ivaldi, Texas.
[1:36:29.360 --> 1:36:33.360]  I wanted to get my friend who's a school safety trainer
[1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:35.360]  for the police but also does it for courthouses,
[1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:37.360]  you name it, Tim Enlow in on Monday and Tuesday,
[1:36:37.360 --> 1:36:40.360]  but he said he wanted to get more facts.
[1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:43.360]  At first, the media said that a state police
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:45.360]  were chasing him with a border patrol
[1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:46.360]  and then he crashed the vehicle,
[1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:48.360]  ran the school sort of shooting people.
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:49.360]  That's not the case.
[1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:51.360]  He went and barricaded himself in a classroom
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:53.360]  behind an armored door, was holding hostages.
[1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:56.360]  That's confirmed but it's not being pushed in the news.
[1:36:56.360 --> 1:36:58.360]  You have to dig to find that.
[1:36:58.360 --> 1:37:01.360]  And they're just saying the police just stood down
[1:37:01.360 --> 1:37:03.360]  and now Biden's demonizing the police and others are.
[1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:06.360]  We saw them stand down at Parkland a few years ago.
[1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:08.360]  We saw them do that, of course, 20 something years ago
[1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:10.360]  at Columbine, not 23 years ago.
[1:37:10.360 --> 1:37:12.360]  And we can always learn a lot from this
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:15.360]  but it's not the police fault, it's evil people's fault
[1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:18.360]  and it's not the gun's fault, it's Psycho's fault.
[1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:20.360]  And just like the white supremacist,
[1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:21.360]  he said he was going to shoot up a school,
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:23.360]  he said he was going to attack people.
[1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:25.360]  He'd been red flagged, nothing was done.
[1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:28.360]  So Tim Inlow is here with us to talk about this
[1:37:28.360 --> 1:37:31.360]  and he can give you what his sources are telling him
[1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:33.360]  and what is known.
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:35.360]  And so again, if the police do something bad,
[1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:37.360]  we will be the first to tell you, police aren't perfect.
[1:37:37.360 --> 1:37:39.360]  Everything needs to be up to scrutiny including us.
[1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:41.360]  That keeps us on our toes and helps to be better people.
[1:37:41.360 --> 1:37:45.360]  But changing the song of the police away from the Psycho
[1:37:45.360 --> 1:37:47.360]  is garbage in my view.
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:49.360]  So Tim, take over wherever you'd like to start
[1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:51.360]  with the information you have and what happened here.
[1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:53.360]  Well, first of all, I'd like to say that
[1:37:53.360 --> 1:37:56.360]  we're still in the very, very early stages
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:37:58.360]  of the investigation, right?
[1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:02.360]  So there's new facts coming out literally every hour, every day, right?
[1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:06.360]  But what we're hearing right now is just as you alluded to
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:10.360]  at the intro and that is that it now appears
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:14.360]  that some kind of contact was made with the shooter
[1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:18.360]  by law enforcement before he went into the school
[1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:21.360]  and then somehow he managed to enter the school,
[1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:25.360]  enter a classroom and then potentially lock that door
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:29.360]  or somehow barricade that door to where law enforcement
[1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:32.360]  couldn't immediately go in after him.
[1:38:32.360 --> 1:38:35.360]  The other thing is that I'm hearing is that, you know,
[1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:37.360]  at first we were led to believe that this guy
[1:38:37.360 --> 1:38:39.360]  ran into school and just started shooting.
[1:38:39.360 --> 1:38:42.360]  But now they're saying that he may have been in that classroom
[1:38:42.360 --> 1:38:47.360]  for upwards of 30 to 45 minutes not killing
[1:38:47.360 --> 1:38:50.360]  while law enforcement kind of treated it as
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:56.360]  a barricaded subject type call rather than an active shooter call, right?
[1:38:56.360 --> 1:39:02.360]  And if that's the case, then obviously that's going to have to be looked at
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:05.360]  and we're going to have to look at in the future
[1:39:05.360 --> 1:39:08.360]  how we deal with that in law enforcement.
[1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:12.360]  Because again, they're hardening the facilities to keep these crazy people,
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:14.360]  these demon terrorists out,
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:18.360]  but then they can actually use that hardening once they're in to keep the police out.
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:20.360]  That's exactly right.
[1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:23.360]  And unfortunately, I think what we're probably going to see
[1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:30.360]  and what I'm hearing is that at least the very initial officers that were on scene,
[1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:35.360]  that they probably did not have the breaching equipment that they needed
[1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:37.360]  to immediately breach that door.
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:39.360]  That's right, they had to find a teacher with a key
[1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:41.360]  while he's shooting reportedly through the door.
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:44.360]  And so obviously that's problematic, right?
[1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:49.360]  We're going to have to look at, and you've covered it for the last few days, right?
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:52.360]  There's all these outcries about, oh, we need to do something, gun control,
[1:39:52.360 --> 1:39:56.360]  the usual drivel that we hear from the left when this happens.
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:00.360]  But what we're really dealing with here is not taking things away.
[1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:02.360]  What we need to do is give more.
[1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:05.360]  And for example, the law enforcement, they need more equipment.
[1:40:05.360 --> 1:40:09.360]  Every law enforcement officer should have a breaching tool in his car
[1:40:09.360 --> 1:40:18.360]  that will either battering ram or some kind of pry bar,
[1:40:18.360 --> 1:40:22.360]  something that they can breach doors with, right?
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:26.360]  And with that, obviously, those officers are going to have to be trained, right?
[1:40:26.360 --> 1:40:29.360]  What about what the military uses, like the Delta Force,
[1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:33.360]  where they use a shotgun that fires out projectiles
[1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:36.360]  but they dissipate and they breach the door that way?
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:39.360]  And law enforcement have had breaching rounds for a long time.
[1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:44.360]  However, you've got to keep in mind that that's not always going to be effective, okay?
[1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:47.360]  You have to look at, was it an inward opening door?
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:49.360]  Was it an outward opening door?
[1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:52.360]  All those kind of things are going to come into play
[1:40:52.360 --> 1:40:55.360]  with what kind of breaching equipment is going to be effective.
[1:40:55.360 --> 1:40:58.360]  And again, that takes training.
[1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:02.360]  Training that the average patrol officer right now still does not usually get.
[1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:06.360]  And let's think about, well, come out and go through all this, Tim, and your expertise on it, which is great to have you here.
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:08.360]  And I appreciate you being here.
[1:41:08.360 --> 1:41:11.360]  Imagine the police have to go in and then see all these dead kids.
[1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:13.360]  They're not the villains.
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:15.360]  They're trying to protect us.
[1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:18.360]  And obviously, these police in Texas, we know, wanted to go in
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:21.360]  and a board patrol guy did finally kill this crazy animal.
[1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:24.360]  But just the media changed the subject to the police is not good.
[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:26.360]  Yeah, and that's ridiculous, right?
[1:41:26.360 --> 1:41:28.360]  I mean, this guy took a grazing round.
[1:41:28.360 --> 1:41:33.360]  Our attack officer took a grazing round to the head, had to get stitches in the top of his head, right?
[1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:38.360]  He was lucky to be alive, and he still apparently managed to put the suspect down.
[1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:44.360]  This is not, again, this is not law enforcement's fault, per se, in any way, shape, or form.
[1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:51.360]  However, it's been now 23 years, I believe, since Columbine, right?
[1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:59.360]  And if 19 kids and two teachers were being killed in a school 23 years after Columbine,
[1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:01.360]  then we still have to make some changes.
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:08.360]  And those changes are, again, related to better training, better equipment, and maybe tactics, I don't know.
[1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:11.360]  But we're going to have to take a hard look at this.
[1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:14.360]  We're going to go to break, Tim, in low here with us.
[1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:17.360]  What are some of the other issues you want to walk people through?
[1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:21.360]  Can you talk about training for people, what the police are being taught?
[1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:26.360]  Yeah, I mean, you know, when I went through the train to train a course at the Alert Center,
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:32.360]  which is the center here in Texas that teaches active shooter tactics for law enforcement,
[1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:37.360]  breaching at that time for that course was not part of the curriculum, right?
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:39.360]  Breaching doors and things like that.
[1:42:39.360 --> 1:42:45.360]  I think that's something we're going to have to look at to train the first responders in breaching,
[1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:51.360]  that every first responder should at least have some basic breaching knowledge and breaching tools.
[1:42:51.360 --> 1:42:53.360]  I think we're going to have to look at that.
[1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:55.360]  More importantly, though, again...
[1:42:55.360 --> 1:42:57.360]  Hold on, we'll be right back.
[1:42:57.360 --> 1:43:02.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have contracted with one of the top companies in the United States
[1:43:02.360 --> 1:43:06.360]  that supplies the Pentagon, the military, the CIA, the FBI, you name it,

[1:43:56.360 --> 1:44:01.360]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans.
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:05.360]  They financed major universities, they ran full page stories
[1:44:05.360 --> 1:44:10.360]  and advertisements pushing their propaganda at the New York Times, other major newspapers,
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:14.360]  that the family, as we know it, is a bad thing and must be ended.
[1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:19.360]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women
[1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:24.360]  that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:28.360]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national daughter.
[1:44:28.360 --> 1:44:31.360]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well.
[1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:32.360]  I love to make breakfast.
[1:44:32.360 --> 1:44:36.360]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family
[1:44:36.360 --> 1:44:41.360]  and be nurturative and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:45.360]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding,
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:48.360]  is our normal biological actions are coming together.
[1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:49.360]  They really are.
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:53.360]  Sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that will domesticate us
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:57.360]  and turn us into lab rats that we cannot let this continue.
[1:44:57.360 --> 1:45:01.360]  Your voice counts.
[1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:06.360]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[1:45:06.360 --> 1:45:09.360]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:45:09.360 --> 1:45:10.360]  They know you're angry.
[1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:16.360]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:07.360]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the sensors
[1:46:07.360 --> 1:46:12.360]  has been Patriot Apparel so we can identify each other so we can spread the word
[1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:15.360]  and so we can push people to websites like infowars.com
[1:46:15.360 --> 1:46:18.360]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:20.360]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced
[1:46:20.360 --> 1:46:22.360]  we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts,
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:25.360]  some of which go back more than 25 years.
[1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:26.360]  All these shirts are limited edition.
[1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:31.360]  They are about to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer or your wardrobe.
[1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:35.360]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left.
[1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:37.360]  In a couple of weeks they'll all be gone and they'll be history.
[1:46:37.360 --> 1:46:42.360]  We're selling them all at cost at infowars.com.
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:44.360]  So thank you all for your support.
[1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:48.360]  Please visit infowars.com and get one of these historic shirts,
[1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:52.360]  hoodies, long sleeves, ball caps, you name it, while you still can.
[1:46:52.360 --> 1:46:54.360]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:46:54.360 --> 1:47:18.360]  Please visit infowars.com.
[1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:23.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the footage of at least 14 minutes after
[1:47:23.360 --> 1:47:30.360]  they knew that there was a shooter inside of Parkland High School in Florida a few years ago,
[1:47:30.360 --> 1:47:34.360]  Cruz, the shooter, and they didn't go in.
[1:47:34.360 --> 1:47:36.360]  They definitely stood down.
[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:38.360]  And that's terrible.
[1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:41.360]  And it happened for almost an hour at Columbine.
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:44.360]  And the answer is we can't expect police to always be there and protect us.
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:46.360]  It's not their job to protect us.
[1:47:46.360 --> 1:47:47.360]  They try to.
[1:47:47.360 --> 1:47:50.360]  Their job in the Constitution is to enforce the law of, you know,
[1:47:50.360 --> 1:47:53.360]  take them to jails for the court system and the juries.
[1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:58.360]  So we don't know all the details, but it is confirmed by the state police,
[1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:03.360]  by the local police and court patrol that he was in a barricaded position inside a classroom holding people hostage.
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:06.360]  We have other people saying, oh, they heard he came in and said,
[1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:07.360]  you're all going to die as sort of shooting people.
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:08.360]  Well, how do they know that?
[1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:09.360]  Are they all died?
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:11.360]  We'll find out what happened here.
[1:48:11.360 --> 1:48:13.360]  The issue is they're blaming the gun owners.
[1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:16.360]  They're blaming the Second Amendment and taking guns away from law-abiding people we know won't work.
[1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:18.360]  Look at the cities where they're taking the guns.
[1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:22.360]  Look at Venezuela with a much higher crime rate with guns than us or Mexico.
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:25.360]  They had a massacre that I've got here in the stack we'll be getting to.
[1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:30.360]  But, you know, Tim, you're a humble guy, but you've been in the Army, the Marines, Blackwater,
[1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:31.360]  a bunch of other agencies.
[1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:35.360]  You've been a police officer in Austin and you train all the time,
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:37.360]  major police departments on this.
[1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:40.360]  And next hour we get some of the actual training that goes on,
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:43.360]  but we'll get back into the latest info we have.
[1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:48.360]  And I'm not here in some worship the police brown-nosing position
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:50.360]  because I know the police have their own problems.
[1:48:50.360 --> 1:48:53.360]  The Globals are trying to demonize police departments to take them over.
[1:48:53.360 --> 1:48:58.360]  So then we really will have a problem, you know, like the police in Globals-controlled countries.
[1:48:58.360 --> 1:49:03.360]  But just as a father, because I know you've got children like I do, older ones, younger ones like I do.
[1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:06.360]  And it obviously hits you in the guts.
[1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:08.360]  Some of your children just had a graduation yesterday.
[1:49:08.360 --> 1:49:10.360]  My five-year-old daughter just turned five.
[1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:13.360]  I was sick of the mayo. She just had her graduation today.
[1:49:13.360 --> 1:49:17.360]  You look at this, you just can't imagine somebody doing this and executing children.
[1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:20.360]  And again, let's not forget, that's who did this.
[1:49:20.360 --> 1:49:24.360]  And you can't expect a plumber to come to your house and fix the pipe in an hour.
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:27.360]  Imagine police showing up and they don't even know what's going on.
[1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:30.360]  And they're told there's a guy barricaded in with children.
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:31.360]  Then that process happens.
[1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:34.360]  The image of them tasering people and arresting people trying to break in.
[1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:36.360]  I don't blame those parents either. This is a mess.
[1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:38.360]  But it's the evil guy that caused this.
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:41.360]  So it's just getting into training or getting into any points you want to make them.
[1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:45.360]  Because you know, I'll just take over here about as a real professional expert
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:49.360]  that's seen war zones, you name it, trains police for this type of stuff.
[1:49:49.360 --> 1:49:54.360]  What your best understanding is and just other points you'd like to impart to folks.
[1:49:54.360 --> 1:49:59.360]  Well, again, I think the biggest thing I'm seeing, and I didn't tell you this before the show,
[1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:04.360]  but I actually wrote my kid's superintendent yesterday, right?
[1:50:04.360 --> 1:50:08.360]  Because he issued an email about the shooting and everything, and you know, it was the standard.
[1:50:08.360 --> 1:50:11.360]  Oh, you know, we're so sorry about what happened.
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:12.360]  Our hearts go out.
[1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:17.360]  And then he mentioned an increased police presence possibly at the school for the next few days.
[1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:24.360]  Well, their idea of an increased police presence was an officer pretty much in plain clothes
[1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:29.360]  with just a pistol that was inside the school kind of walking around, right?
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:33.360]  And again, this goes to equipment and it goes to mindset.
[1:50:33.360 --> 1:50:39.360]  What I'm constantly seeing still is that we're afraid in this country for an officer
[1:50:39.360 --> 1:50:43.360]  to be walking around with an assault rifle in a school.
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:47.360]  Why? Because it freaks, you know, they think it's going to freak parents out.
[1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:49.360]  Well, we know, statistically, that'll scare the perps away.
[1:50:49.360 --> 1:50:52.360]  No, these are places that are death by cop.
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:55.360]  Go die like a devil, kill a bunch of kids, be famous.
[1:50:55.360 --> 1:50:58.360]  They just advertise like a neon sign, this is the place to come.
[1:50:58.360 --> 1:50:59.360]  Right, that's exactly right.
[1:50:59.360 --> 1:51:02.360]  And listen, I think, you know, again, we don't have all the facts.
[1:51:02.360 --> 1:51:06.360]  If the police couldn't get into the classroom, we don't know if the shooter shot right away.
[1:51:06.360 --> 1:51:08.360]  But because there's conflicting reports on that, right?
[1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:14.360]  But what we do know is that every single report so far has said that the shooter was in a barricaded,
[1:51:14.360 --> 1:51:18.360]  some type of barricaded position when they were engaging him, right?
[1:51:18.360 --> 1:51:21.360]  Now, the important thing to remember here is this, right?
[1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:26.360]  A gunfight, what I like to always tell people, if somebody has a knife,
[1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:29.360]  I'm going to try to bring a gun to that fight, right?
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:32.360]  I'm not going to try to fight a guy a knife with a knife.
[1:51:32.360 --> 1:51:34.360]  If he has a knife, I'm going to bring a gun.
[1:51:34.360 --> 1:51:36.360]  If he has a handgun, I want to have a rifle.
[1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:38.360]  If he, you know, and so forth.
[1:51:38.360 --> 1:51:46.360]  So putting police officers in with just a handgun and expecting them to come out winning against guys with assault rifles,
[1:51:46.360 --> 1:51:49.360]  it's not that it can't be done.
[1:51:49.360 --> 1:51:52.360]  It can be done if those officers are trained properly.
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:53.360]  However...
[1:51:53.360 --> 1:51:56.360]  And if they have an STI staccato that shoots as good as an AR-15.
[1:51:56.360 --> 1:51:59.360]  But it definitely makes the job harder, right? It definitely makes the job...
[1:51:59.360 --> 1:52:02.360]  They're not a sponsor, they should be. We both have those guns.
[1:52:02.360 --> 1:52:05.360]  We can shoot small targets at like 50 to 100 yards, those all day long.
[1:52:05.360 --> 1:52:08.360]  Yeah, there's a lot of handguns out there today that are very accurate.
[1:52:08.360 --> 1:52:15.360]  But again, when you're talking about a round that goes 900 feet per second versus a round that goes, you know, 2600 feet...
[1:52:15.360 --> 1:52:17.360]  Body armor is going to stop a 9mm.
[1:52:17.360 --> 1:52:18.360]  Right, exactly, right?
[1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:22.360]  So there's all these different reports again that some officers may have shot at him,
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:24.360]  but he still made it into the school.
[1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:27.360]  What's the best thing for him to have then? What would be the best firearm?
[1:52:27.360 --> 1:52:32.360]  Well, again, I think for school security, I think these officers need to have AR-15s.
[1:52:32.360 --> 1:52:37.360]  Absolutely, and not locked away in some locker somewhere, but they need to have them on their person.
[1:52:37.360 --> 1:52:39.360]  And they're big boys, they can carry them around their back.
[1:52:39.360 --> 1:52:43.360]  Absolutely, absolutely, right? And I think that should be standard.
[1:52:43.360 --> 1:52:48.360]  And more importantly, first of all, not all schools have, still don't have,
[1:52:48.360 --> 1:52:52.360]  school resource officers or police officers stationed at the schools.
[1:52:52.360 --> 1:52:59.360]  It's time that changes. Every school in America needs to have an armed, trained security officer or police officer.
[1:52:59.360 --> 1:53:03.360]  Well, I went to a little tiny private Christian school my daughter goes to,
[1:53:03.360 --> 1:53:06.360]  and for the first time ever, they had an armed security guard out there.
[1:53:06.360 --> 1:53:08.360]  That's right, right.
[1:53:08.360 --> 1:53:10.360]  And again, in this day and age...
[1:53:10.360 --> 1:53:12.360]  Do you believe we have to protect our children from these demons?
[1:53:12.360 --> 1:53:16.360]  It's a shame, but look, this is not nothing new, right?
[1:53:16.360 --> 1:53:17.360]  And you look at Israel.
[1:53:17.360 --> 1:53:20.360]  Israel has had armed guards at their schools for decades.
[1:53:20.360 --> 1:53:22.360]  They've had jihadi targeting schools for 30 years.
[1:53:22.360 --> 1:53:27.360]  Exactly, and they learned early on that the best way to deter that is to have someone with an assault rifle
[1:53:27.360 --> 1:53:30.360]  standing in front of that school or, you know, on that school property.
[1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:33.360]  And nobody makes a big deal about it when the teacher's got an Uzi in her desk.
[1:53:33.360 --> 1:53:34.360]  Exactly.
[1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:36.360]  And they never have teachers killing the kids with the Uzi.
[1:53:36.360 --> 1:53:44.360]  Yeah, and again, in this country, we want to make excuses, but what we don't want to do is make sure that our teachers,
[1:53:44.360 --> 1:53:50.360]  our police officers, have the proper training and have the proper equipment to deal with these kinds of situations.
[1:53:50.360 --> 1:53:52.360]  Isn't this the reason to have the Second Amendment?
[1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:55.360]  That the society is degrading and degenerating and producing?
[1:53:55.360 --> 1:53:56.360]  Absolutely, absolutely, yeah.
[1:53:56.360 --> 1:54:00.360]  And again, if you look at, you know, the Bortak officer that shot...
[1:54:00.360 --> 1:54:02.360]  That's reportedly, anyway, shot the guy.
[1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:04.360]  From what I'm reading, he was off duty.
[1:54:04.360 --> 1:54:06.360]  He was off duty when this happened.
[1:54:06.360 --> 1:54:07.360]  He heard the call on the radio.
[1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:12.360]  He geared up and he made a straight B line for that school to see if he could help out, right?
[1:54:12.360 --> 1:54:16.360]  And that's good, because while they were sitting outside thinking it might be a hot situation,
[1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:20.360]  he was the guy reportedly going, the guy was barricaded, shooting at him to the door.
[1:54:20.360 --> 1:54:25.360]  So there is an issue of the police milling around outside waiting for orders.
[1:54:25.360 --> 1:54:27.360]  I think that's the bureaucracy.
[1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:28.360]  Well, you train people on this.
[1:54:28.360 --> 1:54:29.360]  What would you have done?
[1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:32.360]  I know you don't want a Monday morning quarterback this time.
[1:54:32.360 --> 1:54:33.360]  Right, that's tough.
[1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:34.360]  But here's the thing.
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:40.360]  I think what we all need to come to the realization of is that if there is a report
[1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:48.360]  or if a subject is seen going into a school armed, it doesn't matter at that moment if he's shooting or not.
[1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:52.360]  That suspect has to immediately be confronted by law enforcement.
[1:54:52.360 --> 1:54:56.360]  Well, I think if you're going into school with a gun, out with it openly, menacing,
[1:54:56.360 --> 1:54:58.360]  do you see to be killed?
[1:54:58.360 --> 1:55:00.360]  Well, and again, you know, there's...
[1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:04.360]  Every state has laws for citizens and for police,
[1:55:04.360 --> 1:55:07.360]  as far as how to deal when deadly force is authorized, right?
[1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:18.360]  But again, I think the empirical data now is such that no one goes into a school brandishing an AR-15 with good intentions.
[1:55:18.360 --> 1:55:23.360]  Okay, and I think we need to realize that and the police need to be trained to respond to that.
[1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:28.360]  And again, we don't know yet if this is going to be a training issue, whether or not they were waiting
[1:55:28.360 --> 1:55:33.360]  because they didn't hear gunshots immediately or whether a suspect started shooting and they couldn't get in.
[1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:34.360]  We don't know.
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:35.360]  That's right.
[1:55:35.360 --> 1:55:39.360]  That's right. So all the second guessings of the facts are in by the left and others.
[1:55:39.360 --> 1:55:41.360]  It's just disgusting opportunism.
[1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:43.360]  That's exactly right, right?
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:52.360]  But again, I will just say this, 23 years after Columbine, there is absolutely no reason why 19 children
[1:55:52.360 --> 1:55:56.360]  and two teachers should still be getting killed before the suspect is taken out.
[1:55:56.360 --> 1:56:01.360]  In almost every case, they are already threatening to attack and people are warning.
[1:56:01.360 --> 1:56:06.360]  This guy was reportedly running around doing all sorts of mischief, violence, shooting people with BB guns.
[1:56:06.360 --> 1:56:08.360]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[1:56:08.360 --> 1:56:15.360]  Right, and again, I don't know if the reports are accurate, but I've heard even self-mutilation, cutting his face.
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:17.360]  What his friends were saying.
[1:56:17.360 --> 1:56:22.360]  Right, being aggressive toward female staff where he worked briefly, things like that.
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:26.360]  These are all warning signs and again, it goes back to people have to speak up, right?
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:30.360]  If you have a suspicion about someone, if someone really seems off,
[1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:35.360]  there's nothing wrong with speaking out and saying, hey, somebody needs to check this guy out.
[1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:39.360]  I'm not saying this is staged, I don't believe it was staged.
[1:56:39.360 --> 1:56:43.360]  I'm just saying we're going into the midterms and now all this is starting to happen.
[1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:46.360]  It's just demonic like what? It's weird.
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:51.360]  Well, and the other thing I would caution is that one of the things we always see after large attacks like this
[1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:53.360]  is copycats, right?
[1:56:53.360 --> 1:56:56.360]  So I think law enforcement needs to be prepared.
[1:56:56.360 --> 1:57:00.360]  I think civilians should be very aware of their surroundings.
[1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:01.360]  Everybody should be on alert.
[1:57:01.360 --> 1:57:04.360]  That's exactly right. You need to be paying attention.
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:10.360]  When I dropped my kid off at school again, I was checking out every single thing that I could,
[1:57:10.360 --> 1:57:18.360]  because again, it's not uncommon for people to see this, other mentally ill people to see this and want to make a name for it.
[1:57:18.360 --> 1:57:22.360]  And that's it. There's always a mentally ill people, but the media hyping school shootings,
[1:57:22.360 --> 1:57:27.360]  I've got major studies here in the stack today, 100% causal connection to when there is an event,
[1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:31.360]  more events come, and when the media hypes it forever, they're like hoping it happens again.
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:35.360]  And that's exactly right, because for them it's ratings, it's ratings, it's coverage, right?
[1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:38.360]  So it's a shame that it's that way, but...
[1:57:38.360 --> 1:57:41.360]  Tim, Tim, stay there. Let's talk about some of the security at schools
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:42.360]  and how you think it can be improved.
[1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:44.360]  And hour number three, stay with us.

[2:00:14.360 --> 2:00:33.360]  Hello boys and girls. I have a special message for you from the President of the United States.
[2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:46.360]  In the Council of Government we must guard against the acquisition of unwanted interest, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[2:00:46.360 --> 2:00:56.360]  And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[2:00:56.360 --> 2:01:03.360]  There has been an attempt that perhaps you know now on the life of President Kennedy.
[2:01:03.360 --> 2:01:10.360]  The initial attack on the destroyer of Maddox on August 2nd was repeated today.
[2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:16.360]  Psychological warfare operations went into high gear.
[2:01:16.360 --> 2:01:26.360]  Retaliation for this unprovoked attack on the high seas. Our forces have struck the bases used by the North Vietnamese patrol craft.
[2:01:26.360 --> 2:01:36.360]  It would allow the President to wage war in Vietnam.
[2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:53.360]  In 1976, Flight 455, which took off from Venezuela bound for Cuba, suddenly exploded.
[2:01:53.360 --> 2:02:08.360]  All 73 passengers and 5 crew members aboard it died after the plane crashed near Barbara Island.
[2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:17.360]  William Colby has been missing since April 27th. His canoe was found washed up on the banks of the Waikomiko River, April 28th.
[2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:23.360]  I don't have to tell you things of bad. Everybody knows things of bad.
[2:02:23.360 --> 2:02:35.360]  I've always felt the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:39.360]  What is the Trilateral Commission?
[2:02:39.360 --> 2:02:50.360]  It was founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller. The really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[2:02:50.360 --> 2:03:01.360]  To work to erase national boundaries and create an international community and in time bring about a one world government with David Rockefeller calling the shots.
[2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:04.360]  I understand he was tapped for skull and bones.
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:08.360]  Tapped for it? Sir, he found it skull and bones.
[2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:11.360]  I think everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:18.360]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is please at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[2:03:18.360 --> 2:03:24.360]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel belt and radios and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.
[2:03:24.360 --> 2:03:28.360]  Well, I'm not going to leave you alone. I want you to get back.
[2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:31.360]  We have done the right thing. It's not going to be easy.
[2:03:31.360 --> 2:03:39.360]  I'm going to show you this. We can and we will and we must prevail.
[2:03:39.360 --> 2:03:52.360]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:03:52.360 --> 2:04:07.360]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:23.360]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective. The great awakening is here.
[2:04:23.360 --> 2:04:48.360]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share. Support the Information War at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[2:04:48.360 --> 2:04:58.360]  Infowars.com

[2:05:49.360 --> 2:05:58.360]  You are really missing out if you don't experience what Alpha Power does. It has improved my life and so many others, just incredible levels.
[2:05:58.360 --> 2:06:11.360]  51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them. Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in. I would have done it.
[2:06:11.360 --> 2:06:15.360]  When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.
[2:06:15.360 --> 2:06:24.360]  You've heard people say, you'll have to pry my gun for my cold ban. Okay.
[2:06:24.360 --> 2:06:31.360]  We have introduced an assault weapons ban. I'm talking about a ban on assault rifles.
[2:06:31.360 --> 2:06:35.360]  If you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking.
[2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:40.360]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[2:06:40.360 --> 2:06:47.360]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[2:06:47.360 --> 2:06:49.360]  Enough. Enough. Enough.
[2:06:49.360 --> 2:06:56.360]  We say no more. I'm the guy that originally wrote the assault weapons ban that became law.
[2:06:56.360 --> 2:07:04.360]  A gentleman just walked up to me in his picture line. He says, I have an AR-15 and I will turn this in if it means saving the lives of our kids.
[2:07:04.360 --> 2:07:12.360]  Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We're not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.
[2:07:12.360 --> 2:07:22.360]  Do you think Trump is responsible for what happened? I said, well, look, I mean, obviously he didn't pull the trigger, but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.
[2:07:22.360 --> 2:07:30.360]  I'm incredibly saddened and it's very hard to think about this.
[2:07:30.360 --> 2:07:38.360]  I'm tired of hearing people all they have to offer is thoughts and prayers. In my faith, people say faith without works is dead.
[2:07:38.360 --> 2:07:45.360]  So we will find a way, but the reason we have a problem right now is we've let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate.
[2:07:45.360 --> 2:07:48.360]  It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda.
[2:07:48.360 --> 2:07:56.360]  Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street, period, and we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements.
[2:07:56.360 --> 2:08:06.360]  Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban. Everyone up here favors magazine limitations, which by the way would have made a huge difference.
[2:08:06.360 --> 2:08:08.360]  We can ban the weapons of war.
[2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:16.360]  It's about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities. Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible.
[2:08:16.360 --> 2:08:19.360]  They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities.
[2:08:19.360 --> 2:08:27.360]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[2:08:27.360 --> 2:08:32.360]  By the way, you can't own the following weapons, period. They cannot be sold anymore.
[2:08:32.360 --> 2:08:36.360]  Like, if you're going to take people's guns away, wait till you get elected, then take the guns away.
[2:08:36.360 --> 2:08:38.360]  Don't tell them ahead of time.
[2:08:38.360 --> 2:08:42.360]  By the way, that's what people like me think you're going to do.
[2:08:46.360 --> 2:08:53.360]  So that's who these people are. They've all got armed guards, but they don't want you to have a right to a second amendment, even though statistically guns stop crime.
[2:08:53.360 --> 2:09:02.360]  Dozens, more than dozens, 20, 30, 40 percent times more than they're used in crime. It's just insane.
[2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:05.360]  Just like when an Islamist uses a truck to run somebody over.
[2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:11.360]  Tim Inlow is a school safety training expert for the police. He also trains police for the court of security, you name it.
[2:09:11.360 --> 2:09:16.360]  And there is a timeline. The state police on Monday lay out a timeline.
[2:09:16.360 --> 2:09:20.360]  And now that timeline, the LA Times and others have looked into it. They're saying it's accurate.
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:26.360]  And other news agencies are reporting it. Tim Inlow, why don't you go over the timeline of what we know now that indeed he did barricade himself in?
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:39.360]  So the latest report, which was posted about an hour ago, says that at 11.32 a.m., he did exchange gunfire or gunfire was exchanged outside the school.
[2:09:39.360 --> 2:09:49.360]  And then he managed to get into school. And then the latest report says at around 11.43 a.m., he's reported killed.
[2:09:49.360 --> 2:10:01.360]  So we're looking at probably around 11 minutes from the time he was shooting or there was gunfire outside the school until reports are in that he's been put down.
[2:10:01.360 --> 2:10:09.360]  And again, we don't know if those reports are 100 percent accurate, but it certainly gives a more definitive timeline than what we've had so far.
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:13.360]  And unfortunately, 11 minutes is a long time.
[2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:20.360]  It is a long time, but so we'll have to learn more as this unfolds.
[2:10:20.360 --> 2:10:26.360]  Absolutely, yeah. And again, you know, it'll be interesting to see how this plays out.
[2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:31.360]  What kind of equipment the first officers who contacted them had them? What kind of equipment they had? Did they have rifles?
[2:10:31.360 --> 2:10:35.360]  Did they only have handguns? How far away were they?
[2:10:35.360 --> 2:10:44.360]  You know, but for me, the most problematic thing is multiple reports are saying he somehow entered a backdoor to the school, which was open.
[2:10:44.360 --> 2:10:54.360]  And in this day and age, I don't understand why schools aren't making sure throughout the day that all their doors are properly secured.
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:11:02.360]  Alex, if you know, I have a refrigerator at home, if I leave that door open on the refrigerator for more than 10 seconds, it starts beeping.
[2:11:02.360 --> 2:11:08.360]  So you would think, and that's a refrigerator, so you would think at schools, there should be some kind of little alarm system on the doors,
[2:11:08.360 --> 2:11:14.360]  where if the doors accidentally left a jar, left open, that a small alarm sounds, right, so that the teachers know.
[2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:22.360]  Well, I mean, why not do what's at my house? Why not have a fence with a gate, and then whoever's authorized to have even that first level of entry has it?
[2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:27.360]  Because almost every time it's not a parent, it's not a teacher, it's not somebody that works there, it's somebody from outside.
[2:11:27.360 --> 2:11:34.360]  What about the simple thing of a fence around the schools? As you pointed out, they can harden the actual school with all the portable buildings,
[2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:36.360]  and all the trailers they put up, that doesn't work.
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:43.360]  Right, and that's the other thing, right? We have so many portable buildings now at schools, because schools don't have the funds to build hard building,
[2:11:43.360 --> 2:11:45.360]  or they don't have the space, or whatever the case may be.
[2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:50.360]  But yeah, I do agree that any barriers that you can in place are going to help.
[2:11:50.360 --> 2:12:00.360]  So I think it is time to maybe think about some kind of fencing around school properties and things like that to help people, you know, keep these properties secure.
[2:12:00.360 --> 2:12:09.360]  But here's the biggest issue for me. They kill their mother, they kill their grandmother, they're into Satanism, they're into the occult, they're into self-harming.
[2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:12.360]  They always were all black, it's always the same MO.
[2:12:12.360 --> 2:12:20.360]  Like Cruz in Florida at Parkland, for several years he was kicked out, they called him a school shooter, he was always threatening to do it.
[2:12:20.360 --> 2:12:27.360]  He was kicked out at the time, so the white supremacist in Buffalo, he was threatened to attack the school, they'd come and visit him.
[2:12:27.360 --> 2:12:36.360]  The same thing with Adam Lanza and Sandy Hook, the CIA and FBI had come visiting for hacking, and they knew all this and he got a gun illegally.
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:42.360]  It's like, I mean, it's a certain type of whacked out in-cell person that does this.
[2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:49.360]  I agree, and I think that's another issue that needs to be looked at is that of profiling.
[2:12:49.360 --> 2:12:54.360]  And by profiling, I mean, you know, you have somebody who obviously has mental health issues.
[2:12:54.360 --> 2:13:05.360]  What tools are we going to give to law enforcement to make sure that they can properly screen and assess that person to determine whether or not they pose a threat?
[2:13:05.360 --> 2:13:11.360]  And that may take maybe mental health professionals now working within the police department.
[2:13:11.360 --> 2:13:16.360]  That may take more training for the police officers, I don't know.
[2:13:16.360 --> 2:13:22.360]  But the mental health crisis in this country is going to guarantee that we're going to continue to see shootings and mass murder like this.
[2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:24.360]  And look at the individuals that did this.
[2:13:24.360 --> 2:13:26.360]  I mean, these are obvious psychotics.
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:27.360]  Yeah.
[2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:30.360]  And look, there were abuses in the mental institutions in the US, no doubt.
[2:13:30.360 --> 2:13:35.360]  But after the one who flies over the cuckoo's nest in the 70s, they just got rid of them.
[2:13:35.360 --> 2:13:36.360]  Exactly.
[2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:38.360]  And so you see them all over the street corners everywhere.
[2:13:38.360 --> 2:13:41.360]  Yeah, we don't institutionalize mentally ill people anymore.
[2:13:41.360 --> 2:13:44.360]  And that's one of the problems that we're having.
[2:13:44.360 --> 2:13:51.360]  But more importantly, even, you know, the whole selling idea on that was, oh, we're going to do community-based treatment.
[2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:52.360]  But there is no treatment.
[2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:53.360]  There's no follow-up.
[2:13:53.360 --> 2:13:55.360]  That's right, because crazy people get guns and do things.
[2:13:55.360 --> 2:13:59.360]  We're not at fault, especially when almost every time the red flags are all there and nothing's done.
[2:13:59.360 --> 2:14:00.360]  That's exactly right.
[2:14:00.360 --> 2:14:02.360]  I mean, put that back on screen.
[2:14:02.360 --> 2:14:04.360]  Six of the most famous mass shooters.
[2:14:04.360 --> 2:14:06.360]  Well, there's a dozen or more of them.
[2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:07.360]  I mean, look at them.
[2:14:07.360 --> 2:14:08.360]  And if you look in their eyes.
[2:14:08.360 --> 2:14:09.360]  Look at them.
[2:14:09.360 --> 2:14:11.360]  I mean, my God, you wouldn't let that person cook you a hamburger.
[2:14:11.360 --> 2:14:12.360]  Right.
[2:14:12.360 --> 2:14:13.360]  You would not.
[2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:14.360]  I mean, these people, I mean, look at them.
[2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:15.360]  They're demons.
[2:14:15.360 --> 2:14:16.360]  Yeah.
[2:14:16.360 --> 2:14:23.360]  And again, screening and proper assessment, threat assessment of these individuals is something that is seriously lacking.
[2:14:23.360 --> 2:14:28.360]  They're suicidal, drug addict, crazy people into the occult and every time shoot about games.
[2:14:28.360 --> 2:14:31.360]  And every time I point out, people go, well, don't be against video games.
[2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:32.360]  I play that.
[2:14:32.360 --> 2:14:33.360]  You're not a psycho.
[2:14:33.360 --> 2:14:34.360]  You can play a shoot them up game.
[2:14:34.360 --> 2:14:35.360]  You can play a military game.
[2:14:35.360 --> 2:14:36.360]  It's the M.O.
[2:14:36.360 --> 2:14:37.360]  It's the criminology.
[2:14:37.360 --> 2:14:38.360]  It's the psychology.
[2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:41.360]  I mean, we have a absolute profile on these people.
[2:14:41.360 --> 2:14:44.360]  I've never seen a profile so, so clear and clear cut, Tim.
[2:14:44.360 --> 2:14:45.360]  Right.
[2:14:45.360 --> 2:14:50.360]  And again, you know, apparently this guy was contacting people, sending pictures out of his
[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:52.360]  weapons to people who didn't even know him.
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:53.360]  Right.
[2:14:53.360 --> 2:14:57.360]  Like on Facebook and things like that, like, oh, you know, sending pictures of his AR-15s
[2:14:57.360 --> 2:14:59.360]  purchase and things like that.
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:05.360]  And again, while posting a picture in and of itself is not a threat of any kind.
[2:15:05.360 --> 2:15:06.360]  Right.
[2:15:06.360 --> 2:15:11.360]  But when some person you've never heard of or seen before suddenly sends you a picture
[2:15:11.360 --> 2:15:12.360]  of a gun.
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:13.360]  Right.
[2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:15.360]  You got to start asking some questions like, who are you?
[2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:17.360]  Why are you sending me these pictures?
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:22.360]  What, you know, and it just seems like a lot of things once again fell through the cracks.
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:24.360]  And that's the pattern we see in all these shootings.
[2:15:24.360 --> 2:15:25.360]  It's not about the gun.
[2:15:25.360 --> 2:15:27.360]  It's that that has nothing to do with it.
[2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:28.360]  And now it's coming out.
[2:15:28.360 --> 2:15:29.360]  He did cut himself.
[2:15:29.360 --> 2:15:30.360]  He did threaten.
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:31.360]  Right.
[2:15:31.360 --> 2:15:32.360]  It's all the missed signs along the way.
[2:15:32.360 --> 2:15:34.360]  And nobody is focusing on that.
[2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:40.360]  And nobody is working on how to properly assess these signs in the future to prevent these
[2:15:40.360 --> 2:15:41.360]  kinds of tragedies.
[2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:44.360]  And again, they're depressed, mentally ill people, and the media advertises school shootings.
[2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:48.360]  So now on the menu of options, suicide by cop, kill yourself.
[2:15:48.360 --> 2:15:50.360]  No, I'll just go kill kids at school.
[2:15:50.360 --> 2:15:51.360]  Yeah.
[2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:52.360]  It's an option being put in people's heads.
[2:15:52.360 --> 2:15:53.360]  It's mind control.
[2:15:53.360 --> 2:15:54.360]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:54.360 --> 2:15:55.360]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:55.360 --> 2:16:00.360]  We're now proud to release the Redux line of Faraday bags.
[2:16:00.360 --> 2:16:05.360]  This line features quick roll down and Velcro seal closures with discreet branding.

[2:17:02.360 --> 2:17:06.360]  empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[2:17:06.360 --> 2:17:10.360]  And when it comes to information, boy is that true today.
[2:17:10.360 --> 2:17:17.360]  We see the entire global corrupt, anti-human depopulation, great reset combine, trying to
[2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:24.360]  collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing
[2:17:24.360 --> 2:17:30.360]  the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[2:17:30.360 --> 2:17:36.360]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030,
[2:17:36.360 --> 2:17:39.360]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[2:17:39.360 --> 2:17:41.360]  And none of it can succeed.
[2:17:41.360 --> 2:17:46.360]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[2:17:46.360 --> 2:17:50.360]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[2:17:50.360 --> 2:17:54.360]  And that's why it's hard to share M-Full Wars links and band up video links.
[2:17:54.360 --> 2:18:20.360]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:30.360]  The Red Thunderbolt and then again on the back, a big bold M-Full Wars dot com.
[2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:35.360]  Exercise your First Amendment, don't let the leftist and the globalist bully silence you

[2:19:48.360 --> 2:19:50.360]  we have had together would not have happened.

[2:19:53.360 --> 2:20:17.360]  Visit M-FullWarsStore.com today.
[2:20:24.360 --> 2:20:29.360]  Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[2:20:29.360 --> 2:20:36.360]  And we must ask when in God's name will we do what needs to be done
[2:20:36.360 --> 2:20:42.360]  to if not completely stop fundamentally change the amount of the carnage that goes on in this country.
[2:20:42.360 --> 2:20:48.360]  To state the obvious, according to a lot of other people here, I'm sick and tired.
[2:20:48.360 --> 2:20:54.360]  I'm just sick and tired of what's going on and continues to go on.
[2:20:54.360 --> 2:21:00.360]  I spent my career as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and as vice president
[2:21:00.360 --> 2:21:07.360]  working for common sense gun reforms, as I said as a senator and vice president.
[2:21:07.360 --> 2:21:15.360]  While they clearly will not prevent any tragedy, we know certain ones will have significant impact
[2:21:15.360 --> 2:21:20.360]  and have no negative impact on the Second Amendment.
[2:21:20.360 --> 2:21:22.360]  Second Amendment is not absolute.
[2:21:22.360 --> 2:21:29.360]  When it was passed you couldn't own a, you couldn't own a cannon.
[2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:30.360]  Yeah, you could.
[2:21:30.360 --> 2:21:33.360]  Tim Inlow is a veteran, a patriot, is an American, is a Texan.
[2:21:33.360 --> 2:21:35.360]  What's your response to that?
[2:21:35.360 --> 2:21:37.360]  Yeah, it's absolutely hawk wash.
[2:21:37.360 --> 2:21:40.360]  The Second Amendment makes no restrictions actually.
[2:21:40.360 --> 2:21:45.360]  It just says the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[2:21:45.360 --> 2:21:47.360]  That could be nuclear weapons, but we're not saying.
[2:21:47.360 --> 2:21:48.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:21:48.360 --> 2:21:53.360]  And again, this is every single time there's a shooting in this country,
[2:21:53.360 --> 2:21:57.360]  we see the dishonest politicians come out and use it as an opportunity,
[2:21:57.360 --> 2:22:00.360]  whether it's Beto or Biden or whoever.
[2:22:00.360 --> 2:22:03.360]  And again, what we don't see them do is saying,
[2:22:03.360 --> 2:22:11.360]  hey, give us the after action report from the police and hey police, what made your job harder
[2:22:11.360 --> 2:22:17.360]  when you ran into this incident and what can we do to help you to make sure that in the future
[2:22:17.360 --> 2:22:21.360]  you have an easier time dealing with this kind of situation?
[2:22:21.360 --> 2:22:23.360]  That's what we don't see from the politicians.
[2:22:23.360 --> 2:22:26.360]  They just say it's a problem that can't be fixed till we take all your guns,
[2:22:26.360 --> 2:22:32.360]  but I've got stacks of articles here, new massacres just as big in Mexico where the citizens can't own guns.
[2:22:32.360 --> 2:22:38.360]  Right. And you know, somebody just during the break sent me a slide
[2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:45.360]  and it showed the difference between the shootings where there was an armed good guy present
[2:22:45.360 --> 2:22:51.360]  who acted versus where people called 911 and waited for a police to respond
[2:22:51.360 --> 2:22:58.360]  and in every single one, the difference in the amount of carnage is like unbelievable, right?
[2:22:58.360 --> 2:23:00.360]  How many churches? It was one even in South Texas a few years ago.
[2:23:00.360 --> 2:23:03.360]  That's right. That one is on there. That one is on that slide.
[2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:05.360]  Send it to me. I'll send it to the guys to show it.
[2:23:05.360 --> 2:23:10.360]  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So again, this is what we're dealing with, right,
[2:23:10.360 --> 2:23:13.360]  is that this dishonest discourse by the politicians.
[2:23:13.360 --> 2:23:17.360]  Well, there's also this idea while you're sending that that the world's got to be perfect
[2:23:17.360 --> 2:23:21.360]  with 7.5 billion people when, yeah, there's places where they don't have any gun crime,
[2:23:21.360 --> 2:23:23.360]  but the government kills millions of people every time.
[2:23:23.360 --> 2:23:27.360]  Venezuela, the citizens can't own guns, but the government's murdering millions of people.
[2:23:27.360 --> 2:23:31.360]  It's all on record. Right. So, so, yeah, there was no gun crime in communist China
[2:23:31.360 --> 2:23:33.360]  when Mao killed 100 million people.
[2:23:33.360 --> 2:23:36.360]  Right. So there's like a dozen shootings on this slide, right?
[2:23:36.360 --> 2:23:40.360]  Where someone who was armed, a good guy was armed and present.
[2:23:40.360 --> 2:23:41.360]  Send it to them.
[2:23:41.360 --> 2:23:42.360]  Send it to them.
[2:23:42.360 --> 2:23:46.360]  I just sent it to them and, you know, the most, the most people that were shot
[2:23:46.360 --> 2:23:49.360]  in a situation like this were nine.
[2:23:49.360 --> 2:23:54.360]  Now you go to where there was no person armed, a good guy present armed
[2:23:54.360 --> 2:23:57.360]  and who acted and who caught and they waited to call 911.
[2:23:57.360 --> 2:24:00.360]  And now the biggest number like was a pulse nightclub.
[2:24:00.360 --> 2:24:03.360]  So you're looking at 102 people shot, right?
[2:24:03.360 --> 2:24:05.360]  So nine people versus 102 people.
[2:24:05.360 --> 2:24:07.360]  And that's just one example, right?
[2:24:07.360 --> 2:24:21.360]  Like if you go down the list where they called 911, it's 34 people, 102 people, 34, 22, 47, 70, 28, 31, 46, 43, 46 again.
[2:24:21.360 --> 2:24:26.360]  Right. And on the, on the other side, when there was somebody, a good guy that was armed and acted.
[2:24:26.360 --> 2:24:35.360]  Now the highest number is nine, but then it immediately drops down to four, five, two, one and one.
[2:24:35.360 --> 2:24:38.360]  Right. Like it's just, there's a huge difference there.
[2:24:38.360 --> 2:24:42.360]  So again, this is just dishonest discourse by Biden and them.
[2:24:42.360 --> 2:24:48.360]  We know that good guys with guns have and continue to save lives.
[2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:49.360]  Absolutely.
[2:24:49.360 --> 2:24:52.360]  And this is not an ass-kissing exercise of the police.
[2:24:52.360 --> 2:24:54.360]  When the police do wrong things, we're all over them.
[2:24:54.360 --> 2:24:59.360]  And you see leftist jurisdictions like areas in Canada where they're banning free speech or things in Europe.
[2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:00.360]  We're against that.
[2:25:00.360 --> 2:25:03.360]  But in America, our police, compared to other places, are good.
[2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:06.360]  And there's a battle over who controls them.
[2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:13.360]  And if conservatives abandon the police and don't put it in our input, the left with all their bullying and federalization are going to win.
[2:25:13.360 --> 2:25:17.360]  So that's why we can't just knee-jerk reaction, just go with the left attack on the police.
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:19.360]  No, I agree 100%, right?
[2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:23.360]  And again, what I want to see, you know, they do all these commissions, right?
[2:25:23.360 --> 2:25:24.360]  Like we got the January 6th Commission.
[2:25:24.360 --> 2:25:26.360]  We got all these commissions, right?
[2:25:26.360 --> 2:25:35.360]  But what we don't see is a true looking into of the after-action report of these situations and how to improve.
[2:25:35.360 --> 2:25:37.360]  Law enforcement does it internally.
[2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:44.360]  But on the politicians side to support law enforcement and say, hey, what didn't you have that would have made a difference?
[2:25:44.360 --> 2:25:46.360]  Let us get that for you.
[2:25:46.360 --> 2:25:48.360]  That's what I don't see right now.
[2:25:48.360 --> 2:25:52.360]  But there is a difference because of bureaucracy and command and control.
[2:25:52.360 --> 2:26:02.360]  In the days of the UT Tower shooting, a cop and a janitor went up and killed a guy.
[2:26:02.360 --> 2:26:03.360]  And they didn't wait.
[2:26:03.360 --> 2:26:04.360]  They went up and did it.
[2:26:04.360 --> 2:26:08.360]  And so there is some type of bureaucracy.
[2:26:08.360 --> 2:26:09.360]  But I get it.
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:10.360]  It's a big, giant school.
[2:26:10.360 --> 2:26:13.360]  I mean, I go to big schools sometimes to give a speech.
[2:26:13.360 --> 2:26:15.360]  It takes me 20 minutes to find where I'm at.
[2:26:15.360 --> 2:26:16.360]  You just show up at a school.
[2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:17.360]  You've been there before.
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:18.360]  You've done drills.
[2:26:18.360 --> 2:26:19.360]  You do training there.
[2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:21.360]  But still it's training where the guy is in this hall.
[2:26:21.360 --> 2:26:22.360]  He does that.
[2:26:22.360 --> 2:26:23.360]  But then you don't even know where he's at.
[2:26:23.360 --> 2:26:24.360]  Right.
[2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:26.360]  And like I said, equipment is key.
[2:26:26.360 --> 2:26:28.360]  And that's why I'm a big proponent of...
[2:26:28.360 --> 2:26:30.360]  Tell us about the shield over here.
[2:26:30.360 --> 2:26:31.360]  Right.
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:34.360]  You know, we have a bullet resistant shield there, right?
[2:26:34.360 --> 2:26:36.360]  That stops rifle rounds again.
[2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:39.360]  We, you know, we don't have all the facts yet.
[2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:43.360]  And you do drills and a lot of cops can't even properly use it.
[2:26:43.360 --> 2:26:44.360]  Right.
[2:26:44.360 --> 2:26:45.360]  You don't have them, right?
[2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:47.360]  Or they weren't trained on them.
[2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:50.360]  I did a sheriff's department not too long ago.
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:52.360]  They had two shields in their courthouse.
[2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:56.360]  And when I asked for a show of hands, how many people had actually gone to a shield operator
[2:26:56.360 --> 2:27:00.360]  course, not a single one of them had been to a shield operator course.
[2:27:00.360 --> 2:27:01.360]  Right.
[2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:04.360]  So most of them hadn't even picked it up, hadn't even picked a shield up.
[2:27:04.360 --> 2:27:05.360]  Right.
[2:27:05.360 --> 2:27:06.360]  It was just sitting there.
[2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:08.360]  And so we need good training.
[2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:10.360]  We need proper equipment.
[2:27:10.360 --> 2:27:15.360]  We need more and more drills at these schools to prepare for these kinds of situations.
[2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:16.360]  Just like the Roman army did.
[2:27:16.360 --> 2:27:17.360]  That's why they were so good.
[2:27:17.360 --> 2:27:18.360]  Yeah.
[2:27:18.360 --> 2:27:19.360]  It has to be never ending.
[2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:21.360]  Because again, the bad guys always change their tactics.
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:26.360]  They learn from watching the previous bad guy, and then they try to add on whatever he
[2:27:26.360 --> 2:27:28.360]  did, and they try to sit there.
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:29.360]  And we continue to see that.
[2:27:29.360 --> 2:27:33.360]  So law enforcement has to keep up as well.
[2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:35.360]  Let's show some of these images from the New York Post.
[2:27:35.360 --> 2:27:37.360]  Well, again, the issue isn't guns.
[2:27:37.360 --> 2:27:40.360]  It's not the police not being perfect, though we can improve them.
[2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:41.360]  And we will.
[2:27:41.360 --> 2:27:43.360]  We're going to look at the surveillance footage.
[2:27:43.360 --> 2:27:44.360]  I can't wait.
[2:27:44.360 --> 2:27:45.360]  I mean, I want to see it.
[2:27:45.360 --> 2:27:47.360]  But we need to learn what actually happened with surveillance footage.
[2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:50.360]  But the state police, as you said on Monday, put out a statement that's now basically
[2:27:50.360 --> 2:27:53.360]  being confirmed to be pretty much accurate.
[2:27:53.360 --> 2:27:56.360]  And so the answer is don't be a target, folks.
[2:27:56.360 --> 2:27:57.360]  Don't be weak.
[2:27:57.360 --> 2:27:58.360]  Get a concealed carry.
[2:27:58.360 --> 2:28:00.360]  Learn how to use a firearm.
[2:28:00.360 --> 2:28:04.360]  And just understand that big public schools are the target.
[2:28:04.360 --> 2:28:07.360]  So many public schools have good people running them.
[2:28:07.360 --> 2:28:08.360]  A lot of them have leftists running them.
[2:28:08.360 --> 2:28:13.360]  I think, for me, the answer is, if you can afford it, get your children out of big schools.
[2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:14.360]  Yeah.
[2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:17.360]  I mean, again, it seems like funding is always an issue, right?
[2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:18.360]  They don't want to fund.
[2:28:18.360 --> 2:28:20.360]  But there's ways around that, right?
[2:28:20.360 --> 2:28:23.360]  Like, for example, and people will volunteer to be part of it.
[2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:24.360]  That's exactly right.
[2:28:24.360 --> 2:28:28.360]  And you have, you have reserve police officers, reserve deputies, reserve
[2:28:28.360 --> 2:28:31.360]  That's exactly they're not even being paid.
[2:28:31.360 --> 2:28:33.360]  They volunteered their time to go in.
[2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:37.360]  And they would love to sit there and make a difference out of school if you give them
[2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:38.360]  the opportunity to.
[2:28:38.360 --> 2:28:39.360]  All right.
[2:28:39.360 --> 2:28:41.360]  Tim Enlow, thank you as the days unfold.
[2:28:41.360 --> 2:28:42.360]  Give us more intel.
[2:28:42.360 --> 2:28:47.360]  Intel, because I have a bad feeling we're going to see more of this with 166 days out from
[2:28:47.360 --> 2:28:48.360]  the election.
[2:28:48.360 --> 2:28:49.360]  It's just like clockwork.
[2:28:49.360 --> 2:28:50.360]  It starts happening.
[2:28:50.360 --> 2:28:51.360]  Who knows why it's happening?
[2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:52.360]  We're going to try to figure it out.
[2:28:52.360 --> 2:28:55.360]  I got a bunch of news, other issues ahead.
[2:28:55.360 --> 2:28:57.360]  The latest on the Davos meeting.
[2:28:57.360 --> 2:29:02.360]  Here at Info Wars, our slogan is tomorrow's news today, whether it's politics or health.
[2:29:02.360 --> 2:29:03.360]  Or spirituality.
[2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:10.360]  Weird about bringing you the very best documented, accurate real world information.
[2:29:10.360 --> 2:29:14.360]  And when it comes to our supplements, they are so game changing for your body, for your

[2:29:28.360 --> 2:29:34.360]  Most other iodine out there is bound to other minerals and compounds so you don't absorb
[2:29:34.360 --> 2:29:36.360]  it at all or fully.
[2:29:36.360 --> 2:29:40.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a limited supply and it's been sold out for months because
[2:29:40.360 --> 2:29:41.360]  the supply chain right now is.

[2:29:46.360 --> 2:29:47.360]  price.
[2:29:47.360 --> 2:29:50.360]  Within two weeks, the current sales rate is going to sell out.

[2:30:48.360 --> 2:30:50.360]  natural defenses and keep InfoWars on the air.

[2:31:56.360 --> 2:32:03.360]  It has been noted by many a historian that the first casualty of war is the truth.
[2:32:03.360 --> 2:32:07.360]  And the next big casualty isn't even the people that die.
[2:32:07.360 --> 2:32:09.360]  No, that invariably follows.
[2:32:09.360 --> 2:32:18.360]  But first, there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty, and speech, and massive censorship.
[2:32:18.360 --> 2:32:24.360]  And now, across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[2:32:24.360 --> 2:32:33.360]  that if you amplify any, quote, pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can be
[2:32:33.360 --> 2:32:35.360]  arrested, you can be imprisoned.
[2:32:35.360 --> 2:32:41.360]  And of course, now Canada is under this legislation that if you have a thought crime and they
[2:32:41.360 --> 2:32:47.360]  think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored
[2:32:47.360 --> 2:32:48.360]  and arrested.
[2:32:48.360 --> 2:32:52.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around
[2:32:52.360 --> 2:33:09.360]  the world against humanity that makes infowars.com more important than ever.
[2:33:09.360 --> 2:33:23.360]  You know, it's funny, it's like, I find it really interesting that people think that spreading
[2:33:23.360 --> 2:33:32.360]  and discussing realities and how we heal from our country's wounds and spreading hate, when
[2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:38.360]  really what it is, is like they don't want to be reminded of the hate that exists.
[2:33:38.360 --> 2:33:44.360]  And if we aren't willing to confront it, it's just going to keep growing.
[2:33:44.360 --> 2:33:50.360]  Talking about it is not feeding it, it's not inciting it.
[2:33:50.360 --> 2:33:53.360]  White supremacy is a fact.
[2:33:53.360 --> 2:33:55.360]  It's not just a fact.
[2:33:55.360 --> 2:34:06.360]  You look at FBI statistics, which underreport hate crimes, police statistics, even all the
[2:34:06.360 --> 2:34:16.360]  institutions that underreport hate crimes still has white supremacist groups as by far, by
[2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:23.360]  far, the leading driver of domestic terrorism in the United States.
[2:34:23.360 --> 2:34:28.360]  And that's with all the generosity that they get from underreporting.
[2:34:28.360 --> 2:34:29.360]  It's not even close.
[2:34:29.360 --> 2:34:33.360]  It's like the bar of white supremacist violence is like this, and then it's like all the other
[2:34:33.360 --> 2:34:34.360]  categories are like that.
[2:34:34.360 --> 2:34:36.360]  Really, show us this graph.
[2:34:36.360 --> 2:34:40.360]  And so it's not inciting anything to talk about that.
[2:34:40.360 --> 2:34:42.360]  There's no what ifs here.
[2:34:42.360 --> 2:34:45.360]  There's no like what about Antifa here.
[2:34:45.360 --> 2:34:49.360]  Like look at the numbers.
[2:34:49.360 --> 2:34:50.360]  So she can lie her ass off.
[2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:55.360]  Except all of us, except responsibility for the reality.
[2:34:55.360 --> 2:34:56.360]  All right, shut it down.
[2:34:56.360 --> 2:34:57.360]  I can't.
[2:34:57.360 --> 2:34:58.360]  Let's do it anymore.
[2:34:58.360 --> 2:35:02.360]  So this is all over the news that white supremacism is an epidemic.
[2:35:02.360 --> 2:35:06.360]  It's everywhere, some horrible person they claim is a white supremacist killed 10 black
[2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:07.360]  people a few weeks ago.
[2:35:07.360 --> 2:35:09.360]  There's seven and a half billion people on the earth.
[2:35:09.360 --> 2:35:12.360]  They're starving tens of millions of deaths with all the lockdowns.
[2:35:12.360 --> 2:35:16.360]  And they've got the nerve to sit there now with any terrorism bills using the shooting
[2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:20.360]  in Uvalde saying we need to go after the white people.
[2:35:20.360 --> 2:35:25.360]  They're terrorists when white people have one of the lowest crime rates out there.
[2:35:25.360 --> 2:35:26.360]  It's unbelievable.
[2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:31.360]  All right, I want to hit a bunch of other news to get to some key clips here ahead of the
[2:35:31.360 --> 2:35:34.360]  guest host has taken over the fourth hour.
[2:35:34.360 --> 2:35:37.360]  I just want to say this.
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:41.360]  They have to totally silence us to be able to get away with their gaslighting.
[2:35:41.360 --> 2:35:48.360]  They have to not let the people communicate so they can sell absolute total bull like
[2:35:48.360 --> 2:35:49.360]  you just heard.
[2:35:49.360 --> 2:35:50.360]  So I don't care what color you are.
[2:35:50.360 --> 2:35:52.360]  If you got red blood, you love God.
[2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:53.360]  I love you.
[2:35:53.360 --> 2:35:58.360]  We're together in this fight on this planet for the future of our children.
[2:35:58.360 --> 2:36:03.360]  And they have done everything and there's George Soros, New World Order power to silence
[2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:04.360]  us.
[2:36:04.360 --> 2:36:08.360]  But because of you, we are still on air and I salute you for that.
[2:36:08.360 --> 2:36:11.360]  So we have this big Memorial Day special going that's huge.
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:14.360]  It was 60% off, double Patriot points.
[2:36:14.360 --> 2:36:19.360]  But we also have something very, very special that I want you to be part of because it's
[2:36:19.360 --> 2:36:20.360]  historic.
[2:36:20.360 --> 2:36:21.360]  And you're the founding members.
[2:36:21.360 --> 2:36:25.360]  And if we're able to stay on air in the next six months and what we're doing, we're going
[2:36:25.360 --> 2:36:33.280]  to have a lot of special exclusive films and media and discounts and so much more for people
[2:36:33.280 --> 2:36:35.120]  that help us be founding members.
[2:36:35.120 --> 2:36:38.680]  The third coin, we're going to play the clip for you in a moment.
[2:36:38.680 --> 2:36:45.700]  The third coin is now here and will be gone in six, seven, eight, nine days, guaranteed.
[2:36:45.700 --> 2:36:49.040]  And these coins are selling for three, four times many of them for what people bought
[2:36:49.040 --> 2:36:50.040]  them for.
[2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:53.560]  It's got to mark up the fund, building new things, keeping us on air and doing very,
[2:36:53.560 --> 2:36:54.560]  very exciting things.
[2:36:54.560 --> 2:37:00.040]  So the come and take it coin is a second amendment coin that we designed more than six months
[2:37:00.040 --> 2:37:08.520]  ago that was minted in the United States a month ago that was delivered on Monday.
[2:37:08.520 --> 2:37:09.880]  We have 10,000.
[2:37:09.880 --> 2:37:11.000]  It's one run.

[2:37:28.920 --> 2:37:34.160]  with the come and take it when Santa Ana came to take the guys right close to the Uvaldi
[2:37:34.160 --> 2:37:35.920]  and they said no.
[2:37:35.920 --> 2:37:41.920]  It says free men bear arms on the tail side with the Texas cannon and the Gadsden snake
[2:37:41.920 --> 2:37:47.720]  coiled around it protecting it on the head side we have the Spartan from 300 the real
[2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:53.400]  historical thing that happened and the words come and take it.

[2:38:34.280 --> 2:38:37.960]  when Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin went to France at the beginning of the Revolutionary
[2:38:37.960 --> 2:38:44.680]  War and they took shiploads of printed little American flags that they sold for 20 or 100
[2:38:44.680 --> 2:38:48.320]  times they were worth the French buying this is only worth three four you know it's only

[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:48.880]  out and just count down and till that judgment day but everybody knows you live and you learn
[2:47:48.880 --> 2:47:55.520]  but the lessons just go on and on and on yes i do
[2:47:57.520 --> 2:48:07.520]  guess i'm gonna have to wait for all the pages to find out if it's right or if it's wrong
[2:48:07.520 --> 2:48:20.480]  oh you live you learn you let me learn all right i meant to get the calls today we got a special guest
[2:48:20.480 --> 2:48:29.360]  in for over an hour we got another special guest coming up next hour i got a lot of news to cover
[2:48:29.360 --> 2:48:36.640]  in the meantime k diers set to take over always covers the key documents stuff that globalists
[2:48:36.640 --> 2:48:46.880]  don't want you to know but uh here's the bottom line newtonian physics show us and the unified
[2:48:46.880 --> 2:48:54.480]  field theory of max plank codified by albert einstein shows us but we don't need to see it
[2:48:54.480 --> 2:49:00.000]  the numbers we know it in life that for every action there's an opposite reaction an equal reaction
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:08.320]  and so the new world order needs to know that and they know that
[2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:14.320]  the harder they hit us the stronger we get if we don't give up and that's what happened

[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:10.640]  some really drastic action here and don't tell me we can't have an impact on this carnage
[3:01:10.640 --> 3:01:16.480]  who will say on this network or any other network in the next few days it's time to repeal the

[3:01:23.680 --> 3:01:33.360]  carnage why do we keep letting this happen where in god's name is our backbone but i'm here on this
[3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:42.640]  floor to beg to literally get down on my hands and knees and beg my colleagues if i could have gotten
[3:01:43.200 --> 3:01:50.880]  51 votes in the senate of the united states for an outright ban picking up every one of them
[3:01:50.880 --> 3:02:00.320]  um mr and mrs america turn them all in i would have done it we have to have the courage to take
[3:02:00.320 --> 3:02:08.080]  action we have introduced an assault weapons brand i'm talking about a ban on assault rifle
[3:02:08.960 --> 3:02:16.880]  and understand the nexus between what makes for reasonable and sensible public policy
[3:02:16.880 --> 3:02:29.120]  find a path forward here work with us to find a way to pass laws that make this less likely
[3:02:29.120 --> 3:02:35.120]  look i support all gun control legislation not sensible gun control we don't need the sensible
[3:02:35.120 --> 3:02:40.640]  stuff we need the hardcore stuff that's going to protect ourselves and our children if you
[3:02:40.640 --> 3:02:46.400]  want a solution stop selling ar-15s in the state of test you want a solution gentleman just walked up to me
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:51.840]  in his picture line he says hi have an ar-15 and i will turn this in if it means saving the lives
[3:02:51.840 --> 3:02:57.680]  of our kids hell yes we're gonna take your ar-15 your ak-47 we're not gonna allow it to be used
[3:02:57.680 --> 3:03:05.760]  against a fellow americans anymore it'll happen again next week there is no way to stop next week's
[3:03:05.760 --> 3:03:11.680]  mass murder now is the time to stop the next shooting it's time for those who obstruct or
[3:03:11.680 --> 3:03:18.000]  delay or block the common-sense gun laws we need to let you know that we will not forget
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:24.960]  i do have thoughts and prayers and those thoughts and prayers are to remove as many republicans
[3:03:24.960 --> 3:03:31.200]  as as many people who support this evil policy this coming november i'm tired of hearing people
[3:03:31.200 --> 3:03:36.720]  all they have to offer is thoughts and prayers it's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a
[3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:41.440]  monday and then only do it every monday we need to do this every day of the week and just really
[3:03:41.440 --> 3:03:46.720]  brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way but the reason we have a problem
[3:03:46.720 --> 3:03:52.400]  right now is we've let the the corporate gun lobby frame this debate it is time that we have both
[3:03:52.400 --> 3:03:57.280]  actions and a bold agenda over 90 percent of the american people think we have to get assault
[3:03:57.280 --> 3:04:02.720]  weapons off the street period and we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements everyone
[3:04:02.720 --> 3:04:10.240]  up here favors an assault weapon ban everyone up here favors magazine limitations which by the way
[3:04:10.240 --> 3:04:15.040]  would have made a huge difference we can ban the weapons of war it's about ending the sales of
[3:04:15.040 --> 3:04:19.920]  assault weapons into our communities those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively
[3:04:19.920 --> 3:04:24.400]  and as efficiently as possible they should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities
[3:04:24.400 --> 3:04:29.200]  but i also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that ak-47s belong in the hands of soldiers
[3:04:29.200 --> 3:04:36.640]  not in the hands of criminals by the way you can't own the following weapons period they cannot be
[3:04:36.640 --> 3:04:41.440]  sold anymore like if you're going to take people's guns away wait till you get elected then take the
[3:04:41.440 --> 3:04:47.040]  guns away don't tell them ahead of time which by the way that's what that's what people like me
[3:04:47.040 --> 3:04:56.400]  think you're gonna do
[3:04:58.400 --> 3:05:04.240]  info wars has made history you have made history in your support of info wars and one of the biggest
[3:05:04.240 --> 3:05:10.560]  tools we've had to circumvent and override the sensors has been patriot apparel so we can identify

[3:10:53.440 --> 3:10:59.440]  sir absolutely thank you alec's glad to be here it's always an honor to host the fourth hour
[3:10:59.440 --> 3:11:05.120]  today i'm going to talk about the uh issue well's book that we've not yet covered we've covered
[3:11:05.120 --> 3:11:10.800]  several books from birch and rossel hg wells himself in terms of the new world order but there's
[3:11:10.800 --> 3:11:15.920]  another book that he wrote that is just as important and it's called the open conspiracy this book is
[3:11:16.720 --> 3:11:21.440]  aptly titled because it tells you exactly what's going on it's sort of an eyes wide shut type of
[3:11:21.440 --> 3:11:26.000]  title that says well we're just going to do this conspiracy out in the open and it'll be like a
[3:11:26.640 --> 3:11:31.200]  gas lighting psi op and nobody will care or figure it out because we'll put it out there in the open
[3:11:31.200 --> 3:11:37.920]  that way it won't be a conspiracy now he wrote this book in 1928 and the subtitle of the book is
[3:11:37.920 --> 3:11:45.120]  blueprints for world revolution so keep in mind that this is co-opting the idea of the liberal
[3:11:45.120 --> 3:11:51.280]  revolutionary tradition into the technocratic world order we know that hg wells was a crucial
[3:11:51.280 --> 3:11:55.680]  key propagandist connected to the fabian society connected to the royal society he kind of played
[3:11:55.680 --> 3:12:02.240]  that liberal side of the elite power structure in the british empire as opposed to the more so
[3:12:02.240 --> 3:12:10.160]  called right wing side really they were both wings of the same bird and he begins his book by saying
[3:12:10.160 --> 3:12:17.120]  that we are expecting chaos and flux in the coming years so this is remember written prior to world
[3:12:17.120 --> 3:12:22.640]  war two he also wrote a book shape of things to come written prior to world war two which pretty
[3:12:22.640 --> 3:12:27.360]  much predicts all the elements of world war two he was off by a few years i think because he actually
[3:12:27.360 --> 3:12:32.640]  gave a year when he thought the world the world wars would happen and he says that what we're
[3:12:32.640 --> 3:12:37.200]  going to expect in the next coming years is chaos and disaster he was definitely right about that
[3:12:37.200 --> 3:12:42.800]  because he was he was working with the people who essentially planned the two world wars of the 20th
[3:12:42.800 --> 3:12:47.280]  century that is the power elite of the british empire the angle american established by the
[3:12:47.280 --> 3:12:52.640]  atlantis this power block he begins his book by saying that we know from evolutionary theory that
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:12:58.080]  all that exists is matter and flux pure materialism pure flux again keep in mind what do we do we just
[3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:03.680]  see the world economic forum luminaries say you are all matter in motion you have no soul you have
[3:13:03.680 --> 3:13:10.000]  no free will we're going to stamp all of that out again 100 in line with the game plan of the
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:17.920]  technocrats 100 years ago no different so basically we're almost 100 years anniversary of this infamous
[3:13:17.920 --> 3:13:24.240]  book the open conspiracy and it begins by saying after that with in terms of the discussion of
[3:13:24.240 --> 3:13:29.440]  materialism he says that population growth is just going nuts that's going to be the main problem
[3:13:29.440 --> 3:13:35.120]  of the future and he says that we're going to analyze the power of capitalism monopoly capitalism
[3:13:35.120 --> 3:13:40.640]  he's talking about not classic free market capitalism but the dynastic control of the
[3:13:40.640 --> 3:13:46.000]  banking and industrial elite monopoly capitalism he says that we're going to have to realize that
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  the power structure that is the monopoly capitalist will have to act to stop a couple big
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:58.080]  problems in the world what are the two things the two sort of firewalls identified by hg wells that
[3:13:58.080 --> 3:14:04.720]  have to be gotten rid of to destroy population growth well he's very candid about it he says that
[3:14:04.720 --> 3:14:09.120]  the family number one got to get rid of nuclear families got to get rid of extended families
[3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:15.040]  number two nation states he says patriotism is the first thing that has to die you can't have
[3:14:15.040 --> 3:14:21.520]  people defending their history their tradition their heritage their family that's got to go away
[3:14:21.520 --> 3:14:27.280]  for a technocratic one world order to come into place he says that will use slogans like change
[3:14:27.280 --> 3:14:34.080]  and progress to promote and advance the idea that the family and the nation state are inherently
[3:14:34.080 --> 3:14:39.920]  bad inherently evil they are retrograde they are for rubes they are for rednecks that's for idiots
[3:14:40.640 --> 3:14:46.240]  only people who are sophisticated city dwellers these kinds of people right we all know that city
[3:14:46.240 --> 3:14:52.240]  dwelling cosmopolitan rootless consumerism is the only way to be progressive the only way to be
[3:14:52.880 --> 3:15:00.640]  forward thinking he says that when we inculcate this he says that will be the true revolutionary
[3:15:00.640 --> 3:15:06.880]  idea by which we will go under the cloak of liberalism leftism progressivism
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:17.520]  this opening at spears he says is a great he says will bring great chaos and and and flux
[3:15:17.520 --> 3:15:22.080]  in terms of these world wars in terms of the coming years and he says but out of the ashes
[3:15:22.080 --> 3:15:27.760]  of the chaos will be born this new order again what was the title of his other book very similar
[3:15:27.760 --> 3:15:33.440]  to this one the new world order he says that out of the cold war he even talks about the
[3:15:33.440 --> 3:15:41.600]  post-soviet state emerging as a utopian era that will be modeled on a capitalist communist
[3:15:41.600 --> 3:15:46.320]  synthesis he even says the soviet state's a great idea we love it it's bolshevik it's
[3:15:46.320 --> 3:15:50.640]  in the model for the world order don't go anywhere this is j direb j's analysis you're
[3:15:50.640 --> 3:15:59.200]  watching the alex joneshow don't leave the globalist are bombarding us with propaganda
[3:15:59.200 --> 3:16:04.480]  and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out
[3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:09.600]  and they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator
[3:16:09.600 --> 3:16:16.640]  and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous
[3:16:16.640 --> 3:16:24.400]  internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not
[3:16:24.400 --> 3:16:30.960]  be necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies and
[3:16:30.960 --> 3:16:38.160]  all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end
[3:16:38.160 --> 3:16:43.040]  they signed on the god of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody
[3:16:43.040 --> 3:16:46.800]  keep them full wars in the air now more than ever because even you don't believe in god
[3:16:47.360 --> 3:16:52.640]  both the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe and we are opposing the one world

[3:19:57.200 --> 3:20:03.200]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:20:03.200 --> 3:20:14.800]  welcome back to the oxygen so i'm your guest host j dire of j's analysis we were covering
[3:20:14.800 --> 3:20:21.840]  h.c weles's book the open conspiracy and his blueprint of revolution for global government
[3:20:22.400 --> 3:20:27.680]  and he had said that he loved the five-year plan of stalling and the implementation of
[3:20:27.680 --> 3:20:34.240]  phases of these scientific techniques and processes for toppling and restructuring government
[3:20:34.240 --> 3:20:39.840]  into a solidified unified world state then he moves on to say that we have to understand
[3:20:39.840 --> 3:20:46.480]  where we've come from how how we got here and he says that the advancements of the scientific
[3:20:46.480 --> 3:20:51.760]  revolution and the enlightenment gave us darwinism and other such philosophies which allow us to
[3:20:51.760 --> 3:20:58.800]  uh reform everything that we think about man man's relationship to other men the state society
[3:20:58.800 --> 3:21:05.360]  education history philosophy all of these things in religion importantly he says have to be
[3:21:05.360 --> 3:21:10.800]  rethink we have to revise we have to revolutionize every area of life there's nothing that can stay
[3:21:11.440 --> 3:21:17.200]  permanent and the same or anything that we can pass on because you see everything is in flux
[3:21:17.200 --> 3:21:24.160]  this is a consistent refrain from other revolutionaries like mal like lenin trotsky many of them talked
[3:21:24.160 --> 3:21:30.400]  about perpetual revolution the revolution never ends it's always ongoing because for them pure
[3:21:30.400 --> 3:21:36.240]  matter is all that exists just material physical existence that's all there is and it's always
[3:21:36.240 --> 3:21:43.040]  in flux because we're just atoms in motion molecules in motion and thus to harness that
[3:21:43.040 --> 3:21:49.600]  process it's to steer history in a dialectical fashion towards the synthesis of the unification
[3:21:49.600 --> 3:21:55.840]  of all areas of life and all areas of thought he says that our first enemy that we have to think
[3:21:55.840 --> 3:22:02.320]  about and after we have these great world wars he says what he says will come he says that world
[3:22:02.320 --> 3:22:07.280]  war one happened and that moved us towards a global government he says but we're going to need more
[3:22:07.280 --> 3:22:14.320]  giant world wars to really grasp the need for a centralized global authority to prevent the world
[3:22:14.320 --> 3:22:20.480]  wars you see you see the logic of this we will inculcate chaos and then give the solution problem
[3:22:20.480 --> 3:22:25.600]  reaction solution admitting essentially that they're the ones that engineered those wars
[3:22:25.600 --> 3:22:30.560]  dr carol quickly in his famous book tragedy and hope says the exact same thing this power
[3:22:30.560 --> 3:22:36.000]  structure that we're talking about right here engineered those world wars to bring about a
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:42.080]  long-term goal of a global managerial technocratic government he says that there are things that
[3:22:42.080 --> 3:22:46.800]  we have to eliminate one of the things that has to be eliminated as we said with the family and
[3:22:46.800 --> 3:22:53.040]  the nation state is the notion of conservatism any idea of conservatism he says is problematic
[3:22:53.040 --> 3:22:57.680]  because it gives the impression that there are truths that can be passed on handed down from
[3:22:57.680 --> 3:23:05.360]  one generation to the next that we don't need to scrap all of history is something hg well says
[3:23:05.360 --> 3:23:11.360]  has to be gotten away with no we do need to scrap history well says history cannot give us truths
[3:23:11.360 --> 3:23:17.440]  that we pass on because everything is matter in motion everything is perpetual flux that is
[3:23:17.440 --> 3:23:23.840]  the metaphysical doctrine of the revolutionary faith you have to understand that revolutionary
[3:23:23.840 --> 3:23:30.320]  philosophy is predicated on a kind of magical sort of mystical view that matter is in motion at all
[3:23:30.320 --> 3:23:36.960]  times there's nothing permanent nothing true nothing's true everything is relative everything
[3:23:36.960 --> 3:23:45.440]  is in motion everything is evolving he says that we got a target first and foremost the education
[3:23:45.440 --> 3:23:51.120]  education has to be completely revamped and to do this we have to get rid of anything again that
[3:23:51.120 --> 3:23:56.880]  relates to history and tradition that's all bad it's all gone inherently religions he says have
[3:23:56.880 --> 3:24:02.720]  to be taken over and they have to evolve to reflect the attitude of the new world order of
[3:24:02.720 --> 3:24:08.800]  the technocratic scientific elite he says that we will have to seek some kind of amorphous generic
[3:24:08.800 --> 3:24:15.360]  universal cause that we can that we can say is kind of a unknown god behind all the world religions
[3:24:16.080 --> 3:24:19.280]  but he says that all the establishment religions must become
[3:24:19.280 --> 3:24:27.600]  means and methods of promoting a social gospel so here you have all the way back in 1928 hd wells
[3:24:28.400 --> 3:24:35.600]  in the fifth chapter way ahead of anybody else promoting the idea of liberation theology the
[3:24:35.600 --> 3:24:40.400]  idea of a social gospel nothing to do with anything biblical or any of that it's all
[3:24:40.400 --> 3:24:46.400]  about fitting the religion into the overall geopolitical strategy of a one world order
[3:24:46.400 --> 3:24:53.920]  he says that the sacrifice of the individual in religion will be nothing to do with giving your
[3:24:53.920 --> 3:25:00.320]  life to god jesus or anything like that he says it will be turned into sacrifice for the world
[3:25:00.320 --> 3:25:06.960]  socialist order so religion will still exist you will still be asked to give up your life
[3:25:06.960 --> 3:25:13.200]  bear your cross daily but for the socialist world government you see now keep in mind
[3:25:13.200 --> 3:25:19.040]  yes he was a marxist socialist but he's not the typical marxist socialist who thinks that
[3:25:19.760 --> 3:25:23.600]  you've got to destroy the capitalist and you got to destroy everything relating
[3:25:23.600 --> 3:25:27.600]  relating to the means of production and the proletariat has to take over he didn't have
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:32.800]  that attitude he was a much more sophisticated marxist socialist in fact he would make fun of
[3:25:32.800 --> 3:25:37.200]  the other marxist socialist and say that don't you guys understand that it's the monopoly
[3:25:37.200 --> 3:25:43.840]  capitalists that are going to build the infrastructure that we will take over to enforce the global
[3:25:43.840 --> 3:25:50.720]  socialist corporate order he says that there's a lot of steps that we're going to have to take
[3:25:50.720 --> 3:25:56.800]  to get to this end goal he says that we're going to have to realize that there is no afterlife
[3:25:56.800 --> 3:26:02.000]  none of that matters all we have to do is focus on building a technocratic utopia in this world
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:08.880]  he says that we're going to have to understand the principles of shutting down growth and austerity
[3:26:09.840 --> 3:26:13.440]  and he says that religions can be a tool for this right you can promote through religions
[3:26:13.440 --> 3:26:19.280]  fake religions made up cults and religions the example being the climate scam oh it's
[3:26:19.280 --> 3:26:23.680]  you're bad because you have property you're bad because you drive a car you're evil because you're
[3:26:24.240 --> 3:26:28.080]  you know taking up too much carbon when that's the basis of life on the planet
[3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:34.640]  and basically h.g. Wells way ahead of the club of Rome is preferring promoting this scam back in
[3:26:34.640 --> 3:26:41.360]  1928 says we'll just convince everybody that they're guilty for using up too much carbon
[3:26:42.160 --> 3:26:45.200]  they're for putting out excuse me putting out too much carbon using up too much oxygen too
[3:26:45.200 --> 3:26:51.440]  many resources he says that this will be achieved if we can get full spectrum dominance when we
[3:26:51.440 --> 3:26:57.760]  obtain full spectrum dominance he says the phoenix from the ashes will emerge as what he calls
[3:26:57.760 --> 3:27:04.560]  the quote new world order he says that a lot of things though well you will have to die
[3:27:04.560 --> 3:27:11.600]  on the way it's unfortunate but things like countless millions of people or perhaps even
[3:27:11.600 --> 3:27:16.640]  billions he says we'll have to die but it's not a big deal because unfortunately the world is far
[3:27:16.640 --> 3:27:23.760]  overpopulated he says and the global conflicts and wars that are coming he says will be a hopefully
[3:27:23.760 --> 3:27:29.680]  he says a great contributor to mass depopulation efforts so he says but it's not that they're
[3:27:29.680 --> 3:27:35.040]  dying in vain they're actually all dying for a good end namely the erection of the global
[3:27:35.040 --> 3:27:40.640]  technocratic state whittling the population down to at least hopefully he's he thinks like others
[3:27:40.640 --> 3:27:54.240]  80 90% he says that maybe maybe we can continue with religion but he says really the key thing
[3:27:54.240 --> 3:28:01.840]  will be to convert whatever religions exist into a front for uh scientism right so the
[3:28:01.840 --> 3:28:07.440]  cult that really runs the religion of the world or the many face face cut out faces that that
[3:28:07.440 --> 3:28:14.000]  they're behind he says those are all going to be um concerned with population control so the number
[3:28:14.000 --> 3:28:19.920]  one goal of the fake religion that will be erected of the scientism cult will be to call the population
[3:28:19.920 --> 3:28:24.560]  that's it that's all the religion exists to do is to promote the world government promote people
[3:28:24.560 --> 3:28:30.000]  giving up their life and their their future and basically accepting sterility and or euthanasia
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:38.000]  for the global cult or technic for the technocracy but notice that he does say it's a cult he says
[3:28:38.000 --> 3:28:42.880]  that our inner core the inner elite the inner party that Orwell talked about they won't actually
[3:28:42.880 --> 3:28:47.760]  believe this or be subject to it there will be an outer fake religion that they will have
[3:28:47.760 --> 3:28:54.080]  that they will promote to the masses convincing them to accept austerity giving up private
[3:28:54.080 --> 3:28:58.480]  property and so i want to thank all of you over the years who have supported info or

[3:33:10.240 --> 3:33:14.960]  welcome back to the oxygen show i'm your guest host j dire did notice we are working our way
[3:33:14.960 --> 3:33:21.200]  through the very important admissions from the elite taxed by hg wells the open conspiracy what
[3:33:21.200 --> 3:33:26.480]  are we to do with our lives well you may not know what to do with your life maybe you're looking for
[3:33:26.480 --> 3:33:32.560]  a purpose driven life hg wells has a purpose for you and in fact his purpose is you can just die
[3:33:32.560 --> 3:33:37.760]  for the new world order just lay down euthanize yourself sterilize yourself at the least
[3:33:39.280 --> 3:33:47.360]  and maybe you'll have a cause to die for now in this very important chapter about scientific
[3:33:47.360 --> 3:33:52.400]  world commonwealth that he's talking about erecting that's the chapter is about the scientific world
[3:33:52.400 --> 3:33:57.680]  government he says first thing we're gonna have to do is uh we're gonna have to curtail breeding
[3:33:57.680 --> 3:34:03.760]  okay we're gonna have to have total control of who breeds when they breed how much they breed
[3:34:04.720 --> 3:34:09.840]  everything about breeding is controlled he says that we will even control all of the pleasure
[3:34:09.840 --> 3:34:16.480]  impulses to the extent that in the future basically nobody will be able to have kids that's more or
[3:34:16.480 --> 3:34:22.320]  less what he goes with and he says that uh all you idiot marxists out there you ideological
[3:34:22.320 --> 3:34:26.800]  driven marxists he says that you guys don't even understand that it's really the monopoly
[3:34:26.800 --> 3:34:35.760]  capitalists that are going to lead the way to erect the erect the piety that will make everybody a
[3:34:35.760 --> 3:34:41.920]  consumable or dispensable unit the quantification principle he says so just let the monopoly
[3:34:41.920 --> 3:34:48.720]  capitalists erect the global government he says and then all we have to do is take it over when
[3:34:48.720 --> 3:34:57.120]  they build it he says this will ultimately be the means of population control he seems to also
[3:34:57.120 --> 3:35:04.240]  have a foresight into predicting what we might call um smart cities right he says that we'll have
[3:35:04.240 --> 3:35:10.480]  these kinds of corporate cities in the future there'll be you know ai runs space cities he says
[3:35:10.480 --> 3:35:17.200]  that we'll have a central world economy it will be completely and totally centrally planned so
[3:35:17.200 --> 3:35:22.160]  anything that you ever heard about uh the problems of central planning no hc wells
[3:35:22.160 --> 3:35:25.920]  doesn't believe that at all right any of the critiques that you hear about the federal reserve
[3:35:25.920 --> 3:35:31.200]  no no all of that needs to be all the more enforced according to wells we need a complete
[3:35:31.200 --> 3:35:37.760]  tracking tracing credit based system he basically anticipates a kind of social credit system 100
[3:35:37.760 --> 3:35:43.760]  years ago 100 years ago he then goes on to say that this will be a managerial technocratic society
[3:35:43.760 --> 3:35:50.240]  remember last week's discussion when we were talking about the miles copeland cia operative history
[3:35:51.200 --> 3:35:56.240]  his whole account of what he was up to in first syria and in egypt and all his dealings with
[3:35:56.240 --> 3:36:08.240]  nasser and what he was trying to put in place there uh in egypt if you remember that that was intended
[3:36:08.240 --> 3:36:17.360]  to erect an industrialized egypt that would one day reduce drastically his population
[3:36:17.360 --> 3:36:21.680]  and he said ultimately this was with the uh was concerned with the goal of putting in place
[3:36:21.680 --> 3:36:27.360]  a managerial society and if you remember miles copeland said if you want to understand what we're
[3:36:27.360 --> 3:36:34.240]  up to in these countries he says go read who cfr birch and russell and james bernum the managerial
[3:36:34.240 --> 3:36:40.160]  society well what do you know exact same thing here so do you understand for all the people that
[3:36:40.160 --> 3:36:46.720]  are skeptical for people that don't think this is real they laugh at this it's so funny even though
[3:36:46.720 --> 3:36:51.360]  it's all literally rolling out every day there's a new development every day the world economic form
[3:36:51.360 --> 3:36:56.960]  which is meeting right now which just said all of this again the last two or three days by the way
[3:36:56.960 --> 3:37:02.080]  i just did a whole talk about this just covering these clips over on my rockfin channel go to my
[3:37:02.080 --> 3:37:07.120]  youtube channel i've been covering for the last several years the davos uh world economic form
[3:37:07.120 --> 3:37:11.680]  so if i got to dug up one of my old videos from five years ago covering world economic form in
[3:37:11.680 --> 3:37:16.000]  davos and their speeches back then and what they were planning i was talking five years ago specifically
[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:20.880]  saying the world economic form will roll this kind of stuff out and we need to pay attention to them
[3:37:20.880 --> 3:37:27.280]  i just posted that video go watch it as you all says that conservatism and conservative movements
[3:37:27.280 --> 3:37:30.800]  are really the only thing we have to worry about because they're the only ones he says
[3:37:30.800 --> 3:37:36.720]  that will potentially figure out what we are up to imagine that there's not a conspiracy oh but
[3:37:36.720 --> 3:37:40.400]  wait there is but what but if you talk about it you're a bigot oh but if you don't like it you're
[3:37:40.400 --> 3:37:45.360]  bad because it does exist even though it didn't exist uh what like last year doesn't exist but
[3:37:45.360 --> 3:37:50.800]  now yet exist but you're bad if you disagree with it but i thought it didn't exist no it exists but
[3:37:50.800 --> 3:38:00.000]  it's good oh okay that's called gas loading by the way uh this is really important i forgot
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:05.360]  about this part he says uh in the scientific world commonwealth chapter he says that when we have this
[3:38:05.360 --> 3:38:12.080]  in place he says you won't go where you want to go he says that every bit of your movement will be
[3:38:12.080 --> 3:38:18.720]  controlled you're gonna be you're gonna be a lockdown lockdown your movement will be on lockdown
[3:38:19.840 --> 3:38:25.360]  what were the last two years about training is prepping us that we can't go where we want to go
[3:38:25.360 --> 3:38:30.640]  our movements have to be on lockdown we have to have government passes and and passports and
[3:38:31.360 --> 3:38:38.720]  gavi you know uh vaccine stamps and whatnot we gotta we gotta get bill gates is tramp stamped
[3:38:38.720 --> 3:38:43.040]  to travel to another country right well i'm not going to be bill gates is tramp so you're not
[3:38:43.040 --> 3:38:50.960]  going to tramp stamp me with some stupid id uh that bill gates has cooked up but hg wells said
[3:38:50.960 --> 3:38:55.200]  a hundred years ago that this would be the plan that they would roll this out socialized world
[3:38:55.200 --> 3:39:03.760]  banking he says we'll create a central bank central bank bureau of an intelligence that's
[3:39:03.760 --> 3:39:08.640]  a banker's running the intelligence telling you where you can and can't go well that sounds like
[3:39:08.640 --> 3:39:13.680]  like social uh that sounds like tracking and tracing in terms of everything that covet was about
[3:39:13.680 --> 3:39:18.240]  doesn't it he says then you have to understand that your private property will be done away with
[3:39:18.240 --> 3:39:22.800]  oh what did claus just say in the last five years over and over you will have nothing and you will
[3:39:22.800 --> 3:39:26.880]  be happy you'll own nothing you'll be happy hg wells said a hundred years ago do you see it's a
[3:39:26.880 --> 3:39:33.440]  it's a coordinated plan it's the same plan and it's not a bunch of communists in moscow it's the
[3:39:33.440 --> 3:39:41.680]  the top wealthiest people in the west that run this they're the same people behind this guy
[3:39:42.880 --> 3:39:48.320]  remember monopoly capitalist billionaires zillionaires not always but typically they love
[3:39:48.320 --> 3:39:55.840]  communism they love it because it's a trick a technique to steal especially middle class
[3:39:55.840 --> 3:40:01.440]  people's wealth or upper upper class people or the wealthy that are not the top point one percent
[3:40:01.440 --> 3:40:08.480]  it communism socialism or techniques scientific strategies and techniques to destroy societies
[3:40:08.480 --> 3:40:14.720]  consolidate their wealth and transfer it offshore to specific interests that are involved in that
[3:40:14.720 --> 3:40:21.040]  inner core of promoting socialism and communism and even many communists and socialists over the
[3:40:21.040 --> 3:40:26.960]  years have come to understand and realize that your private property property will be done away
[3:40:26.960 --> 3:40:32.160]  with he says in the technocratic state and he says that this is the essence of the new world order
[3:40:32.160 --> 3:40:36.640]  now at this time marxism was still a hot topic people were still really into the idea of world
[3:40:36.640 --> 3:40:42.800]  revolution and classical you could say what's called classic marxism an ac well just like
[3:40:42.800 --> 3:40:48.080]  birch and russell and all of his royal society cohorts says that there's a great experiment
[3:40:48.080 --> 3:40:54.000]  going on right now it's called the russian revolution it is a scientific experiment in
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:41:02.560]  scientific technocratic governance they're familiar with dostoevsky's novel called demons
[3:41:03.440 --> 3:41:09.280]  did you know that in that novel dostoevsky predicted the socialist communist revolutionaries
[3:41:09.280 --> 3:41:15.520]  and their mass death and chaos there's a character who's the socialist demonically
[3:41:15.520 --> 3:41:21.760]  possessed individual in the book who says that the revolution will come about on the
[3:41:21.760 --> 3:41:28.640]  top of a mountain of a hundred million skulls and that was written years before right the
[3:41:28.640 --> 3:41:34.640]  bolstering revolution now how did dostoevsky know this well i i think that he kind of had a
[3:41:34.640 --> 3:41:39.520]  you can almost say a quasi prophetic inspiration right to to understand and to warn people what
[3:41:39.520 --> 3:41:45.600]  was coming and we see the arts oftentimes warning people what did i just cover recently here on the
[3:41:45.600 --> 3:41:52.160]  fourth hour was c.s lewis's space trilogy tolkins lord of the rings trilogy those are prophetic
[3:41:52.160 --> 3:41:57.680]  warnings and if you get really deep into the parallels between those two trilogies you know
[3:41:57.680 --> 3:42:02.560]  that there's intentional messages there's intentional things put in there where we were being warned in
[3:42:02.560 --> 3:42:08.080]  fact i just dug up the other day that tolkin himself was trained in by british intelligence
[3:42:08.080 --> 3:42:12.320]  in cryptography that was something that was declassified not too long ago the london telegraph
[3:42:12.320 --> 3:42:17.440]  has a whole paper on that whole uh write up on that what that shows us is that no you see that's
[3:42:17.440 --> 3:42:23.040]  why tolkin understood what was really going on now he really understood the big geopolitical plan
[3:42:23.040 --> 3:42:28.560]  he was really putting that stuff into his his novels especially the somerillian too because all
[3:42:28.560 --> 3:42:34.000]  of that is about an allegory of the christian system and the final battle right battling the
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:38.080]  great beast system the eye of sauron that's what tolkin was running about and that's what c.s lewis
[3:42:38.080 --> 3:42:42.800]  was running about and they knew what these people were up to that's who that they're writing about
[3:42:42.800 --> 3:42:47.120]  these people don't you understand that they understood from within the system just like
[3:42:47.120 --> 3:42:52.640]  george orwell did eric blair what the socialists and the technocrats really have planned this is the

[3:47:13.680 --> 3:47:17.680]  welcome back to the elex jones show i'm your guest host jay dyer james now we are working our way
[3:47:17.680 --> 3:47:23.680]  through the infamous globalist text that just lays it all out in actually a pretty short number of
[3:47:23.680 --> 3:47:31.440]  pages it's about 150 pages so if you want an easy quick to the point read i highly recommend reading
[3:47:31.440 --> 3:47:36.080]  the open conspiracy by hg wells of course if you don't have time to do that one of the things i do is
[3:47:36.080 --> 3:47:39.920]  i lecture through all these books for you i'm the nerd that does your homework you can go to my
[3:47:39.920 --> 3:47:43.520]  website you can go to my youtube channel and you can find playlists where i lecture through i think
[3:47:43.520 --> 3:47:49.920]  we're about up to 50 maybe even almost 60 now writings of the elite including many white papers
[3:47:49.920 --> 3:47:56.000]  documents all in public domain by the way all of these are public documents public writings by
[3:47:56.000 --> 3:48:03.600]  very powerful men very uh infamous influential figures brzezinski's kisinders joc ateles right
[3:48:03.600 --> 3:48:09.200]  these kind of geopolitical uh stage people out there well known they all write everything that
[3:48:09.200 --> 3:48:13.440]  they're up to in their books and i think that that's what you know people who are just uneducated on
[3:48:13.440 --> 3:48:17.440]  this they don't really know what's going on they don't realize that you know if you were to be in
[3:48:17.440 --> 3:48:24.240]  an international relations program in in a college at the graduate phd level you would be exposed to
[3:48:24.240 --> 3:48:28.560]  a lot of these writings you would be exposed to kisinders you would be exposed to brzezinski's
[3:48:28.560 --> 3:48:36.240]  writings and all this would be really uh really pretty easy to to find pretty accessible and
[3:48:36.240 --> 3:48:41.120]  nowadays with the internet i mean it should be even more easy to very you think about five minutes
[3:48:41.120 --> 3:48:45.440]  to find out if this is really a book by hg wells and who hg wells was right just do a little bit
[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:49.840]  googling you could easily find this out right so we're kind of at a point where it's inexcusable
[3:48:49.840 --> 3:48:54.960]  i think to be ignorant of this we're reaching that point where it's like if people aren't awake by
[3:48:54.960 --> 3:49:00.320]  now they're probably not going to wake up right but we do have a significant portion of the population
[3:49:00.320 --> 3:49:08.000]  awake so never give up always continue to try but back to hg wells you know he was i was talking
[3:49:08.000 --> 3:49:13.280]  about tolkin and louis and if you remember both of them were familiar with hg wells i think louis
[3:49:13.280 --> 3:49:17.920]  uh would sometimes go to kind of a writer's circle not necessarily the inklings but there
[3:49:17.920 --> 3:49:22.080]  was a separate circle of writers and people that he was familiar with uh a lot of the
[3:49:22.720 --> 3:49:26.800]  cambridge and oxford elite at the in those in those decades new of each other they knew of
[3:49:26.800 --> 3:49:33.920]  huxley and louis knew of the of hg wells of course they had diametrically opposed worldviews as did
[3:49:33.920 --> 3:49:38.720]  tolkin and wells but keep in mind that people like wells people like birch and rustle people
[3:49:38.720 --> 3:49:44.960]  like the huxleys those are who louis and tolkin are thinking about and so they knew about books
[3:49:44.960 --> 3:49:52.480]  like this they knew that these these books were uh publicly out there being published stating openly
[3:49:52.480 --> 3:49:57.200]  what they plan to do and so the next time you're talking to a skeptic and they say well i don't
[3:49:57.200 --> 3:50:00.960]  believe in any of this conspiracy crap that's all made of that and they say oh do you are you
[3:50:00.960 --> 3:50:06.160]  familiar with c.s louis are you aware that he talks about all the same stuff are you if you heard of
[3:50:06.160 --> 3:50:09.760]  tolkin's lord of the rings that's actually about this did you know that that's actually about this
[3:50:09.760 --> 3:50:14.320]  or by the way that that's a little all saying aye there on the cover maybe that helps kind of put
[3:50:14.320 --> 3:50:21.440]  this into perspective hg wells goes on to say that we are at war with tradition main thing we
[3:50:21.440 --> 3:50:26.960]  got to fight his tradition he said if you want to you want to prove that he says look at look at
[3:50:26.960 --> 3:50:33.760]  flags he says flags are made up therefore countries are made up right well that's kind of a fallacy
[3:50:33.760 --> 3:50:38.720]  because if flags are made up then the british empire is made up which is what he was a propagandist
[3:50:38.720 --> 3:50:43.040]  for so i'm curious if he actually thought that the british he actually probably would say that too
[3:50:43.040 --> 3:50:48.080]  right he would say well i don't really believe in the empire that uh that that employs me and uses
[3:50:48.080 --> 3:50:53.840]  me for this technocratic uh end game but um eventually it will give way to the the perfect
[3:50:53.840 --> 3:50:59.440]  technocratic order by the way at the new world order kind came up with a flag wouldn't that mean
[3:50:59.440 --> 3:51:04.080]  that the new world order's flag is also fake i mean you see how easy it is to kind of refute
[3:51:04.080 --> 3:51:09.360]  these these ideas that if everything's just made up then and everything's relative by the way
[3:51:09.360 --> 3:51:15.200]  then his whole system is made up and relative why would we accept socialism if nothing's true
[3:51:15.200 --> 3:51:19.280]  i mean he's saying that there's not really anything true everything's just constantly evolving well
[3:51:19.280 --> 3:51:25.200]  isn't it also the case then that that's evolving that that's not objectively true but you'll notice
[3:51:25.200 --> 3:51:29.360]  that they're never really concerned with being consistent they're mainly propagandists remember
[3:51:29.360 --> 3:51:35.200]  the hc wells was a he was the edward bernese of his time he was the great propagandist of his day
[3:51:36.240 --> 3:51:41.680]  and got it down to a scientific technique that's why he wrote so much science fiction now every
[3:51:41.680 --> 3:51:44.880]  now and then he would also write these kind of nonfiction books saying here's the real plan
[3:51:45.600 --> 3:51:51.520]  but if you go read my fiction books those are all propaganda to seed the ideas right war of the
[3:51:51.520 --> 3:51:55.760]  world's what's that about well that's not really about aliens i mean it is but it's really about
[3:51:55.760 --> 3:52:04.080]  the alien threat the fear of global catastrophes in global war we're gonna have science to save us
[3:52:04.080 --> 3:52:10.800]  we're gonna have a scientific world government controlling body that will save us from the
[3:52:10.800 --> 3:52:19.360]  calamities of mankind he says we're gonna have to have phases he says let's let me give you the phases
[3:52:19.360 --> 3:52:25.520]  he says the first thing we'll we'll do is we'll roll out more and more and more class warfare
[3:52:26.320 --> 3:52:30.880]  now remember he's writing this back in the in sort of the heyday of marxism back in the 1920s
[3:52:31.440 --> 3:52:36.480]  and he says that we're gonna roll out class warfare because if we can convince everybody
[3:52:36.480 --> 3:52:43.600]  that class warfare is the easiest path to world government by unifying everybody against these
[3:52:43.600 --> 3:52:49.040]  global threats right so for example he would say that like we saw with war of the worlds
[3:52:49.040 --> 3:52:56.480]  these global threats can destroy the human race the idea of unbridled capitalism will
[3:52:56.480 --> 3:53:02.160]  destroy the human race this is his argument this he says will be a trick to convince people of world
[3:53:02.160 --> 3:53:09.760]  socialism as the only possible solution out of world collapse and catastrophe he says this will
[3:53:09.760 --> 3:53:15.520]  give us a oligarchical global government remember this is what we find a very new world where you
[3:53:15.520 --> 3:53:20.240]  have 10 world socialist dictators if I remember it's been many years since I read very new world but
[3:53:21.120 --> 3:53:26.400]  the main socialist dictator character is mustapham on and he's one of the 10 world socialist controllers
[3:53:26.400 --> 3:53:32.320]  right so they have 10 of these are over these big regions and they represent a kind of oligarchical
[3:53:32.320 --> 3:53:38.880]  controlling technocratic elite class and he says that this these oligarchs eventually will take
[3:53:38.880 --> 3:53:44.720]  over this new world order and he says that when we finally got enough of this in place not enough
[3:53:44.720 --> 3:53:50.720]  of our men in place he says we will flip the script and we will put an end to the family and the
[3:53:50.720 --> 3:53:59.040]  nation state the family and the nation state will be blamed for all of the world wars all of the
[3:53:59.040 --> 3:54:04.880]  economic chaos and collapse what do the world economic form people say you have too much there
[3:54:04.880 --> 3:54:11.200]  is too much resources too much paper using the resources unbridled capitalism is the problem
[3:54:11.200 --> 3:54:16.960]  we're going to take over you say so when they take over they will give you the solution to the
[3:54:16.960 --> 3:54:27.280]  problem that they admit they've engineered 1917 bolster revolution according to hd wells he says
[3:54:27.280 --> 3:54:34.560]  was key he says that the bolster revolution is the model for the global illuminate confirm
[3:54:34.560 --> 3:54:39.920]  revolution to bring in the technocratic world order he says if you want to know some of the key
[3:54:39.920 --> 3:54:44.640]  things that we did along the way and what we'll have to do in the future he says first of all
[3:54:44.640 --> 3:54:50.080]  he's we're going to have to bring about total mechanization of all society total mechanization
[3:54:51.520 --> 3:54:55.840]  he says what to control all energy and resources all flows of capital all flows of people
[3:54:57.360 --> 3:55:05.040]  he says women will be out of the house they will become professionals he says when we have
[3:55:05.040 --> 3:55:11.680]  done that we will achieve plateaus republic model and eventually we'll have to do away with
[3:55:12.560 --> 3:55:18.080]  the workers and the builders we won't need them anymore after total mechanization so you see
[3:55:18.080 --> 3:55:24.480]  how everybody's being used right everybody in every strata of society every area of society
[3:55:24.480 --> 3:55:29.600]  education religion everybody is a tool being used by this plot
[3:55:29.600 --> 3:55:38.880]  he says eventually we will end the labor class we won't need the worker essential workers
[3:55:40.160 --> 3:55:45.600]  we won't need them anymore we will end the labor class because mechanization will replace the need
[3:55:45.600 --> 3:55:53.920]  for the workers thus global capitalism monopoly capitalism will build the infrastructure of the
[3:55:53.920 --> 3:56:00.640]  global world order it will then flip after a time of chaos collapse and destruction probably what
[3:56:00.640 --> 3:56:06.320]  we're going through now i don't know it could be another 10 20 years this is their plan says then
[3:56:06.320 --> 3:56:16.720]  it will be the new order of the ages model after bolshevism sovietism and western capitalism
