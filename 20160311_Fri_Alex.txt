[01:45.920 --> 01:49.360]  crazy in the news now they're going yes of course we're gonna try to broker it

[02:03.800 --> 02:10.320]  barter here's the issue if he's a strict constructionist with a
[02:10.320 --> 02:15.880]  constitution then you can't have ten cruises not natural born that said they
[02:15.880 --> 02:19.080]  go well we have a precedent with obama and his providence being questioned so
[02:19.080 --> 02:25.880]  it must be okay well no ladies and gentlemen it's not okay and it's all
[02:25.880 --> 02:30.040]  part of just a road in the constitution there's also another video the drudge
[02:30.040 --> 02:34.640]  has and info wars has i noticed the site that had its crashing but we've got the
[02:34.640 --> 02:40.280]  video and and the article of ten cruises dad you know laying on hands the
[02:40.280 --> 02:44.680]  talking about ted being the annoying one talking in tongues the media is making
[02:44.680 --> 02:49.120]  fun of us i don't make fun of christians or other religious groups i myself is
[02:49.120 --> 02:55.040]  a christian and i think it's insulting at certain levels to to to make fun of
[02:55.040 --> 02:59.840]  all this at the same time though the question is is he being sincere is he
[02:59.840 --> 03:05.200]  being sincere because you know he's this big bush tpp architect and his wife
[03:05.200 --> 03:09.640]  hooked him with the top globalist and then now the bushes are backing him and
[03:09.640 --> 03:13.400]  is financing for the campaign and he's got glenn beck i'm excuse me benedict
[03:13.400 --> 03:18.040]  arnold me glenn becks his name sitting there backing him as well there's quite
[03:18.040 --> 03:24.840]  a constellation quite a grouping of concerns around him by contrast watching
[03:24.840 --> 03:28.920]  trump last night when they would go hey you you bring in some foreign workers he
[03:28.920 --> 03:33.080]  goes yeah legally and you know you you get some stuff made a lot of your
[03:33.080 --> 03:39.400]  clothing lines made in latin america and trump went yeah i told you it's not a
[03:39.400 --> 03:44.080]  fair system i'm a businessman i have to compete within that system and so i'm
[03:44.080 --> 03:48.640]  trying to change it and make it fair so that we can produce things here in
[03:48.640 --> 03:53.120]  america that's that's absolutely right he's saying it's a fraud it's a scam
[03:53.120 --> 03:59.400]  listen in its americans choices as well we sell made in latin america clothing i
[03:59.400 --> 04:02.520]  try not to get it from china because people are so exploited we sell a bunch
[04:02.520 --> 04:07.200]  of stuff made in nicaragua and places like that that's high quality and and we
[04:07.200 --> 04:11.840]  can get those shirts for three or four dollars a piece and then sell them for
[04:11.840 --> 04:14.720]  fifteen bucks and people want to buy what's cheaper and they'll be able to
[04:14.720 --> 04:18.560]  find our operation when i get stuff made in america because the regulations and
[04:18.560 --> 04:24.400]  all the internal tariffs and the garbage the same shirt cost nine to twelve
[04:24.400 --> 04:32.600]  dollars designer shirts we try to get made here cost twenty five dollars then
[04:32.600 --> 04:35.480]  we gotta sell them for like thirty or forty to make any money so we sell the
[04:35.480 --> 04:39.040]  made in america and then right next to it we sell the other stuff and people buy
[04:39.040 --> 04:42.920]  the less expensive that's a fact we'll have to compete i give you the choice
[04:42.920 --> 04:46.840]  trumps right we're gonna break all this down and a ton more straight ahead

[08:50.780 --> 08:53.040]  despite the whole establishment
[08:53.040 --> 08:55.240]  attacking him as viciously as they can
[08:55.240 --> 08:59.400]  uh... and also uh... he's again at about sixty five percent as we take this
[08:59.400 --> 09:00.920]  at the big drudge poll
[09:00.920 --> 09:03.200]  right now with just tons of folks voting
[09:03.200 --> 09:04.960]  on that we also have our own polls

[09:15.080 --> 09:18.520]  thousands of democrats is going to be millions also propelled reagan of the
[09:18.520 --> 09:19.240]  wild
[09:19.240 --> 09:23.320]  trump in some states has hundreds of thousands of extra people voting in the
[09:23.320 --> 09:26.200]  republican primary not seen since reagan
[09:26.200 --> 09:28.760]  and these are these are reagan democrats
[09:28.760 --> 09:31.360]  uh... these are people that are socially liberal in some ways but you know
[09:31.360 --> 09:32.280]  they understand
[09:32.280 --> 09:33.960]  the country's being shut down
[09:33.960 --> 09:36.320]  cutting taxes on middle class and poor people
[09:36.320 --> 09:39.120]  like kennedy did reagan did is the way to go
[09:39.120 --> 09:40.160]  so that's a very
[09:40.160 --> 09:42.920]  very important article up on info wars dot com
[09:42.920 --> 09:45.960]  uh... also there is this sickening
[09:45.960 --> 09:48.360]  sickening sickening story
[09:48.360 --> 09:50.600]  uh... where obama has come out
[09:50.600 --> 09:53.040]  uh... in a speech that we're going to play club of a moment
[09:53.040 --> 09:55.040]  and said that
[09:55.040 --> 09:58.080]  he hasn't divided anybody in america
[09:58.080 --> 10:00.560]  i mean you think about the nerve of that
[10:00.560 --> 10:01.720]  to say that
[10:01.720 --> 10:02.680]  he hasn't
[10:02.680 --> 10:04.440]  divided anybody
[10:04.440 --> 10:05.200]  in
[10:05.200 --> 10:07.280]  this country in fact here's the actual quote
[10:07.280 --> 10:10.800]  obama i certainly have not contributed to dividing the country
[10:10.800 --> 10:12.720]  he has had his proxies
[10:12.720 --> 10:16.080]  from alsharpton to all the financing of george soros
[10:16.080 --> 10:17.440]  on record
[10:17.440 --> 10:21.600]  funding groups to go out and say deck the halls with dead cops
[10:21.600 --> 10:25.960]  and going out and saying we're going to federalize the police
[10:25.960 --> 10:29.720]  by causing these crises he's been caught funding the trayvon martin
[10:29.720 --> 10:33.240]  protesters he's been caught because he's double black unemployment
[10:33.240 --> 10:36.080]  so they want to change the subject of the democrats are screwing black people
[10:36.080 --> 10:37.200]  everybody else over
[10:37.200 --> 10:40.320]  to get us all fighting with each other classic divide and conquer so this is
[10:40.320 --> 10:42.040]  like saying
[10:42.040 --> 10:45.560]  if you have a business you didn't build that or saying two plus two doesn't equal
[10:45.560 --> 10:46.360]  four
[10:46.360 --> 10:48.800]  this is one another one of the humongoid
[10:48.800 --> 10:50.400]  gigantore
[10:50.400 --> 10:52.320]  uh... colossal
[10:52.320 --> 10:56.280]  uh... redonkulous pieces of of of garbage
[10:56.280 --> 10:58.240]  that has been spewed at us obama
[10:58.240 --> 11:01.040]  i certainly have not contributed to dividing the country
[11:01.040 --> 11:06.560]  when he has become the divider in chief and the big foundations have spent
[11:06.560 --> 11:08.720]  hundreds of millions of dollars
[11:08.720 --> 11:10.640]  trying to foment racial strife
[11:10.640 --> 11:13.320]  and unrest and the super bowl has endorsed it
[11:13.320 --> 11:17.800]  and hollywood is pumping it you can see the message in fact there's more race
[11:17.800 --> 11:22.360]  war garbage being put out and there is anti-family anti-male garbage
[11:22.360 --> 11:24.520]  let's get it straight whether you're black white
[11:24.520 --> 11:26.800]  a human got red blood
[11:26.800 --> 11:29.840]  they are trying to divide and screw everybody over
[11:29.840 --> 11:33.640]  they are look they're attacking men in every sitcom and every drama and every
[11:33.640 --> 11:34.640]  movie you see
[11:34.640 --> 11:37.640]  stupid weak role models
[11:37.640 --> 11:42.000]  men we're under attack and women you're under attack try to take men from you
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.840]  come on let's just come together for humanity
[11:44.840 --> 11:47.920]  they're attacking seeds that produce
[11:47.920 --> 11:52.120]  good seeds they're killing the life process of the earth to have a monopoly
[11:52.120 --> 11:53.200]  over life
[11:53.200 --> 11:57.000]  to make you so sick you gotta have all their high-tech medicines to live
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.720]  we gotta go to them to buy seeds that'll even reproduce again
[12:01.720 --> 12:02.560]  and and
[12:02.560 --> 12:05.560]  are based on toxic chemicals
[12:05.560 --> 12:09.320]  this is crazy folks it's their philosophy it's evil it's alien it's like
[12:09.320 --> 12:11.880]  not of this world
[12:11.880 --> 12:15.040]  but it's the god of this world
[12:15.040 --> 12:18.480]  fallen to this world to rule us read the bible it's all in plain view

[12:29.440 --> 12:31.160]  I talked to top CEOs
[12:31.160 --> 12:33.560]  people worth hundreds of millions of dollars they don't even know about this
[12:33.560 --> 12:37.240]  I pull up MIT about Chimera chestating humans all over the U.S.

[12:41.840 --> 12:44.840]  so that when it's right in front of you in reality you don't know it
[12:44.840 --> 12:49.680]  these are aliens they're creating inside these these cows and pigs and sheep
[12:49.680 --> 12:53.080]  you're like the aliens didn't aren't coming from a distant planet the elite
[12:53.080 --> 12:54.280]  are creating
[12:54.280 --> 12:58.240]  their own creation by twisting life forms
[12:58.240 --> 13:01.680]  I'm sorry I don't have this segment I'm ranting
[13:01.680 --> 13:04.760]  all right how many okay so let's go ahead
[13:04.760 --> 13:06.240]  let's go ahead and play
[13:06.240 --> 13:09.560]  this clip of Obama I certainly have not contributed to divide the country here
[13:09.560 --> 13:11.200]  it is
[13:11.200 --> 13:13.760]  a notion that
[13:13.760 --> 13:15.680]  uh... everything I do
[13:15.680 --> 13:17.440]  is
[13:17.440 --> 13:18.800]  to be opposed
[13:18.800 --> 13:21.800]  uh... that
[13:21.800 --> 13:24.280]  cooperation or compromise
[13:24.280 --> 13:25.760]  somehow
[13:25.760 --> 13:27.920]  is a betrayal
[13:27.920 --> 13:29.040]  that
[13:29.040 --> 13:32.400]  maximalist absolutist positions
[13:32.400 --> 13:35.680]  on issues
[13:35.680 --> 13:37.080]  are
[13:37.080 --> 13:39.800]  politically advantageous
[13:39.800 --> 13:43.040]  uh... that
[13:43.040 --> 13:46.520]  there is a them out there and in us and
[13:46.520 --> 13:50.000]  uh... them are the folks who are causing
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.880]  whatever problems you're experiencing
[13:52.880 --> 13:55.920]  uh... and
[13:55.920 --> 13:58.360]  the tone of that politics
[13:58.360 --> 14:02.000]  uh... which i certainly have not contributed to i have not
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.040]  uh... you know i don't think that uh... i was the one to prompt
[14:07.040 --> 14:08.880]  uh... questions about
[14:08.880 --> 14:12.600]  uh... my birth certificate for example i don't remember
[14:12.600 --> 14:15.880]  saying hey why don't you
[14:15.880 --> 14:18.560]  ask me about that
[14:18.560 --> 14:20.440]  uh...
[14:20.440 --> 14:22.080]  why don't you
[14:22.080 --> 14:23.960]  you know question uh...
[14:23.960 --> 14:25.480]  whether i'm american or
[14:25.480 --> 14:27.480]  or whether i'm loyal or
[14:27.480 --> 14:31.480]  uh... whether i have america's best interests uh... at heart
[14:31.480 --> 14:34.960]  uh... you know that those are things that were prompted by any actions of
[14:34.960 --> 14:35.920]  mine
[14:35.920 --> 14:37.040]  all right now
[14:37.040 --> 14:40.600]  there it is just another over-the-top statement that anyone paying attention
[14:40.600 --> 14:43.440]  knows has not been going on
[14:43.440 --> 14:45.520]  here's what i want to say i'm not more about this one i
[14:45.520 --> 14:46.800]  come online
[14:46.800 --> 14:48.400]  obama is here in town
[14:48.400 --> 14:49.760]  it's not by southwest
[14:49.760 --> 14:52.160]  it's the biggest conference now probably in the world
[14:52.160 --> 14:53.760]  for multimedia film
[14:53.760 --> 14:55.240]  uh... and music
[14:55.240 --> 14:57.960]  it started thirty-something years ago here in austin by the guy that owns the
[14:57.960 --> 15:00.640]  austin chronicle that is literally
[15:00.640 --> 15:03.520]  the biggest rag on the planet of disinformation
[15:03.520 --> 15:07.720]  and just pushes pure globalist agenda i mean it is a joke okay the guy has
[15:07.720 --> 15:10.160]  been after me since i got on here
[15:10.160 --> 15:12.360]  uh... just just just unbelievable
[15:12.360 --> 15:13.600]  unbelievable
[15:13.600 --> 15:16.440]  uh... the things they've done to try to shut us down and kick us off the air
[15:16.440 --> 15:18.440]  these these people are just like
[15:18.440 --> 15:19.720]  the attorney general
[15:19.720 --> 15:23.880]  it says you know we're talking to the fb i about arresting climate deniers
[15:23.880 --> 15:25.280]  these people mean business
[15:25.280 --> 15:26.920]  i don't care they dress like beatniks
[15:26.920 --> 15:28.160]  they are predators
[15:28.160 --> 15:29.720]  they're parasites
[15:29.720 --> 15:32.880]  they have all these dreams hollywood is about stealing dreams
[15:32.880 --> 15:35.280]  get your young daughter is the beauty queen to go out there thinking she's in
[15:35.280 --> 15:36.200]  a movie star
[15:36.200 --> 15:38.680]  and she ends up being a prostitute
[15:38.680 --> 15:40.520]  it's about sucking your dreams
[15:40.520 --> 15:44.160]  and they advertise all these want to be musicians the first
[15:44.160 --> 15:45.880]  bug zapper they put up
[15:45.880 --> 15:48.320]  was that you come to us to be a musician
[15:48.320 --> 15:51.440]  and then it all is musicians attending other musicians events
[15:51.440 --> 15:55.080]  all desperately trying to make it with scam record deals ripping them off okay
[15:55.080 --> 15:56.040]  i've lived here
[15:56.040 --> 15:58.760]  uh... twenty six twenty seven years i've seen it
[15:58.760 --> 16:01.520]  seen the town i know the scene it's delusional
[16:01.520 --> 16:03.400]  everybody that wants to be a big star
[16:03.400 --> 16:05.680]  you know comes here to get ripped off
[16:05.680 --> 16:08.480]  he got some computer companies here some multimedia
[16:08.480 --> 16:11.560]  and most these companies have half their staff working for free even though
[16:11.560 --> 16:14.680]  they have phd's and degrees and engineering degrees to try to make
[16:14.680 --> 16:15.760]  money to try to make it
[16:15.760 --> 16:17.440]  like most women in porn now
[16:17.440 --> 16:19.720]  you know don't don't get paid
[16:19.720 --> 16:23.040]  so it's the same deal uh... most people i do the work discovery channel that
[16:23.040 --> 16:25.600]  we're making two hundred grand a year as top camera people don't even get paid
[16:25.600 --> 16:27.960]  basically anything anymore
[16:27.960 --> 16:29.800]  i mean this is how the scam works okay
[16:29.800 --> 16:33.160]  and it's all because they get this big blood in here you pay thousands of
[16:33.160 --> 16:34.040]  dollars
[16:34.040 --> 16:37.360]  thousands of dollars to be able to even get into some of the events and you go
[16:37.360 --> 16:42.360]  here some global a spew at you from google or apple and now obama and it's
[16:42.360 --> 16:46.040]  just perfect how he sold all these fake dreams and all this fake hope he's all
[16:46.040 --> 16:49.960]  over movies and tv and drama because he doesn't target the news audience that's
[16:49.960 --> 16:54.480]  somewhat inform now they target yuppies and trendies that follow every rule every
[16:54.480 --> 16:55.680]  political correct
[16:55.680 --> 16:57.760]  you know religious mantra
[16:57.760 --> 17:01.240]  they do what they're told in belief that they'll be accepted into the system
[17:01.240 --> 17:03.120]  and they're not and it's like
[17:03.120 --> 17:07.240]  zombies we're gonna show footage of this just all these shuffling poor pathetic
[17:07.240 --> 17:09.040]  people looking for a dream

[17:12.680 --> 17:14.160]  try to meet people
[17:14.160 --> 17:17.840]  and there's all these vampires involved lewis black of the chronicles at the top
[17:17.840 --> 17:18.560]  of it

[17:23.360 --> 17:25.880]  involved and then they do things like
[17:25.880 --> 17:27.200]  this all of the news
[17:27.200 --> 17:30.360]  if someone tries to have a rock band play in a parking lot of this grocery
[17:30.360 --> 17:31.160]  store
[17:31.160 --> 17:34.600]  they have mafia show up and threaten them that you're gonna be shut down

[17:49.240 --> 17:50.840]  cops but i'm not going to follow the orders

[23:50.040 --> 23:59.320]  800-803-5505 800-803-5505
[23:59.320 --> 24:03.080]  you know australia is a good example canada is a good example
[24:03.080 --> 24:09.240]  the uk is a good example why because each of them had mass killings somebody
[24:09.240 --> 24:13.720]  somewhere will comment and say obama politicized this
[24:13.720 --> 24:16.680]  issue well this is something we should
[24:16.680 --> 24:20.280]  politicize i'm not going to carry a gun i don't want to be involved in the gun
[24:20.280 --> 24:24.840]  fight if i could have gotten 51 votes in the senate of the
[24:24.840 --> 24:29.800]  united states for an outright ban picking up every
[24:29.800 --> 24:38.760]  one of them mr and mrs america turn them all in
[24:38.760 --> 24:42.920]  go ahead make my day so the notion that
[24:42.920 --> 24:47.560]  gun laws don't work it's not borne out by the evidence he says that the chicago
[24:47.560 --> 24:50.680]  police had a plan over this bloody fourth of
[24:50.680 --> 24:54.440]  july weekend nonetheless as you indicated cori
[24:54.440 --> 24:59.880]  there was a count of casualties that could have been from afghanistan or
[24:59.880 --> 25:04.040]  iraq will make it harder for law-abiding citizens
[25:04.040 --> 25:08.440]  and criminals will still get their guns in many cases the offenders
[25:08.440 --> 25:13.320]  felons a sum out on parole some out on bond
[25:13.320 --> 25:16.200]  we have to respect the tradition in this country
[25:16.200 --> 25:19.800]  of people who want to defend themselves and their family
[25:19.800 --> 25:22.840]  from violence there are people at high levels in this
[25:22.840 --> 25:29.480]  government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day seven days a week the average
[25:29.480 --> 25:32.920]  american does not have that mayor bloomberg why
[25:32.920 --> 25:37.640]  like why can you defend yourself but not the majority of americans i mean look
[25:37.640 --> 25:42.440]  at look at the team of security you got every day every school at every level
[25:42.440 --> 25:46.120]  one thing that i think is clear with young people and with adults as well
[25:46.120 --> 25:49.800]  is that we just have to be repetitive about this and we need to do this every
[25:49.800 --> 25:53.400]  day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[25:53.400 --> 25:58.120]  about guns in a vastly different way was this the weapon of choice for a new
[25:58.120 --> 26:01.240]  kind of terrorist when a five-year-old girl said
[26:01.240 --> 26:04.760]  she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles
[26:04.760 --> 26:09.400]  the school calls it a terrorist threat ak-47s belonging to the hands of
[26:09.400 --> 26:13.080]  soldiers not in the hands of criminals you know the right to bear arms is
[26:13.080 --> 26:16.120]  because that's the last form of defense against tyranny
[26:16.120 --> 26:19.800]  lay down your arms you damn rebels
[26:19.800 --> 26:23.960]  but we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army or the police
[26:23.960 --> 26:27.240]  what kind of a situation in the u.s would you see that happening i mean we've
[26:27.240 --> 26:29.800]  got a lot of competition listening to a lot of people that
[26:29.800 --> 26:33.800]  it's like power weapons discover the clergy would help the government with
[26:33.800 --> 26:39.400]  potentially their biggest problem us to say we're not turning our guns in and
[26:39.400 --> 26:43.640]  we're not running and we're not knocking down if you want to
[26:43.640 --> 26:50.200]  commentator rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty
[26:50.200 --> 27:07.640]  it's alec johnson
[27:07.640 --> 27:11.640]  i wanted to play that intro right there because that's reality standing in front
[27:11.640 --> 27:14.680]  of the alamo it was so spiritual because
[27:14.680 --> 27:18.280]  it had just been an old feedlot after they burned it down and destroyed it
[27:18.280 --> 27:21.560]  and then it got turned into a warehouse and by the 50s
[27:21.560 --> 27:26.200]  it became a national landmark from the daughter's republic of texas paid with
[27:26.200 --> 27:33.320]  donations that people like my grandmothers got together to
[27:33.320 --> 27:36.920]  rebuild the alamo if you're a radio listener that intro you heard is
[27:36.920 --> 27:40.840]  is uh at the end is is myself speaking at the alamo
[27:40.840 --> 27:44.120]  with the former texas land commissioner at the time that actually
[27:44.120 --> 27:47.640]  changed the rules where you can have political speeches there under the first
[27:47.640 --> 27:51.560]  amendment uh at the front of the alamo so it was incredible to be
[27:51.560 --> 27:56.040]  the first person and the first group of people ever since the alamo was destroyed
[27:56.040 --> 27:59.400]  to be giving a speech about we're not turning our guns in here in the spirit
[27:59.400 --> 28:02.120]  of the alamo
[28:02.200 --> 28:07.080]  almost 200 years later it was just one of the greatest pleasures of my life
[28:07.080 --> 28:10.520]  and got to me emotionally so much i even blew my voice out that i was screaming
[28:10.520 --> 28:14.520]  so loud with pleasure and the reason i raised that is that's what fulfills the
[28:14.520 --> 28:17.640]  soul folks is doing an open carry at the alamo
[28:17.640 --> 28:21.000]  in defiance of laws that are clearly unconstitutional and illegal and the
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.280]  police did the right thing and stood down not because of any threats but
[28:24.280 --> 28:27.240]  because they knew the city law was trumped by the state law and we had
[28:27.240 --> 28:31.560]  state officials there to point that out you have to exercise
[28:31.560 --> 28:35.240]  rights that are proper and and rights that are protected and rights that are
[28:35.240 --> 28:39.000]  fought for or you lose them now that's it
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.800]  there's an article up on info wars dot com and i challenge you to go look at it
[28:41.800 --> 28:44.600]  for yourself and i challenge even your children to go look at it
[28:44.600 --> 28:47.240]  i don't want children to look at fake harm children should probably see some
[28:47.240 --> 28:50.600]  real horror so they know what to fear in this world so they can
[28:50.600 --> 28:55.000]  become strong to resist it muslim migrant melts off wife's face with boiling
[28:55.000 --> 28:58.200]  oil if you're a radio listener go to info wars dot com and look at the
[28:58.200 --> 29:03.000]  world net daily article and she got home and he pulled back
[29:03.000 --> 29:07.560]  the shower curtain of her husband and said have a look and he was holding a pot
[29:07.560 --> 29:13.400]  of boiling oil and he dumped it over her face we're going to come back and
[29:13.400 --> 29:17.880]  talk about this but see that's killing people's dreams as well that's what
[29:17.880 --> 29:20.920]  radical islam and most of islam now is about is
[29:20.920 --> 29:24.360]  is enslaving people controlling their minds controlling their dreams
[29:24.360 --> 29:28.200]  and mutilating them if they don't submit and dominating women
[29:28.200 --> 29:32.120]  and that's why the left loves it because they hate women they hate reproduction
[29:32.120 --> 29:35.880]  they hate power they they hate the power of the goddess archetype
[29:35.880 --> 29:38.120]  that's why they claim they want to represent it because they want to
[29:38.120 --> 29:48.040]  dominate it and kill it we'll be back with their war on women straight ahead
[29:48.040 --> 29:51.880]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[33:17.560 --> 33:22.440]  because there is a war on for your mind
[33:32.440 --> 33:35.880]  we are back on this live friday march 11 edition

[33:43.160 --> 33:46.440]  but i will be here with you until the top of the hour and we're going to be
[33:46.440 --> 33:49.480]  talking about what happened in the debate last night because
[33:49.480 --> 33:53.480]  jake tapper of cnn who is normally quite a smart guy
[33:53.480 --> 33:57.880]  asked a really dumb question of donald trump we're going to go ahead and play
[33:57.880 --> 34:00.920]  that clip here it is
[34:01.480 --> 34:05.400]  mr trump let me start with you last night you told cnn quote
[34:05.400 --> 34:10.200]  islam hates us did you mean all 1.6 billion muslims
[34:10.200 --> 34:17.480]  i mean a lot of them i mean a lot of them
[34:17.480 --> 34:20.520]  do you want to clarify the comment at all well you know i've been watching the
[34:20.520 --> 34:24.760]  debate today and they're talking about radical islamic terrorism or radical
[34:24.760 --> 34:27.960]  islam but i will tell you there's something going on
[34:27.960 --> 34:31.080]  that maybe you don't know about and maybe a lot of other people don't know
[34:31.080 --> 34:34.200]  about but there's tremendous hatred and i will stick
[34:34.200 --> 34:38.440]  with exactly what i said to anderson cooper
[34:38.440 --> 34:42.680]  so there's trump responding to jake tapper's question during last night's
[34:42.680 --> 34:47.000]  debate and obviously every time there's a major terrorist attack such as paris
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.280]  etc and people make the point over and over again
[34:50.280 --> 34:53.400]  that islam has a problem with violence the common
[34:53.400 --> 34:56.840]  retort is always well are you saying that all muslims are
[34:56.840 --> 35:00.280]  terrorists no that would be ridiculous and that's never
[35:00.280 --> 35:04.680]  been part of the argument imagine if trump had come out and said
[35:04.680 --> 35:09.160]  what jake tapper you know clarified this as imagine if trump had come out and
[35:09.160 --> 35:13.800]  said all 1.6 billion muslims in the world hate america
[35:13.800 --> 35:18.280]  that would be a ludicrous statement no one would ever seriously try to argue
[35:18.280 --> 35:22.120]  that so why do they try and frame that as trump's
[35:22.120 --> 35:26.200]  argument why do they try and frame anyone's argument who says that
[35:26.200 --> 35:30.360]  there's a there's a violence problem with islam why do they try to frame it as
[35:30.360 --> 35:35.960]  oh why are you suggesting that all muslims are terrorists no nobody ever said that
[35:35.960 --> 35:40.200]  now marco rubio shot back with his own comments he kind of
[35:40.200 --> 35:44.520]  almost topped jake tapper for idiocy in responding
[35:44.520 --> 35:49.720]  to this narrative here's marco rubio okay i know that a lot of people find
[35:49.720 --> 35:53.160]  appeal in the things donald says because he says what people wish they could say
[35:53.160 --> 35:56.920]  the problem is presidents can't just say anything they want it has consequences
[35:56.920 --> 36:02.920]  here and around the world and so let me give you one
[36:02.920 --> 36:06.600]  two days ago i met this extraordinary couple who are on furlough because
[36:06.600 --> 36:09.880]  they're missionaries in bangladesh it's a very tough place to be a
[36:09.880 --> 36:12.760]  missionary it's muslim and they their safety and
[36:12.760 --> 36:16.440]  security and very much relies upon friendly muslims that live alongside
[36:16.440 --> 36:18.760]  them that may not convert but protect them and
[36:18.760 --> 36:22.280]  certainly look out for them and their mission field really are muslims that
[36:22.280 --> 36:26.120]  are looking to convert to christianity as well and they tell me that today they
[36:26.120 --> 36:29.320]  have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming
[36:29.320 --> 36:31.960]  out that in america leading political figures are saying
[36:31.960 --> 36:35.640]  that america doesn't like muslims so this is a real impact there is no doubt
[36:35.640 --> 36:39.320]  that radical radical islam is a danger in the world
[36:39.320 --> 36:42.360]  i can also tell you that if you go to any national cemetery especially
[36:42.360 --> 36:44.840]  arlington you're going to see crescent moons there
[36:44.840 --> 36:47.480]  you're gonna if you go anywhere in the world you're going to see american men
[36:47.480 --> 36:51.960]  and women during last night's debate
[36:51.960 --> 36:56.920]  basically trying to claim that donald trump is responsible for christians
[36:56.920 --> 37:01.240]  being unsafe in the muslim world that's what he was implying with those
[37:01.240 --> 37:05.880]  comments when we know that isis was executing christians
[37:05.880 --> 37:08.760]  long before donald trump came along as a
[37:08.760 --> 37:11.560]  presidential frontrunner when we know
[37:11.560 --> 37:16.440]  according to this recent survey released by open doors this investigation
[37:16.440 --> 37:21.080]  islamic extremism is the main source of persecution in 41 of the top 50 countries
[37:21.080 --> 37:25.560]  that is 82 of the world's persecution of christians
[37:25.560 --> 37:31.000]  is being committed by muslims so christians are unsafe in the muslim
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.840]  world not because of donald trump making comments
[37:34.840 --> 37:40.440]  but because of violent muslims persecuting and killing them
[37:40.440 --> 37:44.120]  and no my argument is not that all muslims are violent and that they're all
[37:44.120 --> 37:47.800]  persecuting christians that was never the argument in the first place
[37:47.800 --> 37:51.480]  trump's point that islam hates the west
[37:51.480 --> 37:56.520]  is in fact born out to a large degree if you look at the figures if you look at
[37:56.520 --> 38:00.680]  the polls regarding muslim attitudes to westerners
[38:00.680 --> 38:06.440]  so pew did a 2011 poll which found that muslims have a predominantly
[38:06.440 --> 38:10.760]  negative view of westerners and associated them with repugnant
[38:10.760 --> 38:14.360]  characteristics now this pretty much comes
[38:14.360 --> 38:18.280]  close to hatred if you ask me so they asked muslims in seven
[38:18.280 --> 38:23.000]  muslim countries what they thought of westerners which characteristics they
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.560]  associated with westerners 68 percent of muslims thought
[38:27.560 --> 38:32.600]  the westerners were selfish 66 percent thought they were violent
[38:32.600 --> 38:37.720]  64 percent thought they were greedy 61 percent thought they were immoral
[38:37.720 --> 38:41.400]  and 53 percent thought that westerners were
[38:41.400 --> 38:46.440]  fanatical this is a poll of muslims in the muslim world
[38:46.440 --> 38:50.280]  and overwhelmingly in those cases negative view
[38:50.280 --> 38:55.080]  towards westerners you flip that round which they did in the same poll
[38:55.080 --> 38:58.840]  they asked westerners what their view of muslims was
[38:58.840 --> 39:04.360]  with the same characteristics and in each case it was significantly less so
[39:04.360 --> 39:07.880]  westerners had a positive view of muslims in general
[39:07.880 --> 39:12.280]  whereas muslims had a negative view of westerners
[39:12.280 --> 39:17.800]  so trump is largely accurate when he argues that islam hates the west
[39:17.800 --> 39:21.800]  and that's just in those characteristics of course we can look at other polls
[39:21.800 --> 39:26.520]  we can look at things like is suicide bombing justified again this is a
[39:26.520 --> 39:31.640]  pew research poll 2013 in the palestinian
[39:31.640 --> 39:35.160]  territories 40 percent of muslims think that suicide
[39:35.160 --> 39:39.480]  bombing is justified 29 percent of egyptians think that
[39:39.480 --> 39:44.280]  suicide bombing is justified this is not a tiny minority
[39:44.280 --> 39:51.800]  afghanistan 39 percent of muslims think that suicide bombings are justified
[39:51.800 --> 39:55.400]  so it's the point i've made over and over again in my videos
[39:55.400 --> 40:01.880]  they try to spin this yarn that it's a tiny tiny fringe extreme minority
[40:01.880 --> 40:06.040]  that supports these violent and intolerant views and that advocates
[40:06.040 --> 40:13.560]  terror attacks 40 39 29 that is not a tiny minority
[40:13.560 --> 40:17.720]  that's a substantial number then you can go and look at
[40:17.720 --> 40:23.160]  polls of muslims who embrace sharia law and what they think about
[40:23.160 --> 40:26.840]  honor killings what they think about stoning women to death through adultery
[40:26.840 --> 40:31.800]  what they think about executing people who leave the religion of islam
[40:31.800 --> 40:35.880]  and we featured these polls before in fact i made videos about it
[40:35.880 --> 40:41.240]  if you look at these polls they show that frightening numbers of muslims
[40:41.240 --> 40:47.240]  advocate stoning women to death for adultery the death penalty for leaving
[40:47.240 --> 40:51.000]  islam in many of these countries and you can go and look at this i'm
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.600]  putting an article out about this which will be out shortly
[40:54.600 --> 41:00.520]  in some of these countries up to 70 80 percent of muslims who embrace sharia law
[41:00.520 --> 41:06.440]  advocate killing people for renouncing for leaving the faith of islam
[41:06.440 --> 41:11.000]  okay that is not a belief that's in line with western principles
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.080]  with western values so yes it's perfectly legitimate
[41:15.080 --> 41:19.480]  to argue that islam hates the west without
[41:19.480 --> 41:24.920]  this bizarre comeback from jake tapper well are you saying that all 1.6 billion
[41:24.920 --> 41:29.320]  muslims hate the west well no but significant numbers
[41:29.320 --> 41:33.560]  and in some cases majorities of those muslims embrace
[41:33.560 --> 41:38.120]  values and beliefs which are completely reprehensible
[41:38.120 --> 41:43.480]  and completely inconsistent with western values and western liberal
[41:43.480 --> 41:47.960]  principles that's the fact and it's not a tiny minority
[41:47.960 --> 41:51.880]  which is why now there's this whole movement amongst the new atheists and
[41:51.880 --> 41:56.520]  other people to try and start a reformation within islam
[41:56.520 --> 42:01.560]  people like ayan hersey ali ex muslims people like majeed noahs
[42:01.560 --> 42:05.560]  another ex muslim in fact he's still a muslim he's a muslim reformist
[42:05.560 --> 42:09.800]  but muslim reformists get shouted down again and again
[42:09.800 --> 42:15.240]  by largely white middle class leftists because they're intolerant in fact it
[42:15.240 --> 42:18.680]  was funny one of the most virulent regressive
[42:18.680 --> 42:23.320]  leftists abby martin started lecturing majeed noahs about
[42:23.320 --> 42:28.760]  how the term regressive leftist was just a buzzword used by neocons who are
[42:28.760 --> 42:33.880]  pro-war etc etc until majeed noahs pointed out that he
[42:33.880 --> 42:38.200]  coined the term regressive leftist so she was trying to argue that
[42:38.200 --> 42:42.440]  people who use the term regressive leftists are islamophobes
[42:42.440 --> 42:46.680]  he shot back and basically said well i'm a muslim and i coined the term in the
[42:46.680 --> 42:49.720]  first place so again we have this regressive leftist
[42:49.720 --> 42:52.920]  mantra which is implicit in jake tapper's question
[42:52.920 --> 42:57.000]  and this whole debate that if you draw attention to the fact that
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.320]  frightening numbers of muslims endorse suicide bombings
[43:01.320 --> 43:04.680]  majorities of muslims in some countries endorse
[43:04.680 --> 43:09.160]  stoning women to death for adultery for alleged adultery
[43:09.160 --> 43:13.560]  honor killings you know we've had cases in pakistan where a woman is killed for
[43:13.560 --> 43:17.160]  looking at a man twice that happened
[43:17.160 --> 43:21.800]  we had a teenager in somalia back i believe it was a couple of years ago
[43:21.800 --> 43:26.680]  uh brutal honor killing there you know beliefs where they endorse
[43:26.680 --> 43:30.440]  killing homosexuals executing people who leave the religion of islam
[43:30.440 --> 43:33.880]  these are not beliefs held by a tiny minority
[43:33.880 --> 43:39.320]  and that point is manifestly provable in the polls conducted by pew which i'm
[43:39.320 --> 43:43.160]  going to cite in this article in which i've cited in my videos
[43:43.160 --> 43:47.800]  the truth about islam and islam is not a religion of peace for which i've
[43:47.800 --> 43:51.800]  received multiple death threats because of course
[43:51.800 --> 43:55.560]  islam is a religion of peace that's why people threaten to kill you if you say
[43:55.560 --> 43:58.280]  it's not okay
[43:58.280 --> 44:02.440]  so again we we we see this narrative over and over again and now it's spilled
[44:02.440 --> 44:06.440]  out here's another article out of associated press
[44:06.440 --> 44:10.760]  dubai official warns a clash of civilizations over trump
[44:10.760 --> 44:15.240]  top security official in dubai warned friday of a clash of civilizations
[44:15.240 --> 44:18.920]  if u.s republican candidate donald trump becomes president
[44:18.920 --> 44:22.040]  the latest sign of disquiet across the middle east over the business
[44:22.040 --> 44:26.360]  business man's comments about muslims and this is lieutenant general daheem
[44:26.360 --> 44:30.120]  calphan tamim the deputy deputy chairman of police and
[44:30.120 --> 44:34.920]  general security in dubai so he's basically saying that
[44:34.920 --> 44:38.360]  donald trump's comment to what is going to stoke
[44:38.360 --> 44:43.480]  a clash of civilizations not the fact that huge numbers of muslims support
[44:43.480 --> 44:46.920]  suicide bombings no that's nothing to do with it
[44:46.920 --> 44:50.120]  not the fact that huge numbers of them support beliefs that completely
[44:50.120 --> 44:54.040]  inconsistent and incompatible with western beliefs
[44:54.040 --> 44:59.160]  that's nothing to do with it it's because donald trump made a comment
[44:59.160 --> 45:03.240]  and what's even more frightening about this is that it's not just
[45:03.240 --> 45:07.000]  reserved to muslims who are living in the muslim world in fact a
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.160]  center for security policy survey conducted last year
[45:11.160 --> 45:16.440]  found that more than half of muslims living in the united states agreed that
[45:16.440 --> 45:21.320]  quote muslims in america should have the choice of being governed according to
[45:21.320 --> 45:26.440]  sharia law so in other words all those practices i just mentioned
[45:26.440 --> 45:30.920]  stoning women to death killing homosexuals executing people who leave
[45:30.920 --> 45:35.000]  the religion of islam and a whole bunch of different
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.600]  ideas beliefs and practices in law where it's you know a woman's testimony
[45:40.600 --> 45:44.440]  a muslim woman's testimony counts for half of a man's
[45:44.440 --> 45:48.120]  it's impossible basically for a muslim woman to get divorced even if she's
[45:48.120 --> 45:51.880]  being beaten up and abused but a muslim man can get divorced
[45:51.880 --> 45:56.520]  basically just by saying i divorce you that's sharia law it's really
[45:56.520 --> 46:00.280]  progressive and trendy and liberal and it's a you know really
[46:00.280 --> 46:04.360]  hardcore feminist cause that's why they all embrace it i guess
[46:04.360 --> 46:08.200]  so this is a concern half of muslims more than half of muslims think that
[46:08.200 --> 46:12.920]  those kind of practices and beliefs that they should have the choice
[46:12.920 --> 46:17.720]  to exhibit them to express them to codify them into law in many cases
[46:17.720 --> 46:22.760]  in america it's already happening in some places of the united kingdom
[46:22.760 --> 46:27.400]  now we had another video in this the truth about islam which is on my youtube
[46:27.400 --> 46:30.920]  channel where it's basically a conference of muslims in
[46:30.920 --> 46:35.800]  norway and the speaker says he's really upset
[46:35.800 --> 46:39.160]  about the fact that the establishment media
[46:39.160 --> 46:43.240]  is framing moderate muslims as being against
[46:43.240 --> 46:46.840]  stoning women to death honor killings you know killing homosexuals
[46:46.840 --> 46:51.240]  he basically gets up and says these are the beliefs of moderate muslims
[46:51.240 --> 46:56.760]  then he takes a poll of the audience you know 200 muslim men sitting there
[46:56.760 --> 47:01.720]  Arab muslims black muslims white muslims he asked them raise your hand if you
[47:01.720 --> 47:05.560]  agree that homosexuals should be killed if you agree with stoning to
[47:05.560 --> 47:10.040]  death for adultery everyone in the house raises their hand
[47:10.040 --> 47:16.600]  and these are so-called moderate muslims so yes if you believe that those
[47:16.600 --> 47:21.720]  kind of beliefs are antagonistic and incompatible with western beliefs
[47:21.720 --> 47:25.160]  then doesn't that mean that islam hates the west
[47:25.160 --> 47:29.000]  doesn't mean that every muslim hates the west or that every muslim is a
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.080]  terrorist because donald trump has never made that argument
[47:33.080 --> 47:37.560]  nobody with any serious credibility has ever made that argument because that's
[47:37.560 --> 47:41.000]  not the argument but they try and frame it as that
[47:41.000 --> 47:44.440]  over and over again so we've got an article coming out
[47:44.440 --> 47:48.440]  on that shortly and again it's going to include this which is a
[47:48.440 --> 47:53.000]  report i put out a few weeks ago muslim refugees welcomed to canada with
[47:53.000 --> 47:58.280]  call to destroy the enemies of islam muslim refugees arriving in alberta
[47:58.280 --> 48:01.960]  canada were welcomed by a pro-isis hate preacher
[48:01.960 --> 48:06.280]  who called for the destruction of enemies of islam and pray for jihadists to
[48:06.280 --> 48:10.600]  quote hit their target this is a preacher in canada
[48:10.600 --> 48:14.920]  this is not in afghanistan it's not in pakistan it's in canada
[48:14.920 --> 48:18.360]  he's welcoming the refugees coming into canada
[48:18.360 --> 48:22.520]  by saying basically that he advocates terrorism he advocates
[48:22.520 --> 48:27.160]  he advocates jihadist attacks to destroy the enemies of islam which of course is
[48:27.160 --> 48:30.920]  the west so when donald trump says islam
[48:30.920 --> 48:34.920]  hates the west this proves that he's got a point
[48:34.920 --> 48:38.440]  and that it's not an outlier it's not a ludicrous statement
[48:38.440 --> 48:43.800]  to make and as i've made the argument many times over and over again
[48:43.800 --> 48:46.760]  it's not a tiny fringe minority of muslims that
[48:46.760 --> 48:51.560]  believe this it's a frightening number and in some cases it's a majority of
[48:51.560 --> 48:55.400]  muslims especially when you look at muslim attitudes
[48:55.400 --> 49:00.280]  to the west amongst muslims who are living in the middle east
[49:00.280 --> 49:03.880]  and on that subject we've got this article out of world net daily
[49:03.880 --> 49:07.560]  muslim migrant melts off wife's face with boiling
[49:07.560 --> 49:12.760]  oil this is the very very tolerant inclusive culture that we're importing
[49:12.760 --> 49:15.160]  into the west this is our cultural enrichment
[49:15.160 --> 49:19.640]  pouring boiling oil over women's faces because the feminists don't care about
[49:19.640 --> 49:23.320]  it too busy complaining about man spreading
[49:23.320 --> 49:27.160]  another gross violations of women's rights like that
[49:27.160 --> 49:30.920]  when homer the 48-year-old wife of muhammad pulled back the shower curtain
[49:30.920 --> 49:34.200]  after her husband told her to have a look at what he was holding
[49:34.200 --> 49:39.080]  the pot of hot boiling oil in his hands was not what she expected
[49:39.080 --> 49:41.480]  in a matter of seconds her face was gone
[49:41.480 --> 49:45.800]  melted and the right hand she raised to protect herself permanently for you
[49:45.800 --> 49:50.040]  shut she was left with burns over 44 percent of her
[49:50.040 --> 49:54.120]  body scarred forever to restore her husband's
[49:54.120 --> 49:59.800]  honor so basically the husband got jealous that she was interested in
[49:59.800 --> 50:02.840]  another man no proof that she'd even had any
[50:02.840 --> 50:06.120]  contact or sexual relations with him and of course the
[50:06.120 --> 50:09.400]  rational solution to that if you believe these
[50:09.400 --> 50:15.240]  tenants is to pour hot boiling water over that woman's face that's a completely
[50:15.240 --> 50:18.600]  reasonable response i guess you would agree
[50:18.600 --> 50:22.440]  of course not a peep from feminists nothing whatsoever
[50:22.440 --> 50:27.640]  here's another story out of Breitbart quote people like you should be shot
[50:27.640 --> 50:32.520]  muslim taxi driver beat up gay couple for kissing in his cab
[50:32.520 --> 50:36.040]  muslim taxi driver in vienna austria punched the gay man in the mouth during
[50:36.040 --> 50:40.600]  an altercation of what does and does not constitute acceptable public
[50:40.600 --> 50:43.800]  behavior that's what's happening in austria
[50:43.800 --> 50:49.960]  as part of this cultural enrichment we'll be back after the break to delve more

[53:41.640 --> 53:45.560]  that have the potential to devastate the world economy and your personal wealth

[54:07.720 --> 54:23.880]  we are back on the alex germ show this was an interesting story that came up
[54:23.880 --> 54:28.520]  yesterday of course the finger of the eagles of death metal the band involved
[54:28.520 --> 54:33.080]  in the tragic bataclan theater attack again their audience goers and the band
[54:33.080 --> 54:37.400]  were targeted during the paris massacre back in november
[54:37.400 --> 54:41.560]  of course he came out yesterday and said he suspects that the attack was an
[54:41.560 --> 54:45.000]  inside job because he noticed that many of the
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.040]  members of the security team had failed to show up
[54:48.040 --> 54:52.520]  he noticed that one of them was acting shifty refusing to look him in the eye
[54:52.520 --> 54:55.640]  obviously doesn't constitute bombshell evidence
[54:55.640 --> 54:59.400]  but i can shed some more light on this because we've got another report out of
[54:59.400 --> 55:05.000]  the local radicalization among police a growing concern for france
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.760]  elite memo has revealed that not even the french police is spared
[55:08.760 --> 55:11.880]  from the phenomenon of radicalization or fundamentalism
[55:11.880 --> 55:15.320]  with a number of cases highlighted in recent years
[55:15.320 --> 55:19.560]  so they're seeing a lot of cases in france now where the police officers
[55:19.560 --> 55:24.760]  these muslim police officers will refuse to stand god outside a synagogue
[55:24.760 --> 55:30.040]  will refuse to observe minute silences and it's becoming a real concern
[55:30.040 --> 55:35.080]  the perisian newspaper which revealed the elite memo claimed the
[55:35.080 --> 55:38.840]  officers were identified for acts such as refusing to stand god outside a
[55:38.840 --> 55:41.800]  synagogue refusing to suspect respect to minix
[55:41.800 --> 55:44.600]  silence one officer even put our call on facebook
[55:44.600 --> 55:48.520]  a call to murder on facebook which landed him in court the perisian
[55:48.520 --> 55:52.360]  claimed the newspaper claimed police in paris were now recording
[55:52.360 --> 55:57.800]  transgressions on a weekly basis so they've got a huge problem
[55:57.800 --> 56:02.120]  with potential islamists getting jobs in the police force
[56:02.120 --> 56:05.080]  and then allowing their beliefs to overshadow
[56:05.080 --> 56:09.880]  their job basically so the claim that some of these security guards which
[56:09.880 --> 56:14.120]  i mean this is essentially what the death the eagles of death metal singer is
[56:14.120 --> 56:17.480]  arguing that they may have been jihadists
[56:17.480 --> 56:22.440]  in on the plot in on the massacre that gives that claim a little more
[56:22.440 --> 56:25.640]  credibility from the comments that i've read he's not
[56:25.640 --> 56:29.320]  you know trying to claim that the french government itself was responsible
[56:29.320 --> 56:32.440]  for an inside job he's claiming that there could have been
[56:32.440 --> 56:37.480]  islamist jihadists on the inside who got jobs working as security at the
[56:37.480 --> 56:41.560]  batter clan who maybe helped facilitate the attack
[56:41.560 --> 56:45.160]  but not a great deal of evidence to back up those claims so far of course the
[56:45.160 --> 56:47.480]  batter clan have come out forcefully and
[56:47.480 --> 56:51.000]  denied them basically said his comments are defamatory
[56:51.000 --> 56:56.440]  so we'll definitely keep track of that one the archbishop one of the top
[56:56.440 --> 57:00.600]  archbishop the archbishop of canterbury in england has declared that
[57:00.600 --> 57:05.640]  it's not racist to fear migration he's committed the thought crime of saying
[57:05.640 --> 57:09.640]  that people who have concerns about millions of
[57:09.640 --> 57:14.120]  individuals pouring into the west aren't necessarily racist
[57:14.120 --> 57:18.280]  britains have a justified fear of mass immigration the archbishop of canterbury
[57:18.280 --> 57:21.400]  has declared justin wellby said it was absolutely
[57:21.400 --> 57:25.160]  outrageous to condemn people who raise concerns about the influx of large
[57:25.160 --> 57:28.760]  numbers of migrants as racist he said the scale of europe's
[57:28.760 --> 57:34.680]  migrant crisis meant such anxieties were entirely reasonable
[57:34.680 --> 57:39.480]  now we have police in sweden being forced to defend a warning that women
[57:39.480 --> 57:42.120]  don't go out at night of course sweden is one of the
[57:42.120 --> 57:45.880]  countries that has reaped the benefits of this cultural
[57:45.880 --> 57:50.280]  enrichment with its 1400 percent rape increase
[57:50.280 --> 57:54.200]  and now the police are telling women in certain areas of sweden not to go out
[57:54.200 --> 57:57.560]  at night police in ostosund in northern sweden have
[57:57.560 --> 58:01.000]  warned women about being out on their own after dark but the city's
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.520]  mayors trashed the idea officers in ostosund first
[58:04.520 --> 58:07.320]  advised women not to walk around on their own at night during the press
[58:07.320 --> 58:10.520]  conference on monday and now basically there's a huge
[58:10.520 --> 58:14.840]  backlash against it even the feminists are starting to speak out against it but
[58:14.840 --> 58:18.680]  again they're not identifying why this is a problem
[58:18.680 --> 58:22.840]  it's because of these waves of people have no respect for women whatsoever
[58:22.840 --> 58:27.400]  in denmark they're having to put them through sexual consent courses
[58:27.400 --> 58:31.720]  and it's really not working we'll be back in the next segment it's the alex

[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:22.440]  show remember when 2009 nobel peace prize
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:26.280]  winner president barack obama bragged to his age that he is
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.560]  really good at killing people in the book
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:35.000]  double down while discussing drone strikes well just how good is he
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.920]  obama has managed to kill innocent civilians in afghanistan
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:42.680]  with a 90 success rate and according to the bureau of
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:47.080]  investigative journalism obama's cia drone strikes have killed
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.760]  children and our commander in chief has bragged about it
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:55.240]  the next time some liberal rattles on about how great obama is
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:00.120]  remind them of this horrifying statistic and now the pentagon has finally
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.480]  issued a report made public by a foyer request
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.400]  stating that unmanned military aircraft have been deployed
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:13.640]  on non-military missions that have occurred fewer than 20 times between 2006
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:18.680]  and 2015 and always in compliance with existing law
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:23.000]  back in 2013 we caught a glimpse of the use of military drones in the united
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.120]  states when then fbi director robert muhler
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:31.080]  testified before congress our foot foot foot print is very small
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:35.320]  we have very few and of limited use and we're exploring
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:39.800]  not only the use but also the necessary
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:46.440]  guidelines for that use does the fbi use drones for surveillance on u.s. soil
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:50.040]  yes the recent revelations of the robbery of liberty
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:54.120]  for supposed security by an out-of-control myriad of federal

[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.480]  department document obtained by mbc news in 2004
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.920]  revealed the pentagon's increased domestic spying activity
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:10.440]  on anti-war groups following the 9-11 attacks
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:15.560]  the cia also spied on and subverted the anti-war movement with its operation
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:21.000]  chaos in the late 1960s additionally the agency covertly launched project
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.800]  marama to infiltrate and subvert domestic
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:30.120]  political groups despite the cia charter forbidding such activity in 2012
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.680]  info wars dot com reported on obama's environmental protection agency
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.440]  using aerial drones to spy on farmers and cattle ranchers
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:43.080]  in nebraska in iowa the surveillance came under scrutiny after nebraska's
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.280]  congressional delegation sent a joint letter to epa
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:51.400]  administrator lisa jackson the epa argued the flights are legal
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:56.120]  jackson said courts including the supreme court have found similar types of
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.640]  flights to be legal and epa would use such flights in
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.240]  appropriate instances to protect people and the environment from
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:08.200]  violations of the clean water act oh and what a stellar job the epa is doing
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.960]  as is evident in durango colorado and flint michigan
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:16.040]  despite the fact the posse comet otis act prohibits the military from operating
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.320]  on american soil the pentagon has busied itself with
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:23.000]  establishing drone bases within the united states public

[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:38.600]  according to the organization it is not clear if the bases are used for foreign
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:43.160]  missions or domestic surveillance a list produced by the federal aviation
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.760]  administration in response to an electronic freedom foundation

[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:04.360]  group of 45 us military veterans have signed a letter
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:08.920]  appealing to pilots responsible for carrying out deadly aerial military
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.280]  drone strikes in countries like syria afghanistan
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:16.200]  iraq and pakistan to stand down and deliberately
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.360]  refused to carry out their orders the letter was submitted to us media
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.640]  outlets by anti drone group no drones
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.960]  pleading with drone pilots to refuse to fly surveillance and kill missions
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:33.720]  it's as clear as the nose on your face the level of treason required to ignore
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:38.280]  the constitution your fellow americans rights and basic

[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:34.120]  welcome to the alex jones show on this friday march 11th 2016 i'm david night
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:38.040]  here in austin austin has been turned upside down not
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.560]  only do we have south by southwest opening today
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.680]  but president obama decided he would make things a little bit more unbearable
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.280]  for us here in austin by showing up for south by southwest and of course michelle
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:51.800]  is going to be coming on a second different visit at some point in the
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.760]  next 10 days here's how this is playing out you know
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.440]  whenever we have an event that the government gets involved in they always
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:02.040]  step up security to an even more absurd level than it was the time
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:07.720]  before every event has to be clamped down
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:11.720]  more tightly what's going on now and we got a story up on info wars.com
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:16.200]  earlier this week the secret service visited the 360 tower in austin texas
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.800]  told the management that residents of the building will not be allowed
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:24.360]  to access to their balconies during obama's visit to the city on friday so
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.560]  you know if you've got a you live in an apartment in the city you've got a
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:31.480]  balcony stay off of your balcony get inside
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:34.280]  the next thing they'll be doing is demanding that we close our curtains as
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:38.920]  well so we do not gaze upon the anointed one as he goes past us
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.600]  this is the kind of total paranoia that the
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:46.440]  police state continues to ramp up and yet they can't be concerned enough about
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.360]  security real security to lock up hillary clinton
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:56.440]  when she conspires to put top secret documents on her private server and lie
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.960]  about it come on the national security state
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:03.480]  religion here where you can't even walk out on your balcony
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.600]  as the motorcade is distantly passing away okay
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.400]  you have to stay in your apartment the next thing they're going to do is going
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:13.160]  to tell people uh there'll be some secret service agents by about an hour
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.720]  before the president comes by they're going to tie you to your chair and
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:19.880]  blindfold you as well okay i mean this is getting
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:23.320]  beyond belief and so that's what's going on in austin right now it's very
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.600]  difficult to get around uh we're going to uh
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.480]  be reporting on this we've got our reporters on the street
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:33.320]  and of course we have uh the brokered convention has already started
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:37.160]  did you know that you know i always talk about the brokered convention but it
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:42.040]  started folks you've got uh jeb bush meeting in secret with rubio
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.880]  kasek cruz before the debate plotting on what they're going to do to donald
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.440]  trump you know was reported in the mainstream media well it's not clear
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.120]  if there's going to be an endorsement at this time from jeb bush what come on
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:56.200]  that's not the tack they're taking they are conspiring to
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:00.200]  i mean he wouldn't meet with uh trump of course he knows he's not going to get a
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.080]  an appointment from trump trump would just look at him and say
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:07.640]  jeb you're a mess and he would be right but of course they're going to
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:11.640]  you know do these uh backroom deals i can just imagine what's going on this
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:15.320]  is arm twisting incentives being handed out
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.160]  i think that the bushes and this movement behind
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:25.000]  cruz you saw first you saw brother neil come in as his finance manager
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.720]  uh if you're not questioning the judgment and the integrity of ted cruz
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:33.560]  that should do it right there in and of itself neil bush
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:37.880]  whose sole accomplishment is to be the pen
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:42.120]  that created the s and l that burst the s and l bubble okay with his fraud
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:46.520]  with his crony connections coming in and using the people that he knows to get
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:51.080]  a two and a half million dollar loan and then they find out that this
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:54.600]  company that he got the loan on has nothing but a worthless oil lease that
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.680]  he paid that the company paid neil bush a hundred thousand
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.640]  hundred fifty thousand been a while since i looked at the numbers on that but
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:06.760]  it was fraudulent okay it kicked off the biggest financial crisis that we had
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:10.280]  until his brother became president
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:14.040]  not that that was solely the fault of george w bush but you know what the
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.840]  buck stops there folks nevertheless so we've got neil bush
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:25.560]  getting behind uh and coming on board with ted cruz as a finance advisor
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.960]  uh between that and goldman sacks and these other people and then hiding his
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.280]  loans maybe neil is going to show him how to
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.920]  how to hide the finances so the people can't find it i don't know but that
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.680]  happens in the next day we find that also jeb is meeting with all the
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:45.800]  candidates except trump now when we look at some of the
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.480]  people who are doing endorsements we've had a lot of endorsements we've had
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.920]  ben karson today endorsing donald trump we're going to talk about what's
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.600]  behind that uh chuck norris endorsing ted cruz
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:01.000]  that didn't happen that was widely reported he was supposed to be at one of
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.640]  the events and then they had to walk that back
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:07.320]  chuck norris made it clear he's not endorsing ted cruz or anybody for that
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:11.000]  matter and then the strangest endorsement of all
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.400]  marco rubio has endorsed john casick in ohio
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.400]  hmm how's that yeah so you gotta stop trump
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:23.240]  by any means okay that's what these guys are doing they're plotting
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:27.320]  on how they're going to stop trump and jeb thinks that he can be
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.640]  the guy in charge of this he can make a deal let's all
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.240]  call us behind cruz we can do this kind of brokered thing
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:39.320]  and you know what uh i'm sure that he's when he meets with ted cruz
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:44.280]  what he's telling cruz is what you've got the um uh the cruz media people like
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:47.560]  mark levin saying ted cruz is a reincarnation of ronald
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:51.160]  reagan you know what if if you believe that you're
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:54.840]  the low information voter you know ted cruz went out and told people
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:14:01.560]  uh that he opined that trump supporters are low information voters
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:06.040]  you know if you believe that ted cruz is a conservative and not a neocon
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.280]  you may be a low information voter you may also be a low information voter if
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:15.000]  you think ted cruz is an outsider he is the ultimate insider
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.760]  he is has been inside the bush administration for a long time he and
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:22.520]  heide bragg that they were the first bush marriage they were both
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.720]  insiders throughout the bush organization they have both
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:31.080]  been neocons part of the establishment that pushes war all the time they were
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.680]  in the bush administration then when he decided that he wanted to run
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.760]  as a president you know first he is this obsequious
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:43.080]  greasy oily little guy that is working his way through the bureaucracy and then
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.760]  he gets elected senator after he becomes senator
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:50.520]  he starts climbing over the backs of the senators that's why they hate him so
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:53.240]  much immediately begins running for president
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:56.200]  okay he's uh gone through what is it three four
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.640]  i guess it was three years into his term uh he was already
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.240]  openly running for president he started running for president right away
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:08.360]  last december the national review was calling him on the carpet for throwing
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:12.040]  the term neocon around they said that's a toxic term
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.840]  it's radioactive it's an epithet it's pejorative
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:21.080]  it's a dog whistle to his supporters yeah it was it was a dog whistle to his
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:24.440]  supporters that was how he was going to create
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:32.920]  his bona fides as a uh as a uh got my phone gone off here hang on a second
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:39.080]  um sorry about that folks the uh that was his bona fide
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:43.080]  that was the way that he was going to tell everybody that he was an outsider
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:47.400]  and of course it was a national review which is the
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:52.280]  the magazine uh on record of the uh neocon movement
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:55.880]  that called him on the carpet for it now we see the very people who are out
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:58.520]  there saying you're using a dog whistle you're throwing
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:02.120]  people on the bus you're calling us warmongers those same warmongers people
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:05.960]  like john bolton and others now are his close advisors
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:09.800]  so if you look at the people who are lining up behind
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:13.880]  ted cruise you understand the guy is not a conservative he's neocon he's not an
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:18.280]  outsider he is the ultimate insider and he is part of the bush family of course
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.800]  the uh the statement that roger stone gave us
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:24.840]  when he during the interview talking about how ted cruise is a bush by another
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.960]  name he wrote an op-ed piece that appeared in the daily caller
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:32.520]  pointing out the same issues here's the way that i think jeb bush is selling
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:36.520]  this to ted cruise i think what he's telling him is look
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:40.760]  you know we have constructed uh this image of you as the second coming of
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:44.280]  ronald reagan you're going to get the christians and the
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:48.280]  conservatives like ronald reagan did what i can do is i can bring you jeb will
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:52.360]  say i can bring you the moderates and the gop establishment just like my
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:56.760]  father did to ronald reagan or we can oppose you and take you down
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:00.280]  we can make you king or we can take you down i think that's what's going on i
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:03.480]  think that's what's happening with the uh bush brothers and of course an
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:07.320]  interesting comment from ted cruise about florida well actually it wasn't
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:12.440]  from the cruise campaign it was by a super pack uh that is supporting
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:16.120]  uh ted cruise and they are pulling out of florida
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.480]  they said they're not going to be running ads in florida they said uh we've done
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:24.200]  an analysis and it looks like marco rubio can lose their all by himself
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:28.120]  now if marco rubio loses all by himself it becomes very difficult for trump to go
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:32.360]  forward if uh john casick uh loses even in his home
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:35.720]  state since he hasn't won anything anywhere at all
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:39.400]  it becomes very difficult for him to move forward this article uh very
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:42.600]  interesting pat cadel says when trump finds out the
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:46.520]  casick voted for nafta casick will lose ohio
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.760]  you hear that donald he voted for nafta and of course
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:54.440]  when i cut the piece talking to bernie sanders supporters
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:58.680]  about why if hillary clinton becomes a nominee they might really want to think
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:03.560]  about supporting uh donald trump rather than hillary clinton
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:08.040]  pointing out that look on so many different issues uh on opposing the fed
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:13.800]  on opposing the trade treaties for dracroni capitalism on opposing nafta
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:17.720]  most people on the left huffington post rest they understand they did studies
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:21.800]  they've looked at this they've looked at the the massive outflow of jobs
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:25.560]  now of course the leadership of the democrat party
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:28.680]  like hillary clinton and the super delegates they want to see this go
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.920]  through they want to run this through just like
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:35.640]  ted cruz's supporters and ted cruz has written op-ed pieces as well we're
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:39.560]  going to tell you about that uh he wrote op-ed pieces
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.240]  with paul ryan talking about how the tpp
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:47.640]  needed to be run through and again you may be a low information
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:51.480]  voter if you think that ted cruz is a constitutionalist
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:56.280]  over and beyond the eligibility issue the very fact that he would subvert the
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:01.880]  constitution in support of the tpa and he voted for it before he voted against it
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.200]  uh when he voted against it they didn't need his vote but he had already written
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:11.080]  op-ed pieces with paul ryan saying how they needed to run through the tpp
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:16.120]  that is why senator sessions did not endorse him but endorsed
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:20.760]  donald trump because he understands he's the only one of all the senators
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:23.720]  who went through and looked at that i was very disappointed
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:27.240]  that uh even ran paul did not go through and look at the
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:30.920]  tpp he opposed it consistently opposed it opposed
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:36.920]  the tpa but of course ted cruz is now telling us that he doesn't support it
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.880]  when in fact he wrote op-ed pieces in support of it
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:43.880]  and saying that we're going to get rid of the constitutional process
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.160]  for approving treaties why would you have the tpa
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.160]  if so you can get this through because you know you don't have 67 senators stay

[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.960]  available for you and give you a 10 discount.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:38.520]  Now as I was saying in the last segment it's really bizarre we've now seen that
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:42.200]  Marco Rubio's campaign is urging supporters in Ohio
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:47.880]  to back John Kasich he says if you're a republican primary voter in Ohio you
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:52.040]  don't want Donald Trump to be the nominee John Kasich is your best bet
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:55.400]  but that's really strange okay but maybe that was something that came out of
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:59.160]  the little secret meetings that John Kasich and
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:03.720]  Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio had with Jeb Bush as I said
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:07.400]  the brokered convention has already started folks you've got the bush
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:10.760]  family that completely owns Ted Cruz that's where his
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:15.320]  career began we've got the bushes now falling in line behind him
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:18.840]  and they're doing their little Machiavellian gameplays here
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:22.200]  telling people but you know I don't really think it's going to work out
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:25.880]  you know Rubio really doesn't have that much
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:30.120]  influence with people and I think once they find out about John Kasich in
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:34.120]  Ohio there's been
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:40.760]  so many jobs lost to NAFTA in Ohio and that's what's causing people who are
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:45.240]  Democrats blue-collar workers to re-register and cross over and vote for
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:48.520]  Donald Trump Reagan had about 13 percent
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:52.120]  blue-collar Democrat voters who crossed over for him right now for Donald
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:55.320]  Trump it's about 10 percent that are doing that
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:59.080]  and as Pat Caddell one of the pollsters said
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.520]  on television he said hey somebody should go back and do some
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:06.680]  research on John Kasich and see if he voted for NAFTA he was in Congress at
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:09.560]  that time I bet he voted for NAFTA and he goes
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:12.680]  boy if he did and Donald Trump gets a hold of that
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:16.120]  it's over for John Kasich well guess what
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.920]  Breitbart carried the story they went back they looked at it and they said
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:23.080]  yeah Kasich did in fact vote for NAFTA in 1993
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:27.400]  while a congressman during a January GOP debate as well he declared
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:31.800]  I'm a free trader let's understand this is not about free trade folks this is
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.880]  about managed trade if you had bothered to read the
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:40.200]  trade agreement as a senator sessions dead and tried to explain to those who
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:43.480]  were in the Senate and voted to ram this thing through without any
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:47.640]  amendments without any debate without any
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:51.320]  any kind of delay whatsoever it has to go to the floor
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:55.480]  once it's sent by the president within a certain period of time
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:00.440]  there can be no debate no uh full of busters nothing it's going to be voted
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:05.240]  on within that certain period of time and it doesn't need the 67 votes that a
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:08.200]  treaty needs to have they've taken it down to a simple
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:11.400]  majority if you'd bother to look at this you would know
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:14.440]  that it's not about free trade it's about managed trade
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:18.360]  these rules as complicated as they are are not going to apply it is a living
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:22.200]  document as senator sessions said there will be an international commission
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:26.280]  that is not elected not accountable to anybody in America
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:29.640]  they will decide what the trade deals are going to be that means that they
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:33.400]  manage our economy and we have seen how this works out
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.600]  haven't we we were lied to we were told that we're going to get a lot of jobs
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:40.840]  out of NAFTA we lost a million jobs we lost a trillion
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:45.960]  dollars in trade deficits just to Mexico you look at these massive trade
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:48.920]  deficits that we've had with Mexico immediately after
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:53.240]  and continuing to increase but there goes on he says well I supported NAFTA
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.600]  he admitted it case it dead back in january in the debate
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:03.000]  he says I believe in the PTT the PTT now that's a low information candidate
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.200]  there he doesn't even know that it's the TPP
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:11.000]  he doesn't know enough about it maybe he just designate maybe somebody told him
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.440]  that it's free trade and he thinks that free trade is a good idea I think free
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:18.520]  trade is a good idea Ron Paul said he likes free trade
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:23.960]  Ron Paul said NAFTA is not free trade you don't need thousands of pages of
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:27.160]  managed trade to have free trade you just have a free market
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:30.360]  this is called a free market yeah I'm all for free markets
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:34.520]  but I'm not for managed trade and I'm not for being a sucker
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:38.840]  and these guys have absolutely no idea what the China price is when Donald
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:41.720]  Trump talks about manipulating currency their eyes glaze over
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:45.800]  and they make fun of him stay with us to be right back
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:51.720]  we're on the march the empire's on the run
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:56.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:30:00.360]  where do you go to leave your legacy
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:03.800]  well if you're president Barack Obama you go to South by Southwest
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:07.880]  that's right in addition to the 200,000 workers and guests and attendees who
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:11.480]  will be filling up the Austin downtown area Barack Obama's going to show up
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:15.400]  with his giant secret service detail of course in addition to tying up traffic
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:19.160]  as Kit Daniels covered even the mayor of Austin is warning people to stay home
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:23.400]  on Friday as the president's visit is sure to tie up traffic for hours on end
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:27.080]  he will also be utilizing state police and local police resources
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:30.680]  which could be used during South by Southwest he'll be making two stops
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:34.040]  one at the Long Center for Performing Arts to give a speech and then jumping
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:37.080]  across the river to attend a fundraiser at Austin Music Hall
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:41.000]  and then it's on to a private fundraiser at the home of Amy and Kirk Rudy
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  local developers here it was Amy Rudy who approached a local Austin City
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.120]  Council member after he voted against awarding a 37 million
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:51.880]  dollar tax rebate to her husband's company and said don't f with my husband
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:55.160]  and she repeated it twice these are the kind of people Obama hangs out with

[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.000]  something to say about what happened in oregon with the shooting of the boy
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.760]  finnican we saw that video absolutely amazing to me
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:50.280]  that the government can continually whether it's in the city or whether it's
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:54.920]  in the country execute people you get it on tape and
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:57.880]  they just get away with it the only thing the fbi seems to be concerned about
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:01.400]  is they didn't report accurately the number of shots they took
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:07.480]  really you murder a man you attempt to murder three other people and a vehicle
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:11.080]  and the only thing they're concerned about is accurately reporting the number
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:16.360]  of shots that were fired absolutely amazing the number is 800 259 9231
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:21.640]  800 259 9231 there is some good news coming out of new hampshire
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:25.080]  there's always good news coming out of new hampshire seems like if you believe
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:28.120]  in liberty on march 10th that's yesterday the new hampshire house of
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:32.040]  representatives voted in favor of considering a measure
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:36.680]  codifying jury nullification as part of that state's criminal procedure that
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:41.800]  is one of my favorite uh freedom things to do here is
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:44.520]  jury nullification we've got to get people to understand
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:47.640]  what jury nullification is about we have to get people to
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:51.560]  understand what their right is as a juror what their duty
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:56.200]  is as a juror you know nancy reagan's funeral was today she was famous for
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:59.160]  just saying no well you know we need to just say no
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:02.520]  to government tyranny and the best way we can do that
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:06.600]  is as a juror that was what it was designed for now
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:10.120]  in the past they've had a movement in new hampshire
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:13.720]  they were successful in getting a law passed there that said that the judges
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:17.720]  could not punish lawyers for telling jurors about jury
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:21.720]  nullification because it's part of the law i mean jury nullification not
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:24.680]  not just that telling them about it is part of the law but that jury
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:28.920]  nullification itself is a long established legal tradition
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:33.000]  is what juries are there for they're not there just to judge the facts of the
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.040]  case as a matter of fact in this article from the new american
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:40.440]  they have a quote here from the very first supreme court justice
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:45.800]  he says uh on questions of facts that's of the province of the jury on
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:49.400]  questions of law is the province of the court in other words the judge to
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:53.880]  decide but he said it must be observed that by the same
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:57.640]  law which recognizes the reasonable distribution of jurisdiction
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:02.040]  you have nevertheless a right to take upon yourself to judge
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:06.920]  both to determine the law as well as the fact in controversy
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:11.160]  this is what the supreme court justice told a jury
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:15.320]  in 1794 and of course that was the way all the founders understood this
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.520]  and this article from new american new hampshire house to consider
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:22.920]  codifying jury nullification they go through the long tradition of this the
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:27.480]  quotes from people who were both federalists and anti-federalists talking
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:32.200]  about how important this was now that is a longstanding tradition at some
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:36.120]  point in time our government decided they didn't want juries to be
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:40.440]  to know that they have that right they wanted to lie to people and shut down
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:43.960]  during the nullification they will try to keep you off of the
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:47.560]  jury if you are open about the fact that you
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:50.920]  believe in jury nullification if you start talking about it as part of
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:54.440]  deliberations they will remove you from the jury in many cases
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:57.720]  there's some judges that won't do that but most will and if a lawyer talks
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:01.000]  about it for his defendant they will try to disbar him so
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.600]  they stopped that in the earlier law in new hampshire
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:08.440]  now this is a law that would mandate
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:12.120]  quote the court shall inform the jury of its right
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:15.960]  to judge the facts and the application of the law
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:19.720]  in relation to the facts and controversy so
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:22.920]  for example you're going to send somebody somebody to
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:28.360]  jail for a mandatory minimum of 10 20 years because they had a small amount
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:32.440]  of pot that they were growing in their closet
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:35.800]  then the jury might look at that and say you know yeah he's doing that he wasn't
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:38.600]  hurting anybody and that's a ridiculous sentence so
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:42.200]  we're going to find him not guilty just to make sure that this doesn't go
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:45.800]  through and i think that's a very very important thing
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:49.720]  for us to understand we need to start this movement in other states as well
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:53.720]  and of course as i mentioned the other day briefly there is a move afoot in
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:57.240]  arizona that would stop the enforcement of
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:00.600]  unconstitutional laws by state representatives we've seen
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:03.800]  that introduced in another number of states and that is something that needs
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:06.760]  to be propagated as well there's a lot that we can do
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:11.560]  to cut off the tyranny of washington besides elect a president
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:14.760]  and that's why i think it's you know when i look at the candidates that are
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:18.360]  there rand paul had been very good in terms of
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.560]  explain to people the libertarian point of view
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:24.840]  to explain to people the importance of individual liberty the importance of the
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:28.840]  bill of rights we don't have a candidate that understands that
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:32.520]  ted cruz says he does and i don't believe that he does
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.280]  because i've seen him move in too many ways changing his
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:42.920]  statement he used to say that he supported ed snowden as an important
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:47.000]  whistleblower now he thinks he's a traitor implies he should be executed
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.240]  and of course his advisor wolsey came out and said that
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:55.480]  james wolsey who is his advisor somebody who is a clinton administration
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:59.480]  appointee uh to the cia somebody who is a
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:03.160]  leader and many neocon groups is called for the execution
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:06.920]  of ed snowden and he is a close advisor to ted cruz
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:10.920]  so if you look at his advisors as we pointed out
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:14.920]  this is a curtain memo story going back to february the men behind ted cruz
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:20.280]  neocons and a cia propagandas the way the new american put it ted cruz's closest
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:23.960]  counselors are neocons i would say maybe his closet
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:31.960]  counselors are neocons so he pulls these guys in as his closest advisors
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:35.800]  keeping them under the carpet while he publicly trashes
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:39.720]  their policies while he publicly trashes quote unquote neocons
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:43.400]  he brings in the leaders of the neocons
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:47.160]  okay and that's the way he is on every issue is
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:50.840]  curtain memo summed up back in february said ted cruz is not even remotely a
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:55.480]  libertarian he is a neocon masquerading as a champion of liberty
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:59.000]  if nominated and elected he will continue the forever war agenda
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.920]  it was initiated by the bush regime a regime that he was part of
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:06.600]  folks he and his wife and he will further expand
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:10.200]  the high tech surveillance police state because he's doing that to his supporters
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:14.600]  right now he profiles his supporters to a level
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:17.480]  two of detail that nobody has ever done before
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:20.840]  and then he tells them precisely what he knows they want to hear
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:24.840]  okay and that's what he's going to do if he becomes president now there's another
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:28.760]  closet issue that kind of bears i think on the fact that
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:35.400]  ben carson endorsed donald trump today and this was uh not too long ago this
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:38.600]  was back in uh about a month ago about february
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:42.920]  19th this came out as one of the debates was happening cruz and
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:49.320]  carson held a secret meeting about ted cruz's dirty tricks in a closet
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:52.120]  and the daily beast had a lot of fun with this of course because this is
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:55.960]  there a uh a democrat publication i said two grown men running for president
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:58.280]  met in a storage closet last night the two huddled
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:01.560]  in the unusual venue for nearly 20 to 25 minutes
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:05.880]  as secret service stood outside according to a republican office
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:09.240]  operative who witnessed the strange scene this was
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:16.920]  ted cruz trying to explain to ben carson why they lied about him
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.440]  in iowa and the iowa caucus so when everybody knows the story
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:25.080]  except that most people don't know the true story about the time sequence that
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:29.320]  was there you see not only did they say
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:33.400]  that ben carson was dropping out and the caucuses what they were
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:37.000]  what they said afterwards was well who knew i mean there was this
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  cnn article that came out they tweeted about it and it really wasn't clear so
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.600]  you know uh we were just mistaken after they
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:48.280]  had been doing that for an hour in reality the tweet that they were
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:52.440]  referring to that they used to propagate this lie to stab ben
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:56.280]  carson in the back in iowa where he had the best chance to get off the ground
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:59.720]  they squashed him before he got off the ground that was about
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:04.440]  20 minutes before the caucuses started and it was immediately tweeted out
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:08.280]  by the cnn reporter who did it he said and oh by the way yeah he is going to
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:11.560]  florida he's not sticking around but he made it clear
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:14.680]  that he's going back although he's going back to his home he is not dropping
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:17.800]  out of the race no matter what the outcome is and those
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:21.160]  came out virtually simultaneously 20 minutes before
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:25.240]  the caucus began and then the ted cruz people
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:29.240]  who want to tell us that they are the face of god
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:34.440]  to america see that that's the other thing that concerns me about him and
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:37.960]  that is the public display of piety and of course there's a lot of
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:40.680]  articles that are linked at the top of the drudge report
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:45.160]  about this how they believe that he is the one who is anointed that god has
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:48.760]  spoken to him through the holy spirit telling them that he is going to be the
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:52.440]  next president of the united states and then i saw this
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:55.960]  article on the daily mail and i thought at first maybe it was about
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:00.200]  ted cruz a christian prophet has his buttocks mauled by a lion
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:04.360]  after running toward a pride to prove the lord's power over animals during a
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:09.080]  south african safari maybe ted cruz is about to get his
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.760]  buttocks mauled in this next election on tuesday
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:16.200]  in this particular case this is literally what happens and this is why
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:20.040]  as christians we need to when we start thinking that we're
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:24.200]  getting guidance from god we need to kind of check
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:27.080]  and see if that isn't that little voice that we hear
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:31.480]  isn't our pride telling us something in this particular case they say a church
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:35.800]  leader had his buttocks mauled by a lion after running toward a pride
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:39.000]  how's that for irony a little bit of pride there and a bit
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.040]  and a bid to prove the lord's power over animals he said to have fallen into a
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:45.720]  trance start speaking in tongues before charging at a pride of lions
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:49.240]  feeding on an impala he said as he spread toward them the
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:55.640]  lions immediately viewed him as prey and they zeroed in on him realizing his mistake
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:59.240]  he turned his back and ran back toward the car but not before one of the lions
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:03.560]  clamped down on his buttocks and looking back on this looking
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:06.920]  back on the lion pride looking back on his pride
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:10.600]  and how his prayers turned him into prey he said
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:14.200]  i do not know what came over me i thought the lord wanted me
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:17.560]  wanted to use me to show his power over animals is it not that we were given
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:20.360]  dominion over all the creatures of the earth well
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:25.560]  take a look at genesis three pastor and you'll understand what happened with the
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:28.760]  fall and i would guess when you look at these
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:32.760]  articles at the top of the drudge report that maybe ted Cruz is looking at
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:36.840]  what's going on he's saying uh is this uh what was i not
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:40.520]  anointed and given power to have dominion over
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:44.760]  america like maybe not ted maybe not maybe it's not your time
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:48.920]  maybe you're misreading that maybe that's uh your own interpretation
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:53.000]  let's go to frank in north carolina frank
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:57.080]  okay yeah david thanks for taking my call hey i'm
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:01.720]  i'm gonna ask this question and this is serious it's not tongue-in-cheek
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:06.040]  uh i was i've been thinking that someone maybe needs to
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:10.680]  put forth the question to donald trump
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:15.480]  how should his his supporters respond
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:23.160]  in the event of his untimely demise uh should it be under
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:26.760]  if it if it were to happen and it it's obviously under
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:32.200]  questionable suspicious circumstances i would like to see him respond to that
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:36.040]  what should because you know i mean you're talking about a hornet's nest
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:41.880]  out here oh yeah and uh well you know i i would like to see him answer that
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:46.120]  well you know it washington and and and government in general
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:50.840]  is a mafia i mean we just had the former the founder of rt
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:54.760]  beaten to death in washington suspicion falls upon the russian government
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:57.400]  perhaps uh because he used to be an ally of
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:01.720]  putin now he's a critic of putin you know the bottom line is at his very best
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:05.160]  even if the government is not shooting at citizens down in the streets like
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:09.480]  little boy fenicum uh they are still a protection racket
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:11.880]  in the sense that they come to you and they say
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:16.680]  you know what pay me some money and nothing bad will happen to you you know
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:19.720]  i wouldn't want you to have some kind of an accident you know like the guys the
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:22.760]  mafia shakes down people in the restaurant you know it'd be a shame if
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:26.680]  something were to happen to this nice place okay they're not that
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:30.360]  tactful about it they just get in your face and threaten you so
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:33.800]  basically they're they're taking your money uh they're saying that you need
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:37.480]  to be protected but the reality is that the biggest threat to you is the
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:40.600]  government it's not some kind of a foreign bogeyman
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:44.200]  it's your own government that's most likely to kill you and yeah we have seen
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:48.200]  that multiple times we have had many people that have been on the show that
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:54.360]  alex has talked to the dc madame uh gary webb uh who then
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:58.520]  were we were told committed suicide and in all these cases they had absolutely
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:00.760]  no reason to commit suicide they were in a great
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:07.160]  frame of mind they even said no alex even asked uh the dc madame and i believe
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:10.360]  maybe gary webb as well you know you're not planning on committing suicide are
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:13.240]  you make sure you get that no man i'm feeling great things are turning
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:17.880]  you know i've got a lot of stuff in the fire uh everything is looking good and
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:22.040]  then in a couple of days they are uh
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:26.760]  suicided so i don't know really uh what he would do i i think that he doesn't
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:30.280]  want to probably respond to that because remember that didn't work out too well
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:35.960]  for ross perot uh people portrayed him as paranoid and uh
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:41.400]  afraid of the bushes you know if there's somebody to be afraid of you would
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:45.400]  want to be afraid of the bushes remember george bush going like this okay
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:48.920]  isn't it interesting that he said that he was threatened
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:51.960]  by george bush he dropped out for a while so they threatened me threatened my
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:55.800]  family uh everybody poo pooed that idea
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:59.320]  we know a lot more about the bushes now than we did then don't we let's go to
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:02.360]  laura in montana laura
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:08.600]  hi david uh i was at gas last night my husband and i looked at each other when
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:13.000]  k6 was started talking about ukraine and boots on the ground and helping the
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.040]  ukranians you know he knows absolutely nothing about
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:24.120]  what happened in ukraine and russia the mh17 you name it and even
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:29.960]  including victoria newland's famous leaked audio tape with jeffrey piet
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:33.400]  the u.s ambassador to ukraine talking about
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:37.240]  who she was going to put in as president is it going to be
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:41.800]  klitschko or jasmin you know this is really the tail mark
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:45.640]  indication of the united states involvement in
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:49.080]  ukraine oh absolutely i agree with you laura and and you when you look at all
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:51.480]  these people that's why i say to people look
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:56.040]  there isn't any other candidate out there other than donald trump who is
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:00.440]  pushing back against the neocons they have all aligned against them
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:04.920]  they have to stop him at every uh at any expense
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:07.880]  and it's the people like you just mentioned john casey but marco rubio is
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:10.840]  the same way ted cruz is the same way they all
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:15.400]  want to put us into every conflict and initiate these conflicts as they did in
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:19.320]  ukraine go ahead like like he said about ttp
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:22.360]  or ttp he didn't even know what that was
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:27.000]  i just can't believe we have somebody running for president who knows nothing
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  about all these incidents it's just shocking to me
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:38.120]  so i do thank you for all the work you do david you are such an asset
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:41.720]  to enforcers i wish i wish you could be an advisor to
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:45.880]  donald trump well thanks he's got some good advisors i'm
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:50.040]  you know what he's got senator sessions and senator sessions
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:53.080]  knows what's going on he knows what's going on
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:57.480]  this is not about trade this is about managing our economy
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:01.240]  and it is about destroying our sovereignty senator sessions understands
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:04.360]  that and i hope that he has donald trump's ear
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:07.000]  because there's going to be all kinds of people who are going to come to him
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.800]  they're going to be people from the council in foreign relations and there's
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:13.560]  you know we've we've got however people from the cfr that are already
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:17.000]  counselors to ted Cruz so as they're trashing
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.520]  donald trump people like max boot and others from the cfr
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:23.720]  as they're trashing him the leader of the cfr
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:26.920]  robert haas tries to come to him to play good cop
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:31.000]  okay so you got good cop bad cop being played by the cfr ronald reagan was the
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.680]  first president we had that uh after the cfr was created that was not a member
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:40.040]  of the cfr but then he put 350 60 cfr people in the state
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:43.320]  department they wound up controlling it so they have their ways
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:47.160]  and that's something i hope uh donald trump is wise about that if he becomes
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:50.840]  president he needs to listen to the solid people
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:58.760]  like senator sessions stay with us we'll be right back with more of your calls

[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:17.160]  concerned about is the fact that people can look at this and not be concerned
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:21.240]  about it that people cannot report on this and it bothers me on so many
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:24.360]  different levels the idea that the government
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:27.960]  would first put out a a video that was a deliberate attempt
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:33.320]  to deceive people and then as this incredibly powerful video of the
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:37.000]  cell phone inside the car comes out and people can see what was really going
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.720]  on that the mainstream media would not be
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:43.640]  interested in covering this and we have to get
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:47.960]  the word out unless we have a large number of the american
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:53.400]  public who are concerned about this who see what has happened
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:57.160]  nothing is going to change one or two of us who are upset about this and it's not
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:56:59.800]  going to change anything we have to get everyone
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:02.920]  to understand what's going on and we have to understand that there are other
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:06.040]  things too like jury nullification i mean the jurors
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:09.160]  in these cases where these guys are coming up they need to understand
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:13.640]  that clive and bundy a nothing and the criminal complaint that i read was true
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:17.400]  about clive and bundy it was a pack of lies but they're going to try to send
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:22.840]  this guy to jail for 43 years even if he had told people
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:26.680]  let's have this uh demonstration i want you to help me try to get my cattle
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:30.520]  back even if he had done that conspiracy okay he
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:34.200]  doesn't deserve 43 years in jail that's where you as a jury you say no we're
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:37.000]  not going to do it i'm sorry i want to let you talk go ahead uncle sam tell us

[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:37.160]  firestein is a highly successful hedge fund manager he wrote a book called planet
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:41.800]  ponzi also has a website of the same name how politicians and bankers
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:46.120]  stole your future and what happens next how you can survive so we're going to
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:48.600]  be talking to mitral firestein in the next
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:53.400]  sequence let's talk to jermia in california you're up next jermia go
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:57.320]  ahead okay i was calling about the the debate
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:02.120]  last night um and i think that over the last week we've really seen you know
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:06.280]  the liberty movement has really seen ted cruz
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:09.960]  really manifest into what he is and he very much
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:14.120]  is the quintessential opportunist and he's and right now i think that
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:20.360]  the liberty movement that he really um uh courted for so long and tried to impress
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:24.840]  he's really just turning his back on them and you know speaking of that that's
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:27.480]  another thing that i wanted to bring up was that
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:30.600]  uh what has gone on in organ like your last caller brought up
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:35.560]  i absolutely have been floored david knife that you have the audacity to call
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:38.440]  pete fanphilia schill even if you don't like his
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:42.680]  reporting i can't believe that you would do this instead of backing a media
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:46.680]  journalist in jail i mean what are you doing why would you do that is it a
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:51.000]  competitive thing uh no actually we did it because he was
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:55.880]  the one who encouraged them to go there he had an involvement that went far
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:02:01.400]  beyond being simply a journalist and if you don't understand that i was i was
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:05.000]  at the bunker the bundy standoff uh i was there at
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.880]  bunkerville i know what happened there go go listen to the
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:13.480]  recording that he had with dan love uh he basically puts himself in charge
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:19.240]  so he'd be basically uh i think he created this whole situation to a large
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:23.400]  degree that's my personal opinion okay i think that he
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:27.240]  presented himself in a very unwise situation there but that's
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:31.320]  you disagree with me that's fine uh yeah he does do some journalism
[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:37.000]  occasionally uh let's talk to al in oregon al go ahead
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:45.400]  al you there hello al okay he's not there you know one of the things we're
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:49.160]  talking about the debates and i do agree with jeremiah california that
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:53.560]  uh yeah we've seen the mask come off of ted cruise we understand where he is i
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:58.040]  think from the very beginning he was there to take the libertarian vote that
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:02.680]  would have gone to ran paul he presented himself as somebody who uh
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:06.440]  stood for individual rights who stood for the constitution and now we're seeing
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:09.720]  what happens as we see the people lining up behind him
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:13.800]  who have pushed a forever war who have pushed the police and surveillance state
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:17.320]  who have called ed snowden a traitor who say that he ought to be
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:20.200]  executed and of course they repeat that he should be
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:24.760]  executed uh it was repeated by um ted cruise
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:28.920]  now we see who he is we see the bankers lining up behind him we see the
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:33.720]  massive number of donors the quietly aligning behind him
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:37.400]  wealthy investors as we pointed out before we've we've read this article to
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:41.160]  shooting skeet with him in park city utah meeting with him in a clubby
[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:45.080]  restaurant in washington uh this is a guy who has
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:49.240]  nearly as much in terms of financial backers from wall street as marco rubio
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:53.560]  does and they were the co-heirs to the
[02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:57.160]  sheldon adelson primary sheldon adelson couldn't really make up his mind
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:00.040]  where they wanted to go with marco rubio or ted cruise i should have told you
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:04.680]  something right there uh he is the guy who is out front
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:09.480]  for the uh neocons and he is not a conservative i think
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:13.240]  uh when i look at the uh public displays of piety
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:18.760]  and then what he does to people like uh ben carson in the iowa caucus even what
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:22.280]  he said about marco rubio uh putting out that fake video yeah
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:25.560]  there's no answers in that book saying that marco rubio trolled his dad by
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:28.760]  pointing to the bible and saying there's no answers in that book we see that over
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:33.480]  and over again also telling and and trolling
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:37.080]  donald trump for saying two chrythians i mean the message to me
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:40.760]  is that uh hey if you're a low information christian you're not welcome
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:43.800]  at church we don't need to be sending that message out
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:49.800]  we need to be sending out a message of uh charity and that is what we've seen
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:53.320]  in ben carson and i think he cannot get over the hypocrisy that he saw in
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:55.160]  ted cruise stay with us when we come back we're
[02:04:55.160 --> 02:05:00.120]  being talking to michael firesign where do you go to leave your legacy
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:03.560]  well if you're president barack obama you go to south by southwest

[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:12.760]  set up the server and as judge impolitano pointed out he said they're
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:17.080]  going to be talking to him about whose idea it was to set up this
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:21.640]  conspiracy to evade the restrictions on classified documents
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:26.280]  they point out they say brian pagliano is a devastating witness
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:30.840]  and as the webmaster he knows exactly who had access to clinton's computer and
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:34.600]  devices at specific times his importance to this case cannot be
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:38.440]  overemphasized said an anonymous intelligent source
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:42.040]  so that's going to be very interesting of course the key thing about it
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:45.480]  which is what judge impolitano was talking about was that they granted him
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:49.640]  immunity he took the fifth amendment he said i'm not going to talk about this
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:53.880]  and they said a guess what will give you immunity to get you to talk you don't
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:58.920]  do that we've had multiple prosecutors at high levels talking about this and
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:01.640]  this common sense you don't give immunity to somebody
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:04.600]  at a low level unless you want to get information on somebody that's higher
[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:08.280]  up the question is how far up do they want to go ultimately that buck stops
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:12.520]  with hillary clinton herself interesting new development in that story
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:16.040]  let's go now to our guest mitchell fireside thank you for joining us mr
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:19.080]  fireside thanks for having me here today
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:23.480]  tell us first of all about ponzi schemes we all hear the term many of us know
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:27.160]  what a ponzi scheme is tell us a little bit about your definition of a ponzi
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:30.440]  scheme and how it came about well what's important is the book that i've
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:34.520]  written is the best descriptor of the global
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:38.040]  ponzi scheme is planet ponzi because what we have
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:42.440]  are governments around the world that think that they can by printing money
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:46.520]  and executing these schemes like quantitative easing
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:51.960]  and asset purchases they can reinflate the economies of the world and create
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:55.560]  jobs by printing hundreds of trillions of dollars
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:58.760]  now this is an utter failure it's been a failure
[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:02.760]  and this is you can't pay your way out of debt with borrowed money and my book
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:06.360]  goes through line by line what the governments have done
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:10.120]  and it examines actually using the government's own data
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:13.400]  the problems that they've created so what they've done is basically made the
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:16.280]  problems exponentially worse by money printing
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:19.800]  you know you can see we've got the central banks in the united states we've
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:23.160]  got the united u.s federal reserve in europe we've
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:27.320]  got the european central bank and in japan we've got bank of japan and in
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:29.800]  england we've got the bank of england all of them
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:33.720]  have increased the total amount of debt the sum
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:37.480]  exponentially you know they'll tell you that the deficits decreased
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:40.920]  but to give you a picture as to what that means
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:45.000]  and the listeners what that means is if you say oh my wife went out shopping
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.400]  today and she bought a dress at chanel that cost
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:51.560]  ninety five thousand dollars and she comes home and says honey
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:55.640]  i saved a hundred thousand dollars because i bought a dress for ninety
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:59.560]  five thousand that was two hundred thousand so look at the deal that we
[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:02.600]  got here say yeah wait a second we didn't have that
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:05.880]  we didn't have that money to begin with i think as men we've all had that
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:09.800]  discussion at one point in time not necessarily those kind of
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:13.080]  astronomical numbers let me ask you because you mentioned you know the
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:15.960]  quantitative easing everything we just had the european central bank this week
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:19.640]  come out with quantitative easing just as the american
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:22.600]  federal reserve was saying that they were going to stop doing that now we
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:25.640]  got the european central bank saying they're going to give us your opinion
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:29.160]  about what's going on with that well i mean let's look at the central banks
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:33.000]  and the composite of the central banks i mean you've got lunatics running the
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.040]  asylum yeah and the policies that they've implemented
[02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:40.360]  have not worked look at the bank of japan for 30 years
[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:44.280]  that that economy has been flatlining and they've done massive amounts of
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:46.760]  quantitative easing enough to blow up through the third
[02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:51.000]  largest economy in the world enough to blow up their economy
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.200]  you know you will see the unexpected consequences now you would think the
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:57.240]  united states and janet yellen who runs our central bank
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:01.480]  would have learned a lesson or mario draghi who's x goldman sacks
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:06.920]  x head of the bank of italy so he actually created all of italy's debt
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:11.240]  and then moved over to run the ecb and yesterday he announced more money
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:14.120]  printing i mean so it's absolute lunacy so
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:20.600]  as a result when he announced this the german stock market the dax
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:25.240]  skyrocketed up two percent and then dropped a total of i think
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:29.400]  seven percent from peak to trough so it totally reversed itself and today it
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:33.080]  was euphoric again and up three percent so what we're seeing is a massive
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:37.320]  amount of volatility this will not end well i can guarantee you
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:40.840]  and of course what they always like to tell us is that macroeconomics
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:46.200]  uh has some kind of a uh it operates in an environment that
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:49.000]  has absolutely nothing to do with the reality that we understand in our
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.360]  everyday life so whenever we give them an analogy like you were mentioning with
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:55.240]  a uh with a dress and you know saving a little
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:13:57.640]  bit of money but spending a ridiculous amount of money
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:01.400]  whenever we come up with real world application oh no no no no no that's
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:04.840]  microeconomics you know microeconomics you know everything is fine but
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:08.680]  we get into the world of macroeconomics it's something like quantum physics and
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:11.640]  nothing you know we got these heisenberg uncertainty principles and
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:16.120]  all these other factors in this fantasy land that don't don't really apply i i
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:19.880]  guess when i look at it and and uh we look at the long history of the federal
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:23.800]  reserve the fundamental thing that concerns me is just
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:27.800]  the very idea that we would have central planning to this degree
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:31.880]  and that a small click of people who are uh
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:36.040]  unaccountable to others uh can't even audit these people that they would be
[02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:39.480]  able to create boom and bust cycles the way that they do
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:42.520]  yeah i think i think what you're doing though is is candy coating it a bit
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:46.040]  because basically they're lying to us yeah and they're they're not telling us
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:49.400]  what's really going on with the economy but anybody can tell
[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:53.960]  that jobs are not being created i mean president obama came out with the
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:57.160]  numbers the employment figures came out
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:15:00.600]  last week and said how great the economy was in the united states
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:04.040]  now if the economy is as good as you know i'm
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:08.600]  nonpartisan so basically i don't care who gets in as long as they do the job
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:11.960]  properly so if the economy is really good
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:16.600]  what we have at record highs right now student loans 1.3 trillion
[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:20.760]  the amount of food stamp recipients at all-time record highs
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:24.120]  the federal debt at all-time record highs the amount of money printing
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:31.080]  all-time record highs tuition costs have skyrocketed 1,300 percent since 1981
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:34.920]  so we do have inflation health care costs similarly have
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:39.080]  gone up massively labor participation however has collapsed
[02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:43.560]  home ownership has collapsed and incomes have collapsed
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:47.400]  wealth inequality though is at a record rate and that's what that's what these
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:50.280]  policies that the fed the bank of england and the
[02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:55.560]  ecb have increased massively so unicorns
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:59.640]  rainbows hope and hype are never trading strategies
[02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:03.640]  and adding to a looting losing position which is what the fed and the ecb in the
[02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:08.520]  bank of japan continuously do is not going to end very well i mean you
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:12.120]  know we saw in weimar republic and we saw in zimbabwe how that
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:16.680]  worked out didn't work out very well what the the facts of the matter
[02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:20.040]  right now are we've achieved peak debt right
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:24.920]  so we've got exponential group think on behalf of all these central bankers that
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:27.240]  think that they can plan on everybody's behalf
[02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:30.680]  you have the same bad pennies that keep reappearing in the scene
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:33.960]  like you've got paul krugman who hasn't been right
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:37.880]  in a long while you've got larry summers who convinced bill clinton to end
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:41.960]  glass steagle which was the beginning of the end for the credit markets all of
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:44.360]  these things have created what i would say
[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:47.800]  america to go full banana republic you know which
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:52.920]  which which leads to a massive currency war so where do you see this uh what
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:56.440]  happens next as you say in your book the subtitle here what happens next and
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:16:59.480]  how can we survive what would you what do you think is going to be the solution
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:02.360]  of this well you know i think the the problem is
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:06.200]  is we need we need to flush out the cesspool of corruption
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:10.360]  which we call washington dc and until we can do that we're going to have
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:14.680]  significant headwinds in every market we've lost the markets don't exist
[02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:18.280]  anymore what all these manipulations the central bank
[02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:22.680]  has manipulated every asset class that there is stock prices are way too high
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:26.680]  bond prices are way too high and real estate prices are way too high
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:30.280]  the theory behind this was we can increase what's called
[02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:35.400]  aggregate demand by boosting these asset prices they can have a trickle down
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:39.880]  effect this has been a total failure there's no
[02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:43.960]  evidence that this has worked at all in fact the opposite is the case
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:48.280]  so what do we need to do we need to recognize what the problems are
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:52.040]  and don't get me wrong david what what i'll tell
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:55.480]  the listening the listeners is that there's great opportunity
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:59.880]  in any market where there's volatility you just have to pick out your spots
[02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:03.560]  and figure out where the opportunities and investment opportunities and
[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:07.320]  horizons will lie for you and you have to understand what's going on
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:11.000]  we see that we've seen a swing away from traditional media nobody believes a
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.280]  traditional media anymore for good reason because they know that the
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:18.280]  politicians have been lying and they know that the media has been
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:21.480]  lying to them and complicit i mean look at the whole scandal with
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:25.160]  hillary clinton i mean she's you know with the banking system
[02:18:25.160 --> 02:18:29.400]  we've seen too big to fail too big to jail too big to bail out now we've got
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:32.440]  too big to prosecute and too connected to prosecute
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:35.880]  because i can tell you something right now that your listeners might know or
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:41.720]  might not know this trail of emails above top secret sac emails leads
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:46.040]  directly to president obama's desk and loretta lynch
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:50.120]  as the attorney general is covering this up that's why we haven't heard about it
[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:53.720]  what they do tell you though is how quickly they want to prosecute apple
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:56.920]  for not unlocking an iphone to end everyone's liberty
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:19:00.760]  that proceeds right along but they sweep this whole thing with hillary clinton
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:05.400]  right underneath the carpet oh it's stunning the the double standard
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:08.840]  on everything that we look at but clearly when you just look at narrow it
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:12.840]  down to this as you just pointed out the difference between being so obsessed
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:18.440]  about one little iphone and then giving a complete pass to these thousands of
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:22.440]  emails over there people need to ask themselves and again when
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:27.000]  napolitano was talking about it goes who hatched this conspiracy because it's
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:30.200]  uh you know they're plotting together to do something that is fundamentally
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:33.720]  illegal why would she need to have her own private server and i would imagine
[02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:37.640]  that it's not just about the classified documents but it's also about the
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:40.760]  information that she has on other people as well
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:45.080]  when we come back i want to get back and uh more into this book uh planet ponzi
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:49.080]  with mitchell fireside thank you so much we're going to be right back uh right
[02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:52.120]  after the break stay with us

[02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:18.600]  Mitchell Firestein he is the author of Planet Ponzi he's a highly
[02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:21.800]  successful hedge fund manager we're talking about
[02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:26.360]  what might be done to get out of this massive
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:30.680]  bubble that the central banks have created of course as we were talking
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:34.840]  in the last segment uh Mitchell you brought up the too big to fail too big
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:38.600]  to jail crowd we've seen everybody knows about
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:43.640]  El Chapo and his escape from prison most people don't really know about
[02:24:43.640 --> 02:24:47.800]  HSBC's escape from prison because they were laundering money
[02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:51.640]  for his drug cartel the Sinaloa cartel they even gave them their own
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:55.240]  private window to come to to count out the cash and yet
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:58.600]  they were just given a mere slap on the wrist what do we do
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:03.000]  about the big banks that control us but especially about the central bank the
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:08.520]  Federal Reserve do you agree that we ought to audit the Fed perhaps in the Fed
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:11.720]  audit the Fed I think they should put them in prison most of the people who
[02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:14.120]  are working for the Fed I mean I think you need
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:18.280]  you need a high degree of accountability and you need some transparency and we
[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:22.440]  have neither with this Federal Reserve all we have is lie after lie
[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:26.680]  but you know not to be too negative about it I mean we need to be realistic
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:30.600]  and what we need to say is look at the tons of malinvestment that has been
[02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:34.280]  been created by the reckless policies that they've
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:37.480]  implemented over the years I mean you've got Facebook trading at a
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:40.280]  ridiculous multiple companies like Tesla
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:44.280]  I mean these are bubbles these are huge bubbles you talk about the crime and
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:46.840]  finance now I took I've been an investment banking
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:49.800]  for 35 years I took two years off to write my book
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:53.960]  Planet Ponzi because I said to a couple of the governments unless you let these
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:57.000]  too big to fails fail I'm going to write a book about it
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:00.680]  and the reason why I'm writing a book is because you all know what happened
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:04.840]  and this book explains exactly what happened so when it fails
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:08.520]  catastrophically you won't be able to say well nobody knew that this would
[02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:11.560]  happen because now everybody knows you know
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:15.480]  there is a 400 page record of what would happen that you know in
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:19.080]  that anyone can understand if you read it using the Federal Reserve
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:22.920]  and the other government's own data so it's not that it's conspiracy theory
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:26.840]  it's actual fact oh yeah it's actually it's it's
[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:30.280]  been done now we were warned when they were creating the Fed by a Charles
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:32.760]  Limburg's father who was I can't remember if he was a senator or
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:36.280]  congressman he said look they're gonna have the power to create boom and bust
[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:39.800]  cycles they and their insider friends will be able to
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:42.280]  profit from this because they will know the timing of these
[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:45.560]  cycles in many cases you know they can adjust this by
[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:49.240]  you know lowering interest rates over a prolonged period of time by small amounts
[02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:52.360]  and then starting to raise them you know they can create the
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:56.280]  bubble and then produce the pen that bursts it. You also though David what's
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:26:58.920]  important to note here is is the Fed supposed to be
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:02.840]  independent they're not independent one of the Fed governors is contributing to
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:06.520]  Hillary Clinton's campaign so I mean what does that tell you
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:12.200]  I mean is it what it's pay to play how does this work exactly that's a and b
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:17.400]  in in 1913 the value of the dollar if you look at the value of the dollar 1913
[02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:20.600]  when the Fed was set up it's worth two cents of what it was worth then so it's
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:26.600]  lost 98 percent of its value that's a b if you look at what the Fed
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:31.640]  has had as a mandate in 1913 that's not applicable today because it
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:35.080]  doesn't take into a fact or consideration what
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:38.760]  derivative products have done to the markets and the exponential amount of
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:41.720]  them there's over a quadrillion of them you know it's like
[02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:45.960]  the the narrative that you get from do as I say not as I do Warren Buffett
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:49.800]  who came out and he said this generation has it better than everybody
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:53.640]  else and if you look and he used in a metric that was like
[02:27:53.640 --> 02:27:57.400]  comparing apples to unicorns I mean it was
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:01.080]  ridiculous he talked about a GDP figure but what he didn't
[02:28:01.080 --> 02:28:06.280]  say when I was born in 1930 but what he didn't tell you was from 1930 to 1972
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:09.560]  we were on a gold standard where you could change dollars for gold
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:13.640]  right now you can change dollars for dollars which is fiat
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:17.400]  and look at how well that worked out in Zimbabwe and Weimar Republic
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:22.040]  it took a wheelbarrow full to buy one egg you know it was 50 50 trillion
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:26.680]  dollars to buy an egg in Zimbabwe you know you can't make comparisons
[02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:32.520]  but most unfortunately most of the public is is not financially
[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:36.760]  literate yeah and that's that's the thing and it's going to the thing that's really
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:40.760]  going to bring this house of cards down is when the U.S. dollars no longer the
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:45.400]  world's reserve currency where we don't have the ability to throw our weight
[02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:50.600]  around we've already seen signs of this between the bricks between
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:54.280]  Russia India China and others talking about how they're going to directly
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:58.120]  exchange goods in their own currencies without converting to the U.S. dollar
[02:28:58.120 --> 02:29:01.560]  we've kept this Ponzi scheme going with the alliance we've had with Saudi Arabia
[02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:06.440]  the petro dollars once the thing starts to unravel I think it'll go pretty
[02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:11.000]  quickly don't you well yeah U.S. dollar hegemony has ended already and people
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:16.040]  just don't realize that it's died that's a and b we are in a full scale and we
[02:29:16.040 --> 02:29:19.320]  have been for two years currency war because if you look at what's happened
[02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:23.720]  in Japan and in you know in the U.S. dollar
[02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:27.320]  in Europe their currencies have devalued against the dollar they've
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:32.680]  debased the currency by at least 30% so you know you've gone from 77 in the yen
[02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:37.800]  up to 128 or whatever the peak was and and
[02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:42.440]  yes absolutely and that currency is the key at the heart of all of this Ponzi
[02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:44.040]  scheme thank you so much for talking to us
[02:29:44.040 --> 02:29:48.520]  Mitchell Firestein the website is planet Ponzi.com and that's the name of the

[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:27.480]  hey david thanks for letting me kind of get on the air
[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:31.000]  oh thanks for calling i wanted to just i wanted to disagree with the
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:37.480]  with the guest uh and of course most of the comments you guys
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:42.120]  are made on the show if you have uh control of the money supply
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:46.520]  you have control of the judicial you have the control of the legislative you
[02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:50.520]  have control of the executive why would these people let
[02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:55.000]  a system that they have full complete power over fail
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.960]  they would do something there would be some band aid there would be something
[02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:01.000]  there would be quantitative easing there would be a jubilee there would be
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:05.720]  debt forgiveness there'd be something if you had full power why would you let
[02:36:05.720 --> 02:36:09.640]  the current system fail it makes no sense and that's i think that's why it
[02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:13.880]  hasn't failed all these uh um
[02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:17.960]  doom and gloomers over all these years the system hasn't failed
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:21.560]  and they'll prop it up and they'll do whatever it takes to keep it going
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:24.680]  well i don't know i think a lot of us looked at 2008 and thought that was a
[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:28.200]  failure i think a lot of us look at as he pointed out 99%
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:32.600]  of the purchasing power of our currency being lost over 100 years i think
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:36.360]  that would qualify as a failure and the concern is
[02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:39.800]  the same concern that we had at the very beginning if you give this kind of
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:44.600]  power to a private organization that is not really
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:47.480]  accountable to the public in no way as a matter of fact we are not even allowed
[02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:51.480]  the congress is not even allowed to know what happens inside of there
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:55.320]  and that's the important thing i think about audit the fed
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:58.760]  it shows the arrogance it shows the secrecy
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:03.880]  it shows the closed clubness of this whole issue the fact that we're not even
[02:37:03.880 --> 02:37:06.600]  our elected representatives are not even allowed to see what's going on it's
[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:11.000]  like these trade deals there is a globalist cabal
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:14.760]  that is controlling this these multinational corporations who
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:19.240]  operate who pull the levers for their benefit they adjust the timing
[02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:22.280]  they adjust how this is going to play out it was seen
[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:25.000]  people understood this is how this is going to play out we were sold the
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.960]  federal reserve idea by jp morgan saying hey we're
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:31.720]  going to get rid of these boom and bust cycles no what they did was
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:37.080]  they get they got the power to create the boom and bust cycles to set up the
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:41.400]  timing of these boom and bust cycles and we've had a lot of cycles if you got
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:45.080]  the levers of the economy if you can make the economy grow or you can
[02:37:45.080 --> 02:37:48.840]  cause it to contract by adjusting the money supply by adjusting the interest
[02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:50.680]  rates if you got all those types of controls
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:54.440]  nobody is allowed to see what you're doing nobody is allowed to remove you if
[02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:57.320]  they don't like what you're doing i reject the whole idea in the first
[02:37:57.320 --> 02:38:01.720]  place of central planning of an economy but it's even worse
[02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:06.760]  when you compound the error of central planning as if somebody is doing this
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:09.400]  you know they're trying we could have central plan
[02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:12.840]  society economy where somebody is really trying to do their
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:16.280]  darnest to make this all work and they just don't
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:18.920]  know how to make this work because that's what always happens that's what
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:22.920]  happened with russia you can't centrally plant an economy
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:28.280]  even if you're honest and intelligent but when you give these levers to people
[02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:31.480]  and you hide it up hide it in secrecy you make it private
[02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:35.320]  you say we're not even allowed to look at it that's what the audit the fed
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:40.280]  movement is about is to expose that secrecy that closed society
[02:38:40.280 --> 02:38:44.040]  and once that's exposed then we can move to the next step which is to end
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:48.280]  that society that's the ultimate goal so yeah we have a disagreement david i i
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:53.720]  think that there has been a lot that has worked out is i don't think it's
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:56.680]  worked out very well for us i know it's worked out very well for them
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:39:00.360]  and i think it's shameful that we have created
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:05.240]  this massive derivatives market that they continue to pump up the currency
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:08.040]  they've been able to get away with it only because
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:12.680]  they had the united states set up as a world's reserve currency that is the
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:17.160]  bubble is going to burst let's go to the next call let's go to
[02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:21.160]  bill and wisconsin bill
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:26.360]  yeah david a couple points that i'd like to bring up
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:33.560]  for you to relay to alex or to stone on the trump campaign
[02:39:33.560 --> 02:39:37.800]  the first thing is trump could get a lot of these
[02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:43.960]  bernie sanders people by endorsing glass teagle
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:51.160]  uh they're upset obviously with the bank and the
[02:39:51.160 --> 02:39:55.960]  situation that's going on there so that would be one
[02:39:55.960 --> 02:40:00.680]  yeah i i go ahead go ahead glass teagle that he should do
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:08.280]  uh trump uh in talking to the voters in different states shows great empathy
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:13.880]  for the fact that heroin abuse is running rampant in our country
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:17.320]  and he says we're going to stop it at the borders
[02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:21.160]  why not stop it in afghanistan
[02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:26.360]  all of the heroin is coming out of the opium production
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:31.320]  from that part of the world so whatever it takes
[02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:38.920]  stop the cia from protecting it uh sending packages of $100
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:42.920]  bills to the corrupt government of afghanistan
[02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:46.360]  are you going oh yeah we've seen that we know that uh
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:53.000]  that the taliban had virtually crushed that trafficking in opiates
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:57.400]  and then when the u.s government took over we saw it soar into record profits
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:00.760]  every year and now it's virtually all the supply worldwide it's in the high
[02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:03.880]  90 percentile i i agree with you i now of course you
[02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:07.480]  know trump has come out for the people that would support bernie sanders again
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:10.920]  he's against the trade deals he's against nafta
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:14.600]  when you're talking about the war on drugs at one point in time and of course
[02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:18.120]  donald trump hasn't talked about this maybe he will once the uh
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:21.720]  republican primaries are over because you know that is something the
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:24.920]  republicans and for the life of me i can understand why the republicans
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:28.440]  the republican voters i understand why the republican establishment
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:31.480]  uh supports the war on drugs it's a very effective
[02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:35.480]  lever a tool of power uh it was designed that way
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:39.240]  but the republican voters need to understand that it was a un agenda
[02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:42.840]  they the un created this agenda with all the schedules put all the drugs in the
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:46.520]  four schedules did it 10 years before nixon declared the war on drugs
[02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:49.880]  nevertheless uh it's kind of a third rail i guess if you want to talk about
[02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:53.480]  uh the the failed war on drugs and prohibition uh
[02:41:53.480 --> 02:41:57.720]  ran paul talked about it it it may be one of the reasons why uh he was harmed
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:01.480]  and that didn't do well in the primaries but i remember seeing uh
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:04.680]  interviews with donald trump where he said the only way we're going to stop the
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:09.560]  war on drugs uh the violence that's coming out of this is to decriminalize
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:13.720]  this and so i think he might be uh i think he's smart enough to uh see
[02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:17.000]  through this i think uh most people who look at this carefully
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:21.880]  understand that this has done exactly the opposite of what we wanted to do
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:25.320]  you know we were talking about uh the federal reserve and one of the things
[02:42:25.320 --> 02:42:29.240]  we've got a special report here from john bound about secret societies
[02:42:29.240 --> 02:42:33.800]  because you know that's one of the best examples of a secret society you can't
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:38.120]  even be audited by our congressman i would say that's a pretty secret
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:41.160]  private society that is controlling our economy
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:46.120]  the federal reserve but john bound has a broader report on secret societies
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:51.640]  are no longer a secret here's that report what is hidden shall be revealed
[02:42:51.640 --> 02:42:55.720]  newt gingrich former speaker of the house recently had this to say
[02:42:55.720 --> 02:42:58.920]  eliminating any doubt that we are aggressively ruled
[02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:01.960]  by nothing less than a global luciferian
[02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:05.720]  elite and now they're faced with a very real prospect of donald trump
[02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:09.400]  becoming the leader of the party and it absolutely drives them crazy
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:13.560]  they just cannot imagine sharing well because he's an outsider he's not them
[02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:16.600]  he's not part of the club he's uncontrollable
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:19.960]  uh you know he hasn't been through the initiation rights he didn't belong to the
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:24.280]  secret society the very word secrecy is repugnant
[02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:29.000]  in a free and open society and we are as a people
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:33.640]  inherently and historically opposed to secret societies
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:37.320]  the secret oaths and the secret proceedings
[02:43:37.320 --> 02:43:43.240]  we decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment
[02:43:43.240 --> 02:43:47.240]  of pertinent facts far outweigh the dangers
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:51.560]  which are cited to justify it even today
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:55.720]  there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:44:00.760]  by imitating its arbitrary restrictions even today
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:04.680]  there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation
[02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:10.520]  if our traditions do not survive with it and there is very grave danger
[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:14.360]  that an announced need for increased security
[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:18.760]  will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:23.080]  to the very limits of official censorship and concealment
[02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:27.160]  for we are opposed around the world by a monolithic
[02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:31.000]  and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:35.480]  cubit means for expanding its fear of influence
[02:44:35.480 --> 02:44:41.480]  what is at stake is more than one small country
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:48.280]  it is a big idea a new world order the new world order is no longer hiding in
[02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:51.160]  the shadows they are utilizing their total
[02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:54.600]  domination of civilization to bring your morality
[02:44:54.600 --> 02:44:58.520]  into a new dark age whether it's the united nation's
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:02.760]  david rockefeller lucious trust rollout of demoralization

[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:10.120]  the purpose of which is to change christian tradition or to redeem the

[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:40.440]  marriage for life number six promote homosexuality
[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:46.440]  as an alternative lifestyle number seven corrupt and defile the imagination
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:52.600]  by debasing art number eight use media to brainwash the population
[02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:58.680]  number nine promote a new age movement to overshadow the christian faith
[02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:02.760]  number ten have governments make all of the previous points
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:07.240]  laws and have the church endorse these changes
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:10.600]  these points were stated over 70 years ago
[02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:16.040]  and have metamorphosized into the civilization we know now in 2016
[02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:19.560]  and it's all around you for instance the ongoing
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:23.000]  force-feeding of illuminati symbolism through entertainment
[02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:27.880]  as hollywood's romance with occultism has finally percolated to the surface
[02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:33.320]  offering performances by illuminati slaves a kindakasha for example adorned
[02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:38.360]  with satanic regalia a channeling lucifer on the today's show no less
[02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:42.040]  as in the words of one of the new world order's chief engineers
[02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:46.120]  former u.s national security advisers a big new brzezinski
[02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:50.600]  history is much more the product of chaos than conspiracy
[02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:55.000]  john bound for info wars dot com
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:58.040]  and again that was a report from john bound secret societies are no longer a
[02:46:58.040 --> 02:47:01.160]  secret you can see that on the alex jones youtube channel
[02:47:01.160 --> 02:47:05.640]  and we have alex jones joining us now reporting from the road alex

[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:58.760]  is i have been taking care of a lot of other
[02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:01.400]  business for the operation everybody knows i do these
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:05.560]  vacations i'm meant to be back today but i appreciate david being there
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:09.400]  and i will be back this sunday four to six p.m and then all next week live
[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:13.880]  on the air with all the huge things that are developing and unfolding as well
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:19.240]  and we'll cover the next most key uh group of primaries that are the
[02:48:19.240 --> 02:48:25.960]  ides of march obviously on march 15th but there is a lot of stuff happening a
[02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:29.720]  lot of things unfolding uh obviously in the world
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:32.440]  so you're just what john bowman's talking about just when you were covering
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:36.840]  david uh and that is that world government is
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:40.280]  openly out of the open and so we have a debate about the world
[02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:42.920]  government if we pointed out to the public if we tell people what its aims
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:46.280]  are and show their own quotes and explain that that's why
[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:50.680]  all this bad stuff is happening that they set up businesses and systems to
[02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:56.280]  manage and exacerbate human crises uh in their own words that full
[02:48:56.280 --> 02:49:00.600]  spectrum dominance can be exposed and we can really free humanity
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:06.200]  to to to to not go into some utopia but to actually have a shot at working on
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:09.560]  our problems uh and not have these savages
[02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:15.560]  who basically handicap everyone so that these globalist mental midgets
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:19.880]  and demons can rule over the rest of us they are so wicked so selfish
[02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:23.880]  so hateful that they have to lower us
[02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:29.880]  down uh to an extremely dumb down level uh so that they can
[02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:33.160]  roll over us and i know i keep repeating that but but but we can talk about the
[02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:37.320]  this and that this piece and all the different wheels of this thing
[02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:40.840]  all the gears but if you pull back and look at the big enchilada
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:45.000]  if you look at the larger uh power structure
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:48.280]  that's there and understand what the machine is
[02:49:48.280 --> 02:49:51.720]  it is an artificiality it is an attempt to take over
[02:49:51.720 --> 02:49:55.640]  creation it is an attempt to take over the natural order
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:49:59.560]  and create a very twisted ugly demonic system in its place
[02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:02.600]  and that doesn't come from some
[02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:06.520]  but i'm not denying christ so that i'm a christian i'm saying to atheists and
[02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:09.960]  other people do you understand the globalists want to play god
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:13.800]  like ray Kurzweil said i don't believe of god yet i'm going to become god
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:20.120]  virgin with machines that gives the ruling cosmology belief goal
[02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:26.280]  uh uh promise land that the new world order controllers are pushing for
[02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:29.720]  and that's what all of us at info wars are great crew wonderful folks like

[02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:15.160]  us reporting from the road is alex jones alex
[02:54:15.160 --> 02:54:19.160]  david again thank you so much for hosting today uh folks just here then
[02:54:19.160 --> 02:54:22.200]  i have been out much the week on staycation getting a whole bunch of
[02:54:22.200 --> 02:54:25.560]  family issues and also business issues to
[02:54:25.560 --> 02:54:29.320]  launch info or is the next level completed we have successfully completed
[02:54:29.320 --> 02:54:32.120]  a whole bunch of really big milestones at hurdles
[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:34.920]  this week so i want to thank god for that right now and i want to be
[02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:38.360]  thankful and thank god for our great crew and and i want to thank god for the
[02:54:38.360 --> 02:54:41.800]  listeners uh and our affiliates and everybody out there and i mean that
[02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:44.840]  from bottom of my heart i get so angry a lot of times because i'm not
[02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:48.520]  doing enough or i'm not being effective enough that i kind of burn out
[02:54:48.520 --> 02:54:53.160]  like a race car over revving to 12 000 rbms
[02:54:53.160 --> 02:54:57.320]  you know so show that's what it comes down to
[02:54:57.320 --> 02:55:00.440]  but when you really sit back and look at how awake the planet's becoming how
[02:55:00.440 --> 02:55:03.400]  much good is happening you have to realize there's not just evil in the
[02:55:03.400 --> 02:55:05.800]  world there's not just darkness there's also light
[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:09.560]  and for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction i say that
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:13.160]  i don't have a million articles to talk about them a thousand issues to cover
[02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:17.080]  it's because those are so core we have parasites that would dumb us down and
[02:55:17.080 --> 02:55:20.040]  take control of civilization to play god
[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:22.680]  and that's never become more clear what the republicans say they're going to
[02:55:22.680 --> 02:55:25.560]  steal the election openly and they've gone from denying
[02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:29.400]  election fraud just admitting it uh just just everything is coming out in the
[02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:34.360]  open and humanity is historically always given a chance
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:37.880]  when evil gets really bad to wake up and say no before it's too late and
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:41.960]  america in the world is being given massive chances to turn back let's say
[02:55:41.960 --> 02:55:45.640]  we don't believe in god just to the agnostics out there whatever judgment
[02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:50.680]  of tyranny judgment of our actions we're being given a long time to turn back
[02:55:50.680 --> 02:55:54.520]  we're being given a long time and thousands of red flags upon thousands
[02:55:54.520 --> 02:56:00.200]  to turn turn back and and you know to stop going down this road and it is pure
[02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:03.880]  evil that the chimeras the baby parts the genetic engineering
[02:56:03.880 --> 02:56:07.640]  all of it it's here and we have to realize this is happening
[02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:11.560]  not to be victims but to be overcomers and defeat the globalist so i just want
[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:15.880]  to thank all of you and i want to thank god for his son jesus christ
[02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:20.200]  and his sacrifices and everybody else has tried to be christ-like in his image
[02:56:20.200 --> 02:56:23.160]  and and and tried to be good and tried to do the right thing because i know it's
[02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:26.760]  hard let me tell you god always gets up carrying his through
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:29.800]  and in the few occasions where we're not carried through it's for an example to
[02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:33.400]  others and it's the larger plan and that's all i'm saying is i don't
[02:56:33.400 --> 02:56:37.800]  sit here and demand things from god uh but i do love god and
[02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:41.160]  i want to be a good person and i want to defend humanity and i want to build
[02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:45.000]  people up i don't want to see this elite win and i know you don't as well so
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:48.280]  thank you all for your support of info wars and we're in this together and
[02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:50.600]  we're not perfect but we're slinging for the fences
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:53.640]  and giving everything we got i know david night is as well so
[02:56:53.640 --> 02:56:57.560]  thank you all for your support i was going to do a whole rant today
[02:56:57.560 --> 02:57:03.000]  about obama coming to town and how south by southwest is a giant scam
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:07.640]  in my view stealing people's dreams and is a giant corporate system uh just to
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:11.480]  voice and have people pay thousands of dollars to be hoisted into
[02:57:11.480 --> 02:57:16.360]  corporate propaganda and isn't it perfect this empty suit this lying
[02:57:16.360 --> 02:57:21.800]  narcissistic globalist devil barack obama who defends muslims jumping
[02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:25.560]  boiling oil on women's faces he does that's who he supports till he phones
[02:57:25.560 --> 02:57:29.480]  and so he has the left not attack but he hates fathers he hates christians he
[02:57:29.480 --> 02:57:33.800]  hates strong women they this evil is allied with radical
[02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:38.040]  islam which is becoming all of islam because they hate humanity and they
[02:57:38.040 --> 02:57:41.720]  hate freedom and they hate free will they want to shackle us and enslave us

[02:59:49.560 --> 02:59:57.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:04.280 --> 03:00:07.640]  in the councils of government we must guard against
[03:00:07.640 --> 03:00:12.200]  the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought
[03:00:12.200 --> 03:00:16.360]  by the military industrial commonwealth in vallus texas
[03:00:16.360 --> 03:00:19.480]  three shots were fired at president kennedy's motorcade
[03:00:19.480 --> 03:00:24.040]  in downtown dallas the first report to say that president kennedy has been
[03:00:24.040 --> 03:00:34.280]  seriously wounded by this shooting it is a big idea a new order
[03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:37.320]  it was almost as if you were a planned impulse
[03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:50.920]  kick just pancake either you were with us or you were with the terrorists
[03:00:58.280 --> 03:01:02.440]  but i also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that ak-47s belong in the
[03:01:02.440 --> 03:01:08.440]  hands of soldiers not the hands of criminals
[03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:12.120]  guns will be caked and no one will be able to be off we can take all of them
[03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:15.720]  for many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this
[03:01:15.720 --> 03:01:20.280]  and in america the global governance at last is it one world the central bank
[03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:24.200]  was in charge but aren't we all just living and dying from what the central
[03:01:24.200 --> 03:01:31.080]  banks do and for me give me liberty or give me death
[03:01:31.080 --> 03:01:34.360]  live from the info wars dot com studios
[03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:37.960]  it's alex jones
[03:01:37.960 --> 03:01:41.960]  joe bigs here with info wars dot com with an update on something that has
[03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:45.480]  happened in the last 24 hours something that is probably
[03:01:45.480 --> 03:01:50.520]  the most horrendous act ever carried out on american soil
[03:01:50.520 --> 03:01:55.320]  no not pearl harbor not even 9 11 something far worse
[03:01:55.320 --> 03:01:59.080]  than that this is the punch heard around the world
[03:01:59.080 --> 03:02:02.200]  and now we're going to bring in darin agreeing to talk about this
[03:02:02.200 --> 03:02:06.440]  now darin hey we're not in a trump rally man come on
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:09.240]  so what's going on right now we're flipping through all the news channels
[03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:13.800]  a second ago and all i'm seeing is this instance that kind of unfolded
[03:02:13.800 --> 03:02:17.800]  where someone got punched in a trump rally it's on every single channel i
[03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:21.240]  mean you can't get away from it by the time you see this video you've probably
[03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:25.400]  already seen the video of rakeem jones who is a
[03:02:25.400 --> 03:02:30.600]  protester at a donald trump rally and he said he was there as a
[03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:34.600]  social experiment well him and his friends went to the
[03:02:34.600 --> 03:02:37.640]  trump rally they started yelling at donald trump as soon as donald
[03:02:37.640 --> 03:02:41.800]  trump got on the stage they were quickly met by security and police
[03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:46.360]  officers who then escorted them began to escort them out of the building
[03:02:46.360 --> 03:02:51.240]  and then a 78 year old man named john macaw
[03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:55.000]  sucker punched rakeem in the face it looked like it was an elbow or maybe a
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:58.040]  punch in the face it was hard to see from the angle that i was looking at
[03:02:58.040 --> 03:03:02.520]  and then the police officers rather than apprehending the guy who punched
[03:03:02.520 --> 03:03:05.800]  rakeem they they went after the black guy and they escorted him off
[03:03:05.800 --> 03:03:09.080]  yeah so basically what you're saying is you have a group of people
[03:03:09.080 --> 03:03:12.360]  who went looking for trouble they found trouble
[03:03:12.360 --> 03:03:17.640]  and now there's a social experiment oh okay so they found that experiment they
[03:03:17.640 --> 03:03:20.920]  they got their cause and effect and now they're complaining about it on
[03:03:20.920 --> 03:03:23.880]  national tv they're being held up as these heroes
[03:03:23.880 --> 03:03:27.240]  national heroes now hillary clinton's already been asked about it
[03:03:27.240 --> 03:03:33.400]  count me among those who are are truly distraught and even appalled by a lot
[03:03:33.400 --> 03:03:37.880]  of what i see mr trump should not be urging people on this is
[03:03:37.880 --> 03:03:42.760]  deeply distressing and i think as the campaign goes further
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:47.080]  more and more americans are going to be you know really disturbed by the kind of
[03:03:47.080 --> 03:03:50.920]  campaign he's running all you're going to see for the entire weekend you're
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:55.720]  going to see this again and again and again and this guy rakeem
[03:03:55.720 --> 03:03:59.720]  jones is going to be a national hero i'm going to predict it right now
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:05.000]  barack obama is going to invite rakeem jones to the white house you watch
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:08.680]  this is something that they're trying to use they're doing everything they can
[03:04:08.680 --> 03:04:12.200]  to go and derail trump they know that people are showing up to his rallies
[03:04:12.200 --> 03:04:14.520]  they're emotional and i don't want to say one more thing
[03:04:14.520 --> 03:04:18.280]  by the way at this rally and the average trump rally
[03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:21.640]  there are people of all color all right there's there's lots of black folks
[03:04:21.640 --> 03:04:25.160]  there there's lots of every race and color you can imagine is at these trump
[03:04:25.160 --> 03:04:27.640]  rallies you know it's something you never want to see happen
[03:04:27.640 --> 03:04:31.480]  but again it's not connected to the campaign whatsoever it's just it's
[03:04:31.480 --> 03:04:34.200]  something that happened in the crowd by bystanders
[03:04:34.200 --> 03:04:38.040]  i guess jeff what what some would say here and let me ask you some would say
[03:04:38.040 --> 03:04:41.480]  it is connected to the campaign or maybe it's connected to the campaign in terms
[03:04:41.480 --> 03:04:45.640]  of the tone and the atmosphere that the candidate himself is creating
[03:04:45.640 --> 03:04:49.240]  but msnbc is going to continue to play this over and over again
[03:04:49.240 --> 03:04:53.240]  you're going to know that name rakeem jones by heart at the end of the day
[03:04:53.240 --> 03:04:56.600]  stay tuned for more reports about the punch herd around the world
[03:04:56.600 --> 03:05:00.040]  i'm joe biggs with info wars dot com where do you go to leave your legacy
[03:05:00.040 --> 03:05:03.560]  well if you're president barack obama you go to south by southwest
[03:05:03.560 --> 03:05:07.640]  that's right in addition to the 200 000 workers and guests and attendees who
[03:05:07.640 --> 03:05:11.160]  will be filling up the austin downtown area barack obama is going to show up
[03:05:11.160 --> 03:05:15.160]  with his giant secret service detail of course in addition to tying up traffic
[03:05:15.160 --> 03:05:19.080]  as kit daniels covered even the mayor of austin is warning people to stay home on
[03:05:19.080 --> 03:05:23.160]  friday as the president's visit is sure to tie up traffic for hours on end
[03:05:23.160 --> 03:05:27.240]  he will also be utilizing state police and local police resources which could
[03:05:27.240 --> 03:05:31.080]  be used during south by southwest he'll be making two stops one at the long
[03:05:31.080 --> 03:05:34.520]  center for performing arts to give a speech and then jumping across the river
[03:05:34.520 --> 03:05:38.120]  to attend a fundraiser at austin music hall and then it's on to a private
[03:05:38.120 --> 03:05:41.960]  fundraiser at the home of amy and kirk rudy local developers here
[03:05:41.960 --> 03:05:45.560]  it was amy rudy who approached a local austin city council member
[03:05:45.560 --> 03:05:49.080]  after he voted against awarding a 37 million dollar tax rebate to her
[03:05:49.080 --> 03:05:52.920]  husband's company and said don't f with my husband and she repeated it twice
[03:05:52.920 --> 03:05:54.920]  these are the kind of people obama hangs out with

[03:08:48.200 --> 03:08:52.120]  and they put that report right now on youtube for everybody else as well
[03:08:52.120 --> 03:08:56.120]  the the the punch heard around the world and of course for those that don't
[03:08:56.120 --> 03:08:58.440]  know what the shot heard around the world is there's a lot of new people
[03:08:58.440 --> 03:09:03.400]  listening a lot of people are americans but in 1775
[03:09:03.400 --> 03:09:07.480]  the redcoats came to lexicon and concord to confiscate the firearms
[03:09:07.480 --> 03:09:12.120]  the the gunpowder and the shot or the the the quote you know round bullets
[03:09:12.120 --> 03:09:14.840]  before they had cartridges they came to take the firearms
[03:09:14.840 --> 03:09:19.000]  that's what really finally kicked off 1776 imagine folks out in the middle of
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.880]  nowhere and in the wilderness and you know can't have guns now that's just
[03:09:21.880 --> 03:09:23.960]  crazy so that's what started the whole deal
[03:09:23.960 --> 03:09:27.720]  well they're claiming this is the new revolution being started
[03:09:27.720 --> 03:09:31.800]  george soros has primed it hundreds of millions of dollars 35 million just in
[03:09:31.800 --> 03:09:35.000]  furthest and starts trying to start a race war trying to fan the flames trying
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:38.360]  to turn everybody against each other taking some legitimate issues and
[03:09:38.360 --> 03:09:42.760]  twisting them others just making stuff up uh to to literally get us at each
[03:09:42.760 --> 03:09:47.240]  other's throats and they keep sending in these big groups of people
[03:09:47.240 --> 03:09:50.840]  white black is being academic but a lot of times you know groups of black folks
[03:09:50.840 --> 03:09:55.240]  going in to these trump rallies screaming yelling bumping into people
[03:09:55.240 --> 03:09:57.240]  running over secret service people you name it
[03:09:57.240 --> 03:10:00.680]  saying quote it's a social experiment and they were just playing the clip where
[03:10:00.680 --> 03:10:03.880]  they admitted it's a social experiment so they know
[03:10:03.880 --> 03:10:07.320]  that if you go to a rally at 25 000 people and run around screaming and
[03:10:07.320 --> 03:10:09.400]  yelling that there's going to be some hothead
[03:10:09.400 --> 03:10:13.080]  who's mad maybe he's mad because his job got shipped overseas maybe he is a
[03:10:13.080 --> 03:10:17.320]  racist whatever 25 000 people you're marching past thousands
[03:10:17.320 --> 03:10:19.560]  of them you're bumping into people you're doing
[03:10:19.560 --> 03:10:22.600]  stuff you're going to get hauled off and hit i've actually seen in leftist
[03:10:22.600 --> 03:10:26.120]  publications them take the footage from last year at the abortion clinic where
[03:10:26.120 --> 03:10:31.320]  jacari everybody basically protected me uh and i have seen them
[03:10:31.320 --> 03:10:34.760]  play just 30 second clips of me pushing the guy back
[03:10:34.760 --> 03:10:39.160]  and jacari pushing somebody back and and and us pushing back and saying look
[03:10:39.160 --> 03:10:42.360]  they're attacking people and an abortion clinic so that's what they do they
[03:10:42.360 --> 03:10:46.680]  link arms they run into you and they say excuse us coming
[03:10:46.680 --> 03:10:50.680]  through excuse us coming through and then they run people on wheelchairs
[03:10:50.680 --> 03:10:55.080]  off into the road people on crutches a brain damage
[03:10:55.080 --> 03:10:58.280]  guy named you know ronnie that i've known for 20 years
[03:10:58.280 --> 03:11:01.880]  local activist but he was hit by a car i mean he's there but he's he's literally
[03:11:01.880 --> 03:11:06.920]  has trouble walking uh literally jacari and others were there had to protect
[03:11:06.920 --> 03:11:09.800]  him i've never seen jacari get so angry he's usually very
[03:11:09.800 --> 03:11:13.560]  very you know um you know calm and you know polite and friendly and restrained
[03:11:13.560 --> 03:11:17.880]  he got really angry see how dare him do that how dare i push back when they
[03:11:17.880 --> 03:11:21.480]  got already running to me four or five times and then he even grabbed my
[03:11:21.480 --> 03:11:25.160]  microphone away and broke it and then ran off okay the police put them in
[03:11:25.160 --> 03:11:28.680]  handcuffs after they caught two of them but then didn't charge them
[03:11:28.680 --> 03:11:31.960]  okay but but but the point is then the media spends it that
[03:11:31.960 --> 03:11:35.240]  that i attacked them and that and that my crew attacked them when they were
[03:11:35.240 --> 03:11:37.960]  clearly attacking us and that's what these people do
[03:11:37.960 --> 03:11:41.240]  excuse us coming through excuse us coming through link their arms where we
[03:11:41.240 --> 03:11:44.120]  were getting the full footage it's what's happened over and over again
[03:11:44.120 --> 03:11:47.400]  and then they were i mean run over secret service agents you'll get out of my
[03:11:47.400 --> 03:11:50.680]  way you name it just crazy they tried to say that the secret
[03:11:50.680 --> 03:11:55.400]  service agent was racist uh you know on and on and on and on
[03:11:55.400 --> 03:11:58.920]  and that guy looked like he was a mixed race but the point is is that this is
[03:11:58.920 --> 03:12:01.800]  an attempt to start a race war in america it's what all are inside intel
[03:12:01.800 --> 03:12:04.920]  saying it's what intel was telling me six years ago
[03:12:04.920 --> 03:12:09.800]  and i didn't believe it uh and now it's happening and this is their plan going
[03:12:09.800 --> 03:12:12.840]  in to the fall in the general election
[03:12:12.840 --> 03:12:15.480]  and maybe even suspend things i don't know if they're going to do it but but
[03:12:15.480 --> 03:12:19.240]  it's it's it's in the cards they're moving it to the front burner
[03:12:19.240 --> 03:12:22.360]  this is a big deal and i think we should go down
[03:12:22.360 --> 03:12:26.520]  obama said yesterday he said well he said today we played the clip earlier we
[03:12:26.520 --> 03:12:28.920]  should play it again he goes i've united people
[03:12:28.920 --> 03:12:32.120]  uh you know you know i haven't divided people all his surrogates have done is
[03:12:32.120 --> 03:12:34.840]  divide people and then he gives every time there's an Easter
[03:12:34.840 --> 03:12:37.240]  statement he goes well there's a lot of bad christians in the world and it's
[03:12:37.240 --> 03:12:40.360]  shameful what christians are doing meanwhile you know
[03:12:40.360 --> 03:12:43.320]  radical muslims are killing millions of people every year literally
[03:12:43.320 --> 03:12:47.880]  this these people hate us folks and it's time for people that like family
[03:12:47.880 --> 03:12:51.480]  and people that like free speech and people that like being christian
[03:12:51.480 --> 03:12:55.000]  or just being in a free country we need to have every race color and creed come
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:57.640]  together and see the manipulation that's happening and let
[03:12:57.640 --> 03:13:00.520]  these social dividers these social engineers using
[03:13:00.520 --> 03:13:03.640]  literal communist tactics to divide and conquer
[03:13:03.640 --> 03:13:07.480]  it's time we realize what rat snakes they are and true total enemies of this
[03:13:07.480 --> 03:13:10.040]  country and they are trying to stir stuff up
[03:13:10.040 --> 03:13:13.880]  they are trying to absolutely infiltrate into these groups they come in one by
[03:13:13.880 --> 03:13:17.800]  one and they all link up 30 40 50 60 100 people and then start
[03:13:17.800 --> 03:13:22.680]  running people down and going excuse me when they plow into your holding hands
[03:13:22.680 --> 03:13:26.120]  i have personally had an anarchist do this to me four times
[03:13:26.120 --> 03:13:29.640]  it's on tape i've had the devil worshiping communists do it in their
[03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:32.760]  own words devil worshiping communists this is who we're facing
[03:13:32.760 --> 03:13:38.040]  devil worshiping communist and then these black lives matter folks are brainwashed
[03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:40.520]  in the schools told they don't have any money or any
[03:13:40.520 --> 03:13:45.160]  future not because of globalism but because some poor white plumber is in
[03:13:45.160 --> 03:13:48.120]  the donald trump rally they are turning us against each other
[03:13:48.120 --> 03:13:50.840]  now i don't think the people in black lives matter are devil worshipers
[03:13:50.840 --> 03:13:55.000]  they are brainwashed uh folks from the public school system but they're led
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  by social agitators community organizers from the ford foundation
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:03.080]  the rockefeller foundation this song on record by the way folks just look it up
[03:14:03.080 --> 03:14:07.240]  and and and of course george soros and never forget
[03:14:07.240 --> 03:14:11.720]  never forget this is the key he soros quarterback
[03:14:11.720 --> 03:14:16.360]  syria the arab spring and what's happening in ukraine these people aren't
[03:14:16.360 --> 03:14:20.280]  playing games they're causing a worldwide meltdown
[03:14:20.280 --> 03:14:24.280]  suffering in one world government and i'm telling you i'm gonna go find i'm
[03:14:24.280 --> 03:14:27.160]  gonna start one of black lives matter meetings i'm gonna go in these meetings
[03:14:27.160 --> 03:14:30.520]  i'm gonna say who's the controller who's manipulating these people which one of
[03:14:30.520 --> 03:14:34.040]  you is the foundation operative i used to say feds that's not
[03:14:34.040 --> 03:14:36.680]  what it is it's the feds are just there monitoring
[03:14:36.680 --> 03:14:39.960]  sometimes they stir stuff up but not often usually it's a fed who's also a
[03:14:39.960 --> 03:14:43.880]  foundation operative it is a fed and we need to just start getting in there
[03:14:43.880 --> 03:14:47.560]  and getting to these young people and going don't you understand what they're
[03:14:47.560 --> 03:14:52.920]  doing don't you see the plan we we cannot let these idiots do this
[03:14:52.920 --> 03:14:55.720]  some of these young people i've talked to them they go oh man you're just scared
[03:14:55.720 --> 03:15:00.040]  of you we're taking over that isn't how it works the new world order took over
[03:15:00.040 --> 03:15:04.280]  it puts poison in your water silly it's the one that doubles your unemployment
[03:15:04.280 --> 03:15:07.080]  it's the one that wants to kill everybody in the womb
[03:15:07.080 --> 03:15:12.280]  it's time now folks to say no to the globalist divide and conquer race for
[03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:16.440]  it's time and then they'll say oh but trump trump was to control the borders
[03:15:16.440 --> 03:15:19.880]  and trump doesn't you know he doesn't want muslims being brought in until they
[03:15:19.880 --> 03:15:22.680]  vet him and we gotta have borders as a country
[03:15:22.680 --> 03:15:26.520]  they take the most basic stuff and act like it's racist and then you've got
[03:15:26.520 --> 03:15:30.520]  all these groups in cambridge england they're taking down a bronze rooster
[03:15:30.520 --> 03:15:33.880]  from africa saying because it came from africa it was stolen
[03:15:33.880 --> 03:15:37.320]  this is they want to take down stuff from the british empire now
[03:15:37.320 --> 03:15:39.880]  but they don't want to fight the current new world order empire
[03:15:39.880 --> 03:15:43.240]  that sees whole roads set up out of the british empire no they're actually
[03:15:43.240 --> 03:15:47.560]  carrying that out so so the very empire that that is running
[03:15:47.560 --> 03:15:50.920]  all this is letting its very symbols being taken down because it's going to
[03:15:50.920 --> 03:15:54.600]  take every nation and every culture symbol and take everyone's
[03:15:54.600 --> 03:15:58.200]  right to any speech away this is a final takeover day that i'm gonna hand it
[03:15:58.200 --> 03:16:01.320]  back to you and callers but we play the footage coming up and they're all over
[03:16:01.320 --> 03:16:05.320]  every channel it's a full media push the heroes that were in their yelling and
[03:16:05.320 --> 03:16:09.160]  screaming and pushing people somebody co-cocked one of them and so it's the
[03:16:09.160 --> 03:16:12.440]  end of the world it's the devil whites again they're the
[03:16:12.440 --> 03:16:16.360]  propaganda standards said if you're white you don't know what it's like to be
[03:16:16.360 --> 03:16:19.560]  poor and by the way we had a lot of videos and a lot of images coming from
[03:16:19.560 --> 03:16:22.280]  that contest i'm not going to announce it today i don't think yet because they
[03:16:22.280 --> 03:16:24.600]  haven't organized them and i want to promote them on facebook and twitter
[03:16:24.600 --> 03:16:27.800]  but i want to get a status update on that i probably announced it sunday but
[03:16:27.800 --> 03:16:32.280]  info wars dot com prison planet dot com and the reason i sound so excited
[03:16:32.280 --> 03:16:35.480]  is because i might like this one i'm not on here it's because this is so desperate
[03:16:35.480 --> 03:16:40.120]  this is so real this is so hardcore this is so historic this is so over the top
[03:16:40.120 --> 03:16:44.520]  this is the key time in history folks we get the word out on this we can have the
[03:16:44.520 --> 03:16:48.200]  enemies move back fire on them and defeat the globalists but if we don't
[03:16:48.200 --> 03:16:51.400]  they are more i'm more certain than ever they're going to go with full attempted
[03:16:51.400 --> 03:16:54.440]  civil unrest it's already popping up all over austin
[03:16:54.440 --> 03:16:58.280]  i've seen it friends have seen it it is it is despicable whites are being attacked
[03:16:58.280 --> 03:17:01.960]  everywhere it is incredible and it's so sad it's going to create so much
[03:17:01.960 --> 03:17:05.800]  division that christians mainly abolitionists and others
[03:17:05.800 --> 03:17:09.160]  work so hard to try to end and martin Luther king's work and so many other
[03:17:09.160 --> 03:17:12.840]  people's work is being flushed down with toilet by these wicked devils right now
[03:17:12.840 --> 03:17:17.080]  and the people claiming to be anti-racist are the very globalist controller
[03:17:17.080 --> 03:17:20.520]  filth and they know they're doing it remember that burning standards
[03:17:20.520 --> 03:17:24.040]  all these people george soros they know what they're doing hillary clinton
[03:17:24.040 --> 03:17:27.960]  david night back to you yeah alex and of course as i was coming in this morning
[03:17:27.960 --> 03:17:31.560]  i heard a headline i was in the new york times washington post talking about how
[03:17:31.560 --> 03:17:33.560]  the most dangerous place to be in the world
[03:17:33.560 --> 03:17:37.160]  is at a donald trump rally that's the way they're trying to spend this
[03:17:37.160 --> 03:17:40.840]  we have an article here from the washington examiner brian york says
[03:17:40.840 --> 03:17:44.360]  this is what the protester problem really is and he starts out by talking
[03:17:44.360 --> 03:17:48.120]  about how many people showed up at the obama rallies when he was running for
[03:17:48.120 --> 03:17:51.000]  president the first time now we have that same situation again with
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:54.760]  donald trump actually larger crowds and he said there's a difference though
[03:17:54.760 --> 03:17:59.560]  when obama was running there were not people who were conservatives who are
[03:17:59.560 --> 03:18:02.680]  systematically disrupting senator obama's rallies
[03:18:02.680 --> 03:18:06.120]  okay and to dominate the press coverage but now the far left is doing that and
[03:18:06.120 --> 03:18:10.680]  he talks about how this works how he witnessed this at one of the events
[03:18:10.680 --> 03:18:14.520]  here's how they do this the protesters come to the events many of them
[03:18:14.520 --> 03:18:17.640]  affiliated with soros's black lives matter movement
[03:18:17.640 --> 03:18:20.680]  they have a technique they come to the rally they settle into the crowd then
[03:18:20.680 --> 03:18:23.720]  one of them begins yelling loudly causing the crowd to react usually with a
[03:18:23.720 --> 03:18:27.160]  chant of trump trump trump and then the protester tries to make
[03:18:27.160 --> 03:18:32.520]  the inevitable security removal as long and as noisy as possible
[03:18:32.520 --> 03:18:35.800]  once they finally get that guy out then they take another process
[03:18:35.800 --> 03:18:38.920]  another protester stands up and repeats the process
[03:18:38.920 --> 03:18:43.320]  you see these people are coming in and it's kind of a way to be passive
[03:18:43.320 --> 03:18:47.160]  aggressive okay that's what they're but the emphasis is really on the aggressive
[03:18:47.160 --> 03:18:49.160]  there's not too much that's passive about that
[03:18:49.160 --> 03:18:52.840]  it's a plan they want to make it about the disruption
[03:18:52.840 --> 03:18:56.600]  that's what they want to make the story about they want to try to portray
[03:18:56.600 --> 03:19:00.680]  trump and his followers as fascist and of course
[03:19:00.680 --> 03:19:04.840]  that's what this has been about from the very beginning as soon as donald trump
[03:19:04.840 --> 03:19:07.640]  pushed back against the globalist agenda
[03:19:07.640 --> 03:19:11.000]  of removing nations removing national borders
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:15.240]  taking down the nations creating a one-world government from that perspective
[03:19:15.240 --> 03:19:19.160]  as well as the trade issues as well as the climate treaties which will create a
[03:19:19.160 --> 03:19:24.840]  global tax to fund a global governance but when he started pushing back against
[03:19:24.840 --> 03:19:29.000]  removing the borders removing nations because that's what's going on
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:33.240]  in america as well as europe their response was to say
[03:19:33.240 --> 03:19:37.800]  racist because that's always the response if they don't have a way to fight you
[03:19:37.800 --> 03:19:39.880]  on that they'll talk about that and we're going to go back to your phone
[03:19:39.880 --> 03:19:43.800]  calls we're also going to talk a little bit about this endorsement by by
[03:19:43.800 --> 03:19:47.160]  ben carson of donald trump because i think one of the things that hasn't been
[03:19:47.160 --> 03:19:50.760]  talked about is the excellent health care reform plan that donald
[03:19:50.760 --> 03:19:53.400]  trump has put out there maybe they will talk about that
[03:19:53.400 --> 03:19:56.840]  when uh ben carson starts to be a spokesperson for him stay with us we'll be
[03:19:56.840 --> 03:20:04.200]  right back i'm nick sobaleski a select quote agent
[03:20:04.200 --> 03:20:07.880]  with a true story of how select quote goes to bat for you by in term life
[03:20:07.880 --> 03:20:11.080]  insurance a while back a man called me who had had
[03:20:11.080 --> 03:20:14.360]  prostate cancer he asked if i could beat a very high
[03:20:14.360 --> 03:20:18.920]  quote another life insurance agent had given him i said let me see

[03:25:25.960 --> 03:25:30.360]  sure how old this news report was unfortunately i don't remember the date
[03:25:30.360 --> 03:25:37.480]  but it said that uh basically the uh attorney general had gone on
[03:25:37.480 --> 03:25:44.040]  basically stumping um the term is correct using using the power for
[03:25:44.040 --> 03:25:49.640]  office and cbs is uh cbs is
[03:25:49.640 --> 03:25:55.720]  uh media media power as well to promote the idea that
[03:25:55.720 --> 03:26:00.440]  they're they're just trying to they just want something really easy to do very
[03:26:00.440 --> 03:26:02.920]  simple it's just something that anybody should
[03:26:02.920 --> 03:26:07.240]  anybody should basically bow down and ask you know it'll allow this to be done
[03:26:07.240 --> 03:26:11.000]  and are you talking about the iphone access to the iphone cameras what is it
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:13.960]  you're talking about correct correct well correct i mean well basically what i'm
[03:26:13.960 --> 03:26:18.680]  talking about is breaking in using using the the power
[03:26:18.680 --> 03:26:22.920]  well using what she was talking about essentially was using the power of the
[03:26:22.920 --> 03:26:25.880]  public to come in from the other side
[03:26:25.880 --> 03:26:29.320]  is the government on one side and the public on the other side as a as a
[03:26:29.320 --> 03:26:32.920]  as a pincher movement against free enterprise against
[03:26:32.920 --> 03:26:39.320]  privacy a privacy and um and people's uh people's right to privacy
[03:26:39.320 --> 03:26:43.320]  yeah they don't believe we have a right to privacy unless we say that that's
[03:26:43.320 --> 03:26:47.320]  the ability to kill our children that's the only privacy that they want to give
[03:26:47.320 --> 03:26:51.480]  us if we want to kill our children and buy into their eugenics movement
[03:26:51.480 --> 03:26:55.480]  okay we'll call that a right to privacy but if you want privacy
[03:26:55.480 --> 03:26:59.800]  the real privacy that is there in the fourth amendment to
[03:26:59.800 --> 03:27:03.240]  you know privacy in your personal effects your your papers that sort of
[03:27:03.240 --> 03:27:06.600]  thing which is clearly what this is i mean that yeah they didn't say anything
[03:27:06.600 --> 03:27:10.520]  about iphone's and the constitution it's a general principle we understand what
[03:27:10.520 --> 03:27:12.680]  that's about they want to come after us with that
[03:27:12.680 --> 03:27:16.360]  and of course there's this article today i'll get your comments on this too but
[03:27:16.360 --> 03:27:20.120]  the fbi could force us to turn on iphone cameras and microphones says apple
[03:27:20.120 --> 03:27:23.560]  that's the company's head of services eddie q talking about that goes where
[03:27:23.560 --> 03:27:27.320]  will this stop well they do this in a divorce case in an immigration
[03:27:27.320 --> 03:27:30.520]  case in a tax case someday somebody will be able to turn on a
[03:27:30.520 --> 03:27:34.360]  phone's microphone that shouldn't happen in this country well the news is is
[03:27:34.360 --> 03:27:37.720]  that they're already doing that folks the nsa has been doing that because they
[03:27:37.720 --> 03:27:41.080]  don't really care what the laws are they don't care about search warrants
[03:27:41.080 --> 03:27:45.720]  the faiza uh court uh the foreign intelligence surveillance act that was
[03:27:45.720 --> 03:27:50.120]  created to stop the nsa from spying on our conversations
[03:27:50.120 --> 03:27:54.040]  from illegally wiretapping us without a search warrant that was going on
[03:27:54.040 --> 03:27:58.600]  prior to the the church and pike commission hearings in the 70s so they
[03:27:58.600 --> 03:28:02.920]  created the faiza uh court and now the faiza court has become a secret
[03:28:02.920 --> 03:28:05.480]  star chamber rubber stamp for these people do whatever they want to in
[03:28:05.480 --> 03:28:08.840]  terms of domestic surveillance that's what they do they turn everything
[03:28:08.840 --> 03:28:12.120]  upside down the thing that was meant to constrain them
[03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:15.880]  has now become their secret star chamber and so that's that's really what
[03:28:15.880 --> 03:28:20.520]  they're going to do tem right like we said the thing that's meant to constrain
[03:28:20.520 --> 03:28:23.320]  them has become their star chamber but i think the thing
[03:28:23.320 --> 03:28:27.160]  essentially the thing that was meant to constrain them was the american public
[03:28:27.160 --> 03:28:31.000]  the american populace having having a brain in their head
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:35.080]  having having an understanding of the constitution having an understanding of
[03:28:35.080 --> 03:28:37.960]  a personal freedom and having an understanding that the government is
[03:28:37.960 --> 03:28:42.360]  only it's supposed to be one very limited extremely limited in
[03:28:42.360 --> 03:28:46.040]  in its ability what we have though is we have
[03:28:46.040 --> 03:28:50.200]  as i've said many times and everyone everyone on our shows is obviously
[03:28:50.200 --> 03:28:53.640]  said many times we have runaway federal government we have
[03:28:53.640 --> 03:28:57.400]  we have um as i've used this analogy before we
[03:28:57.400 --> 03:29:01.160]  what we had before with us was somebody throwing
[03:29:01.160 --> 03:29:05.320]  a few grains of sand at us and say this is how many laws that you have to have
[03:29:05.320 --> 03:29:08.920]  and then it was a handful of sand and it was a then it was a bucket full of sand
[03:29:08.920 --> 03:29:12.200]  and now it's now it's truckloads of sand being dumped
[03:29:12.200 --> 03:29:15.720]  straight on top of our heads and we know we can't fight that we can't even we
[03:29:15.720 --> 03:29:18.520]  can i agree i'll give you another analogy tem
[03:29:18.520 --> 03:29:21.320]  you know we talk about the federal government i call it the feral government
[03:29:21.320 --> 03:29:26.360]  like a pack of wild dogs we all i love dogs and most people do love dogs uh
[03:29:26.360 --> 03:29:30.360]  the federal government is not your pet puppy okay it's more like uh
[03:29:30.360 --> 03:29:33.880]  a bunch of a pack of wild dogs that used to be domesticated
[03:29:33.880 --> 03:29:38.120]  and now they're running in a wild feral pack and they will tear your throat out
[03:29:38.120 --> 03:29:42.280]  if you don't stop them and we have to find a way to collectively stop them
[03:29:42.280 --> 03:29:44.680]  to collectively stand up for our individual rights stay with us and be
[03:29:44.680 --> 03:29:47.800]  right back with more of your phone calls

[03:30:16.920 --> 03:30:20.520]  fighter and drone swarms the announcement also represents another
[03:30:20.520 --> 03:30:24.600]  step toward total autonomous military robotics a technology that top experts
[03:30:24.600 --> 03:30:28.520]  such as elon musk and max tegmark have been warning scientists to think twice
[03:30:28.520 --> 03:30:31.640]  about sco also said in the same announcement they have successfully
[03:30:31.640 --> 03:30:35.560]  developed and tested avatar flight technology our new project not
[03:30:35.560 --> 03:30:39.240]  previously reported is called avatar and calls for the pentagon to pair high
[03:30:39.240 --> 03:30:43.240]  tech fifth generation fighter jets with unmanned versions of older jets which

[03:33:12.600 --> 03:33:16.440]  it's alex jones
[03:33:16.440 --> 03:33:19.320]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david and i we're just talking to a
[03:33:19.320 --> 03:33:23.720]  caller about the iphone issue and of course the story that's
[03:33:23.720 --> 03:33:28.520]  out today apple saying hey if we allow them to get away with this they there
[03:33:28.520 --> 03:33:31.800]  will be the day when they can demand that we turn on a phone's camera or
[03:33:31.800 --> 03:33:35.480]  microphone for them and maybe it'd be something like a divorce case immigration
[03:33:35.480 --> 03:33:39.160]  case a tax case who knows look you have to understand
[03:33:39.160 --> 03:33:42.920]  that apple and these other products whether they
[03:33:42.920 --> 03:33:45.960]  are cooperating with this or not the fbi maybe
[03:33:45.960 --> 03:33:49.880]  is uh i don't know they probably have the access to this as well certainly the
[03:33:49.880 --> 03:33:53.080]  nsa can look at these phones without with or without
[03:33:53.080 --> 03:33:56.040]  apple's help and of course there's been indications through prism and other
[03:33:56.040 --> 03:34:00.520]  things that were leaked from snowden that they have got back doors into this
[03:34:00.520 --> 03:34:04.920]  already what they're trying to do is openly create a precedent
[03:34:04.920 --> 03:34:09.480]  we've had snowden as well as john mackafee both say look i can open that
[03:34:09.480 --> 03:34:13.880]  phone for you you don't need to force them to create custom
[03:34:13.880 --> 03:34:17.560]  software for you because that's what's really at stake here i mean this is not
[03:34:17.560 --> 03:34:21.800]  just uh going in and grabbing the information they want custom
[03:34:21.800 --> 03:34:25.720]  software demanded for the created for them on demand the government so they
[03:34:25.720 --> 03:34:30.040]  can spy on us it's just incredible how up front
[03:34:30.040 --> 03:34:33.640]  and over the top they are to our face about this now and of course
[03:34:33.640 --> 03:34:37.960]  remember the snowden uh slides that came out they were released in germany they
[03:34:37.960 --> 03:34:40.840]  didn't get as much press here in the united states but there was a series of
[03:34:40.840 --> 03:34:44.360]  three slides i thought were very telling there was a picture and it said
[03:34:44.360 --> 03:34:47.240]  remember back in 1984 and they showed the iconic
[03:34:47.240 --> 03:34:52.360]  1984 commercial that apple aired uh during the super bowl 1984 to talk about
[03:34:52.360 --> 03:34:56.200]  the uh the mac that was going to be produced
[03:34:56.200 --> 03:34:59.480]  and they show that the first i remember back in 1984 who would have thought in
[03:34:59.480 --> 03:35:02.280]  1984 because that's when the mac came out that's when that commercial aired and
[03:35:02.280 --> 03:35:05.960]  that was what it uh relayed to who would have thought
[03:35:05.960 --> 03:35:10.280]  that this would become big brother and they show a picture of steve jobs
[03:35:10.280 --> 03:35:14.760]  holding up the iphone and of course it's not just the iphone
[03:35:14.760 --> 03:35:19.000]  it's all of the phone manufacturers and then the third one was
[03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:23.560]  and the people would line up to pay for it see that's the key
[03:35:23.560 --> 03:35:28.040]  you are buying your own surveillance technology
[03:35:28.040 --> 03:35:31.800]  and uh now we've got a senate bill will impose fines on tech companies that
[03:35:31.800 --> 03:35:34.520]  refuse to unlock smartphones there you go there's diane
[03:35:34.520 --> 03:35:38.920]  feinstein our favorite statist uh coming up with a bill to try to
[03:35:38.920 --> 03:35:42.440]  penalize people like uh apple on this issue
[03:35:42.440 --> 03:35:46.600]  look here's what's going to happen these things are either going to go away
[03:35:46.600 --> 03:35:50.520]  or people are going to find software that is going to continue to defeat the
[03:35:50.520 --> 03:35:53.400]  encryption or something you'll never be completely safe as long as you have
[03:35:53.400 --> 03:35:55.800]  these devices you need to understand what's involved
[03:35:55.800 --> 03:35:59.000]  with the internet of things you need to understand how far
[03:35:59.000 --> 03:36:04.600]  more dangerous this is going to be once they begin to do this to your cars
[03:36:04.600 --> 03:36:08.200]  connectivity as they call it is the big push right now with all the car
[03:36:08.200 --> 03:36:10.840]  manufacturers yeah it's a feature they can sell to you
[03:36:10.840 --> 03:36:14.120]  it's a feature the government will mandate to you
[03:36:14.120 --> 03:36:18.280]  uh it's a a new thing so you know it goes along with the self-driving cars and
[03:36:18.280 --> 03:36:22.840]  so forth and so on you can sit there and and they can spy on you while you uh
[03:36:22.840 --> 03:36:26.280]  tweet and and go through facebook but it's all
[03:36:26.280 --> 03:36:29.720]  about tracking you we've tried to make this abundantly clear we talked about
[03:36:29.720 --> 03:36:34.680]  this repetitively the biggest and fastest growing area of the
[03:36:34.680 --> 03:36:39.800]  military industrial complex is geospatial intelligence geospatial
[03:36:39.800 --> 03:36:44.360]  intelligence james clapper uh was the head of the geospatial intelligence
[03:36:44.360 --> 03:36:46.840]  within the government he's been the keynote speaker at their trade
[03:36:46.840 --> 03:36:49.240]  organizations there's the biggest meetings that they have
[03:36:49.240 --> 03:36:53.480]  within the intelligence community it's all about activity based intelligence
[03:36:53.480 --> 03:36:57.000]  human domain analytics does that sound familiar mastering the human domain
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:37:00.520]  we talked about jade helm they want to know who you are
[03:37:00.520 --> 03:37:05.400]  who you know what you do where you are what your political beliefs are what
[03:37:05.400 --> 03:37:07.720]  your religious beliefs are they want to map this
[03:37:07.720 --> 03:37:12.360]  into a great big uh geographical map overlaying
[03:37:12.360 --> 03:37:16.440]  you and your beliefs with the geography and that's why they want the metadata
[03:37:16.440 --> 03:37:19.080]  they kept telling us oh it's just metadata it's not important we're not
[03:37:19.080 --> 03:37:22.760]  actually transcribing your phone calls you know what the metadata tells them
[03:37:22.760 --> 03:37:26.440]  more than your phone conversations they don't really care about transcribing
[03:37:26.440 --> 03:37:29.800]  your phone conversations they want your metadata that's the
[03:37:29.800 --> 03:37:33.640]  activity based intelligence and once they do that they're going to
[03:37:33.640 --> 03:37:36.760]  analyze you fit you into the human domain
[03:37:36.760 --> 03:37:40.120]  and then they're going to map you on there put you on a
[03:37:40.120 --> 03:37:43.160]  real map that's what the geospatial intelligence is about
[03:37:43.160 --> 03:37:47.560]  it is total spectrum dominance it is total tyranny
[03:37:47.560 --> 03:37:51.240]  they will control your movements with these cars they will tax and track
[03:37:51.240 --> 03:37:54.680]  everything you do the internet of things is dangerous enough but when they
[03:37:54.680 --> 03:37:58.200]  create vehicle to infrastructure communication devices that are
[03:37:58.200 --> 03:38:01.320]  going to be mandated on your cars pretty soon nobody else is talking about it
[03:38:01.320 --> 03:38:04.520]  we need to get this out people need to start talking about this
[03:38:04.520 --> 03:38:09.160]  vehicle to vehicle communication devices as well as vehicle to infrastructure
[03:38:09.160 --> 03:38:12.280]  they're going to be talking not only to the stop signs to give you tickets
[03:38:12.280 --> 03:38:15.800]  not only to the speeding signs which will be basically issuing you tickets
[03:38:15.800 --> 03:38:19.720]  but to your insurance company they'll be talking to the NSA the FBI
[03:38:19.720 --> 03:38:23.160]  and once they put all this stuff together they're going to be looking
[03:38:23.160 --> 03:38:26.200]  for patterns of behavior and that's when it gets really dangerous that's when
[03:38:26.200 --> 03:38:30.680]  you get into your minority report type of situation
[03:38:30.680 --> 03:38:35.800]  where they look at you and by an algorithm they identify you as an enemy
[03:38:35.800 --> 03:38:40.040]  of the state we can't let this happen
[03:38:40.040 --> 03:38:43.240]  people have to wake up and the best hope that i've seen
[03:38:43.240 --> 03:38:47.080]  is this article that we covered a couple of days ago
[03:38:47.080 --> 03:38:53.160]  where they did a survey of people talked specifically to a lot of younger people
[03:38:53.160 --> 03:38:57.560]  millennials people in their early to mid 20s who said hey i don't want to
[03:38:57.560 --> 03:39:00.920]  i don't want a self-driving car i don't want this thing taking over my life
[03:39:00.920 --> 03:39:04.120]  i don't want the government controlling and monitoring my movements
[03:39:04.120 --> 03:39:07.800]  and i don't want something that can be taken over in a malicious way
[03:39:07.800 --> 03:39:13.880]  by an individual or by a group of people uh let me go to uh jim in minnesota jim
[03:39:13.880 --> 03:39:19.400]  go ahead hi david hi i just want to say hi to uh
[03:39:19.400 --> 03:39:23.720]  alex jones as well i i know he's listening um
[03:39:23.720 --> 03:39:28.040]  you know i wish you guys would do something for me a request
[03:39:28.040 --> 03:39:31.880]  you really opened my eyes back about three or four months ago
[03:39:31.880 --> 03:39:37.800]  with your video of a general michael hayden and his smug look on his face
[03:39:37.800 --> 03:39:42.120]  talking to some class of snoopers about how it
[03:39:42.120 --> 03:39:45.880]  they don't just listen to you know terrorist calls and he smiles
[03:39:45.880 --> 03:39:50.280]  because we listen to interesting people yeah yeah now
[03:39:50.280 --> 03:39:53.880]  how this guy right before super tuesday a couple weeks ago
[03:39:53.880 --> 03:39:57.880]  got on every single news show as some sort of commentator and it was all the
[03:39:57.880 --> 03:40:02.840]  same line to whoever the host was it was anti trump
[03:40:02.840 --> 03:40:08.920]  that brings me back in my mind to well maybe in 2010 or 11 or 12 or 13 when
[03:40:08.920 --> 03:40:12.360]  this guy was the head of the nsa and he so
[03:40:12.360 --> 03:40:17.960]  joyously loves snooping on people and he's so thrilled with it that maybe
[03:40:17.960 --> 03:40:22.840]  they were listening to donald trump so why the news networks
[03:40:22.840 --> 03:40:25.720]  oh you can bet they listen to donald trump yeah they will listen to all of us
[03:40:25.720 --> 03:40:28.040]  but you can bet they listen to donald trump yeah
[03:40:28.040 --> 03:40:32.280]  well he's interesting what you say oh yeah i would say just i would say jesse
[03:40:32.280 --> 03:40:37.400]  ventura is very interesting too now that's what stopped me from one ever
[03:40:37.400 --> 03:40:40.440]  be a politician in my life because i knew about this years ago
[03:40:40.440 --> 03:40:44.440]  that every email every text everything you go to on a website now
[03:40:44.440 --> 03:40:48.680]  it's going somewhere and whenever the new world order the globalist people want
[03:40:48.680 --> 03:40:51.240]  to destroy a person they can do it through the press
[03:40:51.240 --> 03:40:54.200]  they can do it through just an oppositional candidate
[03:40:54.200 --> 03:40:57.880]  they can know information about you that is supposed to be completely private
[03:40:57.880 --> 03:41:01.960]  and this is it's destroyed my belief that i could have been something
[03:41:01.960 --> 03:41:05.000]  politically in this country i have just given up that hope
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:08.520]  but well you know because they can do that they can do that jim to supreme
[03:41:08.520 --> 03:41:11.880]  court justices and i believe that they have i mean we've had a
[03:41:11.880 --> 03:41:15.720]  a couple of indications that they had looked at
[03:41:15.720 --> 03:41:20.120]  ruth abader ginsberg as well as john roberts and we had said a long time ago
[03:41:20.120 --> 03:41:23.800]  when you look at this obama care decision saying that a mandate
[03:41:23.800 --> 03:41:28.200]  to buy something was constitutional for the federal government to impose on us
[03:41:28.200 --> 03:41:32.440]  i mean absolutely not constitutional on its face we understood that
[03:41:32.440 --> 03:41:35.640]  but what was strange about it was that john roberts wrote
[03:41:35.640 --> 03:41:39.160]  an opinion says no a mandate is not constitutional and then
[03:41:39.160 --> 03:41:43.080]  he wrote the majority opinion reversed himself completely
[03:41:43.080 --> 03:41:47.080]  and said no it is i don't know of any other situation where you've had
[03:41:47.080 --> 03:41:50.600]  a justice right both the dissenting and the concurring
[03:41:50.600 --> 03:41:54.760]  opinion of the majority and so a lot of us believed since the other one was
[03:41:54.760 --> 03:41:58.040]  written first and the word on the street was no it's going to be five four
[03:41:58.040 --> 03:42:02.920]  against a mandate and then all of a sudden it became five four for a mandate
[03:42:02.920 --> 03:42:07.240]  most of us believe that he was blackmailed as well
[03:42:07.240 --> 03:42:11.080]  it's quite possible that he is a globalist and he's probably a former cfr
[03:42:11.080 --> 03:42:14.200]  member and all that just to be in that position but
[03:42:14.200 --> 03:42:17.320]  the favor i have that i would ask your uh you know
[03:42:17.320 --> 03:42:22.520]  info wars nightly news show is when it comes to general michael hayden
[03:42:22.520 --> 03:42:26.680]  can use from now on whenever you use clips of him instead of using general
[03:42:26.680 --> 03:42:29.400]  in front of his name because that's supposed to be an honorary title this
[03:42:29.400 --> 03:42:33.640]  guy is a nerdy hip squeak who's the biggest
[03:42:33.640 --> 03:42:39.560]  peeping tom in the history of mankind and just put instead of general just
[03:42:39.560 --> 03:42:44.840]  scratch it out and put world's best known peeping tom
[03:42:44.840 --> 03:42:49.080]  general michael or you know michael hayden comma peeping tom
[03:42:49.080 --> 03:42:51.640]  that's a good idea and you know the other thing from that washington and lee
[03:42:51.640 --> 03:42:54.920]  speech that really stuck out to me was the and i can't remember i think it's
[03:42:54.920 --> 03:42:58.520]  section 213 that they claim gives them authority to
[03:42:58.520 --> 03:43:01.880]  violate the constitution he said hey i didn't need that
[03:43:01.880 --> 03:43:06.520]  i had orders from the president sneering at everybody okay and then as you're
[03:43:06.520 --> 03:43:09.320]  pointing out just before super tuesday they trot him out
[03:43:09.320 --> 03:43:13.400]  to criticize donald trump on waterboarding position
[03:43:13.400 --> 03:43:18.680]  okay now this is the guy who as head first he was head of the nsa appointed
[03:43:18.680 --> 03:43:22.760]  by clinton then george w bush appointed him head of the cia and under
[03:43:22.760 --> 03:43:27.320]  his watch was when we had the enhanced interrogation
[03:43:27.320 --> 03:43:31.080]  that they called the torture techniques so here's a guy who actually did the
[03:43:31.080 --> 03:43:34.840]  torture calling out somebody who thinks that hey i think that's an
[03:43:34.840 --> 03:43:38.440]  effective tactic maybe we ought to change the laws and bring it back
[03:43:38.440 --> 03:43:42.520]  okay putting himself on a moral high horse but also i think
[03:43:42.520 --> 03:43:46.680]  trying to give himself some plausible deniability trying to isolate and
[03:43:46.680 --> 03:43:50.600]  insulate himself from being an international war criminal because he
[03:43:50.600 --> 03:43:54.280]  did violate international law mark michael hayden was a part of that he
[03:43:54.280 --> 03:43:57.640]  was part of covering up and he also said let's
[03:43:57.640 --> 03:44:01.640]  not allow any of these documents to go out we cannot
[03:44:01.640 --> 03:44:05.480]  let anything that we said or did about these this enhanced interrogation come
[03:44:05.480 --> 03:44:09.400]  out so he squashed all of that and now he's out there parading around on a
[03:44:09.400 --> 03:44:13.640]  moral high horse as if he doesn't believe in torture yeah right
[03:44:13.640 --> 03:44:17.000]  i want to go to a special report before we go any more calls this is something
[03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:20.600]  that i think is very interesting we had a caller earlier talking about in the
[03:44:20.600 --> 03:44:25.160]  in the debate last night how john casick again showed that he was a neocon
[03:44:25.160 --> 03:44:28.200]  warmonger just like ted cruise just like marco rubio
[03:44:28.200 --> 03:44:31.960]  anywhere they can they want to get into a conflict and of course the first thing
[03:44:31.960 --> 03:44:36.280]  they want to do is to project strength when i want to talk to anybody
[03:44:36.280 --> 03:44:40.120]  if you want to talk to somebody then you know you're a friend of a communist
[03:44:40.120 --> 03:44:43.400]  you don't want to try to deescalate a situation
[03:44:43.400 --> 03:44:48.120]  no we want to have a no fly zone declared over syria we don't want to get
[03:44:48.120 --> 03:44:51.480]  the approval of the u.s congress as leon panetta said when he was
[03:44:51.480 --> 03:44:54.200]  questioned by senator sessions and senator sessions said
[03:44:54.200 --> 03:44:57.080]  well who's going to give you that permission in your mind and goes well
[03:44:57.080 --> 03:45:01.240]  we'd go to the u.n or we would go to nato and he goes i can't believe what i
[03:45:01.240 --> 03:45:04.200]  just heard said senator sessions you were a congressman
[03:45:04.200 --> 03:45:07.560]  leon panetta you know what the constitution says you're supposed to get
[03:45:07.560 --> 03:45:10.840]  that authorization from congress they don't want the authorization from
[03:45:10.840 --> 03:45:13.880]  congress they want to take orders from the globalist
[03:45:13.880 --> 03:45:17.720]  regimes that they have set up they want these wars to promote
[03:45:17.720 --> 03:45:21.240]  globalism to promote their wars for profit and
[03:45:21.240 --> 03:45:25.000]  they are not concerned about our safety if they were they wouldn't continue to
[03:45:25.000 --> 03:45:28.280]  create these wars let's take a look at what's going on in the korean peninsula
[03:45:28.280 --> 03:45:31.720]  we got a special report from rob Jacobson
[03:45:31.720 --> 03:45:37.080]  tensions between north korea and the western world are escalating once again
[03:45:37.080 --> 03:45:40.520]  this time the democratic people's republic of korea
[03:45:40.520 --> 03:45:44.840]  threatened a preemptive and offensive nuclear strike
[03:45:44.840 --> 03:45:50.920]  this statement was made in response to joint u.s south korea exercises operations
[03:45:50.920 --> 03:45:54.600]  key resolve and full eagle have begun and they will
[03:45:54.600 --> 03:45:58.840]  continue until april 30th the state run north korean
[03:45:58.840 --> 03:46:03.000]  central news agency published a statement that says
[03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:08.440]  as the joint military exercises to be staged by the enemies are regarded as
[03:46:08.440 --> 03:46:11.800]  the most undisguised nuclear war drills
[03:46:11.800 --> 03:46:15.800]  aimed to infringe upon the sovereignty of the dpr k
[03:46:15.800 --> 03:46:22.600]  its military counteraction will be more preemptive and offensive nuclear strikes
[03:46:22.600 --> 03:46:26.760]  meanwhile the white house says they are closely monitoring the situation
[03:46:26.760 --> 03:46:31.720]  we urge north korea to refrain from proactive actions and statements that
[03:46:31.720 --> 03:46:35.640]  aggravate tensions and instead focus on fulfilling its
[03:46:35.640 --> 03:46:39.160]  international obligations and commitments said a senior
[03:46:39.160 --> 03:46:42.920]  administration official saber rattling is not uncommon for
[03:46:42.920 --> 03:46:46.120]  north korea especially around this time for annual
[03:46:46.120 --> 03:46:50.440]  military exercises cnn's international correspondent paula
[03:46:50.440 --> 03:46:54.840]  handcock says they have threatened this before and these kinds of threats are to
[03:46:54.840 --> 03:46:58.920]  be expected this time of year well amra i think this is certainly
[03:46:58.920 --> 03:47:02.680]  being expected because this is going to be the first day of
[03:47:02.680 --> 03:47:06.040]  those joint military drills between the u.s and south korea
[03:47:06.040 --> 03:47:09.800]  every single year these irritate pyeongyang they see them as a
[03:47:09.800 --> 03:47:14.840]  an address rehearsal to an invasion which is why every year we see the rhetoric
[03:47:14.840 --> 03:47:19.240]  increasing of course this year it's it's more tense than usual because
[03:47:19.240 --> 03:47:23.080]  of the backdrop of course we have the un sanctions that were just passed last
[03:47:23.080 --> 03:47:28.600]  week and as of now the situation has been escalating at an alarming rate
[03:47:28.600 --> 03:47:35.880]  in january 2016 north korea claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb
[03:47:35.880 --> 03:47:58.280]  in february north korea claims to have successfully launched an earth
[03:47:58.280 --> 03:48:03.800]  satellite into orbit using a long range missile earlier this month the un
[03:48:03.800 --> 03:48:08.360]  security council voted to impose sanctions on north korea
[03:48:08.360 --> 03:48:12.520]  soon after a north korean ship was impounded in the philippines
[03:48:12.520 --> 03:48:17.880]  as part of these new un sanctions kim jong-un responded by saying that he
[03:48:17.880 --> 03:48:23.080]  needs to be ready for nuclear conflict nuclear warheads need to be ready for
[03:48:23.080 --> 03:48:27.720]  use at any time and that's a direct quote from kim jong-un
[03:48:27.720 --> 03:48:32.280]  us officials say they are considering these threats true because they cannot
[03:48:32.280 --> 03:48:35.240]  risk underestimating them now you can say that again
[03:48:35.240 --> 03:48:39.560]  we will keep a close eye on this as the story continues to unfold
[03:48:39.560 --> 03:48:44.120]  stay tuned for updates at info wars dot com
[03:48:44.120 --> 03:48:47.640]  great report from uh rob Jacobson and darin mcbrain and of course war is a
[03:48:47.640 --> 03:48:51.080]  lifeblood of the state that's why uh the north korean dictator likes to brag
[03:48:51.080 --> 03:48:55.720]  about it so much and it's why our candidates for office from hillary
[03:48:55.720 --> 03:48:58.760]  clinton to uh the republicans for the most
[03:48:58.760 --> 03:49:03.000]  part especially john kasek last night they always want to push into an area
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:07.480]  like the ukraine like uh the middle east always trying to
[03:49:07.480 --> 03:49:11.160]  create a situation because that makes them more powerful
[03:49:11.160 --> 03:49:14.360]  it makes the people that put them in office the warmongers the neocons it
[03:49:14.360 --> 03:49:18.120]  makes them the money and of course ted cruz has
[03:49:18.120 --> 03:49:23.960]  an entire closet full of neocon advisors he keeps them in the closet while he
[03:49:23.960 --> 03:49:29.240]  openly trashes them uh criticizing neocons but he is one himself he's not
[03:49:29.240 --> 03:49:31.480]  a real conservative i want to quickly go to uh brother
[03:49:31.480 --> 03:49:35.320]  james and michigan you said you want to talk about trump and bill deberg go
[03:49:35.320 --> 03:49:39.480]  ahead yeah that's right thank you david you know
[03:49:39.480 --> 03:49:43.560]  that's right about what you were saying with ted i heard it from kasek too
[03:49:43.560 --> 03:49:49.400]  regards to ronsel uh you know a bb e nuclear technology in north korea back
[03:49:49.400 --> 03:49:53.880]  during the clinton administration nothing new he's got all the intelligence
[03:49:53.880 --> 03:50:00.200]  sounds really hip but i'm thinking if battle understood and had
[03:50:00.200 --> 03:50:06.120]  access to the bill deberg leaks from 1966 pretty much a wiki
[03:50:06.120 --> 03:50:12.520]  leak size data dump uh he would also understand the uh skeleton key
[03:50:12.520 --> 03:50:17.240]  to uh world foreign policy and white papers and the scheme
[03:50:17.240 --> 03:50:20.840]  and um in fact they're gonna want to know 16 probably
[03:50:20.840 --> 03:50:26.360]  north america uh 08 012 same location maybe so i that'd
[03:50:26.360 --> 03:50:30.440]  be great if he went with those papers and protested with us
[03:50:30.440 --> 03:50:34.760]  but um what's his eye does him have finding any importance from those
[03:50:34.760 --> 03:50:37.960]  documents are you familiar with them yeah are you saying that you you would
[03:50:37.960 --> 03:50:42.360]  like to see donald trump go protest bill deberg is that what you're saying
[03:50:42.360 --> 03:50:46.600]  i don't know that he would see the intelligence uh enough to know what's
[03:50:46.600 --> 03:50:49.960]  going on through the uh document leaks from
[03:50:49.960 --> 03:50:53.960]  you know i i have more confidence than any other presidential candidate i've
[03:50:53.960 --> 03:50:57.000]  seen in my lifetime that he knows what's going on he's talking about
[03:50:57.000 --> 03:51:01.160]  uh 9 11 and we released a sticker page say what this will say what is

[03:52:13.960 --> 03:52:19.000]  air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own

[03:55:37.480 --> 03:55:40.120]  want to go back to our callers but before i do real quickly there was an
[03:55:40.120 --> 03:55:43.800]  article up on the dredge reported data i thought was kind of interesting
[03:55:43.800 --> 03:55:47.960]  inside hollywood's quiet and growing support for donald trump now they talk
[03:55:47.960 --> 03:55:52.440]  about how they have to meet in secret they say at an undisclosed
[03:55:52.440 --> 03:55:56.440]  location somewhere in the la area about 200 members of hollywood's private
[03:55:56.440 --> 03:56:01.480]  group of conservative republicans known as friends of Abe gathered to watch
[03:56:01.480 --> 03:56:05.640]  thursday's GOP debate between trump cruise rubio and kasek okay it was an
[03:56:05.640 --> 03:56:08.920]  invitation only nobody gets to know where the
[03:56:08.920 --> 03:56:12.360]  location is or who's there why is that why is that you know because
[03:56:12.360 --> 03:56:17.080]  and here's the irony hollywood loves to talk about mccarthyism
[03:56:17.080 --> 03:56:22.120]  and they should okay but they're guilty of the same thing themselves a movie
[03:56:22.120 --> 03:56:25.400]  just had another movie yet another movie come out about mccarthyism called
[03:56:25.400 --> 03:56:29.080]  trumbo okay they can't leave that alone while they're
[03:56:29.080 --> 03:56:34.120]  doing it themselves that's what i liked about the
[03:56:34.120 --> 03:56:40.200]  the the recent cohen brothers movie hail seizer they show the hypocrisy
[03:56:40.200 --> 03:56:44.440]  of the hollywood communists as part of that and i'm not going to give away any
[03:56:44.440 --> 03:56:47.880]  spoilers on it but it really was an homage to
[03:56:47.880 --> 03:56:51.400]  old-style hollywood and they basically
[03:56:51.400 --> 03:56:55.480]  nailed everything that was going on in the 50s from all the different genres
[03:56:55.480 --> 03:57:01.480]  to the backdrop of radicalism being used through the movies to manipulate
[03:57:01.480 --> 03:57:05.640]  people and also the hypocrisy of that within hollywood and here we see it
[03:57:05.640 --> 03:57:08.760]  you know you can't talk about the fact that you're republican
[03:57:08.760 --> 03:57:13.720]  and then within the republicans it's like oh uh trump yeah i can't say it i
[03:57:13.720 --> 03:57:18.040]  support him but i can't say it you know that kind of peer pressure that kind of
[03:57:18.040 --> 03:57:21.800]  really mccarthyism and when i look at the endorsement from
[03:57:21.800 --> 03:57:27.960]  ben carson hopefully now hopefully they'll start to talk about obama care
[03:57:27.960 --> 03:57:31.080]  it's absolutely amazing when you look at these debates especially the not this
[03:57:31.080 --> 03:57:33.400]  last one the one before that especially
[03:57:33.400 --> 03:57:36.680]  donald trump had just released this health program we talked about it while
[03:57:36.680 --> 03:57:39.400]  we were doing the live coverage it's an excellent
[03:57:39.400 --> 03:57:43.560]  uh replacement of obama care first of all he gets rid of the mandate
[03:57:43.560 --> 03:57:47.240]  that's the worst thing about obama care then what he does and this is what
[03:57:47.240 --> 03:57:49.960]  little marco uh criticized him so much we said
[03:57:49.960 --> 03:57:54.360]  let the insurance companies compete again across state lines
[03:57:54.360 --> 03:57:59.240]  okay why would you support uh and i'm talking to ted Cruz
[03:57:59.240 --> 03:58:02.360]  john casick marco rubio why would you support
[03:58:02.360 --> 03:58:06.040]  so-called free trade globally and yet restrict
[03:58:06.040 --> 03:58:09.960]  trade and insurance policies within the united states again
[03:58:09.960 --> 03:58:14.680]  like everything we have just like the faiza court it's upside down
[03:58:14.680 --> 03:58:17.080]  they talk about free trade but they won't allow it in the united states so
[03:58:17.080 --> 03:58:20.040]  hopefully they'll have that and i think donald trump is right when he said we've
[03:58:20.040 --> 03:58:23.800]  had enough of these republican debates they're boring
[03:58:23.800 --> 03:58:27.240]  they aren't asking any questions they're not asking any substantive questions
[03:58:27.240 --> 03:58:31.000]  it's time to move on and that's it for today's show sorry the callers we didn't
[03:58:31.000 --> 03:58:57.560]  get to join us tonight seven central apm eastern for the info wars nightly news
