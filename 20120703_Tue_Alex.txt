[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:33.240]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones thank you
[00:33.240 --> 00:38.720]  for joining us for another worldwide transmission against tyranny as we attempt to awaken our
[00:38.720 --> 00:44.720]  fellow humans to the out-of-control corruption running rampant across the globe we're gonna be
[00:44.720 --> 00:49.960]  here for the next three hours we have representative marshal blackburn joining us coming up in an
[00:49.960 --> 00:57.200]  hour and a half to break down the fact that the TSA is absolutely out of control and she's
[00:57.200 --> 01:01.440]  introduced legislation to point out they have to stop calling themselves officers when they're
[01:01.440 --> 01:07.560]  not even sworn or trained or deputized they are a fraud out of their jurisdiction of course it's
[01:07.560 --> 01:11.960]  already illegal I don't know why we need more bills but I guess people in government see it as
[01:11.960 --> 01:18.640]  if executive power just does something it violates laws you pass a new law even though it's
[01:18.640 --> 01:23.440]  already violating a bunch of laws and somehow that's going to stop but it's coming to TSA in
[01:23.440 --> 01:29.200]  Texas last year groping members of the legislature so they unanimously in the house voted to start
[01:29.200 --> 01:33.920]  arresting them when they violated the law groping people they didn't need to pass a new law but they
[01:33.920 --> 01:41.200]  they were trying to and the feds threatened an armed blockade with f-16s of the state and the
[01:41.200 --> 01:47.240]  state said oh my gosh well we'll just roll over in fear just like the blackmailed compromised
[01:47.240 --> 01:57.280]  Congress basically does the same thing coming up we've got a clip of DNC chair says non-compliance
[01:57.280 --> 02:07.360]  with Obamacare will not be tolerated some amazing quotes where they say we're not going to tolerate
[02:07.360 --> 02:13.120]  that any more in America you have to be responsible you have to pay a penalty if you choose not to
[02:13.120 --> 02:17.600]  be you know all the big banks and mega rich are exempt from the taxes they've written the
[02:17.600 --> 02:22.720]  regulations that way most taxes are paid by people making less than a hundred thousand dollars a
[02:22.720 --> 02:28.240]  year I've got different government commission reports on that that we've covered here on air
[02:28.240 --> 02:36.680]  but they create this illusion that the ultra rich will be punished in some type of class warfare
[02:36.680 --> 02:44.720]  envy situation if they are you know brought to heal by government when they control that government
[02:44.720 --> 02:52.080]  some amazing statements the IRS knows of course exactly what you're doing with this system the
[02:52.080 --> 02:57.440]  IRS now gets to know about a small business owner's entire payroll level of their insurance coverage
[02:57.440 --> 03:03.000]  and it gets to know the income of not just the primary breadwinner in your house but your entire
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.560]  family's income in order to assess collect and mandate taxes reports Fox News and it's all in
[03:11.560 --> 03:21.480]  there all the new agents to enforce it everything meanwhile Barclay CEO Diamond quits over rate
[03:21.480 --> 03:26.400]  rigging in countries all over the world including here in the United States of course they get
[03:26.400 --> 03:34.400]  banker bailouts from your your pocketbook and then they get it at 0% interest and then they
[03:34.400 --> 03:42.240]  loan it back to governments the population between 7 and 30 something percent well some some credit

[10:39.400 --> 10:44.840]  announce and suddenly oh we're not going to now and then the pressure came because the power structure
[10:44.840 --> 10:51.640]  the big banks they want to force 35 million people to buy insurance and then and then the
[10:51.640 --> 11:01.560]  insurance companies can control the care they can make you buy it and have the irs
[11:01.560 --> 11:07.880]  in force it and that's up at the new american dot com okay continuing with some of the other

[11:27.480 --> 11:31.880]  take out qaddafi or that information will be released but still he's being burned
[11:33.160 --> 11:40.360]  and this is how these criminal systems work uh so nicolas sarcosi's home rated by french police

[12:17.160 --> 12:23.240]  we've got to go into syria because he might have tortured some people so the united states needs to
[12:23.240 --> 12:29.480]  be invaded because our criminal government has tortured little children the army's own report
[12:29.480 --> 12:35.080]  admits and killed people and flown people by the tens of thousands the secret sites black sites
[12:35.080 --> 12:41.320]  ghost sites all over the world i mean i could mention what's been admitted out of the cia torture
[12:41.320 --> 12:46.600]  center within camp x-ray in lontana but i can't say it on a family show
[12:49.080 --> 12:54.280]  drugging people uh to freak them out doing they say to freak them out when it leaked oh it's because
[12:54.280 --> 13:01.080]  they they're satanist folks uh women prostitutes blood i'm going to leave it at that you can go

[13:13.480 --> 13:17.720]  acid i'm just going to leave it at that people always hear that don't believe it and go look at
[13:17.720 --> 13:23.960]  them go oh my gosh this is true yes this is true it's because they like to do it that's why they
[13:23.960 --> 13:29.560]  want to get torture going because they want to try to legalize it so that they can do it to you
[13:29.560 --> 13:36.920]  okay that's what this is all about about hell being manifest so you got to love the double
[13:36.920 --> 13:42.520]  speak though oh my gosh they torture people in china and syria but then give no proof of syria
[13:44.280 --> 13:49.720]  though that is what they do over there so it probably is going on but the point is is that
[13:49.720 --> 13:57.800]  that now we've got to invade because they might have tortured maybe they threw babies out of incubators
[13:57.800 --> 14:02.040]  of course that later turned out was pr fraud doesn't matter though it feels good to get upset
[14:02.040 --> 14:06.760]  and get behind a big war and have the troops blow up giant chemical weapons dumps and then
[14:06.760 --> 14:10.520]  have it rain back down and then everybody gets brain cancer and then the military doesn't give
[14:10.520 --> 14:17.320]  them treatment but again it doesn't matter because it felt good at the time and minkond feels good
[14:17.320 --> 14:24.760]  now let me get into this little piece of news first because barclays ceo diamond quits over
[14:24.760 --> 14:34.040]  rate rigging and this deals with barclays chief executive bob diamond quit on
[14:35.400 --> 14:39.960]  tuesday under fire from politicians and regulators people they appointed the highest
[14:39.960 --> 14:45.160]  profile casualty of the interest rate rigging scandal spanning more than a dozen banks across
[14:45.160 --> 14:49.960]  the world the big banks who get your money a lot of it just pure money they get but then a lot of
[14:49.960 --> 14:54.360]  its quote quote bailout and then you know they give them trillions and then they loan it out at 10
[14:54.360 --> 15:00.920]  20 30 percent or higher the government's individuals and then they have an unfair trade
[15:00.920 --> 15:05.960]  advantage and are able to take over and they control the regulators and shut down local banks
[15:05.960 --> 15:12.280]  that are a lot more solvent than they are that's how this works and so you've got that happening
[15:12.280 --> 15:15.560]  you've got these same groups taking over countries they're imploding by design
[15:17.240 --> 15:23.160]  meanwhile the very same group that runs our nation comes out on wolf blitzer
[15:24.360 --> 15:29.720]  and they have the dnc chair say non-compliance with obama care will not be tolerated this is
[15:29.720 --> 15:35.880]  an info wars dot com article right now despite claiming obama care was not a tax we have links
[15:35.880 --> 15:39.960]  to obama saying that and all the articles and it was a conspiracy theory and there were no death
[15:39.960 --> 15:45.560]  panels which they now admit democratic national committee chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz
[15:45.560 --> 15:51.880]  told cnn's wolf blitzer that the internal revenue service would be the easiest enforcer of penalties
[15:51.880 --> 15:56.760]  against those who refuse to comply with the new health care law and she goes on to say the states
[15:56.760 --> 16:02.120]  individuals it will not be tolerated you will submit to the board and she says don't worry
[16:03.240 --> 16:07.240]  you don't want to buy health care that's fine we'll take thousands of dollars what is it five
[16:07.240 --> 16:14.600]  thousand dollars a hundred dollars out of each check and then five hundred dollar penalties and
[16:14.600 --> 16:19.320]  then it goes up from there upwards of five thousand dollars a year they'll just take it out of your
[16:19.320 --> 16:25.080]  account and then it gets rid of a lot of the charity care that was already there let's the
[16:25.080 --> 16:30.200]  insurance companies lower the standard of care and the supreme court ruled said yes it's a tax
[16:30.200 --> 16:33.480]  and the iris will enforce it and i and one of the tools you over and over again two groups are
[16:33.480 --> 16:42.360]  going to enforce all of this unconstitutional activity the looting the tsa now on highways and
[16:42.360 --> 16:48.920]  checkpoints and schools and proms don't believe me look it up and and bus stations for now three
[16:48.920 --> 16:55.240]  four years but now they're now they're rolling out nationwide everywhere and they command the army
[16:55.240 --> 17:01.800]  and police you're like well why don't not train not bonded weirdos command and have weird inspector
[17:01.800 --> 17:06.360]  outfits that they wear when they're out because it's about scum and criminals that don't even get
[17:06.360 --> 17:10.280]  background checks or when you do have the background check if you're a criminal you go to the front
[17:10.280 --> 17:15.000]  of the line that's been confirmed think about we're just calmly talking about the government
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.400]  hiring criminals now and we're so broke back psychologically spiritually we're just like
[17:19.400 --> 17:24.040]  yeah that's the way it is they hire criminals and then they go out and shake you down on the
[17:24.040 --> 17:29.400]  highways and byways and and the new green police the fez are setting up under the rural council
[17:29.400 --> 17:36.280]  on all of this they admit same thing in australia very same group it's globally standardized that
[17:37.320 --> 17:43.800]  it's like a two week course or 10 day course now with the tsa but in australia it's a two week
[17:43.800 --> 17:49.640]  and then they just come to your house and say we're coming in and they're armed no judge no jury
[17:49.640 --> 17:53.160]  they just they're coming in to do an inspection they're coming in to forcibly inoculate they're

[33:36.840 --> 33:42.520]  as the collection agency for the private federal reserve the hundred years charter of the federal
[33:42.520 --> 33:51.320]  reserve up next year ron paul has introduced legislation to audit the fed ron paul's texas
[33:51.320 --> 33:56.840]  straight talk audit the fed headed to the house floor we posted that yesterday at info wars dot
[33:56.840 --> 34:01.960]  com you can find it there in the tiles very important article to go after the people that have
[34:01.960 --> 34:07.480]  hijacked our government it's not debated every financial publication from the financial times
[34:07.480 --> 34:13.400]  of london to the economist for the wall street journal to cnbc says yeah we're run by foreign
[34:13.400 --> 34:19.240]  banks yes we've been captured yes that's who rules us and then they're the ones so i've been
[34:19.240 --> 34:24.200]  harping on this forever now it's being admitted they're the ones that want to bankrupt things they
[34:24.200 --> 34:33.000]  can take control and who are their enforcers who are their enforcers the irs that collects
[34:34.040 --> 34:41.400]  ron reagan's own congressional report broke this down in 1981 the grace commission go look it up
[34:41.400 --> 34:50.680]  99 almost 100 99 percent less the one percent administrative goes to interest on the debt
[34:50.680 --> 34:56.600]  instead of just money being created as a symbol of exchange money is created and then the banksters
[34:56.600 --> 35:01.160]  get interest right off the top so they what do they want to do they want to expand the money
[35:01.160 --> 35:08.200]  supply and again to call it an unfair trade advantage is not even scratching the surface
[35:08.200 --> 35:12.840]  this is why they're forming combines and oligopolies duopolies and monopolies
[35:13.400 --> 35:19.240]  it's why they lobby for more regulations that they're exempt from they're exempt from the major
[35:19.240 --> 35:26.680]  taxes they're exempt from the regulations they're exempt from the obama care this is pure mafia
[35:26.680 --> 35:32.200]  government call it what you want communist fascist socialists all these things lead
[35:32.200 --> 35:41.400]  to tiny groups in control freedom tiny government leads to incredible diversity in the marketplace
[35:41.400 --> 35:46.280]  and wealth untold it's a fact all these status that come out of the government schools will
[35:46.280 --> 35:51.400]  tell you the opposite because they don't live in the real world now that the banksters have used
[35:51.400 --> 35:57.080]  big government to bankrupt everything though and to start consolidating now they want to bring in
[35:57.080 --> 36:02.280]  a fake brand of libertarianism where these big mega corporations just become the government
[36:04.200 --> 36:08.840]  but have none of the responsibilities and so now they want to cry libertarian because they've
[36:08.840 --> 36:13.560]  already stolen all the wealth and they're afraid of people using government to claw it back from
[36:13.560 --> 36:19.240]  them in a separation of powers type situation but don't worry there is no separation of powers
[36:19.240 --> 36:24.840]  governments are bought and paid for by the more organized corporate criminals congress bought
[36:24.840 --> 36:32.520]  and paid for the parliament of england bought and paid for to the point now that oily scumbags
[36:33.080 --> 36:39.240]  like the head of the dnc gets up there and says we will not tolerate it you will pay your fair share
[36:40.280 --> 36:45.080]  we will ship your jobs to china we will bankrupt you will give trillions to foreign banks we will
[36:45.080 --> 36:50.280]  exempt ourselves and exempt all our friends and give billions of dollars of energy companies that
[36:50.280 --> 36:56.840]  pay us we will engage in all these crimes and interest rate fixing and everything else but you
[36:58.120 --> 37:03.160]  the person making fifty thousand dollars a year who cannot afford health insurance
[37:07.240 --> 37:11.640]  instead of going in and just getting a bill and paying off your medical stuff they've screwed
[37:11.640 --> 37:15.880]  up the medical system so bad with government involvement now and driven up the price so much
[37:15.880 --> 37:21.800]  that now they're going to say well we'll just take money out of your account or you can go by the
[37:21.800 --> 37:26.040]  insurance so it's a direct tax to the insurance companies and that's worse they then get to

[40:02.120 --> 40:07.000]  entire payroll the level of their insurance coverage and it gets to know the income of not
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.400]  only the primary breadwinner in your house but your entire family's income in order to assess
[40:11.400 --> 40:18.840]  collect and mandate the tax the way we usually think of taxation wolf is that taxation is the irs
[40:19.480 --> 40:23.640]  administers and collects on broad swaths of large categories of individuals
[40:23.640 --> 40:29.480]  bosserman shaltz said this is a penalty that will be assessed see the irs is not going to be the
[40:29.480 --> 40:33.880]  enforcer of everything they were always meant to be that this is the and they're already lawless
[40:33.880 --> 40:38.440]  they already have their own weird kangaroo courts with no jury just like they set up family courts
[40:38.440 --> 40:45.400]  100 years ago totally fake as you put a crook in a black uniform though behind the desk it's fine
[40:45.400 --> 40:51.720]  this is a penalty that will be assessed of the tax return if you choose to roll the dice and make
[40:51.720 --> 40:57.400]  us pay for your being irresponsible and increase all of your health care costs oh this is the
[40:57.400 --> 41:02.920]  democrats telling us we're not responsible if you choose and i want to go do it see they already
[41:02.920 --> 41:07.400]  quasi socialize it so then they say oh well you've got to buy it now and now they're saying

[41:13.160 --> 41:18.360]  paying for you it's total takeover this is only the beginning with these criminals running our

[41:25.720 --> 41:33.080]  you do just like general electric and all of them are exempt from taxes it's all for us how
[41:33.080 --> 41:38.200]  many famous rich people have i seen joke no taxes that's for regular people these billionaires folks
[41:38.200 --> 41:44.360]  don't pay taxes mint romney pays almost no taxes because they they're certain take the justice
[41:44.360 --> 41:49.800]  department it the the attorney general is partners in a law firm that if you go higher than to do

[41:55.560 --> 42:00.600]  mr romney their lawyer says obama doesn't have to partly pay any taxes and then they go put them
[42:00.600 --> 42:05.080]  in offshore corporations again because these are criminals
[42:10.360 --> 42:13.800]  let's go ahead and go to the cnn clip that got me so mad
[42:14.520 --> 42:20.200]  here it is in your face telling you that you're you know you've given tens of trillions of the

[42:33.640 --> 42:40.120]  on average before the irs was set up in 1913 wasn't even implemented until the late 40s they said oh
[42:40.120 --> 42:45.880]  it's a temporary wartime tax we take some money out of your account you pay taxes with tolls and
[42:45.880 --> 42:51.160]  tariffs and regulations and gas taxes and all these other things that's what runs the government

[44:00.760 --> 44:05.240]  20 million other people killed for serving hitler the russians thought well the small group that
[44:05.240 --> 44:09.240]  supported communist and don't worry the russians kill over 40 million other people now over 60
[44:09.240 --> 44:15.000]  don't worry you want to get hurt bad they're gonna hurt you and you servants of this you're
[44:15.000 --> 44:27.640]  gonna get hurt the worst show in joy one word in joy in joy enjoy here's the clip here is the
[44:27.640 --> 44:33.480]  clip of cnn and this witch here it is solicitor general tells the supreme court representing
[44:33.480 --> 44:39.320]  the obama administration it is in fact a tax it'll be administered by the irs it'll be collected on
[44:39.320 --> 44:46.520]  april 15th why can't you acknowledge that it's that it is in fact a tax because it's a penalty
[44:46.520 --> 44:52.520]  it's not a tax it's a penalty that if you decide to be irresponsible and continue to refuse to
[44:52.520 --> 44:57.720]  carry health insurance and make us all pay for your being irresponsible then you can do that
[44:57.720 --> 45:01.480]  you know we're not going to actually require that you have health insurance what we're saying
[45:01.480 --> 45:05.720]  is if you choose not to carry health insurance then you will be assessed a penalty that will
[45:05.720 --> 45:10.840]  be assessed on your tax return and that affects about one percent of americans who choose to do
[45:10.840 --> 45:16.920]  that so don't really the solicitor general was wrong he didn't tell the truth to the supreme court
[45:18.440 --> 45:24.920]  no on the contrary what but but the way we usually think of taxation wolf is that taxation
[45:24.920 --> 45:31.160]  as the irs administers it is collected on broad swaths and large categories of individuals
[45:31.160 --> 45:37.960]  this is a penalty that will be assessed on the tax return if you choose to roll the dice and make
[45:37.960 --> 45:42.520]  us all pay for your being irresponsible and increase all of our health care costs we're not
[45:42.520 --> 45:46.440]  going to tolerate that anymore in america you have to be responsible and you're going to pay a
[45:46.440 --> 45:52.360]  penalty if you choose not to be one final question why is the irs administering this if it's not
[45:52.360 --> 45:58.760]  a tax isn't that their job to impose taxes collect taxes to punish people who don't pay taxes
[45:58.760 --> 46:04.040]  well because administratively that's the uh that that's really the easiest most basic way to do it
[46:04.040 --> 46:08.360]  it's the same way that they do it in massachusetts the department of revenue in massachusetts now let's
[46:08.360 --> 46:12.200]  stop right there turn that witch off actually turn that turn that enemy of this country off
[46:12.200 --> 46:17.880]  that occupy her office she isn't occupied by the foreign banks they're rolling in administrative
[46:17.880 --> 46:24.120]  tax collectors in greece in places just shaking people down right now notice when i had the tsa
[46:24.120 --> 46:32.200]  guy go you know i'm gonna grope you a few months ago i said you you you that's a fourth member
[46:32.200 --> 46:36.920]  of the violation he said i have administrative privileges and smiled see it's administrative
[46:36.920 --> 46:43.480]  it's maritime it's we got guys in uniforms that if you don't pay us are going to come with guns
[46:43.480 --> 46:48.920]  and we're going to throw you in a prison by the way a well-known activist former big big wig in
[46:48.920 --> 46:55.320]  uk independence party kind of like the leader of their tea party over there we have an article
[46:55.320 --> 47:01.480]  by paul watson uh breaking it all down man arrested tried in secret for non-payment of tax
[47:01.480 --> 47:07.000]  and it was a special star chamber they just arrested him took him and the same day tried him
[47:07.000 --> 47:12.200]  in some secret trial they just said he's gone now yes he had a secret trial to sit in the news
[47:12.200 --> 47:18.760]  he's gone now he's gone now you're just gone now bye bye gone now gone now and of course they
[47:18.760 --> 47:23.880]  told you india will kill you will disappear you everything and this is what this is freedom
[47:23.880 --> 47:32.680]  and then we got some witch going you will behave yourself you will uh you comply you we will no
[47:32.680 --> 47:40.680]  longer tolerate you what's our exact quote what is which he puts exact exact quote here
[47:42.280 --> 47:47.720]  this is a penalty that will be assessed on the tax return if you choose to roll the dice and make
[47:47.720 --> 47:55.000]  us pay all pay for your being irresponsible and increase all of your healthcare costs and let me
[47:55.000 --> 48:00.760]  tell you most the people i know that have the irs taken their house it's a two-bedroom their kids
[48:00.760 --> 48:05.000]  are all in high school or they're elderly i know a lot of people right now who live in the poor part
[48:05.000 --> 48:12.440]  of town and the irs is coming back and saying yeah it shows five years ago you made this thousand
[48:12.440 --> 48:16.920]  dollars and we say you didn't pay on it right so now it's ten thousand and they don't have ten
[48:16.920 --> 48:22.760]  thousand dollars and so now they start grabbing their social security checker they start grabbing
[48:22.760 --> 48:28.200]  their bank checker they start and they start taking money out of their bank account and then
[48:28.200 --> 48:32.760]  they just come take the house and it's like oh you just be homeless or moving with your family
[48:32.760 --> 48:38.200]  moving with your neighbors it's a squeezing it's a crushing and it's not going to stop it's gonna
[48:38.200 --> 48:44.520]  they're going to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze because they like doing it and they love lying
[48:44.520 --> 48:50.360]  to you it's it's part of their religion of disdain for the cattle you notice the supreme court says
[48:50.360 --> 48:56.680]  the solicitor general it is a tax it's enforced by the irs to pay it to the subsidiaries the
[48:56.680 --> 49:00.920]  fellow deserve their big insurance companies i've been telling you for two years it's a tax of the
[49:00.920 --> 49:07.480]  bankers what is it now you're gonna get this or the irs is going to hit you with penalties and
[49:07.480 --> 49:17.000]  interest no judge no jury no due process what's the constitution say what does it say for anything
[49:17.000 --> 49:22.520]  more than twenty dollars you get a jury trial no you don't we're going to take five thousand
[49:22.520 --> 49:26.760]  dollars out with penalties and interest and we're going to take your bank account and we're going

[49:42.520 --> 49:48.280]  that's just the way it is that's just the way it is because you're going to be responsible
[49:49.400 --> 49:53.240]  we're not going to put up with you not being responsible anymore as they give five hundred
[49:53.240 --> 49:58.040]  million to energy companies for them to steal and as obama goes like the mafia because that's
[49:58.040 --> 50:02.280]  what he is it says uh you're not a democratic donor you've had this chevy dealership since

[55:51.080 --> 55:57.240]  force sent out to rule let's go ahead and talk to mark in arizona mark you're on the air go ahead
[55:58.440 --> 56:03.880]  hi alex um i just wanted to say a couple of things firstly thank you you have been so
[56:03.880 --> 56:10.600]  instrumental in my awareness and awakening um one of the things i've been learning and done
[56:10.600 --> 56:15.080]  at awakening is learned about research and learned about history and i've been doing a lot of
[56:15.080 --> 56:19.560]  research on history and learned that history repeats itself and i don't understand quite
[56:19.560 --> 56:25.880]  why people don't realize that well because the average person is timid and is a spectator their
[56:25.880 --> 56:30.760]  whole life is about watching and being told what to do and so they have no idea what's happening
[56:30.760 --> 56:35.000]  they have no idea how much danger we're in i mean they have no idea i mean i mean the new world
[56:35.000 --> 56:40.600]  order is killing people all over the planet and and and just setting up a horrible reeducation system
[56:40.600 --> 56:48.920]  here they'll find out though don't me don't worry okay with that said and with all that's going on
[56:48.920 --> 56:53.960]  like all that we're seeing unfold before our very eyes and the things that we've been seeing since
[56:53.960 --> 57:01.400]  just january 1st of this year i've often pondered lately i wonder what this what it might look like
[57:01.400 --> 57:07.880]  um in a modern day situation have you pondered uh or given any speculation to what it might look
[57:07.880 --> 57:13.400]  like yeah they know to not confront you upfront with uh intimidation and force unless it's a
[57:13.400 --> 57:16.680]  protest because they want that extinguished because that can get out of hand they can lose control
[57:16.680 --> 57:22.280]  that way because it would show our power and we can win uh and so it's just going to be bureaucratic
[57:22.280 --> 57:26.920]  yeah we're taking your house sorry you got behind yeah that's just the way yeah we're taking your
[57:26.920 --> 57:34.120]  kids uh for forced inoculation it's just how it is it's all this you know this fake non-threatening
[57:34.120 --> 57:39.000]  garbage it's it's for your own good you know we represent the majority when they don't it's just
[57:39.000 --> 57:46.520]  oily but i mean here we are it'll mean stage terror attacks the the criminals that stage the tax
[57:46.520 --> 57:52.200]  posing as saviors i mean you asking what it's going to look like or what are you saying
[57:52.200 --> 57:57.480]  well what i'm going to use have you pondered what a modern day quote unquote shot around
[57:57.480 --> 58:02.440]  heard around the world might look like in today's world like what happened in lexington when people
[58:02.440 --> 58:07.320]  finally got pissed off enough to say no more i've wondered what that might look like today
[58:07.320 --> 58:11.240]  because the playing field is very different it's not going to go down like it did back then
[58:12.680 --> 58:19.320]  well that's why they don't ever send people marching in let's say 200 guys got on the hill
[58:19.320 --> 58:29.560]  top and they were coming to confiscate guns in some town and if they just showed up well i mean
[58:29.560 --> 58:34.200]  i'll explain when we come back the swat teams wouldn't go face a group like that they would wait
[58:34.200 --> 58:38.600]  and go burn down the people's houses later you see that's what they do they never want to face
[58:38.600 --> 58:51.800]  something head on this is gcn the genesis communications radio network hi this is alex jones
[58:51.800 --> 58:55.960]  did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[58:55.960 --> 59:00.200]  vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can
[59:00.200 --> 59:04.920]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and silver before
[59:04.920 --> 59:10.040]  in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[59:10.040 --> 59:15.800]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it
[59:15.800 --> 59:21.000]  can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family and here's the best
[59:21.000 --> 59:25.880]  part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[59:25.880 --> 59:32.120]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival
[59:32.120 --> 59:38.040]  seed bank dot com or give them a call at eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five
[59:38.040 --> 59:45.240]  that's eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five remember in a real crisis non-hybrid
[59:45.240 --> 59:49.640]  seeds are the ultimate barter item this is alex jones for survival seed bank dot com
[59:49.640 --> 59:58.520]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:12.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:21.240]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.280]  all right ladies and gentlemen coming up at about 30 minutes representative marsha blackburn
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:36.760]  is scheduled to be joining us she's fighting the tsa in a big way glad to see that she's doing that
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:42.760]  which ron paul did some legislation like that uh but he is trying to get legislation introduced
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:47.560]  to auto fed that's moving to the house floor right now so i guess many hands make light work
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:55.480]  the last caller was asking what will the shot be heard around the world um it will be as things
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:05.400]  collapse if the police and military get caught on tape really engage in a massacre like weiko or
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:11.480]  something that and and that woke a lot of people up back in 93 and got a lot of the modern patriot
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.880]  movement set up that is the only opposition the globalist right now so that could be a shot
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:22.520]  heard around the world uh also there's there's more of a velvet revolution of ideas as people
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:29.160]  just stop complying and as people recognize and withdraw their consent from the system no amount
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:33.880]  of airplanes and drones and black uniforms are going to make people you know identify with it
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:41.960]  anymore that's why in every movie shows dramas america's got talent nfl games it's all fake patriotism
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:48.360]  but packaging tyranny as if it's the patriotism that's not going to work anymore uh the system
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:53.800]  though doesn't want a upfront physical confrontation where they don't have the moral high ground
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:02:00.600]  that's why they will start riots or create atmospheres politically that will induce riots
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:06.760]  so so the system can come in as the good guys and restore order and then basically never leave
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:11.800]  and then start the political persecution well you saw the collapse and the riots we can't
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.280]  have people criticizing the government they're trying to bring prosperity back why look at all
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:22.440]  the government's doing to help us this is all going to be rolled out with layers of brainwashing
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:28.360]  and and sickening you know garbage attached to it but it doesn't matter nine percent approval
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:33.400]  writing for congress people don't buy any of it anymore now we've just got to get people moving
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:38.360]  forward but the shot hurt around the world will be gun confiscation if they try it
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:44.840]  and you you see the crooks have seized control of the system and they're in command but not
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:52.520]  everybody's following orders and so there's this paradox of incredible tyranny and surveillance and
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:59.800]  torture teams and all of this set up and armored vehicles and you know helicopters with nerve gas
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.120]  mounted to the bottom waiting in each us city sunshine project reported on that over a decade
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:09.720]  ago but separately there's people waking up there's gun owners there's millions of guns being sold
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:16.280]  i mean you know what millions of riflemen can do i don't care how much fancy stuff you've got
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:24.600]  so it's all a siob and so the globalists are busy because they're in control of the war chest
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.080]  they're in control of the money stealing everything they can wrecking whatever they can
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:36.200]  putting in regulations to shut down stuff they don't own as fast as they can while wasting as much
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:41.320]  money as they can and creating as much dependency as they can imagine if you were evil and you
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:46.120]  didn't follow any rules what would you do you'd undermine society you break down the family
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:51.240]  you deindustrialize you'd pose as the savior though so people were dependent on you and that's
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:56.920]  what they do they take every trick learned in history and they write publications admitting
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:01.240]  they called the final revolution of how to totally dumb down and take control of society
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:05.640]  we're gonna go to break and come back go to holly and then we're gonna go to uh
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:13.160]  david kevin ed matt and others and i'm gonna try to just go to you make your comment ask your

[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:23.480]  just to take calls but then the the questions are all very serious and very important and i don't
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:31.720]  know how to respond to it because if you respond in a long treatise the information is lost so the
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:41.240]  real sweet spot that's got to be hit is condensing down the essence of it and easily to understand
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:50.680]  and pass on nuggets all right we'll be back with your phone calls straight ahead we have

[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:19.720]  lost their houses but we're definitely very lucky that we've got the the northern colorado fire a
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.800]  hundred percent contained i think the last update was on that and you know what fema does though
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:28.280]  they come show up and then slow down the process like they did outside austin last year in bass
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:33.400]  drop they come in slow down the whole process and then grandstand and say that they did it all

[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:32.840]  the place you got um in the east obviously devastating power outages and government
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:38.120]  waddling around pointing guns at people opposing as a savior and demanding the utility companies
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:41.880]  you know get things back on quicker when the government can't do anything but steal money
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:48.760]  and again swagger around what did you originally call in about today well i just called to basically
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:53.240]  thank you i'm really excited first-time caller but i also was very interested in one of the
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:58.040]  topics that you covered i believe it was last week on the smart meters and dirty electricity
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.400]  and i'm just hoping that maybe you retouch that top topic in a future
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:08.360]  show because there is a lot of people that don't really understand what these smart meters and the
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:16.920]  potential harm to us from the dirty electricity you know i agree with you it's a big deal not to
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:22.600]  mention all the surveillance that the smart meters are engaged in illegally thank you so much holly
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:28.200]  be safe out there in colorado uh let's go ahead and talk to kevin in canada kevin you're on the air
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:35.880]  hello alex hey buddy hey it's kevin in bantful bird of canada how you doing that good man
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.640]  good uh i just wanted to make comments about the uh the health care system up here and how uh
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:47.640]  uh how flawed it can be uh i have a bit of a knee problem um did a lot of research online
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:52.360]  couldn't really get much info so i went to the go see the doc um sat down and he said to uh
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:59.080]  to google it that was his uh diagnosis diagnosis there so just an example of the uh oh yeah i mean
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:03.400]  listen listen people don't understand we're gonna get the type of free health care they get in
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.280]  england which stand in line for a couple years if you're lucky or go in with strep throat they
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:12.600]  give you a bottle aspirin i mean people are really going to love the new thing it's going to be
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:17.400]  wonderful they're going to water it down destroy our health care and charge us more and have the irs
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:22.680]  administer it it's going to be wonderful yeah all the good doctors went down to the states because
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:27.240]  they can actually earn a living down there and uh i guess that'll be changing now as the obama
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:32.360]  carries and push through so well that's what the neural order is about they say every they say people
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:38.200]  hate us we wreck things but they say it's finally going to be great when no one can run again these
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.600]  are people that make you be under them these are people that you've never invited over to dinner
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:47.960]  people you've never want to be around but they want to run your life now the census bureau goes out
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:53.720]  every year the law says it's every 10 to ask how many people live here for a portionment of the
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:59.480]  legislature to see how many house members you get but no it's how what stocks and bonds do you have
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:05.720]  what firearms do you have and now it's going to be monthly censuses and again oh my gosh your
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:09.720]  government person's at my door i better grovel and answer all their questions i tell them to go
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:14.280]  jump in the lake and slam the door in their face i take their envelopes and throw them in the trash
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:20.760]  i'm sorry go ahead yeah notice uh they were coming around like it's thoughtful it was ridiculous
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:26.440]  both myself and my neighbor uh wanted to opt out of the census and this guy came down probably
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:31.880]  i would say 25 times in a month like he would hang outside the house watch for us when we were
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:36.920]  leaving kind of see where we're coming out of and you know you gotta go talk to the guy eventually
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:41.160]  and he's just completely ignorant on the whole issue yeah well you know what i say i say shut up
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:45.560]  scum and i've done it you're back when people could get to my house you can walk up to the door
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:50.360]  you can't now i was i live back in the woods i go right up and say what are you doing the guy had
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.840]  zits all over his face in a plastic badge and he said you're not filling out the form and i said
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:59.400]  yeah it's criminal he goes you'll be arrested and i go go get the cops then and he started
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:05.400]  bowing up and i said listen get off my porch right now punk get out of here i don't care in the criminals
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:11.000]  that run you told you that you can do this this is back in 2000 i slammed the door in his face
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.920]  i even shot video of it i don't know where the video is that i've ever used it but the point is
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:19.400]  it's my wife she's my girlfriend at the time she said it sounded so vicious but but probably
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:24.680]  shouldn't put it on air but you know i mean and by the way then i walked out a few minutes later
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:30.040]  he was parked in the middle of the residential street three feet off the curb blocking the road
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:36.280]  like he was god just waddling and that's what tsa is you see at least with the police there's some
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:40.760]  history of the constitution bill of rights some training they tried to phase it out but there's
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:45.640]  still all these court cases with an old agency that they can't do all these things but see a new
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:54.040]  agency they can say oh well we're new but but just to be clear you went to get your your your knee
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.720]  diagnosed and i just said just google it google is now your doctor in canada
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:03.400]  yeah exactly you know i said you know should i try to go close to me in sulfate you know a few
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:07.320]  things like the doctor wallet product and you know just i just threw up the names i wasn't
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:12.440]  drawn up the company but he said uh yeah i kind of shrugged it off and said well you know you
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:17.160]  could probably just google it there's something really good information out there yeah and i
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:22.040]  almost laughed in his face and i just walked out the door and you know ordered some osteo effects
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:28.680]  so god bless you i start appreciate you calling listen listen everybody's people are so dumb
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:32.760]  they won't even notice everything gets screwed up and this is just the beginning of bankrupting
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:38.200]  healthcare this is just the beginning of bankrupting america it's a slow loving process as they
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:44.360]  strangle us okay and it's all designed people are like california is plunging faster after
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:50.920]  the 20 carbon tax was put in of course it was it didn't government know it would make the economy go
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:58.840]  down of course they knew of course they knew that's the whole point bankrupt you drive you into
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:04.040]  submission then only the globalist who are exempt from all their own laws can operate this is very
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:12.040]  elementary very elementary and it's like a bad dream just wake up to it and say no a lot of
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:16.600]  people say man this show is so radical no no no we've put up with radical tyranny to the point
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:27.640]  of its cartoon like now what's what's radical is how servile people have gotten ed in tennessee
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:35.800]  he's watching on prisonplanet.tv ed welcome what's going on alex worldwide transmission sir thank you
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:40.680]  for calling all right hey look at that guy thank you and george norris for getting me away care
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:47.480]  about five years ago but my my prime reason for calling in and uh i sent an email to you last
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:55.960]  week when i got it but it's okay this is romney about uh from freedom outpost romney i do not
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:18:02.280]  need approval or special authorization for military force in an interview with bob schaffer on a
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:06.760]  face to nation mit romney declares that he would do exactly what barack obama has done
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:11.960]  and use military force not in defense of our nation within a pre-enter strike against iran
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:17.480]  without congressional approval he says that it's just for a second here i can assure you if i'm
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:22.200]  president the iranians will have no question that i will be willing to take military action
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:27.240]  isn't necessary to prevent them from becoming a nuclear threat no no we played the clip uh
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:33.800]  that was a few weeks ago and of course look it's not that wow he's a lot like obama isn't that funny
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:39.160]  that's because they're puppets and whatever the globalist policy is they're going to follow
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:45.800]  just like uh roberts uh you know ruling that you can pay private banks and insurance companies
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:50.600]  attacks and that the irs will enforce it if you don't people like well why did roberts do that
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:57.240]  because that's what the ruling system wants that's what the criminals want and you know all these
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:02.600]  male cheerleader presidents and all these obama harvard lawyers and all i mean of course you're
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:07.960]  going to get the same thing of course he says he supports the ndaa of course he supported abortion
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:12.680]  and all this in the past and watch you'll get rhetoric that's anti-abortion on a romney if he
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:19.640]  gets in but you're not going to see it repealed because they want dead babies the rulers the
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:25.240]  owners of this country that took it over through fraud their any minion they let in is going to do
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:30.600]  exactly what they want your comment on that oh i'm i'm in full agreement with you i mean there's
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:36.120]  there's so much scum and there's so much evil coming in at us that it's almost frightening
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:42.040]  you know i mean i look around i'm like okay well they're gonna drop on us now i mean my little
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:47.160]  quick rant is we need to get ron paul back in this game i mean he's the only one i mean everybody
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:52.920]  says he can't win can't win well people would stop saying that crap and say he can win and get behind
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.920]  him now i hear you listen listen ron paul though did his job he got the word out about the new world

[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:45.560]  after all the recession ended three years ago oh of course that's why everything is so hunky
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:50.760]  dory now and i love the clip you played how alex that's just a woolen sheep's clothing how they
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:55.480]  it's like how they sell us democracy over the republic and they say democracy is what we are
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:00.040]  democracy is what you want and then when that fails you can blame the republic you just like you can
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:06.520]  blame capitalism when you cover you when you pour socialism all like a like a creamy topping all over
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:12.280]  your your capitalism and and so they say look how look how how nasty this tastes look how gross
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:19.000]  your capitalism is worse than that i mean they create a mafia crony monopoly system and then
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:26.920]  tell us it's capitalism i i interchange fascism what is it predatory totalitarianism as lord

[01:33:53.960 --> 01:34:00.600]  the tsa and to restrict some of their activities and we've seen other legislation introduced to try
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:07.880]  to rein them in at the state level but texas last year unanimously in the house voted to enforce
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:15.160]  existing laws with gropin the tsa goes in the pants evidence by captain kirk having to say
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:22.840]  scottie zipped me up last week whenever they pulled his pants down at lax this goes on all the time
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:28.040]  it's all part of the humiliation but there's new legislation introduced a representative marshal
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:32.360]  blackburn and we're getting her on the line right now their assistant just called in or the press
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:42.280]  secretary and she has introduced legislation that we want to tell you about hr 3608 that will
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:49.000]  make them stop calling themselves officers and i happen to have a news article here where exactly
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:55.960]  that has happened tsa worker arrested for sexual assault we see this all the time that was wj la
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:03.000]  tv and what they do is they tell women they pull people over and stuff and they tell them that
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  they are sworn police officers they tell people that uh that they're operating in that capacity
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:17.320]  and they're not sworn they're not bonded uh they're not any of that uh look the feds can't
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:21.640]  randomly pull you over and stick their hands down your pants the fbi agent can't they were always
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:26.520]  talk that uh local police can't do that unless unless they think you've you know stuck drugs
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:31.320]  or a gun in there an emergency situation when you go to the jail they've got to have somebody the
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:36.600]  same sex search you but now it's just done at the airport they're raping people they're caught in
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:42.840]  pedophilia defrock priest as the head tsa guy in philadelphia this is what's happening it's very
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:53.080]  scary and now congress uh senator paul is talking about doing something but we see representative
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:36:00.520]  marcia blackburn hailing from the great state of tennessee she is taking action as well and
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:06.040]  has introduced hr 3608 and she joins us now a congresswoman thank you so much for uh spending
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:12.840]  time with us that is so good to be with you thanks for having me on to talk about my bill uh tell us
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:17.960]  about your awakening to the tsa and what your bill does and then let's get into some of the
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:26.360]  overall horror stories that you've investigated uh with this uh group yes uh my deal actually is an
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:32.920]  outgrowth of complaints that we were receiving from our constituents you know people would go to
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:41.160]  the airport they would go through this issue with tsa tsa would be unprofessional many times and
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:46.040]  let me say right here there are a lot of good people that work with the tsa we know and understand
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:53.800]  and appreciate that but we also know that there are individuals who are not uh qualified to work
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:37:00.360]  with the tsa who are unprofessional in their conduct but the long story short for me was
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:06.600]  constituents maybe those who had suffered from different surgeries or had implants of different
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:12.760]  types or small children or grandmothers would talk about the very brief treatment that they
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:19.880]  thought was just a really uncalled for and so they would come to us with these complaints
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:25.800]  i would sit down many times with tsa in washington and just found that i was getting
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:33.160]  unsatisfactory answers to the questions that i was asking and so my staff and i started
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:39.640]  looking at uh what was going on with the tsa and there were a couple of things that we discovered
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:49.480]  number one was that through the rulemaking process not through legislation but through the rulemaking
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:38:00.440]  process the tsa had gone about and administratively reclassified their airport security screeners
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:05.880]  which are the people who were to be there to assist the traveling public now that's how
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:11.960]  they're defined in the legislation that was passed that stood up to tsa airport security
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:18.440]  screeners and there there is a customer service agent to assist the traveling public but tsa
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:26.280]  did was to administratively reclassify them they started this process in o five and through the
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:34.600]  rulemaking they took tsa customer service reps out of their customer service uniforms which had
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:41.240]  you know the work shirt or golf shirt with the khaki pants and had a tsa patch on it well they
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:48.360]  removed them from those uniforms and they put them in federal law enforcement type uniforms
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:53.880]  which is what you see them in today which is the dark blue trousers the blue shirt
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:39:03.080]  and they wear a metal badge and congress did not give them the authority to do this they did this
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:10.600]  on their own through the rulemaking so what we thought was let's get them out of these uniforms
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:19.160]  and return them from being called transportation security officer again a title that they gave
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:27.720]  themselves they deemed themselves this title and let's return them to being customer service reps
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:35.720]  and called uh airport security screeners and return them to their original uniforms because
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:44.200]  you know what we are seeing is that they exercise this overreach and authority and they are causing
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:51.320]  hardship for taxpayers who are paying their salary now a couple of other things we found is we were
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:40:03.320]  about this investigation was that um they have gone to a system of giving uh awards and advancements
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:09.880]  and you'll notice they're wearing epaulets on their shoulders now if they have one stripe on their
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:15.640]  epaulets that means they're an officer two stripes means they're a team leader and three
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:24.360]  means they're a supervisor so when you ask someone from tsa what constitutes being called officer
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:32.520]  and i bet alex you know that there are people that become police officers and when you use the
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:39.000]  term officer and referring to them that means that they have a certain amount of training and
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:47.240]  command a certain amount of respect doesn't it yes and what we found out was where what tsa is
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:54.680]  doing is they only have about 80 hours of training and then they are allowed to be called officer
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:41:00.840]  and wear this uniform now let's say if you wanted to go down to the nashfield police department
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:07.080]  and apply to be a police officer there are a couple of things you would need to do one you would
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:15.000]  need to meet certain requirements for making that application they have educational requirements
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:22.520]  work requirements they do a due diligence check on you to be certain that you don't have a criminal
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:29.960]  past uh that there are not uh components in there that would make you a less than desirable employee
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:38.680]  well we found out that tsa is not conducting a lot of due diligence because they have many
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:46.200]  individuals that have committed crimes some of them have committed those crimes while they are on
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:53.880]  duty or while they're wearing their taxpayer paid for government issued uniform and uh we
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:42:02.440]  did a report it's called not on my watch it's available at my website blackburn.house.gov or
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:09.640]  facebook marcia blackburn or twitter is that marcia blackburn and this report details 50
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:17.160]  of the crimes and tsa officers who have been arrested for these crimes you've got sex you've
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:24.840]  got murder you've got pornography you've got impersonating a federal officer uh you there's
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:31.880]  just a variety of crimes that are there well congresswoman i mean sure sure i'm a newshound
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:38.280]  i probably see every month 30 or 40 of them arrested so you're being conservative when you
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:45.240]  show only 50 of the cases of child pornography raping people stealing i saw a report out of
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:52.520]  Newark daily news a few months ago where they have over 250 things stolen by the tsa every
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:59.240]  week at jfk i myself had a gift to one of my daughters when this is about seven years ago
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:05.640]  she was only a few months old a a a rattled teething ring stolen they unpacked the little
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:11.560]  package from tiffany's and stole it so so so when you say 50 things that you chronicle
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:18.760]  that is literally the tip of the iceberg well you're exactly right and what we did was just get
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:27.400]  into 50 of the crimes and we were astounded with what we found and you know what is so
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:34.920]  interesting is since we did that report and made it public and filed our legislation which is called
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:42.120]  the strip act stopped tsa's reach in policy and since we did that we are hearing from people
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:51.560]  all over the country about issues and problems and the tsa not following up with them uh it's
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:59.480]  some of the things are appalling and the manner and the way in which they are treating some of our
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:09.320]  citizens is absolutely appalling completely uncalled for so you know we we have uh we're
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:16.120]  continuing to push through on our legislation i think we're up over 150 co-sponsors on it now
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:21.640]  we have the bipartisan agreement and support in congress that something needs to be done to
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:28.440]  reign in the tsa and you know one of the things we found that seems to exacerbate the issue with
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:38.680]  their uh overreaching their authority is this they now have unionized the tsa so-called officers
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:51.960]  and you've got 46 000 tsa officers if you will who are just to be airport security screeners
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:57.080]  bear in mind not a lot of due diligence is done on their hiring washington reagan airport
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:03.880]  they advertise it discount gas stations in the area and it's on top pizza boxes no i know let me
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:07.640]  just stop you for a moment congresswoman because obviously you're spearheading this we want to
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:12.600]  commend you the bill is hr 3608 and at the time we've got left i want you to be able to cover
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:17.320]  other areas of this fight and how we get behind you to try to restore this big area of the constitution
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:25.400]  that's being violated but what about the mission creep a more like mission gallop where right here
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:30.520]  where i live in texas i'm in austin but in gallus i've told people this like a year ago they didn't
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:36.120]  believe it it's finally in the newspaper i had family that saw it but now in houston they set up
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:43.320]  warrantless checkpoints on the highways and roads bus stations train terminals and they go on buses
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:50.200]  and they pull cars over well you know in tennessee two years ago tsa quote inspectors the viper
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:56.920]  teams were out there and they were commanding a military and local police and the state police
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:46:02.280]  with highway checkpoints so it's happened in your state what about that i mean what about
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:07.800]  jurisdiction even if they were federal officers since when are they running around out of their
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:14.760]  jurisdiction so you got fake officers out of their jurisdiction that's right see tsa officers have
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:20.600]  no authority to arrest anybody if they have a problem at all they have to do what you and i do
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:28.440]  and call the police and what we have seen these are called a viper team that you're referencing
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:39.080]  the itr there's a intermodal preparedness response team now these teams as you said have been on our
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:46.120]  highways uh what we are trying to do is to return them to the airport to assist the traveling
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:51.960]  public as they go through the airport the strip act does that because let me tell you something
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:47:02.680]  there is no business the tsa has no business being on our city buses our subways our trains
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:12.600]  our highways and you know when the fbi or the cia gets a tip and they're going to go about
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:22.520]  trying to stop terrorist attack or to uh interdict some kind of situation they are working on
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:30.040]  actionable intelligence the tsa just does their searches randomly they can pull over anybody
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:36.440]  they can stop anybody they can randomly search anybody because they say so just like they made
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:41.720]  themselves just like they made themselves officers i mean congress had to create the fbi
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:46.680]  they had to go through an approval process the states had to be created they have constitutions
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:53.240]  under city and county charters they're able under the law to to to to hire people that are trained
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:58.360]  in the constitution due process bonded and then now they just announced themselves god
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:03.320]  look the only reason i raise this parallel and i know there's some good people that work there
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:07.800]  but that's like saying there's some good people in nazi germany hitler just created the brown
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:14.280]  shirts as well stalin did the same thing all authoritarian systems seek to create a new type
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:21.160]  of goon force outside of the original military and police training system and and and that's
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:29.400]  exactly what i see congresswoman happening here well it has been of such concern to us and that
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:38.520]  is why we continue to go after it the tsa has no business doing anything about working as airport
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:46.200]  security screeners in our nation's airport and assisting the traveling public in that regard
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:53.400]  and our goal is to get them out of these uniforms to get them out of these shirts to get them out
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:49:03.720]  of these badges and to return them to doing uh that simple task of system we are incredibly
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:11.960]  concerned with this overreach in this mission well and uh the unionization and lack of regard
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:18.280]  for the traveling public and you know we just uh it's time to put a halt to it my legislation
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:22.680]  is the very first step in getting that done yes man we've only got about eight minutes left with
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:26.440]  you and again many gracious to give us this much time we just want to commend you we know
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:30.280]  tennessee is proud to have somebody up there that'll actually stand up for the bill of rights and
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:36.040]  constitution that is such a rarity these days i mean think of how far the tsa has already you know
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:41.400]  gone now i'm sure you know that uh first they were like we're going to make dock workers go
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:47.080]  through us to get a job and then now we're going to make uh i'm sure you saw in um new mexico last
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:53.720]  year a judge ruled the tsa had to train the public schools on their security so it's okay if they come
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:50:00.200]  train you now you can violate people's rights and put your hand on somebody's pants uh william
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:06.280]  shatner uh you had his pants pulled down last week i am afraid to fly with my wife and children
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:11.480]  just because my daughters and my son have been taught don't let somebody touch you and they've
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:17.320]  had top psychologists come out and say this is training children so that people like jerry sandusky
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:22.440]  can have their way with them i mean how do i you know teach my children stranger danger don't let
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:29.880]  somebody touch you but now accept these people well this is one of the reasons we want to put
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:37.080]  a stop to this you know the tsa bear in mind the tsa has not captured one terrorist they have not
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:46.760]  led to the arrest or capture of one terrorist and this overreach all of these machinations that
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:53.160]  they're going through at the airport this is also uncalled for so you know we do appreciate the help
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:51:00.280]  of people who are going to work with us to get this rained back in it is um it's just something
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:05.000]  that we've got to do it's the step we've got to take before this gets any further out of control
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:11.880]  you're right uh i want to get into the lying here because you're up on all of this but for
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:16.920]  some of the new listeners they said three years ago we're not groping children even though we had
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:21.000]  hundreds of videos of them even pulling children's pants off and their shirts off
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:25.400]  two three-year-olds taking babies diapers off then it happened to one of my employees the
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:29.400]  drugs report linked to it and it ended up being a national story that became the biggest story in
[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:34.360]  the country for about three months as the tsa started saying we don't do that then they said well
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:41.400]  now we're going to stop under 12 courthouses were doing it in in colorata and florida until people
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:46.440]  pointed out it was illegal to do that to under 18 year olds so they had to stop they also had the
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:52.360]  naked body scanners uh you know going in that it's been shown violate federal law here but also in
[01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:58.920]  england so it's all part of this lawless power grab but then this year they were stripping down
[01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:05.880]  women uh you know 85 90 year old 95 year old women taking them behind closed doors making
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:10.520]  old people get out of wheelchairs that can't even walk making other people help them screaming at
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:14.840]  old people happened to my grandmother who's almost 90 flying back from a wedding screaming at a
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:20.200]  movie theater and move quicker on crutches i mean it's like our induction into a prison or something
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:25.400]  a slave training but but but what about holding them accountable for the 40 billion that they
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:29.800]  estimate we lose a year in tourism the state department's having to run tv ads in europe
[01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:34.520]  saying come here we're not a police state well yes we are i mean i'm ranting here basically
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:39.320]  throwing ourselves you know on the mercy of congress but what about the line what about the
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:43.080]  culture of saying we don't strip search all ladies and then being caught or we don't strip
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:47.480]  search children or there's no radiation from the scanners they get caught lying how do i mean
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:55.080]  how did the culture of this get so villainous i you know i wish i had an answer for you
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:53:03.160]  and i i don't know i but i had a constituent yesterday that i thought summed it up pretty well
[01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:10.120]  i was doing a listening session and they came up to me after it was over and they said marcia i
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:17.240]  just got to tell you they said i feel like we're looking at a time when it is a government run amuck
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:24.920]  when it is government run wild and they talked about the tsa videos and these judicial conferences
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:31.240]  that are in elaborate locations and they said you know i just want to see some government
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:38.840]  restraint and another constituent had said when when is congress going to put some mandates on
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:49.320]  these bureaucracies and agencies and require them to comply with the law and to act in a
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:55.400]  responsible manner under the law and i i thought you know that's a pretty good question and it's
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:54:02.760]  a pretty good way of summing it up and i think it is distressing to individuals to see their
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:10.120]  government and employees of the federal government conduct themselves in the manner that some not
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:18.360]  all but some of these tsa agents who probably if a thorough background check were done would not
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:27.640]  have been hired in the first place i think it is um it just so demeaning to individuals to be treated
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:36.600]  in such a disrespectful manner by some of the tsa agents who raise their voices who bark out orders
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:43.480]  who act as if they're the authority because they're wearing a uniform and a badge and with my children
[01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:50.520]  and grandchildren i want them to understand that when someone has worked hard and wears a uniform
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:55.320]  whether it's one of our men and women in military whether it's a policeman a fireman a highway
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:55:05.480]  patrolman that i want them to to show appropriate respect for that individual and it's you know
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:13.160]  when they are treated so disrespectfully by a tsa agent who should not be wearing that uniform in
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:19.240]  the first place it gets to be pretty difficult to make that argument so we're just going to keep
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:25.320]  plugging away at trying to move this legislation forward build support for it on a bipartisan
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:35.320]  basis and hopefully be able to um to return them to working in the airport yes ma'am a
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:43.000]  workshop in trousers with the patch and look at our traveling public and say we are here to serve
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:49.080]  you how may we assist well and there's more than one way to skin a cat we're we need to support you
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:53.880]  and others but there's also letters to the editor calling in to talk radio to criticize it keep the
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:58.440]  issue on the front burner and in houston people they had lawyers get involved and others and point
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:03.480]  out this is unconstitutional that anybody randomly searching people so they had to pull out of houston
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:13.720]  that's you're exactly right and look what we've got here i call it um the network of you alex and i
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:21.000]  want people to get on their email list and contact their friends and neighbors and say this is a great
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.520]  deal contact their network get people energized exactly don't just say oh thank goodness that
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:31.320]  congresswoman you know blackburn is up there or there's ron paul or alex jones or somebody
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:37.000]  or rand paul we need everybody to do a little bit together many hands make light work final
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.720]  final question on another subject that just popped in my mind what do you make of attorney general
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:46.360]  eric holder and fashion furious and the fact that it's come out that they did perjure themselves
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:51.320]  and that they're now stopping protest against him in front of the white house i mean if he
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:55.560]  doesn't get in trouble for this does this not really start discrediting the entire justice
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:57:02.680]  department who's now shielding him i i think that with the contempt charges that we filed last week
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:08.920]  both civilly and criminally that it does point out that there are some serious problems with the
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:15.560]  attorney general and with the conduct that has been exhibited through fast and furious i think
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:22.360]  you're exactly right on that are you because you're up there and i know you voted for contempt
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:27.000]  are you hearing any rumblings about bringing back what congress had in the past and exercising the
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:35.400]  authority to uh to clap him in irons i you know we're going to let chairman isa who has been
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:43.160]  handling this proceed and i understand that he's moving forward with hiring a council and uh when
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:47.640]  we get back next week i think the chairman will have an update with us on the progress that
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:52.600]  thank you is the word i'm getting though is that this is shaping up to be a watergate
[01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:59.880]  i i think that it may and you know i'm going to show the chairman the respect that he has earned
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:06.040]  and let him be the one to say what's going to be coming next sure i understand but obviously
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:11.240]  your constituents raised fast and furious to you oh yes we talked about that and salindra

[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:40.200]  well let's see we don't have a choice do we well you could take your country back but
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:43.400]  you've thrown out a couple governments and every new one you get just does it because
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:47.800]  they're bought and paid for just like the republicans claim they're against obama care
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:52.280]  written by the insurance companies but then the republican votes for it on the supreme court
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:55.400]  because they're bought and paid for anything else from australia
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:02:02.600]  no look that's it we look loving your show uh long time this is our first time caller

[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:57.560]  week or so i mean it's constant uh there is vaccine waiver forms it's not even a law it's a regulation
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:01.960]  so they trick you and say get the waiver form but then they act like that doesn't exist type in
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:09.720]  right now to google folks showing texas vaccine waiver forms texas vaccine waiver forms every
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:15.720]  state has them there it is vaccine dot info dot net texas vaccine exemption information you scroll

[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:26.920]  form posted and what what government does and there's the link is when they don't have a law
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:36.200]  when they don't have a law they they say oh sign this form and then they administratively try to
[02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:41.880]  trick you and then later say you you know they refuse uh just like the tsa announces we're on

[02:03:56.840 --> 02:04:00.680]  outfit and have you know a badge and start pulling people over writing them tickets you know the
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:07.320]  point is is that it's fraudulent and you can debate the government at any level is fraudulent but

[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:33.320]  where they don't even have to pay for them they just give them to these clinics and administer them
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:37.320]  hey that kind of gets you thinking you know is this a way they're kind of rolling this out do you

[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:12.360]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:24.680]  well in the last hour we have representative marsha blackburn from tennessee on who is fighting
[02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:32.360]  the tsa impersonating federal and state police engaging in violations of due process of law
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:39.000]  and the fourth amendment and calling these crooks out is what's important now of all the agendas if
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:43.720]  you want to know why globally whether it's australia or the united states or england or germany
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:52.360]  going back to 1972 blood was taken from everyone at birth secretly or the parents were told it
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:57.880]  was a blood test and it was put in the cold springs harbor eugenics facility uh it was
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:04.840]  sent to military bases i was given documents 16 years ago by a nurse at an army base uh in san
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:11.720]  antonio uh who who gave me documents it was classified at the time uh and we reported on it
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:15.800]  until about four years ago when they declassified a bunch of it now a bunch of lawsuits have been
[02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:22.680]  lost uh the government's having to back off and try to yeah when i told them when i had my first
[02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:27.160]  born 10 years ago i said i know that's not the law i know that goes to the health department
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:31.960]  and is shaved and sent to a military base they're like don't be a conspiracy theorist and i said
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:36.360]  you're not doing it they said it's the law and i said show me the law i knew it wasn't they and
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:40.360]  they said well you're a child could have a blood disease and i said oh i'll pay a private lab have
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:47.320]  that i knew i knew the psych warfare attack just like the father just called in and said oh i can't
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:52.120]  put my kid in the school you know it's the law they're going to take a shot and i'm like texas
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:58.440]  immunization waiver and it's a waiver to something it's not even a law and i pulled it up and read
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:02.760]  it on air it's all fraud they have the same waiver thing in australia same thing in england
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:07.800]  and they put up newscast saying it's the law it's fraud it's criminal fraud they take your blood
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:11.400]  they try to forcibly inoculate they're now shooting kids up all over the country without
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:16.120]  parental consent you realize how criminal it is but the cops are like but it's the school doing
[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:21.240]  under a federal grant and the grand juries are like okay that it is illegal to do a medical
[02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:25.880]  procedure on a kid that's elective without the parents consent they got to get a form to go to
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:35.080]  the planetarium or the zoo or on a hike but a school function but you can do this again
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:40.040]  again i harp on this because even though i say it every day we had a caller saying
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:45.000]  they're telling me my son's got to have shots well because they're criminals
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:52.200]  they've got the waiver form they're supposed to give you in their cabinet behind them but
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:56.200]  they get money federally when they do this so the reason i'm getting into this
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:11:01.960]  before we go to our next guest rosa quarry of behind the green mask you and agenda 21 who joins
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:06.840]  us via video connection if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv skype means better audio for radio
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:16.840]  listeners just a little side nugget point is that its agenda 21 is the total takeover of the
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:22.120]  environment of the land of businesses where the globalists write the laws and then selectively
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:26.760]  enforce them nothing to do with the environment and we of course sell behind the green mask
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:34.120]  unigen 21 at info warshop.com or info wars.com you get a free citizen rulebook and bumper stickers
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:39.400]  and pens and a bunch of other stuff when you order anything at info wars.com and it supports
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:45.720]  this transmission but that's a side issue every city council person every cop you know every
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:51.240]  bureaucrat every code enforcer every county commissioner every legislator you know and
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:55.960]  it's happening just since our guest was on a few months ago uh you know the new york times
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:00.200]  is saying oh my gosh people are waking up to agenda 21 we better do something and oh they're
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:03.560]  you know they're putting out primers for for local governments to know how to deal with you
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:09.800]  because this is un global governance written by the major major mega corporations you know
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:15.000]  just like cmbc said two weeks ago we're ruled by mega banks global governance through fraud
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:21.880]  and they want to shut the economy down selectively so this is the agenda now you couple agenda 21
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:28.280]  with unesco it deals with the medical tyranny the gun ban that hillary says obama's going to sign
[02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:34.680]  via treaty all of this is real and is happening this is global governance and her book is the best
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:42.280]  little 168 page primer that's well written and well documented on the full spectrum analysis of
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:48.200]  gen 21 that is about half of the new world order agenda this is the bureaucratic carpet bagging
[02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:53.160]  new world order takeover in your local area and i don't care whether you live in germany
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:13:00.760]  or australia or canada it is the exact same operation because it's a un global governance
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:07.800]  code okay so you get this to people and you educate yourself and others it's game over we
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:13.320]  can beat them because people understand 83 percent of the laws in the uk are now made
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:18.360]  by the eu bureaucracy unelected it's the same thing now joining us for the rest of the hour
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:26.440]  we'll take calls come up about 25 30 minutes 800 25 9 9 2 3 1 is rosa quarry asa is executive
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:31.400]  director of the post sustainability institute she's a commercial real estate appraiser specializing
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:36.680]  in imminent domain valuations that's how she learned it was agenda 21 nearly 30 years of
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:41.400]  expert witness analyzing land use and property value in her position as san francisco district
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:45.720]  branch chief of the california department of transportation enabled her to recognize the
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:51.160]  planning revolution sweeping the country she was on the inside and saw it while fighting to stop a
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:55.320]  huge redevelopment project in her city she researched the corporate political financial
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:14:00.600]  interest behind it and found you and agenda 21 impacting every aspect of our lives you and
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:05.240]  agenda 21 sustainable development is a corporate manipulation using green mask of environmental
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:11.080]  concern to forward a globalist plan rosa speaks across the nation including recently it's the
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:16.280]  international conference of global governance that included president valloff claus of the
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:21.160]  check republic prime minister john howard of australia she's a regular blogger on her website
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:26.040]  democrats against you and agenda 21 dot com good to see it's bipartisan her new book behind the
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:31.560]  green mask agenda 21 is available at info wars dot com and on her site okay we go to her now
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:36.760]  intro there what is the what is agenda 21 for new listeners why is it important and
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:41.800]  what are the new big developments i mean is it safe to say the battle is joined right now rosa
[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:47.880]  you said it we i'm actually coming back from an east coast tour and i want you to know that the
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:53.960]  resistance is in gear and people are out there fighting all over the united states and across
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:15:00.920]  the world so this is a very engaged fight and we are going to win this for people who don't know
[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:08.040]  what agenda 21 is it's basically it's not what is agenda 21 it's almost what isn't and you're
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:15.640]  going to look long and hard to find anything now that isn't agenda 21 it is the blueprint it is the
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:25.400]  action plan to inventory and control all land all water all plants all minerals all construction
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:33.160]  all animals all means of production all energy all information and all human beings in the world
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:40.120]  it is a completely comprehensive plan it's global and it's implemented locally and that
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:46.520]  is where you're going to see it in your town right there in your town it is in every single town
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:53.560]  all across the united states and the world right now well said and now we're getting the
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:58.040]  announcements they're going to tear up the old roads shut down the countryside folks think they're
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:03.000]  going to run to the countryside and escape the agenda 21 takeover explain what's really happening
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:08.040]  there unfortunately there really is nowhere to go people come up to me after my speeches and they
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:13.720]  go hey rosa so where's the good place to go and i'm like nowhere you have to stay right where you
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:19.880]  are and fight it in your town because there is no switzerland in this war this is a global
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:25.800]  governance plan and there is nowhere to go so what you have to do is recognize it because it
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:31.640]  doesn't come with flashing lights and it's not called agenda 21 that's how they can say that
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:37.480]  oh you're kind of crazy or a tinfoil hat when you bring it up that the fact is what it looks like
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:43.880]  in your town is your roads being pulverized in your suburban and rural areas it looks like a
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:49.960]  closure of post offices and schools and in the rural areas it looks like your comprehensive or
[02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:58.200]  master plan vision 2020 vision 2035 our town 2050 that's what it looks like it looks like
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:05.240]  smart meters it looks like smart water gas and electric meters it looks like well monitoring
[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:12.840]  it looks like closure of uh roads that go into your rural and wild forest lands it looks like you
[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:18.760]  not being able to get out into the countryside anymore and it looks like high density urban
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:25.400]  development paid for with your tax dollars right there in the center of your town this is a global
[02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:31.640]  governance plan it is designed to create a parallel government that is actually going to
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:38.360]  destroy your opportunity to have any impact at all on what goes on in your government this is a
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:46.120]  takeover it's a totalitarian takeover and it is happening right now in your town and there you
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:52.200]  were working inside as the district branch chief of the california department transportation
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:57.000]  that's how you were first able to recognize this yourself from the inside but you know you're a
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:03.800]  democrat uh you're somebody who's liberal on many issues i like that fact because this isn't about
[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:10.360]  republican democrat where certain groups own certain uh areas and i love how these so-called
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:14.680]  democratic institutions always say there's no global governance there's no world government
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:19.560]  there's no corporates takeover uh you know you're you know it's code for race or all the stuff
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:25.640]  when the banks are publicly writing this admitting this is their takeover plan and then you and then
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:30.200]  democrats hear it and they automatically won't respond i mean a lot of republicans won't because
[02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:37.720]  oh that's that crazy stuff when it's really what's happening it has nothing to do with republican
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:43.480]  democrat or you know stuff like that in fact i saw an article you know saying democrat lesbian
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:48.520]  feminist draws cheers at tea party when a democrat lesbian feminist receives wild applause at tea
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:53.560]  party meeting talking about you something newsworthy must be happening speaking to a packed crowd look
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:19:00.440]  it isn't about what somebody does in their bedroom it's about a global corporate takeover of america
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:05.480]  that's exactly right you know we have to break that right left gang mentality because we're really
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:11.240]  being manipulated you know this is not uh yeah i'm a democrat i've actually been attacked and
[02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:17.000]  vilified by democrats and by democratic central committees around the united states the fact is
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:21.080]  you know what are they going to do encourage me from the party and burn my party card just
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:26.520]  because i'm questioning what's going on because unfortunately this is being accepted a lot by
[02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:32.280]  the left but it's partly because they don't understand that when they're looking at globalization
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:40.600]  when they're looking at wto uh gmo food independence uh great um you know uh university

[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:54.740]  okay now the question is do we all work for central bankers that's what I want to address
[02:24:54.740 --> 02:25:00.520]  to our guests tonight is this global governance at last is it one world the central bankers
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:06.040]  in charge Jim Jim Yorio you say we've got some downside here a correction in the markets
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:11.200]  fine but aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do aren't we all
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:16.320]  just counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke putt and that we won't go any lower than
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:21.960]  say 5% down from here of course we are because if we look at the economic data there's nothing
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:27.280]  to get excited about in that so we yesterday and again that's CNBC and they go on for four
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:31.200]  more minutes saying we're slaves to foreign banks but that's a good thing because they
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:36.960]  take good care of us and who writes such a 21 Goldman Sachs JP Morgan shame folks caught
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:44.040]  Barclay CEO quits after caught working in the US and Europe and England fixing interest
[02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:51.160]  rates so they had an unfair trade advantage CEO of MF global caught robbing people and
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:55.960]  you go look at who funds as you did 21 and who funds all this it's the banks they're
[02:25:55.960 --> 02:26:00.880]  the global government they're it they're it and it's weird you've got the southern
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:06.440]  probably law center the ADL CNN nightline all saying I'm evil as I say banks from the
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:11.760]  new world order and that it's code for racism and we're even talking about race here and
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:16.440]  then separately every financial publication is saying world governments here thank God
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:22.400]  the bankers took over and the articles even laugh and giggle and say yeah they took this
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:28.720]  over they manipulated us and it cute so it's like this weird world where it doesn't exist
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:35.560]  but it does exist and then a Jenna 21 is designed in morey strong in the UN's own words to shut
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:40.840]  down society and I'm supposed to be happy about that NAFTA and GATT and all of this
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:46.120]  was meant to destroy us and render us down to slaves they don't want us uppity they don't
[02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:51.200]  want us consuming if you go to Whole Foods there's all these magazines about you know
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:58.800]  the post industrial and how chic it is to be poor and austerity and how sexy it is let's
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:04.200]  go back to our guest author and researcher Rosa Corey Rosa what is life under Jenna 21
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:08.760]  this is a short segment long segment coming up but what will it do I mean what are the
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:13.560]  greatest hits of a Jenna 21 well you know what you're seeing it right now because it's
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:18.400]  not something out there in the distance it is happening right now in your town so are
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:23.480]  you out of work do you are you feeling like you can't afford to pay your utility bills
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:28.080]  now are you being told that utility costs are going to be going up like seven or nine
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:34.520]  percent a year even though you've been conserving and restricting your use this is what it looks
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:39.920]  like it's going to look more and more you know this is the new poverty right it's the
[02:27:39.920 --> 02:27:44.440]  new frugality that's what the American Planning Association calls it and it's supposed to
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:49.720]  be a good thing that you don't really need that we're defying redefining progress and
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:54.120]  then what that means is that you're going to be out of work you're going to be struggling
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:28:00.840]  you were talking about Australia earlier Queensland which is a state in Australia has now made
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:05.800]  it so that if you're living in public housing and you know if government subsidized housing
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:10.000]  and your apartment is too big for you you're going to either have to get out of there or
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:16.120]  take in people that are going to be quartered with you like the military I mean we are talking
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:22.440]  about a loss of your ability to control your own life and that's what it looks like in
[02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:27.880]  your agenda 21 because you really truly are seeing your property tax and transportation
[02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:33.600]  tax dollars used to restrict your use of your land and used to take away private property
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:37.920]  rights restrict you for where you're going to be able to live what you're going to be
[02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:42.160]  able to eat because you're going to be living in a transit village with a food shed ringing
[02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:46.720]  it and if there's not enough calories that are being produced by that food shed you're
[02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:50.720]  not going to be able to get food from anywhere else so that means you're going to be reducing
[02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:55.840]  your caloric intake we're talking about major restrictions and they are coming your way right
[02:28:55.840 --> 02:29:02.480]  now you're seeing them right now and of course this is bank pushed B of A Bank of America
[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:08.240]  is a very big player in this you'll find huge corporations it's a mega corporation takeover
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:16.240]  totalitarian it's a fascist state globalization is a totalitarian takeover by corporations
[02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:21.960]  mixing in with non-governmental organizations and governments so that you have no way of

[02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:35.040]  that's why the checkpoints are everywhere that all the internal training manuals say are
[02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:42.520]  for us people that are anti u n anti world government agenda twenty one they tell the
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:46.840]  cops that's a code word if you hear that that's a cop killer term or if you hear somebody
[02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:50.920]  talk about posse common taught us that's a cop killer term we've shown you the training
[02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:56.240]  manuals here on air so the cop didn't know what agenda twenty one is they just hear that
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:34:01.800]  they go you want to kill me this is how they manipulate everybody show that as they take
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:08.280]  over people have already been demonized that are smart enough to know what's coming but
[02:34:08.280 --> 02:34:12.400]  again what does the u n say what does morey strong say what do they all say economies
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:17.560]  are too big their job is to shut them down this is the new economy where they all live
[02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:26.360]  in lavish palaces though remember you live like a slave rosa quarry is a researcher and
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:30.120]  developer and she also worked in the state government at the highest levels when she
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:34.320]  discovered this was going on i've been talking about it since the early nineteen mid nineteen
[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:38.080]  nineties a lot of people have but nobody knew what it was now because it's really coming
[02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:44.080]  into effect people are getting upset so so rosa author of behind the green mask book
[02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:50.360]  agenda twenty one breakdown other facets where it's being implemented examples and the type
[02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:55.160]  of awakening you're seeing other other areas people should be made aware of the big u n
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:35:02.760]  conference they just had down in brazil rosa quarry wow well that's saying a lot there's
[02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:08.000]  a lot to talk about here and i want people to know that this is war that there is an
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:13.840]  occupying force across the world that has taken us over and we are waking up there's
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:20.320]  a tremendous resistance all across the world and i want you to know that you are not alone
[02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:26.080]  people are taking over and dominating government meetings now they are going and we are going
[02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:31.400]  in as groups as coalitions of groups that you would never see ordinarily groups of people
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:37.360]  on the left and the right who are laying aside their petty differences and taking back our
[02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:43.800]  sovereignty all across the world i was speaking at an international global governance conference
[02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:50.440]  and one of the other speakers was president of the Czech republic and he said to me you
[02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:55.560]  know what we fought to get our independence from the soviet union and now we are under
[02:35:55.560 --> 02:36:02.120]  the thrall of brussels we are under control of the e u we have lost our sovereignty we
[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:07.280]  don't want that here in the united states we want to encourage all people who want to
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:14.200]  be free to be free so here's what happens this is a global plan implemented locally
[02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:20.000]  what you want to do is take back your government this is a regional government that is being
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.120]  imposed through planning they are telling you that if you want to be able to compete
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:30.680]  regionally in an economic sense that you have to join with other cities counties and states
[02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:36.880]  and you have to erase your jurisdictional boundaries this is a lie this is a way to take control
[02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:42.880]  of your government by mega corporations and non-profit non-governmental groups that will
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:49.280]  then control what happens locally by using money they use federal dollars and you know
[02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:55.120]  this was a plan that came down top down through the president's council on sustainable development
[02:36:55.120 --> 02:37:01.840]  right into every federal agency in the united states back in 1993 and they all changed their
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:07.040]  policies their administrative policies and they are using money they're using grants
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:13.440]  and they're using restrictions on transportation dollars to control what happens in your town
[02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:17.720]  so if your town wants any of that money they're going to have to play ball and that means
[02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:24.400]  build smart growth and smart growth is your future hardscape for your poverty this is
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:31.120]  high density urban development with no possibility for you to move freely or determine where you're
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:36.360]  going to live and work so what you want to do is fight this fight it together with everyone
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:42.600]  you can get so what you want to do go down to those meetings where they say come on down
[02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:48.440]  to your vision 2035 plan meeting or come on down to your scenic by way meeting we want
[02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:52.600]  to see what you think because the truth is they don't want to know what you think they
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:57.040]  merely want to give the impression that they're getting your opinion so that they can impose
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:38:02.200]  these restrictions on you and say that it was your plan that is a lie what you want
[02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:07.000]  to do is go down there and take over those meetings you can do it you want to recall
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:12.440]  elected officials who are on those regional boards these are metropolitan planning organizations
[02:38:12.440 --> 02:38:18.000]  and councils of government you want to get rid of those groups you want to go down recall
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:23.080]  those people you want to do it in a group it's very easy to recall an elected official
[02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:28.400]  you can do it put that in with your town recall and then your city or county and see what
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:34.320]  comes up there's forms on online you can use you can use our pliers to let people know
[02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:40.360]  what ickly is you want to raise awareness awareness is the first step in the resistance
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:45.600]  action is the second step we are fighting back all across the United States and all
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:52.240]  across the world and here's the way it looks it looks like people going down to government
[02:38:52.240 --> 02:38:57.200]  meetings where the government has called in men with guns to line the room and those are
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:03.280]  police officers they also are listening to you they will hear what is going on you want
[02:39:03.280 --> 02:39:08.400]  to speak the truth take your three minutes stand up and say we want to kick ickly out
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:13.560]  we do not want regional government we do not want to use our property tax and transportation
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:20.920]  tax dollars to actually create our own poverty you are using our tax dollars to sink our
[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:27.400]  economy with high cost trains high speed trains to nowhere they're just sinking our dollars
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:33.280]  what they're doing is using endless war to use up our resources and restrict our ability
[02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:38.520]  to be independent this is a plan to create total dependence on government so that you
[02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:44.040]  are not able to speak out because you have no voice we don't want to allow it to get
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:49.800]  to that point there are no heroes no one on the sidelines everyone out and fight this
[02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:55.480]  plan you can't wait for someone else to do it for you this is it if you're on the left
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:40:00.320]  join in with everyone else this has been a hijacking of the environmental movement you
[02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:06.640]  are being used there is no truth in the green movement it is a way to take your money and
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:12.280]  manipulate you and restrict your ability to live free do not fall for these plants they
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:19.720]  are simply designed to jar to use jargon to manipulate you and use mind control techniques
[02:40:19.720 --> 02:40:24.800]  like the Delphi technique to convince you that this is all a good thing it is not it
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:30.320]  is a way to take over your ability to have an independent voice in your government so
[02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:35.960]  you will find that you are going to be jailed you will be living in a literal prison you
[02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:40.120]  will not be able to travel freely you will not be able to work where you wish you will
[02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:45.520]  not be able to speak freely you will find that your ability to be independent is severely
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:51.440]  restricted for instance in the town next to mine it's against the law to smoke in your
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:56.360]  apartment my county is making it against the law to smoke in your apartment obesity will
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:41:02.240]  be a crime more and more things will be crimes and they will be selectively enforced this
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:07.360]  is the way that they take over this is what it looks like people who have not lived through
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:11.960]  totalitarian takeover do not understand that they're not going to roll through your street
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:17.680]  with with tanks they don't have to they're doing it without guns and without tanks they
[02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:22.560]  are taking it making it they're misidentifying wetlands they restrict your use out there
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:27.760]  in the rural areas they're putting more and more restrictions on what you can do out in
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:33.920]  the caskills out in the desert areas out in Florida and they are releasing wild carnivores
[02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:38.960]  into the wild they're restricting your ability to use your water they're using smart meters
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:44.000]  smart gas electric and water meters and this is what it looks like this is what a takeover
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:50.280]  from the inside looks like you can fight it join the resistance we're all over the nation
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:55.400]  all over the world and we are fighting now and we will win this we are winning now this
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:42:00.680]  is what winning looks like when they start calling you a tinfoil hat and smearing you
[02:42:00.680 --> 02:42:04.560]  in the press that's when you know you're winning because they don't come after you unless you
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:12.480]  have the ball and we have the ball now Alabama has passed SB 477 which is the property rights
[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:20.200]  due process act which says that no law can be made that imposes agenda 21 in the state
[02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:25.880]  of Alabama and that no money can go to ickley or any other non-profit organization that
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:33.120]  is imposing agenda 21 on the people of the state of Alabama let's make these laws come
[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:38.240]  all the way across the United States yes they'll be litigated but we will be there supporting
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:45.320]  we want to fight back and we can do it we will win this Rosa Corey she is the author
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:52.320]  of behind the green mask unit to 21 and as you know that she's pointed and focused like
[02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:59.240]  a laser beam her book is as well get it get it out to everyone you know because this is
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:04.960]  so outrageous what they're doing I've been to smart growth conferences and they admit
[02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:10.200]  it's about money and power grabs and they admit that the insiders are exempt I mean
[02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:14.120]  I've watched Austin which is one of the worst places in the country it's a wonderful place
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:19.840]  to live but we've allowed these fake liberals to take over and they've also got the fake
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:26.120]  conservatives up there with them and they will go and take a family's 5000 acre ranch
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:31.120]  that they've had for a hundred years I have these people on the show and take it and pay
[02:43:31.120 --> 02:43:36.600]  it maybe five cents on the dollar they waited six seven years took the restrictions off
[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:41.080]  and the city said oh it's not going to be a preserve now it's going to be malls and
[02:43:41.080 --> 02:43:45.880]  and high density living but it's okay because we're making a high density living the point
[02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:51.920]  is they stole the land and all over the country they are coming in and saying we're going
[02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:55.360]  to bulldoze your neighborhood on this lake it's for the earth and then turning around
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:44:01.480]  and turning it into a high rise development and they know it it's not like your city
[02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:07.800]  council in most cases of a big city is unconscious they are financed normally realtors normally
[02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:12.240]  developers and then they call themselves environmentalists and all they're going to do steal your
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:17.280]  land and and they hire these green cops who don't care about GMO or toxic waste dumping
[02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:22.360]  or University of Texas burying toxic waste on the edge of Austin no no no real issues
[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:29.200]  like Fukushima overfishing not a problem it's all about home inspectors in your face taking
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:36.680]  over your life Department of Defense over the rural commission now it's all about spying
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:44.720]  on you it is pure authoritarianism just as you said Rosa conscious systematic takeover
[02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:49.480]  using fines and fees to bankrupt you I mean I know you see the reports of the lemonade
[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:55.520]  stands the Amish the people selling you know pumpkins on the side of the road getting arrested
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:45:02.280]  and even Forbes asked a few months ago what's the war about on on the Amish or on the lemonade
[02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:07.360]  stands and they've said we don't want you using cash for garage sales we we're going
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:14.160]  to shut those down it's it's happening just like what we've seen with healthcare written
[02:45:14.160 --> 02:45:19.320]  by the insurance companies coming in and making you buy it so the insurance companies
[02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:24.400]  can now control the care but claiming its socialism when it's something completely different
[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:30.880]  you know this is everyone has to remember this is an inventory and control plan so
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:35.320]  when you find out that for instance they're inventorying every single tree in the state
[02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:39.640]  of New Hampshire if anyone's ever flown over New Hampshire that's all they've got there
[02:45:39.640 --> 02:45:44.960]  is trees the idea that this is a micro plan where they go you know we're talking about
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:50.880]  drones domestic surveillance national defense authorization act USA patriot act we're talking
[02:45:50.880 --> 02:45:56.840]  about control of us and every single thing on this planet and in order to control you
[02:45:56.840 --> 02:46:02.680]  have to inventory and we are in the inventory phase right now primarily although we're moving
[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:08.000]  into control and that's why people are beginning to recognize that something is really happening
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:13.440]  because when you go you know when you're trying to get a permit to build on your property
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:18.400]  and you find out for instance that you have a wetland there that you had no idea was there
[02:46:18.400 --> 02:46:23.080]  and you're going to have to pay a thirty seven thousand dollar fine every day because of
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:28.600]  that supposed wetland you know that's what happened to the socket family of Idaho and
[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:32.880]  they fought and went all the way to the Supreme Court your federal government bought them
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:37.640]  all the way to the US Supreme Court where they won but what did they win the right to
[02:46:37.640 --> 02:46:43.640]  challenge the EPA so you know we are in a situation now where every single person is
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:49.240]  beginning to feel the pinch where we're all being feeling as if we are under scrutiny
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:54.560]  we're noticing that for instance if you don't mow your lawn it's a misdemeanor you're finding
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:58.320]  that you are there are more and more things that are crime more and more things you can
[02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:03.120]  be held accountable for and what that means is there are going to be more and more people
[02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:08.880]  who will go along to get along either because they are forced to because they want to be
[02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:14.600]  the good guy pat on the back little you know insider totie shell with the government or
[02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:19.160]  somebody who just you know is too stupid to recognize that they shouldn't be in or they're
[02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:24.480]  making money off of it I want to go to calls absolutely let's talk about that there are
[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:30.160]  a lot of people you know there are partners your government is partnering with nonprofits
[02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:36.960]  and corporations your government the EPA is in 501C3 charitable organizations literally
[02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:43.800]  a partner with for instance the American Planning Association a private corporation with ICCLE
[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:50.800]  with the American Farmland Trust with Walmart with special interest groups and you are paying
[02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:57.200]  for this and you are unable to make an impact unless you take this over we have been asleep
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:03.400]  too long look it's very simple I've seen the cases all over the country where the feds
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:08.960]  just show up and say you've had gore seafood on the south Texas coast for 70 years we just
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:14.200]  say you can't have it anymore we're taking it no money I mean it's getting so brazen
[02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:18.920]  now where these mega corporations just want to take whatever they want through government
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:23.680]  and the crimes are just mounting I want to go to some phone calls and but I also wanted
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:27.440]  to talk about some of the horror stories that you've been witnessing as of late but let's
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:33.680]  let's go to a call here let's talk to Chris in Texas you're on the air welcome hey Alex
[02:48:33.680 --> 02:48:40.120]  hey buddy hey I'm a quick question I was just wondering if you ever touched on the subject
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:47.280]  about the capitalist maximus I'm sorry I'm kind of nervous so you have a question on
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:55.800]  agenda 21 yes agenda 21 is capitalism neutral maxima it's where if you look at your driver's
[02:48:55.800 --> 02:49:02.640]  license that your name is all in capital letters I was just wondering if the feds what they
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:07.800]  do is they just administratively outside of law they had a congresswoman on last segment
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:13.000]  just do whatever they want it's called tyranny there's not a lot to all that UCC all cap
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:18.640]  stuff I mean you magically put another name on your driver's license they don't care but
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:23.480]  I appreciate your call sir let's go to Nate in California you're on the air with our guests

[02:49:31.880 --> 02:49:43.400]  thank your guest for putting all the stuff out I really kind of worry about the clamp
[02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:50.440]  down on everything I really kind of imagine that I kind of foresee that eventually they'll
[02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:58.080]  probably start finding people because they're going to go through the trash they're recycling
[02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:06.000]  all the trash that goes to the dump and I can only imagine that they'll be able to take
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:13.120]  your name and address and then cross-reference it with like the last four digits on your
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:19.040]  kind of receipt from a debit card or something like that and those are what they have is
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:24.120]  they have RFID readers that read everything they're putting on all the new products is
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:28.200]  already in England it's already going into Miami and then they will find you thousands
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:32.760]  of dollars per item and just keep raising the prices I appreciate your call we're going
[02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:37.400]  to come back and get roses take on that but that's a big part of it is that they're going

[02:50:42.640 --> 02:50:45.800]  are buying them all up they're going to charge you more for energy because they're going
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:50.640]  to shut down all their competition and then make general electric exempt that's why general
[02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:56.680]  electric funds all this it's a monopoly it's mafia government but instead of the mafia

[02:54:46.320 --> 02:54:50.840]  plan to want to kill people and then I was bringing up to our guests you know some of
[02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:56.360]  the examples of the horror stories but rosa quarry that is the rest of the story agenda
[02:54:56.360 --> 02:55:02.360]  21 admits that in the u.n. documents as you know they want an 80 to 90 percent world population
[02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:06.960]  reduction so yes that is the plan that's why they're teaching us that we're garbage that
[02:55:06.960 --> 02:55:13.640]  humans are scum through the fake environmental movement you know this is I one thing I say
[02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:18.600]  which is really a tough thing to say and that is that I you know the Nazis did not really
[02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:27.720]  lose because what we're seeing is the re-election of that kind of that kind of government that
[02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:34.280]  kind of philosophy that kind of all for the common good that is communitarianism and what
[02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:39.320]  we're seeing especially Siemens Corporation which was a German corporation about to go
[02:55:39.320 --> 02:55:44.520]  bankrupt before Hitler generously supplied them with slave labor from the concentration
[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:51.360]  camps Siemens pushes agenda 21 big time sustainable community strategies they give awards they
[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:58.680]  give grants we're talking about IBM they also collaborated with the enemy during World War
[02:55:58.680 --> 02:56:04.440]  II they made it possible for the Germans to be able to know who was in the IBM invented
[02:56:04.440 --> 02:56:10.840]  computers yes no race mixing studies yes and you know all those punch cards and the computers
[02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:17.080]  that the Germans had came from a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM they're in Germany also GE
[02:56:17.080 --> 02:56:24.680]  which also collaborated with the enemy during World War II and GE makes huge these are the
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:30.200]  companies that are really pushing agenda 21 because they're exempt from the carbon taxes
[02:56:30.200 --> 02:56:34.920]  Obama signed it let's jam in a call David in California you're on the air do you have a question
[02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:41.560]  for the guest I do have a question I was at our city council last night one of the corporations
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:46.600]  that they're building the stack and pack housing they actually appointed the director of it to our
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:52.120]  planning commission only two people in the city showed up to contest it I moved from Los Angeles
[02:56:52.120 --> 02:56:56.280]  Lancaster California was running away from this stuff they're stealing land left to right and
[02:56:56.280 --> 02:57:02.840]  the control grid is already in place there yeah so they also went over the plan of the new security
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:09.000]  systems downtown my question is well my question is how do you how do you stand up to these people
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:14.440]  just by yourself well they're total criminals but go ahead it's tough you can do it though and you
[02:57:14.440 --> 02:57:20.760]  are doing it you went you were there now here's what you do next you get out your go to your computer
[02:57:20.760 --> 02:57:28.520]  and you make up a flyer we've got flyer examples on our website which is democrats against unagenda21.com
[02:57:28.520 --> 02:57:33.160]  and also in my book you want to make up flyers I know this sounds like it's not going to work
[02:57:33.160 --> 02:57:38.600]  no no it works listen you battle then more people will join you and then you go into the next phase
[02:57:38.600 --> 02:57:43.880]  yes and you want to raise awareness this is what your job is now you are in the resistance your

[02:57:54.840 --> 02:58:00.600]  to go to those meetings you want to bring them down by telling them that we will not and by the way
[02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:05.720]  we're beating them all over the place if we'll just resist them because it's so just like he said
[02:58:05.720 --> 02:58:10.920]  the head of the local building operation that's getting taxpayer money is putting their people
[02:58:10.920 --> 02:58:16.200]  on the board I mean that's all it's a conflict of interest all of this defeat them you want to
[02:58:16.200 --> 02:58:22.600]  expose the collaborators I like your nomenclature yeah that's it you are the resistance expose the
