[00:13.500 --> 00:20.640]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.640 --> 00:45.120]  Well, another very important radio broadcast the Senate has passed the
[00:45.120 --> 00:54.000]  global government taxing regulation system the enslavement system out of
[00:54.000 --> 01:00.680]  committee and it's been marked up to in the near future go for a full vote in
[01:00.680 --> 01:05.080]  the Senate we're finally getting details of the Senate version just as bad as the
[01:05.080 --> 01:13.200]  House version needs to be very similar so that they can complete its passage
[01:13.200 --> 01:19.920]  and Merkel the German Chancellor just completed 30 minutes ago or so a
[01:19.920 --> 01:30.200]  speech before Congress pushing the global tax and propagandizing everyone
[01:30.200 --> 01:35.520]  how it's this great humanitarian effort meanwhile the New York Times admits
[01:35.520 --> 01:40.840]  today but puts their spin on it like it's a good thing now two years ago when
[01:40.840 --> 01:45.880]  we talked about how Al Gore created the climate change exchange and owns it and
[01:45.880 --> 01:56.280]  how his firm and other firms connected to the current administration are set to
[01:56.280 --> 02:01.120]  make billions of dollars a year off of controlling who's allowed to do business
[02:01.120 --> 02:05.640]  and buying and selling and auctioning carbon credits that's just one part of
[02:05.640 --> 02:11.640]  the scam we would be called conspiracy theorist didn't matter if we had all the
[02:11.640 --> 02:15.360]  documents and it was admitted now it's all over the news but they're putting a
[02:15.360 --> 02:19.680]  spin on it isn't it good wasn't it smart of Al Gore he's gonna make all these
[02:19.680 --> 02:24.000]  billions of dollars buying and selling carbon credits and setting up the taxing
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  system isn't it good isn't it cute isn't it sweet aren't we lucky to have this
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.480]  inventor of the internet this man who honchoed who hatcheted through NAFTA and
[02:35.480 --> 02:41.200]  GATT hadn't that been great for us oh aren't we lucky to have Al Gore Al Gore

[04:21.880 --> 04:29.320]  scared and then he'd go and shake and everyone would get scared and then the
[04:29.320 --> 04:35.400]  snake god or the goblin god or the titan would eat the sun and then everybody
[04:35.400 --> 04:38.680]  would prostrate themselves before him begging them and then he'd wave his

[04:43.960 --> 04:47.400]  years they wouldn't question the priest class and the priest class said the sun

[09:11.800 --> 09:16.280]  world government is openly emerging and that they're launching everyone of
[09:16.280 --> 09:23.720]  their carefully built timed and prepared operations right now on us that's
[09:23.720 --> 09:29.400]  because that's what's happening they're federalizing the states they're
[09:29.400 --> 09:33.960]  federalizing police they're handing control over banking the private
[09:33.960 --> 09:44.920]  offshore consortiums the IMF and World Bank and UN UN's private the Senate is
[09:44.920 --> 09:54.160]  set anytime now to vote on the climate bill they don't care if over 70% of
[09:54.160 --> 09:59.800]  Americans or over 98% of small industry and businesses are against the climate
[09:59.800 --> 10:07.360]  bill the climate tax bill they're going to pass it and they're going to pass the
[10:07.360 --> 10:14.320]  new bank regulation bill that gives the banks that engineered the crisis total
[10:14.320 --> 10:18.080]  control over our lives and all businesses and they're going to pass gun
[10:18.080 --> 10:22.680]  control bills and they're coming after everybody these are hardcore criminals
[10:22.680 --> 10:27.280]  that are going for broke and they're not going to stop until grand juries at the
[10:27.280 --> 10:30.800]  state level start indicting these criminals and until we grow up and
[10:30.800 --> 10:34.760]  realize Republicans and Democrats are bought and paid for by the same interest
[10:34.760 --> 10:41.920]  George Bush a year and a half ago got on board with the new climate treaty as
[10:41.920 --> 10:46.600]  they tell the dumb down public that we're killing the earth and that co2 is a
[10:46.600 --> 10:51.120]  deadly poison and that we've got a tax the carbon cycle on this planet that
[10:51.120 --> 10:58.760]  life itself is bad that life is hurting life it's asinine it's a fraud it's a
[10:58.760 --> 11:03.520]  ridiculous joke and that's why the new order loves it they revel in how
[11:03.520 --> 11:09.280]  ridiculous their cons and hoaxes are and how certain sections of the public
[11:09.280 --> 11:12.880]  buy it now the good news is three or four years ago most of the polls showed
[11:12.880 --> 11:17.520]  over 60% of Americans bought into regulating co2 and believe it's a
[11:17.520 --> 11:24.120]  deadly poison now over 70% in every major poll I see figure out it's a hoax but
[11:24.120 --> 11:34.120]  the Congress doesn't care and the White House doesn't care the banks are the
[11:34.120 --> 11:38.080]  ones that wrote this planned this with the oil companies by the way Dennis
[11:38.080 --> 11:41.920]  Cassinich has told the truth as a raw story article where he gave a speech and
[11:41.920 --> 11:48.120]  pointed out that the insurance companies wrote the health care bill and the
[11:48.120 --> 11:53.560]  headline is Cassinich says health legislation bail out for insurance
[11:53.560 --> 12:02.240]  companies of course it is of course and the climate change bills were written
[12:02.240 --> 12:07.560]  by the stinkin oil companies I mean you can Google Exxon mobile heads says
[12:07.560 --> 12:12.480]  carbon taxes needed a year ago they funded the whole thing I mean even if
[12:12.480 --> 12:14.840]  you won't go check that out for yourself at least when you're reading Time
[12:14.840 --> 12:20.400]  Magazine Newsweek walking through an airport looking at BP and Exxon mobile
[12:20.400 --> 12:26.280]  and Dutch roll shell billboards and ads and newspapers they're the ones
[12:26.280 --> 12:32.040]  propagandizing I have bought magazines off the rack were half the ads lately
[12:32.040 --> 12:39.840]  the last three or four months half the ads were for the cap and trade bill why
[12:39.840 --> 12:45.400]  are the oil companies if they hate it so much buying half the ads and newspapers
[12:45.400 --> 12:54.280]  and magazines half the stinkin full page and half page ads I mean I randomly when
[12:54.280 --> 12:56.920]  I'm in an airport go out and buy a couple magazines and newspapers to read on
[12:56.920 --> 13:02.960]  the plane and literally half of the ads because they know this is the time they
[13:02.960 --> 13:08.480]  get this through there's a direct tax by Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase Bank of
[13:08.480 --> 13:16.040]  England the cumulob company and a handful of others they're even bankrupting
[13:16.040 --> 13:19.000]  Citigroup which was part of the Federal Reserve and consolidating that Bear
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.560]  Stearns they're consolidating that and it's come out in a 10 page detailed
[13:23.560 --> 13:28.720]  report in McClatchy newspapers Sunday detailing everything we already
[13:28.720 --> 13:34.040]  reported in fall of the Republic how they engineered the whole thing JP Morgan
[13:34.040 --> 13:41.840]  Chase and Goldman Sachs every major regulator every Fed chief every deputy
[13:41.840 --> 13:46.800]  Fed chief every Treasury secretary is Goldman Sachs that is the inner crime
[13:46.800 --> 13:54.120]  syndicate and you go look at all these climate change think tanks and bodies and
[13:54.120 --> 14:00.760]  PR firms and lobbying groups every one of them the number one or number two or
[14:00.760 --> 14:07.280]  number three funder is Goldman Sachs when they're not number one or number two
[14:07.280 --> 14:13.320]  guess who they are the Rockefeller Foundation I mean go read the stinking
[14:13.320 --> 14:18.360]  organizations on sites they admit this and you really got a hand into the
[14:18.360 --> 14:22.600]  Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and the Saxe-Cobart gothers I mean these people
[14:22.600 --> 14:26.920]  are slick but they couldn't get away with this if the public wasn't so
[14:26.920 --> 14:31.880]  brainwashed and literally in zombie mode the the average person's brain waves
[14:31.880 --> 14:36.720]  are much lower in a sleep state than they were just 20 years ago the public is
[14:36.720 --> 14:44.640]  sleepwalking they watch three four five hours of TV a day I watched Transformers
[14:46.120 --> 14:51.680]  Revenge of the Fall in the last two days running on the treadmill the entire
[14:51.680 --> 14:57.840]  program is brainwashing and the White House admits the Congress admits that
[14:57.840 --> 15:06.040]  almost all major TV programs and almost all major films the big films you see
[15:06.040 --> 15:13.920]  from front to end are purely written and authorized and paid for by the
[15:13.920 --> 15:18.080]  government with tax money and it's now all public now that isn't a free
[15:18.080 --> 15:22.680]  society and ladies and gentlemen they tortured little baby robots that beg
[15:22.680 --> 15:26.880]  and plead and then and and make it cute everyone laughs when they burn their
[15:26.880 --> 15:32.120]  eyeballs out the military is worship secret police are worship the fact that
[15:32.120 --> 15:34.720]  everyone cell phones track them and that we're all being face scanned and
[15:34.720 --> 15:38.640]  license plate scanned is admitted
[15:40.480 --> 15:47.120]  it's anti-family messages the whole thing and for somebody who's awake I sit
[15:47.120 --> 15:50.800]  here and I watch this and I even went and looked it up and it's admitted that
[15:50.800 --> 15:55.000]  tens of millions were given to the producers by different federal agencies
[15:55.000 --> 16:01.120]  they pay for what's written it is admitted there is not a major film there
[16:01.120 --> 16:05.800]  is not a major production that is not new World Order funded if it's a big hype
[16:05.800 --> 16:11.800]  production or a top TV show you better believe the government is paying for
[16:11.800 --> 16:16.360]  those messages now that isn't a free society so the average person watches
[16:16.360 --> 16:20.480]  something like Transformers Revenge of the Fallen and they are in suspended
[16:20.480 --> 16:23.800]  disbelief they go in there they smoke a big fat joint before they go into the
[16:23.800 --> 16:27.880]  movie or they drink some whiskey in the parking lot and they stumble in there
[16:27.880 --> 16:32.160]  with their kids and they sit down and they just let themselves be bombarded
[16:32.160 --> 16:39.880]  by 21st century mind control just having their psyche ripped apart oh and
[16:39.880 --> 16:47.280]  there's humans torturing humans in the movie it's fun to be tasered it's fun
[16:47.280 --> 16:50.880]  to taser somebody when you disagree with them it's fun to taser someone when
[16:50.880 --> 16:55.720]  they're upset shelling you on seeing fellow humans torn apart murdered
[16:55.720 --> 17:00.480]  killed and and and and and they use archetypal images of the great hero
[17:00.480 --> 17:05.840]  archetypal warrior chief Optimus Prime being killed to save others and so they
[17:05.840 --> 17:12.760]  put good true human messages in there and then wrap it in lies it's pure evil
[17:12.760 --> 17:20.800]  and oh by the way we have a council on foreign relations public blog the CFR
[17:20.800 --> 17:24.160]  until about a decade ago was completely secret about their meetings other than
[17:24.160 --> 17:30.480]  every two months a bimonthly book it's a book softcover gray book called foreign
[17:30.480 --> 17:35.440]  affairs it's got an equestrian on the cover and that's all their deception and
[17:35.440 --> 17:38.720]  spin but they admit global government want to destroy our industry one of I
[17:38.720 --> 17:44.080]  mean there's a lot of evil in there but they spin it and people recorded CFR
[17:44.080 --> 17:47.320]  meetings in Chicago where they go yeah we're torturing people's children it's
[17:47.320 --> 17:50.560]  no big deal we played those clips John you goes yeah it's okay for the president
[17:50.560 --> 17:57.400]  to order a five-year-old to have their testicles crushed and yes we do that
[17:57.400 --> 18:01.720]  someone inside the CFR will professor Castle he's a member he recorded it and
[18:01.720 --> 18:06.040]  released it not all the members of 4,000 members are bad but the inner
[18:06.040 --> 18:11.560]  steering groups are now these guys released a blog a month ago and it
[18:11.560 --> 18:15.000]  confirms everything I already told you I don't need to see their documents I can

[33:15.840 --> 33:23.160]  soundcasted the television but here in the studio they loaded the images from
[33:23.160 --> 33:30.000]  info wars.com from thousands and thousands of headlines a little image we
[33:30.000 --> 33:34.440]  put in the rotator at the top of the site into the computer behind me and it
[33:34.440 --> 33:39.840]  randomly generates through those thousands and thousands of images and
[33:39.840 --> 33:44.240]  every time I'm sitting here during the break I'll look over at the at the
[33:44.240 --> 33:51.240]  computer monitor behind me and see headlines from the past there's one
[33:51.240 --> 34:02.640]  right now where Bayer knowingly put HIV in their factor 8 blood product but the
[34:02.640 --> 34:07.800]  clip before that little image it was up there for five seconds before that was
[34:07.800 --> 34:14.200]  the headline everything must go by the former head of the lbj school of public
[34:14.200 --> 34:18.800]  affairs the University of Texas who's now in the Obama administration and who's
[34:18.800 --> 34:21.920]  a member of the Bilderberg group and it was an editorial he wrote for the
[34:21.920 --> 34:26.920]  austrian-american statesman titled everything must go you guys get a
[34:26.920 --> 34:31.440]  chance print me that it's everything must go info wars.com we scanned it and
[34:31.440 --> 34:36.320]  posted it I covered that about two years ago and it was an impassioned article in
[34:36.320 --> 34:40.200]  the statesman for how we should get rid of the bill of rights and Constitution and
[34:40.200 --> 34:46.440]  how the bill of rights and Constitution is bad. I mean these people are openly
[34:46.440 --> 34:53.360]  treasonous traitors who want tyranny. I get emails every day from fools going
[34:53.360 --> 34:57.760]  I've seen your films and yes there is a world government being set up but that's
[34:57.760 --> 35:02.800]  just the natural progression of human society. What to an unelected group of
[35:02.800 --> 35:07.240]  private robber baron banks who just so happened to have the hobby of eugenics
[35:07.240 --> 35:11.240]  who want to control our lives and who want to get rid of all our freedoms and
[35:11.240 --> 35:14.560]  liberties and our private property rights so they can steal our property
[35:14.560 --> 35:20.600]  that's the natural progression no the progression of mankind through 1776 has
[35:20.600 --> 35:27.040]  been away from tyranny not back into it that's going in reverse but these guys
[35:27.040 --> 35:32.120]  get up there and say oh no it's fancy it's metropolitan it's futuristic to have
[35:32.120 --> 35:35.320]  police tazering everyone with billy clubs and shooting people with rubber
[35:35.320 --> 35:42.880]  bullets and then there's just sit there and listen to public CFR speeches where
[35:42.880 --> 35:47.400]  they're giggling and laughing about how they manipulate the public and we'll say
[35:47.400 --> 35:53.440]  there's a shortage of the vaccine that'll make them want to take it
[35:53.440 --> 36:13.040]  this is the type of disgusting garbage that I have to see from them laughing at
[36:13.040 --> 36:18.640]  us in video and audio clips and in the books they write laughing at us it is so
[36:18.640 --> 36:26.440]  funny to them it is so enjoyable how gullible you are it is so much fun for
[36:26.440 --> 36:30.600]  them that we've let them have the NSA take over the internet and now are
[36:30.600 --> 36:36.080]  openly discussing shutting it down that we openly let them brag that our
[36:36.080 --> 36:43.240]  government grows and controls the heroin and cocaine in Asia and Latin America
[36:43.240 --> 36:48.320]  that they openly put chemicals in our water to brain damages and give us cancer
[36:48.320 --> 36:52.760]  and dumb us down and that it's funny and that people don't show up with pitch
[36:52.760 --> 36:56.960]  forks by the tens of thousands at every city hall demanding the crap be taken
[36:56.960 --> 37:02.280]  out of the stinking water supply when in polls over 95% of Americans wanted out
[37:02.280 --> 37:06.400]  of the water they don't care you don't want to cap and trade tax over
[37:06.400 --> 37:10.560]  everything you do they don't care you don't want Al Gore making millions of
[37:10.560 --> 37:14.640]  dollars off you they don't care you don't like face scanning cameras and
[37:14.640 --> 37:17.720]  checkpoints and having to thumbprint to go in to see your kids in public school

[37:23.400 --> 37:26.960]  like having your second amendment restricted they don't care you don't
[37:26.960 --> 37:31.760]  like police from Dallas Texas to Tucson Arizona to New York City to Boston
[37:31.760 --> 37:35.200]  Massachusetts coming to your door and asking to look at your guns with no
[37:35.200 --> 37:44.040]  warrant they don't care they have trained us that they can sit there and
[37:44.040 --> 37:48.880]  stomp all over us and crap on us and get away with it and that they never get in
[37:48.880 --> 37:54.280]  trouble and what we've gotten is a broke back country that's just ready to be
[37:54.280 --> 38:00.240]  fully gutted begging for it and so much of the public you know the average
[38:00.240 --> 38:02.640]  person who makes a hundred thousand dollars a year thinks they're a member
[38:02.640 --> 38:06.320]  of the elite and you talk to them and they giggle and they laugh at you and
[38:06.320 --> 38:09.600]  they think it's cute and they address you as if they're part of the power
[38:09.600 --> 38:13.560]  structure and they go yeah a lot of it's true but what are you gonna do about it

[40:40.120 --> 40:46.800]  torn on your horns thinking you beat the enemy when you didn't do jack squat but

[42:08.520 --> 42:14.560]  sad timid souls I want to address the warriors the people that understand the
[42:14.560 --> 42:18.240]  cost and understand what we're facing and who could see through the propaganda
[42:18.240 --> 42:23.440]  you don't have to see through it now it's all admitted those that understand
[42:23.440 --> 42:29.560]  Alex Jones isn't special Alex Jones has just read the globalist documents and
[42:29.560 --> 42:33.080]  read a lot more than I care to read let me tell you it's hard to read this stuff
[42:33.080 --> 42:38.960]  it's hard to listen to the CFR laughing at us it's hard to listen to these these
[42:38.960 --> 42:42.240]  con artists who think they're better than us and who've gotten it over on the
[42:42.240 --> 42:48.680]  public and who commit all this evil and they're putting their police state
[42:48.680 --> 42:52.920]  control grid in so they can really abuse you and so you won't be able to get
[42:52.920 --> 42:56.360]  out the door and down the street to physically go after them even if you
[42:56.360 --> 42:59.880]  finally wake up and decide to do that they've almost got their grid in place
[42:59.880 --> 43:03.920]  and then it's gonna be a lot harder to take them on we better take them on in
[43:03.920 --> 43:09.080]  the info war right now there is not one minute there is not ten seconds to wait
[43:09.080 --> 43:13.680]  and sit there on your hands you got to get in the fight now if you don't know
[43:13.680 --> 43:16.040]  about this information you're hearing this for the first time you've done the
[43:16.040 --> 43:20.560]  research you better do a crash course in this you better stay up till 4 a.m. you
[43:20.560 --> 43:23.920]  better get up off your fat asses excuse me folks but that's what we're talking
[43:23.920 --> 43:30.320]  about here you're spiritually fat butts and you better learn about the real
[43:30.320 --> 43:36.720]  world you better do it real fast because we don't have time to screw around and
[43:36.720 --> 43:41.240]  I need every person we've got to wake up but I will tell people that are active
[43:41.240 --> 43:49.640]  this I have one overriding desire one prime directive in my psyche in my
[43:49.640 --> 43:54.960]  spirit in my heart in who I am in my soul and that is to warn as many people as
[43:54.960 --> 43:59.400]  I can about what's really happening with this planetary dictatorship run by
[43:59.400 --> 44:06.200]  the scientific control freaks and I have produced the tool I have produced a
[44:06.200 --> 44:12.800]  weapon system that I want to be seen by everyone and I know with our hundreds of
[44:12.800 --> 44:15.680]  thousands of listeners that we have every 15 minutes we've gotten ratings
[44:15.680 --> 44:19.920]  from our stations just our M&M alone there are hundreds of thousands of you
[44:19.920 --> 44:23.160]  listening to my voice right now hundreds of thousands listening right now in
[44:23.160 --> 44:27.000]  the internet hundreds of thousands and in the aggregate millions more that will
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.680]  hear my message that I'm putting out today if you would simply look in the
[44:32.680 --> 44:39.000]  mirror and decide that you are a leader and decide that it's your job to take
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.040]  action against this tyranny and understand that you're not going to save
[44:42.040 --> 44:45.960]  the world by yourself and neither am I but all of us moving together with a
[44:45.960 --> 44:53.120]  single purpose are an unstoppable force we've got a chance to slow this thing
[44:53.120 --> 44:56.800]  down and hurt it bad this this new order was destined to fall from its
[44:56.800 --> 45:07.880]  foundation but we can slow it down and bring its demise a little bit closer in
[45:07.880 --> 45:12.680]  the time space continuum and I know this the only course is to fight these
[45:12.680 --> 45:16.560]  people and to boldly speak up against them and when they make jokes and giggle
[45:16.560 --> 45:20.480]  lettuce to ignore them and say listen scum don't try your mind games and your
[45:20.480 --> 45:25.480]  mind tricks with me to identify them and to get cold-blooded and hard-hearted
[45:25.480 --> 45:30.960]  against these people but to have that soft spot in our heart for the innocent
[45:30.960 --> 45:34.560]  and the weak and the dumb down that we are defending because those of you that
[45:34.560 --> 45:40.760]  are awake have a responsibility and it is your destiny to stand up against the
[45:40.760 --> 45:46.520]  globalist to do everything you can to fight them and I have produced the tool
[45:46.520 --> 45:52.440]  I have produced the weapon system that is powerful because it's the truth full
[45:52.440 --> 45:57.080]  of the Republic and I know I'm plugging the daylights out of this today because
[45:57.080 --> 46:01.560]  I want these DVDs everywhere I don't want you to commit to make a hundred

[46:40.040 --> 46:43.800]  dollar will be replaced with the new global currency President Barack Obama
[46:43.800 --> 46:47.360]  has brazenly violated article one section out of the U.S. Constitution by

[46:50.560 --> 46:53.840]  becoming the first U.S. president to chair the world body a sign of a

[47:04.760 --> 47:08.480]  unelected corporate elite is implementing a planetary carbon tax system
[47:08.480 --> 47:12.440]  that will dominate all human activity and establish a planetary neo feudal
[47:12.440 --> 47:16.840]  slavery system the image makers have carefully packaged Obama as the world
[47:16.840 --> 47:20.520]  savior he is the Trojan horse manufactured to pacify the people just
[47:20.520 --> 47:24.400]  long enough for the globalists to complete their master plan this film
[47:24.400 --> 47:27.880]  reveals the architecture of the new world order and what the power elite
[47:27.880 --> 47:31.440]  have in store for humanity but more importantly communicates how we the
[47:31.440 --> 47:36.280]  people can retake control of our government turn the criminal tide and
[47:36.280 --> 47:40.840]  bring the tyrants to justice make the choice liberty or tyranny the DVD is

[48:20.240 --> 48:25.680]  happening but in the process people are waking up and aren't going along with it
[48:25.680 --> 48:30.800]  and as good as the German people are and as decadent as the American people are
[48:30.800 --> 48:34.880]  we aren't gonna go along with this the Germans may have gone along with this

[49:00.520 --> 49:05.800]  everything they got at us right now if we can hold this position and move
[49:05.800 --> 49:11.480]  forward against the enemy and sustain our fire on them in the info war we may
[49:11.480 --> 49:15.960]  have smaller arms in the info war but our weapons systems have better guidance
[49:15.960 --> 49:21.880]  systems and are more effective more bang for the buck because the truth can
[49:21.880 --> 49:25.880]  counter a mountain of lies and that's what fall the republic is ladies and

[54:50.200 --> 54:56.600]  completely conquered by offshore banks completely bankrupted by design and the
[54:56.600 --> 55:00.600]  council and foreign relations sits up there publicly laughing at how stupid
[55:00.600 --> 55:04.320]  we are and how they're manipulating us and you bet I'm getting angry you bet I'm
[55:04.320 --> 55:09.280]  upset watching Merkel the German Chancellor I was driving into work this
[55:09.280 --> 55:13.480]  morning as her speech was beginning got in at about 1015 right in the middle of
[55:13.480 --> 55:20.200]  it watch some of it before the Congress telling us we've got to ratify the treaty
[55:20.200 --> 55:23.880]  next month the Copenhagen treaty that we covered yesterday I'm going to cover it
[55:23.880 --> 55:26.960]  more at the bottom of the next hour
[55:27.520 --> 55:33.400]  simultaneously right before her speech the Senate marked it up to go to the full
[55:33.400 --> 55:41.720]  Senate it's coming out a committee an unelected private group of banks a UN
[55:41.720 --> 55:47.520]  unelected body I've read the treaty all 200 pages we covered a lot of it
[55:47.520 --> 55:54.080]  yesterday gonna cover it more today detailing how they're going to decide
[55:54.080 --> 55:57.280]  who gets contracts they're going to decide who can build they're going to
[55:57.280 --> 56:00.560]  decide who can have a company they're going to be able to selectively enforce
[56:00.560 --> 56:05.240]  the taxes it's all stated and America can't get out of the treaty once we're
[56:05.240 --> 56:09.400]  in it unless every other signatory unanimously agrees that's impossible
[56:09.400 --> 56:13.520]  that's not going to happen because we have to pay the lion's share of it as if
[56:13.520 --> 56:17.800]  globalization hasn't deindustrialized us enough and there's all these quotes
[56:17.800 --> 56:21.160]  about Maury strong we've got him and follow the Republic where he spoke
[56:21.160 --> 56:27.040]  before the UN in 92 Rio de Janeiro saying it is our job to destroy the
[56:27.040 --> 56:30.560]  industrial society in the West we're going to carry this out through
[56:30.560 --> 56:35.040]  globalization on March 20th 1969 Dr. Richard Day the National Medical
[56:35.040 --> 56:38.160]  Director of the Rockefeller sponsored Planned Parenthood told the meeting that
[56:38.160 --> 56:43.800]  American industry will be sabotaged and shown to be uncompetitive in view of
[56:43.800 --> 56:47.160]  the recent bankruptcy of General Motors his remarks are especially pertinent
[56:47.160 --> 56:51.840]  the stated plan was that different parts of the world should be assigned
[56:51.840 --> 56:56.080]  different roles of industry and commerce in a unified global system that
[56:56.080 --> 56:59.760]  continued preeminence the United States and the relative independence of the
[56:59.760 --> 57:03.840]  self-sufficiency the United States would have to be changed this is a quote in
[57:03.840 --> 57:07.120]  order to create a new structure you first have to tear down the old one an
[57:07.120 --> 57:12.480]  American industry was one example of that each part of the world will have a
[57:12.480 --> 57:17.280]  specialty and thus become interdependent he said the U.S. will remain a center of
[57:17.280 --> 57:24.080]  market for agriculture high tech communications and education but heavy
[57:24.080 --> 57:28.000]  industry would be transported out and they go on to state that that is to
[57:28.000 --> 57:35.880]  destroy self-sufficiency in a new world order system that's the another quote in
[57:35.880 --> 57:39.240]  a new world order system people say well there is no new order as they're
[57:39.240 --> 57:42.080]  openly announcing it hundreds of publications every day and then they
[57:42.080 --> 57:47.560]  say what is a new order they define it global governance by a group of private
[57:47.560 --> 57:57.920]  international banks that's a David Rockefeller quote that's the type of news
[57:57.920 --> 58:03.560]  and information that we have in front of this this is what's happening we're
[58:03.560 --> 58:08.120]  gonna go live simulcasting the live radio show at prisonplanet.tv for the
[58:08.120 --> 58:13.640]  final three hours today Mike Rivera is gonna be with us in the next hour so go

[58:50.360 --> 58:53.720]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[58:53.720 --> 58:57.680]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[58:57.680 --> 59:01.920]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[59:01.920 --> 59:06.200]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[59:06.200 --> 59:10.560]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[59:10.560 --> 59:14.640]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[59:14.640 --> 59:19.200]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.200 --> 59:23.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.320 --> 59:27.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[59:27.280 --> 59:31.120]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.120 --> 59:33.840]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:33.840 --> 59:39.840]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[59:39.840 --> 59:44.360]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go

[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:19.520]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.520 --> 1:00:30.120]  Alex Jones the fall of our precious Republic is happening right now the so
[1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:36.160]  called bank pre-regulation legislation openly gives unlimited power to less
[1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:40.240]  than four private banks and brokerage firms to regulate all financial
[1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:44.560]  activities in the United States simultaneously the other 19 members of
[1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:50.480]  the G20 are passing identical or close to identical legislation to tie in to
[1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:56.080]  this new private bank of the world part of the taxing mechanism is to be the
[1:00:56.080 --> 1:01:00.120]  framework convention on climate change the house has passed the accompanying
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:05.480]  legislation admittedly to go under you and control it states this is for global
[1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:09.400]  governance the US will not be allowed out of this it will more than double in
[1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:13.480]  their own words US energy prices it will micromanage every fast of your life
[1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:18.040]  taxes on anything that produces carbon your dog owning a dog as it eats meat
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:23.240]  beef will cost more money total control over thousands of facets of your lives
[1:01:23.240 --> 1:01:29.160]  this is hell on earth and is unelected not accountable the next 30 minutes or
[1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:33.680]  so we're joined by Mike Rivera of what really happened calm fellow GCN radio
[1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:39.920]  host and he joins us now from Hawaii via video cam for prison planet dot TV
[1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:45.120]  viewers Mike I want to get into climate bill going out of the committee in the
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:49.120]  Senate today right as Merkel gave her speech to the house calling for the
[1:01:49.120 --> 1:01:54.200]  passage of the treaty next month we're now 34 days out and counting I want to
[1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:58.200]  then get into the open admissions that the CIA is controlling the opium out of
[1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:02.480]  Afghanistan at record levels the open announcement they're killing the dollar
[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:06.360]  my god this is really happening Mike Rivera oh good to have you wear this
[1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:11.000]  aloha thank you for having me on the show again today and you're absolutely
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:16.280]  right at this whole push for globalism it should be scaring everybody I mean you
[1:02:16.280 --> 1:02:20.120]  look at the the news and it's just nothing but total fear mongering and I've
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:23.560]  been saying on my own show that obviously this push for globalism rests on
[1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:28.400]  three foundations the first was human-caused global warming even Al Gore
[1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:31.600]  is backing off from that he's just calling it climate change now and I don't
[1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:35.400]  know if you've heard about his new sequel to inconvenient truth he's not
[1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:39.840]  trying to push in on a scientific basis he's now promoting the fight against
[1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:43.840]  global change as a spiritual quest in other words he couldn't sell it as
[1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:48.080]  science so he's repackaging it as a religion that worships the earth and the
[1:02:48.080 --> 1:02:51.280]  way you worship the earth as you throw your carbon taxes into the little wood
[1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:55.440]  plate as it gets passed well that's phase two you buy your carbon indulgences
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:59.800]  like people would buy indulgences from the Catholic Church 500 years ago and
[1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:04.800]  that's in the UN biological diversity assessment 96 they say they're going to
[1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:08.640]  make it a global religion yeah they're really trying to do it and they're
[1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:11.760]  trying to push the religion angle because they realize the science is
[1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:15.560]  falling apart on them the second foundation as you pointed out they're
[1:03:15.560 --> 1:03:19.960]  trying to create a global federal authority to deal with this manufactured
[1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:24.080]  global financial crisis but here's the problem what they want to put in place
[1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:28.040]  is just a larger version of the Federal Reserve and we already know that the
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:32.720]  failing of the Federal Reserve is the instant that first borrowed manufactured
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:36.680]  piece of money goes into circulation more money is owed to the bank that is
[1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:41.640]  actually in existence if you're on a planet an entire planet that immediately
[1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:46.120]  means the bankers are owed more money than actually exists inevitably there'll
[1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:50.880]  be crash after crash after crash after crash this global financial system
[1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:56.080]  condemns humanity to ongoing perpetual poverty for the masses and incredible
[1:03:56.080 --> 1:04:00.440]  wealth for the elect I mean look at the United States we now have the greatest
[1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:04.680]  disparity between rich and poor of any nation on earth here in the US we are
[1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:08.840]  the greatest debtor nation in history statistically worse than even the Great
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:13.200]  Depression for two years we passed that benchmark two years ago and you're
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:19.000]  absolutely right the banks though they say they fail they've really succeeded
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:24.640]  in vertical integration that's why McClatchy newspapers have done this big
[1:04:24.640 --> 1:04:29.760]  detailed report by Greg Gordon how Goldman secretly bet on the US housing
[1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:35.080]  crash to bring down their competition yeah they did that they also I mean Dave
[1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:38.200]  Goldman Sachs is playing all these little dirty tricks they dumped all the
[1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:42.800]  subprimes on foreign bankers they made money off the California bonds selling
[1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:46.560]  them then turned around and told their own clients bet against them and they
[1:04:46.560 --> 1:04:50.200]  made more money on the credit default swaps on those same bonds it's just a
[1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:53.040]  there I want to talk more about whether you think they're gonna be able to pass
[1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:56.800]  this treaty in the Senate looks like they are how we fight that once they pass
[1:04:56.800 --> 1:05:00.560]  it the government drug dealing all of it with microbarrow I'm Alex you have you
[1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:04.280]  heard that millionaire entrepreneur businessman your congressional candidate

[1:06:05.360 --> 1:06:10.840]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:14.600]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home tremendous
[1:06:14.600 --> 1:06:19.680]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[1:06:19.680 --> 1:06:25.040]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention fall
[1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:29.960]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:34.320]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:38.080]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[1:06:38.080 --> 1:06:42.040]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[1:06:42.040 --> 1:06:47.560]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[1:06:47.560 --> 1:06:53.280]  the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars calm

[1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:07.720]  most advanced silver hydrosol that dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines
[1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:10.600]  and antibiotics avoidable you've heard that are learned Horowitz and others
[1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:15.400]  urged vaccination avoidance instead use vitamin cd and oxy silver along with
[1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:19.960]  zeolife for broad spectrum detoxification using NASA science oxy silver

[1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:43.080]  every nation of the planet that's signing on to it and the house and senate
[1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:50.280]  versions openly give 35 federal agencies complete control dictatorial power
[1:08:50.280 --> 1:08:56.640]  extra judicial outside the courts to take over all facets of society including
[1:08:56.640 --> 1:09:04.240]  attacks on all children california is on the verge of passing legislation last
[1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:08.000]  time I saw it a month ago it may have passed to take away the tax credit on
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:13.800]  children and then to begin taxing having more than one child
[1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:18.200]  australia england canada all the globalist nations are going along with
[1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:22.200]  this europe's going along with it and now merkel the german chancellor just
[1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:27.200]  completed an hour ago a speech before the house calling for the passage the
[1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:31.840]  senate has marked it up to go to the full senate debate has now begun on this
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:39.720]  microbaro breaking this down from your research what's in the bill what it does
[1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:43.640]  the new york times is admitting what we talked about years ago that gore is
[1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:47.680]  making billions of dollars off of this that the un and others are only going
[1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:52.400]  to give the carbon contracts to him and his company blood and gore literally the
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:57.080]  partners named blood in england no joke there it's admitted that obama owns part
[1:09:57.080 --> 1:10:01.680]  of the mercantile that's going to be trading this in chicago this is where the
[1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:04.800]  bankers who've been waging war against the real economy criminally
[1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:08.600]  consolidating it now we'll have government power to shut down all their
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:14.160]  competition i mean this is the worst possible nightmare yeah we've been seeing
[1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:18.200]  it for a long time where the the federal reserve and its affiliated banks use
[1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:21.680]  the courts and use the government to go after any possible competing banking
[1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:25.080]  systems we saw what happened a bram lincoln in his greenbacks we saw what
[1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:28.920]  happened to jfk and his executive order one one one one zero this is
[1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:34.040]  absolutely the financial enslavement of the human race if we continue to believe
[1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:39.040]  in their system of money one of the things that really alarms me greatly
[1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:45.040]  about this global empire it's got to have a single financial banking system
[1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:48.520]  and of course we all know that the western style bankers are absolutely
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:49.480]  loathing
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:53.120]  uh... the muslims because they have a completely different system of banking
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:58.040]  which doesn't suffer from the crashes and uh... the the disparity of income
[1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:01.880]  uh... that we see here in the western world and so at some point along this
[1:11:01.880 --> 1:11:04.920]  path to a global government and a global banking system
[1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:08.520]  there's going to be war between the western style compound interest banking
[1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:11.760]  and the islamic system of banking and this is what they really mean when they
[1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:13.800]  talk about a clash of civilizations
[1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:18.360]  somewhere between now and the success of a global government is a war between
[1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:21.080]  christians and muslims that they're trying they've been trying to
[1:11:21.080 --> 1:11:22.720]  generate now for years
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:27.160]  all bad islam bad muslims we've got to go kill them you keep hearing that phrase
[1:11:27.160 --> 1:11:31.880]  clash of civilizations it's a clash of banking systems is what this is all
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:34.760]  about
[1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:38.360]  mike looking at this they're now saying
[1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:41.960]  and and and feinstein and boxer that are on showing this in the senate's past
[1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:43.400]  the house
[1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:47.120]  they don't normally say something's going to pass unless it is
[1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:49.360]  they say health care is going to pass
[1:11:49.360 --> 1:11:52.520]  they say the carbon tax is going to pass
[1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:55.160]  all of these are taxes to the banks
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:11:56.760]  uh... looks like
[1:11:56.760 --> 1:11:58.680]  we can try to call congress
[1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:01.000]  get the buzz going warn people
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.360]  eighty you think it's going to pass and be
[1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:06.120]  as they incrementally try to enforce it
[1:12:06.120 --> 1:12:10.200]  uh... what should our resistance to this be state sovereignty state saying
[1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:11.560]  they're not going along with it
[1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:13.080]  what should we do
[1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:16.760]  well definitely we have to resist it by any means possible i mean going back
[1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:19.520]  for an entire year we've seen that congress absolutely
[1:12:19.520 --> 1:12:23.200]  is not concerned with the will of the people they pass the tarp in the bailout
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:25.320]  despite ninety percent phone calls
[1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:28.160]  to the congress saying no do not give our money to congress
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:31.760]  now obama's talking about a second stimulus even as the first one fails to
[1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:33.000]  accomplish anything
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:34.720]  it is very clearly
[1:12:34.720 --> 1:12:37.880]  the the the government has been co-opted the government of the united states
[1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:40.040]  is co-opted into this globalist agenda
[1:12:40.040 --> 1:12:43.400]  they're taking all the wealth away from the common people to concentrate at the
[1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:45.400]  top from which they will use it
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:49.960]  to dictate how the world is going to run now we already know the world is
[1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:51.200]  overpopulated
[1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:53.400]  so if we get a global government
[1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:55.800]  with a hitler type mentality at the top
[1:12:55.800 --> 1:12:59.280]  what is going to happen to those proportions of the world's population
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:03.240]  that are deemed non essential or non productive what is going to happen to
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:05.120]  them and before you answer that question
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:08.440]  go back and look at national security study memorandum two hundred
[1:13:08.440 --> 1:13:12.400]  that was up uh... official u.s policy during the nixon administration
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:16.600]  which called for overt and covert methods of birth control
[1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:19.600]  to reduce the world's population
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:23.960]  let me expand on that yesterday i showed the headlines in canada
[1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:25.320]  australia
[1:13:25.320 --> 1:13:29.840]  and england with their environment ministers on the same day
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:31.400]  three months ago saying
[1:13:31.400 --> 1:13:33.840]  we must cut our population by half
[1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:36.600]  we must raise taxes on people that have children
[1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:38.200]  that is in the
[1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:40.320]  copenhagen treaty
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:44.560]  to make them not have children that's how it began in seventy five in china
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:46.640]  then eighty one it became law
[1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:48.620]  and the headline was
[1:13:48.620 --> 1:13:50.400]  in the london guardian
[1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:54.560]  england must cut population to thirty million that's by half their sixty
[1:13:54.560 --> 1:13:55.960]  million
[1:13:55.960 --> 1:14:00.280]  the diabolicalness of this the diabolical nature
[1:14:00.280 --> 1:14:03.720]  is what i think a lot of people have trouble coming to grips with
[1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:06.960]  and a lot of yuppies think we'll go to get rid of those third world people
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:10.360]  they don't understand that the globalist number one
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:13.080]  group they're targeting is actually westerners
[1:14:13.080 --> 1:14:14.520]  regardless of color
[1:14:14.520 --> 1:14:17.320]  and we've gotten the internal audio tapes of uh...
[1:14:17.320 --> 1:14:19.680]  planned parenthood where they're talking about their mission
[1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:21.600]  being getting rid of the black people
[1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:23.480]  and we have the
[1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:24.840]  documents
[1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:26.960]  uh... that came out with margaret sanger
[1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:30.800]  calling black subhuman that had to be killed but these are modern audio tapes
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:33.080]  that were all over the news this year and last year
[1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:36.000]  so the issue is they're going after everybody
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:38.840]  and they're telling the third world the cap and trade will hurt the greedy
[1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:42.000]  americans and british and germans and french
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:45.080]  selling it to them as a divide and conquer strategy
[1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:47.480]  when really this is an attack against everyone
[1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:50.600]  as the british commission on population stated
[1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:53.560]  well what you need to understand is from the point of view of the bankers in
[1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:54.720]  the globalists
[1:14:54.720 --> 1:14:57.720]  the people they want to die and leave the planet
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:00.760]  are those who work the least while consuming the most
[1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:04.320]  the ones who will be kept alive are those willing to work the hardest and
[1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:06.920]  expect and demand the least amount return
[1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:10.480]  the ultimate agenda for any government history is to extract the most work
[1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:12.000]  product from their population
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.280]  for the least amount of support going back
[1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:17.480]  so if you're willing to work eighty hours a week for a loincloth and a bowl
[1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:20.120]  of rice you are much more valuable to the bankers
[1:15:20.120 --> 1:15:21.320]  than somebody who works
[1:15:21.320 --> 1:15:26.920]  you know flex time twenty five thirty hours a week and wants to drive a bmw
[1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:31.160]  you're absolutely right and let me read a quote from the u n dias
[1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:34.080]  moray strong nineteen ninety two re-audition arrow
[1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:36.320]  head of the earth summit
[1:15:36.320 --> 1:15:39.880]  isn't the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations
[1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:40.920]  collapse
[1:15:40.920 --> 1:15:43.560]  isn't it our responsibility to bring that about
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:45.160]  then another quote
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:48.560]  by key agent of the rockefeller family doctor richard day
[1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:52.080]  the national metal director of the rockefeller sponsored plan parenthood
[1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:56.520]  hold a meeting in march of sixty nine an american industry will be sabotaged
[1:15:56.520 --> 1:15:58.440]  and shown to be on
[1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:02.160]  competitive he said the stated plan was that different parts of the world would
[1:16:02.160 --> 1:16:05.560]  be assigned different roles of industry in commerce
[1:16:05.560 --> 1:16:07.220]  unified global system
[1:16:07.220 --> 1:16:09.520]  the continued preeminence of the united states
[1:16:09.520 --> 1:16:12.600]  and related independence and self-sufficiency the united states
[1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:15.280]  would have to be changed in order to create a new structure
[1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:17.440]  you first have to tear down the old
[1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:22.000]  an american industry was one example of that each part of the world will have
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:25.480]  speciality and thus become interdependent he said the u s will
[1:16:25.480 --> 1:16:27.440]  remain the center for agriculture
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:30.640]  high-tech communications and education but but heavy industry would be
[1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:32.860]  transported out now
[1:16:32.860 --> 1:16:35.600]  this is all stated thousands of different places in hundreds of different
[1:16:35.600 --> 1:16:37.000]  ways
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  but the issue here
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.400]  is that
[1:16:42.400 --> 1:16:46.520]  they're doing all this to make us dependent on government they are
[1:16:46.520 --> 1:16:49.960]  stating this this is such a criminal
[1:16:49.960 --> 1:16:52.680]  hijacking this is neo feudalism
[1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:55.720]  this is serfdom these people are mortal enemies
[1:16:55.720 --> 1:16:56.760]  of anyone
[1:16:56.760 --> 1:16:59.120]  that wants freedom and liberty and remember how they throw this in our
[1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:01.480]  face through movies which they now admit their funding
[1:17:01.480 --> 1:17:02.760]  rollerball
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:05.520]  what nineteen seventy four
[1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:08.640]  you have the different energy cities
[1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:13.440]  because once the globalists have a world government or even a break into subregions
[1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:15.840]  and
[1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:19.420]  that's their plan and it is so unbelievably wicked
[1:17:19.420 --> 1:17:20.800]  microvarum
[1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:24.760]  yeah absolutely it's it's basically again and every time i hear the phrase
[1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:27.080]  global government the first thing i think of is
[1:17:27.080 --> 1:17:30.760]  that's what alexander the great wanted that's what napoleon wanted that's what
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:34.280]  the roman seizures wanted that's what hitler wanted and in the middle of all
[1:17:34.280 --> 1:17:38.040]  this empire building the ordinary people who just wanted to be left alone to live
[1:17:38.040 --> 1:17:40.960]  their lives and raise their children were crushed
[1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:44.480]  there has never been a push for global government that did not involve the
[1:17:44.480 --> 1:17:48.800]  complete enslavement of the common people as you say this is neo feudalism
[1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:53.040]  they're trying to end the american republic uh... democracy experiment and
[1:17:53.040 --> 1:17:57.080]  take us back to enforced serfdom we will be attached to the land will be
[1:17:57.080 --> 1:18:00.280]  considered part of the wealth of the land and there will be titles of no
[1:18:00.280 --> 1:18:04.480]  ability to those who control large tracts of land it's going back to the
[1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:08.600]  twelfth century politically and we're already seeing this in our own government
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:09.640]  that is abandoned
[1:18:09.640 --> 1:18:13.080]  uh... the the the presumption of innocence you have to prove that you're
[1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:16.520]  innocent now or you wind up being tortured until you confess something
[1:18:16.520 --> 1:18:19.480]  i mean even the magnet carter said you're not allowed to do that and our
[1:18:19.480 --> 1:18:23.760]  government has gone back before that in the way that they're handling uh... the
[1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:26.280]  prisoners from these wars
[1:18:26.280 --> 1:18:30.640]  mike you're absolutely right in my film fall the republic details
[1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:32.480]  how the establishment
[1:18:32.480 --> 1:18:35.320]  is carrying this operation out
[1:18:35.320 --> 1:18:39.880]  i don't see this working for the establishment though sure they can claim
[1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:43.760]  they control all issuance of currency and credit they can try to restrict
[1:18:43.760 --> 1:18:44.880]  peoples
[1:18:44.880 --> 1:18:47.040]  resources to control them
[1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:51.200]  they can try to force one child policies but as the public learns about the
[1:18:51.200 --> 1:18:55.040]  shadow government as they learn about the private fellow reserve as they learn
[1:18:55.040 --> 1:18:56.400]  about the real paradigm
[1:18:56.400 --> 1:19:00.400]  which the suppression will encourage them to do and is happening now
[1:19:00.400 --> 1:19:03.840]  resistance is going to mount that's why they preemptively in their own
[1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:06.160]  documents admitted this is neosurfdom
[1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:07.120]  feudalism
[1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:08.520]  and that they're bringing in
[1:19:08.520 --> 1:19:10.000]  this electronic
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  police state straight jacket
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:14.240]  but i don't see that succeeding as well
[1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:16.400]  this is going to be explosive
[1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:20.080]  yeah i agree i don't think they're getting uh... that this is moving along
[1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:22.200]  anywhere near as smoothly as they wanted
[1:19:22.200 --> 1:19:25.680]  first of all for the foundation that was resting on global warming the fact that
[1:19:25.680 --> 1:19:26.920]  the earth is cooling
[1:19:26.920 --> 1:19:29.880]  has damaged the credibility of the globalist movement as a whole
[1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:33.240]  the same thing with attempting to sell a global health authority
[1:19:33.240 --> 1:19:37.160]  on the basis of the swine flu that's not coming out as predicted
[1:19:37.160 --> 1:19:39.080]  and selling more globalism
[1:19:39.080 --> 1:19:42.040]  to fix the economy that was already destroyed by globalism that's a tough
[1:19:42.040 --> 1:19:42.600]  sell
[1:19:42.600 --> 1:19:45.320]  i don't think they can make it i think they may actually just
[1:19:45.320 --> 1:19:47.120]  bring down all of civilization
[1:19:47.120 --> 1:19:49.720]  in a ruin trying to bring about this new world order
[1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:53.240]  you're right and they have corrupt bureaucrats running the system
[1:19:53.240 --> 1:19:55.480]  and so
[1:19:55.480 --> 1:19:56.800]  they're having a lot of problems
[1:19:56.800 --> 1:20:01.000]  stay there michael talk about government drug dealing
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:04.800]  what would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality
[1:20:04.800 --> 1:20:07.760]  feeling better than you have in years and you noticed a difference in your
[1:20:07.760 --> 1:20:08.760]  sleeping patterns
[1:20:08.760 --> 1:20:11.920]  blood sugar levels and had a sense of well-being overall
[1:20:11.920 --> 1:20:15.080]  there's something that is changing thousands of people's lives and you
[1:20:15.080 --> 1:20:18.160]  could be one of them it's called heart and body extract
[1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:21.080]  Sharon Harris co-creator of heart and body extract
[1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:23.880]  talks about the positive effects of heart and body extract
[1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:27.640]  what happens with the formula heart and body extract is it's giving the body
[1:20:27.640 --> 1:20:32.120]  the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes and phytonutrients
[1:20:32.120 --> 1:20:33.840]  so the body will heal itself
[1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:37.240]  and yes the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure
[1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:40.360]  balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries
[1:20:40.360 --> 1:20:44.400]  it can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics so the body
[1:20:44.400 --> 1:20:45.760]  is an amazing thing
[1:20:45.760 --> 1:20:48.960]  it simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself

[1:21:09.160 --> 1:21:11.320]  as we're finishing off this agenda
[1:21:11.320 --> 1:21:14.400]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:18.440]  I have a tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[1:21:18.440 --> 1:21:20.320]  and they really are calling the shots
[1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:25.560]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[1:21:25.560 --> 1:21:28.840]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[1:21:28.840 --> 1:21:33.240]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[1:21:33.240 --> 1:21:35.680]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:38.040]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:40.880]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying
[1:21:40.880 --> 1:21:42.040]  who do we make the checkout to?
[1:21:42.040 --> 1:21:44.160]  today seems like nobody does care
[1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:49.320]  and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic

[1:22:02.280 --> 1:22:04.480]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources
[1:22:04.480 --> 1:22:07.760]  one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms
[1:22:07.760 --> 1:22:10.160]  I get it, you wouldn't buy gold if you believed
[1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:12.200]  that the government is doing a great job
[1:22:12.200 --> 1:22:15.800]  that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy
[1:22:15.800 --> 1:22:17.960]  that social security would be there for you
[1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:19.400]  that's not what's happening
[1:22:19.400 --> 1:22:23.960]  you might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation
[1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:25.800]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value
[1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:27.800]  or that your retirement would be secure
[1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:31.280]  if all looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy gold
[1:22:31.280 --> 1:22:35.480]  for the realists there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold
[1:22:35.480 --> 1:22:41.480]  since 2001 the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%
[1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:44.880]  right now savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios

[1:23:00.720 --> 1:23:03.720]  if you believe Obama is creating runaway inflation

[1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:08.280]  first the facts
[1:23:08.280 --> 1:23:10.680]  Obama is spending like a drunken sailor
[1:23:10.680 --> 1:23:12.440]  700 billion for tarp
[1:23:12.440 --> 1:23:14.920]  122 billion for AIG
[1:23:14.920 --> 1:23:16.600]  more for Fannie and Freddie
[1:23:16.600 --> 1:23:17.400]  the result
[1:23:17.400 --> 1:23:22.000]  a deficit of over 1.8 trillion dollars and the probability of interest rates
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:23.600]  going above 18%
[1:23:23.600 --> 1:23:25.720]  and inflation above 20%
[1:23:25.720 --> 1:23:27.200]  now the good news
[1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:31.160]  Scott Smith the former chief investment analyst at Credit Suisse an editor of

[1:23:36.560 --> 1:23:40.160]  the kit outlines how these circumstances created opportunities

[1:24:04.760 --> 1:24:07.360]  we've got an abbreviated
[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:09.960]  show today with Mike
[1:24:09.960 --> 1:24:12.200]  but he'll be back up with us in the near future
[1:24:12.200 --> 1:24:16.200]  Mike in closing in this short segment
[1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:19.480]  I want to get into government drug dealing in Afghanistan and Colombia
[1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:24.400]  but first Al Gore again admittedly to make the profits from all of this
[1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:27.880]  this is racketeering I mean he should get in trouble for this we need to
[1:24:27.880 --> 1:24:30.880]  really start calling them out as the criminals they are
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:35.000]  we absolutely need to do that what most people don't understand is when Al Gore
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:36.920]  set up this cap and credit
[1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:42.600]  CO2 tax scheme it was he got help from Ken Le from Enron
[1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:46.240]  in other words Al Gore is doing to us with carbon dioxide
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:50.080]  what Enron did to California with electricity they're not actually doing
[1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:51.520]  anything that's in useful
[1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:55.440]  they're simply setting up a system that siphons money off and makes them very
[1:24:55.440 --> 1:24:57.440]  very very rich yes it's a crime
[1:24:57.440 --> 1:25:01.200]  it's a scam and as long as we the people just sit there and go along with it
[1:25:01.200 --> 1:25:04.440]  you know there has to be a breaking point at some time I mean I've got friends
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:05.640]  who are calling me
[1:25:05.640 --> 1:25:09.080]  asking to borrow money to make their rent I'm having to tell them no we're just
[1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:11.000]  barely making our rent here
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.760]  at some point when enough people have been made homeless and a lot of
[1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:15.360]  businesses have been shut down
[1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:17.580]  that the american people have got to get angry
[1:25:17.580 --> 1:25:21.560]  there really is no other you know uh... that's what that's what north com that's
[1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:23.560]  what north comes for me now know
[1:25:23.560 --> 1:25:25.800]  this was all premeditated and planned
[1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:28.600]  Goldman Sachs engineering it with the federal reserve to collapse the
[1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:29.600]  economy
[1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:33.120]  that's some a clutchy newspapers got the reporter coming on later
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:35.320]  but uh... in closing here
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:37.680]  what about the the treaty
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:40.480]  to build giant bases in columbia to attack
[1:25:40.480 --> 1:25:41.720]  venezuela
[1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:45.080]  the u.s. forces only spray the coca plantations
[1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:48.400]  that the fart control our government's growing the cocaine
[1:25:48.400 --> 1:25:53.400]  afghanistan it's up ten twelve thirteen fold what it was a decade ago opium
[1:25:53.400 --> 1:25:57.760]  they admit in the news that the cia runs the drugs with the head drug dealer
[1:25:57.760 --> 1:26:01.400]  meanwhile the police are still swat teaming people for using the drugs
[1:26:01.400 --> 1:26:03.760]  the government ships in what about i mean it's just
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:05.800]  all of this stuff's coming to the surface
[1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:08.400]  but no one gets in trouble
[1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:11.680]  well it's absolutely true i mean basically the war on drugs is simply a
[1:26:11.680 --> 1:26:13.760]  war on the competition's drugs
[1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:15.720]  and they want to make sure it's a monopoly
[1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:20.400]  that is controlled by the american drug lord families including the bushes and
[1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:21.360]  the clinton's
[1:26:21.360 --> 1:26:24.720]  and that's what it's really all about when the caliban was in control of
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:29.600]  afghanistan there was no opium growing the u.s. comes in its bumper crops we've
[1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:33.600]  got cheap potent heroin flooding into the united states it's vietnam all over
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:38.000]  again young people are dying from overdoses and our government is making
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:41.600]  the money from it that's why all these anti-drug commercials you see on tv
[1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:45.840]  are lame they don't work they're designed to make it look like the government
[1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:50.080]  cares but they're designed to utterly fail to convince anybody to say look at
[1:26:50.080 --> 1:26:54.800]  all the pro drug messages in hollywood movies where it's so fun
[1:26:54.800 --> 1:26:57.760]  we know that's government propaganda placement
[1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:02.720]  and it's on record every cop i talk to whether i'm in l.a. or new york or austin
[1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:05.040]  i talk to cops when i see them at restaurants and i go
[1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:08.480]  don't you guys know most of the money is laundered from drugs is laundered in
[1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:13.280]  u.s. banks and then we only go after the competition they go yeah we know that
[1:27:13.280 --> 1:27:16.880]  but then they get promoted when they bust some teenager with it
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:21.440]  by making the drugs illegal it jacks up the prices brings more drugs in
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:25.440]  bad quality drugs we know under prohibition alcoholism tripled that's
[1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:29.040]  admitted mainline history we know it energized the mob
[1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:35.040]  that the criminals made drugs illegal because they wanted to jack up the price
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:38.080]  that's exactly right they call it the politics of contraband
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:41.760]  and i mean uh... the prohibition the amount of money that came in from
[1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:45.760]  prohibition to the criminals completely reshaped american politics
[1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:50.160]  the whole kennedy dynasty is founded on illegal alcohol money
[1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:54.320]  the skull and bones fraternity at Yale university was funded with opium money
[1:27:54.320 --> 1:27:57.280]  it's all about drugs and control of the drugs
[1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:00.960]  hollywood always says the drug lords are down in south america no the drug lords
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:03.840]  are right here in the united states of america
[1:28:03.840 --> 1:28:08.240]  sitting in taxpayer funded offices and they have the u.s. military if you don't
[1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:10.880]  pay your cut or launder your money with them
[1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:14.400]  and i've talked to high-level military d a people that track the flights they're
[1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:17.760]  told leave those ten flights alone go after those two
[1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:21.120]  every time they bust the cia with drugs in the u.s. they're told let them go
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:24.880]  i've had terry reid and other high-level cia people on the show
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:28.320]  about mena seeing bill clinton all over north
[1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:33.120]  with the cocaine and then they call them big patriot heroes
[1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:37.040]  yeah it is it is really absurd i mean all the excesses that we were told were
[1:28:37.040 --> 1:28:40.240]  happening down in south america they happen times ten
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:44.080]  here in the united states it is that completely out of control
[1:28:44.080 --> 1:28:47.440]  and now the drug use they want to buy themselves an entire planet
[1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:51.360]  because the drug lords and the drug money and the banks are all tied in
[1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:55.840]  together if the drug money went away most american banks would collapse
[1:28:55.840 --> 1:29:01.200]  and let's explain this they can leverage on average eight to ten times
[1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:04.800]  so five hundred billion in opium a year out of afghanistan that's five trillion
[1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:07.920]  leverage go ahead yeah that's absolutely correct
[1:29:07.920 --> 1:29:11.600]  uh... be when uh... michael man was producing the original miami vice tv
[1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:14.480]  series in the third season he started taking some chances
[1:29:14.480 --> 1:29:19.040]  and he did an episode in which the good guys are called off a drug bust because
[1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:22.400]  if they busted this particular drug dealer it would have destroyed a couple
[1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:25.920]  of the big banks in florida and they were told you got to stay away from this
[1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:28.880]  one we're sorry it's just that big and that powerful
[1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:32.800]  the money is too powerful to fight and it's all about the money
[1:29:32.800 --> 1:29:37.040]  and it's all counterfeit money we have been taught to worship the dollar as a
[1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:41.280]  new religion and there's nothing behind it it's just a funny printed piece of
[1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:44.240]  paper now they're trying to come up with another one the carbon credit
[1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:47.680]  that too is just a funny and we've been taught to worship al gore

[1:32:59.920 --> 1:33:08.800]  all right i want to go over a whole bunch of news
[1:33:08.800 --> 1:33:15.600]  i want to play a audio clip from the council on foreign relations
[1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:19.440]  we've got clips of al gore being confronted because the new york times
[1:33:19.440 --> 1:33:23.360]  finally reported he's making all this money
[1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:27.280]  off of the climate scam but the new york times says it's like it's good
[1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:30.960]  isn't it good he's making millions and then they only tell you about the smaller
[1:33:30.960 --> 1:33:37.120]  scams he's carrying out so we'll be breaking that down
[1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:42.560]  before i do that i just want to tell you we're going to have open phones in the
[1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:45.760]  next hour on any issue you wish you discussed they're not open yet
[1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:52.400]  we're going to have phone blitz next hour with some other important news
[1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:57.200]  and then we've got gary franchi and uh william louis here in studio
[1:33:57.200 --> 1:34:02.560]  today they're here to film part two of their camp fema with me so why not have
[1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:07.200]  them in studio that should be interesting always informative
[1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:10.960]  but i wanted to stop here for a moment and explain to people
[1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:15.120]  there's no more denial there's no more playing games there's no more time to
[1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:18.240]  rationalize not only is world government
[1:34:18.240 --> 1:34:22.960]  been admitted by the big central bankers by van kye moon the head of the un
[1:34:22.960 --> 1:34:26.960]  by al gore by barack obama by prince philip ted turner
[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:32.800]  bill gates but the specifics of the world government have been admitted
[1:34:32.800 --> 1:34:37.200]  in hundreds of textbooks white papers and documents but not just in textbooks
[1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:40.240]  now like eco science that i talk about so much
[1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:45.360]  written by the white house science are john p holdren but in editorials in the
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:48.800]  new york times called we can do it van kye moon
[1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:52.720]  global governance we have the treaty i went over yesterday i'm going to cover
[1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:59.040]  it some more today they're now debating the passage in the senate
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:01.920]  that's why the democrats haven't been pushing it the last month they admitted
[1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:04.960]  they were going to wait and race in november to pass it and now they're
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:08.800]  going to push it merkel the german chancellor was here today
[1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:13.120]  that's all coming up ladies and gentlemen people aren't sophisticated
[1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:16.160]  they don't understand they don't know what's happening to them
[1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:19.200]  they know they're getting screwed they know they're getting hammered
[1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:22.640]  they know they're getting nailed to the wall they know we're in deep trouble
[1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:26.560]  they know the economy's getting worse that a jobless recovery is a
[1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:31.600]  orwellian doublespeak oxymoron
[1:35:32.560 --> 1:35:37.360]  if 20 million americans could see fall the republic
[1:35:37.360 --> 1:35:41.200]  and then if they took action and called their congressman and went to city hall
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:45.120]  and called the corporations that are behind all of this up on the phone and
[1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:50.080]  boycotted people and got active we could turn this around
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:53.760]  my films conservatively
[1:35:54.240 --> 1:35:57.760]  and that's like mike revero earlier said 90 percent of the phone calls to
[1:35:57.760 --> 1:36:00.800]  congress no barbara boxer who was pro banker bailout
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:04.640]  said it was thousand to one phone calls
[1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:10.560]  gallup poll showed 99 percent of people were against the banker bailout take
[1:36:10.560 --> 1:36:15.200]  over of last october so see mike
[1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:20.480]  said 90 percent i tend to do the same thing too
[1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:25.360]  i tend to lessen
[1:36:26.080 --> 1:36:34.160]  how bad things really are but the issue is 99 of people
[1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:37.120]  when they're presented with carbon taxes and global government
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:44.560]  don't want it but we need to show them the specifics
[1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:47.600]  because we're settling in for a long battle it's going to be you know they
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:51.680]  can pass legislation to let private banks and
[1:36:51.680 --> 1:36:55.840]  corporations regulate in taxes england's already done it
[1:36:55.840 --> 1:36:59.360]  was in the times of london last week where private groups come and take your
[1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:03.120]  house in your car and your home and for fines and fees
[1:37:03.120 --> 1:37:08.160]  no judge no jury we can stop these people
[1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:12.000]  if you will take action and
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:20.000]  and i have the film
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:24.880]  that can do this this is the film with their own statements
[1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:27.440]  their own admissions of how they want world government how they're going to
[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:31.520]  control your life how they plan on doing it all the horrible things they want to
[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:34.800]  carry out these are very wicked control freaks with an instinct
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:40.880]  towards domination and control and so my films have been seen by more than 100
[1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:44.800]  million people and and that's a conservative number
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:48.960]  just like mike's 90 when it was 99 in the news we're against the
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:54.800]  banker bailout over 100 million times so we're making a major
[1:37:54.800 --> 1:37:58.800]  contribution here towards awakening people
[1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:04.000]  but it's not enough we need all of you that are awake
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:08.320]  to do more and to get involved and i've never made a film this powerful
[1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:11.200]  over 20 million views on youtube and google alone
[1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:17.040]  for the obama deception over 100 million views we know up for my
[1:38:17.040 --> 1:38:22.080]  films free online it is incalculable what people
[1:38:22.080 --> 1:38:26.160]  have done with the dvds making copies
[1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:30.800]  make history hurt these people fight back
[1:38:30.800 --> 1:38:35.040]  know that it's going to be a delayed reaction but when you burn copies of
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:39.280]  the obama deception and in game and fall the republic the fall the
[1:38:39.280 --> 1:38:43.200]  republic is what's happening now this was made for the fight we're now
[1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:46.560]  facing it shows everything and people see it
[1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:49.840]  now and then see what i'm talking about on the news but this gives them all the

[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:15.840]  installing the germans were trained to submit to
[1:40:15.840 --> 1:40:18.640]  government americans haven't been like that though we have been
[1:40:18.640 --> 1:40:22.640]  buffaloed and broke back and trained to capitulate

[1:41:05.360 --> 1:41:10.880]  and corporations and the pentagon and foreign governments order
[1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:17.280]  follow the republic in game and the obama deception

[1:43:57.520 --> 1:44:00.800]  find decision makers
[1:44:02.240 --> 1:44:06.240]  the second most important film in game you want to know their master plan who
[1:44:06.240 --> 1:44:08.560]  they are i lay out the carbon tax the global
[1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:11.680]  government how they're going to implode the economy by design to bring in the
[1:44:11.680 --> 1:44:16.480]  global government three years ago in in game
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:22.880]  blueprint for global enslavement what's to say on the back they want you dead
[1:44:22.880 --> 1:44:27.120]  that's what their own documents say just like goldfinger do you expect me to
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:31.600]  talk no mr bond i expect you to die
[1:44:34.960 --> 1:44:38.080]  you know i could just play these clips i didn't have time last night to go
[1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:41.760]  find the actual cfr blog
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:49.200]  i did go to the site and find the blog but then he had to register the
[1:44:49.200 --> 1:44:56.240]  the point is here is the audio from the council on foreign relations
[1:44:56.240 --> 1:45:00.240]  where they talk about artificial scarcity how they're going to create
[1:45:00.240 --> 1:45:03.040]  artificial
[1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:08.560]  scarcity and and and how they want to say that there aren't enough vaccines
[1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:16.160]  so everybody lines up to create a stampede a perceived demand for it this
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:19.680]  was a month ago this aired the person to put this video together
[1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:23.360]  put some clips of the news fair mongering in between it and put some text
[1:45:23.360 --> 1:45:27.680]  i'll be reading on air for radio listeners tv listeners can watch it
[1:45:27.680 --> 1:45:34.240]  the story is up on info wars dot com cfr vaccines no more harmful than tuna
[1:45:34.240 --> 1:45:38.240]  sandwich they're admitting there's mercury in it
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:42.720]  but the other issue here is yes mercury in a tuna sandwich though is bound
[1:45:42.720 --> 1:45:49.120]  to the protein and 99 plus percent of it goes through your body
[1:45:49.120 --> 1:45:53.520]  it's not injected into your blood bound with the virus so there's an auto
[1:45:53.520 --> 1:45:56.640]  immune response that the mercury accelerates as an
[1:45:56.640 --> 1:46:00.400]  adjuvant and we've had medical doctors on to explain it but listen to how they
[1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:04.720]  arrogantly laugh at you listen to how they joke listen to how one of the
[1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:07.920]  medical directors and these are high level government and university heads
[1:46:07.920 --> 1:46:11.840]  in the cfr laughs and says we should make it
[1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:15.280]  well there's not enough of it so they stampede to get it now you see them
[1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:22.080]  doing that and we told you they were doing that months ago
[1:46:22.080 --> 1:46:27.360]  this is how they manipulate you let's go ahead and go to the video
[1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:32.080]  anatomy of the 2009 swine flu pandemic thank you for downloading this
[1:46:32.080 --> 1:46:37.280]  council on foreign relations podcast cfr is an independent national membership
[1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:40.640]  organization and nonpartisan research center
[1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:45.280]  good morning my name is lori garrett and you are here in the council on foreign
[1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:48.800]  relations in new york i'm the senior fellow for global
[1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:52.400]  health here at the council on foreign relations
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:55.600]  with us today is a stellar group of scientists
[1:46:55.600 --> 1:47:00.000]  analysts journalists and as usual at the council on foreign relations
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:04.880]  a highly diverse and intelligent audience
[1:47:04.880 --> 1:47:07.760]  at the heart of the discussion was how to get american public to take the
[1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:12.400]  unpopular h1n1 vaccines
[1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:16.560]  on more from cornell medical school so i think we're all aware that the anti
[1:47:16.560 --> 1:47:20.160]  vaccine movement is having a field day on the internet
[1:47:20.160 --> 1:47:23.680]  and on media outlets like fox news and so on and
[1:47:23.680 --> 1:47:29.600]  causing reductions in in vaccine uptake and it appears to be
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:32.880]  back it up a bit that's the one of the cornell
[1:47:32.880 --> 1:47:36.400]  medical university people and then we've got them all list these are all high
[1:47:36.400 --> 1:47:39.520]  level government and university heads we've got their names listed in the
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:44.640]  article the but again the issue here is
[1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:47.920]  a field day and they call us crazy and all this
[1:47:47.920 --> 1:47:51.600]  when it's admitted it's killing people maiming people it's admitted it can cause
[1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:55.520]  brain damage it's admitted it's doing that it's admitted it has mercury in it
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:48:01.520]  and it's admitted that over 70 of americans and polls are now refusing it
[1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:07.760]  see they're losing so now they talk about how to lie to us back to it
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:13.360]  here it is on more from cornell medical school
[1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:17.200]  so i think we're all aware that the anti vaccine movement is having a field day
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:22.080]  in on the internet and on media outlets like fox news and so on and
[1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:27.360]  causing reductions in in vaccine uptake and it appears to be
[1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:31.120]  pretty unholy alliance of the ultra right and the ultra left working together
[1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:35.040]  in a sort of hitler stalin packed it falls
[1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:39.280]  it's not a hitler stalin no that's your masters that funded that the big banks
[1:48:39.280 --> 1:48:44.640]  that's declassified no we're people who don't want you setting
[1:48:44.640 --> 1:48:47.920]  the precedent to forcibly inoculate us and they say in the tape
[1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:53.120]  we want forced inoculation see we don't like your medical
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:57.680]  tyranny you little control freaks you arrogant bastards who enjoy lying to
[1:48:57.680 --> 1:49:01.200]  people for years saying there was no mercury in it when you
[1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:04.000]  knew full well there was you've lost credibility
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:07.520]  so now top actors top lawyers top politicians
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:11.360]  even robert kennedy junior all these even
[1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:15.120]  bill mars come out against it even the head of smashing pumpkins has come out
[1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:18.400]  everybody's coming out we're tired of you we're not left and right
[1:49:18.400 --> 1:49:21.520]  we're not in your box we don't buy your lies anymore
[1:49:21.520 --> 1:49:24.960]  you got it you little bastard you little eugenicist control freak
[1:49:24.960 --> 1:49:28.160]  where they talk about putting stuff in our vaccines to sterilize us the white
[1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:31.040]  house science are does we know how to read you son of a
[1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:35.440]  bitch excuse me back to that bastard
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:39.040]  i'm not sure we're countering these people very well
[1:49:39.040 --> 1:49:42.080]  and you have to take these people on in a different style
[1:49:42.080 --> 1:49:46.320]  than scientists are used to we we have to develop better sound bites we have to
[1:49:46.320 --> 1:49:50.560]  develop better um discussion or when you can't really
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:52.880]  debate these people but you have to develop better accounts
[1:49:52.880 --> 1:49:57.520]  because you can't really debate these people because we actually read the
[1:49:57.520 --> 1:50:01.280]  vaccine inserts you can't really debate these people because
[1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:05.840]  what we probably had 20 25 medical doctors top brain surgeons that
[1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:10.640]  you develop some of the most commonly used brain surgeries
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:14.640]  scientists who discovered excitotoxins now in all the medical
[1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:18.480]  dictionaries all these top virologists all these top genetic
[1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:21.600]  engineers who aren't scumbags like you
[1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:25.600]  like the majority of german doctors and british doctors who won't give it now
[1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:29.440]  and who won't take it you mean like the german government the german military
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:33.360]  that have special clean vaccines for themselves you mean like
[1:50:33.360 --> 1:50:37.040]  you mean your cover-ups imploding just like your global carbon tax
[1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:40.240]  just like your open borders just like your victim disarmament

[1:53:04.480 --> 1:53:07.680]  hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[1:53:07.680 --> 1:53:11.360]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:14.240]  than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[1:53:14.240 --> 1:53:17.200]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[1:53:17.200 --> 1:53:20.320]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[1:53:20.320 --> 1:53:23.440]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[1:53:23.440 --> 1:53:26.960]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[1:55:09.280 --> 1:55:14.000]  all right going back to the CFR all these big government heads university heads
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:17.040]  they're up there deciding how to counter the public who won't take their
[1:55:17.040 --> 1:55:20.400]  shots because we can read the inserts let's go back to it and then it goes
[1:55:20.400 --> 1:55:24.080]  into some spaces where they show the news media hyping the
[1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:29.440]  fear here it is you hear that we shouldn't take flu vaccines
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:33.920]  because the mercury will kill us well paul off it in the new york times last
[1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:38.880]  week pointed out that there is less mercury in a flu shot than there is in
[1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:42.480]  a tuna fish sandwich and and that's a powerful sound
[1:55:42.480 --> 1:55:47.120]  bite to use against against the crazy people
[1:55:47.120 --> 1:55:50.080]  crazy people and their kids are brain damage are you getting the swine flu
[1:55:50.080 --> 1:55:53.280]  vaccine uh no i i got the superman gene i never
[1:55:53.280 --> 1:55:56.880]  get sick here are the crazy people the flu vaccination that made me sick
[1:55:56.880 --> 1:55:59.680]  now i don't want to get like that no more oh he took it and he got sick
[1:55:59.680 --> 1:56:03.840]  no one is really stating the risk behind it hit pause so i'm not gonna
[1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:08.400]  back it up to that local new york news clip of the supposed crazy people see
[1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:12.320]  everybody i know won't take it because most of them had a kid drop
[1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:15.840]  on the ground convulsing or they got deathly sick from it
[1:56:15.840 --> 1:56:20.000]  oh but you're crazy you take a shot and almost kills you
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  like dale dudley the local 93.7 morning show host
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:28.240]  his whole body got paralyzed for a few weeks he still doesn't have feeling
[1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:32.240]  in some of his toes is he a crazy person he believed you
[1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:35.440]  he went and took your shot

[1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:54.160]  vaccination that made me sick now i don't want to get like that no more so i'll take my chances
[1:56:54.160 --> 1:56:58.800]  no one is really stating the risk behind it so i'm not going i'm not going to be a
[1:56:58.800 --> 1:57:03.520]  guinea pig for anyone so i'm not getting it we don't know uh
[1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:10.000]  how is the vaccination has been done so is the vaccination scarier than the flu
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:13.200]  yes i feel like we got a little crazy with this
[1:57:13.200 --> 1:57:17.920]  why did we get crazy with this uh i think the media hype stuff stuff

[1:57:29.680 --> 1:57:33.120]  everyone seems to agree that's the mainstream media spots
[1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:37.440]  the president now declaring the h1n1 outbreak a national emergency the
[1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:40.560]  white house says the president signed his proclamation last night it will
[1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:44.800]  allow medical officials to bypass certain federal requirements
[1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:48.480]  some officials describe this move as being similar to a declaration ahead of a
[1:57:48.480 --> 1:57:52.800]  hurricane but that wasn't the story we were
[1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:56.320]  getting from president just a few weeks ago when we saw the first cases of this
[1:57:56.320 --> 1:57:59.360]  virus back in the spring i don't want anybody to be
[1:57:59.360 --> 1:58:03.680]  alarmed but i do want everybody to be prepared

[2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:09.040]  little less than a month ago council on foreign relations we've got the names of
[2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:13.200]  the federal government and hospital and university heads
[2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:16.800]  talking about how they need to use sound bites and how crazy people are getting

[2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:25.920]  act like there's not enough of it to create the perception artificial
[2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:30.560]  scarcity and there's all this giggling and snickering on the conference call

[2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:59.280]  virus we're also making steady progress on developing a safe and
[2:01:59.280 --> 2:02:04.320]  effective h1n1 flu vaccine and we expect a flu shot program
[2:02:04.320 --> 2:02:08.480]  will begin soon this program will be completely voluntary
[2:02:08.480 --> 2:02:12.960]  completely voluntary completely voluntary completely voluntary
[2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:16.880]  completely voluntary good morning rory lansman i'm a member of the new york
[2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:20.800]  state assembly we had a hearing a 12 hour hearing on h1n1
[2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:25.840]  earlier this week and much of it focused on the mandatory vaccination that the
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:29.760]  new york state department of health has ordered of almost all health
[2:02:29.760 --> 2:02:33.760]  health care workers in new york state and i was wondering if you could offer an
[2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:38.080]  opinion on whether you think such a policy is is effective
[2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:43.600]  and and sound i have a very strong opinion
[2:02:43.600 --> 2:02:47.280]  and that is i think that's appropriate completely voluntary
[2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:51.520]  completely voluntary completely voluntary completely voluntary
[2:02:51.520 --> 2:02:55.600]  pause the news now see that's how they operate
[2:02:55.600 --> 2:02:59.280]  obama comes out and says i don't think it's racist to criticize me
[2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:04.160]  all of his surrogates say it he gets to play the good cop they play the bad cop
[2:03:04.160 --> 2:03:08.000]  they come out all over the country the feds try to force it to the states
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:12.640]  their own manuals say it and then obama's like i'm not making anybody
[2:03:12.640 --> 2:03:17.280]  he's the good guy back to the tape completely voluntary
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:21.920]  completely voluntary completely voluntary completely voluntary
[2:03:21.920 --> 2:03:25.600]  the news media is hyping the swine flu
[2:03:25.600 --> 2:03:30.960]  as though it's the next death mission and everybody's getting frightened
[2:03:30.960 --> 2:03:34.160]  and uh... do you agree with that no i don't
[2:03:34.160 --> 2:03:39.760]  from what i've seen uh... certainly some vulnerable people have died but not
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:44.000]  masses of people like the black plague or anything
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:47.120]  the truth is that many americans are not buying into the swine flu scam and
[2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:52.160]  refusing the vaccine however there are those who are buying
[2:03:52.160 --> 2:03:57.040]  into the scam and do intend to vaccinate themselves and their families
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:00.480]  but there are those who are on the fence about the vaccine
[2:04:00.480 --> 2:04:07.360]  and what do the experts recommend to get them to take the flu shot
[2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:10.480]  i think what would work better would be to if they're to say that there was a
[2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:13.360]  shortage and people tend to line up more for for something that
[2:04:13.360 --> 2:04:16.800]  demands you saw that there was one season where
[2:04:16.800 --> 2:04:22.240]  really people lined up all night to get a flu shot and i mean
[2:04:22.240 --> 2:04:26.560]  abc news puts the h1n1 vaccine artificial scarcity tactic test
[2:04:26.560 --> 2:04:29.680]  supplies of the vaccine running low doctors around the country are now
[2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:32.720]  finding themselves overrun with nervous parents
[2:04:32.720 --> 2:04:37.600]  there's abc's rachel martin for weeks doctors offices around the country have
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:42.320]  been fielding a flurry of phone calls
[2:04:42.320 --> 2:04:47.360]  all right stop right there let's back it up to the cfr saying we need to create
[2:04:47.360 --> 2:04:50.320]  artificial scarcity act like there's not enough
[2:04:50.320 --> 2:04:54.960]  then abc news puts it to the test i told you months ago this was the game plan
[2:04:54.960 --> 2:05:00.320]  i know our enemy and i'm gonna get them

[2:08:06.640 --> 2:08:10.400]  the information war continues it's alex jones
[2:08:10.400 --> 2:08:14.560]  and the gcn radio network i'm gonna be honest
[2:08:14.560 --> 2:08:17.360]  with the listeners
[2:08:17.680 --> 2:08:22.480]  i haven't been able to sleep as much as i could in the past and i thought it was
[2:08:22.480 --> 2:08:25.680]  coffee so i've cut my coffee intake from
[2:08:25.680 --> 2:08:28.560]  four cups a day which i space out so i can work
[2:08:28.560 --> 2:08:33.040]  16 hours a day some days to one cup in the morning
[2:08:33.040 --> 2:08:36.480]  maybe one in the afternoon so i've cut my coffee
[2:08:36.480 --> 2:08:40.480]  by more than half because instead of big cups i'm having little cups
[2:08:40.480 --> 2:08:43.680]  and i'm waking up the middle of the night thinking about the carbon tax i'm
[2:08:43.680 --> 2:08:48.240]  waking up at 3 a.m worried about the new world order
[2:08:48.240 --> 2:08:51.120]  worried about how they're going to stage a new terror attack
[2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:54.720]  i mean this is real not just intellectually studying it
[2:08:54.720 --> 2:08:58.400]  when i get up here and yell and scream and get mad i apologize for that
[2:08:58.400 --> 2:09:01.680]  but at the same time maybe i shouldn't apologize
[2:09:01.680 --> 2:09:05.760]  we need to be upset about what's happening
[2:09:05.760 --> 2:09:10.720]  i've read hundreds of cfr publications where they admitted 30 plus years ago
[2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:15.200]  they were going to set up a north american union by stealth that's a quote
[2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:18.640]  and where they admitted they were going to bankrupt the banks and the economy
[2:09:18.640 --> 2:09:22.720]  to bring in the one world government the carbon tax and a one child policy and
[2:09:22.720 --> 2:09:26.080]  how they're going to tax everything we do and control our lives and how they
[2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:28.880]  militarize the police and train them to use
[2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:32.320]  rubber bullets and tasers on us before they train them to actually shoot us
[2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:35.360]  and now police departments all over are announcing if you run they're going to
[2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:38.720]  shoot you in the back and they are shooting people in the back
[2:09:38.720 --> 2:09:42.480]  and killing people and covering it up and i don't want to hate the police
[2:09:42.480 --> 2:09:46.480]  what are you doing you're becoming nazis
[2:09:46.480 --> 2:09:50.800]  the system is out of control and then i see the cfr audio that this
[2:09:50.800 --> 2:09:54.880]  video directors cut in with news clips where they're saying okay
[2:09:54.880 --> 2:09:58.240]  most people aren't taking the shot because of what's on the insert
[2:09:58.240 --> 2:10:01.280]  and they admit it didn't really bad that h1n1
[2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:05.760]  it didn't really a very dangerous flu virus it's very weak
[2:10:05.760 --> 2:10:08.480]  well how do we do it well we say there isn't enough
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:12.480]  to create artificial scarcity and a panic to get it
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:18.400]  and that's what they do everywhere folks i remember in january having on the
[2:10:18.400 --> 2:10:22.400]  air reporters and city managers and emergency managers in
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:28.880]  illinois indiana new york state arizona and getting the
[2:10:28.880 --> 2:10:33.520]  documents from the state secret saying get ready for millions
[2:10:33.520 --> 2:10:36.640]  dead get ready for mass graves get ready for the militia
[2:10:36.640 --> 2:10:40.960]  to attack your police department get ready for the veterans to attack you
[2:10:40.960 --> 2:10:44.240]  with bombs then i got the homeland security in my
[2:10:44.240 --> 2:10:52.240]  report saying it admitting homeland securities for good americans good people
[2:10:52.240 --> 2:10:56.720]  who were against the foreign bank takeover and then tell them police
[2:10:56.720 --> 2:11:01.280]  you're going to do a homeland security drill for terrorists attacking your
[2:11:01.280 --> 2:11:05.360]  tiny police department and we're going to do a drill where you come to the airport
[2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:10.800]  and we deliver you the flu vaccine and the militias try to steal it
[2:11:10.800 --> 2:11:16.000]  a role-playing scenario to demonize militias
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:19.920]  this was in january so i got on air in january and march and i said they're
[2:11:19.920 --> 2:11:23.680]  going to stage some type of big flu deal and we
[2:11:23.680 --> 2:11:27.600]  i posted the audio of that you know months after it happened we
[2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:31.520]  it was live but then we we reposted it said look i was right
[2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:35.280]  i'm not that smart i knew they were gonna
[2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:39.600]  artificially back in april they they delivered the seasonal flu
[2:11:39.600 --> 2:11:43.360]  with arm guards in austin to the hospitals and had police parked around
[2:11:43.360 --> 2:11:46.480]  the clock out front the hospitals as if people would
[2:11:46.480 --> 2:11:52.640]  hear there was a flu shot there and run in and kill everybody for it
[2:11:52.640 --> 2:11:57.120]  that was done to manipulate the police so the word got out that it was special
[2:11:57.120 --> 2:12:01.200]  so you would all go take it and so the doctors and nurses would
[2:12:01.200 --> 2:12:04.640]  get the word it was special and now they're doing it with the h1n1
[2:12:04.640 --> 2:12:09.200]  and i told you they keep announcing we've got the flu shot the h1n1
[2:12:09.200 --> 2:12:12.720]  and in a big city a few thousand morons will show up
[2:12:12.720 --> 2:12:16.800]  they'll be lined up going they ran out they didn't run out they have 18
[2:12:16.800 --> 2:12:20.160]  wheelers full of it on that are refrigerated
[2:12:20.160 --> 2:12:23.920]  they're doing that so the news can show long lines
[2:12:23.920 --> 2:12:30.080]  now i told you that here's the council on foreign relations
[2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:34.480]  in a meeting admitting it here it is
[2:12:34.480 --> 2:12:40.080]  then we cut to the news reporting the same thing
[2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:44.320]  okay we uh i think what would work better would be to if they're to say
[2:12:44.320 --> 2:12:47.360]  that there was a shortage and people tend to line up more for for something
[2:12:47.360 --> 2:12:50.960]  that didn't demand you saw that there was one season
[2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:55.040]  where really people lined up all night to get a flu shot and i mean
[2:12:55.040 --> 2:12:59.120]  back it up back at it again i want to play that one more time then it cuts to abc
[2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:04.000]  news a week after this was aired doing the exact thing and listen how they
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:08.480]  laugh it's so fun to have all these government and
[2:13:08.480 --> 2:13:11.360]  university and medical heads we list them here in the article
[2:13:11.360 --> 2:13:14.880]  at info wars dot com cfr vaccines no harmful
[2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:19.520]  no more harmful than tuna sandwich laughing about it but then when they cut
[2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:22.080]  to the news it's not done in a laughing fashion
[2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:26.480]  it's done with oh my gosh we're dead here it is
[2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:31.680]  i think what would work better would be to if they're to say that there was a
[2:13:31.680 --> 2:13:36.400]  shortage and people tend to line up more for for something that didn't demand
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:39.520]  we saw that there was one season where really people lined up all night to get
[2:13:39.520 --> 2:13:42.640]  a flu shot and i mean
[2:13:43.120 --> 2:13:47.360]  abc news puts the h1n1 vaccine artificial scarcity tactic to the test
[2:13:47.360 --> 2:13:50.800]  and with supplies of the vaccine running low doctors around the country are now
[2:13:50.800 --> 2:13:53.760]  finding themselves overrun with nervous parents
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:13:58.720]  here's abc's rachel martin for weeks doctors offices around the country have
[2:13:58.720 --> 2:14:03.600]  been fielding a flurry of phone calls
[2:14:03.600 --> 2:14:07.600]  available at our office at this time telling patients the same thing
[2:14:07.600 --> 2:14:11.600]  we are out of the flu shot vaccine right now panic now the next day
[2:14:11.600 --> 2:14:15.760]  swanson is in the office calling patients to vaccinate now
[2:14:15.760 --> 2:14:19.760]  alert alert oh my gosh there's none of it and we need to protect michael
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:22.800]  he's gonna be one of these kids that could end up in the hospital and i don't
[2:14:22.800 --> 2:14:26.160]  think we want that by 10 a.m the waiting room is full with the
[2:14:26.160 --> 2:14:29.840]  vaccine now in short supply parents are lining up in doctors
[2:14:29.840 --> 2:14:33.280]  offices like this one hoping to get their questions answered
[2:14:33.280 --> 2:14:36.640]  and the kids vaccinate i think what would work better would be to
[2:14:36.640 --> 2:14:39.760]  if they're to say that there was a shortage and people tend to line up more
[2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:42.720]  for for something that didn't demand
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:45.840]  we saw that there was one season where really people lined up all night to get
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:50.000]  a flu shot and i mean for whatever reasons i think it's
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:52.880]  pretty much safe to say that the media and the government are yanking your
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:14:58.560]  chain that's what the maker of this said uh yeah there's sterilants in the shots
[2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:01.040]  that's what's going on do you think that the people who are making it are
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:05.040]  putting it out in controlled amounts so that it is producing this demand
[2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:09.440]  absolutely absolutely it's the drug companies that are making money at this
[2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:12.560]  who's making money at the end of the day
[2:15:12.560 --> 2:15:16.480]  the participating members the council and farm relations symposium include
[2:15:16.480 --> 2:15:19.760]  arnold and it goes through the names at the end and we have that up on the
[2:15:19.760 --> 2:15:24.560]  website the heads of microbiology research professor research
[2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:28.480]  director department of global health george washington university
[2:15:28.480 --> 2:15:33.360]  science magazine correspondent just just talk about it
[2:15:33.360 --> 2:15:39.440]  all right and that's the end of the clip but
[2:15:39.440 --> 2:15:43.440]  the good news is once the public figures out
[2:15:43.440 --> 2:15:46.960]  the hundred or so tricks i want to write a book
[2:15:46.960 --> 2:15:50.800]  the hundred tricks of the of the new world order
[2:15:50.800 --> 2:15:54.560]  there's probably more than 100 tricks you could probably make it 50 tricks
[2:15:54.560 --> 2:15:59.360]  but the point is they have tricks they have little manipulative games
[2:15:59.360 --> 2:16:06.000]  that they play and they just do it perpetually to control people
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:09.600]  but the good news is you're getting wise to them
[2:16:09.600 --> 2:16:14.240]  now it's time to bring these people to justice because i'll guarantee you there
[2:16:14.240 --> 2:16:17.600]  was memos went out to all the media you hear the talking points
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:21.520]  saying it's artificially scarce it's telling you to come get it
[2:16:21.520 --> 2:16:25.120]  that's criminal but they've set the precedent where the media now just
[2:16:25.120 --> 2:16:28.560]  admits yeah most our tv shows and media and movies
[2:16:28.560 --> 2:16:32.960]  are paid for by the government that isn't a free society folks that's a
[2:16:32.960 --> 2:16:38.080]  spooky devilish cult nazi soviet control freak
[2:16:38.080 --> 2:16:42.560]  society get it through your head they're trying to manipulate you almost
[2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:45.600]  everything you watch and see is a manipulation
[2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:49.360]  except for alternative news on the web and that's full of disinfo and
[2:16:49.360 --> 2:16:53.280]  operatives and mentally ill people as well
[2:16:55.120 --> 2:16:58.560]  so check stuff out for yourself don't believe anything
[2:16:58.560 --> 2:17:04.480]  look into it for yourself let's talk to carl in texas carl you're on the air
[2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:13.120]  carl go ahead okay look i just i had three questions from last week and you
[2:17:13.120 --> 2:17:16.560]  answered two of them so i had to call back here and this is actually in relation
[2:17:16.560 --> 2:17:20.720]  to the fema camps that i wanted to find out about here in houston
[2:17:20.720 --> 2:17:24.320]  i'm just trying to find out do you know of any where
[2:17:24.320 --> 2:17:27.920]  any of the facility camps might be in this area and because the reason why i
[2:17:27.920 --> 2:17:31.280]  was asking is because i found out through another resource
[2:17:31.280 --> 2:17:34.400]  when you had a bunch of callers i guess calling in about
[2:17:34.400 --> 2:17:37.520]  five six weeks ago getting all these calls from other people
[2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:40.720]  you know seeing all this kind of military activity in their own
[2:17:40.720 --> 2:17:44.080]  neighborhoods i uh... talked to an ex cop to kind of
[2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:47.440]  ask her to see if she could put her feelers out there and find out from
[2:17:47.440 --> 2:17:50.160]  other police officers if there's been any other
[2:17:50.160 --> 2:17:54.000]  military activity here in houston and uh... somebody that was standing next
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:57.840]  to me said they actually closed off a highway and this person
[2:17:57.840 --> 2:18:04.000]  said they saw hundreds of humvees and armored police vehicles
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:07.360]  so i don't know if that's a set up for anything
[2:18:07.360 --> 2:18:11.920]  uh... for where these camps may be here i have no idea and that's why i was
[2:18:11.920 --> 2:18:15.040]  asking do you know of any facilities around this area
[2:18:15.040 --> 2:18:18.320]  okay carl i appreciate your call i guess you asked your first questions i
[2:18:18.320 --> 2:18:20.720]  didn't i didn't hear the third one or i would have asked it
[2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:27.120]  we also have time constraints we sell a video that i consulted on
[2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:32.400]  and that i'm in called camp fema and it's all the government hearings
[2:18:32.400 --> 2:18:35.600]  video clips government documents with the names
[2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:40.160]  houston chronicle la times new york times wall street journal
[2:18:40.160 --> 2:18:44.400]  admitting the camps the legislation to expand the camps
[2:18:44.400 --> 2:18:48.480]  the problem is there's a lot of different types of camps
[2:18:48.480 --> 2:18:52.080]  and a lot of different types of infrastructure
[2:18:52.080 --> 2:18:56.000]  a we have more prisons than any other country in the world
[2:18:56.000 --> 2:19:01.200]  per capita we have more period than any other country in the world even china
[2:19:01.200 --> 2:19:05.360]  b under top-off in le exercises and others
[2:19:05.360 --> 2:19:09.200]  the government has drilled in every major city publicly
[2:19:09.200 --> 2:19:12.480]  to lock down cities and put you in sports stadiums
[2:19:12.480 --> 2:19:16.160]  and put constant in a wire around them that's what dictators always use
[2:19:16.160 --> 2:19:19.440]  worldwide for over a hundred years is sports stadiums
[2:19:19.440 --> 2:19:23.680]  so there's your big camp you got where the houston astros play
[2:19:23.680 --> 2:19:31.840]  you got the houston texans you've got your high school facilities
[2:19:31.840 --> 2:19:36.080]  you also have old military bases that they have refurbished with the barb wire
[2:19:36.080 --> 2:19:39.440]  aiming in but they don't put big neon signs up saying
[2:19:39.440 --> 2:19:43.440]  this is a camp this is a camp this is a camp this is a camp
[2:19:43.440 --> 2:19:47.120]  we only know about it because of the funding through congress
[2:19:47.120 --> 2:19:51.200]  for the purchase orders for the camps that have been in the houston chronicle
[2:19:51.200 --> 2:19:54.480]  and everywhere else
[2:19:54.480 --> 2:19:59.760]  but that's your camps then you have things like camp x-ray and black

[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:08.080]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[2:22:08.080 --> 2:22:12.000]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:15.440]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:22:15.440 --> 2:22:18.320]  it's true total government control of electricity
[2:22:18.320 --> 2:22:21.840]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[2:22:21.840 --> 2:22:25.440]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:29.360]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[2:22:29.360 --> 2:22:32.960]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids

[2:24:26.480 --> 2:24:42.160]  okay on the subject of FEMA camps
[2:24:42.160 --> 2:24:47.520]  i predicted two months before whenever glen bet came out and said i believe the
[2:24:47.520 --> 2:24:49.920]  camps are real but we're doing an investigation
[2:24:49.920 --> 2:24:53.840]  i even named the fake camps he was going to name
[2:24:53.840 --> 2:24:59.360]  because i had debunked him back in 96 97 uh the indiana
[2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:03.840]  amtrak terminal and others and then he did one and didn't attribute the source
[2:25:03.840 --> 2:25:08.240]  he showed a satellite photo of a north korean
[2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:12.080]  labor camp and then just said someone made it up so you can always find
[2:25:12.080 --> 2:25:14.800]  this info you can find people on the web saying blood drinking tube of
[2:25:14.800 --> 2:25:19.280]  cobblers control things that doesn't mean it's the case
[2:25:19.280 --> 2:25:23.920]  and so he didn't address the houston chronicle the civilian inmate labor
[2:25:23.920 --> 2:25:29.120]  camp program that list in the original document 12 now 24
[2:25:29.120 --> 2:25:32.640]  civilian inmate labor camp programs it doesn't list the supermaxes
[2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:36.480]  around the country they're opening for political dissidents that's been abc news
[2:25:36.480 --> 2:25:39.760]  us news world report
[2:25:40.160 --> 2:25:43.280]  i mean people are still calling me saying where's the proof they're going to
[2:25:43.280 --> 2:25:48.080]  put the military on the streets ap roiders army times
[2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:54.800]  pentagon north com they want 379 000 troops they've already got 40 000
[2:25:54.800 --> 2:25:57.760]  troops on the streets marines and army are everywhere running
[2:25:57.760 --> 2:26:02.400]  illegal checkpoints unannounced but it's confirmed in local news local
[2:26:02.400 --> 2:26:05.040]  news says why are marines out searching people
[2:26:05.040 --> 2:26:09.360]  well you're not for drunks are you you know it's for pr purposes
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:13.920]  to set the table and get everybody prepared for this
[2:26:13.920 --> 2:26:17.280]  it's like 10 years ago i'd read club of rome and un documents how they were
[2:26:17.280 --> 2:26:21.040]  going to have a global carbon tax and tax carbon dioxide and people
[2:26:21.040 --> 2:26:24.720]  wrote big national article saying i was a lying crazy cook
[2:26:24.720 --> 2:26:30.400]  three years ago when i made in game right as i was about to release it i had
[2:26:30.400 --> 2:26:34.320]  the air to the rothschild fortune on lord rothschild's son
[2:26:34.320 --> 2:26:38.240]  who heads up all the all these big green movements
[2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:41.600]  but david the rothschild
[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:47.600]  lord rothschild's son and i said it's a carbon tax he said no that's a
[2:26:47.600 --> 2:26:51.040]  conspiracy theory and laughed at me now he knew it was a carbon tax
[2:26:51.040 --> 2:26:56.960]  then we cut to al gore that same week saying it's a carbon tax
[2:26:56.960 --> 2:27:00.720]  but see they had national media say it didn't exist
[2:27:00.720 --> 2:27:04.960]  for years so we couldn't build an opposition they know you're lazy
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:09.520]  they know you want to rationalize they know you don't want to get involved
[2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:12.880]  hitler said that good propaganda speaks to people's laziness
[2:27:12.880 --> 2:27:16.800]  and it's simple it's not complex like this radio show
[2:27:16.800 --> 2:27:21.600]  and so it's real simple there's no carbon tax there's no global government
[2:27:21.600 --> 2:27:24.400]  the banks didn't engineer this there's no plan
[2:27:24.400 --> 2:27:27.280]  there's well i have all these documents i have all these textbooks i have all
[2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:30.720]  these plans you you're about to pass the legislation it's
[2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:34.800]  past the house it's in the senate and you know
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:40.160]  salon and new republic and all these big publications every week
[2:27:40.160 --> 2:27:44.720]  say alex jones is insane and believes there's a global government and a
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:49.040]  carbon tax and they laugh
[2:27:49.040 --> 2:27:52.880]  they're laughing so weak-minded people who are looking
[2:27:52.880 --> 2:27:56.800]  look at that and go must be nothing here now that guy's a cook
[2:27:56.800 --> 2:27:59.600]  he gets angry
[2:27:59.840 --> 2:28:03.920]  and then once they pass it they say we always said we were going to do this
[2:28:03.920 --> 2:28:06.880]  it's the same thing with fema camps everybody calls me about are there
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:09.680]  troops i heard there were troops i and i'm like well here's
[2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:13.760]  here's 500 mainstream news articles plus on info wars and present planet
[2:28:13.760 --> 2:28:17.120]  we've had the army kernels on the army generals the marines on
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:25.920]  we've had local news on we've had state police press releases
[2:28:25.920 --> 2:28:29.520]  i mean i remember since 99 i would release
[2:28:29.520 --> 2:28:33.840]  leaked government documents stating that the government was setting up a
[2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:36.880]  federalized police force for gun owners conservatives
[2:28:36.880 --> 2:28:43.120]  landowners rule rural people and the spy networks and people paid
[2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:46.400]  attention some now i release those documents it finally
[2:28:46.400 --> 2:28:50.880]  breaks into the mainstream news that's why we're now dangerous
[2:28:50.880 --> 2:28:54.160]  because we have a big enough audience of activists
[2:28:54.160 --> 2:28:58.160]  say if we do everything we can and hit them as hard as we can
[2:28:58.160 --> 2:29:01.440]  we can punch through we've just now gotten to the point
[2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:04.560]  where we can land blows we've just now gotten to the point where we can get in
[2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:08.160]  the boxing ring with these people and hold our
[2:29:08.160 --> 2:29:11.360]  own and we're bleeding and got black eyes and they're beating the hell out of
[2:29:11.360 --> 2:29:13.840]  us but we've knocked them to the mat a few times and
[2:29:13.840 --> 2:29:18.880]  you know we're we're totally focused and committed it's a thriller in manila
[2:29:18.880 --> 2:29:22.560]  and if we can just keep the rounds going we're going to beat these people
[2:29:22.560 --> 2:29:27.680]  because they're now in afterburner they're trying to bring it in
[2:29:27.680 --> 2:29:31.520]  so they're lying about everything while simultaneously admitting they're setting
[2:29:31.520 --> 2:29:34.640]  up a world government all these years they've denied it
[2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:38.080]  so it's blowing up in their face they say there's no mercury in the shot

[2:33:18.080 --> 2:33:21.760]  years ago i said that when they begin to announce the camps
[2:33:21.760 --> 2:33:24.640]  to everyone
[2:33:25.840 --> 2:33:29.680]  that it would be advertised as an emergency shelter
[2:33:29.680 --> 2:33:34.240]  as a community place for all the homeless yes you've got to be searched
[2:33:34.240 --> 2:33:38.080]  yes they split the families up yes cps praise on your children when you're
[2:33:38.080 --> 2:33:41.520]  inside of them now they have the emergency centers act
[2:33:41.520 --> 2:33:44.800]  in congress admitting they already have six giant
[2:33:44.800 --> 2:33:49.680]  regional FEMA camps on military bases they're merging the national guard the
[2:33:49.680 --> 2:33:55.200]  regular army infusion centers and here's an article
[2:33:55.200 --> 2:34:01.040]  county pursues emergency shelter the Adams county board of supervisors
[2:34:01.040 --> 2:34:04.480]  voted money to tentatively move forward with plans for an emergency shelter at
[2:34:04.480 --> 2:34:09.200]  us 61 to be run by the mississippi emergency
[2:34:09.200 --> 2:34:12.880]  management agency the federal emergency management agency
[2:34:12.880 --> 2:34:15.840]  and is meant to serve as a durable shelter during a hurricane or tornado
[2:34:15.840 --> 2:34:20.560]  events but to also act duly for during civil unrest
[2:34:20.560 --> 2:34:23.680]  as the houston chronicle and wall street journal have reported they're
[2:34:23.680 --> 2:34:28.000]  building these everywhere and they're calling half of american
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:34.080]  children ap reports today are on food stamps and 90% of black children
[2:34:34.080 --> 2:34:37.760]  they want you bankrupted that's in their own documents i read
[2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:43.040]  in the second hour statements by the un statements by the federal government
[2:34:43.040 --> 2:34:46.880]  they want the government to bankrupt things and i'll say this
[2:34:46.880 --> 2:34:51.520]  this morning i watched a 10 minute interview uncut with rush limbaugh
[2:34:51.520 --> 2:34:56.560]  on fox i watched the on brettbart.com i watched it
[2:34:56.560 --> 2:35:01.440]  and limbaugh told the truth he said obama wants to destroy the economy by
[2:35:01.440 --> 2:35:04.640]  design so the government can take over and they want
[2:35:04.640 --> 2:35:11.360]  one six not one seventh it is more like one six closer to 20 one fifth
[2:35:11.360 --> 2:35:14.960]  it's like one fifth and a half you want to get technical of the economy
[2:35:14.960 --> 2:35:19.200]  to take over every facet of your lives to take over and regulate everything and
[2:35:19.200 --> 2:35:21.840]  the bill says that and the bills got the death
[2:35:21.840 --> 2:35:28.960]  panels and it's got the forced compulsory insurance
[2:35:29.680 --> 2:35:34.000]  but see limbaugh can tell the truth now because bush is out of office
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  so he can play the part of the opposition
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:41.760]  just like glenn beckon so when they put in a right-wing savior in three years
[2:35:41.760 --> 2:35:45.840]  or seven years or whatever the case is
[2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:49.280]  people will think the republicans are going to save them and we hear about the
[2:35:49.280 --> 2:35:52.960]  soul of the republican party and everywhere the monta republicans better
[2:35:52.960 --> 2:35:57.120]  get mainline and better compromise or they're going to lose
[2:35:57.120 --> 2:36:01.680]  no republicans had better become libertarian and constitutionalist
[2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:06.320]  and every poll shows hispanics blacks whites asians would vote for them in
[2:36:06.320 --> 2:36:09.120]  droves it shows they would win by a landslide
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:11.840]  but they won't vote for republicans because they know they're a bunch of

[2:37:50.400 --> 2:37:53.680]  all right i want to bring up our biggest and longest sponsor the owner of the
[2:37:53.680 --> 2:37:57.360]  genesis network and who i've chosen to buy gold and silver from
[2:37:57.360 --> 2:38:01.920]  and gold went up again today to record heights
[2:38:02.560 --> 2:38:05.920]  and ted is still holding the price of gold he bought at one thousand twenty
[2:38:05.920 --> 2:38:09.360]  dollars an ounce of what the market was and silver even lower but it
[2:38:09.360 --> 2:38:12.640]  isn't going to last long he sold out of the gold at nine hundred and fifty
[2:38:12.640 --> 2:38:15.440]  bucks when it was a thousand thirty he sold out of
[2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:18.480]  the gold that was a thousand when it was a thousand forty five
[2:38:18.480 --> 2:38:21.760]  now he's about to sell out of gold at a thousand two hundred that's what the
[2:38:21.760 --> 2:38:25.280]  market was goldy price at that level in the market
[2:38:25.280 --> 2:38:30.480]  now when it's a thousand sixty so
[2:38:31.040 --> 2:38:36.720]  he's got it great deal frank's sovereigns in the gold coins silver coins he's got
[2:38:36.720 --> 2:38:40.080]  but they won't be here long at this price ten anderson good to have you here
[2:38:40.080 --> 2:38:42.640]  with us yeah nice to have me up again i had to be
[2:38:42.640 --> 2:38:45.680]  up with you again alex i gotta tell you what an awesome
[2:38:45.680 --> 2:38:49.760]  day in gold it was this time the indian people that push the
[2:38:49.760 --> 2:38:53.200]  gold up to where it is today it has been china i mean every
[2:38:53.200 --> 2:38:58.160]  time we go to sleep gold takes this big spike but it happened actually in the
[2:38:58.160 --> 2:39:02.240]  new york market today and it was driven by the indian people
[2:39:02.240 --> 2:39:07.920]  and gold right now just touched just underneath uh one thousand and ninety
[2:39:07.920 --> 2:39:10.720]  dollars an ounce which means that that eleven hundred
[2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:14.160]  dollar an ounce gold is just a whisker away
[2:39:14.160 --> 2:39:18.240]  and we're gonna i and i believe in all my heart and soul that that's gonna
[2:39:18.240 --> 2:39:22.320]  happen well this is exactly what bob Chapman has been calling
[2:39:22.320 --> 2:39:26.800]  by the numbers he said it would go up to one thousand sixty back down to one
[2:39:26.800 --> 2:39:29.120]  thirty then next it would find its footing
[2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:33.360]  at one thousand eighty plus then he said it would go down to one sixty
[2:39:33.360 --> 2:39:36.560]  then it'll go and once it goes over one thousand one hundred
[2:39:36.560 --> 2:39:40.320]  that's a psychological barrier again the skies then the limit
[2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:45.520]  regardless it's real it's a precious metal you got an insanely good deal on it
[2:39:45.520 --> 2:39:49.760]  folks are insane you're selling gold that you bought in the market when it was
[2:39:49.760 --> 2:39:54.400]  almost seventy dollars under right now gold is at
[2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:59.680]  one thousand eighty five dollars and ten cents an ounce it went to one
[2:39:59.680 --> 2:40:04.960]  thousand eighty nine and change just an hour ago
[2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:10.720]  ladies and gentlemen this is a time machine you get to get in a time machine
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:17.600]  go back to the prices over a month ago but some of you probably won't you can
[2:40:17.600 --> 2:40:20.720]  buy one coin you can buy a thousand coins ted has got it
[2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:25.280]  right now for delivery to you ted tell us what you got well again alex i was on
[2:40:25.280 --> 2:40:28.640]  your show just yesterday and we're talking about the franks at two thirty
[2:40:28.640 --> 2:40:31.520]  six and the british sovereign was at two ninety one
[2:40:31.520 --> 2:40:35.680]  gold has gone up over thirty dollars an ounce today and i have the same gold at
[2:40:35.680 --> 2:40:38.960]  the same price and i am just grateful to the
[2:40:38.960 --> 2:40:42.480]  federal reserve system and the central banks of the world for
[2:40:42.480 --> 2:40:46.480]  depressing the prices of gold down to that one thousand twenty areas so i could
[2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:49.840]  buy it but guess what they lost the battle again
[2:40:49.840 --> 2:40:53.200]  and now gold is up almost at eleven hundred dollars an ounce
[2:40:53.200 --> 2:40:56.960]  and i just can't say it enough that is a fabulous buy
[2:40:56.960 --> 2:41:01.280]  and get and i was also able to get myself locked back into some more of
[2:41:01.280 --> 2:41:06.000]  those walking liberties at eight sixty nine and that is just a
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:08.720]  oh man i can't tell you that's a great price
[2:41:08.720 --> 2:41:11.760]  and uh... at this particular time in the marketplace
[2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:15.520]  compare it to the federal reserve note i mean you just can't beat it i don't know
[2:41:15.520 --> 2:41:19.280]  how people can see that staying in paper is a better idea
[2:41:19.280 --> 2:41:23.040]  than having a piece of gold that actually takes human labor to pull out of
[2:41:23.040 --> 2:41:26.320]  the ground well you know it said city bank as you
[2:41:26.320 --> 2:41:28.720]  know declared for bankruptcy yesterday
[2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:32.320]  that was the third largest bank uh... they're consolidating
[2:41:32.320 --> 2:41:36.560]  have you read the mclatchy newspapers
[2:41:36.560 --> 2:41:40.880]  syndicated analysis ten page report how goldman secretly bet on the u.s
[2:41:40.880 --> 2:41:43.920]  housing crash to consolidate the market and bring down bear
[2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:47.520]  sterns that's what our guests a year ago said they were doing and said it was
[2:41:47.520 --> 2:41:52.400]  criminal max kaiser gerald solante bob Chapman
[2:41:52.400 --> 2:41:57.040]  professor black there needs to be indictments why can't we just finally
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:41:59.440]  this is what's getting me in hot water that's why they're after me because i
[2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:03.440]  know the silver bullet arrest these bastards it could all end
[2:42:03.440 --> 2:42:07.040]  it could all stop there it's a bunch of made-off criminals
[2:42:07.040 --> 2:42:11.920]  a bunch of ken lay types ken lay wrote the al gore carbon tax twelve years ago
[2:42:11.920 --> 2:42:15.840]  i mean ten it's like groundhog day we keep waking up the same nightmare as it
[2:42:15.840 --> 2:42:18.960]  gets worse we need to identify well
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:22.080]  that's another issue the point here is ted
[2:42:22.080 --> 2:42:27.040]  my god said how high is gold to go well that's a good question that we break
[2:42:27.040 --> 2:42:30.480]  through this eleven hundred dollars an ounce and i would say the next target
[2:42:30.480 --> 2:42:32.960]  is going to be up there on thirteen hundred
[2:42:32.960 --> 2:42:38.000]  uh... i truly believe with the momentum that we have going on in this market i
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:41.600]  don't think this bull markets over until we've seen twenty six hundred
[2:42:41.600 --> 2:42:45.520]  dollars an ounce and we've gone beyond that level that's not a way that's what
[2:42:45.520 --> 2:42:49.520]  the conservative commentators are saying on fox and seeing everywhere in msnbc
[2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:52.240]  and cnbc all some people are saying six thousand
[2:42:52.240 --> 2:42:55.920]  hey you know what ted gold i bought at three hundred dollars an ounce or less
[2:42:55.920 --> 2:42:59.920]  that i bought eight years ago guess what alex jones hadn't sold that back to you
[2:42:59.920 --> 2:43:03.200]  has he teddy no you're still holding on to it that's right because it's an
[2:43:03.200 --> 2:43:07.360]  emergency to keep my business going it's an emergency money for my
[2:43:07.360 --> 2:43:10.880]  children and my wife it's an emergency if we get sued
[2:43:10.880 --> 2:43:13.520]  i can always have something to defend myself with
[2:43:13.520 --> 2:43:17.040]  and and again i don't have it for an investment
[2:43:17.040 --> 2:43:20.960]  i'm not selling it even though most the gold and silver i bought was silver at
[2:43:20.960 --> 2:43:24.400]  five dollars gold at three hundred or lower
[2:43:24.400 --> 2:43:29.120]  and and and the bottom line here is ladies and gentlemen
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:33.440]  you cannot beat getting into gold and silver right now
[2:43:33.440 --> 2:43:36.320]  and if you ever saw it start dropping you can dump it
[2:43:36.320 --> 2:43:41.040]  why would people stay in paper ted and it kind of boggles my mind i mean
[2:43:41.040 --> 2:43:43.920]  obviously people have been lulled into the idea
[2:43:43.920 --> 2:43:47.920]  that paper is better than gold and that happened in 1971
[2:43:47.920 --> 2:43:51.760]  when richard nixon was in office and he had to close the gold window
[2:43:51.760 --> 2:43:55.600]  and we went into a complete fiat paper system
[2:43:55.600 --> 2:44:00.480]  i can tell you in the 1980s there was a tremendous effort by the central banks
[2:44:00.480 --> 2:44:03.920]  to suppress the gold below four hundred dollars an ounce
[2:44:03.920 --> 2:44:06.960]  and as long as we had foreign money being lent to us
[2:44:06.960 --> 2:44:10.480]  we're able to live on that prosperity that somebody else created
[2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:12.640]  and we're able to do it but you know what
[2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:15.440]  there isn't a foreign nation out there that wants us
[2:44:15.440 --> 2:44:19.760]  government securities anymore and it just doesn't make sense to be in a fiat
[2:44:19.760 --> 2:44:22.720]  currency when the whole world is trying to get away from it
[2:44:22.720 --> 2:44:25.920]  it's almost like the people of the united states the majority of them at
[2:44:25.920 --> 2:44:28.880]  this point in time have their head in the sand that think that this is going to
[2:44:28.880 --> 2:44:32.160]  all get better for them and i got news for you it's not
[2:44:32.160 --> 2:44:35.840]  when when you see the government doing what they're doing and printing money
[2:44:35.840 --> 2:44:41.520]  like there's no tomorrow the united states dollar is doomed ted i i'm gonna go to
[2:44:41.520 --> 2:44:44.320]  calls here in a moment but i want to finish up on this
[2:44:44.320 --> 2:44:49.360]  i'm looking at modest resources dot com you have the live 24 hour spot gold
[2:44:49.360 --> 2:44:53.920]  live 24 hour spot silver the graphs are almost identical
[2:44:53.920 --> 2:44:57.840]  above and below each other showing the market manipulation
[2:44:57.840 --> 2:45:00.640]  and now the federal reserve has been admitting what they wouldn't admit
[2:45:00.640 --> 2:45:04.480]  previously that they're manipulating the price down and as you said
[2:45:04.480 --> 2:45:07.680]  they're losing the battle because the dollar's plunging
[2:45:07.680 --> 2:45:10.800]  because of the actions the bankers have taken
[2:45:10.800 --> 2:45:16.000]  folks give minus resources a call ted how long can you hold this deal well i'm
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:19.440]  going to be holding this one just for tonight because gold has gone up way too
[2:45:19.440 --> 2:45:22.080]  much it's not going to be a surprise to me to see
[2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:26.640]  gold up over a thousand ninety dollars an ounce so i'm i'll have to hold on this
[2:45:26.640 --> 2:45:30.080]  one i usually say i'll see what happens but i'm
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:33.040]  quite certain that i'm gonna have to raise my prices tomorrow
[2:45:33.040 --> 2:45:38.800]  800-686-2237 the word on the street was there was going to be a
[2:45:38.800 --> 2:45:42.480]  stock market crash this week i didn't go with that i hope that's not the case
[2:45:42.480 --> 2:45:45.280]  but this ain't looking good with city bank going down this week
[2:45:45.280 --> 2:45:48.720]  i was told last week city bank was going to go under by a high-powered
[2:45:48.720 --> 2:45:51.840]  financial reporter i was talking to trying to get on the show
[2:45:51.840 --> 2:45:56.240]  he won't come on the show but but he said that off the record city bank was
[2:45:56.240 --> 2:45:59.840]  probably going to go under uh and that we were going to have a crash this week
[2:45:59.840 --> 2:46:03.280]  i don't know if that's the case i got this word from other
[2:46:03.280 --> 2:46:08.080]  high-powered media people that i talked to uh i hope that's not the case but
[2:46:08.080 --> 2:46:11.440]  this isn't looking good folks get into gold and silver right now
[2:46:11.440 --> 2:46:14.880]  because when the yuppies find out that this is the right investment
[2:46:14.880 --> 2:46:18.000]  you're not going to be able to get gold and silver without paying a premium
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:28.160]  that's off the charts this is a great deal a fabulous deal 800-686-2237-800-686-2237-800
[2:46:28.160 --> 2:46:39.040]  686-2237 now is the time 800-686-2237 they're there till midnight
[2:46:39.040 --> 2:46:42.240]  tonight and you're probably not going to get this deal again tomorrow because
[2:46:42.240 --> 2:46:46.800]  ted's going to sell out of gold he bought at the 120 level with it now right up
[2:46:46.800 --> 2:46:53.120]  at $1,090 an ounce breaking all-time records by over $30
[2:46:53.120 --> 2:46:59.840]  this is incredible 800-686-2237 thank you ted yeah thanks a lot alex
[2:46:59.840 --> 2:47:03.040]  800-686-2237 don't be stupid folks

[3:01:40.240 --> 3:01:43.520]  just because of the technology that we have and everything like how much we
[3:01:43.520 --> 3:01:46.560]  really get held back this is unbelievable it's like
[3:01:46.560 --> 3:01:50.000]  it's like the people in power right they only give an effort like point one
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:53.280]  percent out of a hundred to try to like make life better and
[3:01:53.280 --> 3:01:56.640]  everything and it's not hard and they make it seem like it they make it seem
[3:01:56.640 --> 3:01:59.840]  like it's hard to help people and to feed people into
[3:01:59.840 --> 3:02:02.320]  to like build up the whole world and everything and
[3:02:02.320 --> 3:02:05.680]  and you also and they also have people confining to thinking that
[3:02:05.680 --> 3:02:09.040]  that urges urges what they call that urges where all the resources are you
[3:02:09.040 --> 3:02:12.160]  just look up in the sky and space and mars and all these other places and
[3:02:12.160 --> 3:02:15.360]  actually it's going all around the place it was in me in space
[3:02:15.360 --> 3:02:19.120]  right now gathering all the stuff people will not us for a little but you know
[3:02:19.120 --> 3:02:22.560]  what i'm saying like out there gathering resources that i hear you i hear you
[3:02:22.560 --> 3:02:25.440]  they're suppressing a lot of advanced technologies
[3:02:25.440 --> 3:02:28.320]  that's why they want the global government so they can control human
[3:02:28.320 --> 3:02:34.800]  destiny let's talk to uh mark and origan mark go ahead
[3:02:34.800 --> 3:02:40.320]  good day alex hey buddy hey alex i just asked uh charlie you know i really
[3:02:40.320 --> 3:02:44.160]  admire his spirit and his heart and his christianity i think it's all
[3:02:44.160 --> 3:02:47.760]  real and genuine and his patriotism it's right on the money but
[3:02:47.760 --> 3:02:51.440]  just to take a little bit of heart and the fact that when people talk
[3:02:51.440 --> 3:02:55.040]  when they communicate that's really the first step in my view
[3:02:55.040 --> 3:02:58.880]  toward implementing resistance uh of various types
[3:02:58.880 --> 3:03:02.240]  but i just want to talk about charles charles the earlier caller
[3:03:02.240 --> 3:03:06.960]  yes sir and i just wanted to mention that but alex you know as we heard in
[3:03:06.960 --> 3:03:12.800]  the cfr conference recording that you you gave us
[3:03:12.800 --> 3:03:17.200]  these cfr speakers we've been nervously chattering and chuckling because their
[3:03:17.200 --> 3:03:21.360]  plans to implement a world pandemic may be seriously faltering or
[3:03:21.360 --> 3:03:24.000]  perhaps because they know that around the world
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:28.160]  very lethal in various bio warfare viruses have recently been and are
[3:03:28.160 --> 3:03:32.320]  currently being intentionally released and now they've shown up in the ukraine
[3:03:32.320 --> 3:03:35.920]  with an Ebola type virus which is widespread there and seems to be quite
[3:03:35.920 --> 3:03:39.280]  a serious uh situation from what i've heard
[3:03:39.280 --> 3:03:43.920]  uh if this planned global flu pandemic doesn't succeed by the grace of god it
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:47.280]  will cost the illuminati dearly in their ability to
[3:03:47.280 --> 3:03:51.760]  implement their agenda because their true plans to destroy humanity are now
[3:03:51.760 --> 3:03:55.920]  fully known and exposed to a majority of the world's people alex and

[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:37.120]  i cannot overemphasize how outrageous it is that the new york times did a big
[3:08:37.120 --> 3:08:40.240]  exclusive telling the world what we've known for
[3:08:40.240 --> 3:08:44.720]  many years that al gore the roth child's the rockifellers
[3:08:44.720 --> 3:08:48.160]  and a handful of other elitists are standing to make hundreds of billions
[3:08:48.160 --> 3:08:50.400]  a year billions a year for al gore
[3:08:50.400 --> 3:08:54.240]  he owns the main carbon trading group that the un treaty says

[3:09:02.160 --> 3:09:05.920]  yesterday i'm gonna do more of this this week somewhere in my stack i had the
[3:09:05.920 --> 3:09:10.640]  ledger i created a glossary for this so we
[3:09:10.640 --> 3:09:13.360]  could go through it all and i was going to go back over today but i couldn't
[3:09:13.360 --> 3:09:15.280]  find the glossary this morning i may have bermus
[3:09:15.280 --> 3:09:19.040]  who made it make another one but but the i may just reread it though because i
[3:09:19.040 --> 3:09:21.520]  was looking over it again and found a bunch of other even worse stuff just
[3:09:21.520 --> 3:09:26.960]  randomly it's looking at the 200 plus pages all of this is going on
[3:09:26.960 --> 3:09:31.120]  and they have now passed it in the house it's out of the senate
[3:09:31.120 --> 3:09:34.960]  out of the senate committee to the full senate this is happening now
[3:09:34.960 --> 3:09:39.440]  so is the bank re-regulation to give this select group of goldman sacks
[3:09:39.440 --> 3:09:44.400]  and jp morgan chase the federal reserve private owners
[3:09:44.400 --> 3:09:49.280]  unlimited regulatory power of everyone else this on the heels
[3:09:49.280 --> 3:09:51.920]  we've got surprise guests on this coming up this week i'm just going to leave it
[3:09:51.920 --> 3:09:55.840]  at that this on the heels how goldman secretly
[3:09:55.840 --> 3:10:00.000]  bet on the u.s housing crash and how they engineered it
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:03.040]  this is in mclatchy newspapers hundreds of newspapers ran this
[3:10:03.040 --> 3:10:08.240]  this is a top financial investigative reporter firmly with the new york times
[3:10:08.240 --> 3:10:12.800]  greg gordon their own internal memos how they did it all by design
[3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:16.560]  to make their competition go bankrupt and the documents mentioned bare
[3:10:16.560 --> 3:10:19.920]  sterns who was actually solvent but goldman sacks
[3:10:19.920 --> 3:10:23.040]  former executives were the regulators that went and took over the other banks
[3:10:23.040 --> 3:10:28.320]  and brokerage firms this is unprecedented either we let the
[3:10:28.320 --> 3:10:32.000]  criminals continue to commit more crimes it emboldens them to do more
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:35.360]  or we wake up as a society ought at the fed arrest the bastards
[3:10:35.360 --> 3:10:38.960]  ron paul said last time he was here or it was two times ago he said yes we
[3:10:38.960 --> 3:10:41.760]  shouldn't have them indicted by state grand juries they clearly committed
[3:10:41.760 --> 3:10:44.240]  crimes but instead they've got all the trillions and
[3:10:44.240 --> 3:10:47.120]  fiat money they've raised off our taxpayer backs
[3:10:47.120 --> 3:10:51.520]  so the police just bow down to anybody in a suit
[3:10:51.520 --> 3:10:55.520]  i want to play this al gore clip this is al gore being discussed on morning joe
[3:10:55.520 --> 3:10:58.800]  where they reveal for the first time to the world
[3:10:58.800 --> 3:11:02.640]  though i cover it in the obama deception and fall the republic
[3:11:02.640 --> 3:11:08.000]  that he runs all the major carbon scams and al and al gore's got minions like
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:11.280]  obama who owns a large portion of one of the groups
[3:11:11.280 --> 3:11:14.720]  but the new york times says this is good he's being rewarded for his good work
[3:11:14.720 --> 3:11:21.520]  and yeah kinley did right up the plan in 1998 but kinley's not kin he's not bad
[3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:24.640]  got caught triple charge and people for energy prices
[3:11:24.640 --> 3:11:29.120]  in california and other states so more reasons to get fall the republic ladies
[3:11:29.120 --> 3:11:33.120]  and gentlemen people are now ready to see this
[3:11:33.120 --> 3:11:38.640]  here's al gore dual role as investor and advocate and they
[3:11:38.640 --> 3:11:43.120]  know to that a lot of the recent uh three point four billion dollars in
[3:11:43.120 --> 3:11:46.960]  energy department grants went to a company backed by your venture
[3:11:46.960 --> 3:11:49.680]  capital firm i'll ask the question that they put out
[3:11:49.680 --> 3:11:53.120]  there is there a conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of
[3:11:53.120 --> 3:11:56.560]  interest well no of course i invest according to my
[3:11:56.560 --> 3:12:00.960]  beliefs and and values and i encourage everybody to do

[3:12:05.840 --> 3:12:09.360]  policies for more than 30 years and of course i believe in it

[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:21.520]  and everything that's real and it exposes glen back
[3:13:21.520 --> 3:13:27.280]  camp fema info wars dot com stop screwing around people need to see it
[3:13:27.280 --> 3:13:31.040]  william lewis good to see you very franchi
[3:13:31.040 --> 3:13:34.160]  good to see you okay guys i i want to get into camp fema and the new one you're
[3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:38.720]  making and all this but first they have now marked up out of committee
[3:13:38.720 --> 3:13:42.400]  they could vote on this anytime the cap and trade bill
[3:13:42.400 --> 3:13:46.400]  uh that they admit takes over every facet of our lives ban chi moon
[3:13:46.400 --> 3:13:49.280]  last sunday's new york times eight days ago nine days ago
[3:13:49.280 --> 3:13:53.840]  said global governance and then simultaneously george soros's groups
[3:13:53.840 --> 3:13:56.800]  and all these other publications are listing me they're saying limbaugh is
[3:13:56.800 --> 3:14:01.120]  a fake and kind of a minion that they're saying they're scared of alex jones
[3:14:01.120 --> 3:14:04.320]  so i talk a lot about this in case they kill me or set me up or whatever people
[3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:07.920]  know that you know what really happened but
[3:14:07.920 --> 3:14:10.960]  they wouldn't be attacking little ol alex jones if i wouldn't tell them the
[3:14:10.960 --> 3:14:13.440]  truth and if they weren't scared and scared of the work
[3:14:13.440 --> 3:14:16.080]  restore the republic's doing scared of all the films you've made
[3:14:16.080 --> 3:14:18.560]  scared of other people learning they can do the same thing
[3:14:18.560 --> 3:14:21.360]  but what do you just think of how everything's happening right now the
[3:14:21.360 --> 3:14:25.360]  banking takeover the cap and trade the federalization hate crimes bill
[3:14:25.360 --> 3:14:30.640]  the open borders the gun grabbing the open i mean the the the plunging dollar
[3:14:30.640 --> 3:14:35.040]  gold up at one thousand ninety dollars an ounce i mean it's insane
[3:14:35.040 --> 3:14:38.560]  is uh this is the end game alex this is the last push
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:43.280]  over the finish line uh you know we you have been working so hard everyone
[3:14:43.280 --> 3:14:46.480]  in the war for information that has been working so hard
[3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:49.760]  with the internet with the push they are
[3:14:49.760 --> 3:14:52.720]  they have to push back and they have to complete their agenda
[3:14:52.720 --> 3:14:55.280]  and i think that they're just getting to a point where
[3:14:55.280 --> 3:14:59.920]  they they're they're kind of sick of of these small incremental steps they've
[3:14:59.920 --> 3:15:02.800]  been making all these years that they want to see
[3:15:02.800 --> 3:15:06.560]  that they want to live they have a Rockefeller's 94 yeah you they want to
[3:15:06.560 --> 3:15:11.040]  see the fruits of this and yours 87 they want it and they want it now
[3:15:11.040 --> 3:15:15.760]  exactly i mean this is we we really have watched over the past
[3:15:15.760 --> 3:15:19.600]  20 or so years all of the little bits and pieces of these things being put into
[3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:23.680]  place i mean it's not as if all of this just happened all at once
[3:15:23.680 --> 3:15:27.200]  we've been trying to warn the american people what's coming and they like
[3:15:27.200 --> 3:15:30.240]  sitting on their thumb you've predicted a lot of the things that have happened
[3:15:30.240 --> 3:15:33.360]  and now it's easy to it's easier for people to be able to
[3:15:33.360 --> 3:15:36.320]  put this little puzzle piece together and see the big picture and that's what
[3:15:36.320 --> 3:15:39.440]  we're seeing now their eyes are open people can see what's going on and
[3:15:39.440 --> 3:15:42.960]  now's the time that we have to to use to take action
[3:15:42.960 --> 3:15:47.280]  i mean i'm legitimately losing sleep i mean i know these people are eugenicists
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:50.240]  i know they put stuff in our water and brag about it in white house
[3:15:50.240 --> 3:15:57.280]  publications i know they're dangerous and people are finally figuring it out
[3:15:57.280 --> 3:16:00.560]  but i don't think they realize how dangerous
[3:16:00.560 --> 3:16:03.440]  realize how dangerous it is until they're in that hospital room
[3:16:03.440 --> 3:16:06.880]  and they've got a doctor bearing down on them with a shot that they're being
[3:16:06.880 --> 3:16:10.400]  forced to take you know it's it's going to come when
[3:16:10.400 --> 3:16:13.120]  the realization is going to come when they have to make that decision when the
[3:16:13.120 --> 3:16:16.400]  force hits them to hell austin federally is taking blood
[3:16:16.400 --> 3:16:19.760]  without warrants now i mean it's already bearing down go
[3:16:19.760 --> 3:16:22.720]  ahead well i mean that's what i'm saying you know
[3:16:22.720 --> 3:16:26.160]  when when it comes to a head when when the people have to make that decision at
[3:16:26.160 --> 3:16:29.680]  that moment is when they're going to react and that's our job is to explain
[3:16:29.680 --> 3:16:33.440]  to them the real ball game so when that decision finally faces them
[3:16:33.440 --> 3:16:37.360]  all the denial stripped away and we're dealing with
[3:16:37.360 --> 3:16:42.160]  the real deal absolutely it's it's what like i said when
[3:16:42.160 --> 3:16:46.240]  when they have to make that decision we are getting to them before that point
[3:16:46.240 --> 3:16:50.480]  so they can make that informed decision
[3:16:50.480 --> 3:16:54.480]  well the good news is people are waking up but i mean the problem is it took me
[3:16:54.480 --> 3:16:58.000]  on air 14 years six seven eight years to really get knowledge studying
[3:16:58.000 --> 3:17:01.520]  constantly so people are waking up but they don't have a master's degree in it
[3:17:01.520 --> 3:17:06.480]  yet that's why films are so important because they can give you a crash course
[3:17:06.480 --> 3:17:10.080]  all of your films gave me a crash course i i downloaded them all off of uh
[3:17:10.080 --> 3:17:13.360]  off the internet and i watched him in my house
[3:17:13.360 --> 3:17:17.280]  i woke up that day i saw probably every one of your movies within
[3:17:17.280 --> 3:17:21.040]  you know a whole day woke me up like that and i took action that's what charlie
[3:17:21.040 --> 3:17:24.480]  sheen said yeah milio estimate his brother came over and bought all my
[3:17:24.480 --> 3:17:27.440]  films and they stayed up all weekend drinking
[3:17:27.440 --> 3:17:31.120]  coffee and watched like 15 of them oh it changed my life and that's one
[3:17:31.120 --> 3:17:34.480]  that's when i said i have to make a decision i'm going to step up and do
[3:17:34.480 --> 3:17:37.600]  something and i'm going to get people together who have seen these films let's
[3:17:37.600 --> 3:17:41.120]  take action together it was because i saw your movies alex
[3:17:41.120 --> 3:17:43.920]  well you've done a great job with all your work it's another testament to that
[3:17:43.920 --> 3:17:46.480]  and again we're not bragging oh look at the work we've done
[3:17:46.480 --> 3:17:51.040]  the point is you can defeat these people if you take action
[3:17:51.040 --> 3:17:56.240]  if people will just get involved even if you wake one person up that's huge
[3:17:56.240 --> 3:17:59.040]  there's all different different ways to take action i mean it's
[3:17:59.040 --> 3:18:02.160]  you know taking action is showing a movie to a friend
[3:18:02.160 --> 3:18:06.000]  or someone who was not exposed to this information taking action
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:09.680]  is renting out a theater and showing it to 30 people at one time who haven't
[3:18:09.680 --> 3:18:12.640]  seen this information i mean there's so many different
[3:18:12.640 --> 3:18:15.600]  ways to get involved in your local government getting people elected as
[3:18:15.600 --> 3:18:18.320]  sheriffs i mean this thing can't succeed
[3:18:18.320 --> 3:18:23.520]  if it is exposed yeah and i mean you know people
[3:18:23.520 --> 3:18:26.160]  people may think that they're insignificant just like they think that
[3:18:26.160 --> 3:18:29.120]  their vote doesn't count which it doesn't in case you didn't know that
[3:18:29.120 --> 3:18:32.960]  but uh the point here is that they think that their action
[3:18:32.960 --> 3:18:36.720]  within this movement doesn't necessarily
[3:18:36.720 --> 3:18:40.320]  hold much weight you know it's hard for them to
[3:18:40.320 --> 3:18:44.480]  wait for a year or two years or three years to see the fruit of their labor
[3:18:44.480 --> 3:18:46.720]  because it takes a while for the information to get out takes a while to
[3:18:46.720 --> 3:18:51.520]  organize do something uh you know doing actions
[3:18:51.520 --> 3:18:54.560]  like that take time to plan and the globalists have all the money all the
[3:18:54.560 --> 3:18:57.120]  power all the resources all the systems everything
[3:18:57.120 --> 3:19:00.800]  and they're barely getting their agenda through while waking everybody up
[3:19:00.800 --> 3:19:04.480]  so then they sick north com on us thinking oh well that will stop them
[3:19:04.480 --> 3:19:07.360]  well that's that's one thing that makes me nervous is that i think we're really
[3:19:07.360 --> 3:19:11.440]  primed for another false flag event uh that could really
[3:19:11.440 --> 3:19:14.960]  bust the momentum that we have right now it's it's really a matter of time
[3:19:14.960 --> 3:19:18.240]  alex but we preemptively have exposed false flag
[3:19:18.240 --> 3:19:21.520]  terror and so it's hard for them to play that card but i agree they're gonna
[3:19:21.520 --> 3:19:24.880]  play it well yeah we we know the symptoms we know
[3:19:24.880 --> 3:19:28.640]  the signs we know what to look for so that we can we can raise those red flags
[3:19:28.640 --> 3:19:32.080]  before they happen hopefully and preempt anything and all these fake
[3:19:32.080 --> 3:19:34.800]  terror busts they've been doing which have turned out to be fake in every case
[3:19:34.800 --> 3:19:38.080]  that's a sign they are really getting ready to do it
[3:19:38.080 --> 3:19:43.040]  plus they've got their they need to look in the public's eyes they need to make
[3:19:43.040 --> 3:19:45.600]  the public feel like they're accomplishing something
[3:19:45.600 --> 3:19:48.800]  and that's why they pull these they're they're protecting us let's look at the
[3:19:48.800 --> 3:19:52.640]  architecture of the FEMA camps when we get back and how the false flag can be
[3:19:52.640 --> 3:19:55.760]  used whether it's financial or terror or
[3:19:55.760 --> 3:20:01.280]  biological what's coming up with our guests and warrior calls stay with us

[3:25:06.240 --> 3:25:11.360]  just a drill to test the federal assets their test isn't going well
[3:25:11.360 --> 3:25:14.880]  what do you see happening i see a lot of people saying i don't want to take the
[3:25:14.880 --> 3:25:18.880]  swine food vaccine uh you know i was watching uh news reports
[3:25:18.880 --> 3:25:23.200]  last night and some of the local stations are reporting
[3:25:23.200 --> 3:25:27.280]  you know local opinions and there are men and women and children saying i'm
[3:25:27.280 --> 3:25:30.320]  not going to take this untested vaccine and i don't want my children to take it
[3:25:30.320 --> 3:25:32.960]  so you know if that's the particular false flag
[3:25:32.960 --> 3:25:38.400]  operation that they choose to use for martial law then i i think it probably
[3:25:38.400 --> 3:25:42.160]  probably is going to work because there's enough people saying no right now
[3:25:42.160 --> 3:25:45.440]  where i think that they would be able to call it
[3:25:45.440 --> 3:25:48.880]  more than a national emergency i mean look at the um they called it a national
[3:25:48.880 --> 3:25:52.000]  emergency and they're also forcing kids to take it in schools
[3:25:52.000 --> 3:25:56.960]  illegally under orders that is bullish well have you looked into the uh
[3:25:56.960 --> 3:26:00.320]  under under a national emergency what regulations
[3:26:00.320 --> 3:26:05.360]  are suspended at hospitals for the national emergency and you know in
[3:26:05.360 --> 3:26:09.440]  medical emergency um it makes you wonder because i'm looking at
[3:26:09.440 --> 3:26:13.440]  news reports uh they're saying that they don't have to record your name or your
[3:26:13.440 --> 3:26:16.640]  information or take take as much information about you in order to
[3:26:16.640 --> 3:26:18.960]  process you through and get you the shot quicker
[3:26:18.960 --> 3:26:22.160]  so that kind of that opens up the door now to it well if they don't have to do
[3:26:22.160 --> 3:26:24.640]  that at hospitals maybe it's more convenient for us to send out people
[3:26:24.640 --> 3:26:28.080]  in suits and dyes to your door now they're gonna no that's already going on
[3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:30.240]  they're already sending letters to people saying your kids haven't been
[3:26:30.240 --> 3:26:33.600]  vaccinated and people are showing up saying i'm from the national health
[3:26:33.600 --> 3:26:37.920]  registry in weird scrubby uniforms we got calls about that the last three
[3:26:37.920 --> 3:26:40.720]  months and then then saw it in the news
[3:26:40.720 --> 3:26:43.680]  we know we could talk about the swine flu in the shop but you know what really
[3:26:43.680 --> 3:26:48.560]  concerns me is another type of a domestic terror attack
[3:26:48.560 --> 3:26:52.320]  like in oklahoma city where they blame uh you know
[3:26:52.320 --> 3:26:57.360]  constitution loving patriot because behind the scenes it's not al-qaeda
[3:26:57.360 --> 3:27:00.320]  they're scaring the cops with it is the patriots yeah and we're the main
[3:27:00.320 --> 3:27:04.240]  threat right and that and that's that's what's going to give them the excuse
[3:27:04.240 --> 3:27:08.400]  to round up people like myself people like you people like william people who
[3:27:08.400 --> 3:27:12.080]  are in this movement that's i mean that's my biggest concern
[3:27:12.080 --> 3:27:15.040]  but a lot of insiders say they don't want to do that they may just shut the
[3:27:15.040 --> 3:27:17.600]  web off what did you think two weeks ago when obama
[3:27:17.600 --> 3:27:21.440]  said yeah the nsa is taking over the web during emergencies like swine flu we
[3:27:21.440 --> 3:27:26.000]  may shut all websites off but government for your safety
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:28.880]  i mean that that's made that's openly being announced that's not for your
[3:27:28.880 --> 3:27:32.800]  safety but i mean exactly but i'm saying to have them
[3:27:32.800 --> 3:27:37.760]  openly breaking the ice see they're really getting ready for this
[3:27:37.760 --> 3:27:42.400]  well it's it's also is a test they they test to see how the public is going to
[3:27:42.400 --> 3:27:46.480]  respond to these actions and if they don't get if they don't get
[3:27:46.480 --> 3:27:49.360]  serious outcry or anything like that then they may hold back
[3:27:49.360 --> 3:27:52.800]  on how they how they react it's but then they've always got five or six other
[3:27:52.800 --> 3:27:57.040]  operations simultaneously running it's all aside i mean how does that even
[3:27:57.040 --> 3:28:00.640]  work i mean the deep the people believe that by shutting down the internet
[3:28:00.640 --> 3:28:04.080]  that that's really going to keep them safe i mean how would that apply to
[3:28:04.080 --> 3:28:06.400]  television and media stations you're gonna shut down the newspapers you're
[3:28:06.400 --> 3:28:10.160]  going to shut off everybody's tv and cable because there's still information
[3:28:10.160 --> 3:28:13.040]  coming out so who's this information is more credible apparently the information
[3:28:13.040 --> 3:28:14.800]  they're getting on the internet is a little more credible because they don't
[3:28:14.800 --> 3:28:17.520]  want you to get it well it'll be corporate control they they hand out the
[3:28:17.520 --> 3:28:20.800]  talking points to the mainstream media and say this is what you can report on
[3:28:20.800 --> 3:28:24.960]  they leave they leave and that's admitted now almost all movies and tv shows
[3:28:24.960 --> 3:28:29.200]  are completely written by the government
[3:28:29.760 --> 3:28:33.040]  fbi wrote most of the x-files or they were at least involved in
[3:28:33.040 --> 3:28:36.960]  i've had the star of the x-files dean haglund show up at my house do an
[3:28:36.960 --> 3:28:40.640]  interview and say yeah the cia told us what to produce
[3:28:40.640 --> 3:28:44.160]  and told us that lone gunman episode where the government hijacks a jet to
[3:28:44.160 --> 3:28:46.560]  fly the world trade center to blame it on afghanistan
[3:28:46.560 --> 3:28:50.880]  and uses a drill to make norad stand down
[3:28:51.120 --> 3:28:55.280]  who are these people why are they so sick that they like to see it on tv what
[3:28:55.280 --> 3:28:57.920]  they're going to do to us it's not that they like to see it on tv what they're
[3:28:57.920 --> 3:29:01.200]  what they're doing is is they're putting it out there so that when you
[3:29:01.200 --> 3:29:04.400]  talk to your audience and tell them it's one of these wild fascinating stories
[3:29:04.400 --> 3:29:06.720]  people are going to go hey man you've been watching two mosaic files you know
[3:29:06.720 --> 3:29:09.200]  what i probably get no exaggeration when i go
[3:29:09.200 --> 3:29:12.800]  five emails a day or more and i see it all over youtube comments going
[3:29:12.800 --> 3:29:18.240]  alex got all his news from metal gear solid i don't know what metal gear solid
[3:29:18.240 --> 3:29:22.160]  is supposedly some combat and yeah combat and i've seen the cover
[3:29:22.160 --> 3:29:25.920]  no that's them putting what's really going on in the game
[3:29:25.920 --> 3:29:30.080]  metal gear solid if is this
[3:29:30.080 --> 3:29:33.440]  what is it i guess it's some combat game it's a video game
[3:29:33.440 --> 3:29:38.240]  you run around shoot people what they say when i talk about population
[3:29:38.240 --> 3:29:40.880]  reduction that's a metal gear solid it's probably
[3:29:40.880 --> 3:29:44.480]  i never play the game but most of these games have a timeline a storyline and
[3:29:44.480 --> 3:29:47.680]  a whole when i talk about new world order they think i'm talking about the

[3:34:06.560 --> 3:34:09.760]  take calls with you guys that's a good point i should have thought of that
[3:34:09.760 --> 3:34:11.920]  earlier we're getting them hooked up good job guys
[3:34:11.920 --> 3:34:18.560]  um you know for three days i i've been meaning to play this clip as just an
[3:34:18.560 --> 3:34:22.000]  example of how they've got people into false reality and into
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:25.520]  simulations not just sports and all these mass game
[3:34:25.520 --> 3:34:30.320]  video games where millions of people sometimes millions sometimes hundreds of
[3:34:30.320 --> 3:34:33.600]  thousands and one of them is called eve and it's some
[3:34:33.600 --> 3:34:37.600]  intergalactic battle deal with humans from different corporations fighting
[3:34:37.600 --> 3:34:41.040]  each other and on this front page of the site i saw the ad on youtube it said
[3:34:41.040 --> 3:34:44.560]  your life will matter you actually affect this universe the
[3:34:44.560 --> 3:34:47.920]  things you do as one lone person of 300 000 playing
[3:34:47.920 --> 3:34:51.280]  you'll your life will matter so see they know that people
[3:34:51.280 --> 3:34:55.360]  want to have worth want to do right want to matter so they get you to join
[3:34:55.360 --> 3:34:58.160]  homeland security as a spy or they get you to think
[3:34:58.160 --> 3:35:01.440]  the little league's important when the whole country's going down or they get
[3:35:01.440 --> 3:35:05.840]  you involved in all these other petty things or these fake tribes like sports
[3:35:05.840 --> 3:35:09.200]  that's the control system but france you were making a point about the media and
[3:35:09.200 --> 3:35:12.800]  the culture well it it's it's all a
[3:35:12.800 --> 3:35:17.280]  scyop game they plant these seeds into your subconscious
[3:35:17.280 --> 3:35:21.120]  so like as we mentioned when you bring it up in public
[3:35:21.120 --> 3:35:25.200]  it it's easy to discredit but it also in your mind you've already heard it you've
[3:35:25.200 --> 3:35:27.920]  heard somewhere before and you're comfortable with it comfortable with it
[3:35:27.920 --> 3:35:32.560]  you you've been you've been acclimated acclimated desensitize is the word yes
[3:35:32.560 --> 3:35:36.720]  galactic you had the ground prepared
[3:35:36.720 --> 3:35:40.240]  i mean i watched transformers revenge the fallen
[3:35:40.240 --> 3:35:43.680]  uh... you saw less and the whole thing is tortures good taserings good burning
[3:35:43.680 --> 3:35:46.880]  people's eyes out to get answers is good the military is perfect
[3:35:46.880 --> 3:35:50.000]  you're being face-scan for your own safety total surveillance is good the
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:52.240]  family other than that that moves a total
[3:35:52.240 --> 3:35:55.200]  waste of time when i saw the movie there was a
[3:35:55.200 --> 3:35:58.640]  character in the film who had this huge computer the conspiracy theorists are
[3:35:58.640 --> 3:36:01.680]  crazy and bad i'm like wow those songs but the
[3:36:01.680 --> 3:36:06.480]  good guy tells them to lie for america right when that conspiracy theorists
[3:36:06.480 --> 3:36:09.600]  was was talking like wow he's saying a lot of things
[3:36:09.600 --> 3:36:13.280]  i've said before you know
[3:36:13.280 --> 3:36:17.040]  yeah but other than that it's a lot of transformers transforming from a car
[3:36:17.040 --> 3:36:20.560]  back into a transformer back into whatever and i mean most of the movie
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:23.200]  is nothing but special effects there's very little
[3:36:23.200 --> 3:36:27.280]  uh... there's no relationship but it's not bad when you're jogging was in the
[3:36:27.280 --> 3:36:30.240]  if i try to jog like down the street i can go like a mile
[3:36:30.240 --> 3:36:35.040]  but if i put on a movie and get into it i can get three miles four miles in
[3:36:35.040 --> 3:36:40.960]  kind of walk the last ten well the problem is no matter what i watch it's
[3:36:40.960 --> 3:36:44.240]  all propaganda then i can go pull it up and oh here's a defense department
[3:36:44.240 --> 3:36:48.880]  grant i mean it it they admit now it's fake news
[3:36:48.880 --> 3:36:52.880]  well you know it's not necessarily always the cia or some government agency
[3:36:52.880 --> 3:36:56.320]  so but big productions are yeah i i i do agree with you on
[3:36:56.320 --> 3:37:00.960]  on some of those but i think it's just so ingrained in our culture this is
[3:37:00.960 --> 3:37:03.680]  this is what we're being prepared for this is what people are thinking about
[3:37:03.680 --> 3:37:05.840]  it's on their minds it's in their conscience and they're writing about
[3:37:05.840 --> 3:37:09.600]  it sure we're driving that by exposing it and i've talked to a lot of directors
[3:37:09.600 --> 3:37:12.880]  but they may have four or five top stars in their film
[3:37:12.880 --> 3:37:15.760]  and the film costs nine million and they make fifteen million
[3:37:15.760 --> 3:37:20.080]  and it should be a big hit and i've talked to direct okay richard linklutter
[3:37:20.080 --> 3:37:24.640]  he's making uh... a scanner darkly the keanu reeves an owner rider woody
[3:37:24.640 --> 3:37:26.480]  harrelson a bunch of the people in an i'm in it
[3:37:26.480 --> 3:37:30.640]  i consulted on it and he had final cut but they went like a
[3:37:30.640 --> 3:37:34.400]  half million dollars over so then that was warner brothers
[3:37:34.400 --> 3:37:37.760]  came in and said okay you're gonna cut all these scenes
[3:37:37.760 --> 3:37:40.480]  you're gonna cut where the cop blows the guy's head off that's anti-law
[3:37:40.480 --> 3:37:44.160]  enforcement now let me tell you and linklutter fought him and kept it in
[3:37:44.160 --> 3:37:49.360]  because it was in the book but the point is is there is control
[3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:53.120]  there is control i know people in hollywood there is
[3:37:53.120 --> 3:37:56.080]  and i can tell you the behind the okay i knew when we were going to make loose
[3:37:56.080 --> 3:38:00.160]  change final cut with charlie sheen that mark cuban was going to put it out in
[3:38:00.160 --> 3:38:04.000]  theaters nationwide and he got threats and that and then other people's
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:09.840]  families a general who is the brother of a producer's wife
[3:38:09.840 --> 3:38:13.760]  called up and said your kids can get killed doing this you better not do it
[3:38:13.760 --> 3:38:18.320]  okay now i was asked shut up about that until
[3:38:18.320 --> 3:38:22.560]  it was in the news that the winehouse had the securities and exchange commission
[3:38:22.560 --> 3:38:26.480]  call uh... up mark cuban they also sent an email
[3:38:26.480 --> 3:38:29.840]  and said we're going to destroy you for this so he dropped out of it they still
[3:38:29.840 --> 3:38:33.360]  indicted him and then it came out it was he was indicted for no reason
[3:38:33.360 --> 3:38:36.400]  so that so the court case just got beaten two months ago
[3:38:36.400 --> 3:38:40.800]  this is now admitted and so when the new york times comes out
[3:38:40.800 --> 3:38:45.040]  and writes about it they're just threatening everyone
[3:38:45.040 --> 3:38:48.240]  but but but i agree with you a lot of it isn't control go ahead
[3:38:48.240 --> 3:38:51.920]  yeah i mean i wasn't necessarily trying to get off on that tangent i was just
[3:38:51.920 --> 3:38:55.600]  making the point that it is so already ingrained in our
[3:38:55.600 --> 3:38:59.120]  in our culture and our conscience that those are the types of things we want to
[3:38:59.120 --> 3:39:01.440]  see those are the types of things that people just
[3:39:01.440 --> 3:39:06.000]  write about and we're you know for whatever reason drawn to those things
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:08.640]  it's not that they're necessarily accurate or true
[3:39:08.640 --> 3:39:12.880]  but uh... i think we were fascinated with
[3:39:12.880 --> 3:39:16.880]  the end times and some of these uh... technologies and our own destruction
[3:39:16.880 --> 3:39:21.360]  exactly for whatever reason okay i i i i want to go to phone calls and a few
[3:39:21.360 --> 3:39:25.200]  other items but will you guys bring me that eve youtube clip in
[3:39:25.200 --> 3:39:29.840]  i printed this up i linked from a youtube ad to this
[3:39:29.840 --> 3:39:33.920]  but then youtube itself has the video it's called the butterfly effect
[3:39:33.920 --> 3:39:37.760]  thank you jaren and when you click through
[3:39:37.760 --> 3:39:41.520]  to the eve site it says your life will now
[3:39:41.520 --> 3:39:45.600]  matter you're going to be important this is where you fight this is where you're
[3:39:45.600 --> 3:39:49.440]  a man 300 000 people and and so you have people
[3:39:49.440 --> 3:39:53.040]  paying in the real world with these sim simulation games
[3:39:53.040 --> 3:39:57.760]  $50 000 for a Ferrari in the game to buy it from somebody because there's only
[3:39:57.760 --> 3:40:01.600]  so many ferrari's in the imaginary world and they're actually getting real
[3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:05.280]  dates in the real world out of this they're training you to be inserted into
[3:40:05.280 --> 3:40:08.880]  the matrix what people don't realize is that okay
[3:40:08.880 --> 3:40:12.320]  by playing these games you are projecting some type of
[3:40:12.320 --> 3:40:16.640]  desire to be needed or have that value when
[3:40:16.640 --> 3:40:20.880]  there's a real fight in the real world you're needed right now this is the real
[3:40:20.880 --> 3:40:26.960]  world here you you have worth now in the real world you're gonna play a game
[3:40:26.960 --> 3:40:30.000]  this is no exactly listen the social engineers
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:33.840]  i read documents from universities in the sixties in fact in the extras of in
[3:40:33.840 --> 3:40:36.720]  game on the in game 1.5 that's for prison planet
[3:40:36.720 --> 3:40:40.000]  tv viewers dr michael koffman the phd reads
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:43.040]  documents from universities saying we're going to have complex computer games
[3:40:43.040 --> 3:40:46.560]  we're going to have drugs we're going to have like a soma drug prozac
[3:40:46.560 --> 3:40:49.760]  everyone will do it will be sports we're going to build stadiums everywhere
[3:40:49.760 --> 3:40:53.040]  and of course that was written about 1900 as well by hd wells
[3:40:53.040 --> 3:40:57.920]  but but you're absolutely right they know they don't want you out really
[3:40:57.920 --> 3:41:02.080]  involved in the real world interfacing they want you fully being wireheaded
[3:41:02.080 --> 3:41:06.320]  into this cyber punks they want you on the couch they want you
[3:41:06.320 --> 3:41:09.440]  staring at a glassy box you know getting the 40
[3:41:09.440 --> 3:41:13.200]  40 megahertz frequency pumped in your head so that you just are
[3:41:13.200 --> 3:41:16.560]  droned out and you're sitting there doing nothing it's admitted that americans
[3:41:16.560 --> 3:41:20.640]  30 years ago had a higher wavelength the average american is in a
[3:41:20.640 --> 3:41:25.440]  dreamlike daydreams state they're zombies man that's why you can't talk to
[3:41:25.440 --> 3:41:31.360]  them and they've had psychological uh uh uh compulsions
[3:41:31.360 --> 3:41:34.720]  psychological suggestions this is admitted in planet that when they hear us
[3:41:34.720 --> 3:41:36.800]  talk about the new world order or global government getting involved they
[3:41:36.800 --> 3:41:41.040]  giggle and get a glassy that's their pre-program these these films
[3:41:41.040 --> 3:41:45.200]  that we've created here this is they go into the matrix indie program it's
[3:41:45.200 --> 3:41:48.880]  the red pills shock therapy it's like boom here it is and that's what your
[3:41:48.880 --> 3:41:52.000]  films did to me alexa said it put me up against the wall
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:55.440]  and made me you were a risk management guy for a big company making a lot of
[3:41:55.440 --> 3:41:57.840]  money and you got deprogrammed didn't you francy
[3:41:57.840 --> 3:42:01.520]  yes i did now look at you you've done well my
[3:42:01.520 --> 3:42:06.960]  apprentice thank you thank you lord jump
[3:42:06.960 --> 3:42:11.040]  we're gonna actually have a lord on sooner on the show um all right here's
[3:42:11.040 --> 3:42:14.000]  the folks now now here it talks about how you have value
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:18.320]  how you change things how you have power by one decision you make in the video
[3:42:18.320 --> 3:42:22.720]  game by blasting a pirate ship a pirate spaceship
[3:42:22.720 --> 3:42:25.920]  but when you read the game it's like your life is not going to have value
[3:42:25.920 --> 3:42:29.680]  and so i started looking at other simulation games it's all the same
[3:42:29.680 --> 3:42:33.600]  and you have millions of people in some cases with world of warcraft and all
[3:42:33.600 --> 3:42:36.720]  this we're and and all these marine core games
[3:42:36.720 --> 3:42:40.320]  which the pentagon admits their funding to then program you where they admitted
[3:42:40.320 --> 3:42:43.520]  that the simulators in the games are exactly the same as real predator
[3:42:43.520 --> 3:42:46.880]  drones so now you're blowing up real people on the ground
[3:42:46.880 --> 3:42:52.400]  i've played i've played uh games where i'm controlling a part of a
[3:42:52.400 --> 3:42:55.680]  an elite military squadron and there's people playing connected on the
[3:42:55.680 --> 3:42:58.880]  internet and in their own homes and they're all
[3:42:58.880 --> 3:43:01.840]  running around this virtual world no that's the game world of warcraft has
[3:43:01.840 --> 3:43:04.800]  three four million there's all these other games well call of duty or one of
[3:43:04.800 --> 3:43:07.760]  those games here where you torture people and kill them now and kill
[3:43:07.760 --> 3:43:11.520]  civilians and again it dehumanizes all these simulated murders that's why
[3:43:11.520 --> 3:43:14.160]  folks 50 years ago got scared of they saw a simulated
[3:43:14.160 --> 3:43:18.080]  murder on tv now they don't care if humans are dying but they see a dog die
[3:43:18.080 --> 3:43:22.080]  simulated people freak out because the dog still has value
[3:43:22.080 --> 3:43:26.400]  humans have been dehumanized here is the game trying to suck your soul
[3:43:26.400 --> 3:43:30.560]  the game is eve here's the game trying to suck your soul there's all these men
[3:43:30.560 --> 3:43:33.680]  who have addictions don't even have time with their wife or kids they quit their
[3:43:33.680 --> 3:43:36.800]  jobs to play these games because this is where they have value
[3:43:36.800 --> 3:43:41.200]  this is where they're a starship commander instead of in the real world
[3:43:41.200 --> 3:43:44.880]  with world government poisoning your water supply you're in the middle of a
[3:43:44.880 --> 3:43:48.160]  real operation we're fighting for our lives people are
[3:43:48.160 --> 3:43:51.920]  being killed and set up over this and oh no i don't want to be in the real
[3:43:51.920 --> 3:43:54.880]  world i want to fly around in my little fake spaceship or
[3:43:54.880 --> 3:43:58.400]  there's a big giant goblin world of warcraft
[3:43:58.400 --> 3:44:02.400]  you know i mean it's total crap here it is
[3:44:02.400 --> 3:44:11.280]  tea for violence crank it up in chaos theory there's a concept known as sensitive
[3:44:11.280 --> 3:44:17.440]  dependence on initial conditions most people call it the butterfly effect
[3:44:17.440 --> 3:44:21.920]  in eve we call it the sandbox
[3:44:22.560 --> 3:44:27.520]  let's say this is you one lone wolf flying a starship in the far reaches of
[3:44:27.520 --> 3:44:32.320]  space and in your travels you encounter this
[3:44:32.320 --> 3:44:36.960]  a defenseless mining barge under attack by pirates
[3:44:36.960 --> 3:44:40.000]  you have a split second to make a choice
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:43.360]  without your help the miner doesn't stand a chance
[3:44:43.360 --> 3:44:52.240]  you decide to be the hero and succeed in driving the raiders away
[3:44:52.960 --> 3:44:56.240]  the victim is thankful and in the conversation that follows
[3:44:56.240 --> 3:44:59.920]  a friendly gang that was on its way to help finally arrives
[3:44:59.920 --> 3:45:03.760]  grateful for your assistance they invite you to fly with them
[3:45:03.760 --> 3:45:08.640]  as it turns out that gang was on its way to regroup with more patrols
[3:45:08.640 --> 3:45:11.920]  who are all members of the same corporation
[3:45:11.920 --> 3:45:15.280]  which happens to be part of an alliance of corporations
[3:45:15.280 --> 3:45:19.200]  that is currently at war with another alliance
[3:45:19.200 --> 3:45:22.000]  whose patrols have just spotted the one you're flying with
[3:45:22.000 --> 3:45:24.480]  right now
[3:45:24.480 --> 3:45:30.320]  your decision to help that minor led to this moment
[3:45:30.320 --> 3:45:34.240]  an epic battle between thousands of players and the chance to share that
[3:45:34.240 --> 3:45:39.280]  experience with new friends that you might have for the rest of your life
[3:45:39.280 --> 3:45:42.960]  hundreds of thousands of people could hear about this battle
[3:45:42.960 --> 3:45:46.800]  why so many because it all happened in one universe
[3:45:46.800 --> 3:45:50.720]  not in separate realms just one big sandbox
[3:45:50.720 --> 3:45:56.080]  where the actions of one person can resonate throughout the entire game world
[3:45:57.120 --> 3:46:00.480]  in eve the choices you make shape the outcome of events
[3:46:00.480 --> 3:46:04.160]  you could have helped those pirates or just flown on by
[3:46:04.160 --> 3:46:07.040]  what matters most is that the experience was a merchant
[3:46:07.040 --> 3:46:10.880]  unscripted because in the sandbox all player actions
[3:46:10.880 --> 3:46:15.600]  no matter how subtle or bold always have an impact
[3:46:15.600 --> 3:46:19.120]  imagine what you could become a part of being in the right place
[3:46:19.120 --> 3:46:22.320]  at the right time could touch the lives of more than 300,000 people
[3:46:22.320 --> 3:46:26.800]  in 230 countries around the world
[3:46:26.800 --> 3:46:33.760]  welcome to eve online the universe is yours
[3:46:33.760 --> 3:46:37.680]  so this puts you into a false virtual reality where anybody who wants to be
[3:46:37.680 --> 3:46:40.960]  involved anybody that wants to help you're not in the
[3:46:40.960 --> 3:46:44.080]  real world as gore's dual role in spotlight goad
[3:46:44.080 --> 3:46:46.960]  for cause an investor how he's making all the money off
[3:46:46.960 --> 3:46:50.160]  enslaving you and your family they're poisoning your water supply to brain
[3:46:50.160 --> 3:46:53.040]  damage you it's admitted but you don't care about fighting
[3:46:53.040 --> 3:46:57.040]  someone poisoning you you want to go play starship commander
[3:46:57.040 --> 3:47:00.640]  when the elite actually plan to block off new technological development
[3:47:00.640 --> 3:47:05.200]  freeze us here one child policy exterminate most of us
[3:47:05.200 --> 3:47:08.960]  and then the elite they go to the real stars while we all sit are getting
[3:47:08.960 --> 3:47:12.880]  euthanized playing games going hooked into a matrix
[3:47:12.880 --> 3:47:16.800]  this is how we're being inserted into the matrix and that's what the matrix is
[3:47:16.800 --> 3:47:20.560]  is predictive programming how were the people inserted into the matrix
[3:47:20.560 --> 3:47:24.080]  they were offered a false reality when the guy says i don't want to remember
[3:47:24.080 --> 3:47:26.880]  nothing pay me off i want to be a movie star
[3:47:26.880 --> 3:47:30.560]  in the false reality well in these false realities you are a movie star
[3:47:30.560 --> 3:47:33.840]  they have games where you're a movie star with hundreds of thousands of other
[3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:40.000]  jackasses you know i don't play those games
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:43.600]  but i can understand the the appeal that people have because
[3:47:43.600 --> 3:47:45.600]  yeah you don't go out you're not supposed to go out and talk to your
[3:47:45.600 --> 3:47:48.560]  neighbors but you can go out and talk to your neighbors and fight the goblin fleet
[3:47:48.560 --> 3:47:51.040]  online online just don't go outside your house
[3:47:51.040 --> 3:47:53.440]  that's right because you know if you go outside your house and talk to them
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:47:57.680]  and you're you're uh perhaps going to transmit a little bit of truth
[3:47:57.680 --> 3:48:00.640]  from from one to the other but that's bad you don't do that but you can be a
[3:48:00.640 --> 3:48:04.640]  space commander yeah you can you can leak see a 25 foot goblin
[3:48:04.640 --> 3:48:08.160]  you can leak secrets to uh you'll be a spy for you know for some
[3:48:08.160 --> 3:48:12.720]  online game but you know don't whatever you do don't burn a copy of this dvd
[3:48:12.720 --> 3:48:15.680]  and and don't pass it off to your friends
[3:48:15.680 --> 3:48:19.440]  because that would be real yeah and we can't have that you might actually
[3:48:19.440 --> 3:48:22.640]  affect something in the real world you might actually have worth
[3:48:22.640 --> 3:48:26.080]  value you might actually have a soul let's talk to somebody who disagrees
[3:48:26.080 --> 3:48:29.680]  rick and the Bahamas go ahead rick
[3:48:31.280 --> 3:48:34.160]  yeah that i know i don't hear you it's it's very strange

[3:48:55.280 --> 3:49:00.800]  ted has on franks and sovereigns are always more expensive than you can get

[3:49:28.560 --> 3:49:32.320]  okay don't buy it from us fine great it's not a good deal

[3:49:46.720 --> 3:49:50.480]  have money you guys shouldn't have money to fly here
[3:49:50.480 --> 3:49:54.240]  to fly here to interview me it's okay for the government with taxes
[3:49:54.240 --> 3:49:57.840]  to take our money and use it against us but if we as entrepreneurs
[3:49:57.840 --> 3:50:00.960]  and it's free market people go out and say i've made a dvd

[3:50:11.360 --> 3:50:13.920]  i don't know about who can buy it but he bought a bunch but it was
[3:50:13.920 --> 3:50:16.080]  nine hundred dollars an ounce it could sell it for less now but i don't know
[3:50:16.080 --> 3:50:18.880]  what the hell you're talking about here's ted anderson's number you should
[3:50:18.880 --> 3:50:23.120]  buy it from him because he supports this network and because he's put radio ads

[3:50:26.320 --> 3:50:29.440]  and he gave over three hundred thousand dollars to ron paul for the ron paul
[3:50:29.440 --> 3:50:32.160]  air force and i don't want to hear oh ron paul lost

[3:50:35.440 --> 3:50:38.960]  enemy now you can call industry about something i cover
[3:50:38.960 --> 3:50:42.960]  here but just attacking us and our sponsors is a load of crap

[3:51:17.360 --> 3:51:21.440]  engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day
[3:51:21.440 --> 3:51:27.920]  think it can't happen here executive order 10 990 locks down all highways
[3:51:27.920 --> 3:51:32.800]  executive order 10 995 seizes control of all media outlets
