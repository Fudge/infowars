[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:40.440]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:42.040 --> 00:49.960]  if you thought that that was hardcore the secret arrest of Americans the
[00:49.960 --> 00:53.240]  endopausic commentatus military on the streets the whole world of battlefield
[00:53.240 --> 00:56.400]  if you thought all the announcements that they want to take your pension funds
[00:56.400 --> 00:59.920]  and put them into government control was bad if you thought any of this MF
[00:59.920 --> 01:04.480]  global stuff was bad this new piece of intel that came in the day that we
[01:04.480 --> 01:09.480]  researched all day and then put an article out just an hour or so ago on or
[01:09.480 --> 01:16.920]  less if you think that all of that was crazy this little piece was a
[01:16.920 --> 01:26.040]  crystallizer was a was a real indicator of just how serious things are and what
[01:26.040 --> 01:30.680]  am I talking about well there it is on screen right there exclusive government
[01:30.680 --> 01:37.240]  activating FEMA camps across America across the United States and of course
[01:37.240 --> 01:42.080]  that's that's that's that's quite a headline we have the emails we have the
[01:42.080 --> 01:47.400]  internal Halliburton KBR documents government defense and infrastructure
[01:47.400 --> 01:53.040]  not for public eyes restricted info sent to us by people in government I'll
[01:53.040 --> 01:58.920]  just leave it at that and it's got the five regions for the FEMA camps and it
[01:58.920 --> 02:04.920]  talks about barricades and barbed wire and and and armed guards and it says
[02:04.920 --> 02:10.040]  that they built the camps and that now they need to get ready to staff them and
[02:10.040 --> 02:14.920]  that they need to be ready within a 72-hour period for the guards and the
[02:14.920 --> 02:19.120]  and the and the and the people in the canteen with the food and the launderers
[02:19.120 --> 02:24.480]  and and just the whole nine yards there it is so they've been setting this up
[02:24.480 --> 02:29.640]  for more than two decades and now they started earlier in the year what back in
[02:29.640 --> 02:34.760]  February of this year advertising for upwards of a hundred thousand internments
[02:34.760 --> 02:39.320]  specialist here in the United States and now we're learning where they'll be at
[02:39.320 --> 02:43.120]  now this particular manning of the camp is your local sports stadium your local
[02:43.120 --> 02:49.280]  FEMA center these are 300 person camps to 1,000 person camps where they then
[02:49.280 --> 02:52.560]  interrogate you and go over things and then you're sent off to the 1 million
[02:52.560 --> 02:56.680]  man camps that we're gonna be breaking down but I tell you what I did a whole
[02:56.680 --> 03:02.600]  report on this oh thank you Marcos appreciate that water I've done a whole
[03:02.600 --> 03:09.440]  report on this is coming up but I suggest that you do what anybody with
[03:09.440 --> 03:12.840]  common sense and of course our listeners I think I have a little extra
[03:12.840 --> 03:17.960]  common sense I would call your friends and family right now and I would tell
[03:17.960 --> 03:23.800]  them to mosey on over to info wars calm so they can see this information and I
[03:23.800 --> 03:27.520]  would tell them to get this information because it's a lengthy article the
[03:27.520 --> 03:33.520]  Kurt Nemo and I put together this afternoon goes over all of it and it's
[03:33.520 --> 03:44.560]  got links to films and congressional hearings and admissions of all of this
[03:44.560 --> 03:52.480]  and so I want to challenge everybody to call their friends and their families
[03:52.480 --> 03:58.320]  now and realize that the new economy is to put tens of millions of people we
[03:58.320 --> 04:01.360]  already have the biggest person population in the world and in this in
[04:01.360 --> 04:09.160]  this archipelago this this this giant chain of facilities all over the
[04:09.160 --> 04:17.040]  country because it's all there all the government documents all the government
[04:17.040 --> 04:20.920]  admissions of civilian and mate labor camp program run by the army where
[04:20.920 --> 04:26.000]  they're at all the details down to how they're gonna break the families up and
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.800]  where the children go and the force inoculations and everything the
[04:31.800 --> 04:38.600]  executive orders the the legislation the congressional earnings but I tell you
[04:38.600 --> 04:42.320]  Glenn Beck used to giggle and laugh a couple years ago he really enjoyed that
[04:42.320 --> 04:46.720]  or for over a month he built it up that I think FEMA camps are real we've done
[04:46.720 --> 04:51.720]  an investigation and we're going to expose it on this day

[08:05.200 --> 08:09.800]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:11.560 --> 08:16.480]  we're live ladies and gentlemen it's the kickoff of another live worldwide
[08:16.480 --> 08:26.000]  broadcast it is Wednesday the seventh day of December 2011 it is the 70th
[08:26.000 --> 08:33.640]  anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack by the Imperial Japanese but we do have
[08:33.640 --> 08:36.520]  historian Webster Griffin terribly joining us he's got a book coming out
[08:36.520 --> 08:40.920]  it's not out yet on what really happened at Pearl Harbor it's a great example of
[08:40.920 --> 08:46.840]  a provocateur action it's not saying the imperial Japanese were good it's just
[08:46.840 --> 08:51.240]  that the US proxy forces were attacking them in China the flying tigers
[08:51.240 --> 08:57.880]  mercenaries the oil was cut off to Japan and then the purple and blue coat had
[08:57.880 --> 09:02.720]  been broken months before and the United States did know the attack was coming
[09:02.720 --> 09:07.680]  the Honolulu advertiser and I have a copy of it an actual copy from the
[09:07.680 --> 09:11.840]  archives did report a week before that the attack would come on the morning of
[09:11.840 --> 09:18.960]  December 7th Honolulu advertiser still in operation today and then they set up
[09:18.960 --> 09:23.920]  the generals and admirals and blamed them for it when the aircraft carriers
[09:23.920 --> 09:27.960]  were put out to safe area the old battleships allowed to be attacked not
[09:27.960 --> 09:32.920]  one not two not three not four but five this is my film master's of terror of
[09:32.920 --> 09:39.360]  the CNN article five Japanese midget subs
[09:39.480 --> 09:44.720]  were attacked in the process of trying to get there and launch attacks that
[09:44.720 --> 09:49.120]  morning in and around Pearl Harbor so so the military was ordered to stand down
[09:49.120 --> 09:55.360]  while submarines had already been engaged because one hand didn't know what
[09:55.360 --> 10:00.480]  the other am was doing in one case 20 miles away from Pearl Harbor and by
[10:00.480 --> 10:06.800]  the way this has always been not hidden in plain view whenever I went in years
[10:06.800 --> 10:10.080]  ago but but now it's giant now it's much bigger than it had been before it was
[10:10.080 --> 10:16.280]  just Admiral Nimitz's boyhood home in Fredericksburg Texas a hotel his
[10:16.280 --> 10:20.640]  family owned that was shaped like a ship with the prowl of a ship in a
[10:20.640 --> 10:26.000]  conning tower that was a Pacific War museum then when it became the
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.680]  official national Pacific War Museum the George H. W. Bush Museum they built a
[10:31.680 --> 10:37.480]  huge complex and it's a very world-class museum by the way I suggest you go
[10:37.480 --> 10:44.480]  there they've got actual decommissioned unarmed fat boys and little boy a bombs
[10:44.480 --> 10:50.080]  they I mean they've had it all there but hiding in plain view is one of the
[10:50.080 --> 10:56.360]  midget subs from Pearl Harbor attack so that was always hidden in plain view
[10:56.360 --> 11:01.200]  right there and they paraded the sub around the country as well and it was
[11:01.200 --> 11:04.620]  hidden in plain view in the original news articles you can read that that they
[11:04.620 --> 11:08.600]  sunk it like an hour before the attack began and still the stand-down order
[11:08.600 --> 11:15.520]  happened the Japanese are intercepted attacked and counter attacked trying to
[11:15.520 --> 11:20.200]  get their attack into the Pearl Harbor with subs basically suicide teams on
[11:20.200 --> 11:25.720]  midget subs pocket subs all right I'm now digressing because it's 70 years ago
[11:25.720 --> 11:31.080]  and it doesn't take away from the valor of our troops it just shows how Imperial
[11:31.080 --> 11:37.120]  Japanese evil US government evil Churchill evil and then you get it that
[11:37.120 --> 11:43.440]  whole lesser of evils discussion but it just shows the manipulation now when
[11:43.440 --> 11:47.400]  they couldn't get the North Vietnamese to attack in a 64 and they wanted to go
[11:47.400 --> 11:50.320]  ahead and kick off the official war that had just been advisors for four
[11:50.320 --> 11:55.240]  years they said our destroyers were attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin and then
[11:55.240 --> 11:57.960]  of course we were conspiracy theorists for decades talking about it until they
[11:57.960 --> 12:02.240]  declassified it on the 40th anniversary in 2004 and admitted it was all staged
[12:02.240 --> 12:06.320]  in a lie of course sailors had come back and said it was a fraud it had been in
[12:06.320 --> 12:11.000]  the San Diego Herald Tribune it was a fraud when this first officer came out
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.160]  and said it was a fraud but then that just became a rumor people read the news
[12:15.160 --> 12:19.600]  told people but years later well I don't know where I heard it but yeah they say
[12:19.600 --> 12:27.680]  that was staged that rumor that legend came from the admissions okay now I
[12:27.680 --> 12:32.720]  digress here but but it is interesting that after Pearl Harbor close to a
[12:32.720 --> 12:37.520]  hundred thousand Japanese who love the free market freedom of America and
[12:37.520 --> 12:40.960]  become wealthy on the West Coast some of them over here over a hundred years
[12:40.960 --> 12:45.160]  owning shipping companies fishing companies restaurants factories
[12:45.160 --> 12:51.360]  warehouses from Seattle down to San Diego but San Francisco was the big one
[12:51.360 --> 12:56.240]  they owned farms they owned great vineyards their land was taken and they
[12:56.240 --> 13:02.880]  were put into forced labor camps all over the West Coast and they have come I
[13:02.880 --> 13:07.080]  mean that'd be like if we had a war with Mexico arrest anybody who's got a
[13:07.080 --> 13:11.680]  Spanish surname or we ever had a war with England you know my name's Jones are
[13:11.680 --> 13:16.560]  you gonna arrest me if we had a war with Italy you know if your name is Monty
[13:16.560 --> 13:22.040]  do you get arrested or if your name is do you arrest somebody because their last
[13:22.040 --> 13:26.120]  name's Capone because somebody named Capone did something wrong once I mean
[13:26.120 --> 13:31.920]  it's this idea of a black person commits a crime so all black people are
[13:31.920 --> 13:37.680]  criminals basically now the reason I raise that is this news I've got for you
[13:37.680 --> 13:50.440]  is so big that I'm not even going to cover it right now it is so big that I
[13:50.440 --> 13:57.000]  am not even going to get into it until we start the next segment and I want to
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.640]  ask all of you to call your friends to call your family to call your neighbors
[14:02.640 --> 14:06.880]  to tell the person next to you if you're on your lunch break in the eastern
[14:06.880 --> 14:11.560]  time zone sitting there eating your lunch listening to the audio streams of
[14:11.560 --> 14:16.480]  info wars calm of this radio show or if you're watching us on prison planet TV
[14:16.480 --> 14:19.560]  on your lunch break or whatever the case is or if you're driving along in your
[14:19.560 --> 14:24.040]  squad car or if you're driving along in your taxi listening or if you're out on
[14:24.040 --> 14:27.720]  a ship people listen on cruise ships I've gotten phone calls from cruise ships
[14:27.720 --> 14:38.360]  or fishing ships wherever you are in the world or ships at sea I want you to
[14:38.360 --> 14:42.240]  tell the person next to you or to email your friends tell your Facebook friends
[14:42.240 --> 14:47.600]  anybody still uses Facebook kind of like my space no they they do I'm joking
[14:47.600 --> 14:56.320]  Facebook Twitter YouTube to tell everybody to tune in right now like I
[14:56.320 --> 15:00.560]  should put a Twitter out right now on my own real Alex Jones at Twitter and
[15:00.560 --> 15:05.480]  and to be able to tune in you know driving into work this morning I was
[15:05.480 --> 15:10.600]  thinking how do I properly address something this big how do I give people
[15:10.600 --> 15:17.000]  all the points of the compass how do I explain the serious magnitude of this
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.080]  and the fact that it is real and it is happening and only by exposing it can we
[15:23.080 --> 15:26.760]  back them off and then of course when it doesn't happen we'll be blamed on the
[15:26.760 --> 15:31.200]  road oh look it didn't happen and then of course we remember five years ago we
[15:31.200 --> 15:34.680]  said they're on the verge of attacking Iran they want to paint up speed boats
[15:34.680 --> 15:39.240]  like Iranian boats and stage attacks on the ships that's what our CIA sources
[15:39.240 --> 15:43.160]  are saying came out two years later that indeed Cheney had begun to paint up the
[15:43.160 --> 15:47.480]  boats and had told the Navy SEALs to do it but that higher ups even above him
[15:47.480 --> 15:54.360]  George Walker Bush had told him no and then they didn't get that attack launch
[15:54.360 --> 15:59.000]  and so oh look the attack never happened yeah yeah that's the point is that now
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.400]  the attacks are going on as we told you years ago but now it's admitted
[16:02.400 --> 16:08.160]  blowing up bases assassinating killing people drones dropping bombs huge bases
[16:08.160 --> 16:16.560]  being vaporized with what's clearly gigantic bombs huge craters and our
[16:16.560 --> 16:20.640]  media is like oh it's just some ammunition blew up and then now they're
[16:20.640 --> 16:25.560]  like okay we're blowing stuff up in Iran I mean it's all the war is already on
[16:25.560 --> 16:31.280]  it's like I asked way imagine your staff said when's the war gonna kick off and
[16:31.280 --> 16:34.320]  he goes it's already going on that's why the Iranians are now threatening to go
[16:34.320 --> 16:37.800]  ahead and block straight or moves they're now they don't like to look weak at the
[16:37.800 --> 16:40.520]  fact that they're taking attacks and now they're kind of tacitly admitting it as
[16:40.520 --> 16:44.520]  well and shame they may go ahead and block straight over me so it'll basically
[16:44.520 --> 16:51.120]  double oil prices all of this stuff is getting crazy you've got the Russians
[16:51.120 --> 16:59.360]  there in the Mediterranean delivering 76 hypersonic super high-tech giant cruise
[16:59.360 --> 17:08.240]  missiles surface to ship anti-ship weapons you've got US fleets that are
[17:08.240 --> 17:12.320]  missile cruisers that are carrying nukes building up all over the Gulf and all
[17:12.320 --> 17:17.400]  over the med the Mediterranean you've got the Pakistanis blocking the US route
[17:17.400 --> 17:20.760]  into Afghanistan the main supplier out the Russians blocking the other route
[17:20.760 --> 17:25.640]  the Pakistanis saying get out of these military bases the US is starting to
[17:25.640 --> 17:32.920]  comply the Russians are deploying weapons all over their borders it is now
[17:32.920 --> 17:36.920]  confirmed that the Soros crowd has been trying to destabilize and have hack
[17:36.920 --> 17:41.720]  attacks and things in Russia during that election again it's not that Putin and
[17:41.720 --> 17:46.560]  Medvedev are good either it's different groups of mafias and global gangster

[26:12.320 --> 26:17.000]  the legislation the congressional hearings this is not theories this is a
[26:17.000 --> 26:23.040]  hundred percent proven and they've had Glenn back come out a few years ago and
[26:23.040 --> 26:26.800]  for months say he was going to expose it and that it was real and then come out
[26:26.800 --> 26:34.000]  and show strongman trained facility that isn't a FEMA camp and a North Korean

[34:37.960 --> 34:42.160]  the concentration camp was invented on the Native Americans picked up by the
[34:42.160 --> 34:50.120]  British after that now they have gone for global financial domination by

[35:31.960 --> 35:37.680]  protection of the funds that's in their spiegel and associated press last night
[35:37.680 --> 35:41.920]  and it's the same banks when you hear about European banks that's US banks
[35:41.920 --> 35:48.160]  that's globalist banks that's the six big mega banks that we're dealing with now
[35:48.160 --> 35:53.040]  they've committed this takeover on the way up when the bubble was expanding they
[35:53.040 --> 35:56.640]  bought up the planet paid people off now they're holding the planet hostage
[35:56.640 --> 36:01.520]  saying give us unlimited trillions they call them bailouts the media then turns
[36:01.520 --> 36:04.920]  it around and acts like the public owes this money but they're really not even
[36:04.920 --> 36:09.880]  bailouts it's lies within lies it is direct global taxes to the six mega banks
[36:09.880 --> 36:15.080]  through their international consortiums of the IMF and World Bank and the US arm
[36:15.080 --> 36:19.640]  the Federal Reserve the World Bank is more of the US arm internationally of
[36:19.640 --> 36:23.160]  the Federal Reserve but it's all interconnected the IMF is mainly
[36:23.160 --> 36:28.000]  European and international as you go to the east this is ultra lateral
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.400]  Commission breakdown information it's all public the stuff they think you're
[36:31.400 --> 36:34.440]  stupid they think you don't care they hide it in plain view for anybody that
[36:34.440 --> 36:38.640]  cares their architecture their battle plans are all there because they think
[36:38.640 --> 36:43.720]  so little of you because they know you're designed to face a foreign enemy who
[36:43.720 --> 36:48.880]  wears a uniform and comes at you with a with a rifle and a bayonet not someone
[36:48.880 --> 36:53.120]  that comes at you in business suits okay so we're continuing with economic hitmen
[36:53.120 --> 36:56.960]  before I get into this huge FEMA camp news you have to understand why it's
[36:56.960 --> 37:03.520]  happening they are now admitting that the private banks have dominated Europe
[37:03.520 --> 37:10.080]  through fraud our media bought and paid for by them hails it as as as cutesy they
[37:10.080 --> 37:13.640]  sit there and giggle about it on Bloomberg TV and radio they giggle about
[37:13.640 --> 37:18.880]  it on CNBC oh how it's undemocratic how Europe won't never be able to vote its
[37:18.880 --> 37:22.680]  way out of this now getting rid of all of their sovereignty how the euro was
[37:22.680 --> 37:28.240]  only the receivership arm now they're gonna implode that scaffolding and bring
[37:28.240 --> 37:32.560]  it fully under banker control with value-added taxes sales taxes carbon
[37:32.560 --> 37:37.920]  taxes family taxes total social control shutting off economies for social
[37:37.920 --> 37:44.240]  engineering they want you dependent period global plantation now patriots
[37:44.240 --> 37:51.520]  discovered this in the 1950s and 60s namely Joseph McCarthy who was demonized
[37:51.520 --> 37:56.800]  and who did have problems like anybody and who did they allowed him to
[37:56.800 --> 38:01.160]  persecute innocent people because that created a new form of censorship in the
[38:01.160 --> 38:04.840]  name of countering communism which actually brought us into authoritarianism
[38:04.840 --> 38:08.120]  in the name of fighting another authoritarianism it was a Hougalian
[38:08.120 --> 38:12.200]  dialectic of problem-reaction solution but the minute he discovered I'm getting
[38:12.200 --> 38:16.000]  chills right now this is even in the New York Times and Moscow Times now the
[38:16.000 --> 38:21.120]  minute he discovered that the Pentagon was funding the Russians and that the
[38:21.120 --> 38:25.640]  Pentagon and Armand Hammer and the Rothschilds and Rockefellers were
[38:25.640 --> 38:30.920]  running at all so that Russia had a pretext to clamp down and so we had a
[38:30.920 --> 38:35.360]  pretext to be clamped down on but that it was all a huge Hougalian dialectic of
[38:35.360 --> 38:40.240]  full-spectrum dominance the minute he said that they destroyed him in the
[38:40.240 --> 38:44.400]  hearings they said you're saying the army's doing this now in hindsight they've
[38:44.400 --> 38:49.720]  declassified the GRU and HGB files five years ago the international headlines
[38:49.720 --> 38:58.000]  McCarthy was right it was all true but again it's cutesy it's all very cutesy
[38:58.840 --> 39:04.720]  but because of people warning the population and understanding it
[39:04.720 --> 39:09.040]  understanding that mega rich want socialism and communism and
[39:09.040 --> 39:13.600]  collectivism and communitarianism and agenda 21 for the general public to make
[39:13.600 --> 39:18.000]  us dependent on them they sit international and are exempt from that
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.320]  and are exempt from taxes as you see then they lobby for more taxes telling the
[39:23.320 --> 39:27.240]  poor you'll get wealth redistribution with all this conspicuous consumption
[39:27.240 --> 39:30.960]  that they see and are looking their lips for if you get rid of the middle class
[39:30.960 --> 39:34.800]  who the poor believe is rich they're actually the only group still employing
[39:34.800 --> 39:40.040]  the poor still buying things from them that service economy must be eradicated
[39:40.040 --> 39:45.960]  and it is this is a philosophy of total degradation now I will give you the top
[39:45.960 --> 39:53.320]  news my point is the globalists have been very arrogant and very out in the
[39:53.320 --> 39:57.560]  open in their white papers about vaccines that sterilize fluoride in the
[39:57.560 --> 40:05.240]  water to increase cancer lower fertility dumb everybody down they have all been
[40:05.240 --> 40:10.400]  very honest about this because they have total contempt for you total contempt
[40:10.400 --> 40:14.640]  that you're not going to go read that because it's not you know the latest to
[40:14.640 --> 40:19.640]  sitcom or drama or a woman's show or men's soap opera you know that you
[40:19.640 --> 40:28.680]  basically football they think that you're you deserve it and so they just hide
[40:28.680 --> 40:33.880]  it in plain view but because the globalists know that when they bring in
[40:33.880 --> 40:37.200]  this total collapse people are gonna get angry there's gonna be a move to
[40:37.200 --> 40:41.240]  restore the Republic there's gonna be a move to to to to unroot them that have
[40:41.240 --> 40:45.680]  engineered this publicly that they have built FEMA camps they have continuity
[40:45.680 --> 40:50.040]  of government programs they have mass arrest programs they've tried to train
[40:50.040 --> 40:54.200]  the military and police to go along with this they federalize things they've put
[40:54.200 --> 40:59.120]  in the surveillance script they've got different ways they can roll it out a
[40:59.120 --> 41:03.760]  stage bio attack a stage chemical attack other terror attacks mass shootings
[41:03.760 --> 41:09.600]  blamed on domestic groups they've got a whole constellation of systems they can
[41:09.600 --> 41:16.000]  use to psi op people into going along with this because they've committed these
[41:16.000 --> 41:21.280]  crimes they've committed this economic espionage this economic invasion this
[41:21.280 --> 41:26.120]  this this economic program of globalization deindustrialization and
[41:26.120 --> 41:30.280]  all of it so they can consolidate all power and leave no enemy standing they
[41:30.280 --> 41:34.840]  see anybody with a business anybody independent as the enemy so scorched
[41:34.840 --> 41:40.920]  earth policy of kill the buffalo let the red man starve to scorched earth policy
[41:40.920 --> 41:51.840]  research what that is now we have checkmated them at many levels because we
[41:51.840 --> 41:56.000]  saw their program warned people got laughed at we didn't care now as it's
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.000]  beginning to come true the credibility is rising but that by no means means
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.680]  we're winning the war for liberty it just means we're in the fight and if
[42:05.680 --> 42:08.760]  you're in the fight you've always got a chance to win you've got to know your
[42:08.760 --> 42:11.800]  enemy you've got to be motivated you've got to do the research you've got to be
[42:11.800 --> 42:19.000]  focused and you've got to be dedicated if we're gonna beat these people but we
[42:19.000 --> 42:23.600]  got the jump on them they got the original jump on us as the offensive
[42:23.600 --> 42:27.760]  attackers but because it was a covert operation they were running against us
[42:27.760 --> 42:32.040]  many people recognized it mainly in government in Congress and the
[42:32.040 --> 42:35.680]  military and warned people the old days they'd kill you for this now they
[42:35.680 --> 42:39.080]  failed containing it the information's out there so they just want to head and
[42:39.080 --> 42:43.960]  have have have have gone forward with a program of just letting it all be out in
[42:43.960 --> 42:48.800]  the open and trying to hide it in plain view so because they're aware that we're
[42:48.800 --> 42:51.920]  awake to them and that the Federal Reserve is now the enemy and as
[42:51.920 --> 42:54.960]  Brzezinski said last year the whole world is for the first time awake
[42:54.960 --> 43:00.240]  politically and recognizing the puppet masters not the puppets they're just
[43:00.240 --> 43:04.640]  going ahead and flaunting it now yeah we'll secretly arrest you yeah we'll use
[43:04.640 --> 43:09.200]  the military on the streets with the NDAA notice more and more shoes are
[43:09.200 --> 43:12.600]  dropping more and more red flags are going up more and more balloons are
[43:12.600 --> 43:17.800]  going up the system is testing this right now right as the world economy
[43:17.800 --> 43:21.440]  begins to accelerate its implosion right as the world government's announced
[43:21.440 --> 43:28.880]  I'm getting non-stop chills here I mean we are entering history right now and
[43:28.880 --> 43:32.960]  only by getting the word out about this information only by being strong enough
[43:32.960 --> 43:36.960]  to admit what's happening and to speak out to others and to say no when you're
[43:36.960 --> 43:40.080]  in the military and if you're a police officer are we going to be able to turn
[43:40.080 --> 43:45.120]  this around America has been seized by very nasty technocratic social
[43:45.120 --> 43:51.200]  engineers who think of us as trash and who are totally bloodthirsty and
[43:51.200 --> 43:57.320]  ruthless now why am I so freaked out we know under Rex 84 they began to build
[43:57.320 --> 44:02.000]  FEMA camps in the 80s even before that they started them under Eisenhower that
[44:02.000 --> 44:05.840]  was declassified he spoke out against it and said I'm not doing this and he was
[44:05.840 --> 44:10.880]  an establishment guy but not a total you know tyrant he said beware of the
[44:10.880 --> 44:14.720]  military industrial complex beware of their domestic takeover beware the
[44:14.720 --> 44:19.240]  technological elite that controls it that's the full quote we've played the
[44:19.240 --> 44:22.680]  video here film you always hear about millet beware of the military industrial
[44:22.680 --> 44:28.760]  complex he said that's controlled by a technological a new technological elite
[44:28.760 --> 44:35.720]  he was brought in on all this eugenics stuff in polio cancer viruses the polio
[44:35.720 --> 44:39.800]  vaccine all of this that we now know the president was shown that that's why he's
[44:39.800 --> 44:43.720]  so freaked out when he gives that speech something slams adore slams and you see
[44:43.720 --> 44:48.560]  him jump like he's about to be killed he knew what he was doing there going off
[44:48.560 --> 44:53.680]  script warning people because he had a conscience as an old man he'd already
[44:53.680 --> 44:57.920]  gotten all the power he wasn't pure evil and so he was thinking I did all this
[44:57.920 --> 45:04.000]  and now I'm here and future generations are going to be committed to this so
[45:04.000 --> 45:09.440]  because we saw the warnings and because people like McCarthy you can look at him
[45:09.440 --> 45:14.680]  in hindsight and laugh at him think of what he knew then he did we didn't know
[45:14.680 --> 45:22.160]  as much then 60 70 years ago because of that we got a chance to make some
[45:22.160 --> 45:26.240]  preparations for the final phases of this we knew because of the creeping
[45:26.240 --> 45:33.320]  death formation of it that it would take time for it to manifest to where the
[45:33.320 --> 45:37.320]  sheep would finally see it so we had to keep telling him what was going to come
[45:37.320 --> 45:42.720]  next so that when it did uncloke to fire people could recognize the enemy and
[45:42.720 --> 45:47.320]  would be at the switch to fire back at it and it's when the globalist emerge
[45:47.320 --> 45:52.360]  uncloak when they finally make their big move is that that's when we're in the
[45:52.360 --> 45:55.160]  greatest danger and they're in the greatest danger and they're uncloaked
[45:55.160 --> 45:59.800]  right now and if they can acclimate us to accept it and well some people go to
[45:59.800 --> 46:02.840]  the camp you know they're troublemakers we got to do we do they're in the
[46:02.840 --> 46:08.840]  depression and the Iran war if we don't put maximum effort in now that they're
[46:08.840 --> 46:13.520]  uncloaked they're gonna complete the takeover and then everything that follows
[46:13.520 --> 46:18.600]  and all people that say well I don't have anything to hide I haven't done
[46:18.600 --> 46:22.000]  anything wrong so what do we have a tyranny the tyranny wants your labor
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.840]  wants your money wants your life it doesn't matter if you serve them or not
[46:27.840 --> 46:31.160]  it doesn't matter if you go along with them don't you get it you don't make a
[46:31.160 --> 46:35.560]  deal with these people you can't that's the big con game for police and
[46:35.560 --> 46:39.960]  military you cops call me and say well I've chosen a side and you do need to
[46:39.960 --> 46:45.720]  choose a side but it's a spiritual decision but but but if you look at it
[46:45.720 --> 46:50.080]  and have discernment there was no choice of course you say no to evil because
[46:50.080 --> 46:55.080]  that's the big trick you can't make a deal with it so the criminals that have
[46:55.080 --> 46:59.040]  taken over our know that we're gonna get angry and try to bring them to justice
[46:59.040 --> 47:01.920]  and get our government back and they're not gonna let that happen they're gonna
[47:01.920 --> 47:05.520]  try to bring in a hardcore tyranny people who don't think it can't happen
[47:05.520 --> 47:08.960]  here look at how much has already happened well I'm telling you it is all
[47:08.960 --> 47:12.960]  going to happen so it's time to get right with God and then it's time to take
[47:12.960 --> 47:18.720]  action now remember this article from earlier in the year internment resettlement
[47:18.720 --> 47:23.560]  special 31 e go army.com where they wanted to hire upwards of a hundred
[47:23.560 --> 47:29.240]  thousand for in the US and overseas jail guards and people to be internment and
[47:29.240 --> 47:33.280]  resettlement specialist including here in the United States and that's on the
[47:33.280 --> 47:38.760]  army website now let's fast forward they had a major camp in former base
[47:38.760 --> 47:45.040]  closure refurbishment three hundred eighty six million dollars market watch
[47:45.040 --> 47:49.240]  of the Wall Street Journal reported for KBR Kellogg Brown and Root division of
[47:49.240 --> 47:55.040]  Halliburton to build three one million man camps and former military bases now
[47:55.040 --> 48:00.760]  they've built over 500 in the states this is all documented substations to
[48:00.760 --> 48:05.200]  round up three hundred to a thousand at a time and then to interrogate debrief
[48:05.200 --> 48:10.440]  decide if you're released or sent to the larger center or sent to a black site
[48:10.440 --> 48:14.600]  for execution of course the locals don't know that but we've gotten internal
[48:14.600 --> 48:17.880]  documents from random now they admit there there is kill orders as well and
[48:17.880 --> 48:21.240]  they've said we'll kill citizens the White House said that last week and they
[48:21.240 --> 48:25.400]  got kill teams ready so it's good to know this up front just because if they
[48:25.400 --> 48:29.280]  launch it you're going to a death camp many of you so there's no point you're
[48:29.280 --> 48:32.480]  dead already you got to resist you understand that okay don't go like the
[48:32.480 --> 48:35.200]  poor Jews and run down in the pit with the women with the babies and their
[48:35.200 --> 48:39.120]  arms and the Nazi just shoot it with back of the head okay just understand
[48:39.120 --> 48:42.920]  as we go to this red level you got to understand we tried to avert this as
[48:42.920 --> 48:49.160]  best we could and we may still do it but it's real and it's here and it's not
[48:49.160 --> 48:53.000]  they'll probably beta test on Arabs and then some militias and then it's gonna be
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.360]  for everybody they always roll it out on a minority first now continuing
[48:58.360 --> 49:02.440]  exclusive government activating FEMA camps across the US so they built all
[49:02.440 --> 49:07.960]  these things and it expanded them in the last few decades now they're putting
[49:07.960 --> 49:14.560]  out the contracts in all 50 states for in some cases more than 30 camps per
[49:14.560 --> 49:20.040]  state just as processing centers checkpoints at the highway puts you in
[49:20.040 --> 49:25.000]  army trucks take you to the facility then you're shipped off to another
[49:25.000 --> 49:30.320]  facility you're desold you're taken and they're ready brigade homeland
[49:30.320 --> 49:39.680]  Northcom foreign troops foreign assets mercenaries it's on info wars commas
[49:39.680 --> 49:44.680]  received a document originating from Halliburton subsidiary KBR that provides
[49:44.680 --> 49:50.160]  details of a push and it's a hidden KBR link it's have a link to it it was a
[49:50.160 --> 49:54.440]  hidden private link but it's on their site right now to outfit FEMA and US
[49:54.440 --> 49:58.400]  army camps around the United States entitled project overview and
[49:58.400 --> 50:04.520]  anticipated project requirements and it goes on to say they need fences and
[50:04.520 --> 50:08.600]  barricades and it goes into all the security officers and things laundry
[50:08.600 --> 50:15.480]  food everything within 72 hours notice at hundreds of locations they're now
[50:15.480 --> 50:24.560]  going to government fund in the billions of dollars the actual manning of the
[50:24.560 --> 50:32.120]  camp so the camps are going live they have got operatives in every city ready
[50:32.120 --> 50:35.760]  to go live with the camps with private contractors running it getting their
[50:35.760 --> 50:41.440]  20 pieces silver 30 pieces silver and with local government all the systems
[50:41.440 --> 50:46.600]  ready for the economic collapse the riots all of it they're gonna let all
[50:46.600 --> 50:50.440]  that roll out then let the public beg for it and they're going to as we learn
[50:50.440 --> 50:54.040]  from the emergency centers establishment act put the homeless in them first

[50:58.520 --> 51:03.840]  rolled out now we all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most

[54:06.600 --> 54:13.800]  lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[54:13.800 --> 54:22.040]  now from congressional hearings and other pieces of information we had we
[54:22.040 --> 54:26.040]  were able to piece together exactly how the FEMA camps were set up the old
[54:26.040 --> 54:30.920]  military bases the drills the insider information and we knew that they would
[54:30.920 --> 54:34.360]  try to roll it out as the implode of the economy as a place for all the
[54:34.360 --> 54:38.800]  homeless to go all those that have been kicked out of their houses and the new
[54:38.800 --> 54:44.040]  giant criminal populations and if Mexico collapses they admit plans to put
[54:44.040 --> 54:48.640]  millions of people in these facilities on the borders so it's a constellation
[54:48.640 --> 54:55.600]  of different overlaying cover stories or a cocktail of different things and in
[54:55.600 --> 54:58.480]  Nazi Germany it was first well you're not allowed to have your businesses in
[54:58.480 --> 55:02.120]  this area because you're one of these groups that we have to protect from the
[55:02.120 --> 55:06.000]  public and now you can't even have your business and now you're going to live in
[55:06.000 --> 55:09.560]  a ghetto and then the Nazis would go in and pick up every day whoever they
[55:09.560 --> 55:14.400]  wanted on a list at checkpoints and then oh you're going to a camp where you
[55:14.400 --> 55:18.160]  can be kept safe and you're going to work for a living and they were really
[55:18.160 --> 55:23.320]  death camps so see it was always the cover story was always the hope that
[55:23.320 --> 55:26.920]  everything was going to be alright and the Soviets did the same thing and they
[55:26.920 --> 55:30.240]  killed even more people in these camps the Nazis did because they went on for
[55:30.240 --> 55:35.080]  decades and decades longer and that's how they're rolling them out you read the
[55:35.080 --> 55:41.520]  Emergency Centers Establishment Act and it explains it to you and if they
[55:41.520 --> 55:44.240]  roll it out it'll be on the news oh look at the hundreds of thousands of
[55:44.240 --> 55:48.160]  homeless at this facility oh now there are some troublemakers who get locked up
[55:48.160 --> 55:52.280]  and they do have to search people and there are fences around them but you
[55:52.280 --> 55:55.960]  know it's for everybody's safety and oh there were some more domestic attacks we
[55:55.960 --> 56:01.280]  do have some camps for criminals and an extremist and in this article we have
[56:01.280 --> 56:06.560]  the new government documents where they say protesting period is terrorism they
[56:06.560 --> 56:09.720]  tell the cops the First Amendment is terrorism I have links to it in the
[56:09.720 --> 56:14.800]  article and so this is the attitude they're not putting telescreens up for
[56:14.800 --> 56:20.720]  wanted people everywhere and giant signs and FEMA national break-ins over radio
[56:20.720 --> 56:25.040]  and TV for the first time activated with total federal control because they're
[56:25.040 --> 56:32.600]  nice people and this is such a big deal that they have now come out in the news
[56:32.600 --> 56:36.800]  well this information was leaked to us so we're breaking it but but but that
[56:36.800 --> 56:43.120]  they are now activating and saying you've got to be on 72 hour standby we're
[56:43.120 --> 56:48.200]  gonna pay you to be ready to man the camps and they're paid basically half
[56:48.200 --> 56:53.920]  the money just to sit there and be ready and then even more once they man the
[56:53.920 --> 56:58.280]  camps and it's a giant business and Halliburton of course that's been caught
[56:58.280 --> 57:01.960]  running slave camps Chicago Tribune reported on that all over the world
[57:01.960 --> 57:06.080]  and they just grab locals Philippines you name it just put them in camps they
[57:06.080 --> 57:11.520]  can bricks aluminum you name it I mean this is literally a devilish group
[57:11.520 --> 57:16.880]  Halliburton and KBR and they've been chosen to be the master camp operators
[57:16.880 --> 57:22.560]  and they help set up camps in Iraq and Afghanistan and they're setting up that
[57:22.560 --> 57:27.320]  same system they got giant armies of military that are now cops that are
[57:27.320 --> 57:32.440]  here ready to do it ready to retina scanning at that checkpoint check who
[57:32.440 --> 57:37.080]  you really are ready to load you on that truck okay did you put your hands
[57:37.080 --> 57:40.560]  behind your back we're gonna send you in for some questioning and then they don't
[57:40.560 --> 57:44.400]  have to worry I don't know where these going just get on down the road this is
[57:44.400 --> 57:48.240]  the government we have and if you don't think they're not planning it think again
[57:48.240 --> 57:51.520]  they've always hated America the globalists have always wanted to take
[57:51.520 --> 57:55.720]  us down and it's on so we need to get these articles out to everybody
[57:55.720 --> 58:00.720]  detention camp order follows preparations for civil unrest all admitted KBR seek
[58:00.720 --> 58:04.800]  subcontractors to outfit emergency environment centers and we have the
[58:04.800 --> 58:08.400]  other one exclusive government activating FEMA camps across us this is so
[58:08.400 --> 58:12.080]  important I'm gonna spend about 15 minutes with Tarpley on this subject when
[58:12.080 --> 58:15.760]  we come back because he's an expert on as well before we get into Pearl Harbor
[58:15.760 --> 58:19.400]  70 years later then chief Ardee Savetta Austin police chief is gonna be in
[58:19.400 --> 58:23.720]  the studio by the way over here where this is gonna end on Christmas and if

[58:52.920 --> 58:57.600]  fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not
[58:57.600 --> 59:02.440]  relive history as it finishing off this agenda that we pulling the rug from
[59:02.440 --> 59:06.400]  underneath the Americans at home I've determined this influence on our
[59:06.400 --> 59:10.640]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[59:10.640 --> 59:15.880]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[59:15.880 --> 59:20.440]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[59:20.440 --> 59:24.840]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[59:24.840 --> 59:28.600]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[59:28.600 --> 59:32.520]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[59:32.520 --> 59:38.040]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[59:38.040 --> 59:43.760]  the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com
[59:43.760 --> 59:50.760]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV
[59:50.760 --> 01:00:05.960]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:13.280]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:22.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:28.000]  all right the Webster Griffin Tarpley who's a historian and also economist
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  frequent contributor to the show has been researching for years and writing a
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.600]  book that it now yet on Pearl Harbor at 70th anniversary and we're going to
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:41.360]  speak coming up in about 20 minutes with Webster about Pearl Harbor then I'm
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.880]  going to open the phone up for World War two vets now there's not many of those
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:50.720]  great men and women some of them left but if you can get involved on air and
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:54.640]  open the phones up just for you after Tarpley gets into some of the basics of
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:00.760]  Pearl Harbor and parallels that we see today but going to Webster Webster I'm
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.600]  springing this on you because it's breaking in a lot of times when something's
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.200]  this big I end up just canceling gas till the next day but I wanted to have you
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:12.400]  long as you could speak to this we got the quasi-secret documents and we've
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:18.080]  confirmed them from KBR Kellogg Brown and Roots subsidiary Halliburton who
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.880]  admittedly runs camps all over the world right and we know that we know that six
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.320]  years ago they got the 386 million dollar contract for three one million man
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:33.000]  cams source on that Wall Street Journal now I've been sent something we're
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.760]  breaking it where they're now getting ready to man them the big camps and the
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:41.720]  little camps and it says barricades barbed wire jailed you know the jail guards
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.600]  the food services for a collapse and it's huge news we're trying to punch it
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:52.080]  out there to everybody you see the NDAA passing where they could secretly arrest
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:57.200]  citizens use the military I mean classical off the chart authoritarianism
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:02.240]  we see just all the military accelerations I mean things are going
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.720]  into high gear but the fact that they're actually putting out the contracts to
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:12.360]  now man the camps I mean is this not incredible Webster what does this
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.480]  signify to you that they're saying 72-hour notice these people are paid
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:21.680]  lavish amounts subcontractors to be ready to provide this to the master
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.320]  company KBR within 72 hours I'm not saying it's gonna happen in 72 they're
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.720]  now signing up to always be ready what does that sound like to you Webster well
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:36.160]  we know that we're in a depression we are in this terrible breakdown crisis or
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:41.640]  disintegration of the world economy last week on Wednesday we came close to
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:47.480]  blowing out the entire thing we had three big euro zombie banks reportedly
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:52.720]  reportedly Kommerzbank of Germany Unicredito of Italy and one French bank
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:57.920]  maybe Société Générale maybe Crédit agricole it's not known but this has
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:03.240]  been reported by by reliable European sources and that joint action of the
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:08.640]  six central banks you saw last week right the US the Europeans Japan Canada
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:14.600]  Britain Switzerland all making it easier for zombie banks to borrow money was in
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.440]  response to the fact that the bottom was about to fall out and now we have
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:26.400]  Merkel and Sarkozy trying to ram through this lunatic austerity corset as they
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.560]  call it in Britain it's a it's a kind of a straight jacket that says everybody
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.840]  has to have a balanced budget or or thereabouts and of course these are
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:41.240]  this a very evil plan so we remember we're always in this three three phase
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:47.960]  problem depression leading to dictatorship leading to then the war and
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:52.880]  we're seeing the dictatorship in the war come in at the same time so history it
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:57.160]  always happens people marvel that you and I and others have accurately Ron Paul
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:03.080]  predicted things but this is the course of human events yeah except you can stop
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:07.200]  it except there's nothing fatal about this there is no destiny at any point
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.680]  up until the point of total dictatorship I suppose you can you can
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:15.760]  intervene in this and stop the crash there's nothing sacred about the crash
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:20.200]  what has to happen to a depression you have to fight it and we know how to do
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.480]  this we know from our experience in in the 1930s and 1940s we know from New
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:29.320]  Deal lendlies and other things even if you're right about that political and
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.360]  financial strategy it's not going to be implemented they want the collapse they
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.240]  want to use the collapse to reorganize society along the eugenics model and
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:41.600]  they're going to do it so the question is what do we maybe that may be the news
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.120]  of these concentration camps will shake through a couple exactly so I want to
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:49.560]  break the concentration camps down with you then we'll get into 70 years
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:53.120]  yesteryear because those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it doctor

[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.680]  the hell we're gonna get into 70 years after the tragic events of Pearl Harbor
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.560]  what really happened there has been researching it for years as a book
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.840]  coming out on the subject then Austin police chief Arte Cerveta scheduled to
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:37.720]  be in here act will be here soon here's the big headline at info wars dot com
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:45.560]  exclusive government activating FEMA camps across the United States a project
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:49.640]  overview and anticipated project requirements the same subsidiary of
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:55.160]  Halliburton they got the three one million man camp funding this all ties
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:59.040]  into the emergency center's establishment act it sets up fencing
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:09.720]  barricades and prepares teams all over the country to be on 72-hour notice to
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:14.600]  activate and staff the camps so they just sit there on standby and are waiting
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:19.640]  this is a major escalation right as the global depression comes in right as the
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.800]  economy smelt down right as the bankers and the zombie banks get more power out
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:28.480]  of the crisis they created and this also dovetails with the other article
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.520]  by Paul Joseph Watson detention camps order follows preparations for civil
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:36.480]  unrest the US government the British government we have links to that are in
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:39.840]  the news saying they're getting ready for civil unrest oh they've passed the
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.320]  law where the army can operate and arrest whoever they want for any reason and
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:50.640]  they say activism protesting is terror what do Kennedy say those that make
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:59.240]  peaceful peaceful political activity illegal make violence revolution
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:04.160]  inevitable yeah yeah so it's making revolution inevitable KBR seek sub
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:09.800]  contractors to outfit emergency environment centers and it's for
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:14.240]  political it's for environmental I mean this is such a giant escalation we
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.960]  can see it everywhere Webster what's your view on this well I would say first
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:23.520]  of all what to do about it is why doesn't Ron Paul and Congressman Kucinich or
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:27.920]  some combination like that something that that you know a bipartisan group why
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.800]  can't we get a resolution in the House of Representatives condemning
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:38.040]  preparations under Obama for domestic dictatorship and make some make some
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:41.800]  noise about that the other thing to do is you know you have these Republican
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.200]  candidates campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire and if people are there this
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:51.080]  is a golden opportunity to confront them hey hey Newt Gingrich what do you think
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:55.080]  about concentration camps hey Romney what do you think about them hey Bachman
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:59.040]  hey Santorum hey all of them right what what do you what do you think about them
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:02.920]  give Ron Paul a chance to say something about it and condemn it in other words
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:07.600]  let's get a political campaign going and let's also make sure that international
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.920]  attention is called to this right that people in the world should know that
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.520]  the concentration camps are being readied perhaps one of the thing like
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:20.560]  the segue into Pearl Harbor you know the question of the Japanese being
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.400]  rounded up the Japanese the Nisei so-called the the Japanese Americans
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:30.160]  in particularly in the West Coast States California and so forth that was
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:35.960]  ordered really not by Roosevelt but by a guy called Colonel Henry Stimson and
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:42.080]  his friend was John J. McCloy now what once I've said these two names Stimson
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:47.600]  and McCloy I have identified the leaders the deans of the Wall Street faction in
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:52.800]  the 1930s 40s into the into the 60s and and even the 70s and it was in
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:59.480]  particular Stimson acting on advice of McCloy who said to Roosevelt you are
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.320]  going to put concentration camps up and you're going to put the Japanese in them
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.840]  and this of course you have to remember these people are Republicans in the
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:10.760]  words they are people that Roosevelt brought into the government in June of
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:15.680]  1940 after the fall of France he wanted to have a national unity government a
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:19.840]  bipartisan government so he had to invite in these Republican Wall Street
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:24.840]  guys who ran the the Pentagon in effect the War Department they were not
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.880]  creatures of Roosevelt they were Wall Street guys and they acted as Wall Street
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:34.000]  guys always did this is the group that's responsible for dropping the atomic
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.720]  bomb Roosevelt of course dead by that time and let's expand the national
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:46.280]  Japanese-American groups head has come out and condemned the NDA and the camps
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:49.800]  that are being built we haven't gotten a response now that this came out I mean
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:57.480]  things are certainly escalating but this shows that the establishment thinks the
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.080]  total collapse is right around the corner it's one thing to build all these
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:06.080]  camps and have a mothball sitting there that's bad enough now for the first time
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:10.520]  ever they're saying okay these aren't bids to build them these are bids to
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:16.120]  man them I mean I don't think people out there realize the magnitude and I agree
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:20.080]  with you everybody needs to go to their police chiefs their their county
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:25.240]  commissioners their sheriffs they need to go to all of them and point out okay
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:29.360]  they're passing laws that the army can be used they can secretly arrest us
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.640]  Obama's lawyers you know say we're not going to sign that because we're going
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.240]  to veto it because Obama doesn't need Congress to do this but we do agree we
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.720]  we can still do it the army admitting they're ready for domestic operations the
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:44.800]  TSA running checkpoints I mean clearly they're getting ready to try to clamp
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.840]  down on the population just like sapping in Europe and most economists Webster
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:54.040]  say the US is worse off than Europe once the collapse comes here and they
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:57.920]  think that they can ride this this dragon this tiger that that they've
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:04.080]  created but great ideas we've got to make a major movement out of this and say
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.440]  look I mean this one article that Kurt Nemo and I wrote last night it breaks
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:13.280]  down all the admissions the bills the Congress the maps where they're at it's
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:18.200]  total proof that this is going on and you added to all this other stuff and the
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.760]  Japanese group in America coming out in warning I mean this is so serious what
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:26.840]  does this signify for you though Webster that they are going ahead and now
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:31.600]  moving to man the camps well this is that three-phase progression that we saw
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:36.160]  in the 1930s and as long as you have protracted depression getting worse as
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:40.640]  the phases go on unless you stop the depression there's really very little
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:44.200]  you can do about this this other stuff naturally we want to do a lot in terms of
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:49.920]  denouncing the the totalitarianism and the dictatorship how about getting a
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.880]  a committee of distinguished people right emergency committee against
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:00.600]  dictatorship in the United States and try to try to get bipartisan you know
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:06.280]  writers scientists humanitarians college presidents who knows right who knows
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.480]  what you can get have a have a white paper that's drawn up right the the
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:14.840]  actual I think what's been missing is really a book about concentration camps
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:19.400]  in the US in our time I'm not sure that story has ever really been told but to
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:23.360]  have a conference press conference here at the National Press Club in Washington
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:27.480]  you get the foreign press in particular I'm sure the way the wind is blowing
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:33.440]  right now Russia China Syria Iran they would all be there they would all be
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:38.000]  interested in that and and and get the story out it's a worldwide campaign
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.760]  against that but having said all that if you really want to stop this you got to
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:47.000]  go to the cause you got to go for the matador not the cape you got to go for
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.960]  the cause not the symptoms and that would mean for example the cause of this is
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.520]  the zombie banks in other words it's as I tried to show it's the collapse of the
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:01.800]  zombie banks last week in particular the three big euro zombies that's where
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:06.880]  the crisis comes from in which that's why we've got austerity and then the killer
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.160]  austerity leads to people going out in the streets and then the response is
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:15.760]  let's send it the the SWAT teams and let's start rounding people up and put
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:20.000]  in putting them in the sports stadium like pinotchet so you got to have an
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.040]  economic program to fight dictatorship because otherwise you're just finding the
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:32.480]  symptoms which of course have to be fought and then you well you know it
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:36.880]  means you've got to essentially see where it's all coming from and the the
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:41.320]  the problem that we're facing is in Europe right we're told that they need
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:46.640]  three three trillion dollars where does all this come from what what you're
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.480]  talking about there is derivatives right the derivatives have caused the
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.880]  bankruptcy of these zombie banks we know that the the European zombie banks
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:00.200]  are loaded with collateralized debt obligations that they got in 2007 2008
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:04.080]  they're still sitting there so that's got to be canceled we got to say look you
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:08.120]  know we can't afford derivatives anymore you know we can we got to be able to
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:12.320]  afford pensions and food stamps and unemployment benefits but derivative
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.640]  sorry we can't afford that we can eat we got to afford some kind of national
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:21.200]  defense at some level but derivatives not who needs derivatives nobody can eat
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:25.680]  them live in them you can't use them they're not a tool let me stop you to
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:31.360]  put this in layman terms for myself and others look obviously this is the
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:36.160]  progression of collapse dictatorship and then finally the dictatorship stay in
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:40.720]  power war that's always the process the world just like before World War one
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:51.000]  World War two is hurtling into this same quagmire bygone but now the social
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.120]  engineers whether they're right or wrong believe that they have engineered
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:00.760]  this and are gonna be able to ride this out so it is a planned program and and
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:04.520]  I understand that as things collapse that leans towards dictatorship but they
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:13.040]  want this post-industrial as you've exposed eugenics style shut down and
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:19.160]  then reengineering of our society so the point I raise here is as Europe
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.480]  collapses then as the US collapses obviously they think okay man the camps
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:26.720]  for social unrest but they already had the camps built they knew this was
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:32.240]  coming what is the time frame right now is this global meltdown accelerates in
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:39.720]  your research well again we we had a big a big worldwide disintegration the
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:46.240]  systemic crisis in September October November of 2008 so that's three years
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:52.760]  ago now but now as of last Wednesday we were in a super Lehman we basically had
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:57.360]  three Lehman brothers three Euro zombies playing the role of Lehman and
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.200]  of course that's you know that's triple trouble the other problem you have is
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:08.400]  US is depressed Europe is headed into recession we've got the credit agencies
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:14.640]  attacking Europe this amazing standard and pours is now attacking 15 European
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:19.240]  countries simultaneously they say to France and even to Germany guess what
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:25.360]  we're gonna downgrade you I'm amazed that some police agency some independent
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:30.600]  judge or magistrate doesn't start indicting sure because these ratings
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:34.240]  agencies openly work for the big six mega banks that are taking the sovereign
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:38.160]  nations over and want things to get worse threatening give the banks all the
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:42.120]  power will implode you and then somehow the media tells the public this is our
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:47.120]  debt when almost all of it is the mega banks debt and then now in Portugal I
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:51.640]  want to talk about this they've publicly started taking private pension funds
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:56.560]  that was in the news yesterday I mean it is so crazy and if you don't like it you
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:02.320]  go to a FEMA camp we'll be right back what happened man you used to be

[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:29.520]  article up in info wars.com by Curt Nimmo again rich advocates trashing
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:34.080]  Fourth Amendment and Bill of Rights and even jokes in the C-span video from a
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:40.040]  couple years ago that somebody dug up he even brags that hey it'd be good to
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.880]  let some terror attacks take place so people will give their rights up
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:49.320]  incredibly creeping but when you research this stuff it's so obvious what's
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:54.520]  going on it's so obvious what our society has turned into I want to do the
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:57.320]  second half of the interview on Pearl Harbor and the seventh anniversary in
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:03.320]  your deep research there Webster but I'm sure you saw the articles yesterday
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:11.200]  out of their spiegel and others where they were talking about Portugal taking
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:15.280]  private pension funds this isn't getting rid of them welfare people's money like
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:20.080]  everybody says this is the mega banks taking people's pension funds taking a
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:23.920]  large part of them and then saying the government now manages them and will
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:27.440]  give you what we feel like you should get but it's a one-off they're saying to
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:31.240]  prop up banks and then of course you've done the math on this it's over a
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:34.920]  thousand five hundred quadrillion one thousand five hundred trillion it's all
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:39.280]  derivatives we don't owe it and you could feed everything into it it won't pay
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:47.040]  it off so I mean how much are they gonna get away with well in in Portugal we
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:51.760]  had austerity under the socialists I think we're now under under a different
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:56.080]  different leadership but it just shows you once you go down the road of
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:01.520]  austerity and cuts and and balancing the budget you're gonna lose everything and
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:05.320]  you're gonna use your lose your political rights let me also say though with
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:10.000]  the Anglo-Americans right London Washington these these characters the
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.920]  thing that's scaring them most right now is Putin the fact that Putin is back
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:20.240]  and Russia is back and we've got you know six or eight conflict points from
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:25.960]  Syria to the anti-ballistic missiles to Hillary Clinton shooting off her yap
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:31.880]  about the Russian elections and and getting a really blunt invitation to
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:35.880]  you know go mind her own business from the from the Russian foreign minister
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:41.480]  right right now we've got a kind of a fake it's like a mini-colour revolution
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:46.720]  in the streets of Moscow put up there by you know by the US by the British but
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:51.480]  Gorbachev has joined in like Gorbachev is shown what he was made of all along
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:55.800]  that he was basically a foreign agent wrecking the Soviet Union back when he
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:59.840]  did and they all say oh no this this election is not legitimate this was the
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:04.520]  parliament now the interesting thing is they say the the United Russia lost
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:08.840]  votes in the parliamentary election and that's Putin's fault wait a minute
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:13.680]  Putin was not on the ballot who was on the ballot was mid-day death so it's a
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:18.280]  vote against the cowardice and the and the you know the appeasement and the
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:23.720]  weakness of mid-day death I think when you see Putin run you he'll get a very
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:28.400]  satisfactory vote but in the meantime this phase of the two elections right
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:33.040]  the parliamentary election now in the presidential election next March the
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.840]  US and the British think they can make trouble for Russia they're going to try
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:42.720]  to get in there and do something maybe a cyber offensive like we've never seen
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:48.520]  it in history or a false flag right some bomb goes off and somebody says oh
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:54.760]  that's the KGB and we know that the KGB means Putin so we know Putin did it
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:59.880]  something really wild is I think in the works because what we've been talking
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:04.680]  about up to now the US British ruling class is Berserk they're bunkers
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:09.120]  they're collectively insane right mad as hatters mad as March hairs whatever you
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:12.520]  want to say they're ready for just about anything because their capital
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:18.400]  structures are collapsing and we now see this this poll of resistance well I
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:24.160]  was about to add bombing military bases in Pakistan the Russian and Iran the
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:29.120]  Russians are moving their fleet into the Mediterranean with nukes and on top of
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:35.080]  that the president of China has said prepare for war with the US publicly I
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:38.760]  mean that is an incredible escalation that's I think that's a it's a
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:43.480]  realistic statement unfortunately at this point but the problem is the the the
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:50.560]  drug inert you know US public doesn't seem to register these things so it's
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:55.320]  it's of course necessary to beat the drum about all this but the the
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:59.720]  strategic reality of China I mean it's been decades since they said prepare for
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:04.280]  war with the United States I mean that was associated press yesterday but
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:08.320]  wasn't even really a big nightly news item I mean Russia's got ships coming in
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:11.080]  that the Chinese are threatening because they know they're about to have their
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:16.640]  oil cut off just like the Japanese did pre Pearl Harbor but by cutting off the
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:19.640]  Iranian oil the Iranians are saying they're gonna block the straight over
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:23.680]  most of these sanctions go in I mean boy the world is no wonder they're getting
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:28.040]  ready to staff the FEMA camps Christmas on the brink right and and maybe new
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:32.120]  years in a FEMA camp after Christmas on the brink well there's got to be a way
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:35.520]  to back this off that's no future for the United States right the American
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:40.400]  people reject all because the bankers had to create a thousand trillion in fake
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:44.360]  derivatives and sell it to everybody all because a bunch of bankers who make 40 to
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:50.160]  one bats and think they're invincible want to play God I mean this is never an engine we're

[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:40.280]  finish up with the geopolitical and then get to 70 years later after Pearl
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:46.200]  Harbor from your deep research what really happened there and how all of
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:50.680]  this ties together at our point in history but anything else you'd like to
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:57.040]  add about currently what's happening financially and if things do continue
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:02.800]  down this road where will be six months from now well the depression comes in
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:10.120]  waves the first wave was in 2008 we're now in the middle and we're in the real
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:15.520]  soup of the second wave and as you were saying before if you get one two or
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:20.520]  three euro zombies blowing up then it's gonna come right back to city bank Bank
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:25.080]  of America and the rest of the Wall Street zombies who of course despite what
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:28.800]  the networks tell you are not fundamentally stronger than the
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:34.120]  European it's now admitted that most of this is actually stuff they did in
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:37.560]  Europe they're bailing themselves out yeah and of course we have you know
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:41.480]  Europe now under Goldman Sachs dictatorship Draghi the head of the
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:47.840]  European Central Bank Monty this this what can we say exterminating angel of
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:53.360]  austerity and don't forget Papa Deimos of Greece who's from the Boston Federal
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:59.120]  Reserve so you I saw an interesting cartoon coming through the Paris
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:05.480]  Airport coming back from Syria you have a guy in a jail right he's in a jail
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.280]  cell he's got a newspaper and it says Goldman Sachs veterans take power in
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:12.680]  Europe and he picks up the phone and he says this is Harry Madoff I'm
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:19.280]  volunteering to become Prime Minister of Portugal right so Madoff we may be
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:22.920]  getting to the point where Madoff will be rehabilitated and made head of the
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:26.360]  European Central Bank or the European Commission or whatever it is it's
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:32.240]  basically it's it's a world gone mad so it's time to to assert sanity against
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:36.760]  this stuff and that means denounce the the slide into dictatorship by all
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:41.360]  means right shock people to awareness but what you then want them to do is get
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:45.880]  a mass movement against against Wall Street yes against finance capital to
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:49.800]  shut down the zombie banks and to nationalize the Federal Reserve that's
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:54.240]  it and in that show now they're playing a sophisticated game though and they'll
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:58.320]  trial sorts of dirty tricks you myself Dr. Roberts another saw the telltale
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:07.440]  signs of espionage with the former head of the IMF who they shot down that's
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:12.000]  now admitted with Dominique Strauss-Kahn that that was a intelligence
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.680]  operation and was staged they're talking about his comeback why did they go
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:21.920]  after him well the the account that I have is that at that week the week that
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:25.560]  Dominique Strauss-Kahn was entrapped I guess he was it being trapped on a
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:32.000]  Sunday night I think his schedule that night was to fly back to Europe and he
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.920]  was actually headed for Berlin and the story goes that there was an attempt by
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:44.600]  the Europeans back in in the springtime when this happened that Strauss-Kahn was
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:48.560]  going to go to Berlin and meet with Merkel and they were going to try to
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:55.440]  set up the pilot project so to the embryonic form of a New World monetary
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:01.800]  system which would be alternative to the dollar maybe a euro based reserve
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:05.800]  currency and of course if you want to do that the first thing you need is oil so
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:11.720]  that they actually had an envoy who was scheduled to go from Berlin to Tripoli
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:16.640]  Libya to meet with Gaddafi to see if they could get him to be the initial
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:22.280]  oil backstop for that in other words would he would he lend his his oil
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:27.840]  reserves and his is African following to this kind of a of an operation and for
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:32.360]  some reason the Anglo-Americans decided no we don't want to wait for this the
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:37.160]  Europeans might be doing something to save themselves from this attack right
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:42.160]  because the the crisis of the euro is artificial it is economic warfare it's a
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:46.520]  beggar my neighbor policy by the US and the British to make sure that the second
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:50.800]  phase of the depression hits Europe because it could just as easily a fit
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:55.640]  London or which is actually much more bankrupt right Britain is a much much
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:59.880]  poorer country than France it's much more bankrupt and by the way that's even
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.200]  admitted that's even admitted in the British papers and of course they'll
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:07.400]  get to England and us here too they just want to destroy that first I mean you
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:11.680]  know the globalists do do plan on further destroying us yeah but there's
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:15.360]  also the Frankenstein effect in the words what the schemers in the city of
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:18.880]  London and Wall Street what they think they're gonna get is not what they get
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:23.640]  right they they thought that Hitler would attack Stalin and that was all and
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:28.560]  instead Hitler turned out to be trickier than they thought he turned out to be in
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:33.440]  the Frankenstein monster so when they once you get into this game of having a
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:36.880]  depression and you're trying to shove that out to somebody else then the
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:41.480]  boomerang effect is gonna get you well I mean what about poking China and Russia
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:46.360]  in the nose that's that's that's reckless well we had you know Medvedev
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:50.680]  was completely sold on the reset right he really believed that there was gonna
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:55.600]  be a reset with Obama look at Obama he's got such a nice smiling face and we had
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:59.640]  that little hamburger button we had that button yeah we had hamburger
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:07.400]  diplomacy we had yeah but come on yeah but maybe not because it once you if
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:11.600]  you get the entire world on your side even in the country like Russia that
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:15.280]  gives you real power so they were they were you know Goldman Sachs people
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:18.920]  whispering in Medvedev's ear you know we're gonna make you great you know get
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:24.080]  dumb Putin will make you the lord of you know half the world and instead right
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:28.040]  now Medvedev I think Medvedev is on his way out I think what's likely to happen
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:34.600]  now is Putin is gonna say Medvedev you failed your lousy campaign your lousy
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:39.720]  policies have lost us 77 seats in the parliament we're dumping you we're
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:43.000]  bringing in somebody else let's be honest Webster
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.240]  Medvedev was simply a placeholder for Putin and to create the illusion of
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:53.480]  people changing so Putin could but still be in power I mean come on I just case
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:58.000]  in point like Libya if Putin had been president this Libya thing could never
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.760]  have happened it was Medvedev who insisted he actually said that Russia
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:07.320]  would join in the attack with he said peacekeeping forces but that meant and
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:10.720]  we have seen a shift in policy because now Putin and others have said you
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.800]  attack Syria we're gonna attack you right and we've got they've got an
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:18.640]  aircraft carrier a heavy cruiser with guided missiles they've got nuclear
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:21.960]  submarines nobody knows how many Russian nuclear submarines there are in the
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:26.200]  Medvedev in the eastern Mediterranean I don't want to find out and and you've
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:31.160]  got similar things going on I'm sure with Iran and and elsewhere so there is a
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:35.800]  change and there was a substantive divergence it was more than just what
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:39.760]  do you make of Pakistan and and the Iran situation Webster and then I want to
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:43.160]  get into Pearl Harbor briefly just it documents the insanity of the Anglo
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:47.400]  Americans with Pakistan you have a country Pakistan is under a Chinese
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:51.920]  guarantee in effect or the Chinese back in the springtime said China will
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:55.760]  consider an attack on Pakistan as an attack on China and now they've said
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:02.120]  that again it said it again and Putin is now personally sponsoring China to
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:06.760]  become a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization so there's a
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:11.160]  double guarantee for Pakistan but the Anglo-Americans say hey we are the
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:16.080]  imperialists we rule the world we're crazy we do what we want we're pushing
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:20.800]  ahead we're gonna try to grab the Pakistani nuclear forces so again you've
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:25.120]  got this belt of territory right because that's what's emerging Lebanon Syria
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:30.000]  Iraq where the US is now leaving like we're having a Maya gas moment like
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:37.280]  1975 in Saigon plus then after Iraq comes Iran and Pakistan that's a huge
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:42.560]  piece of the Earth's surface which is now pretty much rebelling against the US
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:48.360]  and the British and Hillary Clinton is bonkers Susan Rice's bonkers Obama I
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:51.920]  don't know how bonkers he is he's certainly mentally disturbed but he's
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:56.000]  mainly out there courting adulation as he as he runs around you know from
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.640]  campaign event yeah he's an ego maniac narcissist moron remember the five
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:05.800]  people US is now run by five people that's a secret committee committee of
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:11.120]  public safety is Panetta it's Hillary Clinton it's Eric Holder
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:16.120]  police minister it's Donald on of the National Security Council and General
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:20.920]  Petraeus that's the principles committee that's what runs the US not Obama is
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:26.440]  sort of a you know he's he's a side show with his campaign events and is you know
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:30.440]  he wants to cut the social security payroll tax he wants to destroy social
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:36.440]  security to give himself a short-term boost this pickable all right amazing
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:40.040]  information we only got about 10 minutes left and I meant to get to some calls
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:44.200]  but we'll have to do it tomorrow on the subject of the 7th anniversary I mean we
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:47.640]  know the Honolulu advertiser reported a week before they'd be attacked on the
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:51.200]  morning of December 7th the Japanese submarines were attacked that morning
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:54.640]  off the coast still they ordered to stand down the purple code the blue code
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:58.640]  broken again I'm not saying the Imperial Japanese were good this is a great
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:03.440]  example no they were not good they were really bad I think that's maybe the
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:08.760]  starting point is that Japan was Japan if you take the period between 1890 and
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:14.680]  1950 Japan attacked more countries and bigger countries than anybody in the
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:19.040]  world they did not have to be provoked to do anything when they wanted to attack
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:23.600]  Manchuria they provoked themselves with the Mukden incident when they wanted to
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:28.080]  attack China very aggressive very Marshall my point is you you're writing a
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:31.600]  book on Pearl Harbor itself though what's your view so here it is but what
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:34.560]  you got to get the historical go ahead you go ahead then the background is is
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:38.400]  what's what's not what's missing let's just do it on three levels first of all
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.600]  let me let me premise if you're interested in the book info info wars
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:48.800]  that I'm sorry it's getting ahead of myself it's a progressive press calm
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:52.320]  progressive press calm you can pre-order it unfortunately it's going to be a
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:56.080]  couple of months late concerning the anniversary so progressive press calm
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:59.560]  look under coming soon and then you'll find the Pearl Harbor there are three
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:04.720]  groups we got to look at first is Kimmel short and block in Hawaii right the
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:09.160]  commanders on the scene why did they blow it then we got to go back to
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:12.920]  Washington we got to look in the War Department and the Navy Department and
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:19.840]  we got to look at the group around Stimson Marshall McCloy Lovett Bundy
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:25.120]  interesting names and a guy called Richmond K. Turner at the Navy Department
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:30.640]  and then on the codes we got to look at Sir Winston Churchill because he's the
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:37.000]  guy who can read the Japanese Naval Code JN 25 which the US largely cannot read or
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:42.880]  he can read much better and he is the one who fails he refuses to warn Roosevelt
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:46.560]  and the US that the Japanese are coming but let's just let's take it in order
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:51.040]  first of all the guys on the scene right Kimmel and short Kimmel for the Navy
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:55.840]  short for the army and actually block is there is the Naval District commander
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:01.840]  they get a warning on November 27th it says consider this a war warning carry
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:07.880]  out an appropriate defensive deployment and they do what virtually nothing short
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:12.040]  actually makes it worse he puts the planes on the runway wingtip to wingtip
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:16.040]  and Kimmel says well we'll be ready for submarines that's not what you were
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:19.720]  supposed to be ready for you're supposed to be ready for carriers and they knew
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:24.160]  this right they've been drilling this since the 1920s they'd known and they'd
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:28.040]  even known what's what direction the the Japanese fleet would have to come from if
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:33.400]  it wanted to preserve secrecy not crossing the the sea lane so Kimmel in
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:37.120]  particular who's the most vocal defending himself he blames everybody but
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:42.600]  himself Kimmel you had submarines you had destroyers you had light cruisers
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:47.240]  with airplanes on them you had something called seaplane tenders where you
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:51.600]  could subsix or eight sea planes operating off a you know look something
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:54.960]  looked like a freighter you could have sent all of that out and made a screen
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:49:00.880]  you were told by the Navy Department to send out sandpans yachts tugs you were
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:06.560]  told to send Coast Guard cutters you had dozens and dozens and dozens of ships
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:12.760]  you also had PBY Catalinas you had the 18 Bolo bombers they were obsolete but
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:18.200]  you could use them for pretty good reconnaissance why did why did Kimmel
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:22.240]  do nothing because it's clear he did nothing he refused to do any of that he
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:26.040]  said I couldn't have a perfect search therefore I had no search and unfortunately
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:29.720]  people in the Navy backed him up I would say the verdict on these people is
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:35.320]  their defeatists they don't want to fight fascism they don't want the war that's
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:39.200]  in front of them they're thinking about some other war some other time if you
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:44.040]  look in American military history these guys are like George McClellan they
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:47.880]  want to train and train and train and then somebody says why don't you go and
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:53.000]  fight oh no I've got a train and train and in particular they remind me of the
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.920]  French generals of the year before who had a very strong military establishment
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:02.560]  and were nevertheless rolled over by Hitler because their heart wasn't in it
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:06.120]  well that was VC infiltration they were just waiting to have power handed to
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:09.400]  them and of course you bring up the famous Civil War northern general who
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:12.800]  wouldn't fight but I mean Webster Webster Webster it's clear that your
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:18.120]  precious Roosevelt was involved in him and oh no he was talking to Churchill
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:21.760]  and Churchill said he slept a wonderful sleep that night knowing the US will be
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:24.960]  brought into the war and all the rest of it gotta get into the into the fine
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:29.320]  green detail now let's let's look at the problem is obviously the people in
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:32.840]  Pearl Harbor are bunglers when I started with this I think they're just
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:37.400]  garden variety bunglers but now I realize they're defeatists they're people
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:42.080]  who agree with Lindbergh and with and with the Chicago Tribune and they say
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:46.640]  let Hitler seize the world we don't care so they're like Neville Chamberlain's
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:51.320]  exactly stay there let's let's look at that's only the first day there Pearl
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:55.940]  Harbor seven years later with Webster I love Roosevelt terribly they're right

[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:07.320]  else above this as well but anyways he's there's a lot of courage to come in
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:10.840]  here and talk to me because he is he is a smart guy maybe he's right maybe maybe
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:15.480]  the new order is good but anyways he's coming in here Tarpley you've got the
[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:18.920]  floor okay so you're getting into what really happened with Pearl Harbor my
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:22.880]  whole issue is you know about the five midget subs that we're trying to attack
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:26.480]  that morning and still the stand-down went forward I think it's worse than
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:31.000]  just bungling here Webster but look you're dealing with Kimmel and Short
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.360]  who don't want to fight they they're not interested in fighting fascism and you
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:40.800]  can compare Short right his lack of air defense you can compare that to a guy
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:46.160]  who did want to fight fascism general Claire Chanalt of the Flying Tigers was
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:51.440]  able to defend like Rangoon Burma the same month as Pearl Harbor with very
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:58.080]  few aircraft 10 20 30 Flying Tigers he was able to inflict very serious losses
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:02.680]  on Japanese attackers and he had been doing that even for the Chinese he'd
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:09.080]  been he organized the air defense of Shanghai China in 1937 1938 and got the
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:13.680]  same kind of results so you could have defended the island except you needed to
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:18.400]  have the Chinalt mentality which was we want to fight fascism and we trust the
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:22.280]  people were willing to trust the average yeah but the Flying Tigers were sent
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:26.720]  there covertly to fight the Japanese yeah but even before the Flying Tigers
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:30.720]  there's Chinalt as an individual is an advisor to Chiang Kai-shek and he
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:35.120]  organizes the air defense of Chinese cities very interesting thing but I'm
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:38.480]  not saying that was a bad thing I think the Japanese were out of control it's
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:41.920]  just let's be honest they let them attack the ships to get us into the war
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:46.640]  and you're acting like Roosevelt was floating around playing hearts wait a
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:51.280]  minute it's not Roosevelt this is the this is the fraud the idea that Roosevelt
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:55.480]  is a conspiracy Roosevelt is the target of the conspiracy and here's the
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:57:01.080]  conspiracy with him the people in Washington if you see that your guys in
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:05.680]  Hawaii are bungling and they don't get it you got to get on the horn and tell
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:10.600]  them hey bozos snap to get yourself going right we're talking about a war
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:14.600]  warning here and you're you're thinking about sabotage or submarines who who
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:19.880]  blocks that Admiral Richmond K Turner in the Navy Department and he's a he's
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:22.920]  really the dominant maybe you're right maybe it was bungling because they did
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:30.760]  stop all five of the Japanese subs some of them you go on total alert when
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:35.280]  Japanese subs are invading the island except that then there's no alert in
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:38.920]  other words they would have had one or two hours of warning except there's no
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:42.840]  alert and they have radar warning and there's no alert and that's a stand down
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:47.920]  Webster it's not bungling stand down here by who by the commanders who are
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:52.720]  there and they're bunglers because they're essentially soft on fascism
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:56.040]  they don't how do you bundle when submarines an hour and a half before
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:01.360]  are in battles with with anti-submarine ships they refuse to call an alert
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:05.480]  right short short you got submarines attacking you don't call an alert that's
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:10.240]  not bungling Webster that's what they did that's that's not bungling Webster
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:14.480]  he's got five submarines attacking an hour and a half before and they don't
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:19.600]  and they don't do an alert you've got radar coming in and the guy says don't
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:22.720]  worry about it we're gonna have to debate this we're gonna debate this next week

[02:01:56.440 --> 02:02:01.880]  but there is no judge or jury man you just you disappear oh have you heard
[02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:04.240]  about the new National Defense Authorization Act where the militaries
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:08.120]  gonna be on the streets that's news to me you know I'm serious look right off
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:10.120]  where you didn't hear about the bill where they want to use the military not
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:12.920]  yet not you're about the TSA want to run checkpoints on the highways and
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:18.320]  starting it no I haven't heard that yet what is your view of that well I mean I
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:22.280]  have to get more information but I think that if somebody's gonna do that as
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:26.400]  we have the local police for there's a specific need I don't think we need TSA
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:29.960]  to do it but who knows I don't know that a violation of the 10th amendment I
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:33.720]  mean that's outside the Fed's jurisdiction well I depends what the
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:37.880]  checkpoints are for but the bottom line is I'd have to get more information but
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:42.400]  checkpoints aren't good though aren't those unconstitutional depends on what
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:46.120]  checkpoints you're talking about I mean DWI checkpoints have been held
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:49.920]  constitutional by US Supreme Court drivers license checkpoints have been
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:54.480]  held constitutional but there are some parameters that you have to follow in
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:03:00.400]  most states stop everybody no it is you have to you have to advertise them for
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:02.960]  example DWI checkpoints I mean DWI checkpoints really think about them
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:05.960]  they're actually if you really think about them if they're done right they're
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:09.720]  really voluntary you have to what do you have to advertise them that's some of
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:12.480]  the requirements in most states to have them so if Germany would have advertised
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:16.920]  checkpoints that have been good then no the checkpoints they had were not well
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:20.640]  they're looking for specific people based on their race just to in many cases
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:24.520]  religion and here it's just gonna be if you love freedom and are a patriot as you
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:28.400]  get those federal training manuals or it says libertarians conservatives returning
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:32.920]  veterans of the number one terror threat I have not seen it you have to not
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:37.080]  Jones they didn't in your listeners you know though end up thinking I have I have
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:40.120]  not seen them but you know I actually what's really interesting people are
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:43.200]  like I can listen to you but my wife it drives her crazy says you're
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:47.200]  depressing so well I know your family left you because you don't like
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:51.440]  communism so it's mainly a joke when I was out there I know but because I thought
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:53.600]  that I thought I could see it through the windows I thought that was you up
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:57.320]  there so I was like no I wasn't there that day but you just watch the videos I
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:01.520]  watch the video yeah yeah big brother your big brother you're on the internet

[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:21.400]  you have to I think that a democracy you have to police within the within the
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:24.920]  realm of the Constitution you have to and what's interesting is some of the
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:28.000]  guys that I remember having a meeting with some guys and I won't say their
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.800]  names I don't want to embarrass them they came in they say they didn't believe in
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:34.360]  the Constitution well unfortunately that's the book we follow and so really
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:37.720]  who came in and so they believe in it I don't want to say it's Austin police or
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:43.120]  the feds no no it was it was I would say it was people that don't trust the
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:47.760]  government a group that told start the conversation myself and David Carter I
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:50.160]  know you met David our chief of staff that they didn't believe in the
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:53.840]  Constitution and my response to with them was well then I guess I mean it'll be

[02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:28.960]  nice to come in studio with us he's been a really busy guy and it's part of his
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:33.760]  outreach with the population that's basically of course the new older's
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:38.040]  enemy but it's good for their psyops to come in and act friendly with us and so
[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:42.400]  I'm just teasing I know you're a nice guy that's why I got him the tar and
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:47.360]  feather kit this is just for police chief Arte Savetta all right I'm gonna
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:53.480]  stop roasting you in a minute here we go folks actually actually mail this to me
[02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:57.400]  and actually sell these on the internet tar and feather kit that's what they did
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:01.520]  to the British bureaucrats that violated people's rights and liberties and I've
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:04.440]  been wondering what to do with it and I I saw it there on the table today when
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:09.040]  Arte Savetta was coming in so I thought it's got real tar and feathers and say
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:14.160]  next Halloween you can go out on 6th Street as part of community outreach and
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:18.720]  maybe yeah tar and feather excellent yeah we'll hold on to that we'll put it right
[02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:23.920]  here it looks good and then lastly I've got you some raw milk I love milk raw
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:27.880]  milk from San Antonio right here now transporting this across state lines is
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:32.960]  illegal so you're not leaving awesome for the next day today you're not about it
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:36.040]  oh that's enough I'm what's the date today we got it a couple days ago it
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:40.520]  stays good for like weeks of December 6 that mean that's the day it was is that
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:45.640]  is that the expiration date no no that's when it came out of the cow all right I
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:52.240]  love milk are you set me up oh god forbid me bad they get sick of things to
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:56.440]  set up no I noticed the glass I tried to give him he didn't take he gave that to
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:01.600]  me that's very good love no you think it's good the feds are rating people that
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:07.520]  are producing this all over the country I I have no idea it's milk to me man I
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:11.080]  mean to me is pretty extreme I think we should have checkpoints to stop people
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:17.000]  drinking this wants to send you home with it's good give it to the messes it's not
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.520]  good for the for the waistline I bet your son would like it it's not good for
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:23.800]  the waistline well your son is a couple years old he can have this I'll leave it
[02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:27.480]  right there later now we're gonna give you the art I'm gonna stop it that's
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:31.840]  really good I'm trying to be witty and you know I'm not witty you can't go
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:35.600]  ahead you're mad at me for the communist comment well yeah yeah well I'm not mad
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:40.560]  it's just like I just know I think you know we may not agree on everything but
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:44.440]  I think you know that I may be this guy didn't your eyes but you know my heart's
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:47.680]  in the right place and what I'm trying to do is keep people safe which is what
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:52.480]  our officers trying to do and just trying to keep Boston the cool livable
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:57.040]  city it's it is it's a great place to live and work and I don't want to become
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:00.680]  another major American city where people are getting gunned down left and right
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:05.080]  and you know some things I think you got really upset about that gun show thing
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:08.040]  where I think that that counts one out of control we really didn't shut
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:12.160]  anything down the the owner himself decided to shut that down it was not
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:15.040]  the police department that's what you were upset well we talked to the folks
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:17.560]  that were at the meetings though it wasn't the Austin Police Department the
[02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:21.600]  feds basically told them and intimidated them into it but you know what
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:27.600]  listen I came from a state that's really very strict on gun ownership laws and
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:32.640]  and and and concealed carry and stuff that's California to want us a little
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:35.280]  bit more much more progressive probably one of the most progressive in the
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:41.320]  country and I am a completely a convert you know the thought of people will walk
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:44.400]  it driving around with guns in the cars made me very nervous when I first got
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:47.440]  here but I really believe that responsible gun ownership which is what
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:50.920]  Texas has demonstrated by you know making sure that people number one don't
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:54.880]  have psychological issues true psychological issues or that they're
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:58.360]  not involved in criminal enterprises that absent that that law-abiding
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:04.520]  Americans should be able to bear arms and and and and and buy weapons and the
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:08.960]  problem that I see and I think that people that that support the right to
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:12.520]  bear arms needs to be careful of is when you have straw purchasers that show up
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:16.040]  at these gun shows they buy a bunch of guns and then they go out and they sell
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:19.160]  them to criminals to crux to people they're gonna do the drive by sure but
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:23.160]  as long as I have my guns to defend myself right I mean look at Chicago
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:26.200]  New York highest crime rates because only the criminals have the guns you're
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:28.960]  never gonna stop the criminals from having guns I mean I would never say
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:32.480]  take guns from police I'm always more guns for police people get mad about
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:37.080]  police getting a semi-automatic and automatic weapons I say good I mean my
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:41.800]  whole issue is more guns less crime but I mean let's look at fast and furious a
[02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:45.440]  couple years ago with a gun show debacle yeah I was pointing out that that was an
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:49.760]  ATF setup and now we know that those were and the ATF has been shipping guns
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:52.880]  into Mexico to then blame the Second Amendment what's your view of fast and
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:59.160]  furious well I think that it you gotta be very careful that when you put
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:04.040]  something in the hands of the wrong people that it or try to introduce a
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:08.840]  firearm that doesn't end up in the wrong hands and I think that commonsense
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:11.840]  would dictate that if we are shipping weapons to Mexico to end up in the
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:16.600]  narco traffickers hands that are now executing police officers and innocent
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:20.080]  people and all kinds of people in Mexico that they're on the verge of a civil
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:23.680]  war down there they don't they don't really get it together I don't think
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:27.880]  that's what smart well the feds got caught lying to Congress they weren't
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:31.760]  just allowing some to be sold they were shipping a man yeah and then did you
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:35.360]  hear about Sena Loa and National Security got declared on it in Chicago
[02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:41.400]  Sena Loa was allowed to ship drugs in for five years and when the Attorney
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:44.800]  General brought that up and said well you know Bush did this too that's when
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:48.080]  they finally dropped the whole case because it was Bush was involved as
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:51.800]  well I mean you know about Iran contra and all that yeah of course I you're
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:55.560]  out in California I lived you know that's not history for us that we that
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:14:00.480]  was living history for us the well what about drug decriminalization you know I
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:05.760]  I have seen over the years what drugs does to people it ruins a lot of lies
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:12.960]  especially the addictive drugs and well and well now you're the waters in the
[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:17.800]  shot is also we're not all we can't put a product in the shot no I just it looks
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:22.320]  better if it's all is Lord our Lord our days of it all right Lord I didn't mean
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:26.240]  that here you can have the water that's good have the milk here but but the thing
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:33.120]  you brought to you by I'm sorry go ahead he is crazy as ever I love the man now
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:36.000]  you may be free what we're talking about we're talking about fast and furious no
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:40.080]  no we're talking about something else decriminalization of drugs look I am a
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:44.280]  proponent that the answer is not the two because even in even in some European
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:47.640]  countries where they've decriminalized drugs or they're starting to take a
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:51.760]  second look at it because of the social impact it has on people's lives when
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:56.960]  people get addicted to some of the drugs I I am a proponent of we need to fight
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:01.040]  the war at the source which means where they're being produced and that's a
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:03.520]  national security issue that goes beyond the privy of the awesome police
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:07.720]  department but I don't think the answer is to decriminalize drugs marijuana not
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:11.360]  that excited about you know I'm not I don't get too excited about marijuana but
[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:14.880]  come on I can pull the numbers up you're saying Europe's taking a second look at
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:18.840]  it they've got all sorts of numbers where you decriminalize and actually drug use
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:24.560]  goes down well if you look at Vancouver which is a city that has a very
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:29.000]  permissive attitude towards drug use they've got a tremendous problem there
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.920]  well yeah when it's pockets all the druggies move there yeah and that's
[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:34.800]  like Amsterdam well listen I don't like Amsterdam is another area where they
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:38.200]  have problem but I don't I don't use illegal drugs I've tried some of them
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:41.240]  yeah and always felt like I was kicked on the head by mule and I like people pay
[02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:45.120]  for this yeah I like coffee and stuff like that but but in the final
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:48.720]  equation look look what the drug war is doing to Mexico their own government's
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:52.800]  talking about decriminalizing to me again it's not decriminalization I think
[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:57.120]  it's taking the war to the source and that's the answer if one of the sources
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:00.640]  the US government well if that were the case then we need to do something about
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:03.760]  that as well have you seen them admit that our troops have to grow the opium
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:07.800]  in Afghanistan I have not seen that you know what you're a smart guy it's
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:13.360]  convenient you're like sergeant souls you've seen nothing listen I work seven
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:18.040]  days a week and my primary function is the city of Austin I don't have that
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:22.480]  much downtime and I've got plenty of reading to do and the only show I really
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:29.800]  watch on TV is The Walking Dead on AMC I absolutely not a zombie there's a
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:33.200]  vampire movie what's a zombie show but I thought you'd like a vampire movie no
[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:38.320]  no no no actually I saw one the other day on my iPhone it was actually pretty
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:42.160]  good as a fret was listen I'm not just in here trying to grill you over this
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:46.080]  stuff but I promise you we can put it on screen yeah detention camp order
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:50.640]  follows preparation for civil unrest and then here's the emails here's the
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:55.320]  Halliburton operation I have the Wall Street Journal six years ago where they
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:17:00.320]  first got the contract to build the camps now they're preparing to man the
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:05.520]  camps and it talks about security checkpoints barbed wire and barricades
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:10.880]  and they have this emergency centers establishment act that basically says
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:17.000]  political dissidents will go in these no I mean chief are the feds out of their
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:20.760]  jurisdiction if they start arresting political dissidents well I think if you
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:26.320]  look at the First Amendment that we have the right to free speech the for the
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:30.520]  right to associate with whatever beliefs we have as long as we don't start
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:37.120]  talking and taking action to hurt other people or taking arms I think that
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:43.800]  that'd be a slippery slope no kidding but can I have this absolutely but in fact
[02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:47.480]  guys will you print him articles about the NDAA the National Defense
[02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:51.280]  Authorization Act the end deposit commentators they say the troops can
[02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:55.480]  operate anywhere in the US and arrest citizens and never give you a trial you
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:58.160]  know I think that if you talk to military leadership in this country they
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:01.920]  would not feel more a lot of their senior leaders would not feel comfortable
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:05.840]  being involved in police actions within the confines of the continental United
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:08.520]  States well I agree with you they actually have said they don't like it and
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:14.400]  top Jag officers have come out but they follow orders yeah but we'll see I think
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:17.800]  that would be unprecedented I mean you you lived in Cuba when you were little
[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:21.600]  there Fidel uses the military well Fidel uses everybody I mean you talk about
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:27.000]  each block has and this is what American media drives me crazy they they would
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:31.840]  have you know the May Day celebration of Anna 2 million Cubans showed up Dan
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:35.320]  rather would do this all the time and shows us how how pop this guy was no
[02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:38.960]  what he failed to tell American people is it on every block there was a block
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:42.360]  captain for the defense of the revolution and that block captain took
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:48.720]  notes to see who didn't go to the celebration May Day celebration where
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:51.480]  it didn't go if your kid was in medical school the next day they'd find
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:55.320]  themselves working the sugarcane fields and so that's how they got people to go
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:59.080]  to those things not because they love the revolution like some of these people
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:05.240]  that try to fantasize and romanticize communism you know if it was so great
[02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:08.920]  so many thousands of Cubans wouldn't die trying to cross the street every year
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:12.360]  trying to get out of that place well look what Chavez has done now he's really
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:17.560]  wrecked Venezuela that's sad it's sad and he uses the military domestically yes
[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:21.880]  he does and so I think they would you know people can plan for whatever they
[02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:25.480]  want but if the American people will have the final say when it when it's all
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:29.680]  said and done we're gonna skip this network break here and continue we have
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:32.680]  the police chief here you're with us a whole hour aren't you yeah I'm sure you
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:35.800]  are very gracious to do that well hey and before you leave I know you have a
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:38.880]  tight schedule go see our new TV studio on the other side I do you really it'll
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:43.800]  be good for your intelligence files as well you know I have had the FBI here
[02:19:43.800 --> 02:19:49.480]  the and and the Secret Service yes talk to you or on the show to talk to me and
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:52.440]  they wanted to know about the Obama posters out there on the wall they thought
[02:19:52.440 --> 02:19:56.240]  that was like they'd they'd found some crazy persons layer and I explained it
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:20:00.600]  was no no they came and we're asking about the Obama deception yeah my film
[02:20:00.600 --> 02:20:05.840]  and I said well you you know don't you know about it and I'm serious this
[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:10.800]  happened really yeah wow see I wish the feds were nice and friendly like you well
[02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:16.320]  you know I think that you build trust by talking to people and having a that's
[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:20.720]  your cup and having a dialogue you know it's like our intelligence center
[02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:25.200]  everybody was sure that we created the Austin Regional Intelligence Center that
[02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:31.240]  the skeptics thought that we were it's there to spy on you know law abiding
[02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:34.640]  Americans and what's really interesting is if you haven't been there you should
[02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:38.760]  come and visit you're welcome to see it it's that was nothing more than trying
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:43.800]  to leverage technology to solve crime and I'm glad to say that almost two years
[02:20:43.800 --> 02:20:50.400]  into it we're doing it right here in Austin but the threat fusion centers all
[02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:54.800]  over the country are basically federally funded and and let me ask you this
[02:20:54.800 --> 02:21:00.560]  question how many face scanning and license plate reading cameras are here
[02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:04.520]  in Austin how many of the gunshot detectors that never catch anybody
[02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:09.320]  firing a firearm that that by the way are really microphones listening to
[02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:12.160]  people I mean are you aware that homeland securities putting microphones up
[02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:17.880]  hidden in light poles all over the country no but live shot because we are a
[02:21:17.880 --> 02:21:21.960]  safe city I'm glad to say that as much as people try to sell those to us we have
[02:21:21.960 --> 02:21:26.640]  not bottom I don't see a need for them this is not a very violent city that's
[02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:30.560]  a safe city think God but you know they're not really gunshot detectors
[02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:33.720]  they're microphones listen to people I mean I'm sure that they could be multi
[02:21:33.720 --> 02:21:38.160]  use of they wanted to but the bottom lines we haven't bought them here license
[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:41.760]  plate readers and you might not like it but I like LPRs because it's a good
[02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:45.440]  technology to cat if you look at Britain what happens is if you go into small
[02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:50.680]  towns they've been fighting the things to the Troubles in Northern Ireland over
[02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:53.960]  the years they've been fine fighting terrorism for many years they've had a
[02:21:53.960 --> 02:21:57.240]  lot of people die over the years with explosions and stuff but if you go into a
[02:21:57.240 --> 02:22:00.760]  British town there's license plate readers at the entrance to most of those
[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:05.480]  smaller towns and if the vehicles wanted for a crime or it's stolen within
[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:09.000]  minutes the police can actually apprehend that person because of that
[02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:13.440]  technology so I mean it's a it technology isn't the technology in of
[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:17.960]  itself is not evil it's what you use it for how many cars do you have with it
[02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:23.840]  LPRs I think we have four but don't quote me on that could be less it could
[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:27.200]  be a couple as I see the news with the cops they're like that's guys wanted
[02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:31.720]  that's a car robbery as a stolen car I'm like why aren't you stopping each one
[02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:35.320]  why are you driving past them you didn't see that here if we see if it alerts
[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:40.200]  we're gonna arrest the person but LP you to me data to me technology is a force
[02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:44.920]  multipliers and it's the it gives us an ability to fight crime disrupt crime
[02:22:44.920 --> 02:22:51.080]  solve crime in a more efficient manner let me ask you this way what would Hitler
[02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:56.040]  have done with face scanning systems and license plate readers that the
[02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:59.560]  exactly but it's not it's not the technology it's evil it's because your
[02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:05.640]  family of escaped Cuba or other families if Fidel Castro had that then I mean
[02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:09.520]  they have fences they have everything and people the point is the courts and
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:13.160]  the let the violent criminals and bad ones go over and over again we know it's
[02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:16.520]  like five percent of the population that's causing almost all the crime they
[02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:19.920]  just let them go we don't need all this high-tech stuff because it always gets
[02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:24.440]  turned around on the population but well you know what that's why I think that I
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:29.040]  always say this we need to be you need a trust but verify that's one of those
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:34.280]  Reagan yeah my trust but verify that's what I I think that for us like an
[02:23:34.280 --> 02:23:38.560]  intelligence center we have a really good privacy policy we have we have a
[02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:42.960]  privacy policy committee that's well-represented including advocates we I
[02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:47.440]  actually invited John Bush for the taxes of Texas for accountable government I
[02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:51.760]  know you guys are buddies to be on it he declined I invited the ACLU to be on it
[02:23:51.760 --> 02:23:56.440]  they declined but it's because we want to show them that we want you know to me
[02:23:56.440 --> 02:24:03.280]  having that level of accountability and transparency helps me build trust one and
[02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:11.480]  two it helps us create an environment where the misuse of the data or some
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:14.800]  rogue officer or something goes off sideways I want to have those checks and
[02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:18.120]  balances to make sure we're doing things right what about ten years ago you
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:21.240]  weren't here then what you've been police chief how many years it'll be five in
[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:24.840]  July yeah I looked at a picture the other day I have age in those five years
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:29.560]  buddy this place has killed me well if the responsibility does age you yeah you
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:31.960]  haven't aged that much but you've aged a little bit I'm gonna show you a picture
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:35.080]  when we're done you had more of the Bob Big Boy haircut well I'm gonna grow it
[02:24:35.080 --> 02:24:40.240]  out again I'm I think it's good yeah whatever it's kind of long got more
[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:45.640]  hair than I do it's good no but going back here ten years ago ten years ago
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:49.040]  when I have a clip of it my film Road to Tyranny it showed Austin police in the
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:53.280]  elementary schools going you can get up to $200 for reporting crime here's your
[02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:58.160]  little credit card your little card that you get prizes for and and and then I
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:02.520]  went and got a card talk to parents and it even had stuff like look in your
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:06.680]  parents medicine cabinets that sounds like Fidel Castro to me it we did that
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:12.240]  yeah is that program still going no I wouldn't be a proponent to do that or
[02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:16.240]  maybe that's the IAISD police is that their own police department like that
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:20.600]  better they have their own no but I don't I mean I've got I've got a pull of
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:25.240]  any go up for it I don't think we ever had that program I don't think so we
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:29.400]  have it I mean we have a hot you know we have the different programs that if
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:34.360]  people you know the we tip type programs where if you sure witness to crime
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:38.800]  certain crimes you'll get a reward for yeah but how do you vet that because a
[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:42.440]  lot of times people who will will do it because they don't like somebody well
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:48.600]  you can't just convict somebody based on one hot you know one anonymous tip you've
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:52.040]  got to look for evidence yeah but we see the SWAT team cases where the retired
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:56.040]  insurance guy gets killed because you know the the informant says oh there's
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:26:00.680]  drugs in there yeah but that's that wasn't here no I know so we have we have
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:04.320]  protocol we follow here to make sure that we don't hit the wrong houses to make
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:08.880]  sure that we you know you don't just trust blindly that you have to build a
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:14.600]  case you know you just tip is but one piece it's kind of like everybody's
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:18.720]  worried about this the sea you know see something suspicious say something well
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:22.800]  if you see a bag sitting in a busy downtown street just sitting there that's
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:26.360]  suspicious you should say something what we don't know what's in that bag but
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:29.800]  terrorism you got a better chance of dying from a honeybee sting I've been at
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:34.400]  the airport now and left my bag to go over and get napkins or something 20
[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:37.920]  feet away and watch people starting to freak out I mean it's like people are
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:40.960]  just completely scared of everything well I don't know they're completely scared
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:44.240]  but I think these new see something see something adds you know it like shows a
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:49.080]  guy put his bag down the woman's like hey and then they got bomb teams out and
[02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:52.520]  robots but the reality is there are people who would like to do us harm and
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:57.560]  the bottom line is I think that as long as we we collectively as Americans are
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:01.880]  all responsible for the safety and security of our nation and that means
[02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:06.080]  that the reason Austin despite the fact that we have fewer police officers in
[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:11.040]  most cities our size per capita you know with the we have two thousand two
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:14.400]  officers per every thousand residents the national average for city big cities
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:18.240]  which is five hundred thousand more people is 2.7 per thousand the national
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:21.240]  average nationwide when you consider all 18 to 19 thousand police departments
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:25.560]  is 2.4 per resident or per thousand residents where it to poor thousand is
[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:31.000]  because we have a highly educated community an engaged community in a
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:34.560]  community that stands up for its neighbors and when they see something you
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:37.640]  know they see somebody breaking in they call when they know I know but I don't
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:40.920]  know if we need Janet Napolitano to tell us that we see something say
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:44.800]  something if I if I see something I do say something I remember when I lived
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:48.480]  over in South Austin this gas station went from being a nice gas station to
[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:51.240]  being horrible yeah and then I noticed there was no food on the shelves or
[02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:54.680]  anything being sold and they were running horrors out the front door and I
[02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:59.520]  pulled up to a cop and said hey that's obviously a whorehouse right there and I
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:02.280]  don't know whatever happens I ended up moving but you know that was right over
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:05.960]  there off William Cannon yeah hey the bottom line is that you know this
[02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:10.720]  community is our eyes and ears and you know when you when you worry about people
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:14.200]  trying to the vendetta saw a view for vendetta out there on one of your
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:18.440]  screens when it's a personal vendetta we're not going to make take action so
[02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:21.440]  what teams not going to go hit a house based on one guy said hey I think this
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:26.000]  is going on and if somebody says something makes it up and we demonstrate
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.840]  they made it up that's that's a false police reporter that's making a false
[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:32.440]  statement and that can lead to some consequences for that person so there
[02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:37.080]  are some checks and balances and something we take very seriously so I
[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:40.840]  mean I gave you the article here this is out of the Huffington Post but I give it
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:44.580]  to info wars you name it Senate votes to let military attain Americans and
[02:28:44.580 --> 02:28:50.120]  definitely White House threatens veto I mean and by the way that did pass the
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:52.960]  White House says they're going to veto it because they can already do it through
[02:28:52.960 --> 02:28:58.200]  the executive they say they don't need Congress yeah I think that there's just
[02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:01.840]  talking about American residents that are citizens are becoming any enemy
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:05.040]  combatant the combatants overseas or something yeah but but no no they've
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:09.480]  expanded it too domestically and just basically anybody they want well they
[02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:13.680]  there's there's there's three there's there are three different branches of
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:18.220]  government right executive legislative and I an executive and I think that
[02:29:18.220 --> 02:29:22.360]  judicial yeah and judicial and so I think the judiciary might have a
[02:29:22.360 --> 02:29:25.400]  different view and we'll see what they say but I mean as a police chief does
[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:30.560]  that creep you out to just indefinitely hold somebody without evidence and
[02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:35.020]  without a hearing yeah American citizen in our country yes I would have some
[02:29:35.020 --> 02:29:38.840]  concern with that yes you'd have some concern well I'm glad you would have
[02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:42.720]  some I'm pretty darned you always you don't ever want to say a hundred percent

[02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:50.840]  Savetta is here with this very nice guy and he is engaging with the public and
[02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:54.160]  he's saying that he doesn't want American citizens to be indefinitely
[02:33:54.160 --> 02:34:00.800]  detained KBR and I mentioned this earlier Kellogg Brown and Root of Halliburton
[02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:05.800]  and I had the links to the Wall Street Journal here built camps in 2006 for
[02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:11.240]  civil emergency links to all of it and then now they're putting out the secret
[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:16.360]  bids we were sent the information we have copies of it all choose prepare
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:19.640]  within 72 hours notice whenever they pull the trigger people are paid to be on
[02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:26.240]  notice to man the camps and it's got barbed wire it's got barricades it's
[02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:32.080]  got it all right there you're as bad as a lot of people are on those phones is
[02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:42.200]  that important is the must be at the bat phone yeah that's funny I'll tell you about later what is it I get
[02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:44.880]  do you really want to say it somebody says I think your appearance on Alex
[02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:51.320]  Jones is improving his ratings has it got me to tune in you're saying some of
[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:56.200]  your buddies from Los Angeles listen San Diego John Matters is a dear friend that
[02:34:56.200 --> 02:34:59.480]  worked with for a long time as a sergeant in the CHP that retired a couple
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:04.800]  years ago and the first time I peered with you within the next day I got a
[02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:09.880]  message from him and he was really happy to see me interacting with you and like
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:12.560]  well he knows me anyway so he knows where my heart's at well you know we
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:16.080]  give the number off a police to call in they they call in and around the
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:19.040]  country and confirm what we're saying about the feds and checkpoints and
[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:23.280]  things I mean there are now TSA checkpoints with the Army going on at
[02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:26.720]  least a dozen states would you like to drive up to an Army checkpoint in the
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:31.720]  middle of Tennessee probably not when I go to Mexico and visit it makes me very
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:36.920]  nervous when I see soldiers I mean this is a peaceful nation and I just don't
[02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:40.680]  see the need exactly in fact about three years ago I took my family down the
[02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:44.560]  southern Mexico to see some of the pyramids yeah and twice the nice buses
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:48.720]  tour buses we were on got stopped and the Army shook down the drivers yeah
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:54.000]  that's it's that that's I think we've got there plenty of professional law
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:57.840]  enforcement officers that I don't see anything on the horizon that we can't
[02:35:57.840 --> 02:36:01.640]  handle well then why do you think the feds are moving for this I don't know
[02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:04.440]  you'd have to ask them that question I'm not a fed well I know the feds have
[02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:09.440]  been taken over by those big mega banks are gonna implode the country now well
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:13.280]  I think the more you know what's funny is it does occupy Austin movement they
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:17.280]  know their skill they're screaming at us and and I'm like do you realize where
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:20.920]  the hired help we're no different than you are I mean our cops if you look at
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:24.520]  what's going on to public employee pensions they're trying to take those
[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:28.360]  away on a national level and I just really think that it's a shame and
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:32.800]  that's not why we're in debt that's not the big it's the derivatives it's it's
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:36.960]  it's one of some of my buddies working in police department in other state and I
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:41.640]  won't say which one it is but they're trying that what's happened is that they
[02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:46.720]  the lot of money was taken from the employee pension system so the local
[02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:49.760]  government can build all these other things that the these other things that
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:55.320]  want to do so they underfunded it right and then they turn around they blame the
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:37:01.080]  employees who they pay into the system they come to work every day they they
[02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:05.680]  no no Portugal is now taking people's private pension funds yeah so all these
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:09.040]  mainline conservatives they're like take all the pension funds the public ones
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:12.720]  wait till they have their private ones taken well what what people don't get is
[02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:16.640]  that you know you look and you attack public employee pensions when the
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:19.520]  economy's tanking because there's a lot of angry Americans out there and right
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:23.920]  fluce that's less money in the economy right and and it's easy to find people
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:28.880]  to turn into villains but it's all I think we got to be real careful because
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:32.240]  into the day we were all the hired help well we can debate pensions and all
[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:35.840]  this all day but if you have 1.5 quadrillion in fake derivatives these
[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:39.120]  banks made now and you know selling mortgages a hundred times and all this
[02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:43.640]  then that's the black hole that can't be paid back and the media keeps making it
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:47.240]  like it's pensions and things that are causing it they're a very small piece of
[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:55.200]  it that's extra you know I I I remember when they were making loans 125% loan to
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:58.760]  value you don't have to even show us what you're what your income you need
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:02.880]  to prove income come on down they made loans that they knew damn while they
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:07.000]  weren't supposed to make they knew that loans at some day that you know the the
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.840]  piper's gonna come on pipe in there nobody's gonna be able to pay and at the
[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:15.680]  end of the day we've all been held hold in the bag so you know it's it's it's a
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:19.280]  disgrace we like to make fun of the of Mexico and other countries but we're just
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:22.480]  a little bit more sophisticated here that's all well exactly and talking to
[02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:26.880]  the mortgage experts that was only one level of the fraud once they had that
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:31.160]  mortgage they would then leverage that out in some cases a hundred times sell it
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:34.400]  and resell it and everybody's making money there are everybody's getting
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:38.000]  commissions everybody's lining their pockets and at the end of the day the
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:41.120]  American taxpayer got held holding the bag and there's been very little
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:45.760]  accountability if I apply for a loan and I put false information on there I've
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:49.400]  committed fraud I go to jail or I've committed perjury depending on how the
[02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:55.440]  wording is on the loan app in my humble opinion is if I give out a loan
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:59.360]  knowing darn well that you aren't really qualified for that loan knowing that
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:03.600]  that loan is going to eventually end up in default I don't see how that's not
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:08.560]  fraud and you know I can see why people are angry I'm one of them and so that's
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:12.800]  why I don't understand why people try to villainize police officers when you know
[02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:15.360]  we're all the higher to help we're all trying to hear it out to feed our
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:18.280]  families and we're all trying to make an honest look no no I understand all that
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:22.160]  people talk about police officers all day they talk about the good the bad and
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:26.920]  the ugly because in history when things collapse the police are the ones that
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:30.800]  are going to be asked to go out and do and the leadership of the government are
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:34.580]  bunch crooks I can show you 10 clips of them admitting they grow the opium in
[02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:38.040]  Afghanistan why are they doing that because Pat gentlemen and others were
[02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:40.800]  gonna blow the whistle so they murdered him and I said it was a murder at the
[02:39:40.800 --> 02:39:45.520]  time it's come out it's a murder you know private Lynch she didn't save all
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:48.480]  those people and when they started speaking out they murdered her people
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:52.960]  on her team and then she had to come out what I'm saying is criminals run the
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:56.360]  highest levels of government and they've got all these well-meaning people that
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:40:01.320]  work for them lower down in the system and they have signed us on to 1,500
[02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:04.920]  trillion globally the American people and European people to to the bank's
[02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:08.240]  debts and I'm saying we've got to write those off because they're impossible to
[02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:12.480]  pay they're going to feed everything into that no amount of writing tickets no
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:16.040]  amount of revenue generation no amount of new franchise taxes that Rick Perry
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:21.200]  passed that I got to pay no amount of this stuff will ever turn it around it
[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:27.040]  is it look Bernie Madoff created the Nasdaq Bernie Madoff is a crook and he
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:31.040]  pointed out from prison in the New York Magazine article he said I did what
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:36.000]  everybody else did you know what it's true at his level he's nothing MF global
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:40.360]  former New Jersey governor for medical man sacks he knowingly took 50,000 plus
[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:44.320]  private brokerage accounts that are sequestered other word is segregated
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:47.680]  federal law you can't take him he just took him a month and a half ago and
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:52.960]  didn't get in trouble I mean do you feel safe having a government like that I
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:58.720]  would just say that I think there's room for improvement in government at all
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:03.880]  levels including state local county it's like there's room for improvement in my
[02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:07.320]  police department you know we're not perfect and every day I always tell my
[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:11.880]  people we need to strive to do better and I think that it's doing better
[02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:14.440]  starts with recognition that things aren't perfect they're not perfect
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:19.120]  anywhere and that we should she sees each day as an opportunity a little better
[02:41:19.120 --> 02:41:23.480]  and that's what we try to do at the Austin Police Department yeah well where
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:29.080]  do you see where do you see things going then under federalization what's your
[02:41:29.080 --> 02:41:35.560]  view of the Tenth Amendment I really believe strongly in states rights you
[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:41.680]  know one of the things that I talked about when when we had this so-called
[02:41:41.680 --> 02:41:48.040]  sanctuary city sanctuary city debate at the state legislature last year is that
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:53.480]  I found that it was kind of in this ingenious for a state legislature that
[02:41:53.480 --> 02:41:58.440]  screams and yells at Washington about state state rights on a regular basis
[02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:03.920]  then turn around try to dictate to the cities local municipalities that
[02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:09.840]  understand what the needs are in that local community what the priorities are
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:13.680]  for that local community then turn around say that we they we can't manage
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:17.080]  our own resources as a police department or as a city we can't set our own
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:21.880]  priorities I really believe that state rights are important and and it's kind
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:25.120]  of interesting when I look at some of the legislation legislative policies are
[02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:30.480]  passed around the country by legislatures that and legislative bodies that
[02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:33.880]  always speak about state rights screaming yell at Washington about
[02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:36.520]  state rights and then turn around and do there's the cities and counties the
[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:41.040]  same thing that they accuse the federal government to do of doing to them well
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:43.800]  sure I mean you see the same type of corruption everywhere it's just that when
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:47.440]  you get really monolithic and powerful looking you can be expressed in even
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:51.840]  bigger ways that's what's so dangerous about the federal government but but
[02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:55.840]  look I mean certainly you read the different ADL Southern Poverty Law
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:42:59.760]  Center reports in fact I think I'm from memory you've gone and spoken at the ADL
[02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:06.040]  haven't you and gotten awards and stuff I know most policemen do my issue is you
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:09.400]  know the ADL even came out in the tech blend back the Southern Poverty Law
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:13.320]  Center you had to hear a few years ago were they listed returning veterans as
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:17.480]  the number one terror threat I don't remember seeing that in that Homeland
[02:43:17.480 --> 02:43:22.160]  Security report for move this up well yeah they they contributed to it but it
[02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:25.960]  was a federal report we can put it on screen just type in veterans number one
[02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:31.080]  terror threat info wars.com or type in AP whatever the point is just
[02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:34.080]  hypothetically let's say it's true which it is but I know you want to see it in
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:38.640]  front of you which is good trust but verify what do you think of the
[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:42.800]  government okay have you heard about the different Explorer Scout programs
[02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:46.680]  where they train the 14 year olds in every drill to take on disgruntled
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:51.080]  veterans and kill them I can tell you that I have an explorer that I started
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:55.920]  Explorer Scouts here when I got here in 2007 because we have a tremendous
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:59.800]  problem with high school dropout and teenage pregnancy and everything else in
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:04.680]  the state in the city and we don't teach our explorers how to kill anybody we
[02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:09.000]  teach them about respect teach about the law that's good chief let's pull up
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:13.840]  New York Times for him right now New York Times it has a whole photo gallery of
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:20.120]  of Explorer Scouts training to take on quote disgruntled Iraq war veterans and
[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:25.600]  kill them we're gonna pull it up. Which screen this one over here this
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:28.680]  wasn't preset I'm just going along they have to pull it off okay it'll take a
[02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:33.440]  second. We have Scouts here but I think that with so many young people that
[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:39.360]  men and women that have been in combat now for Scouts trained to fight terrorists
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:43.200]  and more first line of the article they take on a disgruntled Iraq war veteran
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:46.600]  and kill him. What kind of Scouts are those? That's in New York that's in
[02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:50.920]  Imperial California. Yeah that's it's all over the country. Well I'd like to see
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:55.040]  that we don't do that here. I'm not kidding I mean I'm just saying if you
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:58.600]  want to know why I'm concerned I've been to urban warfare drills and witness
[02:44:58.600 --> 02:45:04.000]  Marines training to take on American guns. But is that urban warfare drill
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:09.560]  designed by the Marine Corps to fight here or is it to fight in Iraq? No no no
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:14.000]  the role players are Americans. They say where are you from I'm from
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:18.040]  San Francisco where'd you get the weapon and then the PR guys like you're not
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:21.040]  supposed to be here Jones because I would you know get into like the training
[02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:24.440]  area and then they would suddenly not want me to see it. I've got all this on
[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:28.200]  tape. I gotta see that. Do you have an extra copy? I'm gonna give it all to you
[02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:32.960]  here. Here's police state four the rise of FEMA. Okay that's all yours that's the
[02:45:32.960 --> 02:45:37.680]  latest. I'll write you a review. Well some of these are really old. I'm gonna give
[02:45:37.680 --> 02:45:41.720]  you all of my family. I've seen some of them I believe it or not. In the
[02:45:41.720 --> 02:45:45.640]  intelligence unit you guys are in there. We are. I mean do you have people on the
[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:50.920]  big screen you go this is the main enemy. No no. And then you know I'm not that
[02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:55.080]  important. You're not tonight. We like you. I'm just a minor like yes my minor
[02:45:55.080 --> 02:45:58.960]  enemy. Like I said I actually listen to you and read your stuff. I know you're
[02:45:58.960 --> 02:46:02.480]  very very nice. Hey you actually come in here and talk to me. Yeah three times
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:07.760]  now. Used to a couple of police chiefs ago. Who was the one who looked like he
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:14.840]  was a corpse? I forgot he was bald. Anyways I would I went over there to
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:17.680]  some open house thing where they have the tanks and the armored vehicles and
[02:46:17.680 --> 02:46:20.520]  everything and I just tried to ask him a question all the other cops bumped into
[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:24.440]  me. Get back get back. So I mean you are nice. I'm pretty approachable. I'm too
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:28.080]  my stuff thinks I'm too approachable. But you know what I you know what at the
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:32.200]  end of the day I work for the people. You know I mean I may be an employee of
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:36.160]  the city but I work for the people and my bosses have heard me say this. This
[02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:40.040]  community has heard me say this. I'd rather lose my job than not do my job.
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:42.680]  And well I have to say that you're probably the most popular police chief
[02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:46.440]  we've ever had. Well thanks. Since I've lived here 20 years. Yeah. Talking about
[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:50.040]  these these guys on your staff they don't like you coming to this show. No
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:54.320]  actually they'd like to be coming here and crazy the Anthony Pallido there's
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:58.200]  one of your fans you want to come by and say hi and meet you. Oh he's gonna get
[02:46:58.200 --> 02:47:03.280]  on a FEMA less now. That's all right. That's all right. Well I know it's I'm
[02:47:03.280 --> 02:47:06.440]  not living up to what he thought he'd see here. I'm just depressed watching this
[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:10.400]  happen. So I mean I just hope that police chiefs around the country will
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:13.840]  uphold the Bill of Rights and Constitution. Well I can tell you I spent a
[02:47:13.840 --> 02:47:18.280]  lot of time I meet with my colleagues through in the major state chiefs
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:23.200]  meetings around the country and it would it would take a lot for us to say we
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:28.320]  wanted the military to be patrolling our streets. It would take the sky will
[02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:34.160]  actually literally have to be falling before we would say that. So we we are
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:37.400]  peace officers. That's why you write peace officer on our ID cards to remind
[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:41.240]  our officers that we're all about keeping the peace, maintaining peace,
[02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:45.520]  restoring peace and securing the peace here. I think that American law
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:51.080]  enforcement although not perfect and not equally as good around the country. You
[02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:53.720]  know as people like to say we're a bad police power officer I like to tell them
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:56.720]  you know the reason you think we're bad is you have no point of reference. I'll
[02:47:56.720 --> 02:48:00.040]  take them on field trips where I can tell you they'll be very thankful to be
[02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:04.600]  police. I'll tell you we're as bad as New York City. Well I'm not going to tell you
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:07.960]  which ones I think but I will tell you that I tell my critics if you have no
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:11.080]  point of reference you can't appreciate what you truly have. I believe. Have you
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:14.760]  been around New York cops? I've been in all over the country. I mean some of them
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:18.960]  call in and some of them are nice but I mean you talk about just generally. Yeah
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:22.800]  I mean it's literally like gang members in uniforms. Well I mean they've got a
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:25.800]  lot of good police officers like I'm sure there's some that aren't. Yeah but you
[02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:29.840]  know that's what you're talking about. New York is unbelievable. I've talked to
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:32.960]  Austin Police that have asked directions and been told do I look like a phone
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:37.440]  book? Well yeah I've experienced some that before from some departments but I
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:41.280]  always tell people they take a look at who the departmental justice at some of
[02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:44.740]  the departments are under investigation and end up in consent decrees. Those are
[02:48:44.740 --> 02:48:49.600]  bad departments. We were investigated for four years as a department because the
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:54.960]  community demanded an investigation. We provided everything. They took a look at
[02:48:54.960 --> 02:48:59.720]  us up and down side to side and despite the fact that that same departmental
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:03.840]  justice has placed other police agencies under consent decrees because they found
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:07.920]  patterns and practices of unconstitutional policing or use of
[02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:12.040]  excessive force. I'm very proud of the fact that our department withstood that
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:16.800]  scrutiny that we actually embraced the scrutiny that we actually considered the
[02:49:16.800 --> 02:49:20.200]  DOJ as a extra set of eyes and opportunity for us to do better and I
[02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:24.880]  really believe that now in 2011 quickly approaching 2012 we're a better
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:28.600]  department as a result of going through that process and I'm and I can say the
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:31.000]  straight face I believe the police department is better today than it was in
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:35.880]  2007 before I got here. Well I have to agree but I still don't like the police
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:39.360]  taking blood. I know but you know what you've been around you know you say your
[02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:43.400]  public company number one have we ever taken your blood? No. Have we ever stopped
[02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:49.640]  you in taking you to jail? No. Okay there you have it. If you obey the law if you
[02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:54.180]  don't drink and drive you don't have to worry about us. Quite frankly when you
[02:49:54.180 --> 02:49:57.840]  sign up for your driver's license you write implied consent that you agreed
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:03.120]  it. No I understand all that I'm just saying that you know looking at all
[02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:08.560]  this what you just said though the Department of Justice I happened to
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:13.120]  know and it's covered in this film the noble lie with the survivors that the
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:16.280]  head of the Justice Department was the deputy head of the Justice Department
[02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:20.920]  and was intimately involved covering up this false flag terror event. Okay chief
[02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:25.160]  I also I haven't seen that. It's a new documentary I'm selling it I didn't make it
[02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:34.280]  but I'm in it. The point is is that the point is that Holder got caught running
[02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:39.120]  a false flag. He got caught shipping guns into Mexico to blame it on the
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:43.960]  Second Amendment and even when he got caught he tried to use it against the
[02:50:43.960 --> 02:50:48.840]  Second Amendment. I mean I've interviewed the police involved in Oklahoma City who
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:52.160]  saw the feds. I've interviewed the people that saw the feds planting the
[02:50:52.160 --> 02:50:57.200]  bombs. Okay the feds blew up Oklahoma City and that's what I'm telling you the
[02:50:57.200 --> 02:51:01.040]  Justice Department came down here to make sure we were good. We'll be right back.

[02:54:39.880 --> 02:54:45.560]  the days are bright well chief Ardee Savetta is our guest and he's been nice
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:49.240]  to come in he's gonna go into the nightly news with me this evening but I'm
[02:54:49.240 --> 02:54:53.280]  gonna tape it and then air it next week we'll have a double dose today kind of
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:57.360]  space it out and it's important for us to talk to the police and it's important
[02:54:57.360 --> 02:55:02.200]  for us to talk to the military because as we've documented today the the the
[02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:05.320]  foreign banks that have conquered Europe they now admit that through fraud have
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:10.600]  conquered us and they want to try to use this country as an engine of this new
[02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:14.880]  world order and so we need to talk to the police bottom line because the system
[02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:19.160]  does want to create a separation between the police and population I know for
[02:55:19.160 --> 02:55:22.720]  a long time policing was thin blue line kind of you know we got a stick together
[02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:26.600]  the public doesn't care about us I have noticed that you have tried to reverse
[02:55:26.600 --> 02:55:30.080]  that and a lot of police chiefs aren't so basically in closing where did you come
[02:55:30.080 --> 02:55:33.400]  from I mean you know how did you become the awesome police chief what forms you
[02:55:33.400 --> 02:55:37.720]  and why are you trying to actually have the police interface with the public and
[02:55:37.720 --> 02:55:41.560]  not have that separation does see a lot of departments actually want that well I
[02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:45.960]  think because you know my background you know my my my communist background from
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:52.740]  a totalitarian government I really see I think police policing is a big important
[02:55:52.740 --> 02:55:57.800]  part of democracy and of freedom you know we have to do it right and I think
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:01.560]  in order for us to be successful as police officers we have to have the
[02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:08.800]  trust and support and cooperation of the community that we serve and so I spent a
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:13.200]  lot of hours every week trying to build that trust and support and one of the
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:16.760]  things I think people realize from about me is that we're not always going to
[02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:19.640]  agree on everything but I think that most people know that my heart's in the
[02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:23.600]  right place and that's important yeah well certainly spoken from the heart
[02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:27.400]  there what about you got cut off by the break chief when I was bringing up the
[02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:32.560]  Justice Department our little friendly Oklahoma City bombers and of course that
[02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:37.320]  that's quite a claim but I can prove it but I mean mr. Holder's been caught
[02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:41.080]  shipping the guns into Mexico and caught perjuring himself so how are they
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:46.120]  gonna come down to Austin and basically you know check under our fingernails
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:53.680]  well the bottom line is that they have found unconstitutional practices or
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:58.040]  practices in other cities where they've actually sued police departments to do
[02:56:58.040 --> 02:57:03.040]  better and that's like when the police departments the Ku Klux Klan or something
[02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:08.320]  well in the 60s you know the city of LA was put under a consent decree New
[02:57:08.320 --> 02:57:12.400]  Orleans I believe is already in a consent decree I think that Miami in a while
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:16.120]  back got sued I'm not sure which departments but I know they've been
[02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:19.840]  quite a few around the country so the bottom line is it's not like they come
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:24.200]  and just rubber stamp local police agencies you know it's kind of so I'm
[02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:27.320]  proud of the fact that we were we were able to withstand that scrutiny because I
[02:57:27.320 --> 02:57:32.120]  think that although we're not perfect as an organization the collective heart of
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:36.520]  our department is good we have good people and we're all trying to do the
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:40.360]  right but I get federal oversight but then that the states more and more have
[02:57:40.360 --> 02:57:44.960]  no oversight how do we used to back when we had that our states elected the
[02:57:44.960 --> 02:57:48.040]  senators that the legislators did and they got rid of that with the 17th
[02:57:48.040 --> 02:57:52.760]  amendment so how do we have a check and balance on the feds well I think that we
[02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:55.840]  all have to pay attention to what's going on I mean I'll be honest with you one
[02:57:55.840 --> 02:58:00.200]  of the things I think has really been tough for this country is that we've
[02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:04.120]  carved up carved up congressional districts so they're all safe for
[02:58:04.120 --> 02:58:08.800]  either the left the you know the D's or the yards but they're all safe the
[02:58:08.800 --> 02:58:13.680]  majority of Americans were pragmatic people we like to find the the middle
[02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:17.440]  ground and so I think that one of the things that has made it challenging for
[02:58:17.440 --> 02:58:21.520]  us as Americans is that you know what when you don't have to answer the voters
[02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:25.960]  because you're in a safe seat you get to have extreme views and you don't have to
[02:58:25.960 --> 02:58:30.880]  be pragmatic and you don't have to try to find that common ground with everybody
[02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:34.320]  and so I think one of the things that we that I would like to see as an American
[02:58:34.320 --> 02:58:38.240]  is to have congressional districts that are tell what finish your statement back
[02:58:38.240 --> 02:58:47.080]  in one minute we'll be right back thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live
[02:58:47.080 --> 02:58:55.520]  dot com today hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century
[02:58:55.520 --> 02:59:00.320]  alone this is our last chance to not relive history as they're finishing off
[02:59:00.320 --> 02:59:05.320]  this agenda that we pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home turn
[02:59:05.320 --> 02:59:10.200]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[02:59:10.200 --> 02:59:15.320]  sharks I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[02:59:15.320 --> 02:59:19.880]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:59:19.880 --> 02:59:24.560]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:59:24.560 --> 02:59:28.600]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[02:59:28.600 --> 02:59:32.280]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who to make the check out to
[02:59:32.280 --> 02:59:37.360]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[02:59:37.360 --> 02:59:43.440]  a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info

[02:59:48.480 --> 02:59:51.440]  planet dot TV
[02:59:51.440 --> 02:59:57.360]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.360 --> 03:00:21.680]  broadcasting network network
[03:00:21.680 --> 03:00:25.480]  all right I gotta run over there and get you in the TV interview because you
[03:00:25.480 --> 03:00:28.280]  gotta leave in like 15 minutes but I didn't want you to be cut off their
[03:00:28.280 --> 03:00:32.040]  police chief Arte Sveida them go back to the rebroadcast from the first hour
[03:00:32.040 --> 03:00:35.960]  with the FEMA camps in America now being manned they're now activating them
[03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:39.160]  that shows you they're getting ready to really implode things just incredible
[03:00:39.160 --> 03:00:44.600]  information but we're here you know talking to the awesome police chief and
[03:00:44.600 --> 03:00:48.920]  you were finishing up a point the point is we're trying to do the right thing
[03:00:48.920 --> 03:00:52.600]  that's it now but you were talking about the legislative districts oh yeah
[03:00:52.600 --> 03:00:58.000]  that was that part oh yeah I just I feel that person I like to see every
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:03.680]  congressional district be competitive that way that it's a lot easier to when
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:07.400]  we're not happy get rid of people we're not happy with their performance what
[03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:12.440]  do you think about the two-party dictatorship well that's part of the
[03:01:12.440 --> 03:01:16.960]  problem when when they divide up the Congress for their safe districts for
[03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:20.880]  both parties that's when I think it makes a little bit more challenging for
[03:01:20.880 --> 03:01:25.120]  our voices to be heard what do you think of Ron Paul I like small things yes to
[03:01:25.120 --> 03:01:28.840]  say some of the things I agree with some of the things I don't but he's he's fun
[03:01:28.840 --> 03:01:33.680]  to watch in closing I haven't talked to you since the Joe Stack thing and that
[03:01:33.680 --> 03:01:40.000]  was certainly a tragedy but what was it like being at that event well I the
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:43.240]  media wanted to turn that into they wanted me to use a terrorist you know
[03:01:43.240 --> 03:01:47.440]  since the terrorist thing so we can we can scare the heck out of everybody and
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:51.640]  my number one goal that day was once I figured out we figured out that appeared
[03:01:51.640 --> 03:01:56.680]  to be one person that was angry that was my my cell phone somebody's texting me
[03:01:56.680 --> 03:02:00.960]  what I'm sorry I forgot to put them oh I don't care once maybe think where's my
[03:02:00.960 --> 03:02:05.280]  cell phone once we figure once we figured out early on that investigation
[03:02:05.280 --> 03:02:09.880]  appeared to be an isolated incident I felt that my number one responsibility was
[03:02:09.880 --> 03:02:13.680]  to ensure and reassure Americans they didn't have to worry about a bunch of
[03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:17.040]  little small planes went all over the country crashing into buildings yeah well
[03:02:17.040 --> 03:02:20.640]  I do have a love-hate relationship with it because you're a nice guy you come in
[03:02:20.640 --> 03:02:24.000]  you make a lot of good points you're charismatic you you have a good vibe I
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  don't feel like you're a bad guy when I'm around you not here like Ram Poobah
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:30.560]  judging you it's just that you don't have that normal you know fake
[03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:34.400]  authoritarian thing that a lot of police chiefs try to put on it's just you know
[03:02:34.400 --> 03:02:37.760]  but I did notice that the media did try to get you to turn it into a fear
[03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:42.000]  mongering Al Qaeda's under every table let's get hysterical and actually if
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:45.800]  that would have gotten hyped up bigger copycats probably would have started
[03:02:45.800 --> 03:02:50.840]  doing it and and I know that some people tried I got some criticism because
[03:02:50.840 --> 03:02:53.480]  they said had that been a Middle Eastern person I would have termed it
[03:02:53.480 --> 03:02:57.680]  terrorism and I can tell you this like I told some of these advocacy groups that
[03:02:57.680 --> 03:03:02.680]  absolutely not it had nothing to do with the race it was basically you caught
[03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:06.240]  whatever you want but I'm not going to use a term well he went postal with an
[03:03:06.240 --> 03:03:10.040]  airplane he went postal with an airplane he was angry at the Catholic
[03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:13.920]  Church he was angry at his own family burnt down his own his own house this
[03:03:13.920 --> 03:03:19.480]  man was angry at the world and and he used a word terrorism that day it would
[03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:23.400]  have created a lot of anxiety for a lot of Americans and I wasn't about to do
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:28.720]  that when I knew was an isolated in this incident by one crazy guy who went
[03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:33.240]  postal well that's that's certainly good news that you did that you know Rob do
[03:03:33.240 --> 03:03:38.320]  has been a lot of bands and actually Joe Stack was years ago in a band and he
[03:03:38.320 --> 03:03:42.920]  said the guy was really nice I've heard that but didn't really talk he said he
[03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:46.520]  was nice showed up did a good job playing the music no is Janet Reno
