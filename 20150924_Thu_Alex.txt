[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:12.040 --> 00:19.600]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.600 --> 00:41.080]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on
[00:41.080 --> 00:49.560]  this live worldwide Thursday edition the 24th day of September we have our
[00:49.560 --> 00:56.480]  reporters joining us from the road as they cover the Pope's visit to the
[00:56.480 --> 01:02.720]  United States David Knight and Jacarie Jackson will be joining us with updates
[01:02.720 --> 01:07.840]  at the bottom of this hour in about 30 minutes Leo Zagami will join us for the
[01:07.840 --> 01:12.720]  first time on my radio broadcast he's been a guest on the nightly news before
[01:12.720 --> 01:18.080]  he is quite the Vatican researcher and he'll give us an Italian perspective
[01:18.080 --> 01:23.280]  from someone who's been a Catholic and also a high-level mason on what he calls
[01:23.280 --> 01:27.840]  the blackmail and coup that's happened inside the Vatican which even one in
[01:27.840 --> 01:32.800]  guardian reported on two years after Leo Zagami began to talk about so you
[01:32.800 --> 01:35.560]  can say what you want about Leo Zagami has a lot of supporters a lot of
[01:35.560 --> 01:41.360]  detractors I never had him on because I thought it was speculation and pretty
[01:41.360 --> 01:45.800]  far out but most of what he said has now come frighteningly true so his
[01:45.800 --> 01:50.240]  credibility level goes up quite a bit my eyes he'll be joining us in the second
[01:50.240 --> 01:57.560]  hour today and then Dane Whittington of geoengineering watch who made CBS News
[01:57.560 --> 02:02.360]  the LA Times other publications as a larger and larger percentage of
[02:02.360 --> 02:07.440]  Californians believe the drought is engineered well we know there's geo
[02:07.440 --> 02:10.560]  engineering going on in California that's admitted it's going on all over the
[02:10.560 --> 02:14.200]  country but really in California one of the most intensive areas and we've
[02:14.200 --> 02:18.320]  interviewed a lot of meteorologists and others that say they believe the weathered
[02:18.320 --> 02:22.560]  patterns what's happening to precipitation is unnatural so they're
[02:22.560 --> 02:25.520]  trying to call it a conspiracy theory it's not we're gonna talk about geo
[02:25.520 --> 02:31.240]  engineering coming up in the third hour in fact I just said yesterday that I
[02:31.240 --> 02:37.000]  wanted this guest on but I want to back this guest up and I know that I was
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.960]  gonna make a film on geoengineering we never finished and I know that we have
[02:40.960 --> 02:45.520]  huge files all over the office with the patents and the admissions and the
[02:45.520 --> 02:50.200]  meteorologists and the weather weapons experts all saying it's contrived and
[02:50.200 --> 02:56.440]  just huge amounts of evidence the geoengineering clips from the different
[02:56.440 --> 03:02.080]  government conferences the Arab countries greening the desert with
[03:02.080 --> 03:07.080]  electromagnetic towers they've set up give our great nightly news director
[03:07.080 --> 03:11.480]  Rob do could throw a bunch of that together for me in a few clips I should
[03:11.480 --> 03:15.240]  have thought of this yesterday and give it a more time I want to present some of
[03:15.240 --> 03:19.880]  that the third hour when this guest joins us so I'm not just here saying that I
[03:19.880 --> 03:24.760]  want to give you the actual patents the actual international treaties on
[03:24.760 --> 03:29.000]  weather weapons I want to actually give you the newscast with the weathermen and
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.760]  women say it's clearly manipulated I want to just throw a small maybe 1% of
[03:33.760 --> 03:38.880]  the evidence at you and by the way I'm not being sarcastic the reason I never
[03:38.880 --> 03:43.680]  released I was gonna call dark skies or Skyfall and that was a couple years
[03:43.680 --> 03:46.880]  before the James Bond movie came out called Skyfall we even announced the
[03:46.880 --> 03:53.240]  name was Skyfall is because there was too much out it went deeper and deeper and
[03:53.240 --> 03:57.680]  was more insane and more documented and more crazy and I kept just saying get
[03:57.680 --> 04:03.520]  more get more get more fly here fly there and I I should just put out films
[04:03.520 --> 04:06.760]  more quickly and they'll still be good they'll still be informative I
[04:06.760 --> 04:10.120]  literally used to just to churn films out because I just wanted to get the
[04:10.120 --> 04:16.240]  info out I've gotten more neurotic over the years and just never put out Obama
[04:16.240 --> 04:24.520]  deception to never put out Skyfall never put out I haven't made a film in five
[04:24.520 --> 04:28.800]  years now we've made lots of many documentaries and done thousands of
[04:28.800 --> 04:35.880]  videos and reach more people exponentially it's just that I was here
[04:35.880 --> 04:38.320]  brainstorming as I was thinking about what I wanted the third hour and
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.960]  realized I probably got an hour and a half of a powerful film made right now
[04:42.960 --> 04:47.640]  and Rob Jacobson's computer 100 feet from me and I ought to just start releasing
[04:47.640 --> 04:51.920]  this stuff on the nightly news they don't have fanfare about it nobody cares I
[04:51.920 --> 04:55.160]  have fanfare about a film and it's released and 50 million people watch
[04:55.160 --> 05:00.560]  it you know it's just it's all part of a formulae we'll be back a new global news
[05:00.560 --> 05:05.480]  fact-checking project was announced yesterday and it will be funded by two
[05:05.480 --> 05:10.760]  organizations with close ties to the Obama White House the project which
[05:10.760 --> 05:15.920]  says it will be focused on holding public officials accountable is funded by
[05:15.920 --> 05:20.800]  grants from the Omidia Network and the National Endowment for Democracy the
[05:20.800 --> 05:25.600]  Omidia Network is headed up by eBay founder Pierre Omidiaire visitor logs
[05:25.600 --> 05:29.920]  reveal that Omidiaire has visited the White House a half a dozen times since
[05:29.920 --> 05:36.120]  2009 the National Endowment for Democracy NED is infamously known for their
[05:36.120 --> 05:41.960]  role in uprisings attempted coups and acts of regime change so it's operation
[05:41.960 --> 05:46.720]  mockingbird all over again as these connections clearly illustrate how the
[05:46.720 --> 05:52.200]  White House funded news fact-checking project will undoubtedly be yet another

[08:22.560 --> 08:29.080]  resistance it's alex jones
[08:29.080 --> 08:33.160]  well the Pope has now addressed Congress and I have a transcript of it
[08:33.160 --> 08:37.840]  we're gonna be going over he said that if there is a stranger amongst us we must
[08:37.840 --> 08:44.600]  take care of them of course Saudi Arabia won't take one single refugee one
[08:44.600 --> 08:53.200]  single migrant either will Qatar or any of these other rich Gulf states and the
[08:53.200 --> 08:57.680]  West advertises come to America come to Europe everything's gonna be free come
[08:57.680 --> 09:02.840]  here that's called stealing from the taxpayers and it's part of global
[09:02.840 --> 09:06.960]  government it's part of collapsing borders it's part of planetary tyranny
[09:06.960 --> 09:10.480]  and you're gonna be hearing a lot about this little girl she's gonna end up
[09:10.480 --> 09:15.160]  being called the Pope girl like the Obama girl I'm scared they'll take my
[09:15.160 --> 09:19.400]  family five-year-old daughter of illegal immigrants is blessed by Pope
[09:19.400 --> 09:25.160]  Francis after breaking through security barricades hours before he says mass in
[09:25.160 --> 09:28.560]  Spanish and if you watch the footage or look at the photos that we're gonna be
[09:28.560 --> 09:32.560]  showing on screen go ahead and roll through those and show folks those you
[09:32.560 --> 09:41.360]  can see in the first photo the police are leading her through the barricade to
[09:41.360 --> 09:50.200]  the Pope totally and completely absolutely Vatican Ford Foundation
[09:50.200 --> 09:55.200]  staged just like if they want to demonize somebody they say Saddam was
[09:55.200 --> 10:01.560]  stomping baby's brains out from incubators none of it was true when they
[10:01.560 --> 10:04.960]  turn ISIS loose in your city and they run around murdering and raping and
[10:04.960 --> 10:09.960]  killing you'll never see it on the news but when they want to tear jerk and sell
[10:09.960 --> 10:14.960]  open borders and to coincide with the optics they stage these events and they
[10:14.960 --> 10:20.720]  use the sweet little girl who says please don't take my mommy and daddy away
[10:20.720 --> 10:24.600]  because she was born here they came here and had her and so it's a giant
[10:24.600 --> 10:29.560]  anchor baby advertisement and I'm nothing against this little girl clearly
[10:29.560 --> 10:34.480]  screamed and looked at probably for months ahead of time very nice sweet
[10:34.480 --> 10:41.280]  loving eyes of her parents her dad her mom it's an anchor baby advertisement
[10:41.280 --> 10:46.600]  totally plotted just like a Coca-Cola commercial or a Victoria's Secret
[10:46.600 --> 10:51.520]  commercial during the Super Bowl it is a hundred percent cold blooded scripted
[10:51.520 --> 10:56.920]  the Pope Mobile being a fiat right as a huge fiat advertisement rolls out
[10:56.920 --> 11:04.440]  remember about six years ago the Super Bowl they had the Green Police ad where
[11:04.440 --> 11:08.080]  it showed police in white and green uniforms arresting people for their
[11:08.080 --> 11:12.000]  hot tub being too hot their house being too cool or the wrong light bulbs or
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.880]  their card on having the proper emissions and I said that's paid for as
[11:15.880 --> 11:20.960]  product placement to condition you those are the real uniforms globally they have
[11:20.960 --> 11:27.080]  global treaties that they end up wearing from Australia to San Francisco
[11:27.080 --> 11:32.120]  California and then sure enough a year later they bragged in the San Francisco
[11:32.120 --> 11:36.000]  Chronicle that yes we were paid by the government and they paid for the
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.040]  advertisement to prepare the public this is what we're really going to do now I'm
[11:42.040 --> 11:47.120]  not bragging that I knew it was staged and a moron would know that but the
[11:47.120 --> 11:52.760]  general public is in a trance so they see this little girl brought to the Pope
[11:52.760 --> 11:57.160]  does he go to Mexico City and have a Guatemalan immigrant run up to him and
[11:57.160 --> 12:03.920]  say please let me into Mexico no one year forced labor in Mexico you're
[12:03.920 --> 12:09.040]  caught illegally coming into the country unless you get on a train hang on to it
[12:09.040 --> 12:13.200]  illegally and don't get off then you're allowed to go to El Norte or the Great
[12:13.200 --> 12:21.160]  North the North this is a concerted globalist plan to turn America into a
[12:21.160 --> 12:26.600]  third-world country drive down wages I did a Facebook mentions peace this
[12:26.600 --> 12:32.120]  morning and some of the comments were oh you're against the migrants coming into
[12:32.120 --> 12:36.840]  Europe in the US well I bet you weren't you know basically against the wars no I
[12:36.840 --> 12:42.320]  was totally against bombing Iraq and Syria and Libya and all the rest of it I
[12:42.320 --> 12:47.240]  was against overthrowing Muammar Gaddafi who was stabilizing Africa I was
[12:47.240 --> 12:50.600]  against putting al-Qaeda in charge because I knew it would lead to the
[12:50.600 --> 12:54.280]  collapse of the Middle East and the flooding of the West and the clash of
[12:54.280 --> 12:59.160]  civilizations that Dick Cheney wrote about in the September 20th PNAC 2001
[12:59.160 --> 13:05.160]  rebuilding America's defenses documents yes I know full well but see I'm
[13:05.160 --> 13:08.760]  beyond one-dimensional thinking where I'm against the war but then I'm for
[13:08.760 --> 13:16.320]  having open borders the same globalist that orchestrated the war the wars on
[13:16.320 --> 13:20.640]  record to destabilize and fun of the year of spring to put radical Islamists
[13:20.640 --> 13:26.120]  in are the very ones now saying we'll pay for you to have your baby we'll pay for
[13:26.120 --> 13:31.320]  welfare we'll give you housing come to Europe then we'll give you voter cards
[13:31.320 --> 13:34.520]  then we'll give you a driver's license and once they do that though they keep
[13:34.520 --> 13:41.920]  them in ghettos the police in Germany are basically all German they contain them
[13:41.920 --> 13:47.760]  and use them as a political weapon for low-cost labor basically slave labor but
[13:47.760 --> 13:51.960]  also as a political weapon for the socialist so the globalist are screwing
[13:51.960 --> 13:56.520]  the Arabs over the Muslims over the Mexicans over the Chinese over the
[13:56.520 --> 14:00.840]  American doesn't matter whatever they're for you've got to be against and then
[14:00.840 --> 14:05.880]  you can politically geopolitically economically culturally spiritually
[14:05.880 --> 14:12.720]  lay out why it's a bad idea on every front to be part of that the globalists
[14:12.720 --> 14:16.080]  are for gun control I'm against it I can also intellectually lay out to you why
[14:16.080 --> 14:22.240]  I'm against it but just as a default if they are for open borders if they are
[14:22.240 --> 14:26.640]  for carbon taxes if they're for forced inoculations if they're for GMOs I'm
[14:26.640 --> 14:32.120]  against it if they're for invading Iraq I'm against it if the mainstream media
[14:32.120 --> 14:36.480]  was telling me to go out and eat pumpkin pie believe me there's something in the
[14:36.480 --> 14:41.760]  pumpkin pie I ain't gonna eat it I love pumpkin pie by the way Halloween's
[14:41.760 --> 14:45.840]  coming up thanksgiving I love pumpkin pie there's nothing wrong with the pumpkin
[14:45.840 --> 14:52.640]  pie folks I'm just using it as an allegory as an example so coming up I've
[14:52.640 --> 14:58.840]  got his sickening transcript here where he basically you know says be nice to
[14:58.840 --> 15:02.640]  your neighbor be nice the stranger among you take him in when it's being
[15:02.640 --> 15:07.400]  orchestrated and and and when the very groups that the Pope represents have
[15:07.400 --> 15:11.240]  helped implode the Middle East now we're supposed to follow the next phase and
[15:11.240 --> 15:15.980]  then we've got anchor baby advertisements while he's guarded by the
[15:15.980 --> 15:20.280]  Border Patrol we've got the most lax immigration in the world the highest
[15:20.280 --> 15:26.360]  level of welfare for foreigners it's called stealing can I show up in
[15:26.360 --> 15:32.280]  Mexico and go I'm a migrant I'd like to have free health care can I show up in
[15:32.280 --> 15:36.240]  Saudi Arabia and say hi I'm here to get free health care I'm here with my wife
[15:36.240 --> 15:39.720]  we're here to have a baby she's having a baby tomorrow you're gonna check to the
[15:39.720 --> 15:45.840]  hospital her water just broke they say oh we're gonna take care of your wife but
[15:45.840 --> 15:50.800]  you don't have the money to pay you're gonna be put in a debtors prison or we're
[15:50.800 --> 15:57.120]  gonna chop your hand off mr. Jones but see that's okay because I'm white and I
[15:57.120 --> 16:01.320]  deserve it but if I was Arab and I showed up in Saudi Arabia wanted something
[16:01.320 --> 16:05.480]  free I'd be put in a forced labor camp and it's all these countries are like
[16:05.480 --> 16:09.600]  that but then we've got 40 million illegals in this country they now admit
[16:09.600 --> 16:15.080]  it's 40 million and they're not even happy they're filled full of liberation
[16:15.080 --> 16:19.960]  theology hate America America's bad and they don't mean the globalist America
[16:19.960 --> 16:25.320]  that took over they mean a mom and apple pie Ford Mustang America's bad and
[16:25.320 --> 16:29.200]  sure it's not perfect but compared to these other countries it's heaven on
[16:29.200 --> 16:34.600]  earth that's why everybody wanted to try to get here so to sit here and to watch
[16:34.600 --> 16:45.760]  this pope just go through a unending laundry list and you know I had the
[16:45.760 --> 16:49.560]  transcript in here and then I was unable to find it right before I went on
[16:49.560 --> 16:57.200]  here were we able to get that transcript guys you gave me an article that had his
[16:57.200 --> 17:05.280]  quotes it's actually the Daily Mail Pope talks gay rides and a whole bunch of
[17:05.280 --> 17:09.440]  the stuff and it has this is pretty much transcript right there in it it's a
[17:09.440 --> 17:13.720]  drudge report comms link to it yeah he goes tracking it down right now so is
[17:13.720 --> 17:20.000]  info wars.com I'm gonna actually just find it right now because I want I was
[17:20.000 --> 17:26.560]  ready to get to that and that's it the transcripts also at Thomas.loc.gov
[17:26.560 --> 17:35.160]  right now but you look at this it just signifies that the takeover is in
[17:35.160 --> 17:41.680]  absolute total high gear
[17:41.680 --> 17:59.120]  the system is in absolute overdrive right now and it is only going to get
[17:59.120 --> 18:03.800]  worse and anyone who's moral anyone who's
[18:03.800 --> 18:07.560]  upstanding anyone who's taxpaying anyone who's hard working you're gonna be
[18:07.560 --> 18:11.560]  demonized and told over and over again you've done nothing you're lazy you're
[18:11.560 --> 18:20.880]  stupid you're bad you're scum you're trash because you've got to be bullied
[18:20.880 --> 18:28.360]  and intimidated into submitting to the establishment social engineering agenda
[18:28.360 --> 18:36.160]  and that's all it comes down to it's very very simple and that's why the
[18:36.160 --> 18:41.440]  harder working you are the better you are the more dedicated you are the more
[18:41.440 --> 18:44.880]  you're gonna be hammered the more you're gonna be targeted the more you're
[18:44.880 --> 18:50.280]  going to be basically beat up because that's the name of the game in mob
[18:50.280 --> 18:58.280]  psychology in gang psychology stock fall has intensified it's down about 6% the
[18:58.280 --> 19:03.080]  Dow Jones industrial average caterpillar is announced huge record level deep
[19:03.080 --> 19:07.760]  layoffs and plant closures and what does that tell you globally caterpillar is
[19:07.760 --> 19:21.320]  the biggest seller of heavy construction mining equipment you name it and
[19:21.320 --> 19:25.640]  they tell us we're in this global boom economy but the truth is we're in a
[19:25.640 --> 19:29.760]  global depression in many areas a recession and others because the
[19:29.760 --> 19:34.800]  depression in a world government is not evenly distributed in the total rigged
[19:34.800 --> 19:39.080]  economy that we're moving into I don't even call it service economy now if
[19:39.080 --> 19:42.960]  you're not gonna have that job it's the new technocracy economy where
[19:42.960 --> 19:46.560]  everything is centralized we come back I'm gonna read you the transcript play
[19:46.560 --> 19:51.720]  some of the clips of the Pope then we have our reporters joining us as they
[19:51.720 --> 19:57.600]  prepare to fly out of DC to New York following the pontiff our father over

[20:03.840 --> 20:08.760]  news and research network in the world and I paid for this airtime because I
[20:08.760 --> 20:13.080]  have an important message to the American people there's a change coming
[20:13.080 --> 20:18.920]  that the government isn't telling you about this change has deep implications
[20:18.920 --> 20:24.000]  for life in America from where you shop to the doctors you visit and the family
[20:24.000 --> 20:29.480]  you want to protect look I've made predictions like this before thing is I

[20:35.480 --> 20:42.680]  they did before that I warned that dot-com companies would crash they did
[20:42.680 --> 20:48.320]  those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing to do
[20:48.320 --> 20:52.480]  with the stock market this will affect us all you can watch the video for free

[24:05.600 --> 24:13.800]  the GCN radio network here is the Pope for Congress this morning just part of
[24:13.800 --> 24:21.040]  his speech promoting open borders here it is when the stranger in our midst
[24:21.040 --> 24:32.160]  appears to us we must not repeat the sins and the arrows of the past the fins
[24:32.160 --> 24:44.800]  and the arrows we must resolve now to live as noble as and as justly as
[24:44.800 --> 24:54.000]  possible as we educate new generations now to turn their back on our neighbors
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.480]  and everything around us that's just part of it some of the Vatican walls
[25:00.480 --> 25:06.440]  because I said 30 to 40 feet yesterday are 200 plus feet tall he lives behind
[25:06.440 --> 25:12.680]  200 foot walls tax exempt trillions and trillions and assets but is telling us
[25:12.680 --> 25:18.600]  we are sinful we are bad with Boehner who blocked banning partial birth
[25:18.600 --> 25:26.440]  abortion sitting behind him crying crying you go to drugreport.com it has
[25:26.440 --> 25:33.940]  the image of Boehner breaking down crying truly disgusting part of this
[25:33.940 --> 25:37.920]  segment of the next segment we're talking to Jakari Jackson then David Knight
[25:37.920 --> 25:43.560]  who's with him is going to pop in and give us his take on the situation but the
[25:43.560 --> 25:52.720]  House of Sin Sermon Pope lectures Congress on immigration gay rights and
[25:52.720 --> 25:59.120]  abortion and he just says this little backhanded thing about marriage there
[25:59.120 --> 26:03.800]  is an assault on marriage so going from the Catholic Church openly saying
[26:03.800 --> 26:11.120]  marriage is a institution between a man and a woman now he just gives a little
[26:11.120 --> 26:17.760]  vague bone to conservatives and other people it's just stunning I cannot hide
[26:17.760 --> 26:21.240]  my concern for the family which is threatened perhaps never before from
[26:21.240 --> 26:25.280]  within and without Francis told the pack House chamber that's what he said
[26:25.280 --> 26:31.880]  supposedly about gay marriage and the rest of it and then he also praised the
[26:31.880 --> 26:38.040]  US response to the pedophile scandal which is a long sickening cover-up so
[26:38.040 --> 26:43.200]  victims are now striking back I mean this this is just too much I want to go
[26:43.200 --> 26:48.640]  to oh by the way just to remind myself see I told you so now the emissions
[26:48.640 --> 26:56.680]  scandal has widened to BMW as I said I can't believe I was accurate again on
[26:56.680 --> 27:05.120]  Monday I said watch it widen to BMW next I just said that because it made sense
[27:05.120 --> 27:11.480]  I mean they're all doing it all of them watch
[27:11.480 --> 27:23.720]  BMW drops on report that x3 diesel emission exceeded EU limit so BMW
[27:23.720 --> 27:29.280]  stock is down oh see we had the same thing oops there's a tracker chip in
[27:29.280 --> 27:34.160]  your car oh it's telling their own accident oh your car's watching you oh
[27:34.160 --> 27:39.320]  Google is listening to you in your house over the microphone oh remember 15 years
[27:39.320 --> 27:44.440]  ago I was a raving loom and I told you I had their own company stock promotion
[27:44.440 --> 27:52.100]  literature I have the inventor of the polio vaccine admitting it gave a hundred
[27:52.100 --> 27:55.880]  million Americans cancer and saying it was good because there's too many of us
[27:55.880 --> 28:05.360]  haha haha, haha, okay it's not debatable
[28:05.440 --> 28:08.820]  to car we're going to break tell me what you got coming up and then we're gonna
[28:08.820 --> 28:12.740]  throw it to David Knight. You guys have been filing amazing reports, the board of patrol,
[28:12.740 --> 28:19.140]  protecting the illegals, stunts being pulled, TSA out searching everyone. What have you
[28:19.140 --> 28:24.820]  learned since then and tell us what's coming up Jakari? Well, we were just out there where
[28:24.820 --> 28:29.940]  the Pope was speaking. Of course, he was inside. We were outside and all the thousands of people,
[28:29.940 --> 28:33.060]  this is the moment I wish I'd have got on camera. I was digging in my bag at the time,
[28:33.060 --> 28:37.300]  but when he actually walked outside, you know, we saw him by I guess about 400 yards of weight
[28:37.300 --> 28:42.260]  and people who were in our area just did boning and one guy just jumped up like he just won the
[28:42.260 --> 28:46.500]  lottery. He just couldn't believe that he was seeing this, you know, white dot way off in the
[28:46.500 --> 28:51.860]  distance and it was quite something to see. But yes, we were out there. We were actually
[28:52.500 --> 28:58.180]  preceding the Pope speaking to the to the house in there. There was a climate change activist
[28:58.180 --> 29:01.940]  kind of group. They had a lot of singers and people out there all praising climate change
[29:01.940 --> 29:05.780]  saying we got to do this. We need to limit our carbon emissions. People wrote up there in, you
[29:05.780 --> 29:11.700]  know, convoys and, you know, all the Pope has a little fiat. He has 10 huge suburban fallen
[29:11.700 --> 29:16.340]  behind him. Same thing with Obama. So it's all just a really big joke. A lot of well-meaning
[29:16.340 --> 29:20.980]  people, but people were just, in my opinion, being taken advantage of. Well, obviously,
[29:20.980 --> 29:25.620]  it's all about seeing the Pope as if you'll be fulfilled. We can care less. We're there to cover
[29:25.620 --> 29:29.700]  what's happening. I know you guys got some footage of different groups classed yesterday. Tell us
[29:29.700 --> 29:33.620]  about that, Jakari. Then we'll get David Knight's breakdown. I know you guys are about to board a
[29:33.620 --> 29:38.180]  plane. So I want to let you go soon to get down to New York. And then you're going to take a train
[29:38.180 --> 29:44.820]  to Philly to cover the Pope here telling us what to do. A foreign head of state above the law,
[29:44.820 --> 29:53.700]  tax exempt guy telling us what to do. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and
[29:53.700 --> 30:02.500]  the GCN radio network. You've heard of clock kid, right? The boy who removed the insides of a digital
[30:02.500 --> 30:06.260]  clock, put it in a suitcase, then brought it to school to show his teachers. When people got
[30:06.260 --> 30:10.340]  suspicious, he claimed he didn't know anything, refused to talk to police, then gets invited to
[30:10.340 --> 30:15.380]  the White House. Well, get ready. Now we have Pope Kid. That's right. The Daily Mail reports,
[30:15.380 --> 30:19.540]  five-year-old daughter of illegal immigrants is blessed by Pope after breaking through security
[30:19.540 --> 30:24.660]  barricades hours after he says mass in Spanish. Sophia Cruz was part of a crowd of thousands
[30:24.660 --> 30:28.340]  lining the papal route in Washington D.C. to catch a glimpse of the pontiff. As he passed,
[30:28.340 --> 30:32.020]  she got over police barricades and ran out into the street in an attempt to approach the Pope
[30:32.020 --> 30:36.180]  Mobile. She happened to have a letter and a yellow t-shirt that read Pope rescued Dapa,
[30:36.180 --> 30:40.260]  so the legalization would be your blessing. Makes you wonder with all this security theater around
[30:40.260 --> 30:45.540]  how a five-year-old could get through. Hmm, maybe it's staged. Of course, every five-year-old's got
[30:45.540 --> 30:49.940]  a letter ready and a t-shirt printed up. Nothing weird about that. Back to the clock kid. Did you
[30:49.940 --> 30:54.500]  know his sister was suspended for reportedly threatening to blow up the school? Hmm, now it
[30:54.500 --> 31:01.060]  all becomes clear. Rob Dew reporting for infowars.com and infowars nightly news. Introducing Secret 12,

[33:24.260 --> 33:25.940]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:27.700 --> 33:30.180]  You know, they're not talking about actually waking the dead in this song. They're talking about
[33:30.180 --> 34:00.020]  waking up the politically dead. Because we're all metal mad. Crank it up!
[34:00.180 --> 34:10.020]  More power!
[34:16.660 --> 34:22.020]  You know, the fortune that I want is liberty and freedom and a system based on empowering
[34:22.020 --> 34:28.900]  humanity. The globalists want inverted power over people to dumb them down. I'm in the camp
[34:28.900 --> 34:32.820]  that wants the power to be free, the power to have the globalist off my back.
[34:36.660 --> 34:38.580]  This is like a guitar. It's Randy Rose.
[34:43.780 --> 34:47.220]  I really want to be overrated.
[34:50.180 --> 34:51.300]  And I'm a keeper.
[34:51.300 --> 34:55.220]  I'm not a loser and I ain't no weeper.
[34:55.220 --> 34:56.740]  We know Vayner's a weeper.
[34:58.820 --> 35:03.140]  I don't know, something so beautiful I can tear in my eye or something so ugly I do as well.
[35:03.780 --> 35:10.100]  It's like a Siamah. I guess I am a weeper. I don't really weep though. I just get tears in my eyes.
[35:12.340 --> 35:13.380]  Bang your head!
[35:15.220 --> 35:17.540]  Pope Francis is going to wake the dead!
[35:17.540 --> 35:22.260]  I better stop it right now. I apologize. I'm going to quit right there.
[35:27.300 --> 35:34.740]  Charts point to breach of August Lowe's S&P 500 after the Federal Reserve's chairperson,
[35:36.020 --> 35:44.260]  chairlady Janet Yellen, unnerved markets last week with a dovish message and a hold on rates
[35:44.260 --> 35:51.460]  U.S. stocks have not really known which way to turn and Caterpillar is showing record losses,
[35:51.460 --> 35:57.060]  shutdown of plants, you name it, deep layoffs. We're going to be getting into that what that
[35:57.060 --> 36:03.860]  really signifies. The New York Times is saying we should pay to fly illegal immigrants into Europe.
[36:03.860 --> 36:14.820]  Oh man, I tell you what a joke. And of course, as I mentioned, the new VW situation is expanding
[36:15.860 --> 36:23.140]  into BMW as well. So the Germans can run their ads saying we have all the emission standards.
[36:23.140 --> 36:28.100]  No one else can step up to this level, not even the Japanese, because you're cheating.
[36:28.100 --> 36:34.980]  That's why, like, landstorm strong. But it's all a fraud. You're cheating on a fraud to begin with.
[36:34.980 --> 36:42.580]  Who cares about carbon dioxide? It's like mother's milk to the plants. We're in a
[36:42.580 --> 36:47.380]  starve situation. I apologize. Let me go back to Jacarie Jackson. Jacarie Jackson, you're there
[36:47.380 --> 36:54.180]  in DC. Tell us where you're about to go next to cover the, his grace, his excellency, the Holy One,
[36:54.180 --> 37:02.020]  Adam V. Island, excuse me, Pope Francis. Go ahead. Yes. Yes. Multiple stops in New York.
[37:02.020 --> 37:05.460]  That's where we're going to head next. And then after that, we're going to head out to Billy.
[37:05.460 --> 37:09.780]  Now, before to break, you're asking me about the class I saw outside the Pope event at the White
[37:09.780 --> 37:15.540]  House. It was a group that was out there pretty much the whole time we were there yelling stuff
[37:15.540 --> 37:20.580]  at the Catholics who were out there to see the Pope. And one guy who by their conversation,
[37:20.580 --> 37:24.980]  I think was actually Muslim approached the man who had the megaphone. And then they had a brief
[37:24.980 --> 37:28.660]  exchange yelling back and forth at each other. But these guys, they were out there yesterday.
[37:28.660 --> 37:32.820]  The guys from the megaphone, they were out there again today. So I wouldn't be surprised if they
[37:32.820 --> 37:38.260]  showed up in New York or Philadelphia. What about other protests to the Pope? Or has it just been
[37:38.260 --> 37:44.340]  worshipful throngs of anchor babies? I haven't seen too many protesters outside the people
[37:44.340 --> 37:48.660]  in the video that we showed yesterday. There are a few people, you know, here, they're passing
[37:48.660 --> 37:53.540]  out their tracks. But by and large, most of the people are there either to just see the Pope as
[37:53.540 --> 38:00.020]  a bystander or actually there to celebrate his being in the United States. Well, I think we've
[38:00.020 --> 38:05.220]  got a clip coming up here in a few minutes, Chikari, of the Pope actually giving a private
[38:05.220 --> 38:09.940]  speech to Obama and Boehner. We're going to be playing a short clip of that. This is satire,
[38:09.940 --> 38:15.220]  folks, coming up here in a few minutes. Chikari, before we throw the mic over to David Knight to
[38:15.220 --> 38:19.140]  give his breakdown, what are some of the other angles you're planning to report on?
[38:20.180 --> 38:23.620]  Well, we did a man on the street. We just asked people, you know, do they agree with the
[38:23.620 --> 38:26.820]  Pope's views on climate change? Of course, everybody said yes. And then I asked him, you
[38:26.820 --> 38:31.220]  know, what they would do to lessen their carbon footprint. So we have that coming up. And then
[38:31.220 --> 38:36.020]  just talk to the various people around, see the security measures. We saw border patrol out there
[38:36.020 --> 38:40.980]  again today guarding the Pope, multiple alphabet agencies, every alphabet agency that you can think
[38:40.980 --> 38:45.700]  of was out there, high alert, high fences, everything that you could imagine for something
[38:45.700 --> 38:49.380]  like this and probably even more than what you could imagine. If I wasn't here, I wouldn't believe
[38:49.380 --> 38:55.060]  some of the stuff I've actually seen. Well, Chikari, it looks like a total circus there
[38:55.700 --> 39:01.700]  with the border patrol and other people providing security for his holiness. While we don't have
[39:01.700 --> 39:05.860]  our security, our borders are wide open. Those very people are there to protect him.
[39:05.860 --> 39:11.060]  Yeah. And it was so ironic to me because we see these high gates and high fences,
[39:11.060 --> 39:15.540]  these portable fences that they put up blocking the Capitol building with the border patrol
[39:15.540 --> 39:20.420]  standing right there at these portable fences. But, you know, down on the border, you know,
[39:20.420 --> 39:24.340]  it's a very lax environment. That's not knocking the border patrol. I'm knocking the orders
[39:24.340 --> 39:26.900]  that they're given and the way they are told to go about things.
[39:26.900 --> 39:30.980]  Sure, exactly, Chikari. But the Pope says, be nice to any stranger in your midst.
[39:30.980 --> 39:37.220]  But, but he's behind 200 foot, 100 foot walls. I miss Bob said 30, 40, some of the little front
[39:37.220 --> 39:43.380]  walls are that big. They have behind it that are 200 feet, 200 foot gray walls with arm guards
[39:43.380 --> 39:47.860]  with machine guns. He's not being a very good neighbor with all of his secret bank accounts.
[39:47.860 --> 39:50.260]  He's being probably the biggest hypocrite I've ever seen.
[39:51.460 --> 39:55.620]  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of money has lost security, a huge carbon footprint. And like
[39:55.620 --> 39:59.540]  I said, it's nothing unique to him, whether it's Obama or Al Gore, any of these other guys who get
[39:59.540 --> 40:04.180]  out here and preach all this climate dogma, then there's some of the biggest contributors to the
[40:04.180 --> 40:07.940]  problem. Now you've got a statue behind you, Chikari. Exactly. What is that?
[40:08.660 --> 40:12.980]  Oh, this is actually something we just had to post up in front of because we ran out the
[40:12.980 --> 40:17.300]  hotel so quick. But David, you were doing some research on this a little bit earlier. Who is
[40:17.300 --> 40:23.060]  this guy? He's actually the father of homeopathy, Alex. I thought it's a good place to set up here.
[40:23.060 --> 40:25.860]  Interesting. I'm going to give you a minute to flip back into the front. There's been
[40:25.860 --> 40:29.380]  talk to you, David. Thank you. Thank you so much, Chikari. We're going to go back to those guys.
[40:29.380 --> 40:33.940]  They're in DC about to go to New York. They've been filing a lot of really important reports
[40:33.940 --> 40:38.820]  on the nightly news, seven o'clock central every single evening. And here's the deal.
[40:39.860 --> 40:43.860]  I'm getting more aggressive with the globalist because they're getting more aggressive with us.
[40:44.820 --> 40:48.900]  From Australia to the United States to Mexico, forced inoculations are beginning.
[40:50.260 --> 40:53.140]  They give Mexican and Guatemalan schoolgirls shots.
[40:53.140 --> 40:57.140]  And a third of them start convulsing and blood starts coming out their nose.
[40:59.620 --> 41:05.540]  It killed a bunch of people in the trials. The New World Order is not playing games.
[41:06.580 --> 41:11.300]  And so it's time to call it like it is and not just play along with all this. And oh,
[41:11.300 --> 41:16.260]  the Pontiff's here. He says, I can't have air conditioning. And how beautiful it is to be poor.
[41:16.260 --> 41:20.580]  That's because they're getting ready to create artificial austerity. That's why they're raising
[41:20.580 --> 41:27.540]  taxes to shut down productive people. They want us politically poor to be controlled just like
[41:27.540 --> 41:33.300]  Fidel Castro does. And to watch the Pope, they're praising that system and how beautiful it is
[41:33.300 --> 41:41.780]  that you're so poor is sick. It's not bad to be poor. It's not bad to live frugally if you want
[41:41.780 --> 41:47.780]  to and make that decision to basically have a hermitage or be a cogiter. In fact, there's
[41:47.780 --> 41:52.340]  some arguments. That's a good way to raise children. But you need the money in an emergency for
[41:52.340 --> 41:55.860]  healthcare. You need to be able to travel some. You need to be able to have the things that money
[41:55.860 --> 42:01.220]  can give you the security and it's not evil to have it. It's only a symbol of energy. The root
[42:01.220 --> 42:09.700]  of evil is the love of money. Money is not bad. The love of it. Most talk show hosts that become
[42:09.700 --> 42:15.380]  successful like I do own a giant house and have a private jet. I don't have those things because I
[42:15.380 --> 42:20.660]  don't want a private jet or a giant house. Bigger than a four bedroom is a giant hassle.
[42:22.180 --> 42:27.380]  A pool is a giant hassle. A boat is a giant hassle. I'm not saying it's bad if you have those things
[42:28.420 --> 42:33.620]  because that creates jobs. The point is that I get people that are into austerity, but that's
[42:34.420 --> 42:42.900]  self-imposed austerity, not forced austerity by a bunch of opulently rich people with jumbo jets,
[42:42.900 --> 42:48.740]  red carpets and giant yachts and total healthcare and clean vaccines giving us dirty vaccines and
[42:48.740 --> 42:54.020]  dirty water who are eugenicists and have bad will for us and our family. Now, first I have a clip
[42:55.780 --> 43:02.180]  from Congress today. Pope Francis was addressing his new initiative, the EU expansion, the treaty
[43:02.180 --> 43:11.460]  coming up in December there in Paris that will openly establish world government. But he says
[43:11.460 --> 43:16.500]  it's for our safety and our security. So here's the club of Pope Francis just a few hours ago.
[43:42.180 --> 43:52.340]  There you go. Now we've got another clip of him behind the scenes basically telling Obama and
[43:52.340 --> 43:57.860]  Banner that they've served them well, but then just giving them a little message about who ultimately
[43:57.860 --> 44:05.460]  is in charge. We're going to play that clip here in just a moment. Do we have that exclusive clip
[44:05.460 --> 44:10.660]  guys? We're going to get you that exclusive clip here in a moment. First I'm going to go back to
[44:10.660 --> 44:17.780]  David Knight and Jakari Jackson. David getting a little more serious here. I try to put a good
[44:17.780 --> 44:21.940]  face on this and just try to be a little bit nasty about it to have some fun, but this is truly
[44:21.940 --> 44:28.660]  sickening. When I put out that report yesterday that's gone viral, Pope's climate plan will kill
[44:28.660 --> 44:34.340]  a billion people. You've implemented. I mean, we're talking about shutting people's power off,
[44:34.340 --> 44:38.420]  shutting their water off, taking everything away from them. They're not even hiding this.
[44:38.420 --> 44:43.860]  This will kill a billion people. A lot of them Catholics and defeat because I could never
[44:43.860 --> 44:48.740]  criticize the Catholic church before, even though a lot of my most of my family that founded Texas
[44:48.740 --> 44:54.420]  was like just radical Protestants foaming at the mouth, anti-Catholic. I wasn't brought up like
[44:54.420 --> 44:58.900]  that. A lot of Catholic friends. I thought the fruits of something of the pubs criticizing
[45:00.660 --> 45:05.860]  communism, criticizing tyranny, criticizing abortion, promoting the family. I just said,
[45:05.860 --> 45:11.940]  hey, I can't, I can't criticize this. Now, though, I got to tell you, I mean, you talk about book
[45:11.940 --> 45:17.540]  of revelations. This guy is scary, promoting the things he's pushing. The first thing he said when
[45:17.540 --> 45:22.340]  he got in a few years ago was Catholics obsessed on abortion too much. Well, you know, Catholics are
[45:22.340 --> 45:26.980]  pro-life and you're not a Catholic Francis and he gets off the plane and say, you know, you're not
[45:26.980 --> 45:31.860]  wearing ruby slippers. Well, I'm the anti-Pope. I mean, I remember seeing that yesterday. These are
[45:31.860 --> 45:37.380]  chilling statements to tell everybody that we may have had some problems with the previous groups
[45:37.380 --> 45:42.580]  in the Catholic church or factions, but man, the New World Order has got a big ally now
[45:42.580 --> 45:48.340]  with a billion people that follow this guy. And this guy supposedly speaks for Christ. Well,
[45:49.060 --> 45:52.900]  if this guy speaks for Christ, you know, this isn't the Christ I know, David Knight.
[45:54.340 --> 45:58.900]  David Knight for infowords.com. Yes, you're right, Alex. I was watching Fox News going back and forth
[45:58.900 --> 46:04.420]  between them and CNN last night. I saw a Greta Van Susteren saying, you know, it's amazing. Some
[46:04.420 --> 46:08.740]  people are saying that this Pope is different. Is he really different? Is he political? And of
[46:08.740 --> 46:14.420]  course, her answer was no, Alex. It's pretty obvious to anyone who's looking at this Catholic or not,
[46:14.420 --> 46:20.340]  there's a world of difference between John Paul II and between Pope Francis. There's a world of
[46:20.340 --> 46:27.220]  difference. He's all about leftist causes. He's not really talking. He tries to say that's a moral
[46:27.220 --> 46:32.020]  issue and tie it together. And you know, I found it interesting, Alex, that she had Rick Santorum
[46:32.020 --> 46:36.580]  on to sell that narrative that there really isn't any difference between this Pope and the other
[46:36.580 --> 46:42.660]  folks. This is an agenda. This is carefully laid out as all the travel and security plans that we
[46:42.660 --> 46:48.340]  see here in Washington. And this is an agenda. They're taking a step by step. It began with his
[46:48.340 --> 46:55.060]  encyclical. He's been taking the lead and turning over a world global governance using climate
[46:55.060 --> 46:59.940]  change narrative. And of course, everything that he's talking about is really about socialism,
[46:59.940 --> 47:04.980]  about redistribution of income, about erasing borders. And the thing that underpins all of this
[47:04.980 --> 47:10.100]  is the climate change because you can't have a world government without having some justification
[47:10.100 --> 47:15.300]  for regulation and for taxation at a global level. That's what this is about. And it's going to go
[47:15.300 --> 47:20.180]  to the UN tomorrow in New York. There's going to be leaders from 80 different countries. The
[47:20.180 --> 47:26.100]  entire UN is going to be there as well. It's going to be a perfect storm of security mess there.
[47:26.100 --> 47:30.500]  But of course, you can't kick off world government without having all the leaders there. So that's
[47:30.500 --> 47:34.660]  what they're really doing about this. This is it. This is the kickoff, getting it all lined up for
[47:34.660 --> 47:39.300]  the global tax. They've got the global government, the global courts, the global army, the global
[47:39.300 --> 47:45.860]  regulations, the global corporate minions, the global education systems, UNESCO, the final cog is
[47:45.860 --> 47:51.780]  global taxation and tracking all human activity and making carbon, which is the basis of life,
[47:51.780 --> 47:59.140]  carbon-based life form, a crime, making life a crime that can be taxed, destroyed. But we can't
[47:59.140 --> 48:05.540]  go any further without playing a clip of what, again, Pope Francis had to say about this initiative
[48:05.540 --> 48:24.900]  today. Here it is. And part of the fairness doctrine, I believe, that we really should
[48:24.900 --> 48:29.700]  occasionally have a comment from Pope Francis here. Actually, it looks just like Rat Singer,
[48:29.700 --> 48:34.500]  the previous Pope. Sorry, David Knight, please continue. Well, Alex, I was going to say that
[48:34.500 --> 48:39.860]  that excellent report that Rob do had about the young child who, we're told, climbed through the
[48:39.860 --> 48:45.140]  mental barriers, got through all the barricades, presented this letter to the Pope that was
[48:45.140 --> 48:52.020]  incredibly precocious. This child is a genius and a master escape artist. But listen, at the
[48:52.020 --> 48:57.380]  core of this, Alex, we need to read what this group is doing that put her up to this and got
[48:57.380 --> 49:01.540]  her through. You know, she didn't just show up there like we're told all the kids are coming
[49:01.540 --> 49:05.940]  across thousands of miles of Central and South America, presenting themselves at the border,
[49:05.940 --> 49:12.740]  and Glenn Beck meets them there with teddy bears. This child had a letter about DAPA,
[49:12.740 --> 49:19.540]  Deferred Action for Parents. Understand that when you have the mainstream media like Fox and CNN
[49:19.540 --> 49:23.700]  pushing back and saying to Donald Trump, there's no such thing as anchor babies. And besides,
[49:23.700 --> 49:28.580]  if there were, it's in the Constitution. It's a total lie. They're talking about deferred action
[49:28.580 --> 49:33.780]  for children. And of course, they define children as people up to the age of 31. But this is deferred
[49:33.780 --> 49:40.740]  action for parents. This child that was there yesterday gave him the letter. She is was born
[49:40.740 --> 49:45.140]  in America. So then they say, well, she's an American citizen, anchor baby, please don't send
[49:45.140 --> 49:49.460]  my parents away. Don't send her parents. Look, I'm going to say it. What do people that prey on
[49:49.460 --> 49:54.180]  children use? They use ice cream trucks. They use candy trucks. They use other children. They use
[49:54.180 --> 50:01.140]  puppies. The globalists are using this little girl, in my view, as an allegory, just like predators
[50:01.140 --> 50:05.700]  would use another child to get the kids in the truck. And the American people are very childlike
[50:05.700 --> 50:12.100]  and they're going, look a child, a child, we're nice work with us. Yes, absolutely. And if you
[50:12.100 --> 50:16.180]  look at the bottom of this, when people say that you can't stop the anchor babies, yes, you can't.
[50:16.740 --> 50:20.180]  The deferred action for children, the deferred action for parents, those are both executive
[50:20.180 --> 50:24.660]  orders. Just undo them, first of all. The other part of this is that the basis on which we're
[50:24.660 --> 50:30.260]  extending citizenship to children who are born in this country is not even a Supreme Court decision
[50:30.260 --> 50:34.900]  that had anything to do with people who were here illegally. That goes back to a Chinese decision.
[50:34.900 --> 50:39.700]  We need to remember that the Supreme Court is just an opinion. And their decisions are overturned
[50:39.700 --> 50:44.420]  all the time, even by other Supreme Courts. We had at one point in time a Supreme Court decision
[50:44.420 --> 50:48.660]  when movies first came out, said they weren't subject to First Amendment protection. That was
[50:48.660 --> 50:53.620]  about 1917. Then later in the 1950s, they overturned that decision and said, no, they are
[50:53.620 --> 50:58.340]  subject to First Amendment protection. That's just an opinion. We can read what the Constitution
[50:58.340 --> 51:02.580]  says. We can read what was done at the time. We know that that was not set up to create an
[51:02.580 --> 51:07.620]  anchor baby situation, but we have these executive orders and those could be wiped away as soon as
[51:07.620 --> 51:11.940]  we got rid of Obama if we had a president with the will to do it. But this is all about, as
[51:11.940 --> 51:17.300]  you just pointed out, it's all about using the children as a beard. If I'd sum up all of what
[51:17.300 --> 51:22.980]  was being said today, I'd say that they're telling us that the earth is melting and, of course,
[51:22.980 --> 51:27.380]  women, children and people of color are the ones who are hardest hit. That's essentially the narrative
[51:27.380 --> 51:31.700]  that they're selling us. That's the way they're going to sell us global governance. They want to
[51:31.700 --> 51:38.100]  get our pity, appeal to our humanity, but then sell us an agenda that is absolutely anti-humanity.
[51:38.100 --> 51:42.740]  We're standing here in front of the founder of homeopathy. His name is Hanuman. I didn't know
[51:42.740 --> 51:47.300]  till we looked it up. And, of course, here's his slogan here, like yours, like in Latin. And then
[51:47.300 --> 51:53.540]  over here on the other side, we have another Latin symbol, an omnibus caritas, which means, in all
[51:53.540 --> 51:59.940]  things, charity. In other words, tolerance for people's informed consent when it comes to medicine.
[51:59.940 --> 52:05.380]  Have you heard any of that? Have you heard them talking about the issues of, if they're concerned
[52:05.380 --> 52:10.020]  about health issues and environmental issues, what about the dumping of chemicals into our water,
[52:10.020 --> 52:14.500]  like fluoride without our consent or without our knowledge? How about demanding that they inject
[52:14.500 --> 52:19.940]  mercury into our vessels or anything that they choose because the corporations or whatever
[52:19.940 --> 52:23.860]  that they put into our food, we're not allowed to know what that is. Of course, they're not going
[52:23.860 --> 52:28.900]  to talk about those kind of agendas because those are the health issues that are being sold by the
[52:28.900 --> 52:35.220]  globalist, elitist, fascist corporations that this Congress and this Pope are really serving.
[52:35.220 --> 52:40.020]  And those are the people who are driving this globalist agenda. He's here to put
[52:40.020 --> 52:47.220]  a Christian face on it, to put a moral face. Oh, it shows. It's a full court press. I know
[52:47.220 --> 52:51.940]  you got to catch your plane. Great job, David Knight. We'll be talking to you tomorrow. Thank you
[52:51.940 --> 52:57.220]  so much. Thank you. And again, they're having live reports on the street, recorded reports,
[52:57.220 --> 53:02.500]  special reports, the nightly news. You can see all their coverage of the Pope trying to put the
[53:02.500 --> 53:12.500]  final nails in this republic's coffin at infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and of course, prisonplanet.tv
[53:12.500 --> 53:16.900]  and the nightly news, seven o'clock central weeknights. Of course, we'll be back, Lord willing,
[53:16.900 --> 53:22.340]  tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central. We've still got two hours ahead of us, three hours ahead of us.
[53:22.340 --> 53:28.740]  And then I'll be back this Sunday hosting, David Knight hosted last Sunday, four to six p.m. central
[53:28.740 --> 53:36.580]  with the Sunday transmission. But it is extremely cold-blooded to take this sweet little girl
[53:37.220 --> 53:43.380]  who probably believes in Santa Claus and probably believes in my little pony and leprechauns and
[53:43.380 --> 53:48.260]  Easter bunnies because I've got a daughter basically this age. There's nothing sweeter than a little
[53:48.260 --> 53:53.940]  six, seven, eight-year-old girl. This is a five-year-old girl handing a letter to the Pope pleading
[53:53.940 --> 53:57.700]  for her family to be able to stay in the United States. They've been allowed to. And a yellow
[53:57.700 --> 54:05.380]  t-shirt with a pro-immigration message. And then it shows, oh, her parents, the border patrols all
[54:05.380 --> 54:09.940]  around guarding the Pope. They're not there grabbing any of the illegals. No one's hunting
[54:09.940 --> 54:16.180]  these people down comparatively to any other nation. They're getting rid of the borders entirely.
[54:17.540 --> 54:23.140]  And then meanwhile, the Pope in his speeches says, we're hurting the third world populations with
[54:23.140 --> 54:29.780]  our carbon. You notice in the Copenhagen Treaty six years ago, they kept it secret, but it leaked.
[54:29.780 --> 54:37.940]  They were trying to ram it through. And in the Copenhagen Treaty, it almost doubled,
[54:37.940 --> 54:43.700]  one percentage point from doubling the amount of taxes on the third world that would be on
[54:43.700 --> 54:48.820]  the developed world. And actually, it's to stop the third world from developing and getting clean
[54:48.820 --> 54:56.100]  technologies. It was to stop them from coming out of squalor. It is a death sentence. And so,
[54:56.100 --> 55:00.980]  let's put the little girl back on screen here because I want to show people something. If the
[55:00.980 --> 55:12.420]  Pope is to have his way, you would see millions and millions a year of little girls, it's mainly
[55:12.420 --> 55:25.300]  children that starve to death, dying, dying, becoming skulls, becoming death. It's just sick.
[55:25.940 --> 55:32.020]  They're all better skull than that. I mean, that's what this comes down to.
[55:33.780 --> 55:36.740]  I mean, he might as well in this image, be the grim reaper,
[55:36.740 --> 55:46.740]  you know, getting ready to lop her head off. And that's why I get so angry is that that
[55:46.740 --> 55:53.460]  might as well be a sword coming out of his arm just to slice her head off. But they'll use her
[55:53.460 --> 55:59.300]  to push the image that he's this great guy and that, oh, he's there to reform and stop the pedophilia
[56:01.460 --> 56:06.100]  when the globalists use pedophilia in the Catholic Church to blackmail it and take control of it
[56:06.100 --> 56:13.460]  by any yardstick. And Leo Zagami is going to be joining us in the second hour, the Consument
[56:13.460 --> 56:19.140]  Vatican insider whistleblower at eight after we'll play a clip of the mini documentary we shot in
[56:19.140 --> 56:27.140]  Rome with him. And then we'll go to Leo Zagami joining us from outside Rome to go over all of
[56:27.140 --> 56:32.660]  this. But we know what we're talking about. There's a formula the enemy runs. I know you know that
[56:32.660 --> 56:37.940]  we've got to educate others. I told you two weeks ago, they say it's 10,000 immigrants a year,
[56:37.940 --> 56:42.180]  refugees, it's going to be hundreds of thousands by next week. Now it's 300 plus thousand, it'll
[56:42.180 --> 56:49.220]  be a million by next month. We told you it's going to end up being BMW next. And then it's going to
[56:49.220 --> 56:54.900]  be Japanese cars and American cars, fixing the emission standards. Now that's coming out today.
[56:54.900 --> 57:01.940]  I know what I'm talking about. Because these are combines organized crime syndicates,
[57:01.940 --> 57:07.140]  they don't do something unless they've been in council meetings with government in joint
[57:07.140 --> 57:11.940]  government corporate governance. And they make the decisions to go ahead with this.
[57:14.020 --> 57:18.820]  Then it's whistleblowers inside government corporations that end up exposing it.
[57:20.020 --> 57:25.780]  Like the whistleblower that leaked the info on VW, like the whistleblower that they call a trader
[57:25.780 --> 57:35.380]  in Congress, Snowden. He's not a trader, he's a hero. And Donald Trump is wrong when he says he's
[57:35.380 --> 57:40.340]  a trader and should be executed. The people illegally spying on us are the ones that should
[57:40.340 --> 57:46.580]  be in trouble, not the heroes that expose it. But you know when freedom fails, the best men rot
[57:46.580 --> 57:52.740]  in filthy jails and those that cry to peas appease are hung by those they tried to please.
[57:52.740 --> 57:57.060]  Before we end this hour, please do not forget we're listed supported. We had the money bomb,
[57:57.060 --> 58:01.140]  it was very successful. But that was to fund the satellite, the closed captioning,
[58:01.140 --> 58:05.140]  a few new reporters, crew members, we've already hired two new people. Thank you so much for the

[59:51.380 --> 59:54.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:54.020 --> 01:00:12.660]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:21.540]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:27.540]  Vatican Insider, Leo Zagani. Gonna be joining us for the balance of the hour and open the phones
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:32.980]  up for him in the last 20 minutes or so. You know, they spent all this and said,
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:37.620]  we got to take all these refugees because we bombed the Middle East, the very same politicians
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:43.220]  that launched those unpopular wars, then use the giant hordes of people that they're advertising to
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:51.140]  come here as the pretext to take more of our liberties. And the United States is a nation
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:58.020]  of immigrants. The original Native Americans, you know, came here from Asia across the Bering
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:04.820]  Strait land bridge. There's archaeological evidence showing that's the case. So humans do migrate.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.220]  But you could say the Nazis were migrating into other countries in World War II by that yard
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:16.580]  stick. If you just say all migration is good, if I got an amoeba up my nose at Lake Travis and ate
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:23.220]  my brain as it kills people, he's here. Would it be a migration? Yes, would it be good? Yes,
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:29.700]  amoeba migrated, it ate some brain and enjoyed itself. It had babies that swam around gleefully.
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:34.260]  It had a good time.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:45.220]  And all I'm getting at here is that the globalists have organized these movements now as political
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:49.780]  weapons. And that's why we've got to stand against it. And it's just so outrageous that
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:56.980]  the pope would meet with an anchor baby in a staged event as she broke through the barricades.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:01.620]  No, she was led by the police up to him in a stage managed event. I mean, it's just like the clock
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:05.540]  kid. It's turning out his sister got thrown out of school for saying she was going to blow the
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:09.940]  school up. Her dad's the guy that pulls stunts constantly. He didn't build the clock. It was
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:16.900]  the inside of a digital clock. He wouldn't say it wasn't a bomb. He had it timed, you know,
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:21.780]  to supposedly go off the way it looked to freak everybody out. He wouldn't talk to the cops.
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:26.740]  So they'd had to take him to jail thinking it was a bomb hoax so they could run a larger hoax.
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:34.580]  This little kid's a hoax. The evidence is mounting the clock kids a hoax and it's just all
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:42.020]  for the children. Oh, there aren't any racist or bad Muslims or crazies. No, they're all good.
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:48.180]  No one's persecuting you. They're being persecuted. There's no anchor babies, you know, tens of
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:53.060]  thousands a month from China and other countries, women coming around and kids. It's not a problem.
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:03:00.580]  And you've just got all these aggressive people who've been told it's kosher and that it's correct
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:05.780]  to hate the West. And then we're taught to hate ourselves in the West and just bend over, lay down,
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:12.580]  roll over, get on our knees, assume the position. Anytime some arrogant foreigner, I don't care
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:17.780]  what color they are, starts shooting their fat mouth off. One time I was with Paul Watson.
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:25.220]  I got footage of this. I'll play it just filming a landmark and a guy like 50, 60 yards away
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:33.220]  pulls up in his car, gets out with his wife. He's going in a hotel and he's Arabic and he runs over
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:39.220]  and gets in my face and says, how dare you videotape me? What are you doing? I said, sir, I'm just
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.980]  shooting footage of, you know, big Ben or whatever he gets in my face. I started screaming back. I said,
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:49.540]  go ahead and do something. I'm filming. And again, I've got a lot of Arab friends. That's
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:55.860]  a classic statement. I've got a lot of black friends. No, the fact is I went to college with
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:04:00.180]  folks from Iraq and places in high school, good friends, nice people, good, upstanding folks,
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:04.820]  weren't extremists, all this stuff. The point is, is that with political correctness, the left is
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:10.100]  taking immigrants, whether they be from Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, wherever,
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:14.820]  and man, they're putting chips on their shoulders. Instead of thank you for all this free stuff,
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:18.180]  used to immigrants showed up and said, thank you for the opportunity to have lower taxes.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:24.260]  Thank you for the opportunity to have my own religion. No, it's like your white privilege is
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:30.180]  evil. I saw that Crowder piece that they aired on the news last night, where they go to this
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:35.300]  feminist event and it's all like, we're fat, we're ugly, we stink, and we hate men and we're taking
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:41.780]  over and you'll do what we say. And it's just, it's like a cult of weirdos. It's a cult of crazy
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:48.500]  people who haven't succeeded in anything, have class envy, run by the left that want to just destroy
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:54.500]  everything. And they're targeting the family trying to ban it and saying our kids belong to them,
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:05:01.780]  this giant consortium of misfits. You've heard of Clock Kid, right? The boy who removed the insides
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:05.620]  of a digital clock, put it in a suitcase, then brought it to school to show his teachers. When
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:09.700]  people got suspicious, he claimed he didn't know anything, refused to talk to police, then gets
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:14.740]  invited to the White House. We'll get ready. Now we have Pope Kid. That's right. The Daily Mail
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:18.660]  reports, five-year-old daughter of illegal immigrants is blessed by Pope after breaking
[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:23.940]  through security barricades hours after he says mass in Spanish. Sophia Cruz was part of a crowd
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:28.180]  of thousands lining the papal route in Washington, D.C. to catch a glimpse of the pontiff. As he passed,
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.860]  she got over police barricades and ran out into the street in an attempt to approach the Pope
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:36.340]  mobile. She happened to have a letter and a yellow t-shirt that read, Pope rescued Dapa. So the
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:40.340]  legalization would be your blessing. Makes you wonder with all this security theater around how
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:45.460]  a five-year-old could get through. Hmm, maybe it's staged. Of course, every five-year-old's got a
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:49.780]  letter ready and a t-shirt printed up. Nothing weird about that. Back to the Clock Kid. Did you
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:54.340]  know his sister was suspended for reportedly threatening to blow up the school? Hmm, now it
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:58.980]  all becomes clear. Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.

[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:03.780]  I want more candy. I want more video games. Why, why, why? And it's that type of behavior
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:09.380]  that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:14.580]  to smooth out and help children focus. All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:20.020]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:25.620]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:30.340]  can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs. Working with my
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:34.500]  team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:38.980]  would actually like and take. We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:43.700]  that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:49.220]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and

[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:08.660]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:11.780]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:27.300]  We put out a 35-minute documentary that we aired during the 28-hour broadcast last week
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:34.100]  that I shot with Rob Dew and Buckley Hammond in Rome about a month ago.
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:41.300]  Leo Zagami, of course, is a documentary filmmaker himself, author, researcher,
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:45.140]  and I remember seeing his information probably six, seven, eight years ago
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:50.100]  and thinking, you know, this guy's speculating. I mean, I knew he'd been involved with the Vatican.
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:55.140]  I knew he'd been involved with some Masons high level, a lot of powerful Masonic groups there
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:59.620]  in and around the Vatican. I knew a lot of what he was saying was accurate. I don't
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:04.260]  plan to be a Vatican expert, but from what I'd researched, but he said that Jesuits will put
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:11.940]  in a pope. It'll probably be this particular guy who's now Pope Francis. He said him or one other
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:17.700]  person. He said that they were going to blackmail with the pedophile scandals that they controlled,
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:23.620]  the Vatican that they would announce world government, and I saw him talk about it. I
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:31.060]  heard him talk about it. I saw him in project Camelot hour long plus interviews and people asked,
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:34.740]  what do you think of this guy? And I said, well, you know, I know they're not supposed to put a
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:41.860]  Jesuit in as the Pope. And I said, I'll wait and see. Well, we wait and saw what happened.
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:52.820]  And indeed it did end up unfolding that way. And so I want him to talk a little bit about
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:59.860]  himself, but then tell us what he thinks is coming next with all of this with the Vatican,
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:04.020]  because even if you're not a Catholic, there are a billion people plus that say they're Catholics.
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:08.500]  And clearly you can see the leadership of the church has been doing everything you can to
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:14.020]  destroy the Catholic Church. And now that's accelerating. And now the liberal media that
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:19.940]  is always demonizing Catholics is suddenly praising it as if this guy can do no wrong and is a Messiah.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:27.540]  And years after Zagami talked about blackmail to bring in a Jesuit black pope, as he calls it,
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:32.100]  even the one in Guardian had a story basically saying that that had happened.
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:40.260]  So here is that report. The core of the, of what's going on, they are observing us now,
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:44.100]  Alex. You have to understand everything that we are saying is being monitored.
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:51.460]  You know, when the Pope resigned what happened in the Vatican, there was a big storm and there
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:56.420]  was a lightning that just went on. So you see, like this night, there's a lightning, you see?
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:13.460]  Experts from the Vatican themselves admitted there is a very close link between
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:22.020]  pedophilia and Satanism. Then they used to have these ambulances, these fake ambulances
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:26.660]  parked in front of their administration. And they used to pick up these young Romanian kids,
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:30.180]  14 year old kids and bring them directly into the Vatican.
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:38.900]  That's just the intro to that piece. The demonic possession of the Vatican exposed.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:49.220]  It's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv. Now, again, there's a lot of questions I have for
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:58.260]  Mr. Zagami, but first of those points, I want him to just briefly talk about
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:06.180]  Pope Francis himself, where he came from, his history, his background. And then, Leo, I want
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:12.180]  you to break down your awakening, your experiences and how you were able to predict that they would
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:19.780]  six, seven years ago, probably longer time flies, eight years ago, predict that they would put a
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:25.060]  Jesuit for the first time ever Pope in charge and you were even able to name who you thought it
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:30.900]  would probably be. So was that from your larger research, putting pieces together or did you
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:37.940]  have inside sources? Because that is really stunning. It's inside sources because in 2005,
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:47.700]  when we saw in April 2005, the election of Ratzinger, actually Ratzinger was just a minute,
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:54.660]  but there was already an attempted placing of Bergoglio as a pope. Actually, at one point,
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:13:00.580]  they kind of opted on Ratzinger because it was the least problematic choice because they
[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:06.420]  actually pink Pope, Tercizio Bertone, who was then Cardinal of State, was trying to get elected
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:14.420]  himself. And so to avoid having Tercizio Bertone, Cardinal Martini, who is this Jesuit, who actually
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:24.580]  a few months before he died in June 2012, he asked Ratzinger to resign. And this is actually
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:35.940]  been confirmed also by a Jesuit father who then died this year. He died leaving this testimony.
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:42.740]  He was the main collaborator of Cardinal Martini, this important Jesuit and Cardinal of Milan.
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:53.140]  And he confirmed, at one point in June 2012, during the meeting of families, the one that
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:59.380]  now is going to take place in Philadelphia, he went to Ratzinger and said, we can't do really
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:06.580]  much with this courier. You have to resign. So if the courier does not reform, it's time to leave.
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:12.340]  That's the exact words he said that were reported by this Jesuit, Silvano Fausti. So basically,
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:17.300]  here we are talking about facts that are proven. There's plenty of evidence. This evidence, of
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:22.100]  course, is not easy to find. I am an insider. I have my own experience. Maybe we'll talk about
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:30.500]  this later. But in any case, Pope Francis escalated this time. He failed in 2005, but he eventually
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:36.820]  got in when the scandals behind Ratzinger made it very easy for the Jesuits to say to him,
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:43.460]  just go aside because we have to take over the show. This is synthetically what's been happening.
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:49.300]  Regarding the little girl that you were talking about, you know that guy who picks her up,
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:54.420]  the bald guy with the glasses, who actually brings her to the pope, you see her on the image.
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:15:03.700]  He's a very important guy. He is General Domenico Gianni. He is not wearing his, of course, his
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:10.020]  inspector general kind of divisa he has when he's in the Vatican, when he's in America with the pope.
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:16.980]  But he's a very high level member of the Knights of Malta, and he takes care of the pope's security.
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:22.500]  Also, it's complete rubbish that the pope doesn't see TV and he makes this kind of monastic life
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:29.620]  for himself publicly because I know from friends of Domenico Gianni that the pope regularly watches
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:36.100]  TV and he's like any other guy. They just want to make out of him a saint. The important thing
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:42.580]  today after this address to Congress, I think you will agree with me, Alex, is to understand these
[01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:50.260]  people that he actually met. Leo Zagami, hold on, your Skype is breaking up and we have a lot
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:56.100]  of new listeners tuning in. We can get into the inside baseball on this, but bottom line,
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:16:00.020]  we've had a Vatican coup, there'd been infiltration, there'd been problems before,
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:08.740]  but clearly there's been a takeover after 1800 years, the most anti-family, globalist,
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:14.900]  communist, socialist move ever. How are Catholics going to buy this when it's so
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:21.220]  different and so opposite from what we've heard from other popes and Catholic doctrine?
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:27.380]  And what is the end game now? What does it signify that the pope is calling for planetary
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:33.220]  government, that the pope is calling for global carbon taxes, and that the pope is pushing all
[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:39.780]  of this? What does it mean? Well, it's very clear from mentioning Thomas Merton and Dorothy Day.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:47.300]  Do you know these two characters are? These are communists. I mean, Thomas Merton and Dorothy
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:53.060]  Day was accused herself of being a communist. He addressed these two people in Congress.
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:58.260]  I mean, it's quite obvious what he's doing. She advocated the Catholic economic theory of
[01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:06.100]  distributism, which basically is this communism style that is spring out of the Jesuit creed.
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:13.620]  And of course, I mean, there is plenty of evidence for this, who this Thomas Merton is,
[01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:18.740]  and he was not even that kind of a devout Catholic. He actually converted to Zen Buddhism.
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:27.140]  We have a new pope pushing ecumenicalism, merging all the religions. What do you make
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:31.140]  of the headlines I saw last week in the Washington Times and others, that there is a conservative
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:35.780]  rebellion inside the Vatican and that Cardinals have been going and warning him?
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:43.780]  Well, unfortunately, there is, I mean, to this conservative rebellion, a very strong opposition
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:50.420]  are people who we are now seeing in the United States, leading the pope. And one of these people,
[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:58.100]  the key people is Carl A. Anderson, who led the procession of the Knights of Columbus yesterday
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:04.180]  during the canonization of the new saint. And he is also one of the main advisor for the world
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:10.740]  meeting of families, which is taking place in Philadelphia. So basically, the Knights of Columbus
[01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:16.660]  lobbied for this new saint, who, you know, very well, wasn't a saint. He was somebody who was
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:22.420]  converting people by the whip and the musket by force. And he had a lot of opposition even these
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:29.380]  days amongst the native Americans, which think the whole thing is disgraceful. So this going
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:36.580]  then tomorrow to the United Nations and blessing, basically, what is the kickstart for Agenda 2030
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:42.020]  seems quite obvious to all of us. Now, for those that don't know what Agenda 2030 is,
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:49.220]  explain to them how it's phase two of the global treaty of Rio de Janeiro, the Agenda 21 program.
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:56.260]  Well, basically, there is a 17 key points. But it's very interesting also to see who has been
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:19:00.580]  chosen to actually represent, you know, the various countries and how this whole process
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:07.060]  is being done. Because John Pothista, who is at the moment, the key, the person who is in charge
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:14.980]  of the whole campaign of Hillary Clinton is one also of the key persons in this Agenda 2030
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:23.220]  that basically will marry fully what the Pope has already announced in Congress and will probably
[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:30.580]  reannounce again tomorrow, amplifying the whole thing in front of the United Nations that we
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:36.740]  have all to suffer. We have to pay carbon tax. They can continue getting rich and rich. We
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:40.660]  have to remind the people who John Pothista is. I mean, we're talking about the person who has
[01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:48.500]  been working for Lockheed Martin. Stay there, Leo Zagami. We're going to try to reconnect with
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:54.100]  his Skype, maybe get him on the phone. But it's audible. What's important is the information

[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:16.980]  Leo Zagami is our guest. I've seen him in countless documentaries. I've, of course, had dinner with
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:22.580]  him and hung out with him in Rome. Extremely informed. He just rattles off all these names,
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:28.980]  all this information in Latin. He took us over to where the Jesuit order is based,
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:35.220]  where the Knights of Malta is based. And it really is a paradox because I've seen the Catholic Church
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:41.460]  do a lot of good work, stand up for human life, stand up against communism, stand up against
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:46.820]  big corporations and globalism. I know it has a checkered past. Any ancient organization would,
[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:52.020]  but I don't just judge people, but this new pope is so aligned with the club of Rome,
[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:58.980]  so aligned with the UN, so aligned with the EU, so aligned with globalism. He doesn't oppose
[01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:05.860]  a baby selling, baby parts selling. He doesn't oppose any of the big globalist agendas.
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:11.140]  And now he's trying to get rid of our borders and running stunts with anchor babies
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:17.060]  this morning on his procession to Congress and Congress is crying. It's like when we have the
[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:23.860]  Queen of England visit and everyone's fawning and worshiping royalty. I mean, it's a fraud,
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:30.020]  but this is now religious royalty. When you're at the Vatican, they say we are the oldest continuing
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:36.820]  sovereign, you know, leader in the world, tax exempt, you know, supreme ruler of earth. I mean,
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:42.820]  it's just like, whoa. And now our Congress is bowing down to it. Leo, this is a short
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:46.580]  segment, long segment coming up. We're going to put the phones up for people. But bottom line,
[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:53.060]  you got cut off by the break. World government, world taxes, UN announcement, this big treaty
[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:58.260]  in December where they're openly announcing planetary regime. In his words, are they making
[01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:03.300]  their move naked because they're behind scheduled and they're concerned? Or is it because they
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:08.260]  think for some reason they're invincible? Because what they're doing is really waking people up,
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:14.500]  but they seem to be so arrogant. And I look at this Pope, he just has a wolf-like look in his
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:20.100]  eyes that I've never seen in a Pope's face. I mean, Pope John Paul II, people have mixed
[01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:24.660]  feelings about, but he was anti-communist. I know you've been critical of him to some degree,
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:30.020]  but he didn't look like a raving power mad Emperor Palpatine. What's going on here?
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:37.940]  Well, as you know, maybe the liberation theology factor is very important. And actually, Pope
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:44.020]  Francis was not a supporter of any kind of liberation theology during the 70s and 80s.
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:49.540]  He became, after the fall of the Soviet war, a supporter of liberation theology like Pope
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:57.140]  Bismondiarist people. It's like they use ideologies just as a tool. And of course, now the communist
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:03.460]  agenda is on top of all of it. But I don't know if you know about a book that has been,
[01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:08.020]  unfortunately, not published in the English language by a journalist, an Argentinian journalist
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:14.340]  called Horacio Verbinski. It's called The Island of Silence. He denounced Pope Francis with a lot
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:20.820]  of documentation that proved that in the 70s, he was behind the arrest of these two Jesuits who
[01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:28.260]  were later tortured called Orando Iorio and Francisco Jalix. These two priests, one of them
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:34.340]  after this experience, stayed at Jesuit. The other one actually came out of the Jesuit order
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:41.460]  and later on died. This Francisco Jalix, when the Pope was elected, he was forced to say that
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:47.700]  everything he had written or stated earlier was not true and that the Pope was completely innocent.
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:55.300]  But this is not the case. Pope Francis was actively involved in this situation of these
[01:27:55.300 --> 01:28:01.380]  two priests for six months arrested and tortured. And actually, he even went to visit them during
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:06.980]  these six months at this place called the Navy School of Mechanics, which is there in Buenos
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:12.100]  Aires where they were held. And he basically didn't do anything for them. In the end,
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:18.260]  the Vatican eventually intervened and they were released. But this demonstrates to you
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:23.700]  that this pope really has a lot of skeletons in the closet. And he's definitely no saint
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:28.260]  as they want to portray now in the US. I mean, it's thickening the level of propaganda that
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:34.980]  they're pulling off these days with John Biden on the side crying and also the other guy,
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:40.580]  John Bernard, the same. I mean, this is completely ridiculous. I mean, even for us here in Italy
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:44.740]  to see the show yesterday at the White House, it was like watching something out of a whole
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:50.340]  Disney movie. Well, even yourself pointed out on the music with the titty-titty. I mean, it was
[01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:58.180]  yes. And then there was the product placement for Fiat. But Fiat is not any more an Italian
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:03.300]  company. Fiat Chrysler now is a company that doesn't even have any more any headquarters.
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:08.580]  It's multinational. It's been moved officially since last year outside of Italian territory.
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:14.980]  So they have nothing to do with Italy. Agnelli, who was one of the dynasty's most important
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:19.940]  persons and now he died for a few years and left in the hands of this Elcan family. Well,
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:25.380]  Agnelli was a best friend with David Rockefeller. I mean, we are talking here some very powerful
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:31.140]  people behind the whole thing. So of course, there is product placement and it's obvious to
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:35.380]  all of us. It's a giant, huge corporate rollout. So when we come back, I want to get an answer to
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:39.540]  that question. You got great audio now. Leo Zagami, the consummate Vatican insider.
[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:43.780]  Why are they making their move right now? Is it because they're strong or because they're weak?
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:49.220]  Who runs the Catholic Church now? Is this even the Catholic Church? I mean, who is the Specter
[01:29:49.220 --> 01:30:01.220]  Grouch? The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. A new global news fact
[01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:07.300]  checking project was announced yesterday and it will be funded by two organizations with close
[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:14.260]  ties to the Obama White House. The project, which says it will be focused on holding public officials
[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:20.580]  accountable, is funded by grants from the Omitier Network and the National Endowment for Democracy.
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:26.900]  The Omitier Network is headed up by eBay founder Pierre Omitier. Visitor logs reveal that Omitier
[01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:33.460]  has visited the White House a half a dozen times since 2009. The National Endowment for Democracy,
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:40.820]  NED, is infamously known for their role in uprisings, attempted coups, and acts of regime change.
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:46.820]  So it's Operation Mockingbird all over again as these connections clearly illustrate how the
[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:54.340]  White House-funded news fact checking project will undoubtedly be yet another exercise in spin
[01:30:54.340 --> 01:31:02.260]  and manipulation. You can learn more right now at infowars.com. Many of the products at infowarslife.com
[01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:07.220]  are true game changers. They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:12.180]  prescription. But when we look at a product like Survival Shield, Nace and Iodine X2, it's something
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:16.180]  that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years. The federal government
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:21.780]  mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form of it be added to table salt because
[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:26.260]  of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency and iodine was causing. I want to
[01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:30.900]  challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves. What do you have to lose? You are the

[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:44.820]  to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock. We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:49.620]  and that is about to sell out. It may be a month or two until more comes in. I want to challenge

[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:19.300]  in different parts of the world. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:27.700]  David Knight was on with us via Skype from DC, about to follow the Pope to New York,
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:33.700]  readdresses the UN, and then from there to Philly with Jakari Jackson. We'll have that throughout
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:41.220]  the weekend. And he was really upset because he was watching different talking heads in the hotel
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:44.500]  room and they were just all saying, it's not political, it's good. You're not allowed to
[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:52.100]  criticize the Pope because he's not political. See, he gets political big time. I mean, really
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:57.620]  hardcore globalist, hardcore eugenics agenda. We're talking about a billion dead in a decade
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:01.380]  of these carbon taxes go in. I'm not exaggerating. That's a conservative number.
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:08.420]  I have nauseous levels of empathy for the third world when I think about this.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:14.900]  It'd be like knowing they're going to kill a kid across town today at noon and I can't stop it.
[01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:21.860]  See, your brain can handle one kid getting killed and by handle it, it can think about it so you
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:25.940]  get sick. When I say imagine a two-year-old being raped in a dungeon, they're going to be killed
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:31.540]  in one hour, you get physically sick if you have empathy. Imagine hundreds of millions of kids.
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:38.980]  Your brain can't even wrap itself around that. I know mine can. And what's weird is,
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:42.980]  I'm intellectually sitting back going, come on, you're exaggerating. And then I pull back and
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:47.220]  I go, no, those are Lord Monkton's numbers and other numbers and you know the numbers.
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:54.580]  It's a death sentence for a billion people. And then I see some guy in this huge jet with all
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:35:00.740]  these guards saying he's against wealth and shooting his mouth off about helping poor people
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:07.060]  by trying to wreck the industrialized West while stopping the third world from industrializing
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:09.540]  because he wants a giant horde of idiots to follow him.
[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:17.780]  Hope Francis is a bigger threat than the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union was despicable,
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:22.900]  it was corrupt, it was evil, it was falling apart. But evil's biggest trick is getting
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:27.860]  good people to follow it. And I just got to say, I've grown up around Catholics my whole life.
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:34.020]  They are great, funny, nice, hardworking, smart people. And they're not hypocrites either.
[01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:38.820]  I found them to be Christian people that love God, but they won't get on you if you're drinking a beer.
[01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:43.700]  I like Catholics, the Catholics I've known. And that's why I've not attacked them.
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:50.580]  This pope is a sickening piece of trash. And that's all I'm saying. And people need to turn
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:54.740]  against him big time. I don't care what the Jesuits do to me or what type of stuff they try to pull,
[01:35:54.740 --> 01:36:00.900]  I could care less. They tried to stop William Harris from bringing those Bibles in from New
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:06.900]  York and you saw how that worked in Texas. So I'm not worried about any of it. I got God on my side.
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:12.260]  The God I follow has the keys, the temporal and spiritual power, not this puppet.
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:19.380]  And that's all I have to say on the subject. I'm going to go back to Leo Zagami here in a minute,
[01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:25.460]  but this is really tearing me up because the fact that they got a pope out in the open calling for
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:31.220]  world government in carbon taxes and saying, don't be so obsessed with abortion and not saying a word
[01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:37.300]  about the baby harvesting. This is just the beginning. And by the way, it's Protestant churches
[01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:42.580]  are pushing gun control now and all the government has taken over the churches. So my question to
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:47.540]  Mr. Zagami, we're going to go to him in a moment is we know there's been infiltration groups,
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:52.100]  we know there's been factions want to run the Vatican. What is this faction running things now?
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:57.780]  Is there any Catholic church left? It's not a Leo group, a Catholic. And I want to give this
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:07.860]  take on that. And then we're going to take your phone calls at 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:12.020]  And a lot of folks yourself are still saying, I don't care if the stock market crashes.
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:18.500]  Well, the stock market affects you because it affects all the companies in the economy.
[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:22.820]  Or I don't care if the Catholic church is run by the New World Order. I'm not a Catholic.
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:28.420]  Well, it's a billion people. You got like a billion, 300 million people that are Islamic,
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:33.140]  they're being radicalized. Now the Catholics are going to be radicalized in the leftist garbage,
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:39.460]  the leftist or ally with the radical Muslims. That's 2.3 billion people under New World Order
[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:49.460]  controlled. Then you add the 800 million Protestants or whatever, always busy fighting with each other.
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:57.940]  You can really see how the evil is going to take over. 800-259-9231.
[01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:02.580]  And a lot of Catholic experts tell me the communists really took over in the 50s.
[01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:06.100]  We'll get Leo Zagami's quick answers to all this in a moment. So I want to move quick. We'll have
[01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:11.700]  him back up, obviously, in the future for an extended interview. This broadcast is listener
[01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:16.500]  supported. We didn't meet our goal with the money bomb, but with satellites, closed captioning,
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:22.980]  reporters, flying people around. A million dollars is just enough to be able to know that we can
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:30.260]  operate for the next year at the current level and not destroy our small reserves that any
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:35.380]  organization should have. I intend to expend the reserves, regardless, because things are getting
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:40.420]  so serious. We're going to put all our energy into this and just hope and pray that it has the
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:44.020]  effect we think it will. Everything we've done has always been successful. Every launch has
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:49.700]  always been successful in different ways. And so in my gut, I can tell we are really reaching
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:53.140]  more people than ever. We see the numbers. And in my gut, I think this is going to be successful,
[01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:58.100]  so pray for us. But it's a daily support that's needed, spreading the word, telling your friends
[01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:04.340]  and family about the broadcast, sharing videos, sharing clips, sharing articles, buying high quality

[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:52.900]  more comes in. A true game changer. We've got Deep Cleanse. I thought that was sold out.
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:40:00.740]  Can you click on that? Or did it come back in? Because I knew Deep Cleanse sold out. It was
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:04.420]  in the verge of selling out. The point is, all those products are excellent. I want to thank you
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:08.740]  all for your support. It takes money to fly to Rome. It takes money to make these documentaries.
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:13.460]  It takes money to send our reporters to follow the Pope. It takes money to cover Bohemian Grove.
[01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:18.420]  It takes money to cover vaccine damage. And we really appreciate you getting high quality products

[01:40:56.420 --> 01:41:02.420]  your books some before you leave as well, some in English, some in Italian. But you've heard my
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:06.500]  questions, just try to answer them because you really are an expert, accurately predicted that
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:10.500]  they would put a judgment pope in, name the guy, one of two you thought it would be,
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:14.740]  there was a blackmail going on. That all came out in the news later. So you've been proven correct
[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:20.180]  in spades over and over again. So briefly, tell us about yourself, how you woke up, then
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:24.420]  are they getting stronger? Are they getting weaker? Who runs the Vatican?
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:32.260]  Well, actually, how I woke up, you are probably one of the reasons why in the year 2000, 2001,
[01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:40.180]  I started to wonder what was really going on behind the scenes because even amongst the network of
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:47.460]  Masonic network and of other secret societies, when we saw the Bohemian Grove, it created a debate.
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:55.700]  I remember myself discussing in Lodge, in London, your documentary and actually facing some of the
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:42:00.420]  masters there and telling them, what is this? I mean, how is it possible that Tony Blair goes
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:05.140]  and participates in something like this or that world leaders are involved with something like
[01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:13.300]  this? And of course, this inspiration that you gave me at one point put me in front of the reality
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:19.540]  of what I had in these lodges, in these secret societies that I was involved in and I decided
[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:25.220]  that I no longer wanted to be involved, especially when I discovered some of their secrets.
[01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:32.660]  Of course, the lower level never know what's going on at the upper levels. So it was by
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:39.460]  the possibility of climbing suddenly this ladder that I was able to see that it wasn't something
[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:45.700]  I wanted to be any longer a participant with, especially after the phone call I had once
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:53.380]  with Marchinkus, which was, as you know, a very important bishop. He died around nearly 10 years
[01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:59.700]  ago, who was in charge and very much in charge of the Vatican at the time of John Paul II,
[01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:05.380]  who the Italian government wanted to arrest, but the Vatican simply sent to the US. This is what
[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:12.340]  they do. They don't get their people arrested. When last year was asked that Cardinal was arrested
[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:17.780]  for pedophilia, they just picked him up and made him reside in the Vatican until he eventually
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:24.900]  died of his sickness a month ago. And this is because they protect him, because of course,
[01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:30.260]  if this Cardinal who was part of the pedophilia ring that is running the Vatican will talk,
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:36.260]  it will put in trouble a lot of people, because there is two factions. The main factions now
[01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:43.860]  is the Jesuit who is working with the Mongolists to try to save the facade of the Catholic Church.
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:49.540]  And then there is the gay lobby, which is headed by this Cardinal called Tarchizio Bertone,
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:55.300]  and who worked in collaboration with, right with that guy who picked up that little girl,
[01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:59.860]  that guy called Dominico Gianni, who is one of the most powerful people in the Vatican,
[01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:07.220]  even if he's unknown to the American public. He is one of the reasons why the Pope has not
[01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:13.620]  been able to totally kick out the pedophilia rings, because he, together with Tarchizio Bertone,
[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:20.580]  run this check. So you're saying that the Jesuits use the weakness that the pedophile lobby created
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:24.580]  to come in and take over. You're saying they're two different factions. They're two different
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:30.020]  factions. But how does the Dominicans tie in? Aren't they a third faction? The Dominicans,
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:34.340]  unfortunately, have been infiltrated a long time ago. In fact, the guy who founded the
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:39.140]  Liberation Theology was himself a Dominican. So there is a conservative faction within the
[01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:44.180]  Dominican. There is also a conservative faction within other orders. And it's thanks to these
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:48.980]  conservatives who I have access to a lot of information, which I give in my book called
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:53.940]  Francis the Last Pope. So there is good people in the Vatican. So are they doing this because
[01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:58.340]  they're weak or because they're strong? Why is the church openly joining with world government?
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:06.820]  At this point, there is no more church. I mean, now it's been completely taken over. The Jesuits
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:13.940]  are just an emanation of this globalist agenda. Since 1958, the church has been compromised.
[01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:19.700]  These old traditional Catholics know this. And when they started with the Second Vatican Council,
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:25.220]  the church was completely compromised and has never been going back. After that, there was no
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:32.900]  going back because we had Freemason's Pope. I mean, we had Ron Cali, who became a Pope in 1958,
[01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:37.780]  was a Freemason. Then we have Montini, who was also Freemason. These are not ordinary Mason.
[01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:44.980]  These are people who were connected to also the Zionist agenda, which in turn was linked
[01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:50.180]  with the Jesuit agenda. So here we can't really blame only one faction for all the troubles of
[01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:55.540]  the world, as you know very well, Alex, after all these years of doing excellent reports.
[01:45:56.580 --> 01:46:02.180]  It's something much more complex. There is a hierarchy structure. There is compartmentalized.
[01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:07.620]  And of course, they work together. The main factions are the Jesuits together with the
[01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:14.980]  Zionists. This is to summarize it in a very synthetic form. And what is the end goal of the
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:22.100]  top people running this whole planetary program? Of course, the main goal is to maintain the
[01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:28.980]  privileges of the aristocrats who officially have lost their royalty status, but are still there,
[01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:33.380]  apart from the English royal family, which still keeps that royalty status quite alive,
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:41.060]  but transforming the EU in the new sacred Roman empire. Because this is really, in a way, also
[01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:45.620]  the fulfilling of the scriptures is something that has been even prophesied. So it's very
[01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:51.300]  interesting. Sure. The Club of Rome, all of it, the Treaty of Rome 57 created the European Union.
[01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:58.100]  Absolutely. And this European Union now is enslaving and imposing on the European people,
[01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:06.100]  all these immigrants, the constant chaos in the streets every night in Rome, when you were even
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:11.220]  around. There were huge demonstrations, yeah, clashes. But there were clashes. There were
[01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:17.460]  actually riots in the streets. There were immigrants who invaded buildings without having
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:21.700]  any permit. They just simply invaded the building because it's empty. And then after that, you can't
[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:28.020]  kick them out any longer. So what they do, they pick up the immigrants at the train station,
[01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:33.460]  and they bring them to these buildings where they themselves actually break down the entrance,
[01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:38.580]  and then they say, take over the building. I mean, this is what happens these days in Rome
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:44.900]  at night. So it's quite incredible, this situation. We have, of course, what's happening in Hungary,
[01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:52.100]  what's happening in all the borders. I mean, this huge immigration is made for us to, of course,
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:58.980]  become more controlled. And in the end, you know, they will keep on making more money.
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:03.540]  And we will keep on being more and more. Sure, sure. They don't want a homogenous
[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:08.580]  population. Take Mexico. If it was powerful and wealthy, the globalists want to bring in groups
[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:13.380]  and divide it up so that the Mexicans could ever get together politically and throw out
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:17.700]  the outside globalist group. You've got the outside global corporations bringing in their own
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:24.100]  client groups that will then basically work and speak for them, like 21st century mercenaries.
[01:48:24.100 --> 01:48:28.020]  And that's all stated. It's all admitted. I want to go to some phone calls with Leo Zagami
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:34.340]  here joining us before he leaves us, though, in the next segment. Briefly, tell folks how they
[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:39.060]  get your latest book, which I've read. It's excellent. In English, The Last Pope. And why you
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:48.500]  say he's the last pope? Pope Francis, the last pope, because nowadays the sacrality of the pope,
[01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:53.860]  the office of the pope has been destroyed after the resignation of Ratzinger, the last pope,
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:49:00.100]  because possibly after this pope, we will not have any more Catholic church as we were used to,
[01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:08.100]  and it will be this Mondalist church, ecumenical church made of many different creeds. And so,
[01:49:08.100 --> 01:49:12.100]  I don't know if you noticed, but yesterday, during the canonization, all the cardinals
[01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:17.620]  were dressed in white and like the pope. There was no difference. By the way, you said that,
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:21.300]  because we have like five hours that you're talking, you said they'll probably get two or
[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:26.420]  three popes, then a whole council. It's all about devolving power so no one can target the
[01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:31.300]  organization and having oligarch councils, and that's what a communist system would do,
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:35.780]  and that's exactly what they're doing now. In fact, I'm very worried, really,
[01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:41.780]  for the meeting that is going to be taking place between Obama and Putin, because Putin
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:47.460]  could be the only real opposition to this whole setup, but he probably just gonna
[01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:53.780]  marry into the whole thing and make these bricks just the fake opposition to the World Bank.
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:59.940]  I mean, so in that case, let's say that the meetings that will take place in the next few
[01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:04.260]  days in New York are probably the most important meetings of the new millennium.
[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:07.300]  Absolutely, and our reporters know that we're going to be here covering it.
[01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:12.660]  Let me ask you this question on Leo. I've studied Putin. He's obviously a hardcore guy,
[01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:16.660]  but he's trying to promote family, trying to promote having kids. They don't put flour on the
[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:21.860]  water. His best friend's a newscaster. I'm going to skip this break, last one of the day. His best
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:27.060]  friend's a newscaster that basically sounds like my show, and I've been told by the head of RT
[01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:31.060]  America years ago, the State Department didn't want me on there anymore, which is fine,
[01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:36.820]  it's not that big of a deal, that they were upset that I was on there and that basically
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:42.260]  the directors of RT, both in Russia and here are huge listeners. I was told this by their
[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:45.940]  producers, by their top people, and told this in LA. I'm just going to leave it at that,
[01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:49.700]  where they have one of their main offices, and that the Russian government actually watches
[01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:53.860]  this show. Now imagine you're told this, it's not a way to flatter me or get me to support them.
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:57.860]  I'm not in with the Russians. They don't need me. I'm just promoting national sovereignty,
[01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:02.660]  anti-globalism, which allows Russia to continue on. I want Russia to be there. I want America to
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:06.980]  be there. I want diversity in countries. I want sovereignty. I'm just a patriot for humanity,
[01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:12.260]  a patriot for sovereignty, a patriot for due process, a patriot for firewalls, to tyranny,
[01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:17.380]  that's what countries are. But I was told this five years ago, six, seven years ago,
[01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:22.740]  I thought, oh, you're just wanting me to be flattered, so I support you. They're like, no,
[01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:28.980]  no, we're not. And now I've seen, because these Russians were in awe every time they came here,
[01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:34.660]  then I've seen now out of Russian television, it's like it's Alex Jones on Russian TV.
[01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:39.540]  It looks like the Russians might have caught an anti-New World Order bug. I know that Putin
[01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:44.100]  started secretly meeting with Alexander Shultz and Nietzsche a lot, reportedly apologized to him.
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:48.660]  Now he's become a big Orthodox Christian, like underground, and thinks he's got to,
[01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:56.260]  you know, save Christendom. Or is that PR bull? Or is this how God works in mysterious ways?
[01:51:57.620 --> 01:52:04.820]  Orthodox Church up until now has been the only real opposition to the Catholic agenda,
[01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:11.220]  which is really becoming anti-Christian by all nature. And you see this yourself. So
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:17.140]  if the Orthodox Church is genuine, in that case, we are in front of a great clash
[01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:23.300]  that is about to happen, because it started in Ukraine between Catholics and Orthodox,
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:29.940]  is now manifesting to a full scale with this second Cold War. So I think that we will see
[01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:34.900]  in the next few days in New York, if this is really a charade, or if there is really
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:38.660]  about to start something that could become a clash of influence.
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:42.740]  Will you come on with us Monday after we've seen what happens this weekend and tomorrow
[01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:45.620]  and give us your analysis on what you think it means, whether it was real or not?
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:52.580]  Sure, why not? I will be fully available for that, and it's a pleasure to be on Infowars,
[01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:56.260]  because nowadays the Italian media will never have me again on.
[01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:59.300]  Yeah, that's a whole other subject. I looked it up and found the news articles. You didn't
[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:05.140]  make a big deal about it. You actually got grabbed by Vatican officers, taken to a facility
[01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:10.340]  outside Rome, and then thrown back on the street. I mean, they are really after you.
[01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:17.140]  Yeah, well, I mean, it's incredible. I mean, to be brought actually forcibly in an ambulance,
[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:22.340]  in an hospital, and then apparently you think you are in a hospital, and suddenly you have a
[01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:27.460]  doctor who is actually a priest arriving in front of you, both with the doctor thing and the priestly
[01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:32.340]  thing here, and then a bunch of monks arriving in the morning. I mean, it was pretty scary,
[01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:39.460]  definitely. So I am trying to keep myself now low profile and avoiding these kind of problems,
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:44.740]  and simply by not involving myself any more in Italian politics, because it's a lost cause in
[01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:50.420]  any case. That's right. You ended up running for office, being involved with the Nationalist Party,
[01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:57.380]  or giving the proper name, and then I guess... It was basically the, it's a party of the
[01:53:57.380 --> 01:54:02.740]  Berlusconi Coalition known as the Grande Soudre, which is basically a party for the south of Italy,
[01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:07.940]  which was quite prominent a few years ago. And of course, your family's been quite prominent
[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:12.420]  in politics. That's one reason you were also given entrance into some of these more secret orders.
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:19.860]  Yes. My grandfather was a senator. He even marched on Rome with Mussolini back in the days,
[01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:27.860]  and not that that can be something. But in any case, I have had the possibility of being an insider.
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:34.340]  And the crazy thing is that when I actually went against the president of Italy live on TV,
[01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:40.340]  the producer of the show on Rai Uno, which is the main Italian state channel, came to me
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:45.780]  and said, how is possible you're doing this to us? You are one of us. You are bourgeois. You are
[01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:51.220]  not a peasant. You are not one of them of the masses. You have to be with us. I said, I'm not.
[01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:58.340]  Forget it. So, I mean, that was it for me in Italy. And immediately after that, soon after,
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:03.220]  I was basically, they broke down into my house. They broke my door in the morning,
[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:08.500]  all kinds of things happened, which I will not now describe it, because it will take time from
[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:14.980]  your transmission. But it wasn't pleasant. I mean, democracy is inexistent when you oppose the system.
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:20.180]  Absolutely. Let's go to some phone calls here. We're going to take you to the next segment,
[01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:24.420]  then we've got another special guest on geoengineering, breaking into the mainstream news
[01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:28.900]  with the California situation. Let's go to Dion in Illinois. Thanks for holding
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:35.780]  you're on the air with Leo Zagami. Yeah. Argentina writer Pedro Salon claimed that
[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:42.660]  Fidel Castro made a prophetic quote in 1973 that the U.S. will come to talk to us when they have
[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:48.420]  a black president and the world has a Latin American pope. And Fidel Castro had a address to
[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:53.700]  a teacher and when he went to Cuba, they changed the book. So, I don't know if you know what the
[01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:58.020]  books were about and how did Fidel Castro know? It's funny you say that. I remember hearing that
[01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:01.620]  over a decade ago. I don't really place it where. I remember hearing what you just said.
[01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:06.820]  Great question, Leo. What's your intel on the fact that the pope went to there and didn't
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:11.140]  criticize their half a million political dissidents in jail, but came here and criticized our prisons?
[01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:17.940]  How could he criticize? Fidel Castro was brought up by the Jesuits and his brother was even more
[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:22.100]  brought up by the Jesuits because he went to the Jesuits since elementary school. I mean,
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:26.740]  we're talking here about people who were educated by the Jesuits for their agenda. So,
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:34.180]  of course they knew what was about to happen. Good question, Dion. It's unbelievable. And again,
[01:56:34.180 --> 01:56:42.820]  we're not saying it's Catholic. Plus Castro is a 33 degree Freemason and this is not known also
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:48.500]  of Che Guevara. They think that he was the great rebel, which probably he was in his head, but
[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:53.780]  they are all 33 degree Freemasons. Freemason has never been persecuted in Cuba during the
[01:56:53.780 --> 01:57:01.220]  war. Well, I've read Che Guevara's book and he calls Indians, natives, brown people, subhuman,
[01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:06.740]  idiots, morons, mentally retarded, and complains that Latin America could take over, but the people
[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:12.260]  are too stupid. And that's A, that's not true. B, it's very racist. People don't understand that
[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:18.980]  Che Guevara was a super hyper elitist racist pig. And I see a round-skinned Mesoamericans
[01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:24.020]  wearing Che Guevara shirts. I want to slap them upside the head. Sorry, go ahead. Well,
[01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:30.740]  now you're going to see this pope becoming the leader of all South America because South America
[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:36.820]  is full of liberation theology and of Communists and they're all gathering together with the
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:43.140]  Pope Francis in this New World Order setup. So, I mean, we don't really stand a chance when Obama
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:49.060]  himself said that he will bypass Congress for agenda 2015. Well said. Another quick question.
[01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:52.980]  Let's talk to Nick and Pennsylvania. Go ahead. You're on the air.
[01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:57.140]  Alex, hi. How you doing? Good, brother. Go ahead.
[01:57:58.340 --> 01:58:03.620]  Okay. I have a really important question for Leo. First, I want to say last time I talked to you,
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:08.740]  Alex, your uncle was sick. It was Christmas time. I want to say God bless you, my friend.
[01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:14.340]  I'm sorry to hear that you lost him. Sorry too. Thanks for your support. What was the question,
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:21.700]  brother? The question I have for Leo is I did listen to the pope today in Washington. I heard
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:27.380]  the whole broadcast. Actually, I myself am Catholic and there's some things about this pope I actually
[01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:32.020]  disagree with. Now, this pope... Stay there. Stay there, Nick. I'm going to come back to you.
[01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:35.940]  Then Jeff, Mickey, and Jim, I want to hear what you disagree with him on. I don't think the guys
[01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:39.540]  are Catholic. I mean, he doesn't sound like anybody else. I know it was... I mean, it sounds like a
[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:46.500]  Che Guevara or something. We'll be right back. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:54.100]  I want more candy. I want more video games. Life, life, life. And it's that type of behavior
[01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:59.700]  that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed
[01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:04.900]  to smooth out and help children focus. All of our children are hit with modern mind control,
[01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:10.340]  television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it. Young humans have not yet developed
[01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:15.940]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they
[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:20.660]  can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs. Working with my
[01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:24.980]  team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would
[01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:29.620]  actually like and take. We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are
[01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:34.660]  safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there. Introducing
[01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:40.580]  Childease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients
[01:59:40.580 --> 01:59:46.980]  that taste great. Obtain your Childease today at InfowarsLife.com. That's Childease exclusively
[01:59:46.980 --> 02:00:07.700]  at InfowarsLife.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Big brother, mainstream media,
[02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:16.580]  government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:28.100]  network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. You've never seen such enthusiastic
[02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:33.780]  promotion of the Pope. There's always underhanded snipes and attacks on Catholics. That's because
[02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:37.540]  clearly it wasn't something the globalist totally controlled. Now they love it because they got
[02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:42.260]  control of it. Nick and P.A., go ahead. Thanks for holding your own with Leo Zagami. You were
[02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:47.380]  getting into your Catholic and you heard some things you didn't agree with. Go ahead. Absolutely.
[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:51.140]  And also I'm a Philadelphia resident. I'm hoping I can get through to your show on Sunday because
[02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:56.100]  he's still here in Philly on Saturday and Sunday. But this is my question for you, Leo.
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:01:03.060]  When I listened to the Pope today, he talked about immigration and people coming into America
[02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:08.900]  and then he brought up the Golden Rule. And to me, by doing that, it's like he's trying to put the
[02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:17.140]  guilt trip on America. He's trying to put a guilt trip on our country that we have to bring in
[02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:23.780]  these ill-littles or work bad guys. So this is my question to you. I'm really passionate because
[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:28.500]  I'm a patriot like Alex. Oh yeah. We've been more open than anybody. We've given more free stuff and
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:35.060]  then we get blamed for not doing enough. That's wrong. Absolutely. And I'm just tired of seeing
[02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:40.420]  the American people getting trashed than we are every day. But this is my question to you, Leo.
[02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:46.900]  Will this Pope take 10,000 of auto-littles into his country?
[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:54.820]  Well, this is what happens also in Italy. Here, he puts up the same stunt and in the end,
[02:01:54.820 --> 02:02:00.500]  he ended up guessing basically, I think, six or eight people inside the Vatican saying he
[02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:06.500]  was getting a couple of families, giving the example. And that's it, basically, because he
[02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:13.380]  wanted to make us feel like we have to get them in our houses. So everybody now in every region
[02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:20.660]  of Europe has to prepare to give everything to these immigrants, to these refugees who are
[02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:26.980]  arriving. This is, of course, a technique that he's using both in Europe and in the US. And it
[02:02:26.980 --> 02:02:32.820]  seems like he's working and it's going to be very difficult to stop him when we have these fake
[02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:38.500]  conservatives like the Republicans who are not really doing anything to stop him. Because, I
[02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:44.020]  mean, when you hear the comments of Shepard Smith or people like this, really, I mean, I put my
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:46.980]  hands in the head. Oh, that's what's sick. I appreciate your call, Nick. Great point. We're
[02:02:46.980 --> 02:02:52.020]  going to do five more minutes in the next segment with Mr. Sugami. Then we're going to have a huge
[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:55.940]  in-depth report on geoengineering. It's out in the open. You need to know about it. We have a
[02:02:55.940 --> 02:03:01.940]  special guest joining us. Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Jim in Colorado.
[02:03:01.940 --> 02:03:09.700]  Jim, you're on the air with Leo Sugami. Hi, Alex, long time listener. I'd just like to add a few
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:17.300]  pieces to this final puzzle that we're looking at staring us right in the face. This poll is
[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:27.860]  number 266. 2-6 is plus another 6. Chapter 13, the book Revelation, talks about a beast with
[02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:34.820]  10 horns, seven heads. A free missionary has seven different types of lodges,
[02:03:35.700 --> 02:03:43.940]  and they have their own set of 10 commandments that are in direct opposition to God's 10
[02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:54.980]  commandments. The second beast says it comes out as two horns like a lamb. Those two horns
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:04:03.780]  represent the mitre that the pope and bishops wear. Okay? You there? Now listen. Well, okay.
[02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:12.820]  That represents that hat that the pope and bishops wear. So this pope is the last pope.
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:24.500]  And he's the false prophet. Second beast. And what the whole game plan is, is to go away with
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:31.060]  Christianity worldwide. These nations and these secret societies, these double worshipers,
[02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:36.580]  they all hate Jesus, and they want to get him off the face of the earth. And if you
[02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:45.860]  look in John chapter 6 about what we call the Catholic, the Holy Communion, the Mass,
[02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:51.300]  they're going to try it. They're going to do away with it. And that's talked about in Daniel
[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:57.700]  chapter 12. Alright, listen, interesting points. We're going to get Leo's take.
[02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:02.580]  You've heard of clock kid, right? The boy who removed the insides of a digital clock,
[02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:06.500]  put it in a suitcase, then brought it to school to show his teachers when people got suspicious
[02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:10.900]  he climbed he didn't know anything, refused to talk to police, then gets invited to the White House.
[02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:16.020]  We'll get ready. Now we have Pope kid. That's right. The Daily Mail reports five year old daughter
[02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:20.660]  of illegal immigrants is blessed by Pope after breaking through security barricades hours after
[02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:25.380]  he says mass in Spanish. Sophia Cruz was part of a crowd of thousands lining the papal route in
[02:05:25.380 --> 02:05:29.700]  Washington DC to catch a glimpse of the pontiff. As he passed, she got over police barricades and
[02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:33.300]  ran out into the street in an attempt to approach the Pope mobile. She happened to have a letter
[02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:38.020]  and a yellow t shirt that read Pope rescued Dapa. So the legalization would be your blessing
[02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:41.620]  makes you wonder with all the security theater around how a five year old could get through.
[02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:46.980]  Maybe it's staged. Of course, every five year old's got a letter ready and a t shirt printed
[02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:51.140]  up. Nothing weird about that. Back to the clock kid. Did you know his sister was suspended for
[02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:56.260]  reportedly threatening to blow up the school? Now it all becomes clear. Rob Dew reporting for

[02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:46.180]  the organization in california exposing geoengineering joining us it's made news
[02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:52.020]  across the state as more and more citizens investigate persistent jet condensation trails
[02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:56.980]  known as chemtrails which we're not saying every plane is spraying chemtrails but there is
[02:08:56.980 --> 02:09:02.100]  geoengineering going on it can pull a lot of evidence we're going to be going over today
[02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:08.420]  so stay with us uh leo you just heard that caller uh getting into you know this pope
[02:09:08.420 --> 02:09:14.100]  being the being the false prophet or whatever this is all i know suddenly baptist churches
[02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:21.540]  methodist churches catholic churches universities media the heat's been turned up we're going to
[02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:27.060]  ban the name father and mother boy and girl he she the words we're gonna arrest you if you read
[02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:31.380]  out of the bible we're gonna forcibly inoculate you we're gonna turn your power plants off
[02:09:31.940 --> 02:09:37.140]  we're gonna teach your five-year-olds how to have sex we're gonna i mean they are really it's not
[02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:42.660]  just the catholic church it's what i'm saying it's everything is uncloaking right now and really
[02:09:42.660 --> 02:09:48.580]  showing who they are it looks like a major moves being made i want to jam in a few more calls but
[02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:53.940]  what do you say to what i just stated i think you're perfectly on the ball game because i mean
[02:09:53.940 --> 02:09:59.140]  here we are right at a critical moment of time they are taking completely over they feel secure
[02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:03.940]  for what they're doing they feel that the opposition will not be able to stop them they have the
[02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:10.580]  technology remember now to implement the new world order all that technology that we've been talking
[02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:17.860]  about for many years now is available and of course the mondialist plan wants to connect the human
[02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:25.780]  being and enslave him even more so this agenda in the end wants just to enslave and make every
[02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:32.820]  human not only into a number but into a number that is then valued for the system and you know
[02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:39.860]  this number is valued 100 this human being is valued 200 i mean it's going to be like this it's a
[02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:46.500]  whole situation in which they are just exploiting mankind to enslave him ultimately even with the
[02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:53.300]  microchip in the end leo zegami is our guest jamming in a few final calls before we get into
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:59.620]  geoengineering special with a special guest and in regards to the jesuit we have to remember the
[02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:06.260]  figure of pierre taylor decarden who was the french jesuit who aspired very much the the new age
[02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:10.500]  movement and he was a strong supporter of the one world government and that's an approach
[02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:15.700]  well we had the pope two months ago and again a month ago saying we need a planetary government
[02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:21.140]  to tackle climate change with a carbon tax that's world government with a tax tracking everything
[02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:29.140]  we do that is the one world casual society with the pope calling for it i mean if anybody who was
[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:35.060]  a christian leader called for it i would say they were bad i mean if you know who's the top
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:41.380]  protestant today who would you say that is i mean i don't care who it is if they said that i'd come
[02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:49.700]  out against them if um if we don't do something about it i just don't even know what's going to
[02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:53.620]  end up happening because people think oh big deal there's going to be a world government with that
[02:11:53.620 --> 02:11:57.700]  world government comes total tyranny and what if they were setting up world government right now
[02:11:57.700 --> 02:12:02.580]  and they were being you know promoting freedom i'd still be worried because a centralized system
[02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:08.180]  can take over at any moment and mistakes by a centralized system can be magnified but we know
[02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:12.820]  the globalists are bad through and through we know they have nothing but the end of free will for us
[02:12:12.820 --> 02:12:21.700]  i don't see how anyone leo would not oppose this well mankind unfortunately has many weaknesses
[02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:28.420]  they collect these weaknesses and make them the the way to exploit mankind you see everything
[02:12:28.420 --> 02:12:34.740]  that we are fed through the media everything that we are given to eat everything is exploited
[02:12:34.740 --> 02:12:40.740]  so that in the end we are like okay this is my little piece of the cake i might stay silent
[02:12:40.740 --> 02:12:46.020]  because otherwise i might get in trouble so this is going to become more and more in the next
[02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:51.620]  few years i mean in the end we will not be able to say anything that opposes the system back here
[02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:57.860]  and even have a feel against them not even saying it they will control even our thoughts and they'll
[02:12:57.860 --> 02:13:02.340]  have all these little factions set against each other that'll attack each other whenever the
[02:13:02.340 --> 02:13:06.580]  centralized referees want i've only got time to go to two more calls for you because we've got
[02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:11.060]  another special guest coming up maybe three or four let's try it real quick questions here
[02:13:11.060 --> 02:13:17.140]  thanks for calling jeff in canada jeff you're on the air with our guests go ahead good afternoon
[02:13:17.140 --> 02:13:24.420]  gentlemen god bless you both uh my question is uh if either of you have heard of a book by uh tom
[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:30.020]  horn and chris putnam called petrus romanus the final pope is here and it's about the prophecy of
[02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:37.220]  st malachi uh and the final pope uh they also did a follow-up book called exo vaticana petrus
[02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:43.380]  romanus project lucifer and the vatican's astonishing plan for the arrival of an alien savior
[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:50.020]  and so basically it documents uh that the uh they call it astral theology and uh
[02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:55.300]  sure the alone i don't believe we were ceded by aliens the movie prosthes a prometheus is basically
[02:13:55.300 --> 02:14:00.340]  like a creation story uh that the elite put out they even admit that uh and they even admit that
[02:14:00.340 --> 02:14:05.460]  the vatican is preparing with the vatican observatory for the arrival of aliens that's
[02:14:05.460 --> 02:14:11.060]  mainstream news excellent questions thank you jeff let's get uh mr sigami's take on it
[02:14:12.420 --> 02:14:17.700]  well the jazz rights are in complete control of the astronomical sector of the vatican
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:24.420]  the the holy seed has had the jazz rights in charge for a long time so they are the ones
[02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:30.740]  that in the last few years are starting to open up to this possibility because gradually they can
[02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:37.460]  make the whole thing also instrumental for their own new age creed you know jesus is not the only
[02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:42.100]  one in the universe in the end jesus will be okay jesus is big for us but it's not big for you
[02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:48.020]  instead of being the center of the universe is going to become marginalized and part of this
[02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:52.340]  new age creed that the jazz rights are promoting using also the alien agenda
[02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:59.540]  and and again we're not the one saying this this is mainstream news it's just so bizarre
[02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:04.580]  are they going to stage something do they know that the globalists are going to stage something
[02:15:05.380 --> 02:15:10.740]  what is the plan you see hollywood getting us ready for it it is bizarre let's go ahead now
[02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:17.140]  and talk to erin and canada you're on the air with leo zegami i yeah i was just saying uh
[02:15:17.140 --> 02:15:23.300]  are going to talk about the formation of the catholic church now in the beginning it was formed
[02:15:26.100 --> 02:15:32.340]  like seizure worship and you had to take ceasar's name before jesus's name so i think since the
[02:15:32.340 --> 02:15:36.900]  beginning of the catholic church it's always been a part of the illuminati it's always been part of
[02:15:41.380 --> 02:15:44.980]  yeah we're gonna have to move on then that creates the whole conspiracy theory that we were cutting
[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:49.460]  that line off that sounded like that was being done on purpose that was like chainsaws going off and
[02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:55.540]  yeah hard doors opening and weird uh anyways i mean let's talk about the founding of the catholic
[02:15:55.540 --> 02:16:01.700]  church um that's an interesting question is the founding of christianity the founding of christianity
[02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:08.900]  because we know that at one point an emperor constantine made this the state religion of the empire
[02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:16.980]  and and from there on really the vatican takes on from the roman empire as their heirs to all this
[02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:22.100]  power and knowledge so i guess that the more than the founding of catholicism which was
[02:16:22.100 --> 02:16:28.180]  talked first about the founding of christianity of course after people after the orthodox church
[02:16:28.180 --> 02:16:35.620]  ran off then protestatism was created but now in the end as you can see they have taken back the
[02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:41.460]  whole the whole christianity in their hands and i don't think there is one christian leader today
[02:16:41.460 --> 02:16:48.900]  in the world that opposes the pope even if it's from another denomination the ecumenicalism the
[02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:55.780]  world council of churches that the raga fellers set up has been successful and then now the very
[02:16:55.780 --> 02:17:01.140]  doctrine of the bible itself is being banned is being outlawed is being shredded let's go ahead
[02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:08.580]  and take one more phone call fabian and fema region five you're on the air fabian yes hello gentlemen
[02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:16.260]  i just wanted to add to the the staged stuff like the little girl who was able to
[02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:22.740]  break security and come over and see the pope and all that stuff something very similar happened
[02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:29.540]  last week i did send a news tip on monday but i don't know if you know my stuff went into the
[02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:38.500]  span or whatever but nbc news staged another similar event live on tv on the 16th where
[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:44.180]  we got richard engel out there in the midst of all the migrants trying to break through you know
[02:17:44.180 --> 02:17:53.700]  the the gates and the fences and just low and behold this pregnant refugee walks by and collapses
[02:17:53.700 --> 02:17:59.460]  right at his feet and low and behold the baby drowns so they stage it for the news cameras
[02:17:59.460 --> 02:18:04.180]  yeah i mean this is so this is totally transparent totally seconding but instead of
[02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:10.420]  outraging the public they love it they love being conned at least some people do uh or maybe it's
[02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:14.660]  going to blow up in their face uh thank you for the call fabian what do you think about a statement
[02:18:14.660 --> 02:18:24.340]  i think that everybody in america these days while the pope is visiting is showing the real
[02:18:24.340 --> 02:18:29.540]  self we have seen really things that are out of this world i mean these people to be close
[02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:34.020]  to the pope will do anything i mean like it's some kind of god and
[02:18:34.020 --> 02:18:44.820]  and we've been having some phone issues today obviously but we just lost zogami's phone can
[02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:47.700]  we go back to skype audio and then we have skype videos you can finish up
[02:18:53.380 --> 02:18:57.860]  all right well we will try to finish up with him and then come back with our guests on geo
[02:18:57.860 --> 02:19:04.260]  engineering uh leo can you hear me all right well we've lost him but that was an important
[02:19:04.260 --> 02:19:10.660]  interview uh that we just had with leo zogami you can find his book the last pope just by searching
[02:19:10.660 --> 02:19:15.700]  it and going to his publisher that we had on screen earlier now we're going to go to break
[02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:19.940]  we're getting them on 20 minutes late but we'll go five minutes in the next hour then we have a
[02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:25.620]  fourth hour of overdrive today hosted by anthony utiarty i'll tell you about that later it's going
[02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:36.500]  to be a hot hour but here's the headline earth is 20 darker say experts now this is from 2003
[02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:43.220]  and they claim it's jet trails that are doing it that's nasa i thought i'd show you that just to
[02:19:43.220 --> 02:19:50.660]  give you an idea of what even accidental geo engineering can do from their words and clearly
[02:19:50.660 --> 02:19:55.620]  california is having its weather manipulated this is what the age of weather weapons is all

[02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:46.500]  like weather warfare and climate engineering in other words weather control are accepted as basic
[02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:52.580]  fact climate engineering is the greatest single assault on the environment ever launched by humanity
[02:24:52.580 --> 02:24:57.940]  without question dane wigginton lead researcher for geoengineering watch is sounding the alarm
[02:24:57.940 --> 02:25:02.820]  it's a responsibility it's not an option it's an obligation look in the center between the main
[02:25:02.820 --> 02:25:08.740]  clones his group claims this grainy shaky video is part of a mountain of evidence they've uncovered
[02:25:08.740 --> 02:25:13.780]  means we have a secondary disbursement showing shadowy government forces are using planes to
[02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:18.980]  secretly spray fine particles of heavy metals like aluminum into the sky the tankers fight
[02:25:18.980 --> 02:25:23.620]  lower altitudes because they carry the larger payload the purpose they believe is to block
[02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:29.060]  some of the sun's direct rays from reaching the earth a desperate attempt to slow global warming
[02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:34.900]  the list of corroborating material we have is immense including lab tests that prove the same
[02:25:34.900 --> 02:25:40.340]  elements used names geoengineering patents aluminum barium and other heavy metals are
[02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:46.980]  raining down on us absolutely massive quantities if you're skeptical this won't help dane claims
[02:25:46.980 --> 02:25:51.940]  the spraying he says is happening off the coast of california comes with an incredibly severe
[02:25:51.940 --> 02:25:58.900]  side effect the heavy metal particles he says are blocking rainfall effectively steering our rain
[02:25:58.900 --> 02:26:05.060]  somewhere else leading to their shocking truth climate engineering they say is to blame for
[02:26:05.060 --> 02:26:10.740]  the harshest recorded drought in california history that cbs 13 that we're analyzing there
[02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:16.340]  dav widdington joins us right now his background is solar energy i've been involved in documentary
[02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:21.540]  films that he's been in is formerly employed by bechtel power core bechtel's been involved in
[02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:26.500]  weather engineering he worked for one of the first commercial solar electric facilities in the u.s
[02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:32.100]  he's an off-the-grid residence located on a 1,600 acre wildlife preserve in northern california
[02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:36.820]  wilderness one of the founding members of geoengineeringwatch.org and the staff writer for
[02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:42.740]  articles there geoengineeringwatch.org this is a short segment long segment coming up but the
[02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:48.180]  reason i wanted to get him on is cbs news sacramento and others have been picking it up going to city
[02:26:48.180 --> 02:26:54.820]  council members going to town halls with 200 300 400 people you know inside wearing suits and ties
[02:26:54.820 --> 02:27:00.260]  scientists talking about this so they show some college kids in a drum circle outside and go oh
[02:27:00.260 --> 02:27:05.460]  look they're cooks and they selectively don't show the fact that we have the patents we have the
[02:27:05.460 --> 02:27:11.220]  admissions we have secretary of defense cohen in army times 97 admitting it we have bill gates
[02:27:11.220 --> 02:27:15.620]  running a secret program for the government four billion five billion dollars a year uh we have
[02:27:15.620 --> 02:27:20.900]  the father of weather weapons admitting they were doing it back in the 70s we have the london
[02:27:20.900 --> 02:27:30.980]  guardian earth is 20 darker nasa says 2003 2014 that's now 30 darker you can simply type in to a
[02:27:30.980 --> 02:27:37.220]  search engine satellite photos of jet trails over north america and it shows the whole continent
[02:27:37.220 --> 02:27:43.140]  covered we know there's ice crystals we know those are natural but they persist now we have the
[02:27:43.140 --> 02:27:49.380]  patents where it's added to the jet fuel and dispersed and there's other special aircraft and
[02:27:50.340 --> 02:27:55.860]  clearly we've had weather folks on we've had meteorologists on who've looked at the water
[02:27:56.420 --> 02:28:03.220]  the the storms coming in that would normally dump water in california origan and and and
[02:28:03.220 --> 02:28:08.900]  seattle up in washington and it's being killed before it gets there it's being dumped into the
[02:28:08.900 --> 02:28:17.060]  ocean you put the salts in you put the ionizers in you put the nuclei in and it makes it come down
[02:28:17.060 --> 02:28:23.540]  early it's 101 so tell us what's coming up in the next 35 minutes or so sir good job getting a more
[02:28:23.540 --> 02:28:29.940]  more attention they're really upset that they can't spend this dane thank you for giving your
[02:28:29.940 --> 02:28:34.660]  your voice this issue is so often alex and all you've done for the the greater good and on this
[02:28:34.660 --> 02:28:38.740]  particular issue this is the noose around our neck and this is what so many people need to
[02:28:38.740 --> 02:28:42.980]  realize that whatever other challenges we face if we don't face this challenge nothing else
[02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:47.780]  will matter soon in regard to the california drought that is a one plus one equals two equation
[02:28:47.780 --> 02:28:53.220]  when we know they're aerosolizing off the us west coast too many condensation nuclei as you stated
[02:28:53.780 --> 02:28:58.900]  and they can not only reduce the rain before it arrives they can also migrate the rain directly
[02:28:58.900 --> 02:29:02.500]  over the top of us by introducing too many condensation nuclei alex and they're they're
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:07.540]  doing that in conjunction with the ridiculously resilient ridge this is a new meteorological term
[02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:11.380]  that refers to the high pressure that blocks all the rain completely that's the result of
[02:29:11.380 --> 02:29:14.660]  the ionosphere heater so they have several means of blocking the rain from the west but
[02:29:14.660 --> 02:29:18.900]  they're wreaking havoc all over the globe alex and as you know we're going to come back dubai is in
[02:29:18.900 --> 02:29:25.220]  the bbc with these uh microwaves making it rain they can also stop it from raining so this is

[02:29:59.380 --> 02:30:04.740]  kid daniels info wars dot com did you know that pope francis has strong ties to communism
[02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:09.220]  francis is a member of the jesuits who developed the so-called liberation theology which many
[02:30:09.220 --> 02:30:14.100]  have labeled christianized marxism the other reason why communism and socialism has persevered
[02:30:14.100 --> 02:30:18.340]  for so long in latin america and it's not a coincidence that cuba's current leader rile
[02:30:18.340 --> 02:30:23.780]  castro praised pope francis for his anti-catholic stance castro like francis was also brought up
[02:30:23.780 --> 02:30:29.300]  by the jesuits starting to make sense now why francis is constantly calling for carbon taxes
[02:30:29.300 --> 02:30:33.460]  and more government and also did you know the recent reconciliation between the us and cuba
[02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:38.740]  was spearheaded by pope francis to the benefit of castro vatican researcher leo zigami wrote an
[02:30:38.740 --> 02:30:43.780]  excellent article on info wars dot com entitled vatican flag to fly over the new world order
[02:30:43.780 --> 02:30:49.380]  which breaks it all down zigami wrote rock obama and rile castros mundialis left his agenda is
[02:30:49.380 --> 02:30:53.540]  guided and supervised by the first jesuit pope in history to help the cubans embrace the new

[02:33:13.460 --> 02:33:21.620]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones on the gcn radio
[02:33:21.620 --> 02:33:33.220]  network all right here's the simple synopsis anyone with a search engine can find library of
[02:33:33.220 --> 02:33:41.060]  congress united nations treaties the patents the films that have been made so many documentaries
[02:33:41.060 --> 02:33:46.420]  though act like it's a mystery that they're going to solve it's like the mystery does the
[02:33:46.420 --> 02:33:51.940]  washington dc capital exists let's find out and two hours later you find out yes it exists
[02:33:54.900 --> 02:34:00.020]  no there's no having to go prove the pacific ocean exists we know it's been discovered
[02:34:00.020 --> 02:34:07.620]  we've seen it it's been documented for thousands of years or the atlantic or the indian ocean
[02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:14.660]  but the establishment treats us like pigmes to be around the middle of africa or something
[02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:21.060]  and have never seen civilization and they go there's no kim trailing there's no weather
[02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:26.100]  modification going on when it was declassified a decade ago i had been living since the father
[02:34:26.100 --> 02:34:32.100]  weapons on weather weapons on they could take a clear sky in vietnam and rain 10 feet of water
[02:34:32.100 --> 02:34:37.940]  anytime they wanted on the hoshi min trail with less than seven aircraft and that was with primitive
[02:34:37.940 --> 02:34:42.820]  technology they could create hurricanes they could kill hurricanes they could strengthen them they
[02:34:42.820 --> 02:34:50.740]  could weaken them they could steer them they could control them he came on my show on radio and tv and
[02:34:50.740 --> 02:34:57.300]  then got a visit by homeland security whenever talk to me again because it got declassified i got his
[02:34:57.300 --> 02:35:04.180]  name i got him on fox news picked it up after i had him on i mean they got upset stanford research
[02:35:04.180 --> 02:35:11.620]  institute 1967 certified with the naval weapons laboratory that they could create and control
[02:35:11.620 --> 02:35:19.540]  hurricanes with just aerosol spray but with giant solar panel arrays and magnetic arrays and microwave
[02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:26.340]  arrays they could completely control it project to turn the desert green trials in katar and
[02:35:26.340 --> 02:35:32.580]  again they're using microwave systems to do that as well but then when we talk about hey there's a
[02:35:32.580 --> 02:35:37.860]  giant department of energy program and all the admissions under scientific terms it's never
[02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:42.740]  called chem trail you never find a fema camp saying where's the fema camp document it's not called a
[02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:46.980]  fema camp it's called an emergency center under the establishment act it's called a civilian
[02:35:46.980 --> 02:35:52.260]  inmate labor camp it's called a resettlement program army war college then you can read all
[02:35:52.260 --> 02:35:56.820]  about it now they're going to break up families put us in different fema camps it's an army dot mill
[02:35:56.820 --> 02:36:01.460]  all the time folks call in or try to show up at the office or send me letters going i didn't believe it
[02:36:01.460 --> 02:36:06.660]  i looked it up army dot mill they're building the camps i can't believe it i can't believe it but see
[02:36:06.660 --> 02:36:17.380]  it's called another name not a fema camp so dav widdington who heads up geoengineeringwatch.org again
[02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:24.020]  has really been getting folks for years concerned about this now that the drought is driving people
[02:36:24.020 --> 02:36:28.340]  out the question is what is geoengineering for folks that don't know what is the evidence we
[02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:33.700]  should walk through it if you're a tv viewer you can see as we go along here just what we threw
[02:36:33.700 --> 02:36:46.820]  together today for this interview that walks through exactly what's happening and the history
[02:36:46.820 --> 02:36:52.420]  of this situation we have the weather and climate modification manual that shows the aircraft
[02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:57.620]  nozzle satellite images and how to control the weather we have the tree die off from the aluminum
[02:36:57.620 --> 02:37:05.300]  dioxide uh we have the uh nasa satellite photos making the earth darker now we have the geoengineering
[02:37:05.300 --> 02:37:11.460]  patents we have it all that's what's crazy is that it's so admitted so sir you've got the floor
[02:37:12.020 --> 02:37:17.700]  break it down for us exactly what we're facing and why would they want to kill the red basket of
[02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:25.860]  america everything you stated alex is spot on in regard to climate engineering which is weather
[02:37:25.860 --> 02:37:31.220]  warfare there's no delineation between the two weather warfare amounts to biological warfare
[02:37:31.220 --> 02:37:36.340]  because all of us on the ground have to breathe and hail and absorb what's being sprayed above us
[02:37:36.900 --> 02:37:42.500]  so in regards to the california drought again the equation is simple when you aerosolize on
[02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:48.020]  this scale you radically disrupt the hydrological cycle and i would challenge any of your listeners
[02:37:48.020 --> 02:37:52.980]  or encourage your listeners to look at disseminations i did two years ago for example engineered
[02:37:52.980 --> 02:37:58.260]  drought catastrophe target california and ask yourself if that data from two years ago wasn't
[02:37:58.260 --> 02:38:03.460]  exactly on target now the reason it's on target is because is they as they continue these programs it
[02:38:03.460 --> 02:38:09.700]  couldn't not happen that same data was presented to lieutenant governor gabin newson lieutenant
[02:38:09.700 --> 02:38:14.500]  governor of california at the state capital by myself nearly two years ago there's no question
[02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:18.500]  they know what's going on there's no question lieutenant governor knows people in the epa
[02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:23.540]  know i've had high level epa meetings i've been in barba boxer's office spoke in front of the
[02:38:23.540 --> 02:38:28.340]  california energy commission who knows they're losing 20 of the state's rain 20 to 40 from
[02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:34.020]  quote particulates of unknown origin this is the biggest elephant in the room alex by far and the
[02:38:34.020 --> 02:38:38.980]  planetary disruption it's causing is far beyond what most people imagine to be possible but as
[02:38:38.980 --> 02:38:44.100]  you correctly outlined this weather warfare and that's exactly what it is it's not for the common
[02:38:44.100 --> 02:38:48.660]  good there is no benevolence in the climate engineering programs it's weather warfare which
[02:38:48.660 --> 02:38:53.380]  amounts to biological warfare again because of the contamination and i would encourage people to
[02:38:53.380 --> 02:38:57.380]  simply look at the amount of data we have the photographs of the nozzles as you just showed
[02:38:57.380 --> 02:39:01.380]  when people argue is this or isn't it going on we have the historical records as you correctly
[02:39:01.380 --> 02:39:06.100]  outlaid we have photographs of the retrofit nozzles mounted even on commercial planes we have
[02:39:06.100 --> 02:39:11.540]  photographs of these tankers spraying shutting on and off at altitude military tankers kc 10s kc
[02:39:11.540 --> 02:39:21.300]  135s c 17s there's no argument that this going on alex there certainly isn't and dain wiggington
[02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:29.300]  is our guest today at geoengineeringwatch.org please continue laying out from your deep research
[02:39:30.500 --> 02:39:34.900]  what the end game of this is because they admit the geoengineering is going on it's going on a
[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:41.140]  planetary scale they can even do lethal testing under us code title 50 shepherd 32 if it's quote
[02:39:41.140 --> 02:39:46.660]  for research that's why they never say it's it's an it's it's now an operational phase it's always
[02:39:46.660 --> 02:39:54.900]  in research phase but it's so huge i remember they did naval testing 18 years ago in south texas
[02:39:54.900 --> 02:40:01.140]  and they had 30 foot floods in in creeks and things it killed hundreds of people and there was a
[02:40:01.140 --> 02:40:06.740]  footnote in the associated press that the navy was doing geoengineering testing in that area but
[02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:13.860]  they weren't involved in the floods so we just see these little type of things pop up the cataclysms
[02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:20.180]  they have already caused the human health impact already caused could never be calculated ultimately
[02:40:20.180 --> 02:40:24.740]  what these programs are about is power and control even if we trace them back to their
[02:40:25.300 --> 02:40:31.620]  inception their their first major deployments in the late 40s that we are we see in government
[02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:36.820]  documents with fact one of which i found on the nasa archives 80 pages long from 1966 this is on
[02:40:36.820 --> 02:40:41.860]  geoengineering watch dot org presidential document outlining the scope and scale of these programs
[02:40:41.860 --> 02:40:48.020]  even as of that time 10 major universities involved 12 federal agencies involved and yet we have
[02:40:48.020 --> 02:40:55.380]  cbs it was banned by a un treaty that we signed in 1978 correct after project pop i was so successful
[02:40:55.380 --> 02:41:00.980]  in vietnam over the ho Chi Minh trail but yet there were loopholes in that banning that did
[02:41:00.980 --> 02:41:05.060]  not prohibit countries from experimenting over their own populations right nobody's paying
[02:41:05.060 --> 02:41:10.980]  attention to the un mandates anyway so the bottom line and notice folks we're finishing
[02:41:10.980 --> 02:41:14.660]  each other's sentences and if you're a radio listener we're putting documents on screen
[02:41:14.660 --> 02:41:19.940]  we'll go to the second group we're not making this up this is in public view how frustrating is it
[02:41:19.940 --> 02:41:26.340]  for you dain to spend your life fighting this to see your beautiful you know retreat dying
[02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:30.820]  to see the trees dying all over california to see the animals dying to have the soil
[02:41:30.820 --> 02:41:35.780]  test with the aluminum dioxide off the chart the forestry service i know talk to you others
[02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:41.140]  admits yeah something's happening i mean this is crazy and then they just sit there and make fun
[02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:47.860]  of it what's like living in again groundhog day where you wake up every day hoping there's some
[02:41:47.860 --> 02:41:54.020]  sort of a of a consciousness around you that starts to stir and yet until now we have the
[02:41:54.020 --> 02:41:59.220]  entire science community governmental agencies all towing the line for the power structure
[02:41:59.220 --> 02:42:03.140]  all doubling down on the lie because they're so committed to the lie that this isn't going on
[02:42:03.140 --> 02:42:06.980]  they're so committed to the lie that these are quote condensation trails when i think you showed
[02:42:06.980 --> 02:42:12.580]  on the screen earlier the high bypass turbofan jet engine encourage people to look at the tutorial
[02:42:12.580 --> 02:42:17.220]  on that we have at the homepage of geoengineering watch this engine is mounted on all commercial
[02:42:17.220 --> 02:42:24.420]  aircraft all military tankers it's a jet powered fan by design it is nearly incapable of producing
[02:42:24.420 --> 02:42:29.780]  any condensation trail except in the most extreme circumstances because 85 of the air that passes
[02:42:29.780 --> 02:42:35.860]  through that engine is non-combusted the the contrail lies is the greatest lie ever perpetrated
[02:42:35.860 --> 02:42:40.900]  on the american population they've been planning for these programs to continue for a very long
[02:42:40.900 --> 02:42:45.380]  time alex but the the cataclysms they're housing around the globe now can't be hidden much longer
[02:42:45.380 --> 02:42:49.940]  but then in children's textbooks i showed one a few years ago that's used nationwide it said
[02:42:49.940 --> 02:42:55.620]  when you see those trails that's the planes putting out a sunscreen to save us from global warming
[02:42:55.620 --> 02:43:02.340]  and to fix the ozone layer so and in kids cartoons they admit it so so the young ones will accept it
[02:43:02.340 --> 02:43:07.220]  and they tell us nothing's happening it's just crazy the lie is beginning to break down though
[02:43:07.220 --> 02:43:12.740]  in regard to the ozone layer and that's an important point you brought up the paradox here is that by
[02:43:12.740 --> 02:43:16.820]  putting particulates in the atmosphere that actually destroys the ozone layer doesn't matter
[02:43:16.820 --> 02:43:21.140]  whether those particulates are from a volcano or from the back of a jet aircraft and we're talking
[02:43:21.140 --> 02:43:25.700]  about the quantities we're speaking about here and stated by internationally recognized geoengineer
[02:43:25.700 --> 02:43:31.220]  david keith the goal to put 20 million tons of aluminum nano particulates into the atmosphere
[02:43:31.220 --> 02:43:36.820]  annually and we have massive red flags alex going up proving the contamination we have said was there
[02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:42.420]  for a decade now proving with our lab test now we have peer-reviewed studies for example in regard
[02:43:42.420 --> 02:43:47.300]  to the b collapse colony collapse disorder that we have stated again and again was not just the
[02:43:47.300 --> 02:43:52.260]  farm chemicals there's a heavy metal contamination now we have peer-reviewed study proving that
[02:43:52.260 --> 02:43:57.540]  bees are dying from symptoms that resemble dementia and Alzheimer's the level of aluminum and we have
[02:43:57.540 --> 02:44:02.100]  Reuters saying that you and others have said that first and and just to just interrupt and interject
[02:44:02.100 --> 02:44:07.540]  that you're so right here you bet i saw another big studies a few years ago that lung cancer in women
[02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:14.420]  even though smoking is way down is up seven fold i personally and beyond scared now i know
[02:44:16.100 --> 02:44:22.580]  six different young women below the ages of 40 that never smoked who are all dying of lung cancer
[02:44:22.580 --> 02:44:27.460]  right now so whatever they're spraying is hitting women even more and you see the neurological
[02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:32.980]  disorders are off the charts the animals are dying the trees are dying i mean this is madness
[02:44:32.980 --> 02:44:41.940]  this is just like they put fluoride in the water which they now basically admit was a neurotoxin
[02:44:41.940 --> 02:44:47.380]  and scientists say take it out harvard says take it out they've quadrupled down with something even
[02:44:47.380 --> 02:44:53.540]  bigger now let's look at in a very brief summary the negative effects of climate engineering total
[02:44:53.540 --> 02:44:59.220]  disruption of a global hydrological cycle the rain cycle total shredding of the ozone layer total
[02:44:59.220 --> 02:45:04.500]  contamination of the entire surface of the planet every breath we take is laden with these materials
[02:45:04.500 --> 02:45:08.660]  and in regard to for example let's take the forest fires that are happening in california now
[02:45:08.660 --> 02:45:13.380]  what direct impacts do we know climate engineering is having on those fires their blanket spraying off
[02:45:13.380 --> 02:45:18.660]  the u.s west coast as you correctly said in the beginning of the show that disrupts breaks up the
[02:45:18.660 --> 02:45:23.860]  storm track whatever moisture does come across the state they aerosolize it migrated over the top
[02:45:23.860 --> 02:45:28.660]  so climate engineering again has cut the rain cycle off which is droughting out those trees
[02:45:28.660 --> 02:45:33.460]  it's bio available heavy metals we know the effect of those metals on the root systems we have
[02:45:33.460 --> 02:45:38.580]  peer reviewed study to prove that causes the trees to stop nutrient uptake we have a massively
[02:45:38.580 --> 02:45:44.580]  intense uv we're getting uvb readings with our own meters measured at about a thousand percent higher
[02:45:44.580 --> 02:45:51.300]  than we're being told so we have foliage scorching we have the trees dying from the top down and
[02:45:51.300 --> 02:45:57.060]  importantly these metals are an incendiary dust they coat the forest foliage with an incendiary
[02:45:57.060 --> 02:46:00.740]  dust so you have all the ingredients necessary including more lightning by the way because
[02:46:00.740 --> 02:46:05.460]  we have a more conductive atmosphere so we have more lightning less rain incendiary dust on the
[02:46:05.460 --> 02:46:09.860]  trees forests that are dying all the ingredients necessary for this type of fire cat and then
[02:46:09.860 --> 02:46:16.020]  we have all the patents going back in the 70s 80s and 90s about adding these very chemicals to jet
[02:46:16.020 --> 02:46:21.460]  fuel to be aerosolized by the jet engines and delivered then we have separate spray planes
[02:46:21.460 --> 02:46:26.980]  that have been photographed then we have all these and the guy i've got him here in the stack what
[02:46:26.980 --> 02:46:33.460]  back in 92 wins a Nobel prize for a plan to geo engineer exactly like this and then suddenly
[02:46:33.460 --> 02:46:39.540]  the program launches two years later all over the world i mean it's just it's just all hiding in plain
[02:46:39.540 --> 02:46:47.700]  view it couldn't be any more obvious for anyone that's it's willing to wipe their their perceptions
[02:46:47.700 --> 02:46:52.020]  clean and look with a clear lens i mean what we have in the sky is you again correctly cited
[02:46:52.020 --> 02:46:56.180]  global dimming that's a term people should look up and understand and that is the express goal
[02:46:56.180 --> 02:47:01.140]  of solar radiation management that's a science term for what's happening above our skies express
[02:47:01.140 --> 02:47:06.580]  goal is to block the sun and we have exactly that happening proven with peer-reviewed science data
[02:47:06.580 --> 02:47:10.420]  all the materials using the patents are showing up on the ground in lethal quantities and you notice
[02:47:10.420 --> 02:47:16.500]  almost every month i'll hear on radio tv or print scientists want a global dim by spraying
[02:47:16.500 --> 02:47:21.300]  particulate into the air released by airplanes so they're just getting you ready like scientists
[02:47:21.300 --> 02:47:25.300]  might want a world government someday when they're already setting it up they're just purely
[02:47:25.300 --> 02:47:30.740]  conditioning us i guess to go public and say yeah we spray aluminum dioxide barium salts
[02:47:30.740 --> 02:47:36.500]  and radioactive isotopes on you and your family this is insane asylum level and then we were just
[02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:42.820]  showing london guardian articles admitting geo engineering dimming programs already going on
[02:47:42.820 --> 02:47:48.100]  that that's what's crazy they admit they're doing it with one hand but deny they are with the other
[02:47:48.980 --> 02:47:52.420]  people are waking up quickly though in their attempt to sell this to the public as a quote
[02:47:52.420 --> 02:47:58.260]  unquote climate change mitigation which we have more than enough data to know now conclusively
[02:47:58.260 --> 02:48:04.980]  that climate engineering is fueling an already bad climate situation you obviously trap more
[02:48:04.980 --> 02:48:09.460]  heat than you deflect with the particulates we have nasa confirming that for us so this this
[02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:13.140]  can't be sold as a climate mitigation in any sense right they claim they're stopping global
[02:48:13.140 --> 02:48:18.180]  warming but then it makes us hotter correct listen so much of it's classified the programs as you
[02:48:18.180 --> 02:48:23.060]  said it are admitted but the details are classified from your deep research and talking to top scientists
[02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:27.700]  what do you think they're really trying to do is it a plan to come out with gmo seeds that only
[02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:32.500]  grow uh you know that monsanto has that can grow in aluminum we know they have a whole line of those
[02:48:32.500 --> 02:48:38.340]  or is it a but is it population reduction uh is it uh geoengineered or wrecked the climate did they
[02:48:38.340 --> 02:48:42.980]  blow holes in the atmosphere and do something we didn't know about with the nukes uh i mean what is
[02:48:42.980 --> 02:48:49.300]  it or are they just playing god is it just about controlling the weather you've just given a very
[02:48:49.300 --> 02:48:54.900]  accurate summary if we answer your question with all the above absolutely all the above and a
[02:48:54.900 --> 02:48:59.700]  comparison that matches very closely with the mentality behind climate engineering alex you
[02:48:59.700 --> 02:49:04.500]  know what corrects it was in the Gulf of Mexico the chemical so if we if we use that as an example
[02:49:04.500 --> 02:49:09.540]  did corrects it correct anything no a chemical ban throughout the globe according to our
[02:49:09.540 --> 02:49:15.140]  environmental impact reports it made the situation 52 times more toxic but they used it anyway why
[02:49:15.140 --> 02:49:20.260]  to hide the damage already done and some of the same mentality applies with climate engineering
[02:49:20.260 --> 02:49:24.420]  in the course of their exercising this weather warfare which is all at a monster you can't call
[02:49:24.420 --> 02:49:29.700]  it anything else they continue doubling down on these programs in an attempt to try to
[02:49:29.700 --> 02:49:35.700]  in some ways hide like corrects it the damage already done by doing even more damage and this
[02:49:35.700 --> 02:49:39.780]  is the mentality we have they're too invested in this to turn back alex well we've got to have
[02:49:39.780 --> 02:49:43.060]  you up more often we're going to break and come back in the next two segments and have you cover
[02:49:43.060 --> 02:49:46.820]  all the different angles you need to get to but uh we're going to go over some of the geoengineering
[02:49:46.820 --> 02:49:52.820]  patents geoengineering uh reports we've been showing tv viewers this uh radio listeners
[02:49:52.820 --> 02:50:00.020]  can go to info wars.com forward slash show and find the free feed um and by tomorrow we'll have
[02:50:00.020 --> 02:50:04.740]  this posted on youtube people need to make this go viral we're also posted to facebook i mean i've
[02:50:04.740 --> 02:50:10.740]  got children and what scares me is you know they're doing this now worldwide just a decade ago my
[02:50:10.740 --> 02:50:16.020]  wife and i at the time privately talked about moving to the southern hemisphere to get away from
[02:50:16.020 --> 02:50:20.980]  increased radiation levels and the geoengineering but according to my research you correct me if
[02:50:20.980 --> 02:50:26.180]  i'm wrong they're now firing it up in the southern hemisphere as well is that correct you are exactly
[02:50:26.180 --> 02:50:32.740]  correct so i mean i'm going to get mad when my kids are 20 if they get lung cancer i mean i'm
[02:50:32.740 --> 02:50:36.740]  really getting pissed at these politicians man i mean they need to know that we're here to make
[02:50:36.740 --> 02:50:41.460]  sure they understand that we're gonna you know they're gonna pay for what they've done i mean
[02:50:41.460 --> 02:50:47.220]  i'm getting tired of being assaulted every day by this stuff and i just feel like everybody i know
[02:50:47.220 --> 02:50:51.860]  has got a girlfriend or a wife dying of lung cancer i mean you know i don't mean to be ranting
[02:50:51.860 --> 02:50:56.500]  i'm just getting tired of it man i am getting tired of it and the baby parts get the sold and

[02:52:02.180 --> 02:52:06.660]  and ceo of id stronghold by now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from
[02:52:06.660 --> 02:52:10.980]  electronic pickpocketing 10 years ago i created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes
[02:52:10.980 --> 02:52:14.980]  after government officials started talking about issuing a national id card with a built-in
[02:52:14.980 --> 02:52:20.260]  radio chip called rfid i felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy
[02:52:20.900 --> 02:52:26.100]  soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even
[02:52:26.100 --> 02:52:31.380]  transit passes would all soon incorporate rfid it was then i formed id stronghold to share my
[02:52:31.380 --> 02:52:36.020]  inventions and blocking rfid signals with the world there are a lot of misconceptions out there
[02:52:36.020 --> 02:52:41.860]  today about rfid i encourage everyone to get informed and get protected please go to id stronghold

[02:52:56.660 --> 02:53:02.420]  dot com today most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega threes is a
[02:53:02.420 --> 02:53:07.220]  good idea but did you know that about 60 percent of americans are actually deficient in omega threes
[02:53:07.220 --> 02:53:12.100]  did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25 percent omega threes and the remaining
[02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:17.460]  75 percent is undesirable fish fat heck did you know that more than 90 percent of fish oil supplements
[02:53:17.460 --> 02:53:22.740]  sold in the usa are not even made here if you want to boost your omega threes using the finest american

[02:54:09.540 --> 02:54:16.100]  key stuff he's going to be covering anthony will get into the breakdown of the decline of america
[02:54:16.100 --> 02:54:21.140]  and what experts see coming down the pipeline for most americans with calla pillar contracting
[02:54:21.140 --> 02:54:26.100]  and other stock issues he's also going to talk uh to you taking your calls and cover the latest
[02:54:26.100 --> 02:54:32.260]  health news uh that wasn't able to get to today including a new type of disease outbreak that
[02:54:32.260 --> 02:54:38.580]  could affect millions that is coming up in the fourth hour with anthony gucciardi i've got the
[02:54:38.580 --> 02:54:44.100]  crew in there just googling geoengineering at colleges and they've got one here talking about
[02:54:44.100 --> 02:54:50.180]  geoengineer to stop co2 spray particulate into the atmosphere and so that's how they're getting
[02:54:50.180 --> 02:54:56.420]  them all ready to accept it that you're the savers of the earth by doing this in its total
[02:54:56.420 --> 02:55:01.860]  complete madness that's part of a larger program briefly uh please continue to spread the word
[02:55:01.860 --> 02:55:05.940]  about the broadcast that's how we get the word out it's how we reach new people i want to thank all
[02:55:05.940 --> 02:55:11.460]  of you that have been doing that become a subscriber for 595 a month for the nightly news and help

[02:56:02.580 --> 02:56:07.700]  well our guest again has been going to the state house the energy commissions he really is a great
[02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:12.820]  leader just with his straight deadpan layout of the info with scientists and others there are a
[02:56:12.820 --> 02:56:18.500]  lot of scientists and meteorologists joining the ranks exposing geoengineering as the system
[02:56:18.500 --> 02:56:23.940]  tries to go public with it out of one side of its mouth but denies it out of the other geoengineering
[02:56:23.940 --> 02:56:29.940]  watch.org uh dane wiggington please continue to break down exactly what we're facing and
[02:56:29.940 --> 02:56:36.580]  how we reverse it you say people are really starting to wake up they are again the statement you just
[02:56:36.580 --> 02:56:41.620]  made trying to abdicate out of one side and denying out of the other that's exactly what we have
[02:56:41.620 --> 02:56:48.820]  happening people ask me why this issue why I'm focused so completely on this issue as you alluded
[02:56:48.820 --> 02:56:54.100]  to before the break as well Alex if we can't think clearly we are all absorbing these particulates
[02:56:54.100 --> 02:57:00.340]  the neurological effect to the to the human brain is well documented if we can't think clearly what
[02:57:00.340 --> 02:57:05.620]  other challenges will we face we have statistics from MIT for example recent statistics that state
[02:57:05.620 --> 02:57:12.740]  MIT is a major research center in the globe that within 10 years one out of two children will have
[02:57:12.740 --> 02:57:18.580]  autism one out of two we have Alzheimer's dementia now one in three seniors the IQ has is dropping
[02:57:18.580 --> 02:57:24.020]  10 points every 10 years yes I mean that's not education we're getting dumb we're getting hit
[02:57:24.660 --> 02:57:30.020]  yes you're exactly right so again whether we're talking about Fukushima which is a huge global
[02:57:30.020 --> 02:57:35.220]  threat or a long list of other threats we face if we can't think clearly what threats can we
[02:57:35.220 --> 02:57:40.660]  possibly face a short of nuclear cataclysm the greatest and most immediate threat we face that's
[02:57:40.660 --> 02:57:46.020]  right here right now is global climate engineering is contaminating every breath we take what other
[02:57:46.740 --> 02:57:52.980]  larger priority could be possibly have than that amazing we're going to go to break and I'm going
[02:57:52.980 --> 02:57:57.140]  to give you the full five minutes on the side to talk about solutions what we can do how we can get
[02:57:57.140 --> 02:58:01.940]  involved what you think the most well briefly the minute we have what are the most hard hit areas
[02:58:01.940 --> 02:58:06.500]  of the world from your research well as you correctly stated the southern hemisphere has been
[02:58:06.500 --> 02:58:12.500]  hitting now hit now also but when we look at neurological disorder escalation the greatest
[02:58:12.500 --> 02:58:17.780]  escalation on the planet is the united states of america statistical fact from recent study so we
[02:58:17.780 --> 02:58:21.460]  are being hit harder than anywhere else in the planet overall yeah the globalists couldn't deal
[02:58:21.460 --> 02:58:26.500]  with american spirit and their world government so we're being bug poisoned uh and and it's just
[02:58:26.500 --> 02:58:30.580]  and I hope all the trendies and the bureaucrats and the geoengineers think it's funny this is
[02:58:30.580 --> 02:58:35.860]  going to be you your wife your kids you know that they're going to be dying it's just it's eugenics
[02:58:35.860 --> 02:58:40.740]  it's eugenics you'll be back fourth hour info wars dot com board slash show thank you for the word

[02:59:31.620 --> 02:59:35.380]  working doing good you're still damaging your brain ultimately we've all been dumbed down to
[02:59:35.380 --> 02:59:39.540]  some degree it doesn't have stimulants it doesn't have garbage in it it has natural things that do
[02:59:39.540 --> 02:59:45.220]  it clean you will find a brain force and other game changing products at info wars life dot com
[02:59:45.220 --> 02:59:54.340]  or call 888-253-3139 you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:01.940 --> 03:00:08.500]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[03:00:08.500 --> 03:00:14.100]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network hi this is the final segment i'm hawn shelling
[03:00:14.100 --> 03:00:19.220]  quarterbacking an anthony gets you already comes in leon macadoo will pop in as well as darin mcbrane
[03:00:19.220 --> 03:00:26.100]  to be a jam packed fourth hour we're joined right now by geoengineering watch dot org coordinator
[03:00:26.100 --> 03:00:31.620]  and one of the founders uh dav wiggington and uh in closing sir you've got the floor to
[03:00:31.620 --> 03:00:35.460]  transmit more information to the people about one of the most important issues of the world
[03:00:35.460 --> 03:00:41.700]  another super secret manhattan type project now so advanced it's hiding in plain view
[03:00:41.700 --> 03:00:46.980]  and beginning to come out of the closet alex people ask of course the obvious questions
[03:00:46.980 --> 03:00:51.300]  how do we stop this we stop this by reaching critical mass of awareness which uh your your
[03:00:51.300 --> 03:00:56.500]  voice in this helps immensely and as we do that we start to make contacts that we didn't have before
[03:00:56.500 --> 03:01:00.260]  we now have an attorney's team five u.s attorneys to canadian that are working on this issue i
[03:01:00.260 --> 03:01:06.820]  coordinate directly with them we have now nine uh about nine ten weeks ago i had an air force
[03:01:06.820 --> 03:01:12.580]  retired air force general call me out of the blue i communicate with him now regularly he is working
[03:01:12.580 --> 03:01:17.540]  within his ranks he's working within people at dc who did not know this was going on as he did not
[03:01:17.540 --> 03:01:22.660]  know because it's completely compartmentalized but as we start these spot fires of awareness all over
[03:01:22.660 --> 03:01:28.820]  in every arena and we reach critical mass there'll be a shockwave around the globe and our site i hope
[03:01:28.820 --> 03:01:34.500]  is a a resource for that we have a youtube channel we have a free app uh there's no other
[03:01:34.500 --> 03:01:38.180]  contamination on our side as far as politics or anything else we're simply focused on this
[03:01:38.180 --> 03:01:43.140]  particular issue but if people can use that for a resource introduce credible data to others
[03:01:43.140 --> 03:01:47.700]  instead of just pointing at the sky and ranting that's a much larger help and alex we like to
[03:01:48.340 --> 03:01:53.940]  when people appeal to elected officials agency officials those that are helping to tow this lie
[03:01:53.940 --> 03:01:58.820]  helping to to hide it if you will in plain sight as you stated because they're trying to protect
[03:01:58.820 --> 03:02:04.020]  their paychecks and pension appeal to these people appeal to their their sense of responsibility to
[03:02:04.020 --> 03:02:08.740]  their own children to come out of the shadows and start telling the truth because no amount of money
[03:02:08.740 --> 03:02:13.220]  is worth having a brain damage son or daughter no no exactly right and and what's important for
[03:02:13.220 --> 03:02:17.220]  people to understand is the contamination that we face and the damage done by climate engineering
[03:02:17.220 --> 03:02:24.820]  is extremely non-linear it escalates rapidly as you reach the the end of the contamination cycle
[03:02:24.820 --> 03:02:30.020]  if you will so break down with planetary systems life support systems and our own health starts to
[03:02:30.020 --> 03:02:34.100]  ensue very rapidly as these saturations build up and i was about to say i've looked at the
[03:02:34.100 --> 03:02:39.060]  saturations in the soil it's on record even mainline scientists say they don't know why it's going up
[03:02:39.060 --> 03:02:43.300]  it could kill the planet it's like the people running things are evil aliens that want to kill
[03:02:43.300 --> 03:02:47.940]  the planet i'm not saying that's what they are but imagine when this all finally comes out if
[03:02:47.940 --> 03:02:52.340]  we're successful and i believe we will be it's going to be a hundred times bigger than nurenberg
[03:02:52.340 --> 03:02:57.700]  but there was a giant scientific eugenics conspiracy playing god doing all this you're
[03:02:57.700 --> 03:03:02.820]  exactly right and i know a lot of these academicians usda scientists that are still in the field
[03:03:02.820 --> 03:03:07.620]  still employed by the government and their unfortunate attitude is that they're they're
[03:03:07.620 --> 03:03:12.180]  trying to protect their paychecks and pensions none of which will matter very very soon we need
[03:03:12.180 --> 03:03:15.300]  to reach out to these people we need to reach out to our military brothers and sisters so
[03:03:15.300 --> 03:03:19.460]  that they know exactly what they're participating in if they don't participate these programs can't
[03:03:19.460 --> 03:03:25.220]  happen in regard to how much metal has fallen on us to put this in perspective alex soil ph changes
[03:03:25.220 --> 03:03:31.140]  in northern california we've seen a change of 10 to 12 times toward alkaline in the last decade
[03:03:31.140 --> 03:03:35.780]  that takes a mountain of metal to make that kind of change we've also during the same period seen
[03:03:35.780 --> 03:03:41.540]  to a 90 percent decline 90 percent in aquatic and terrestrial insects from the exposure to this
[03:03:41.540 --> 03:03:48.100]  metal the intense uv it's a virtual crash if the bugs go we go and that's that's how dire our situation
[03:03:48.100 --> 03:03:54.820]  is right here right now good god it's total collapse of the ecosystem they're going to use
[03:03:54.820 --> 03:03:59.620]  that to bring in a world government an eco-terrinary to fix the planet while they're the ones wrecking
[03:03:59.620 --> 03:04:04.900]  it and i guess they probably got what they believe are reversal systems once they've gotten rid of us
[03:04:04.900 --> 03:04:11.460]  but this is just insane it is insane but we encourage again we need everybody to help us
[03:04:11.460 --> 03:04:15.460]  to sound the alarm and if we could if we could simply reach critical mass where the population
[03:04:15.460 --> 03:04:20.020]  around the globe or military personnel understand what they're participating when that's our best
[03:04:20.020 --> 03:04:25.140]  bet for for bringing these programs to a halt and time is not on our side we're losing two
[03:04:25.140 --> 03:04:31.060]  to three hundred species of plant and animal and insect a day right now 200 a day that's 15 000
[03:04:31.060 --> 03:04:36.420]  times the background extinction rate so the bottom line is again every day matters in this battle
[03:04:36.420 --> 03:04:40.500]  it does i want to get you back up in the very near future to really lay out even more of your
[03:04:40.500 --> 03:04:46.260]  amazing evidence geoengineering watch dot org uh dave wiggings and thank you so much we salute
[03:04:46.260 --> 03:04:53.700]  you sir thank you alex anthony good shiardi is coming up with a roaring full fourth hour you
[03:04:53.700 --> 03:05:02.260]  do not want to miss this information stay with us a new global news fact-checking project was
[03:05:02.260 --> 03:05:08.820]  announced yesterday and it will be funded by two organizations with close ties to the obama white
[03:05:08.820 --> 03:05:15.460]  house the project which says it will be focused on holding public officials accountable is funded
[03:05:15.460 --> 03:05:21.060]  by grants from the omidiair network and the national endowment for democracy the omidiair
[03:05:21.060 --> 03:05:27.300]  network is headed up by ebay founder pierre omidiair visitor logs revealed that omidiair has visited
[03:05:27.300 --> 03:05:35.060]  the white house a half a dozen times since 2009 the national endowment for democracy nad is infamously
[03:05:35.060 --> 03:05:41.700]  known for their role in uprisings attempted coups and acts of regime change so it's operation
[03:05:41.700 --> 03:05:47.780]  mockingbird all over again as these connections clearly illustrate how the white house funded
[03:05:47.780 --> 03:05:55.300]  news fact checking project will undoubtedly be yet another exercise in spin and manipulation

[03:07:05.940 --> 03:07:10.980]  actually sold by prescription but when we look at a product like survival shield nasa niadine x2
[03:07:10.980 --> 03:07:15.140]  it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years the federal
[03:07:15.140 --> 03:07:20.580]  government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form of it be added to table
[03:07:20.580 --> 03:07:25.460]  salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing i
[03:07:25.460 --> 03:07:30.180]  want to challenge the listeners who've not tried x2 for yourselves what do you have to lose you

[03:07:38.980 --> 03:07:43.380]  reason to try x2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock we ordered the biggest shipment ever

[03:07:53.860 --> 03:08:06.180]  dot com or by calling 888-253-3139 ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio
[03:08:06.180 --> 03:08:15.140]  network welcome back to the fourth overdrive hour of the alex jones show i'm your host anthony
[03:08:15.140 --> 03:08:21.940]  gucciardi alex jones just left us with a lot of news left to cover we're going to talk about the
[03:08:21.940 --> 03:08:28.740]  study that you've heard about probably at this point 72 of americans agree with trump in saying
[03:08:28.740 --> 03:08:35.860]  that america has lost its greatness that we are not as great as we once were i think that's an
[03:08:35.860 --> 03:08:40.340]  obvious fact but we're going to break that down and we're going to open the phone lines for your
[03:08:40.340 --> 03:08:46.500]  take on how america has gone down the tubes if you think it's gone down the tubes and what you see
[03:08:46.500 --> 03:08:51.700]  in the front lines of what's about to come and you know i want to break that down too
[03:08:52.980 --> 03:09:00.180]  because at the same time that people are saying america has lost its greatness there's a big part
[03:09:00.180 --> 03:09:05.140]  of us and i've seen it right i mean with the theories of september collapses and everything
[03:09:05.140 --> 03:09:11.700]  like that that really wants it all to finally happen because at a subconscious level we're so
[03:09:11.700 --> 03:09:17.620]  sick and tired of all of it that we just wish it would come to a head and i've got some stories
[03:09:17.620 --> 03:09:22.180]  that we're going to cover throughout this next hour including some interesting ones like this one
[03:09:22.180 --> 03:09:29.220]  silent killer germany showcases four barrel laser gatling gun during this week's defense and security
[03:09:29.220 --> 03:09:36.740]  expo in london german defense contractor unveiled a new sea-based anti-drone laser system we've got
[03:09:36.740 --> 03:09:45.940]  some other stories too we've got about this ceo that raised the price of an anti-parasitic drug
[03:09:45.940 --> 03:09:56.820]  that was used for hiv patients to prevent infection from 13 and 50 cents to 750 per tablet and with
[03:09:56.820 --> 03:10:01.780]  all of this madness going on it really makes us think gee i wish it would all come to a head
[03:10:01.780 --> 03:10:09.780]  america has lost it we've lost our minds we've gone completely insane and as a last bastion of hope
[03:10:09.780 --> 03:10:15.620]  the listeners of this program you know we we sit here and we think wow this is truly insane we love
[03:10:15.620 --> 03:10:20.740]  humanity we love the goodness in life we love nature and going out in the woods and just
[03:10:20.740 --> 03:10:24.900]  seeing the beauty and animals and everything like that but we hate the evil evil that is
[03:10:24.900 --> 03:10:30.660]  encompassing this country and sucking it up like a giant octopus and that i believe is why so many
[03:10:30.660 --> 03:10:35.300]  americans are fed up and just wish something would happen at this point they wish at anything
[03:10:35.300 --> 03:10:42.660]  come to a head and i believe that that is what trump is so successful in doing he knows that
[03:10:42.660 --> 03:10:49.700]  spirit is rising up and that is how he is gaining such momentum but to delve deeper into some of
[03:10:49.700 --> 03:10:55.220]  these stories we actually have to think we're going to talk about this further throughout the hour
[03:10:55.220 --> 03:11:03.780]  or how we've come to this point is understanding that sociopaths typically are able to climb higher
[03:11:04.500 --> 03:11:10.820]  than conscious smart thinkers like us that want to actually help humanity and i mentioned the
[03:11:10.820 --> 03:11:16.820]  story about the ceo that basically bought had an activist buyout of a pharmaceutical company
[03:11:17.380 --> 03:11:24.100]  and changed the price to 750 a tablet which with insurance the hiv patients or other patients
[03:11:24.100 --> 03:11:28.900]  that are taking this drug would have to pay at least about 150 out of pocket per tablet
[03:11:29.860 --> 03:11:34.420]  and if you put that into perspective for a poverty stricken family that's a lot of money and they're
[03:11:34.420 --> 03:11:40.020]  not going to have access to those drugs theoretically right so we think about that and we think about
[03:11:40.020 --> 03:11:46.100]  those kind of people and here he is actually a ceo of different companies and forbes recently sat
[03:11:46.100 --> 03:11:51.060]  down with this guy in this article that i just read before i came on air i wanted to cover
[03:11:51.060 --> 03:11:57.540]  my lunch with i guess you say his name's chicrelly chicrelly what we should learn from
[03:11:57.540 --> 03:12:02.340]  pharma's latest monster latest monster key key terms there too because you think about
[03:12:03.380 --> 03:12:09.780]  paxil already found that the metadata that made paxil safe and approved by the fda actually
[03:12:09.780 --> 03:12:15.780]  led to suicides in teenagers just like phyzer and illy lily illy lily's prozac they found in
[03:12:15.780 --> 03:12:20.100]  the 1980s pretty much did the same thing but of course they're not allowed to tell you about that
[03:12:20.100 --> 03:12:25.220]  well let's talk about this guy so here's the forbes article you already hate martin chicrelly
[03:12:25.220 --> 03:12:30.020]  the bratty former hedge fund manager who raised the price on a drug to treat infections and aids
[03:12:30.020 --> 03:12:35.700]  patients by 5000 percent now it's time to get to know him i'm not saying you should get to know
[03:12:35.700 --> 03:12:39.140]  chicrelly because you're like him in the end you might hate him more he is very smart but
[03:12:39.140 --> 03:12:43.860]  callow and possibly so sociopathic yet much of what he has been written about in the past week
[03:12:43.860 --> 03:12:49.060]  is unrecognizable he's not a bro or a big time executive but a small player with tons of bluster
[03:12:49.060 --> 03:12:54.180]  who took wall street's ideas about drug pricing to their frightening extreme the reason i highlight
[03:12:54.180 --> 03:13:00.980]  that specifically is because it's the perfect profile of somebody that tends to rise up in a
[03:13:00.980 --> 03:13:06.580]  big corporate conglomerate conglomerate specifically big pharma and tends to dominate
[03:13:06.580 --> 03:13:12.180]  because they're willing to do things that others won't truly sociopathic people and i'm not talking
[03:13:12.180 --> 03:13:16.340]  about callous people we're all callous at different points in our lives and we all say mean things
[03:13:16.340 --> 03:13:21.300]  that we don't really mean or we let our anger get the best of us but i mean truly sociopathic
[03:13:21.300 --> 03:13:27.460]  people that don't care if others die because of their actions or actually revel in it if it causes
[03:13:27.460 --> 03:13:33.540]  profit in general truly sociopathic people tend to climb the ranks and their biggest weapon
[03:13:34.100 --> 03:13:39.140]  just like they say the devil's greatest weapon is the thought that he doesn't exist right well
[03:13:39.140 --> 03:13:44.740]  the real greatest weapon of people like this truly evil people is their greatest weapon
[03:13:44.740 --> 03:13:50.820]  is that the average person cannot possibly imagine what a sociopathic or a truly evil person will
[03:13:50.820 --> 03:13:57.220]  do including things like harming others in a serious damaging way and killing people for profit
[03:13:57.220 --> 03:14:01.460]  so time and time again when we try to you know so-called wake people up they say well that's
[03:14:01.460 --> 03:14:05.700]  impossible there's no way that these corporations would do these things there's no way that these
[03:14:05.700 --> 03:14:09.380]  globalists would do these things there's no way that the pope could be saying these evil things
[03:14:09.380 --> 03:14:15.220]  there's no possible way they forget the element that they don't understand which is actually willing
[03:14:15.220 --> 03:14:21.140]  to do harm for profit and willing to kill people in a measurement of gaining something so i want
[03:14:21.140 --> 03:14:26.660]  to highlight that and i think it tells us just a little little snippet inside of it into the
[03:14:26.660 --> 03:14:31.140]  greater picture and this is just a small scale example but it's a greater understanding of how
[03:14:31.140 --> 03:14:35.620]  some of these things are happening on a major basis like how they can really sleep at night
[03:14:35.620 --> 03:14:42.180]  and you know it's funny actually this chicrelly guy was asked by a reporter how he slept at night
[03:14:42.180 --> 03:14:48.580]  after raising the price of these pills from $13 to $750 and he said i take an ambient
[03:14:49.540 --> 03:14:54.660]  so that's how he sleeps at night he takes an ambient and goes to sleep thinking about the
[03:14:54.660 --> 03:15:01.860]  possibility of people dying the original article on that from NBC news is drug that fights complications
[03:15:01.860 --> 03:15:10.020]  of AIDS and cancer goes from $1350 to $750 you know the reason i bring this up the reason i bring
[03:15:10.020 --> 03:15:15.780]  up the four barrel laser gatling gun outside of it just being really you know pretty pretty interesting
[03:15:15.780 --> 03:15:21.460]  is it seems like everything is getting wilder by the day it seems like the so-called time spiral
[03:15:21.460 --> 03:15:28.500]  which is the theory that in the beginning of time time moves slow but as history progresses the time
[03:15:28.500 --> 03:15:33.300]  spiral speedens up and everything seems to be a bit hastier a bit swifter a bit crazier a bit
[03:15:33.300 --> 03:15:39.220]  more wild every single day it seems like the so-called time spiral is in full effect these days
[03:15:39.220 --> 03:15:43.300]  with laser technology different scalar weapons all this crazy stuff that you hear about every
[03:15:43.300 --> 03:15:47.380]  single day you think when is it going to finally you know when's it going to when's it going to
[03:15:47.380 --> 03:15:52.900]  burst and that's that tension we all feel that background stress as i call it because you could
[03:15:52.900 --> 03:15:57.540]  be sitting there and you always feel that background stress because there's so much tension
[03:15:57.540 --> 03:16:04.580]  right now in the world and it brings me back to this poll 72% of Americans saying that America is
[03:16:04.580 --> 03:16:12.340]  not great anymore we've lost our power we've lost our greatness we've lost our ability to be the best
[03:16:12.340 --> 03:16:18.100]  which i agree with it also reminds me though of this article that came out today from Science Now
[03:16:18.100 --> 03:16:24.260]  oldest decapitated skull in South America had ritual significance this is an international
[03:16:24.260 --> 03:16:28.420]  team of scientists say they've discovered the oldest known beheaded skull in the Americas arranged
[03:16:28.420 --> 03:16:34.340]  in strange possibly symbolic pose and the reason i bring this strange story up is here we have this
[03:16:34.340 --> 03:16:40.740]  decapitated head with it was it was done apparently in a ritualistic style with hands on top of the
[03:16:40.740 --> 03:16:46.500]  skull and the way they describe it in this science now article said it was a very bloody
[03:16:46.500 --> 03:16:52.740]  horrible disgusting beheading that was potentially common at the time and i bring that up to parallel
[03:16:52.740 --> 03:17:01.220]  today and historical past because as all the craziness continues with laser weapons and nuclear
[03:17:01.220 --> 03:17:06.180]  weapons and all these other things and we say to ourselves man this is all coming to a head
[03:17:06.180 --> 03:17:10.900]  what's the difference between now and thousands of years ago or hundreds of years ago when they
[03:17:10.900 --> 03:17:15.140]  were doing ritualistic beheadings and killing people because they thought there were witches
[03:17:15.140 --> 03:17:21.300]  the difference is technology they didn't have nuclear weapons thousands of years ago they
[03:17:21.300 --> 03:17:26.260]  didn't have nuclear weapons hundreds of years ago when they were disemboweling and murdering
[03:17:26.260 --> 03:17:32.180]  and or Genghis Khan run around killing millions of people they didn't have the technology so that
[03:17:32.180 --> 03:17:39.300]  is the difference i believe that humanity has always had this element of pure evil throughout it
[03:17:39.300 --> 03:17:44.660]  kind of like a spider web in the in the history books right it's just it's just always there it's
[03:17:44.660 --> 03:17:51.620]  always it's always amassing itself but the difference now and why things are so tense and so absurd
[03:17:51.620 --> 03:17:56.100]  is technology that is the only difference between hundreds of years ago thousands of
[03:17:56.100 --> 03:18:00.340]  years ago now things have gotten to the point though that instead of while you have a tribe
[03:18:00.340 --> 03:18:06.020]  that comes in and beheads others or kills you know their elders or whatever we have a country
[03:18:06.020 --> 03:18:11.380]  that can use nuclear weapons systems and absolutely abolish and destroy the other
[03:18:11.380 --> 03:18:16.100]  and that's some of the stuff we're going to get into today we're also going to talk about the
[03:18:16.100 --> 03:18:23.620]  future and 43 381 viruses that have been found in the sewage systems many of which are unknown to
[03:18:23.620 --> 03:18:30.420]  scientists some samples found in pittsburgh barcelona and throughout the world they had 43
[03:18:30.420 --> 03:18:35.780]  thousand viruses that we don't even know about that could potentially lead to resistant bacteria
[03:18:35.780 --> 03:18:41.300]  uh resistant viruses the u.s. is finally taking action on antibiotic resistance alex has been
[03:18:41.300 --> 03:18:45.380]  telling you about that for years i've been saying that as well antibiotic resistant bacteria is
[03:18:45.380 --> 03:18:48.900]  probably going to kill millions people in the near future if we don't do something about it
[03:18:48.900 --> 03:18:53.460]  advisory council established on antibiotic resistant bacteria from feedstuffs and then
[03:18:53.460 --> 03:18:58.580]  we're also going to get into some more wild news such as why you should always trust your gut
[03:18:59.140 --> 03:19:03.780]  new science points to why you should trust your gut and some old science as well there's a second
[03:19:03.780 --> 03:19:07.220]  brain in your stomach it influences your mood what you eat and kinds of diseases you get
[03:19:07.780 --> 03:19:12.180]  think twice how the gut second brain influences mood and well-being we're also going to take

[03:24:18.740 --> 03:24:23.300]  some news we were talking in the last segment in the next segment we're going to take your calls
[03:24:23.300 --> 03:24:28.180]  and kit daniels is going to come in and talk about some new censorship that he just uncovered

[03:24:31.620 --> 03:24:35.780]  we were talking about a poll and we're taking your calls next second on this issue
[03:24:35.780 --> 03:24:41.300]  that 72 percent of americans agree america has lost its greatness we've gone down the tubes
[03:24:41.300 --> 03:24:46.420]  we've lost what was once the american spirit the american dream you name it we have lost it
[03:24:47.060 --> 03:24:51.940]  and lienne has just brought in some news too that isn't in that same vein and we're going to break
[03:24:51.940 --> 03:24:58.500]  that down and it goes also with this idea and lienne i want you to comment on this that
[03:24:58.500 --> 03:25:04.020]  we're to blame for it all we're told that it's our fault it's not the corporations that pay
[03:25:04.020 --> 03:25:08.820]  zero percent tax it's the middle class americans that need to pay 50 percent tax it's the middle
[03:25:08.820 --> 03:25:13.380]  class americans that destroyed the economy in 2008 by buying homes when it was really the banks
[03:25:13.380 --> 03:25:18.900]  making tons and tons of cash on phony loans they knew we're totally garbage and it also goes hand
[03:25:18.900 --> 03:25:25.060]  in hand with oh you know target remember when target was so pc and they refused to label gender
[03:25:25.060 --> 03:25:28.900]  specific items and all that kind of stuff and you know it's the middle class americans are the
[03:25:28.900 --> 03:25:34.660]  jerks and corporations are our friends well listen to this story day after employees vote to unionize
[03:25:34.660 --> 03:25:40.980]  in targets target announces fleet of robot workers wow yeah just the day after pharmacy
[03:25:40.980 --> 03:25:45.460]  workers from a brooklyn target store formed a union the company announced plans to replace
[03:25:45.460 --> 03:25:51.860]  employees with robot workers in the near future and they said that was just a micro union they
[03:25:51.860 --> 03:25:55.940]  passed and now they're going to release a fleet of robots it's the corporation screwing us and
[03:25:55.940 --> 03:26:00.180]  i'm not even anti money or anti capitalism or anti corporation but at the end of the day
[03:26:00.180 --> 03:26:04.980]  we are just being blamed for everything the government is is holding hands with the megacorps
[03:26:04.980 --> 03:26:09.220]  they're making billions of dollars consuming us the consumers and then we're being blamed for
[03:26:09.220 --> 03:26:13.060]  all the economic woes everything that's wrong with us everything that's wrong with the country
[03:26:13.060 --> 03:26:18.180]  we're being blamed for and that's why 72 percent of americans are upset and also upset because
[03:26:18.180 --> 03:26:22.660]  they're blamed for it well one of the big issues with that is is a lot of people have grown into
[03:26:22.660 --> 03:26:29.300]  this complacency we are distracted on a daily basis people i think it's so important and so
[03:26:29.300 --> 03:26:34.900]  valuable to post their next selfie of you know flexing at the gym or whatever that's
[03:26:34.900 --> 03:26:40.500]  that's what america is sort of surrounding itself with presently and that's all by design of course
[03:26:40.500 --> 03:26:44.500]  so we're not actually paying any attention to what's going on out there in the world
[03:26:44.500 --> 03:26:50.180]  and i would say that is the only thing that we are at fault it's just allowing ourselves to
[03:26:50.180 --> 03:26:55.460]  become distracted to become programmed to become complacent but you know obviously a lot of people
[03:26:55.460 --> 03:27:02.660]  listening right now are doing what it takes to to you know fight back against this to wake up against
[03:27:02.660 --> 03:27:07.460]  and you know like you were saying in the earlier segment with just it's it's always been bad there's
[03:27:07.460 --> 03:27:13.620]  always been evil differences technology and we're allowing this technology to distract us and to
[03:27:13.620 --> 03:27:18.580]  program us rather than using this technology being alive at this time where we have this
[03:27:18.580 --> 03:27:23.460]  wonderful technology to be able to use it for good and of course you know we're trying to do that
[03:27:23.460 --> 03:27:27.220]  other people are trying to do that as well with waking people up but it's interesting that thing
[03:27:27.220 --> 03:27:32.660]  with target um you know i i feel like that's one of the reasons why they want everyone to be gender
[03:27:32.660 --> 03:27:40.820]  neutral so we are more robotic to destroy the individual to destroy what is that American
[03:27:40.820 --> 03:27:46.020]  entrepreneurial spirit what what makes this country great is the individual that's true they've
[03:27:46.020 --> 03:27:50.500]  hijacked the entrepreneur entrepreneurial spirit like these megacorporations aren't out there doing
[03:27:50.500 --> 03:27:54.500]  good helping people helping rise humanity up making money which is great you know making
[03:27:54.500 --> 03:27:59.060]  money can be a good thing they're actually taking it and just ruining the economy and then laughing
[03:27:59.060 --> 03:28:03.220]  about it yeah and you know what else is interesting you mentioned consumption i think that is the
[03:28:03.220 --> 03:28:08.660]  biggest thing there's three ways that all of us conform to what our reality is and conform to what
[03:28:08.660 --> 03:28:15.300]  our individualism is and the number one thing is the consumption of media so let's say you log
[03:28:15.300 --> 03:28:19.060]  online you're on facebook or on twitter you're on youtube whatever it is you're choosing which media
[03:28:19.060 --> 03:28:22.420]  to consume right and it's going to affect you one way or another you're going to watch shows like
[03:28:22.420 --> 03:28:26.180]  this you're going to get informed you're actually going to awaken your you know higher consciousness
[03:28:26.180 --> 03:28:29.860]  whatever you want to call it you're going to actually figure things out you know make your
[03:28:29.860 --> 03:28:35.780]  brain work but if you're going to choose to watch cnn or some bogus mainstream media all you're doing
[03:28:35.780 --> 03:28:40.100]  is feeling your subconscious and your ocular system in a different way that's all bunch of
[03:28:40.100 --> 03:28:44.420]  garbage and then you wonder why you're dumbed down and why you don't have the information you're
[03:28:44.420 --> 03:28:49.300]  choosing that consumption level so just like you choose what you eat and you could be nutrient
[03:28:49.300 --> 03:28:53.940]  deficient if you go to the grocery store and you only buy processed foods you can be deficient in
[03:28:53.940 --> 03:29:01.300]  your head mentally you can be deficient by eating processed news right consuming processed news
[03:29:01.300 --> 03:29:05.220]  so at the same time you're going to the grocery store you wouldn't eat cheese whiz for your whole
[03:29:05.220 --> 03:29:10.180]  whole diet why would you watch the equivalent of cheese whiz which is the mainstream media
[03:29:10.180 --> 03:29:15.060]  or some stupid cheese whiz media videos all day when you could actually have engaging real

[03:29:59.300 --> 03:30:03.540]  over the weekend charol atkinson released the following article what the news isn't saying
[03:30:03.540 --> 03:30:08.340]  about vaccine autism studies she starts off with the new england journal of medicine study that says
[03:30:08.340 --> 03:30:13.300]  there is no link between vaccines and autism she then discloses the consulting firm behind the study
[03:30:13.300 --> 03:30:17.860]  the luan group lists major vaccine makers among its clients in fact the luan group's parent company
[03:30:17.860 --> 03:30:22.500]  united health group is a key government partner in obama care and a subsidiary of united health group
[03:30:22.500 --> 03:30:27.380]  qssi was given the contract to build the obama care website she then looks at the astroturf
[03:30:27.380 --> 03:30:32.500]  propaganda campaign and some of the buzzwords they use like weak too small haphazard not replicated
[03:30:32.500 --> 03:30:37.220]  junk science flawed unrelated and how these words are used over and over again to attack
[03:30:37.220 --> 03:30:42.180]  anybody who questions the vaccine mafia she then covers over 13 different studies that show a
[03:30:42.180 --> 03:30:46.740]  correlation between vaccine intake and brain damage in fact permanent brain damage isn't
[03:30:46.740 --> 03:30:51.060]  acknowledged rare side effect of vaccines and there's no dispute in that arena so the next time

[03:35:19.700 --> 03:35:24.180]  phone lines and take your calls in a minute but first we've got kit daniels and he ran in here and
[03:35:24.180 --> 03:35:29.620]  said hey facebook just censored is it your article they censored yes absolutely it's the article
[03:35:29.620 --> 03:35:35.060]  entitled pope kid amnesty activist stage pr stunt to promote illegal immigration now i post this
[03:35:35.060 --> 03:35:41.940]  article about 1245 in the afternoon and then i shared it on facebook and you know of course that
[03:35:41.940 --> 03:35:46.420]  generates you know traffic the website and people's go to see our own facebook page and say oh there's
[03:35:46.420 --> 03:35:50.900]  an article up so they go to article and they start sharing it on themselves right off the article
[03:35:50.900 --> 03:35:57.380]  so last time i checked it had about 1500 shares on facebook directly from m4s.com that went down to
[03:35:57.380 --> 03:36:02.100]  zero so i had one of our programmers to take a look at it and he said there's nothing wrong that
[03:36:02.100 --> 03:36:07.780]  i can tell on our website and so i tried to get our social media guy to share the article again
[03:36:07.780 --> 03:36:14.980]  and he wouldn't share the media the meta tag data data and for furthermore the the posts that i shared
[03:36:14.980 --> 03:36:21.540]  of the article about one o'clock p.m it's completely gone they deep six that article entirely now i
[03:36:21.540 --> 03:36:26.100]  know there's been a glitch on facebook but this is the only article that we've had problems with
[03:36:26.100 --> 03:36:31.300]  today so far so i'm kind of wondering you know i know that mark suckerberg you know ceo facebook
[03:36:31.300 --> 03:36:36.820]  he's already he's always pushed pro amnesty and you got the media saying that the pontiff
[03:36:36.820 --> 03:36:41.300]  pope francis can do more right now than obama ever could because he's got the audience and
[03:36:41.300 --> 03:36:46.420]  you got shipper smith saying oh well we can't and the pope with the pope saline's not political
[03:36:46.420 --> 03:36:52.820]  even though it is political obviously so they're like using the pontiff to push a this pro amnesty
[03:36:52.820 --> 03:36:57.860]  open borders agenda while saying it's not political so it you know it's it wouldn't surprise me if
[03:36:57.860 --> 03:37:02.340]  they're suppressing the article because you got sezuckerberg that's completely pro amnesty open
[03:37:02.340 --> 03:37:07.460]  borders whatnot and they don't want you talking bad about the pope when he's pushing their agenda
[03:37:07.460 --> 03:37:12.020]  right so you know i used to be skeptical about facebook censorship right because i always like
[03:37:12.020 --> 03:37:16.100]  to say well you know people there's there's so much stuff out there say they say oh it's censored
[03:37:16.100 --> 03:37:20.020]  you're like really is it just a messed up url or something like that a lot of the times it is
[03:37:20.020 --> 03:37:24.820]  but i actually had if you remember i had my article censored and it wasn't even that hardcore it was
[03:37:24.820 --> 03:37:30.020]  about the dark act banning gmo labeling the united states and i posted it on my site natural society
[03:37:30.020 --> 03:37:35.140]  and infill wars and both were simultaneously banned and when you posted it it's it actually had a
[03:37:35.140 --> 03:37:39.540]  pop-up that came up and said actually you're not allowed to post this on facebook yeah and we did
[03:37:39.540 --> 03:37:44.180]  everything we fixed every possible component that could be a technical issue and resubmitted at 50
[03:37:44.180 --> 03:37:48.740]  times only when we changed the title and changed the image and changed the url but with the same
[03:37:48.740 --> 03:37:52.580]  exact text or everything like that was allowed to be posted for about 15 minutes and then again
[03:37:52.580 --> 03:37:56.900]  it was banned so i've actually experienced this firsthand and it is legitimate this you know
[03:37:56.900 --> 03:38:02.020]  yeah so i a year ago i might have said well let's look at this but i've actually found it to be 100
[03:38:02.020 --> 03:38:07.380]  percent verified at this point facebook has been caught censoring things and it wouldn't surprise
[03:38:07.380 --> 03:38:14.260]  me either and it's also interesting it also goes to show the pope is supposedly a christian figure
[03:38:14.260 --> 03:38:19.780]  and what does the media hate more than christian figures right they said they act like they hate
[03:38:19.780 --> 03:38:25.060]  christian values all these bigots you know how dare they you know we're so pc the christians all
[03:38:25.060 --> 03:38:29.860]  they they hate the gays and all this stuff right but then it's like the pope comes to congress oh
[03:38:29.860 --> 03:38:36.100]  let's let him get broadcast but he's not political he's amazing his holiness the pontiff and they
[03:38:36.100 --> 03:38:40.020]  just worship him like an angelic being and he goes to congress and says all these things that
[03:38:40.020 --> 03:38:43.700]  they would have never accepted right they would have never allowed but you're not allowed to
[03:38:43.700 --> 03:38:47.780]  criticize the pope he's a religious figure they're supposed to hate that but they wouldn't let jesus go
[03:38:47.780 --> 03:38:52.900]  on there that must be you know they would not let jesus address congress if jesus came back today
[03:38:52.900 --> 03:38:57.060]  they would say no this he's a bigot he's jerk you know we're not letting him in congress but the
[03:38:57.060 --> 03:39:01.940]  pope can go what's really telling is the fact that obama every chance he gets he attacks christianity
[03:39:01.940 --> 03:39:08.180]  he was like i think in april he went to a like a christian easter breakfast and of course he
[03:39:08.180 --> 03:39:12.340]  attacks christianity right but when it comes to the pope he's shaking his hands oh yeah come to
[03:39:12.340 --> 03:39:16.020]  white house we're buddies in this and that it's like he doesn't attack christianity when he comes
[03:39:16.020 --> 03:39:19.860]  to the pope well that's of course because he is pushing his agenda and agreeing with him
[03:39:19.860 --> 03:39:24.820]  oh there's a globalist agenda that's right so we're going to go to some calls and let's go ahead
[03:39:24.820 --> 03:39:28.740]  and go straight to walt in michigan walt what's on your mind
[03:39:30.900 --> 03:39:35.860]  hey good evening gentlemen i want to bring up a couple things that always kind of gets overlooked
[03:39:35.860 --> 03:39:44.340]  great galuso when obama was in chicago was his mentor great galuso was a jesuit priest
[03:39:44.340 --> 03:39:51.140]  we now have a jesuit former jesuit is now pope and the jesuit oath extremals the jesuits call
[03:39:51.140 --> 03:39:57.620]  for a world government and destruction of all independent freedom which you have in the holy
[03:39:57.620 --> 03:40:03.060]  alliance with metternack in the early 1800s formulated a plan to take control of this country
[03:40:03.060 --> 03:40:09.380]  we now have roman catholics ruling the united states for the benefit of a pope's new world order
[03:40:09.380 --> 03:40:15.140]  he is their boss that's why they invited him here why do you think they spent what 450 million
[03:40:15.140 --> 03:40:20.340]  dollars protecting their boss so you don't think there's multiple heads though there's
[03:40:20.340 --> 03:40:24.500]  multiple evil people in this country doing multiple different things you think the pope
[03:40:24.500 --> 03:40:29.780]  is the centerfold of all of it all right i'm going to say this i want to be succinct about it
[03:40:29.780 --> 03:40:40.100]  the pope is the top the very top he is the antichrist all these guys are working for satan's system
[03:40:40.100 --> 03:40:47.540]  which is centered in rome it's in the bible in revelation chapter 17 in the king james bible
[03:40:48.260 --> 03:40:54.180]  it's the woman assistant seven hill and this great city rules over the kings of the earth well
[03:40:54.180 --> 03:41:01.940]  what religion are all the kings what religion is joseph biden john roberts who locate you'll be uh
[03:41:02.740 --> 03:41:09.060]  obama care he's a roman catholic not a multi inducted in on the animal for three days after
[03:41:09.060 --> 03:41:14.660]  he passed the obama care six of the nine supreme court justices are high-level roman catholics
[03:41:14.660 --> 03:41:20.100]  and the majority of ones who voted for the same sex marriage out of five roman catholics
[03:41:20.100 --> 03:41:26.340]  janitor paletano well hey netta it is it is pretty very it is very weird that the pope
[03:41:26.340 --> 03:41:31.060]  is being worshiped in the united states i'll give you that you know i don't know about the antichrist
[03:41:31.060 --> 03:41:36.500]  and all that kind of stuff but i will say it is bizarre and damaging that the pope is being worshiped
[03:41:36.500 --> 03:41:42.340]  and presented to congress at some port of angelic amazing creature thank you for your call let's go
[03:41:42.340 --> 03:41:50.740]  to joshua in florida what's on your mind joshua okay how's it going guys i just wanted to add in um
[03:41:51.540 --> 03:41:59.300]  i just want to add in from before that it's more of like um a balance between uh material life
[03:41:59.300 --> 03:42:04.660]  and doing your job and then spiritual life and being a human and that's where the globalists have
[03:42:04.660 --> 03:42:11.060]  lost their way you know so i just wanted to add that in from before what you guys are talking
[03:42:11.060 --> 03:42:16.980]  about we all have the responsibility on our own we don't need other people to help show us the way
[03:42:16.980 --> 03:42:22.100]  we all have to take that responsibility for ourselves to you know break out of that robotic
[03:42:22.100 --> 03:42:28.340]  trance it's difficult to do but it's it's actually just as easy as making that decision
[03:42:28.340 --> 03:42:32.820]  i think you hit the nail on the head i think all of us have a moral responsibility and the problem
[03:42:32.820 --> 03:42:37.540]  is we get too caught up in our nine to five jobs either a seek information and you know so-called
[03:42:37.540 --> 03:42:42.340]  wake up and figure things out or be actually do anything about it because by the time we get home
[03:42:42.340 --> 03:42:46.900]  and i've been there i know how it feels working a long time 10 to 12 hours a day and you get home
[03:42:46.900 --> 03:42:49.940]  and you're tired you don't want to think about anything you don't want to do anything you might
[03:42:49.940 --> 03:42:55.060]  even put on the idiot tube and watch cnn media which we talked about earlier is basically the
[03:42:55.060 --> 03:43:02.900]  equivalent nutritionally as eating an entire jar of cheese whiz as every single meal that you have
[03:43:02.900 --> 03:43:08.260]  so what happens is you get tired you get exhausted you get sick you get dumbed down you get into this
[03:43:08.260 --> 03:43:15.700]  shell and you become a shell of what you could be right and it's only by deciding at a deep
[03:43:15.700 --> 03:43:19.220]  conscious level spiritual level mental level whatever you want to believe that you're going
[03:43:19.220 --> 03:43:24.340]  to do something about it and actually fight and actually help people that you kind of awaken from
[03:43:24.340 --> 03:43:29.300]  that dreamlike state that i know that we've all been put in at one point or another excellent
[03:43:29.300 --> 03:43:36.580]  insightful call thank you let's talk to fred in tennessee how's it going fred ted it's going
[03:43:36.580 --> 03:43:44.580]  pretty good it's ted um well i was i was calling about the decline of america there is a decline
[03:43:45.380 --> 03:43:53.860]  and he was talking about um whose fault it was i hate to say it but it is our fault the the fault
[03:43:53.860 --> 03:44:00.980]  it is you know we we've turned away from god and that's what this country was founded upon you know
[03:44:00.980 --> 03:44:08.820]  so we've turned away from the very thing whiz was founded on and well evil is crept in and our
[03:44:08.820 --> 03:44:14.820]  country is falling apart because of that all the things that we have here is made in china
[03:44:15.860 --> 03:44:23.380]  i mean we don't really make nothing anymore and if we if we do make anything the parts come from
[03:44:23.380 --> 03:44:29.620]  across the water you know i mean yeah our country is falling apart and it is our fault
[03:44:29.620 --> 03:44:35.700]  and the only way we can fix it is get back to we'll get back to god we have become such a
[03:44:35.700 --> 03:44:40.900]  decadent country and relied on the comforts that we experienced and turned away from all forms of
[03:44:40.900 --> 03:44:45.940]  righteousness and every one of its categories and you know we've all done that in some some extent
[03:44:45.940 --> 03:44:52.980]  in our lives but as a nation we have just become consumed by consumerism and we have just fallen
[03:44:52.980 --> 03:44:58.820]  into the depths the total total depths of just getting rid of all production and everything
[03:44:58.820 --> 03:45:03.380]  like that leanna kit what do you guys have to say about that have we not just fallen in such a way
[03:45:03.380 --> 03:45:08.100]  i mean there's a reason that what trump says and and other people resonates really really well and
[03:45:08.100 --> 03:45:12.660]  72 percent agree that america's we're not a nation of builders anymore i mean it basically our
[03:45:12.660 --> 03:45:17.700]  manufacturing's overseas we're basically buying we're using our federal reserve funny money to buy
[03:45:17.700 --> 03:45:24.260]  tv's and foreign cars and whatnot while they're as you know asian countries are they got all the
[03:45:24.260 --> 03:45:27.780]  products they're building themselves they actually got the real assets we don't have anything we have
[03:45:28.820 --> 03:45:34.420]  this money came out with nothing right and also it's like this uh there's two ways you can fight
[03:45:34.420 --> 03:45:39.300]  the government or fight tyrants and power one way is you can go up against the state the other way
[03:45:39.300 --> 03:45:44.500]  is you can live your life as freely as possible as feasibly as possible like home staying steady
[03:45:44.500 --> 03:45:48.980]  raising your children uh homeschooling them so on so forth a lot of people don't realize that anymore
[03:45:48.980 --> 03:45:54.820]  yeah just turning off the boob tube uh you know setting down your take five minutes a day to just
[03:45:54.820 --> 03:46:00.340]  sit and silence and just visualize the day you would like to have the life you would like to have
[03:46:00.340 --> 03:46:05.300]  rather than turning on the tv and letting the tv tell you what your life should look like or what
[03:46:05.300 --> 03:46:11.220]  other people's instagram posts tell you what your life should look like sit and find your quiet
[03:46:11.220 --> 03:46:17.620]  space within yourself to visualize what the life you want to lead and i mean it's as easy as that
[03:46:17.620 --> 03:46:21.940]  five-minute today i mean the government there are tyrants in the government but there's also
[03:46:21.940 --> 03:46:28.180]  tyrants in your own minds it's like thomas jefferson said you have to remove excrete the tyrants
[03:46:28.180 --> 03:46:32.500]  within your that prevents you doing from what you want to do and oh absolutely and i think at the
[03:46:32.500 --> 03:46:37.700]  same time to focus on what the caller and what you guys are saying we also have to look at the
[03:46:37.700 --> 03:46:43.220]  idols of this nation what are they producing because if you think about the forties and fifties
[03:46:43.220 --> 03:46:48.260]  and thirties and stuff the idols the heroes not even idols at that point more so heroes
[03:46:48.260 --> 03:46:53.220]  i would like to say um those were people that created something and stood for something or even
[03:46:53.220 --> 03:46:57.220]  as is john wane or anything like that they actually hey you know they're strong men they
[03:46:57.220 --> 03:47:04.340]  lead they they take care of their family our idols are kim kardashian uh taylor swift who's
[03:47:04.340 --> 03:47:11.140]  not as bad as kim kardashian uh katlyn jenner yeah right so those are those are our idols as a nation
[03:47:11.140 --> 03:47:18.180]  it's if ever if justin beaver it's kind of Kanye west jz uh you know writing songs about beating
[03:47:18.180 --> 03:47:22.100]  women and ruining them but that's politically correct that's politically correct but it's those
[03:47:22.100 --> 03:47:25.540]  evil evil rednecks that do things that are interesting you mentioned those names because
[03:47:25.540 --> 03:47:30.020]  those are all these celebrities that are pushed by the establishment that they want us to worship
[03:47:30.020 --> 03:47:35.460]  of course of course but but they don't produce anything hey at least jz makes music but what
[03:47:35.460 --> 03:47:40.660]  does kim kardashian do nothing absolutely nothing but you also notice on instagram everyone that's
[03:47:40.660 --> 03:47:44.500]  super hot doesn't do anything they have five million twenty million followers they don't do
[03:47:44.500 --> 03:47:48.500]  they don't produce anything so why would you produce anything produce selfies exactly the
[03:47:48.500 --> 03:47:54.100]  number one volume of production in the united states is selfies if we could export selfies
[03:47:54.100 --> 03:47:59.380]  instead of actual resources we'd be in the clear all right let's keep going through these calls
[03:47:59.380 --> 03:48:05.060]  but the the key concept is clear we're not producing anymore we we aren't making anything
[03:48:05.060 --> 03:48:09.220]  and we've been saying that for a long time but at a fundamental level even an individual level
[03:48:09.220 --> 03:48:13.940]  we've lost our passion we've lost our zest for life we're sitting here accumulating dust and
[03:48:13.940 --> 03:48:18.340]  accumulating bedbugs and just waiting to do something rolling around collecting unemployment
[03:48:18.340 --> 03:48:22.660]  as a country as an embodiment of a human being that is the united states of america and then
[03:48:22.660 --> 03:48:28.740]  saying what the heck you know we want more stuff we want more stuff what is that american spirit
[03:48:28.740 --> 03:48:32.980]  find it in yourself absolutely well let's let's add a little beauty to this discussion
[03:48:32.980 --> 03:48:36.820]  because denise wants to talk oh i'm sorry i thought she wanted to talk about hillary clinton
[03:48:36.820 --> 03:48:40.980]  we're actually i wanted to talk about that instead we're going to talk about internet
[03:48:40.980 --> 03:48:48.020]  censorship with anonymous in texas anonymous tell us about some internet censorship hey
[03:48:48.020 --> 03:48:54.020]  anthony uh actually i sent you guys a ship uh link at show tips uh it was a couple nights ago
[03:48:54.020 --> 03:49:01.220]  you know that article uh from the nsa or well on the nsa about uh the nsa hiring trolls to
[03:49:01.220 --> 03:49:07.940]  discredit factual information yes that night i was trying i actually discovered a troll and
[03:49:07.940 --> 03:49:13.860]  i tried to post that article in the comments and just like what uh i can't remember who it was
[03:49:13.860 --> 03:49:19.620]  it says article disappeared daniels yeah kid daniels it just the applet comes up you post the
[03:49:19.620 --> 03:49:24.740]  you you paste the link and as soon as the applet disappears the article disappears as well they
[03:49:24.740 --> 03:49:28.500]  they are censoring stuff we know things that are important that would cripple them they're
[03:49:28.500 --> 03:49:34.420]  censoring it they got to control information we know when i when i post an article i i am i can
[03:49:34.420 --> 03:49:39.380]  give direct evidence of paid trolls and it's like the monsanto employee that said i don't
[03:49:39.380 --> 03:49:42.980]  know if you guys remember he said yeah we have paid trolls and he said it in some public form
[03:49:42.980 --> 03:49:47.700]  they didn't realize they were filming or whatever so when i post an article on a few different
[03:49:47.700 --> 03:49:54.100]  subject let's say it's about monsanto or something like that within i'd say 45 seconds of the post
[03:49:54.100 --> 03:49:58.180]  because they have the rss feeds which is what indicates on your browser when an article is
[03:49:58.180 --> 03:50:02.340]  posted so they probably have info wars and everywhere else and they have these rss feeds
[03:50:02.340 --> 03:50:06.500]  and they'll click them constantly refresh them and see oh a new post came up better spam it and
[03:50:06.500 --> 03:50:13.220]  within i'd say 45 seconds 60 seconds literally i'll have a post pasted like this is obvious
[03:50:13.220 --> 03:50:17.700]  fear mongering none of this is true this is scientifically inaccurate i've already reviewed
[03:50:17.700 --> 03:50:22.820]  the studies like something that no one could have typed in 45 seconds and also the same
[03:50:22.820 --> 03:50:27.140]  stuff every single time they have similar names and stuff or they'll put doctor in front of their name
[03:50:27.140 --> 03:50:32.020]  and then they'll come back in like two minutes and concur be like i concur doctor this is wrong
[03:50:32.020 --> 03:50:36.740]  and i think they'll just be ties the same person talking to themselves and we can look at the ip's
[03:50:36.740 --> 03:50:41.620]  which we have done yeah it's the same ip like 17 times and it's the same ip under different names
[03:50:41.620 --> 03:50:46.340]  over and over again so we do know that the trolls are in fact real anyway you're listening to the
