[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:35.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:35.840 --> 00:43.760]  here we are another Monday the 18th day of November 2013 I am your host Alex
[00:43.760 --> 00:50.480]  Jones and we're going to be live here for the next three hours where to start
[00:50.480 --> 00:56.120]  well we obviously have the tornadoes and damaging storms have swept across the
[00:56.120 --> 01:03.440]  Midwest six left dead hundreds left slightly injured more than 30 injured
[01:03.440 --> 01:11.280]  seriously and debris has been found 116 miles away damaging winds that blasted
[01:11.280 --> 01:16.440]  Cleveland Pittsburgh we're going to be breaking some of that down today
[01:16.440 --> 01:20.080]  obviously but that pales in significance we've always had natural
[01:20.080 --> 01:26.520]  disasters and our prayers and thoughts go out to those what is the big inch a
[01:26.520 --> 01:31.840]  lot is what was my top story yesterday on the Sunday show and is still our top
[01:31.840 --> 01:36.800]  story and I'm tempted open the phones up and the second hour for the military to
[01:36.800 --> 01:40.720]  call in the former military or current military to give your take on this but
[01:40.720 --> 01:46.280]  report Israel Saudi Arabia cooperating on possible attack on Iran and nuclear
[01:46.280 --> 01:54.240]  weapons transfers to Saudi Arabia this is a big big deal and so we're going to
[01:54.240 --> 01:59.080]  be talking more about that also US war readiness and jeopardy as pilots flee
[01:59.080 --> 02:05.320]  part of the ongoing purge Michael Maloof is reporting on that at worldnetdaily.com
[02:05.320 --> 02:10.920]  so we're going to be looking into that the producers got a catch on the
[02:10.920 --> 02:15.560]  broadcast I appreciate them doing that he's under the weather but he's gonna
[02:15.560 --> 02:19.760]  come on the show because it's so important James Tague who was the only
[02:19.760 --> 02:25.120]  other person other than JFK and Governor Conley to be shot 50 years ago this
[02:25.120 --> 02:30.320]  Friday he was basically threatened by the FBI then the information was kept
[02:30.320 --> 02:33.400]  out of the Warren Commission he was finally able to testify later in the
[02:33.400 --> 02:37.000]  Warren Commission but he was kept out of the first of it made big national
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.160]  headlines at the time he obviously has the intel and knows what really happened
[02:42.160 --> 02:47.080]  is anyone who was there and witnessing it would he was right there folks
[02:47.080 --> 02:51.280]  grassy knoll hole nine yards he was just right across the street from it got hit
[02:51.280 --> 02:54.280]  by a bullet fragment in the face there were just bullets flying all over the
[02:54.280 --> 02:58.360]  place the limousine the open-air limousine the convertible limousine
[02:58.360 --> 03:03.720]  looked like a Swiss cheese block that had been attacked by rats and there were
[03:03.720 --> 03:07.240]  so many bullet holes in it of course they stripped it out and refurbished it
[03:07.240 --> 03:13.600]  immediately as part of the cover-up you can see it at the LBJ presidential
[03:13.600 --> 03:18.760]  library today and you know the big news is everybody knows at least 90 plus
[03:18.760 --> 03:21.960]  percent know the government killed Kennedy criminal elements did but they're
[03:21.960 --> 03:25.240]  they're they're actually trying to ban not just free speech at Dealey Plaza but
[03:25.240 --> 03:31.680]  in downtown Dallas the mayor who I guess is now God like Kim Jong-un says you're
[03:31.680 --> 03:34.880]  not allowed to hand out flyers you're not allowed to have banners you're not
[03:34.880 --> 03:38.600]  allowed to and the courts are even saying well actually you can't do that so
[03:38.600 --> 03:43.320]  they've already had to back off some but we're going there Wednesday night I'm
[03:43.320 --> 03:47.160]  gonna be down there they're already putting barricades up today Thursday
[03:47.160 --> 03:51.940]  night and Friday I'm gonna be down there exercising my First Amendment and it
[03:51.940 --> 03:54.760]  won't matter I don't even need to go into the whole grassy Noel area where
[03:54.760 --> 03:58.480]  they're gonna have 5,000 selected establishment guests I'm gonna be
[03:58.480 --> 04:02.760]  outside of it where all the media is at pointing out the censorship see when
[04:02.760 --> 04:06.600]  they engage in censorship and manipulation they win if you don't
[04:06.600 --> 04:11.680]  challenge it it blows up in their face if you do challenge it so we're going to
[04:11.680 --> 04:16.360]  be down there and we've got a lot of interesting First Amendment surprises
[04:16.360 --> 04:22.680]  coming up so definitely want to be part of that folks but my issue is James
[04:22.680 --> 04:28.720]  tag shot imagine you'd think three people were shot JFK Governor Connolly
[04:28.720 --> 04:36.040]  and James tag you would think somebody who got shot would be one of the 5,000
[04:36.040 --> 04:38.960]  no he's tried to get in he's not allowed to because he doesn't believe the
[04:38.960 --> 04:43.560]  official story unbelievable litmus test unbelievable proof he's popping it at
[04:43.560 --> 04:48.360]  the bottom of the hour then Dr. Christopher Busby has breaking news on

[08:31.920 --> 08:36.160]  Ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this Monday Worldwide
[08:36.160 --> 08:43.960]  broadcast Dr. Christopher Busby is going to be joining us via video Skype dealing
[08:43.960 --> 08:53.320]  with some very serious news in scientific studies dealing with increased
[08:53.320 --> 08:58.160]  radiation on the West Coast this is concrete stuff Dr. Busby has been very
[08:58.160 --> 09:03.720]  conservative he's a nuclear physicist chemical physicist and also an advisor to
[09:03.720 --> 09:09.760]  the European Union and British Parliament on low-level radiation and
[09:09.760 --> 09:16.840]  its aggregate effects he's got major breaking news joining us coming up in
[09:16.840 --> 09:24.360]  the third hour today concerning two years after Fukushima what's happening
[09:24.360 --> 09:28.640]  the West Coast remember those those prevailing winds and the currents all
[09:28.640 --> 09:34.960]  come in in northern Mexico up the west coast of the United States the southern
[09:34.960 --> 09:39.640]  west coast up into the northern west coast into Canada and then all the way
[09:39.640 --> 09:46.760]  up into Alaska and humans are designed to really take a lot and to put up with
[09:46.760 --> 09:51.960]  a lot look at how we hurt ourselves with alcohol cigarettes the things we do to
[09:51.960 --> 09:57.280]  our body with fast food I mean humans humans tend to not really worry about
[09:57.280 --> 10:00.640]  themselves we tend to worry about our children but not our not ourselves look
[10:00.640 --> 10:04.920]  at the cell phone radiation the microwave radiation on record in so many
[10:04.920 --> 10:10.840]  studies it dizzies the mind literally in the thousands going back 30 years that
[10:10.840 --> 10:16.600]  cell phone radiation causes brain tumors it's a fact but we still use them
[10:16.600 --> 10:23.240]  because they're so convenient killing ourselves to live I think is the best
[10:23.240 --> 10:29.160]  way to put it and I've talked to a high-level member of the establishment
[10:29.160 --> 10:38.440]  off record on a jet ride once in first class on American Airlines and he just
[10:38.440 --> 10:43.720]  said point blank he said look we use people's capacity to adapt against them
[10:43.720 --> 10:48.840]  whatever we do the public will go along with it because they will adapt to it
[10:48.840 --> 10:56.280]  do you understand that and I went oh I see all adaption isn't good like when
[10:56.280 --> 10:58.840]  the military says we're gonna put you under pressure to make you adapt to be
[10:58.840 --> 11:04.840]  stronger that's good adaptation by an individual adapting and overcoming but
[11:04.840 --> 11:08.640]  they actually get it to where we get accustomed to living under something
[11:08.640 --> 11:14.240]  tyrannical or something poisonous it just becomes the new cultural norm he's
[11:14.240 --> 11:19.720]  like now you've got it and so I said so you're just openly praying on people and
[11:19.720 --> 11:24.800]  he said no we have found that the public are basically rat-like and this is how
[11:24.800 --> 11:28.760]  they want to be treated and that you're never going to change them or build them
[11:28.760 --> 11:33.000]  up they want to be in squalor so that's what they want they'll get it and we're
[11:33.000 --> 11:41.480]  going to have corporate management over the entire culture and government
[11:41.480 --> 11:45.320]  because we know how to do it better than government I said wait a minute I'm all
[11:45.320 --> 11:49.000]  for free market and stuff but big corporations just become government and
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.640]  then there's no checks and balances and then it's even more abusive and then
[11:52.640 --> 11:56.440]  you guys consolidate all the wealth for yourselves they actually got angry at that
[11:56.440 --> 12:00.220]  point that's what I found with Rothkopf the head of the Kissinger group at the
[12:00.220 --> 12:04.160]  time when I had him on on and off air and that's what I found with this other
[12:04.160 --> 12:08.800]  guy who was even more high level than Rothkopf is that they literally they're
[12:08.800 --> 12:13.000]  very charming they're very smart they're very devilish they will sit there and
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.600]  they will try to sell you on how you don't get it and how you could be one
[12:16.600 --> 12:20.080]  of them and how the mere fact that you're aware of all this stuff means
[12:20.080 --> 12:26.320]  you're a potential elitist and that's how they get everybody to sell out I can't
[12:26.320 --> 12:30.720]  tell you how many prominent people with top test scores or who are or who are
[12:30.720 --> 12:36.960]  actors even mid-level or who are top academics you all get approached they
[12:36.960 --> 12:43.480]  all get approached and basically told you could be senator you could be
[12:43.480 --> 12:46.320]  president and that doesn't really mean you could be senator you can be
[12:46.320 --> 12:51.200]  president that's literally just what they say to everybody what it means is you
[12:51.200 --> 13:03.920]  can be a functionary high level in the power structure and and and this this
[13:03.920 --> 13:09.120]  has happened to thousands of people tens of thousands of people have been
[13:09.120 --> 13:13.880]  approached basically just to see if you'll get in line I mean I remember the
[13:13.880 --> 13:21.160]  Democratic Party when I was criticizing Bill Clinton off record I was at
[13:21.160 --> 13:25.320]  the capital the state capital and I was given the card by a high-powered person
[13:25.320 --> 13:30.000]  in government and they said give me your number and I had a card at the time
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.240]  because I'm gonna have somebody call you about some news and then pat me on the
[13:34.240 --> 13:37.720]  shoulder and then I got this phone call I'm just remembering this first time
[13:37.720 --> 13:42.080]  it ever happened I've been on air about a year on access television and I was
[13:42.080 --> 13:46.240]  basically told stop being a Republican come join the Democrats right now we'll
[13:46.240 --> 13:51.880]  run you for office we can tell you've got potential and you're you and we're
[13:51.880 --> 13:55.360]  gonna take really good care of you we like you we want to be your friend I
[13:55.360 --> 14:01.000]  went on access TV like two nights later at attack Bill Clinton again and would
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.920]  show clips of him off c-span with a communist Chinese meeting with him and
[14:03.920 --> 14:08.120]  stuff and that was out and talked about Waco and the guy literally when I got
[14:08.120 --> 14:11.280]  home that night because he had my home number then I'd called on that and he'd
[14:11.280 --> 14:17.320]  written it down and I know you know he'd called me that's right I've given
[14:17.320 --> 14:20.320]  my number that was my home number the point was is that he calls back goes
[14:20.320 --> 14:24.720]  how dare you do that how dare you you keep doing that we're not gonna work
[14:24.720 --> 14:30.240]  with you and folks this was this was a high-level person that the extremely
[14:30.240 --> 14:35.960]  high-level Democrat had called me don't know why I'm telling these stories it's
[14:35.960 --> 14:41.200]  just that's how the real world actually works ladies and gentlemen and it's
[14:41.200 --> 14:48.520]  very very frustrating that the radiation levels went up in the milk in the
[14:48.520 --> 14:56.280]  water in the surface shrubs and vegetables the FDA and EPA actually
[14:56.280 --> 15:03.440]  tested them they both test they found was it six times the safe levels in the
[15:03.440 --> 15:07.040]  yellowfin tuna and the bluefin tuna caught off San Diego and suppressed that
[15:07.040 --> 15:11.840]  news for a year and then that they had the FDA just raised the levels of what
[15:11.840 --> 15:18.880]  they say are acceptable you know safe radiation and I at least went and looked
[15:18.880 --> 15:23.120]  at the trade winds and where they come in over Texas and tried to go get some
[15:23.120 --> 15:28.640]  radiological metering from the University of Texas and they only found
[15:28.640 --> 15:33.200]  slightly increased in Texas because the most the winds are going north of Texas
[15:33.200 --> 15:39.120]  from Japan but boy I tell you folks if you're on the west coast I mean they've
[15:39.120 --> 15:42.640]  picked up high levels of radiation in Vermont in the milk after this stuff
[15:42.640 --> 15:46.680]  happened and yeah there's the headlines right there governments worldwide
[15:46.680 --> 15:51.560]  raise acceptable radiation levels based on politics Washington blog at
[15:51.560 --> 15:55.000]  info wars dot com it says instead of protecting people governments cover up
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.840]  the by raising safe radiation levels based on politics not science and then
[15:59.840 --> 16:04.480]  let's scroll down and then you could see all the links he's got to mainstream news
[16:04.480 --> 16:09.640]  and government announcements in tepco and over in Japan where they all admit it
[16:09.640 --> 16:13.280]  now and I was like washington's blogs at the bottom he'll show a bibliography
[16:13.280 --> 16:20.120]  where he got all of his sources and then you can link right through to it in all
[16:20.120 --> 16:25.680]  those reports but again I've got all this breaking huge news and I'm going to
[16:25.680 --> 16:33.360]  get to it right now it's just I want to say this the establishment oh you're
[16:33.360 --> 16:39.080]  breathing this radiation to you're eating the GMO even though you try to
[16:39.080 --> 16:43.040]  avoid it you know your kids aren't avoiding it you know only the most
[16:43.040 --> 16:47.960]  disciplined people can avoid this stuff and and and you're getting blowback
[16:47.960 --> 16:53.640]  from all this so so what it is is people that join the establishment imagine
[16:53.640 --> 16:58.080]  that by joining the establishment they have protected themselves from all of
[16:58.080 --> 17:01.680]  these problems and that's actually what I found well that's another thing they
[17:01.680 --> 17:07.760]  always say oh you'll protect your family by joining the establishment and then
[17:07.760 --> 17:16.480]  you can work from the inside for good by compromising and really you don't ever
[17:16.480 --> 17:20.600]  get to affect any change working in the establishment from the research and the
[17:20.600 --> 17:23.000]  history I've looked at no things get really bad and folks figure out there
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.840]  in deep trouble then things do start to change because the worst common
[17:26.840 --> 17:34.000]  denominator within the power structure tends to then be the leader of the pack
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.720]  and that's what I'm trying to get out here now separately from all of that
[17:40.720 --> 17:47.960]  here is the top news US stocks back off psychological hurdles as a builder
[17:47.960 --> 17:52.800]  confidence goes flat yeah the economy is going into cardiac arrest Obama care if
[17:52.800 --> 17:58.880]  it doesn't kill the economy shutting down the power plants will and then we've
[17:58.880 --> 18:03.520]  got this big story that's super ultra creepy up on info wars dot com TSA rolls
[18:03.520 --> 18:09.400]  out detention pods at airport terminals and I actually told you about this about
[18:09.400 --> 18:15.240]  four years ago because it was in major magazines and things I could just read
[18:15.240 --> 18:22.440]  what what what DHS was describing and see some of the new test facilities they
[18:22.440 --> 18:26.840]  were building and it's these tunnels you go through where you just basically get
[18:26.840 --> 18:31.440]  snatched and disappeared for further quotes screening so you think oh it's
[18:31.440 --> 18:35.040]  gonna wave me right through it says that my my background check has been done
[18:35.040 --> 18:40.960]  I'm safe but then you just basically then get cordoned off into in into jail
[18:40.960 --> 18:46.360]  cells if they want and now they're putting in these jail cells even after
[18:46.360 --> 18:51.560]  you are trying to leave the airport now when you've gotten off the plane you go
[18:51.560 --> 18:56.040]  into these big steel doors that look like something out of a science fiction
[18:56.040 --> 19:00.240]  movie and then it closes to decide if you're authorized to leave and then the
[19:00.240 --> 19:05.120]  other door opens and then they admit that's what it's for total prisoner
[19:05.120 --> 19:10.760]  training and remember this is for the Al Qaeda threat that the globalist openly
[19:10.760 --> 19:15.320]  have funded I mean go look at who set up Saudi Arabia British intelligence out of
[19:15.320 --> 19:22.640]  a group of Bedouin tribalist look at who runs this whole show it's so
[19:22.640 --> 19:28.520]  frustrating ladies and gentlemen Al Qaeda the Wahhabist are 100% made by the
[19:28.520 --> 19:43.480]  British crown in 1903 the sons and grandsons of the Bedouin leader are now
[19:43.480 --> 19:46.840]  in charge over there and they've now got nuclear weapons and are threatening to
[19:46.840 --> 19:53.320]  nuke Iran so that's the type of news we have and then we've also got actor

[23:12.720 --> 23:17.800]  show you the exact letter they sent in a minute revealing FEMA's plot could land

[23:22.120 --> 23:27.000]  FEMA hates this.com to see undeniable video proof that the government is on
[23:27.000 --> 23:32.440]  the hunt for as much survival food as they can grab in 24 hours be warned it's
[23:32.440 --> 23:37.920]  really disturbing because the fact is FEMA must know something we don't go to
[23:37.920 --> 23:41.840]  FEMA hates this.com to see why survival food is the number one item to hoard
[23:41.840 --> 23:47.240]  right now and why supplies are so low or even completely sold out already at many
[23:47.240 --> 23:51.800]  stores across America do it now because I don't know how long it will be online
[23:51.800 --> 24:04.760]  so go to FEMA hates this.com while you can that's FEMA hates this.com

[24:38.960 --> 24:44.000]  years ago in 1963 in Dallas coming up in the next segment let me get to this
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.920]  story right now that's up on info wars.com and prison planet.com that
[24:48.920 --> 24:54.240]  really is national news the TSA is prisoner training they're rolling out
[24:54.240 --> 24:58.400]  on the streets the highways the bus terminals they're federalizing where
[24:58.400 --> 25:02.520]  quote infrastructure jobs you've got to get TSA approval to have that job as a
[25:02.520 --> 25:06.240]  background check that's expanding even the people that work at national parks
[25:06.240 --> 25:11.920]  people that work at factories this is a federal registry where you don't work if
[25:11.920 --> 25:15.640]  they don't want you to you don't leave the country if the IRS has an
[25:15.640 --> 25:20.440]  investigation open on you this is what they openly are announcing it's for
[25:20.440 --> 25:24.000]  capital controls and I'll to not let you get out of the country or get money out
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.280]  of the country the TSA's announced this is their plans now when you leave the
[25:29.280 --> 25:34.440]  airport or go into different areas doors closed that are only one way and
[25:34.440 --> 25:39.560]  notice the local news introduces this perfectly like what is it it looks fun
[25:39.560 --> 25:46.920]  oh people like it you go in it locks and then when it's ready it authorizes for
[25:46.920 --> 25:52.480]  you to leave and that's what putting you in the glass box was about first getting
[25:52.480 --> 25:56.400]  you ready go to that area which is a glass box around you it's a cage it's
[25:56.400 --> 26:02.880]  the cone of shame it's you know directly from the movie up squirrel squirrel you
[26:02.880 --> 26:06.680]  got to see what I'm talking about it is the dunce hat in the corner this is all
[26:06.680 --> 26:14.080]  admit it this is so social engineering this is total control and this is TSA
[26:14.080 --> 26:19.800]  prisoner training the TSA has bought over a hundred as of two years ago
[26:19.800 --> 26:25.760]  mobile 18 wheeler trailers that you walk in one area it retinas scans you it has
[26:25.760 --> 26:29.680]  a lie detector quack machine and then they ask you questions about do you have
[26:29.680 --> 26:33.480]  recording devices are you a terrorist which again treats you like you're a
[26:33.480 --> 26:37.240]  criminal and psychologically makes you feel like you've done something wrong
[26:37.240 --> 26:41.840]  this is government teaching us all we're perpetrators we're bad when
[26:41.840 --> 26:46.000]  historically big government's the number one perpetrator imagine if you ask
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.840]  one of these TSA people at a concert or football game hey I don't want to be put
[26:49.840 --> 26:53.720]  on a brain scanner I don't want to be put on a voice print I don't want to have
[26:53.720 --> 26:58.400]  you also grope me first you go on they grope you then they set you down we've
[26:58.400 --> 27:04.320]  played these training videos before this is rolling out then they go oh further
[27:04.320 --> 27:08.440]  screening and send you to a cage area where then they talk to you over a TV set
[27:08.440 --> 27:14.120]  and then and then say we're scanning you for lying I don't have a recorder yes
[27:14.120 --> 27:19.520]  you do you have a smartphone oh I'm sorry don't you ever lie to me again again
[27:19.520 --> 27:22.920]  this is this is how they're going to train us for FEMA camps folks is just
[27:22.920 --> 27:27.480]  rolling out slowly where it's normal oh we have a highway checkpoint DHS bought
[27:27.480 --> 27:35.280]  over a thousand this year mobile highway command bulletproof pill boxes that
[27:35.280 --> 27:40.440]  that that they have two 18 wheelers come and basically plug in and creates a V
[27:40.440 --> 27:46.240]  with armored shielding and windows on it where they can I mean this is classic
[27:46.240 --> 27:49.800]  military takeover they're pre-deploying weaponry everywhere they've had a
[27:49.800 --> 27:53.880]  Marine Corps Colonel go public and warn people a few months ago to his city
[27:53.880 --> 27:57.200]  council I mean this is happening for anybody that studied war fighting folks
[27:57.200 --> 28:03.040]  we know what this is the pre-caching the preparation here is the new video where
[28:03.040 --> 28:08.320]  they are promoting all of this after people get off a plane the new airport
[28:08.320 --> 28:12.280]  exits are getting some strange looks something they look like a science
[28:12.280 --> 28:16.520]  fiction intergalactic time machine I was expecting to get transported somewhere
[28:16.520 --> 28:20.320]  like on Star Trek I thought yeah we finally get a transport of the 1984
[28:20.320 --> 28:25.240]  x-ray chamber or might fill up with dollar bills like on a game show yeah
[28:25.240 --> 28:29.840]  was odd I'm like by the way it's meant to look like the naked winner to condition
[28:29.840 --> 28:33.880]  you to accept the other one because it looks just like the scanner is
[28:33.880 --> 28:37.180]  futuristic everybody refuses you understand so you can't even tell
[28:37.180 --> 28:40.760]  Syracuse Airport's 60 million dollar renovation that is the plan to keep the
[28:40.760 --> 28:44.920]  passenger area psychologist coming up with this leaving enter the portal wait
[28:44.920 --> 28:49.960]  for one door to close then the other one opens the portal is one way if anyone
[28:49.960 --> 28:54.760]  tries to get back into the secure area the door automatically locks we need to
[28:54.760 --> 29:00.360]  be vigilant and maintain high security protocol at all times these portals were
[29:00.360 --> 29:05.800]  approved design and approved by TSA which is Syracuse is one of the first
[29:05.800 --> 29:09.760]  airports in the country to have the new portals previously the exit was
[29:09.760 --> 29:14.080]  monitored by police or security guards Syracuse's Airport Commissioner says
[29:14.080 --> 29:19.000]  the new portals should also save money in the long term that's enough you know
[29:19.000 --> 29:25.280]  Ted Anderson was there we had dinner about 12 years ago with a very famous
[29:25.280 --> 29:31.840]  psychiatrist in upstate Minnesota at a lodge he wanted to meet me he'd work
[29:31.840 --> 29:36.920]  with the government in subliminal messaging and television and he
[29:36.920 --> 29:40.760]  basically described and explained a lot of things to both of us but the issue
[29:40.760 --> 29:44.320]  is that's what that whole thing is is total conditioning for you to be a total
[29:44.320 --> 29:48.080]  prisoner and they look just like naked body scanners so that so whether you
[29:48.080 --> 29:52.160]  like it or not you must go through them we're on the March the Empire's
[29:52.160 --> 29:56.720]  conditioning total acclimatization Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[29:56.720 --> 30:05.680]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[30:05.680 --> 30:09.440]  pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[30:09.440 --> 30:13.520]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[30:13.520 --> 30:16.960]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[30:16.960 --> 30:21.720]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[33:59.160 --> 34:03.240]  close you off and they're coming out with whole tunnels where you go and then a

[35:28.080 --> 35:34.720]  in Dallas 50 years ago this Friday and he received a wound on his right cheek
[35:34.720 --> 35:39.040]  during the assassination from a ricochet of a bullet intended for Kennedy
[35:39.040 --> 35:43.280]  absolutely there were a lot of bullet holes in the concrete I think you can
[35:43.280 --> 35:47.440]  still see some of them he is the only person in addition to Kennedy and Texas
[35:47.440 --> 35:52.520]  governor John B Connelly known to have been wounded by gunfire in Dallas a

[36:09.120 --> 36:12.960]  people are being selectively given them and anyone who criticizes the official
[36:12.960 --> 36:17.320]  story that only about 9% of people on average in scientific polls agree with
[36:17.320 --> 36:22.880]  90% or more but do not believe the official story including the the the
[36:22.880 --> 36:28.160]  Secretary of State John Kerry doesn't believe it but that doesn't matter
[36:28.160 --> 36:32.200]  doesn't matter you're not allowed to be there and now we've got our reporters
[36:32.200 --> 36:36.000]  actually going up there tomorrow I'll be there Wednesday night the barricades
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.120]  are already going up and we talked to insiders I've already had one of my
[36:39.120 --> 36:43.360]  crew members up here last week who talked to the hotels talked to the police
[36:43.360 --> 36:46.520]  off record and others the word is they're gonna push the barricades up to
[36:46.520 --> 36:50.360]  six seven blocks back and have checkpoints so they can have the
[36:50.360 --> 36:56.360]  international media there and control this so Jim tag joins us right now

[37:02.960 --> 37:06.080]  Warren Commission didn't even know about him until later than he testified
[37:06.080 --> 37:12.720]  this is how controlled the FBI whitewash was and he joins us now sir thank
[37:12.720 --> 37:17.720]  you for coming on well well sir you've got the floor talk about your
[37:17.720 --> 37:21.200]  experience that day your book where you break down what really happened and and
[37:21.200 --> 37:25.160]  then now this attack on free speech it looks like the shadow government didn't
[37:25.160 --> 37:29.600]  just kill our president 50 years later they're killing our first amendment well
[37:29.600 --> 37:40.280]  I my new book LBJ and the Kennedy killing I start from the first to go all the
[37:40.280 --> 37:47.480]  way through a lot of people well back up people's 15 years old in our 65 now so
[37:47.480 --> 37:53.720]  a lot of information that was not known I've put into a book a hundred and one
[37:53.720 --> 37:59.960]  stories in a hundred and one chapters now let me go back to that day I was
[37:59.960 --> 38:05.480]  there by accident just got stopped in traffic wasn't planning on said anything
[38:05.480 --> 38:13.960]  and our car was stopped under the triple underpass got out all four or five steps
[38:13.960 --> 38:21.480]  to get into the visibility of a daily plaza no more than done that and so my
[38:21.480 --> 38:26.960]  throws a firecracker pop well that's what it sounded like but it was the first
[38:26.960 --> 38:32.240]  shot and I'm thinking to myself what kind of idiot would be thrown a firecracker
[38:32.240 --> 38:38.720]  with the president by no more get those thoughts out of my mind and crack crack
[38:38.720 --> 38:45.760]  of two rifle shots something stings me in the face well that catches my
[38:45.760 --> 38:54.160]  attention something going on anyway I'm standing there for a moment stunned a
[38:54.160 --> 38:59.560]  man in a suit come running up to me turns out he's a deputy sheriff named
[38:59.560 --> 39:08.000]  buddy Walters and he asked me what's going on down here I don't know we stand
[39:08.000 --> 39:12.440]  there for a moment and notice that the motorcycle placement's talking to a
[39:12.440 --> 39:18.960]  couple people what is now known as a grassy no we wait for traffic to clear
[39:18.960 --> 39:24.640]  which been released after the motorcade and get across the street just in time
[39:24.640 --> 39:31.440]  to hear this man sobbing his head exploded his head exploded and the
[39:31.440 --> 39:37.880]  policeman says who's head he says the president's and I'll never forget deputy
[39:37.880 --> 39:43.400]  sheriff buddy Walters turned to the grass there beside the sidewalk and
[39:43.400 --> 39:50.560]  kicking the grass with his toe hard as it could damn damn damn it looked up at
[39:50.560 --> 39:54.760]  me and he says you got blood on your face and reached up and palm my hands
[39:54.760 --> 40:00.000]  turned up and I remember something stinging me doing the crack crack of
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.400]  two rifle shots buddy asked me says where were you standing and that's the
[40:05.400 --> 40:10.520]  back over where you ran up to me and so we wait for traffic to clear again and
[40:10.520 --> 40:17.920]  before we can get over to the point between main and commerce it's very
[40:17.920 --> 40:22.680]  narrow right there before goes on the underpass but it's because it looked
[40:22.680 --> 40:30.720]  here on the curb could see from across the street a bullet mark on the curb and
[40:30.720 --> 40:39.560]  we stand there look at it we both felt of it tried to line it up and finally we
[40:39.560 --> 40:45.200]  go back across the street where people start together and comparing notes what
[40:45.200 --> 40:52.960]  just happened I'm asked to stick around they wanted his statement from me well
[40:52.960 --> 40:58.640]  about 20 minutes after the shooting I suddenly remember my car still setting
[40:58.640 --> 41:04.160]  up the street so I go jump in it to move it get out of the way and repark and I
[41:04.160 --> 41:13.960]  couldn't crowds of people I suddenly come on the reply zone is a traffic jam so
[41:13.960 --> 41:20.680]  I drove on down to the police station told the best sergeant was there he
[41:20.680 --> 41:28.040]  sent me up to homicide and I sat in homicide for perhaps 30 minutes until
[41:28.040 --> 41:37.040]  a sergeant walks our detective named Gus Rose walks in and the detective takes
[41:37.040 --> 41:43.560]  out a yellow bat and takes briefly the notes who's very simple I just cut
[41:43.560 --> 41:50.240]  stopped in traffic and something that started me on tape bubble boss and as
[41:50.240 --> 41:55.000]  we're about to end up there's a noise there at the door of homicide and two
[41:55.000 --> 42:00.320]  police men bring a man in handcuffs behind his back
[42:00.320 --> 42:06.360]  Detective Rose says what you got there and one of the policeman says this is a
[42:06.360 --> 42:12.680]  man that killed a placement over no cliff while I go so anyway I was excused at
[42:12.680 --> 42:18.280]  that point went home but that night I noticed on TV the man they brought in
[42:18.280 --> 42:24.920]  while I was there was we are the Oswald now at that point I sat down that evening
[42:24.920 --> 42:31.720]  for some reason I don't know why and pulled out a spiral notebook he wrote
[42:31.720 --> 42:36.160]  down everything I could remember from that day well I know why that's common
[42:36.160 --> 42:39.760]  sense you just saw the president get executed and you want to keep everything
[42:39.760 --> 42:44.800]  fresh that's exactly what I would do well I that's what I did still got it
[42:44.800 --> 42:52.800]  today and anyway through the years I collected a lot of notes this at the
[42:52.800 --> 42:58.480]  other put it out of my mind for years this was something in the past and then
[42:58.480 --> 43:05.600]  I did not allow to interfere with my family or my career but my wife kept a
[43:05.600 --> 43:14.600]  lot of notes he does in the books in 1988 I want a plane going to New York you
[43:14.600 --> 43:19.000]  get talking to the lady next to it turns out she's Madeline Brown
[43:19.000 --> 43:27.080]  Lyndon Johnson's mistress for 21 years the tales she told me was almost
[43:27.080 --> 43:34.160]  unbelievable I absorb it put it in the back of my mind but not let it get to me
[43:34.160 --> 43:38.960]  and by the way I knew her and interviewed her in person many times and
[43:38.960 --> 43:43.800]  she even had a son with LBJ even absolutely and I had family that lived
[43:43.800 --> 43:47.760]  in Austin at the time and I mean pretty much everybody then it was such a
[43:47.760 --> 43:51.560]  small town knew about LBJ and the things he was up to but it's on record that
[43:51.560 --> 43:58.320]  that really was his mistress that's correct that's correct but anyway she
[43:58.320 --> 44:01.640]  had a long tail to tell which I'm sure you've heard you probably heard what
[44:01.640 --> 44:08.120]  she had to say no but recap it for folks well you know about him getting drunk and
[44:08.120 --> 44:14.280]  telling her the planning and things that they did that we can't say it on air
[44:14.280 --> 44:17.440]  because it's profane but you know that son of a you know what'll never embarrass
[44:17.440 --> 44:24.040]  me again after tomorrow that's correct that that was that goes back to the
[44:24.040 --> 44:32.200]  meeting the night before the assassination at the Clint Marcus and of
[44:32.200 --> 44:38.200]  course tricky Dickie was also in town for a soda pop convention that's what
[44:38.200 --> 44:46.000]  the record says J Edgar Hoover and Nixon and a bunch of people were there and
[44:46.000 --> 44:53.880]  supposedly a party for Hoover he meant the party was over and actually in the
[44:53.880 --> 45:01.200]  morning hours I think 12 30 the morning and Lyndon Johnson comes walking in to
[45:01.200 --> 45:07.560]  the party it breaks up and they have a secret meeting in the people we just
[45:07.560 --> 45:14.680]  mentioned go into this meeting and the meeting was really the the planning at
[45:14.680 --> 45:22.160]  the covering up the assassination when the meeting's over Lyndon Johnson comes
[45:22.160 --> 45:26.960]  walking over to Madeleine we've been waiting in the living room and as you
[45:26.960 --> 45:32.360]  said we can't say it on TV but it said there's a bunch of records
[45:32.360 --> 45:38.640]  candidates won't be making fun of me anymore or something that effect and
[45:38.640 --> 45:45.560]  but anyway I at that time did not absorb I was I had a busy life going on at the
[45:45.560 --> 45:52.200]  time but then I start meeting other people that are insiders to Johnson and
[45:52.200 --> 46:00.120]  one by one they tell me the same exact story Lyndon Johnson was behind the
[46:00.120 --> 46:04.920]  assassination of John F Kennedy listen his lawyer as you know is now gone
[46:04.920 --> 46:08.440]  public and talked about all his hitmen in Austin the rest of it was well known
[46:08.440 --> 46:12.720]  LBJ would just swagger around bragging about it drunk half the time he owns
[46:12.720 --> 46:16.520]  half the town still his family does I'm even on a local radio station he's
[46:16.520 --> 46:22.520]  stoned KLBJ 590 and he just basically did whatever he wanted to and I even
[46:22.520 --> 46:26.640]  know folks I'm not going to get into it the point is is that this is an open
[46:26.640 --> 46:30.720]  secret in Texas they had signs up everywhere saying go after him for
[46:30.720 --> 46:35.760]  treason and all the rest of it and then they act like that you know we're
[46:35.760 --> 46:38.800]  weird for saying this but I want to talk about the first amendment we'll also
[46:38.800 --> 46:42.560]  get into your books are which everybody obviously should read to get a real you
[46:42.560 --> 46:46.080]  know insider breakdown on what happened because I've read your book is very
[46:46.080 --> 46:50.000]  historical from my deep research and is an excellent read but expanding on this
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.160]  if you just joined us James Tague the only other person shot other than JFK and
[46:54.160 --> 46:59.720]  Governor Connolly 50 years ago this Friday in 1963 on November 22nd what
[46:59.720 --> 47:02.960]  do you make because it's in the Dallas newspapers the fact that you've said you
[47:02.960 --> 47:07.680]  want to go but no a man who was there a man who saw the president's head blown
[47:07.680 --> 47:13.120]  off from I don't know 15 20 yards whatever it was and then was wounded by a
[47:13.120 --> 47:19.800]  bullet fragment in the face you don't get to go and then the mayor says
[47:19.800 --> 47:24.480]  openly well we we don't you know want this to be unseemly with any
[47:24.480 --> 47:29.520]  conspiracy theorist we want this to be classy yes very classy to have the
[47:29.520 --> 47:36.240]  political progeny of the establishment who killed JFK to bring in a military
[47:36.240 --> 47:41.280]  industrial complex coup d'etat so so that so that they don't have to hear the
[47:41.280 --> 47:46.040]  90% of the American people that don't buy their bull what is your take on that
[47:46.040 --> 47:49.560]  and and what do you think of the fact that you and others that don't buy the
[47:49.560 --> 47:54.160]  official story are being barred from this this this Tiananmen Square you know
[47:54.160 --> 48:06.320]  style communist parade well it's been six seven weeks ago I was in a photo session with the mayor was
[48:06.320 --> 48:16.200]  present and Mike Rollins and I asked him about the way they're handling this 50th
[48:16.200 --> 48:23.320]  anniversary deal and and he made it very clear that this was not about Kennedy
[48:23.320 --> 48:27.840]  being assassinated this was about his life they're gonna celebrate his life
[48:27.840 --> 48:34.400]  and I said well what you know what what about all those barricades and all this
[48:34.400 --> 48:39.160]  stuff I've never known any problems there anybody went to D. Lee president
[48:39.160 --> 48:45.320]  never heard of problem 50 years why why all this military like banging me this
[48:45.320 --> 48:51.040]  short this old shoulders walked off well that's right they spent it like we're
[48:51.040 --> 48:54.560]  gonna have he's in the Dallas morning news a dignified thing to remember his
[48:54.560 --> 48:58.000]  life well then why are they having it where he died why are they having all
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.840]  of the people that push the official story coming there to be inside the
[49:01.840 --> 49:06.000]  perimeter to show the media can have a controlled event you know we've
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.920]  demonstrated about the cover-up of the truth of 9-11 so they started pushing it
[49:09.920 --> 49:14.560]  back until they push you back 10 blocks so they could have a controlled media
[49:14.560 --> 49:23.280]  event that's what this is well I'm surprised now I did get invited to the
[49:23.280 --> 49:31.240]  museum on Wednesday evening for a special deal so one completely left out of
[49:31.240 --> 49:37.120]  it but as far as being there for the 50th anniversary no I'm not not invited
[49:37.120 --> 49:40.640]  no I was about to say because of lawsuit threats they're allowing people that
[49:40.640 --> 49:44.400]  weren't given tickets who are obviously part of it more witnesses and
[49:44.400 --> 49:48.560]  victims there's only three victims well the American Republic was a victim but
[49:48.560 --> 49:53.720]  you actually shot by a fragment a ricochet piece but that's what they're
[49:53.720 --> 49:57.080]  doing now is they're gonna allow some of the groups that threaten to sue they'll
[49:57.080 --> 50:01.200]  be able to be brought over for five minutes in their little cordoned area
[50:01.200 --> 50:06.240]  look I'm gonna be there sir and I hope thousands of my listeners show up to
[50:06.240 --> 50:10.360]  protest the attack on the First Amendment because I mean they turned
[50:10.360 --> 50:14.000]  Tiananmen Square into a non-free speech zone we don't want them to turn Dallas
[50:14.000 --> 50:21.880]  into one well now and I get to back up a little bit on the 40th anniversary they
[50:21.880 --> 50:27.240]  had daily plaza blocked off all three streets and I was the guest speaker for
[50:27.240 --> 50:35.720]  the exact moment of the 40th anniversary that NBC ABC CBS and all the other TV
[50:35.720 --> 50:40.560]  cameras there and I was proud of that and there was no problems whatsoever it's

[54:32.800 --> 54:40.040]  well folks we've got james tag on the line with us and jim is with us for the
[54:40.040 --> 54:43.360]  six-minute segment the next five-minute segment he's gonna be gone and i've
[54:43.360 --> 54:46.920]  been asking some of the questions here sir you know after you leave you'll
[54:46.920 --> 54:49.600]  probably remember something that you wanted to say and get out there i know
[54:49.600 --> 54:54.360]  you're a texas gentleman listen to you talk you sound pretty much look like my
[54:54.360 --> 54:59.640]  mother's father my grandfather i guess that'd be my paternal or no maternal
[54:59.640 --> 55:04.000]  grandfather so you just sound like a classic old-timey texan you know you're
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.840]  a gentleman you don't like to cause a ruckus you want to be nice but i mean
[55:07.840 --> 55:13.120]  come on they they are openly saying that they're not gonna let anybody in or
[55:13.120 --> 55:17.200]  near that doesn't agree with the official story when major polls show 90% or
[55:17.200 --> 55:20.880]  more what is your take on the censorship issue because people can pick
[55:20.880 --> 55:25.560]  whatever they want about jfk if you research it it's clear as it knows on
[55:25.560 --> 55:29.880]  my face it's an inside job a fraud that killed the patsy but what is your take
[55:29.880 --> 55:33.000]  on the first amendment issue and then other points you'd like to make well
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.200]  first of all there's still people around they do not want the name of a
[55:38.200 --> 55:44.560]  president so they just don't want him to come out but here was a president that
[55:44.560 --> 55:51.040]  ordered at least eight or nine murders we know of and there's people say it was
[55:51.040 --> 56:00.120]  as many as 17 we we know we know who the the assassin is back once his
[56:00.120 --> 56:06.920]  fingerprint was on the sixth floor and it's all there and I don't know why
[56:06.920 --> 56:15.600]  the why the pressure from the government is there to not allow the truth to come
[56:15.600 --> 56:21.240]  out but it's coming out whether like it or not and there's three of us right the
[56:21.240 --> 56:27.800]  same thing almost in different ways and that's a Roger Stone and and Barbara
[56:27.800 --> 56:35.560]  Cullen Barbara Cullen was the attorney name Johnson being behind the
[56:35.560 --> 56:42.000]  assassination is not a big deal to it he's just taking step-by-step and there
[56:42.000 --> 56:48.200]  your proof has been laying there for years well I've been around high-powered
[56:48.200 --> 56:52.800]  Republicans from Texas and it's a big joke I mean it's well known they blew
[56:52.800 --> 56:57.520]  his head off and the and then they sit there and just criticize everyone that
[56:57.520 --> 57:02.320]  talks about it and call us conspiracy theorist you'd have to be really
[57:02.320 --> 57:07.800]  conspiracy theorist a fiction writer to come up with the official story well
[57:07.800 --> 57:12.520]  there's no fiction to it it's non-fiction story the truth has been lying
[57:12.520 --> 57:16.600]  there and bits and pieces for years I'm surprised somebody hadn't put it all
[57:16.600 --> 57:23.880]  together before me one good example I'd like to make is a and I pointed out the
[57:23.880 --> 57:31.120]  book is the escape the assassins escape and it's right and I own a 26 volume set
[57:31.120 --> 57:36.080]  of the warrant report and it's right in the water for Roy truly's testimony
[57:36.080 --> 57:43.960]  third time he testifies he tells how the assassins escaped and it's right there
[57:43.960 --> 57:47.840]  and nobody's picked up on it for years we're gonna go to break I want you to
[57:47.840 --> 57:50.800]  come back and talk about that but specifically what did you make of e
[57:50.800 --> 57:56.200]  Howard Hunt the famous CIA coup d'etat commander giving a deathbed confession
[57:56.200 --> 58:02.280]  and he was part of the operation under LBJ I did not put anything into that and
[58:02.280 --> 58:09.280]  I got a reason for that I I I would look at other books and scan them but I
[58:09.280 --> 58:14.600]  never read other books I don't think I want my head I think I knew I was gonna
[58:14.600 --> 58:19.400]  write this book someday you didn't want it to influence the others you just went
[58:19.400 --> 58:23.640]  off with your own research and being part of it that's right and I guess
[58:23.640 --> 58:27.240]  folks can go to Amazon.com and get your book where else can they go
[58:27.240 --> 58:34.240]  Barnes and Noble they go to my eBay bookstore.
[58:34.240 --> 58:39.800]  Well folks seem to read it, it's a good book stay there back in 60 seconds

[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:33.840]  Alex Jones James Keg the only living person to be shot 50 years ago in
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:39.080]  Dealey Plaza on record sir there's so much to talk to you about but you've
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:42.880]  got your new book out detailing this and it dovetails with the hardcore research
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:47.160]  I've done and also some of the insider intel I've gotten over the years but we
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.640]  have the lawyer of course the father of the White House press secretary Scott
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:57.320]  McClellan went public we interviewed him then as well the establishment does
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:03.560]  not want to be challenged on this but but separately you know other points that
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:08.520]  you'd like to get across to folks out there but this 50th anniversary that's
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:16.760]  coming up well the Warren Commission well let me explain something about the
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:22.360]  work that they did not stand a chance when Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:28.000]  president that very afternoon him and his buddy who's handling the cover-up
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:36.680]  J. Edgar Hoover to the most powerful man in the world were in charge you get
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:41.080]  figured it out or knew what happened there was nobody to go tell it to you it
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:49.320]  was all over LBJ and Hoover were in charge that was the end of it now that
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:54.880]  was the circumstances that the Warren Commission worked and they wound up in
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:04.000]  the war and report final report followed to a tee what Hoover said 48 hours after
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:13.120]  the assassination that the RV Oswald won that assassin blah blah blah and that's
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:18.920]  the reason we had such a bad war and report they just didn't have a chance
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:24.520]  now what a lot of people don't know is J. Lee Rankin who's chief counsel for the
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:32.400]  Warren Commission they he hired 14 young lawyers most of them were young to do
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:39.480]  the investigation now the investigation didn't start until the end of March they
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:45.320]  waited till the Ruby trial was over and they had set two months to do the total
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:50.720]  thing to a contrary what all is well only about ten month investigation two
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:58.840]  months sixty percent of investigation was done in April of 64 and of these 14
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:07.600]  lawyers one by one most of them figured out where the problem was and went to
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:14.400]  Rankin and says hey we need to look into this this has got this to do with it
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:21.080]  Rankin would tell him no we're not going there we're here to close it down and go
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:26.000]  on with life and in fact they said the Commission well you know was just you
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.960]  know there to basically why wash things like the 9-11 Commission what about the
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:32.280]  curb because another was some other curves not the one that ricocheted onto
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:36.360]  you where there were some bullet strike marks but I'm told they cut away the
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.640]  curb and took it to the National Archives with the bullet that hit you or
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:44.360]  the fragment well the curb yeah they on August the fifth I tried testified in
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:56.600]  July 23rd of 64 they cut the curve by the street August the fifth of 64 and sent it
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:02.360]  to the FBI laboratory where they did a test on it which the test that they did
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:08.760]  then has now been found to be faulty junk science but that curve is now setting
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:18.040]  in the National Archives and in 1983 the readers digest paid a an engineering
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:25.120]  firm to go into the archives examine the curve and they found out that yes where
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:33.600]  the bullet had hit the curve has now been patched that store that curve was
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:40.720]  patched just before I testified Wow so just continue to cover up I want to come
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.520]  back and ask you one final group of questions we'll get out here in about
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.720]  five minutes sir and then we'll get to all the news for listeners and open the
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:52.280]  phones up I want to ask mr. Tague who's the only living survivor who was struck

[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:37.240]  washing goes above lbj of course it goes above lbj that's as high as we can
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:42.320]  get but the issue is they're now banning anybody that doesn't agree with the
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:47.320]  official line including mr. tag who's been the keynote speaker a decade ago at
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:51.240]  the 40th anniversary there's never been such censorship going on they're
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:56.200]  keeping everybody many blocks away and even someone wounded there who's
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.600]  famously part of this and it was just i don't know how many yards away from
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.320]  kennedy when his head blew off or blew open not allowed to be there why do you
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:09.360]  think sir they want to control this so much more a and b do you ever think the
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.200]  truth will come out in the mainstream media because it was supposed to come
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.440]  out for 20 years then 40 years then 50 now they've backed it what is it 2025 i
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:23.640]  mean i guess we can never learn what's in those archives because i guess it would
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:29.560]  discredit all the conspiracy theorist aka anyone that questions known liars well
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:34.680]  first of all the truth is out there people's ready to accept it now one
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:41.520]  thing while i was waiting thinking about in my book just as i was about to
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.120]  finish my book i was indeed a pleasure to do an interview for somebody and a man
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:51.160]  walks up to me says uh you james tagging says yeah he says here you might want to
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:57.520]  put this in your book and he handed me a folder when i got home i opened it up and
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:06.680]  it was a copy of the ktb report on linden johnson that they've made in
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:17.920]  1964 5 and in it it's 19th page report which i've included in my book in it they
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.640]  go through their investigation they start out all they want to know who is this
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:27.840]  guy uh johnson what who's his friends what's he like what's his what's his
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:33.800]  politics how's he think or anyway well when they got into it got the answer
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:44.560]  oops he's the one behind the assassination john f kennedy this they had in 1965 two
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:51.200]  years after the assassination they had it step-by-step and solved it here fifty
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:57.840]  years later our government officially hasn't i included this night in my book
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:03.840]  for people to compare and it takes it step-by-step just like i do and roger
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:10.280]  stone and and barma clip and anybody else that solved the the assassination
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:16.280]  linden johnson was behind the assassination and it's it's it's translated
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:24.240]  in English well i agree with you that the truth is out there if people want to
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.960]  face the facts and and really we've won i mean if most polls show 90% or more
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:35.560]  don't believe the official story and the secretary of state goes public saying
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:40.840]  he doesn't buy it then what does that leave the establishment is just still
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.280]  sit up there and laugh at anyone that doesn't believe their official fairy
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:50.440]  tale well that's their problem i'm not going to be my problem 77 years old now
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:55.560]  i put in my book what i know the facts i didn't let anything influence me that
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:01.480]  somebody else has written just what i know from talking to people face to face
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:08.040]  and that i know personally and i don't think any other author
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:15.560]  i could compare that to what i do know i know this the folks up in dalis that
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.240]  are running things who are trying to cover up what really happened they've
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:23.800]  already failed and the fact that they're censoring uh anyone that doesn't
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.440]  agree with their fairy tale is only going to politically backfire on them
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.520]  well i'm not going to let it happen to me i know i know one of the main things
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:35.880]  that needs to be blacks that need to be made public
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:42.280]  hawswald was not the shooter this this uh we've known for 50 years that
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:46.520]  one of the girls saw him in the lunchroom five 15 minutes before the
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:50.280]  assassination in roi truly and maryon baker the
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:55.320]  policeman saw him 75 seconds after the assassination in the lunch
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:59.080]  room uh calm cool like that was her testimony wasn't
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:04.200]  out of breath now we've known that for 50 years so i saw him in the lunch
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:08.600]  room 15 minutes before the assassination in the building manager
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:14.040]  in replacement so i'm 75 seconds after the assassination in the
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:18.840]  lunchroom now we also now know by interviews of who was on the
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:23.480]  stairway and it wasn't oswald that's now documented but then it gets more
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.760]  ridiculous you can't shoot through the oak trees
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.640]  uh that are out there that had their leaves they they dropped their leaves
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:32.600]  not in the winter folks but in another part of the year
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.880]  we have those here in texas i mean it's asinine i've seen the photos
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:40.680]  you could not shoot him period the way they said the obvious shot is from
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.960]  behind the grassy knoll which is what all the witnesses saw
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:47.800]  and witnesses saw the men up there with the pickup truck and the guns
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.160]  and then of course those witnesses all conveniently died very quickly
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:56.760]  well first of all uh one of the big lies was finding three shells on the floor
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.760]  of the sniper's nest there's only two shells found
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:05.560]  so that's been a third person shooting from somewhere else in schoolbook
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:09.960]  depository now that uh and the fact that
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:14.760]  lieutenant day lied about it the first time he testified then when
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:18.600]  when he was asked to retest by he told the truth
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.040]  and uh there wasn't but two shells two shots fired from the sniper's nest
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:25.560]  well sure look at how the dallas police walked uh
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.000]  walked oswald out to be executed he was saying i'm a patsy don't let him kill
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.080]  me i mean this is incredibly obvious
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:38.520]  well the jack ruby oswald's story is a completely different story i don't
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:41.880]  want to i touch on that in my book i don't get
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:46.040]  deep into it that's that's of course i don't go
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:51.880]  uh oswald first of all flat innocent of being shoot that does not mean he didn't
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:57.000]  have something to do with something but oswald was not the shooter
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.040]  malcolm wallace mack mack wallace was his assassin
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:07.960]  his fingerprint was found up there uh it's now been documented uh
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:11.320]  mack wallace in the trail of the people that he
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.680]  that mack wallace had killed for johnson has now been documented
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:18.120]  very interesting well listen james are you going to be down there

[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:35.160]  briefly the reason we have dr busley physicist
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:40.760]  joining us is they have new journal a pediatrics report out
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:46.760]  in confirmed cases of congenital uh hyperthyroidism in california
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:51.000]  as a function of environmental fallout from fukushima nuclear meltdown
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.400]  and dr busby says this is a big deal and we have other concerns over multiple
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:00.520]  illnesses forcing malibu uh high classroom shutdown three teachers
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:05.240]  getting cancer and the seals are dying not just in california but up in

[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:37.160]  ladies and gentlemen we're back live i want to get into this subject
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:41.080]  uh just because it's interesting and informative we know obama is basically a
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:46.680]  cia creation we know that obama's mother his father
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:52.360]  uh his grandfather all of them the multiple fathers the multiple names the
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:55.080]  sealed records we don't know who he really is
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:59.000]  he is an actor that reads off teleprompters that's undoubted
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  multiple different names very sitero the list goes on and on
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.160]  grandfather in the cia grandmother top foundations working for the geithner
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:13.240]  family very special person chosen for his mission
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:17.800]  and then actor linux harry linux
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:21.240]  goes on mancow show last week i'm no mancow like ten years i know when he's
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:24.040]  joking around when he's been serious he's totally serious
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.760]  linux when he's leaving goes listen don't think because i'm black that's the
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:30.440]  full conversation that i like obama he is a rat bastard
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:33.800]  traitor uh you know i basically taught him everything he knows
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:37.800]  practically lived with him on and on and on well linux got questioned after he
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.760]  gave a speech by a citizen blogger and he confirmed that i don't like obama
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:47.800]  it's confirmed he won't play obama because that would be linux
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:51.480]  playing someone that plays linux basically and if you listen to linux
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.640]  talk and the way he acts it's obama and so there is a major history there he
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:59.000]  doesn't deny that he says though those are not my words
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  in the interview so he's distancing himself he looks scared
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.680]  when it got brought up if somebody brought something up that wasn't true
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:10.280]  he wouldn't look scared and freaked out he looks seriously concerned
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:13.000]  we're not trying to get linux in trouble or anything because if you talk about
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.560]  about lord obama you'll never work in hollywood again
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:19.160]  uh as uh james woods and others have said
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:23.640]  we appreciate his courage it's on record hundreds of photos of him going back
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:28.520]  decades to the late 90s so we're talking 15 16 years or longer
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.560]  with obama at obama's house him and obama's house
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:34.920]  he said they lived by each other and practically lived together but he tried
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:39.400]  to back off of that but if you watch the video that's up on info wars.com
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:42.760]  it he looks pretty freaked out and confirms quite a bit of it
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:47.560]  and man cowl this morning because of this sent a photo of he and linux
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:50.680]  in studio plus there's video on local fox tv
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.440]  they simulcast his show three hours in the morning of linux on the show
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.960]  so linux went on the show was on local tv
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:02.360]  syndicating uh his syndicated radio show and there is the photo of them
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.080]  right before man cowl walked linux out uh at the end of the segment to the
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:10.600]  parking lot so there it is there's man cowl and linux
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:14.280]  last week just as man cowl said let's go to the video
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:18.040]  and the audio the citizen journalist shot here it is
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:22.040]  thank you
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:26.120]  i have a question about obama did obama train to be like you
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:36.920]  did you see that interview online it was fake
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:40.120]  i like i like the blacklist by the way i'm glad but was that interview bullshit
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.480]  or what was that all about that's that's people that's here saying
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.120]  somebody's saying something to somebody else but those were not my words
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:50.040]  okay but did obama train to be like you or is that not
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:55.080]  you have to ask him you saw him you guys have such similar mannerisms
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:58.840]  yeah well i knew him a long time ago okay so yeah but i so this
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:02.440]  so obama didn't literally train to be like you i don't know what you're really
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:06.120]  doing you know what i'm saying i don't okay no he's still on that's right
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:11.560]  yeah he's still on that yeah i'm sorry to upset over this question
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:15.000]  yeah um it was just such a mind-blowing interview
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.400]  like the guy said like i don't the world doesn't work like that in my opinion
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:23.480]  are you a reporter or something i'm an independent journalist kind of guy but
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:27.080]  i never said those words okay i mean if you want to
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:31.320]  i don't like barack obama so you could say but you know or his policies
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:35.000]  okay but i never said that i trained him or anything okay
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.920]  so so alex jones and that guy man cowl are they making that up or how are they
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.680]  man you know people hear what they want i have no idea i didn't hear the interview
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:46.840]  i heard about the interview but uh i have a lot of views on youtube and this and
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:50.360]  that yeah um but i'm a fan of the blacklist
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:54.200]  it's a pretty cool show and um what do you live with him was rock is he a
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:58.120]  trustworthy individual live with him oh you didn't live with him okay but you

[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.160]  we've had a big thing of lives i don't know what that main narrative is
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:15.560]  uh his books he went to college you know just the main narrative
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:19.800]  uh but he's not a trustworthy individual i didn't say that all i said is i
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:23.800]  don't like his policies okay you know thank you

[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.640]  that google or youtube can't just shut down
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:27.640]  the reason i have info wars dot com prisonplanet.com info wars net
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:31.160]  propaganda matrix dot com it's really paul watson's website
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:35.160]  we work with story leak dot com we work with other sites so they can't just
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:38.840]  shut me down and can't just shut us up because we've been
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:43.160]  hacked we've been attacked we've been shut down we've been censored all sorts
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.280]  of stuff's happened so i learned to not put all of our media
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:50.600]  operations in one basket that's why i've started info wars nightly news
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:53.080]  and tried to develop a group of reporters and people that understand
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:56.760]  what's happening and i've actually found smart dedicated good people who care
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:59.960]  about freedom and liberty and who are excited about journalism
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:04.040]  real journalism in many cases that do a better job than i can
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:07.160]  because i'm not in competition with other media people i want
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:11.480]  to build a future to resist folks so if i get put in prison for some setup
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:15.480]  reason or i get my head blown off or i die in a car wreck
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:20.200]  or struck by a bolt of lightning i intend for info wars to continue on
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:23.400]  i haven't quite gotten to that level yet where i think it would safely do that
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:27.400]  but we're getting close this is a serious situation
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:31.720]  ladies and gentlemen and it's for all the marbles i want my children
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:35.160]  to grow up in a free society not an enslaved society
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:40.760]  and no one could doubt we're going into one separately look at these articles
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:44.200]  dr buzzbee is on about this i wanted to get dr buzzbee on
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:47.560]  about removing the fuel rods the danger of that
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:51.080]  most scientists and engineers have said they'll probably will ignite some fuel
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:53.720]  rods when they're doing it because there's tens of thousands of them there'll
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:58.120]  be a huge explosion if there is the whole area is sinking
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:00.680]  because they've got to keep dumping water on it it just got hit by another
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:04.760]  typhoon another big earthquake i hope everything's okay
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:08.360]  because i don't want to have to move to the southern hemisphere
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:13.720]  i mean i morally cannot leave my children here
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:17.640]  when this is all going on if the radiation levels continue to go up much
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:21.240]  more i'll obviously stay behind while i try to see who wants to move to the
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:24.760]  southern hemisphere with me but i mean i can't believe i have to
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:28.440]  think about this i mean i'm really having to think about this
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:32.040]  i'm really having to deal with this okay and so i hope they can get it under
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:36.360]  control but regardless look at the new study that's out
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:43.000]  changes in confirmed plus borderline cases of congenital hyperthyroidism in
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.560]  california as function of environmental fallout
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:50.280]  from the fukushima nuclear meltdown the journal of pediatrics
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:59.000]  that is so incredibly important and yes that's the reason i was already
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.960]  planning to come out with a high quality supplement line but i dithered
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:04.280]  around you know trying to find out what the very best
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:06.680]  stuff was and then doing research for my own family
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:10.760]  of the cleanest purest best unbound nascent iodine to give my wife and
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:14.920]  children and myself i found this proprietary nascent
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:18.520]  iodine that no one even knew about i tried the other brands that couldn't
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:22.360]  hold them down and basically did research on it and found out that
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:27.000]  they break down over time this is proprietary this really is special
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.040]  it's double the strength at half the cost of leading competitors
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:33.560]  available at infowarslife.com or by calling toll free
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:40.760]  888-253-3139 and the thyroid other glands for my research and
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:44.440]  what i believe and what i'm doing for my family is that this is one of the things
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:49.320]  that i can do so that my these glands don't take in the isotopes
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:55.480]  that they will if my glands like my thyroid do not have enough of the
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:59.720]  quality iodine they're also on record detoxifies
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:03.640]  out the fluoride that's in your body but i will warn you about a month into this
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:07.640]  i i kind of had a heartburn and felt a little cruddy on top of having extra
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:10.280]  energy so it's kind of a best of times worst of times
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:13.800]  now i don't feel like that anymore and i just have accelerating clarity
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:18.040]  you name it but i've learned other things i do in my life
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:21.480]  that are toxic i've got to stop them i can't go out and drink a couple
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:25.480]  glasses of wine anymore with dinner i'm gonna just warn people up
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:28.200]  front that that once you start to detoxify your
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:33.160]  body's like uh uh you know no more and so it has had the
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:36.520]  effect of making me as mean as a rattlesnake
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:40.120]  sometimes because i'm just getting more and more clarity and more and more
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:43.800]  more and more aggression because that's what pharmacist ben fuchs said it would
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:46.120]  do is he said it would make me a manly man
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.000]  is it just does all this stuff reportedly to your other glands and the
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.040]  hormones and stuff and yes my muscles have gotten bigger
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:57.560]  i'm not even lifting weights folks and i feel like i'm 18 i mean i i just it's
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:00.520]  unbelievable uh i mean when i got my clothes off you know
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:04.120]  getting out of the shower or whatever i'm like wow i mean i'm scared to go lift
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.280]  weights because i don't want to look like you know uh
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.760]  brutus the beefcake or something uh i'm trying to lose weight and i have lost
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:14.040]  fat but it's just like but fuchs says that's what you're supposed to be like
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:17.800]  when you're natural and you know you know the way you are so it's just
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:21.320]  doing a lot for my glands and you know women that are on it it makes
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:24.600]  them more feminine from what i've seen personally again those are just my
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:30.840]  observations info warslife.com or 888-253-3139 and i'm
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:36.440]  done done plugging now thank you for your support you make the broadcast possible
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:41.560]  be sure and support our local am and fm affiliates out there
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:45.080]  be sure and support their local sponsors or become a local sponsor
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:48.760]  that is absolutely essential and always spread the word about the broadcast i
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:52.760]  want to go to your phone calls uh before i uh start the next
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:57.400]  hour and go to dr buzzby but just some of the other news that is so huge right
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:02.120]  now this is out of winet news it has the best boil down
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:07.880]  uh from the sunday times of london and i just couldn't imagine a story more
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:11.080]  important except for maybe fukushima
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:14.280]  and top economists like mark fauber coming out saying that the end of the
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:18.280]  capitalist economic system as we know it uh is coming
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:22.520]  because of the kleptocratic insiders setting up this tyranny
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:26.360]  but you read this article from winet news
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:30.600]  and the bbc is also reporting it nuclear weapons are being transferred to saudi
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:34.680]  arabia they're already there i already told you that you heard that here first
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:37.640]  i mean they're still debating whether israel has nuclear weapons
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:43.320]  they've got 800 nuclear weapons cruise missile icbm medium range delivered
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:49.160]  artillery delivered bomber delivered okay i mean israel is one of the most
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:53.800]  powerful nuclear powers in the world because they don't just have 800 war
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:58.760]  heads that's jane's weapons quarterly they've got some of the most high tech
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:03.320]  delivery systems and they're right in the middle of europe the
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:08.920]  middle east and russia israel is basically a giant
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:15.400]  51st state uh aircraft carrier loaded with weapons systems and troops and
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:19.080]  again i'm not against israel i want israel to do great
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:21.960]  we have a lot of great listeners in israel i get orders all the time from
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:26.520]  israel every day i mean we care about israel but we also care
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:30.280]  about iran and their people 70 plus percent hate the molas
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:36.360]  we we care about syria being attacked by al qaeda and shame on israel
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:40.760]  and shame on the us and shame on nato funding al qaeda to attack syria
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:45.160]  and say well the you know the enemy of my enemy is my friend no
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:49.000]  no it's immoral to start a war with syria who's doing nothing to anybody
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.840]  and try to take them down just so you can get it iran next it's
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:57.160]  unbelievable so again pakistan is building nuclear
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:01.880]  weapons for saudi arabia that's what the bbc is saying
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:08.600]  and uh that came out last week but now here it is back in the news
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:11.240]  they've already built them years ago they've already transferred them they're
[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:15.480]  just they're just a publicly threatening iran in case iran doesn't
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:21.080]  know but but here's the rest of story i was told five and a half six years
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:23.560]  ago by a high level military source that alex
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:26.600]  we're not going to be hitting iran or the military has anything to do with it
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:31.800]  they've got atomic weapons they've got missiles to deliver them
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:35.720]  and they are going to hit israel and then israel is going to hit them back and
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:40.440]  destroy their entire country and then russia and china are going
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:43.560]  to get involved and india will probably newt pakistan
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:46.760]  and and that's how this works okay and i've told you this hundreds of times
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:50.120]  about this in the last five and a half years
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:53.080]  then a couple years after that i talked to another source and they said yes
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:57.400]  that's the intel and that's why the pentagon does not want to hit iran
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:00.920]  because the mulas are crazy enough folks to fire
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:07.960]  atomic bombs on the heads of missiles at israel
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:11.960]  and it won't matter if they've got iron dome and shoot stuff down at ten
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:15.480]  thousand feet in the air the iranians will just have the nukes
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.200]  detonate at ten thousand feet that's one of the
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:21.160]  i mean that will absolutely blow everything out in israel all their
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:24.840]  electronics emp and will send a shock wave down
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:29.400]  depending on how powerful the weapon is that will probably kill tens of
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:32.280]  thousands of people if they don't stop it and it air
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:35.800]  burst at two thousand feet televivor jerusalem will be
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:41.400]  destroyed do you really want jerusalem hit by an atomic bomb
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:45.400]  the pentagon will attack whoever the new order tells them to they always have
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:49.640]  their war fighters though and they're going uh the computers and
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:52.760]  the analysts say this is probably gonna start start world war three uh
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:56.680]  i got a golf game coming up today uh i got grandkids
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:00.840]  it's one thing to suck america dry instead of a police state and all this
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:04.040]  stuff sure we'll go along with that
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:07.000]  because i live in a gated community you know that's their worldview
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.320]  we live in a gated community so so what but you're not insulated from war
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:15.640]  especially nuclear war and the russians have said this will probably
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:19.080]  cause a nuclear war back off in syria don't attack
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:24.920]  or we may nuke you and then and then the head of the joint chiefs went
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:29.560]  on the eve of the attack on syria and said don't do it
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:33.080]  and then obama started firing and removing generals and admirals
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:37.560]  because he didn't want them to be removed or fired or resigned over his
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:41.320]  military handling no they back off and then start getting them
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:44.280]  kicked out of there because they won't follow orders
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:48.600]  and then we start hearing oh iran's gonna nuke america
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:51.960]  the day we come out and report that nuclear weapons are missing
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:56.360]  by the way my cell phone is so tapped now that it just starts typing and sending
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:59.320]  people emails i don't even have an email account on there
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:03.400]  it starts just taking pictures it starts calling people people are on it i mean
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:07.640]  obviously elix Jones's cell phone is tapped but i mean i got to get rid of it now i
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:10.520]  guess i can't have a cell phone now
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:13.800]  um
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:18.280]  because they're literally on it all the time now
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:21.160]  and i can get another cell phone and then in two days
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:24.680]  whatever malware it is they put on it they're following me around again and
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:27.800]  it's on record they're doing it i mean this is so screwed up ladies and
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:31.400]  gentlemen that we're telling you about missing nuclear
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:37.160]  weapons from dais air force base and i'm the one with my phone tapped
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:41.480]  jp morgan chase goldman sacks they all have access to your nsa data
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:44.760]  the advertising hubs google is given the nsa data
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:49.560]  they co-house facilities with nasa and the nsa they're spying on everything we
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.160]  do in a giant criminal conspiracy against humanity
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:56.920]  and they're crazy and thank god the the military
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:01.880]  who i don't romanticize at the top has said no to starting world war three and
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:07.480]  so now israel and saudi arabia
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:13.880]  are saying okay okay if you have peace talks with iran
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:19.320]  that allow them to have nuclear reactors we're going to go ahead and hit them
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:22.200]  and by the way we've transferred nuclear weapons
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:25.880]  to saudi arabia and they're claiming pakistan did it
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:30.200]  i'm sure they did buy four weapons from pakistan that's what i was told a long
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:32.920]  time ago but i was also told they got it from russian
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:36.360]  elements and the israelis it's the israelis that are selling
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:40.200]  everything to china all our technology which the pentagon knows full wells
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:43.880]  going on so this is madness ladies and gentlemen
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:48.280]  and if i ran already has the nuclear weapons
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:53.080]  why then do you want to strike them if they put reactors online
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:56.280]  that is very hard to make atomic weapon material
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:59.560]  much less hydrogen weapon material from the physicists we've talked to out of
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:06.040]  that why on earth would you
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:11.320]  want to do this and and it's just ancient tribal warfare between these groups
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:14.920]  and the and the sunnis absolutely hate the shiites and vice versa
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:19.320]  and you see the saudi arabia is in a war saudi arabia in 1903
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:24.120]  through 1933 came from an area of less than a hundred square miles
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:30.280]  with a vicious bedouin lohavius tribe that literally had women in slave pits
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:33.240]  and then they took over all of what is saudi arabia today and then took over
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:37.640]  a bunch of other areas and now the west is backing them to take over the entire
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:42.440]  middle east look this up this is in
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:48.360]  encyclopedia britannica and now they're being given nuclear weapons
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:51.000]  by the way you know the saudi's will bring a bomb over here and blow it up
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.680]  and blame it on iran you know that they were deeply involved in 911
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:58.280]  but that's okay because they're so sweet there where al-qaeda comes from so

[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:46.360]  says obama lacks legal underpinning for obama care fix that's what nick
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:51.240]  ral said but you've also got the former head of the dnc
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:56.680]  uh coming out uh saying that they don't have the legal authority
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:55:00.360]  to do that outside of congress well did you get the memo whether it's shutting
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:03.080]  down cold power plants or putting our military under
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:09.400]  nato or um legalizing illegals obama acts as a
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:12.760]  dictator now and he'll probably leave office but it won't matter
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:19.000]  dictatorial powers will now be cemented in the office of the presidency
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.680]  kind of a big deal
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:28.680]  oh now cayenne west says he's passed obama feels used by the president
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:31.560]  when those type of uh trendy start jumping ship on you
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:36.600]  you know you are in deep deep you know what
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:40.120]  i'm telling you obama and his handlers though are the most dangerous now
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:43.560]  they could try to start a war anything right now to get them out of it we are
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:46.920]  at the moment of maximum danger and israel
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:52.920]  with saudi arabia as two buddies uh are are are threatening to basically nuke
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:57.960]  iran preemptively but that's not even a big news issue here in america
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:03.480]  no actually whatever cayenne west is up to is big news or whatever um

[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:26.760]  the only way i could describe it is i mean i feel a lot more energized
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:31.000]  and um but but i really want to uh get the word out today i mean i had so much
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.600]  i'd like to talk about but um i'd like to talk about the
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:42.200]  lister the liquid fluoride thorium reactor um it's way better than
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:46.920]  the water light water reactors that we have you know and pucus fema i mean it's
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:50.440]  yeah i'm no physicist i'm not a nuclear physicist but there are
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:55.000]  better forms of nuclear energy instead they're building more of the old designs
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.680]  that are so terrible and look i used to be a fan of nuclear power i used to buy
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:01.320]  the propaganda uh but now they just don't even
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:05.000]  maintenance the the the facilities properly and they're constantly
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.520]  having disasters and now they're covering them up so i say
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:12.120]  get rid of nuclear power i'm done with it
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:16.600]  yeah absolutely i mean it's totally terrible the only reason why we went
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:21.240]  with this uranium water based um light water
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:25.400]  solid fuel reactors because we military applications on submarines yep
[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:29.320]  exactly exactly the thorium reactor um
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:33.400]  what happens is they can't make bombs out of that that's why they didn't go with
[01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:35.560]  it but i'm not going to respond to your
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:38.120]  intellectual argument i think i think the word thorium
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:42.600]  sounded racist very racist anytime you encounter anything
[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:44.760]  intellectuals to say it's racist that makes you
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:47.800]  intellectually smarter i'm smarter than last color
[01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:51.000]  because i called him racist we'll be right back racist

[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:02.680]  and it ended up i recorded the conversation it ended up that
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:06.200]  they really don't have any guidelines it's pretty much up to their officer's
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:08.680]  discretion yeah and they're not even a sworn officer no no
[02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:11.160]  they're saying if they don't like the way you look

[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:25.400]  removing fuel rods from japan's tsunami battered fukushima nuclear plant
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:29.480]  if they touch one rod to another they explode and catch on fire
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:33.640]  many times worse than the last fukushima disaster that's still ongoing
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:38.120]  radioactive leaks found at 75 percent of nuke site's cbs news
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:41.800]  the numbers i've got from the international atomic energy agency
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:49.880]  is 91 percent are leaking 91 percent i'm going to ask
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:53.160]  dr busby nuclear and chemical physicists coming up
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:59.160]  exactly is it 75 or is it 91 doesn't really matter either way
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:02.120]  yeah yeah and of course the cbs articles two years old that's probably why they
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:05.880]  now say 91 the issue is they just don't care now if they're leaking
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:11.240]  it's just madness and then we have this new journal pediatrics
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:16.440]  paper out that babies are getting thyroid disorders and it's been connected
[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:20.760]  to the increased radioactive fallout from fukushima
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:24.440]  that blows right across into the west coast this is huge news

[02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:53.400]  looking at and the numbers in japan of the deaths
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:56.680]  and the numbers of the illnesses here in the united
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:00.760]  states so that is coming up here is some of the other big news i mentioned this
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:03.720]  last hour but if we have time later we'll play the clip
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:07.560]  democrat just representative says obama lacks
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:11.320]  legal underpinning for obama carefix nick
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:15.640]  rahal uh says that it's it's law the president can't
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:19.560]  change a law without going and changing the law but we don't need no stinking
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:23.720]  laws i mean we don't even need a congress we have nato to command our
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:26.840]  military now we have our supreme un leader
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:30.440]  so that's a big deal and also the supreme court blocks
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:35.560]  challenge to nsa phone tracking saying there is no fourth amendment
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:40.200]  chicago law professor claims no private senior emails as long as the content
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:46.120]  isn't used to detain or harass you 180 degrees different
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:50.120]  from the bill of rights constitution common sense also the bloody disaster of
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:54.440]  libya and iraq and afghanistan is laid bare
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:57.880]  the london guardian admits that the west intervention has turned these into
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:02.680]  deindustrialized nightmare hellholes and they're claiming it's an
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:05.400]  accident the west didn't know what they were doing
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:09.640]  this is the established policy is to turn the middle east
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:15.160]  north africa central asia into backward hellholes
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:19.400]  and block development that is the true mega racism
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:24.920]  against the oriental people that live in that area
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:28.600]  they even said the term oriental is racist now any any any any
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:33.640]  term is bad you know the average folks don't even know what the
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:37.240]  scientists would label the people that are there but it is a
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:43.800]  caucasoid oriental mixture with africans so it's a truly mixed group of
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:47.240]  people who are just human beings because we're all human beings
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:50.280]  and the west is exterminating them and using al qaeda to do it
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:54.600]  a tiny bedouin tribe that they've given all of saudi arabia to they created it
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:58.840]  made they're only into the second lineage now
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:05.800]  of the guy born in what 1880 who later by eight by 1933 was declared

[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:24.280]  now they're being given the entire middle east and north africa
[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:29.960]  and europe for that matter i mean this is a globalist bankster funded jihad
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:34.840]  using the most radical sect of islam a sub sect of sunni
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:38.440]  and by the way they kill the sunnis you know they don't sexually mutilate their
[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:41.480]  women that don't put bags on their heads and i never heard from wimpery saying

[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:06.840]  because of the political correctness ladies and gentlemen that's why they got

[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:49.800]  i mean i like men to stand up for liberating honor i just don't want to
[02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:53.800]  be around them but that's because i'm anti-male now
[02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:56.440]  no no i just actually have choices in my life
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:00.760]  okay i'm absolutely going crazy today her on air it it is just so incredibly
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:03.800]  frustrating to deal with all this i will do whatever hillary says when she's
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:07.080]  president i love women there there you go
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:10.440]  and and if we get a gay president i'll do whatever he says or she says
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:14.520]  or i'm anti-gay see how this mindlessness works
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:19.240]  how they just i just keep marveling at what oprah wimpery said i mean i've
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:22.200]  already played the clip yesterday so won't play it again it's up on inforworks.com
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:27.000]  to the bbc talking to a literal foppish pinhead moron
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:31.320]  political correct cult member and she's like you're a good creature like
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:34.760]  patting him on the head like he's a monkey or something
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:38.600]  and then she continues on to just say if you don't agree with obama
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:42.600]  you're racist and you need to die
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:45.720]  and he's literally just rubbing his hands together getting off on it because
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:49.480]  this is their authoritarianism she goes to eugenics meetings to depopulate
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:52.680]  africa folks she knows full well she's just up there dividing and
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:55.880]  conquering what a disgusting person
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:16:01.640]  what a disgusting race-baiting person i said i go to your calls let's go to
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:05.640]  cupcake cupcakes calling from fema region three
[02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:10.280]  what former state are you in that's in fema region three cupcake
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:18.120]  i'm in southern maryland i'm south of dc probably 20 miles uh from andrew's
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:22.040]  uh or whatever they're calling it i andrew's
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:28.360]  navy oh i i have no idea what they're calling but it sounds racist that that's
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:33.000]  what matters go ahead and and i actually i'm a
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  honest sign issue i about being by andrew's uh our
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:43.640]  phone cuts out every time we drive by there on 95
[02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:47.720]  every single time there's all sorts of interference all sorts of manipulation
[02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:51.880]  but their engineering will already have into all the new phones droid
[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:57.240]  or uh apple based where the police or the government hits one button and they
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:16:59.240]  can turn off every cell phone in the city
[02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:04.520]  physically turn them off or just block them recording audio or video
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:08.120]  all the kill switches obama and the globalists got their internet kill
[02:17:08.120 --> 02:17:11.800]  switch and they go oh congress wouldn't pass it
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:15.560]  no no it's true they didn't put in law that the kill switch can be there but
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:20.040]  they're doing it anyways because after all who needs a law you know
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:23.400]  right right um obama will take care of everything
[02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:26.440]  um please don't say he lied to you about keeping your health insurance
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:30.200]  or the premiums wouldn't go up they'd go down because if you say that you need to
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:35.160]  die questioning obama is because you're a racist
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:37.880]  yeah i'm a little fortunate because my husband is
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:42.920]  is union that doesn't mean we're losing it but we're losing a lot
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:46.840]  of coverage well that's right but that's uh and of course
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:49.720]  obama's talking about exempting the unions for now
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:52.920]  of course that's not discrimination against everybody else
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:56.440]  see there's thousands of new forms of discrimination
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:59.960]  that are actually all the ancient forms of it so they're making us
[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:03.480]  obsessed on the last forms of oppression instead of the
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:08.920]  old ones they're bringing back you see what i'm saying for we only recognize
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:13.480]  we only recognize the ones that they tell us about instead of recognizing
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:16.920]  all the stuff they're doing to all of us together
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:19.880]  right well i've been listening to you for about three years
[02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:25.240]  and i it's half the time i can keep up with you and half the time i have to
[02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:29.160]  listen again on that part well if you're a cupcake what type
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:33.320]  of icing do you have well you're so knowledgeable about everything and i
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:36.760]  and i like coconut cream ones you know they have the little bit of the cream
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:42.040]  on the top i don't like really sweet um uh icing that has a coconut on top
[02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:47.640]  right hey listen i've got a uh well it starts with
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:50.680]  families say you want to take your family
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:57.240]  uh out of state or whatever um now would you hire a plane or would you go
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:01.880]  on a regular airplane with your family at this point
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:05.960]  okay you know i'm sorry they were popping in my ear what was your question
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:09.480]  again uh going through tsa would you take your
[02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:14.680]  family uh through tsa on to an airline at this point
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:18.120]  no because they've been known to drag people off to the police facility and
[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:21.960]  kill them at the airport uh and in phoenix and other
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:25.080]  areas and my children have never flown
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:31.880]  because of the genitalia groping uh and uh once i was going through a border
[02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:35.800]  and they started grabbing on one of my daughters and i literally flipped out
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:39.960]  so i just cannot watch an obvious pito bear
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:45.240]  grab my children because i'm a terrorist show the answer is no um i would
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:47.800]  have gotten mad in nazi germany they pulled the train over sort of grabbing
[02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:51.160]  my daughters or my sons generals and that's because i'm a terrorist if you
[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:54.760]  don't support the nazis you're a racist terrorist so i support all of obama's
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:20:01.160]  nazi policies there i've given some fairness to the broadcast

[02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:17.320]  at re-engaging at a federal level because the state
[02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:20.520]  found him not guilty with the jury of his peers george zimmerman
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:24.040]  and i always said that i didn't lionize george zimmerman
[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:27.480]  i thought he was an idiot going out at night falling somewhere around with a
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:30.440]  gun but the witnesses did say that trayvon
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:33.880]  climbed on top of him and beat the daylights out of him and i think i might
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:36.280]  get mad if somebody comes around a corner with a gun at me
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:40.200]  i said it was a tragedy but being used to create racial division by the
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:43.320]  white house as a political diversion from
[02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:47.640]  the horrible things obama was doing with the wars the corporate welfare all of
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:52.040]  it well now george zimmerman has been arrested
[02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:55.960]  after disturbance call it was this just happened a few weeks ago
[02:24:55.960 --> 02:25:00.040]  former neighborhood watch volunteer george zimmerman was arrested
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:03.640]  monday in florida after deputies responded to a disturbance call at a
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:06.760]  house authority said zimmerman will be transported and
[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:10.440]  booked into jail and we don't know the specifics of it yet so we'll try to
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:13.960]  follow it now that's a total diversion over all the
[02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:17.320]  serious news we've got but it does show the type of people
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:20.680]  that don't need to be cops george zimmerman and others
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:24.360]  who are literally ready to pull a gun out at any moment and we've all seen the
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:26.280]  video i haven't really talked about it a lot
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:29.960]  of a tennessee woman with her kids in new mexico
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:34.920]  and uh you know people get mad when a cop pulls out a taser or a gun on a
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:40.280]  family and so the little kids get out start beating the cops up
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:45.720]  and and and then the cops panic and start shooting into a vehicle
[02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:50.520]  not the tires into the vehicle uh that they know full well has
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:56.520]  little kids in it uh and uh it's it's it's really creepy
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:26:00.520]  that this type of stuff's going on and i call it the george zimmerman syndrome
[02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:04.520]  but i don't lose my second amendment because people act like that
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:07.880]  and by the way statistically look look that's why i said the jury did not have
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:11.720]  enough evidence to convict just like they let
[02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:15.960]  uh oj simpson off oj was obviously guilty all the evidence
[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:19.560]  pointed there but you still had reasonable doubt
[02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:21.960]  reasonable doubt because the cops got caught lying
[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:25.000]  doesn't matter if he was guilty they tried to frame him after the fact
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.760]  with fake evidence he's got to go free better that 10 guilty men go free than
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:33.560]  one innocent man go to jail that's english common law american law
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:37.320]  comments the best law in the world you can say it it's bad it's not perfect
[02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:42.280]  but it is the best system still we've got saudi arabia and communist china
[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:46.040]  uh now and others on the un human rights board it's getting really bad
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:49.320]  i have to tell you how bad china and saudi arabia are
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:53.000]  to human rights now this is a short segment long segment coming up we're
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:56.600]  very thankful that he has been able to join us

[02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:23.080]  in fact he's very conservative to compare to some of the alarmists that are
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:27.240]  out there uh and he joins us now uh to give us a
[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:31.080]  little breakdown on what's coming up the next 18 minute
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:35.400]  segment a new and a peer-reviewed journal pediatrics report
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:41.000]  about uh increased problems in thyroid of babies children and others on the
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.320]  west coast and of course we have all the reports
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:47.160]  of the rising radiation levels and and governments raising what they say is
[02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:51.080]  cumulatively safe and the majority of reactors leaking
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:54.200]  so we're going to talk about that and the removal of the fuel rods
[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:58.200]  uh what's currently happening at fukushima as the as the the ground
[02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:02.600]  basically turns into a huge sinkhole uh dr busby uh thank you for joining us
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:05.640]  hello uh we got about two minutes tell us
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:09.400]  tell us what's coming up well two things really i i think you
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:12.680]  um you wanted me to talk about the worst-case scenario
[02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:16.360]  you know in other words if the whole of fukushima goes up with a big bang
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:19.480]  that's going to happen that's the first thing and the second thing is i'll
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:22.040]  talk about the new study that that we've done
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:25.880]  which shows that there were effects from the tiny amounts of
[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:29.720]  radiation that came to the united states from fukushima
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:33.320]  levels that were much lower than natural background radiation but actually had a
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:37.400]  significant effect on babies who were born in california
[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:41.400]  um so it just shows that all this stuff about natural background radiation as a
[02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:44.360]  yardstick for comparing the effects of ionizing
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:48.120]  radiation is just such not such a lot of nonsense
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:51.080]  and that's because sure the background only goes up a little bit but what
[02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:54.280]  happens if you get the concentrated particles that are
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:57.720]  radiating overall it's kind of like a light bulb a hundred yards away won't
[02:28:57.720 --> 02:29:00.760]  burn your hand and they go that's background radiation but when you
[02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:04.360]  grab it with your hand it starts burning you what happens if you breathe it or
[02:29:04.360 --> 02:29:07.160]  eat it well that's kind of it really uh and
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:11.400]  particularly um of course the babies in the womb are very very sensitive
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:15.240]  and there's been lots of research done recently that shows that that millions of
[02:29:15.240 --> 02:29:18.760]  babies have died in the womb as a result of really quite low levels of
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:23.000]  of internal radiation after these various accidents that have taken place
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:26.840]  um and of course after the weapons test fallout which is the biggest injection
[02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:30.920]  of radioactivity into the world environment that's ever occurred
[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:34.840]  and uh i'll talk a little bit about that too well dr buzzby you'll have the floor

[02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:05.880]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and
[02:30:05.880 --> 02:30:11.080]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around
[02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:13.880]  the world guess what else is in a halogen family

[02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:24.120]  did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good
[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:29.320]  halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented

[02:33:16.280 --> 02:33:19.560]  by the way going to break i said that dr christopher busby's a real
[02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:22.440]  environmentalist they're destroying the earth
[02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:26.920]  or dumping toxic waste everywhere open air genetic engineering that infects
[02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:30.680]  other families not even plants but but animal
[02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:34.760]  insect uh you name it it's all spreading
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:39.320]  in every major study the gmo is is just wreaking havoc on the reproductive
[02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:44.760]  systems of the animals that eat it uh 91 percent of reactors according to the
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:48.520]  u n are are are leaking they don't even care if they leak now the troops are
[02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:51.640]  allowed to use du in the last 20 years now they
[02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:55.240]  use it at regular shooting ranges and then meanwhile they've got this big
[02:33:55.240 --> 02:33:59.880]  corporate environmentalism that only wants to just be tax
[02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:03.880]  people's houses or energy consumption and things that really
[02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:08.600]  compared to all of the leaking radiation and the toxic waste and
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:12.760]  the genetic pollution that that that really is screwing things up i mean
[02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:17.400]  the honeybees really are dying uh the human cancers really are up multi
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:21.560]  thousand percentage points in the west i mean this is all real
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:23.880]  and if they came out when the government came out and said okay we're
[02:34:23.880 --> 02:34:27.720]  going to ban bpa for babies i was like yes ban it
[02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:31.960]  it's like real stuff real things instead of
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:35.160]  diverting into certain corporations like general electric
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:39.480]  being exempt from their plants being shut down or they go build plants in
[02:34:39.480 --> 02:34:43.240]  mexico and then shut down clean plants in texas and then run you know dirty
[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:46.680]  coal into the air it's folks these corporations have used the
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:50.440]  environmental movement to take over and then i see all the fake left from
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:55.640]  george mondia to you name it promoting nuclear now
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:34:59.960]  when i was somebody growing up bought into nuclear power propaganda
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:02.920]  bought into all of it and back then it looked like it was managed a little
[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:05.560]  bit better maybe maybe we're just more informed now
[02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:09.800]  and all the nuclear disasters they've covered up so now i see it as
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:12.920]  is there any form of safe nuclear power that's a question i'm gonna ask dr
[02:35:12.920 --> 02:35:15.640]  buzzby at the end of the interview in about 25 minutes but i want to give him
[02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:19.160]  the floor now because they're going to remove the fuel rods that started
[02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:23.320]  they're saying that could trigger a disaster we've got you know cover-ups
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:27.560]  of the yellow fin tuna having higher levels of
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:31.080]  radiation we've got this new study that he helped author
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:34.280]  that's in the peer review journal of pediatrics
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:39.160]  where you can read it on his site llrc.org we're going to link it up on
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:43.960]  info wars.com changes in confirmed plus borderline cases of
[02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:47.560]  congenital hyperthyroidism in california as a function of
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:53.160]  environmental fallout from the Fukushima nuclear meltdown so he joins us
[02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:57.240]  right now to talk about worst-case scenarios what's currently happening
[02:35:57.240 --> 02:36:00.840]  there with the ground sinking you've got the floor give us a
[02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:05.480]  presentation dr buzzby well let me start then with the
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:09.960]  the the the the congenital hyperthyroidism paper
[02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:14.120]  um because the important thing about that is it in a way
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:18.040]  it introduces us to the main problem in all of this
[02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:22.200]  um because what what we did this was my colleagues Joe Mangano
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:26.760]  and Janet Sherman of the radiation and public health project in new york
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:33.480]  um and and i we we studied the levels of thyroid stimulating hormone
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:38.120]  that are measured in in blood samples taken at birth in the state of california
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:42.680]  over the period of the Fukushima catastrophe
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:46.840]  now you all know that a small amount of radio iodine and it was a very small
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:51.240]  amount of radio iodine uh by the time it got across the 5000 miles
[02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:55.960]  from Fukushima to california to the west coast of the united states
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:36:59.960]  the concentrations were really quite small but nobody
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:04.440]  could be should be complacent uh because they were such small concentrations
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:07.880]  what happened at the time of course is that there was a big a lot of yelling
[02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:11.240]  and screaming about the fact that there was radio radioactive iodine
[02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:14.920]  131 measured in the milk and and the engineering
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:19.880]  department at the university of berkeley um measured i think between five and
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:25.080]  ten um becquerels per liter of radio iodine 131 in
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:29.320]  rainwater now from from that we it's fairly easy to
[02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:33.480]  work out roughly what the dose would be right iodine 131 has quite a short
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:38.040]  half-life about eight days and so really this event only occurred
[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:42.840]  over a period about 10 or 15 days so you can work out what the dose is to
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:45.800]  to adults assuming that they just drank rainwater
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:48.760]  well of course people don't drink rainwater do they they drink water from
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:52.920]  the tap or from bottles uh but anyway let's take the worst case and say
[02:37:52.920 --> 02:37:55.560]  that it was that they were only drinking rainwater
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:37:59.480]  the dose that they would have got is about one hundredth
[02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:03.480]  of natural background radiation the annual dose from natural background
[02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:07.000]  radiation so in other words it's a very very very small dose
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  um and by the time that it got down to the baby you know it would have been
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:14.680]  even smaller and yet what we discovered was that was there was a highly
[02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:18.680]  statistically significant increase in uh congenital
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:22.040]  hyperthyroid in confirmed congenital hyperthyroid
[02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:27.240]  cases in babies in california and in borderline cases about 27 percent
[02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:31.160]  now it may not sound very much it's about four hundred babies and and you know
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:34.760]  it's not a good thing that that happened but the most important thing in all of
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:39.080]  this in this paper is that once again we see
[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:43.800]  that the concept of dose is not valid for the measurement of
[02:38:43.800 --> 02:38:47.240]  inter for the quantification for the understanding
[02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:51.240]  of the health effects of internal radionuclides like radio iodine
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:54.120]  and like these particles that you were talking about
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:57.400]  which give a lot of dose to one little piece of the body
[02:38:57.400 --> 02:39:02.280]  and no dose at all to the rest so this concept again and again we see that this
[02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:06.040]  concept of absorbed dose when um is not valid
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:12.280]  whenever we see in in the news that there's been an accident um or that
[02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:15.000]  there's been some release of radioactivity somewhere
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:19.480]  then what happens is is the nuclear industry or the the scientists from the
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:23.880]  government and this is awful too because it's very very few real scientists
[02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:26.360]  left anyway these scientists will put that in inverted
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:30.920]  commerce scientists come out and they say oh well the dose is too low for it to
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:34.200]  cause you any harm um this is what they scream at
[02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:37.800]  any argument that says that we're being irradiated by all these
[02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:41.080]  substances which which first appeared on the planet
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:44.840]  in the 1950s with the weapons fallout and then increased
[02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:48.360]  increasingly were produced by nuclear power stations and accidents and so
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:51.880]  forth not you know and not not not not forgetting the
[02:39:51.880 --> 02:39:55.960]  depleted uranium that we're talking about so that the one message that we take
[02:39:55.960 --> 02:40:00.440]  home from this study is that the the concept of dose is
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:03.240]  invalid and and also the other thing that we went to
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:07.080]  at the end of this study was the increases in thyroid cancer
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:11.480]  which have been detected now in Fukushima so only three years after the
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:14.520]  accident we see an in a rapid increase in
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:19.880]  thyroid cancer in children aged 0 to 18 and i did a calculation on this
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:23.160]  which enables me to work out what the relative risk is you know that the
[02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:26.360]  percentage is higher than than what you would expect if there
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:30.600]  had been no no event and we get an 80 fold excess
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:33.640]  so there's an 80 times the numbers of thyroid cancers
[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:36.920]  that you would expect normally this is an enormous number
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:40.600]  but of course what's happening there is that these same scientists these tame
[02:40:40.600 --> 02:40:43.320]  scientists that work for the government or even the
[02:40:43.320 --> 02:40:46.920]  even in fact the scientists who measured the thyroid cancers who detected
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:50.600]  them in the screening they say well it can't be from Fukushima
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:54.600]  because the dose is too small so we live in a sort of Alice in Wonderland world
[02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:58.360]  or sort of like an airbrushed world which is much worse than the original
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:01.880]  Soviet Union way in which you know things were covered up because at the
[02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:05.240]  moment it's covered up in such a way there's utterly bizarre
[02:41:05.240 --> 02:41:09.000]  anyway that so that's the message from from the from the paper that
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:12.120]  that we've just published and let me just briefly tell listeners
[02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:15.640]  that physicist a chemical physicist Christopher Busby
[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:18.600]  joins us i want to back up what he's saying i'm not a chemical physicist or
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:22.440]  nuclear physicist who is a chemical physicist
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:27.960]  as well as a nuclear physicist is a doctor Doug Rocky who was the head of
[02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:33.320]  the entire Pentagon DU program in the 80s and 90s who wrote the book on it
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:36.360]  and did the the removal of the waste in Kuwait
[02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:41.720]  in Iraq most of his team has died he long before i even ever interviewed Dr
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:45.000]  Busby he would come on 10 years ago plus he said over 50 surgeries just to
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.560]  survive more surgeries than probably Darth Vader had
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:50.600]  fictionally and and he explains that he goes it's
[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:55.400]  asinine saying we could use DU they wouldn't let us use it until 1990
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:58.360]  because all the physicists even going back to the 50s said
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:02.520]  if you ingest it in your lungs or your kidneys it goes into the cell
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:07.080]  at point blank range and fries them and and they use the analogy basically of
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:10.200]  the light bulb a light bulb off at 100 yards doesn't burn you
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:12.840]  if you go up and grab it it will cook your hand
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:15.880]  and that's basically what's happening and then
[02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:19.160]  they've had other physicists that i've interviewed and other people
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:23.160]  you have explained this over and over again and so the system knows full well
[02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:25.720]  what they're doing because previous to
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:30.840]  really the 1990s there was an argument saying it's bad it's good it's okay
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:33.480]  now they just don't seem to care so let me ask you this and then get into the
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:37.480]  rest of it why doesn't the power structure seem to
[02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:41.880]  care anymore that they're living in increased radioactive poison
[02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:44.840]  well this is a very good question i don't really have an answer for it i mean
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:48.360]  because to me and to you and to any sensible person
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:51.800]  thinking about it of course what they're doing is is that
[02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:55.880]  they're they're destroying themselves and their children and
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:43:01.080]  all their relatives and and one has to ask how is it possible that they can do
[02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:03.720]  this i mean some of them are physicists and i have to say
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:06.920]  physicists seem to have the ability to deal in a sort of world of abstract
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:11.240]  mathematics and i think i i i i particularly single out
[02:43:11.240 --> 02:43:15.240]  physicists for the ability to believe something which is totally impossible
[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:18.840]  and and a lot and a lot of modern physics is like that and you will find
[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:22.280]  in governments that that the that the scientific advisors to governments are
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:25.640]  very often particle physicists and i think this goes back to the
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:29.000]  to the school days where where you know if you were a physicist or
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.400]  mathematician you were assumed to be cleverer than
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:34.840]  somebody who wasn't who was a chemist and then it goes down to biologists
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:38.440]  and after that it sort of goes down to geographers and then people who read
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:41.640]  english and history and so on all the way down to the bottom
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:45.160]  and so the problem is that these people have got the idea that because
[02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:48.280]  they can do mathematics and they can create these wondrous worlds of
[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:52.280]  equations including that the world of the equations
[02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:55.720]  that describe absorbed dose of course exactly that
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:43:59.400]  they don't need to know about biology in fact i've talked to them and they said
[02:43:59.400 --> 02:44:03.000]  well i don't know about biology if i need to know about biology
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:06.760]  i'll ask a biologist and of course if a biologist comes along saying i'm sorry
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:09.400]  mate but everybody's dying because you've got it wrong
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:12.920]  they will just say oh you're not a physicist and it goes on like that so
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:16.200]  that's one part of the equation the other part of course is that there are
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:19.720]  some genuinely evil people up there in my opinion
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:22.680]  i mean i've met some of them there are people who are up there for their own
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:25.720]  reasons you know because they make money or because they
[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:29.720]  they have a high position and because as prude on the anarchist once said
[02:44:29.720 --> 02:44:33.160]  if you put a man in uniform he becomes a monster
[02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:36.520]  and i think there are people like that i mean i can i can give you examples one
[02:44:36.520 --> 02:44:39.880]  good example is the head is the ex-head of the international commission on
[02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:43.960]  radiological protection who is now the head of
[02:44:43.960 --> 02:44:47.320]  of the medical system he's the head of the social security system in sweden
[02:44:47.320 --> 02:44:50.520]  man called Lars Eric Holm i mean he is very much
[02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:54.920]  you know i i think in my opinion he is uh individually responsible for the
[02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:58.920]  deaths of several million people and i you know we talk about Hitler
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:02.120]  we talk about Saddam Hussein and all these people who are like monsters you
[02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:06.520]  know within the concept of the historical description of monsters
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:09.800]  but actually a lot of these physicists who who have
[02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:13.480]  continued to underpin this particular system of absorbed dose
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:16.920]  are responsible for a lot more deaths than Hitler
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:21.080]  it's really incredible but but the way that dr rocky and others
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:24.760]  uh that we've interviewed a former head of the star wars program nuclear
[02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:28.520]  physicist engineer chemical physicist dr bob
[02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:32.840]  bowman just died a few months ago uh he said look of course
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:36.920]  there if people get hot particles they'll be the ones in the russian roulette
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:40.600]  that you know died 10 years after hypothetically he said look at
[02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:44.600]  look at uh what happened with Chernobyl we have metrics we can break down
[02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:48.040]  that the un says around a million plus people died from cancers
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:50.840]  as an effect of that and they took measures to not drink the milk from
[02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:54.440]  europe for a few years to not you know eat the vegetables in those areas to
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:58.040]  to import them now they don't even try to mitigate
[02:45:58.040 --> 02:46:02.280]  anything they just say it's fine don't even tell people the tuna is radio active
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:05.320]  that the milks had this problem or surface vegetables
[02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:10.680]  like spinach and things but he he was a physicist he described it he knew
[02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:15.480]  and and that's how dr rocky describes it he says look prior to 1990
[02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:19.320]  no one would use this but then they just said don't worry about it and then
[02:46:19.320 --> 02:46:21.560]  they would at least try to wear mask and gloves
[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:25.480]  now they don't wear mask and gloves when they use du i mean it really just
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:30.920]  shows a mass delusion uh a hyper nihilistic i don't even
[02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:34.040]  know what you call it but i don't want to waste any more time on that dr busby
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:38.600]  get into the removal of the rods the sinking i know it has a scientific
[02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:42.680]  name into a sinkhole of the Fukushima situation
[02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:46.920]  we've seen uh other physicists uh you know the fellow from canada
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:50.520]  you know came out and kind of did did a gestalt saying that if it
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:53.640]  does melt down it could you know really threaten humanity
[02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:56.760]  goodbye japan i think was the quote from Suzuki
[02:46:56.760 --> 02:47:00.760]  what is the worst case scenario okay right well i'll go to that before i do
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:04.600]  let me just say that that there is a bit of news on the on the du front which is
[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:09.560]  that increasingly i'm being contacted by gulf war veterans in the united kingdom
[02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:13.160]  who are now age about 40 and and there's a massive
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:16.440]  increase in cancer amongst those people so i mean just by the way that's now
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:19.720]  that's now feeding through into the system because of course as you say it
[02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:23.080]  takes several years you had 10 15 years before
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:28.360]  these particles create sufficient dose to the local tissue to to develop cancer
[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:31.880]  well now those years have passed and we're beginning to see the beginning of
[02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:36.680]  an epidemic there um anyway so so over to the to Fukushima
[02:47:36.680 --> 02:47:40.760]  right well i have seen on on the internet and
[02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:45.880]  and people have contacted me with with uh
[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:50.680]  amazing doom laden sort of prospects if the whole lot goes up
[02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:54.200]  and and and people have been asking me more and more to sort of get in there
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:57.000]  and have a look at it all and it's actually quite complicated and you've
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.520]  got to do lots and lots of sums and get all the numbers from all over the place
[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:03.640]  work it all out this you know i've been working on this off
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:07.240]  and on for about six weeks and eventually i figured it all out so now i'm
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:11.080]  going to present you with the answer and the answer is this that it's not the
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:14.360]  end of the world and it's and you know by no means is it the end of the world
[02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:18.440]  although it probably is the end of japan so that's that's the headline
[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:22.760]  um if the thing goes up and and uh what i mean now in my
[02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:27.960]  in my um what we call it worst-case scenario like the worst thing that
[02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:32.760]  could possibly happen is this that the that the reactor four tank
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:36.760]  um collapses in some way you know either it explodes because they stick two
[02:48:36.760 --> 02:48:40.600]  rods too too close together and there's an explosion which drives out all the
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:43.640]  water and then you know that once the water's gone it all
[02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:46.840]  melts down uh and then and then of course it distills
[02:48:46.840 --> 02:48:49.880]  off the plutonium and then there's a critical mass and there's an enormous
[02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:53.800]  bang so you get a fission explosion the alternative
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:58.120]  is that the the the thing is sitting as you said in a sort of swamp now
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:01.320]  and leaning and so and of course they know this too
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:05.400]  so so you know that that's why they're rapidly pulling all the all the spent
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:09.960]  fuel out of that that number four tank so if that collapsed um if it actually
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:12.200]  fell over then of course the water would all
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:16.360]  slosh out of the tank that there would be no cooling for half of the tank and
[02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:19.720]  then of course it would melt down the heat would increase it would boil off
[02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:23.480]  the water distill the plutonium and bang um and
[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:27.160]  then of course the third possibility is we have another typhoon which which so
[02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:31.080]  all of these things are possible ways in which we can get a large bang
[02:49:31.080 --> 02:49:34.680]  now let's assume the bang is big enough to also destroy
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:38.920]  the cooling to the other radiot to the other um reactors
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:43.560]  buildings uh pressure vessels so let's let's let's imagine that the whole lot
[02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:46.920]  goes up in some kind of massive dirty fission bomb
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:51.240]  now we have to we have to note here that that if it does explode it will be a
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:53.880]  fission bomb it's not going to be a hydrogen bomb there's going to be no
[02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:56.680]  megaton explosions the worst that can happen
[02:49:56.680 --> 02:50:00.200]  is that there's going to be some massive fission event
[02:50:00.200 --> 02:50:04.760]  now if that happens we know uh as a result of various studies that have
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:08.440]  been done exactly what's in there well not exactly but pretty much what's in
[02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:12.600]  there and we can add it all together and then we
[02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:17.160]  can compare it in terms of releases to all of the other
[02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:20.920]  events that people compare it to and i've done that so i mean i can give you
[02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:23.880]  lots and lots of numbers but but basically
[02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:27.560]  those numbers would wouldn't really mean anything so i what i've done it in
[02:50:27.560 --> 02:50:31.560]  what i've done is i've compared it in terms of two of the main
[02:50:31.560 --> 02:50:35.880]  radionuclides these are the the most the most dangerous ones and the ones that
[02:50:35.880 --> 02:50:41.800]  are usually used to to assess any any um event
[02:50:41.800 --> 02:50:46.360]  any of these you know um exposure events uh
[02:50:46.360 --> 02:50:51.080]  i've compared the strontium 90 and cesium 137 but the Hiroshima bomb
[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:54.600]  because that's one that everybody does and with the Fukushima
[02:50:54.600 --> 02:50:59.080]  that's already happened that's like if you like to call it Fukushima one
[02:50:59.080 --> 02:51:03.320]  and then with Chernobyl in 1986 and then and then of course and this is the
[02:51:03.320 --> 02:51:07.960]  big one with the atmospheric nuclear testing 1952 to 1980
[02:51:07.960 --> 02:51:11.320]  because what i conclude in all of this and i think i've said it before
[02:51:11.320 --> 02:51:14.840]  is that actually even if everything went up from from
[02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:19.480]  from um Fukushima it would still not be as much
[02:51:19.480 --> 02:51:23.080]  as the injection into the world environment the global environment from
[02:51:23.080 --> 02:51:26.120]  the from the combined atmospheric nuclear tests
[02:51:26.120 --> 02:51:29.960]  between 1952 and 1980 it comes to about 60 of them
[02:51:29.960 --> 02:51:34.040]  so if we take all of the radionuclides that came out in the in the atom bombs
[02:51:34.040 --> 02:51:39.160]  and the explosions that occurred in in in the Marshall Islands the
[02:51:39.160 --> 02:51:42.280]  United States Marshall Islands tests and then of course the
[02:51:42.280 --> 02:51:45.880]  British tests at Christmas Island and the French tests at Mureroa and in
[02:51:45.880 --> 02:51:49.000]  North Africa and then of course the enormously big
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:53.320]  Russian tests in Kazakhstan the Tsar Bomba which was 40 megatons
[02:51:53.320 --> 02:51:58.200]  these these tests blew an enormous amount of radio activity up into the
[02:51:58.200 --> 02:52:01.480]  stratosphere where it came pitter patter pitter patter down
[02:52:01.480 --> 02:52:07.640]  for the for the after about 1959 uh through to 1964 and the strontium 90
[02:52:07.640 --> 02:52:11.080]  built up in everybody's bones and the iodine went everywhere and the tritium
[02:52:11.080 --> 02:52:16.200]  increased and and carbon 14 increased and and
[02:52:16.200 --> 02:52:19.720]  Sakharov and Pauling both said that this would cause enormous increases in
[02:52:19.720 --> 02:52:24.840]  cancer which of course it has done and and so compared to that if the
[02:52:24.840 --> 02:52:27.960]  whole of Fukushima goes up it will only be about the
[02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:31.800]  same as that it's really less about half of it 60 percent so that so the total
[02:52:31.800 --> 02:52:35.080]  contents of Fukushima is about 60 percent of the total
[02:52:35.080 --> 02:52:38.520]  releases from the atmospheric tests but actually it'll be a lot less than
[02:52:38.520 --> 02:52:41.400]  that and the reason is that the atmospheric test blew all this stuff
[02:52:41.400 --> 02:52:45.880]  into the global environment with their enormous power
[02:52:45.880 --> 02:52:48.920]  but but this will be like a a fairly local
[02:52:48.920 --> 02:52:53.000]  fission bomb and so it will cause massive contamination of the local
[02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:56.840]  Pacific and and and catastrophic contamination of
[02:52:56.840 --> 02:53:00.360]  northern Japan of course I mean I worked out that the the mean
[02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:04.120]  concentration in the whole of northern Japan would be about 16 megabecca
[02:53:04.120 --> 02:53:08.680]  wells per square meter which would give you a dose of about
[02:53:08.680 --> 02:53:12.840]  what have I got here dose rate of 50 microcevas which is like
[02:53:12.840 --> 02:53:17.560]  and culture says that's good for you ah yes well he should go there if it
[02:53:17.560 --> 02:53:22.360]  happens there he should go ahead
[02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:25.880]  yes well I mean of course all that all that stuff is nonsense although there
[02:53:25.880 --> 02:53:29.400]  is to be honest with it there there is a certain element of truth in this
[02:53:29.400 --> 02:53:34.120]  Homesis idea you know if you if you do give if you do give mice a
[02:53:34.120 --> 02:53:37.800]  little bit of external radiation and I have to say it's external radiation
[02:53:37.800 --> 02:53:41.720]  that they're talking about um then what it does is it over a
[02:53:41.720 --> 02:53:45.560]  period of time it beefs up the repairs the repair systems in the cells
[02:53:45.560 --> 02:53:48.600]  slightly and and that's and that can be shown
[02:53:48.600 --> 02:53:52.440]  but of course the problem with internal radiation is it doesn't give a very
[02:53:52.440 --> 02:53:54.840]  small increase in dose to the cell give an enormous
[02:53:54.840 --> 02:53:59.560]  increase in dose to the cell I mean one alpha particle from um well to put
[02:53:59.560 --> 02:54:04.040]  this in perspective if you take uh if you take natural background
[02:54:04.040 --> 02:54:08.600]  radiation which everyone uses a yardstick we'll say that two millisieverts
[02:54:08.600 --> 02:54:14.040]  to go to this dose argument is the annual dose to a cell two millisieverts
[02:54:14.040 --> 02:54:18.200]  but if you get a single alpha particle track from a uranium particle to a cell
[02:54:18.200 --> 02:54:21.160]  it's 500 millisieverts and if it's actually a
[02:54:21.160 --> 02:54:24.120]  actually a particle sitting there not moving anywhere it's going to be
[02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:26.920]  banging away with more and more and more of these it's going to be like the
[02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:30.440]  first one is 500 millisieverts then it'll then it'll get another one so
[02:54:30.440 --> 02:54:34.280]  that's a thousand millisieverts and so on so for internal
[02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:37.880]  radiation like you know your argument about the light bulb
[02:54:37.880 --> 02:54:40.840]  the levels of actual dose to the cell are enormously high
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:44.360]  then they're very very much higher than these levels of natural background
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:47.720]  radiation we're talking about it's the it's the light bulb effect that you're
[02:54:47.720 --> 02:54:51.400]  talking about which is actually the problem and and also in terms of
[02:54:51.400 --> 02:54:55.240]  uranium of course it binds to dna so not only is it banging it
[02:54:55.240 --> 02:54:58.520]  banging the alpha particle into the cell but because it has an
[02:54:58.520 --> 02:55:02.440]  extraordinarily high chemical affinity for dna i was about to say that's what
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:06.440]  dr rocky said in the pentagon study some of its secret a lot of it public
[02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:10.600]  he said it's not just the radiation he said chemically it's an incredible
[02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:13.960]  poison that's right it is it is i mean nobody knows
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:18.360]  quite why it's a i mean well at least it what what doc what rocky is saying is
[02:55:18.360 --> 02:55:21.480]  that it's a chemical poison my own feeling is it's not so it's not a chemical
[02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:24.360]  poison it's a chemical radioactive poison so in other
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:28.920]  words it combines that it's chemistry it's chemical affinity for dna
[02:55:28.920 --> 02:55:32.600]  with its increased sure he's just saying it's incredibly toxic in his work
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:35.240]  yes yes well of course it is of course it is i mean
[02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:39.080]  the work that we've done in fallujah has shown the highest levels
[02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:43.800]  of of cancer that have ever been reported in any study anywhere
[02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:48.280]  i mean the levels of that's right that we were finding in fallujah well at 38
[02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:51.800]  times the expected number based on based on the background i was about to say
[02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:54.680]  even even like six seven years ago right after fallujah
[02:55:54.680 --> 02:55:57.800]  within a year they were talking about birth defects i think the headline was
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:02.120]  16 times the previous record that's right that's right it's
[02:56:02.120 --> 02:56:06.680]  it's it's it's a it's an absolute genetic damage catastrophe in in fallujah
[02:56:06.680 --> 02:56:09.880]  and nobody's doing anything about it what happened was that the world health
[02:56:09.880 --> 02:56:13.160]  organization produced some utterly bogus study which
[02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:16.040]  which actually showed that there were no effects there at all
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:20.680]  um which which i which i've attacked roundly in in in various
[02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:23.720]  various arguments in various media reports
[02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:27.640]  it's quite extraordinary and and people putting out the bowl know
[02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:31.560]  that their bowl won't protect them from radiation
[02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:35.240]  well we're back to that argument again aren't we we're back where i suppose i
[02:56:35.240 --> 02:56:38.360]  suppose you know and and the trouble is if you're an ordinary human being like
[02:56:38.360 --> 02:56:41.640]  you and me i've been i think maybe we are sort of a little bit more
[02:56:41.640 --> 02:56:44.760]  ordinary than these people that are allowing this to go on anyway
[02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:48.360]  you just can't understand it what happens is you just your mouth just drops
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:52.120]  open and you think well how is it and why is it that they continue to do this
[02:56:52.120 --> 02:56:55.480]  well i mean like i said some of them are not very nice people
[02:56:55.480 --> 02:56:58.840]  and some of them do it because they obtain power out of it and they'd rather
[02:56:58.840 --> 02:57:02.120]  have power than find about their children dying of leukemia
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:05.560]  um but the other ones that go along with it like sheep
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:09.240]  god goodness only knows why they do that they're just so domesticated shifting
[02:57:09.240 --> 02:57:13.080]  gears though uh just the argument against nuclear
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:16.520]  power now when you look at the response in fukushima
[02:57:16.520 --> 02:57:19.720]  or you look at how they respond here in southern california when the
[02:57:19.720 --> 02:57:23.400]  alarm goes off now they've just permanently turned the alarms off
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:26.680]  it just shows government at this stage with its management
[02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:30.760]  cannot be trusted with corporations to run nuclear power
[02:57:30.760 --> 02:57:34.600]  well i i i remember that uh don goffman said that the nuclear
[02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:39.160]  industry is waging a war against humanity but i would now put it further
[02:57:39.160 --> 02:57:43.720]  than that i would say that global science is waging a war against humanity
[02:57:43.720 --> 02:57:47.640]  i mean like you said before it's not just nuclear it's it's in every single area
[02:57:47.640 --> 02:57:51.640]  where scientific developments can be made can be used to make money
[02:57:51.640 --> 02:57:55.640]  for the monster that has now become global cap global capitalism
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:57:59.880]  um people just turn a complete blind eye to any any effects on
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:04.520]  on human life and just march on steadily with the production of substances
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:07.480]  which they release to the environment which kill people
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:10.600]  sounds like the legend of atlantis whether it was true or not
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:13.960]  they created some technology that blew up their island
[02:58:13.960 --> 02:58:17.320]  yes well it does look like we're doing that doctor let me do five more minutes
[02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:19.080]  i know you've got to go we're gonna do some overdrive i want you to have
[02:58:19.080 --> 02:58:22.920]  closing comments and talk about what we do is there any safe
[02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:27.480]  atomic or nuclear power what do we do with all these 35 40 year old aging
[02:58:27.480 --> 02:58:32.440]  things everywhere leaking and what do we do because i've got children
[02:58:32.440 --> 02:58:35.400]  i don't want to die a cancer young i don't want to die period this is really
[02:58:35.400 --> 02:58:42.840]  scary we're gonna be back in 60 seconds with dr busby stay with us
[02:58:42.840 --> 02:58:51.720]  thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today
[02:58:51.720 --> 02:58:55.480]  i had tried everything i'd cut back the amount of food i was eating i was
[02:58:55.480 --> 02:58:58.360]  lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working
[02:58:58.360 --> 02:59:02.280]  my body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as
[02:59:02.280 --> 02:59:06.520]  key vitamins and as soon as i had that i immediately could eat
[02:59:06.520 --> 02:59:11.080]  half of what i was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of
[02:59:11.080 --> 02:59:15.080]  great products at info wars team dot com but i want to point out the three
[02:59:15.080 --> 02:59:22.040]  that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months products like
[02:59:22.040 --> 02:59:26.280]  beyond tangy tangerine holland burst and rebound when i started
[02:59:26.280 --> 02:59:29.960]  taking the tangy tangerine and other products every day i lost more than
[02:59:29.960 --> 02:59:33.560]  37 pounds in just two months now that's results
[02:59:33.560 --> 02:59:37.960]  i want to challenge my listeners to go to info wars team dot com
[02:59:37.960 --> 02:59:41.960]  and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes
[02:59:41.960 --> 02:59:46.120]  in the way you look feel and in your appetite almost immediately
[02:59:46.120 --> 02:59:52.280]  start your journey to health and wellness today info wars team dot com
[02:59:52.280 --> 02:59:57.880]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones
[02:59:57.880 --> 03:00:05.960]  broadcasting network network
[03:00:06.040 --> 03:00:10.840]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[03:00:10.840 --> 03:00:18.120]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[03:00:18.120 --> 03:00:26.840]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[03:00:26.840 --> 03:00:30.840]  all right final segment with dr buzzby
[03:00:30.840 --> 03:00:33.320]  i'm going to continue on with some overdrive in the next segment to go to
[03:00:33.320 --> 03:00:38.040]  julio listening on 15 30 a.m in chicago ramon
[03:00:38.040 --> 03:00:43.640]  and tanner and rose and mercedes and everybody else that's patiently holding
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:46.520]  dr buzzby we only got about four or five minutes in the short segment
[03:00:46.520 --> 03:00:50.040]  folks can go see your studies and the other mainline studies you're linked to
[03:00:50.040 --> 03:00:55.080]  at l l r c dot org green audit dot org and
[03:00:55.080 --> 03:00:58.760]  hopefully find out about what's happening but you heard my question is
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:02.840]  there any form of safe atomic or nuclear power
[03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:06.840]  no there isn't it's not possible to constrain the atom
[03:01:06.840 --> 03:01:09.560]  it's not possible to do anything with the atom
[03:01:09.560 --> 03:01:13.960]  that that that that is safe enough that that is that that prevents
[03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:17.560]  releases of these radionuclides and all of these read radionuclides
[03:01:17.560 --> 03:01:21.880]  have significant harmful effects at very very low concentrations
[03:01:21.880 --> 03:01:26.360]  so the answer is no you can't do that and i should say one thing before in the
[03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:29.480]  little time i've got left is that in terms of fukushima people in the
[03:01:29.480 --> 03:01:33.240]  united states their attention is in the wrong places
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:36.280]  they're concerned about the concentrations of radionuclides in
[03:01:36.280 --> 03:01:39.160]  in pacific tuna which are very very low really
[03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:42.520]  much lower than the levels for instance in europe in the in herring in the
[03:01:42.520 --> 03:01:46.840]  Baltic sea which is we have levels of 50 becaros per kilogram in herring in the
[03:01:46.840 --> 03:01:51.080]  Baltic sea so i'm first earlier i reassured everybody
[03:01:51.080 --> 03:01:53.960]  about what would happen if that mean well not people in japan but
[03:01:53.960 --> 03:01:57.000]  but you know people in the united states if it all went up
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:00.280]  but the people in the united states have have their own problems and the
[03:02:00.280 --> 03:02:03.960]  dangers there are much greater from the local nucleus i was about to say now
[03:02:03.960 --> 03:02:07.240]  whenever they have a leak or a problem they don't even tell you
[03:02:07.240 --> 03:02:11.240]  no that's right and and and so if you're worried about radioactivity and fish you
[03:02:11.240 --> 03:02:13.960]  want to worry about the fish that swim in the river
[03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:17.480]  which is fed water by the nuclear reactor near you
[03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:21.640]  because a map that i've seen of the united states with nuclear reactors
[03:02:21.640 --> 03:02:24.760]  is like like somebody's thrown a lot of darts at it they're an awful lot of
[03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:28.040]  nuclear reactors and they're all very old and they're all falling to pieces and
[03:02:28.040 --> 03:02:30.840]  they're all leaking like sieves and it's all going into the ground
[03:02:30.840 --> 03:02:34.040]  and it's all going into your food and your water what about the number that i
[03:02:34.040 --> 03:02:39.320]  see of 91 cbs news says 75 of reactors are leaking
[03:02:39.320 --> 03:02:42.600]  well what's the real number from your research i would think a hundred percent
[03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:46.600]  is the number that are leaking it's it's absolutely not possible to
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:49.720]  function with a nuclear power station without it leaking can't be done that's
[03:02:49.720 --> 03:02:53.080]  what i was told by captain don darling is the head of veterans for peace here in
[03:02:53.080 --> 03:02:56.760]  austin he was on nuclear submarines as a captain and then ran the famous
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:01.720]  super submersible rescue subs and he said they're all a bunch of
[03:03:01.720 --> 03:03:04.600]  liars he said they would have them do tests where they turn the reactor on and
[03:03:04.600 --> 03:03:07.640]  off frying everyone on board uh he's had
[03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:10.200]  incredible health problems i mean he just he just concurs with what you're
[03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:13.640]  saying of course the problem is that you know you it's like being stabbed and
[03:03:13.640 --> 03:03:16.680]  then you die 10 years later so it's very difficult for you to actually
[03:03:16.680 --> 03:03:20.280]  take any case on this or or actually do anything about it and the stuff is
[03:03:20.280 --> 03:03:23.080]  invisible so unless you have all sorts of radiation
[03:03:23.080 --> 03:03:27.080]  measuring equipment the best that you can do is just get out of the way of any
[03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:31.560]  nuclear power station or anything to do with it just just run away
[03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:34.520]  um and i've got even then you're not safe because of course you've got all the
[03:03:34.520 --> 03:03:37.880]  fallout from the weapons i mean people living in marin county california of
[03:03:37.880 --> 03:03:41.880]  course you know for example have a very high level of breast cancer because of
[03:03:41.880 --> 03:03:45.000]  all the fallout that landed in the rockies after the nevada test and then
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:49.160]  washed on down into san francisco bay so you know you need to know what's going
[03:03:49.160 --> 03:03:52.280]  on here and you need to be aware that you're all being
[03:03:52.280 --> 03:03:56.200]  irradiated the whole time until you stop these people from continuing to release
[03:03:56.200 --> 03:03:58.520]  these substances and of course now they're talking about not even
[03:03:58.520 --> 03:04:02.520]  mothballing 40 year old facilities and letting them go 50 60
[03:04:02.520 --> 03:04:06.200]  those are guaranteed to blow up well of course of course they're just trying to
[03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:09.480]  make money it's all about money isn't it alec that's what it's about keep the
[03:04:09.480 --> 03:04:12.680]  things going because you can make more money out of it
[03:04:12.680 --> 03:04:16.200]  well i mean what can we do what can we say i mean it's a political issue and
[03:04:16.200 --> 03:04:19.480]  until you can sort out the political situation and have people that you can
[03:04:19.480 --> 03:04:23.720]  trust you know they're building more reactors even after that
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:27.640]  i mean if you go by monday yacht if one blows up in the u.s or france they'll
[03:04:27.640 --> 03:04:31.320]  say build more it's like yes i know i know but monday
[03:04:31.320 --> 03:04:36.440]  monday is a fool i mean nobody takes any notice of him and in his attacks on us
[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:41.160]  and his his advocate advocating new nuclear power stations he's totally shot
[03:04:41.160 --> 03:04:43.480]  himself in the foot nobody listens to him anymore
[03:04:43.480 --> 03:04:47.800]  llrc.org dr busby thank you so much for your time

[03:05:14.280 --> 03:05:18.200]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924

[03:05:22.440 --> 03:05:26.200]  add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic

[03:08:16.040 --> 03:08:18.840]  he was supposedly america the freest people in the world everything was going
[03:08:18.840 --> 03:08:22.840]  to be fine then the folks that didn't want us involved
[03:08:22.840 --> 03:08:26.200]  trying to make a better world began to demonize anybody who was informed
[03:08:26.200 --> 03:08:30.680]  anybody was involved so even more people shut up and went away
[03:08:30.680 --> 03:08:34.920]  you know if you exposed the government killed kennedy they'd kill you
[03:08:34.920 --> 03:08:38.760]  and now we're seeing a reawakening of sanity of common sense i mean even
[03:08:38.760 --> 03:08:42.120]  mainstream media faced with dropping ratings and everyone
[03:08:42.120 --> 03:08:45.960]  deserting them do things like grill pelosi david
[03:08:45.960 --> 03:08:48.840]  regary did and he's a big insider with the white house
[03:08:48.840 --> 03:08:52.200]  his kids go to school with the presidents he had to grill her and say
[03:08:52.200 --> 03:08:56.360]  she was full of prunes as dan rather would say
[03:08:56.360 --> 03:09:00.840]  uh over saying that obama cares a great deal
[03:09:00.840 --> 03:09:04.040]  and the fact that she's criticizing democrats that are trying to repeal it
[03:09:04.040 --> 03:09:07.000]  even the new york times has come out and said we can repeal this
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:10.760]  let's repeal it the problem is the special interest whatever they come up
[03:09:10.760 --> 03:09:15.240]  with will be a screwed job on top of that until we admit we're in trouble and
[03:09:15.240 --> 03:09:18.520]  have criminals running things
[03:09:18.520 --> 03:09:22.040]  i don't want to go into a rant about health care but
[03:09:22.040 --> 03:09:25.480]  i've studied it you can look it up it was hands down we had the best
[03:09:25.480 --> 03:09:29.400]  cheapest health care that's how it works the least expensive
[03:09:29.400 --> 03:09:33.240]  the most competitive best in the world until
[03:09:33.240 --> 03:09:37.880]  the mid 1960s and then government got involved with regulations
[03:09:37.880 --> 03:09:40.840]  and and special interest in big hospitals wanted to shut down their
[03:09:40.840 --> 03:09:43.720]  competition and shut down treatments and things
[03:09:43.720 --> 03:09:47.320]  look fake treatments quack science gets phased out real quick
[03:09:47.320 --> 03:09:52.360]  just by word of mouth in the market but you got a bunch of government and hmo's
[03:09:52.360 --> 03:09:55.160]  and insurance companies wanting to fix things and wanting to get
[03:09:55.160 --> 03:09:58.200]  government to regulate so they could charge you way more and control the
[03:09:58.200 --> 03:10:02.200]  treatment you got and now the market's gone and now we
[03:10:02.200 --> 03:10:05.400]  have a total screw job i'm gonna go to your phone
[03:10:05.400 --> 03:10:11.320]  calls as promised uh it's just that we've got to get rid
[03:10:11.320 --> 03:10:17.320]  of this health care system and the old one we had in the last 40 years is bad
[03:10:17.320 --> 03:10:20.760]  and corrupt as well uh it's just that we've got a broken
[03:10:20.760 --> 03:10:25.080]  system by design it isn't broken for the one tenth of one percent
[03:10:25.080 --> 03:10:28.840]  that are crony capitalist anti-free market you can go to the articles that
[03:10:28.840 --> 03:10:31.880]  are on dredgerport.com we ought to write a story about this in more detail
[03:10:31.880 --> 03:10:36.040]  dc now fastest growing region of one percenters in the country yeah it's a
[03:10:36.040 --> 03:10:39.480]  cancer overtakes new york los angeles
[03:10:39.480 --> 03:10:44.040]  income gap widens and again this ultra rich are the ones saying get rid of the
[03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:47.000]  middle class and the new rich that actually make their money if you're
[03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:51.000]  actually a real company that innovates, hires people, builds an economy
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:57.080]  oh now you are a dirty rotten nasty rich person you know that's that's got 500
[03:10:57.080 --> 03:11:00.040]  employees but when you're big general electric
[03:11:00.040 --> 03:11:03.480]  you're tax exempt it's just it's very simple folks
[03:11:03.480 --> 03:11:06.280]  and they've got all these people wondering why they're getting poor the
[03:11:06.280 --> 03:11:09.160]  media is telling them it's because that guy lives in a mansion down the street
[03:11:09.160 --> 03:11:12.920]  really the guy that buys cars the guy that has employees
[03:11:12.920 --> 03:11:16.360]  the guy that has the insurance the guy that goes to the restaurants whose wife
[03:11:16.360 --> 03:11:21.160]  gets their hair done who gives money to the charities
[03:11:21.160 --> 03:11:25.080]  and as they get rid of the middle class folks the charities are going to go away
[03:11:25.080 --> 03:11:29.640]  this is economic conquest this is getting rid of the middle class the first
[03:11:29.640 --> 03:11:33.080]  thing communists do but this isn't communism this is bankers
[03:11:33.080 --> 03:11:36.440]  using the model of communism because they're offshore and exempt to shut us
[03:11:36.440 --> 03:11:39.320]  down and i know i say that every show in different ways but
[03:11:39.320 --> 03:11:47.800]  that's the key key key key key what made america great was people admired
[03:11:47.800 --> 03:11:53.480]  business people that invented a cotton gin or you know why slavery really
[03:11:53.480 --> 03:11:56.600]  started to get phased out and sharecropping in the united states
[03:11:56.600 --> 03:12:00.040]  there were more white slaves than even black slaves and black slaves probably
[03:12:00.040 --> 03:12:02.520]  had a little bit worse than the so-called white slaves but
[03:12:02.520 --> 03:12:06.280]  the point was it was slavery all around for most people the cotton gin came
[03:12:06.280 --> 03:12:08.680]  along and well now you had a machine that could sort
[03:12:08.680 --> 03:12:12.360]  through and get the seeds out and people weren't as valuable anymore
[03:12:12.360 --> 03:12:15.960]  and so then they went off in other parts of the economy grew but i don't want to
[03:12:15.960 --> 03:12:19.160]  go off into an economic discussion here with everybody
[03:12:19.160 --> 03:12:22.440]  the issue here ladies and gentlemen is innovation
[03:12:22.440 --> 03:12:27.160]  is what is going to empower us and the globalist are against innovation
[03:12:27.160 --> 03:12:31.160]  instead the the only innovation they allow is their innovation
[03:12:31.160 --> 03:12:34.360]  which is like GMO crops that should be outlawed immediately
[03:12:34.360 --> 03:12:38.440]  and i don't mean hybridizing two squash plants to get a better you know i mean
[03:12:38.440 --> 03:12:42.040]  stacking 10 15 genetic traits in there
[03:12:42.040 --> 03:12:45.320]  where three generations later it mutates and puts out a toxin and they don't
[03:12:45.320 --> 03:12:47.400]  care and just keep putting it on the store shelves
[03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:52.200]  like bt corn all right i'm done i'm done just very briefly
[03:12:52.200 --> 03:12:56.920]  you heard dr buzzbee about the reactors leaking the u n says 91 percent are
[03:12:56.920 --> 03:12:59.240]  leaking he says they're all leaking all i know is
[03:12:59.240 --> 03:13:02.760]  they've turned the alarms off all over the country they don't even talk about
[03:13:02.760 --> 03:13:05.880]  problems now when they happen and they tell people that work in them
[03:13:05.880 --> 03:13:09.160]  everything's fine and then in canada they're forced to report on like every
[03:13:09.160 --> 03:13:13.400]  week you hear about one you know off-gassing you know 100 million
[03:13:13.400 --> 03:13:16.680]  whatever is into the water and the thousands of gallons of you know
[03:13:16.680 --> 03:13:20.600]  radiation released and all this other garbage i mean this is crazy
[03:13:20.600 --> 03:13:24.360]  this is crazy and what i do and it's not perfect but from my research and what
[03:13:24.360 --> 03:13:27.960]  the doctors have told me true pure unbound nascent iodine
[03:13:27.960 --> 03:13:31.640]  and a glycerin base is the best way to go so we found the best survival shield
[03:13:31.640 --> 03:13:35.320]  info wars live com info wars live com are called
[03:13:35.320 --> 03:13:42.760]  told free 888-25-33139 888-25-33139 and that's how we
[03:13:42.760 --> 03:13:46.040]  build this operation it's my goal to bring in the very best
[03:13:46.040 --> 03:13:49.960]  products out there to then have excess funds
[03:13:49.960 --> 03:13:53.960]  to build a better media operation to hire more people and pay our great crew
[03:13:53.960 --> 03:13:56.600]  better and really have a first-rate operation where we can have
[03:13:56.600 --> 03:13:59.560]  reporters all over the country and then finally all over the world
[03:13:59.560 --> 03:14:03.240]  but we have to do that by the funding so we we do it via
[03:14:03.240 --> 03:14:07.160]  info wars live com and for store.com okay let's go to
[03:14:07.160 --> 03:14:11.240]  Ramon in florida thanks for holding her on the air
[03:14:11.240 --> 03:14:14.840]  what's going on Alice you know down here female reason sticks
[03:14:14.840 --> 03:14:18.440]  still trucking off for the truth movement every day but uh you should take
[03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:22.120]  one day out of out of every week that's just ramp man that's some of your best
[03:14:22.120 --> 03:14:25.160]  stuff i don't remember if you i don't know if you remember the
[03:14:25.160 --> 03:14:29.400]  Magellan is cooler than Justin Bieber rant but it's probably a hundred million
[03:14:29.400 --> 03:14:33.080]  views strong on uh on youtube man it's awesome
[03:14:33.080 --> 03:14:36.200]  you know there are a lot of versions of that millions of views that i know and
[03:14:36.200 --> 03:14:40.920]  people like that Justin Bieber rant i mispronounced his name on purpose
[03:14:40.920 --> 03:14:44.760]  uh and i mean you know Justin Bieber i mean look at it he's got all that money
[03:14:44.760 --> 03:14:49.960]  all that fame and he's totally unhappy walking around wearing diaper pants
[03:14:49.960 --> 03:14:55.080]  and uh it's just very very sad that the system can make him our idol
[03:14:55.080 --> 03:14:58.600]  instead of somebody like Magellan but you can say whatever you want about Magellan
[03:14:58.600 --> 03:15:03.560]  that guy was incredible yeah he circumnavigated the globe we
[03:15:03.560 --> 03:15:07.640]  we all know we give everybody props what props does do man we've spoken a few
[03:15:07.640 --> 03:15:10.440]  times and i always let you know i'm down here in Miami
[03:15:10.440 --> 03:15:14.200]  and one of the you know pretty one of the pre-run down neighborhoods
[03:15:14.200 --> 03:15:18.120]  pretty much like this lower income or public assistance
[03:15:18.120 --> 03:15:22.120]  but we're starting to wake up you know day to day we're just going to help an
[03:15:22.120 --> 03:15:26.040]  elderly people understand about nason iodine and what it can do for
[03:15:26.040 --> 03:15:29.880]  radiation or a lot of other things on infowarsteam.com
[03:15:29.880 --> 03:15:32.680]  and we're not getting paid for it we're getting paid
[03:15:32.680 --> 03:15:36.360]  through our soul we understand that by helping one another it'll help
[03:15:36.360 --> 03:15:40.680]  our children i'm here with my family my you know my girl raising
[03:15:40.680 --> 03:15:45.400]  uh 17 month old unvaccinated very healthy beautiful baby girl
[03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:49.880]  awesome a lot of the implement yeah and that's why people like you know the
[03:15:49.880 --> 03:15:53.800]  caller a few before me tried to let you know that we appreciate it it's not
[03:15:53.800 --> 03:15:57.480]  that you're doing anything that we can do ourselves is that you're brave enough
[03:15:57.480 --> 03:16:00.200]  to do it a lot of people know the information but
[03:16:00.200 --> 03:16:04.040]  understand the repercussions that come with letting other people know but we
[03:16:04.040 --> 03:16:07.880]  know that without standing up our children have no future
[03:16:07.880 --> 03:16:11.720]  so we're doing everything we need to do to just bring the information to
[03:16:11.720 --> 03:16:15.160]  probably the people that needed the most of the lower income you know you tend
[03:16:15.160 --> 03:16:18.680]  to think about them as you know just not so smart
[03:16:18.680 --> 03:16:22.440]  but i don't think of people like that you can find some of the smartest people
[03:16:22.440 --> 03:16:25.880]  in low income areas you can find some of the dumbest in the rich areas
[03:16:25.880 --> 03:16:29.160]  i find that people have a soul and an intellect and a love of liberty
[03:16:29.160 --> 03:16:33.080]  then then then they can be fully woken up and they want to make us all poor
[03:16:33.080 --> 03:16:37.320]  and all dependent that's the game and and sure people could point their finger
[03:16:37.320 --> 03:16:41.080]  50 years ago it may be five percent of the population on assistance now it's
[03:16:41.080 --> 03:16:45.400]  half i mean this is fundamentally a plan god bless you good to hear from you
[03:16:45.400 --> 03:16:50.120]  julio in illinois listening on 15 30 a.m go ahead julio
[03:16:50.120 --> 03:16:54.440]  uh hello alex first off uh prayers all those in central illinois
[03:16:54.440 --> 03:16:57.880]  uh after yesterday's that devastating storms that's uh
[03:16:57.880 --> 03:17:01.480]  you know thoughts and prayers go out to them um so much so much stuff going on
[03:17:01.480 --> 03:17:05.160]  alex it's crazy to see everything happening so fast
[03:17:05.160 --> 03:17:08.600]  although we kind of expected expected it to happen so fast
[03:17:08.600 --> 03:17:12.280]  uh your article or paul watson's article that made it to
[03:17:12.280 --> 03:17:15.640]  george report about the tsa i'm reading something very fascinating
[03:17:15.640 --> 03:17:18.760]  that came out uh i think a couple days ago from the
[03:17:18.760 --> 03:17:23.080]  gao talking about aviation security and how
[03:17:23.080 --> 03:17:26.760]  the document headline is tsa should limit future funding
[03:17:26.760 --> 03:17:30.920]  for behavior detection detection activities goes into how
[03:17:30.920 --> 03:17:36.600]  tsa spot program is basically a waste of money spot is screening of passengers
[03:17:36.600 --> 03:17:40.520]  by observation techniques tsa is set to uh
[03:17:40.520 --> 03:17:44.360]  ask for about five billion dollars or about three billion dollars excuse me
[03:17:44.360 --> 03:17:47.480]  for uh 2014 and basically the gao is saying
[03:17:47.480 --> 03:17:51.000]  all their practices are a joke now on top of that
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:54.840]  i'm reading a document from the department of defense uh titled
[03:17:54.840 --> 03:17:58.520]  sociological behavior analysis and modeling
[03:17:58.520 --> 03:18:02.600]  technologies for phase zero world this came out to
[03:18:02.600 --> 03:18:07.320]  march 6 of 2013 and it goes into basically how
[03:18:07.320 --> 03:18:11.000]  the department of defense teaming up with a bunch of major universities
[03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:16.200]  are gathering all the data from all over the world including uh
[03:18:16.200 --> 03:18:20.840]  eastern michigan university michigan university arizona state the document
[03:18:20.840 --> 03:18:26.040]  describes develop develop theological framework for analyzing key
[03:18:26.040 --> 03:18:30.120]  figures of extremist stories and their influence
[03:18:30.120 --> 03:18:35.800]  and in a method of tracking tracking narratives across the space arizona
[03:18:35.800 --> 03:18:39.000]  state is doing that and you know extremists according to ph
[03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:43.240]  is anyone who is a tea partier or libertarian or ron paul
[03:18:43.240 --> 03:18:46.440]  oh no speaking of drudge report dot com our story is on the right hand side i
[03:18:46.440 --> 03:18:50.600]  had noticed that tsa rolls out detention pods at airport terminals
[03:18:50.600 --> 03:18:54.040]  and and that's what these are when you go into a bank in italy
[03:18:54.040 --> 03:18:57.720]  you walk in it locks behind you they have to authorize letting you in but this is
[03:18:57.720 --> 03:19:01.720]  to leave the airport uh this is a way to totally
[03:19:01.720 --> 03:19:04.760]  break you and your family up to put you in these one at a time
[03:19:04.760 --> 03:19:08.200]  uh and and this is their plan for society
[03:19:08.200 --> 03:19:11.800]  and what's frustrating is it was two three years ago
[03:19:11.800 --> 03:19:15.560]  that uh liberty guard with former congressman bob bar sued
[03:19:15.560 --> 03:19:18.920]  because they got the cover sheet from an insider and and they confirmed it was
[03:19:18.920 --> 03:19:21.880]  happening that alex jones matt drudge info wars
[03:19:21.880 --> 03:19:26.120]  dot com drudge report dot com and other names
[03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:29.880]  i think it was on the ron paul and others are listed as extremists and then
[03:19:29.880 --> 03:19:33.800]  they have secret files on us and they actually demonize us in the
[03:19:33.800 --> 03:19:37.160]  classes and then they declared national
[03:19:37.160 --> 03:19:40.360]  security in the lawsuit and last time i heard infregard
[03:19:40.360 --> 03:19:44.600]  and not infregard infregard's the fbi spy program liberty guard liberty guard
[03:19:44.600 --> 03:19:48.360]  liberty guard uh liberty guard couldn't get those but but
[03:19:48.360 --> 03:19:52.040]  absolutely that's what's going on julio it's crazy good to hear from you
[03:19:52.040 --> 03:19:55.960]  let's talk to tanner in texas tanner you're on the air
[03:19:55.960 --> 03:19:59.320]  alex man this is the first time calling in i've been listed for about a year now
[03:19:59.320 --> 03:20:04.120]  versus the sandy hook the other day i got the the nathan i dine in
[03:20:04.120 --> 03:20:09.000]  and literally after maybe 30 seconds to a minute
[03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:12.600]  after taking those drops man my mind just it hit
[03:20:12.600 --> 03:20:17.480]  i was a wave of just something different and now i've got these headaches and i
[03:20:17.480 --> 03:20:21.080]  think i remember from listening to your show it's the part of the detox that
[03:20:21.080 --> 03:20:25.160]  your body doesn't i warned people up front about this and again i'm not
[03:20:25.160 --> 03:20:27.400]  screening the calls everybody's calling about iodine
[03:20:27.400 --> 03:20:31.160]  we may have to ban people doing that because there's so many positive reviews
[03:20:31.160 --> 03:20:36.280]  it sounds canned but it's not i forget the effect that doctor
[03:20:36.280 --> 03:20:39.480]  well dr brownstein talks about he's a medical doctor and you've got
[03:20:39.480 --> 03:20:44.760]  the other folks the pharmacist talk about it but also dr group talks about
[03:20:44.760 --> 03:20:48.920]  it as a scientific name i forget the name of it i've read all the literature
[03:20:48.920 --> 03:20:52.600]  but but but but but after a few weeks there's an effect
[03:20:52.600 --> 03:20:56.120]  that might be it look it up and it's a detoxing effect when it starts drawing
[03:20:56.120 --> 03:20:59.720]  out the fluoride other stuff in your body that you feel it
[03:20:59.720 --> 03:21:03.720]  and and about a month i began to feel it some people it's a few days
[03:21:03.720 --> 03:21:07.160]  depending on how toxic you are and then reportedly again i'm no doctor so i
[03:21:07.160 --> 03:21:09.560]  shouldn't even talk about this but i'm just giving you what i remember him
[03:21:09.560 --> 03:21:14.680]  saying uh that that that then uh it goes away
[03:21:14.680 --> 03:21:18.120]  after a while and then you get the clarity uh and and that's exactly what
[03:21:18.120 --> 03:21:22.520]  i've gone through and the issue is if you're deficient for decades in in
[03:21:22.520 --> 03:21:26.920]  iodine or your body can't break down the type that's in the food chain now
[03:21:26.920 --> 03:21:31.080]  that's chemically bound when you get unbound pure atomic iodine the real
[03:21:31.080 --> 03:21:34.120]  deal i mean it's a big deal of what it does to
[03:21:34.120 --> 03:21:37.800]  reportedly the glands the hormones everything uh so so go go ahead and
[03:21:37.800 --> 03:21:42.280]  describe what what's happened for you well yeah i started taking it
[03:21:42.280 --> 03:21:46.520]  yesterday i got it and i took it and boom it was like
[03:21:46.520 --> 03:21:51.160]  it was like a drug with a high i mean my mind was clear i was more focused it
[03:21:51.160 --> 03:21:54.680]  was more energy and i have a hereditary uh
[03:21:54.680 --> 03:21:59.080]  family of suffering from hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism but the both
[03:21:59.080 --> 03:22:02.520]  kinds of forms of thyroid which by the way is epidemic and and
[03:22:02.520 --> 03:22:05.960]  that effect is when the iodine kills the bad bacteria in your gut but there's
[03:22:05.960 --> 03:22:09.720]  another effect he was talking about another effect but
[03:22:09.720 --> 03:22:15.320]  go ahead uh sir i mean it's great i i don't know how to explain i just feel
[03:22:15.320 --> 03:22:18.760]  a difference a catastrophic difference from
[03:22:18.760 --> 03:22:21.320]  the way i was used to feeling i'm 21 years old
[03:22:21.320 --> 03:22:25.640]  and i've caught on to this early now and i try to get my family on it
[03:22:25.640 --> 03:22:29.320]  but this stuff that you come out with is just really
[03:22:29.320 --> 03:22:33.000]  changing things around you know they always told me to take these pills
[03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:37.240]  but as soon as i took the drops it was like i i'm putting on some different
[03:22:37.240 --> 03:22:41.240]  kind of glasses i could see differently uh in the form of
[03:22:41.240 --> 03:22:45.720]  health wise it's just a 100 benefit well actually i'm not going to get into
[03:22:45.720 --> 03:22:49.640]  what the medical doctors have told me just because it sounds too ridiculous so
[03:22:49.640 --> 03:22:53.880]  but the whole issue is there's all sorts of these toxins these fluorines
[03:22:53.880 --> 03:22:58.680]  these halogens all over the body and in different nerve tissues you name it
[03:22:58.680 --> 03:23:04.040]  and um all i'm saying is consult a physician before you take it
[03:23:04.040 --> 03:23:07.640]  because a lot of people are so toxic lord knows what it'll do to you
[03:23:07.640 --> 03:23:11.320]  and again this is compared to the pill iodine you can buy at the store
[03:23:11.320 --> 03:23:14.680]  but the government recommends that's it's somewhat toxic from what i've read
[03:23:14.680 --> 03:23:19.080]  but still better than nothing this stuff isn't even as strong it
[03:23:19.080 --> 03:23:22.440]  doesn't matter because it's a it's electrified basically
[03:23:22.440 --> 03:23:26.280]  and it's it's pure and it's bioavailable
[03:23:26.280 --> 03:23:30.120]  that's the difference with this stuff look as much as i knew about fluoride
[03:23:30.120 --> 03:23:34.840]  and the fluoride conspiracy as much as i knew about all this stuff
[03:23:34.840 --> 03:23:39.080]  i was sitting right beside this the whole time and just kept talking to
[03:23:39.080 --> 03:23:43.240]  experts and nutritionists and scientists and medical doctors and
[03:23:43.240 --> 03:23:46.520]  pharmacists and they kept saying iodine iodine iodine
[03:23:46.520 --> 03:23:50.760]  so i got on the monofilone the last year really felt that my wife's like whoa
[03:23:50.760 --> 03:23:53.240]  you know you bring on these supplements but this is dynamite
[03:23:53.240 --> 03:23:56.440]  monofilone we sell but you know any brown seaweed so their hemisphere is
[03:23:56.440 --> 03:24:00.840]  better than nothing gourmet salts have some of the good iodine in them i mean
[03:24:00.840 --> 03:24:03.960]  you know this is just one way or the other folks you need to get this stuff
[03:24:03.960 --> 03:24:08.440]  but then it's like light years better with this particular form of nascent
[03:24:08.440 --> 03:24:11.960]  iodine which as i said they've had major but i have the
[03:24:11.960 --> 03:24:16.200]  contract major
[03:24:16.360 --> 03:24:21.400]  companies in cosmetics and shampoo i'll just leave it at that
[03:24:21.400 --> 03:24:29.400]  that have tried to get the proprietary system and basically buy out this iodine
[03:24:29.400 --> 03:24:33.640]  that's just amazing but it doesn't matter because the genie's out of the bottle
[03:24:33.640 --> 03:24:37.160]  and another factory has now been built separately in texas
[03:24:37.160 --> 03:24:39.480]  it's actually in new mexico but it's run from texas
[03:24:39.480 --> 03:24:42.520]  that's not where ours is coming from yet but
[03:24:42.520 --> 03:24:46.200]  the it's very exciting it's very very exciting
[03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:49.320]  and again it turns out the establishment already knows all this
[03:24:49.320 --> 03:24:52.600]  in fact it turns out we are not the only place that has this
[03:24:52.600 --> 03:24:56.120]  it turns out there's private development of this has been going on for
[03:24:56.120 --> 03:25:02.040]  a long time and yes who's taking it then the establishment and that's why
[03:25:02.040 --> 03:25:04.760]  they're taking such notice to us promoting it
[03:25:04.760 --> 03:25:09.720]  is that this is their little secret well of course they're bombing us with all
[03:25:09.720 --> 03:25:12.600]  the bad halogens because your body's got to have them one more
[03:25:12.600 --> 03:25:15.800]  those they'll use the bad ones if the good one isn't there i mean
[03:25:15.800 --> 03:25:19.320]  they want a bunch of zombies what do you think's going on here
[03:25:19.320 --> 03:25:22.920]  you call it the fluoride conspiracy or the iodine conspiracy i i don't know
[03:25:22.920 --> 03:25:26.920]  what you call it but i mean it's real folks it's real it's like if you don't
[03:25:26.920 --> 03:25:31.720]  have water you'll die i mean if you don't have iodine you'll die
[03:25:31.720 --> 03:25:34.920]  if you don't have essential fatty acids you'll die
[03:25:34.920 --> 03:25:38.440]  and they tell you don't eat a diet that has fat period well your brain will
