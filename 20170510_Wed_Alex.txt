[00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:17.970]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.514]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.514 --> 00:00:30.662]  Obviously, I hate to tell folks even the general area where we get our information from concerning the White House.
[00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:35.379]  Because the media has a big field day with it and tries to shut off those sources.
[00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.241]  But I was on the phone very, very late last night talking to multiple sources.
[00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:42.723]  And then I called Roger Stone about 11, Texas time, midnight, his time.
[00:00:42.723 --> 00:00:44.384]  We talked for over an hour.
[00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:49.887]  And he confirmed a lot of what I was learning from other sources.
[00:00:49.887 --> 00:00:55.590]  And of course, Roger is one of the only people now that Trump still routinely talks to outside of the White House.
[00:00:57.642 --> 00:01:05.604]  I don't know how much Roger will get into today, but I, from my other sources, separately have exactly what happened with Comey.
[00:01:05.604 --> 00:01:17.788]  Comey was compromised, and had been compromised for a long time, and was being clearly manipulated by deep state sources.
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:31.713]  To try to exert pressure onto the White House to have the White House carry out the deep state's political aims with this whole fake Russia narrative that if they didn't basically do what John McCain and others wanted
[00:01:33.874 --> 00:01:37.196]  They would continue on with hearings and try to impeach the President.
[00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:40.477]  So they're blackmailing the President with this fake Russia narrative.
[00:01:40.477 --> 00:01:42.258]  Senator Rand Paul obviously knows all about this.
[00:01:42.258 --> 00:01:44.579]  He's come out and said that's basically what it is as well.
[00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.740]  Said good riddance to Comey.
[00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.802]  Comey ignored crimes that were ultra-massive.
[00:01:50.802 --> 00:01:59.987]  And he followed the orders of the Attorney General who was so corrupt she would sit there and meet on airplanes with Bill Clinton on the tarmac while he was under criminal investigation by her agency, Loretta Lynch.
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.161]  That's one area.
[00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:17.913]  But it's also the fact that Comey is seen as weak, and as very, very manipulative, but in a candy-ass way.
[00:02:17.913 --> 00:02:20.656]  Lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy, I didn't know.
[00:02:20.656 --> 00:02:23.098]  Oh my goodness, I had two doors I could go down.
[00:02:23.098 --> 00:02:28.082]  I had one door that was cover up, and I had another door that was get involved in the politics, and lordy, lordy.
[00:02:31.932 --> 00:02:39.557]  Comey has the FBI standing in the way of prosecuting the Clintons for being on the Russian payroll, being on the Chinese payroll, 50 times what the Russians were.
[00:02:39.557 --> 00:02:44.381]  I mean, it's the Chinese that are up our you-know-what.
[00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:48.423]  I mean, it's the Chinese that are almost in control of this country in many respects.
[00:02:48.423 --> 00:02:53.047]  I mean, we are in deep trouble as a sovereign nation.
[00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:56.029]  There's major geopolitical jockeying going on right now.
[00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:58.951]  That's why Henry Kissinger is at the White House today.
[00:02:59.656 --> 00:03:08.022]  Henry Kissinger, code name Boer, was in Army Intelligence throughout World War II, helped set up the Bilderberg Group, everything.
[00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:12.485]  And he was a double agent to the Russians, that's come out in Congressional testimony.
[00:03:12.485 --> 00:03:17.469]  And he's one of the main advisors of Vladimir Putin, so that's major back-channel deals going on.
[00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:25.535]  And I'm not saying that he is a Russian agent, he was a Russian double, triple agent back in World War II and afterwards.
[00:03:25.535 --> 00:03:26.976]  But really, he's an agent of the globalists.
[00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:32.258]  And so there's major power jockeying.
[00:03:32.258 --> 00:03:43.489]  I've told the President this myself in person, and I've said it here on the broadcast a hundred times at least, and I'm going to say it again when we come back and Roger Stone joins us.
[00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.791]  We're not looking for trouble.
[00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:46.132]  We're not looking for revolution.
[00:03:46.132 --> 00:03:48.394]  We're not looking for bloodbaths.
[00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:51.858]  The globalists and their leftist hordes and their refugees
[00:03:53.243 --> 00:04:01.610]  Are here to destabilize the West and are trying to push a narrative of violence and overthrow and kill the police and war in the streets and all this garbage.
[00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.295]  And we are involved in dereliction of duty if we don't do something about it.
[00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:13.201]  Now, they're saying Trump took a gamble by firing Comey.
[00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:16.023]  The Democrats wanted him fired three months ago.
[00:04:16.023 --> 00:04:19.026]  Now they wake up on the other side of the bed and suddenly they love Comey.
[00:04:23.752 --> 00:04:25.774]  Trump has to drop the hammer on him.
[00:04:25.774 --> 00:04:31.498]  His attorney general has to start the moves for the indictments right now.
[00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:33.600]  So that's what needs to happen right now.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.943]  And then Trump will be the superstar president we need who restores the republic.
[00:04:37.943 --> 00:04:40.405]  Which he's already doing economically and militarily.
[00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:42.007]  Obviously he's an American president.
[00:04:42.007 --> 00:04:43.668]  We haven't had that in a while.
[00:04:43.668 --> 00:04:48.372]  Say what you want about him, that's why the elites are pissed, because we've actually got somebody in there that really does care about the interests of this country.
[00:04:49.654 --> 00:04:54.805]  All the special entries that have been raping us forever are now freaking out realizing there's a new sheriff in town.
[00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:55.546]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:55.967]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.641]  Last week, InfoWars.com published the article, Bombshell Study Proves Unvaccinated Children Are Healthier Than Vaccinated Children.
[00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:10.942]  The two studies were pulled from the Journal of Transitional Science without any explanation.
[00:05:10.942 --> 00:05:16.224]  The studies surveyed parents of 666 homeschooled children, 39% who were not vaccinated.
[00:05:16.224 --> 00:05:21.445]  When asked about allergies, 22% of vaccinated children were shown to have allergies, while only 6.9% were unvaccinated.
[00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:23.325]  Autism, 4.7% were vaccinated versus 1% unvaccinated.
[00:05:26.886 --> 00:05:31.708]  So of course there's going to be pushback when a study like this comes out proving that vaccines are not really safe.
[00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:35.009]  And people are going to come out and attack it and say, oh, they just talked to parents.
[00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.189]  Or they'll say, oh, there was a bias in the study.
[00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:39.270]  These people think vaccines are unsafe.
[00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.771]  One, the study proves they're unsafe.
[00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:45.292]  And two, any other vaccine study is done and paid for by the pharmaceutical companies.
[00:05:45.292 --> 00:05:47.173]  Of course, they think vaccines are safe.
[00:05:47.173 --> 00:05:50.934]  Just go to our article, Bombshell Study Proves Unvaccinated Children Are Healthier.
[00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:53.995]  We have archived links to the studies, and you can see for yourself.
[00:05:53.995 --> 00:05:56.596]  Because drug companies will do anything to keep you from the truth.
[00:05:56.736 --> 00:05:59.898]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:05:59.898 --> 00:06:05.301]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:08.163]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:06:08.163 --> 00:06:10.124]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:06:10.124 --> 00:06:15.167]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:17.248]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:06:17.248 --> 00:06:18.549]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:23.472]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:06:23.632 --> 00:06:30.535]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:06:30.535 --> 00:06:33.516]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:06:33.516 --> 00:06:37.217]  It's loaded with good halogen iodides of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:06:37.217 --> 00:06:44.120]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.302]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:51.064]  Let's go to Dabit in Florida.
[00:06:51.064 --> 00:06:53.007]  Dabit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:06.709]  Great!
[00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:07.830]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.353]  Listen, I have bought your products, and I gotta say, they're amazing.
[00:07:12.353 --> 00:07:22.238]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it, because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor... Wow, thank you.
[00:07:22.238 --> 00:07:24.880]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.441]  Which Nutra-Certical does he like best?
[00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:30.142]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:07:30.142 --> 00:07:31.422]  That's really incredible.
[00:07:31.422 --> 00:07:34.483]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:07:34.483 --> 00:07:35.824]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[00:07:35.824 --> 00:07:37.504]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:07:37.504 --> 00:07:38.624]  And I love you guys.
[00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:40.905]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[00:07:40.905 --> 00:07:47.747]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:07:47.747 --> 00:07:48.787]  You will love it.
[00:07:48.787 --> 00:07:50.608]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:55.350]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:07.516]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:07.516 --> 00:08:18.381]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:08:22.606 --> 00:08:29.167]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:29.167 --> 00:08:34.049]  Wednesday, May 10th, 2017.
[00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:35.889]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:37.529]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:48.092]  Well, President Trump, 45, told Comey, the incredibly political, globalist operative that had been protecting the Clintons for many years, he told him, you're fired!
[00:08:48.092 --> 00:08:48.932]  And there went Comey.
[00:08:50.427 --> 00:08:52.988]  And now the Democrats are acting like it is the end of the world.
[00:08:52.988 --> 00:08:54.249]  They're saying it's a Nixonian.
[00:08:54.249 --> 00:08:56.050]  We've got to impeach President Trump.
[00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:00.992]  And they're the ones, just three months ago, calling for him to be fired.
[00:09:00.992 --> 00:09:03.013]  Look at some of these headlines from DrudgeReport.com.
[00:09:03.013 --> 00:09:06.115]  Rand Paul says, good riddance.
[00:09:06.115 --> 00:09:09.176]  Durbin calls it a grave constitutional issue.
[00:09:09.176 --> 00:09:11.558]  McCain, more shoes to drop.
[00:09:11.558 --> 00:09:14.179]  Some Dems want emergency hearings.
[00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:16.240]  Chaos, turmoil, agents crying.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.000]  What a load of bull.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.022]  Most of the agents, it's been confirmed, absolutely could not stand coming.
[00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.591]  All the big scandals.
[00:09:23.591 --> 00:09:29.555]  Well, the media and Congress is saying, basically, and the White House is saying it was that he didn't know the chain of command and did whatever he wanted to.
[00:09:29.555 --> 00:09:33.958]  And now they're saying Comey sought more money for Russian probes days before he was fired, officials say.
[00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:34.519]  Washington Post.
[00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:35.720]  Well, Trump was tweeting last week.
[00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:39.971]  Why aren't you looking at the uranium deals and Hillary and the Podestas?
[00:09:39.971 --> 00:09:42.232]  Why aren't you looking at her meeting secretly with Putin?
[00:09:42.232 --> 00:09:44.813]  Why aren't you involved with her and Communist China?
[00:09:44.813 --> 00:09:46.794]  Or the OPM hack?
[00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:56.620]  Why is it all General Flynn went and got paid to go on RT television and he had gigs with the Germans and the British and the Turks and everybody else, you know, when he was in a private citizen?
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.682]  That's the big bottom of the rabbit hole here.
[00:10:00.682 --> 00:10:04.485]  So joining us from the airport, flying to New York to be on the Today Show tomorrow.
[00:10:04.485 --> 00:10:10.909]  In two days, his big Netflix show, Get Me Roger Stone, that yours truly is also in, is set to premiere.
[00:10:10.909 --> 00:10:15.413]  It's got amazing ratings from the critics that have already seen it.
[00:10:15.413 --> 00:10:16.954]  So I look forward to seeing that, obviously.
[00:10:16.954 --> 00:10:20.937]  Netflix Get Me Roger Stone, the notorious GOP operative, plays both narrator and villain.
[00:10:22.341 --> 00:10:24.101]  So, get me Roger Stone.
[00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:28.463]  That is coming up in T-minus 48 hours on Netflix.
[00:10:28.463 --> 00:10:39.065]  But going to Roger Stone, he's got a Fox News crew and a bunch of other crews following him around at the airport, giving us the first exclusive today on exactly what is breaking down and happening with Comey.
[00:10:39.065 --> 00:10:41.366]  Roger, let's go over from your sources.
[00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:46.929]  Well, some interesting contretemps today, Alex.
[00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:56.272]  Politico published a story which claimed that I had persuaded the president to fire James Comey.
[00:10:56.272 --> 00:11:01.393]  CNN picked that story up from Politico.
[00:11:01.393 --> 00:11:07.015]  I am not the source of that story, nor have I claimed anything of the kind, because as I have said,
[00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:11.723]  On this show, many times, no one talks Donald Trump into anything.
[00:11:11.723 --> 00:11:14.992]  He's not some mannequin that you hand talking points to.
[00:11:16.174 --> 00:11:24.360]  And I have always declined to discuss the content or frequency of my conversations with the President.
[00:11:46.474 --> 00:11:51.918]  Well, specifically, I'm not the source of those reports, nor did I confirm them.
[00:11:51.918 --> 00:11:54.079]  But Alex, I have spoken about this.
[00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:55.420]  I have talked about it.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:01.363]  I've been calling for Mr. Comey's firing now for months.
[00:12:01.363 --> 00:12:07.807]  And beyond that, the idea that I somehow persuaded the president is just not true.
[00:12:09.366 --> 00:12:12.687]  As you know, any advice you do give the President, you're best to keep to yourself.
[00:12:12.687 --> 00:12:17.568]  The President has to have an expectation of confidentiality.
[00:12:17.568 --> 00:12:21.029]  So the President tweeted fake news.
[00:12:21.029 --> 00:12:23.689]  You know, Roger Stone did not talk me into firing Comey.
[00:12:23.689 --> 00:12:25.310]  Well, that's true, I did not.
[00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.230]  And I never said I did, nor did I ever claim that.
[00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.391]  That's right, it's the media just going with this.
[00:12:32.221 --> 00:12:35.542]  Yeah, you know, CNN picked it up from Politico.
[00:12:35.542 --> 00:12:37.262]  I didn't confirm it for Politico.
[00:12:37.262 --> 00:12:40.083]  I didn't confirm it for CNN.
[00:12:40.083 --> 00:12:44.464]  I'm not going to talk about any conversation I may or may not have had with the President.
[00:12:44.464 --> 00:12:48.985]  That's always been my policy, even here at InfoWars.
[00:12:48.985 --> 00:12:49.765]  Certainly.
[00:12:49.765 --> 00:12:56.066]  Now... But that said, the President's made a bold and I think the correct decision.
[00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:59.407]  Comey had no interest in the mega-crimes by the Clintons.
[00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:02.511]  The Clinton Foundation is not a charity.
[00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:04.613]  It's a slush fund for grifters.
[00:13:04.613 --> 00:13:16.745]  And as we both know, it was the vehicle for the facilitation of multi-million dollar bribes on matters not just uranium, but across the board.
[00:13:16.745 --> 00:13:25.053]  Yet Mr. Comey seemed to have no interest in those crimes, wasting his time investigating the non-existent Russian collusion.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:35.582]  Again, there is no evidence whatsoever that would hold up in a court of law of any collusion between the Russian and officials in the Trump campaign.
[00:13:35.582 --> 00:13:36.802]  It's a canard.
[00:13:36.802 --> 00:13:43.663]  Sure, and Senator Paul has come out, Senator Paul has seen the intelligence, he's come out and said that's the case as well, they admit there's nothing there.
[00:13:43.663 --> 00:13:51.865]  But from my sources, and what I was told, and then I called you last night and you said, well you've talked to some of your sources and that seemed to be right on target, it was that Comey
[00:13:52.665 --> 00:14:10.217]  Was violating the chain of command, was seen as reckless, weird, constantly changing positions, and that he was just seen as overall kind of soft, and that that's why the Attorney General recommended he be removed.
[00:14:10.217 --> 00:14:13.640]  My sources said the exact same thing that your sources said.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.602]  That's 100% accurate.
[00:14:16.602 --> 00:14:18.063]  He seemed to be empire building.
[00:14:18.841 --> 00:14:23.203]  He didn't seem to be responsive to either the Congress or the executive branch.
[00:14:23.203 --> 00:14:28.626]  He seemed to believe he was a power unto himself with his own agenda.
[00:14:28.626 --> 00:14:31.708]  Only days ago saying, well, you're stuck with me for six years.
[00:14:31.708 --> 00:14:33.629]  Well, not so fast.
[00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:39.792]  And by the way, you notice that he said he thought it was a joke when he first heard the news yesterday.
[00:14:39.792 --> 00:14:41.393]  Totally disconnected from reality.
[00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:48.602]  The key thing I think is that I 100% support the President's decision.
[00:14:48.602 --> 00:14:53.903]  This had nothing to do with heading off a Russian investigation.
[00:14:53.903 --> 00:15:01.385]  Senators Warner, Feinstein, Franken, Congressman Schiff, Speier, Himes, they have nothing, Alex.
[00:15:01.385 --> 00:15:01.945]  Nothing.
[00:15:01.945 --> 00:15:03.525]  They're holding it in their hands.
[00:15:03.525 --> 00:15:05.285]  They got nothing.
[00:15:05.285 --> 00:15:11.267]  It's bogus, and they're about to be humiliated if they continue down this path.
[00:15:11.267 --> 00:15:12.647]  The idea that this is like
[00:15:13.251 --> 00:15:17.754]  Richard Nixon and the Saturday Night Massacre is false for several reasons.
[00:15:17.754 --> 00:15:21.897]  First of all, Watergate had been in full bore for 18 months.
[00:15:21.897 --> 00:15:27.441]  Archibald Cox was specifically investigating Richard Nixon himself when Nixon fired Cox.
[00:15:31.255 --> 00:15:33.276]  Making him a cocksacker.
[00:15:33.276 --> 00:15:38.019]  In any event, this situation is not analogous.
[00:15:38.019 --> 00:15:43.662]  There is no allegation that the president himself was involved in any Russian collusion.
[00:15:43.662 --> 00:15:45.463]  There's no evidence to that effect.
[00:15:45.463 --> 00:15:53.327]  Sure, doesn't it take the wind out of their sails, Roger, that the Democrats just three months ago were calling for his sacking?
[00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:54.648]  Yeah, three months ago.
[00:15:54.648 --> 00:15:55.929]  How about a day ago?
[00:15:56.795 --> 00:16:03.877]  Hillary Clinton was whining about this two days ago, she came out, as you saw, saying that Comey had cost her the election.
[00:16:03.877 --> 00:16:06.058]  It was his fault and misogyny.
[00:16:06.058 --> 00:16:09.319]  Now she's saying it's horrible that he was fired.
[00:16:09.319 --> 00:16:12.260]  Well, first of all, she's right about the misogyny issue.
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:18.041]  Her husband's misogyny was definitely a major factor in her defeat.
[00:16:18.041 --> 00:16:20.042]  And let's give some credit, you helped engineer a lot of that.
[00:16:21.448 --> 00:16:33.833]  Well, I think a lot of Americans were unaware of the record, because back in the 80s, when Infowars.com did not exist, no Breitbart, no Daily Caller, no alternative media,
[00:16:34.545 --> 00:16:39.767]  The three major networks conspired to cover up the rape of Juanita Broderick.
[00:16:39.767 --> 00:16:52.633]  The three major networks conspired to cover up multiple sexual assaults by Bill, but more importantly, they covered up Hillary's actions to bully and intimidate and threaten Bill's victims.
[00:16:52.633 --> 00:16:54.034]  Hillary is so entitled.
[00:16:54.034 --> 00:16:58.796]  You cannot be an advocate for women when you are, you know, terrorizing them.
[00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:02.594]  Now let's get into the meat and potatoes.
[00:17:02.594 --> 00:17:03.999]  This is only happening at the bottom of the hour.
[00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:05.384]  We've got to do a Fox interview right now.
[00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:08.770]  Where is all this going?
[00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.391]  Because they're saying it's a constitutional crisis.
[00:17:10.391 --> 00:17:13.593]  They're saying they want to have all these hearings like he's covering something up.
[00:17:13.593 --> 00:17:17.436]  Comey is running around doing whatever he wants to.
[00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:20.318]  And anybody that really actually studies it knows that.
[00:17:20.318 --> 00:17:23.880]  And we know, though, he wanted to expand the fake Russian investigation.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.144]  When we've all been saying, lock Hillary up for her Russian connections, the uranium deals, the Chinese connections.
[00:17:29.144 --> 00:17:35.488]  I mean, it's so crazy that the Podestas, as you reported over a year ago, they knew that they were in deep with Russia.
[00:17:35.488 --> 00:17:37.129]  So they turned the whole narrative around.
[00:17:38.149 --> 00:17:43.032]  Classic disinformation.
[00:17:43.032 --> 00:17:47.034]  I must admit, a brilliant strategy by Podesta.
[00:17:47.034 --> 00:17:52.997]  Blame Donald Trump for doing exactly what he himself and the Clintons are doing, enriching themselves.
[00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.811]  I was about to say, now we know Obama...
[00:18:22.324 --> 00:18:26.666]  Obama ordered thousands of Americans in the election spied on for political control.
[00:18:26.666 --> 00:18:28.707]  That's all admitted now.
[00:18:28.707 --> 00:18:33.950]  Well, and in the hearing two days ago, we had James Clapper testifying.
[00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:38.012]  Mr. Clapper lied to the Congress about your medicare.
[00:18:38.012 --> 00:18:41.314]  He should have been fired then, and he should be a pariah today.
[00:18:41.314 --> 00:18:45.876]  Why would we believe anything he said after he got caught red-handed?
[00:18:45.876 --> 00:18:50.739]  Which, by the way, would not have happened if Edward Snowden had not stepped forward and exposed it.
[00:18:53.519 --> 00:19:01.666]  I want to look at... The Republicans, really, on these two committees need to stop kowtowing to punks like Adam Schiff.
[00:19:01.666 --> 00:19:07.371]  And, you know, I saw one story on Susan Rice's refusal to testify.
[00:19:07.371 --> 00:19:15.317]  If Paul Manafort or Roger Stone or General Flynn refused to testify, you know, all hell would break loose.
[00:19:15.317 --> 00:19:17.419]  It would be a constitutional crisis.
[00:19:17.419 --> 00:19:21.743]  It would shake the Republic to its foundation.
[00:19:22.606 --> 00:19:24.189]  This is nonsense.
[00:19:24.189 --> 00:19:27.234]  It's time to find out what Susan Rice did.
[00:19:27.234 --> 00:19:29.678]  It's time to find out what Obama knew and when he knew it.
[00:19:36.533 --> 00:19:44.097]  Kissinger at the White House today, obviously he's a top advisor to Vladimir Putin, but that's okay because, you know, he's establishment.
[00:19:44.097 --> 00:19:52.041]  Of course Russia and the United States are talking, so that's happening right now, right as Lavrov arrives and slaps down Andrea Mitchell yet again.
[00:19:52.041 --> 00:19:56.544]  And so there's a lot of power playing going on in DC right now.
[00:19:56.544 --> 00:20:04.128]  I've got some calls into my sources on that, but what's your intel on the major tectonic movements we see going on in DC geopolitically today?
[00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:10.692]  Well, Alex, I've known Henry Kissinger since 1969.
[00:20:10.692 --> 00:20:21.457]  He started out as a disciple to Fritz Kramer and the hardliners, and he ended up being an advocate for detente with both the Russians and the Chinese.
[00:20:21.457 --> 00:20:28.060]  He's a skilled diplomat, and Donald Trump has decided to use Clinton to his advantage.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.801]  Sure, you want somebody who knows Putin.
[00:20:30.801 --> 00:20:33.762]  What better way to have a back-channel dialogue?
[00:20:34.814 --> 00:20:39.817]  Originally, the Democrats were criticizing Tillerson because he knows Putin.
[00:20:39.817 --> 00:20:44.559]  The President himself told me having somebody who knows Putin is a plus, not a minus.
[00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:49.201]  Yeah, that's what the executive branch is supposed to talk to the other leaders.
[00:20:49.201 --> 00:20:56.364]  How Congress is trying, the liberals are trying to paralyze the President where he can't act as the executive is treason.
[00:20:56.364 --> 00:21:03.648]  Well, I reported right here at InfoWars that Dr. Kissinger carried a private message from the President of the United States to the Chinese.
[00:21:04.252 --> 00:21:05.973]  That was very well received.
[00:21:05.973 --> 00:21:10.855]  This was after the Chinese premier visited Mar-a-Lago.
[00:21:10.855 --> 00:21:13.576]  This is high-level diplomacy.
[00:21:13.576 --> 00:21:16.917]  This is what the president is supposed to be doing.
[00:21:16.917 --> 00:21:22.740]  But the idea that Henry Kissinger is bending Trump to his will is exactly backward.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.902]  Donald Trump is using Kissinger's skills as a diplomat.
[00:21:26.902 --> 00:21:32.724]  I see no evidence that Kissinger is changing the president's mind on, say, interventionism.
[00:21:33.419 --> 00:21:42.110]  In fact, my sources tell me Kissinger was opposed to the recommendation of putting 150,000 troops into Syria.
[00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:51.942]  The other thing I can tell you, Alex, as reported here on InfoWars by Mike Cernovich, which I can now confirm, General McMaster is clearly on the skids.
[00:21:52.938 --> 00:21:54.759]  He is on his way out.
[00:21:54.759 --> 00:22:03.881]  He has not meshed with the president in terms of operating style, and I do not think he has the president's confidence in this role.
[00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:08.423]  I think he will be appointed to a position for which he is better suited.
[00:22:09.343 --> 00:22:10.723]  You know, the word is just shuffled off.
[00:22:10.723 --> 00:22:11.544]  Give it another star.
[00:22:11.544 --> 00:22:12.764]  This is on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:22:12.764 --> 00:22:14.385]  It's also on Infowars.com.
[00:22:14.385 --> 00:22:18.846]  Obama uses a private jet 14-car convoy to get to climate speech.
[00:22:18.846 --> 00:22:24.048]  I'll talk about that later, but White House leakers have a new target, HR McMaster.
[00:22:24.048 --> 00:22:28.190]  And that's exactly what I was getting told by my sources and Cernovich's sources, is that
[00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:43.400]  Is that now Trump is going into the mode of leaking basically himself, which he's allowed to do, or some of his adjuncts, to go ahead and start undermining McMaster because McMaster, again, another guy that thought that he was in charge of everything, just like Comey.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:54.869]  Yeah, all these White House staffers and other presidential appointees who think they can manipulate Donald Trump like a puppet just do not know him and don't understand him.
[00:22:55.635 --> 00:22:57.056]  He's his own man.
[00:22:57.056 --> 00:22:58.737]  Sometimes he keeps his own counsel.
[00:22:58.737 --> 00:23:06.903]  Sometimes you can leave a meeting thinking you've persuaded him of something and then watch while he does the exact opposite of what you recommended.
[00:23:06.903 --> 00:23:08.945]  This is the Trumps that people elected.
[00:23:08.945 --> 00:23:13.108]  When I read on page one of the New York Times that
[00:23:14.025 --> 00:23:17.386]  Ivanka Trump wants to be a moderating influence on her father.
[00:23:17.386 --> 00:23:19.707]  I don't want a moderated Donald Trump.
[00:23:19.707 --> 00:23:21.428]  I want the Trump I voted for.
[00:23:21.428 --> 00:23:23.029]  I want the real Donald Trump.
[00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:27.070]  We didn't elect a younger, better-looking Hillary Clinton.
[00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.311]  Look, I love Trump just the way he is.
[00:23:29.311 --> 00:23:31.452]  I don't want a different Trump.
[00:23:31.452 --> 00:23:33.153]  I want Trump the outsider.
[00:23:33.153 --> 00:23:37.695]  I want Trump the bombastic, tough, shrewd,
[00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:45.584]  You know, a businessman, a guy who understands how to make things happen, not just sit around and talk about them.
[00:23:45.584 --> 00:23:50.287]  All right, Roger, in the five minutes we've got left here, I want to look at the big picture.
[00:23:50.287 --> 00:23:52.368]  I mean, clearly the Russia thing is completely made up.
[00:23:52.368 --> 00:23:59.733]  The Democrats and a lot of the other Republican establishment have been deeply involved with lots of multinational companies and foreign governments.
[00:23:59.733 --> 00:24:06.557]  With Trump, it's surprising how little Russian connections there are, knowing he's an international business magnate and real estate mogul.
[00:24:06.557 --> 00:24:07.218]  That said,
[00:24:08.138 --> 00:24:10.280]  The Democrats are never going to get off the offense.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.542]  They're the ones through their surrogates saying kill the president, kill us, overthrow everyone.
[00:24:14.542 --> 00:24:15.803]  They're at war with us.
[00:24:15.803 --> 00:24:17.745]  They're funding the cop killing groups.
[00:24:17.745 --> 00:24:20.446]  They're funding all the social distortion garbage.
[00:24:20.446 --> 00:24:24.549]  They're a clear and present danger running around inside our country.
[00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:26.691]  And so I'm not calling for authoritarianism.
[00:24:26.691 --> 00:24:28.292]  They're an authoritarian threat.
[00:24:28.292 --> 00:24:33.255]  And so we need the Attorney General to go after the Clintons, to go after Obama, to go after them all.
[00:24:33.255 --> 00:24:34.236]  They want a war.
[00:24:34.236 --> 00:24:35.417]  They need to get one.
[00:24:35.417 --> 00:24:37.138]  I know in my gut, but also historically.
[00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:47.719]  If he doesn't go all out constitutionally, with the right thing to do, and get really aggressive politically, and really start getting them back on their heels, they're not going to stop.
[00:24:47.719 --> 00:24:52.483]  They're going to make stuff up, they're going to dig stuff up, they're going to twist it, and they're going to try to remove the President.
[00:24:52.483 --> 00:24:53.544]  Now, am I wrong?
[00:24:53.544 --> 00:24:56.547]  Can he just let them sit there and do this forever?
[00:24:56.547 --> 00:24:59.389]  Or should he... Alex, I think you're absolutely right.
[00:24:59.389 --> 00:25:00.991]  I think you're 100% right.
[00:25:00.991 --> 00:25:03.273]  Look, we saw how the Democrats politicized
[00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:09.033]  Watergate, and they used it to undo one of the greatest political landslides in American history.
[00:25:09.033 --> 00:25:16.577]  They couldn't win at the ballot box, so they removed Nixon through this extrajudicial process.
[00:25:16.577 --> 00:25:29.884]  It's the same thing here, which is why I say again, the majority on the Senate Intelligence Committee need to vote to subpoena Mr. Podesta, his brother, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Chelsea Clinton.
[00:25:29.884 --> 00:25:31.945]  They should be compelled to testify about
[00:25:32.005 --> 00:25:32.305]  Cut and dry.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.240]  Well, exactly.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.201]  They're the ones that have done all the stuff, selling us out to globalism.
[00:25:55.201 --> 00:25:57.582]  We get a real president trying to revert power back to the country.
[00:25:57.582 --> 00:26:00.662]  Doesn't mean you agree with every policy, but he really is being the president right now.
[00:26:00.662 --> 00:26:02.483]  All these special interests are pissed.
[00:26:02.483 --> 00:26:13.285]  They've involved themselves in corporate international espionage, transferring power to this crony capitalist offshore combine, and they want to go on the offense and call for our deaths and all this other crap.
[00:26:13.285 --> 00:26:15.206]  It's time to go on the offense against these people.
[00:26:16.519 --> 00:26:17.740]  Well, and you put your finger on it.
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:22.504]  It's time for Attorney General Sessions to convene a grand jury and send for Hillary.
[00:26:22.504 --> 00:26:24.845]  I'm sure he has many, many, many questions for her.
[00:26:24.845 --> 00:26:26.627]  That's right, because they're not stopping.
[00:26:26.627 --> 00:26:28.448]  Email.
[00:26:28.448 --> 00:26:29.008]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:26:29.008 --> 00:26:34.112]  They're coming after America with everything they've got trying to destroy us, and they're the criminals.
[00:26:34.112 --> 00:26:35.694]  Then let's let them have it.
[00:26:35.694 --> 00:26:36.314]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:26:36.314 --> 00:26:38.616]  We have nothing to lose but running over these people.
[00:26:40.078 --> 00:26:41.560]  I could not agree more.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:46.304]  It's time for the Republican Party, the established Republican Party, to show some backbone.
[00:26:46.304 --> 00:26:48.946]  We have to fight the way the Democrats are.
[00:26:48.946 --> 00:26:51.268]  They are trying to undo the election.
[00:26:51.268 --> 00:26:52.449]  That is their goal.
[00:26:52.449 --> 00:26:58.295]  They're unhappy with what the people decided, and now they would like to remove Trump, discredit him?
[00:26:58.915 --> 00:27:13.644]  Destabilize him, and as the New Yorker proved, right, if it was New York, no, the New Yorker proved, there's an active cabal to try to declare him insane and remove him under the 25th Amendment, because they don't like his policies.
[00:27:13.644 --> 00:27:14.825]  Think about that for a moment.
[00:27:14.825 --> 00:27:23.311]  We had a president who was a sexual assaulter of women, but we're claiming that Donald Trump's crazy?
[00:27:23.311 --> 00:27:23.611]  Please.
[00:27:24.844 --> 00:27:27.726]  I mean, Bill Clinton's clearly completely insane, so is Hillary.
[00:27:27.726 --> 00:27:31.629]  Alright, StoneColdTruth.com, big Netflix show coming out in two days.
[00:27:31.629 --> 00:27:33.610]  I know you're going to be in New York tomorrow doing the rounds.
[00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:40.115]  Please come on sometime tomorrow with us on the eve of the TV premiere, because this is going to be a real documentary.
[00:27:40.115 --> 00:27:43.938]  I really look forward to seeing this with Roger Stone.
[00:27:43.938 --> 00:27:50.883]  In closing here, Roger, what else do you think the President needs to do?
[00:27:53.382 --> 00:27:59.784]  Well, I think he's, from a political point of view, he is now finally getting to tax reform.
[00:27:59.784 --> 00:28:04.266]  And this is an issue that unites all wings of the party and the movement.
[00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:13.569]  You've got to get out there and sell his vision for a growing economy and his bona fides as a job creator.
[00:28:13.569 --> 00:28:16.110]  We've dallied too long with Obamacare.
[00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.511]  I'm glad we got it repealed.
[00:28:18.348 --> 00:28:20.189]  But at least in the House.
[00:28:20.189 --> 00:28:24.312]  But it's now time to move to the core issue that won us the election.
[00:28:24.312 --> 00:28:29.356]  The stagnant economy and the fact that Barack Obama has run the country into the ground.
[00:28:29.356 --> 00:28:30.217]  It's the economy, stupid.
[00:28:30.217 --> 00:28:39.043]  I'm glad to see the President listening to people like Larry Kudlow instead of listening to people like his own economic advisor, Gary Cohn, the former chairman
[00:28:40.404 --> 00:28:46.006]  Amazing.
[00:28:46.006 --> 00:28:47.747]  I guess Trump thinks he's keeping his enemies closer.
[00:28:47.747 --> 00:28:48.907]  I know this.
[00:28:48.907 --> 00:28:53.369]  On the jobs, on the stock market, on the sovereignty issue, on killing TPP.
[00:28:53.369 --> 00:28:55.069]  He's totally delivered.
[00:28:55.069 --> 00:28:57.270]  Cutting the IRS funding.
[00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:58.411]  Cutting the UN funding by half.
[00:28:58.411 --> 00:28:59.811]  He's done a lot of great things.
[00:28:59.811 --> 00:29:01.272]  That's why they're so mad at him.
[00:29:01.272 --> 00:29:04.053]  But his compromises only make them think he's weak.
[00:29:04.053 --> 00:29:07.754]  So I just hope he just continues to steamroller right over the top of them, Roger Stone.
[00:29:09.375 --> 00:29:10.276]  Amen, brother.
[00:29:10.276 --> 00:29:10.716]  I'm with you 100%.
[00:29:21.618 --> 00:29:35.547]  You can help the fight for a free press in the First Amendment by going to InfoWarsStore.com and getting your copy of The Making of the President 2016 or any of the great products there.
[00:29:35.547 --> 00:29:40.411]  This is crucial if we're going to have a vibrant and robust alternative media.
[00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:40.831]  That's right.
[00:29:40.831 --> 00:29:41.351]  Thank you.
[00:29:41.351 --> 00:29:42.032]  We're changing the world.
[00:29:42.032 --> 00:29:42.992]  That's why we're under attack.
[00:29:42.992 --> 00:29:45.794]  Our listeners are the backbone of the restoration of human liberty.
[00:29:45.794 --> 00:29:46.535]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:46.535 --> 00:29:46.935]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.202 --> 00:29:53.148]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.148 --> 00:29:55.832]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.367 --> 00:30:06.770]  Last week, InfoWars.com published the article, Bombshell Study Proves Unvaccinated Children Are Healthier Than Vaccinated Children.
[00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:11.092]  The two studies were pulled from the Journal of Transitional Science without any explanation.
[00:30:11.092 --> 00:30:16.354]  The studies surveyed parents of 666 homeschooled children, 39% who were not vaccinated.
[00:30:16.354 --> 00:30:21.597]  When asked about allergies, 22% of vaccinated children were shown to have allergies, while only 6.9% were unvaccinated.
[00:30:21.597 --> 00:30:23.698]  Autism, 4.7% were vaccinated versus 1% unvaccinated.
[00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:31.842]  So of course there's going to be pushback when a study like this comes out proving that vaccines are not really safe.
[00:30:31.842 --> 00:30:35.145]  And people are going to come out and attack it and say, oh, they just talked to parents.
[00:30:35.145 --> 00:30:37.326]  Or they'll say, oh, there was a bias in the study.
[00:30:37.326 --> 00:30:39.408]  These people think vaccines are unsafe.
[00:30:39.408 --> 00:30:40.909]  One, the study proves they're unsafe.
[00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:45.432]  And two, any other vaccine study is done and paid for by the pharmaceutical companies.
[00:30:45.432 --> 00:30:47.313]  Of course, they think vaccines are safe.
[00:30:47.313 --> 00:30:50.896]  Just go to our article, Bombshell Study Proves Unvaccinated Children Are Healthier.
[00:30:50.916 --> 00:30:52.597]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:30:52.597 --> 00:30:54.499]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:30:54.499 --> 00:30:55.720]  It's the air we're breathing.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.081]  Especially for our children.
[00:30:57.081 --> 00:30:58.001]  The artificial particulates.
[00:30:58.001 --> 00:30:58.802]  The chemicals.
[00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:12.933]  This is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:12.933 --> 00:31:22.120]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:29.666]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:29.666 --> 00:31:37.712]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:37.712 --> 00:31:38.653]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:39.876 --> 00:31:43.240]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.384]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:47.384 --> 00:31:54.091]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:54.091 --> 00:31:58.196]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:00.515 --> 00:32:02.356]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:32:02.356 --> 00:32:08.938]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:32:08.938 --> 00:32:12.099]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslive.com.
[00:32:12.099 --> 00:32:21.883]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:32:21.883 --> 00:32:22.723]  Caveman.
[00:32:22.723 --> 00:32:27.805]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:32:27.805 --> 00:32:29.926]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:32:30.206 --> 00:32:33.367]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:32:33.367 --> 00:32:38.509]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:46.652]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:32:46.652 --> 00:32:54.595]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:32:54.595 --> 00:32:59.237]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and 4WarsLife.com today.
[00:33:06.798 --> 00:33:07.579]  Good evening.
[00:33:07.579 --> 00:33:15.669]  There are reports tonight that President Nixon has ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire the special Watergate prosecutor, Archibald Cox.
[00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:19.174]  Scholars are comparing this to Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre.
[00:33:19.174 --> 00:33:20.515]  What do you make of those comparisons?
[00:33:20.515 --> 00:33:21.537]  Well, I think that's ridiculous.
[00:33:22.297 --> 00:33:25.140]  This is just the most preposterous pretext.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:30.245]  This is an investigator who is investigating the White House.
[00:33:30.245 --> 00:33:33.888]  And he was just fired by the White House.
[00:33:33.888 --> 00:33:39.233]  This doesn't happen in the United States, except on October 20th, 1973, when Richard Nixon fired Archibald Cox.
[00:33:42.456 --> 00:33:44.217]  People see this as a real threat.
[00:33:44.217 --> 00:33:49.120]  I think we've taken a step away from rule of law, toward the rule of a small group of people.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.921]  And I also want to say that as a result of that, I feel vindicated.
[00:33:51.921 --> 00:33:56.544]  Because I said that Donald Trump had become president, and he has become president.
[00:33:56.544 --> 00:33:57.604]  President Nixon.
[00:33:57.604 --> 00:34:02.467]  It just harkens back, I think, to some of the most tainted actions by President Nixon.
[00:34:03.127 --> 00:34:13.929]  Let's remember that we face a looming constitutional crisis, very much like happened in 1973, the Midnight Massacre.
[00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:21.850]  This episode has very much the feel of that chapter in our history, one that we should not repeat.
[00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:25.231]  Hawks, Archibald, Hawks, fire them!
[00:34:33.928 --> 00:34:35.829]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:40.012]  I think I should just open the phones up and play some clips of what's been unfolding.
[00:34:40.012 --> 00:34:47.757]  But this really makes me feel good about President Trump in that he has fired Comey.
[00:34:47.757 --> 00:34:54.802]  Comey that stood there while Loretta Lynch met on airplanes with Bill Clinton breaking the law while he was under criminal investigation.
[00:34:54.802 --> 00:35:00.226]  Lynch who sat there with all the WikiLeaks info coming out, how they were coordinating with the White House on the cover-up crimes.
[00:35:03.735 --> 00:35:06.736]  The uranium deals to Russia, the sellout of our technology to China.
[00:35:06.736 --> 00:35:14.318]  I mean, the Clintons have been protected by the FBI for decades from the highest levels committing their crimes.
[00:35:14.318 --> 00:35:22.621]  And then all the WikiLeaks pedophile information that the New York Police Department wanted to release but the FBI basically shut down.
[00:35:24.673 --> 00:35:28.774]  Now, am I saying the FBI are evil people on average?
[00:35:28.774 --> 00:35:29.834]  Certainly not.
[00:35:29.834 --> 00:35:35.316]  In fact, it's some of the most anti-globalist folks out there are mid-level FBI agents who are aware of what's happening.
[00:35:35.316 --> 00:35:39.817]  But at the top of this country, it is just incredibly corrupt.
[00:35:39.817 --> 00:35:48.439]  And Donald Trump is restoring our military, restoring our sovereignty, restoring our economy, restoring our pride.
[00:35:48.439 --> 00:35:51.420]  If Russia was our enemy, and if Russia was controlling
[00:35:52.551 --> 00:35:56.373]  President Trump, they would not be doing any of this.
[00:35:56.373 --> 00:36:02.756]  The first thing a Russian compromised operative would do would keep coal banned.
[00:36:02.756 --> 00:36:12.741]  They have enough coal for over a thousand years with clean burning systems in the United States, conservatively.
[00:36:12.741 --> 00:36:18.224]  There's more coal than natural gas, oil, you name it combined.
[00:36:18.224 --> 00:36:20.225]  And when Trump said all that coal is back on the table,
[00:36:21.866 --> 00:36:29.411]  It made gas prices in Russia plunge, and that's Russia's main export.
[00:36:29.411 --> 00:36:32.753]  But see, that's if you're actually geopolitically informed.
[00:36:32.753 --> 00:36:35.294]  It wasn't to hurt Russia, it's to help the United States.
[00:36:35.294 --> 00:36:36.935]  Sorry!
[00:36:36.935 --> 00:36:39.497]  That's the kind of stuff Trump did.
[00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:49.963]  The globalists actually had deals multinationally with the Saudi Arabians and others to not bring the coal online, to not bring the oil online.
[00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:54.491]  And Trump's ending all that.
[00:36:54.491 --> 00:37:00.632]  Now, some will argue that it'll drive down energy prices so low that it causes some type of stall out in the economy.
[00:37:00.632 --> 00:37:01.972]  Trump's just letting the free market in.
[00:37:01.972 --> 00:37:03.593]  He thinks it'll correct itself.
[00:37:03.593 --> 00:37:12.095]  And so far, you see amazing exuberance in the economy, right as the time we were going over the edge of an economic cliff.
[00:37:12.095 --> 00:37:19.136]  So, I have seen people go from being totally enthusiastic about Trump to by about 100 days in, we're now 111 days in,
[00:37:22.659 --> 00:37:27.060]  Really being disillusioned with President Trump.
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:46.624]  One bellwether example of that is that we were selling probably 500 Trump Pence 2020 shirts a day until about day 70 when Trump started to go sideways with that bad health care bill and then the going after Assange and those are some big, big black marks.
[00:37:48.157 --> 00:37:52.038]  Pockmarks on the face of Trump's agenda.
[00:37:52.038 --> 00:37:54.799]  And I don't know why he did those things.
[00:37:54.799 --> 00:37:57.739]  A lot of it is his adjuncts are just doing whatever they want.
[00:37:57.739 --> 00:38:01.000]  Like McMaster and others.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:01.800]  I like Sessions.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.021]  He's a good, honorable man.
[00:38:03.021 --> 00:38:12.043]  I agree with him about 90% of stuff, but he wants to go back to like 1960s laws where you get locked up for 10 years in prison for a marijuana cigarette?
[00:38:12.043 --> 00:38:12.843]  That's just ridiculous.
[00:38:16.937 --> 00:38:18.717]  The drug war is a joke.
[00:38:18.717 --> 00:38:20.238]  Does that mean I agree with the drug culture?
[00:38:20.238 --> 00:38:21.458]  Absolutely not.
[00:38:21.458 --> 00:38:24.639]  I'm just saying, the way it's working isn't working.
[00:38:24.639 --> 00:38:27.779]  Mexico is the second most dangerous country in the world.
[00:38:27.779 --> 00:38:32.240]  130,000 people in the last decade killed there that they know of.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.641]  Something like 200,000 missing.
[00:38:35.641 --> 00:38:41.642]  Talk about 300 plus thousand people.
[00:38:41.642 --> 00:38:44.343]  And we don't want to end up like that, folks.
[00:38:44.343 --> 00:38:45.383]  That's the drug war for you.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.062]  Look at Chicago.
[00:38:50.062 --> 00:38:55.227]  The only place in this hemisphere more dangerous than Mexico City.
[00:38:55.227 --> 00:38:55.867]  Chicago.
[00:38:55.867 --> 00:38:57.689]  People are fleeing Chicago en masse.
[00:38:57.689 --> 00:39:01.953]  We had a story about that yesterday that was linked up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:39:01.953 --> 00:39:03.214]  I want to give the toll-free number out.
[00:39:03.214 --> 00:39:04.616]  I want to take your phone calls.
[00:39:04.616 --> 00:39:05.496]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[00:39:05.496 --> 00:39:05.536]  800-259-9231.
[00:39:13.427 --> 00:39:19.972]  I look at President Trump, and I look at the good, new Supreme Court justice.
[00:39:19.972 --> 00:39:23.714]  I look at the word that Kennedy's going to be stepping down soon.
[00:39:23.714 --> 00:39:27.257]  These are godsends.
[00:39:27.257 --> 00:39:41.787]  The fact that he's got, what, 10 new judges that are all super conservative going in this month, and then hundreds more vacancies are about to be filled, and every person he's getting is hardcore conservative, hardcore constitutionalist.
[00:39:42.765 --> 00:39:45.087]  I mean, night and day compared to the Democrats.
[00:39:45.087 --> 00:39:47.388]  Absolute night and day.
[00:39:47.388 --> 00:39:51.031]  He is delivering.
[00:39:51.031 --> 00:40:06.782]  If he wasn't delivering on our agenda, the globalists wouldn't be calling for his death and his destruction, his impeachment, his overthrow 24-7.
[00:40:06.782 --> 00:40:08.524]  So again, you're selling 500 shirts a day.
[00:40:08.524 --> 00:40:09.785]  This isn't about selling the shirts.
[00:40:11.055 --> 00:40:12.576]  It's a bellwether.
[00:40:12.576 --> 00:40:19.241]  And then you start selling 30, 40, 50 a day after he starts going sideways.
[00:40:19.241 --> 00:40:25.226]  Listen, we need winner patriots, not sunshine patriots.
[00:40:25.226 --> 00:40:38.496]  If you don't see Trump isn't moving the ball down the field by light years, if you don't see the enemy is absolutely crapping their drawers, if you don't see the fact that global corporate crony capitalism
[00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:43.291]  Is a nightmare system and that Trump's opposing it.
[00:40:43.291 --> 00:40:48.091]  And using that system to our advantage now, then you're not paying attention.
[00:40:48.091 --> 00:40:53.052]  I'm not even a pragmatist about this.
[00:40:53.052 --> 00:40:57.113]  I'm a purist in what I do, so that we can try to set a benchmark.
[00:40:57.113 --> 00:41:04.974]  But the fact is, Trump is winning 9 out of 10 rounds with the globalists right now.
[00:41:04.974 --> 00:41:07.595]  And he's compromising on some issues to get it done with Congress.
[00:41:09.619 --> 00:41:17.703]  And I like how the second bill that's now passed the House is much better than the first one.
[00:41:17.703 --> 00:41:19.784]  So the process is starting to actually work.
[00:41:19.784 --> 00:41:23.386]  Trump's getting a lot done that's good.
[00:41:23.386 --> 00:41:24.907]  That's why they hate him.
[00:41:24.907 --> 00:41:25.787]  That's why I'm supporting him.
[00:41:25.787 --> 00:41:28.469]  And this Comey thing is so good.
[00:41:28.469 --> 00:41:28.989]  It's good.
[00:41:33.447 --> 00:41:40.150]  And we have to understand that the old Republican leadership, most of them are just a bunch of country club people.
[00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:42.651]  They were put into power because they're yes men.
[00:41:42.651 --> 00:41:47.493]  They're a bunch of lawyers who played ball for 20, 30 years before they even get into Congress.
[00:41:47.493 --> 00:41:51.615]  And you look at all those cowards, Republican and Democrat, in the Senate and the House.
[00:41:52.475 --> 00:41:56.616]  The old blue bloods that are in there, they are so scared to death of mainstream media.
[00:41:56.616 --> 00:41:58.516]  They think Bill Maher's cool.
[00:41:58.516 --> 00:42:00.616]  They think Stephen Colbert is really cool.
[00:42:00.616 --> 00:42:02.137]  They think TV's impressive.
[00:42:02.137 --> 00:42:07.678]  They think it's a big deal to be on the news and they're all proud to be on CNN and Fox.
[00:42:07.678 --> 00:42:11.178]  It's an embarrassment to be on those shows playing along with all that.
[00:42:11.178 --> 00:42:14.719]  That's the old world, the old facade rotting, decayed.
[00:42:14.719 --> 00:42:19.840]  Another big wind blows by, it's going to completely collapse.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.060]  Much of it has already fallen down.
[00:42:22.662 --> 00:42:32.613]  And so they really are scared when they get home that their wife or their husband will say, I saw you getting bashed on TV or you don't want to get called a Russian agent.
[00:42:32.613 --> 00:42:35.497]  When that's the old, dying facade.
[00:42:35.497 --> 00:42:38.981]  Trump knows it's an old, dying facade.
[00:42:38.981 --> 00:42:40.582]  It's the corrupt takeover.
[00:42:40.582 --> 00:42:42.545]  For the last 50 years in this country.
[00:42:42.545 --> 00:42:43.326]  It's illegitimate.
[00:42:44.127 --> 00:42:45.428]  It's authoritarian.
[00:42:45.428 --> 00:42:50.333]  It's anti-free market and anti-American fundamentally because it wants to mount our head on the wall.
[00:42:50.333 --> 00:42:53.136]  It had to struggle for decades to get control.
[00:42:53.136 --> 00:42:57.501]  And it doesn't like real competition.
[00:42:57.501 --> 00:42:59.423]  It doesn't like strength.
[00:42:59.423 --> 00:43:01.045]  It doesn't like honorable systems.
[00:43:01.045 --> 00:43:03.087]  It's a ruling elite that want high tech.
[00:43:04.397 --> 00:43:05.758]  Feudalism.
[00:43:05.758 --> 00:43:09.181]  Dumbed down, servile, idiot populations.
[00:43:09.181 --> 00:43:10.842]  Educated to be morons.
[00:43:10.842 --> 00:43:12.443]  Educated idiots.
[00:43:12.443 --> 00:43:16.006]  It's in the social engineering codes for a hundred years.
[00:43:16.006 --> 00:43:20.569]  The big banking associations wrote letters and had quarterly meetings about it in the 1890s.
[00:43:20.569 --> 00:43:22.671]  We've got too many educated people.
[00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:23.992]  Everybody's reading.
[00:43:23.992 --> 00:43:25.192]  Everybody knows too much.
[00:43:25.192 --> 00:43:26.593]  They're totally unruly.
[00:43:26.593 --> 00:43:30.076]  We've got to get public education in place and dumb these people down.
[00:43:30.076 --> 00:43:31.137]  We've got to get full control.
[00:43:37.642 --> 00:43:40.684]  And they've done it to a great extent.
[00:43:40.684 --> 00:43:41.424]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:43:41.424 --> 00:43:44.907]  You get half the population sucking their thumb and not knowing which end is up.
[00:43:44.907 --> 00:43:47.668]  Can't find the rear end with both hands.
[00:43:47.668 --> 00:43:49.509]  The elite want people like that to control them.
[00:43:49.509 --> 00:43:55.533]  But imagine when there's not many people that are actually informed and involved.
[00:43:55.533 --> 00:43:59.736]  It's almost an advantage to those of us that know the truth because there's so many more of us that are awake.
[00:44:00.674 --> 00:44:02.795]  Then there are the tiny globalist group.
[00:44:02.795 --> 00:44:18.079]  See, you've got the big mass of dumb dumb people, you've got a large mass of people that's still a minority that knows what's going on, then you've got the tiny elite that knows what's going on, helped induce the stupidity of the masses, and is hoping we'll just join them on feeding on the idiots.
[00:44:18.079 --> 00:44:21.500]  But if you turn the public into animals, it blows back on your family.
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.601]  You don't escape that culture.
[00:44:24.601 --> 00:44:26.302]  You don't escape all the gangster culture.
[00:44:26.302 --> 00:44:28.043]  You don't escape all this trash out there.
[00:44:28.043 --> 00:44:33.845]  That's the elite's greatest lie to themselves is you can do horrible things to people and not have it come back on you.
[00:44:33.845 --> 00:44:40.268]  That's not how the universe works, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:40.268 --> 00:44:41.769]  And that's how the elites operate, Zach.
[00:44:41.769 --> 00:44:43.050]  Real charming, real nice.
[00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:45.471]  Come on, Alex.
[00:44:45.471 --> 00:44:46.711]  We used to be like you.
[00:44:46.711 --> 00:44:47.672]  We used to be romantics.
[00:44:49.121 --> 00:44:50.862]  You're not going to succeed in this crusade.
[00:44:50.862 --> 00:44:55.045]  You'll either be a star or fail.
[00:44:55.045 --> 00:44:57.267]  The public wants to tear you apart.
[00:44:57.267 --> 00:44:58.408]  They're never going to care about you.
[00:44:58.408 --> 00:44:59.989]  They're never going to like you.
[00:44:59.989 --> 00:45:02.571]  You can't help them.
[00:45:02.571 --> 00:45:11.257]  You just need to join us and hope you can influence things for the better, being part of the actual elite.
[00:45:11.257 --> 00:45:15.080]  And that's the speech you get over and over again.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:15.961]  That's the speech you get.
[00:45:17.892 --> 00:45:20.633]  Do the right thing for your family, Alex.
[00:45:20.633 --> 00:45:22.753]  Just join us.
[00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:24.074]  You can trust us.
[00:45:24.074 --> 00:45:26.534]  We want to work with you.
[00:45:26.534 --> 00:45:28.535]  You see how it all works?
[00:45:28.535 --> 00:45:30.875]  Even a lot of our high-level people don't get the whole thing.
[00:45:30.875 --> 00:45:35.856]  We could really use somebody like you.
[00:45:35.856 --> 00:45:38.117]  And you're supposed to go, oh really?
[00:45:38.117 --> 00:45:40.097]  I can fly around on the private helicopters and jets.
[00:45:40.097 --> 00:45:42.178]  I can, they'll be part of this whole system.
[00:45:44.735 --> 00:45:52.103]  And then I could be a vampire, culturally, and play along with the deception and wage war against my own species.
[00:45:52.103 --> 00:45:52.583]  You know what?
[00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:59.451]  No thank you.
[00:45:59.451 --> 00:46:03.215]  And now here we are.
[00:46:03.215 --> 00:46:05.858]  More than 18 years after I refused the first buy-off.
[00:46:08.206 --> 00:46:12.708]  And you can see, we changed the world together and we're making it a better place.
[00:46:12.708 --> 00:46:19.752]  And we're turning the corner because we believe in humanity, we believe in justice, we believe in prosperity, we believe in God.
[00:46:19.752 --> 00:46:22.473]  We don't believe in evil.
[00:46:22.473 --> 00:46:27.136]  We don't use evil systems just because it can advance us.
[00:46:27.136 --> 00:46:32.098]  Physically, monetarily, temporally.
[00:46:32.098 --> 00:46:34.780]  Because you use that power, the ring,
[00:46:36.837 --> 00:46:38.558]  The Rings of Power is an archetype.
[00:46:38.558 --> 00:46:41.259]  You use evil technology.
[00:46:41.259 --> 00:46:43.280]  You use systems of deception.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.761]  The knowledge of evil.
[00:46:46.761 --> 00:46:53.804]  It poisons the world and poisons you and then you don't even recognize why you get more and more evil once you get into it.
[00:46:53.804 --> 00:47:00.567]  It's because it's a virus in your soul and it's slowly taking you over until one day you never wake up.
[00:47:01.604 --> 00:47:12.152]  And something else is running you, and now you've given over your psyche, your soul, it's like a brain transplant has been put into your body, and you're dead.
[00:47:12.152 --> 00:47:24.922]  You're cut off from God, and you're just some empty, robotic, biological android, replicate demon, roaming around at award shows, and posing, and into your own little emptiness.
[00:47:24.922 --> 00:47:28.005]  I have been around billionaires, globalists, sellouts to the system.
[00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:32.911]  And they're like scared robots.
[00:47:32.911 --> 00:47:41.157]  They're just like crazed, weird, fumbling morons.
[00:47:41.157 --> 00:47:48.762]  And then there are people who are in the system but still have a soul and they're totally freaked out and scared.
[00:47:51.089 --> 00:47:57.714]  And the system's there to intimidate them, try to take their money away, try to destroy them, go after their families, if they dare stick their head up.
[00:47:57.714 --> 00:48:03.979]  And Hollywood's the worst model of control and all the quote, beautiful people that go there to be somebody.
[00:48:03.979 --> 00:48:05.721]  And Hollywood didn't make them somebody.
[00:48:05.721 --> 00:48:12.126]  Hollywood stole their greatness and then created a fiction around it.
[00:48:12.126 --> 00:48:15.829]  When they could have gone out in the world and built whole new systems.
[00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:19.210]  But they had it stolen from them.
[00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.711]  It's like the devil convinces you you can sell your soul.
[00:48:21.711 --> 00:48:23.932]  You can't sell your soul.
[00:48:23.932 --> 00:48:35.135]  You can convince yourself you've sold your soul, like the Faustian deal, but never know you could get out of it at any time.
[00:48:35.135 --> 00:48:40.677]  The devil doesn't give you any of this.
[00:48:40.677 --> 00:48:43.738]  The devil just kind of steps out of your way
[00:48:45.305 --> 00:48:56.788]  As long as you're used as a tool to hurt other people and then let you have power within this false system when you already had the birthright and the full control of the planet from the day you were born.
[00:48:56.788 --> 00:49:00.989]  The devil was put in there in front of that like a gatekeeper that you've got to make it through.
[00:49:00.989 --> 00:49:08.751]  Instead of interfacing with the devil, this whole system, and having your destiny stolen from you.
[00:49:08.751 --> 00:49:10.571]  We're going to go to break, come back.
[00:49:10.571 --> 00:49:11.672]  I'm going to start taking your phone calls.
[00:49:11.672 --> 00:49:12.772]  Got a bunch of clips to get to as well.
[00:49:13.982 --> 00:49:24.842]  If listeners will just commit to spreading the articles, the videos every day to friends and family and neighbors and community and strangers or just tell people about the local stations you're listening to or send in a hundred dollars to the different stations you're listening to.
[00:49:25.779 --> 00:49:26.300]  We're good to go.
[00:49:50.094 --> 00:49:51.455]  We are about to sell out of DNA Force.
[00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:54.356]  We're about to sell out of X2, the good halogen.
[00:49:54.356 --> 00:49:57.017]  Find out why it's so special.
[00:49:57.017 --> 00:50:00.739]  We have a review of the day from RainForce, from Lineman101, 84PA.
[00:50:05.384 --> 00:50:06.265]  They're telling you the truth.
[00:50:06.265 --> 00:50:10.688]  This supplement really is amazing, giving me a positive, highly focused attitude throughout the day.
[00:50:10.688 --> 00:50:15.412]  Excellent memory recall and smooth, consistent throughout process to multitask different projects simultaneously.
[00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:19.755]  All of this without the crash you get from caffeine, without the next day fog of other supplements.
[00:50:19.755 --> 00:50:23.138]  I have and will continue to recommend Brain Force Plus to everyone I know.
[00:50:23.138 --> 00:50:26.701]  Now it's got 20% more each bottle.
[00:50:26.701 --> 00:50:31.164]  Go see the thousands and thousands of reviews on third-party sites like Power Reviews and Infowarsstore.com.
[00:50:35.003 --> 00:50:40.467]  And know that you're getting great products and you're also funding the Temple Spirit and the fight against the globalists so we can be strong.
[00:50:40.467 --> 00:50:42.109]  That's why they hate free markets.
[00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:51.296]  Because you can vote for quality and vote for things that culturally support your vision of the world and then you can empower and create communities.
[00:50:51.296 --> 00:50:56.921]  The globalists want centralized systems to siphon off all your money and wealth to build systems that are anti-human.
[00:50:56.921 --> 00:50:58.142]  That's why they want to kill free market.
[00:51:00.037 --> 00:51:00.197]  I think?
[00:51:19.241 --> 00:51:19.661]  We're good.
[00:51:37.071 --> 00:51:40.193]  No wonder Avant has an A-plus rating from the Better Business Bureau.

[00:52:59.076 --> 00:53:04.180]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:09.884]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:53:09.884 --> 00:53:15.089]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.

[00:54:25.726 --> 00:54:34.709]  We have a highly entrenched, dug-in, multinational crime syndicate that calls itself globalism.
[00:54:34.709 --> 00:54:50.315]  Globalism is simply a means to an end to carry out their eugenics program of the technotronic silicon merger with human lifeforms and their advanced species off-world breakaway civilization DARPA program.
[00:54:52.304 --> 00:54:55.766]  Now, I told you about that 19 years ago is when I really learned about it.
[00:54:55.766 --> 00:54:58.607]  I've been on air a few years.
[00:54:58.607 --> 00:55:04.029]  And now you notice it's Elon Musk, everything I said, word for word, all over the news, every day.
[00:55:04.029 --> 00:55:07.891]  They're just normalizing it all right now.
[00:55:07.891 --> 00:55:09.292]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:55:09.292 --> 00:55:10.232]  We're in the year 2017.
[00:55:10.232 --> 00:55:16.255]  The globalist technology, 2050.
[00:55:16.255 --> 00:55:18.456]  They already believe they have sentient AI computers.
[00:55:20.185 --> 00:55:25.428]  Let's just say they're good enough to fool top engineers.
[00:55:25.428 --> 00:55:31.672]  It doesn't matter if they don't have a soul or aren't conscious because they're wired in to billions of people's actions every day.
[00:55:31.672 --> 00:55:43.499]  And they can build algorithms to track everything you do and predict what you're going to do before you even know it.
[00:55:43.499 --> 00:55:46.341]  The end of free will.
[00:55:46.341 --> 00:55:47.582]  Total digital enslavement.
[00:55:50.563 --> 00:55:51.744]  The de-evolution of man.
[00:55:51.744 --> 00:55:58.046]  And they're getting us ready for it, saying no mothers and no fathers.
[00:55:58.046 --> 00:56:01.068]  No family unit.
[00:56:01.068 --> 00:56:07.670]  No, just take drugs and watch TV and just bliss out.
[00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:19.216]  And you're journeying towards... Species extinction will be complete.
[00:56:19.216 --> 00:56:20.176]  Very selfish move.
[00:56:22.952 --> 00:56:29.677]  And the people running the planet are creating new species as fast as they can, every few hours, a new species is created.
[00:56:29.677 --> 00:56:32.920]  A new species.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.781]  A new species of virus.
[00:56:34.781 --> 00:56:36.763]  A new species of bacteria.
[00:56:36.763 --> 00:56:43.148]  A new species of animal, slash plant, slash insectoid, slash silicon.
[00:56:43.148 --> 00:56:46.410]  It's already here.
[00:56:46.410 --> 00:56:48.372]  Synthetic nanotech humanoids.
[00:56:50.947 --> 00:56:53.647]  Yeah, the robot cats were back in the 60s.
[00:56:53.647 --> 00:56:55.188]  The robot rats were in the 80s.
[00:56:55.188 --> 00:56:56.428]  The robot roaches in the 70s.
[00:56:56.428 --> 00:57:03.749]  It's beyond robots now, boys and girls.
[00:57:03.749 --> 00:57:11.350]  I want to go to Robert, Beth, Ben, Adam, Harry, good, all of you.
[00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:14.231]  But you've got to ask yourself, why is this broadcast so hated?
[00:57:14.231 --> 00:57:18.372]  It's the same reason Trump's hated.
[00:57:18.372 --> 00:57:20.292]  Because we believe in human empowerment.
[00:57:21.311 --> 00:57:25.794]  We believe in free market, we believe in open societies.
[00:57:25.794 --> 00:57:31.158]  Notice, George Soros calls his group the open society because he wants the opposite of an open society.
[00:57:31.158 --> 00:57:36.242]  He wants to import the rapeugees so we can bow to them.
[00:57:36.242 --> 00:57:37.103]  It's disgusting.
[00:57:37.103 --> 00:57:37.984]  Alright, I'm going to go to break.
[00:57:37.984 --> 00:57:42.067]  I promise I'm going to come back and go right to Ben and Adam and Harry and Robert and Beth and everybody else.
[00:57:42.067 --> 00:57:44.388]  Toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:57:44.388 --> 00:57:48.812]  I don't think, I know, Trump needs to go on the offense against the criminals.
[00:57:49.701 --> 00:57:52.563]  You are offensively trying to launch a totalitarian takeover, Democrats.
[00:57:52.563 --> 00:57:53.544]  And I got a little news for you.
[00:57:53.544 --> 00:57:54.325]  Turnabout's fair play.
[00:58:20.319 --> 00:58:23.920]  All's fair in love and war.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.700]  And so, we'll see if Trump's for real.
[00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:36.662]  Because if he doesn't move offensively against them when he has the constitutional right and duty, he will be destroyed by his inaction.
[00:58:36.662 --> 00:58:40.463]  We'll be back with hour number two.
[00:58:40.463 --> 00:58:41.823]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:41.823 --> 00:58:45.164]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.191 --> 00:58:58.157]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[00:58:58.157 --> 00:59:04.822]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:59:04.822 --> 00:59:13.088]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:59:13.368 --> 00:59:19.236]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[00:59:19.236 --> 00:59:22.400]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:28.148]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:59:28.488 --> 00:59:29.249]  It works.
[00:59:29.249 --> 00:59:37.575]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:59:37.575 --> 00:59:47.462]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWareStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the InfoWare against the globalists all at the same time.
[00:59:47.462 --> 00:59:52.626]  A total 360 win!
[00:59:52.626 --> 00:59:55.308]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:12.648 --> 01:00:29.597]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[01:00:29.597 --> 01:00:31.638]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.719 --> 01:00:39.980]  We are back live, hour number two.
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:46.921]  I'm going to take your phone calls until we're joined by Mark Moreno, Climate Depot.
[01:00:46.921 --> 01:00:50.802]  Looking at Al Gore's new incredible load of bologna, part two.
[01:00:50.802 --> 01:00:54.503]  An inconvenient load of horse manure, part two.
[01:00:54.503 --> 01:01:06.286]  And then we will have Mike Cernovich popping in to tell us about some of the big leaks he's going to be breaking down today in the fourth hour when he hosts the fourth hour that CNN and a bunch of other publications and outfits have just been dreading.
[01:01:07.293 --> 01:01:10.254]  I do intend to add a lot of other talk show hosts here in the near future.
[01:01:10.254 --> 01:01:19.997]  We're just busy getting the board operators and producers and everybody lined up to probably go, I don't know, 10 hours a day live, and then 16, 18 hours a day live TV slash radio.
[01:01:19.997 --> 01:01:23.678]  So that's going to be happening in the next two to six months, adding that in.
[01:01:23.678 --> 01:01:29.240]  I still haven't gotten to the phase of putting all that in place, but we're very, very close.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.421]  As I told you three years ago, we're going to take the info war to the next level.
[01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:32.961]  We're going to change the world.
[01:01:32.961 --> 01:01:34.882]  Every few years, I tell you, we're going to go to the next level now.
[01:01:35.953 --> 01:01:42.635]  And through the grace of God and your prayers and support, we then shed our skin and grow to the next level.
[01:01:42.635 --> 01:01:45.536]  And so we're doing that in the face of unprecedented attack.
[01:01:45.536 --> 01:01:49.457]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, we are making it through even stronger.
[01:01:49.457 --> 01:01:53.698]  Ben in PA, thank you for holding, you're on the air.
[01:01:53.698 --> 01:01:56.159]  Hi Alex, finally glad to be able to get to talk to you.
[01:01:56.159 --> 01:01:57.119]  Been trying for a week.
[01:01:57.119 --> 01:02:04.101]  I just wanted to mention something here about James Comey and I think it's
[01:02:05.129 --> 01:02:07.575]  Fantastic that Trump got rid of him.
[01:02:07.575 --> 01:02:11.123]  I think it's the best thing that he's done since being sworn in.
[01:02:11.123 --> 01:02:14.832]  I mean, I think if anything is going to rally his base, it's going to be this.
[01:02:16.095 --> 01:02:19.678]  Absolutely, and Comey was just arrogant and did whatever he wanted.
[01:02:19.678 --> 01:02:24.080]  We're just sick of these rogue agencies and rogue bureaucracies.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.961]  I think Trump ought to sack them all.
[01:02:25.961 --> 01:02:30.284]  He ought to just go after anybody that's sitting there trying to stand in the way of restoring our republic.
[01:02:30.284 --> 01:02:33.406]  You've got a bunch of foreign globalists that have hijacked the country.
[01:02:33.406 --> 01:02:34.587]  Get out of the way, man!
[01:02:34.587 --> 01:02:36.067]  Get out of the way!
[01:02:36.067 --> 01:02:38.109]  Quite frankly, this globalist invasion is so bad.
[01:02:39.264 --> 01:02:41.148]  Trump can call the military out and have them all arrested.
[01:02:41.148 --> 01:02:42.070]  I'd support it.
[01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:47.280]  Because they're a bunch of foreign globalists that have hijacked the country, and I want their asses kicked out of here.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.725]  George Washington would have arrested them a long time ago.
[01:02:49.725 --> 01:02:50.246]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:02:51.477 --> 01:02:55.340]  Oh, they'd be tarred and feathered if Washington was still here.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:56.881]  It's fantastic.
[01:02:56.881 --> 01:03:01.584]  I mean, he did get a little sideways there, and I think it's all of our right to criticize him when he does, you know?
[01:03:01.584 --> 01:03:02.985]  I mean, that's natural.
[01:03:02.985 --> 01:03:06.968]  We don't want to fall in line like the liberals did with Obama.
[01:03:06.968 --> 01:03:08.269]  That's right.
[01:03:08.269 --> 01:03:09.030]  But I just love it.
[01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:11.652]  I mean, I think this is a rallying cry to all of us.
[01:03:11.652 --> 01:03:14.694]  This is something that says, hey, he's not been taken over.
[01:03:14.694 --> 01:03:15.935]  He's his own man.
[01:03:16.576 --> 01:03:17.537]  He's there.
[01:03:17.537 --> 01:03:21.281]  This is the start of draining the swamp, which is what I'm hoping for.
[01:03:21.281 --> 01:03:28.568]  I mean, this really points to, you know, hey, maybe Hillary Clinton could be thrown in jail, which she should be.
[01:03:28.568 --> 01:03:31.311]  I'm not going to say she will, but, you know, my fingers crossed.
[01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:31.912]  No, she should be.
[01:03:31.912 --> 01:03:36.096]  I mean, look, there's all this interlocking corruption, so nobody wants to bring somebody down.
[01:03:36.096 --> 01:03:38.558]  They're like too corrupt to fail, too corrupt to be brought down.
[01:03:38.558 --> 01:03:39.459]  We've got to do it.
[01:03:40.485 --> 01:03:40.926]  Right.
[01:04:01.354 --> 01:04:02.995]  I honestly, I was worried.
[01:04:02.995 --> 01:04:06.377]  You know, I'm not saying I got away from him because I was like, he needs our support.
[01:04:06.377 --> 01:04:10.140]  He needed to hear from us saying, you know, don't go sideways, stay the straight and narrow.
[01:04:12.148 --> 01:04:15.050]  Seeing this, you know, yesterday I was at my parents, visiting my parents.
[01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:24.376]  They live about an hour away, and we went, and this news broke, you know, I read it on InfoWars, and I read it out loud, and my dad, who, he's been in the hospital for seven weeks with ammonia.
[01:04:24.376 --> 01:04:25.637]  He just got home.
[01:04:25.637 --> 01:04:31.801]  And, you know, he jumped up and about to have clicked his heels, you know, that he fired Comey, got rid of him, and he's like, well, I'm just gonna- Absolutely.
[01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:35.983]  Comey and Lynch, they all deserve to be arrested, in my view.
[01:04:35.983 --> 01:04:39.166]  They stood there while Obama and the Clintons
[01:04:40.046 --> 01:04:48.617]  I mean, Obama has been caught with the Muslim Brotherhood overthrowing secular governments and our allies and putting dirtbag Wahhabists in.
[01:04:48.617 --> 01:04:50.760]  They all need to be arrested.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.522]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:53.964]  It's not authoritarianism.
[01:04:53.964 --> 01:04:55.366]  They're all traitors.
[01:04:55.366 --> 01:04:56.848]  Arrest them all.
[01:04:56.848 --> 01:04:57.369]  Thank you, brother.
[01:04:57.369 --> 01:04:57.889]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:06.503]  Last week, InfoWars.com published the article, Bombshell Study Proves Unvaccinated Children Are Healthier Than Vaccinated Children.
[01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:10.827]  The two studies were pulled from the Journal of Transitional Science without any explanation.
[01:05:10.827 --> 01:05:16.092]  The studies surveyed parents of 666 homeschooled children, 39% who were not vaccinated.
[01:05:16.092 --> 01:05:20.897]  When asked about allergies, 22% of vaccinated children were shown to have allergies, while only 6.9% were unvaccinated.
[01:05:22.498 --> 01:05:22.838]  Autism.
[01:05:22.838 --> 01:05:26.761]  4.7% were vaccinated versus 1% unvaccinated.
[01:05:26.761 --> 01:05:31.565]  So of course there's going to be pushback when a study like this comes out proving that vaccines are not really safe.
[01:05:31.565 --> 01:05:34.888]  And people are going to come out and attack it and say, oh, they just talked to parents.
[01:05:34.888 --> 01:05:37.069]  Or they'll say, oh, there was a bias in the study.
[01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:39.151]  These people think vaccines are unsafe.
[01:05:39.151 --> 01:05:40.652]  One, the study proves they're unsafe.
[01:05:40.652 --> 01:05:45.176]  And two, any other vaccine study is done and paid for by the pharmaceutical companies.
[01:05:45.176 --> 01:05:47.057]  Of course, they think vaccines are safe.
[01:05:47.057 --> 01:05:50.640]  Just go to our article, Bombshell Study Proves Unvaccinated Children Are Healthier.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:56.625]  We have archived links to the studies and you can see for yourself because drug companies will do anything to keep you from the truth.
[01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:59.808]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:05:59.808 --> 01:06:05.292]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:05.292 --> 01:06:07.374]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:06:07.374 --> 01:06:12.659]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:06:12.659 --> 01:06:16.422]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants that
[01:06:16.502 --> 01:06:19.945]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:06:19.945 --> 01:06:23.127]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:06:23.127 --> 01:06:27.011]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:06:27.011 --> 01:06:34.176]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:06:34.176 --> 01:06:39.581]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[01:06:39.841 --> 01:06:41.882]  Iodine, nano, silver, and more.
[01:06:41.882 --> 01:06:50.184]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[01:06:50.184 --> 01:06:58.466]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at Infowarslife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[01:06:59.517 --> 01:07:03.503]  A new shipment of Biotruth Selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:03.503 --> 01:07:04.984]  We've been sold out for months.
[01:07:04.984 --> 01:07:10.051]  Our one-of-a-kind Infowars Life Biotruth Selenium formula is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:10.051 --> 01:07:14.077]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:18.698]  Every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[01:07:18.698 --> 01:07:23.860]  But bio-true selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:27.321]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[01:07:27.321 --> 01:07:31.362]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[01:07:31.482 --> 01:07:39.566]  BioTrue Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[01:07:39.566 --> 01:07:44.469]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTrue Selenium before we sell it again.
[01:07:44.469 --> 01:07:52.993]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalists.
[01:07:52.993 --> 01:07:53.553]  A 360 win.
[01:07:53.553 --> 01:07:55.614]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[01:07:55.614 --> 01:07:57.115]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[01:07:57.115 --> 01:07:58.276]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:11.634 --> 01:08:29.544]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:29.544 --> 01:08:30.205]  Well, call me.
[01:08:30.967 --> 01:08:48.674]  The FBI director had been in four years, and acted like a giant fruit salad on two legs, who sat there while Loretta Lynch and all these other people committed just crimes in front of everybody.
[01:08:48.674 --> 01:08:54.376]  Let the Clinton Foundation run wild, let Obama sell us out to the Islamist.
[01:08:54.376 --> 01:08:58.018]  Obama got caught financing the Muslim Brotherhood, had CNN promoting the Arab Spring.
[01:08:58.018 --> 01:08:59.118]  I mean, good God, people!
[01:09:00.942 --> 01:09:04.424]  Lordy lordy, to quote Comey.
[01:09:04.424 --> 01:09:06.265]  This has been out of control.
[01:09:06.265 --> 01:09:09.467]  Completely and totally out of control.
[01:09:09.467 --> 01:09:13.429]  And I've said Trump has to go on the offense.
[01:09:13.429 --> 01:09:17.911]  Everything the Democrats say he is, is what they've been caught doing.
[01:09:17.911 --> 01:09:18.972]  Red-handed.
[01:09:18.972 --> 01:09:23.714]  Illegal server, lying about it to Congress, you go to jail.
[01:09:23.714 --> 01:09:27.056]  Hillary meeting secretly with Putin, all these business deals, you go to jail.
[01:09:30.555 --> 01:09:32.957]  But instead they want to delegitimize the election we had.
[01:09:32.957 --> 01:09:37.840]  And the special interests that have hijacked this country want to destroy our president.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:45.605]  They're never going to let him even compromise with them because they want to destroy the image of nationalism.
[01:09:45.605 --> 01:09:47.126]  They want to defeat that idea.
[01:09:47.126 --> 01:09:50.108]  Their whole world government's in crisis.
[01:09:50.108 --> 01:09:53.030]  The president can give them no quarter because they're not giving us any!
[01:09:54.187 --> 01:09:59.669]  I don't want to sit up here, and I've been on the air 20 plus years, and talk about arresting these globalists.
[01:09:59.669 --> 01:10:01.490]  They're the ones calling for civil war.
[01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:03.271]  They're the ones calling for everybody's death.
[01:10:03.271 --> 01:10:10.034]  They're the ones running around, foaming at the mouth, wanting physical confrontation with their anti-Fa communist idiots out beating up women everywhere.
[01:10:10.034 --> 01:10:14.215]  They're the ones looking for it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:14.215 --> 01:10:16.616]  Running their mouths.
[01:10:16.616 --> 01:10:17.877]  Trying to destroy this country.
[01:10:20.063 --> 01:10:29.566]  You're telling those of us that actually defend the Republic and don't compromise that we are foreign agents of Russia?
[01:10:29.566 --> 01:10:34.587]  Congressional hearings where they say Alex Jones is under criminal investigation, being directed by Russia.
[01:10:34.587 --> 01:10:37.048]  We believe he's being directed.
[01:10:37.048 --> 01:10:39.409]  Do I get subpoenaed?
[01:10:39.409 --> 01:10:46.031]  Any time in the past, if they were going to have somebody from the federal government, from the Board of Governors of the Federal Elections Commission,
[01:10:50.123 --> 01:10:53.984]  And the FCC testifying in the Armed Services Committee.
[01:10:53.984 --> 01:10:57.325]  I would get a subpoena and I would testify.
[01:10:57.325 --> 01:11:00.146]  The next day, or the day before.
[01:11:00.146 --> 01:11:01.346]  Not now.
[01:11:01.346 --> 01:11:03.447]  They just say, hmm, yeah.
[01:11:03.447 --> 01:11:07.008]  Another risky agent, Alex Jones.
[01:11:07.008 --> 01:11:08.768]  And that's meant to intimidate everybody.
[01:11:08.768 --> 01:11:11.189]  A bunch of globalist traitors.
[01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:13.410]  A bunch of scum trying to set up world government.
[01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:15.410]  Trying to transfer our sovereignty overseas.
[01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:17.271]  Trying to sell out all of our weapons systems to China.
[01:11:18.502 --> 01:11:24.827]  You're going to point your finger at me with no evidence because I don't want to have war with Russia?
[01:11:24.827 --> 01:11:26.889]  Because geopolitically they're not a threat?
[01:11:26.889 --> 01:11:28.630]  And then you're going to tell me I'm a traitor?
[01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:30.391]  No, you're the traitor.
[01:11:30.391 --> 01:11:32.293]  And you are the enemy.
[01:11:32.293 --> 01:11:34.855]  And you are the ones that need to be investigated.
[01:11:34.855 --> 01:11:36.676]  And you are the ones that need to be arrested.
[01:11:36.676 --> 01:11:43.602]  Because you're globalist stooges at those big multinational combine consortium groups and think tanks you go to
[01:11:44.042 --> 01:11:57.085]  Where you sit there with all your interfaced groups inside governments and corporations making sweetheart deals, insider trading, and everything else to screw this country over and parlay our power into your world government.
[01:11:57.085 --> 01:11:58.525]  I got news for you!
[01:11:58.525 --> 01:11:59.706]  You're the enemy!
[01:11:59.706 --> 01:12:06.287]  And the world is learning about it very, very fast.
[01:12:06.287 --> 01:12:08.048]  So I think Trump needs to go on the offense.
[01:12:08.048 --> 01:12:09.148]  This is a breath of fresh air.
[01:12:11.986 --> 01:12:15.529]  After his adjuncts told him to sign on to that horrible health care bill.
[01:12:15.529 --> 01:12:17.451]  We got a better one now.
[01:12:17.451 --> 01:12:19.252]  He's done some bad things, but overall some great things.
[01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:22.395]  So I'm backing Trump, but do you agree with me or disagree?
[01:12:22.395 --> 01:12:24.697]  He's got to go on the offense.
[01:12:24.697 --> 01:12:27.760]  He's got to go on the offense aggressively because it's his duty.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:34.766]  These people have committed crimes and they're openly in New Yorker Magazine and everywhere else trying to organize an overthrow of the president.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:42.001]  They're trying to have his own cabinet declare him mentally unsound because he actually won't sell out to them and he's not a yes-man.
[01:12:42.001 --> 01:12:52.523]  He is the 45th President of the United States and is actually executing faithfully his duties.
[01:12:52.523 --> 01:12:55.983]  And look at these arrogant clappers.
[01:12:55.983 --> 01:12:58.524]  And arrogant Brennans.
[01:12:58.524 --> 01:13:03.385]  The Wahhabist Brennan, two days before the President gets in, he says, watch your mouth, President.
[01:13:03.385 --> 01:13:05.565]  And they couldn't believe he got fired when Trump fired him.
[01:13:07.312 --> 01:13:08.712]  These people are out of their minds.
[01:13:08.712 --> 01:13:11.854]  We didn't elect Brennan.
[01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:14.254]  We didn't elect Comey.
[01:13:14.254 --> 01:13:22.277]  We're not going to have you sit here like a bunch of chihuahuas barking at the bull mastiff and telling it that you're the boss.
[01:13:22.277 --> 01:13:26.018]  We didn't elect you, chihuahua.
[01:13:26.018 --> 01:13:29.079]  Toy poodle, whatever it is you are.
[01:13:29.079 --> 01:13:32.240]  You're so delusional, Comey and Brennan and everybody else.
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:35.201]  You just think you're going to run your mouth all day and sell this country out.
[01:13:35.201 --> 01:13:36.222]  We're going to sit there and take it.
[01:13:36.222 --> 01:13:36.682]  We're done.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.101]  We elected President Trump.
[01:13:40.101 --> 01:13:46.686]  He can do whatever he wants now, constitutionally, with Russia.
[01:13:46.686 --> 01:13:49.689]  All he's doing is putting more troops on their borders and cutting off their energy supply.
[01:13:49.689 --> 01:13:57.214]  Oh, because he's a Russian agent, right?
[01:13:57.214 --> 01:13:59.076]  That's the right thing to do.
[01:13:59.076 --> 01:14:05.741]  To cut our competitors' energy off.
[01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:07.582]  See, the globalists had our energy cut off, didn't they?
[01:14:10.629 --> 01:14:20.417]  That's why the Russians and other people are giving so much money to the Democrats, along with General Electric and others, to make sure they all could have their cheap power and sell their energy, and we couldn't.
[01:14:20.417 --> 01:14:23.739]  Oh, I'm sorry, Trump kind of messed that deal up, didn't he?
[01:14:23.739 --> 01:14:26.402]  Because he's a Russian agent.
[01:14:26.402 --> 01:14:30.565]  That costs Russia some estimates of $3 trillion in the next decade.
[01:14:35.285 --> 01:14:42.668]  Donald Trump took Russia and slammed its head up against the wall and it's sitting there on the ground and then you sit there like a bunch of traitors and say he's the traitor.
[01:14:42.668 --> 01:14:43.788]  You're idiots.
[01:14:43.788 --> 01:14:45.129]  You're scum.
[01:14:45.129 --> 01:14:46.529]  You're the scum of the earth.
[01:14:46.529 --> 01:15:02.115]  When you sit there and see somebody executing faithfully as the President of the United States and all these traitors and all the scum and all their followers and all their dumb minions are saying kill our president and go after Alex Jones and all this crap.
[01:15:04.218 --> 01:15:08.380]  School teachers calling for me to be killed!
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.260]  Because I'm informed.
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:11.081]  I'm dedicated.
[01:15:11.081 --> 01:15:11.841]  I'm focused.
[01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:15.462]  I know what I'm talking about.
[01:15:15.462 --> 01:15:16.963]  And I'm mentally ill, just like Trump.
[01:15:16.963 --> 01:15:20.104]  Says I don't want to go join some big combine and screw everybody over.
[01:15:20.104 --> 01:15:21.084]  I actually believe in humanity.
[01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:22.565]  I actually believe in the honorable.
[01:15:31.971 --> 01:15:35.493]  I just can't believe how scummy this country's gotten.
[01:15:35.493 --> 01:15:38.315]  I love this country, but I look at the scum.
[01:15:38.315 --> 01:15:44.298]  I look at the trash.
[01:15:44.298 --> 01:15:48.140]  That infests Congress.
[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:51.622]  And I see Biden shooting his mouth off about the Russians.
[01:15:51.622 --> 01:15:59.007]  When his son took over the gas fields that Russia controls into Ukraine.
[01:15:59.007 --> 01:15:59.747]  Just stole it!
[01:16:04.724 --> 01:16:10.228]  See, it's one thing to turn our coal back on for Americans' advantage.
[01:16:10.228 --> 01:16:13.651]  If that hurts Russia, sorry, this is our land, our gas.
[01:16:13.651 --> 01:16:14.572]  We're competing.
[01:16:14.572 --> 01:16:15.652]  It's not personal.
[01:16:15.652 --> 01:16:23.178]  But you send in George Soros and people to steal the Russian gas lines coming in to the Ukraine?
[01:16:23.178 --> 01:16:25.020]  And then just take over the gas?
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.942]  And then put the snot-nosed son of Joe Biden in charge of it?
[01:16:27.942 --> 01:16:29.083]  That's disgusting!
[01:16:31.277 --> 01:16:36.566]  It's like Junker, the heir to the entire Nazi fortune.
[01:16:36.566 --> 01:16:39.892]  The number two Nazi family.
[01:16:39.892 --> 01:16:41.675]  German royalty.
[01:16:41.675 --> 01:16:42.377]  His father.
[01:16:49.642 --> 01:16:54.904]  His grandfather took over Luxembourg and their family owns it and controls it today.
[01:16:54.904 --> 01:16:56.945]  He's like the king of Luxembourg.
[01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:59.386]  That's who's the head of the EU?
[01:16:59.386 --> 01:17:00.647]  Unelected?
[01:17:00.647 --> 01:17:03.288]  Running his mouth about how they'll overthrow Trump.
[01:17:03.288 --> 01:17:04.208]  People go, they laugh.
[01:17:04.208 --> 01:17:06.089]  Hell, they control our media folks, the big banks.
[01:17:06.089 --> 01:17:17.213]  The Federal Reserve's mainly owned by European banks.
[01:17:17.213 --> 01:17:18.654]  These people are out of control.
[01:17:22.964 --> 01:17:23.985]  Harry in Pennsylvania.
[01:17:23.985 --> 01:17:24.745]  Thanks for holding, Harry.
[01:17:24.745 --> 01:17:27.367]  You're on the air.
[01:17:27.367 --> 01:17:29.989]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[01:17:29.989 --> 01:17:31.210]  First time caller.
[01:17:31.210 --> 01:17:31.990]  Love the products.
[01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:36.353]  I got a Trump Pence 2020 shirt and I got a lot of crazy looks when I walk outside with it.
[01:17:36.353 --> 01:17:38.074]  It's all about exercise and free speech.
[01:17:38.074 --> 01:17:39.875]  Absolutely.
[01:17:39.875 --> 01:17:42.097]  But anyway, I want to get to my Comey firing.
[01:17:42.097 --> 01:17:43.438]  This has been a long time coming.
[01:17:44.176 --> 01:17:54.561]  And he's been using his stance as the FBI director to use that leverage to keep the Trump administration in place, just like you say, to keep him paralyzed.
[01:17:54.561 --> 01:17:59.244]  He was doing it just like Senator Reid was doing it.
[01:17:59.244 --> 01:18:00.724]  Here's the inside intel.
[01:18:00.724 --> 01:18:11.930]  The FBI leadership is deep state control that has been basically trying to blackmail Trump with made-up info to submit to their foreign policy and their operations, and Trump just said, I've had enough of this crap.
[01:18:13.592 --> 01:18:18.334]  This whole fake news Russia inclusion thing was the perfect thing that fell into his lap to keep him down.
[01:18:18.334 --> 01:18:31.698]  So, he was just straying along saying, well, we're still investigating, we're still investigating, just to keep him in place so he can... That's right, and now he wanted more money for it, even though they've admitted in a year of investigation, nothing.
[01:18:31.698 --> 01:18:32.939]  There's nothing.
[01:18:32.939 --> 01:18:35.260]  There's nothing there.
[01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:39.661]  It's a house of cards, it's all crumbling down, and now we have to find out who the leakers are.
[01:18:39.661 --> 01:18:42.022]  We have to look at Susan Rice, Sally Yates.
[01:18:42.805 --> 01:18:44.667]  Barack Obama, it's a whack-a-mole.
[01:18:44.667 --> 01:18:46.008]  Who is the leaker?
[01:18:46.008 --> 01:18:49.391]  Now Trump can stick his attack dogs on them and let it loose.
[01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:52.193]  The next year is going to be really fun to watch.
[01:18:52.193 --> 01:18:52.853]  No, I agree.
[01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:58.238]  He's got to move quickly and just come out and say, here's the evidence.
[01:18:58.238 --> 01:19:03.222]  Hillary, Podesta, Communist Chinese, Russia, grand jury.
[01:19:03.222 --> 01:19:04.363]  Start indicting him.
[01:19:04.363 --> 01:19:06.004]  And go, oh, I'm Nixonian.
[01:19:06.004 --> 01:19:06.685]  No, I'm 100 times worse.
[01:19:09.195 --> 01:19:10.376]  Nixon didn't do anything.
[01:19:10.376 --> 01:19:14.740]  Nixon got set up by the deep state to be removed so they could run everything.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:16.822]  We've basically had kept presidents ever since.
[01:19:16.822 --> 01:19:19.384]  That's all about to end.
[01:19:19.384 --> 01:19:23.407]  Yeah, the status quo is all being shaken up and they just can't handle it.
[01:19:23.407 --> 01:19:26.190]  But that's pretty much what I wanted to say.
[01:19:26.190 --> 01:19:33.716]  I've been thinking things have been going crazy for a couple years, but I've been watching you for about a year, and since I've been watching you, it really has been opening my eyes and stuff.
[01:19:33.716 --> 01:19:36.879]  So, we've got to keep on fighting the info war.
[01:19:37.810 --> 01:19:38.891]  Well, thank you so much, Harry.
[01:19:38.891 --> 01:19:41.553]  Yeah, everybody should get their Trump pants.
[01:19:41.553 --> 01:19:42.333]  Or Trump is my president.
[01:19:42.333 --> 01:19:44.414]  We have a new Trump is my president navy blue shirt.
[01:19:44.414 --> 01:19:45.615]  It looks great.
[01:19:45.615 --> 01:19:47.497]  And it's about exercising free speech.
[01:19:47.497 --> 01:19:50.339]  It's about being a, you know, winner.
[01:19:50.339 --> 01:19:56.923]  Patriot, not just a sunshine patriot, and just continuing to march forward and exercise free speech and trigger all the libtards.
[01:19:56.923 --> 01:19:57.543]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:57.543 --> 01:19:57.924]  Stay with us.
[01:19:59.932 --> 01:20:01.773]  This is Michael David from Seattle.
[01:20:01.773 --> 01:20:07.635]  I'm 51 years old, and six months ago, I started taking Andro 400 to increase my testosterone.
[01:20:07.635 --> 01:20:12.518]  Since then, I've lost 35 pounds of fat, and my waist went from size 38 to size 32.
[01:20:12.518 --> 01:20:16.519]  I have more energy, and I look and feel 20 years younger.
[01:20:16.519 --> 01:20:19.421]  And now, my wife tells me I have to take Andro 400.
[01:20:19.421 --> 01:20:22.062]  Hi, this is Ron Johnson from Utah.
[01:20:22.062 --> 01:20:26.364]  After 10 weeks of taking Andro 400, I lost 13 pounds, and my waist went from 36 to 33.
[01:20:26.364 --> 01:20:27.004]  That was 8 years ago.
[01:20:29.145 --> 01:20:33.628]  I continue to take Andro 400 and I've maintained my weight at 172.
[01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:35.109]  Gained muscle and energy.
[01:20:35.109 --> 01:20:38.611]  I'm 63 now and feel better than I have in 30 years.
[01:20:38.611 --> 01:20:39.892]  Andro 400.
[01:20:39.892 --> 01:20:45.356]  The natural way to increase testosterone, lose belly fat, gain energy and feel great.
[01:20:45.356 --> 01:20:46.817]  Try Andro 400.
[01:20:46.817 --> 01:20:50.499]  The safe, effective, affordable way to boost your testosterone.
[01:20:50.499 --> 01:20:51.700]  Go to andro400.com or call 888-400-0435.
[01:20:59.505 --> 01:21:04.889]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:21:04.889 --> 01:21:07.730]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:09.692]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:21:09.692 --> 01:21:14.695]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:21:14.695 --> 01:21:16.776]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:21:16.776 --> 01:21:18.057]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:21:18.057 --> 01:21:22.960]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:30.006]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:21:30.006 --> 01:21:32.989]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:21:32.989 --> 01:21:36.672]  It's loaded with good halogen iodides of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:21:36.672 --> 01:21:43.538]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:21:43.538 --> 01:21:48.683]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[01:21:48.943 --> 01:21:50.983]  Iodine, nanosilver and more.
[01:21:50.983 --> 01:21:59.005]  Learn more about InfoWarsLife Super Blue Toothpaste at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.

[01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:59.491]  It's been said.
[01:22:59.491 --> 01:23:02.954]  Any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:23:02.954 --> 01:23:04.555]  Those times may be near.
[01:23:04.555 --> 01:23:05.456]  Think about it.
[01:23:05.456 --> 01:23:10.059]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:23:10.059 --> 01:23:14.703]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:23:15.063 --> 01:23:20.869]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:23:20.869 --> 01:23:27.575]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:23:27.575 --> 01:23:30.118]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:23:30.558 --> 01:23:33.360]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:36.843]  Get a 4-week survival food supply for only $99.

[01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:11.758]  We're done having this country run in the ground.
[01:24:38.919 --> 01:25:02.665]  And the traitors have been in charge so long that they're so arrogant they think they're gonna boss a president around with made-up Russia ties and shoot their mouths off about killing the president and the Secret Service and the FBI aren't allowed under their bureaucracy to do anything!
[01:25:02.665 --> 01:25:05.946]  I've had guests say mild things about Obama
[01:25:07.699 --> 01:25:09.039]  And had the Secret Service show up here.
[01:25:09.039 --> 01:25:15.121]  The Secret Service has probably been here six, seven times over the years.
[01:25:15.121 --> 01:25:17.221]  They've been here with subpoenas.
[01:25:17.221 --> 01:25:23.863]  When somebody on the message board makes a comment about killing Obama.
[01:25:23.863 --> 01:25:25.143]  That was back when we ran our own comments.
[01:25:25.143 --> 01:25:29.584]  I do it at a third-party site now, so they can deal with the subpoenas.
[01:25:29.584 --> 01:25:31.585]  And then I look at, like, the millions and millions.
[01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:32.385]  I guess they can't do anything.
[01:25:32.385 --> 01:25:33.725]  There's just so many.
[01:25:33.725 --> 01:25:36.626]  The media led the way with threaten the President, kill the President.
[01:25:38.513 --> 01:25:51.101]  I've had my crews in Ferguson, and in Austin, and in Dallas, and in New York, and in L.A., and in Bakersfield, just everywhere, and they're just there going, oink, oink, bang, bang.
[01:25:51.101 --> 01:25:52.903]  You know, how many cops?
[01:25:52.903 --> 01:25:53.703]  Five is good.
[01:25:53.703 --> 01:25:54.844]  No, six is better.
[01:25:54.844 --> 01:25:55.765]  Seven is better.
[01:25:55.765 --> 01:25:56.905]  Bang, bang, kill the cops.
[01:25:56.905 --> 01:26:02.669]  And buses of offloaded college students, a bunch of white ones getting off saying, deck the halls with dead cops.
[01:26:02.669 --> 01:26:05.911]  And again, I don't like worship cops, but it was just any group.
[01:26:05.911 --> 01:26:06.892]  Let's kill firefighters.
[01:26:06.892 --> 01:26:07.652]  Let's kill teachers.
[01:26:07.652 --> 01:26:07.893]  It's like,
[01:26:08.641 --> 01:26:09.922]  What?
[01:26:09.922 --> 01:26:18.750]  I mean, I have to tell you, when I see people organizing saying, randomly kill people, I start thinking about, that's an armed force against me.
[01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:24.575]  I start, you know, as a man, I start, wheels start turning, like that's an enemy.
[01:26:24.575 --> 01:26:29.258]  And then they sit there, running their mouths, how they want to kill patriots all day long.
[01:26:29.258 --> 01:26:32.141]  These people don't think we're not, we actually build businesses.
[01:26:32.141 --> 01:26:33.322]  We actually hire people.
[01:26:33.322 --> 01:26:35.324]  We actually work 17, 18 hours a day.
[01:26:35.324 --> 01:26:36.685]  We actually built this country.
[01:26:37.898 --> 01:26:43.120]  And all you slack-jawed wimps and communists and dumbasses think you're going to keep running your mouth forever.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:46.001]  You keep running your mouth, you're going to run it right into six feet under.
[01:26:46.001 --> 01:26:48.581]  And that ain't talk!
[01:26:48.581 --> 01:26:50.522]  You see what we've done politically.
[01:26:50.522 --> 01:26:52.243]  You sit here and push it much longer.
[01:26:52.243 --> 01:26:55.324]  Oh, the physical action's not going to come from me.
[01:26:55.324 --> 01:26:59.245]  It's going to come from your actions, and you're going to get knocked upside your head.
[01:27:00.936 --> 01:27:03.118]  But betas always need that, don't they?
[01:27:03.118 --> 01:27:08.201]  They always take alphas being restrained as weakness until you find out.
[01:27:08.201 --> 01:27:14.106]  And then you wish you hadn't got kicked upside the head by a horse.
[01:27:14.106 --> 01:27:17.709]  The sad part about this is there's no pleasure in killing you.
[01:27:17.709 --> 01:27:19.630]  There's no pleasure in running you over.
[01:27:19.630 --> 01:27:24.394]  There's no pleasure in defeating you because you're scum.
[01:27:24.394 --> 01:27:25.755]  Just get out of the way!
[01:27:26.974 --> 01:27:31.158]  Keep enjoying the civilization that the Patriots built and stop bitching!
[01:27:31.158 --> 01:27:34.061]  But I know, you want that rite of passage.
[01:27:34.061 --> 01:27:39.447]  You want to piss on your betters.
[01:27:39.447 --> 01:27:41.649]  You have criminal energy.
[01:27:41.649 --> 01:27:43.371]  I know.
[01:27:43.371 --> 01:27:46.274]  And so just keep pushing!
[01:27:46.274 --> 01:27:47.915]  Keep pushing!
[01:27:47.915 --> 01:27:49.177]  Because once
[01:27:51.772 --> 01:27:53.493]  You passed the demarcation line.
[01:27:53.493 --> 01:28:03.181]  Once you've gone past the point of return, once you've hit the event horizon, just remember you asked for it.
[01:28:03.181 --> 01:28:06.684]  Because you start a war, it's one that we will finish.
[01:28:06.684 --> 01:28:07.965]  Make no mistake, dumbasses.
[01:28:07.965 --> 01:28:12.809]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Adam in New York.
[01:28:12.809 --> 01:28:13.250]  You're on the air.
[01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:16.851]  Hi Alex.
[01:28:16.851 --> 01:28:19.233]  Hey brother, thanks for holding.
[01:28:19.233 --> 01:28:20.835]  Hi, thank you for taking my call.
[01:28:20.835 --> 01:28:24.017]  I just want to thank you and everybody in FORS for everything you guys do.
[01:28:24.017 --> 01:28:26.099]  Thank you.
[01:28:26.099 --> 01:28:32.224]  I think Trump firing Comey is really positive for him, and I think it's just really good for truth and liberty in general.
[01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:38.649]  Maybe, like Ben was saying, we can get an investigation of Hillary and maybe Epstein and Podesta.
[01:28:38.649 --> 01:28:39.570]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:28:40.768 --> 01:28:43.989]  Definitely think, like you were saying, Trump needs to go on the attack.
[01:28:43.989 --> 01:28:50.311]  And maybe I'm just being a little too optimistic, but I think this is a victory or maybe an opportunity for the M4.
[01:28:50.311 --> 01:29:00.194]  I think with the left right now, I know they've got their shields out trying to do some damage control on this, but right now I feel like their hypocrisy is like really on display.
[01:29:00.194 --> 01:29:09.017]  Just kind of nakedly, you know, just like you were saying earlier, they're calling for Comey to be fired just not that long ago, even as early as like last week.
[01:29:09.017 --> 01:29:10.197]  And now they're, you know,
[01:29:11.326 --> 01:29:12.087]  Exactly.
[01:29:12.087 --> 01:29:12.447]  It's like...
[01:29:30.014 --> 01:29:31.014]  Hold on, stay there.
[01:29:31.014 --> 01:29:31.995]  I've got Mark Moreno coming up.
[01:29:31.995 --> 01:29:33.455]  I want to get through some of your calls.
[01:29:33.455 --> 01:29:34.555]  So we'll get Mark on in about 10 minutes.
[01:29:34.555 --> 01:29:38.556]  I'm going to go to Adam, Robert, Beth, and a few others, and then we're going to get Mark Moreno on here.
[01:29:38.556 --> 01:29:39.957]  But you're making some great points, Adam.
[01:29:39.957 --> 01:29:41.197]  I don't want to cut you short.
[01:29:41.197 --> 01:29:42.997]  We'll be right back in three minutes.
[01:29:42.997 --> 01:29:43.878]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:45.658]  This is the Info War.
[01:29:45.658 --> 01:29:49.179]  We're going to go on the offense now, or we're going to lose.
[01:29:49.179 --> 01:29:50.560]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:53.100]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.761]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.214 --> 01:30:06.637]  Last week, InfoWars.com published the article, Bombshell Study Proves Unvaccinated Children Are Healthier Than Vaccinated Children.
[01:30:06.637 --> 01:30:10.939]  The two studies were pulled from the Journal of Transitional Science without any explanation.
[01:30:10.939 --> 01:30:16.221]  The studies surveyed parents of 666 homeschooled children, 39% who were not vaccinated.
[01:30:16.221 --> 01:30:21.444]  When asked about allergies, 22% of vaccinated children were shown to have allergies, while only 6.9% were unvaccinated.
[01:30:21.444 --> 01:30:23.324]  Autism, 4.7% were vaccinated versus 1% unvaccinated.
[01:30:26.886 --> 01:30:31.689]  So of course there's going to be pushback when a study like this comes out proving that vaccines are not really safe.
[01:30:31.689 --> 01:30:35.011]  And people are going to come out and attack it and say, oh, they just talked to parents.
[01:30:35.011 --> 01:30:37.172]  Or they'll say, oh, there was a bias in the study.
[01:30:37.172 --> 01:30:39.273]  These people think vaccines are unsafe.
[01:30:39.273 --> 01:30:40.754]  One, the study proves they're unsafe.
[01:30:40.754 --> 01:30:45.297]  And two, any other vaccine study is done and paid for by the pharmaceutical companies.
[01:30:45.297 --> 01:30:47.178]  Of course, they think vaccines are safe.
[01:30:47.178 --> 01:30:50.941]  Just go to our article, Bombshell Study Proves Unvaccinated Children Are Healthier.

[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:33.601]  I wanted to finish up with Adam and Robert and a few others, then I would go to our guests and back to your calls.

[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.042]  But whatever you do, please spread the word.
[01:34:31.042 --> 01:34:39.289]  You know, one of our Chicago affiliates talked about... Matt Dubio last week talked about how they offered him like a half million dollars.
[01:34:39.289 --> 01:34:39.830]  Sounds like a lot.
[01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:41.131]  It's not on talk radio to pay for things.
[01:34:42.728 --> 01:34:44.730]  To kick my show off air.
[01:34:44.730 --> 01:34:46.832]  And that's what stations get those calls.
[01:34:46.832 --> 01:34:51.356]  We've been on that station like six years now in Chicago.
[01:34:51.356 --> 01:35:02.047]  And he said, you know, he said it doesn't come up to the level of what he loses, not selling us out, but he says he gets $100, $1,000 checks, you know, every month people send him.
[01:35:02.047 --> 01:35:06.031]  Understanding it's expensive to run a radio station and to do all this and to put a show like mine on.
[01:35:07.022 --> 01:35:12.426]  But that's why so many stations continue, because they get ratings, you just don't get the big corporate sponsors.
[01:35:12.426 --> 01:35:18.331]  So, local businesses need to sponsor, or you need to let local sponsors know while you're supporting them.
[01:35:18.331 --> 01:35:22.775]  And you need to make donations, just, you know, put it in your calendar to send them a hundred bucks if you got the money.
[01:35:22.775 --> 01:35:28.440]  Look, people that are nouveau riche, middle class, or wealthy, if you keep holding on to all your money, we're going to lose everything.
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:31.582]  I mean, imagine if we get this tax cut of 10, 15, 20 percent.
[01:35:35.526 --> 01:35:37.567]  Again, you spend a little bit of money, you get a lot back.
[01:35:37.567 --> 01:35:40.629]  This is a war, people.
[01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:46.032]  That's why I take the money that comes in, I just expand, expand, expand, expand, and we're changing the world.
[01:35:46.032 --> 01:35:48.493]  The greatest value I've got in my life is fighting tyranny.
[01:35:48.493 --> 01:35:50.554]  That's my great possession.
[01:35:50.554 --> 01:35:54.256]  That's the great reward, is knowing we're not sellouts, we're good people.
[01:35:54.256 --> 01:35:57.418]  Finishing up, Adam, about Comey and the FBI termination.
[01:35:57.418 --> 01:35:57.678]  Go ahead.
[01:35:59.299 --> 01:36:02.260]  I just want to reiterate what you were just saying there, Alex.
[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:08.162]  Right now, with the left, with their hypocrisy on display, I think it's an opportunity for the M4.
[01:36:08.162 --> 01:36:12.984]  The listeners, I think we need to strike while the iron is hot and just get the word out there about the broadcast.
[01:36:12.984 --> 01:36:16.125]  And just keep red-pilling people, because they can see the hypocrisy.
[01:36:16.125 --> 01:36:20.286]  So, we just need to keep supporting the broadcast and get the word out there.
[01:36:21.175 --> 01:36:22.537]  Absolutely, God bless you.
[01:36:22.537 --> 01:36:29.865]  Yeah, I mean, I read what comes out of the Trump administration, not just what the news says, but what they put out the minutes of these meetings, so they're transparent.
[01:36:29.865 --> 01:36:31.586]  He got rid of all the lobbyists.
[01:36:31.586 --> 01:36:33.448]  Nobody's done that in 50 years.
[01:36:33.448 --> 01:36:35.931]  Just so many promises he fulfilled.
[01:36:35.931 --> 01:36:37.232]  And there's just no thinking about it.
[01:36:37.232 --> 01:36:39.255]  He said, we got coal, it's clean.
[01:36:39.255 --> 01:36:41.537]  We're going to use it.
[01:36:41.537 --> 01:36:43.159]  Carbon tax that was put in by stealth is over.
[01:36:45.908 --> 01:36:54.411]  And just hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent trying to put this in place globally because it would raise $15 trillion a year.
[01:36:54.411 --> 01:36:57.512]  That's Al Gore's global carbon tax he wants.
[01:36:57.512 --> 01:36:59.793]  A tax on productivity, a tax on the West.
[01:36:59.793 --> 01:37:03.795]  Trump just blew all that away, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:03.795 --> 01:37:08.556]  By the way, he doesn't want carbon taxes on Russia either, but he said, sorry Russia, our coal's back on the table.
[01:37:08.556 --> 01:37:10.337]  Now their coal, their gas is less valued.
[01:37:11.886 --> 01:37:13.547]  He was a Russian agent, he wouldn't do that.
[01:37:13.547 --> 01:37:18.910]  But he's also trying to block Russia being able to sell oil and gas and coal.
[01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:21.191]  So he's just bringing free market back.
[01:37:21.191 --> 01:37:22.491]  It's a big, big deal.
[01:37:22.491 --> 01:37:26.874]  We're going to go to Robert in North Carolina and Beth in Virginia and others.
[01:37:26.874 --> 01:37:28.514]  Just bam, bam, bam into the next hour.
[01:37:28.514 --> 01:37:34.417]  But I wanted to get Mark Moreno on from ClimateDepot.com along with Lord Mockton, who he works closely with.
[01:37:34.417 --> 01:37:34.918]  It's the leading
[01:37:35.956 --> 01:37:39.058]  leading side out there exposing this global fraud.
[01:37:39.058 --> 01:37:43.301]  We also carry his new film that they tried to have him arrested for, for premiering in Paris last year.
[01:37:43.301 --> 01:37:47.663]  It's a film on the whole climate hustle.
[01:37:47.663 --> 01:37:52.546]  I know you know all about this, but show it to your high school, show it to your church, show it.
[01:37:52.546 --> 01:37:53.347]  This is documented.
[01:37:53.347 --> 01:37:55.248]  So we have Inconvenient Truth Part 1, 2006.
[01:37:55.248 --> 01:37:59.471]  Polar bears can't swim, they're all dying, their numbers are up fivefold.
[01:37:59.471 --> 01:38:01.392]  You've got all these lies going on.
[01:38:03.665 --> 01:38:08.387]  The ice caps will be totally melted in the Arctic and Antarctic by 2013, total bull.
[01:38:08.387 --> 01:38:21.351]  So he joins us to talk about, because I read the synopsis of it and seen the ad, where Al Gore is the savior of the earth in his new Inconvenient Load of Manure Part 2, Inconvenient Part 2, and
[01:38:22.532 --> 01:38:27.976]  It's literally fiction showing video animations of drowning polar bears in the first one.
[01:38:27.976 --> 01:38:30.477]  Now the second one is even crazier.
[01:38:30.477 --> 01:38:33.199]  Everybody knows lower Manhattan floods every decade or so with a hurricane.
[01:38:33.199 --> 01:38:36.562]  Hurricanes are down like some of the lowest since the 60s or whatever.
[01:38:36.562 --> 01:38:39.403]  But that's why they have a slurry wall and drains there.
[01:38:39.403 --> 01:38:40.884]  Because it floods.
[01:38:40.884 --> 01:38:42.826]  It's always been flooding.
[01:38:42.826 --> 01:38:44.007]  And that's what happens.
[01:38:45.213 --> 01:38:50.055]  There used to be a swamp flooding out from the river, and so now it's sinking like New Orleans.
[01:38:50.055 --> 01:38:53.856]  But they just say, I predicted it would flood, and it did.
[01:38:53.856 --> 01:38:59.058]  Yeah, that's why it's a giant slurry wall and a giant area that drains the water out.
[01:38:59.058 --> 01:39:02.059]  So it's just total lies, but he's the expert on it.
[01:39:02.059 --> 01:39:07.001]  He can break it down, Mark Moreno, former top advisor to the Senate on this whole deal.
[01:39:07.001 --> 01:39:08.522]  So what is the latest, my friend?
[01:39:09.738 --> 01:39:11.540]  Well, first of all, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:13.942]  Al Gore claimed... I was right!
[01:39:13.942 --> 01:39:16.044]  New York flooded like I predicted!
[01:39:16.044 --> 01:39:25.212]  Al Gore predicted half of Florida would permanently be underwater, New York City would permanently be underwater, and as his defense, he uses the one hurricane
[01:39:25.552 --> 01:39:28.414]  Which wasn't even classified as a major hurricane.
[01:39:28.414 --> 01:39:31.016]  It was a big hurricane and bad, Hurricane Sandy.
[01:39:31.016 --> 01:39:36.000]  But we've gone now since 2005 without a Category 3 or larger hurricane making landfall.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.383]  They're actually in record low numbers in decline in hurricanes.
[01:39:40.383 --> 01:39:47.769]  So he uses that one flood from a hurricane, which as you noted Alex, is completely expected to prove that he was right.
[01:39:48.469 --> 01:40:05.641]  It's kind of like saying, like Barbara Boxer did one time in the Senate, when they had, literally, this is no joke, they had tornadoes in Oklahoma one day in 2013, and her and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island went down to the Senate floor and said, this is what we warned you about with climate change.
[01:40:05.641 --> 01:40:08.123]  What, that there would be tornadoes in Tornado Alley?
[01:40:08.123 --> 01:40:12.646]  This is the level of stupidity and moronic science that they present, and by the way,
[01:40:13.962 --> 01:40:18.865]  Touted their carbon tax as a solution to tornadoes in Tornado Alley.
[01:40:18.865 --> 01:40:21.027]  You know, uh, what's next?
[01:40:21.027 --> 01:40:24.489]  That's why people 150 years ago in Palm Springs or something.
[01:40:24.489 --> 01:40:30.092]  I mean, this is how low level the science has become from the man-made climate change promoters.
[01:40:30.092 --> 01:40:30.573]  You're right.
[01:40:30.573 --> 01:40:34.855]  And for those that don't live in Texas, this Tornado Alley ends right here in Austin.
[01:40:34.855 --> 01:40:38.057]  Sometimes it goes to San Antonio, but it goes right through Oklahoma into Kansas.
[01:40:38.057 --> 01:40:38.538]  That's why
[01:40:39.338 --> 01:40:48.943]  They have storm cellars all over the place in Texas and Kansas and Oklahoma because sometimes you'll turn on the news and there'll be 50 tornadoes, you know, in a hundred mile stretch.
[01:40:48.943 --> 01:40:52.985]  And I mean, when I was a kid in Dallas, routinely, we lived on a hill over the lake.
[01:40:52.985 --> 01:40:57.828]  We'd look out and see tornadoes coming across the lake and then turning into water spouts.
[01:40:57.828 --> 01:41:00.249]  I mean, I just grew up seeing tornadoes all the time.
[01:41:01.926 --> 01:41:03.147]  But, oh, it's totally new!
[01:41:03.147 --> 01:41:04.608]  It's totally new, Mark!
[01:41:04.608 --> 01:41:08.071]  Oh, and by the way, you know, at Climate Depot I just did a whole report.
[01:41:08.071 --> 01:41:08.951]  Extreme weather.
[01:41:08.951 --> 01:41:12.174]  Tornadoes five years in a row at or near record lows.
[01:41:12.174 --> 01:41:16.297]  Last year by the record low since records began in the 1950s.
[01:41:16.297 --> 01:41:17.558]  Keep in count of these.
[01:41:17.558 --> 01:41:19.559]  Big tornadoes down significantly.
[01:41:19.559 --> 01:41:22.542]  Hurricanes, floods, droughts either declining or not.
[01:41:22.542 --> 01:41:25.824]  Is that because the sun, sunspots, sun fire is down?
[01:41:25.824 --> 01:41:28.746]  Why is it down according to the astrophysicists?
[01:41:28.746 --> 01:41:29.487]  The sunspots, right?
[01:41:30.583 --> 01:41:33.245]  It can be sunspots, natural cycles, people aren't even sure.
[01:41:33.245 --> 01:41:36.267]  What we are sure of is it's not getting worse.
[01:41:36.267 --> 01:41:41.611]  Al Gore still goes around and says every night on the news is like a nature walk through the Book of Revelations.
[01:41:41.611 --> 01:41:43.032]  No, it's not!
[01:41:43.032 --> 01:41:45.193]  It's not even close.
[01:41:45.193 --> 01:41:53.459]  And of course, you know, temperature and polar... By the way, polar bears are the highest numbers ever reported this year in the history of polar bear counting.
[01:41:53.459 --> 01:41:56.742]  Aren't they five times what they were according to the Smithsonian Institute?
[01:41:56.742 --> 01:41:57.702]  What they were in the 50s?
[01:41:57.702 --> 01:41:58.323]  Five times?
[01:41:59.602 --> 01:42:02.384]  We're actually now up to over 30,000, 29,000.
[01:42:02.384 --> 01:42:05.326]  Some estimates were over 30,000.
[01:42:05.326 --> 01:42:09.008]  We started with about 5,000 to 10,000 estimates back in the 1950s.
[01:42:09.008 --> 01:42:14.731]  A lot of it's due to a hunting ban, but it just goes to show you they're not threatened by global warming.
[01:42:14.731 --> 01:42:17.093]  They're threatened by predictions of the future.
[01:42:17.093 --> 01:42:19.694]  In fact, I took a trip to Greenland with the U.S.
[01:42:19.694 --> 01:42:28.460]  Senate and actually argued with one of the scientists and I said, the greatest threat polar bears face are the electrons in the hard drives of the modelers predicting doom.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:32.404]  In other words, it's not reality, it's just their computers that are predicting doom.
[01:42:32.404 --> 01:42:34.207]  This is what they do over and over.
[01:42:34.207 --> 01:42:41.675]  Mark, also as you know, a bunch of environmentalists came out and said Fukushima was because of global warming.
[01:42:41.675 --> 01:42:46.301]  Earthquakes, no one's ever claimed that earthquakes are caused.
[01:42:46.301 --> 01:42:47.983]  That's caused by tectonic shift.
[01:42:49.352 --> 01:43:04.426]  Don't say no one's ever claimed, Alex, because literally every malady you can think of, from rape, barroom brawls, prostitution, has been blamed on global warming, airline turbulence, and yes, tsunamis, earthquakes, have been blamed on global warming, I believe, by United Nations scientists as well.
[01:43:04.426 --> 01:43:05.988]  No, I know, I mean, obviously no one's serious.
[01:43:05.988 --> 01:43:07.369]  They can blame everything they can.
[01:43:07.369 --> 01:43:13.215]  Well, sure, and of course, for people that don't know, I mean, you just mentioned it, they're claiming Muslims running around murdering everybody as climate change.
[01:43:13.215 --> 01:43:13.275]  Yes.
[01:43:14.514 --> 01:43:15.014]  Yes.
[01:43:15.014 --> 01:43:21.698]  In fact, the interesting thing about the Muslims, they're blaming the Syrian civil war on climate change because of the drought.
[01:43:21.698 --> 01:43:32.484]  Keep in mind that drought is actually, I believe it was a 60-year trend, is actually going to global decline in drought, according to extreme weather expert Dr. Roger Pilkey Jr.
[01:43:32.484 --> 01:43:37.287]  But having said that, they blame the drought in Syria for the rise of ISIS.
[01:43:37.287 --> 01:43:38.468]  And the problem with that is
[01:43:39.068 --> 01:43:40.829]  Syria's always had drought.
[01:43:40.829 --> 01:43:47.574]  In 1933, the Muslim government in Syria banned the yo-yo because they thought it created drought.
[01:43:47.574 --> 01:43:55.780]  Now, in 2017, we have yo-yos trying to ban the SUV in American Energy because they think it causes bad weather and global warming.
[01:43:55.780 --> 01:43:57.982]  We have not advanced as a culture.
[01:43:59.136 --> 01:44:02.077]  All right, now you and Lord Monk are on the front lines of this.
[01:44:02.077 --> 01:44:08.921]  I know we're winning because of the hacked emails, how it declined six years ago, seven years ago, how time flies, and all the evidence coming out.
[01:44:08.921 --> 01:44:11.062]  They've gone from global freezing to global warming.
[01:44:11.062 --> 01:44:12.062]  Now they say climate change.
[01:44:12.062 --> 01:44:13.583]  Well, of course climate change is happening.
[01:44:13.583 --> 01:44:14.704]  It's just not anthropogenic.
[01:44:15.584 --> 01:44:19.466]  Even their fake models say we're like, what, half the percent of any change.
[01:44:19.466 --> 01:44:20.967]  So where are they going now?
[01:44:20.967 --> 01:44:26.811]  Because as you've said many times, we're winning the intellectual battle, but they're still bureaucratically in charge, and they just don't care.
[01:44:26.811 --> 01:44:27.751]  They're rolling forward.
[01:44:27.751 --> 01:44:29.072]  How is Trump affecting that?
[01:44:29.072 --> 01:44:34.496]  Because we've got Trump turning the coal back on all these great things, but then we've got Ivanka, who I didn't elect.
[01:44:34.496 --> 01:44:39.038]  I'd love her, you know, hanging out with Merkel and saying, I'm going to get daddy to stop this.
[01:44:39.038 --> 01:44:43.541]  And then you got, you know, you've got Bill Maher saying she's giving him hand jobs and stuff.
[01:44:43.541 --> 01:44:44.922]  I mean, this has reached a new level.
[01:44:46.365 --> 01:44:53.513]  Yeah, I try not to get involved in that sort of the palace intrigue of Ivanka and what's happening there.
[01:44:53.513 --> 01:44:56.336]  I firmly believe that Donald Trump is going to do the right thing.
[01:44:56.336 --> 01:44:59.899]  Keep his campaign promise and keep his political philosophy.
[01:44:59.899 --> 01:45:01.181]  People have said, oh, he's been all over the place.
[01:45:01.181 --> 01:45:04.284]  If you go back to the 1980s, look at his Oprah Winfrey interviews.
[01:45:04.284 --> 01:45:05.806]  He was not a globalist.
[01:45:05.806 --> 01:45:06.867]  He was a nationalist.
[01:45:06.867 --> 01:45:07.848]  He was America first.
[01:45:08.428 --> 01:45:17.695]  And I don't see how Donald Trump could stay in a United Nations climate treaty if those views, which he's held consistent since at least the 1980s, come true.
[01:45:17.695 --> 01:45:18.776]  He will not.
[01:45:18.776 --> 01:45:22.479]  I can't imagine him, you know, not withdrawing from this.
[01:45:22.479 --> 01:45:25.081]  Now, there might be different methods by which he does it.
[01:45:25.081 --> 01:45:26.382]  He could submit it to the Senate.
[01:45:26.382 --> 01:45:28.924]  He could withdraw from the United Nations process.
[01:45:28.924 --> 01:45:31.466]  He could just try to cancel the treaty specifically.
[01:45:32.006 --> 01:45:37.188]  And that remains to be seen, but I do not see us going forward with this treaty, regardless of what his daughter did.
[01:45:37.188 --> 01:45:39.769]  But here's the thing, Alex, you asked me where they go from here.
[01:45:39.769 --> 01:45:45.011]  I just came from, I went to the March for Science, and I went to the People's Climate March attending it.
[01:45:45.011 --> 01:45:46.031]  And I was outed!
[01:45:46.031 --> 01:45:48.572]  I didn't even know I was in, as the old Seinfeld episode said.
[01:45:48.572 --> 01:45:51.513]  They outed me, they've denied me press credentials.
[01:45:51.513 --> 01:45:54.955]  They actually tried to deny me, this is a bizarre story, coffee creamer!
[01:45:54.955 --> 01:45:55.835]  I'm not making this up.
[01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:58.344]  There was a guy in the VIP area.
[01:45:58.344 --> 01:46:00.809]  We finally argued and got our press credentials late.
[01:46:00.809 --> 01:46:02.232]  They made us wait about an hour and a half.
[01:46:02.232 --> 01:46:03.234]  We missed a lot of the interviews.
[01:46:03.234 --> 01:46:06.220]  We went into the press area at this People's Climate March in Washington, D.C.
[01:46:07.196 --> 01:46:17.266]  And this guy would go around and out me to all the politicians, there was Senator Whitehouse and others, whispering in their ear, the handlers, this guy's a climate denier, this guy's a climate denier, trying to shut down all my interviews.
[01:46:17.266 --> 01:46:28.316]  I went over to the coffee table, which is for the media, had a cup of black coffee, and I went, and they were all nice to me, and the guy came up and said he's a climate denier, and they tried to deny me, and they did deny me coffee cream.
[01:46:28.316 --> 01:46:29.237]  I had to argue with him.
[01:46:29.437 --> 01:46:33.480]  Finally, I said, you're going to deny me coffee cream because I don't agree with you on global warming.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:37.623]  And finally, they actually handed over the two creams I was requesting for my coffee.
[01:46:37.623 --> 01:46:41.525]  That's how petty and authoritarian these guys are.
[01:46:41.525 --> 01:46:42.966]  They have a word for it.
[01:46:42.966 --> 01:46:47.469]  It's called... At the same time, they want to throw you in jail as Bill Nye and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:46:47.469 --> 01:46:48.410]  and others have advocated.
[01:46:48.410 --> 01:46:50.752]  Oh, that's why I wanted to get you on, not just about all gores.
[01:46:52.210 --> 01:46:56.037]  A new BS film coming out, Inconvenient Load of Baloney Part 2.
[01:46:56.037 --> 01:47:03.631]  Bill Nye, as I'm sure you know, they've edited on Netflix his old TV show from the 90s where it shows a woman explaining the genders.
[01:47:04.796 --> 01:47:09.001]  And they're now saying chromosomes don't cause it and science isn't real.
[01:47:09.001 --> 01:47:11.304]  So they have this movement called Science is Real.
[01:47:11.304 --> 01:47:12.666]  Arrest Mark Moreno.
[01:47:12.666 --> 01:47:13.747]  Attorney Generals are meeting.
[01:47:13.747 --> 01:47:14.949]  Arrest Alex Jones.
[01:47:14.949 --> 01:47:16.531]  I've now reached that famed club.
[01:47:16.531 --> 01:47:17.552]  I'm very honored.
[01:47:17.552 --> 01:47:19.254]  These people are crazy!
[01:47:19.254 --> 01:47:22.438]  I mean, they're now saying male and female doesn't exist.
[01:47:22.438 --> 01:47:23.179]  What is going on here?
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:25.700]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:35.023]  In 1996, Bill Nye's Netflix show, which, by the way, I can attest to his rock star status among people under, say, age 28 or 25.
[01:47:35.023 --> 01:47:45.106]  Last year in Central Park, when I interviewed Bill Nye, we were surrounded by about 30, 40 high school kids and older who just view him as a celebrity because they grew up in public schools watching these videos.
[01:47:45.106 --> 01:47:51.868]  And one of the videos they watched was 1996, where Bill Nye talks about chromosomes and talks about how they determine whether you're a boy or a girl.
[01:47:52.408 --> 01:47:53.029]  Guess what?
[01:47:53.029 --> 01:48:08.420]  Fast forward to 2017, gender fluidity, not only does Bill Nye show up dancing ice cream sexuality, and I'm not making that up, he's actually dancing to this song and this group that's trying to promote this gender fluidity.
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:21.409]  Bill Nye unilaterally changed the science that he once promoted and now says that, you know, there is no way we can determine sexuality, it's very complicated, it's no longer science-based, according to Bill Nye, the alleged science guy.
[01:48:22.179 --> 01:48:22.879]  That's right.
[01:48:22.879 --> 01:48:27.482]  Just ignore nature and then claim that nurture is overpowering it.
[01:48:27.482 --> 01:48:29.724]  That's just denying the laws of gravity.
[01:48:29.724 --> 01:48:32.085]  And it just shows they're all day saying we're denying science.
[01:48:32.085 --> 01:48:35.668]  They're all day saying you should be arrested to your face.
[01:48:35.668 --> 01:48:38.830]  And then he's sitting there saying chromosomes don't affect the gender.
[01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:40.511]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:48:41.539 --> 01:48:48.443]  Yes, and not only did he do that, he was the headliner at the March for Science in Washington, D.C., along with a guy named Michael Mann.
[01:48:48.443 --> 01:48:50.284]  If you remember that, you just referenced it earlier, Alex.
[01:48:50.284 --> 01:48:50.544]  Oh, yeah.
[01:48:50.544 --> 01:48:51.884]  The ClimateGate scandal.
[01:48:51.884 --> 01:48:58.248]  This is the guy who was the lead United Nations author who was caught in the emails asking people to delete files.
[01:48:58.248 --> 01:48:59.088]  Hide the decline.
[01:48:59.088 --> 01:49:02.530]  Freedom of Information Act requests, or at least it certainly appeared that way.
[01:49:03.210 --> 01:49:06.272]  And he appeared with Bill Nye.
[01:49:06.272 --> 01:49:14.976]  Bill Nye, at this March, the morning of it, went on TV to debate Will Happer, a man who's done over 200 peer-reviewed science publications.
[01:49:14.976 --> 01:49:20.338]  He's a legend at Harvard, a physicist who's a climate dissenter, a climate skeptic.
[01:49:20.338 --> 01:49:24.260]  Bill Nye had the audacity to insult him and tell CNN they had no
[01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:27.022]  I mean, he can't debate us, the chromosomes.
[01:49:50.302 --> 01:49:50.662]  Exactly.
[01:49:50.662 --> 01:49:53.543]  He can't debate us that chromosomes choose the sex.
[01:49:53.543 --> 01:49:54.523]  So he just doesn't want to debate us.
[01:49:54.523 --> 01:49:56.484]  He just says, oh, forget the scientists.
[01:49:56.484 --> 01:49:58.304]  I don't want to have them on about climate change.
[01:49:58.304 --> 01:49:59.505]  No, no, he's not real.
[01:49:59.505 --> 01:50:00.205]  I'm Bill Nye.
[01:50:00.205 --> 01:50:00.785]  I'm royal.
[01:50:00.785 --> 01:50:01.545]  Shut him up.
[01:50:01.545 --> 01:50:03.946]  Arrest Mark Moreno.
[01:50:03.946 --> 01:50:04.306]  Yes.
[01:50:04.306 --> 01:50:11.048]  In fact, when I interviewed him, I asked him specifically for the Climate Hustle film, what about Robert F. Kennedy calling people to be jailed?
[01:50:11.048 --> 01:50:14.689]  Bill Nye had no problem with jailing climate skeptics.
[01:50:14.689 --> 01:50:18.670]  And you asked me where this is going with the next step.
[01:50:19.370 --> 01:50:26.632]  At this People's Climate March, and these marches where Bill Nye attended, they have attorney generals of the United States from Democratic states.
[01:50:26.632 --> 01:50:29.053]  And the new tactic, Alex, this is what they're going after.
[01:50:29.053 --> 01:50:31.074]  You have a tornado in Oklahoma.
[01:50:31.074 --> 01:50:32.094]  You have a hurricane here.
[01:50:32.094 --> 01:50:33.315]  You have a severe storm.
[01:50:33.315 --> 01:50:34.635]  You have flooding in Tennessee.
[01:50:35.422 --> 01:50:46.044]  They are now, these attorney generals, are going to start going after energy companies as a shakedown and say you caused and made this bad weather worse in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida.
[01:50:46.044 --> 01:50:47.145]  Talk about quack BS!
[01:50:47.145 --> 01:50:47.685]  Let's talk about that.
[01:50:47.685 --> 01:50:49.945]  And they're going to go after them and start suing them for damages.
[01:50:49.945 --> 01:50:56.046]  This is the new venue and there's no reason to think it won't be successful given all the judges Obama's appointed.
[01:50:56.046 --> 01:50:57.147]  I don't see how- Stay there.
[01:50:57.147 --> 01:50:57.987]  I want to hear about this.
[01:50:59.878 --> 01:51:02.461]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[01:51:02.461 --> 01:51:04.604]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[01:51:04.604 --> 01:51:06.586]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[01:51:06.586 --> 01:51:08.649]  Find your happiness with Pure Soap.

[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:01.381]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:52:01.381 --> 01:52:07.943]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:52:07.943 --> 01:52:11.104]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[01:52:11.104 --> 01:52:20.828]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[01:52:20.828 --> 01:52:21.668]  Caveman.
[01:52:21.668 --> 01:52:26.730]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[01:52:26.730 --> 01:52:28.831]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[01:52:29.131 --> 01:52:32.273]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:52:32.273 --> 01:52:37.375]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:52:37.375 --> 01:52:45.499]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[01:52:45.499 --> 01:52:53.403]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[01:52:53.403 --> 01:52:58.045]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLife.com today.
[01:52:59.226 --> 01:53:00.027]  This is Dan Pilla.

[01:53:28.564 --> 01:53:31.125]  We use cell phones against our heads every day.
[01:53:31.125 --> 01:53:32.525]  But now a landmark U.S.

[01:54:04.875 --> 01:54:06.718]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:54:06.718 --> 01:54:08.821]  Crashes of the lies and disinformation.
[01:54:08.821 --> 01:54:13.208]  Mike Cernovich is coming up after I go to Robert and Beth and a few others that have been holding the longest.
[01:54:13.208 --> 01:54:14.710]  But I'll continue with your calls in the next hour.
[01:54:16.184 --> 01:54:17.625]  Then Cernovich will host the fourth hour.
[01:54:17.625 --> 01:54:21.789]  We're about to launch a bunch of new live shows on radio TV here in the next few months, so get ready for that.
[01:54:21.789 --> 01:54:23.911]  We're just beta testing it all right now.
[01:54:23.911 --> 01:54:26.353]  We've got to expand what we're doing in the face of the globalists.
[01:54:26.353 --> 01:54:27.714]  Mark Moreno is our guest.
[01:54:27.714 --> 01:54:34.219]  Folks, I know our audience, most of you know, that man-made climate change is made up and it's a scam for carbon taxes, okay?
[01:54:34.219 --> 01:54:36.141]  The public still doesn't get it.
[01:54:36.141 --> 01:54:37.662]  They're brainwashing kids in schools.
[01:54:37.662 --> 01:54:43.307]  Lord Monckton and Moreno have made them pull it out of schools in the UK because the inconvenient truth has been proven to be a total lie.
[01:54:45.043 --> 01:54:47.064]  But we're far from winning this.
[01:54:47.064 --> 01:54:48.525]  So we've got to get more aggressive.
[01:54:48.525 --> 01:54:50.566]  We tend to think, you know, oh, we've already proven this.
[01:54:50.566 --> 01:54:54.128]  Just because Trump's having some victories doesn't mean we're out of the woods.
[01:54:54.128 --> 01:55:01.552]  And you look at how they're announcing they want to arrest people, 15 attorney generals being run by Cuomo out of New York.
[01:55:01.552 --> 01:55:05.194]  And you've got them saying, I saw this on the news, we're going to start lawsuits.
[01:55:05.194 --> 01:55:06.654]  Kids are suing Trump.
[01:55:06.654 --> 01:55:09.436]  They're suing energy companies saying, you're hurting my future.
[01:55:09.436 --> 01:55:11.517]  I guess they think they can get idiot juries with kids going,
[01:55:12.145 --> 01:55:14.326]  The carbon dioxide caused a tornado?
[01:55:14.326 --> 01:55:14.966]  I'm scared!
[01:55:14.966 --> 01:55:17.286]  Oh, let me give you a 50 billion, baby.
[01:55:17.286 --> 01:55:20.267]  Meanwhile, General Electric's, you know, given some waiver by Obama.
[01:55:20.267 --> 01:55:24.148]  So, this is racketeering, and they know what they're doing.
[01:55:24.148 --> 01:55:27.829]  So I want to ask Mark how we defeat this briefly, and then the whole Comey thing.
[01:55:27.829 --> 01:55:32.210]  What do you think to that?
[01:55:32.210 --> 01:55:34.091]  Sorry, Mark, your audio hadn't turned up yet.
[01:55:34.091 --> 01:55:34.711]  Start over, go ahead.
[01:55:36.469 --> 01:55:46.939]  I interviewed, thank you, I'll first talk about the climate and then briefly on Comey, but I interviewed Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island, the man who wants to use racketeering, RICO statutes, against climate skeptics in the U.S.
[01:55:46.939 --> 01:55:48.961]  He absolutely defended his position.
[01:55:48.961 --> 01:56:01.752]  He said that he views climate skeptics as fraud, what climate skeptics like myself and others are engaging in, Lord Monckton, and because he believes that the science is so settled in his favor that any dissent
[01:56:02.333 --> 01:56:08.283]  And that's the same old brainwashing line they've had for 20 years.
[01:56:08.283 --> 01:56:11.148]  Just like chromosomes don't pick sex, the science is settled.
[01:56:12.341 --> 01:56:13.442]  Exactly.
[01:56:13.442 --> 01:56:19.207]  And they also, we touched on it when we went to the break, I may have had trouble hearing you and I was still talking, but they're calling it poisoned weather.
[01:56:19.207 --> 01:56:21.608]  That's why the science is so important.
[01:56:21.608 --> 01:56:23.330]  I went through every bit of extreme weather.
[01:56:23.330 --> 01:56:28.494]  Not only is extreme weather not getting worse, it's either at record low or declining trend, or at the best, no trend.
[01:56:28.494 --> 01:56:32.017]  But you turn the news on, they say hurricanes are worse than ever, even though they admit it's at a 30-year low.
[01:56:33.778 --> 01:56:34.098]  I know.
[01:56:34.098 --> 01:56:38.760]  And what they'll do, a lot of times what they'll say is that they'll mention an economic damage figure.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:45.383]  Well, any number, because of inflation and the cost of things, is going to be a lot worse than it was 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago.
[01:56:45.383 --> 01:56:47.824]  So you can always say, oh, the financial damages are on a record.
[01:56:47.824 --> 01:56:50.425]  And that's true because of inflation.
[01:56:50.425 --> 01:56:54.867]  But it's not true science-wise because of actual extreme... Sure, not in the aggregate.
[01:56:55.455 --> 01:56:58.798]  They're calling it poisoned weather, and that's what I find fascinating.
[01:56:58.798 --> 01:57:03.262]  And they're saying that fossil fuel, poisoned weather thing, again, no basis in science.
[01:57:03.262 --> 01:57:04.182]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:57:04.182 --> 01:57:05.443]  It's a shakedown.
[01:57:05.443 --> 01:57:09.367]  This is what Jesse Jackson used to do on Wall Street and Al Sharpton.
[01:57:09.367 --> 01:57:17.233]  They would go to the Wall Street companies and say, hey, you know, you have the black population as 11 percent and your company's only at 9 percent.
[01:57:17.233 --> 01:57:19.996]  You know, you got to pay us money or we're going to start filing suit.
[01:57:19.996 --> 01:57:21.137]  You're going to be paying millions.
[01:57:21.137 --> 01:57:22.238]  You're going to have bad PR.
[01:57:22.238 --> 01:57:23.439]  And the companies would pay up.
[01:57:23.439 --> 01:57:23.719]  And that's
[01:57:24.119 --> 01:57:24.840]  That's how they do it.
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:27.261]  They're going to start going after energy CEOs.
[01:57:27.261 --> 01:57:40.809]  I don't know how strong energy CEOs are going to be, Alex, that many even coal companies, oil companies, Rex Tillerson, President Trump's own Secretary of State, all support a, quote, seat at the table at the United Nations.
[01:57:40.809 --> 01:57:44.471]  I think the table should be upended, not a seat at the table.
[01:57:44.471 --> 01:57:47.853]  But that's... Sure, in closing, in closing, Comey, what do you think of the firing?
[01:57:48.997 --> 01:57:50.302]  I think it's a brilliant move.
[01:57:50.302 --> 01:57:51.928]  And here's one of the things that Donald Trump has done.
[01:57:51.928 --> 01:57:53.775]  I don't think the media understands this.
[01:57:54.392 --> 01:57:56.654]  He has a way of deflecting attention.
[01:57:56.654 --> 01:58:08.162]  He'll do something against the chattering media, including Fox News, including MSNBC, CNN, all of them, talking nonstop about the latest Trump, whether it's a Trump tweet, a Trump action.
[01:58:08.162 --> 01:58:13.125]  And meanwhile, he's then free to do, without any media scrutiny, the things that he's there to do.
[01:58:13.125 --> 01:58:19.350]  And what he's done is probably the greatest deregulatory stunt in the first hundred days of any president.
[01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:21.551]  Including Ronald Reagan.
[01:58:21.551 --> 01:58:26.292]  He's getting stuff done that he can get done immediately, and it's an amazing thing to watch.
[01:58:26.292 --> 01:58:30.414]  He's deflecting his attention with this kind of stuff with the media.
[01:58:30.414 --> 01:58:31.994]  I have no problem what he did with Comey.
[01:58:31.994 --> 01:58:35.696]  This is exactly what the media and the Democrats called for for months.
[01:58:35.696 --> 01:58:37.116]  That's right.
[01:58:37.116 --> 01:58:39.537]  ClimateDepot.com, a great job.
[01:58:39.537 --> 01:58:40.618]  Thank you so much.
[01:58:40.618 --> 01:58:40.858]  All right.
[01:58:40.858 --> 01:58:41.798]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[01:58:41.798 --> 01:58:42.798]  And Mike Cernovich, stay with us.
[01:58:42.798 --> 01:58:43.379]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:43.379 --> 01:58:43.779]  Spread the word.
[01:58:43.779 --> 01:58:44.839]  They're trying to censor us.
[01:58:44.839 --> 01:58:45.880]  SpreadInfoWars.com.
[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:46.980]  Don't let them stop us.
[01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:48.381]  It's an act of rebellion against tyranny.
[01:58:48.381 --> 01:58:49.161]  InfoWars.com.
[01:58:49.952 --> 01:58:55.356]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:58:55.356 --> 01:58:58.218]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:58:58.218 --> 01:59:00.200]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:05.224]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:59:05.224 --> 01:59:07.325]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:59:07.325 --> 01:59:08.606]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:59:08.606 --> 01:59:13.710]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:59:13.710 --> 01:59:17.073]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[01:59:17.213 --> 01:59:20.595]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:59:20.595 --> 01:59:23.597]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:59:23.597 --> 01:59:27.279]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:59:27.279 --> 01:59:34.183]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:59:34.183 --> 01:59:41.708]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[01:59:41.708 --> 01:59:44.630]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste.
[01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:46.191]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:46.191 --> 01:59:47.412]  A long way back to the Republic.
[01:59:47.412 --> 01:59:47.993]  And you want to be free.
[02:00:10.794 --> 02:00:15.316]  Make no mistake, we're pulling away.
[02:00:15.316 --> 02:00:24.181]  Let's say our ship was tied up in globalism, but the last year or two, all over the world, humanity's pulling away.
[02:00:24.181 --> 02:00:26.763]  Globalism's now a mile away.
[02:00:26.763 --> 02:00:29.364]  Soon we'll be over the horizon.
[02:00:29.364 --> 02:00:32.846]  Bye-bye, New World Order.
[02:00:32.846 --> 02:00:36.268]  The globalists are trying to suppress our development.
[02:00:36.268 --> 02:00:36.788]  They're failing.
[02:00:38.996 --> 02:00:49.361]  They want to suppress all the technology, all the new developments for themselves, and their greed, instead of just seeing humanity spread its wings.
[02:00:49.361 --> 02:00:53.923]  I'm here to tell you, my friends, it's harder than it looks to do this every day, but it's also a great blessing.
[02:00:53.923 --> 02:00:55.384]  Let's talk to Robert and then Beth.
[02:00:55.384 --> 02:00:56.464]  Thank you for holding so long.
[02:00:56.464 --> 02:00:58.445]  Robert, from North Carolina, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:00:58.445 --> 02:01:03.728]  What do you think of Chuckie Schumer, and as he told Trump that he'd regret this?
[02:01:03.728 --> 02:01:05.089]  Go ahead.
[02:01:05.089 --> 02:01:06.910]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, old boy?
[02:01:06.910 --> 02:01:07.590]  I'm good, my friend.
[02:01:08.291 --> 02:01:18.714]  Look here, I talked to the guy there earlier, apparently old Schumer went on the floor of the Senate this morning and asked McConnell to hold a classified briefing on the Comey firing.
[02:01:18.714 --> 02:01:29.537]  And I called both of my Senators, as soon as I saw it, the video is on YouTube, and I called both of my Senators and I suggested that they do it out in the open so we can all see it.
[02:01:29.537 --> 02:01:34.019]  No more classified myths, no more behind closed doors, Marshall Dillon it.
[02:01:34.019 --> 02:01:35.119]  If you believe it's right,
[02:01:36.081 --> 02:01:36.681]  Show it to us.
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:01.167]  You are describing what I refer to as a NAON.
[02:02:01.167 --> 02:02:07.263]  And the definition of that NAON is, it's a plant growth enhancer manufactured by a male bovine.
[02:02:08.090 --> 02:02:08.571]  Absolutely!
[02:02:08.571 --> 02:02:08.731]  Look,
[02:02:33.376 --> 02:02:34.356]  The proof's in the pudding.
[02:02:34.356 --> 02:02:36.397]  Christ said, just for you to buy its fruits.
[02:02:36.397 --> 02:02:38.538]  Three trillion in the stock market.
[02:02:38.538 --> 02:02:40.718]  Three hundred billion in new jobs.
[02:02:40.718 --> 02:02:42.939]  Half a million new jobs every month.
[02:02:42.939 --> 02:02:46.640]  Turning the corner economically.
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:48.480]  Turning our power supply back on.
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:49.881]  Securing our borders.
[02:02:49.881 --> 02:02:51.942]  Illegals down 43%.
[02:02:51.942 --> 02:02:53.742]  Taking ISIS out.
[02:02:53.742 --> 02:02:55.843]  Trump is delivering on so many fronts.
[02:02:55.843 --> 02:02:57.243]  I can't believe he's gotten this much done!
[02:02:57.243 --> 02:02:57.323]  Alex.
[02:03:01.598 --> 02:03:03.239]  But, uh, let me say this.
[02:03:03.239 --> 02:03:05.640]  President Trump has done a good job so far.
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:10.842]  Now, I'm one of these old boys, I disagree with myself sometimes just to have somebody to argue with.
[02:03:10.842 --> 02:03:11.342]  Sure, I agree.
[02:03:11.342 --> 02:03:14.143]  But, uh, let me say this.
[02:03:14.143 --> 02:03:19.745]  What he's done so far, pretty much most of it I'm going to agree with and go along with.
[02:03:19.745 --> 02:03:29.308]  I'm tired of carving the names of young Americans into granite and marble because those idiots in Washington can't tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys.
[02:03:29.887 --> 02:03:37.792]  Now my children tell me all the time that I grew up watching too many John Wayne movies where the good guys and the bad guys were clearly defined.
[02:03:37.792 --> 02:03:38.892]  You understand?
[02:03:38.892 --> 02:03:42.775]  But I still have this thing that I'm tired of being lied to.
[02:03:42.775 --> 02:03:51.380]  I'm tired of carving the names of young Americans into granite and marble based upon stuff that requires me to wear boots around the house when I'm listening to it.
[02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:51.900]  No, that's right.
[02:03:51.900 --> 02:03:53.601]  I appreciate your call.
[02:03:53.601 --> 02:03:57.964]  Trump is taking out the creation of Obama, ISIS, Al Qaeda.
[02:03:58.851 --> 02:04:00.532]  I mean, he really is destroying them.
[02:04:00.532 --> 02:04:02.773]  And that's why they're so pissed off right now.
[02:04:02.773 --> 02:04:05.495]  I mean, he's really going in and taking them out.
[02:04:05.495 --> 02:04:15.141]  And in the police actions of Vietnam and Korea, we were not allowed to win because the globals had a larger grand strategy.
[02:04:15.141 --> 02:04:19.323]  And Vietnam was actually covertly classified, called a war game.
[02:04:19.323 --> 02:04:23.206]  In fact, my dad, my family, but one of my dad's
[02:04:25.202 --> 02:04:25.762]  Family members.
[02:04:25.762 --> 02:04:28.524]  He used to... He's still alive.
[02:04:28.524 --> 02:04:30.406]  He's down in the... Billy, down in San Antonio.
[02:04:30.406 --> 02:04:31.707]  He's real old now.
[02:04:31.707 --> 02:04:33.348]  But he was in the CIA and much other stuff.
[02:04:33.348 --> 02:04:38.952]  And they would always wear this leather jacket that said, uh, Southeast Asia War Games, 1960 to 1975.
[02:04:38.952 --> 02:04:39.792]  So it really started in 1960, 1964.
[02:04:39.792 --> 02:04:40.753]  Second place.
[02:04:40.753 --> 02:04:42.014]  And that's all Vietnam was, was a war game.
[02:04:48.158 --> 02:04:52.681]  And it's all just, it was a great, the whole liberal thing, the whole counterculture.
[02:04:52.681 --> 02:04:55.343]  It was a war against America, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:55.343 --> 02:04:58.004]  We'll be back with Beth and others and Mike Cernovich.
[02:04:58.004 --> 02:04:58.425]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.031 --> 02:05:01.513]  December 23rd, 1776.
[02:05:01.513 --> 02:05:05.498]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[02:05:05.498 --> 02:05:10.504]  The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.
[02:05:10.504 --> 02:05:15.310]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:17.933]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[02:05:17.933 --> 02:05:19.675]  Yet we have this consolation with us.
[02:05:19.915 --> 02:05:22.916]  That the heart of the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[02:05:22.916 --> 02:05:25.936]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[02:05:25.936 --> 02:05:28.917]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[02:05:28.917 --> 02:05:32.038]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods.
[02:05:32.038 --> 02:05:37.639]  And it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[02:05:37.639 --> 02:05:41.760]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right
[02:05:41.980 --> 02:05:46.003]  Not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[02:05:46.003 --> 02:05:51.267]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[02:05:51.267 --> 02:05:56.230]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[02:05:57.131 --> 02:06:00.012]  Thomas Paine, the American Crisis.
[02:06:00.012 --> 02:06:08.456]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:06:08.456 --> 02:06:21.402]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslive.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[02:06:21.402 --> 02:06:21.942]  Caveman.
[02:06:22.242 --> 02:06:27.307]  It's those people living in the wilds, having to actually build civilization, that are our superior ancestors.
[02:06:27.307 --> 02:06:29.729]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:06:29.729 --> 02:06:32.892]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:06:32.892 --> 02:06:35.154]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking.
[02:06:35.154 --> 02:06:38.037]  But you used the bones for strength.
[02:06:38.037 --> 02:06:43.402]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[02:06:43.402 --> 02:06:45.744]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[02:06:46.164 --> 02:06:54.090]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:06:54.090 --> 02:06:58.292]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4Hlife.com today.
[02:06:59.517 --> 02:07:00.337]  Hey, everyone!
[02:07:00.337 --> 02:07:02.619]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[02:07:02.619 --> 02:07:06.461]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:07:06.461 --> 02:07:08.542]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:07:08.542 --> 02:07:18.828]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:07:18.828 --> 02:07:24.811]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:07:25.211 --> 02:07:25.632]  We're good to go.
[02:07:40.228 --> 02:07:40.809]  I think so.
[02:08:04.522 --> 02:08:11.384]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[02:08:11.384 --> 02:08:20.186]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[02:08:20.186 --> 02:08:22.927]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:30.725 --> 02:08:37.750]  Alright, if you're just joining us for this segment, then I'll continue with news clips, articles, and your phone calls at the start of the next segment right through to the end of the hour.
[02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:59.106]  Then Mike Cernovich will host the fourth hour as we beta test and prepare to launch the next few months a whole bunch of new shows that go on commercial radio, slash television, you name it, as we promise to expand in the face of the enemy and continue to defeat them and change the world thanks to your support, your prayers, and the fact that you're marching right beside us.
[02:08:59.106 --> 02:08:59.907]  Comey, he's out!
[02:09:00.899 --> 02:09:07.844]  The arrogance of Comey, the arrogance of Brennan, the Wahhabi Islamicist at the CIA, saying, watch your mouth Mr. President.
[02:09:07.844 --> 02:09:13.427]  You heard Cernovich weeks ago say that there's going to be leaks and that McMaster is going to be on the way out.
[02:09:13.427 --> 02:09:15.529]  That's now mainstream news today.
[02:09:15.529 --> 02:09:28.758]  So we've all got interesting, informative sources, but my intel is Comey was so erratic, so weird, wouldn't go after the Clintons for all their corruption, kept saying one thing, doing another, and was basically working for Deep State
[02:09:29.747 --> 02:09:33.750]  Blocking all the pedophile-gate investigations that Trump's expanded.
[02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:37.232]  Blocking what the Attorney General wanted to do that was constitutional.
[02:09:37.232 --> 02:09:45.078]  And basically they're wanting to expand the fake Russia investigation, while doing nothing about Hillary and Obama, to a type of false blackmail.
[02:09:45.078 --> 02:09:49.261]  Just to keep things going innuendo, even though they can produce nothing in the congressional hearings.
[02:09:50.267 --> 02:09:51.928]  When they themselves have all the Russia connections.
[02:09:51.928 --> 02:09:53.369]  Now, I haven't talked to Mike Cernovich.
[02:09:53.369 --> 02:10:01.654]  I don't know what his sources are, but he's always got big breaking news, which always turned out to be so accurate, which even CNN has to admit, okay, Cernovich has got these amazing White House sources.
[02:10:01.654 --> 02:10:03.175]  Yeah, because CNN's not trusted.
[02:10:03.175 --> 02:10:04.436]  Mike Cernovich is.
[02:10:04.436 --> 02:10:05.477]  Infowars is.
[02:10:05.477 --> 02:10:11.201]  So, Mike, tell us what's coming up here in more detail in the fourth hour today that you'll be hosting.
[02:10:12.248 --> 02:10:17.332]  We'll do Alex, but before I go I just really want to give a shout out to your production people.
[02:10:17.332 --> 02:10:24.497]  I send them stuff and they have it all preloaded and that's only possible because of the support from the readers and listeners.
[02:10:24.497 --> 02:10:27.880]  I think a lot of people maybe don't realize how spectacular
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:28.800]  We're good to go.
[02:10:49.093 --> 02:10:50.555]  Yeah, so I'm just blown away.
[02:10:50.555 --> 02:10:56.381]  And of course, that is only possible because people buy the products and which are good for their health anyway.
[02:10:56.381 --> 02:11:03.088]  So it's always important because a lot of people they don't realize the behind the scenes operation and I'm blown up.
[02:11:03.088 --> 02:11:05.010]  Nico, like he blows me away.
[02:11:05.010 --> 02:11:07.112]  I'll send him stuff and he's like, all right, we got it.
[02:11:07.112 --> 02:11:09.354]  Five seconds later, it's on the screen.
[02:11:09.354 --> 02:11:11.477]  For example, Ricky Waddell.
[02:11:12.197 --> 02:11:20.300]  Politico has now confirmed a story that I broke on InfoWars, which was that McMaster was going to bring in Ricky Wiedel as his deputy.
[02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:22.381]  You said that two weeks ago?
[02:11:22.381 --> 02:11:24.542]  Yeah, and they're calling it exclusive.
[02:11:24.542 --> 02:11:25.322]  Scoop!
[02:11:25.322 --> 02:11:26.022]  Big scoop!
[02:11:26.022 --> 02:11:26.983]  No credit to you.
[02:11:26.983 --> 02:11:34.585]  In fact, can we pull up the article from two weeks ago to type in, Cernovich, Wiedel brought in without asking Trump.
[02:11:34.585 --> 02:11:35.326]  What was the exact headline?
[02:11:35.326 --> 02:11:35.946]  It was something like that.
[02:11:36.479 --> 02:11:41.642]  Something like that, yeah, and I texted it to Nico, so I think they have it preloaded, already ready to go.
[02:11:55.689 --> 02:11:56.670]  There's another one.
[02:11:56.670 --> 02:12:00.095]  Eli Lake is doing great work.
[02:12:00.095 --> 02:12:02.518]  President McMaster to meet with Trump.
[02:12:02.518 --> 02:12:05.042]  Discuss who is running the White House.
[02:12:05.042 --> 02:12:05.723]  And then here it is.
[02:12:05.723 --> 02:12:07.325]  But I want to find the one we had on InfoWars.
[02:12:07.325 --> 02:12:08.486]  We had a video.
[02:12:08.486 --> 02:12:11.430]  I just want to show people because Politico never gives you credit.
[02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:11.651]  Go ahead.
[02:12:12.580 --> 02:12:26.767]  Right, so this is all information we have been developing on InfoWars with you and Paul Joseph Watson, Paul the Great, how the big picture now, personnel is policy, and Petraeus now is totally in control of the NSC.
[02:12:26.767 --> 02:12:31.169]  He has brought in, yeah there you go, there's the story, May 3rd, of course it's extremely
[02:12:31.169 --> 02:12:40.333]  Exclusive now Politico scoop right even though this real news was brought in here at InfoWars We're breaking news here so fast.
[02:12:40.333 --> 02:12:57.441]  We can't keep track We're now breaking so many stories between all of us that sometimes we forget to write about them And then I'm like oh yeah Alex, and I we talked about that one exactly I mean I have it from multiple sources I want to ask you next but I'm glad you went back to just prove again how accurate you are in more sources than I even have
[02:12:58.533 --> 02:12:59.293]  I've been told.
[02:12:59.293 --> 02:13:02.575]  No, they're trying to blackmail the president with fake Russia stuff.
[02:13:02.575 --> 02:13:03.655]  He's done.
[02:13:03.655 --> 02:13:07.176]  He said, listen, you can investigate me all day, but go after Hillary, go after Obama.
[02:13:07.176 --> 02:13:08.677]  They're the ones in bed with Russia.
[02:13:08.677 --> 02:13:10.138]  They're in bed with the radical Muslims.
[02:13:10.138 --> 02:13:10.818]  Trump is done.
[02:13:10.818 --> 02:13:11.298]  I love it.
[02:13:11.298 --> 02:13:12.118]  He needs to go on the offense.
[02:13:12.118 --> 02:13:15.540]  But the point is, these are just bombshell breaking stories here.
[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:19.121]  And I love how the whore media never has to admit that we're correct.
[02:13:19.121 --> 02:13:19.421]  Go ahead.
[02:13:19.421 --> 02:13:20.522]  Sorry.
[02:13:20.522 --> 02:13:20.982]  Right.
[02:13:20.982 --> 02:13:23.183]  So the Comey thing, the reason Comey is out.
[02:13:24.131 --> 02:13:31.293]  They wanted him out in October because Comey has done nothing but cover up the crimes of the Clinton crime family.
[02:13:31.293 --> 02:13:42.655]  The IT guy, Hillary's IT guy, a story that was broken on Infowars and other places, he went on Reddit and asked for advice on how to delete emails after he had been subpoenaed.
[02:13:42.655 --> 02:13:43.775]  That's right.
[02:13:43.775 --> 02:13:44.155]  Right?
[02:13:44.155 --> 02:13:46.036]  And then Comey says there's no intent.
[02:13:46.036 --> 02:13:51.597]  Oh, we couldn't prove criminal... He's in public asking how to abscond evidence.
[02:13:52.642 --> 02:13:59.765]  Yeah, and your people can probably find that one if they look up Stone Tear Reddit, or Stone Tear, however it was spelled, Reddit.
[02:13:59.765 --> 02:14:00.806]  We got him!
[02:14:00.806 --> 02:14:10.210]  Smoking Gun, Hillary Clinton's IT guy, who then pled to fit before Congress, was caught admitting to a felony, felony obstruction of justice.
[02:14:10.210 --> 02:14:13.112]  Comey said, oh, but we can't, we can't prove intent.
[02:14:13.112 --> 02:14:19.835]  But meanwhile, some guy on a nuclear sub takes a picture because he wants to show his grandkids one day what Grandpa did.
[02:14:20.335 --> 02:14:22.197]  That guy is in federal prison.
[02:14:22.197 --> 02:14:23.878]  Dishonorable discharge.
[02:14:23.878 --> 02:14:25.659]  Many, many stories like that.
[02:14:25.659 --> 02:14:29.502]  But when it comes to the Clinton crime family, Comey says, oh, we can't prove it.
[02:14:29.502 --> 02:14:33.125]  And of course, Comey was hated by the FBI.
[02:14:33.125 --> 02:14:38.989]  All of my FBI people told me, they go, Cernovich, we need him out of there because he's such a joke.
[02:14:38.989 --> 02:14:41.031]  He's not a real law enforcement officer.
[02:14:41.031 --> 02:14:42.092]  He's a political hack.
[02:14:43.359 --> 02:14:44.480]  And let's expand.
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:49.507]  With no sources, the media today, the liberal media... Oh, the FBI cried!
[02:14:49.507 --> 02:14:54.653]  Oh, they love Comey!
[02:14:54.653 --> 02:14:55.775]  So where is this going now?
[02:14:57.190 --> 02:14:59.131]  Well, there's been a couple big developments.
[02:14:59.131 --> 02:15:07.375]  One is that Petraeus had personally told McMaster that he's not allowed to leave the NSC and that was why Waddell finally got approved.
[02:15:07.375 --> 02:15:12.737]  So Petraeus is actually in charge of the NSC, not McMaster.
[02:15:12.737 --> 02:15:21.041]  And if you look at some of the ties that Petraeus has with our good friend George, you will see who is really pulling the strings now of McMaster and Petraeus.
[02:15:21.721 --> 02:15:22.222]  Or Rico, yeah.
[02:15:42.438 --> 02:15:44.140]  Wow, that's just crazy.
[02:15:44.140 --> 02:15:47.404]  They were asking me what I wanted for lunch over here, and I'm like, I want this Puerto Rico place.
[02:15:47.404 --> 02:15:48.565]  I guess that went out of our air.
[02:15:48.565 --> 02:15:51.689]  Kind of multitasking here behind the scenes, teleprompter free.
[02:15:51.689 --> 02:15:58.678]  You know, Mike, looking at this, I'm not somebody that wants a violent revolution.
[02:15:58.678 --> 02:15:59.899]  The globalists are calling for it.
[02:15:59.899 --> 02:16:00.580]  They're pushing it.
[02:16:00.580 --> 02:16:01.241]  It's out of control.
[02:16:03.635 --> 02:16:05.777]  Trump needs to go after the globalist traitors.
[02:16:05.777 --> 02:16:08.540]  They're the people that have hijacked the country for corporations.
[02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:10.342]  They're the real threat, not the Russians.
[02:16:10.342 --> 02:16:11.983]  The Chinese are a major threat.
[02:16:11.983 --> 02:16:16.628]  I'm not in bed with the Russians, I just don't see them involved in our internal politics like the communist Chinese.
[02:16:16.628 --> 02:16:18.390]  They have been involved with Hillary, though.
[02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:19.731]  What do you think Trump needs to do?
[02:16:19.731 --> 02:16:23.235]  And from your sources, what is the word of where Trump may be going?
[02:16:23.235 --> 02:16:24.556]  Because I think he needs to go total offense.
[02:16:24.556 --> 02:16:26.438]  Because they're clearly going to try to overthrow him if he doesn't.
[02:16:27.369 --> 02:16:36.111]  Yeah, I'm hearing that they're going to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton and the obstruction of justice of her IT guy, who never should have got a pass.
[02:16:36.111 --> 02:16:44.213]  Uma and Anthony Weiner, of course, have pedophile connections, and Weiner himself had child pornography on his phone and disseminated child pornography.
[02:16:44.213 --> 02:16:45.813]  So Weiner was going to get a pass, too.
[02:16:45.813 --> 02:16:46.654]  Anthony Weiner did.
[02:16:46.654 --> 02:16:48.834]  Uma, who of course covered all this up.
[02:16:48.834 --> 02:16:52.635]  So I'm hearing now that the field agents were furious at Comey
[02:16:53.385 --> 02:16:57.592]  Because they weren't able to investigate these criminals.
[02:16:57.592 --> 02:17:00.596]  That was why the FBI are celebrating.
[02:17:00.596 --> 02:17:04.603]  The real agents, the real law enforcement people, you know the FBI people, they are...
[02:17:05.302 --> 02:17:09.164]  They play it so straight that it's hard to even crack a joke with them.
[02:17:09.164 --> 02:17:10.044]  Like, what do you mean?
[02:17:10.044 --> 02:17:12.105]  We don't joke around with the FBI.
[02:17:12.105 --> 02:17:17.148]  And the real top professional people are as nonpartisan as it comes.
[02:17:17.148 --> 02:17:21.329]  And they hated Comey and how he was playing favorites.
[02:17:21.329 --> 02:17:25.031]  Let's take Andrew McCabe, who is the acting director right now.
[02:17:25.031 --> 02:17:27.692]  His wife ran for Democrat, Senate, involved.
[02:17:27.692 --> 02:17:28.713]  And we need to get rid of him, too.
[02:17:30.287 --> 02:17:39.439]  Yeah, McCabe is next because McCabe actually has an Inspector General investigation against him for conflicts of interest because his wife had raised $650,000.
[02:17:39.439 --> 02:17:40.100]  This is deep state.
[02:17:40.100 --> 02:17:40.461]  This is why.
[02:17:43.593 --> 02:17:44.874]  It's hard not to lose your mind.
[02:17:44.874 --> 02:17:46.516]  You just have to laugh a lot.
[02:17:46.516 --> 02:17:55.746]  McCabe's wife raised, I believe, $650,000 for Hillary Clinton, and yet McCabe was the person who was investigating the email.
[02:17:55.746 --> 02:17:57.608]  And then there's another guy, David Loftman.
[02:17:57.608 --> 02:18:00.230]  This is a story I broke, too.
[02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:02.413]  I'll get this to Nikko, or they can go to my Medium page.
[02:18:03.104 --> 02:18:17.235]  So David Loffman, who is counter-espionage, chief of counter-intelligence at the FBI, he was also a Hillary Clinton donor, or he was an Obama donor rather, and he was also supposed to investigate the Hillary Clinton email thing.
[02:18:17.235 --> 02:18:19.036]  That is, that is how corrupt DPC is.
[02:18:19.036 --> 02:18:25.941]  Yeah, how do you have political, let me ask you this, how many globalist Democrats have infested the FBI?
[02:18:25.941 --> 02:18:26.842]  I mean, how bad is it?
[02:18:27.802 --> 02:18:31.386]  At the highest level, they're in complete and total control.
[02:18:31.386 --> 02:18:33.508]  The field agents are still the good guys.
[02:18:33.508 --> 02:18:36.030]  They're the people who they really believe in America.
[02:18:36.030 --> 02:18:38.393]  They're the people who leak us information.
[02:18:38.393 --> 02:18:49.805]  Because the FBI used to be very tight-lipped, but they were tired of watching these deep state globalist agents destroy the integrity and reputation of the FBI and the prestige, as Trump noted, of the FBI.
[02:18:50.689 --> 02:18:53.712]  And they've been, of course, leaking us a lot of information, which they don't do right.
[02:18:53.712 --> 02:18:57.015]  So David Loffman was an Obama donor.
[02:18:57.015 --> 02:18:59.358]  That is how infested Deep State is.
[02:18:59.358 --> 02:19:05.664]  So the head of counterintelligence, he has all classified information passed by his desk, right?
[02:19:05.664 --> 02:19:10.729]  He is the one who would not allow an investigation that the FBI leaks.
[02:19:10.729 --> 02:19:13.372]  That's another story the fake news media isn't reporting.
[02:19:13.372 --> 02:19:14.553]  Comey and Loffman
[02:19:15.313 --> 02:19:20.757]  Conspired to prevent anybody from investigating who was making these leaks.
[02:19:20.757 --> 02:19:22.419]  Well, that's because it was Lafman.
[02:19:22.419 --> 02:19:31.446]  He was the one... That's right, so these are the people blocking the course of justice when it's so obvious and so absolutely blaring that the Clintons and Obamas committed all these crimes.
[02:19:31.446 --> 02:19:33.448]  And so thank God, I think this signifies...
[02:19:34.778 --> 02:19:36.379]  Skip this break, I have to do it.
[02:19:36.379 --> 02:19:45.927]  I think this signifies that Trump is getting ready to actually serve justice on them after 111 days of them waging war against him with lies.
[02:19:45.927 --> 02:19:55.895]  He hasn't wanted to go on the offense, but now, to get our agenda through to save the republic, I think Trump needs to go big guns on them politically, and I think it's time that the American people want heads to roll.
[02:19:55.895 --> 02:19:57.436]  I think it's time to lock their asses up.
[02:19:58.433 --> 02:20:03.155]  Well, the way I've said it is Trump better do it or the people are going to do it.
[02:20:03.155 --> 02:20:04.575]  That's where we're at now.
[02:20:04.575 --> 02:20:18.281]  We're tired of watching innocent people, nobody, some Navy, some private first class, some enzyme, some low level person in the Navy lose his life because he's 19 years old and takes a picture.
[02:20:18.761 --> 02:20:25.703]  You think about it, some 19-year-old kid takes a picture because one day he's going to be a grandpa and they're going to say, Granddad, what did you do in the Navy?
[02:20:25.703 --> 02:20:27.983]  And he's going to say, I was on a nuclear submarine.
[02:20:27.983 --> 02:20:30.123]  He never even shared that with anybody.
[02:20:30.123 --> 02:20:35.044]  That guy rots in federal prison, loses his GI Bill, loses his VA benefits.
[02:20:35.044 --> 02:20:36.425]  His whole life is destroyed.
[02:20:36.425 --> 02:20:37.725]  Convicted felon.
[02:20:37.725 --> 02:20:38.385]  Can't vote.
[02:20:38.385 --> 02:20:41.646]  And then Hillary has 30,000 secret emails she's selling to foreign governments.
[02:20:41.646 --> 02:20:42.006]  It's okay.
[02:20:43.052 --> 02:20:43.492]  Right.
[02:20:43.492 --> 02:20:46.075]  Taking money from the Saudis.
[02:20:46.075 --> 02:20:47.736]  Oh, shoot, shoot.
[02:20:47.736 --> 02:20:48.777]  Judicial Watch.
[02:20:48.777 --> 02:20:50.019]  I forgot to tell you this one.
[02:20:50.019 --> 02:20:51.900]  I don't know if you guys covered it already.
[02:20:51.900 --> 02:20:57.185]  They discovered emails proving that pedophiles went to Haiti to try to adopt children.
[02:20:57.185 --> 02:20:57.446]  Sure.
[02:20:57.446 --> 02:20:58.507]  So that's another story.
[02:20:58.507 --> 02:21:02.310]  Now we've got the Clinton Foundation lady caught chipping kids in illegally.
[02:21:02.310 --> 02:21:04.913]  Now she's changed her name and runs another kid's charity.
[02:21:05.874 --> 02:21:07.615]  Right, and that was the story you were all over.
[02:21:07.615 --> 02:21:16.758]  So Judicial Watch got official State Department emails where they admit now that pedophiles were going to Haiti to adopt children.
[02:21:16.758 --> 02:21:18.479]  And that was a big story you broke.
[02:21:18.479 --> 02:21:20.619]  And everybody goes, oh, there's a conspiracy theory.
[02:21:20.619 --> 02:21:22.220]  That's crazy, Alex.
[02:21:22.220 --> 02:21:23.581]  You're just losing your mind.
[02:21:23.581 --> 02:21:24.401]  Well, now it's proven.
[02:21:25.194 --> 02:21:26.755]  Emails, official emails.
[02:21:26.755 --> 02:21:34.602]  Pedophiles went to Haiti, and now we know why the Haitians hate the Clinton family with the fire of a thousand suns.
[02:21:34.602 --> 02:21:35.282]  Wow.
[02:21:35.282 --> 02:21:40.466]  Mike Cernovich, you are going to be hosting a full hour, and soon, multi-hour show every day.
[02:21:40.466 --> 02:21:41.387]  We're very, very excited.
[02:21:41.387 --> 02:21:42.408]  I need to talk to you about who you want to...
[02:21:42.788 --> 02:21:48.995]  A lot of young people too, like, I thought about, you know, cause you and I, we talked about, we're very excited about this and this is why reader support is so important.
[02:21:48.995 --> 02:21:49.796]  I tried the, uh, that caveman stuff.
[02:22:04.611 --> 02:22:24.831]  When I was in Austin that stuff is really good it's great for the joints and everything too and that's what a lot of people realize is if they want more content more shows the globalist killers kind of shows then that's why you take the supplements it's also good for your health and it'll make you feel better and it supports the operation so Alex and I have been talking about
[02:22:25.616 --> 02:22:31.199]  Like, think about like a show like Fox, The Five, but it would be like the five globalist killers, right?
[02:22:31.199 --> 02:22:36.501]  We could have in some young people, some millennials, some real savages, that just, they don't want to be friends.
[02:22:36.501 --> 02:22:40.343]  Like, Alex and I, we don't want to be friends with the establishment.
[02:22:40.343 --> 02:22:42.504]  There's so much talent out there right now.
[02:22:42.504 --> 02:22:44.565]  Yeah, they're the failure, they're the joke, they're the problem.
[02:22:44.565 --> 02:22:45.766]  We're not looking to be accepted.
[02:22:47.178 --> 02:22:48.698]  Again, I've turned down Fox News shows.
[02:22:48.698 --> 02:22:50.479]  It's all about, we don't want to be with them.
[02:22:50.479 --> 02:22:51.619]  We want our own thing.
[02:22:51.619 --> 02:22:53.860]  We want to bring America back 2.0.
[02:22:53.860 --> 02:22:55.140]  It's absolutely beautiful.
[02:22:55.140 --> 02:22:57.620]  Alright, Mike Cernovich, you're going to be here in the fourth hour.
[02:22:57.620 --> 02:22:58.801]  Thank you so much.
[02:22:58.801 --> 02:23:01.261]  And again, you've got DangerInPlay.com.
[02:23:01.261 --> 02:23:03.822]  You've also got Medium at Cernovich.
[02:23:03.822 --> 02:23:05.462]  How do people follow you on Twitter?
[02:23:05.462 --> 02:23:06.842]  Tell people about that.
[02:23:06.842 --> 02:23:10.643]  Yeah, you can follow me at Cernovich, C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H.
[02:23:10.643 --> 02:23:13.824]  And whatever I tweet today, you're going to read about in the newspaper a couple weeks from now.
[02:23:14.995 --> 02:23:15.495]  Absolutely.
[02:23:15.495 --> 02:23:20.778]  In fact, that's the slogan for years we wanted to change from the front lines of truth journalism to info wars or so much whatever.
[02:23:20.778 --> 02:23:22.259]  The truth is here.
[02:23:22.259 --> 02:23:23.860]  The truth does live here.
[02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:25.701]  And we're just telling it like it is.
[02:23:25.701 --> 02:23:26.762]  We do have the real sources.
[02:23:26.762 --> 02:23:27.442]  Everybody knows that.
[02:23:30.492 --> 02:23:33.775]  You'll learn about stuff here a year before, a month before, weeks before.
[02:23:33.775 --> 02:23:47.108]  But more and more, see that's the thing, if we weren't, if Cernovich and Drudge and myself and others weren't always forcing it, you wouldn't see, in fact that's one more point Cernovich, I'm going to let you go because I've got to get ready for the next hour, I want to go to calls.
[02:23:47.108 --> 02:23:50.491]  It's not just that we're ahead of them, we force them to finally report it.
[02:23:51.522 --> 02:23:51.782]  Right.
[02:23:51.782 --> 02:23:57.864]  We drive the news cycle, which is what most people don't understand is we keep pushing and pushing.
[02:23:57.864 --> 02:24:04.026]  And then, of course, the info warriors who are listening in, they share the links, they get those emergency broadcasts out.
[02:24:04.026 --> 02:24:06.066]  It becomes such a big conversation.
[02:24:06.066 --> 02:24:15.909]  Remember that the fake news media would not cover WikiLeaks until Paul Joseph Watson, you, me, Jack Pasovic, we, you know, Brittany Pettibone, who's great.
[02:24:15.909 --> 02:24:17.330]  She's been on your show.
[02:24:17.330 --> 02:24:18.190]  We were out there.
[02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:24.515]  And we talked about it all weekend and the story got so big that the fake news media couldn't... Just like Hillary's collapse.
[02:24:24.515 --> 02:24:26.057]  They wouldn't report it for two days.
[02:24:26.057 --> 02:24:28.959]  Then they would not show when she actually fell down.
[02:24:28.959 --> 02:24:32.883]  They said we were fake news, but everybody 20 million times saw it on YouTube.
[02:24:32.883 --> 02:24:34.224]  So then it blew up in their face again.
[02:24:34.224 --> 02:24:35.785]  Imagine the arrogance of CNN, MSNBC.
[02:24:36.946 --> 02:24:45.032]  When there is video of her falling on her face, they go, oh Alex Jones and others are lying and Paul Watson and Cernovich, she didn't fall down, fake news.
[02:24:45.032 --> 02:24:46.973]  And they don't show her falling down.
[02:24:46.973 --> 02:24:50.436]  Don't they know everyone went and saw the full clip and know what liars they are?
[02:24:50.436 --> 02:24:53.198]  They're losing touch with reality.
[02:24:53.928 --> 02:24:58.314]  But the way I look at it is the mantra is we are now too big to ignore.
[02:24:58.314 --> 02:24:59.615]  You can't ignore us.
[02:24:59.615 --> 02:25:00.557]  You can trash us.
[02:25:00.557 --> 02:25:01.538]  You can bash us.
[02:25:01.538 --> 02:25:03.100]  Call us conspiracy theories.
[02:25:03.100 --> 02:25:04.181]  It doesn't even matter.
[02:25:04.181 --> 02:25:09.689]  And the reason we're too big to ignore because everybody listening here is supporting the effort in their own way.
[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:11.541]  By the way, you mentioned this.
[02:25:11.541 --> 02:25:14.723]  I don't want to brag about us, but our listeners need to know that we're having a big effect.
[02:25:14.723 --> 02:25:16.404]  They're the reason it's happening, literally.
[02:25:16.404 --> 02:25:17.005]  They are the power.
[02:25:17.005 --> 02:25:18.686]  They're the oxygen in this whole universe.
[02:25:18.686 --> 02:25:19.427]  They're the intel.
[02:25:19.427 --> 02:25:20.468]  They're the people that resist.
[02:25:20.468 --> 02:25:22.369]  They're the ones that see through the propaganda.
[02:25:22.369 --> 02:25:23.970]  They're the strong that weren't susceptible.
[02:25:23.970 --> 02:25:25.351]  I mean, they're the heroes here.
[02:25:25.351 --> 02:25:26.052]  It's not us.
[02:25:26.052 --> 02:25:26.992]  It's them.
[02:25:26.992 --> 02:25:29.795]  It's all of us together.
[02:25:29.795 --> 02:25:30.976]  They need to understand that
[02:25:31.983 --> 02:25:35.207]  You told me this months ago, and I already knew this, but we should talk about this more.
[02:25:35.207 --> 02:25:39.932]  When I'm actually around Huffington Post people, all these other folks are like, we really love what you're doing, actually.
[02:25:39.932 --> 02:25:41.694]  We appreciate the orders to do this.
[02:25:41.694 --> 02:25:44.657]  We wish we were free like you, thinking we have a job.
[02:25:44.657 --> 02:25:47.361]  And so they get all these hacks, they pay them almost nothing.
[02:25:47.361 --> 02:25:49.803]  They, even their own people, are all listening.
[02:25:50.544 --> 02:25:53.267]  And it's crazy that they're all listening.
[02:25:53.267 --> 02:25:55.549]  They have to pretend like they're not.
[02:25:55.549 --> 02:25:59.953]  And they even admit to me, we kind of write these half-assed things for our editors, but really we're just sending people to you.
[02:25:59.953 --> 02:26:06.940]  And you can see the articles where they're actually like, they're old twisted globalist editors don't even get that the fact that it's like Fight Club.
[02:26:06.940 --> 02:26:08.341]  They have no idea what they're in the middle of, Mike.
[02:26:09.423 --> 02:26:16.667]  Yeah, that's the thing everybody listening, they got to understand is if it weren't for people listening, you and I would have a diary.
[02:26:16.667 --> 02:26:17.808]  That is all we would be.
[02:26:17.808 --> 02:26:22.291]  We would have a diary, a video diary and a little diary like a little kid.
[02:26:22.291 --> 02:26:25.012]  But because the people amplify the message and get it out there.
[02:26:26.229 --> 02:26:26.910]  Yeah.
[02:26:26.910 --> 02:26:33.795]  So much so that a lot of these people who write hate articles about us, they secretly like us, but that's their job.
[02:26:33.795 --> 02:26:34.636]  They have to do it.
[02:26:34.636 --> 02:26:35.737]  And I don't begrudge them that.
[02:26:35.737 --> 02:26:36.737]  That's the game.
[02:26:36.737 --> 02:26:40.360]  The game is, you know, everybody has to make a living and what are you going to do?
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:46.445]  But the point is that the people now who are listening, they have to know how much they matter.
[02:26:46.445 --> 02:26:48.446]  Because without them, we would have a diary.
[02:26:48.446 --> 02:26:49.387]  We would be nobody.
[02:26:49.387 --> 02:26:50.588]  We would not matter at all.
[02:26:50.588 --> 02:26:52.690]  So everybody listening in, you have to remember.
[02:26:53.402 --> 02:26:58.424]  Don't ever let anybody tell you that you're nobody, that you don't matter, that you're just one person.
[02:26:58.424 --> 02:26:59.364]  That's nonsense.
[02:26:59.364 --> 02:27:00.524]  That's meant to make you feel weak.
[02:27:00.524 --> 02:27:02.385]  It's like Drudge always said.
[02:27:02.385 --> 02:27:04.786]  A blogger's just as important as the New York Times.
[02:27:04.786 --> 02:27:06.086]  In fact, I'll go further.
[02:27:06.086 --> 02:27:09.227]  The New York Times is so discredited, a blogger is more important.
[02:27:09.227 --> 02:27:18.050]  A video they shoot, an article they write, whether it's about coffee or flowers or their school or art they like or movies they like, what we originally believe
[02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:20.071]  This is prima facie.
[02:27:20.071 --> 02:27:24.673]  It's not corporate tells us this is our vision and we go with that.
[02:27:24.673 --> 02:27:26.314]  It's about us being individuals.
[02:27:26.314 --> 02:27:27.595]  Game over for the collectivist!
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:29.000]  Right.
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.022]  I tell that to everybody.
[02:27:31.022 --> 02:27:32.583]  People go, what can I do?
[02:27:32.583 --> 02:27:33.304]  I'm just saying.
[02:27:33.304 --> 02:27:35.445]  And I go, well, eliminate that from your vocabulary.
[02:27:35.445 --> 02:27:36.826]  You're just a whatever.
[02:27:36.826 --> 02:27:37.627]  You're a human being.
[02:27:37.627 --> 02:27:39.328]  You're one of God's creatures.
[02:27:39.328 --> 02:27:40.489]  Embrace the gifts.
[02:27:40.489 --> 02:27:42.431]  I want everybody on YouTube.
[02:27:42.431 --> 02:27:45.853]  If you are into knitting, I want you to have a YouTube video about knitting.
[02:27:45.853 --> 02:27:47.695]  But you talk about the truth while you're knitting.
[02:27:47.695 --> 02:27:49.816]  As you're knitting, you're red-pilling people.
[02:27:49.816 --> 02:27:52.078]  Or while you're playing video games or while you're gardening.
[02:27:52.078 --> 02:27:54.280]  Just speak it, you know?
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:55.320]  All right, Mike.
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:27:57.822]  In 30 minutes, you're on Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:27:57.822 --> 02:27:58.323]  Thank you, my friend.

[02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:39.092]  The Children's is back in stock without the peppermint because it's a little bit strong and concentrated.
[02:28:39.092 --> 02:28:41.174]  We have the bubblegum flavor, natural flavor there.
[02:28:41.174 --> 02:28:43.195]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.

[02:28:50.318 --> 02:28:51.938]  You build it.

[02:28:53.399 --> 02:28:55.239]  It's not just I'm building it, you come.
[02:28:55.239 --> 02:28:56.599]  You build it.
[02:28:56.599 --> 02:29:07.402]  When you get a t-shirt, or you get a water filter, you get some non-GMO heirloom seeds, or you get a shortwave radio, or you get a Vortex great scope at a very low price, best scopes out there for the price.

[02:29:10.983 --> 02:29:11.523]  See what's there.
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:17.322]  And then you're funding us, getting a great product at a very affordable price.
[02:29:17.322 --> 02:29:20.243]  The Vortex Venom Red Dot is an amazing system.

[02:29:22.904 --> 02:29:23.904]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:29:23.904 --> 02:29:29.907]  Or MFullWarsStore.com is again the big main site.
[02:29:29.907 --> 02:29:33.908]  Subsite MFullWarsLife.com takes you right to the supplements.
[02:29:33.908 --> 02:29:35.609]  It's one of our main funders as well.
[02:29:36.369 --> 02:29:38.851]  And, uh, you know, every door closes, more open.
[02:29:38.851 --> 02:29:41.113]  We're under massive attack and we've never been stronger.
[02:29:41.113 --> 02:29:43.416]  And I owe it all to God in your prayers.
[02:29:43.416 --> 02:29:45.117]  So most importantly, please pray for us.
[02:29:45.117 --> 02:29:46.278]  Your calls are three minutes away.
[02:29:46.278 --> 02:29:49.141]  Please stay with us.
[02:29:49.141 --> 02:29:50.542]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.542 --> 02:29:53.064]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.064 --> 02:29:55.727]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.231 --> 02:30:05.096]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com with some patriotic quotes by Ron Paul.
[02:30:05.096 --> 02:30:13.824]  The most basic principle to being a free American is the notion that we as individuals are responsible for our own lives and decisions.
[02:30:13.824 --> 02:30:18.028]  We do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make up for our own mistakes.
[02:30:18.248 --> 02:30:24.472]  Neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how to live, so long as we aren't infringing on their rights.
[02:30:24.472 --> 02:30:29.035]  Freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones.
[02:30:29.035 --> 02:30:33.057]  If we are only free to make good decisions, then we are not really free.
[02:30:33.057 --> 02:30:40.142]  Liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints.
[02:30:40.342 --> 02:30:46.466]  Random searches, mandatory identification cards, and paramilitary police in our streets.
[02:30:46.466 --> 02:30:49.588]  We have lost a vital part of our American heritage.
[02:30:49.588 --> 02:30:54.210]  America was born of protests, revolution, and mistrust of government.
[02:30:54.210 --> 02:30:58.233]  Subservient societies neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long.
[02:31:00.089 --> 02:31:08.333]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[02:31:08.333 --> 02:31:09.554]  A 360 win.
[02:31:09.554 --> 02:31:16.117]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[02:31:16.117 --> 02:31:20.799]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip
[02:31:20.899 --> 02:31:24.040]  Because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:31:24.040 --> 02:31:29.121]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:31:29.121 --> 02:31:35.223]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:31:35.223 --> 02:31:43.006]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:31:43.006 --> 02:31:49.528]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:31:49.528 --> 02:31:50.508]  10% off on AutoShip.
[02:31:51.848 --> 02:32:05.293]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:05.293 --> 02:32:07.393]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:32:07.393 --> 02:32:12.675]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:32:12.675 --> 02:32:16.436]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[02:32:16.536 --> 02:32:19.979]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:32:19.979 --> 02:32:23.161]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:32:23.161 --> 02:32:27.045]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:32:27.045 --> 02:32:34.210]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:32:34.210 --> 02:32:39.595]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[02:32:39.755 --> 02:32:40.616]  We're good to go.
[02:33:08.599 --> 02:33:12.000]  Fortune favors the bold.
[02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.101]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:14.101 --> 02:33:20.824]  When I was young, I was the nicest guy I knew.
[02:33:20.824 --> 02:33:27.167]  I thought I was the chosen one.
[02:33:27.167 --> 02:33:33.690]  But time went by and I found out a thing or two.
[02:33:33.690 --> 02:33:36.571]  My shine wore off as time wore on.
[02:33:42.569 --> 02:33:45.011]  Here's a new article by Kit Daniels on InfoWars.com.
[02:33:45.011 --> 02:33:46.992]  Then we're going to write your calls.
[02:33:46.992 --> 02:33:50.575]  Deep state pushes coup against Trump over Comey firing.
[02:33:50.575 --> 02:33:56.819]  Foreign policy once again promotes COG rhetoric.
[02:33:56.819 --> 02:34:03.464]  And that is the deep state openly trying to remove Trump.
[02:34:03.464 --> 02:34:05.385]  Is America a failing state?
[02:34:05.385 --> 02:34:11.009]  Asks Politico, Foreign Policy, David Rothkopf.
[02:34:14.105 --> 02:34:17.766]  Rothkopf, former head of the Kissinger Group.
[02:34:17.766 --> 02:34:28.508]  Ultimately, and the sooner the better, it will require a system and its people to reject Trump and those surrounding him who have already done such a disgrace to the offices they hold to undermine America's standing in the world.
[02:34:28.508 --> 02:34:30.148]  He means selling America out for globalism.
[02:34:30.148 --> 02:34:36.910]  They are openly calling for the overthrow of our president who's clearly trying to turn our economy back on and standing up for our country.
[02:34:38.780 --> 02:34:40.081]  It's crazy.
[02:34:40.081 --> 02:34:42.543]  Alright, Beth, you've been a real trooper holding so long.
[02:34:42.543 --> 02:34:43.003]  Thank you.
[02:34:43.003 --> 02:34:45.025]  Go ahead.
[02:34:45.025 --> 02:34:48.188]  Hi, Alex.
[02:34:48.188 --> 02:34:58.356]  You know, I called last week and you sent me a few shirts because my sister and I are doing Operation Trigger and I just want to say thank you for those shirts.
[02:34:58.356 --> 02:34:59.317]  They've been amazing.
[02:34:59.317 --> 02:35:01.158]  I got the Hillary Joker shirt.
[02:35:01.158 --> 02:35:07.364]  I can't tell you, even Hillary supporters are laughing at the shirt saying, yeah, that really wasn't her best moment.
[02:35:08.547 --> 02:35:11.748]  You know, I want to thank you for those shirts.
[02:35:11.748 --> 02:35:13.289]  Thank you!
[02:35:13.289 --> 02:35:28.434]  The reason that I called was because, you know, I've done a little bit of research into trying to figure out why America has become so cronyized, why our government has become crony.
[02:35:28.434 --> 02:35:36.738]  We all know, you know, Marxism tells them, you know, you have to force into cronyism in order to collapse the government, but
[02:35:38.954 --> 02:35:50.925]  I truly believe that the reason we haven't cronyized is based off the fact that our government owns the majority of the patents that are in the United States.
[02:35:50.925 --> 02:36:05.818]  And the fact that people can't come from outside of the United States with processes that they're trying to get patented because the government owns something that could be associated
[02:36:06.659 --> 02:36:12.742]  With their idea, with their process, or with their product.
[02:36:12.742 --> 02:36:32.932]  And so, it's going to be really difficult for Trump to get these companies that have not sold out to the CIA, have not sold out to numerous agencies within the government, because they can't bring those patents that they need over to America in order to start those plants.
[02:36:33.826 --> 02:36:34.967]  So I'm with you.
[02:36:34.967 --> 02:36:36.747]  Trump needs to go on the offense.
[02:36:36.747 --> 02:36:39.288]  That's the most important thing right now.
[02:36:39.288 --> 02:36:44.931]  And he's already got them, you know, crippled at this point.
[02:36:44.931 --> 02:37:01.218]  And if he went in there and he started looking at the whole patent process and he started bringing in the small businesses and changing the process, changing the cost... Well, he's actually hinted at that, releasing the secret technologies, the life extension, the secrets of the universe.
[02:37:02.639 --> 02:37:05.842]  They talked about it in his inaugural address.
[02:37:05.842 --> 02:37:06.422]  That would happen.
[02:37:06.422 --> 02:37:07.463]  Great, great points, Pat.
[02:37:07.463 --> 02:37:09.125]  Thank you so much.
[02:37:09.125 --> 02:37:10.526]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:37:10.526 --> 02:37:13.148]  Let's go ahead and talk to Carlos in Canada.
[02:37:13.148 --> 02:37:15.471]  You're on the air, Carlos.
[02:37:15.471 --> 02:37:15.831]  Thank you.
[02:37:15.831 --> 02:37:16.852]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:37:16.852 --> 02:37:17.452]  Hey, buddy.
[02:37:17.452 --> 02:37:21.156]  Just wanted to mention, I did a little analysis on the
[02:37:21.798 --> 02:37:39.594]  Replacement of the director of the FBI yesterday in the sense that I was more concerned with the procedure that that President Trump would not be able to be criticized as being arbitrary as being dictatorial or irresponsible and Look at the clarity.
[02:37:39.594 --> 02:37:45.659]  We've had the letters written by Attorney General about the director and
[02:37:46.189 --> 02:37:53.791]  With references to consultations with experts and with people that were in positions before.
[02:37:53.791 --> 02:38:03.393]  Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, presented his findings and conclusions, his own and others, with evidence.
[02:38:03.393 --> 02:38:14.456]  And that was passed on to the Attorney General, who in a brief comment made, said, we must restore the reputation of the FBI, which is in tatters and maybe not redeemable.
[02:38:15.012 --> 02:38:23.900]  And with that, he then instructs the President his opinion that he should have the FBI Director removed.
[02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:35.150]  And on the basis of that, the President restores confidence to the process so that in future we may see how individuals in government are removed.
[02:38:35.150 --> 02:38:36.211]  This is clarity.
[02:38:38.172 --> 02:38:45.879]  A level of disclosure, which is solitary, and I think... That's right, normally when people get fired, they don't do any of this, they just fire them.
[02:38:45.879 --> 02:38:54.267]  Here's Trump laying it all out, that this guy's absolutely out of control, and that's the end of him.
[02:38:54.267 --> 02:38:55.007]  That's right.
[02:38:55.007 --> 02:39:03.375]  But if you compare it to FBI Director Edgar Hoover and President Kennedy, for instance, those were different days.
[02:39:04.116 --> 02:39:15.170]  I mean, today, the information gathering is in the hands of people like, you know, other than the director of the FBI.
[02:39:15.170 --> 02:39:22.940]  So you have Brennan making all sorts of threats to the president, thinking that because they have access to this information, now the new Edgar Hoovers.
[02:39:23.470 --> 02:39:28.233]  And so it shows you that President Trump is responsible.
[02:39:28.233 --> 02:39:31.555]  It restores confidence in the dismissal process.
[02:39:31.555 --> 02:39:32.536]  It's not arbitrary.
[02:39:32.536 --> 02:39:39.200]  And I don't really think they will go very far in trying to accuse him of being arbitrary.
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:45.885]  I mean, the Democrats are all saying he should be removed from office or impeached right now, but they were calling for Comey to be removed just a week ago.
[02:39:45.885 --> 02:39:50.468]  So I don't see how Hillary then says, oh, it's horrible this happened, when a week ago she was blaming Comey for her loss.
[02:39:52.324 --> 02:39:53.345]  He will not go very far.
[02:39:53.345 --> 02:39:54.427]  May I make another point?
[02:39:54.427 --> 02:39:56.650]  Sure, whatever.
[02:39:56.650 --> 02:39:57.571]  Thank you very much.
[02:39:57.571 --> 02:40:00.034]  Well, it concerns you.
[02:40:00.034 --> 02:40:02.577]  You're a good leader, obviously.
[02:40:02.577 --> 02:40:03.759]  You're a noble person.
[02:40:04.255 --> 02:40:22.164]  And when people like Steve Colbert or Bill Maher attack you, they know very well that when they skunk you, that you're going to defend yourself by saying, I'm not this and I'm not that and whatever.
[02:40:22.164 --> 02:40:23.605]  But you don't go on the attack.
[02:40:23.605 --> 02:40:26.466]  You don't double down on them and attack them.
[02:40:26.466 --> 02:40:28.848]  And it's really a very
[02:40:30.327 --> 02:40:41.930]  Sad thing because these individuals in their own careers, they need to understand that they are role models for others.
[02:40:41.930 --> 02:40:44.731]  And they don't understand and they're irresponsible and stupid.
[02:40:44.731 --> 02:40:48.972]  Because let me tell you, if President Trump walked into Bill Maher's studio,
[02:40:49.411 --> 02:40:49.591]  I think?
[02:41:06.344 --> 02:41:12.948]  Colbert speaks for himself more than anything else because he would do that for anybody in his profession in Hollywood.
[02:41:12.948 --> 02:41:18.532]  You know, we've all heard stories of people, you know, addressing their powers above them.
[02:41:18.532 --> 02:41:24.955]  And many of these movie stars and people like that who make these statements to the public, they are role models.
[02:41:24.955 --> 02:41:32.260]  But they are abused because they are really the white slaves of the Hollywood moguls who say, do this or you'll never work here again.
[02:41:33.426 --> 02:41:33.967]  It's horrible.
[02:41:33.967 --> 02:41:35.088]  Hollywood is so controlled.
[02:41:35.088 --> 02:41:36.790]  Most people are libertarians in Hollywood.
[02:41:36.790 --> 02:41:39.012]  Only Kurt Russell would speak out about it.
[02:41:39.012 --> 02:41:39.612]  They're not liberals.
[02:41:39.612 --> 02:41:40.393]  They're not conservatives.
[02:41:40.393 --> 02:41:41.414]  They just love America.
[02:41:41.414 --> 02:41:43.256]  They don't want to be told what to do anymore.
[02:41:43.256 --> 02:41:45.098]  They don't want to play roles that put the country down.
[02:41:45.098 --> 02:41:51.765]  And I just wish that the Bruce Willis's and the Kurt Russell's would say more and do more.
[02:41:51.765 --> 02:41:55.628]  Because it's funny, like anybody I ever liked in Hollywood, like a
[02:41:58.422 --> 02:42:06.265]  I mean, you know, the big Hollywood producer and director and the biggest Hollywood star of all time.
[02:42:06.265 --> 02:42:10.627]  It was Rowdy Yates way back in the time of Rawhide and just right through all the other films.
[02:42:10.627 --> 02:42:12.528]  Clint Eastwood, he's a patriot.
[02:42:12.528 --> 02:42:13.268]  He's a good guy.
[02:42:13.268 --> 02:42:14.649]  He cares.
[02:42:14.649 --> 02:42:18.610]  He was in the Korean War, survived a big plane crash coming back over the Pacific Ocean.
[02:42:18.610 --> 02:42:21.912]  There hasn't been a movie made about that out there for two days with sharks trying to eat him.
[02:42:21.912 --> 02:42:23.132]  Just a really interesting fella.
[02:42:23.132 --> 02:42:23.812]  He's a good guy.
[02:42:23.812 --> 02:42:25.053]  It's like whoever we resonate with.
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:30.282]  We see the reality behind even the act of the real person.
[02:42:30.282 --> 02:42:32.224]  And then all the other people are just a bunch of followers.
[02:42:32.224 --> 02:42:32.964]  It's very, very sad.
[02:42:32.964 --> 02:42:33.684]  I appreciate your call.
[02:42:33.684 --> 02:42:35.626]  God bless you, Carlos.
[02:42:35.626 --> 02:42:44.311]  Since you mentioned, and then I'll go to Tracy and Mitchell and Jeff and Dean, 800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[02:42:44.311 --> 02:42:50.494]  Let me just cover this, not because it's about me, but because it illustrates the deception of the medium.
[02:42:50.494 --> 02:42:52.876]  Media Matters, funded by George Soros, David Brock.
[02:42:54.413 --> 02:42:56.556]  Attack me for something I did, I guess, on Monday.
[02:42:56.556 --> 02:43:03.905]  Alex Jones mocks Jimmy Kimmel over his son's heart defect.
[02:43:03.905 --> 02:43:06.888]  Now, I didn't mock him.
[02:43:06.888 --> 02:43:08.150]  And even read what I said.
[02:43:11.007 --> 02:43:15.489]  And I just went on to say that heart defects are up because of the vaccines, the chemicals.
[02:43:15.489 --> 02:43:30.274]  If you have a cesarean, they don't tell you that a lot of times the baby's early, that the heart doesn't start pumping blood until the baby's out of the body, out of the mother, and that has heart murmurs and problems at first that generally children grow out of it.
[02:43:30.274 --> 02:43:37.237]  A lot of hospitals will say have heart surgery on your preemie, not telling you the heart's going to grow into the blood, grow into the flow.
[02:43:39.315 --> 02:43:41.717]  And I got four children, I know about this.
[02:43:41.717 --> 02:43:48.083]  And so I said, oh, he just says, you know, we need to have socialist health care because, you know, kids need to be covered.
[02:43:48.083 --> 02:43:50.585]  We got some of the best health care in the world.
[02:43:50.585 --> 02:43:53.667]  And under Obamacare, it actually destroys all that.
[02:43:53.667 --> 02:43:55.869]  And Venezuela has horrible health care.
[02:43:55.869 --> 02:44:02.355]  I was saying, look at how Jimmy Kimmel uses his child's heart defect to then tell us we should accept Obamacare.
[02:44:02.355 --> 02:44:03.456]  That's a giant screw job.
[02:44:04.369 --> 02:44:05.650]  It wasn't about his child.
[02:44:05.650 --> 02:44:09.352]  It wasn't me putting down his child having a heart defect.
[02:44:09.352 --> 02:44:14.234]  Why in the world would I say something like that?
[02:44:14.234 --> 02:44:20.618]  But you read what I said or you watch the video, I didn't mock him.
[02:44:20.618 --> 02:44:32.705]  But they have that headline that I would mock a baby's heart defect when I personally have dealt with that.
[02:44:33.450 --> 02:44:39.091]  It makes me want to throw up.
[02:44:39.091 --> 02:44:41.391]  But that's who these sick freaks are.
[02:44:41.391 --> 02:44:42.292]  Oh, look at Jimmy Kimmel.
[02:44:42.292 --> 02:44:43.612]  He has a child heart defects.
[02:44:43.612 --> 02:44:46.752]  It isn't that they had the child earlier had a cesarean.
[02:44:46.752 --> 02:44:48.333]  They won't even tell them that.
[02:44:48.333 --> 02:44:49.073]  Tell them that.
[02:44:49.073 --> 02:44:50.773]  See, the medical system.
[02:44:50.773 --> 02:44:56.794]  That the cause of heart problems, obviously, and I go on in the whole analysis, I wasn't mocking him.
[02:44:56.794 --> 02:45:02.195]  I was using this case to say, let's not just feel bad for his child, who we hope gets better.
[02:45:05.014 --> 02:45:07.856]  Let's actually sit there and look at what's really going on.
[02:45:07.856 --> 02:45:10.557]  It's like, oh, give money to breast cancer research.
[02:45:10.557 --> 02:45:11.558]  Find a cure.
[02:45:11.558 --> 02:45:16.461]  Why not find out why, depending on the type of breast cancer, they're up 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 10,000, 12,000 percent.
[02:45:16.461 --> 02:45:20.803]  There's a bunch of different breast cancers.
[02:45:20.803 --> 02:45:22.424]  They're all just skyrocketing.
[02:45:22.424 --> 02:45:25.706]  Brazil didn't have any breast cancer to speak of until 20 years ago.
[02:45:25.706 --> 02:45:28.187]  Glyphosate started getting used.
[02:45:28.187 --> 02:45:29.248]  It's as high as the United States.
[02:45:31.866 --> 02:45:34.327]  I mean, Roundup doesn't just kill weeds, folks.
[02:45:34.327 --> 02:45:35.608]  It grows breast cancer.
[02:45:35.608 --> 02:45:38.749]  That's an admitted fact.
[02:45:38.749 --> 02:45:45.211]  They call it estrogen-based cancers.
[02:45:45.211 --> 02:45:55.856]  So, I don't want people like my grandmother, who had one breast removed and then for six years refused to have surgery on her other breast, and she pretty much died of cancer, wouldn't see the doctor anymore.
[02:45:55.856 --> 02:45:58.537]  That's her business at 92 years old a few months ago.
[02:46:01.516 --> 02:46:03.338]  Big Christian wouldn't commit suicide.
[02:46:03.338 --> 02:46:06.440]  I admire her for that, but I probably wouldn't have.
[02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:13.886]  Sitting there with cancer for six years, all over her body, just said, I'm done.
[02:46:13.886 --> 02:46:18.410]  It was so unfun to have one of her breasts removed.
[02:46:18.410 --> 02:46:19.911]  At 87 or whatever it was, 80, 86.
[02:46:24.465 --> 02:46:28.587]  And then they just turn it into, I don't care about people with cancer, I don't care about Jimmy Kimmel's kid.
[02:46:28.587 --> 02:46:29.868]  Well, what the hell are you talking about?
[02:46:29.868 --> 02:46:32.550]  I care about kids, so I don't want to abort them all!
[02:46:32.550 --> 02:46:37.993]  While you shoot your mouths off, let's just kill the babies, get the highways rolling, kill more people, kill old people.
[02:46:37.993 --> 02:46:39.874]  I'm Bill Maher, I'm a selfish dirtbag!
[02:46:39.874 --> 02:46:47.818]  I mean, I've been told by people that know Jimmy Kimmel, like, I care.
[02:46:47.818 --> 02:46:48.639]  He talks about me all the time.
[02:46:49.773 --> 02:46:54.295]  I don't need to be recognized by some Hollywood guy that Kimmel is a listener to the show, back to the man show.
[02:46:54.295 --> 02:46:56.116]  Thinks we're funny, likes a lot of it.
[02:46:56.116 --> 02:47:02.459]  And he does his little jokes about, oh, Alex, you had to talk about the pickles and all that.
[02:47:02.459 --> 02:47:08.782]  I talked about him using his child's problem to push Obamacare that cuts the quality of care.
[02:47:08.782 --> 02:47:14.024]  And then I said, why don't you actually find out why the kids are having record heart defects?
[02:47:14.024 --> 02:47:18.546]  Because the heart's an amazing engine.
[02:47:20.031 --> 02:47:21.673]  You can have a little bit of brain deforming.
[02:47:21.673 --> 02:47:22.594]  Maybe it's a little bit weird.
[02:47:22.594 --> 02:47:23.254]  Maybe you're wacky.
[02:47:23.254 --> 02:47:25.957]  Maybe you're even smarter because of it.
[02:47:25.957 --> 02:47:26.757]  That's a computer.
[02:47:26.757 --> 02:47:29.921]  That heart is an incredible engine that works for like a hundred years.
[02:47:29.921 --> 02:47:32.243]  And if there's any problems in it, you got big problems.
[02:47:37.915 --> 02:47:40.798]  And so they transmute the truth into a lie.
[02:47:40.798 --> 02:47:42.480]  And you read what I said.
[02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:44.742]  Oh, look at Jimmy Kimmel.
[02:47:44.742 --> 02:47:46.364]  His child has heart defects.
[02:47:46.364 --> 02:47:49.847]  It isn't that they had the child earlier, had a cesarean.
[02:47:49.847 --> 02:47:51.068]  They won't even tell them that.
[02:47:51.068 --> 02:47:51.809]  I'm at the hospital.
[02:47:51.809 --> 02:47:54.332]  That that causes heart problems, obviously.
[02:47:54.332 --> 02:47:55.333]  No, no, no.
[02:47:55.333 --> 02:47:59.717]  We're not going to tell you it's all the vaccines you took or the chemicals you ingested.
[02:48:00.518 --> 02:48:04.742]  We're not going to discuss the vaccines they just gave your child.
[02:48:04.742 --> 02:48:08.505]  Yeah, that's what's really killing the kids and making them have brain disorders and heart attacks.
[02:48:08.505 --> 02:48:12.788]  Let's just say give us free health care or our babies will die.
[02:48:12.788 --> 02:48:14.970]  Don't our babies deserve it?
[02:48:14.970 --> 02:48:18.753]  When you have state-run health care, you have medical tyranny.
[02:48:18.753 --> 02:48:22.817]  When you have everyone bound under one system, they can tax you and control you.
[02:48:23.237 --> 02:48:27.420]  And do whatever they want, once there's no competition and choice.
[02:48:27.420 --> 02:48:32.224]  But it doesn't matter for the pseudo-intellectuals of Jimmy Kimmel.
[02:48:32.224 --> 02:48:34.586]  That's the ones that write the stuff for him.
[02:48:34.586 --> 02:48:39.169]  See, the pseudo-intellectuals of Jimmy Kimmel, he's just a breeder.
[02:48:39.169 --> 02:48:43.793]  He can just get up there and say, we need national health care for my baby.
[02:48:43.793 --> 02:48:44.974]  It's for the children.
[02:48:44.974 --> 02:48:48.897]  It sounds so much easier.
[02:48:48.897 --> 02:48:50.018]  Where'd I mock Jimmy Kimmel?
[02:48:51.448 --> 02:48:58.432]  You think I'm gonna mock a baby with a heart defect?
[02:48:58.432 --> 02:49:04.316]  But see, they're the ones that mock all this.
[02:49:04.316 --> 02:49:07.477]  Most of the writers for Jimmy Kimmel don't have kids.
[02:49:07.477 --> 02:49:09.218]  Most of them are drug addicts.
[02:49:09.218 --> 02:49:12.100]  They're hired because they're mentally ill.
[02:49:12.100 --> 02:49:15.562]  And they're hired because they'll do whatever they're told.
[02:49:15.562 --> 02:49:16.183]  They have nothing.
[02:49:16.183 --> 02:49:16.703]  They have no soul.
[02:49:20.563 --> 02:49:24.385]  And then they need to tell the world I have no soul.
[02:49:24.385 --> 02:49:27.166]  Because they fear people that do have a soul.
[02:49:27.166 --> 02:49:30.767]  And a connection to God.
[02:49:30.767 --> 02:49:31.948]  That's just an example of their deception.
[02:49:31.948 --> 02:49:32.648]  We're going to go to break.
[02:49:32.648 --> 02:49:33.829]  Come back.
[02:49:33.829 --> 02:49:38.171]  Go to Jeff and Michael's first.
[02:49:38.171 --> 02:49:38.831]  Is that Michelle?
[02:49:38.831 --> 02:49:41.092]  I can't read it so far away.
[02:49:41.092 --> 02:49:43.213]  But hopefully this attack
[02:49:45.842 --> 02:49:52.448]  On the corrupt government, the removal of Comey, the arrogant deep state, the arrogant bureaucracy is a very, very positive move.
[02:49:52.448 --> 02:50:01.656]  I hope to see more of this from Trump because we're already in a war, like Patrick Henry said.
[02:50:01.656 --> 02:50:07.000]  I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:08.742]  The war has already begun.
[02:50:08.742 --> 02:50:11.504]  Why do we sit here idle?
[02:50:11.504 --> 02:50:12.665]  We didn't ask for this fight, but
[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:32.186]  You know, you might be a little scared before a fight starts, but once the fist starts swinging, and once somebody connects with your head, you know, that feeling, then it's fun, isn't it?
[02:50:34.048 --> 02:50:39.953]  We're dealing with a bunch of cowards that play in a man's world and pretend like they've got the power.
[02:50:39.953 --> 02:50:48.101]  But as long as we realize that this world's only a test and what we do measures ourselves in God's eyes, then nothing else matters.
[02:50:48.101 --> 02:50:50.082]  Who cares about being ridiculed by the globalists?
[02:50:50.082 --> 02:50:52.465]  Who cares about their system attacking us?
[02:50:52.465 --> 02:50:54.887]  That's the badge of honor.
[02:50:54.887 --> 02:50:56.068]  We'll be back with your phone calls.
[02:50:56.068 --> 02:50:56.788]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:56.788 --> 02:50:57.809]  Infowars.com.

[02:51:22.743 --> 02:51:27.248]  ProFlowers has everything you need to get your Mother's Day shopping done for all the moms you know.

[02:51:30.532 --> 02:51:30.832]  I think so.
[02:51:59.344 --> 02:52:04.727]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:52:04.727 --> 02:52:07.569]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:52:07.569 --> 02:52:09.550]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:52:09.550 --> 02:52:14.552]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:52:14.552 --> 02:52:16.634]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:52:16.634 --> 02:52:17.914]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:52:17.914 --> 02:52:22.997]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:52:22.997 --> 02:52:26.339]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns.
[02:52:26.499 --> 02:52:29.840]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:32.741]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:52:32.741 --> 02:52:36.522]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:52:36.522 --> 02:52:43.385]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:52:43.385 --> 02:52:50.867]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.
[02:52:50.867 --> 02:52:53.788]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste.

[02:52:59.210 --> 02:53:01.151]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:53:01.151 --> 02:53:06.474]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:53:06.474 --> 02:53:08.054]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:53:08.054 --> 02:53:16.418]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:53:16.418 --> 02:53:22.101]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:53:22.281 --> 02:53:24.102]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:53:24.102 --> 02:53:26.243]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:53:26.243 --> 02:53:30.764]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:53:30.764 --> 02:53:32.945]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:53:32.945 --> 02:53:40.808]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:53:48.275 --> 02:53:51.258]  As we've been driving on the wine's breast, much too long.
[02:54:07.474 --> 02:54:24.464]  The Babylon system is the vampire sucking the children's blood.
[02:54:24.464 --> 02:54:32.669]  And anybody that sells you that we should organize ourselves by race is a liar.
[02:54:32.669 --> 02:54:35.311]  Because we are the human race.
[02:54:36.761 --> 02:54:41.065]  And it was the Christians that began to end slavery and empower women.
[02:54:41.065 --> 02:54:46.430]  And they know we have the guilt on our conscience that we wanted to stop it.
[02:54:46.430 --> 02:54:50.113]  So the people that are still for it tell us, look what you've done!
[02:54:50.113 --> 02:54:52.435]  And they know we'll get in line because we want to be good.
[02:54:52.435 --> 02:54:55.298]  That's why they say the devil's the accuser.
[02:54:58.317 --> 02:55:04.779]  And we have great sins in the West, but our sins are way less than those of many other groups.
[02:55:04.779 --> 02:55:15.483]  And it's time to throw off the guilt, know we're forgiven, and move forward to empower humanity.
[02:55:15.483 --> 02:55:19.425]  Because you hear all this garbage by the media, it's meant to make us all fight with each other.
[02:55:19.425 --> 02:55:23.286]  I don't care if you're white, Hispanic, black, most people are mixed, it doesn't even matter.
[02:55:23.286 --> 02:55:25.147]  I'm a little bit Native American, what does it even matter?
[02:55:26.755 --> 02:55:32.958]  The point is, we want a future for ourselves and our children.
[02:55:32.958 --> 02:55:36.800]  Not a future based on screwing each other over.
[02:55:36.800 --> 02:55:39.681]  The resources are unlimited.
[02:55:39.681 --> 02:55:46.705]  The globalists are seeking to shut down resources because they want a consolidated control arm.
[02:55:46.705 --> 02:55:49.106]  They're selfish!
[02:55:49.106 --> 02:55:51.607]  A sociopath thinks you're a wimp if you care about people.
[02:55:55.168 --> 02:55:56.749]  They're cripples.
[02:55:56.749 --> 02:56:04.453]  Psychopaths and sociopaths are cripples.
[02:56:04.453 --> 02:56:15.739]  Having feelings carried opens you up to the whole universe.
[02:56:15.739 --> 02:56:21.242]  These stupid devil worshippers think they are the only ones that have a corner on evil as if good people don't.
[02:56:24.096 --> 02:56:28.837]  And the whole history of that, and don't have access to all of it.
[02:56:28.837 --> 02:56:39.999]  You fools, you people that seek after evil, have no idea that if you were a good person, you'd have all that knowledge and more, but would have the transcendence above it.
[02:56:39.999 --> 02:56:45.280]  And I think about the horrible things being done to the innocents all over this planet.
[02:56:45.280 --> 02:56:50.421]  And the selfish people that believe they're going to transcend if they greedily steal the human
[02:56:51.610 --> 02:56:55.531]  Destiny for themselves is ridiculous.
[02:56:55.531 --> 02:57:01.494]  As if you would ever transcend this world when you did it on the backs of other people.
[02:57:01.494 --> 02:57:03.914]  It will never happen.
[02:57:03.914 --> 02:57:12.317]  But they distort that and say that good people should then roll over to evil because we're not going to be dominant, we're not going to be aggressive.
[02:57:12.317 --> 02:57:15.498]  That's all a lie.
[02:57:15.498 --> 02:57:19.620]  Vengeance is mine, says the Lord, but God acts through us for vengeance.
[02:57:23.496 --> 02:57:30.638]  Make no mistake, we are the instruments of evil's destruction.
[02:57:30.638 --> 02:57:35.860]  But it's not in some arrogant spirit that we're the instruments to be thrown against the enemy.
[02:57:35.860 --> 02:57:42.061]  We understand that we are defiled and fallen.
[02:57:42.061 --> 02:57:47.683]  And only in the great animating contest of liberty are we then purified through the fire.
[02:57:49.167 --> 02:58:00.109]  And those that seek to hide from the fire, those that seek to not have the challenge, those that seek not to enter that, are the true cowards of the world.
[02:58:00.109 --> 02:58:03.090]  And they seek temporal power.
[02:58:03.090 --> 02:58:12.411]  Temporal power in this body, on this planet, and it's all a fool's errand.
[02:58:12.411 --> 02:58:15.492]  I'm gonna go to break, take a few calls, and I promise I'm going to your phone calls.
[02:58:16.343 --> 02:58:19.125]  And then we've got Mike Cernovich coming up at 8 after.
[02:58:19.125 --> 02:58:19.625]  Straight ahead.
[02:58:19.625 --> 02:58:21.226]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:21.226 --> 02:58:22.006]  Forward slash show.
[02:58:22.006 --> 02:58:30.952]  The enemy has its full pathetic weight leaning up against us, trying to destroy the idea of human empowerment.
[02:58:30.952 --> 02:58:34.074]  But that's only the gravity that builds our muscles.
[02:58:34.074 --> 02:58:37.756]  If we take victory in our hands, it's ours by birth.
[02:58:37.756 --> 02:58:40.378]  We'll be back with a fourth hour.
[02:58:40.378 --> 02:58:42.039]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:43.771 --> 02:58:50.156]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.156 --> 02:58:57.642]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:58:57.642 --> 02:59:10.852]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[02:59:23.677 --> 02:59:29.639]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[02:59:39.408 --> 02:59:52.500]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[02:59:52.500 --> 02:59:55.123]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.761 --> 03:00:17.303]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[03:00:17.303 --> 03:00:23.284]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:23.284 --> 03:00:31.647]  Ships, countries, worlds, they're all called she.
[03:00:31.647 --> 03:00:40.169]  And then the globalists tell you that humanity wants to pull down women, when their whole mission is to pull down women, and then kill the species forever.
[03:00:44.172 --> 03:00:46.073]  All right, let's go to Michael in Texas.
[03:00:46.073 --> 03:00:48.575]  Thanks for holding it on the air.
[03:00:48.575 --> 03:00:49.295]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:00:49.295 --> 03:00:51.016]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:00:51.016 --> 03:00:55.839]  So your studio guy said to me that I could get like a free T-shirt for holding on so long.
[03:00:55.839 --> 03:01:05.506]  And I said, well, you know, since I have so many and multiples and I wear them all the time and I help you fund your operation by the tune of about $2,500 a year.
[03:01:05.506 --> 03:01:07.147]  Thank you.
[03:01:07.147 --> 03:01:08.528]  I'd like to trade it in.
[03:01:08.528 --> 03:01:09.568]  You're welcome, Alex.
[03:01:09.568 --> 03:01:13.671]  I'd like to trade that in for 30 seconds and it won't cost you a dime.
[03:01:14.987 --> 03:01:21.794]  And so with that being said, you know, you're always talking about you want to expand and you're looking for new talent.
[03:01:21.794 --> 03:01:26.079]  And Rob Dew was on last week and he went into a whole thing about it.
[03:01:26.079 --> 03:01:30.183]  And I thought he mentioned an email address to send a resume.
[03:01:30.183 --> 03:01:32.105]  And well, maybe I got it wrong.
[03:01:32.105 --> 03:01:36.470]  My resume is me and what I've done on the Internet and what I'm currently doing.
[03:01:37.248 --> 03:01:41.371]  Alex, my proposal to you is this, and I don't want you to pay me.
[03:01:41.371 --> 03:01:50.877]  I just want a shot, remotely, like you give Rapaport and Stone and those guys from their home, and you decide how long and when and wherever.
[03:01:50.877 --> 03:01:56.180]  I am fully committed to fighting the New World Order, Alex.
[03:01:56.180 --> 03:02:00.262]  I've got the fire, I've got the heart, and I've got the guts.
[03:02:00.262 --> 03:02:05.926]  And if you would just listen to the podcast I'm doing now, you would realize that
[03:02:07.063 --> 03:02:08.164]  We're on the same page.
[03:02:08.164 --> 03:02:11.006]  Well, tell us your podcast.
[03:02:11.006 --> 03:02:13.388]  It's called The Truth Zone.
[03:02:13.388 --> 03:02:15.870]  And it's on Spreaker.
[03:02:15.870 --> 03:02:20.673]  And if you listen, I did a thing on Comey and the French election.
[03:02:20.673 --> 03:02:25.597]  And Alex, if you would just listen to it, you would know that I'm not your sickle fan.
[03:02:25.597 --> 03:02:30.861]  I'm an independent man that's wide awake, thanks to you and other outlets.
[03:02:30.861 --> 03:02:32.942]  I just need my shot, Alex.
[03:02:32.942 --> 03:02:34.824]  I just need my shot.
[03:02:34.824 --> 03:02:35.985]  I need the exposure.
[03:02:36.869 --> 03:02:38.851]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[03:02:38.851 --> 03:02:45.797]  I want to launch six hours more of radio TV than like 10 hours, 20 hours.
[03:02:45.797 --> 03:02:48.639]  And we could have weekly or maybe every day.
[03:02:48.639 --> 03:02:50.861]  It's got to set the slot up and make sure you don't get infiltrated.
[03:02:50.861 --> 03:02:53.783]  Now some guy that gets on to try to eat your suit or whatever.
[03:02:53.783 --> 03:03:00.149]  But we should have like a guest slot of guest hosts and then have people come on and guess and see how people like it and see how it goes.
[03:03:00.149 --> 03:03:01.810]  I'm totally all about that.
[03:03:01.810 --> 03:03:02.371]  Absolutely.
[03:03:02.371 --> 03:03:04.212]  I mean, that's why you have jobs at Infowars.com.
[03:03:05.555 --> 03:03:08.436]  We don't have a lot of money to hire new people, but we need to hire some more reporters.
[03:03:08.436 --> 03:03:10.217]  We need to, you know, expand what we're doing.
[03:03:10.217 --> 03:03:11.398]  We're really trying to do that right now.
[03:03:11.398 --> 03:03:13.799]  So that's a great point.
[03:03:13.799 --> 03:03:15.960]  Well, you don't even have to pay me, Alex.
[03:03:15.960 --> 03:03:17.581]  I just want my shot.
[03:03:17.581 --> 03:03:24.645]  And you'll see, you'll see that I deserve and you'll want me to be a permanent member of the InfoWars team.
[03:03:24.645 --> 03:03:25.505]  Well, I believe it, brother.
[03:03:25.505 --> 03:03:28.667]  I just, the infrastructure here, I'm trying as hard as I can.
[03:03:30.216 --> 03:03:31.737]  We built this infrastructure.
[03:03:31.737 --> 03:03:33.478]  I want to get more people on air.
[03:03:33.478 --> 03:03:34.158]  So we're trying.
[03:03:34.158 --> 03:03:34.598]  God bless you.
[03:03:34.598 --> 03:03:35.538]  I appreciate your call, Michael.
[03:03:35.538 --> 03:03:37.339]  We'll see what happens.
[03:03:37.339 --> 03:03:40.641]  Jeff in North Carolina, go ahead.
[03:03:40.641 --> 03:03:42.181]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[03:03:42.181 --> 03:03:43.342]  Appreciate you taking the call.
[03:03:43.342 --> 03:03:55.968]  I was just calling in regards to your conversation yesterday with Mark Dice and where you guys were going with things and trying to get a mind wrap around how people are becoming so deceitful, right?
[03:03:57.478 --> 03:04:09.722]  And, you know, just what glares out at me is Romans Chapter 1, and it says that they will worship the creation, the earth, planet, animals, ourselves, instead of the Creator.
[03:04:09.722 --> 03:04:15.023]  So in the last days, He will give them up to minds of depravity.
[03:04:15.023 --> 03:04:25.306]  And what we're witnessing right now is the fulfillment of Romans Chapter 1, as God removes His restraining hand of common grace upon humanity, and He's giving them what they're asking for.
[03:04:27.076 --> 03:04:30.678]  That's right, God always gives you your free will, doesn't he?
[03:04:30.678 --> 03:04:34.759]  Yeah, and Romans chapter 1 says that they will do what is unnatural, right?
[03:04:34.759 --> 03:04:38.381]  Man will lie with man, woman with woman, right?
[03:04:38.381 --> 03:04:50.306]  And what we're seeing here in the aggregate, in the whole, is we're witnessing since Satan got kicked out of heaven for wanting to assume Yahweh's throne, we're seeing this world and Satan's
[03:04:52.296 --> 03:04:56.281]  Is Magnus... Magnus Opus, he is recreating the world in his image.
[03:04:56.281 --> 03:04:57.282]  That's right!
[03:04:57.282 --> 03:04:58.304]  Great points.
[03:04:58.304 --> 03:04:59.125]  Max Arnabus for the head.
[03:05:01.207 --> 03:05:15.116]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[03:05:15.116 --> 03:05:19.399]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[03:05:19.399 --> 03:05:21.961]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[03:05:21.961 --> 03:05:24.122]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[03:05:24.122 --> 03:05:30.807]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[03:05:31.287 --> 03:05:36.008]  What kind of leverage do these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[03:05:36.008 --> 03:05:40.330]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[03:05:40.330 --> 03:05:42.810]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[03:05:42.810 --> 03:05:47.812]  Adams also said, liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[03:05:47.812 --> 03:05:49.152]  Join the InfoWars.
[03:05:49.152 --> 03:05:50.452]  Spread the information.
[03:05:50.452 --> 03:05:52.373]  Educate yourself and others.
[03:05:52.373 --> 03:05:54.113]  The truth shall set you free.
[03:05:54.113 --> 03:05:56.014]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:05:59.716 --> 03:06:05.117]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:06:05.117 --> 03:06:07.978]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[03:06:07.978 --> 03:06:09.959]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[03:06:09.959 --> 03:06:14.980]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[03:06:14.980 --> 03:06:17.060]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:06:17.060 --> 03:06:18.361]  In fact, it's certified.
[03:06:18.361 --> 03:06:23.482]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:06:23.482 --> 03:06:26.823]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[03:06:28.424 --> 03:06:33.328]  Superblue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:06:33.328 --> 03:06:37.031]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:06:37.031 --> 03:06:43.957]  Superblue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:06:43.957 --> 03:06:51.463]  Just some of the ingredients in Superblue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.
[03:06:51.463 --> 03:06:54.345]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Superblue toothpaste.
[03:06:54.585 --> 03:06:55.145]  We're good to go.
[03:07:14.241 --> 03:07:18.783]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[03:07:18.783 --> 03:07:23.926]  But BioTrue Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[03:07:23.926 --> 03:07:27.408]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[03:07:27.408 --> 03:07:31.430]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[03:07:31.550 --> 03:07:39.637]  BioTruth Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield X2 Basin Iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[03:07:39.637 --> 03:07:44.541]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTruth Selenium before we sell it again.
[03:07:44.541 --> 03:07:53.068]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalists.
[03:07:53.068 --> 03:07:53.628]  A 360 win.
[03:07:53.628 --> 03:07:55.690]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[03:07:55.690 --> 03:07:57.191]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[03:07:57.191 --> 03:07:58.352]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:08:07.455 --> 03:08:09.097]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:08:09.097 --> 03:08:29.393]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:29.393 --> 03:08:30.074]  And we're back.
[03:08:30.074 --> 03:08:33.417]  Mike Cernich just hosting on The Real Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:33.417 --> 03:08:34.558]  He's gonna do it Friday.
[03:08:35.490 --> 03:08:38.691]  I believe Roger Stone is going to be going on on Friday.
[03:08:38.691 --> 03:08:40.831]  We have a lot of stories to talk about.
[03:08:40.831 --> 03:08:44.252]  The great production team has them all queued up.
[03:08:44.252 --> 03:08:51.613]  One thing that I think was really interesting, which happened yesterday, is what did we not know?
[03:08:51.613 --> 03:08:54.834]  When the Comey firing happened, nobody knew.
[03:08:54.834 --> 03:08:56.634]  Nobody had that leak.
[03:08:56.634 --> 03:08:58.875]  Actually, I didn't even have that leak.
[03:08:58.875 --> 03:09:04.936]  And Chuck Johnson, who has done some great journalism over the years, had a story up at GotNews.com about that.
[03:09:05.996 --> 03:09:10.497]  So there was a deliberate strategy with the Comey leak.
[03:09:10.497 --> 03:09:13.778]  Trump wanted to find out who is doing this leaking.
[03:09:13.778 --> 03:09:16.438]  Who's leaking all this information to the media?
[03:09:16.438 --> 03:09:19.979]  Who are leaking these stories to the media?
[03:09:19.979 --> 03:09:28.121]  And it turns out it was Reince Priebus, Sean Spicer's team, David Loftman at DOJ has been leaking.
[03:09:28.121 --> 03:09:29.641]  So now we know.
[03:09:29.641 --> 03:09:30.721]  Now we know who's leaking.
[03:09:30.721 --> 03:09:33.562]  So that was a very good development, but I thought it was interesting
[03:09:34.707 --> 03:09:36.667]  That nobody had the Comey leak.
[03:09:36.667 --> 03:09:38.328]  Came from out of nowhere.
[03:09:38.328 --> 03:09:44.409]  What's also interesting is my sources are telling me the White House, they're freaking out today.
[03:09:44.409 --> 03:09:45.609]  They're freaking out last night.
[03:09:45.609 --> 03:09:51.050]  So if you want to tweet it at real Donald Trump, let him know he made the right decision.
[03:09:51.050 --> 03:09:57.271]  So people within the White House are freaking out because they're saying, oh my God, Trump never told us he was going to fire Comey.
[03:09:57.271 --> 03:09:57.971]  Can't believe it.
[03:09:57.971 --> 03:09:58.411]  Oh my God.
[03:09:58.411 --> 03:09:58.751]  We don't know.
[03:09:58.751 --> 03:09:59.571]  We don't have a response.
[03:09:59.571 --> 03:10:01.672]  Well, that's because people are leaking.
[03:10:01.672 --> 03:10:02.752]  Quit leaking information.
[03:10:03.826 --> 03:10:05.887]  So Trump made the right decision.
[03:10:05.887 --> 03:10:08.248]  Definitely show him your support on Twitter.
[03:10:08.248 --> 03:10:12.349]  Let him know that the way that that was handled was brilliant.
[03:10:12.349 --> 03:10:13.530]  The leak never got out.
[03:10:13.530 --> 03:10:15.911]  In fact, this was funny.
[03:10:15.911 --> 03:10:17.031]  This was funny.
[03:10:17.031 --> 03:10:20.492]  Comey was at giving a talk in Los Angeles.
[03:10:20.492 --> 03:10:27.895]  And as he was watching the TV in the background, it showed James Comey, director Comey had been fired.
[03:10:27.895 --> 03:10:30.316]  And he said, funny joke.
[03:10:30.316 --> 03:10:31.257]  This is hilarious.
[03:10:31.257 --> 03:10:32.157]  What a great prank.
[03:10:33.396 --> 03:10:36.419]  The staffers were scrambling around to let him know.
[03:10:36.419 --> 03:10:38.962]  They were scrambling around to let him know.
[03:10:38.962 --> 03:10:40.764]  No, no, no.
[03:10:40.764 --> 03:10:41.585]  It's not a joke.
[03:10:41.585 --> 03:10:43.087]  It's not a prank.
[03:10:43.087 --> 03:10:44.709]  You actually got fired.
[03:10:44.709 --> 03:10:49.114]  Definitely one of those awkward moments and that's what we need more of.
[03:10:50.205 --> 03:10:54.288]  There have been way too many leaks, way too many, way too many national security leaks.
[03:10:54.288 --> 03:10:57.992]  So we had a few, few stories, others queued up that we definitely wanted to talk about.
[03:10:57.992 --> 03:11:04.397]  I think we wanted to bring Jack Posobiec on if the production team was able to Skype him in or loop him in.
[03:11:04.397 --> 03:11:06.459]  So Jack Posobiec, he's a friend of mine.
[03:11:06.459 --> 03:11:07.479]  He's done a film with me.
[03:11:07.479 --> 03:11:12.744]  We did a great film together, actually, about the rape epidemic in Sweden called Invasion.
[03:11:13.644 --> 03:11:21.328]  And we sent Jack Posobiec to Sweden to these no-go zones to find out what is really going on in Sweden, what is really going on.
[03:11:21.328 --> 03:11:29.692]  So I think Jack is going to join us if we can get him patched in and strapped in because he went into the White House briefing room yesterday.
[03:11:29.692 --> 03:11:31.733]  The media freaked out.
[03:11:31.733 --> 03:11:34.794]  This happened to me too when I went into a White House press briefing.
[03:11:34.794 --> 03:11:42.598]  I'm credentialed for the White House and I've watched Marine One land, you know, at the White House lawn and I attended a press briefing and everything.
[03:11:43.669 --> 03:11:48.210]  The fake news media was really freaking out because I'm credentialed as a White House correspondent.
[03:11:48.210 --> 03:11:51.611]  Jack Kosovic is now credentialed as a White House correspondent.
[03:11:51.611 --> 03:11:53.391]  Jerome Corsi, I believe, is.
[03:11:53.391 --> 03:11:55.552]  InfoWars is.
[03:11:55.552 --> 03:12:00.493]  They want to keep us out there because they want to control the news.
[03:12:00.493 --> 03:12:08.615]  And the reason I want to get Jack on is because I want to take all of you listening and watching behind the scenes of how the fake news gets made.
[03:12:08.615 --> 03:12:11.316]  What you're going to notice is that
[03:12:12.523 --> 03:12:18.086]  You're going to hear all the same stories, all the same questions.
[03:12:18.086 --> 03:12:20.227]  There's no creativity in the room.
[03:12:20.227 --> 03:12:26.090]  So when Jack attended the briefing yesterday, everybody was General Flynn, General Flynn.
[03:12:26.090 --> 03:12:27.311]  What about General Flynn?
[03:12:27.311 --> 03:12:28.532]  What about General Flynn?
[03:12:28.532 --> 03:12:32.174]  That's all they ever asked about was General Flynn.
[03:12:32.174 --> 03:12:32.414]  Why?
[03:12:33.283 --> 03:12:37.565]  Flynn hasn't been part of the administration for six months.
[03:12:37.565 --> 03:12:40.386]  There's nothing new about General Flynn.
[03:12:40.386 --> 03:12:43.287]  General Flynn is such a tired meme.
[03:12:43.287 --> 03:12:45.208]  It's a tired story.
[03:12:45.208 --> 03:12:50.670]  But what happens is all the fake news people, they're on an email list together.
[03:12:50.670 --> 03:12:54.551]  This was exposed a while back called the Journo List.
[03:12:54.551 --> 03:12:59.533]  I don't know if those of you listening and watching can remember, but maybe the production team can pull up the article.
[03:12:59.533 --> 03:13:00.994]  I think the Daily Caller revealed this.
[03:13:01.747 --> 03:13:05.008]  It was called the J-U-R-N-O List.
[03:13:05.008 --> 03:13:06.629]  Journalist.
[03:13:06.629 --> 03:13:09.410]  They had an email list where they conspired.
[03:13:09.410 --> 03:13:11.570]  They conspired to shape the narrative.
[03:13:11.570 --> 03:13:12.010]  Beautiful.
[03:13:12.010 --> 03:13:13.451]  These guys are so great.
[03:13:13.451 --> 03:13:18.152]  The production team is, if you love this production team, you gotta buy the toothpick.
[03:13:18.152 --> 03:13:19.553]  You gotta support these guys.
[03:13:19.553 --> 03:13:20.493]  They're girls too.
[03:13:20.493 --> 03:13:23.634]  They're so fantastic that you can talk about things.
[03:13:23.634 --> 03:13:25.835]  They just pull it right up because they live for this.
[03:13:26.775 --> 03:13:28.037]  This is a passion job.
[03:13:28.037 --> 03:13:31.120]  That's what most people don't realize who are listening and watching.
[03:13:31.120 --> 03:13:42.254]  Everybody I met when I took a big tour of the studios and had unprecedented access as a journalist to the Infowars headquarters, nobody else in media was given the full tour like I was.
[03:13:43.095 --> 03:13:44.276]  These people are passionate.
[03:13:44.276 --> 03:13:46.838]  You can talk about a story and they'll pull it up.
[03:13:46.838 --> 03:13:51.061]  Because for them, this is not merely their passion.
[03:13:51.061 --> 03:13:52.422]  This isn't merely their hobby.
[03:13:52.422 --> 03:13:54.283]  This is their profession, all rolled into one.
[03:13:54.283 --> 03:13:55.724]  They're living their passion.
[03:13:55.724 --> 03:13:58.426]  And that is why, you know, the toothpaste is on sale.
[03:13:58.426 --> 03:13:59.887]  Everybody uses toothpaste.
[03:13:59.887 --> 03:14:02.769]  A lot of people don't like the caveman stuff that I use.
[03:14:02.769 --> 03:14:05.811]  And I understand that maybe people don't want to use brain force.
[03:14:05.811 --> 03:14:08.373]  I'm not here to tell anybody what to do with your life.
[03:14:08.373 --> 03:14:09.914]  You got to live your life on your own terms.
[03:14:09.914 --> 03:14:10.975]  You got to live life as you like.
[03:14:11.755 --> 03:14:13.876]  But everybody brushes their teeth.
[03:14:13.876 --> 03:14:18.519]  A simple way to support the operation is if everybody just bought the toothpaste.
[03:14:18.519 --> 03:14:22.682]  If everybody just bought the toothpaste, they could hire a hundred more people in InfoWars.
[03:14:22.682 --> 03:14:31.108]  If everybody listening, all they did was bought the toothpaste, which everybody needs toothpaste anyway, they could hire a hundred more people.
[03:14:31.108 --> 03:14:36.471]  They could create hundreds more shows, bring in more talent, give more opportunity.
[03:14:36.471 --> 03:14:37.592]  Everybody uses toothpaste.
[03:14:38.317 --> 03:14:40.500]  And that's a great way to support the show.
[03:14:40.500 --> 03:14:42.662]  It's a win-win for everybody.
[03:14:42.662 --> 03:14:46.927]  So what Posobiec discovered, they all are emailing and texting.
[03:14:46.927 --> 03:14:48.029]  He actually revealed this.
[03:14:48.029 --> 03:14:51.793]  That's why I really hope I can get him on as an eyewitness account.
[03:14:51.793 --> 03:14:57.039]  They're emailing each other in the White House Correspondents Room what to ask.
[03:14:57.751 --> 03:15:01.272]  They're shaping the narrative in real time.
[03:15:01.272 --> 03:15:02.053]  In real time.
[03:15:02.053 --> 03:15:11.036]  So for those of you who've never been in, I don't know if the production team, if they can pull up the video that I took from inside the White House press briefing room and you can see everybody sits down.
[03:15:11.036 --> 03:15:14.217]  It's almost like you're in a small college lecture room.
[03:15:15.620 --> 03:15:18.963]  Everybody sits there in these very small airplane-like seats.
[03:15:18.963 --> 03:15:20.344]  The facilities are dilapidated.
[03:15:20.344 --> 03:15:21.605]  It's actually disgusting.
[03:15:21.605 --> 03:15:23.167]  These people are animals.
[03:15:23.167 --> 03:15:25.669]  The break room is right by the bathroom.
[03:15:25.669 --> 03:15:26.249]  It's filthy.
[03:15:26.249 --> 03:15:27.470]  The bathroom is nasty.
[03:15:27.470 --> 03:15:28.591]  The stench.
[03:15:28.591 --> 03:15:30.613]  The carpeting is worn down.
[03:15:30.613 --> 03:15:32.115]  They're not clean people.
[03:15:32.115 --> 03:15:35.558]  The White House correspondents are just filthy animals.
[03:15:35.558 --> 03:15:36.338]  People saw that.
[03:15:36.338 --> 03:15:36.639]  They go,
[03:15:37.379 --> 03:15:41.923]  They go, wait a minute, these people are drinking water and eating food right by the bathroom?
[03:15:41.923 --> 03:15:43.324]  They're just disgusting.
[03:15:43.324 --> 03:15:44.364]  They're filthy.
[03:15:44.364 --> 03:15:45.605]  It's so gross, right?
[03:15:45.605 --> 03:15:51.209]  So if you look inside, you can kind of see how the seating chart is and the seating thing is arranged.
[03:15:51.209 --> 03:15:54.612]  And they all text each other what questions to ask.
[03:15:54.612 --> 03:15:55.713]  They all collude.
[03:15:56.425 --> 03:15:58.567]  They collude in real- See the seating?
[03:15:58.567 --> 03:16:07.417]  You know, you can see- get a sense of like the seating and that was of course when I triggered that- that hack who will not disavow the violence in Antifa and she got really mad at me.
[03:16:08.686 --> 03:16:14.647]  But if you look at the seating arrangement, you can see it's like a high school thing and they're like, call on me!
[03:16:14.647 --> 03:16:15.387]  Spicer!
[03:16:15.387 --> 03:16:16.007]  Spicy!
[03:16:16.007 --> 03:16:16.528]  Call on me!
[03:16:16.528 --> 03:16:17.228]  Pick me!
[03:16:17.228 --> 03:16:17.708]  Pick me!
[03:16:17.708 --> 03:16:20.468]  I don't know if you kids ever watched Welcome Back, Cotter?
[03:16:20.468 --> 03:16:30.550]  Uh, Vinnie Barbarino, and there was one character in there, Horschwitz or something, I can't remember, but whenever the teacher, Mr. Cotter, had a question, ooh, ooh, ooh!
[03:16:30.550 --> 03:16:31.131]  Pick me!
[03:16:31.131 --> 03:16:31.671]  Pick me!
[03:16:31.671 --> 03:16:32.291]  Spicer!
[03:16:32.291 --> 03:16:32.871]  Pick me!
[03:16:32.871 --> 03:16:33.651]  Pick me!
[03:16:33.651 --> 03:16:38.152]  It is the most reviling, disgusting, these people are so cringey!
[03:16:38.936 --> 03:16:40.517]  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
[03:16:40.517 --> 03:16:41.298]  You should see it.
[03:16:41.298 --> 03:16:44.361]  It's like a bunch of baboons.
[03:16:44.361 --> 03:16:51.427]  If you've ever been to the zoo and you watched a bunch of baboons throwing poop around, that is really what the White House correspondents do.
[03:16:51.427 --> 03:16:53.169]  The ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
[03:16:53.169 --> 03:16:54.110]  They sound like apes.
[03:16:54.110 --> 03:16:55.671]  It's unbelievable.
[03:16:55.671 --> 03:17:04.620]  I hope Alex goes in there to a press conference, too, because witnessing it in real time is really... Maybe I'll go... Maybe... Here's a good idea.
[03:17:05.802 --> 03:17:07.524]  I just came up with this.
[03:17:07.524 --> 03:17:14.993]  Should Alex Jones and I attend a White House press briefing together?
[03:17:14.993 --> 03:17:15.874]  What do you guys think?
[03:17:15.874 --> 03:17:17.937]  What do you guys think watching at home?

[03:17:22.883 --> 03:17:24.085]  Should Alex Jones and I
[03:17:24.850 --> 03:17:26.891]  Take a trip out to Washington D.C.
[03:17:26.891 --> 03:17:30.332]  together and attend a White House press briefing together.
[03:17:30.332 --> 03:17:34.754]  The idea just came to me because, I don't know, I think that would be great.
[03:17:34.754 --> 03:17:37.274]  Jack Posobiec maybe could be there.
[03:17:37.274 --> 03:17:42.056]  Cassandra Fairbanks, Lucien, maybe Jim Hoff, Gateway Pundit and everybody.
[03:17:42.056 --> 03:17:45.577]  So if you think that is, I just came up with this idea.
[03:17:45.577 --> 03:17:49.559]  If you think it would be a good idea, say tweet out
[03:17:50.592 --> 03:17:54.574]  Alex Jones should attend a White House press briefing with Serge.

[03:18:01.417 --> 03:18:03.358]  I think that it would be phenomenal.
[03:18:04.252 --> 03:18:09.055]  Phenomenal day for truth and truth warriors for Alex Jones to attend.
[03:18:09.055 --> 03:18:11.137]  Even without me, with Jerome Corsi.
[03:18:11.137 --> 03:18:14.579]  I'm not trying to, you know, invite myself out to anything with Alex.
[03:18:14.579 --> 03:18:24.446]  So Jerome Corsi doesn't matter to me, but I would love to see a truth warrior like Alex Jones inside the White House press briefing room, attending a press briefing.
[03:18:24.446 --> 03:18:28.949]  And then you could just see the filthy, disgusting animals the White House correspondents are.
[03:18:28.949 --> 03:18:31.610]  The dilapidated facilities.
[03:18:31.610 --> 03:18:32.311]  So you walk in.
[03:18:33.524 --> 03:18:36.245]  There's all these people sitting around like high school.
[03:18:36.245 --> 03:18:40.566]  And then you walk back into the break room and the carpet is worn down.
[03:18:40.566 --> 03:18:41.467]  It's filthy.
[03:18:41.467 --> 03:18:43.607]  Why don't they change the carpet?
[03:18:43.607 --> 03:18:48.169]  Why doesn't the White House Correspondents Association put in a proper coffee machine?
[03:18:48.169 --> 03:18:53.031]  You went over there and they had like a little espresso machine or some nasty thing that was dirty.
[03:18:53.031 --> 03:18:54.571]  I wasn't even going to drink the espresso.
[03:18:54.571 --> 03:18:55.512]  I was going to go back there.
[03:18:55.512 --> 03:18:56.412]  I want a little caffeine.
[03:18:57.219 --> 03:19:00.500]  And I went back there and I thought, what bacteria?
[03:19:00.500 --> 03:19:02.360]  Forget about, you know, you need a water filter.
[03:19:02.360 --> 03:19:04.560]  We know that's not filtered water.
[03:19:04.560 --> 03:19:10.222]  We definitely know the White House Correspondents Association, they are not drinking filtered water.
[03:19:10.222 --> 03:19:14.102]  They're drinking the tap water with the fluoride and other chemicals in there.
[03:19:14.102 --> 03:19:15.483]  But it's gross.
[03:19:15.483 --> 03:19:18.543]  The bacteria, the germs, I wouldn't drink out of that stuff.
[03:19:18.543 --> 03:19:20.504]  I wasn't going to even touch any of that.
[03:19:20.504 --> 03:19:21.944]  Thankfully, I had to bring alcohol.
[03:19:23.099 --> 03:19:28.604]  Stopped to clean up my hands afterwards because it was so gross in there and you think why don't they take better care of themselves?
[03:19:28.604 --> 03:19:30.225]  Why don't they take more pride in themselves?
[03:19:30.225 --> 03:19:32.166]  Why don't they take more pride in their facilities?
[03:19:32.166 --> 03:19:39.212]  So you walk past this dirty coffee machine and unfiltered water Into the break room, which is by the bathroom.
[03:19:39.212 --> 03:19:40.133]  It's completely gross.
[03:19:40.133 --> 03:19:51.802]  So hopefully we can patch in Jack Posobiec and talk about it We can talk about why the fake news media gets triggered when real journalists attend and we can tell you again that is because
[03:19:52.637 --> 03:19:56.518]  They are fabricating the narrative in real time.
[03:19:56.518 --> 03:19:58.479]  I saw it when I was there.
[03:19:58.479 --> 03:20:04.121]  Jack Sullivan saw it when he was... Mother's Day is this Sunday and ProFlowers is offering an amazing special.

[03:24:30.833 --> 03:24:32.375]  We want to build bigger shows.
[03:24:32.375 --> 03:24:34.077]  Alex kind of hinted at that.
[03:24:34.077 --> 03:24:35.479]  I did an earlier segment with him.
[03:24:35.479 --> 03:24:36.920]  I hadn't made that public yet.
[03:24:36.920 --> 03:24:37.781]  Nobody actually knows.
[03:24:38.482 --> 03:24:55.313]  So Alex and I had talked about a five-day-a-week show for me that might be three hours long, but we might actually bring in five other people or four other people, and it would be the five-style show, but it would be with a rotating panel of globalist killers.
[03:24:55.313 --> 03:24:59.315]  But all that stuff is going to require resources, so infowarestore.com
[03:25:00.516 --> 03:25:02.517]  It's the way that you can support all that stuff.
[03:25:02.517 --> 03:25:05.278]  Like I said, just buy the toothpaste, which is, which is on sale.
[03:25:05.278 --> 03:25:06.978]  So right away, though, let's get hopping.
[03:25:06.978 --> 03:25:09.239]  We got Jack Klusovic in studio.
[03:25:09.239 --> 03:25:13.200]  I talked earlier about my experience as a White House correspondent.
[03:25:13.200 --> 03:25:16.782]  So if we can patch Jack in, I would love to just hear from him.
[03:25:16.782 --> 03:25:20.243]  What was it like being a White House correspondent?
[03:25:20.243 --> 03:25:21.723]  How you doing, Jack?
[03:25:21.723 --> 03:25:22.744]  Hey, Mike, how you doing?
[03:25:22.744 --> 03:25:23.864]  Great to be here, man.
[03:25:23.864 --> 03:25:26.265]  I got to tell you, it was quite an experience.
[03:25:26.265 --> 03:25:27.625]  First time in the White House for me.
[03:25:27.625 --> 03:25:29.046]  Was that your first time in the White House as well?
[03:25:30.137 --> 03:25:32.399]  I attended, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:25:32.399 --> 03:25:37.924]  As a White House correspondent, I had never visited it before, though, as a tourist.
[03:25:37.924 --> 03:25:38.165]  Okay.
[03:25:38.165 --> 03:25:38.385]  Yeah.
[03:25:38.385 --> 03:25:47.833]  So for me, I hadn't even been through before, you know, going in there, it was amazing to walk in and, you know, the majesty and, you know, we talk politics a lot and it's like, wow, this is, this is real.
[03:25:47.833 --> 03:25:55.841]  I mean, Lincoln was here, Reagan was here, everybody, Kennedy, you know, and then you get through to the press office and suddenly the magic all kind of falls apart.
[03:25:56.536 --> 03:25:56.836]  I think so.
[03:26:11.499 --> 03:26:13.040]  You know, they give you looks in person.
[03:26:13.040 --> 03:26:14.421]  They won't really say anything.
[03:26:14.421 --> 03:26:16.343]  But then they'll go on Twitter and they're lighting me up.
[03:26:16.343 --> 03:26:18.444]  Oh, I can't believe Jack Posobiec is here.
[03:26:18.444 --> 03:26:24.109]  I can't believe Jack Posobiec, the racist, is here attacking me, attacking my family, attacking my background.
[03:26:24.109 --> 03:26:24.669]  It's crazy.
[03:26:24.669 --> 03:26:26.130]  They didn't want me there.
[03:26:26.130 --> 03:26:27.211]  They didn't want you there.
[03:26:27.211 --> 03:26:31.214]  And it's because they don't like that we will speak truth to them.
[03:26:31.214 --> 03:26:36.939]  Well, and would you agree, though, that they're just filthy animals with bad hygiene and that everything was dirty?
[03:26:36.939 --> 03:26:39.021]  They don't even wash the table for the break room.
[03:26:39.021 --> 03:26:39.901]  It's just nasty.
[03:26:39.901 --> 03:26:40.682]  Would you agree with that?
[03:26:42.077 --> 03:26:43.958]  A lot of it was nasty.
[03:26:43.958 --> 03:26:51.484]  There's actually a sign-up even on the coffee dispenser that apparently had been donated by Tom Hanks for like $2,000.
[03:26:51.484 --> 03:26:56.187]  And there was a sign-up reminding them, hey, this is a $2,000 coffee maker.
[03:26:56.187 --> 03:26:58.028]  Could you guys wash it after you use it?
[03:26:58.028 --> 03:26:59.029]  I mean, just basic stuff.
[03:27:01.641 --> 03:27:10.930]  I'm laughing here because that was actually, I was going to go get myself a coffee and it looked so filthy I thought maybe I could get the flu or bacteria, staph infection.
[03:27:10.930 --> 03:27:14.994]  I'm actually coming down with a little bit of something I think I may have got.
[03:27:14.994 --> 03:27:19.077]  I've got my nasal spray right here for my throat spray.
[03:27:19.077 --> 03:27:20.379]  Yeah, that would be my advice.
[03:27:21.437 --> 03:27:29.185]  Yeah, bring an alcohol hand sanitizer if you go into the White House room because these people are so filthy.
[03:27:29.185 --> 03:27:30.106]  They're disgusting.
[03:27:30.106 --> 03:27:31.207]  I don't know if they shower.
[03:27:31.207 --> 03:27:33.109]  They don't smell right.
[03:27:33.109 --> 03:27:35.732]  I don't know why they don't take better care of their facilities.
[03:27:35.732 --> 03:27:41.138]  So the coffee machine was a perfect example, a perfect microcosm where they had to tell
[03:27:42.260 --> 03:27:46.445]  They have to remind reporters, hey, why don't you not be a filthy animal?
[03:27:46.445 --> 03:27:48.607]  Why don't you have some basic hygiene?
[03:27:48.607 --> 03:27:50.709]  Why don't you clean up after yourselves?
[03:27:50.709 --> 03:27:58.197]  These are the people we're supposed to trust to cover the minutiae of foreign policy and national security.
[03:27:58.197 --> 03:28:00.380]  They can't even cover the minutiae of a coffee machine.
[03:28:02.379 --> 03:28:07.540]  Yeah, and you see these guys too is when when they're not on camera, you know, Mike, I've been with you.
[03:28:07.540 --> 03:28:09.221]  I've worked on you with you on a lot of stories.
[03:28:09.221 --> 03:28:10.501]  You work for me on a lot of stories.
[03:28:10.501 --> 03:28:13.402]  When we're when we're not periscoping, we're talking to people.
[03:28:13.402 --> 03:28:16.043]  We're going searching out for stories out there.
[03:28:16.043 --> 03:28:18.923]  These guys, they get off camera and they go read a book.
[03:28:18.923 --> 03:28:20.864]  They go sit and like stare off into space.
[03:28:20.864 --> 03:28:22.164]  It was the weirdest thing I've ever seen.
[03:28:22.164 --> 03:28:25.405]  Or they'd be kind of like chatting, just sort of gossiping with each other.
[03:28:25.405 --> 03:28:25.785]  And I'm like,
[03:28:26.288 --> 03:28:27.549]  What's going on here?
[03:28:27.549 --> 03:28:32.371]  And then the camera would come on and they'd start reading from the teleprompter and it'd be like, oh, okay, that's your job.
[03:28:32.371 --> 03:28:35.952]  But where are you actually going and getting your news from?
[03:28:35.952 --> 03:28:37.773]  It's like, that's not even part of it.
[03:28:37.773 --> 03:28:42.475]  Well, here's what I noticed too, is they're all like this, texting each other what to ask.
[03:28:42.475 --> 03:28:43.876]  They're colluding in real time.
[03:28:43.876 --> 03:28:46.057]  Did you observe that too?
[03:28:46.057 --> 03:28:47.418]  Absolutely observed that.
[03:28:47.418 --> 03:28:51.139]  They were texting and I also saw a couple Slack channels they had opened up.
[03:28:51.139 --> 03:28:54.021]  Slack is, it's sort of like an internet chat room forum kind of thing.
[03:28:54.021 --> 03:28:54.741]  It's private chat.
[03:28:55.131 --> 03:29:01.475]  But it's, you could see because one person would ask a question on, and all they're trying to do is trip up Spicer, right?
[03:29:01.475 --> 03:29:03.656]  They're just trying to get Spicer to make a mistake.
[03:29:03.656 --> 03:29:05.917]  Like, say four when the last time he said three.
[03:29:05.917 --> 03:29:09.780]  You know, so some stupid little tiny mistake so they could say, ah ha, he's a lion.
[03:29:09.780 --> 03:29:10.940]  Ah ha, he's crazy.
[03:29:10.940 --> 03:29:14.602]  So, all they were doing was asking the same question over and over and over 10, 11, 12 times.
[03:29:16.812 --> 03:29:17.532]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:29:17.532 --> 03:29:18.733]  I'm glad you mentioned it.
[03:29:18.733 --> 03:29:25.036]  So I brought up JournalList earlier, which The Daily Caller exposed in 2008.
[03:29:25.036 --> 03:29:27.557]  The new JournalList is now a Slack channel.
[03:29:27.557 --> 03:29:36.882]  So we're about to head to break, but I want to keep you back on the next segment so we can talk about how you watch them colluding in real time on JournalList.
[03:29:36.882 --> 03:29:39.403]  The new JournalList is a Slack channel.
[03:29:39.403 --> 03:29:41.064]  We need to find out.
[03:29:41.064 --> 03:29:42.044]  We need to get a leak.
[03:29:42.044 --> 03:29:43.845]  We need to get a leak from this.
[03:29:43.845 --> 03:29:45.286]  So I'll have you back.
[03:29:49.003 --> 03:29:52.006]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.006 --> 03:29:55.630]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.963 --> 03:30:11.048]  Astonishing Anti-Federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution, fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[03:30:11.048 --> 03:30:14.030]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[03:30:14.030 --> 03:30:22.614]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you are to become a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[03:30:22.614 --> 03:30:25.255]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[03:30:25.515 --> 03:30:33.637]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be secure, when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[03:30:33.637 --> 03:30:37.979]  Today, everything the government does, at every level, is concealed from us.
[03:30:37.979 --> 03:30:42.900]  We have trade deals to manage our economy, that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[03:30:42.900 --> 03:30:48.882]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[03:30:49.122 --> 03:30:51.326]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[03:30:51.326 --> 03:30:57.178]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[03:30:57.178 --> 03:30:59.202]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:30:59.707 --> 03:31:01.608]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:31:01.608 --> 03:31:03.628]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:31:03.628 --> 03:31:06.409]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:31:06.409 --> 03:31:12.591]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:12.591 --> 03:31:19.954]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[03:31:20.094 --> 03:31:21.775]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:31:21.775 --> 03:31:26.860]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[03:31:26.860 --> 03:31:29.321]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:29.321 --> 03:31:37.348]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:37.348 --> 03:31:38.309]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:39.518 --> 03:31:42.901]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:42.901 --> 03:31:47.025]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:47.025 --> 03:31:53.750]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:57.834]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4wrestore.com.
[03:32:00.225 --> 03:32:02.046]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[03:32:02.046 --> 03:32:08.648]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[03:32:08.648 --> 03:32:11.809]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[03:32:11.809 --> 03:32:21.592]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[03:32:21.592 --> 03:32:22.433]  Caveman.
[03:32:22.433 --> 03:32:27.514]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[03:32:27.514 --> 03:32:29.615]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[03:32:29.915 --> 03:32:33.056]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[03:32:33.056 --> 03:32:38.217]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[03:32:38.217 --> 03:32:46.278]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[03:32:46.278 --> 03:32:54.120]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[03:32:54.120 --> 03:32:58.941]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forwardslife.com today.
[03:33:09.901 --> 03:33:12.030]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:12.030 --> 03:33:13.979]  Because there is a war on.
[03:33:13.979 --> 03:33:14.902]  For your mind.
[03:33:23.391 --> 03:33:24.652]  And we're back!
[03:33:24.652 --> 03:33:28.075]  Mike Stern, guest host for Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:28.075 --> 03:33:33.300]  Today we have a special guest, White House correspondent Jack Posobiec.
[03:33:33.300 --> 03:33:38.485]  Jack Posobiec and I have an interesting kind of fun friendship for a lot of reasons.
[03:33:38.485 --> 03:33:48.915]  One is that he went into the no-go zones in Sweden to do a special journalism project about invasion and how Sweden become the rape capital of the West.
[03:33:49.515 --> 03:33:52.819]  And then the Rebel Media, which is expanding.
[03:33:52.819 --> 03:33:55.603]  Here's what Alex Jones always said, and I agree with this 100%.
[03:33:55.603 --> 03:33:58.707]  None of us are competitors.
[03:33:58.707 --> 03:34:06.196]  We need 100 Alex Joneses, 100 Jack Pasovas, 100 Infowars, 100 Rebel Medias, because people are so starved for the truth.
[03:34:06.756 --> 03:34:09.418]  We can't even possibly reach everybody.
[03:34:09.418 --> 03:34:10.939]  There is no competition.
[03:34:10.939 --> 03:34:12.680]  That is why, I mean, think about it.
[03:34:12.680 --> 03:34:16.202]  Most people would say, why does Alex have so many guests on?
[03:34:16.202 --> 03:34:18.583]  Why would Cernovich be guest hosting?
[03:34:18.583 --> 03:34:21.245]  And immediately I want to bring other people on.
[03:34:21.245 --> 03:34:25.528]  Most people in the fake news media, they would say, well, that's crazy.
[03:34:25.528 --> 03:34:27.509]  Why would you want to promote other people?
[03:34:27.509 --> 03:34:31.652]  That is because we're actually committed to the truth and we're committed to the message.
[03:34:31.652 --> 03:34:33.713]  We are just all soldiers.
[03:34:34.293 --> 03:34:36.013]  And the war for truth.
[03:34:36.013 --> 03:34:37.534]  So it's great to have Jack back on.
[03:34:37.534 --> 03:34:39.034]  How you doing, Jack?
[03:34:39.034 --> 03:34:39.534]  I'm doing great.
[03:34:39.534 --> 03:34:40.534]  It's great to be here.
[03:34:40.534 --> 03:34:48.355]  Happy, so happy to be on Rebel Media after having worked with Cernovich Media and Infowars a lot in the past, doing the Invasion Project.
[03:34:48.355 --> 03:34:50.096]  And definitely agree with your comments there.
[03:34:50.096 --> 03:34:51.236]  I mean, just think about it.
[03:34:51.236 --> 03:34:54.277]  Would you ever see Sean Hannity go on CNN?
[03:34:54.277 --> 03:34:58.277]  Would you ever see, like, Joe Scarborough or Mika Brzezinski on Fox & Friends?
[03:34:58.277 --> 03:35:02.558]  They're right down the street, but they would never, ever do that because it breaks sort of those
[03:35:02.938 --> 03:35:09.945]  I don't know, unwritten rules of mainstream media that, oh, we can't talk together because it's this whole false reality that they're trying to pitch to people.
[03:35:09.945 --> 03:35:12.107]  This whole PSYOP that we're completely impartial.
[03:35:12.107 --> 03:35:16.811]  We're not just normal people that live normal lives and are given scripts of narratives to run.
[03:35:17.950 --> 03:35:20.752]  Yeah, and they also they view each other as competitors.
[03:35:20.752 --> 03:35:27.856]  They have a scarcity mindset where they think, well, hey, if I promote somebody else, then that'll take the shine away from me.
[03:35:27.856 --> 03:35:40.824]  But whereas you and Alex and Ezra and others, the way view it as we were done, all of us will be dead and in prison and thought control camps if we don't fight together and promote each other.
[03:35:42.389 --> 03:35:46.410]  Yeah, because we, I mean, that's why, you know, I love the name Rebel Media, because we are the rebels.
[03:35:46.410 --> 03:35:48.311]  We're the scrappy rebels in this thing.
[03:35:48.311 --> 03:35:54.453]  There are millions of dollars against us, billions, trillions of dollars, if you want to talk about the people that are behind all this.
[03:35:54.453 --> 03:36:04.796]  And we've got, what, maybe a couple hundred guys that do these live streams that break this kind of news, guys and gals, I should say, and get this stuff out to the people.
[03:36:04.796 --> 03:36:07.577]  No, believe me, we need all the help we can get.
[03:36:07.577 --> 03:36:08.777]  We don't need any in-fighting.
[03:36:08.777 --> 03:36:09.698]  And that's why they try.
[03:36:09.698 --> 03:36:10.898]  That's why they try very hard.
[03:36:11.243 --> 03:36:18.706]  They actually sent in fabricated evidence, false stuff, lies, all kinds of stuff to Alex about me that were completely untrue because they want to use a divide and conquer strategy.
[03:36:18.706 --> 03:36:20.007]  They are so afraid now.
[03:36:37.913 --> 03:36:43.456]  That people like us are united and we're just saying, hey, we're not going to believe the fabricated stuff.
[03:36:43.456 --> 03:36:44.217]  We don't even care.
[03:36:44.217 --> 03:36:47.478]  We don't answer to you in the fake news media that everybody's uniting.
[03:36:47.478 --> 03:36:55.203]  And it's interesting you mentioned the the rebel media because there was a headline action in the Atlantic which said rebel and the White House.
[03:36:55.203 --> 03:36:57.004]  Would you like to talk about that a little bit more, please?
[03:36:57.973 --> 03:37:00.455]  I actually love that headline, the rebel in the White House.
[03:37:00.455 --> 03:37:02.837]  I mean, isn't that what the Trump movement is all about?
[03:37:02.837 --> 03:37:05.820]  There I am, with the beautiful Tanya Tay next to me.
[03:37:05.820 --> 03:37:08.582]  And of course, you know, they throw it in there, far-right media.
[03:37:08.582 --> 03:37:15.047]  I think far-right is the new media speak for not Marxist at this point, it seems like.
[03:37:15.047 --> 03:37:17.990]  And there was a lot in there, but what was interesting to me was
[03:37:18.922 --> 03:37:21.763]  You know, there wasn't a statement about like, hey, here's this guy.
[03:37:21.763 --> 03:37:23.184]  He works at Rebel Media.
[03:37:23.184 --> 03:37:30.728]  Rebel started two years ago out of Ezra Levant's living room, did about 6,000 videos, and now they're in the White House and they're credentialed.
[03:37:30.728 --> 03:37:33.089]  And hey, isn't that interesting how media is changing?
[03:37:33.089 --> 03:37:34.490]  There wasn't a story about that.
[03:37:34.490 --> 03:37:36.311]  It was, why are you here?
[03:37:36.311 --> 03:37:38.472]  Why do you think you should be allowed to be in here?
[03:37:38.472 --> 03:37:39.732]  Why should you be in this room?
[03:37:39.732 --> 03:37:47.997]  And everybody, all the comments I was getting on Twitter all the day, all day long, Keith Olbermann came out and called me a scumbag and said, I'm happy to see you can tie a tie.
[03:37:47.997 --> 03:37:48.617]  And it was like,
[03:37:48.939 --> 03:37:51.501]  They don't want us in that room, period.
[03:37:51.501 --> 03:37:54.122]  The Atlantic article is connecting me.
[03:37:54.122 --> 03:37:56.744]  There's a lot of fake news in there regarding me.
[03:37:56.744 --> 03:37:59.746]  There's a lot of stuff that says I'm a conspiracy theorist and this and that.
[03:37:59.746 --> 03:38:02.568]  Well, if I'm a conspiracy theorist, why are you guys talking about me?
[03:38:02.568 --> 03:38:11.773]  If I'm a conspiracy theorist, why have the things that I have reported on been confirmed by the people who have reported it by or by WikiLeaks and other independent organizations?
[03:38:11.773 --> 03:38:14.055]  If we're making this stuff up, why does it all keep coming true?
[03:38:14.910 --> 03:38:19.712]  Well, I love that you brought up the snob appeal because something interesting happened on Twitter.
[03:38:19.712 --> 03:38:23.673]  So, as you know, there was a Real News Dinner in Washington, D.C.
[03:38:23.673 --> 03:38:24.854]  Jim Hoft hosted it.
[03:38:24.854 --> 03:38:30.656]  They gave me this nice little trophy, Mike Cernovich, Exceptionalism and New Media, the 2016 election.
[03:38:30.656 --> 03:38:32.636]  It was a nice thing, a very nice gesture.
[03:38:32.636 --> 03:38:33.497]  I wasn't expecting it.
[03:38:33.497 --> 03:38:34.197]  I was very grateful.
[03:38:34.597 --> 03:38:36.199]  So you know what they did?
[03:38:36.199 --> 03:38:44.766]  These so-called journalists, they went on to some trophy shop and they go, oh, you can buy these wholesale for, you know, 20 bucks or 30 bucks or whatever.
[03:38:44.766 --> 03:38:45.167]  And I thought,
[03:38:46.980 --> 03:38:50.282]  A number of reasons, a number of things are wrong with that.
[03:38:50.282 --> 03:38:50.982]  That's what I mean.
[03:38:50.982 --> 03:38:56.664]  That's how they want to throw shade is they're not in the right social class like we are.
[03:38:56.664 --> 03:39:01.927]  That's how they, everybody listening, just so people listening know, this is what they think of you.
[03:39:01.927 --> 03:39:03.607]  They think that you are garbage.
[03:39:03.607 --> 03:39:09.410]  Whether you're white, black, Christian, Jewish, they think everybody listening and they think you are trash.
[03:39:10.010 --> 03:39:15.774]  They would make fun of your trophies you give your children because they're not the proper crystal.
[03:39:15.774 --> 03:39:17.236]  This is how these people are.
[03:39:17.236 --> 03:39:18.476]  They hate you.
[03:39:18.476 --> 03:39:25.342]  They loathe you and that is why they lie to you with a straight face because they don't believe those of you listening in are actually human.
[03:39:25.342 --> 03:39:26.583]  And it's really disgusting.
[03:39:26.583 --> 03:39:30.265]  So talk more about how they look at you and how they'll take your picture.
[03:39:30.265 --> 03:39:33.828]  I caught people taking pictures of me everywhere I walked when I did the press briefing.
[03:39:34.802 --> 03:39:47.246]  Well, yeah, they're looking at me and I saw this one guy at one point, I don't have all the names and faces yet, but, uh, you know, so we got, I got up and I went to the podium and I did the okay sign, you know, the okay sign that we all do cause Trump does it.
[03:39:47.246 --> 03:39:48.686]  And it's just kind of, it's a little trolly.
[03:39:48.686 --> 03:39:51.047]  It's a way to say, Hey, we're part of, we're, we're, we're behind Trump.
[03:39:51.047 --> 03:39:51.928]  We support the president.
[03:39:51.928 --> 03:39:53.328]  So I do the okay sign right there.
[03:39:53.328 --> 03:39:54.208]  Boom.
[03:39:54.208 --> 03:39:59.670]  And this guy gets this look just like he like bubbles up in his face and he sneaks in and he's like,
[03:40:00.367 --> 03:40:04.069]  Like laughing and he jumps on his phone and starts tweeting, like giggling.
[03:40:04.069 --> 03:40:08.991]  His pink, he got like pink and his beard was like, like all, you know, scraggly.
[03:40:08.991 --> 03:40:14.334]  And, and it was like, I actually turned to him and I said, Hey, you know, this is just the okay sign.
[03:40:14.334 --> 03:40:15.514]  We do this because Trump does it.
[03:40:15.514 --> 03:40:18.436]  You know, it's not, it's not what you guys all say it is.
[03:40:18.436 --> 03:40:21.117]  He just, his head just started bobbling like back and forth.
[03:40:21.117 --> 03:40:24.739]  He wanted to burst because he thought like, Oh, I gotcha.
[03:40:24.739 --> 03:40:26.680]  I got Jack Posobiec doing the okay sign.
[03:40:27.028 --> 03:40:34.294]  Because I got him and now I know exactly how to troll him because I can say he's a white supremacist or he's a Slavic, this and that, the other thing.
[03:40:34.294 --> 03:40:37.516]  And it's like, they don't even live in the same reality as us.
[03:40:37.516 --> 03:40:40.359]  They don't even live in the same reality as regular people.
[03:40:40.359 --> 03:40:44.502]  All they live for is how to attack us, how to come at us, how to come after us.
[03:40:44.502 --> 03:40:46.244]  They've been digging stuff up on my family.
[03:40:46.244 --> 03:40:51.868]  They've been digging stuff up on my fiancee, going through her social media accounts, everybody else.
[03:40:51.868 --> 03:40:54.590]  They're like, Jack, you've got this social media and that social media.
[03:40:54.590 --> 03:40:56.692]  I'm like, yeah, I'm friends with
[03:40:57.042 --> 03:40:57.723]  Her?
[03:40:57.723 --> 03:40:58.363]  And her sister?
[03:40:58.363 --> 03:41:00.886]  And yeah, she was born in Belarus and she's a U.S.
[03:41:00.886 --> 03:41:01.687]  citizen now.
[03:41:01.687 --> 03:41:07.032]  What does that have to do with these emails on Emmanuel Macron being real or not?
[03:41:07.032 --> 03:41:10.696]  That's all it is, is they want to attack you and they want to find any way to tear you down.
[03:41:11.032 --> 03:41:17.877]  Because they see us as members of regular people, you know, regular people coming out and getting into this journalism business.
[03:41:17.877 --> 03:41:22.600]  People that didn't come from, born from Silver Spoons, Vanderbilts, like Anderson Cooper.
[03:41:22.600 --> 03:41:24.622]  No, I'm a guy that worked at a pizza shop.
[03:41:24.622 --> 03:41:31.246]  I'm a guy that shoveled horse manure for a living for a long time, worked construction in Philadelphia, joined the military, and now I'm here doing this.
[03:41:31.246 --> 03:41:37.331]  And I'm a regular person, and it drives them absolutely insane that I'm standing in that White House room.
[03:41:38.331 --> 03:41:40.292]  Well, you bring up a number of points.
[03:41:40.292 --> 03:41:42.833]  One is the xenophobia that they accuse us of.
[03:41:42.833 --> 03:41:53.759]  The xenophobia from the press now, they are using stereotypes about your beautiful, talented, intelligent fiancee against her.
[03:41:53.759 --> 03:41:55.340]  They're calling her a Russian spy.
[03:41:55.340 --> 03:41:55.580]  Why?
[03:41:55.580 --> 03:41:57.421]  Because she's a foreigner?
[03:41:57.421 --> 03:41:59.202]  That sounds awfully xenophobic to me.
[03:41:59.202 --> 03:42:04.364]  Because I have a Croatian last name, they try to say that I'm Russian and I'm a Russian operative.
[03:42:04.364 --> 03:42:05.605]  Because you have a Polish name,
[03:42:06.065 --> 03:42:11.210]  So put aside how historically ignorant it is to expect Polish people to be pro-Russia.
[03:42:11.210 --> 03:42:24.083]  I would encourage the fake news people to actually pick up a book and read about how the Soviets oppressed the Polish and how Polish, actually, Polish nationalists have their own opinion on the Russians, which we're not going to go to now.
[03:42:24.083 --> 03:42:26.365]  Let's talk about the Holodomor sometime.
[03:42:26.365 --> 03:42:26.886]  Yeah.
[03:42:26.886 --> 03:42:27.747]  They're xenophobic.
[03:42:28.633 --> 03:42:44.245]  And the big thing, though, is they believe that anybody who doesn't have a trust fund, like Dave Weigel, if your parents weren't rich enough to send you to a $30,000 a year high school and then give you a trust fund to go to college, they think that you're trash and that you don't belong.
[03:42:46.684 --> 03:42:47.444]  Yeah, that simply is.
[03:42:47.444 --> 03:42:59.070]  If you didn't go to the right schools, if you didn't come up kissing the ring, if you didn't come up under the right way, if you weren't appointed and selected and, you know, handed off from company to company, moved over.
[03:42:59.070 --> 03:43:01.492]  So, this one, Julia Ioffe.
[03:43:01.492 --> 03:43:03.173]  Julia, I'm not sure how to say her last name.
[03:43:03.173 --> 03:43:04.833]  So, she's attacking me.
[03:43:04.833 --> 03:43:08.515]  She's attacking my fiancé as being Russian trolls, Russian spies.
[03:43:08.515 --> 03:43:11.637]  I look at her and so she was the one, if you remember, she worked for Politico.
[03:43:12.281 --> 03:43:20.987]  And then she put out the tweet accusing, accusing, actually accusing, not joking, accusing President Trump of having incest with his daughter.
[03:43:20.987 --> 03:43:22.208]  Incest with Ivanka Trump.
[03:43:22.208 --> 03:43:23.229]  This is not me making this up.
[03:43:23.229 --> 03:43:23.709]  She wrote it.
[03:43:23.709 --> 03:43:24.710]  Okay.
[03:43:24.710 --> 03:43:29.093]  And then she, Politico fired her, but she turns around and gets hired by the Atlantic.
[03:43:29.093 --> 03:43:32.536]  And it's, oh, well, I'm sure she'll, she'll uphold our standards and she'll be fine.
[03:43:32.536 --> 03:43:40.622]  They have no problem with saying something as heinously insane, reporting that as fact from the other side, but they call us conspiracy theorists.
[03:43:41.107 --> 03:43:41.767]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:43:41.767 --> 03:43:46.090]  So again, that's why the production team were able to pull this stuff up so quick.
[03:43:46.090 --> 03:43:49.952]  Yeah, she had actually accused Trump of incest.
[03:43:49.952 --> 03:43:52.233]  Talk about the definition of fake news.
[03:43:52.233 --> 03:44:00.098]  And also, this is a thing that we talk about a lot on the show is how they are so debased that if you show a picture of a daughter,
[03:44:01.374 --> 03:44:04.555]  And her father admire each other and loving each other.
[03:44:04.555 --> 03:44:10.158]  They view that as some kind of sickness because that is how diseased all of these people are.
[03:44:10.158 --> 03:44:19.282]  They view that as somehow wrong because they grew up in these demonic households of abuse and neglect and not being given any kind of attention.
[03:44:19.282 --> 03:44:22.323]  So they can't even comprehend paternal love.
[03:44:22.323 --> 03:44:26.265]  And in a way it's sad they aren't victims of the death cult that is modern liberalism.
[03:44:27.771 --> 03:44:28.472]  You're absolutely right.
[03:44:28.472 --> 03:44:30.313]  I was just actually listening to a statistic.
[03:44:30.313 --> 03:44:32.434]  It was on Stefan Molyneux, one of his older podcasts.
[03:44:32.434 --> 03:44:37.897]  He was talking about how now 40% of American children are growing up with absentee parents.
[03:44:37.897 --> 03:44:39.838]  That's exactly what this is all about.
[03:44:39.838 --> 03:44:43.560]  The breakdown of regular, normal families.
[03:44:43.560 --> 03:44:47.302]  Because then, once the children are taken away from the families, who do they get raised by?
[03:44:47.302 --> 03:44:49.083]  They get raised by mainstream media.
[03:44:49.083 --> 03:44:50.424]  They get raised by television.
[03:44:50.424 --> 03:44:52.025]  Now they're getting raised by Twitter.
[03:44:52.025 --> 03:44:56.988]  They're getting raised by, and essentially raised by the government and these elites that are out there pushing narratives to
[03:44:57.751 --> 03:45:08.101]  Get you them away from traditional values to get them away from supporting their country supporting patriotism and really just kind of give them this candy to give them this kind of fluff that they go along with whatever's going on.
[03:45:08.101 --> 03:45:13.506]  Oh, as long as I can get my app and my you know, the next Snapchat filter than everything's fine with my life.
[03:45:13.506 --> 03:45:16.850]  They make you want to want that stuff and not want the real.
[03:45:17.531 --> 03:45:27.793]  Joyfulness and abundance of life that's out there, they make you, it's sick the way they twist everything around and try to set up these false goals, these false idols for you to fall victim to.
[03:45:28.741 --> 03:45:34.585]  Yeah, that is why when I tell people, I said, the power elite want to enslave your children.
[03:45:34.585 --> 03:45:35.806]  And people go, oh, that's crazy.
[03:45:35.806 --> 03:45:47.235]  And I go, well, look what happened in Haiti, which state departments, again, I talked to Alex in the last segment, now confirmed the reporting from Infowars, which is that pedophiles were going to Haiti to adopt people.
[03:45:47.235 --> 03:45:51.198]  As we know, the Saudis, they really love black slaves in Saudi Arabia.
[03:45:51.198 --> 03:45:54.240]  And in Libya, a lot of slaves are ending up over there.
[03:45:54.240 --> 03:45:56.902]  And of course, the Clinton Foundation was taking money from the Saudis.
[03:45:57.302 --> 03:46:02.706]  And the Clinton Foundation was active in Haiti, and of course, the Haitians hate the Clinton Foundation.
[03:46:02.706 --> 03:46:04.667]  But that's, I guess, kind of a side.
[03:46:04.667 --> 03:46:18.295]  I guess to talk to you a little bit about sourcing is a couple articles came out today, which is about how apparently leakers are leaking media information, like The Hill wrote up a big article about how I'm getting a lot of leaks and exclusives, and you are too.
[03:46:18.295 --> 03:46:23.579]  But here's my question for you is, why is it that when you and I break news,
[03:46:24.551 --> 03:46:27.272]  They don't talk about the news that we broke.
[03:46:27.272 --> 03:46:30.074]  They want to talk about how did we get that story.
[03:46:30.074 --> 03:46:32.055]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:46:32.055 --> 03:46:37.598]  Well, it's interesting because they want us to give up our sources and methods because they want to steal our sources and methods.
[03:46:37.598 --> 03:46:38.838]  It's pretty simple.
[03:46:38.838 --> 03:46:47.703]  They don't want to talk about the news because they don't want to give us credit, number one, because that would legitimize us in the eyes of their press and make our audiences, our platforms bigger.
[03:46:47.703 --> 03:46:53.486]  And then number two is they want to find out, number one, how we got our sources to see if they can steal or co-opt them.
[03:46:53.843 --> 03:47:00.566]  Or in some cases, like we saw with Seth Rich, they were able to get to Seth Rich before he was able to keep himself safe.
[03:47:00.566 --> 03:47:10.049]  Fortunately, he had set up a dead drop on the emails, which eventually got to WikiLeaks, but they got rid of Seth Rich before he could leak more, before he could corroborate what was in those leaks.
[03:47:10.049 --> 03:47:11.430]  And so that's exactly what it is.
[03:47:11.430 --> 03:47:12.650]  They want to stop the leaks.
[03:47:12.650 --> 03:47:14.311]  They want to stop this truth from getting out.
[03:47:15.704 --> 03:47:16.525]  Exactly right.
[03:47:16.525 --> 03:47:25.252]  It's interesting you say that because when I meet with sources in Washington, D.C., I don't even bring my main cell phone because they can geolocate it.
[03:47:25.252 --> 03:47:30.176]  I bring a special burner cell phone that hasn't been geotargeted to me yet.
[03:47:30.176 --> 03:47:33.719]  So I leave actually this in my hotel or wherever I'm staying.
[03:47:34.019 --> 03:47:36.039]  So that I can't be geotargeted.
[03:47:36.039 --> 03:47:37.360]  Burn cell phones.
[03:47:37.360 --> 03:47:39.100]  You have to go meet in public places.
[03:47:39.100 --> 03:47:39.900]  Hooded sweatshirt.
[03:47:39.900 --> 03:47:41.041]  Sunglasses.
[03:47:41.041 --> 03:47:45.321]  Because that is how my sources know they could be murdered at any time.
[03:47:45.321 --> 03:47:47.362]  And they know that I could be murdered at any time.
[03:47:47.362 --> 03:47:52.203]  So the kind of OPSEC that we do is really cloak and dagger kind of stuff.
[03:47:52.203 --> 03:47:54.323]  And I'm sure that your OPSEC is similar.
[03:47:54.323 --> 03:48:01.725]  So maybe for those people listening at home, maybe they don't understand how afraid people are to talk to us because they know they might end up like Seth Rich.
[03:48:03.104 --> 03:48:15.413]  Yeah, there's people that have reached out to me that have said, you know, I almost have at this point a separate app, encrypted app and an encryption for each source that I talk to just because nobody wants to even be on the same app.
[03:48:15.413 --> 03:48:18.696]  They want to use these really obscure things that people don't know about.
[03:48:18.696 --> 03:48:24.280]  People know about, you know, what is it, Signal, they know about Wicker, those things, people are looking for that.
[03:48:24.636 --> 03:48:26.837]  These guys, they always want to stay a step ahead.
[03:48:26.837 --> 03:48:27.438]  Two steps ahead.
[03:48:27.438 --> 03:48:28.398]  Three steps ahead.
[03:48:28.398 --> 03:48:33.221]  And if anything's on there, they want to delete it before it becomes absolutely possible to be seen.
[03:48:33.221 --> 03:48:35.182]  Because they know that if your phone, right?
[03:48:35.182 --> 03:48:42.627]  We now learned that iPhone from the Fall 7 leaks, that with a zero hour default, they can crack your phone.
[03:48:42.627 --> 03:48:44.068]  So it doesn't matter if it's encrypted.
[03:48:44.068 --> 03:48:46.029]  They're reading it right from your operating system.
[03:48:46.029 --> 03:48:47.810]  That's why you've got to meet in person.
[03:48:47.810 --> 03:48:52.693]  That's why you've got to do stuff like, you know, go to a city, rent a car, pay cash for stuff.
[03:48:53.013 --> 03:48:53.594]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:49:14.312 --> 03:49:15.814]  I have 50 cell phones.
[03:49:15.814 --> 03:49:20.837]  I have over 50 cell phones that I only use one time for a source and then we throw them away.
[03:49:20.837 --> 03:49:24.480]  And then another thing that you do is, I don't want to reveal too much of my OpSec for people.
[03:49:24.480 --> 03:49:27.241]  So I don't want to give them too much tradecraft.
[03:49:27.241 --> 03:49:33.526]  But a lot of times what you do is you post information on a cell phone, you'll walk, you'll drop it at a coffee shop.
[03:49:33.526 --> 03:49:38.329]  And then an hour later, the person will walk by, pick up the phone and drop off another phone.
[03:49:38.329 --> 03:49:39.370]  And that's how you communicate.
[03:49:40.011 --> 03:49:44.539]  The reason I'm bringing that up, even though that's a trade secret, that's tradecraft I learned.
[03:49:44.539 --> 03:49:50.870]  Remember when Hillary Clinton lost an iPad in a very important meeting as a State Department person?
[03:49:50.870 --> 03:49:51.211]  Right?
[03:49:51.211 --> 03:49:52.793]  That came out in the investigation.
[03:49:53.627 --> 03:49:55.629]  That she would lose iPads.
[03:49:55.629 --> 03:49:58.272]  Well, that was actually, it's called a dead drop.
[03:49:58.272 --> 03:49:59.993]  Hillary Clinton was doing a dead drop.
[03:49:59.993 --> 03:50:06.440]  So she would load classified information on an iPad, go into a meeting, and then she would forget it.
[03:50:06.440 --> 03:50:13.006]  And that is how the Clintons spread top secret information and secrets to all of these hostile, here we go, we got it on screen.
[03:50:13.006 --> 03:50:15.309]  She used iPads, claimed she only used one device.
[03:50:15.309 --> 03:50:16.390]  Yeah, but she would lose them.
[03:50:17.122 --> 03:50:19.123]  So remember they lost a bunch of devices.
[03:50:19.123 --> 03:50:21.023]  Oh, we couldn't find seven blackberries.
[03:50:21.023 --> 03:50:24.304]  But there were some donors involved with that as well, too.
[03:50:24.304 --> 03:50:25.824]  Clinton Foundation donors.
[03:50:25.824 --> 03:50:26.064]  Right.
[03:50:26.064 --> 03:50:30.726]  So what we do is we use dead drops for operational security.
[03:50:30.726 --> 03:50:32.886]  She would do it to actually spread information.
[03:50:32.886 --> 03:50:33.906]  Thanks for coming on, Jack.
[03:50:33.906 --> 03:50:36.347]  Before we go, I want to remind people that Survivor Shield.
[03:50:37.330 --> 03:50:39.292]  It's about to go on sale.
[03:50:39.292 --> 03:50:40.313]  It was out of stock.
[03:50:40.313 --> 03:50:41.855]  It's going to sell out again really soon.
[03:50:41.855 --> 03:50:44.217]  Go to Infowarslife.com.
[03:50:44.217 --> 03:50:47.180]  They actually have a major, major supply issue.
[03:50:47.180 --> 03:50:51.003]  As you know, when they sell out, they sell out.
[03:50:51.003 --> 03:50:53.906]  Iodine is one of the most essential nutrients in the world.
[03:50:53.906 --> 03:50:58.611]  And in fact, in developing countries, the IQ problems arise from low iodine.
[03:50:59.983 --> 03:51:03.444]  This is Elizabeth McCabe, aka Lucky One, of Truth Frequency News.
[03:51:03.444 --> 03:51:06.445]  I wanted to tell you all about Extend-A-Vite from HeartDrop.com.
[03:51:06.445 --> 03:51:08.746]  Y'all know I check everything before I air it.
[03:51:08.746 --> 03:51:13.167]  When I heard about Extend-A-Vite on TFR, I went to HeartDrop.com and started my research.
[03:51:13.167 --> 03:51:14.387]  It's got cayenne.
[03:51:14.387 --> 03:51:15.787]  That's good for blood and circulation.
[03:51:15.787 --> 03:51:17.208]  It stimulates the blood flow.
[03:51:17.208 --> 03:51:22.289]  It's got garlic, which fights bacteria like antibiotics, and it blowers up cholesterol and blood pressure.
[03:51:22.289 --> 03:51:25.270]  It also has milk thistle, which is the best detox for liver.
[03:51:25.270 --> 03:51:27.891]  I couldn't wait to try it out, and I'm glad I did four months ago.
[03:51:28.171 --> 03:51:29.713]  And here's Alfie's results.
[03:51:29.713 --> 03:51:31.234]  My hands and feet don't get cold anymore.
[03:51:31.234 --> 03:51:33.616]  The varicose veins have faded too.
[03:51:33.616 --> 03:51:35.638]  My wrists don't hurt after typing all day.
[03:51:35.638 --> 03:51:38.781]  Now I tell you all this because it's true and I want you to really live life.

[03:52:01.687 --> 03:52:02.969]  Deben in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:52:03.979 --> 03:52:04.459]  Great!
[03:52:04.459 --> 03:52:05.580]  Hey, thank you so much.

[03:52:22.994 --> 03:52:24.575]  Which nutraceutical do you like best?
[03:52:24.815 --> 03:52:28.396]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[03:52:28.396 --> 03:52:28.696]  That's amazing.
[03:52:28.696 --> 03:52:29.696]  That's really incredible.
[03:52:29.696 --> 03:52:32.817]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:52:32.817 --> 03:52:34.218]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[03:52:34.218 --> 03:52:35.918]  My morning was fantastic.
[03:52:35.918 --> 03:52:37.118]  And I love you guys.
[03:52:37.118 --> 03:52:39.419]  I love the Info Wars crew.

[03:54:12.503 --> 03:54:15.665]  Michael Cervage guest hosting for Alex Jones.
[03:54:15.665 --> 03:54:17.927]  This is our final segment.
[03:54:17.927 --> 03:54:22.449]  So you can learn more about me at Twitter at C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H.
[03:54:22.449 --> 03:54:29.313]  So we're going to end this with some just exciting news about the Comey is gone and what this means.
[03:54:29.313 --> 03:54:29.974]  Okay.
[03:54:29.974 --> 03:54:33.876]  There's another story that broke on Newsweek, which is actually reliable on McCabe.
[03:54:34.580 --> 03:54:44.759]  So Comey was of course an agent of the deep state and he had protected Obama, UMA, Anthony Weiner, the Clintons, Loretta, the whole team.
[03:54:44.759 --> 03:54:45.380]  Susan Rice?
[03:54:46.266 --> 03:54:54.588]  I've gotten information now that Susan Rice's lawyers have actually reached out to the FBI and they want to get immunity for Susan Rice.
[03:54:54.588 --> 03:54:55.849]  This is breaking news actually.
[03:54:55.849 --> 03:55:04.772]  I just actually got this information here during the break that Susan Rice's lawyers are reaching out to the FBI because she is terrified.
[03:55:04.772 --> 03:55:13.014]  So a lot of you at home, myself included, were told by the fake news media that Susan Rice did not unmask anyone.
[03:55:13.607 --> 03:55:16.390]  And then of course it was revealed that she did unmask people.
[03:55:16.390 --> 03:55:25.999]  She had actually unmasked me, Alex Jones, Sean Hannity, any person who they viewed in the media as having a big impact and who was pro-Trump.
[03:55:25.999 --> 03:55:29.002]  They went after us hard and they spied on us illegally and criminally.
[03:55:29.002 --> 03:55:32.825]  So Susan Rice claimed that she would testify before the Senate.
[03:55:32.825 --> 03:55:35.448]  Then her lawyer sent a letter saying she wasn't going to testify.
[03:55:36.522 --> 03:55:38.823]  She thought she was safe.
[03:55:38.823 --> 03:55:43.545]  And with Comey in at the FBI and with McCabe in at the FBI, she is safe.
[03:55:43.545 --> 03:55:45.326]  But now Comey's out.
[03:55:45.326 --> 03:55:51.409]  Susan Rice is very, very nervous because what she did was multiple felonies, very big problems.
[03:55:51.409 --> 03:55:58.272]  It's the biggest spying scandal probably since the original WikiLeaks and maybe even since Vault 7.
[03:55:58.272 --> 03:56:01.833]  So her lawyers have reached out to the FBI and they want to make a deal.
[03:56:01.833 --> 03:56:02.994]  They're scrambling.
[03:56:03.914 --> 03:56:05.436]  They are shook, right?
[03:56:05.436 --> 03:56:09.160]  So the House Intel panel wanted Susan Rice to testify.
[03:56:09.160 --> 03:56:11.703]  She said she was going to.
[03:56:11.703 --> 03:56:16.027]  But then her lawyer sent a letter and said, no, she's not going to testify now.
[03:56:16.027 --> 03:56:21.593]  But now that story has developed even more, where her lawyers have reached out to the FBI.
[03:56:21.593 --> 03:56:23.816]  They want to get immunity from her.
[03:56:24.614 --> 03:56:29.035]  Because she knows now with Comey out of there, she could end up in prison.
[03:56:29.035 --> 03:56:31.316]  Spying Susan Rice is what we call her.
[03:56:31.316 --> 03:56:36.377]  We call her spying Susan Rice because she spied on everybody in journalism.
[03:56:36.377 --> 03:56:37.357]  On the right.
[03:56:37.357 --> 03:56:42.638]  Of course, she didn't spy on Maggie Haberman, Glenn Thrush, the New York Times, the Washington Post.
[03:56:42.638 --> 03:56:45.799]  The media is all saying, oh, no big deal.
[03:56:45.799 --> 03:56:46.859]  No big deal.
[03:56:46.859 --> 03:56:49.240]  But could you imagine if it had been revealed
[03:56:50.330 --> 03:56:51.490]  That Democrats would spy on.
[03:56:51.490 --> 03:56:53.491]  Because think about this one for a minute.
[03:56:53.491 --> 03:56:57.452]  The WikiLeaks, apparently they're the bad guys, right?
[03:56:57.452 --> 03:57:02.293]  Even though they're not the government for revealing truthful information to the American people.
[03:57:02.293 --> 03:57:07.414]  Susan Rice had a job to uphold the Constitution, right?
[03:57:07.414 --> 03:57:09.955]  She was a sworn officer of the law.
[03:57:09.955 --> 03:57:14.296]  Her job, her oath was to all of us, even people she doesn't agree with.
[03:57:14.296 --> 03:57:15.896]  Maybe Susan Rice doesn't like me.
[03:57:15.896 --> 03:57:17.377]  Maybe she doesn't like Alex Jones.
[03:57:17.377 --> 03:57:18.737]  Maybe she didn't like Sean Hannity.
[03:57:19.400 --> 03:57:21.363]  Maybe she didn't like wrestling ball.
[03:57:21.363 --> 03:57:22.725]  She was not allowed to spy on us.
[03:57:22.725 --> 03:57:26.891]  That's ethical, wrong, morally wrong, legally wrong.
[03:57:27.657 --> 03:57:29.438]  She broke her oath of office.
[03:57:29.438 --> 03:57:30.978]  She broke the law.
[03:57:30.978 --> 03:57:32.839]  And the media is saying, no big deal.
[03:57:32.839 --> 03:57:34.179]  Why do you care, Cernovich?
[03:57:34.179 --> 03:57:37.140]  That was incidental collection, right?
[03:57:37.140 --> 03:57:39.021]  Watch how that narrative spun.
[03:57:39.021 --> 03:57:45.603]  The timeline of Susan Rice's spying scandal, which I wrote up on my medium.com forward slash at Cernovich.
[03:57:45.603 --> 03:57:47.764]  The timeline of that is amazing.
[03:57:47.764 --> 03:57:51.005]  First, Susan Rice said, hey, I didn't spy on anybody.
[03:57:51.005 --> 03:57:52.045]  I didn't unmask anybody.
[03:57:52.904 --> 03:57:58.371]  And then I broke the story that she had and then Eli Lake of Bloomberg confirmed my reporting.
[03:57:58.371 --> 03:58:01.114]  And then the media forgot that she lied to them.
[03:58:01.114 --> 03:58:06.180]  And then suddenly the story became, hey, that was incidental.
[03:58:06.180 --> 03:58:06.800]  No big deal.
[03:58:06.800 --> 03:58:07.201]  Oh, wow.
[03:58:07.201 --> 03:58:08.002]  We are closing out.
[03:58:08.002 --> 03:58:09.023]  We're going fast.
[03:58:09.023 --> 03:58:11.105]  Why do I have so much energy?
[03:58:11.105 --> 03:58:13.148]  Caveman is back in stock.
[03:58:13.763 --> 03:58:15.164]  You need the collagen.
[03:58:15.164 --> 03:58:16.285]  You need the nutrients.
[03:58:16.285 --> 03:58:18.907]  How can you run hard like me all the time?
[03:58:18.907 --> 03:58:20.669]  You have to enhance yourself.
[03:58:20.669 --> 03:58:22.210]  You have to be enhanced.
[03:58:22.210 --> 03:58:27.955]  You can't just live with, eat the normal food and expect to have the nutrients as a superpower in life.
[03:58:27.955 --> 03:58:34.460]  To have the kind of passion, energy, enthusiasm every day to go hard like we all go by, right?
[03:58:34.460 --> 03:58:37.262]  Because we're giving our bodies the nutrients it needs.
[03:58:37.262 --> 03:58:38.843]  So Caveman is back in stock.
[03:58:38.843 --> 03:58:39.604]  It was out of stock.
[03:58:39.604 --> 03:58:40.425]  I'll talk to you all soon.
[03:58:42.301 --> 03:58:46.288]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
