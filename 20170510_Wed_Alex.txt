[00:00.000 --> 00:18.120]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:18.120 --> 00:20.640]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20.640 --> 00:24.080]  I see your hair is burning.
[00:24.080 --> 00:29.440]  Obviously, I hate to tell folks, even the general area where we get our information
[00:29.440 --> 00:33.120]  from concerning the White House, because the media has a big field day where it then
[00:33.120 --> 00:37.480]  tries to shut off the sources, but I was on the phone very late last night talking to
[00:37.480 --> 00:42.440]  multiple sources, and then I called Roger Stone about 11, Texas time, midnight, his
[00:42.440 --> 00:47.880]  time, we talked for over an hour, and he confirmed a lot of what I was learning from
[00:47.880 --> 00:48.880]  other sources.
[00:48.880 --> 00:55.040]  And of course, Roger's one of the only people now that Trump still routinely talks to outside
[00:55.040 --> 00:56.040]  of the White House.
[00:56.040 --> 01:02.120]  Now, I don't know how much Roger will get into today, but I from my other sources separately
[01:02.120 --> 01:05.840]  have exactly what happened with Comey.
[01:05.840 --> 01:16.280]  Comey was compromised, and had been compromised for a long time, and was being clearly manipulated
[01:16.280 --> 01:23.240]  by deep state sources to try to exert pressure onto the White House to have the White House
[01:23.240 --> 01:28.840]  carry out the deep state's political aims with this whole fake Russian narrative that
[01:28.840 --> 01:34.720]  if they didn't basically do what John McCain and others wanted, they would continue on
[01:34.720 --> 01:37.240]  with hearings and try to impeach the president.
[01:37.240 --> 01:40.680]  So they're blackmailing the president with this fake Russian narrative.
[01:40.680 --> 01:42.280]  Senator Rand Paul obviously knows all about this.
[01:42.280 --> 01:47.000]  He's come out and said that's basically what it is as well, had good riddance to Comey.
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.400]  Comey ignored crimes that were ultra massive, and he followed the orders of the Attorney
[01:52.400 --> 01:55.600]  General who was so corrupt, she would sit there and you'll meet on airplanes with Bill
[01:55.600 --> 02:01.920]  Clinton on the tarmac while he was under criminal investigation by her agency, Loretta Lynch.
[02:01.920 --> 02:02.920]  That's one area.
[02:02.920 --> 02:13.240]  But it's also the fact that Comey is seen as weak, and as very, very manipulative, but
[02:13.240 --> 02:16.080]  in a candy-ass way.
[02:16.080 --> 02:19.440]  Lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy.
[02:19.440 --> 02:20.440]  I didn't know.
[02:20.440 --> 02:23.480]  Well, my goodness, I had two doors I could go down.
[02:23.480 --> 02:26.720]  I had one door that was cover up, and I had another door that was getting involved in
[02:26.720 --> 02:32.200]  the politics, and lordy, lordy.
[02:32.200 --> 02:36.800]  Comey has the FBI standing in the way of prosecuting the Clintons for being on the Russian payroll,
[02:36.800 --> 02:40.160]  being on the Chinese payroll 50 times what the Russians were.
[02:40.160 --> 02:44.360]  I mean, it's the Chinese that are up our, you know what?
[02:44.360 --> 02:48.400]  I mean, it's the Chinese that are almost in control of this country in many respects.
[02:48.400 --> 02:53.160]  I mean, we are in deep trouble as a sovereign nation.
[02:53.160 --> 02:56.240]  There's major geopolitical jockeying going on right now.
[02:56.240 --> 02:59.640]  That's why Henry Kissinger is at the White House today.
[02:59.640 --> 03:04.520]  Henry Kissinger, codenamed Bohr, was in Army Intelligence throughout World War II, helped
[03:04.520 --> 03:08.200]  set up the Bilderberg Group, everything.
[03:08.200 --> 03:10.400]  And he was a double agent to the Russians.
[03:10.400 --> 03:13.840]  That's come out in congressional testimony, and he's one of the main advisors of Vladimir
[03:13.840 --> 03:14.840]  Putin.
[03:14.840 --> 03:18.920]  And that's major back-channel deals going on, and I'm not saying that he is a Russian
[03:18.920 --> 03:19.920]  agent.
[03:19.920 --> 03:25.920]  He was a Russian double-triple agent back in World War II and afterwards, but really he's
[03:25.920 --> 03:28.840]  an agent of the globalist.
[03:28.840 --> 03:32.120]  And so there's major power jockeying.
[03:32.120 --> 03:38.600]  I've told the president this myself in person, and I've said it here on the broadcast a hundred
[03:38.600 --> 03:43.600]  times at least, and I'm going to say it again when we come back, and Roger Stone joins us.
[03:43.600 --> 03:44.880]  We're not looking for trouble.
[03:44.880 --> 03:46.200]  We're not looking for revolution.
[03:46.200 --> 03:48.440]  We're not looking for bloodbaths.
[03:48.440 --> 03:54.280]  The globalists and their leftist hordes and their repugies are here to destabilize the
[03:54.280 --> 03:58.480]  West and are trying to push a narrative of violence and overthrow and kill the police
[03:58.480 --> 04:04.040]  and war in the streets and all this garbage, and we are involved in dereliction of duty
[04:04.040 --> 04:07.360]  if we don't do something about it.
[04:07.360 --> 04:13.200]  Now they're saying Trump took a gamble by firing Comey.
[04:13.200 --> 04:16.040]  The Democrats wanted him fired three months ago.
[04:16.040 --> 04:23.960]  Now they wake up on the other side of the bed and suddenly they love Comey.
[04:23.960 --> 04:25.840]  Trump has to drop the hammer on him.
[04:25.840 --> 04:31.560]  His attorney general has to start the moves for the indictments right now.
[04:31.560 --> 04:35.720]  So that's what needs to happen right now, and then Trump will be the superstar president
[04:35.720 --> 04:37.520]  we need who restores the republic.
[04:37.520 --> 04:40.160]  He's already doing economically and militarily.
[04:40.160 --> 04:41.640]  Obviously, he's an American president.
[04:41.640 --> 04:43.000]  We haven't had that in a while.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.880]  Say what you want about it, and that's why the elites were pissed because we've actually
[04:45.880 --> 04:49.720]  got some money in there that really does care about the interests of this country.
[04:49.720 --> 04:53.400]  All the special entrants that have been raping us forever are now freaking out realizing
[04:53.400 --> 04:54.720]  there's a new sheriff in town.
[04:54.720 --> 04:55.720]  I'm Alex Jones.
[04:55.720 --> 05:06.720]  Thanks for joining us with us last week info wars.com published the article bombshell study proves unvaccinated children are healthier than vaccinated children.
[05:06.720 --> 05:10.960]  The two studies were pulled from the Journal of Transitional Science without any explanation.
[05:10.960 --> 05:16.320]  The studies surveyed parents of 666 homeschooled children, 39% who were not vaccinated.
[05:16.320 --> 05:20.280]  When asked about allergies, 22% of vaccinated children were shown to have allergies while
[05:20.280 --> 05:26.960]  only 6.9% were unvaccinated autism 4.7% were vaccinated versus 1% unvaccinated.
[05:26.960 --> 05:30.040]  So of course, there's going to be pushback when a study like this comes out proving that
[05:30.040 --> 05:31.800]  vaccines are not really safe.
[05:31.800 --> 05:34.960]  And people are going to come out and attack it and say, oh, they just talked to parents
[05:34.960 --> 05:37.320]  or they'll say, oh, there was a bias in the study.
[05:37.320 --> 05:39.360]  These people think vaccines are unsafe.
[05:39.360 --> 05:43.400]  One, the study proves they're unsafe and to any other vaccine study is done and paid
[05:43.400 --> 05:45.320]  for by the pharmaceutical companies.
[05:45.320 --> 05:47.320]  Of course, they think vaccines are safe.
[05:47.320 --> 05:51.000]  But go to our article bombshell study proves unvaccinated children are healthier.
[05:51.000 --> 05:54.840]  We have archived links to the studies and you can see for yourself because drug companies
[05:54.840 --> 05:56.760]  will do anything to keep you from the truth.

[08:16.200 --> 08:22.800]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide.
[08:22.800 --> 08:29.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:29.240 --> 08:34.000]  Wednesday, May 10th, 2017.
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[08:36.000 --> 08:37.560]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[08:37.560 --> 08:43.040]  Well, President Trump, 45, told Comey, the incredibly political, globalist operative
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.160]  that have been protecting the Clintons for many years, he told him, you're fired.
[08:48.160 --> 08:50.480]  And there went Comey.
[08:50.480 --> 08:52.880]  And now the Democrats are acting like it is the end of the world.
[08:52.880 --> 08:54.280]  They're saying it's an exonium.
[08:54.280 --> 08:58.040]  We've got to impeach President Trump when they're the ones just three months ago calling
[08:58.040 --> 08:59.080]  for him to be fired.
[08:59.080 --> 09:06.160]  Look at some of these headlines from drudgerport.com, Rand Paul says, good riddance.
[09:06.160 --> 09:08.520]  Kerbin calls it a grave constitutional issue.
[09:08.520 --> 09:11.960]  McCain, more shoes to drop.
[09:11.960 --> 09:13.600]  Sometimes one emergency hearings.
[09:13.600 --> 09:15.800]  Chaos, turmoil, agents crying.
[09:15.800 --> 09:17.160]  Put a load of bull.
[09:17.160 --> 09:21.640]  Most of the agents have been confirmed, absolutely cannot stand Comey.
[09:21.640 --> 09:22.640]  All the big scandals.
[09:22.640 --> 09:27.520]  Well, the media and Congress is saying basically in the White House is saying he didn't know
[09:27.520 --> 09:29.600]  the chain of command and did whatever he wanted to.
[09:29.600 --> 09:33.120]  And now they're saying Comey sought more money for Russian probe days before he was fired,
[09:33.120 --> 09:34.120]  officials say.
[09:34.120 --> 09:35.120]  Washington Post.
[09:35.120 --> 09:36.840]  They were meeting last week.
[09:36.840 --> 09:40.040]  Why aren't you looking at the uranium deals in Hillary and the Podestas?
[09:40.040 --> 09:42.280]  Why aren't you looking at her meeting secretly with Putin?
[09:42.280 --> 09:46.840]  Why aren't you involved with her in communist China or the OP M hack?
[09:46.840 --> 09:52.120]  Why is it all General Flynn went and got paid to go on RT television and he had gigs with
[09:52.120 --> 09:55.960]  the Germans and the British and the Turks, everybody else, you know, when he was in a
[09:55.960 --> 09:58.400]  private citizen.
[09:58.400 --> 10:00.720]  That's the big bottom of the rabbit hole here.
[10:00.720 --> 10:04.520]  So joining us from the airport flying to New York to be on the Today Show tomorrow in
[10:04.520 --> 10:07.360]  two days is big Netflix show.
[10:07.360 --> 10:10.960]  Get me Roger Stone that yours truly is also in this set to premiere.
[10:10.960 --> 10:15.480]  It's got amazing ratings from the critics that have already seen it.
[10:15.480 --> 10:18.520]  So I look forward to seeing that, obviously, Netflix, get me Roger Stone.
[10:18.520 --> 10:22.400]  The notorious OP operative plays both narrator and villain.
[10:22.400 --> 10:24.300]  So get me Roger Stone.
[10:24.300 --> 10:28.560]  That is coming up in T minus 48 hours on Netflix.
[10:28.560 --> 10:31.600]  But going to Roger Stone has got a Fox News crew and a bunch of the crews following me
[10:31.600 --> 10:36.400]  around at the airport, giving us the first exclusive today on exactly what is breaking
[10:36.400 --> 10:38.440]  down and happening with Comey.
[10:38.440 --> 10:42.080]  Roger, let's let's go over from your sources.
[10:42.080 --> 10:45.880]  Well, some interesting contra-tems today.
[10:45.880 --> 10:54.480]  Alex Politico published a story which claimed that I had persuaded the president to fire
[10:54.480 --> 10:55.920]  James Comey.
[10:55.920 --> 11:01.280]  CNN picked that story up from Politico.
[11:01.280 --> 11:06.360]  I am not the source of that story, nor have I claimed anything of the kind, because as
[11:06.360 --> 11:11.800]  I have said on this show many times, no one talks Donald Trump into anything.
[11:11.800 --> 11:16.240]  He's not some mannequin that you hand talking points to.
[11:16.240 --> 11:23.760]  And I have always declined to discuss the content or frequency of my conversations with
[11:23.760 --> 11:24.760]  the president.
[11:24.760 --> 11:27.160]  Sure, I know, but you have, when we talk about this for an hour or less, I get where
[11:27.160 --> 11:28.440]  you can go or you can't.
[11:28.440 --> 11:31.680]  The point is, is I have my sources, I called you, I checked out what they told me, you
[11:31.680 --> 11:34.720]  said that was pretty much dead on, you want to get into any conversations you've had.
[11:34.720 --> 11:38.800]  But it is in the newspapers today that you are the source of the person that finally
[11:38.800 --> 11:40.840]  got the president to drop the hammer last week.
[11:40.840 --> 11:44.640]  Now, obviously you're not taking credit for that, he is his own person, but I guess you
[11:44.640 --> 11:46.080]  can't speak to those reports.
[11:46.080 --> 11:52.000]  Well, I'm not, specifically I'm not the source of those reports, nor did I confirm them.
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.200]  But Alex, I have spoken about this, I have talked about it.
[11:55.200 --> 12:01.520]  I've been calling for Mr. Comey's firing now for months.
[12:01.520 --> 12:08.440]  And beyond that, the idea that I somehow persuaded the president is just not true.
[12:08.440 --> 12:13.120]  Now, as you know, any advice you do give the president, you're best to keep to yourself.
[12:13.120 --> 12:17.600]  President has to have an expectation of confidentiality.
[12:17.600 --> 12:23.600]  So the president tweeted fake news, you know, Roger Stone did not talk me into firing Comey.
[12:23.600 --> 12:25.400]  Well, that's true, I did not.
[12:25.400 --> 12:28.280]  And I never said I did, nor did I ever claim that.
[12:28.280 --> 12:31.120]  That's right, it's the media just going with this.
[12:31.120 --> 12:35.160]  Yeah, you know, CNN picked it up from Politico.
[12:35.160 --> 12:40.000]  I didn't confirm it for Politico, I didn't confirm it for CNN.
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.640]  I'm not going to talk about any conversation I may or may not have had with the president.
[12:44.640 --> 12:48.280]  That's always been my policy, even here at Infowars.
[12:48.280 --> 12:49.280]  Certainly.
[12:49.280 --> 12:50.280]  Now.
[12:50.280 --> 12:56.280]  But that said, the president's made a bold and I think the correct decision.
[12:56.280 --> 13:00.280]  Comey had no interest in the mega crimes by the Clintons.
[13:00.280 --> 13:04.680]  The Clinton Foundation is not a charity, it's a slush fund for grifters.
[13:04.680 --> 13:11.360]  And as we both know, it was the vehicle for the facilitation of multi-million-dollar bribes.
[13:11.360 --> 13:16.200]  It matters not just uranium, but across the board.
[13:16.200 --> 13:22.240]  Yet, Mr. Comey seemed to have no interest in those crimes, wasting his time investigating
[13:22.240 --> 13:25.360]  the non-existent Russian collusion.
[13:25.360 --> 13:32.000]  Again, there is no evidence whatsoever that would hold up in a court of law of any collusion
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.680]  between the Russian and officials in the Trump campaign.
[13:35.680 --> 13:36.680]  It's a canard.
[13:36.680 --> 13:39.080]  Sure, and Senator Paul has come out.
[13:39.080 --> 13:42.000]  Senator Paul has seen the intelligences come out and said that's the case as well.
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.800]  They admit there's nothing there.
[13:43.800 --> 13:47.880]  But from my sources, and what I was told, and then I called you last night and you said,
[13:47.880 --> 13:51.040]  well, you've talked to some of your sources and that seemed to be right on target, it
[13:51.040 --> 13:57.040]  was that Comey was violating the chain of command, was seen as reckless, weird, constantly
[13:57.040 --> 14:04.040]  changing positions, and that he was just seen as overall kind of soft.
[14:04.040 --> 14:10.240]  And that that's why the attorney general recommended he be removed.
[14:10.240 --> 14:16.640]  My sources said the exact same thing that your sources said, that's 100% accurate.
[14:16.640 --> 14:18.920]  He seemed to be empire building.
[14:18.920 --> 14:23.240]  He didn't seem to be responsive to the Congress or the executive branch.
[14:23.240 --> 14:28.760]  He seemed to believe he was a power unto himself with his own agenda.
[14:28.760 --> 14:33.720]  Only days ago, saying, well, you're stuck with me for six years, well, not so fast.
[14:33.720 --> 14:38.520]  And by the way, you noticed that he said he thought it was a joke when he first heard
[14:38.520 --> 14:43.240]  the news yesterday, totally disconnected from reality.
[14:43.240 --> 14:49.240]  The key thing I think is that I 100% support the president's decision that had nothing
[14:49.240 --> 14:54.280]  to do with heading off a Russian investigation.
[14:54.280 --> 15:01.680]  Senators Warner, Weinstein, Franken, Congressman Schiff, Spire, Himes, they have nothing, Alex.
[15:01.680 --> 15:02.680]  Nothing.
[15:02.680 --> 15:03.680]  They're holding it in their hands.
[15:03.680 --> 15:05.680]  They got nothing.
[15:05.680 --> 15:11.320]  It's a bogus and they're about to be humiliated if they continue down this path.
[15:11.320 --> 15:16.760]  The idea that this is like Richard Nixon in the Saturday Night Massacre is false for several
[15:16.760 --> 15:17.760]  reasons.
[15:17.760 --> 15:21.920]  First of all, Watergate had been in full bore for 18 months.
[15:21.920 --> 15:31.360]  Archibald Cox was specifically investigating Richard Nixon himself when Nixon fired Cox,
[15:31.360 --> 15:33.320]  making him a Cox Sacker.
[15:33.320 --> 15:38.120]  In any event, this situation is not analogous.
[15:38.120 --> 15:43.800]  There is no allegation that the president himself was involved in any Russian collusion.
[15:43.800 --> 15:45.360]  There's no evidence to that effect.
[15:45.360 --> 15:46.360]  Sure.
[15:46.360 --> 15:50.200]  Doesn't it take the wind out of their sails, Roger, that the Democrats just three months
[15:50.200 --> 15:52.120]  ago were calling for his sacking?
[15:52.120 --> 15:54.720]  Yeah, three months ago.
[15:54.720 --> 15:56.880]  How about a day ago?
[15:56.880 --> 15:59.680]  Hillary Clinton was whining about this two days ago.
[15:59.680 --> 16:03.920]  Hillary came out, as you saw, saying that Comey had cost her as the election.
[16:03.920 --> 16:06.120]  It was his fault and misogyny.
[16:06.120 --> 16:08.600]  Now she's saying it's horrible that he was fired.
[16:08.600 --> 16:12.320]  Well, first of all, she's right about the misogyny issue.
[16:12.320 --> 16:18.160]  Her husband's misogyny was definitely a major factor in her defeat.
[16:18.160 --> 16:19.160]  And let's give some credit.
[16:19.160 --> 16:20.800]  You helped engineer a lot of that.
[16:20.800 --> 16:26.600]  Well, I think I think a lot of Americans were unaware of the record because back in
[16:26.600 --> 16:33.440]  the 80s, when Infowars.com did not exist, no Breitbart, no Daily Caller, no alternative
[16:33.440 --> 16:39.800]  media, the three major networks conspired to cover up the rape of Juanita Broderick.
[16:39.800 --> 16:45.880]  The three major networks conspired to cover up multiple sexual assaults by Bill.
[16:45.880 --> 16:51.560]  But more importantly, they covered up Hillary's actions to bully and intimidate and threaten
[16:51.560 --> 16:52.560]  Bill's victims.
[16:52.560 --> 16:54.080]  Hillary is so entitled.
[16:54.080 --> 16:59.880]  You cannot be an advocate for women when you are, you know, terrorizing one.
[16:59.880 --> 17:02.640]  Now, let's get into the meat potatoes.
[17:02.640 --> 17:03.960]  This is the only habit at the bottom of the hour.
[17:03.960 --> 17:07.600]  You got to do a Fox interview right now.
[17:07.600 --> 17:08.880]  Where is all this going?
[17:08.880 --> 17:10.360]  Because they're saying it's a constitutional crisis.
[17:10.360 --> 17:13.840]  They're saying they want to have all these hearings like he's covering something up.
[17:13.840 --> 17:17.480]  Comey is running around doing whatever he wants to.
[17:17.480 --> 17:20.360]  And anybody that really actually studies it knows that.
[17:20.360 --> 17:24.640]  And we know, though, he wanted to expand the fake Russian investigation when we've all been
[17:24.640 --> 17:29.080]  saying lock Hillary up for her Russian connections, the uranium deals, the Chinese connections.
[17:29.080 --> 17:34.200]  I mean, it's so crazy that the Podestas, as you reported over a year ago, they knew that
[17:34.200 --> 17:35.520]  they were in deep with Russia.
[17:35.520 --> 17:39.480]  So they turned the whole narrative around and then still we're letting the tail wag the
[17:39.480 --> 17:40.480]  dog here.
[17:40.480 --> 17:41.480]  Roger.
[17:41.480 --> 17:42.480]  Classic disinformation.
[17:42.480 --> 17:50.160]  I must admit a brilliant strategy by Podesta blame Donald Trump for doing exactly what
[17:50.160 --> 17:56.240]  he himself and the Clintons are doing enriching themselves due to their ties with the oligarchs
[17:56.240 --> 17:58.760]  around Vladimir Putin.
[17:58.760 --> 18:01.400]  I'll tell you what really needs to happen now.
[18:01.400 --> 18:08.360]  And that is the majority, the Republican majority on the House and Senate Intelligence
[18:08.360 --> 18:10.720]  Committee need to grow a pair.
[18:10.720 --> 18:17.560]  Yes, we do need to investigate Susan Rice's misuse of surveillance material in violation
[18:17.560 --> 18:18.560]  of the law.
[18:18.560 --> 18:23.880]  I was about to say, now we know Obama and when she knew it, Obama ordered thousands
[18:23.880 --> 18:26.760]  of Americans in the election spot on for political control.
[18:26.760 --> 18:28.120]  That's all admitted now.
[18:28.120 --> 18:34.960]  Well, and in the hearing two days ago, we had James Clapper testifying Mr. Clapper lied
[18:34.960 --> 18:37.360]  to the Congress about your metadata.
[18:37.360 --> 18:41.360]  He should have been fired then and he should be a pariah today.
[18:41.360 --> 18:46.600]  Why would we believe anything he said after he got caught red handed, which, by the way,
[18:46.600 --> 18:53.440]  would not have happened if Edward Snowden had not stepped forward and exposed it.
[18:53.440 --> 18:58.720]  I want to look at the Republicans really on these two committees need to stop cowtowing
[18:58.720 --> 19:01.840]  to punks like Adam Schiff.
[19:01.840 --> 19:09.320]  And you know, I saw one story on Susan Rice's refusal to testify if Paul Manafort or Roger
[19:09.320 --> 19:15.280]  Stone or General Flynn refused to testify while, you know, all hell would break loose.
[19:15.280 --> 19:17.400]  It would be a constitutional crisis.
[19:17.400 --> 19:22.680]  It would shake the Republic to its foundation.
[19:22.680 --> 19:24.200]  This is nonsense.
[19:24.200 --> 19:27.280]  It's time to find out what Susan Rice did.
[19:27.280 --> 19:31.120]  It's time to find out what Obama knew and when he knew it.
[19:31.120 --> 19:35.120]  Now, Roger, in the 10 minutes we have left, let me walk through the waterfront here with
[19:35.120 --> 19:36.120]  you.
[19:36.120 --> 19:38.120]  Kissinger at the White House today.
[19:38.120 --> 19:44.080]  Obviously, he's a top advisor to Vladimir Putin, but that's okay because he's establishment.
[19:44.080 --> 19:46.600]  Of course, Russia and the United States are talking.
[19:46.600 --> 19:51.640]  So that's happening right now, right as Lavarov arrives and slaps down Andrea Mitchell yet
[19:51.640 --> 19:52.640]  again.
[19:52.640 --> 19:56.520]  And so there's a lot of power playing going on in D.C. right now.
[19:56.520 --> 20:01.120]  I've got some calls into my sources on that, but what's your intel on the major tectonic
[20:01.120 --> 20:04.720]  movements we see going on in D.C. geopolitically today?
[20:04.720 --> 20:10.720]  Well, Alex, I've known Henry Kissinger since 1969.
[20:10.720 --> 20:17.000]  He started out as a disciple to Fritz Kramer and the hardliners, and he ended up being
[20:17.000 --> 20:21.520]  an advocate for daytime with both the Russians and the Chinese.
[20:21.520 --> 20:27.480]  He's a skilled diplomat, and Donald Trump has decided to use Clinton to his advantage.
[20:27.480 --> 20:30.920]  Sure, you want somebody who knows Putin.
[20:30.920 --> 20:34.320]  What better way to have a back channel dialogue?
[20:34.320 --> 20:39.840]  Originally, the Democrats were criticizing Tillerson because he knows Putin.
[20:39.840 --> 20:44.520]  The president himself told me having somebody who knows Putin is a plus, not a minus.
[20:44.520 --> 20:49.280]  Yeah, that's what the executive branch is supposed to talk to the other leaders.
[20:49.280 --> 20:53.720]  How Congress is trying, the liberals are trying to paralyze the president where he can't act
[20:53.720 --> 20:55.720]  as the executive is treason.
[20:55.720 --> 21:01.520]  Well, I reported right here at info wars that Dr. Kissinger carried a private message
[21:01.520 --> 21:06.080]  from the president of the United States to the Chinese that was very well received.
[21:06.080 --> 21:11.000]  This was after the Chinese Premier visited Marlago.
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.680]  This is high level diplomacy.
[21:13.680 --> 21:17.080]  This is what the president is supposed to be doing.
[21:17.080 --> 21:22.840]  But the idea that Henry Kissinger is bending Trump to his will is exactly backward.
[21:22.840 --> 21:26.800]  Donald Trump is using Kissinger's skills as a diplomat.
[21:26.800 --> 21:32.840]  I see no evidence that Kissinger is changing the president's mind on, say, interventionist.
[21:32.840 --> 21:39.960]  In fact, my sources tell me Kissinger was opposed to the recommendation of putting 150,000
[21:39.960 --> 21:42.160]  troops into Syria.
[21:42.160 --> 21:47.640]  The other thing I can tell you, Alex, as reported here on info wars by Mike Sernovich, which
[21:47.640 --> 21:52.960]  I can now confirm, General McMaster is clearly on the skits.
[21:52.960 --> 21:54.800]  He is on his way out.
[21:54.800 --> 22:00.360]  He has not meshed with the president in terms of operating style.
[22:00.360 --> 22:04.040]  I do not think he has the president's confidence in this role.
[22:04.040 --> 22:09.520]  I think he will be appointed to a position for which he is better suited.
[22:09.520 --> 22:10.520]  The word is just shuffled off.
[22:10.520 --> 22:11.520]  Give it another star.
[22:11.520 --> 22:12.520]  This is on drudgereport.com.
[22:12.520 --> 22:14.400]  It's also an info wars.com.
[22:14.400 --> 22:18.840]  Obama uses a private jet 14 car convoy to get to climate speech.
[22:18.840 --> 22:19.840]  I'll talk about that later.
[22:19.840 --> 22:24.160]  But White House leakers having new target HR McMaster.
[22:24.160 --> 22:29.800]  And that's exactly what I was getting told by my sources and Sernovich's sources is that
[22:29.800 --> 22:34.040]  now Trump is going into the mode of leaking basically himself, which he's allowed to do
[22:34.040 --> 22:39.320]  or some of his adjuncts to go ahead and start undermining McMaster because McMaster, again,
[22:39.320 --> 22:42.960]  another guy that thought that he was in charge of everything just like Comey.
[22:42.960 --> 22:49.160]  Yeah, all these White House staffers and other presidential appointees who think they can
[22:49.160 --> 22:55.240]  manipulate Donald Trump like a puppet just do not know him and don't understand it.
[22:55.240 --> 22:57.400]  He's his own man.
[22:57.400 --> 22:59.120]  Sometimes he keeps his own counsel.
[22:59.120 --> 23:02.800]  Sometimes you can leave a meeting thinking you've persuaded him of something and then
[23:02.800 --> 23:07.000]  watch while he does the exact opposite of what you've recommended.
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.040]  This is the Trumps that people elected.
[23:09.040 --> 23:16.040]  When I read on page one of the New York Times that Ivanka Trump wants to be a moderating
[23:16.040 --> 23:19.680]  influence on her father, I don't want a moderated Donald Trump.
[23:19.680 --> 23:20.680]  Yeah, we didn't elect her.
[23:20.680 --> 23:21.680]  I voted for.
[23:21.680 --> 23:22.680]  I want the real Donald Trump.
[23:22.680 --> 23:26.120]  Yeah, we didn't elect a younger, better looking Hillary Clinton.
[23:26.120 --> 23:29.480]  Look, I love Trump just the way he is.
[23:29.480 --> 23:31.360]  I don't want a different Trump.
[23:31.360 --> 23:33.120]  I want Trump the outsider.
[23:33.120 --> 23:42.560]  I want Trump the bombastic, tough, shrewd businessman, a guy who understands how the
[23:42.560 --> 23:45.400]  big things happen, not just sit around and talk about them.
[23:45.400 --> 23:50.120]  All right, Roger, in the five minutes we've got left here, I want to look at the big picture.
[23:50.120 --> 23:52.400]  I mean, clearly the Russia thing is completely made up.
[23:52.400 --> 23:56.200]  The Democrats and a lot of the other Republican establishment have been deeply involved with
[23:56.200 --> 23:59.800]  lots of multinational companies and foreign governments.
[23:59.800 --> 24:04.000]  With Trump, it's surprising how little Russian connections there are, knowing he's an international
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.720]  business magnate and real estate mogul.
[24:06.720 --> 24:10.400]  That said, the Democrats are never going to get off the offense.
[24:10.400 --> 24:13.920]  They're the ones through their surrogates saying kill the president, kill us, overthrow
[24:13.920 --> 24:14.920]  everyone.
[24:14.920 --> 24:15.920]  They're at war with us.
[24:15.920 --> 24:17.880]  They're funding the cop killing groups.
[24:17.880 --> 24:20.560]  They're funding all the social distortion garbage.
[24:20.560 --> 24:25.080]  They're a clear and present danger running around inside our country, and so I'm not
[24:25.080 --> 24:30.000]  calling for authoritarianism, they're an authoritarian threat, and so we need the attorney general
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.280]  to go after the Clintons, to go after Obama, to go after them all.
[24:33.280 --> 24:34.280]  They want a war.
[24:34.280 --> 24:35.280]  They need to get one.
[24:35.280 --> 24:41.600]  I know in my gut, but also historically, if he doesn't go all out constitutionally with
[24:41.600 --> 24:45.520]  the right thing to do and get really aggressive politically and really start getting them
[24:45.520 --> 24:48.880]  back on their heels, they're not going to stop, they're going to make stuff up, they're
[24:48.880 --> 24:52.160]  going to dig stuff up, they're going to twist it, and they're going to try to remove the
[24:52.160 --> 24:53.160]  president.
[24:53.160 --> 24:54.160]  Now, am I wrong?
[24:54.160 --> 24:56.600]  Can he just let them sit there and do this forever?
[24:56.600 --> 24:57.600]  Or should he?
[24:57.600 --> 24:59.360]  I think you're absolutely right.
[24:59.360 --> 25:00.840]  I think you're 100% right.
[25:00.840 --> 25:06.520]  Look, we saw how the Democrats politicized Watergate, and they used it to undo one of
[25:06.520 --> 25:09.080]  the greatest political landslides in American history.
[25:09.080 --> 25:16.680]  They couldn't win at the ballot box, so they removed Nixon through this extrajudicial process.
[25:16.680 --> 25:21.800]  That's the same thing here, which is why I say, again, the majority on the Senate Intelligence
[25:21.800 --> 25:28.880]  Committee need to vote to subpoena Mr. Podesta, his brother, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton,
[25:28.880 --> 25:29.880]  Chelsea Clinton.
[25:29.880 --> 25:34.200]  They should be compelled to testify about their gas deal, their banking deal, their
[25:34.200 --> 25:35.200]  uranium deal.
[25:35.200 --> 25:39.240]  They are the people who have been in bed with Putin.
[25:39.240 --> 25:43.320]  It is not conjecture, it's not a conspiracy theory.
[25:43.320 --> 25:44.320]  These are cold-heart facts.
[25:44.320 --> 25:45.320]  Cut and run.
[25:45.320 --> 25:50.480]  And it's time for the Senate and House Republicans to show a little backbone.
[25:50.480 --> 25:51.480]  Well, exactly.
[25:51.480 --> 25:55.240]  They're the ones that have done all the stuff, selling us out to globalism.
[25:55.240 --> 25:57.520]  We get a real president trying to revert power back to the country.
[25:57.520 --> 26:00.120]  That doesn't mean you agree with every policy, but he really is being the president right
[26:00.120 --> 26:01.120]  now.
[26:01.120 --> 26:02.520]  All these special interests are pissed.
[26:02.520 --> 26:05.960]  They've involved themselves in corporate international espionage, transferring power
[26:05.960 --> 26:10.160]  to this crony capitalist offshore combine, and they want to go on the offense and call
[26:10.160 --> 26:13.360]  for our deaths and all this other crap.
[26:13.360 --> 26:15.480]  It's time to go on the offense against these people.
[26:15.480 --> 26:17.880]  Well, and you put your finger on it.
[26:17.880 --> 26:22.120]  It's time for Attorney General Sessions to put the vinaigrette jury and send for Hillary.
[26:22.120 --> 26:24.840]  I'm sure he has many, many, many questions for her.
[26:24.840 --> 26:26.520]  That's right, because they're not stopping.
[26:26.520 --> 26:27.520]  They're...
[26:27.520 --> 26:28.520]  That's email.
[26:28.520 --> 26:29.520]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[26:29.520 --> 26:33.320]  They're coming after America with everything they've got trying to destroy us, and they're
[26:33.320 --> 26:35.520]  the criminals, then let's let them have it.
[26:35.520 --> 26:36.520]  Sorry, go ahead.
[26:36.520 --> 26:39.880]  We have nothing to lose but running over these people.
[26:39.880 --> 26:41.720]  I could not agree more.
[26:41.720 --> 26:44.960]  It's time for the Republican Party, particularly the establishment Republican Party, to show
[26:44.960 --> 26:46.360]  us a backbone.
[26:46.360 --> 26:49.000]  We have to fight the way the Democrats are.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.440]  They are trying to undo the election.
[26:51.440 --> 26:52.560]  That is their goal.
[26:52.560 --> 26:58.120]  They're unhappy with what the people decided, and now they would like to remove Trump, discredit
[26:58.120 --> 27:03.720]  him, destabilize him, and as the New Yorker proved, I guess it was New York, no, the New
[27:03.720 --> 27:08.960]  Yorker proved, there's an active cabal to try to declare him insane and remove him
[27:08.960 --> 27:13.800]  under the 25th Amendment, because they don't like his policies.
[27:13.800 --> 27:14.880]  Think about that for a moment.
[27:14.880 --> 27:22.440]  We had a president who was a sexual falter of women, but we're claiming that Donald
[27:22.440 --> 27:23.440]  Trump's crazy.
[27:23.440 --> 27:24.440]  Please.
[27:24.440 --> 27:26.680]  I mean, Bill Clinton's clearly completely insane.
[27:26.680 --> 27:27.680]  So is Hillary.
[27:27.680 --> 27:31.560]  All right, StoneColdTruth.com, big Netflix show coming out in two days.
[27:31.560 --> 27:33.800]  I know you're going to be in New York tomorrow doing the rounds.
[27:33.800 --> 27:39.240]  Come on sometime tomorrow with us on the eve of the TV premiere, because this is going
[27:39.240 --> 27:40.240]  to be a real documentary.
[27:40.240 --> 27:48.800]  I really look forward to seeing this with Roger Stone in closing here, Roger.
[27:48.800 --> 27:52.320]  What else do you think the president needs to do?
[27:52.320 --> 27:56.960]  Well, I think he's from a political point of view.
[27:56.960 --> 28:02.440]  He is now finally getting to tax reform, and this is an issue that unites all wings of
[28:02.440 --> 28:04.320]  the party and the movement.
[28:04.320 --> 28:10.480]  You've got to get out there and sell his vision for a growing economy, and is on a
[28:10.480 --> 28:13.600]  fight east as a job creator.
[28:13.600 --> 28:16.080]  We've dallied too long with Obamacare.
[28:16.080 --> 28:20.280]  I'm glad we got it repealed, at least in the House.
[28:20.280 --> 28:25.440]  But it's now time to move to the core issue that won us the election, the stagnant economy
[28:25.440 --> 28:29.280]  and the fact that Barack Obama has run the country into the ground.
[28:29.280 --> 28:30.280]  It's the economy, stupid.
[28:30.280 --> 28:34.400]  I had to see the president listening to people like Larry Kudlow, instead of listening to
[28:34.400 --> 28:41.080]  people like his own economic advisor, Gary Cohn, the former chairman of Goldman, a liberal
[28:41.080 --> 28:44.640]  Democrat who I guarantee you voted for Hillary Clinton.
[28:44.640 --> 28:45.640]  Amazing.
[28:45.640 --> 28:47.720]  I guess Trump thinks he's keeping his enemies closer.
[28:47.720 --> 28:48.960]  I know this.
[28:48.960 --> 28:55.200]  On the jobs, on the stock market, on the sovereignty issue, on killing TPPs, totally delivered,
[28:55.200 --> 28:58.480]  cutting the IRS funding, cutting the UN funding by half.
[28:58.480 --> 28:59.960]  He's done a lot of great things.
[28:59.960 --> 29:01.360]  That's why they're so mad at him.
[29:01.360 --> 29:04.080]  But his compromises only make them think he's weak.
[29:04.080 --> 29:08.480]  So I just hope he just continues to steamroller right over the top of him, Roger Stone.
[29:08.480 --> 29:10.200]  Amen, brother.
[29:10.200 --> 29:11.200]  I'm with you 100%.
[29:11.200 --> 29:12.200]  All right.
[29:12.200 --> 29:15.320]  We'll all call you after the show today once you get to New York, because we always talk
[29:15.320 --> 29:17.240]  about some of the other things that are developing.
[29:17.240 --> 29:18.280]  We got 30 seconds left.
[29:18.280 --> 29:19.280]  Any other tidbits?
[29:19.280 --> 29:21.680]  I forgot to ask.
[29:21.680 --> 29:29.000]  You can help the fight for a free press in the First Amendment by going to infowarsstore.com
[29:29.000 --> 29:35.360]  and getting your copy of the making of the President 2016 or any of the great products
[29:35.360 --> 29:36.360]  there.
[29:36.360 --> 29:40.520]  This is crucial if we're going to have a vibrant and robust alternative media.
[29:40.520 --> 29:41.520]  That's right.
[29:41.520 --> 29:42.520]  Thank you.
[29:42.520 --> 29:43.520]  We're changing the world.
[29:43.520 --> 29:44.520]  That's why we're under attack.
[29:44.520 --> 29:45.520]  Our listeners are the backbone of the restoration of human liberty.
[29:45.520 --> 29:46.520]  We'll be right back.
[29:46.520 --> 29:47.520]  Stay with us.
[29:47.520 --> 29:50.640]  We're on the march.
[29:50.640 --> 29:53.040]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.040 --> 30:00.440]  Alex Jones and the G.C.N. Radio Network.
[30:00.440 --> 30:04.920]  Last week, infowars.com published the article, bombshell study proves unvaccinated children
[30:04.920 --> 30:06.800]  are healthier than vaccinated children.
[30:06.800 --> 30:11.120]  The two studies were pulled from the Journal of Transitional Science without any explanation.
[30:11.120 --> 30:16.440]  The studies surveyed parents of 666 homeschooled children, 39% who were not vaccinated.
[30:16.440 --> 30:20.400]  When asked about allergies, 22% of vaccinated children were shown to have allergies while
[30:20.400 --> 30:22.560]  only 6.9% were unvaccinated.
[30:22.560 --> 30:23.560]  Autism.
[30:23.560 --> 30:27.080]  4.7% were vaccinated versus 1% unvaccinated.
[30:27.080 --> 30:30.160]  So of course, there's going to be pushback when a study like this comes out proving that
[30:30.160 --> 30:31.920]  vaccines are not really safe.
[30:31.920 --> 30:35.200]  And people are going to come out and attack it and say, oh, they just talked to parents.
[30:35.200 --> 30:37.440]  Or they'll say, oh, there was a bias in the study.
[30:37.440 --> 30:39.480]  These people think vaccines are unsafe.
[30:39.480 --> 30:41.000]  One, the study proves they're unsafe.
[30:41.000 --> 30:45.440]  And two, any other vaccine study is done and paid for by the pharmaceutical companies.
[30:45.440 --> 30:47.440]  Of course, they think vaccines are safe.
[30:47.440 --> 30:51.120]  Just go to our article, bombshell study proves unvaccinated children are healthier.
[30:51.120 --> 30:54.960]  We have archive links to the studies and you can see for yourself because drug companies
[30:54.960 --> 30:56.840]  will do anything to keep you from the truth.
[30:56.840 --> 31:00.160]  Rob Dew reporting for info wars.com and info wars nightly news.
[31:00.160 --> 31:02.040]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[31:02.040 --> 31:04.040]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:04.040 --> 31:06.920]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:06.920 --> 31:12.960]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:12.960 --> 31:17.920]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking
[31:17.920 --> 31:22.880]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze, whether it's your home
[31:22.880 --> 31:28.000]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[31:28.000 --> 31:29.720]  you can to purify your air.
[31:29.720 --> 31:34.760]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:34.760 --> 31:37.720]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[31:37.720 --> 31:43.880]  The general public doesn't the Alexa pure breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:43.880 --> 31:47.520]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:47.520 --> 31:51.080]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more
[31:51.080 --> 31:54.280]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:54.280 --> 32:00.720]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarstore.com.
[32:00.720 --> 32:05.680]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[32:05.680 --> 32:09.040]  before it became a loss to our modern diet of processed junk.
[32:09.040 --> 32:14.240]  We are now introducing caveman by infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with
[32:14.240 --> 32:20.400]  bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[32:20.400 --> 32:22.760]  great tasting formula caveman.
[32:22.760 --> 32:26.760]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[32:26.760 --> 32:30.720]  superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[32:30.720 --> 32:33.400]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[32:33.400 --> 32:38.560]  You use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength,
[32:38.560 --> 32:42.880]  for the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces
[32:42.880 --> 32:43.980]  the blood for the body.
[32:43.980 --> 32:46.520]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[32:46.520 --> 32:50.880]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[32:50.880 --> 32:54.520]  to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[32:54.520 --> 32:58.960]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself in infowarslife.com
[32:58.960 --> 32:59.960]  today.
[32:59.960 --> 33:10.920]  Good evening, there are reports tonight that President Nixon has ordered Attorney General
[33:10.920 --> 33:16.080]  Elliott Richardson to fire the special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox.
[33:16.080 --> 33:20.160]  Scholars are comparing this to Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre, what do you make of those
[33:20.160 --> 33:21.160]  comparisons?
[33:21.160 --> 33:22.400]  I think that's ridiculous.
[33:22.400 --> 33:28.440]  This is just the most preposterous pretext, this is an investigator who is investigating
[33:28.440 --> 33:34.000]  the White House and he was just fired by the White House.
[33:34.000 --> 33:40.280]  This doesn't happen in the United States except on October 20th, 1973 when Richard
[33:40.280 --> 33:42.680]  Nixon filed Archibald Cox.
[33:42.680 --> 33:47.240]  People see this as a real threat, I think we've taken a step away from rule of law toward
[33:47.240 --> 33:51.320]  the rule of a small group of people and I also want to say that as a result of that I feel
[33:51.320 --> 33:56.680]  vindicated because I said that Donald Trump had become president and he has become president,
[33:56.680 --> 33:57.680]  President Nixon.
[33:57.680 --> 34:03.320]  It's just a hard-hit fact I think to some of the most tainted actions by President Nixon.
[34:03.320 --> 34:12.880]  Just remember that we face a looming constitutional crisis, very much like happened in 1973, the
[34:12.880 --> 34:14.040]  Midnight Massacre.
[34:14.040 --> 34:20.960]  This episode has very much the feel of that chapter in our history, one that we should
[34:20.960 --> 34:21.960]  not repeat.
[34:21.960 --> 34:35.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[34:35.720 --> 34:40.080]  I think I should just open the phones up and play some clips of what's been unfolding but
[34:40.080 --> 34:48.080]  this really makes me feel good about President Trump in that he has fired Comey, Comey that
[34:48.080 --> 34:52.280]  stood there while Loretta Lynch met on airplanes with Bill Clinton breaking the law while he
[34:52.280 --> 34:57.040]  was under criminal investigation, Lynch who sat there with all the WikiLeaks info coming
[34:57.040 --> 35:04.480]  out how they were coordinating with the White House on the cover-up crimes, the uranium deals
[35:04.480 --> 35:09.080]  to Russia, the sellout of our technology to China, I mean the Clintons have been protected
[35:09.080 --> 35:15.320]  by the FBI for decades from the highest levels committing their crimes and then all the WikiLeaks
[35:15.320 --> 35:21.840]  pedophile information that the New York Police Department wanted to release with the FBI
[35:21.840 --> 35:24.760]  basically shut down.
[35:24.760 --> 35:29.000]  Now am I saying the FBI are evil people on average?
[35:29.000 --> 35:30.000]  Certainly not.
[35:30.000 --> 35:34.480]  In fact it's some of the most anti-globalist folks out there or mid-level FBI agents who
[35:34.480 --> 35:40.000]  are aware of what's happening but at the top of this country it is just incredibly corrupt
[35:40.000 --> 35:45.920]  and Donald Trump is restoring our military, restoring our sovereignty, restoring our economy,
[35:45.920 --> 35:48.520]  restoring our pride.
[35:48.520 --> 35:54.480]  If Russia was our enemy and if Russia was controlling President Trump they would not
[35:54.480 --> 35:56.400]  be doing any of this.
[35:56.400 --> 36:03.120]  The first thing a Russian compromised operative would do would keep coal banned.
[36:03.120 --> 36:09.960]  They have enough coal for over a thousand years with clean burning systems in the United
[36:09.960 --> 36:12.880]  States, conservatively.
[36:12.880 --> 36:18.320]  There's more coal than natural gas, oil, you name it, can buy.
[36:18.320 --> 36:24.400]  And when Trump set all that coal back on the table it made gas prices in Russia plunge
[36:24.400 --> 36:27.680]  and that's Russia's main export.
[36:27.680 --> 36:34.200]  But see that's if you're actually geopolitically informed, it wasn't to hurt Russia, it's
[36:34.200 --> 36:39.520]  to help the United States, sorry, that's the kind of stuff Trump did.
[36:39.520 --> 36:47.600]  The globalists actually had deals multinational with the Saudi Arabians and others to not
[36:47.600 --> 36:52.200]  bring the coal online, to not bring the oil online.
[36:52.200 --> 36:53.880]  And Trump's ending all that.
[36:53.880 --> 36:58.160]  Now some will argue that it'll drop down energy prices so low that it causes some type of
[36:58.160 --> 37:00.840]  stall out in the economy.
[37:00.840 --> 37:03.720]  Trump's just letting the free market in, he thinks it'll correct itself.
[37:03.720 --> 37:09.120]  And so far you see amazing exuberance in the economy, right as the time we were going
[37:09.120 --> 37:12.120]  over the edge of an economic cliff.
[37:12.120 --> 37:18.720]  So I have seen people go from being totally enthusiastic about Trump to by about a hundred
[37:18.720 --> 37:24.520]  days in, we're now a hundred and eleven days in, really being disillusioned with President
[37:24.520 --> 37:27.120]  Trump.
[37:27.120 --> 37:33.240]  One bellwether example of that is that we were selling probably five hundred Trump
[37:33.240 --> 37:39.000]  Pence 2020 shirts a day until about day 70 when Trump started to go sideways with that
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.240]  bad healthcare bill.
[37:41.240 --> 37:49.640]  And then the going after the signs and those are some big, big black marks, pop marks on
[37:49.640 --> 37:52.200]  the face of Trump's agenda.
[37:52.200 --> 37:54.400]  And I don't know why he did those things.
[37:54.400 --> 38:00.960]  A lot of it is his adjuncts or just doing whatever they want, like McMaster and others.
[38:00.960 --> 38:01.960]  I like sessions.
[38:01.960 --> 38:02.960]  He's a good honorable man.
[38:02.960 --> 38:07.240]  I agree with him about 90% of stuff, but he wants to go back like 1960s laws where you
[38:07.240 --> 38:12.120]  get locked up for 10 years in prison for a marijuana cigarette.
[38:12.120 --> 38:15.120]  That's just ridiculous.
[38:15.120 --> 38:18.120]  The drug war is a joke.
[38:18.120 --> 38:20.240]  Does that mean I agree with the drug culture?
[38:20.240 --> 38:21.240]  Absolutely not.
[38:21.240 --> 38:24.640]  I'm just saying the way it's working isn't working.
[38:24.640 --> 38:27.240]  Mexico is the second most dangerous country in the world.
[38:27.240 --> 38:32.360]  Hundred and thirty thousand people in the last decade killed there that they know of.
[38:32.360 --> 38:41.840]  I'm like 200,000 missing from about 300 plus thousand people.
[38:41.840 --> 38:44.560]  And we don't want to end up like that, folks.
[38:44.560 --> 38:46.840]  That's the drug war for you.
[38:46.840 --> 38:54.040]  Look at Chicago, the only place in this hemisphere more dangerous than Mexico City.
[38:54.040 --> 38:57.480]  Chicago, people are fleeing Chicago and mass.
[38:57.480 --> 39:00.800]  We have a story about that yesterday that was linked up on DrudgeReport.com.
[39:00.800 --> 39:05.240]  I want to give the toll free number, I don't want to take your phone calls, toll free number
[39:05.240 --> 39:13.400]  is 800-25-99231, 800-25-99231.
[39:13.400 --> 39:19.920]  I look at President Trump and I look at the good new Supreme Court justice.
[39:19.920 --> 39:23.840]  I look at the word that Kennedy is going to be stepping down soon.
[39:23.840 --> 39:27.280]  These are godsense.
[39:27.280 --> 39:33.640]  The fact that he's got, what, 10 new judges that are all super conservative going in this
[39:33.640 --> 39:38.800]  month and then hundreds more vacancies are about to be filled and every person he's getting
[39:38.800 --> 39:42.720]  is hardcore conservative, hardcore constitutionalist.
[39:42.720 --> 39:51.080]  I mean night and day compared to the Democrats, absolute night and day, he is delivering.
[39:51.080 --> 39:58.400]  If he wasn't delivering on our agenda, the globalist wouldn't be calling for his death
[39:58.400 --> 40:06.840]  and his destruction and his impeachment and his overthrow 24-7.
[40:06.840 --> 40:11.160]  So again, you're selling 500 shirts a day and this isn't about selling the shirts.
[40:11.160 --> 40:18.280]  It's a bellwether and then you start selling 30, 40, 50 a day after he starts going sideways.
[40:18.280 --> 40:25.240]  Listen, we need winner patriots, not sunshine patriots.
[40:25.240 --> 40:29.440]  If you don't see Trump isn't moving the ball down the field by light years.
[40:29.440 --> 40:33.320]  If you don't see the enemy is absolutely crapping their drawers.
[40:33.320 --> 40:40.920]  If you don't see the fact that global corporate crony capitalism is a nightmare system and
[40:40.920 --> 40:46.200]  that Trump's opposing it and using that system to our advantage now, then you're not paying
[40:46.200 --> 40:47.200]  attention.
[40:47.200 --> 40:52.960]  I'm not even a pragmatist about this.
[40:52.960 --> 40:58.160]  I'm a purist in what I do so that we can try to set a benchmark, but the fact is Trump
[40:58.160 --> 41:05.840]  is winning nine out of 10 rounds with the globalist right now and he's compromising
[41:05.840 --> 41:11.000]  on some issues to get it done with Congress and I like how the second bill that's now
[41:11.000 --> 41:17.760]  passed the House is much better than the first one.
[41:17.760 --> 41:19.920]  So the process is starting to actually work.
[41:19.920 --> 41:23.480]  Trump's getting a lot done that's good.
[41:23.480 --> 41:24.980]  That's why they hate him.
[41:24.980 --> 41:28.520]  That's why I'm supporting him and this Comey thing is so good.
[41:28.520 --> 41:33.480]  It's good.
[41:33.480 --> 41:37.920]  And we have to understand that the old Republican leadership, most of them are just a bunch
[41:37.920 --> 41:40.160]  of country club people.
[41:40.160 --> 41:44.280]  They were put into power because they're yes men, they're a bunch of lawyers who played
[41:44.280 --> 41:49.040]  ball for 20, 30 years, leaving it into Congress and you look at all those cowards, Republican
[41:49.040 --> 41:54.040]  and Democrat in the Senate and the House, the old blue bloods that are in there.
[41:54.040 --> 41:56.640]  They are so scared to death of mainstream media.
[41:56.640 --> 41:58.560]  They think Bill Maher is cool.
[41:58.560 --> 42:00.640]  They think Stephen Colbert is really cool.
[42:00.640 --> 42:02.680]  They think TV is impressive.
[42:02.680 --> 42:07.760]  They think it's a big deal to be on the news and they're all proud to be on CNN and Fox.
[42:07.760 --> 42:11.320]  It's an embarrassment to be on those shows playing along with all that.
[42:11.320 --> 42:15.240]  That's the old world, the old facade rotting decayed.
[42:15.240 --> 42:19.960]  Another big wind blows by, it's going to completely collapse.
[42:19.960 --> 42:22.720]  Much of it is already falling down.
[42:22.720 --> 42:25.480]  And so they really are scared when they get home with their wife or their husband will
[42:25.480 --> 42:32.720]  say, I saw you getting bashed on TV or you don't want to get called a Russian agent.
[42:32.720 --> 42:39.040]  And that's the old dying facade, Trump knows it's an old dying facade.
[42:39.040 --> 42:42.600]  It's the corrupt takeover of the last 50 years in this country.
[42:42.600 --> 42:47.840]  It's illegitimate, it's authoritarian, it's anti free market and anti American fundamentally
[42:47.840 --> 42:50.360]  because it wants to mount our hell on the wall.
[42:50.360 --> 42:57.520]  It had to struggle for decades to get control and it doesn't like real competition.
[42:57.520 --> 42:59.440]  It doesn't like strength.
[42:59.440 --> 43:01.120]  It doesn't like honorable systems.
[43:01.120 --> 43:09.600]  It's a ruling elite that won high tech feudalism, dumb down, servile, idiot populations, educated
[43:09.600 --> 43:12.520]  to be morons, educated idiots.
[43:12.520 --> 43:16.040]  It's in the social engineering codes for a hundred years.
[43:16.040 --> 43:19.880]  The big banking associations wrote letters and had quarterly meetings about it in, you
[43:19.880 --> 43:24.520]  know, the 1890s about, we got too many educated people, everybody's reading, everybody knows
[43:24.520 --> 43:25.520]  too much.
[43:25.520 --> 43:26.720]  They're totally unruly.
[43:26.720 --> 43:30.160]  We've got to get public education in place and dumb these people down.
[43:30.160 --> 43:37.720]  We've got to get full control.
[43:37.720 --> 43:41.480]  And they've done it to a great extent, but it doesn't matter.
[43:41.480 --> 43:45.120]  You get half the population suck on their thumb and not knowing which end is up, can't
[43:45.120 --> 43:47.720]  find their rear end with both hands.
[43:47.720 --> 43:51.000]  The elite want people like that to control them, but imagine when there's not many people
[43:51.000 --> 43:57.360]  that are actually informed and involved, it's almost an advantage to those of us that know
[43:57.360 --> 44:01.360]  the truth because there's so many more of us that are awake than there are the tiny
[44:01.360 --> 44:02.360]  globalist group.
[44:02.360 --> 44:05.440]  See, you've got the big mass of dumb down people, you've got a large mass of people
[44:05.440 --> 44:09.000]  that still a minority that knows what's going on, then you've got the tiny elite that knows
[44:09.000 --> 44:14.160]  what's going on, helped induce the stupidity of the masses and is hoping we'll just join
[44:14.160 --> 44:18.120]  them on feeding on the idiots.
[44:18.120 --> 44:22.520]  But if you turn the public into animals, it blows back on your family.
[44:22.520 --> 44:24.640]  You don't escape that culture.
[44:24.640 --> 44:26.280]  You don't escape all the gangster culture.
[44:26.280 --> 44:29.000]  You don't escape all this trash out there.
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.800]  That's the elite's greatest lie to themselves is you can do horrible things to people and
[44:32.800 --> 44:34.200]  not have to come back on you.
[44:34.200 --> 44:41.080]  That's not how the universe works, ladies and gentlemen, and that's how the elites
[44:41.080 --> 44:43.200]  operate that real charming, real nice.
[44:43.200 --> 44:49.200]  Come on, Alex, we used to be like you, we used to be Romanics.
[44:49.200 --> 44:55.080]  You're not going to succeed in this crusade, either be a star or fail.
[44:55.080 --> 44:57.360]  The public wants to tear you apart.
[44:57.360 --> 44:58.480]  They're never going to care about you.
[44:58.480 --> 45:00.040]  They're never going to like you.
[45:00.040 --> 45:02.640]  You can't help them.
[45:02.640 --> 45:07.400]  You just need to join us and hope you can influence things for the better, being part
[45:07.400 --> 45:11.320]  of the actual elite.
[45:11.320 --> 45:15.200]  And that's the speech you get over and over again.
[45:15.200 --> 45:16.680]  That's the speech you get.
[45:16.680 --> 45:20.800]  Do the right thing for your family, Alex.
[45:20.800 --> 45:22.800]  Just join us.
[45:22.800 --> 45:24.160]  You can trust us.
[45:24.160 --> 45:26.640]  You want to work with you.
[45:26.640 --> 45:28.640]  You see how it all works?
[45:28.640 --> 45:30.960]  Even a lot of our tileable people don't get the whole thing.
[45:30.960 --> 45:38.080]  We could really use somebody like you and you're supposed to go, oh, really?
[45:38.080 --> 45:40.080]  I can fly around on the private helicopters and jets.
[45:40.080 --> 45:47.920]  I can go be part of this whole system and then I can be a vampire culturally and play
[45:47.920 --> 45:52.200]  along with the deception and wage war against my own species.
[45:52.200 --> 45:53.200]  You know what?
[45:53.200 --> 46:03.320]  And now here we are.
[46:03.320 --> 46:10.320]  More than 18 years after I refused the first buy-off and you could see we changed the world
[46:10.320 --> 46:14.520]  together and we're making it a better place and we're turning the corner because we believe
[46:14.520 --> 46:15.520]  in humanity.
[46:15.520 --> 46:16.920]  We believe in justice.
[46:16.920 --> 46:17.920]  We believe in prosperity.
[46:17.920 --> 46:19.800]  We believe in God.
[46:19.800 --> 46:22.560]  We don't believe in evil.
[46:22.560 --> 46:30.000]  We don't use evil systems just because it can advance us physically, monetarily, temporally
[46:30.000 --> 46:38.680]  because you use that power, the ring, the rings of power as an archetype.
[46:38.680 --> 46:41.360]  You use evil technology.
[46:41.360 --> 46:46.800]  You use systems of deception, the knowledge of evil.
[46:46.800 --> 46:51.440]  It poisons the world and poisons you and then you don't even recognize why you get more
[46:51.440 --> 46:57.120]  and more evil once you give into it and it's because it's a virus in your soul and it's
[46:57.120 --> 47:03.200]  slowly taking you over until one day you never wake up and something else is running you
[47:03.200 --> 47:08.440]  and now you've given over your psyche, your soul, it's like a brain transplant has been
[47:08.440 --> 47:12.240]  put into your body and you're dead.
[47:12.240 --> 47:18.600]  You're cut off from God and you're just some empty robotic biological android, replicant
[47:18.600 --> 47:24.920]  demon roaming around at award shows and posing and into your own little emptiness.
[47:24.920 --> 47:32.360]  I have been around billionaires globalists sell out the system and they're like scared
[47:32.360 --> 47:33.360]  robots.
[47:33.360 --> 47:46.480]  They're just like crazed weird fumbling morons and then there are people who are in the system
[47:46.480 --> 47:51.160]  but still have a soul and they're totally freaked out and scared.
[47:51.160 --> 47:54.680]  And the system's there to intimidate them, try to take their money away, try to destroy
[47:54.680 --> 47:58.560]  them, go after their families, if they dare stick their head up and Hollywood's the worst
[47:58.560 --> 48:04.440]  model of control and all the quote beautiful people that go there to be somebody and Hollywood
[48:04.440 --> 48:09.520]  didn't make them somebody, Hollywood stole their greatness and then created a fiction
[48:09.520 --> 48:17.920]  around it when they could have gone out in the world and built whole new systems but
[48:17.920 --> 48:21.760]  they had it stolen from them, it's like the devil convinces you you can sell your soul,
[48:21.760 --> 48:26.720]  you can't sell your soul, you can convince yourself you sold your soul like a Faustian
[48:26.720 --> 48:35.160]  deal but never know you could get out of it at any time.
[48:35.160 --> 48:45.360]  The devil doesn't give you any of this, the devil just kind of steps out of your way as
[48:45.360 --> 48:50.160]  long as you're used as a tool to hurt other people and then let you have power within
[48:50.160 --> 48:54.520]  this false system when you already had the birthright and the full control of the planet
[48:54.520 --> 48:56.840]  from the day you were born.
[48:56.840 --> 49:00.520]  The devil was put in there in front of that like a gatekeeper that you've got to make
[49:00.520 --> 49:07.840]  it through instead of interfacing with the devil this whole system and having your destiny
[49:07.840 --> 49:08.840]  stolen from you.
[49:08.840 --> 49:11.760]  I'm going to go to break, come back, I'm going to start taking your phone calls, I've
[49:11.760 --> 49:14.040]  got a bunch of clips to get to as well.

[50:49.880 --> 50:55.040]  create communities, the globalist wants centralized systems to siphon off all your money and wealth
[50:55.040 --> 51:00.160]  to build systems that are anti-human, that's why they want to kill free market.

[54:10.960 --> 54:35.240]  We have a highly entrenched, dug in, multinational crime syndicate calls itself globalism.
[54:35.240 --> 54:40.440]  Globalism is simply a means to an end to carry out their eugenics program of the
[54:40.440 --> 54:48.040]  technotronic silicon merger with human life forms and their advanced species off-world
[54:48.040 --> 54:50.960]  breakaway civilization DARPA program.
[54:50.960 --> 54:55.760]  Now I told you about that 19 years ago when I really learned about it.
[54:55.760 --> 54:58.680]  I've been on air a few years.
[54:58.680 --> 55:02.640]  And now you notice it's Elon Musk, everything I said word for word all over the days, every
[55:02.640 --> 55:03.640]  day.
[55:03.640 --> 55:08.000]  They're just normalizing it all right now.
[55:08.000 --> 55:09.000]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[55:09.000 --> 55:16.320]  We're in the year 2017, the globalist technology, 2050.
[55:16.320 --> 55:20.280]  They already believe they have sentient AI computers.
[55:20.280 --> 55:24.240]  Let's just say they're good enough to fool top engineers.
[55:24.240 --> 55:28.920]  But it doesn't matter if they don't have a soul or aren't conscious because they're
[55:28.920 --> 55:32.720]  wired in to billions of people's actions every day.
[55:32.720 --> 55:37.280]  And they can build algorithms to track everything you do and predict what you're going to do
[55:37.280 --> 55:43.520]  before you even know it.
[55:43.520 --> 55:54.440]  The end of free will, total digital enslavement, the de-evolution of man, and they're getting
[55:54.440 --> 56:02.840]  us ready for it saying no mothers and no fathers, no family unit, no just take drugs
[56:02.840 --> 56:07.720]  and watch TV and just bliss out.
[56:07.720 --> 56:23.000]  And you're journeyed towards species extinction will be complete, a very selfish move and
[56:23.000 --> 56:27.520]  the people running the planet are creating new species as fast as they can every few
[56:27.520 --> 56:36.720]  hours a new species has created, a new species, a new species of virus, a new species of bacteria,
[56:36.720 --> 56:46.880]  a new species of animal, slash plant, slash insectoid, slash silicon, it's already here.
[56:46.880 --> 56:54.480]  Synthetic nanotech humanoids, yeah the robot cats were back in the 60s, the robot rats
[56:54.480 --> 57:01.840]  were in the 80s, the robot roaches in the 70s, it's beyond robots now boys and girls.
[57:01.840 --> 57:12.520]  I want to go to Robert, Beth, Ben, Adam, Harry, we got all of you, but you got to ask yourself
[57:12.520 --> 57:19.480]  why is this broadcast so hated, it's the same reason Trump's hated because we believe in
[57:19.480 --> 57:21.400]  human empowerment.
[57:21.400 --> 57:28.160]  We believe in free market, we believe in open societies, notice George Soros calls his group
[57:28.160 --> 57:32.840]  the open society because he wants the opposite of an open society, he wants to import the
[57:32.840 --> 57:38.320]  rapugees so we can bow to them, it's disgusting, all right I'm going to go to break, I promise
[57:38.320 --> 57:41.760]  them to come back and go right to Ben and Adam and Harry and Robert and Beth and everybody
[57:41.760 --> 57:47.480]  else told for number to join us is 800-25-99-231, I don't think I know, Trump needs to go on
[57:47.480 --> 57:52.560]  the offense against the criminals who have been sold out to communist China and Russia
[57:52.560 --> 57:58.520]  and everybody else or they're going to hoist him up on their own crimes and this going
[57:58.520 --> 58:02.520]  after Comey is hopefully the beginning of him fulfilling his promise, he's fulfilled
[58:02.520 --> 58:07.920]  so many others to lock her up, Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the free press, she wants
[58:07.920 --> 58:15.800]  to have us all arrested, you are offensively trying to launch a totalitarian takeover Democrats
[58:15.800 --> 58:24.040]  and I got a little news for you, turnabout's fair play, all's fair in love and war and
[58:24.040 --> 58:30.040]  so we'll see if Trump's for real because if he doesn't move offensively against them
[58:30.040 --> 58:36.760]  when he has the constitutional right and duty, he will be destroyed by his inaction, we'll

[1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:55.920]  two, an inconvenient load of horse manure, part two, and then we will have Mike Cernovich
[1:00:55.920 --> 1:00:59.840]  popping in to tell us about some of the big leaks he's gonna be breaking down today in
[1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:04.760]  the fourth hour when he hosts the fourth hour that CNN and a bunch of other publications
[1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:06.320]  and outfits have just been dreading.
[1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:10.480]  I do intend to add a lot of other talk show hosts here in the near future, we're just
[1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:14.680]  busy getting the board operators and producers and everybody lined up to probably go, I
[1:01:14.680 --> 1:01:20.240]  don't know, 10 hours a day live and then 16, 18 hours a day live, TV slash radio, so that's
[1:01:20.240 --> 1:01:23.280]  gonna be happening in the next two to six months, adding that in.
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:29.320]  I still haven't gotten to the phase of putting all that in place, but we're very, very close.
[1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:31.640]  As I told you three years ago, we're gonna take the InfoWars to the next level, we're
[1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:32.640]  gonna change the world.
[1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:36.040]  Every few years, I tell you, I know we're gonna go to the next level now.
[1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:41.040]  Coming through the grace of God and your prayers and support, we then shed our skin
[1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:42.760]  and grow to the next level.
[1:01:42.760 --> 1:01:46.880]  And so we're doing that in the face of unprecedented attack, thanks to your support and your prayers,
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:49.680]  we are making it through even stronger.
[1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:52.560]  Ben in PA, thank you for holding her on the air.
[1:01:52.560 --> 1:01:57.200]  Hi Alex, finally glad to be able to get to talk to you, been trying for a week.
[1:01:57.200 --> 1:02:00.200]  Back at you.
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:05.920]  I just wanted to mention something here about James Comey and I think it's fantastic, the
[1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:07.560]  Trump got rid of him.
[1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:11.040]  I think it's the best thing that he's done since being sworn in.
[1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:15.640]  I mean, it's, I think if anything's gonna rally his base, it's gotta be this.
[1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:16.640]  Absolutely.
[1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:21.480]  And Comey was just arrogant and did whatever he wanted, we're just sick of these rogue agencies
[1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:22.480]  and rogue bureaucracies.
[1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:26.120]  It's just, and I mean, I think Trump ought to sack them all.
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:29.000]  And you know, he ought to just go after anybody that's sitting there trying to stand in the
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:30.800]  way of restoring our republic.
[1:02:30.800 --> 1:02:34.760]  You got a bunch of foreign globalists of hijacked the country, get out of the way, man, get
[1:02:34.760 --> 1:02:40.200]  out of the way, quite frankly, this globalist invasion is so bad, Trump can call the military
[1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:42.320]  out and have them all arrested, I'd support it.
[1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:45.520]  Because they're a bunch of foreign globalists that have hijacked the country and I want
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:47.240]  their asses kicked out of here.
[1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:50.680]  George Washington would have arrested them a long time ago, go ahead, sorry.
[1:02:50.680 --> 1:02:55.240]  Oh, that'd be tart and feathered if Washington was still here.
[1:02:55.240 --> 1:02:56.840]  I just, it's fantastic.
[1:02:56.840 --> 1:03:00.600]  I mean, he did get a little sideways there and I think it's all of our right to criticize
[1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:01.600]  him when he does.
[1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:02.960]  You know, I mean, that's natural.
[1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:08.960]  We don't want to fall in line like the liberal dude did with Obama, but I just love it.
[1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:11.640]  I mean, I think this is a rallying cry to all of us.
[1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:14.800]  This is something that says, hey, he's not been taken over.
[1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:16.320]  He's his own man.
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:17.840]  He's, he's there.
[1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:21.280]  He's got a, this is the start of draining the swamp, which is what I'm hoping for.
[1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:27.280]  I mean, this really points to, you know, hey, maybe Hillary Clinton could be thrown in
[1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:28.520]  jail, which we, she should be.
[1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:31.240]  I'm not going to say she will, but you know, my fingers crossed.
[1:03:31.240 --> 1:03:35.160]  She should be, well, I mean, look, there's all this interlocking corruption, so nobody
[1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:36.160]  wants to bring somebody down.
[1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:38.640]  They're like too corrupt to fail, too corrupt to be brought down.
[1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:42.120]  We've got to do it and Trump is in the swamp.
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:47.480]  He is battling sea monsters and giant crocodiles and alligators and swamp things.
[1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:48.680]  He's not just draining it.
[1:03:48.680 --> 1:03:52.920]  He's in the swamp battling these creatures and I don't expect him not to get some swamp
[1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:55.040]  thing, you know, guts and blood on him.
[1:03:55.040 --> 1:04:00.800]  I just don't want to catch him in bed with a swamp thing, right?
[1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:05.400]  And I honestly, I was worried, you know, I'm not saying I got away from him because I was
[1:04:05.400 --> 1:04:06.400]  like, he needs our support.
[1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:09.280]  He needs to hear from us saying, you know, don't go sideways.
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:11.520]  Stay the straight and narrow.
[1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:15.080]  And seeing this, you know, yesterday I was at my parents visiting my parents.
[1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:18.960]  They live about an hour away and we went and this news broke, you know, I read it on Info
[1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:23.840]  Wars and I read it out loud and my dad, who he's been in the hospital for seven weeks
[1:04:23.840 --> 1:04:24.840]  with ammonia.
[1:04:24.840 --> 1:04:27.840]  He just got home and, you know, he jumped up and about to have clicked his heels, you
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:31.640]  know, that he's fired, told me, got rid of him and he's like, well, absolutely.
[1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:36.000]  Comey and Lynch, they all deserve to be arrested, my view.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:41.960]  They stood there while Obama and the Clintons, I mean, Obama has been caught with the Muslim
[1:04:41.960 --> 1:04:47.960]  Brotherhood overthrowing secular governments and our allies and putting dirtbag Wahhabist
[1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:48.960]  in.
[1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:49.960]  They all need to be arrested.
[1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:51.960]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:54.040]  It's not authoritarianism.
[1:04:54.040 --> 1:04:55.680]  They're all traitors.
[1:04:55.680 --> 1:04:56.680]  Arrest them all.
[1:04:56.680 --> 1:04:57.680]  Thank you, brother.
[1:04:57.680 --> 1:04:58.680]  We'll be right back.
[1:04:58.680 --> 1:05:02.520]  Last week, info wars.com published the article.
[1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:06.560]  Bombshell study proves unvaccinated children are healthier than vaccinated children.
[1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:10.840]  The two studies were pulled from the Journal of Transitional Science without any explanation.
[1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:16.200]  The studies surveyed parents of 666 homeschooled children, 39% who were not vaccinated.
[1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:20.160]  When asked about allergies, 22% of vaccinated children were shown to have allergies while
[1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:26.840]  only 6.9% were unvaccinated autism 4.7% were vaccinated versus 1% unvaccinated.
[1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:29.920]  So of course, there's going to be pushback when a study like this comes out proving that
[1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:31.680]  vaccines are not really safe.
[1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:34.920]  And people are going to come out and attack it and say, oh, they just talked to parents.
[1:05:34.920 --> 1:05:37.200]  Are they'll say, oh, there was a bias in the study.
[1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:39.240]  These people think vaccines are unsafe.
[1:05:39.240 --> 1:05:40.760]  One, the study proves they're unsafe.
[1:05:40.760 --> 1:05:45.200]  And two, any other vaccine study is done and paid for by the pharmaceutical companies.
[1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:47.200]  Of course, they think vaccines are safe.
[1:05:47.200 --> 1:05:50.840]  Go to our article, Bombshell study proves unvaccinated children are healthier.
[1:05:50.840 --> 1:05:54.680]  We have archive links to the studies, and you can see for yourself, because drug companies
[1:05:54.680 --> 1:05:56.600]  will do anything to keep you from the truth.
[1:05:56.600 --> 1:05:59.640]  Rob Dew reporting for infowars.com and infowars nightly news.

[1:06:07.440 --> 1:06:11.400]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream, and even contribute to blood
[1:06:11.400 --> 1:06:12.800]  clots and heart attacks.
[1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:17.440]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health

[1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:31.840]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out
[1:06:31.840 --> 1:06:34.360]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:39.000]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:43.880]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more, due to requests from listeners who found that
[1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:46.360]  spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[1:06:46.360 --> 1:06:50.360]  We have created the new bubblegum flavored super blue that is spearmint free.

[1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:05.000]  We've been sold out for months.

[1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:18.760]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium,
[1:07:18.760 --> 1:07:23.920]  but Biotrusillinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:27.440]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[1:07:27.440 --> 1:07:32.480]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production in eyesight, Biotrusillinium
[1:07:32.480 --> 1:07:37.600]  is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support
[1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:39.680]  a healthy thyroid and many other systems.

[1:07:53.600 --> 1:07:55.720]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[1:07:55.720 --> 1:08:11.760]  This is the time to support InfoWars, that's infowarslife.com.
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:18.000]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas,
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:29.720]  Alex Jones.
[1:08:29.720 --> 1:08:40.360]  Well Comey, the FBI director, but in four years, who acted like a giant fruit salad on
[1:08:40.360 --> 1:08:46.280]  two legs, who sat there while Loretta Lynch and all these other people committed just
[1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:52.720]  crimes in front of everyone, let the Clinton Foundation run wild, let Obama sell us out
[1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:57.400]  to the Islamist, Obama got caught financing the Muslim Brotherhood had CNN promoting the
[1:08:57.400 --> 1:08:58.400]  Arab Spring.
[1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:04.520]  I mean, good God people, Lordy Lordy to quote Comey.
[1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:09.520]  This has been out of control, completely and totally out of control.
[1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:13.880]  And I've said Trump has to go on the offense.
[1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:19.440]  Everything the Democrats say he is, is what they've been caught doing, red-handed illegal
[1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:23.760]  server, lying about it to Congress, you go to jail.
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:30.640]  Hillary meeting secretly with Putin, all these business deals, you go to jail.
[1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:35.040]  But instead they want to delegitimize the election we had, and the special interests
[1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:37.960]  that have hijacked this country want to destroy our president.
[1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:42.280]  They're never going to let him even compromise with them because they want to destroy the
[1:09:42.280 --> 1:09:48.120]  image of nationalism, they want to defeat that idea, their whole world governments
[1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:50.120]  in crisis.
[1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:54.040]  The president can give them no quarter because they're not giving us any.
[1:09:54.040 --> 1:09:58.040]  I don't want to sit up here and I've been on the air 20 plus years and talk about arresting
[1:09:58.040 --> 1:10:01.880]  these globalists and you know, they're the ones calling for civil war, they're the ones
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:05.000]  calling for everybody's death, they're the ones running around foaming at the mouth
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:10.160]  wanting physical confrontation with their anti-fa communist idiots out beating up women everywhere.
[1:10:10.160 --> 1:10:16.920]  They're the ones looking for it, ladies and gentlemen, running their mouths trying to
[1:10:16.920 --> 1:10:26.680]  destroy this country, telling those of us that actually defend the republic and don't compromise
[1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:32.640]  that we are foreign agents of Russia, congressional hearings where they say Alex Jones, a criminal
[1:10:32.640 --> 1:10:39.760]  investigation being directed by Russia, we believe he's being, do I get subpoenaed anytime
[1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:43.640]  in the past if they were going to have somebody from the federal government, from the board
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:52.200]  of governors of the federal elections commission and the FCC testifying the armed services
[1:10:52.200 --> 1:11:00.320]  committee, I would get a subpoena and I would testify the next day or the day before, not
[1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:08.000]  now, they just say, yeah, another risky agent Alex Jones and that's meant to intimidate
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:13.160]  everybody, a bunch of globalist traders, a bunch of scum trying to set up world government,
[1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:16.840]  trying to transfer our sovereignty overseas, trying to sell out all of our weapons systems
[1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:22.920]  to China, you're going to point your finger at me with no evidence because I don't want
[1:11:22.920 --> 1:11:27.440]  to have war with Russia because geopolitically they're not a threat and then you're going
[1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:33.680]  to tell me I'm a traitor, no, you're the traitor and you are the enemy and you are the ones
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:37.000]  that need to be investigated and you are the ones that need to be arrested because you're
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:43.120]  globalist stuges at those big multinational combined consortium groups and think tanks
[1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:47.680]  you go to where you sit there with all your interface to groups inside governments and
[1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:52.440]  corporations making sweetheart deals inside or trading and everything else to screw this
[1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:59.000]  country over and parlay our power into your world government, I got news for you, you're
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:07.120]  the enemy and the world is learning about it very, very fast. So I think Trump needs
[1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:13.640]  to go on the offense and this is a breath of fresh air after his adjuncts telling him
[1:12:13.640 --> 1:12:18.040]  to sign on to that horrible healthcare bill, we got a better one now. He's done some bad
[1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:22.480]  things overall some great things. So I'm backing Trump but do you agree with me or disagree?
[1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:27.080]  He's got to go on the offense. He's got to go on the offense aggressively because it's
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:31.720]  his duty these people have committed crimes and they're openly in New Yorker magazine
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:36.800]  everywhere else trying to organize an overthrow of the president. They're trying to have his
[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:40.800]  own cabinet declaring him mentally unsound because he actually won't sell out to them
[1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:46.240]  and he's not a yes man. He is the 40th president of the United States and is actually executing
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:59.120]  faithfully his duties. I look at these arrogant clappers and arrogant Brennan's, the Wahhabist
[1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:03.520]  Brennan two days before the president gets in he says watch your mouth president and
[1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:08.760]  he couldn't believe he got fired when Trump fired him. These people are out of their minds.
[1:13:08.760 --> 1:13:15.520]  We didn't elect Brennan. We didn't elect Comey. We're not going to have you sit here like
[1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:22.360]  a bunch of Chihuahuas barking at the bull mastiff and telling it you're the boss. We
[1:13:22.360 --> 1:13:31.200]  didn't elect you Chihuahua, toy poodle whatever it is you are. You're so delusional Comey
[1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:34.440]  and Brennan everybody else you just think you're going to run your mouth all day and
[1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:39.200]  sell this country out we're going to sit there and take it. We're done. We elected president
[1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:47.680]  Trump. He can do whatever he wants down constitutionally with Russia. All he's doing is put more troops
[1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:57.360]  on their borders and cutting off their energy supply. Oh he's a Russian agent right? That's
[1:13:57.360 --> 1:14:06.800]  the right thing to do to cut our competitors energy off. See the globalists had our energy
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:12.560]  cut off didn't they? That's why the Russians and other people are giving so much money
[1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:17.080]  to the Democrats along with General Electric and others to make sure they all could have
[1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:22.240]  their cheap power and sell their energy and we couldn't. Oh I'm sorry Trump kind of messed
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:28.520]  that deal up didn't he? Because he's a Russian agent. That cost Russia some estimates for
[1:14:28.520 --> 1:14:37.280]  three trillion dollars in the next decade. Donald Trump took Russia and slammed its head
[1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:40.560]  up against the wall and it's sitting there on the ground and then you sit there like
[1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:45.720]  a bunch of traitors and say he's the traitor you're idiots. You're scum. You're the scum
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:50.640]  of the earth when you sit there and see somebody executing faithfully as the president of
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:56.480]  the United States and all these traitors and all the scum and all their followers and all
[1:14:56.480 --> 1:15:04.440]  their dumb minions are saying kill our president and go after Alex Jones and all this crap.
[1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:11.800]  School teachers calling for me to be killed because I'm informed. I'm dedicated. I'm focused.
[1:15:11.800 --> 1:15:17.600]  I know what I'm talking about and I'm mentally ill just like Trump because I don't want to
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:21.520]  go join some big combine and screw everybody over. I actually believe in humanity. I actually
[1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:35.800]  believe in being honorable. I just can't believe how scummy this country's gotten. I love this
[1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:48.920]  country but I look at the scum. I look at the trash that infest Congress and I see Biden
[1:15:48.920 --> 1:15:53.560]  shooting his mouth off about the Russians. When his son took over the gas fields that
[1:15:53.560 --> 1:16:06.320]  Russia controls into Ukraine, just stole it. See, it's one thing to turn our call back
[1:16:06.320 --> 1:16:13.720]  on for Americans advantage. If that hurts Russia, sorry, this is our land, our gas.
[1:16:13.720 --> 1:16:17.980]  We're competing. It's not personal but you send in George Soros and people to steal the
[1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:25.400]  Russian gas lines coming in to the Ukraine and then just take over the gas and then put
[1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:32.840]  the snot-nosed son of Joe Biden in charge of it. That's disgusting. It's like Yunker,
[1:16:32.840 --> 1:16:41.760]  the heir to the entire Nazi fortune, the number two Nazi family, German royalty, his
[1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:55.000]  father. His grandfather took over Luxembourg and their family owns it and controls it today.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:01.040]  He's like the king of Luxembourg. That's who's the head of the EU, unelected, running his
[1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:05.240]  mouth about how they'll overthrow Trump. People go, they laugh. Hell, they control our media,
[1:17:05.240 --> 1:17:18.400]  the big banks, federal reserves, mainly owned by European banks. These people are out of
[1:17:18.400 --> 1:17:26.320]  control. Harry and Pennsylvania, thanks for holding, Harry, you're on the air.
[1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:33.440]  Yeah, hi, Alex. Well, first time caller. Love the products. I got a Trump Pence 2020
[1:17:33.440 --> 1:17:37.320]  shirt and I got a lot of crazy looks when I walk outside with it. It's all about exercise
[1:17:37.320 --> 1:17:42.440]  and free speech. Absolutely. But anyway, I want to get to my Komi firing. This has been
[1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:49.360]  a long time coming and he's been using his stance as the FBI director to use that leverage
[1:17:49.360 --> 1:17:54.600]  to keep the Trump administration in place, just like you say, to keep him paralyzed.
[1:17:54.600 --> 1:18:02.200]  He was doing it just like Senator Reid was doing. Here's the inside intel. The FBI leadership
[1:18:02.200 --> 1:18:07.200]  is deep state control that has been basically trying to blackmail Trump with made up info
[1:18:07.200 --> 1:18:11.440]  to submit to their foreign policy and their operations. And Trump just said, I had enough
[1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:16.360]  of this crap. This whole fake news, Russian inclusion thing was the perfect thing that
[1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:21.680]  fell into his lap to keep him down. So he was just straight along saying, well, we're
[1:18:21.680 --> 1:18:25.720]  still investigating, we're still investigating just to keep it in, to keep it in place so
[1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:29.200]  he can. That's right. And now he wanted more money for it, even though they've admitted
[1:18:29.200 --> 1:18:35.640]  it in a year of investigation, nothing. There's nothing. There's nothing there. It's a house
[1:18:35.640 --> 1:18:39.760]  of card. It's all crumbling down. And now we have to find out who the leakers are. We
[1:18:39.760 --> 1:18:45.280]  have to look at Susan Rice, Sally Yates, um, Barack Obama, it's a whack-a-mole. Who is
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:50.400]  the leaker now Trump can sick his attack dogs on them and let it lose the next next year
[1:18:50.400 --> 1:18:55.880]  is going to be really fun to watch. No, I agree. He's got to move quickly and just come
[1:18:55.880 --> 1:19:02.880]  out and say, here's the evidence, Hillary, Podesta, Thomas, Chinese, Russia, uh, grand
[1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:09.480]  jury, start indicting them and go, Oh, I'm Nixonian. No, I'm a hundred times worse. Nixon
[1:19:09.480 --> 1:19:13.880]  didn't do anything. Nixon got set up by the deep state to be removed so they could run
[1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:19.600]  everything. We've basically had kept presidents ever since. That's all about the end. Yeah,
[1:19:19.600 --> 1:19:23.960]  the staff is all being shaken up and they just can't handle it. But that's pretty much
[1:19:23.960 --> 1:19:28.600]  why what I wanted to say, um, I've been thinking things have been going crazy for a couple
[1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:31.960]  of years, but I've been watching you for right a year. And since I've been watching
[1:19:31.960 --> 1:19:36.440]  you, it really has been open my eyes and stuff. So, um, I'm just, we got to keep on fighting
[1:19:36.440 --> 1:19:41.480]  the info war. Well, thank you so much, Harry. Yeah, everybody should get their Trump pants
[1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:44.640]  or Trump is my president. We have a new Trump is my president. Uh, Navy blue shirt looks
[1:19:44.640 --> 1:19:50.680]  great. And it's about exercising free speech. It's about being a, you know, winner. Patriot
[1:19:50.680 --> 1:19:54.640]  not just a sunshine patriot and just continuing to march forward and exercise free speech
[1:19:54.640 --> 1:20:00.920]  and trigger all the libtards. We'll be right back. Stay with us. This is Michael David

[1:23:03.560 --> 1:23:08.160]  may be near. Think about it. Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions
[1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:12.720]  from Russia and North Korea. Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to
[1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:17.000]  looting of stores and city shutdowns. And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:21.720]  grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack. When the chaos from
[1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:26.120]  any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread
[1:23:26.120 --> 1:23:30.960]  national emergency. That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance. That's where

[1:23:57.040 --> 1:24:12.880]  All right, let's continue to go through your phone call. I just feel so good right now.
[1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:18.800]  I watch Comey let Hillary get away with murder, Obama get away with just crimes that are
[1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:22.200]  unbelievable. And then always run his mouth with that Eddie Haskell good boy, leave it
[1:24:22.200 --> 1:24:34.680]  to Beaver Act. Oh, jolly gee, Mrs. Cleaver. Oh, Lordy, Lordy. Oh, I'm so nice. We're done
[1:24:34.680 --> 1:24:41.880]  having this country run in the ground. And the traders have been in charge so long that
[1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:49.360]  they're so arrogant that I think they're going to boss a president around with made-up Russia
[1:24:49.360 --> 1:24:57.400]  ties and shoot their mouths off about killing the president and the Secret Service and the
[1:24:57.400 --> 1:25:05.280]  FBI aren't allowed under their bureaucracy to do anything. I've had guests say mild things
[1:25:05.280 --> 1:25:09.960]  about Obama and had the Secret Service show up here. The Secret Service has probably been
[1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:17.720]  here six, seven times over the years. They've been here with subpoenas when somebody on
[1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:25.160]  the message board makes a comment about killing Obama. That was back when we ran our own comments.
[1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:30.160]  I do it a third party site now so they can deal with the subpoenas. And then I look at
[1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:33.800]  like the millions and millions. I guess they can't do anything. It was just so many. The
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:39.800]  media led the way with threaten the president, kill the president. I've had my cruise in
[1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:46.200]  Ferguson and in Austin and in Dallas and in New York and in LA and in Bakersfield just
[1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:53.720]  everywhere and they're just there going oink, oink, bang, bang. How many cops? Five is good.
[1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:59.320]  No, six is better. Seven is better. Bang, bang, kill the cops and buses of offloaded college
[1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:02.960]  students, a bunch of white ones getting off saying, debt the halls of dead cops. And again,
[1:26:02.960 --> 1:26:07.000]  I don't like worship cops, but it was just any group. Let's kill firefighters. Let's
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:12.080]  kill teachers. It's like, what? I mean, I have to tell you, when I see people organizing
[1:26:12.080 --> 1:26:18.920]  saying randomly kill people, I start thinking about that's an armed force against me. I
[1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:24.840]  start, you know, as a man, I start, we'll start turning like that's an enemy. And then they
[1:26:24.840 --> 1:26:29.600]  sit there running their mouths, how they want to kill patriots all day long. These people
[1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:34.040]  don't think we're not. We actually build businesses. We actually hire people. We actually work
[1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:39.400]  17, 18 hours a day. We actually built this country and all you slap, jod, wimps and
[1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:43.480]  communists and dumbasses think you're going to keep running your mouth forever. You keep
[1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:47.800]  running your mouth. You're going to run it right into six feet under. And that didn't
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:53.640]  talk. You see what we've done politically. You sit here and push it much longer. Oh,
[1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:57.720]  the physical action is not going to come from me. It's going to come from your actions and
[1:26:57.720 --> 1:27:03.200]  you're going to get knocked upside your head. The betas always need that, don't they? They
[1:27:03.200 --> 1:27:08.920]  always take alphas being restrained as weakness until you find out. And then you wish you
[1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:16.480]  hadn't got kicked upside the head by a horse. The sad part about this is there's no pleasure
[1:27:16.480 --> 1:27:20.900]  in killing you. There's no pleasure in running you over. There's no pleasure in defeating
[1:27:20.900 --> 1:27:28.560]  you because you're scum. Just get out of the way. Keep enjoying the civilization that the
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:34.600]  Patriots built and stop bitching. But I know you want that ride of passage. You want to
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:47.840]  piss on your betas. You have criminal energy. I know. And so just keep pushing. Keep pushing
[1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:55.920]  because once you pass the demarcation line, once you've gone past the point of return,
[1:27:55.920 --> 1:28:05.280]  once you've hit the event horizon, just remember you asked for it because you start a war.
[1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:11.560]  It's one that we will finish. Make no mistake, dumbasses. All right, let's go ahead and
[1:28:11.560 --> 1:28:18.400]  talk to Adam in New York. Get on the air. Hi, Alex. Hey, brother. Thanks for holding.
[1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:23.000]  Hi. Thank you for taking my call. I just want to thank you and everybody in force for everything
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:26.040]  you guys do. Thank you.
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:30.760]  I think Trump firing Comey is really positive for him. And I think it's just really good
[1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:34.920]  for truth and liberty in general. Maybe like Ben was saying, we can get an investigation
[1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:41.680]  of Hillary and maybe Epstein and Podesta. Absolutely. Definitely think what you were
[1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:47.160]  saying. Trump needs to go on the attack. And maybe I'm just being a little too optimistic.
[1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:51.920]  But I think this is a victory or maybe an opportunity for the N4. I think with the left
[1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:56.760]  right now, I know they've got their shields out trying to do some damage control on this.
[1:28:56.760 --> 1:29:01.520]  But right now I feel like their hypocrisy is like really on display, just kind of nakedly.
[1:29:01.520 --> 1:29:06.400]  Just like you were saying earlier, they're calling for Comey to be fired just not that
[1:29:06.400 --> 1:29:12.320]  long ago, even as early as like last week. And now they're, you know, just overreacting
[1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:13.320]  with Trump firing.
[1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:19.120]  That's right. Last week, Hillary said, or just two weeks ago, she said, oh, it's Comey's
[1:29:19.120 --> 1:29:22.880]  fault. He needs to be fired. And then they've said it hundreds of times everywhere. And
[1:29:22.880 --> 1:29:26.800]  now they're like, oh my God, it's horrible. You fired him. They think we're goldfish,
[1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:31.800]  don't they? Exactly. It's like, hold on, stay there. I've got Martin Moreno coming up.
[1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:34.640]  I want to get through some of your calls. So we'll get Mark on about 10 minutes. I'm
[1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:38.000]  going to go to Adam, Robert, Beth and a few others. And then we're going to get Martin
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  Moreno on here. But you're making some great points, Adam. I don't want to cut you short.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:45.840]  We'll be right back in three minutes. I'm Alex Jones. This is the info war. We're going
[1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:53.040]  to go on the offense now, we're going to lose. We're on the March, the empires on the run.
[1:29:53.040 --> 1:30:02.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Last week, info wars.com published the article,
[1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:06.680]  bombshell study proves unvaccinated children are healthier than vaccinated children. The
[1:30:06.680 --> 1:30:10.960]  two studies were pulled from the Journal of Transitional Science without any explanation.
[1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:16.320]  The studies surveyed parents of 666 homeschooled children, 39% who were not vaccinated. When
[1:30:16.320 --> 1:30:21.680]  asked about allergies, 22% of vaccinated children were shown to have allergies, while only 6.9%
[1:30:21.680 --> 1:30:27.480]  were unvaccinated autism, 4.7% were vaccinated versus 1% unvaccinated. So of course there's
[1:30:27.480 --> 1:30:31.400]  going to be pushback when a study like this comes out proving that vaccines are not really
[1:30:31.400 --> 1:30:34.400]  safe. And people are going to come out and attack it and say, Oh, they just talked to
[1:30:34.400 --> 1:30:38.360]  parents or they'll say, Oh, there was a bias in the study. These people think vaccines
[1:30:38.360 --> 1:30:42.680]  are unsafe. One, the study proves they're unsafe. And two, any other vaccine study is
[1:30:42.680 --> 1:30:47.320]  done and paid for by the pharmaceutical companies. Of course they think vaccines are safe. Just
[1:30:47.320 --> 1:30:51.240]  go to our article, bombshell study proves unvaccinated children are healthier. We have
[1:30:51.240 --> 1:30:55.000]  archive links to the studies and you can see for yourself because drug companies will do
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:58.840]  anything to keep you from the truth. Rob Dew reporting for info wars.com and info wars

[1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:33.120]  you do, please spread the word. You know, one of our Chicago affiliates talked about
[1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:39.400]  Matt Dubio last week talked about how they offered him like a half million dollars. Sounds
[1:34:39.400 --> 1:34:44.960]  like a lot. It's not in talk radio to pay for things to kick my show off here. And that's
[1:34:44.960 --> 1:34:51.400]  what stations get those calls. We've been on that station like six years now in Chicago.
[1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:57.360]  And he said, you know, he said, it doesn't come up the level of what he loses, not selling
[1:34:57.360 --> 1:35:02.480]  us out, but he says he gets $100, $1,000 checks, you know, every month people send him understanding
[1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:06.000]  it's expensive to run a radio station and to do all this and to put a show like mine
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:10.760]  on. But that's why so many stations continue because they get ratings. You just don't get
[1:35:10.760 --> 1:35:16.080]  the big corporate sponsors. So local businesses need to need a sponsor or you don't let local
[1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:19.760]  sponsors know while you're supporting them and you need to make donations. Just, you
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:22.880]  know, put it in your calendar to send them a hundred bucks. If you got the money, look,
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:27.000]  if people that are new or reached middle class or wealthy, if you keep holding on to all
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:31.240]  your money, we're going to lose everything. I mean, imagine if we get this tax cut of
[1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:40.760]  15, 20% again, you spend a little bit of money, you get a lot back. This is a war, people.
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:43.960]  That's why I take the money that comes in. I just expand, expand, expand, expand and
[1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:48.680]  we're changing the world. It's the greatest value I've got in my life is fighting tyranny.
[1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:53.280]  That's my great possession. That's the great reward is knowing we're not sellouts. We're
[1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:59.240]  good people finishing up Adam about Comey and the FBI termination. Go ahead.
[1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:03.880]  I just want to read or what you were just saying there, Alex. Right now with the left,
[1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:08.680]  with their hypocrisy on display, I think it's an opportunity for the M4. The listeners,
[1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:11.720]  I think we need to strike while the iron is hot and just get the word out there about
[1:36:11.720 --> 1:36:17.880]  the broadcast and just keep red filling people because they can see the hypocrisy. So we
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:21.000]  just need to keep supporting the broadcast and get the word out there.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  Absolutely. God bless you. Yeah, I've, I mean, I read what comes out of the Trump administration.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.240]  I'll just watch the news says what they put out the minutes of these meetings so they're
[1:36:28.240 --> 1:36:33.840]  transparent. You got rid of all the lobbyists. Nobody's done that in 50 years. Just so many
[1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:39.360]  promises he fulfilled. And there's just no thing about it. We got coal. It's clean. We're
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:47.600]  going to use it. Carbon tax was put in by stealth is over. And just hundreds of billions
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:51.320]  of dollars have been spent trying to put this in place globally because it would raise $15
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:58.880]  trillion a year. That's how goers global carbon tax. He wants a tax on productivity attacks
[1:36:58.880 --> 1:37:04.440]  on the West. Trump just blew all that away, ladies and gentlemen. By the way, he doesn't
[1:37:04.440 --> 1:37:08.600]  want carbon taxes on Russia either, but he said, sorry, Russia are cold back on the table.
[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:13.320]  Now they're cold. Their gas is less valued. He was a Russian agent. He wouldn't do that.
[1:37:13.320 --> 1:37:19.400]  But he's also trying to block Russia being able to sell oil and gas and coal. So he's
[1:37:19.400 --> 1:37:23.640]  just bringing free market back. It's a big, big deal. We're going to go to Robert in North
[1:37:23.640 --> 1:37:28.880]  Carolina and Beth in Virginia and others just bam, bam, bam into the next hour. But I wanted
[1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:33.840]  to get Mark Moreno on from climatedepot.com along with Lord Mock, too. And he works closely
[1:37:33.840 --> 1:37:39.280]  with it. It's the leading, leading side out there exposing this global fraud. We also
[1:37:39.280 --> 1:37:43.040]  carry his new film that they tried to have him arrested for for premiering in Paris last
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:49.560]  year is a film on the whole climate hustle. I know you know all about this, but show it
[1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:54.160]  to your high school, show it to your church, show it. This is documented. So we have Inconvenient
[1:37:54.160 --> 1:37:58.400]  Truth part one, 2006, polar bears can't swim. They're all dying. Their numbers are up five
[1:37:58.400 --> 1:38:05.600]  fold. You've got all these lies going on. The ice caps will be totally melted. The Arctic
[1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:11.920]  and Antarctic by 2013 total bull. So he joins us to talk about this. I read the synopsis
[1:38:11.920 --> 1:38:17.440]  of it and seen the ad where Al Gore is the savior of the earth in his new, uh, inconvenient
[1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:24.480]  load of manure part two, inconvenient part two. And it's literally fiction showing video
[1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:29.080]  animations of drowning in a polar bears in the first one. Now the second one is even
[1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:33.520]  crazier. Everybody knows lower Manhattan floods every decade or so with a hurricane. Hurricanes
[1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:37.760]  are down by, you know, some of the lows since the 60s or whatever, but that's why they have
[1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:43.400]  a slurry wall and drains there. Cause it, it floods. It's always been flooding and that's
[1:38:43.400 --> 1:38:48.360]  what happens because he used to be a swamp flooding out from the river. And so now it's
[1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:54.200]  sinking like New Orleans, but they just say, I predicted it would flood and it did. Yeah,
[1:38:54.200 --> 1:38:59.520]  that's why it's a giant slurry wall and a giant area that drains the water out. So it's
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:03.800]  just total lies, but he's the expert on it. He can break it down. Mark Moreno, former top
[1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:09.080]  advisor to the Senate, uh, on this whole deal. Uh, so, so what is the latest, my friend?
[1:39:09.080 --> 1:39:14.320]  Well, first of all, Alex, you're absolutely right. Al Gore claimed I was right. New York
[1:39:14.320 --> 1:39:19.520]  flooded like I predicted Al Gore predicted half of Florida would permanently be underwater.
[1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:25.640]  New York city would permanently be underwater. And as his defense, he uses the one hurricane,
[1:39:25.640 --> 1:39:29.720]  which wasn't even, uh, you know, classified as a major. It was a big hurricane and bad
[1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:35.000]  hurricane Sandy, but we've gone now since 2005 without a category three or larger hurricane
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:40.440]  making landfall. They're actually in record low numbers and decline in hurricanes. So
[1:39:40.440 --> 1:39:46.320]  he uses that one flood from a hurricane, which as you noted, Alex is completely ex expected
[1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:50.960]  to prove that he was right. Uh, it's kind of like saying like Barbara Boxer did one time
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:55.880]  in the Senate, uh, when they had literally, this is no joke. They had tornadoes in Oklahoma
[1:39:55.880 --> 1:40:01.120]  one day in 2013. And her and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island went down to
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:05.800]  the Senate floor and said, this is what we warned you about with climate change. What
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:11.480]  did there would be tornadoes in tornado alley, the level of stupidity and moronic science
[1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:16.480]  that they present. And by the way, they present, they touted their carbon tax as a solution
[1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:21.160]  to tornadoes in tornado alley. You know, uh, what's next?
[1:40:21.160 --> 1:40:26.360]  That's what people 150 years ago and springs or something. I mean, this is how low level
[1:40:26.360 --> 1:40:31.160]  the science has become from the manmade climate change promoters. You're right. And for those
[1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:35.200]  that don't live in Texas, his tornado alley ends right here at Austin. Sometimes it goes
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:39.600]  to San Antonio, but it goes right through Oklahoma into Kansas. That's why they have
[1:40:39.600 --> 1:40:43.840]  storm sellers all over the place in Texas and Kansas and Oklahoma, because sometimes
[1:40:43.840 --> 1:40:49.040]  you'll turn on the news and there'll be 50 tornadoes, you know, in a hundred mile stretch.
[1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:53.080]  I mean, when I was a kid in Dallas routinely, we lived on a hill over the lake and we'd
[1:40:53.080 --> 1:40:57.800]  look out and see tornadoes coming across the lake and then turning into water spouts.
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:41:03.240]  I mean, I just grew up seeing tornadoes all the time, but, but oh, it's totally new.
[1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:06.240]  It's totally new, Mark. Oh, and by the way, you know, I did at climate
[1:41:06.240 --> 1:41:11.720]  depot just did a whole report. Extreme weather tornadoes five years in a row at or near record
[1:41:11.720 --> 1:41:16.560]  lows last year by the record low since the night since records began in the 1950s, keeping
[1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:21.960]  count of these big tornadoes down significantly, hurricanes, floods, droughts, either declining
[1:41:21.960 --> 1:41:27.760]  or no. Is that because the sun sunspots sunspots down weather fail? Why is it down? According
[1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:32.620]  to the astrophysicists, the sunspots, right? It can be sunspots, natural cycles, people
[1:41:32.620 --> 1:41:36.840]  aren't even sure what we do. What we are sure of is it's not getting worse. Al Gore still
[1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:40.520]  goes around and says every night on the news is like a nature walk through the book of
[1:41:40.520 --> 1:41:46.440]  revelations. No, it's not. It's not, not even close. And of course, you know, temperature
[1:41:46.440 --> 1:41:51.600]  and polar, by the way, polar bears are the highest numbers ever reported this year in
[1:41:51.600 --> 1:41:53.560]  the history of polar bear counting.
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:57.200]  Aren't they five times what they were according to Smithsonian Institute, what they were in
[1:41:57.200 --> 1:42:03.960]  the 50s? Five times? Five times. We're actually now up to over 30,000, 29,000. Some estimates
[1:42:03.960 --> 1:42:09.240]  were over 30,000. We started with about five to 10,000 estimates back in the 1950s. A lot
[1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:13.600]  of it's due to a hunting ban, but it just goes to show you they're not threatened by
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:17.120]  global warming. They're threatened by predictions of the future.
[1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:21.240]  In fact, one of, I took a trip to Greenland with the US Senate and actually argued with
[1:42:21.240 --> 1:42:25.360]  one of the scientists. And I said the greatest threat polar bears face are the electrons
[1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:30.320]  in the hard drives of the modelers predicting doom. In other words, it's not reality. It's
[1:42:30.320 --> 1:42:34.360]  just their computers are predicting doom. This is what they do over and over.
[1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:40.920]  Also, as you know, a bunch of environmentalists came out and said Fukushima was because of
[1:42:40.920 --> 1:42:46.440]  global warming. Earthquakes, no one's ever claimed that earthquakes are caused. That's
[1:42:46.440 --> 1:42:49.560]  caused by tectonic shift.
[1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:53.440]  Don't say no one's ever claimed Alex because literally every malady you can think of from
[1:42:53.440 --> 1:42:58.200]  rape, bar room brawls, prostitution has been blamed on global warming, airline turbulence.
[1:42:58.200 --> 1:43:03.600]  And yes, tsunamis, earthquakes have been blamed on global warming, I believe by United Nations
[1:43:03.600 --> 1:43:04.600]  scientists.
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:07.160]  No, I know. I mean, obviously no one's serious, everything they can.
[1:43:07.160 --> 1:43:10.040]  Well, sure. And of course, some people that don't know, I mean, you just mentioned it.
[1:43:10.040 --> 1:43:13.840]  They're claiming Muslims running around murdering everybody is climate change.
[1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:14.840]  Yes.
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:20.600]  In fact, the interesting thing about the Muslims, they're blaming the Syrian civil war on climate
[1:43:20.600 --> 1:43:24.120]  change because of the drought. Keep in mind, the drought is actually, I believe it was
[1:43:24.120 --> 1:43:28.600]  a 60 year trend is actually going to global decline and drought, a drought, according
[1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:34.240]  to extreme weather expert Dr. Roger Pilkey Jr. But having said that, they blame the
[1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:37.040]  drought in Syria for the rise of ISIS.
[1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:42.760]  And the problem with that is, Syria's always had drought. In 1933, the Muslim government
[1:43:42.760 --> 1:43:49.920]  in Syria banned the yo-yo because they thought it created drought. Now, in 2017, we have
[1:43:49.920 --> 1:43:54.980]  yo-yos trying to ban the SUV and American energy because they think it causes bad weather
[1:43:54.980 --> 1:43:55.980]  and global warming.
[1:43:55.980 --> 1:43:58.640]  They have not advanced as a culture.
[1:43:58.640 --> 1:44:02.440]  All right. Now, you and Lord Moncton are on the front lines of this. And I know we're
[1:44:02.440 --> 1:44:07.040]  winning because of the hacked emails, high the decline six years ago, seven years ago,
[1:44:07.040 --> 1:44:10.640]  how Tom flies and all the evidence coming out. They've gone from global freezing to global
[1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:13.600]  warming. Now they say climate change. Well, of course, climate change is happening. It's
[1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:18.040]  just not anthropogenic. Even their fake models say we're like, what, half the percent of
[1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:22.400]  any change. So where are they going now? Because as you've said many times, we're winning the
[1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:26.900]  intellectual battle, but they're still bureaucratically in charge and they just don't care. They're
[1:44:26.900 --> 1:44:30.760]  rolling forward. How is Trump affecting that? Because we've got Trump turning the cold back
[1:44:30.760 --> 1:44:32.120]  on all these great things.
[1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:37.360]  But then we've got Ivanka, who I didn't elect. I'd love her hanging out with Merkel and saying,
[1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:42.360]  I'm going to get daddy to stop this. And then you've got Bill Maher saying she's giving
[1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:45.520]  him hand jobs and stuff. I mean, this has reached a new level.
[1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:52.080]  Yeah. I try to get involved in that. You're sort of the palace intrigue of Ivanka and
[1:44:52.080 --> 1:44:56.480]  what's happening there. I firmly believe that Donald Trump is going to do the right thing.
[1:44:56.480 --> 1:45:00.640]  Keep his campaign promise and keep his political philosophy. People have said, oh, he's been
[1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:04.320]  all over the place. If you go back to the 1980s, look at his Oprah Winfrey interviews.
[1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:09.440]  He was not a globalist. He was a nationalist. He was America first. And I don't see how
[1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:14.640]  Donald Trump could stay in a United Nations climate treaty if those views which he's held
[1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:22.000]  consistent since at least the 1980s come true. And he will not. I can't imagine him not withdrawing
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:25.760]  from this. Now, there might be different methods by which he does it. He could submit it to
[1:45:25.760 --> 1:45:30.400]  the Senate. He could withdraw from the United Nations process. He could just try to cancel
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:35.120]  the treaty specifically. And that remains to be seen. But I do not see us going forward
[1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:38.800]  with this treaty, regardless of what his daughter did. But here's the thing. You asked me where
[1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:42.800]  they go from here. I just came from, I went to the March for Science and I went to the
[1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:47.280]  People's Climate March attending it. And I was outed. I didn't even know I was in as
[1:45:47.280 --> 1:45:51.600]  the old Seinfeld episode said they outed me. They've denied me press credentials. They
[1:45:51.600 --> 1:45:56.240]  actually tried to deny me. This is a bizarre story. Coffee creamer. I'm not making this up.
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:00.800]  But there was a guy in the VIP area. We finally argued and got our press credentials late. They
[1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:04.000]  made us wait about an hour and a half. We missed a lot of the interviews. We went into the press
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:08.960]  area at this People's Climate March in Washington, D.C. And this guy would go around and out me to
[1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:13.040]  all the politicians. There was Senator Whitehouse and others whispering in their air. The hand was,
[1:46:13.040 --> 1:46:17.040]  this guy's a climate denier. This guy's a climate denier trying to shut down all my interviews.
[1:46:17.040 --> 1:46:22.000]  I went over to the coffee table, which is for the media, had a cup of black coffee and they
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:26.400]  were all nice to me. And the guy came up and said, he's a climate denier. And they tried to deny me
[1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:30.560]  and they did deny me coffee cream. I had to argue with them. And finally, I said, you're gonna deny
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:34.320]  me coffee cream because I don't agree with you on global warming. And finally, they actually
[1:46:34.320 --> 1:46:40.640]  handed over the two creams I was requesting for my coffee. That's how petty and authoritarian
[1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:44.400]  these guys are. Just denied coffee. They don't work for it. It's cold. At the same time, they
[1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:48.480]  want to throw you in jail as Bill Nye and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others have advocated. Oh,
[1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:53.920]  that's why I wanted to get you on. Not just about Al Gore's new BS film coming out,
[1:46:53.920 --> 1:46:59.600]  Inconvenient Lodabaloney Part Two. Bill Nye, as I'm sure you know, they've edited on Netflix,
[1:46:59.600 --> 1:47:05.840]  his old TV show from the 90s, where it shows a woman explaining the genders. And they're now
[1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:09.920]  saying chromosomes don't cause it and science isn't real. So they have this movement called
[1:47:09.920 --> 1:47:15.120]  science is real. Arrest Martin Moreno, attorney generals are meeting, arrest Alex Jones. I've
[1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:19.680]  not reached that famed club. I'm very honored. These people are crazy. I mean, they're now
[1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:26.080]  saying male and female doesn't exist. What is going on here? Well, you're absolutely right. In 1996,
[1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:32.160]  Bill Nye's Netflix show, which by the way, I could attest to his rock star status among people under,
[1:47:32.160 --> 1:47:37.760]  say, age 28 or 25. Last year in Central Park, when I interviewed Bill Nye, we were surrounded
[1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:43.120]  by about 30, 40 high school kids and older who just view him as a celebrity because they grew up
[1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:47.280]  in public schools watching these videos. And one of the things he watched was 1996,
[1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:51.440]  where Bill Nye talks about chromosomes and talks about how they determine whether you're a boy or
[1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:59.760]  a girl. Guess what? Fast forward to 2017, gender fluidity. Not only does Bill Nye show up dancing,
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:04.240]  ice cream sexuality, and I'm not making that up. He's actually dancing to this song and this group
[1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:11.120]  that's trying to promote this gender fluidity. Bill Nye unilaterally changed the science that
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:16.880]  he once promoted and now says that there is no way we can determine sexuality. It's very complicated
[1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:21.360]  and it's no longer science-based. According to Bill Nye, the alleged science guy.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:27.680]  That's right. Just ignore nature and then claim that nurture is overpowering that. That's just
[1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:32.000]  denying the laws of gravity. And it just shows they're all day saying we're denying science.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:36.560]  They're all day saying you should be arrested, you know, to your face. And then he's sitting there
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:42.720]  saying chromosomes don't affect the gender. I mean, this is unbelievable. Yes. And not only did he
[1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:48.000]  get, he was the headliner at the March for Science in Washington, DC, along with a guy named Michael
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:51.920]  Mann. If you remember that, you just referenced it earlier, Alex. The Climate Gate scandal. This
[1:48:51.920 --> 1:48:57.280]  is the guy who was the lead United Nations author who was caught in the emails asking people to
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:02.160]  delete files. Hide the decline. Freedom of Information Act requests, or at least it certainly appeared
[1:49:02.160 --> 1:49:10.320]  that way. And he appeared with Bill Nye. Bill Nye, at this March, the morning of it went on TV to
[1:49:10.320 --> 1:49:15.600]  debate Will Harper, a man who's done over 200 peer-reviewed science publications. He's a legend
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:21.920]  at Harvard, a physicist who's a climate dissenter, a climate skeptic. Bill Nye had the audacity to
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:28.640]  insult him and tell CNN they had no business featuring this renowned scientist on the air
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:33.920]  because they should not be allowed to debate global warming. He was trying to shut down someone
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:40.800]  who Bill Nye couldn't even come close to mimicking any of his credentials, Will Harper.
[1:49:40.800 --> 1:49:44.160]  And so Bill Nye is trying to stifle the debate. He's trying to change.
[1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:51.360]  Let's get the opposite of science. He can't debate us at chromosomes. Exactly. He can't debate us at
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:56.320]  chromosomes to the sex. So he just doesn't want to debate us. He just says, oh, forget the scientists.
[1:49:56.320 --> 1:50:00.240]  I don't want to have them on about climate change. Just no, no, he's not real. I'm Bill Nye. I'm
[1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:06.080]  Royal. Shut him up. Arrest Mark Moreno. Yes. In fact, when I interviewed him, I asked him
[1:50:06.080 --> 1:50:10.880]  specifically for the climate hustle film, what about Robert F. Kennedy called people to be jailed?
[1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:17.040]  Bill Nye had no problem with jailing climate skeptics. And you asked me where this is going
[1:50:17.040 --> 1:50:23.040]  with the next step. At this people's climate march and these marches where Bill Nye attended,
[1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:27.840]  they have attorney generals in the United States from Democratic states. And the new tactic, Alex,
[1:50:27.840 --> 1:50:31.920]  this is what they're going after. You have a tornado in Oklahoma. You have a hurricane here.
[1:50:31.920 --> 1:50:36.880]  You have a severe storm. You have flooding in Tennessee. They are now, these attorney generals
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:43.040]  are going to start going after energy companies as a shakedown and say you caused and made this bad

[1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:04.560]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:09.520]  before it became a loss to our modern diets a processed junk. We are now introducing Caveman

[1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:35.200]  the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used
[1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:41.200]  the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow
[1:52:41.200 --> 1:52:46.400]  that produces the blood for the body. This is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from

[1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:09.680]  Waging war on corruption. Passing through the lies and disinformation. Mike Cernovich is coming up
[1:54:09.680 --> 1:54:13.440]  after I go to Robert and Beth and a few others that have been holding the longest but I'll continue
[1:54:13.440 --> 1:54:18.320]  with your calls in the next hour. Then Cernovich will host the fourth hour about to launch a bunch
[1:54:18.320 --> 1:54:21.600]  of new live shows on radio TV here in the next few months so get ready for that.
[1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:25.360]  We're just beta testing it all right now. We've got to expand what we're doing in the face of
[1:54:25.360 --> 1:54:30.080]  the globalist. Mark Moreno is our guest folks. I know our audience most of you know that
[1:54:30.080 --> 1:54:34.880]  man-made climate change is made up and it's a scam for carbon taxes okay. The public still
[1:54:34.880 --> 1:54:39.280]  doesn't get it. They're brainwashing kids in schools. Lord Monkton and Moreno have made them
[1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:43.280]  pull it out of schools in the UK because inconvenient truth has been proven to be a total lie.
[1:54:44.880 --> 1:54:49.200]  But we're far from winning this so we've got to get more aggressive. We tend to think you know oh
[1:54:49.200 --> 1:54:52.480]  we've already proven this. Just because Trump's having some victories doesn't mean we're out of the
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:59.040]  woods and you look at how they're announcing we want to arrest people. 15 attorney generals being
[1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:03.760]  run by Cuomo out of New York and you've got them. Yeah saying I saw this in the news we're going to
[1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:08.320]  start lawsuits. Kids are suing Trump. They're suing energy companies saying you're hurting my
[1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:13.520]  future. I guess they think they can get idiot juries with kids going the carbon dioxide caused
[1:55:13.520 --> 1:55:18.240]  a tornado. I'm scared. Oh let me give you a 50 billion baby. Meanwhile General Electric's you
[1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:23.360]  know given some waiver by Obama. So this is racketeering and they know what they're doing.
[1:55:23.920 --> 1:55:28.080]  So I want to ask Mark how we defeat this briefly and then the whole Comey thing. What do you think
[1:55:28.080 --> 1:55:36.800]  of that? Sorry Mark your audio isn't turned up yet. Let's start over. Go ahead. I interviewed.
[1:55:36.800 --> 1:55:40.560]  Thank you. I'll talk first about the climate and briefly on Comey but I interviewed Senator White
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:45.840]  House of Rhode Island the man who wants to use racketeering RICO statuettes against climate
[1:55:45.840 --> 1:55:51.520]  skeptics in the US. He absolutely defended his position. He said that he views climate skeptics
[1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:58.080]  as fraud. Climate skeptics like myself and others are engaging in Lord Moncton and because he
[1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:03.040]  believes that the science is so settled in his favor that any dissent is essentially equivalent
[1:56:03.040 --> 1:56:07.680]  to fraud and therefore prosecution. And that's the same old brainwashing line they've had for
[1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:14.000]  20 years just like chromosomes don't pick sex the science is settled. Exactly and they also
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:16.960]  we had a touch on it when we went to the break. I may have had trouble hearing you and I was
[1:56:16.960 --> 1:56:21.360]  still talking but they're calling it poison weather. That's why the science is so important.
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:24.960]  I went through every bit of extreme weather not only is extreme weather not getting worse. It's
[1:56:24.960 --> 1:56:29.600]  either at record low or declining trend or the best no trend. But she turns the news on they say
[1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:34.800]  hurricanes are worse than ever even though they admit it's in a 30 year low. I know and what
[1:56:34.800 --> 1:56:38.640]  they'll do a lot of times what they'll say is that they'll mention an economic damage figure.
[1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:42.960]  Well any number because of inflation is bigger than the cost of things is going to be a lot worse
[1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:47.440]  than it was 10 20 30 40 years ago. So you can always say all the financial damages are at a
[1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:53.200]  record and that's true because of inflation but it's not true science wise because of actual
[1:56:53.200 --> 1:56:58.640]  extreme sure not in the aggregate. They're calling it poison weather and that's what I find fascinating
[1:56:58.640 --> 1:57:03.520]  and they're saying that fossil fuel poison weather thing again no basis in science and you're
[1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:07.760]  absolutely right it's a shakedown. This is what Jesse Jackson used to do on Wall Street
[1:57:08.400 --> 1:57:11.920]  and Al Sharpton they would go to the Wall Street companies and say hey you know you have
[1:57:11.920 --> 1:57:18.560]  the black population has 11% and your company's only at 9% you know you got to pay us money or
[1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:22.080]  we're going to start filing suit you're going to be paying millions you're going to have bad PR
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:25.840]  and the companies would pay up and that's how they do it. They're going to start going after
[1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:31.440]  energy CEOs. I don't know how strong energy CEOs are going to be Alex that many even coal
[1:57:31.440 --> 1:57:38.000]  companies oil companies Rex Tillerson president of Trump's own secretary of state all support a
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:43.920]  quote seat at the table at the United Nations. I think the table should be upended not a seat at
[1:57:43.920 --> 1:57:47.840]  the table but that's that's sure in closing in closing comey what do you think of the firing?
[1:57:48.480 --> 1:57:51.840]  Comey I think it's a brilliant move and here's one of the things that Donald Trump has done
[1:57:51.840 --> 1:57:57.680]  I don't think the media understands this he has a way of deflecting attention he'll do something
[1:57:57.680 --> 1:58:04.320]  it gets the chattering media including Fox News including MSNBC CNN all of them talking non-stop
[1:58:04.320 --> 1:58:09.280]  about the latest Trump whether it's a Trump tweet a Trump action and meanwhile he's then
[1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:14.800]  free to do without any media scrutiny the things that he's there to do and what he's done is probably
[1:58:14.800 --> 1:58:20.960]  the greatest deregulatory stunt in the first hundred days of any president including Ronald
[1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:26.160]  Reagan he's getting stuff done that he can get done immediately and it's an amazing thing to watch
[1:58:26.160 --> 1:58:31.040]  he does he's deflecting his attention with this kind of stuff with the media I have no problem
[1:58:31.040 --> 1:58:35.520]  what he did with Comey this is exactly what the media and the democrats called for for months
[1:58:35.520 --> 1:58:41.120]  that's right all right mark climate depot.com a great job thank you so much all right your calls
[1:58:41.120 --> 1:58:44.080]  are straight ahead and Mike Cernovich stay with us I'm Alex Jones spread the word they're trying to

[2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:56.160]  something and it's the same thing there's nothing there they've admitted there's nothing there
[2:01:58.160 --> 2:02:03.920]  you were describing what i refer to as a nail and the definition of that nail is it's a plant
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:10.400]  growth enhancer manufactured by male bovine uh everybody in the united states all the people
[2:02:10.400 --> 2:02:16.000]  here are starting to realize what these boys are up to okay and this is the opportunity if schumer
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:23.040]  believes that trump has done something that requires this do it out in the open marshal dylan it don't

[2:02:43.520 --> 2:02:51.840]  economically that turning our power supply back on securing our borders illegals down 43 percent
[2:02:51.840 --> 2:02:57.200]  taking ISIS out trump is delivering on so many fronts i can't believe he's gotten this much done
[2:02:57.200 --> 2:03:06.560]  alex uh but uh let me say this president trump has done a good job so far now i'm one of these
[2:03:06.560 --> 2:03:11.440]  old boys i disagree with myself sometimes just have somebody to argue with sure i agree but
[2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:18.480]  uh let me say this what he's done so far pretty much most of it i'm gonna agree with and go along
[2:03:18.480 --> 2:03:24.080]  with i'm not i'm tired of carving the names of young americans in the granite and marvel
[2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:29.760]  because those idiots in washington can't tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys
[2:03:29.760 --> 2:03:34.560]  now my children tell me all the time that i grew up watching too many john wane movies
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:39.840]  where the good but guys and the bad guys were clearly defined you understand but i still have
[2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:44.880]  this thing that i'm tired of being lied to i'm tired of carving the names young americans in
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:49.360]  the granite and marvel based upon stuff that requires me to wear boots around the house when
[2:03:49.360 --> 2:03:57.040]  i'm listening to it no that's right i appreciate your call trump is taking out the creation of obama
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:03.200]  isaac i mean he really is destroying him and that's why they're so pissed off right now i mean he's
[2:04:03.200 --> 2:04:10.000]  really going in and taking him out and in the police actions of vietnam and korea we were not
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:17.200]  allowed to win because the globals had a larger grand strategy and vietnam was actually covertly
[2:04:17.200 --> 2:04:26.160]  classified called a war game in fact my dad my family but one of my dad's uh family members
[2:04:26.160 --> 2:04:32.160]  he used to he's still alive he's down in the billy down in the centennial real old now but he was in
[2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:37.120]  the cia and a bunch of other stuff and they would always wear this leather jacket that said uh southeast
[2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:46.480]  asia war games 1960 to 1975 it really started 1960 on 64 second place and that's all vietnam was
[2:04:46.480 --> 2:04:52.800]  was a war game and it's all just it was a great all liberal thing the whole counterculture it was
[2:04:52.800 --> 2:04:58.080]  a war against america ladies and gentlemen we'll be back with beth and others and mike sernovich stay
[2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:06.560]  with us december 23rd 1776 these are the times that try men's souls the summer soldier and the
[2:05:06.560 --> 2:05:11.520]  sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands by
[2:05:11.520 --> 2:05:17.760]  it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not easily conquered
[2:05:17.760 --> 2:05:22.720]  yet we have this consolation with us that the heart of the conflict the more glorious the triumph
[2:05:22.720 --> 2:05:28.800]  what we obtained too cheap we esteem too lightly it is dearness only that gives everything its value
[2:05:28.800 --> 2:05:34.560]  heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods and it would be strange indeed if so celestial
[2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:40.240]  an article as freedom should not be highly rated britain with an army to enforce her tyranny has

[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:13.120]  sarnovich weeks ago say that there's going to be leaks and that mcmaster is going to be on the way
[2:09:13.120 --> 2:09:19.280]  out that's now mainstream news today uh so we've all got interesting informative sources but my intel
[2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:25.520]  is comey was so erratic so weird wouldn't go out to clinton's for all their corruption kept saying
[2:09:25.520 --> 2:09:31.440]  one thing doing another and was basically working for deep state blocking all the pedophile gate
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:35.520]  investigations that trump's expanded blocking what the attorney general wanted to do that was
[2:09:35.520 --> 2:09:40.800]  constitutional and basically they're wanting to expand the fake russian investigation while doing
[2:09:40.800 --> 2:09:46.240]  nothing about hillary and obama to a type of false blackmail just to keep things going in
[2:09:46.240 --> 2:09:50.880]  uendo even though they can produce nothing in these congressional hearings when they themselves
[2:09:50.880 --> 2:09:53.760]  have all the russia connections now i haven't talked to mike sarnovich i don't know what his
[2:09:53.760 --> 2:09:58.000]  sources are but he's always got big breaking news it's always turned out to be so accurate which
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:02.080]  even cnn has to admit okay sarnovich has got these amazing white house sources you have to see an
[2:10:02.080 --> 2:10:08.240]  ins not trusted mike sarnovich his info wars is so mike tell us what's coming up uh here and more
[2:10:08.240 --> 2:10:14.240]  detail in the fourth hour today that you'll be hosting we'll do well but before i go i just
[2:10:14.240 --> 2:10:19.440]  really want to give a shout out to your production people i send them stuff and they have it all
[2:10:19.440 --> 2:10:24.800]  preloaded and that's only possible because of the support from the readers and listeners i think a
[2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:30.560]  lot of people maybe don't realize how spectacular the operations are and how great your people are
[2:10:30.560 --> 2:10:34.880]  so i just wanted to give them a shout out and a shout out of course to everybody who's listening
[2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:38.720]  who supports your operation i'll say this nico lacosta is the best producer i've ever had
[2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:44.320]  and he's organizing so well he's an absolute god send and and i'm looking to him to hire
[2:10:44.320 --> 2:10:48.160]  the whole next team to launch this whole expansion it's going to be amazing my friend
[2:10:48.960 --> 2:10:54.480]  yeah so i'm just blown away and of course that is only possible because people buy the products
[2:10:54.480 --> 2:10:58.720]  and which are good for their health anyway so it's always important because a lot of people
[2:10:58.720 --> 2:11:05.040]  they don't realize the behind the scenes operation and i'm blown up nico like he blows me away i'll
[2:11:05.040 --> 2:11:09.200]  send him stuff and he's like all right we got it five seconds later it's on the screen idiot
[2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:15.760]  for example um ricky white del political has now confirmed a story that i broke on info wars
[2:11:15.760 --> 2:11:21.600]  which was that mcmaster was going to bring in ricky white del as his you said that two weeks ago
[2:11:22.240 --> 2:11:28.080]  yeah and they're calling it exclusive scoop big scoop no credit to you in fact can we pull up
[2:11:28.080 --> 2:11:34.240]  the article from two weeks ago to type in a sernovich uh white del brought in without asking
[2:11:34.240 --> 2:11:38.000]  trump what was the exact headline of something like that something like that yeah and i texted it
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:42.640]  to nico so i think they haven't preloaded already ready to go they just brought him in portrays
[2:11:42.640 --> 2:11:49.280]  mcmaster have taken over the national security council on massive ground war in syria now that
[2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:55.760]  was back in april mcmaster's meltdown tell staff he will not deal with that high schuler there's
[2:11:55.760 --> 2:12:01.440]  another one uh elie lake is doing great work from mcmaster original reporting again president mcmaster
[2:12:01.440 --> 2:12:05.840]  master to meet with trump discuss who is running the white house and then here it is but i want to
[2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:09.760]  find the one we had one on info wars we had a video now i just want to show people because
[2:12:09.760 --> 2:12:16.000]  political never gives you credit go ahead right so this is all information we had been developing
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:22.240]  on info wars with you and paul joseph watts and paul great how the big picture now personnel is
[2:12:22.240 --> 2:12:28.960]  policy and portray us now is totally in control of the nsc he has brought in yeah there you go
[2:12:28.960 --> 2:12:34.400]  there's the story may third of course it's exclusive now politico scoop right even though
[2:12:35.040 --> 2:12:40.800]  this real news was brought in here at info wars we're breaking news here so fast we can't keep
[2:12:40.800 --> 2:12:46.880]  track we're now breaking so many stories between all of us that sometimes we forget to write about
[2:12:46.880 --> 2:12:51.360]  them and then i'm like oh yeah alex and i we talked about that one exactly i mean i have it from
[2:12:51.360 --> 2:12:55.600]  multiple sources i want to ask you next but i'm glad you went back to just prove again how accurate
[2:12:55.600 --> 2:13:01.360]  you are the more sources than i even have i've been told no they're trying to blackmail the president
[2:13:01.360 --> 2:13:06.160]  with fake russia stuff he's done he said listen you can investigate me all day but go after hillary
[2:13:06.160 --> 2:13:10.400]  go after obama they're the ones in bed with russia they're in bed with the radical muslims trump is
[2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:14.240]  done i love it he needs to go in the office but the point is these are just bombshell
[2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:19.120]  breaking stories here and i love how the whore media never asked to admit that we're correct go
[2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:26.000]  ahead sorry right so the komi thing the reason komi is out they wanted him out in october
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:32.720]  because komi has done nothing but cover up the crimes of the clinton crime family the the it guy
[2:13:32.720 --> 2:13:38.800]  hillary's it guy story that was broken on info wars and other places he went on reddit and asked for
[2:13:38.800 --> 2:13:44.720]  advice on how to delete emails after he had been subpoena that's right right and then komi says
[2:13:44.720 --> 2:13:51.520]  there's no intent oh we couldn't prove criminal he's in public asking how to how to abscond evidence
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:57.840]  yeah and your people can probably find that one if they look up stone tear reddit or stone tear
[2:13:57.840 --> 2:14:04.400]  hybrid was spelled reddit we got him smoking gun hillary clinton's it guy who then pled to fit
[2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:11.040]  before congress was caught admitting to a felony felony obstruction of justice komi said oh but we
[2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:17.440]  can't we can't prove intent but meanwhile some guy on a nuclear sub takes a picture because he wants
[2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:23.680]  to show his grandkids one day what grandpa did that guy is in federal prison dishonorable discharge
[2:14:23.680 --> 2:14:29.040]  many many stories like that but when it comes to the clinton crime family komi says oh we we can't
[2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:36.400]  prove it and of course komi was hated by the fb all of my fbi people told me they go sernovich
[2:14:36.400 --> 2:14:41.200]  we need him out of there because he's such a joke he's not a real law enforcement officer he's a
[2:14:41.200 --> 2:14:48.480]  political hack and let's expand with no sources the media today the liberal media oh the the fbi
[2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:58.960]  cried oh they love komi so where is this going now well there's been a couple big developments
[2:14:58.960 --> 2:15:05.280]  one is that patreus had personally told mcmaster that he's not allowed to leave the nsc and that
[2:15:05.280 --> 2:15:12.720]  was why would del finally got approved so patreus is actually in charge of the nsc not mcmaster and
[2:15:12.720 --> 2:15:17.920]  if you look at some of the ties that patreus has with our good friend george you will see
[2:15:17.920 --> 2:15:23.120]  who is really pulling the strings now of mcmaster and patreus so mcmaster was going to be on his
[2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:28.800]  way out trump was going to give him a sports star pandemis four star and he was making the vice chief
[2:15:28.800 --> 2:15:34.000]  of staff of the army or they were going to have him replace the current commander in afghanistan
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:39.600]  but patreus with that or ego again yeah patreus wants to keep him in there
[2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:46.400]  wow that's just crazy they were asking what i wanted for lunch over you know i'm like i want this
[2:15:46.400 --> 2:15:50.560]  portico place i guess that went out over there kind of multitasking here behind the scene teleprompter
[2:15:50.560 --> 2:15:58.640]  free uh you know my looking at this i'm not somebody that wants a violent revolution the
[2:15:58.640 --> 2:16:04.800]  globalists are calling for it they're pushing it it's out of control trump needs to go out of the
[2:16:04.800 --> 2:16:08.640]  globalist traders they're the people that have hijacked the country for corporations they're
[2:16:08.640 --> 2:16:13.040]  the real threat not the russians the chinese are a major threat i'm not in bed with the russians i
[2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:16.720]  just don't see them involved in our internal politics like the communist chinese they have
[2:16:16.720 --> 2:16:20.800]  been involved with hillary though what do you think trump needs to do and from your sources what is
[2:16:20.800 --> 2:16:24.880]  the word of where trump may be going because i think he needs to go total offense because they're
[2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:28.880]  clearly going to try to overthrow him he doesn't yeah i'm hearing that they're going to reopen the
[2:16:28.880 --> 2:16:34.640]  investigation into hillary clinton and the obstruction of justice of our it guy who never
[2:16:34.640 --> 2:16:39.680]  sure got it passed umma and anthony weiner of course had pedophile connections and weiner
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:44.800]  himself had child pornography on his phone and disseminated child pornography so weiner was
[2:16:44.800 --> 2:16:49.760]  going to get a pass to anthony weiner did umma who of course covered all this up so i'm hearing now
[2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:56.560]  that the the field agents were furious at comey because they weren't able to investigate these
[2:16:56.560 --> 2:17:02.320]  criminals that was why the fbi they're celebrating the the real agents the real law enforcement
[2:17:02.320 --> 2:17:07.840]  people they let you know the fbi people they are they play it so straight that it's hard to even
[2:17:07.840 --> 2:17:13.280]  crack a joke with them like well what do you mean we don't joke around with the fbi and the real top
[2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:20.720]  professional people are as non-partisan as it comes and they hated comey and how he was um playing
[2:17:20.720 --> 2:17:25.680]  favorites so let's thank andrew mccabe who is the acting director right now his wife ran for
[2:17:25.680 --> 2:17:32.560]  democrat senate involved and we need to get rid of him too yeah mccabe is next because mccabe
[2:17:32.560 --> 2:17:38.240]  actually has an inspector general investigation against him for conflicts of interest because
[2:17:38.240 --> 2:17:44.880]  his wife had raised $650,000 this is deep state this is why it's hard not to lose your mind you
[2:17:44.880 --> 2:17:52.080]  just have to laugh a lot mccabe's wife raised i believe $650,000 for hillary clinton and yet
[2:17:52.080 --> 2:17:57.440]  mccabe was the person who was investigating the email and then there's another guy david lofman
[2:17:57.440 --> 2:18:03.600]  this is the story i broke too um i'll get this to nico where they can go to my medium page so david
[2:18:03.600 --> 2:18:10.240]  lofman who is counter espionage a chief of counterintelligence at the fbi he was also a hillary
[2:18:10.240 --> 2:18:15.360]  clinton donor or he was an obama donor rather and he was also supposed to investigate the hillary
[2:18:15.360 --> 2:18:22.320]  clinton email thing that is that is how corrupt yeah how do you have political let me ask you
[2:18:22.320 --> 2:18:28.880]  this how many globalist democrats have infested the fbi i mean how bad is it at the highest level
[2:18:28.880 --> 2:18:33.840]  they're in complete total control the field agents are this field of good guys they're the
[2:18:33.840 --> 2:18:39.440]  people who they really believe in america they're the people who leak us information because the fbi
[2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:44.960]  used to be very tight-lipped but they were tired of watching these deep state globalist agents
[2:18:44.960 --> 2:18:49.920]  destroy the integrity and reputation of the fbi and the prestige as trump noted of the fbi
[2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:54.160]  and they've been of course leaking us a lot of information which they don't do right so
[2:18:54.160 --> 2:19:01.440]  david lofman was an obama donor that is how infested deep state is so the head of counterintelligence
[2:19:01.440 --> 2:19:08.400]  he has all classified information passed by his desk right he is the one who would not allow
[2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:13.760]  an investigation to the fbi leaks that's another story the fake news media isn't reporting comie
[2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:20.720]  and lofman conspired to prevent anybody from investigating who was making these leaks well
[2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:25.200]  that's because it was lost man he was the one that's right so these are the people blocking the
[2:19:25.200 --> 2:19:30.160]  course of justice when it's so obvious and so absolutely blaring that the clintons and obamas
[2:19:30.160 --> 2:19:35.360]  committed all these crimes and so thank god this this i think this signifies skip this break i have
[2:19:35.360 --> 2:19:41.040]  to do it i think this i think this signifies that trump is getting ready to actually serve justice
[2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:47.280]  on them after 111 days of them waging war against him with lies he hasn't wanted to go on the offense
[2:19:47.280 --> 2:19:52.080]  but now to get our agenda through to save the republic i think trump needs to go big guns
[2:19:52.080 --> 2:19:56.000]  on him politically and i think it's time that the american people want heads to roll i think
[2:19:56.000 --> 2:20:02.240]  it's time to lock their asses up well the way i've said it is trump better do it or the people
[2:20:02.240 --> 2:20:08.720]  are going to do it that's where we're at now we're tired we're tired of watching innocent people
[2:20:08.720 --> 2:20:14.800]  nobody some navy some private first class some ensign some low-level person the navy
[2:20:14.800 --> 2:20:20.480]  lose his life because he's 19 years old and takes a picture you think about it some 19-year-old
[2:20:20.480 --> 2:20:24.720]  kid takes a picture because one day he's going to be a grandpa and they're going to say granddad
[2:20:24.720 --> 2:20:28.880]  what you doing the navy he's going to say i was on a nuclear submarine he never even shared that
[2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:35.280]  with anybody that guy rocks in federal prison loses his gi bill loses his ba benefits his whole
[2:20:35.280 --> 2:20:40.720]  life is destroyed convicted felon can't vote and hillary has 30 000 secret emails she's selling
[2:20:40.720 --> 2:20:48.080]  to foreign governments it's okay right taking money from the saudi's the oh shoot shoot a judicial
[2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:53.280]  watch i forgot to tell you this one i don't know if you guys covered already they discovered emails
[2:20:53.280 --> 2:20:58.560]  proving that pedophiles went to haiti to try to adopt children sure so that's another story now
[2:20:58.560 --> 2:21:03.520]  we've got the clinton foundation lady caught chip and kids illegally now she's changed her name
[2:21:03.520 --> 2:21:08.720]  and runs another kid's charity right and that was the story you were all over so judicial watch got
[2:21:08.720 --> 2:21:15.280]  uh official state department emails where they admit now that pedophiles were going to haiti to
[2:21:15.280 --> 2:21:20.560]  adopt children and that was a big story you broke and everybody goes oh this conspiracy theory
[2:21:20.560 --> 2:21:27.280]  that's crazy alice you're just losing your mind well now it's proven emails official emails pedophiles
[2:21:27.280 --> 2:21:33.600]  went to haiti and now we know why the Haitians hate the clinton family with the fire of a thousand
[2:21:33.600 --> 2:21:40.320]  songs wow my son of it you are going to be hosting a full hour and soon multi hour show every day
[2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:44.080]  we're very very excited to talk to you about who you want to kind of host with the show with you
[2:21:44.080 --> 2:21:48.000]  so when you go on vacation around the town people are there think roundtable shows are the answer
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:51.840]  but i want to confer with you and get all that ready because there's just so many great minds
[2:21:51.840 --> 2:21:55.280]  like yourself out there we've got to get on air to commercial radio stations a lot of young people
[2:21:55.280 --> 2:21:59.760]  too like i thought about you know because you and i we talked about we're very excited about this
[2:21:59.760 --> 2:22:05.120]  and this is why reader support is so important i tried the uh that caveman stuff when i was in
[2:22:05.120 --> 2:22:09.200]  austin that stuff is really good it's great for the joints and everything too and that's what a
[2:22:09.200 --> 2:22:14.960]  lot of people realize is if they want more content more shows the globalist killers kind of shows
[2:22:15.680 --> 2:22:21.280]  then that's why you take the supplements it's also good for your health it'll make you feel better
[2:22:21.280 --> 2:22:26.560]  and it supports the operation so alex and i had been talking about like think about like a show
[2:22:26.560 --> 2:22:32.000]  like fox the five but it would be like the five globalist killers right we could have in some
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:37.040]  young people some millennial some real savages that just they don't want to be friends like alex
[2:22:37.040 --> 2:22:41.840]  and i we don't want to be friends with the establishment there's so much talent out there
[2:22:41.840 --> 2:22:45.680]  right now they're the failure they're the joke they're the problem we're not looking to be accepted
[2:22:46.960 --> 2:22:50.560]  again i've turned on fox news shows it's all about we're we don't want to be with it we want
[2:22:50.560 --> 2:22:55.520]  our own thing we want to bring america back 2.0 it's absolutely beautiful all right mike
[2:22:55.520 --> 2:22:59.520]  cernovich you're going to be here in the fourth hour thank you so much and again you've got a
[2:22:59.520 --> 2:23:05.040]  danger in play dot com you've also got a medium at cernovich how to how do people follow you on
[2:23:05.040 --> 2:23:11.040]  twitter tell people about that yeah you can follow me at cernovich c er and ovi ch and whatever i
[2:23:11.040 --> 2:23:15.440]  tweet today you're going to read about the newspaper a couple weeks from now absolutely in
[2:23:15.440 --> 2:23:19.200]  fact that's the slogan out for years we wanted to change from the front lines of true journalism to
[2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:25.200]  info wars or cernwich whatever the truth is here the truth does live here and we're just telling
[2:23:25.200 --> 2:23:31.600]  it like it is we do have the real sources everybody knows that and you'll learn about stuff here a
[2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:36.000]  year before a month before weeks before but more and more see that's the thing if we weren't if
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:41.600]  cernovich and drudge and myself and others weren't always forcing it you wouldn't see in fact that's
[2:23:41.600 --> 2:23:44.800]  one more point turn if i should i'm gonna let you go because i gotta get ready for the next hour
[2:23:44.800 --> 2:23:51.680]  i'm gonna go calls it's not just that we're ahead of them we forced them to finally report it right
[2:23:51.680 --> 2:23:57.840]  we drive the news cycle which is what most people don't understand is we keep pushing and pushing and
[2:23:57.840 --> 2:24:02.720]  then of course the info warriors who are listening in they share the links they get those emergency
[2:24:02.720 --> 2:24:08.000]  broadcasts out it becomes such a big conversation remember that the fake news media would not
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:15.520]  cover wiki leaks until paul joseph watson you me jack wassobit we you know britney petabone who's
[2:24:15.520 --> 2:24:20.560]  great she's been on your show we were out there and we talked about it all weekend and the story
[2:24:20.560 --> 2:24:25.840]  got so big that the fake news media just like hillary's collapse they wouldn't report it for two days
[2:24:25.840 --> 2:24:30.320]  then they then they would not show what she actually fell down they said we were fake news but
[2:24:30.320 --> 2:24:34.640]  everybody 20 million times saw it on youtube so then it blew up with her face again imagine the
[2:24:34.640 --> 2:24:40.640]  arrogance of cnn msmbc when there is video of her falling on her face they go oh alex jones
[2:24:40.640 --> 2:24:45.360]  others were lying and paul watson and cernovich she didn't fall down fake news and then they don't
[2:24:45.360 --> 2:24:50.160]  show her falling down don't they know everyone went and saw the full clip and know what liars they
[2:24:50.160 --> 2:24:57.280]  are they're losing touch with reality but the way i look at it is the mantra is we are now too big
[2:24:57.280 --> 2:25:02.960]  to ignore you can't ignore us you can trash it you can bash us call us conspiracy theories
[2:25:02.960 --> 2:25:07.360]  it doesn't even matter and the reason we're too big to ignore because everybody listening here
[2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:12.080]  is supporting the effort in their own way by the way you mentioned this i don't want to brag
[2:25:12.080 --> 2:25:15.200]  about us but we our listeners need to know that we're having a big effect they're the reason it's
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:19.280]  happening literally they are the power of the oxygen in this whole universe they're the intel
[2:25:19.280 --> 2:25:22.960]  they're the people that resist they're the ones that see through the propaganda they're the strong
[2:25:22.960 --> 2:25:27.840]  that works susceptible i mean they're the heroes here it's not us it's them it's all of us together
[2:25:29.600 --> 2:25:34.240]  they need to understand that you told me this months ago and i already knew this we should
[2:25:34.240 --> 2:25:38.240]  talk about this more when i'm actually around having imposed people all other folks are like
[2:25:38.240 --> 2:25:41.520]  we really love what you're doing actually we appreciate it but they order us to do this
[2:25:41.520 --> 2:25:45.920]  we wish we were free like you think we have a job and so they get all these hacks they
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:52.400]  pay them almost nothing they even their own people are all listening and it's crazy that they're all
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:56.960]  listening they have to pretend like they're not and they even admit to me we kind of write these
[2:25:56.960 --> 2:26:00.480]  half-assed things for our editors but really we're just sending people to you and you can see the
[2:26:00.480 --> 2:26:05.280]  articles where they're actually like they're old twisted globalist editors don't even get that the
[2:26:05.280 --> 2:26:10.160]  fact that it's like fight club they have no idea what they're in the middle of mike yeah and that's
[2:26:10.160 --> 2:26:15.120]  the thing everybody listening they got to understand is if it weren't for people listening you and i
[2:26:15.120 --> 2:26:20.880]  would have a diary that is all we would be we would have a diary a video diary and a little diary
[2:26:20.880 --> 2:26:27.760]  like a little kid but because the people amplify the message and get it out there yeah so much so
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:33.600]  that a lot of these people who write hate articles about us they secretly like us but that's their job
[2:26:33.600 --> 2:26:37.920]  they have to do it and i don't begrudge them that that's the game the game is you know everybody
[2:26:37.920 --> 2:26:43.920]  has to make a living and what are you gonna do but the point is that the people now who are listening
[2:26:43.920 --> 2:26:48.720]  they have to know how much they matter because without them we would have a diary we would be
[2:26:48.720 --> 2:26:53.600]  nobody we would not matter at all so everybody listening in you have to remember don't ever
[2:26:53.600 --> 2:26:58.240]  let anybody tell you that you're nobody that you don't matter that you're just one person
[2:26:58.240 --> 2:27:03.120]  that's nonsense that's meant to make you feel weak it's like drudge always said a blogger is just as
[2:27:03.120 --> 2:27:07.280]  important as the new york times well in fact i'll go further the new york times is so discredited a
[2:27:07.280 --> 2:27:12.560]  blogger is more important a video they shoot an article they write whether it's about coffee or
[2:27:12.560 --> 2:27:17.920]  flowers or their school or art they like or movies they like what what we originally believe
[2:27:18.560 --> 2:27:25.120]  is prima facie it's not corporate tells us this is our vision and we go with that it's about us
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:30.880]  being individuals game over for the collectivist right i want to i tell that to everybody is
[2:27:30.880 --> 2:27:35.360]  people go what can i do i'm i'm just saying and i go well eliminate that from your vocabulary

[2:30:00.080 --> 2:30:05.840]  joe biggs here with info wars.com with some patriotic quotes by ron paul the most basic
[2:30:05.840 --> 2:30:12.000]  principle to being a free american is the notion that we as individuals are responsible for our
[2:30:12.000 --> 2:30:18.080]  own lives and decisions we do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make up for our own mistakes
[2:30:18.080 --> 2:30:23.680]  neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how to live so long as we aren't infringing on
[2:30:23.680 --> 2:30:29.120]  their rights freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones if we
[2:30:29.120 --> 2:30:35.280]  are only free to make good decisions then we are not really free liberty is lost through complacency
[2:30:35.280 --> 2:30:41.360]  and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints random searches
[2:30:41.360 --> 2:30:48.000]  mandatory identification cards and paramilitary police in our streets we have lost a vital part of
[2:30:48.000 --> 2:30:54.800]  our american heritage america was born of protests revolution and mistrust of government subservient

[2:33:46.880 --> 2:33:51.760]  deep state pushes coup against trump over combi firing foreign policy once again
[2:33:51.760 --> 2:33:59.680]  then promotes cog rhetoric and that is the deep state openly trying to remove trump
[2:34:03.280 --> 2:34:10.960]  is america a failing state asks politico foreign policy david roth cop
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:19.440]  roth cop former head of the kissinger group ultimately and the sooner the better will
[2:34:19.440 --> 2:34:24.480]  require a system and its people to reject from those surrounding them who have already done such a
[2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:28.960]  disgrace to the offices they hold to undermine america standing in the world you mean selling
[2:34:28.960 --> 2:34:33.680]  america out for globalism they are openly calling for the overthrow of our president who's clearly
[2:34:34.240 --> 2:34:40.880]  trying to turn our economy back on it standing up for our country it's crazy all right beth you
[2:34:40.880 --> 2:34:49.120]  have been a real trooper holding so long thank you uh go ahead hi alex um you know i called last
[2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:55.040]  week and you sent me a few shirts uh because my sister and i are doing operation trigger and
[2:34:55.600 --> 2:35:00.960]  i just want to say thank you for those shirts they've been amazing i got the hillary joker shirt
[2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:05.760]  i can't tell you even hillary supporters are laughing at the shirt saying yeah that that
[2:35:05.760 --> 2:35:12.400]  really wasn't her best moment so you know i want to i want to thank you for those shirts um thank
[2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:20.880]  you the reason that i called was because you know i've done a little bit of research into
[2:35:21.840 --> 2:35:28.240]  trying to figure out why america has become so crony eyes why our government has become crony
[2:35:28.240 --> 2:35:34.080]  we all know you know marxism tells them you know you have to force into cronyism in order
[2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:42.240]  to collapse the government but i truly believe that the reason we have been crony eyes
[2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:49.680]  is based off the fact that our government owns the majority of the patents that are in the united
[2:35:49.680 --> 2:36:00.000]  states and the fact that people can't come from outside of the united states with with uh processes
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:05.760]  that they're trying to get patent because the government owns something that could be associated
[2:36:05.760 --> 2:36:15.040]  with their idea with their process or with their product and so it's it's going to be
[2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:22.080]  really difficult for trump to get these companies that have not sold out to the cia have not
[2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:29.600]  sold out to numerous agencies within the government because they can't bring those patents that they
[2:36:29.600 --> 2:36:36.080]  need over to america in order to start those plans so i'm with you trump needs to go on the
[2:36:36.080 --> 2:36:43.760]  office that's the most important thing right now and he's already got them you know crippled at
[2:36:43.760 --> 2:36:50.080]  this point and if he went in there and he started looking at the whole patent process and he started
[2:36:50.080 --> 2:36:55.600]  bringing in the small businesses and changing the process changing the cost well he's actually
[2:36:55.600 --> 2:37:01.120]  hinted at that releasing the secret technologies the life extension the secrets of the universe
[2:37:02.400 --> 2:37:07.840]  they talked about in his uh inaugural address that would happen great great points bet thank you so
[2:37:07.840 --> 2:37:13.120]  much let's go ahead and take another call here let's go ahead and talk to carlos in canada you're
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:19.520]  on the air carlos thank you good afternoon alex hey buddy just wanted to mention uh the i did a
[2:37:19.520 --> 2:37:26.880]  little analysis on the replacement of the director of the fbi yesterday in the sense that um i was
[2:37:26.880 --> 2:37:32.240]  more concerned with the procedure that that president trump would not be able to be criticized
[2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:39.920]  as being arbitrary as being dictatorial or irresponsible and um look at the clarity we've
[2:37:39.920 --> 2:37:48.800]  had uh the lectures written by attorney general um about the director with references to consultations
[2:37:48.800 --> 2:37:56.480]  with experts and with people that were in positions before uh rod rosamstein the the deputy attorney
[2:37:56.480 --> 2:38:03.520]  general presented his findings and conclusions of his own and others with evidence um and that
[2:38:03.520 --> 2:38:09.360]  would pass on to the attorney general who in a brief comment made say we must restore the
[2:38:09.360 --> 2:38:16.960]  reputation of the fbi which is in in tatters it may be not redeemable and with that uh he then
[2:38:16.960 --> 2:38:23.760]  instructs the president his opinion that he should have the director fbi director removed
[2:38:23.760 --> 2:38:30.720]  and on the basis of that the president restores confidence to the process so that in future
[2:38:30.720 --> 2:38:39.040]  we may see how individual in in in government are removed this is clarity this is um a level of
[2:38:39.040 --> 2:38:44.480]  disclosure which is solitary and i think that's right normally people get fired they don't do
[2:38:44.480 --> 2:38:49.680]  any of those they just fire them here's trump laying it all out that this guy's absolutely out of
[2:38:49.680 --> 2:38:59.120]  control and that's the end of him that's right but if you compare it to fbi director uh edgar
[2:38:59.120 --> 2:39:06.960]  hoover and president kennedy for instance those were different days i mean today the the information
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:14.240]  gathering uh is in the hands of people like uh you know um other than than the the director of the
[2:39:14.240 --> 2:39:19.040]  fbi so you have brennan making all sorts of threats to the president thinking that because
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:24.560]  they have access to this information they are now the the new edgar hoover's and so it shows you
[2:39:24.560 --> 2:39:31.360]  that president trump is uh is responsible it restores confidence in the in the dismissal process
[2:39:31.360 --> 2:39:35.680]  it's not arbitrary and i don't really think they they will go very far on trying to accuse them
[2:39:35.680 --> 2:39:41.520]  of being arbitrary but i mean the democrats are all saying he should be removed from officer
[2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:46.240]  and peach right now but they were calling for coming to be removed just a week ago so i don't
[2:39:46.240 --> 2:39:49.840]  see how hillary then says oh it's horrible this happened when a week ago she was blaming comie
[2:39:49.840 --> 2:39:57.440]  for her loss it will not go very far may i make another point uh whatever thank you very much
[2:39:57.440 --> 2:40:04.880]  well it concerns you you're a good leader uh obviously you're a noble person and when people
[2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:15.200]  like uh steve uh colbert or or um bill maher um attack you um you have they know very well that
[2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:20.160]  you you know when they skunk you that you're going to defend yourself by saying i'm not this and i'm
[2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:25.600]  not that and whatever but you don't go on the attack you don't double down on them and attack them
[2:40:25.600 --> 2:40:35.040]  and it's really uh a very um uh sad thing because these individuals uh in their own careers they
[2:40:35.040 --> 2:40:42.320]  they need to to understand that they are uh role models for others and they don't understand
[2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:47.520]  and they're irresponsible and stupid because let me tell you um if president trump walked into bill
[2:40:47.520 --> 2:40:54.080]  maher's studio and gave him a john wane a knuckle sandwich for saying things about himself uh and
[2:40:54.080 --> 2:41:00.640]  uh and his daughter um he would be able to pardon himself as president so bill maher's pretty stupid
[2:41:00.640 --> 2:41:08.000]  not only that uh steven colbert when he he says he's a holster colbert speaks for himself more than
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:13.600]  anything else because he would do that for anybody in his profession in hollywood you know we've no
[2:41:13.600 --> 2:41:20.240]  heard stories of people you know addressing their powers above them and and many of these movie stars
[2:41:20.240 --> 2:41:25.680]  and people like that who make these statements to the public they are role models but they are abused
[2:41:25.680 --> 2:41:31.040]  because they are really the the white slaves of the of the hollywood mogul so they are do this
[2:41:31.040 --> 2:41:36.160]  for your number work here again it's it's horrible hollywood is so controlled most people are libertarians
[2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:40.320]  in hollywood only kurt russell would speak out about it they're not liberals they're not conservatives
[2:41:40.320 --> 2:41:44.080]  they just love america they don't want to be told what to do anymore they don't want to play roles
[2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:50.000]  that put the country down and i just wish that the bruce willis's and the kurt russells would say
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:55.760]  more and do more because it's funny like anybody ever liked in hollywood like a
[2:41:58.160 --> 2:42:03.680]  i mean you know the big hollywood producer and director and then the biggest hollywood star of
[2:42:03.680 --> 2:42:09.760]  all uh time it was rowdy yates way back in the time of rawhide and then just right through
[2:42:09.760 --> 2:42:15.840]  all the other films clenny's would he's a patriot he's a good guy he cares he was in the korean war
[2:42:15.840 --> 2:42:19.520]  survived a big plane crash coming back over the pacific ocean i've been been a movie made about
[2:42:19.520 --> 2:42:22.960]  that out there for two days with sharks trying to eat them just a really interesting fellow
[2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:29.360]  he's a good guy so whoever we resonate with we see the reality behind even the act of the real
[2:42:29.360 --> 2:42:33.200]  person and then all the other people are just a bunch of followers it's very very sad i appreciate
[2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:39.680]  your call god bless you carlos since you mentioned and then i'll go to tracy and michael and uh jeff
[2:42:39.680 --> 2:42:45.680]  and dean 800 25 at 99231 is the toll free number to join us let me just cover this not because it's
[2:42:45.680 --> 2:42:51.680]  about me but because it illustrates the deception of the medium medium matters funded by george
[2:42:51.680 --> 2:42:58.640]  soros david brock uh attacked me for something i did i guess on monday alex jones mox jimmy
[2:42:58.640 --> 2:43:08.080]  kimmel over his son's heart defect now i did mocking and even read what i said
[2:43:10.800 --> 2:43:14.480]  and i just went on to say that heart defects are up because of the vaccines the chemicals
[2:43:14.480 --> 2:43:20.240]  uh if you have a cesarean they don't tell you that a lot of times the baby's early that the heart
[2:43:20.240 --> 2:43:24.960]  doesn't start pumping blood until the baby's out of the body out of the mother and that and that
[2:43:24.960 --> 2:43:29.840]  and that and the back that has heart marbles and problems at first that generally children grow
[2:43:29.840 --> 2:43:34.640]  out of it a lot of hospitals will say have heart surgery on your preemie not not not telling you
[2:43:34.640 --> 2:43:40.640]  the heart's going to grow into the blood grow into the flow and i got four children i know about this
[2:43:40.640 --> 2:43:47.040]  and so i said oh he just says you know we need to have socialist health care because you know kids
[2:43:47.040 --> 2:43:51.600]  need to be covered when we got some of the best health care in the world and under obama care it
[2:43:51.600 --> 2:43:57.040]  actually destroys all that and venezuela has horrible health care i was saying look at how jimmy
[2:43:57.040 --> 2:44:02.880]  kimmel uses his child's heart defect to then tell us we should accept obama care that's a giant
[2:44:02.880 --> 2:44:09.520]  screw job it wasn't about his child it wasn't me putting down his child having a heart defect why
[2:44:09.520 --> 2:44:16.560]  in the world would i say something like that but you read what i said or you watch the video i didn't
[2:44:16.560 --> 2:44:24.560]  mock him but they have that headline that i would mock a baby's heart defect
[2:44:30.480 --> 2:44:34.400]  when i personally have dealt with that it makes me want to throw up
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:42.720]  but that's who these sick freaks are oh look at jimmy kimmel he has a child heart
[2:44:42.720 --> 2:44:48.160]  defects it isn't that they had the child earlier had a cesarean they won't even tell them that
[2:44:48.160 --> 2:44:53.200]  tell them that see the medical system that the cause of heart problems obviously and i go on
[2:44:53.200 --> 2:44:58.880]  in the in the in the in the whole analysis wasn't mocking him i was using this case to say let's not
[2:44:58.880 --> 2:45:07.200]  just feel bad for his child we hope it's better let's actually sit there and look at what's really
[2:45:07.200 --> 2:45:14.000]  going on it's like oh give money to breast cancer research find a cure why not find out why depending
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:18.160]  on the type of breast cancer they're up two thousand three thousand four thousand ten thousand
[2:45:18.160 --> 2:45:22.240]  twelve thousand percent there's a bunch of a breast cancer they're all just skyrocketing
[2:45:22.240 --> 2:45:26.640]  brazil didn't have any breast cancer to speak of till 20 years ago go i have a say started getting
[2:45:26.640 --> 2:45:34.880]  used it's as high as the united states i mean round up doesn't just kill weeds folks he grows
[2:45:34.880 --> 2:45:41.200]  breast cancer that's an admitted fact they call it estrogen based cancers
[2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:51.040]  so i don't want people like my grandmother who had one breast removed and then for six years
[2:45:51.040 --> 2:45:55.280]  refused to have surgery on her other breast and she pretty much died of cancer wouldn't see the
[2:45:55.280 --> 2:45:58.560]  doctor anymore that's her business at 92 years old a few months ago
[2:46:01.360 --> 2:46:05.040]  big christian wouldn't commit suicide i i admire for that but i probably would have
[2:46:06.320 --> 2:46:14.400]  sitting there with cancer for six years all over her body just said i'm done because it was so
[2:46:14.400 --> 2:46:24.960]  unfun to have one of her breast removed at 97 or whatever it was 80 86 and then they just turned
[2:46:24.960 --> 2:46:28.880]  it into i don't care about people with cancer i don't care about jimmy kimmel's kid well what the
[2:46:28.880 --> 2:46:32.960]  hell are you talking about i care about kids so i don't want to abort them all while you shoot
[2:46:32.960 --> 2:46:37.760]  your mouths off let's just kill the babies get the highways rolling kill more people kill old people
[2:46:37.760 --> 2:46:47.040]  i'm bill marr i'm a selfish dirtbag i mean i've been told about people that know jimmy kimmel
[2:46:47.040 --> 2:46:51.760]  like i care he talks about me all the time i need to be recognized by some hollywood guy
[2:46:51.760 --> 2:46:55.920]  that kimmel is a listener of the show back to the man show things were funny he likes a lot of it
[2:46:55.920 --> 2:46:58.800]  he does his little jokes but oh alex you had to talk about the pickles and all that
[2:47:02.240 --> 2:47:08.720]  i talked about him using his child's problem to push obama care that cuts the quality of care
[2:47:09.760 --> 2:47:14.000]  and then i said why don't you actually find out why the kids are having record heart defects
[2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:21.680]  because the heart's an amazing engine you can have a little bit of brain deforming maybe
[2:47:21.680 --> 2:47:26.080]  it's a little bit weird maybe you're wacky maybe you're even smarter because of that's a that's a
[2:47:26.080 --> 2:47:30.160]  computer that heart is an incredible engine that works for like a hundred years and if there's
[2:47:30.160 --> 2:47:41.760]  any problems in it you got big problems and so they transmute the truth into a lie and you
[2:47:41.760 --> 2:47:48.000]  read what i said oh look at jimmy kimmel his child has heart defects it isn't that they had the child
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:53.440]  earlier had a cesarean they won't even tell them that i'm at the hospital that that causes heart
[2:47:53.440 --> 2:47:58.560]  problems obviously no no no we're not going to tell you it's all the vaccines you took or the
[2:47:58.560 --> 2:48:04.960]  chemicals you ingested we're not going to discuss the vaccines they just gave your child yeah that's
[2:48:04.960 --> 2:48:08.800]  what's really killing the kids and making them have brain disorders and heart attacks let's just
[2:48:08.800 --> 2:48:15.600]  say give us free health care or our babies will die don't our babies deserve it when you have
[2:48:15.600 --> 2:48:20.960]  state-run health care you have medical tyranny when you have everyone bound under one system
[2:48:20.960 --> 2:48:27.200]  they can tax you and control you and do whatever they want once there's no competition in choice
[2:48:27.200 --> 2:48:33.440]  but it doesn't matter for the pseudo-intellectuals of jimmy kimmel that's the ones that write the
[2:48:33.440 --> 2:48:39.360]  stuff for him see that the pseudo-intellectuals of jimmy kimmel he's just a breeder he can
[2:48:39.360 --> 2:48:44.800]  just get up there and say we need national health care for my baby it's for the children
[2:48:44.800 --> 2:48:52.880]  it sounds so much easier where'd i mock jimmy kimmel you think i'm gonna mock a baby with a heart
[2:48:52.880 --> 2:49:06.000]  effect see they're the ones that mock all this most of the writers for jimmy kimmel don't have
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:12.880]  kids most of them are drug addicts they're hired because they're mentally ill and they're hired
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:16.640]  because they'll do whatever they're told they have nothing they have no soul
[2:49:16.640 --> 2:49:22.240]  and then they need to tell the world i have no soul
[2:49:24.160 --> 2:49:27.920]  because they fear people that do have a soul and a connection to god
[2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:32.960]  that's just an example of their deception we're gonna go to break come back
[2:49:33.600 --> 2:49:42.560]  and go to uh jeff and oh michael's first is that michelle i can't read it so far away uh but hopefully
[2:49:42.560 --> 2:49:49.040]  this attack on the corrupt government the removal of comey the arrogant deep state the
[2:49:49.040 --> 2:49:53.680]  arrogant bureaucracy is a very very positive move i hope to see more of this from front
[2:49:54.400 --> 2:49:58.160]  because we're already in a war like patrick henry said
[2:50:01.440 --> 2:50:05.680]  i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death
[2:50:05.680 --> 2:50:12.640]  the war has already begun why we sit here idle we didn't ask for this fight but
[2:50:16.160 --> 2:50:20.320]  you know you might be a little scared before a fight starts
[2:50:24.320 --> 2:50:29.760]  but once the fist starts swinging and once somebody connects with your head that you know
[2:50:29.760 --> 2:50:35.840]  that that feeling that's fun isn't it and we're dealing with a bunch of cowards that play in
[2:50:35.840 --> 2:50:42.480]  a man's world and pretend like they've got the power but as long as we realize that this world's
[2:50:42.480 --> 2:50:48.480]  only a test and what we do measures ourselves in god's eyes and nothing else matters who cares
[2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:52.960]  about being ridiculed by the globalist who cares about their system attacking us that's the badge

[2:53:57.760 --> 2:54:11.920]  the battle on system is the vampire sucking the children's blood
[2:54:11.920 --> 2:54:15.200]  yeah
[2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:31.040]  and anybody that sells you day by day we should organize ourselves by race
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:39.200]  is a liar because we are the human race and it was the christians that began to end slavery
[2:54:39.200 --> 2:54:45.600]  and empower women and they know we have the guilt on our conscience that we wanted to stop it
[2:54:46.240 --> 2:54:51.120]  so the people that are still for it tell us look what you've done and they know we'll get in line
[2:54:51.120 --> 2:54:55.280]  because we want to be good that's why they say the devil's the accuser
[2:54:58.080 --> 2:55:04.000]  and we have great sins in the west but our sins are way less than those of many other groups
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:12.800]  and it's time to throw off the guilt though we're forgiven and move forward to empower humanity
[2:55:15.280 --> 2:55:19.200]  because you hear all this garbage by the media it's meant to make us all fight with each other
[2:55:19.200 --> 2:55:23.040]  i don't care if you're white hispanic black most people are mixed doesn't even matter
[2:55:23.040 --> 2:55:29.120]  i'm a little bit native american what does it even matter the point is we want a future for ourselves
[2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:38.400]  and our children not a future based on screwing each other over the the resources are unlimited
[2:55:39.440 --> 2:55:44.640]  the globalists are seeking to shut down resources because they want a consolidated control arm
[2:55:46.560 --> 2:55:51.600]  they're selfish a sociopath thinks you're a wimp if you care about people
[2:55:51.600 --> 2:55:58.400]  they're cripples psychopaths and sociopaths are cripples
[2:56:04.320 --> 2:56:06.880]  having feelings caring
[2:56:13.520 --> 2:56:18.560]  opens you up the whole universe these stupid devil worshipers think they are the only ones that have
[2:56:18.560 --> 2:56:27.680]  a corner on evil as if good people don't have the whole history of that and don't have access to all
[2:56:27.680 --> 2:56:33.920]  of it you fools you people that seek after evil have no idea that if you were a good person you'd
[2:56:33.920 --> 2:56:40.720]  have all that knowledge and more but would have the transcendence above it and i think about the
[2:56:40.720 --> 2:56:46.400]  horrible things being done to the innocence of all over this planet and the selfish people that
[2:56:46.400 --> 2:56:53.760]  believe they're going to transcend if they greedily steal the human destiny for themselves it's ridiculous
[2:56:55.360 --> 2:57:02.080]  as if you would ever transcend this world when you get on the backs of other people it will never
[2:57:02.080 --> 2:57:09.840]  happen but they distort that and say that good people should then roll over to evil because
[2:57:09.840 --> 2:57:12.960]  we're not going to be dominant we're not going to be aggressive that's all a lie
[2:57:12.960 --> 2:57:19.600]  vengeance is mine says the lord but god acts through us for vengeance
[2:57:23.360 --> 2:57:26.880]  make no mistake we are the instruments of evil destruction
[2:57:30.480 --> 2:57:35.680]  but it's not in some arrogant spirit that were the instruments to be thrown against the enemy
[2:57:35.680 --> 2:57:44.160]  we understand that we are defiled and fallen and only in the great animating contest of liberty
[2:57:44.160 --> 2:57:52.800]  are we then purified to the fire and those that seek to hide from the fire those that seek to
[2:57:52.800 --> 2:57:58.960]  not have the challenge those that seek seek not to enter that are the true cowards of the world
[2:57:58.960 --> 2:58:08.080]  and they seek temporal power temporal power in this body on this planet and it's all a fool's errand
[2:58:12.160 --> 2:58:15.440]  i'm going to go to break take a few calls and i promise i'm going to your phone calls
[2:58:16.160 --> 2:58:21.040]  and then we've got to mike started what's coming up in eight after straight ahead info wars dot com
[2:58:21.040 --> 2:58:27.600]  hordes want to show the enemy has its full pathetic weight leaning up against us trying to destroy
[2:58:27.600 --> 2:58:34.800]  the idea of human empowerment but that's only the gravity that builds our muscles if we take victory

[3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:48.800]  in regards to your conversations yesterday with mark nice and and where you guys were going with
[3:03:48.800 --> 3:03:58.160]  things and and trying to get a mind wrap around how people are becoming so deceit right and um you
[3:03:58.160 --> 3:04:04.080]  know just what glares out at me is um roman's chapter one and it says that they will worship the
[3:04:04.080 --> 3:04:11.280]  creation the earth planet animals ourselves instead of the creator so in the last day she
[3:04:11.280 --> 3:04:17.120]  will give them up to minds of depravity and what we're witnessing right now is the fulfillment
[3:04:17.120 --> 3:04:23.120]  of roman chapter one as god removes his restraining restraining hand of common grace upon humanity
[3:04:23.120 --> 3:04:28.960]  and he's giving them what they're asking for that's right god always gives you your free will doesn't he
[3:04:30.560 --> 3:04:36.000]  yeah and roman chapter one says that they will do what is unnatural right man well i would man woman
[3:04:36.000 --> 3:04:42.720]  with woman right and what we're seeing here in the aggregate in the whole is we're witnessing
[3:04:42.720 --> 3:04:49.440]  since satan got kicked out of heaven for wanting to assume ya always thrown we're seeing this world
[3:04:49.440 --> 3:04:57.120]  and satan's um is magnus magnus opus he is recreating the world in his image that's right
[3:04:57.120 --> 3:05:04.240]  great points my turn was right ahead all the perplexities the confusion and distress in america
[3:05:04.240 --> 3:05:09.600]  arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation not from want of honor or
[3:05:09.600 --> 3:05:14.960]  virtue so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin credit and circulation
[3:05:14.960 --> 3:05:20.000]  those are the words of john adams the second president of the united states are you ignorant
[3:05:20.000 --> 3:05:25.280]  of the private federal reserve do you understand the nature of our fiat currency do you understand
[3:05:25.280 --> 3:05:31.120]  how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it
[3:05:31.120 --> 3:05:35.760]  what kind of leverage do these people in the federal reserve have over the american people
[3:05:35.760 --> 3:05:41.360]  or for that matter what kind of leverage do the saudis have over our money will you be a slave
[3:05:41.360 --> 3:05:46.480]  or will you be free adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge

[3:08:29.200 --> 3:08:34.560]  and we're back mike cermich guest hosting on the real alex jones show was going to do it friday
[3:08:35.280 --> 3:08:41.120]  but i believe roger stone is going to be going on on friday we have a lot of stories to talk about
[3:08:41.120 --> 3:08:46.880]  the great production team has them all queued up one thing that i think was really interesting
[3:08:46.880 --> 3:08:55.120]  which happened yesterday is what did we not know when the combi firing happened nobody knew nobody
[3:08:55.120 --> 3:09:00.880]  had that leak actually i didn't even have that leak and chuck johnson who has done some great
[3:09:00.880 --> 3:09:06.880]  journalism over the years had a story up a got news dot com about that so there was a deliberate
[3:09:06.880 --> 3:09:14.400]  strategy with the combi leak trump wanted to find out who is doing this leaking who's leaking all
[3:09:14.400 --> 3:09:20.880]  this information to the media who are leaking these stories to the media and it turns out it was
[3:09:20.880 --> 3:09:30.000]  rince previs sean spices team david loftman a doj has been leaking so now we know now we know
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:33.520]  who's leaking so that was a very very good development but i thought it was interesting
[3:09:34.560 --> 3:09:40.320]  that nobody had the combi leak came from out of nowhere what's also interesting is my sources
[3:09:40.320 --> 3:09:45.760]  are telling me the white house they're freaking out today they're freaking out last night so if
[3:09:45.760 --> 3:09:51.840]  you want to tweet it at real donald trump let him know he made the right decision so people within
[3:09:51.840 --> 3:09:56.400]  the white house are freaking out who can say oh my god trump never told us he was gonna fire combi
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:10:01.520]  can't believe it oh my god we don't know we don't responsible that's because people are leaking
[3:10:01.520 --> 3:10:08.160]  quit leaking information so trump made the right decision definitely show him your support on twitter
[3:10:08.160 --> 3:10:13.920]  let him know that the way that that was handled was brilliant the leak never got out in fact
[3:10:13.920 --> 3:10:21.600]  this was funny this was funny combi was at giving a talk in los angeles and as he was watching
[3:10:22.400 --> 3:10:29.440]  the tv in the background it showed james combi director combi had been fired and he said funny
[3:10:29.440 --> 3:10:36.320]  joke this is hilarious what a great prank the staffers were scrambling around to let him know
[3:10:37.040 --> 3:10:42.640]  they were scrambling around to let him know no no no like it's not a joke it's not a prank
[3:10:42.640 --> 3:10:49.120]  you you actually got fired definitely one of those awkward moments and that's what we need more of
[3:10:50.080 --> 3:10:54.640]  there have been way too many leaks way too many way too many national security leaks so we had a
[3:10:54.640 --> 3:10:59.680]  few few stories others queued up that we definitely wanted to talk about i think we wanted to bring
[3:10:59.680 --> 3:11:05.360]  jack posovic on if the production team was able to Skype him hand or loop again so jack posovic
[3:11:05.360 --> 3:11:10.000]  he's a friend of mine he's done a film with me we did a great film together actually about the
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:17.200]  rape epidemic in sweden called invasion and we sent jack posovic to sweden to these no go zones to
[3:11:17.200 --> 3:11:22.560]  find out what is really going on in sweden what is really going on so i think jack is going to
[3:11:22.560 --> 3:11:28.000]  join us if we can get him patched in and strived in because he went into the white house briefing
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:34.320]  room yesterday the media freaked out this happened to me too when i went into a white house press
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:39.680]  briefing i'm credentialed for the white house and i've watched marine one land you know the white
[3:11:39.680 --> 3:11:45.280]  house lawn and you know i attended a press briefing and everything the fake news media was really
[3:11:45.280 --> 3:11:49.760]  freaking out because i'm credentialed as a white house correspondent jack posovic is now credentialed
[3:11:49.760 --> 3:11:56.480]  as a white house correspondent drone coursey i believe is info wars is they want to keep us out
[3:11:56.480 --> 3:12:02.480]  there because they want to control the news and the reason i want to get jack on is because
[3:12:03.120 --> 3:12:07.520]  i want to take all of you listening and watching behind the scenes of how the fake news gets made
[3:12:07.520 --> 3:12:16.800]  what you're going to notice is that you're going to hear um all the same stories all the same
[3:12:16.800 --> 3:12:23.360]  questions there's no creativity in the world so when jack attended the briefing yesterday
[3:12:23.360 --> 3:12:28.400]  everybody was general flin general flin what about general flin what about general flin
[3:12:28.400 --> 3:12:35.360]  that's all they ever asked about was general flin why flin hasn't been part of the administration
[3:12:35.360 --> 3:12:42.240]  in four six months there's nothing new about general flin general flin is such a tired me
[3:12:43.120 --> 3:12:49.440]  it's a tired story but what happens is all the fake news people they're on an email list together
[3:12:50.480 --> 3:12:55.760]  there was this was exposed a while back called journal list i don't know if those of you listening
[3:12:55.760 --> 3:13:00.080]  and watching can remember but maybe the production team can pull up the article i think the daily
[3:13:00.080 --> 3:13:07.680]  call to reveal this it was called the j u r n o list journal list they had an email list where
[3:13:07.680 --> 3:13:13.280]  they conspired they conspired to shape the narrative beautiful these guys are so great
[3:13:13.280 --> 3:13:18.800]  the production team is if you love this production team you got to buy the two you got to support
[3:13:18.800 --> 3:13:23.760]  these guys you did there and girls too they're so fantastic that you can talk about things they just
[3:13:23.760 --> 3:13:28.880]  pull it right up because they're they live for this this is a passion job that's what most people
[3:13:28.880 --> 3:13:33.200]  don't realize who are listening and watching everybody i met when i took a big tour of the
[3:13:33.200 --> 3:13:39.680]  studios and had unprecedented access as a journalist to the info wars headquarters nobody else in media
[3:13:39.680 --> 3:13:45.360]  was given the full tour like i was these people are passionate you can talk about a story and
[3:13:45.360 --> 3:13:52.240]  they'll pull it up because for them this is not merely their passion this isn't merely their hobby
[3:13:52.240 --> 3:13:57.120]  this is their profession all over the wonder living their passion and that is why you know the
[3:13:57.120 --> 3:14:02.240]  toothpaste is on sale everybody uses toothpaste a lot of people don't like the caveman stuff that i
[3:14:02.240 --> 3:14:06.800]  use and i understand that maybe people don't want to use brain force i'm not here to tell anybody
[3:14:06.800 --> 3:14:10.880]  what to do with your life you gotta live your life on your own terms you gotta live life as you like
[3:14:11.520 --> 3:14:17.360]  but everybody brushes their teeth a simple way to support the operation is if everybody just bought
[3:14:17.360 --> 3:14:21.920]  the toothpaste if everybody just bought the toothpaste they could hire a hundred more people
[3:14:21.920 --> 3:14:27.440]  in info wars if everybody listening all they did was bought the toothpaste which everybody
[3:14:27.440 --> 3:14:34.160]  needs toothpaste anyway they could hire a hundred more people they could create hundreds more shows
[3:14:34.160 --> 3:14:39.360]  bring in more talent give more opportunity everybody uses toothpaste and that's a great way
[3:14:39.360 --> 3:14:46.240]  to support the show as a win-win for everybody so what passovic discovered they all are emailing
[3:14:46.240 --> 3:14:50.480]  and texting he actually revealed this that's why i really hope i can get him on as an eyewitness
[3:14:50.480 --> 3:14:56.960]  account they're emailing each other and the white house correspondence room what to ask
[3:14:57.600 --> 3:15:04.000]  they're shaping the narrative in real time in real time so for those of you who've never been in
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:08.160]  i don't know if the production team if they can pull up the video that i took from inside the
[3:15:08.160 --> 3:15:12.640]  white house press briefing room and you can see everybody sits down it's almost like you're in a
[3:15:12.640 --> 3:15:18.960]  small college lecture room everybody sits there in these very small airplane light seats the
[3:15:18.960 --> 3:15:23.920]  facilities are dilapidated it's actually disgusting these people are animals they're the break room is
[3:15:23.920 --> 3:15:29.760]  right by the bathroom this is filthy the bathroom is nasty the stench the carpeting is worn down
[3:15:29.760 --> 3:15:35.760]  and they know they're not clean people the white house correspondence are just filthy animals people
[3:15:35.760 --> 3:15:40.800]  saw that they go they go wait a minute these people are drinking water and eating food right by the
[3:15:40.800 --> 3:15:46.720]  bathroom they're just disgusting they're filthy it's so gross right so if you look inside you can
[3:15:46.720 --> 3:15:52.400]  kind of see how the seating chart is and the seating thing is arranged and they all text
[3:15:52.400 --> 3:15:58.800]  each other what questions to ask they all collude they collude in real see the seating you know you
[3:15:58.800 --> 3:16:03.280]  can see get a sense of like the seating and that was of course when i triggered that that hack
[3:16:03.840 --> 3:16:09.520]  who will not disavow the violence and the t-flot she got really mad at me but if you look at the
[3:16:09.520 --> 3:16:14.560]  seating arrangement you can see it's like a high school thing and they're like call on me
[3:16:14.560 --> 3:16:20.240]  spicer spicy call on me pick me pick me i don't know if you kids ever watched welcome back codder
[3:16:20.240 --> 3:16:24.880]  uh vini babirino and there was one character in their horschwitz or something i can't remember
[3:16:24.880 --> 3:16:32.720]  but whenever the teacher mr codder had um a question oh oh pick me pick me spicer pick me
[3:16:32.720 --> 3:16:40.960]  pick me it is the most reviling disgusting these people are so cringy oh oh oh oh you should see
[3:16:40.960 --> 3:16:46.720]  it it's like a bunch of baboons if you ever been to the zoo and you watched a bunch of baboons like
[3:16:46.720 --> 3:16:52.960]  throwing poop around that is really what the white house correspondents do the oh oh oh oh
[3:16:52.960 --> 3:16:58.800]  they sound like apes it's unbelievable i hope alex um goes in there to a press conference too because
[3:16:59.520 --> 3:17:06.160]  witnessing it in real time is really thinking maybe i'll go maybe here's a good idea i just came
[3:17:06.160 --> 3:17:15.200]  up with this should alex jones and i attend a white house press briefing together what do you
[3:17:15.200 --> 3:17:19.840]  guys think what do you guys think watching a home if you're on youtube hit the like button if you're
[3:17:19.840 --> 3:17:26.800]  watching on youtube type in your comment should alex jones and i take a trip out to washington dc
[3:17:26.800 --> 3:17:33.120]  together and attend a white house press briefing together the idea just came to me because i don't
[3:17:33.120 --> 3:17:38.960]  know i think that would be great jack the soba maybe could be there kassandra fairbanks lucian
[3:17:38.960 --> 3:17:44.240]  maybe jim hoff gateway pundit and everybody so if you think that is i just came up with this idea
[3:17:45.360 --> 3:17:52.640]  if you think it would be a good idea say tweet out alex jones should attend a white house
[3:17:52.640 --> 3:17:57.280]  press briefing with search if you're on youtube hit the like button if you're on youtube hit the
[3:17:57.280 --> 3:18:02.240]  subscribe button and hit that little notification bell type in the comments i think that it would
[3:18:02.240 --> 3:18:09.120]  be a phenomenal phenomenal day for truth and truth warriors for alex jones to attend a white even
[3:18:09.120 --> 3:18:13.840]  without me with geron coursey i'm not trying to you know invite myself out to anything with alex
[3:18:14.400 --> 3:18:21.040]  so geron coursey doesn't matter to me but i would love to see a truth warrior like alex jones inside
[3:18:21.040 --> 3:18:25.440]  the white house press briefing room attending a press briefing and then you could just see the
[3:18:25.440 --> 3:18:30.480]  filthy disgusting animals the white house correspondence either dilapidated facilities
[3:18:30.480 --> 3:18:36.720]  which so you walk in and there's all these people sitting around like high school and then you walk
[3:18:36.720 --> 3:18:42.880]  back into the break room and the carpet is worn down it's filthy why don't they change the carpet
[3:18:43.440 --> 3:18:48.000]  why doesn't the white house correspondence association put in a proper coffee machine
[3:18:48.000 --> 3:18:52.880]  you went over there and they had like a little espresso machine or some nasty thing it was dirty
[3:18:52.880 --> 3:18:56.400]  i wasn't even going to drink the espresso i was going to go back there i went a little caffeine
[3:18:56.400 --> 3:19:02.240]  and i went back there and i thought what bacteria forget about you know you need a water filter
[3:19:02.240 --> 3:19:08.400]  we know that's not filtered water we definitely know the white house correspondence association
[3:19:08.400 --> 3:19:12.080]  they are not drinking filtered water they're drinking the tap water with the fluoride and
[3:19:12.080 --> 3:19:18.000]  other chemicals in there but just gross the bacteria the germs i wouldn't drink out of
[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:21.920]  that stuff i wasn't going to even touch any of that thankfully i had to bring alcohol
[3:19:21.920 --> 3:19:26.880]  um stuff to clean out my hands afterwards because it was so gross in there and you think
[3:19:26.880 --> 3:19:30.080]  why don't they take better care of themselves why don't they take more pride in themselves
[3:19:30.080 --> 3:19:35.280]  why don't they take more pride in their facilities so you walk past this dirty coffee machine and
[3:19:35.280 --> 3:19:40.560]  unfiltered water into the break room which is by the bathroom it's completely gross so hopefully
[3:19:40.560 --> 3:19:46.160]  we can patch and jack pasoba can talk about it we can talk about why the fake news media gets
[3:19:46.160 --> 3:19:53.600]  triggered when real journalists attend and we can tell you again that is because they are fabricating
[3:19:54.160 --> 3:19:59.760]  the narrative in real time i saw it when i was there jack so much thought when you were

[3:24:46.640 --> 3:24:52.400]  in five other people or four other people and it would be the five-style show but it would be with

[3:25:09.600 --> 3:25:14.880]  earlier about my experience as a white house correspondent so if we can patch jack in I
[3:25:14.880 --> 3:25:18.560]  would love to just hear it from him what was it like being a white house correspondent
[3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:25.520]  how you doing jack hey mike how you doing great to be here man I gotta tell you it was quite an
[3:25:25.520 --> 3:25:29.040]  experience first time in the white house for me was that your first time in the white house as well
[3:25:29.920 --> 3:25:35.520]  I attended yeah yeah exactly that as a white house correspondent I had never visited it before
[3:25:35.520 --> 3:25:41.040]  though as a tourist okay yeah so for me I hadn't even been through before you know going in there
[3:25:41.040 --> 3:25:45.840]  it was amazing to to walk in and you know the majesty and you know we talk politics a lot and
[3:25:45.840 --> 3:25:50.480]  it's like wow this is this is real I mean Lincoln was here Reagan was here everybody Kennedy
[3:25:50.480 --> 3:25:55.280]  you know and then you get through to the press office and suddenly the magic all kind of falls
[3:25:55.280 --> 3:26:01.760]  apart and you see these people you see them in their element you see the the the way they trash
[3:26:01.760 --> 3:26:06.640]  their offices the way they let they have these like the the toilets are it's all dirty and the
[3:26:06.640 --> 3:26:11.280]  kitchen is all dirty and the way they're in there just giving you snide remarks and comments and
[3:26:11.280 --> 3:26:14.960]  you know the they give you looks in person they won't really say anything but then they'll go on
[3:26:14.960 --> 3:26:19.040]  twitter and they're lighting me up oh I can't believe jack pacific is here I can't believe jack
[3:26:19.040 --> 3:26:24.800]  pacific the racist is here attacking me attacking my family attacking my background it's crazy they
[3:26:24.800 --> 3:26:29.040]  didn't want me there they didn't want you there and it's because they don't like that we will speak
[3:26:29.040 --> 3:26:35.520]  truth to them well and would you agree though that they're just filthy animals with bad hygiene and
[3:26:35.520 --> 3:26:39.760]  that everything was dirty they don't even wash the table for the break room they're just nasty
[3:26:39.760 --> 3:26:45.760]  would you agree with that a lot of it was nasty I you know there's actually a sign up even on the
[3:26:46.720 --> 3:26:50.720]  on the like the the coffee dispenser that apparently have been donated by Tom Hanks for
[3:26:50.720 --> 3:26:56.560]  like $2,000 and there was a sign up reminding them hey this is a $2,000 coffee maker could you guys
[3:26:56.560 --> 3:27:03.360]  wash it after you use it I mean just basic stuff I'm not I'm laughing here because that was actually
[3:27:03.360 --> 3:27:09.040]  I was going to go get myself a coffee and it looks so filthy I thought maybe I could get the flu or
[3:27:09.040 --> 3:27:14.080]  bacteria staff infection that they I'm actually coming down with a little bit of something I
[3:27:14.080 --> 3:27:18.240]  think I may have got I've got my got my nasal my spray right here for the my throat spray
[3:27:18.240 --> 3:27:25.600]  right yeah that would be my advice yeah bring bring an alcohol um hand sanitizer if you go
[3:27:25.600 --> 3:27:30.400]  into the White House room because these people are so filthy they're disgusting I don't know if
[3:27:30.400 --> 3:27:34.720]  they shower there was a they don't smell right I don't know why they don't get better take better
[3:27:34.720 --> 3:27:39.600]  care of their facilities so the coffee machine was a perfect example a perfect microcosm where
[3:27:40.160 --> 3:27:46.480]  they had to tell the they have to remind reporters hey why don't you not be a filthy animal why
[3:27:46.480 --> 3:27:51.360]  don't you have some basic hygiene why don't you clean up after yourselves these are the people
[3:27:51.360 --> 3:27:58.480]  we're supposed to trust to cover the minutiae of foreign policy and national security they can't
[3:27:58.480 --> 3:28:04.880]  even cover the minutiae of a coffee machine yeah and you see these guys too is when when they're not
[3:28:04.880 --> 3:28:09.200]  on camera you know Mike I've been with you I've worked on you with you on a lot of stories you
[3:28:09.200 --> 3:28:13.440]  worked for me on a lot of stories when we're when we're not periscoping we're talking to people we're
[3:28:13.440 --> 3:28:17.920]  going uh searching out for stories out there these guys they'd get off camera and they'd go read a
[3:28:17.920 --> 3:28:22.640]  book they'd go sit and like stare off into space it was the weirdest thing I've ever seen or they'd
[3:28:22.640 --> 3:28:27.360]  be kind of like chatting just sort of gossiping with each other and I'm like what's going on here
[3:28:27.360 --> 3:28:31.280]  and then the camera would come on and they'd start reading from the teleprompter and it'd be like oh
[3:28:31.280 --> 3:28:36.240]  okay that's your job but where are you actually going and getting your news from it's like that's
[3:28:36.240 --> 3:28:41.760]  not even part of it well here's what I noticed too is they're all like this texting each other what
[3:28:41.760 --> 3:28:47.520]  to ask they're colluding in real time did you observe that too absolutely observe that they
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:51.600]  had they were texting and I also saw a couple slack channels they had opened up uh slack is it's
[3:28:51.600 --> 3:28:56.160]  sort of like an internet chat room forum kind of thing it's private chat but it's you could see
[3:28:56.160 --> 3:29:01.360]  because one person would ask a question on and all they're trying to do is trip up Spicer right
[3:29:01.360 --> 3:29:05.760]  they're just trying to get Spicer to make a mistake like say four when the last time he said three
[3:29:05.760 --> 3:29:10.800]  you know so some stupid little tiny mistakes so they could say hi he's a lion hi he's crazy
[3:29:10.800 --> 3:29:15.360]  so all they were doing was asking the same question over and over and over 10 11 12 times
[3:29:16.640 --> 3:29:22.000]  yeah exactly I'm glad you mentioned it so I brought up journal lists earlier which the
[3:29:22.000 --> 3:29:28.720]  daily caller exposed in 2008 the new journal list is now a slack channel so we're about to head to
[3:29:28.720 --> 3:29:33.280]  break but I want to keep you back on the next segment so we can talk about how you watch them
[3:29:33.280 --> 3:29:40.160]  colluding in real time on journal lists the new journal list is a slack channel we need to find
[3:29:40.160 --> 3:29:45.200]  out we need to get a leak we need to get a leak from this it's a slack so I'll have you back
[3:29:48.880 --> 3:29:55.600]  we're on the march the empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:29:59.840 --> 3:30:03.840]  staunch anti-federalist Patrick Henry was opposed to the constitution fearing it would
[3:30:03.840 --> 3:30:07.920]  become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it but
[3:30:07.920 --> 3:30:13.200]  that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty his warnings ignored have now come to
[3:30:13.200 --> 3:30:18.480]  pass he said you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased nor how you were to become a
[3:30:18.480 --> 3:30:24.080]  great and powerful people but how your liberties can be secured for liberty ought to be the direct
[3:30:24.080 --> 3:30:28.880]  end of your government Patrick Henry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor ever
[3:30:28.880 --> 3:30:34.320]  will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them today everything
[3:30:34.320 --> 3:30:39.920]  the government does at every level is concealed from us we have trade deals to manage our economy
[3:30:39.920 --> 3:30:44.320]  that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see later in life Patrick Henry looked
[3:30:44.320 --> 3:30:48.960]  back and said when the american spirit was in its youth the language of america was different
[3:30:48.960 --> 3:30:55.120]  liberty sir was the primary object today our primary concern is safety and comfort when we
[3:30:55.120 --> 3:31:00.960]  should be demanding liberty grandfather wars dot com i'm david night it's not just our water we need
[3:31:00.960 --> 3:31:05.520]  to filter it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's the air we're breathing especially
[3:31:05.520 --> 3:31:11.920]  for our children the artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune
[3:31:11.920 --> 3:31:17.520]  systems the same team based right here in america that brought you the elective pure groundbreaking

[3:31:45.920 --> 3:31:50.480]  incredibly clean this is a system i'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older
[3:31:50.480 --> 3:31:56.000]  more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so revolutionary
[3:31:56.000 --> 3:32:04.080]  today at info wars store dot com today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors
[3:32:04.080 --> 3:32:09.040]  enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets a processed junk we are now

[3:32:30.640 --> 3:32:35.200]  knew that you used all the parts of the animal you use the meat for sustenance the fat for cooking
[3:32:35.200 --> 3:32:41.440]  but you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and kiko factors to
[3:32:41.440 --> 3:32:46.800]  the marrow that produces the blood for the body this is the engine of the life essence i'm a long
[3:32:46.800 --> 3:32:51.600]  way from the caveman my ancestors were but i'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence
[3:32:51.600 --> 3:32:55.280]  that made us what we were and this is a big part of it i know you're going to want to check out
[3:32:55.280 --> 3:32:58.880]  caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself and force live to accommodate
[3:33:09.760 --> 3:33:14.880]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[3:33:14.880 --> 3:33:24.480]  and we're back
[3:33:24.480 --> 3:33:30.240]  fight from guest host for alex jones show today we have a special guest white house
[3:33:30.240 --> 3:33:36.800]  correspondent jack possovic the jack possovic and i have an interesting kind of fun friendship
[3:33:36.800 --> 3:33:43.440]  for a lot of reasons one is that he went into the no-go zones into sweden to do a special
[3:33:43.440 --> 3:33:49.280]  journalism project about an invasion and how sweden become the rape capital of the west
[3:33:49.280 --> 3:33:54.320]  and then the rebel media which is expanding and like out here's what here's what alex jones always
[3:33:54.320 --> 3:34:00.400]  said and i agree with this a hundred percent none of us are competitors we need a hundred alex jones
[3:34:00.400 --> 3:34:05.040]  is a hundred jack possovic's a hundred info wars a hundred rebel medias because people are so
[3:34:05.040 --> 3:34:10.800]  starved for the truth we can't even possibly reach everybody ever there is no competition
[3:34:10.800 --> 3:34:16.080]  that is why i mean think about it most people would say why does alex have so many guests on
[3:34:16.080 --> 3:34:22.160]  why would cernovich be guest hosting and immediately i want to bring other people on most people if
[3:34:22.160 --> 3:34:27.360]  in the fake news media they would say well that's crazy why would you want to promote other people
[3:34:27.360 --> 3:34:31.680]  that is because we're actually committed to the truth and we're committed to the message and we
[3:34:31.680 --> 3:34:37.600]  are just all soldiers and the and the war for truth so it's great to have jack back on how you
[3:34:37.600 --> 3:34:43.120]  doing jack i'm doing great it's great to be here happy so happy to be on rebel media after having
[3:34:43.120 --> 3:34:48.160]  worked with uh with cernovich media and info wars a lot in the past uh doing the invasion project
[3:34:48.160 --> 3:34:52.000]  and definitely agree with your comments there i mean just think about it would you ever see
[3:34:52.000 --> 3:34:58.160]  sean hannity go on cnn would you ever see like joe scarborough or mika brisinski on fox and friends
[3:34:58.160 --> 3:35:02.880]  they're right down the street but they would never ever do that because it breaks sort of those i
[3:35:02.880 --> 3:35:06.880]  don't know unwritten rules of mainstream media that oh we can't talk together because it's it's
[3:35:06.880 --> 3:35:11.520]  this whole false reality they're trying to pitch to people this whole scythe that we're completely
[3:35:11.520 --> 3:35:16.400]  impartial we're not just normal people to live normal lives and are given scripts of of narratives
[3:35:16.400 --> 3:35:23.040]  to run yeah and they also they view each other as competitors they have a scarcity mindset where
[3:35:23.040 --> 3:35:28.400]  they think well hey if i promote somebody else then that'll take the shine away from me but whereas
[3:35:28.400 --> 3:35:35.680]  you and alex and asbra and others the way view it as we we're done all of us will be dead and
[3:35:35.680 --> 3:35:42.720]  imprisoned and thought control camps if we don't fight together and promote each other yeah because
[3:35:42.720 --> 3:35:46.640]  we i mean that's why you know i love the name rebel media because we are the rebels we're the
[3:35:46.640 --> 3:35:51.200]  scrappy rebels in this thing there there are millions of dollars against us billions trillions
[3:35:51.200 --> 3:35:56.560]  of dollars if you want to talk about the people that are behind all this and we we've got what maybe
[3:35:56.560 --> 3:36:01.440]  a couple hundred guys that that do these live streams that break this kind of news and guys
[3:36:01.440 --> 3:36:06.720]  and gals i should say and and get this stuff out to the people no believe me we need all the help
[3:36:06.720 --> 3:36:11.600]  we can get we don't need any infighting and that's why they try that's why they try very hard to launch
[3:36:11.600 --> 3:36:16.800]  these infighting information uh disinformation campaigns against us to try to get us all going
[3:36:16.800 --> 3:36:22.000]  after each other the same way the mainstream media does yeah they actually so when when it leaked
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:27.440]  out that i was going to be working more with alex jones they actually sent in fabricated evidence
[3:36:27.440 --> 3:36:33.520]  false stuff lies all kinds of stuff to alex about me that were completely untrue because they want
[3:36:33.520 --> 3:36:40.640]  to use a divide and conquer strategy they are so afraid now that people like us are united and
[3:36:40.640 --> 3:36:44.400]  we're just saying hey we're not going to believe the fabricated stuff we don't even care we don't
[3:36:44.400 --> 3:36:48.800]  answer to you in the fake news media that everybody's uniting and it's interesting you mentioned
[3:36:49.440 --> 3:36:54.240]  the the rebel media because there was a headline actually in the atlantic which said rebel
[3:36:54.240 --> 3:36:58.640]  in the white house would you like to talk about that a little bit more please i actually love
[3:36:58.640 --> 3:37:02.400]  that headline the rebel in the white house i mean isn't that what what the trump movement is all
[3:37:02.400 --> 3:37:07.200]  about there i am with the beautiful tanyate next to me and and of course you know they throw it in
[3:37:07.200 --> 3:37:13.040]  their far right media i think far right is the new media speak for not uh not marxist at this point
[3:37:13.040 --> 3:37:19.040]  it seems like um and there there was a lot in there but what was interesting to me was you know
[3:37:19.040 --> 3:37:23.840]  there wasn't a statement about like hey here's this guy he works at rebel media rebel started
[3:37:23.840 --> 3:37:29.440]  two years ago out of ezra levant's living room did about six thousand videos and now they're in
[3:37:29.440 --> 3:37:32.880]  the white house and they're credentialed and hey isn't that interesting how media is changing
[3:37:32.880 --> 3:37:37.680]  that wasn't a story about that it was why are you here why do you think you should be allowed to be
[3:37:37.680 --> 3:37:41.760]  in here why should you be in this room and and everybody all the comments i was getting on twitter
[3:37:41.760 --> 3:37:46.240]  all the day all day long keith overman came out and said called me a scumbag and said i'm happy
[3:37:46.240 --> 3:37:52.400]  to see you can tie a tie and it was like they don't want us in that room period the the uh
[3:37:52.400 --> 3:37:56.880]  atlantic article is connecting me there's a lot of fake news in there regarding me uh there's a
[3:37:56.880 --> 3:38:00.960]  lot of stuff that says i'm a conspiracy theorist and this and that well if i'm a conspiracy theorist
[3:38:00.960 --> 3:38:04.880]  why are you guys talking about me if i'm a conspiracy theorist why are these things
[3:38:04.880 --> 3:38:10.000]  that i have reported on been confirmed by the people who have reported it by or by wikileaks
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:13.760]  and other independent organizations if we were making this stuff up why does it all keep coming
[3:38:13.760 --> 3:38:19.040]  true well i love that you brought up this knob appeal because something interesting happened
[3:38:19.040 --> 3:38:24.800]  on twitter so as you know there was a real news dinner in washington dc jim hofft hosted it they
[3:38:24.800 --> 3:38:30.480]  gave me this nice little trophy mike sernovich exceptionalism and new media the 2016 election
[3:38:30.480 --> 3:38:34.960]  it was a nice thing a very nice gesture i wasn't expecting i was very grateful so you know what
[3:38:34.960 --> 3:38:40.880]  they did these um so-called journalists they went on to some trophy shop and they go oh this you
[3:38:40.880 --> 3:38:47.360]  can buy these wholesale for you know 20 bucks or 30 bucks or whatever and i thought a number of
[3:38:47.360 --> 3:38:51.760]  reasons a number of things are wrong with that is what that's what i mean that's how they want to
[3:38:51.760 --> 3:38:58.000]  throw shade is they're not in the right social class like we are there that's how they everybody
[3:38:58.000 --> 3:39:02.640]  listening just so people listening know this is what they think of you they think that you are
[3:39:02.640 --> 3:39:08.320]  garbage whether you're white black christian jewish they think everybody listening and they
[3:39:08.320 --> 3:39:13.760]  think you are trash they would make fun of your trophies you give your children because they're
[3:39:13.760 --> 3:39:19.680]  not the proper crystal this is how these people are they hate you they love you and that is why
[3:39:19.680 --> 3:39:23.440]  they lied to you with the straight face because they don't believe those of you listening in
[3:39:23.440 --> 3:39:28.880]  are actually human and it's really disgusting so talk more about how they look at you and how
[3:39:28.880 --> 3:39:33.120]  they'll take your picture i caught people taking pictures of me everywhere i walked when i did the
[3:39:33.120 --> 3:39:38.560]  press briefing well yeah they're looking at me and i saw this one guy at one point i don't have all
[3:39:38.560 --> 3:39:43.440]  the names of faces yet but uh you know so we got i got up and i went to the podium and i did the
[3:39:43.440 --> 3:39:47.920]  okay sign you know the okay sign that we all do because trump does it and it's this guy it's a
[3:39:47.920 --> 3:39:51.840]  little trolley it's a way to say hey we're part of we're we're behind trump he's support the president
[3:39:51.840 --> 3:39:57.600]  so i do the okay sign right there boom and this guy gets this look just like he like bubbles up in
[3:39:57.600 --> 3:40:02.240]  his face and he sneaks in and he's like like laughing and he jumps on his phone and starts
[3:40:02.240 --> 3:40:07.760]  tweeting like giggling is like his pink he got like pink and his beard was like like all you know
[3:40:07.760 --> 3:40:13.760]  scraggly and and it was like i actually turn to him and i said hey you know this is just the okay
[3:40:13.760 --> 3:40:18.160]  sign we do this because trump does it you know it's not it's not what you guys all say it is
[3:40:18.160 --> 3:40:23.280]  and he just his head just started bob like like back and forth he wanted to burst because he he
[3:40:23.280 --> 3:40:28.000]  thought like oh i got you i got jack presobic doing the okay sign because i got him and now i
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:32.720]  know exactly how to troll him because i can say he's a he's a white supremacist or he's so slovic
[3:40:32.720 --> 3:40:37.520]  this and that the other thing and it's like they don't even live in the same reality as us they
[3:40:37.520 --> 3:40:42.640]  don't even they live in the same reality as regular people all they live for is how to attack us how to
[3:40:42.640 --> 3:40:46.800]  come out us how to come after us they've been digging stuff up on my family they've been getting
[3:40:46.800 --> 3:40:52.560]  stuff up on uh my fiance going through her social media accounts everybody else they're like jack
[3:40:52.560 --> 3:40:57.600]  you've you've got this social media and that social media i'm like yeah i'm friends with her
[3:40:57.600 --> 3:41:02.160]  and her sister and yeah she was born in belarus and she's a us citizen now what what does that have
[3:41:02.160 --> 3:41:07.280]  to do with these emails on france one or uh emmanuel macron being real or not it's all
[3:41:07.280 --> 3:41:12.080]  it is is they want to attack you and they want to find any way to tear you down because that they see
[3:41:12.080 --> 3:41:17.440]  us as members of regular people you know regular people coming out and getting into this journalism
[3:41:17.440 --> 3:41:22.640]  business people that didn't come from born from silver spoons vanderbilts like anderson cooper no
[3:41:22.640 --> 3:41:26.720]  i'm a guy that worked at a pizza shop i'm a guy that shoveled horse manure for a living for a
[3:41:26.720 --> 3:41:31.520]  long time were construction in philadelphia join the military and now i'm here doing this and i'm a
[3:41:31.520 --> 3:41:38.640]  regular person and it drives them absolutely insane that i'm standing in that white house room well
[3:41:38.640 --> 3:41:44.560]  you bring up a number of points one is the xenophobia that they accuse us of the xenophobia
[3:41:44.560 --> 3:41:52.240]  from the press now they are using stereotypes about your beautiful talented intelligent fiance
[3:41:53.040 --> 3:41:58.080]  against her they're calling their russian spy why because she's a foreigner that sounds awfully
[3:41:58.080 --> 3:42:03.280]  xenophobic to me because i have a Croatian last name they try to say that i'm russian and i'm a
[3:42:03.280 --> 3:42:08.960]  russian operative because you have a polish name so put aside how historically ignorant it is to
[3:42:08.960 --> 3:42:14.080]  expect polish people to be pro russia i would i would encourage the fake news people to actually
[3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:19.040]  pick up a book and read about how the soviet suppressed the polish and how polish actually
[3:42:19.040 --> 3:42:23.920]  polish nationalists have their own opinion on the russians which we're not going to go to now
[3:42:23.920 --> 3:42:29.200]  but they're let's talk about the how they're doing more sometimes yeah they're xenophobic and the big
[3:42:29.200 --> 3:42:34.560]  thing though is they believe that anybody who doesn't have a trust fund like dave weigel if your
[3:42:34.560 --> 3:42:40.000]  parents weren't rich enough to send you to a 30 000 dollar a year high school and then give you a
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:44.240]  trust fund to go to college they think that you're trashed and that you don't belong
[3:42:46.480 --> 3:42:50.960]  yeah that simply is you didn't go to the right schools if you didn't come up kissing the ring
[3:42:50.960 --> 3:42:56.320]  if you didn't come up under the right way if you weren't appointed and selected and you know hand
[3:42:56.320 --> 3:43:02.080]  it off from from company to company moved over so this one uh julia i off julia i'm not sure
[3:43:02.080 --> 3:43:06.960]  how to say her last name so she's she's attacking me she's attacking my fiance's being russian trolls
[3:43:06.960 --> 3:43:12.480]  russian spies i look at her and so she was the one if you remember she worked for politico and then
[3:43:12.480 --> 3:43:18.560]  she put out the tweet accusing accusing actually accusing not joking accusing president trump
[3:43:18.560 --> 3:43:23.840]  of having incest with his daughter incest with Ivanka trump this is not me making this up she wrote it
[3:43:23.840 --> 3:43:28.880]  okay and then she politico fired her but she turns around and gets hired by the atlantic
[3:43:28.880 --> 3:43:33.600]  and it's oh well i'm sure she'll she'll uphold our standards and she'll be fine if no problem
[3:43:33.600 --> 3:43:39.440]  was saying something as heinously insane reporting that as fact from the other side but they call
[3:43:39.440 --> 3:43:44.480]  us conspiracy theorists yeah yeah so again that's why the production team they're able to pull this
[3:43:44.480 --> 3:43:51.120]  stuff up so quick yeah she had actually accused trump of incest talk about the definition of
[3:43:51.120 --> 3:43:58.000]  fake news and also this is a thing that we talk about a lot on the show is how they are so debased
[3:43:58.000 --> 3:44:04.400]  that if you show a picture of a daughter and her father admire each other and loving each other
[3:44:04.400 --> 3:44:09.520]  they view that as some kind of sickness because that is how diseased all of these people are
[3:44:09.520 --> 3:44:16.320]  are they view that as somehow wrong because they grew up in these demonic households of abuse and
[3:44:16.320 --> 3:44:21.920]  neglect and not being given any kind of attention so they they can't even comprehend paternal love
[3:44:21.920 --> 3:44:26.320]  is in a way it's sad there aren't victims of the death cult that is modern liberalism
[3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:30.880]  he absolutely right i was just actually listening to a statistic i was on stiff on
[3:44:30.880 --> 3:44:35.360]  malin is one of his older podcast where he's talking about how now 40 percent of american
[3:44:35.360 --> 3:44:40.000]  children are growing up with absentee parents that's that's exactly what this is all about the
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:46.160]  breakdown of regular normal families because then once the children are taken away from the families
[3:44:46.160 --> 3:44:50.240]  who do they get raised by they get raised by mainstream media they get raised by television
[3:44:50.240 --> 3:44:54.000]  now they're getting raised by twitter uh they're getting raised by the and essentially raised by
[3:44:54.000 --> 3:44:58.880]  the government and these elites that are out there pushing narratives to get you them away from
[3:44:58.880 --> 3:45:03.840]  traditional values to get them away from supporting their country supporting patriotism and really just
[3:45:03.840 --> 3:45:07.360]  kind of give them this candy to give them this kind of fluff that they go along with whatever
[3:45:07.360 --> 3:45:12.400]  is going on oh as long as i can get my my uh you know the next snapchat filter then everything's
[3:45:12.400 --> 3:45:18.400]  fine with my life they make you want to want that stuff and not want the real joyfulness and
[3:45:18.400 --> 3:45:23.680]  abundance of life that's out there they make you it's sick the way they twist everything around
[3:45:23.680 --> 3:45:29.520]  and try to set up these false goals these false idols for you to fall victim to yeah that is why
[3:45:29.520 --> 3:45:35.280]  when i tell people i said the power elite want to enslave your children and people go oh that's
[3:45:35.280 --> 3:45:39.920]  crazy and i go well look what happened in Haiti which state departments again i talked to alex
[3:45:39.920 --> 3:45:45.200]  in the last segment now confirmed the reporting from info wars which is that pedophiles were
[3:45:45.200 --> 3:45:51.040]  going to Haiti to adopt people as we know the Saudis they really love black slaves in Saudi Arabia
[3:45:51.040 --> 3:45:55.600]  and in Libya a lot of slaves are ending up over there and of course the clinton foundation was
[3:45:55.600 --> 3:46:00.160]  taking money from the Saudis and the clinton foundation was active in Haiti and of course
[3:46:00.160 --> 3:46:04.960]  the Haitians hate the clinton foundation but that's that that's i guess kind of a side it gets to
[3:46:04.960 --> 3:46:08.480]  talk to you a little bit about sourcing is a couple articles came out today which is about
[3:46:09.360 --> 3:46:15.440]  how apparently leakers are leaking me information like the hill wrote up a big article about how
[3:46:15.440 --> 3:46:20.480]  i'm getting a lot of leaks and exclusives and you are too but here's my question for you is
[3:46:20.480 --> 3:46:26.720]  why is it that when you and i break news they don't talk about the news that we broke they
[3:46:26.720 --> 3:46:31.840]  want to talk about how did we get that story isn't that interesting well it's interesting
[3:46:31.840 --> 3:46:35.840]  because they want us to give up our sources and methods because they want to steal our sources
[3:46:35.840 --> 3:46:40.240]  and methods it's it's pretty simple it's they don't want to talk about the news because they
[3:46:40.240 --> 3:46:44.000]  don't want to give us credit number one because that would legitimize us in the eyes of their
[3:46:44.000 --> 3:46:49.200]  press and make our audiences our platforms bigger and then number two is they want to find out number
[3:46:49.200 --> 3:46:54.480]  one how we got our sources to see if they could steal or co-opt them or in some cases like we saw
[3:46:54.480 --> 3:46:59.520]  with Seth rich they were able to get to Seth rich before he was able to keep himself safe
[3:46:59.520 --> 3:47:04.320]  fortunately he had set up a dead drop on the on the emails which eventually got to wiki leaks but
[3:47:04.320 --> 3:47:08.640]  they got rid of Seth rich before he could leak more before he could corroborate what was in those
[3:47:08.640 --> 3:47:13.120]  leaks and so that's exactly what it is they want to stop the leaks they want to stop this truth
[3:47:13.120 --> 3:47:19.120]  stop this truth from getting out exactly right it's interesting if you you say that because
[3:47:19.760 --> 3:47:24.160]  when i meet with sources in washington dc i don't even bring my main cell phone because they can
[3:47:24.160 --> 3:47:31.040]  geolocate it i bring a special burner cell phone that hasn't been geotargeted to me yet so i leave
[3:47:31.040 --> 3:47:37.200]  actually this in my hotel wherever i'm staying so that i can't be geotargeted burner cell phones
[3:47:37.200 --> 3:47:43.440]  you have to go meet in public places hooded sweatshirts sunglasses because that is how my sources
[3:47:43.440 --> 3:47:47.840]  know they could be murdered at any time and they know that i could be murdered at any time so the
[3:47:47.840 --> 3:47:53.760]  kind of opsec that we do is is really cloak and dagger kind of stuff and i'm sure that your opsec
[3:47:53.760 --> 3:47:58.480]  is similar so maybe for those people listening at home maybe they don't understand how afraid
[3:47:58.480 --> 3:48:03.600]  people are to talk to us because they know they might end up like Seth rich yeah there's people
[3:48:03.600 --> 3:48:07.920]  that have reached out to me that have said you know i almost have at this point a separate app
[3:48:08.640 --> 3:48:14.240]  encrypted app and an encryption for each source that i talk to just because nobody wants to even
[3:48:14.240 --> 3:48:18.800]  be on the same app they want to use these really obscure things that people don't know about people
[3:48:18.800 --> 3:48:24.000]  know about you know what is it a signal they know about wicker those things people are looking for
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:28.480]  that these guys they're always want to stay a step ahead two steps ahead three steps ahead and if
[3:48:28.480 --> 3:48:33.360]  anything's on there they want to delete it before it becomes absolutely possible to be seen because
[3:48:33.360 --> 3:48:39.040]  they know that if your phone right we now learned that iphone from the uh the false seven leaked
[3:48:39.040 --> 3:48:43.360]  that with a zero hour um you know default they can crack your phone so it doesn't matter if it's
[3:48:43.360 --> 3:48:46.880]  encrypted they're reading it right from your operating system that's why you've got to meet
[3:48:46.880 --> 3:48:52.880]  in person that's why you've got to do stuff like you know go to a city rent a car pay cash for stuff
[3:48:52.880 --> 3:48:57.360]  travel around throw on the hoodie whatever you got to do these guys they don't want to meet with us
[3:48:57.360 --> 3:49:01.280]  you know i just had to talk to a guy earlier today that said jack i've got information with for you
[3:49:01.280 --> 3:49:05.680]  but i can't even give it to you over the phone i can't even give it to you in person i don't
[3:49:05.680 --> 3:49:10.480]  need we're talking like manila envelope in the back of the italian restaurant godfather style it
[3:49:10.480 --> 3:49:16.880]  almost seems like because that's what we've got to do 60 stops 50 cell phones i have over 50 cell
[3:49:16.880 --> 3:49:21.600]  phones that i only use one time for a source and then we throw them away and then another thing that
[3:49:21.600 --> 3:49:26.160]  you do is i don't want to reveal too much of my offset for people of course i don't want to give
[3:49:26.160 --> 3:49:30.800]  it to me tradecraft but a lot of times what you do is you post information on a cell phone
[3:49:30.800 --> 3:49:36.000]  you'll walk you'll drop it at a coffee shop and then an hour later the person will walk
[3:49:36.000 --> 3:49:40.320]  by pick up the phone and drop off another phone and that's how you communicate and the reason
[3:49:40.320 --> 3:49:44.800]  i'm bringing that up even though that's a trade secret that's tradecraft i learned remember
[3:49:44.800 --> 3:49:50.720]  when hillary clinton lost an ipad in a very important meeting as a state department person
[3:49:50.720 --> 3:49:56.640]  right that came out in the investigation that she would lose ipads well that was actually
[3:49:56.640 --> 3:50:01.680]  this called a dead drop hillary clinton was doing a dead drop so she would load classified
[3:50:01.680 --> 3:50:07.840]  information on an ipad go into a meeting and then she would forget it and that is how the clinton's
[3:50:07.840 --> 3:50:12.800]  spread top secret information and secrets to all of these hostile here we go we got it on screen
[3:50:12.800 --> 3:50:17.760]  she used ipads clinton she only used one device yeah but she would lose them so remember they
[3:50:17.760 --> 3:50:21.920]  lost a bunch of devices oh we couldn't find seven blackberries because there were some
[3:50:21.920 --> 3:50:28.080]  donors involved with that as well too clinton foundation owners right so what we do is we use
[3:50:28.080 --> 3:50:33.360]  dead drops for operational security she would do it to actually spread information thanks for coming
[3:50:33.360 --> 3:50:39.120]  on jack before we go i want to remind people that survivor shield is about to go on sale

[3:54:23.120 --> 3:54:30.160]  this with some just exciting news about the the komi is gone and what this means okay there's
[3:54:30.160 --> 3:54:35.840]  another story that broke on newsweek which is actually reliable on mckay so komi was of course
[3:54:35.840 --> 3:54:43.440]  an agent of the deep state and he had protected obama umma anthony weiner the clinton's loretta
[3:54:43.440 --> 3:54:50.320]  the whole team susan rice i've gotten information out that susan rice's lawyers have actually reached
[3:54:50.320 --> 3:54:56.720]  out to the fbi and they want to get immunity for susan rice's breaking news actually i just actually
[3:54:56.720 --> 3:55:02.400]  got this information here during the break that susan rice's lawyers are reaching out to the fbi
[3:55:02.400 --> 3:55:09.840]  because she is terrified so a lot of you at home myself included were told by the fake news media
[3:55:09.840 --> 3:55:16.240]  that susan rice did not unmask anyone and then of course it was revealed that she did unmask people
[3:55:16.240 --> 3:55:22.240]  she had actually unmasked me alex jones john hannity any person who they viewed in the media
[3:55:22.240 --> 3:55:28.240]  as having a big impact and who was pro trump they went after us hard and they spied on us illegally
[3:55:28.240 --> 3:55:33.360]  and criminally so susan rice claimed that she would testify before the senate then her lawyer
[3:55:33.360 --> 3:55:40.560]  sent a letter saying she wasn't going to testify she thought she was safe and with komi in at the fbi
[3:55:40.560 --> 3:55:47.200]  and with mikabe in as at the fbi she is safe but now komi's out susan rice is very very nervous
[3:55:47.200 --> 3:55:53.120]  because what she did was multiple felonies a very big problem so the biggest fine scandal
[3:55:53.120 --> 3:55:59.360]  probably since the original wiki leaks and maybe even since vault seven so her lawyers have reached
[3:55:59.360 --> 3:56:06.240]  out to the fbi and they want to make a deal they're scrambling they are shook right so the house intel
[3:56:06.240 --> 3:56:13.760]  panel wanted susan rice to testify she said she was going to but then her lawyer sent a letter and
[3:56:13.760 --> 3:56:19.440]  said no she's not going to testify now but now that story is developed even more where her lawyers
[3:56:19.440 --> 3:56:25.920]  have reached out to the fbi they want to get immunity from her because she knows now with
[3:56:25.920 --> 3:56:32.000]  komi out of there she ended up in prison spying susan rice is what we call her we call her spying
[3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:37.840]  susan rice because she spied on everybody in journalism on the right of course she didn't
[3:56:37.840 --> 3:56:44.000]  spy on maggie haberman glint rush the new york times watching them post the media is all saying oh no
[3:56:44.000 --> 3:56:51.440]  big deal no big deal but could you imagine if it had been revealed that democrats have spied on
