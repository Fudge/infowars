[01:50.900 --> 01:57.900]  In Afghanistan, reports of a massacre, militants sought up a bus on one of the country's main highways.
[01:57.900 --> 02:04.900]  Afghan officials say the Taliban militants stopped the bus in a dangerous and remote part of southern Afghanistan.
[02:04.900 --> 02:10.900]  Took around 50 people hostage and ended up killing around 30 Afghan civilians.
[02:10.900 --> 02:15.900]  Afghan officials are reporting differing figures on the number of dead it could be higher.

[03:57.900 --> 04:06.900]  That's the Gist of a New York Times report that says the agency is hard pressed to find agents and resources to probe crimes linked to the current economic crisis.
[04:06.900 --> 04:14.900]  General Motors and Cerberus Capital Management have reportedly in fast-paced talks to merge General Motors and Crusher before the end of the month.

[06:31.900 --> 06:36.900]  Hello, everybody. Thank you for joining us today.
[06:36.900 --> 06:43.900]  I think it is Sunday, the 19th of October, 2000. And hey, we're going to be here live for the next two hours.
[06:43.900 --> 06:50.900]  We'll also have wide open phones on a host of issues at 877-590-5525.
[06:50.900 --> 06:55.900]  Whether you're listening on the AM and FM dial across the country, the internet at infowars.com and prisonplana.com.
[06:55.900 --> 07:02.900]  Global's Fort Wave Satellite. You are welcome to call in at 877-590-5525.
[07:02.900 --> 07:12.900]  All right. I want to try to be calm here today and really go over what we're facing with the financial crisis
[07:12.900 --> 07:19.900]  and really put it in clear, uncertain, for people that are uncertain out there about what's really happening,
[07:19.900 --> 07:30.900]  I want to put it in very, very clear terms for people that are uncertain so they can understand basically what we're dealing with as a society and what we're facing.
[07:30.900 --> 07:39.900]  Bottom line, everything that the global private banking cartel has said they would do to our society, they are now doing.
[07:39.900 --> 07:47.900]  A private group of families own the central banks of Europe, England and the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
[07:47.900 --> 07:55.900]  And they control most of the third world and second world nations of the planet through this same system.
[07:55.900 --> 08:05.900]  I was on international television yesterday, press TV that's seen in countries all across the world, international cable system.
[08:05.900 --> 08:13.900]  And I was arguing and debating with two of the financial experts they had and I would raise the news headlines that are in the BBC,
[08:13.900 --> 08:21.900]  in the Wall Street Journal, in the French news agency and just hundreds of publications showing video clips
[08:21.900 --> 08:30.900]  and reporting on what the heads of the private central banks of the world are doing through the heads of the different government systems,
[08:30.900 --> 08:44.900]  the different Treasury directors and different finance chiefs of the nations, France, Germany, England, the United States, Russia, Japan, China.
[08:44.900 --> 08:53.900]  And they are saying we're setting up a world government run by the private banks, a small intergroup of private banks worldwide.
[08:53.900 --> 09:00.900]  And we are going to set up a world currency, but that world currency will still be your national currency,
[09:00.900 --> 09:10.900]  it will just be pegged to and its value and the amount of money in circulation will be set worldwide.
[09:10.900 --> 09:18.900]  So it will still have the local look, but it really won't be a local or national or sovereign currency.
[09:18.900 --> 09:24.900]  And an example of that is a major newspaper like the Wall Street Journal.
[09:24.900 --> 09:29.900]  It gets printed all over the country to come to your door every morning.
[09:29.900 --> 09:36.900]  But it's a national slash international newspaper, but it gets printed in your state generally or in your region
[09:36.900 --> 09:42.900]  because there's no way to print them all in New York City and then have them all thrown on your doormat.
[09:42.900 --> 09:48.900]  Or what is there, like 20 different brands or varieties of sports illustrated.
[09:48.900 --> 09:55.900]  You have regional sports illustrated publications for football and other things, but still it's sports illustrated.
[09:55.900 --> 10:05.900]  Okay, so for over a decade, I have told you that what we were going to end up having would be a world banking system
[10:05.900 --> 10:12.900]  controlling our currency and controlling our national laws on finance, on banking, on the stock market.
[10:12.900 --> 10:18.900]  And they would do this by orchestrating a global financial meltdown, which they again are carrying out, they are orchestrating,
[10:18.900 --> 10:25.900]  and that they would then pose as the saviors and try to stampede governments and populations into accepting this.
[10:25.900 --> 10:32.900]  And I also told you that a new global tax was going to be set up, several new global taxes, a cap and trade tax,
[10:32.900 --> 10:39.900]  on quote, greenhouse emissions, carbon dioxide and others, a flat out carbon tax,
[10:39.900 --> 10:46.900]  and also the Tobin tax on any wire transfers or any type of banking activity, basically.
[10:46.900 --> 10:53.900]  And that will all be paid in to the private central bank consortium.
[10:53.900 --> 10:59.900]  Now, this was in trilateral commission documents, Council on Foreign Relations documents, Treasury Department documents
[10:59.900 --> 11:03.900]  in the United States going back 25, 30 years, same thing in Europe and England.
[11:03.900 --> 11:09.900]  And I would come on air and warn you about this and say this was coming in the future.
[11:09.900 --> 11:16.900]  They would destroy the dollar that they would set up in North American currencies, an Asian currency,
[11:16.900 --> 11:26.900]  an African currency, a European Union currency, a system to be integrated in to control populations.
[11:26.900 --> 11:31.900]  Because if you control the issuance and the amount of currency, the amount of liquidity, the amount of credit,
[11:31.900 --> 11:35.900]  you control the planet. This is a financial dictatorship.
[11:35.900 --> 11:41.900]  Now, it wasn't that I was a genius or I was even smart. I, decades ago, ran into this information.
[11:41.900 --> 11:44.900]  Now, for 13 years on air, I've been warning people that this was coming.
[11:44.900 --> 11:48.900]  This was coming around 2007 to 2009.
[11:48.900 --> 11:54.900]  And we've been predicting it, making films about it, having hundreds of top guests on about it, laying out a fact.
[11:54.900 --> 11:58.900]  And there I am debating on press TV.
[11:58.900 --> 12:02.900]  And I debate people on Russia today and Al Jazeera and BBC.
[12:02.900 --> 12:06.900]  And a lot of these programs, TV worldwide, radio worldwide.
[12:06.900 --> 12:10.900]  And every time on the show, it doesn't matter if it's Al Jazeera.
[12:10.900 --> 12:15.900]  It doesn't matter if it's press TV. It doesn't matter what it is. It doesn't matter if it's BBC.
[12:15.900 --> 12:20.900]  They will have major financial publication writers come on against me and say,
[12:20.900 --> 12:26.900]  you're crazy. There's no such thing as a new world order. There's no such thing as a call for a global currency.
[12:26.900 --> 12:34.900]  There is no such thing as a plan for a trilateral currency. And I've always told you, because the trilateral commission was set up to do this,
[12:34.900 --> 12:39.900]  that they would have the Asian block of currencies, the European Union block of currencies,
[12:39.900 --> 12:46.900]  and the North American Union block of currencies, and then all sub-currencies in those sub-regions,
[12:46.900 --> 12:52.900]  like the Caribbean and Central and South America, and the North American Union, which is the heart of it.
[12:52.900 --> 13:00.900]  And with Europe, you will have Africa and the Mediterranean Union under its control.
[13:00.900 --> 13:06.900]  And then with the Asian currency out of Japan and China, they're jockeying for who will control that.
[13:06.900 --> 13:10.900]  All your sub-countries under that, including Australia, will be under that currency.
[13:10.900 --> 13:17.900]  Now, all I'm doing is reading to you what the global banking elites say they are going to do.
[13:17.900 --> 13:25.900]  And I get nothing but denials. I mean, I have the Washington Post. I have the Associated Press.
[13:25.900 --> 13:31.900]  This is just Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I have a whole host of other mainstream news articles with headlines like
[13:31.900 --> 13:38.900]  EU leaders call for global currency. Here's Bloomberg today. This is Bloomberg today.
[13:38.900 --> 13:44.900]  Okay, you can't ignore this anymore, folks. This isn't a Jedi mind trick or a, you know,
[13:44.900 --> 13:51.900]  a parlor magician trick. The media is pulling with one hand saying none of this exists while they're setting it up.
[13:51.900 --> 13:55.900]  Now, this is Bloomberg Financial. We have a link up on infowars.com.
[13:55.900 --> 14:01.900]  ECB sees global tripolar currency system evolving.
[14:01.900 --> 14:09.900]  European Central Bank Council member Ed Wald, known to you, said a tripolar global currency system is developing between Asia,
[14:09.900 --> 14:15.900]  Europe, and the U.S. And then they go on in a lengthy article to detail everything we've told you,
[14:15.900 --> 14:20.900]  everything we've broken down, everything we've predicted. But it isn't hard to predict.
[14:20.900 --> 14:24.900]  You know, I use the analogy or the example of the TV guide.
[14:24.900 --> 14:30.900]  If I open the TV guide up and I say, oh, you know, coming up this Wednesday night is a TV show I want to see.
[14:30.900 --> 14:35.900]  And then my wife and I sit down at nine o'clock at night and turn the television on and it comes on.
[14:35.900 --> 14:39.900]  And my wife doesn't fall down at my feet and start worshiping me saying, you're psychic.
[14:39.900 --> 14:43.900]  How did you know? How did you know this was going to come on then?
[14:43.900 --> 14:46.900]  Well, it's in the TV guide.
[14:46.900 --> 14:52.900]  So, see, before this was being introduced to the public in the Wall Street Journal in Bloomberg, NAP, N-A-F-P,
[14:52.900 --> 14:57.900]  I mean, hundreds of publications, hundreds of publications.
[14:57.900 --> 15:01.900]  Before it was in the news, as it's been the last three weeks, it was never in the news.
[15:01.900 --> 15:07.900]  It was only in IMF, World Bank, United Nations, Club of Rome,
[15:07.900 --> 15:12.900]  Trilateral Commission, press releases, documents, white papers.
[15:12.900 --> 15:16.900]  Now, you'd have to go to the library back in the mid-90s when I was really waking up to all this and, you know,
[15:16.900 --> 15:19.900]  pull out their documents and I'd come and warm people on air and get laughed at.
[15:19.900 --> 15:21.900]  But now it's mainstream news.
[15:21.900 --> 15:26.900]  So, we're going to break down the fact that world government is being born right now.
[15:26.900 --> 15:33.900]  It's a very, very tyrannical and it plans to devalue the world's currencies in unison
[15:33.900 --> 15:39.900]  down to almost zero to bankrupt everyone but the inter-core financial system,
[15:39.900 --> 15:44.900]  which will then put everyone back into debt into their system and rebuild it.
[15:44.900 --> 15:49.900]  Okay, so this is the most important information you will ever hear when we get back.
[15:49.900 --> 15:51.900]  I'm not kidding. Stay with us.
[15:51.900 --> 15:56.900]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[15:56.900 --> 15:58.900]  and live out their golden years.
[15:58.900 --> 16:03.900]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical,
[16:03.900 --> 16:06.900]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[16:06.900 --> 16:10.900]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note,
[16:10.900 --> 16:14.900]  forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[16:14.900 --> 16:17.900]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book,
[16:17.900 --> 16:19.900]  The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[16:19.900 --> 16:24.900]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power,
[16:24.900 --> 16:28.900]  a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[16:28.900 --> 16:30.900]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[16:50.900 --> 16:52.900]  Benjamin Franklin once said,
[16:52.900 --> 16:57.900]  anyone willing to trade liberty for security deserves neither liberty nor security.
[16:57.900 --> 17:00.900]  Now, Mercer Films brings you Uncivil Liberties,

[19:10.900 --> 19:16.900]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[19:16.900 --> 19:20.900]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[19:20.900 --> 19:23.900]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[19:23.900 --> 19:27.900]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[19:27.900 --> 19:30.900]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated,
[19:30.900 --> 19:33.900]  the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses,
[19:33.900 --> 19:39.900]  the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[19:39.900 --> 19:43.900]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[19:43.900 --> 19:49.900]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them.com, the message of His Kingdom.
[19:53.900 --> 19:55.900]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[19:55.900 --> 20:05.900]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[20:05.900 --> 20:09.900]  There are several issues here.
[20:09.900 --> 20:15.900]  Not just the fact that there is a small group of private banks owned by private families
[20:15.900 --> 20:20.900]  that have the vast majority of the world's wealth,
[20:20.900 --> 20:25.900]  or that they changed the rules in the mid-90s and then in 99,
[20:25.900 --> 20:32.900]  getting rid of the Glass-Steagall Act where they could go from 10 to 1 fractional reserve banking,
[20:32.900 --> 20:38.900]  private banks can loan out on average $10 for every dollar they have.
[20:38.900 --> 20:41.900]  Well, in the mid-90s, they went ahead and said,
[20:41.900 --> 20:45.900]  no, we can loan out $100 for every $2 we have.
[20:45.900 --> 20:49.900]  And then in 99, they said, we can basically loan out unlimited.
[20:49.900 --> 20:53.900]  You can just do whatever you want, but only select banks.
[20:53.900 --> 21:00.900]  JP Morgan, Chase, Bank of America, just a few others.
[21:00.900 --> 21:08.900]  Only four major banks that are actually owned by the families that also own the private stock in the Federal Reserve.
[21:08.900 --> 21:11.900]  Okay? Listen to me carefully, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:11.900 --> 21:15.900]  When you watch regular financial news, you read the financial publications,
[21:15.900 --> 21:17.900]  you're going to be given limited information.
[21:17.900 --> 21:21.900]  Not so much that it's even a lie, it's just that they're lying by omission.
[21:21.900 --> 21:23.900]  Now, all that's changing now.
[21:23.900 --> 21:26.900]  You open up, you know, Bloomberg, you open up the Wall Street Journal,
[21:26.900 --> 21:30.900]  and it's all about New World Order, one world government, but oh, it's what's going to save you.
[21:30.900 --> 21:34.900]  Now, remember, a lot of you have been listening for 12 or more years.
[21:34.900 --> 21:38.900]  You remember me saying they are going to engineer a collapse of the dollar.
[21:38.900 --> 21:44.900]  I mean, back in the late 90s, I was ranting and raving with economists on about the derivatives bubble,
[21:44.900 --> 21:48.900]  which was tens of trillions then and could have completely bankrupted us.
[21:48.900 --> 21:54.900]  Now, it's over 1,000 trillion conservatively, and that's even in mainstream news.
[21:54.900 --> 21:59.900]  Mainstream news is saying it's around 550 trillion in derivatives,
[21:59.900 --> 22:04.900]  but the high-level economist, you know, Nobel Prize winners,
[22:04.900 --> 22:07.900]  former heads of the Treasury, we interview, are saying,
[22:07.900 --> 22:14.900]  it's well over one quadrillion or 1,000 trillion, probably one and a half quadrillion.
[22:14.900 --> 22:19.900]  And all the terms are wrong.
[22:19.900 --> 22:22.900]  They're telling the public that, oh, it's a bailout.
[22:22.900 --> 22:24.900]  The big banks are in trouble.
[22:24.900 --> 22:31.900]  But Business Week Monday had a headline dealing with the fact that the credit card debt
[22:31.900 --> 22:36.900]  over a trillion of it's about to come due, and that's going to be another big problem.
[22:36.900 --> 22:42.900]  But in that story that I covered on the Weekday Show at Nauseum, they admitted right there.
[22:42.900 --> 22:47.900]  Business Week said, oh, actually, this group of less than 10 major international banks,
[22:47.900 --> 22:52.900]  four here in the U.S., they're actually flush in cash and liquidity,
[22:52.900 --> 22:58.900]  and this is really good for them, and they control the federal regulators.
[22:58.900 --> 23:04.900]  You have this merger of government and banking, and they go out and they're grabbing smaller insurance companies, banks,
[23:04.900 --> 23:07.900]  and a lot of which are actually solvent.
[23:07.900 --> 23:13.900]  So to put it in layman's terms, the private families cut off the money supply about a year and a half ago
[23:13.900 --> 23:17.900]  to corporations, the real economy, individuals.
[23:17.900 --> 23:23.900]  They issued this massive debt bubble by packaging toxic securities and other things
[23:23.900 --> 23:26.900]  and issuing themselves unlimited liquidity.
[23:26.900 --> 23:30.900]  Now they terrorize the public and say, oh, the market's going down, oh, the economy's in trouble,
[23:30.900 --> 23:35.900]  there's a credit freeze on, a credit crisis, because banks don't trust each other.
[23:35.900 --> 23:41.900]  And then the very banks that are working with Henry Paulson and others are given well over a trillion dollars.
[23:41.900 --> 23:44.900]  And the news, by the way, now is admitting the bailout's five trillion.
[23:44.900 --> 23:48.900]  As we told you two weeks ago, just type in the bailout now reaches five trillion.
[23:48.900 --> 23:52.900]  You'll see a bunch of mainstream news articles in the last three or four days.
[23:52.900 --> 23:57.900]  I told you, five trillion. Five trillion's conservative. Some say it'll go above 10 trillion.
[23:57.900 --> 24:01.900]  Now, now understand the whole GDP of the country is three trillion in a year.
[24:01.900 --> 24:05.900]  So what are these private banks doing? They're the solvent big central banks.
[24:05.900 --> 24:09.900]  They're the big boys. Other banks are just playing games compared to them.
[24:09.900 --> 24:12.900]  They own stock in the private fellow reserve. They control the government.
[24:12.900 --> 24:17.900]  This isn't the government buying into the banks. This is the banks becoming the government.
[24:17.900 --> 24:23.900]  The government dumps trillions of dollars into them and then gets no voting shares in Bank of America,
[24:23.900 --> 24:28.900]  in Citigroup, in JP Morgan Chase, and then the fourth one.
[24:28.900 --> 24:33.900]  But it's kind of the weaker fourth. It's smaller compared to the others, but it's still in that class.
[24:33.900 --> 24:38.900]  And that's, of course, Wells Fargo.
[24:38.900 --> 24:42.900]  So they're taking over the government, not the government taking over them.
[24:42.900 --> 24:47.900]  This has been called socialism. This is not socialism. This is called robbery.
[24:47.900 --> 24:53.900]  The people were being taxed to then give this money back to the public.
[24:53.900 --> 24:56.900]  Helicopter Ben Bernacchio said, I'll dump money out of helicopters.
[24:56.900 --> 24:59.900]  Well, he's not dumping money out of helicopters over your neighborhoods.
[24:59.900 --> 25:02.900]  He's dumping it over the fellow reserve and a few private banks and that's it.
[25:02.900 --> 25:06.900]  And so what are they doing? Oh, it didn't unfreeze the markets.
[25:06.900 --> 25:10.900]  The banks need trillions more. They're still not loaning. They're still not talking to each other.
[25:10.900 --> 25:14.900]  But last Monday, seven days ago, they did meet with Henry Paulson behind closed doors
[25:14.900 --> 25:19.900]  and the media said, oh, it's secret. And even CNBC to their credit said, this is completely illegal.
[25:19.900 --> 25:23.900]  This is out of control. They're having secret meetings and not telling the public what's going on.
[25:23.900 --> 25:29.900]  And Henry Paulson is giving over $25 billion with Mr. Kashkari, his former VP,
[25:29.900 --> 25:33.900]  is the guy he appoints to hand out the trillion plus bucks so far.
[25:33.900 --> 25:37.900]  And they're handing a bunch of it out to Goldman Sachs.
[25:37.900 --> 25:41.900]  And you've got Robert Rubin who changed the rules in 95 and again, 99.
[25:41.900 --> 25:44.900]  Bill Clinton's Treasury Secretary and then Summers did the same thing.
[25:44.900 --> 25:47.900]  And their former Goldman Sachs.
[25:47.900 --> 25:51.900]  So Goldman Sachs is the management group for the private fellow reserve families.
[25:51.900 --> 25:55.900]  They're the brokerage firm that is handing this trillion plus. It's already over a trillion.
[25:55.900 --> 25:59.900]  They're talking about $4 trillion more to them.
[25:59.900 --> 26:02.900]  And then they're going to take the money offshore. They're going to buy real assets,
[26:02.900 --> 26:05.900]  whether they're going to inflate that, they're going to leverage it out.
[26:05.900 --> 26:10.900]  They're going to do a leverage buyouts of companies in this depressed economy.
[26:10.900 --> 26:13.900]  So they depress the economy by shutting liquidity off.
[26:13.900 --> 26:18.900]  They then panic the Congress and the parliaments of Europe into giving them what is a 2.2 trillion in Europe so far,
[26:18.900 --> 26:22.900]  pumping into their coffers.
[26:22.900 --> 26:29.900]  And then after they've done that, they continue to cut off liquidity and cash to the main street.
[26:29.900 --> 26:34.900]  It completely goes into recession and then depression and then they buy everything up for pennies on the dollar.
[26:34.900 --> 26:36.900]  But that isn't enough for them.
[26:36.900 --> 26:40.900]  In the short term, they can use the dollars and the euros while they still have some value,
[26:40.900 --> 26:45.900]  though they're massively devalued because of inflation, issuing too many of them.
[26:45.900 --> 26:48.900]  In the short term, they can buy everything up.
[26:48.900 --> 26:53.900]  But in the midterm, a year to two years, 25 to 30% compounded inflation.
[26:53.900 --> 26:55.900]  We're already at 15% a year.
[26:55.900 --> 26:57.900]  You know, they'll tell you the government will tell you at 6.5.
[26:57.900 --> 27:00.900]  But every mainline economist says, ah, it's more like 12 to 16.
[27:00.900 --> 27:01.900]  I'll just say 15.
[27:01.900 --> 27:04.900]  The point is you're talking 25, 30% by next year,
[27:04.900 --> 27:06.900]  compounding year after year.
[27:06.900 --> 27:08.900]  And that's in Bloomberg today.
[27:08.900 --> 27:10.900]  The World Bank, you can go read it.
[27:10.900 --> 27:11.900]  ECB is noteworthy.
[27:11.900 --> 27:15.900]  They see global tripolar currency system evolving.
[27:15.900 --> 27:21.900]  And it says right here that they're skeptical the US dollar's centrality can be revived.
[27:21.900 --> 27:26.900]  And they go on to say we see the dollar fully collapsing in the next few years.
[27:26.900 --> 27:30.900]  And so they say we need a new global currency system.
[27:30.900 --> 27:34.900]  But people still want to see the color of their money, you know, pink, blue, green, whatever it is,
[27:34.900 --> 27:36.900]  different parts of the world, brown.
[27:36.900 --> 27:42.900]  So we'll control it and control the issuance of it, controlling those nations fully.
[27:42.900 --> 27:46.900]  And then those banks will be paid interest for the right for the government to issue currency.
[27:46.900 --> 27:50.900]  So you pay your global taxes always indirectly to the private banks,
[27:50.900 --> 27:53.900]  the private intergroup, less than 10 worldwide for in the US.
[27:53.900 --> 28:03.900]  But now you're going to be paying basically many more taxes, including a carbon tax and a Tobin currency trade tax.
[28:03.900 --> 28:08.900]  It's going to get it all sorts of different types of money transfers and stock transfers,
[28:08.900 --> 28:10.900]  not just the original Tobin.
[28:10.900 --> 28:12.900]  So they engineer the crisis.
[28:12.900 --> 28:17.900]  They offer the solution, which is a new world order.
[28:17.900 --> 28:18.900]  That's their words.
[28:18.900 --> 28:26.900]  I mean, Gordon Brown, Nicholas Sarkozy, all of them are calling, quote, new world order, global currency, global regulation by the banks.
[28:26.900 --> 28:28.900]  And they're the ones that engineered it all.
[28:28.900 --> 28:31.900]  And they are by design, the banks want to bankrupt things.
[28:31.900 --> 28:33.900]  They're not free market.
[28:33.900 --> 28:37.900]  These corrupt banks, these central bankers, they engage in fraud.
[28:37.900 --> 28:41.900]  They want to implode economies so they can consolidate them and have management over them.
[28:41.900 --> 28:43.900]  And that's been stated over and over again.
[28:43.900 --> 28:45.900]  The international banks, it's why they fund socialism and communism.
[28:45.900 --> 28:48.900]  Those are systems that consolidate the population's wealth.
[28:48.900 --> 28:51.900]  When we come back, we'll take your phone calls and get more into this and help.

[33:27.900 --> 33:31.900]  And I've got my own ideas historically.
[33:31.900 --> 33:38.900]  But for those that just joined us, let me recap. There is a financial international order.
[33:38.900 --> 33:49.900]  This is mainline history for those that wish to read the history books that are given to the Foreign Service people in high level CIA section chiefs and others.
[33:49.900 --> 33:55.900]  Like Carol Quigley, the head of Georgetown Political Science, Bill Clinton's mentor. Carol Quigley in 68 wrote Tragedy and Hope.
[33:55.900 --> 34:05.900]  And in there he has all the quotes about how the private central banks of the world had a far reaching plan to set up a world government and a one world currency.
[34:05.900 --> 34:12.900]  You all seem to know that the heads of the IMF World Bank, Treasury Secretary Paulson, are, quote, rabbit environmentalist.
[34:12.900 --> 34:17.900]  He heads up a lot of the activities of nature conservancy, taking people's private property. They think humans are bad.
[34:17.900 --> 34:27.900]  I think we live too well. They want to take our wealth. They want easily managed, basically bankrupt third world slaves.
[34:27.900 --> 34:38.900]  And now they have engineered the crisis. They have been given immunity, unlimited power in Europe and the United States through the central banks to basically do whatever they want.
[34:38.900 --> 34:45.900]  The private central banks are taking over the government functions and being given government power. It is not a banker bailout.
[34:45.900 --> 34:50.900]  It is a banker takeover. And then what did we tell you years ago and then leading up to this in the last few months?
[34:50.900 --> 35:00.900]  I said, when they get this, I said this three shows ago. I said this last week. I say it on every show now, every radio broadcast, every TV show I do.
[35:00.900 --> 35:12.900]  I have laid out the facts for everybody and said they are going to propose a world government, a new world order run by the private banks that have already bankrupted all the governments and control them with just fiat currency.
[35:12.900 --> 35:23.900]  They create of nothing that they then claim the public owes. And not only are you going to have hyperinflation that evaluates your savings and your paycheck and your fixed incomes, particularly my friends,
[35:23.900 --> 35:30.900]  but I've got several headlines up on prisonplanet.com and infoworks.com for mainstream news saying get ready for a huge tax bill.
[35:30.900 --> 35:44.900]  They are already with current U.S. debt the congressional budget office years ago projected that the American people by 2014 would be paying about 85% taxes as they do in France and many other areas of the world just for the interest on the debt.
[35:44.900 --> 35:51.900]  But it's a fraudulent debt. The banks just write it off, but then they sign it onto our backs and then inflate the currency.
[35:51.900 --> 36:06.900]  But it's so amazing to read Bloomberg Financial. ECB sees global tripolar currency system evolving. European Central Bank Council member Edwald Notui said a tripolar global currency system is developing between Asia, Europe and the U.S.
[36:06.900 --> 36:12.900]  We always told you be trilateral, meaning three. The North American Union, the European Union, the Asian Union.
[36:12.900 --> 36:23.900]  And I go on radio shows. I go on TV shows. I was on international television yesterday for an hour on a show called Four Corners on Press TV.
[36:23.900 --> 36:27.900]  By the way, we just linked to that up on prisonplanet.com after the show. You can go watch it if you'd like.
[36:27.900 --> 36:35.900]  And they had this big financial writer from Russia, big financial writer from London on and they would say, well, yes, the banks are taking over, but it's what they have to do.
[36:35.900 --> 36:46.900]  They didn't mean to cause this. And there's no such thing as a new world order and there's no call for global currency. And I just fired out on the show four or five headlines yesterday on Saturday about this.
[36:46.900 --> 36:57.900]  Now, here's one from AFP, Agency French Press. It's a little one minute news clip. It's a video news clip, as you just heard the start of there.
[36:57.900 --> 37:05.900]  Now, listen carefully. At the very end, they talk about a global currency and I could play clip after clip of them calling for a new world order.
[37:05.900 --> 37:15.900]  In the words of the Prime Minister of England, Gordon Brown, a global system run by the banks with global management so these crises never happen again. So here it is.
[37:15.900 --> 37:32.900]  Another whiff of panic hit Asian and European stock markets on Thursday, just as European leaders were meeting for a summit in Brussels. Their aim show a unified front in efforts to reform the financial system, bringing it back under control.
[37:32.900 --> 37:40.900]  What's been the recipe for our recent success? Our unity, coordination, the will to move forward. We can't give up faced with this crisis.
[37:40.900 --> 37:56.900]  EU members have put pressure on the United States for an early meeting of the G8 with emerging countries. The French President and the EU Commission Chief are to meet with the US President this weekend to discuss the proposal.
[37:56.900 --> 38:11.900]  Nicolas Sarkozy's initiative, which we backed from the beginning this summit, the meeting on Saturday and the consultation with all our partners, would allow us to make great progress.
[38:11.900 --> 38:22.900]  Europe wants to present a blueprint for a new worldwide currency system, just as urgent are measures to fight an oncoming recession.
[38:22.900 --> 38:31.900]  All right. Now, that's AFP. That's as big as Reuters into AP. So that's the European, basically, AP out of France.
[38:31.900 --> 38:43.900]  Now, I have clip after clip of this. I mean, if you just Google, World Leaders Call for New World Order Banking System, you will read Financial Times of London, BBC, AP, Reuters.
[38:43.900 --> 38:57.900]  But it's still not on our nightly news, though, saying government for and by the private central banks and that they will set currency values for all the nations of the world in three giant blocks.
[38:57.900 --> 39:05.900]  Now, here's another example. In my film, Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement that came out 14 months ago, that came out a little more than a year ago.
[39:05.900 --> 39:15.900]  I show a press conference with George Bush, the head of the European Union, Barroso, and the Chancellor of Germany, Merkel.
[39:15.900 --> 39:22.900]  And they say, we have the European Union. We have the North American Union. We're already merging them right now.
[39:22.900 --> 39:28.900]  Then they go on to say, by 2010, they'll be fully merged. Now, you go out and tell the public that they laugh at you.
[39:28.900 --> 39:44.900]  They have press conferences in the Rose Garden outside with the President saying it. Now, in 2005, then head of Canada, Harper, Paul Harper, then President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, and then President Bush,
[39:44.900 --> 39:57.900]  they'll be President from the three or four months, met at Baylor up in North Central Texas. And they said the agreement's secret, the public can't see it. Well, judicial watching others sued and got a copy.
[39:57.900 --> 40:02.900]  And it said, we've got to keep this secret from the public. This is Endgame, by the way, because judicial watching read it.
[40:02.900 --> 40:10.900]  We've got to keep this secret. We're going to have a major currency crisis, security, prosperity partnership. We'll use terrorism. We'll use a threat of global warming.
[40:10.900 --> 40:20.900]  We'll use a threat of financial collapse to get the public to accept this. I mean, it's even in the agreement how to lie to us. We have this bombshell smoking gun info.
[40:20.900 --> 40:29.900]  We warn the public what's going to happen. We tell you years before there's going to be a commodities crisis. There's going to be a derivatives crisis starting with subprime mortgages.
[40:29.900 --> 40:36.900]  We go cover the Bilderberg Group meeting where all these banking heads meet once a year, three years ago, two and a half years ago, that was in Canada and Ottawa.
[40:36.900 --> 40:49.900]  We go there. I even get arrested trying to cover it. And we come out and say, our sources inside tell us that they're going to pop the subprime mortgage within a year and a half and use that as the pretext to blame it on the public and bring in a new World Order Banking System.
[40:49.900 --> 40:58.900]  There'll be a trilateral world currency system. We lay out, it's in my film. It's in the extras. It's in all the interviews, the articles we wrote.
[40:58.900 --> 41:14.900]  Go back to those June articles, 2006, read them. It's exactly what's happening. And the public was preconditioned to not be able to deal with this or face this years ago.
[41:14.900 --> 41:29.900]  Here's an example. I get on the air in 1995. People are calling into my local TV shows saying, my cousin said, black helicopters raided his town. There were troops on the streets. And I was a mainline Republican then. And I said, you're a Cooke. You're a nut.
[41:29.900 --> 41:39.900]  No such thing as that exists because the media had said Cooke's talk about black helicopters. And then in 1996, 97, 98, they did urban warfare in Texas. Police chiefs threw them out.
[41:39.900 --> 41:49.900]  They tried to pay off the San Antonio police chief. I interviewed the head of Kingsville emergency management. Then I said, no, they're real. It's an urban warfare drills to prepare the public and local governments for martial law.
[41:49.900 --> 41:55.900]  Now that's mainstream news in the Army times. And I had Ron Paul on this week saying, yes, they were threatened with martial law on the floor of the house.
[41:55.900 --> 42:03.900]  Other congressmen were and he thinks martial law is a real threat and it's on C-span and Glenn Beck covered it last week. So they're getting ready for martial law.
[42:03.900 --> 42:09.900]  The point is, though, it worked on me for a while. They said, Cooke's talk about black helicopters.
[42:09.900 --> 42:16.900]  And I'm like a mainline Republican host when I first got on. I mean, I was anti-fellow reserve, kind of a Ron Paul type, but you know, still a lot more, quote, mainline.
[42:16.900 --> 42:23.900]  Well, I was ignorant. So see, before they turn the urban warfare loose on us, they said, Cooke's talk about this. It doesn't exist.
[42:23.900 --> 42:30.900]  Before they turn a new world order loose and a global banking system, they say, Cooke's talk about a world currency. It doesn't exist.
[42:30.900 --> 42:39.900]  Cooke's talk about a North American union. Then they set it up and the public won't talk about it because they heard Cooke's talk about it.
[42:39.900 --> 42:51.900]  I mean, you understand the psychological warfare that's being used against you. I promise, straight to your phone calls and we get back on the other side of this quick break as world government takes over.

[44:54.900 --> 44:57.900]  And look, they show off my new toenails too.
[44:57.900 --> 45:00.900]  New toenails? What happened to the old ones?
[45:00.900 --> 45:07.900]  They're not really new, just clear and healthy looking. Remember how embarrassed I was? They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[45:07.900 --> 45:16.900]  Well, they sure look clear now. I wish I could wear sandals again. My toenails are a disaster. Look, this one looks white and that one's thick and yellow.

[45:52.900 --> 45:58.900]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking. When it comes to this economy, the banks are crashing, the stock market's a mess.
[45:58.900 --> 46:06.900]  There's the mortgage crisis. There's the lending crisis. There is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis.
[46:06.900 --> 46:12.900]  And we are paralyzed a little bit. We don't know exactly how to respond to it. I don't know what to say. What can you do? Do what you can do.
[46:12.900 --> 46:18.900]  That's what you do. You do what you can do. What I can do is I can put some food away. I know there's a global food shortage.
[46:18.900 --> 46:26.900]  I can read it. I can go to efoodsdirect.com, read hundreds of articles about this. I can go up on the Google website and Google food shortage and see the world's a mess.
[46:26.900 --> 46:36.900]  I know it. You know it. Look at the prices. Look where they're headed. Be prepared. Take care of yourself. You owe your family some security, some sense of self-being, a little bit of self-reliance is a good idea right now.

[46:52.900 --> 47:06.900]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[47:06.900 --> 47:16.900]  All right. We're back live. Coming up the next hour, I'm going to get into solutions to stop the global banking cartel from setting up what all powerful elites have dreamed of for history.
[47:16.900 --> 47:25.900]  Worldwide empires. There have been quite a few like the British Empire and others. They convinced the public that empires don't exist, especially financial ones. Well, they do.
[47:25.900 --> 47:33.900]  And also Barack Obama. He's gotten three times the Wall Street money that John McCain has. I'm not saying vote for either one. They're both bought and paid for.
[47:33.900 --> 47:41.900]  But he is the heir apparent. And he's gotten four times the Goldman Sachs money. So people that want change, you're going to get change. It's going to get a lot worse.
[47:41.900 --> 47:49.900]  But because he's a liberal guy and looks different, I guess people will buy into that. It's like a different paint job on a car, but same car.
[47:49.900 --> 47:57.900]  Very, very serious there, ladies and gentlemen. Just the facts. All these poor people suckered again by a corporate front man.
[47:57.900 --> 48:04.900]  George Bush runs nothing and Barack Obama is going to run nothing as president. If he is elected president, you just watch.
[48:04.900 --> 48:15.900]  And we've only got about 14, 15 days now until we find out with that. Let's go to your phone calls. Daniel and Carl and Steve and Doug and Joe and Jay.
[48:15.900 --> 48:20.900]  Daniel, you're on the air from Ohio. Worldwide welcome.
[48:20.900 --> 48:30.900]  Excellent. I'm so excited to be on the show. So my question is, I love my job. I'm going to be a dentist next year, going in the Navy.
[48:30.900 --> 48:39.900]  And my question is, how do I deal with fluoride and mercury and fillings, vaccinations, stuff like that?
[48:39.900 --> 48:48.900]  You don't. You don't. And it's against the law to give troops experimental vaccines, but they break the law and have given them smallpox and anthrax shots.
[48:48.900 --> 48:57.900]  That's killed a whole bunch of them. That's been confirmed. Mainstream news. Just Google that. And there's an article today on infowars.com about how they've given the manufacturer liability protection.
[48:57.900 --> 49:00.900]  And so they use you as guinea pigs.
[49:00.900 --> 49:06.900]  Right. But how do I like address like fluoride as a dentist? I constantly have to tell people, you know, you need to have fluoride toothpaste.
[49:06.900 --> 49:14.900]  Oh, well, let me tell you, the American Dental Association two years ago said they no longer recommend fluoride and that it's poisonous and dangerous.
[49:14.900 --> 49:19.900]  Right. Pardon me? To kids. I thought I'd heard you say that. Yes. Yes. Yes. Well, just Google it for yourself.
[49:19.900 --> 49:25.900]  But they're saying it's bad. It's toxic and the children don't need it. But instead on the store shelves, they have fluoride water for kids.
[49:25.900 --> 49:32.900]  And of course, it's not even the good type of fluoride and small levels you do need for your teeth, which is calcium fluoride.
[49:32.900 --> 49:36.900]  It's sodium fluoride. What about mercury and amalgam?
[49:36.900 --> 49:40.900]  Well, they're already starting to phase that out. And I would go with the tooth colored fillings.
[49:40.900 --> 49:45.900]  You know, my dad is a dentist and didn't believe all this stuff. But now he actually looked at all the documents and said, I'm right.
[49:45.900 --> 49:51.900]  He's also heard top dentist on my show and scientists talk about it. Had the head of the toxicology for the EPA, the EPA.
[49:51.900 --> 49:57.900]  They've had a poll over 90 percent of their scientists say that fluoride shouldn't be in the water.
[49:57.900 --> 50:02.900]  But the government says we don't care. See, 90 percent want to control our borders. Government, both parties say no.
[50:02.900 --> 50:11.900]  80 plus percent don't want to be in Iraq. Both governments, you know, both parties say no. You get 90 plus percent of EPA scientists signing a letter a couple years ago,
[50:11.900 --> 50:18.900]  having huge demonstrations saying take it out of the water. EPA, their bosses say no. And you can pull that up as well.
[50:18.900 --> 50:20.900]  So I don't know what to say to you, sir.
[50:20.900 --> 50:26.900]  Can you think of any alternative fluoride? I mean, because I don't need fluoride. You need people to clean their teeth.
[50:26.900 --> 50:35.900]  You know, as a degree dentist that most of it is, you know, most of the problem is caused because of gum disease and because of buildup.
[50:35.900 --> 50:42.900]  And if people just get cleanings every three to six months and brush your teeth twice a day with Tom's of Maine,
[50:42.900 --> 50:46.900]  non fluoride toothpaste are going to be just fine. Look at my teeth. Look at those suckers.
[50:46.900 --> 50:52.900]  And those suckers hadn't had fluoride on them in a decade. Look at them. Look at those chompers. Not a cavity.
[50:52.900 --> 51:00.900]  I had developmental pits in my wisdom teeth, which I kept. But, you know, those are those that don't know your dentist holes in them that came in congenitally.
[51:00.900 --> 51:04.900]  You know, but I had those filled. That's it.
[51:04.900 --> 51:10.900]  I see. All right. Well, that's all my questions I have for you. Just want a little bit of advice on that.
[51:10.900 --> 51:14.900]  Well, you're a degree dentist. I bet you can figure it out from the literature. But thank you, sir.
[51:14.900 --> 51:17.900]  I get my dad on here. You can do that. Get Dr. Jones on. He's also an oral surgeon.
[51:17.900 --> 51:21.900]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Wisconsin. Joe, you're on the air.
[51:21.900 --> 51:25.900]  Hey, Alex, I'd like to cover some of these rations I've gotten about the bank things.
[51:25.900 --> 51:31.900]  And I've also got some good news for you off the air. But when I've asked people, you know what the Federal Reserve is,
[51:31.900 --> 51:35.900]  most people say, uh, isn't that federal? I say no.
[51:35.900 --> 51:37.900]  Like Federal Express or Federal Plumbing?
[51:37.900 --> 51:42.900]  Well, no. They thought it was like a part of government. And I said, no, it's a private institution.
[51:42.900 --> 51:45.900]  And we had one of the heads of the World Bank on C-SPAN last week. Somebody called in and says,
[51:45.900 --> 51:50.900]  Alex Jones and Ron Paul said the Federal Reserve's private. And he goes, no, it's not. It's government.
[51:50.900 --> 51:51.900]  No, the sky's blue.
[51:51.900 --> 51:58.900]  Well, I mean, they're in the white paper. I mean, they're in the white pages. The Federal Reserve is private. Period.
[51:58.900 --> 52:03.900]  Well, people have also said that the bailout was necessary or else we will go into a depression.
[52:03.900 --> 52:06.900]  But then we have all these headlines about the banks won't give anybody the money.
[52:06.900 --> 52:11.900]  Well, of course they're not. They're bringing in the depression to blow things out and consolidate it.
[52:11.900 --> 52:17.900]  And every time I try to tell them that, that no, the Federal Reserve is there to ensure that we have economic instability.
[52:17.900 --> 52:21.900]  They're like, oh, that's right. They promised we'd have no more depressions after 1913.
[52:21.900 --> 52:26.900]  We got the Federal Reserve and they engineered the Great Depression. That's in the congressional record.
[52:26.900 --> 52:27.900]  They engineered it.
[52:27.900 --> 52:30.900]  And then they start blaming capitalism. They say, hey, communism works.
[52:30.900 --> 52:36.900]  And they say, what about that Soviet Union? What's wrong with that? And they just don't get it.
[52:36.900 --> 52:39.900]  Yeah, what's wrong with 100 million people getting killed by the government?
[52:39.900 --> 52:43.900]  And then they say that, oh, Barack will fix it. And they know that McCain is a dead fish.
[52:43.900 --> 52:48.900]  You know, they agree on that. And they're going to be suckered by him because the guy's daddy was black.
[52:48.900 --> 52:52.900]  So he must be different. I got news for you. There's evil white people. There's evil black people.
[52:52.900 --> 52:57.900]  Obama isn't even evil. He is a puppet, a minion, a front man of the big tax-free foundations.
[52:57.900 --> 53:00.900]  I'm going to put you on hold. You can tell the guys what the good news is.
[53:00.900 --> 53:04.900]  Let's talk to Jay in Massachusetts. You're on the air, Jay.
[53:04.900 --> 53:06.900]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex? Good.
[53:06.900 --> 53:13.900]  Yeah, I was up here in the Northeast. It's pretty difficult to try to, like, wake people up. But people are so, like, delusional up here.
[53:13.900 --> 53:16.900]  They don't even, you know, you can't even get through anybody up here.
[53:16.900 --> 53:22.900]  I tried talking to some people in my classes. You know, they just, they just laugh. They don't even want to know.
[53:22.900 --> 53:26.900]  Well, that's why the elite are moving on us with so much tyranny is they know the public's dumbed down.
[53:26.900 --> 53:33.900]  90-plus percent people were against the Baker takeover bill known as the bailout, but they still don't have any idea just how serious it is.
[53:33.900 --> 53:36.900]  They have an idea it's bad. They have no idea how bad it is.
[53:36.900 --> 53:39.900]  Yep, basically.
[53:39.900 --> 53:41.900]  What else is on your mind?
[53:41.900 --> 53:46.900]  Yeah, I was just wondering what would be a good idea to, if any products we should boycott.
[53:46.900 --> 53:50.900]  I was thinking about boycotting some Pepsi products and not buying any or not.
[53:50.900 --> 53:55.900]  Look, it's healthy for the economy to boycott any big, you know, brand names.
[53:55.900 --> 54:00.900]  If you have to look at their policies, if they're supporting gun control, if they're supporting open borders,
[54:00.900 --> 54:09.900]  if they're supporting anything new world order, but it's not good to boycott something, you know, if you don't know they're doing something bad.
[54:09.900 --> 54:16.900]  Instead of boycotting, I think it's better to support groups and organizations that are pro-US, pro-sovereignty, anti-globalization.
[54:16.900 --> 54:22.900]  Yeah, I just switched. I just took my money out of Bank of America and put it in a local bank, so I guess that's one step.
[54:22.900 --> 54:30.900]  That's one step that certainly is, but see, it's a catch-22 because the local bank might not be secure, but the big, greedy new world order bank may be.
[54:30.900 --> 54:35.900]  Yeah, and then the regulators could come and snatch up that bank and it wouldn't matter anyway.
[54:35.900 --> 54:40.900]  Absolutely. Good to hear from you, but you're at least thinking. You're trying to go for solutions.
[54:40.900 --> 54:44.900]  The big solution, I'm going to get into it more in the next hour, is awakening people going,
[54:44.900 --> 54:51.900]  okay, do you want a group of private banks in Europe to set the value of our currency? Do you want to be regulated internationally?
[54:51.900 --> 54:57.900]  The World Trade Organization runs our trade as more power than Congress. It was set up in 95. That's criminal.
[54:57.900 --> 55:02.900]  We need to get more power locally, not more power taken away to the international level.
[55:02.900 --> 55:06.900]  Let's go ahead and take another call here. Carl in Canada, you're on the air. Welcome.
[55:06.900 --> 55:12.900]  Hey, how are you doing? Well, I have a couple things I want to say. I'm going to try to keep it short.
[55:12.900 --> 55:17.900]  I see it's only going to get worse. These two candidates aren't going to do a thing.
[55:17.900 --> 55:23.900]  The total puppets, absolutely. But Barack Obama can fool the public more and make people think it's changed
[55:23.900 --> 55:26.900]  and sucker them longer. That's why the money's on him.
[55:26.900 --> 55:32.900]  Yeah, the people up here in Canada recently, we elected Harper, basically, and they were suckers
[55:32.900 --> 55:36.900]  and they went along and we have the same prime minister here now.
[55:36.900 --> 55:39.900]  And they're doing all the same banker takeovers. It's international.
[55:39.900 --> 55:46.900]  Yeah, but I agree with you. A couple things I disagree. I believe that we've got to keep getting the word out.
[55:46.900 --> 55:48.900]  That's what we can do about it.
[55:48.900 --> 55:51.900]  Well, I agree with you. Keep educating the public.
[55:51.900 --> 55:56.900]  Yeah, and I believe it's only going to get worse. And I believe this is part of this antichrist system,
[55:56.900 --> 55:59.900]  this whole new world order. It's one and the same thing.
[55:59.900 --> 56:03.900]  And crisis come back and rule the world based on love and based on justice.
[56:03.900 --> 56:06.900]  And these people want to rule the world based on greed and...
[56:06.900 --> 56:08.900]  Well, I don't know what we disagree about, sir.
[56:08.900 --> 56:10.900]  I think the two are going to clash.
[56:10.900 --> 56:15.900]  Christ is going to come back with his government to rule the world with love and justice.
[56:15.900 --> 56:18.900]  And this one world government, is it going to get their power?
[56:18.900 --> 56:21.900]  Yeah, I mean, here's the deal.
[56:21.900 --> 56:27.900]  The Nazis, people in Germany thought that was the antichrist and it was in the world, so they laid down and didn't fight him.
[56:27.900 --> 56:31.900]  And people in Africa, when they're always being slaughtered, think it's the end of the world so they don't stand up.
[56:31.900 --> 56:34.900]  And the founding fathers, they were told, oh, it's God's will, don't stand up.
[56:34.900 --> 56:37.900]  I'm going to do the right thing. Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[56:37.900 --> 56:44.900]  Most of our churches are paid for by the government. 501c3, FEMA program, where the preachers are paid,
[56:44.900 --> 56:46.900]  26,000 of them, that's mainstream news.
[56:46.900 --> 56:50.900]  Yes, folks, we broke it a year before it was in the news, when it was secret.
[56:50.900 --> 56:56.900]  It started five years ago to train them to teach their flocks, to submit to government, to go along, to turn their guns in,
[56:56.900 --> 56:59.900]  Romans 13 being misinterpreted.
[56:59.900 --> 57:07.900]  But, you know, bottom line, whether you're an atheist, a Christian, a Hindu, a New Ager, whatever, you had better not want a New World Order.
[57:07.900 --> 57:10.900]  You know, a lot of New Agers say, well, we don't want this evil banker New World Order,
[57:10.900 --> 57:13.900]  but we want the loving global government that's coming.
[57:13.900 --> 57:18.900]  And when you look at the New World Order, it's actually pushing the whole New Age agenda.
[57:18.900 --> 57:21.900]  That's just a fact. I mean, you can say what you want about it.
[57:21.900 --> 57:25.900]  I'm just reporting facts here, and then it's up for you to decide.
[57:25.900 --> 57:29.900]  When we get back, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to break down what it will be like under the world government
[57:29.900 --> 57:33.900]  if we don't turn it around and stop it and more solutions, as well as your phone calls.
[57:33.900 --> 57:39.900]  Also have an incredible police state stack of news here dealing with forced inoculations.

[58:12.900 --> 58:15.900]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[58:15.900 --> 58:17.900]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[58:17.900 --> 58:21.900]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[58:21.900 --> 58:24.900]  It is liquid. It is private. It owes no one.
[58:24.900 --> 58:28.900]  It cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[58:41.900 --> 58:47.900]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, we need radical change if we're to avert becoming a third world nation.
[58:47.900 --> 58:53.900]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical natural alternative health solutions.
[58:53.900 --> 58:55.900]  Introducing Orgon Products.
[58:55.900 --> 59:00.900]  Orgon is the universal life force, the basic building block of all matter on the material planet.
[59:00.900 --> 59:05.900]  Orgon electro-medicine is the wave of the future dating back to the late 1800s.
[59:05.900 --> 59:12.900]  Wilhelm Reich Orgon used cloudbuster technology that can now be applied in your home for dramatic energy savings of up to 25%.
[59:12.900 --> 59:16.900]  The possible uses for this device are only limited by your imagination.
[59:16.900 --> 59:21.900]  For less than the cost of a doctor's visit, you can have a device that could lead to the end of all your problems.

[59:41.900 --> 59:55.900]  And one top official is pushing for more k-
[59:55.900 --> 1:00:01.900]  I. Colin Powell, who was President Bush's first Secretary of State, is endorsing Barack Obama.
[1:00:01.900 --> 1:00:15.900]  Because of his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities, and we have to take that into account, as well as his substance.
[1:00:15.900 --> 1:00:17.900]  He has both style and substance.
[1:00:17.900 --> 1:00:25.900]  In September was an incredibly lucrative month for the Obama campaign, raking in more than 150 million. Here's Jim Cunahannon.
[1:00:25.900 --> 1:00:38.900]  Some Republicans and even some campaign watchdog groups have taken some issue with the amount of money that he's been able to raise in these small donations, because it is not money that needs to be divulged.
[1:00:38.900 --> 1:00:45.900]  It's divulged in its total, but the identities of these donors don't have to be divulged to federal regulators.
[1:00:45.900 --> 1:00:48.900]  This is IRN, USA Radio News.

[1:01:49.900 --> 1:02:01.900]  John McCain plans two rallies today in Ohio, hoping to make up ground against Barack Obama, who has a slight lead there. McCain will speak in the Columbus suburb of Westerville and also in Toledo.
[1:02:01.900 --> 1:02:04.900]  Yesterday, it was McCain in Virginia.
[1:02:04.900 --> 1:02:17.900]  Stand up to defend our country from its enemies. Stand up. Stand up. Stand up and fight. America's worth fighting for. Nothing is inevitable here. We never give up.
[1:02:17.900 --> 1:02:24.900]  Two of Ohio's largest newspapers announced their endorsements today, one backing McCain and the other supporting Obama.
[1:02:24.900 --> 1:02:31.900]  The Taliban spokesperson has denied that militants killed civilians on a bus in Afghanistan. Here's Jason Stragioso.
[1:02:31.900 --> 1:02:43.900]  The Taliban claim that they killed 27 Afghan soldiers traveling through the country's south, but the Afghan Ministry of Defense said there were no soldiers on board and that everyone killed had been a civilian.

[1:03:19.900 --> 1:03:25.900]  The main websites used to carry Al Qaeda messages are still inoperable, more than a month after they went down.
[1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:32.900]  That was just ahead of the anniversary of the September 11 attacks when the terror group was set to release a new video message.
[1:03:32.900 --> 1:03:41.900]  The group's communication wing denies the sites have come under cyber attack. It blames the problems on technical difficulties. Here's Paul Shim.
[1:03:41.900 --> 1:03:52.900]  The possibility is that the recent operations in Pakistan may have disrupted some of Al Qaeda's media capability and as a result they have difficulty hosting the website or producing the videos.
[1:03:52.900 --> 1:04:03.900]  A trip to the World Series is on the line with the Boston Red Sox meet the Tampa Bay Rays in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series tonight.
[1:04:03.900 --> 1:04:08.900]  Rays manager Joe Madden says he doesn't expect his team to fill the pressure in Game 7 after being on the verge of winning the series in Game 5.
[1:04:08.900 --> 1:04:18.900]  It's all about how we react at the moment and it's the seventh game and it's a great learning experience for us to win that game would be something special for us also.
[1:04:18.900 --> 1:04:22.900]  So it's not about looking in the past, it's about looking into the future right now.
[1:04:22.900 --> 1:04:29.900]  President Bush says he'll host a summit of world leaders to come up with ways to prevent a global financial crisis from happening again.
[1:04:29.900 --> 1:04:36.900]  Given that the world has never been more interconnected, it is essential that we work together because we're in this crisis together.
[1:04:36.900 --> 1:04:43.900]  Bush says it'll take more time for the government interventions in the economy to have their full impact but says it'll bounce back.
[1:04:43.900 --> 1:04:48.900]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.
[1:05:13.900 --> 1:05:18.900]  There are definitely some dos and don'ts with this rollover process and that's where Midas Resources comes in.

[1:05:29.900 --> 1:05:34.900]  It's not a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio, it's a question of when.

[1:06:10.900 --> 1:06:26.900]  5-525, now live from Austin, Texas. Here's Alex Jones.
[1:06:26.900 --> 1:06:31.900]  Let me simplify it for everybody out there.
[1:06:31.900 --> 1:06:41.900]  You have a private group of banking families for over 200 years in England that got control of the United States in 1913, got control in Europe after they funded Hitler,
[1:06:41.900 --> 1:06:46.900]  and then basically double crossed, triple crossed him and let him destroy Europe.
[1:06:46.900 --> 1:06:49.900]  This is all mainline history. The public doesn't know.
[1:06:49.900 --> 1:06:52.900]  They want global domination. They want control.
[1:06:52.900 --> 1:06:59.900]  They've gone into hundreds of third world countries, paid off dictators and corrupt governments to not pay back their IMF and World Bank debts,
[1:06:59.900 --> 1:07:01.900]  a company that was created out of nothing.
[1:07:01.900 --> 1:07:05.900]  They then go in and take control of those nations and set up police states there.
[1:07:05.900 --> 1:07:08.900]  They are now doing that here in the United States.
[1:07:08.900 --> 1:07:18.900]  In 2002, with horror, in March of 2002, the BBC got over 2,000 pages of IMF and World Bank documents, shows a sticklet's quit and went public about it,
[1:07:18.900 --> 1:07:27.900]  where they plan to implode the West money supply by radically inflating derivatives and currencies and devaluing them.
[1:07:27.900 --> 1:07:29.900]  They're only telling you what they planned.
[1:07:29.900 --> 1:07:37.900]  And I told you day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, they would devalue the dollar and create a trilateral system.
[1:07:37.900 --> 1:07:43.900]  Three global regional currencies. That's Bloomberg headline today.
[1:07:43.900 --> 1:07:46.900]  They engineer the crisis. They then offer the solution.
[1:07:46.900 --> 1:07:50.900]  And when they inflate the currency, the central banks control it.
[1:07:50.900 --> 1:07:54.900]  They get to buy up real assets, but you get to pay taxes back on all of that.
[1:07:54.900 --> 1:07:58.900]  They're talking about the massive taxes we're going to be paying.
[1:07:58.900 --> 1:08:03.900]  Now, they want to socialize the United States, but not the classic socialism you think of,
[1:08:03.900 --> 1:08:07.900]  of the people being paid by the government and called helping everyone, which is a load of bull.
[1:08:07.900 --> 1:08:09.900]  Why do the big private banks fund all this?
[1:08:09.900 --> 1:08:11.900]  They want to get us under their control.
[1:08:11.900 --> 1:08:17.900]  They want to destroy the real economy to where we'll still have jobs at corporations and companies, but they'll have government contracts.
[1:08:17.900 --> 1:08:23.900]  And then you will basically be totally dependent on government, which itself is controlled by these private central banks,
[1:08:23.900 --> 1:08:30.900]  by these new international banking agreements and this quote, new world order banking structure being set up according to Nicholas Sarkozy,
[1:08:30.900 --> 1:08:34.900]  Merkel of Germany, Brown of England, Bush of the United States.
[1:08:34.900 --> 1:08:38.900]  And people saying, well, don't worry. The man on the white horse is coming to save us.
[1:08:38.900 --> 1:08:45.900]  For those that don't know, that's an illusion to alluding to the Paulian Bonaparte or a white horse, you know, the tyrant.
[1:08:45.900 --> 1:08:47.900]  Oh, he will fix it. He will change things.
[1:08:47.900 --> 1:08:49.900]  He's gotten three times the money from Wall Street.
[1:08:49.900 --> 1:08:55.900]  The one's doing this that John McCain has. And I'm not saying vote for John McCain folks.
[1:08:55.900 --> 1:09:04.900]  I remember when all of these well-meaning Republicans after eight horrible years of Bill Clinton and my, my radio show on AM and FM,
[1:09:04.900 --> 1:09:09.900]  it's much bigger on the web now and overall bigger, but I was on over 80 stations in 2001.
[1:09:09.900 --> 1:09:13.900]  I talked about this Friday and they loved me.
[1:09:13.900 --> 1:09:17.900]  You know, I was bashing Bill Clinton in the new world order and the police state and everything.
[1:09:17.900 --> 1:09:23.900]  And the radio station owners, they thought that, oh, this is a good right winger like us.
[1:09:23.900 --> 1:09:34.900]  He's bashing Bill Clinton. In the last six months of Bill Clinton's office, I said, look, it doesn't matter who wins Al Gore or George W. Bush.
[1:09:34.900 --> 1:09:38.900]  They're both new world order looking at what they've said and done and who finances them.
[1:09:38.900 --> 1:09:42.900]  And all of a sudden stations were like, well, we don't know if we're going to carry your show anymore.
[1:09:42.900 --> 1:09:44.900]  You're, you're saying that it's both parties controlled.
[1:09:44.900 --> 1:09:48.900]  You're not saying it's Republicans, good Democrats, bad. And I said, look, I'm an American.
[1:09:48.900 --> 1:09:50.900]  I just tell it like it is.
[1:09:50.900 --> 1:09:52.900]  Bill Clinton's evil, but he's a puppet.
[1:09:52.900 --> 1:09:54.900]  No, George Bush is evil.
[1:09:54.900 --> 1:09:56.900]  So the liberals think Bill Clinton's going to save them.
[1:09:56.900 --> 1:10:03.900]  And then Bill Clinton, eight horrible years of tyranny and corruption and Chinese generals in the White House and cocaine dealers being pardoned
[1:10:03.900 --> 1:10:10.900]  and unbelievable corruption, all sorts of murders, a political dissidents and people.
[1:10:10.900 --> 1:10:15.900]  And then I was some, you know, right wing hero to the right wing and the left hated me.
[1:10:15.900 --> 1:10:21.900]  Then George Bush comes in intensifies the new world order. Suddenly the left loves me and I'm going, listen to me.
[1:10:21.900 --> 1:10:24.900]  I'm not a leftist. I'm not a right winger. I'm a constitutionalist.
[1:10:24.900 --> 1:10:28.900]  I report the facts. I report history. I know what I'm talking about.
[1:10:28.900 --> 1:10:43.900]  I know of what I said that now the liberals, oh, and even mainline Americans, you know, who a lot of Republicans.
[1:10:43.900 --> 1:10:49.900]  Oh, it's almost like the Ronald Reagan phenomenon of a lot of Republicans are voting for Barack Obama because they're sick of George Bush.
[1:10:49.900 --> 1:10:51.900]  They're sick of all he's done.
[1:10:51.900 --> 1:10:59.900]  And so now I'm telling you Barack Obama's bad. It'll be just as bad of McCain gets in only for the fact that now people will be suckered again.
[1:10:59.900 --> 1:11:02.900]  And it'll take them four or five, six years to figure out Barack Obama's new world order.
[1:11:02.900 --> 1:11:07.900]  Remember how he said he was against illegal wiretapping of the American people and then he voted for it.
[1:11:07.900 --> 1:11:09.900]  And he said he was against the war. Then he voted for it.
[1:11:09.900 --> 1:11:13.900]  And all the things he said he was against an after and get now he says he's for it.
[1:11:13.900 --> 1:11:20.900]  He even said the speech in Canada. Don't worry. That's just for people that are, you know, against that because I want to get elected.
[1:11:20.900 --> 1:11:28.900]  So, so this is the type of deception and garbage that we are seeing here.
[1:11:28.900 --> 1:11:31.900]  And I just want you to understand they own both parties.
[1:11:31.900 --> 1:11:38.900]  They've already transferred the power out of Congress to the executive, the executive then signed it over to international private bodies.
[1:11:38.900 --> 1:11:43.900]  Private bureaucrats, private financial bodies now run this country.
[1:11:43.900 --> 1:11:44.900]  And what is the solution?
[1:11:44.900 --> 1:11:46.900]  It's waking up to that.
[1:11:46.900 --> 1:11:51.900]  It's admitting that. I mean, they're all over the news saying a new world order run by the banks.
[1:11:51.900 --> 1:11:55.900]  They're all over mainstream news, but saying it's good because now they're doing it.
[1:11:55.900 --> 1:11:57.900]  They have to, they've always denied it.
[1:11:57.900 --> 1:11:59.900]  Well, what was embryonic now that it's actually coming to fruition.
[1:11:59.900 --> 1:12:05.900]  They're saying, oh, yeah, there's going to be three global currencies in North American Union with the European Union, the Asian Union.
[1:12:05.900 --> 1:12:07.900]  And yeah, it's going to happen.
[1:12:07.900 --> 1:12:09.900]  But, you know, this is for your own good.
[1:12:09.900 --> 1:12:10.900]  And there was a banking crisis.
[1:12:10.900 --> 1:12:15.900]  So the banks have to do this and gee, they're idiots, but, you know, we've got to give them unlimited currency and money.
[1:12:15.900 --> 1:12:17.900]  And then they're going to bail everybody out.
[1:12:17.900 --> 1:12:19.900]  Oh, they're not going to bail out the bad loans now.
[1:12:19.900 --> 1:12:22.900]  Oh, they're not going to help Main Street now with the money.
[1:12:22.900 --> 1:12:30.900]  And it would be bad enough to issue trillions of dollars and trillions of euros to get the economy going again, because it would help for a while.
[1:12:30.900 --> 1:12:33.900]  But then it would devalue the currency and bring us into hyperinflation.
[1:12:33.900 --> 1:12:36.900]  That's bad enough, but that's much better.
[1:12:36.900 --> 1:12:39.900]  I'd rather every American get $100,000 is basically the equivalent.
[1:12:39.900 --> 1:12:43.900]  You know, every American of voting age, every working American, 18 older.
[1:12:43.900 --> 1:12:49.900]  I'd rather everybody get a hundred plus thousand dollars, a little over a hundred thousand and then go out and just spend it in the economy.
[1:12:49.900 --> 1:12:53.900]  And then yeah, we'd hyperinflate the currency, but that might build up some industry or the economy.
[1:12:53.900 --> 1:12:55.900]  People didn't just buy iPods and cars with it.
[1:12:55.900 --> 1:13:02.900]  And, you know, then we could pull this country out maybe because they have created a debt bubble that's unescapable.
[1:13:02.900 --> 1:13:04.900]  But instead they're going to let the debt bubble continue.
[1:13:04.900 --> 1:13:06.900]  They're not going to bail any of the people out.
[1:13:06.900 --> 1:13:07.900]  They're giving all the money to the banks.
[1:13:07.900 --> 1:13:12.900]  So when the economy falls apart, they're the last one standing to buy it all up and setting up a world government in front of it.
[1:13:12.900 --> 1:13:21.900]  Government in front of everyone in hundreds of financial publications saying it's world government run by the very bankers that engineered all of this.
[1:13:21.900 --> 1:13:23.900]  And I got yuppies on the street laughing at me.
[1:13:23.900 --> 1:13:25.900]  You know, most people agree.
[1:13:25.900 --> 1:13:30.900]  Most people, you know, this shows become even more and more popular, very mainline now because everything I talked about came true.
[1:13:30.900 --> 1:13:35.900]  But there's still 20, 30% of the public, liberals and conservatives, who just don't buy anything I say.
[1:13:35.900 --> 1:13:36.900]  They don't think it's real.
[1:13:36.900 --> 1:13:40.900]  They think I'm making up Bloomberg admitting a trilateral world government.
[1:13:40.900 --> 1:13:43.900]  They think I'm making up the Gordon Brown, the prime minister of England called for a new world order.
[1:13:43.900 --> 1:13:52.900]  They think I'm making it up the judicial watch suit and got the fact that we're secretly arting the North American Union since March of 2005, March 24, 2005.
[1:13:52.900 --> 1:13:54.900]  I'm not making any of this up.
[1:13:54.900 --> 1:13:57.900]  And let me tell everybody out there that thinks they're part of the system.
[1:13:57.900 --> 1:14:01.900]  There's so many people that, you know, make $50, $100,000 a year that they're part of the system.
[1:14:01.900 --> 1:14:03.900]  They just go along with whatever the corporate system says.
[1:14:03.900 --> 1:14:05.900]  They think the system's good.
[1:14:05.900 --> 1:14:07.900]  They think it inherently wants to help them.
[1:14:07.900 --> 1:14:08.900]  It does not.
[1:14:08.900 --> 1:14:13.900]  It's going to have a bankrupt nanny state where the government keeps us all at basically welfare level.
[1:14:13.900 --> 1:14:21.900]  Most people, the middle class that's left is going to be taxed at above 70%.
[1:14:21.900 --> 1:14:25.900]  And that's basically the world we're going to have a giant third world country.
[1:14:25.900 --> 1:14:27.900]  I mean, they just had a trillion dollar defense budget.
[1:14:27.900 --> 1:14:31.900]  The last biggest one was only $60 billion, $600 billion.
[1:14:31.900 --> 1:14:34.900]  They just tripled the size of the Department of Education.
[1:14:34.900 --> 1:14:38.900]  The government has almost tripled in size total under George Bush.
[1:14:38.900 --> 1:14:39.900]  How is that conservative?
[1:14:39.900 --> 1:14:40.900]  It isn't.
[1:14:40.900 --> 1:14:44.900]  And you're not going to have something liberal under Barack Obama.
[1:14:44.900 --> 1:14:48.900]  The establishment wants Barack Obama because he can sell the new world agenda,
[1:14:48.900 --> 1:14:51.900]  new world order agenda to all the anti-Bush people.
[1:14:51.900 --> 1:14:55.900]  Just like George Bush could sell the new world order agenda to all the anti-Bill Clinton people.
[1:14:55.900 --> 1:14:58.900]  No matter what president it is, everybody ends up basically hating them.
[1:14:58.900 --> 1:15:02.900]  They end up leaving office unpopular because they've done unpopular things that people don't want.
[1:15:02.900 --> 1:15:04.900]  And they give us a new president.
[1:15:04.900 --> 1:15:06.900]  It takes us a few years to figure that out.
[1:15:06.900 --> 1:15:09.900]  And by then they give us another fake president.
[1:15:09.900 --> 1:15:11.900]  Stop looking for solutions in Washington.
[1:15:11.900 --> 1:15:13.900]  You know, here's the good news.
[1:15:13.900 --> 1:15:14.900]  I've interviewed a bunch of congressmen.
[1:15:14.900 --> 1:15:19.900]  I've seen a lot of other news stories where they would get 5,000 calls to one, 1,000 calls to one.
[1:15:19.900 --> 1:15:23.900]  The polls showing 95 plus percent against the bailout, the banker takeover bill,
[1:15:23.900 --> 1:15:25.900]  the banker dictatorship bill.
[1:15:25.900 --> 1:15:31.900]  But see, therein is the evidence 95% or more are against the banker takeover bill.
[1:15:31.900 --> 1:15:33.900]  The people aren't as stupid as some say.
[1:15:33.900 --> 1:15:37.900]  But the establishment says, and both parties say, we don't care, we're going to do it.
[1:15:37.900 --> 1:15:42.900]  And the stock market plunges anyways because that's what they want so they can buy it all up cheap.
[1:15:42.900 --> 1:15:44.900]  Your phone calls straight ahead.
[1:15:44.900 --> 1:15:46.900]  A ton of incredible police state news as well.
[1:15:46.900 --> 1:16:14.900]  We'll stay with us.
[1:16:16.900 --> 1:16:23.900]  We'll see you next time.
[1:16:47.900 --> 1:16:51.900]  Hi, John Hufner from Midas Resources.
[1:16:51.900 --> 1:16:54.900]  Are you tired of watching your hard earned assets dwindle away?
[1:16:54.900 --> 1:16:59.900]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of 20 billion a week,
[1:16:59.900 --> 1:17:02.900]  are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard earned money?
[1:17:02.900 --> 1:17:06.900]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[1:17:06.900 --> 1:17:10.900]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.

[1:17:22.900 --> 1:17:25.900]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[1:17:25.900 --> 1:17:32.900]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[1:17:32.900 --> 1:17:38.900]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.

[1:20:01.900 --> 1:20:07.900]  On a happier note, I talked to Willie Nelson today, talked to Jesse Ventura a couple days ago.
[1:20:07.900 --> 1:20:12.900]  They're going to be popping back in on the show next week.
[1:20:12.900 --> 1:20:17.900]  I'll just cover this now. I'll never get to it.
[1:20:17.900 --> 1:20:23.900]  Then I'll go to your calls about the financial collapse that's happening by design to bring in the world government.
[1:20:23.900 --> 1:20:28.900]  I had Willie Nelson on my radio show about two months ago.
[1:20:28.900 --> 1:20:31.900]  He's been a listener for a long time.
[1:20:31.900 --> 1:20:37.900]  I found out he was a listener by running into him at a premiere of Endgame about 14 months ago.
[1:20:37.900 --> 1:20:39.900]  I was like, oh, Willie Nelson, wow.
[1:20:39.900 --> 1:20:42.900]  I found out he'd been listening for more than a decade.
[1:20:42.900 --> 1:20:45.900]  Of course, he lives here in Austin, no surprise.
[1:20:45.900 --> 1:20:50.900]  He went public for 9-11 Truth on my radio show.
[1:20:50.900 --> 1:20:53.900]  In fact, right here.
[1:20:53.900 --> 1:20:56.900]  He had his third appearance with us on the radio.
[1:20:56.900 --> 1:21:00.900]  He'll be on for an hour, by the way, Wednesday, right at the start of the show.
[1:21:00.900 --> 1:21:03.900]  We have another big guest Tuesday coming up right at the start of the show,
[1:21:03.900 --> 1:21:08.900]  but I'm going to leave that as a surprise.
[1:21:08.900 --> 1:21:11.900]  But a new guest, never before been on with this pretty big.
[1:21:11.900 --> 1:21:16.900]  We'll just leave it at that Tuesday on the weekday show, start of the show.
[1:21:16.900 --> 1:21:19.900]  So it makes a lot of these big guests want to come on right at the start.
[1:21:19.900 --> 1:21:22.900]  But we have Ron Paul, by the way, talking about yes, this is world government.
[1:21:22.900 --> 1:21:23.900]  Yes, this is by design.
[1:21:23.900 --> 1:21:27.900]  Yes, they want to create a financial collapse of the public and begs for martial law
[1:21:27.900 --> 1:21:30.900]  and there's rioting in the streets.
[1:21:30.900 --> 1:21:33.900]  That's up on infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[1:21:33.900 --> 1:21:36.900]  But talk to Willie Nelson.
[1:21:36.900 --> 1:21:40.900]  I'm going to be in an interview out at his World Headquarters Sunday afternoon.
[1:21:40.900 --> 1:21:45.900]  And then after that, we are going to be having an event at the last backyard at the current location.
[1:21:45.900 --> 1:21:51.900]  Almost 30 years it's been there out off 71 out in the Hill Country.
[1:21:51.900 --> 1:21:55.900]  He was out in the Hill Country down surrounded by a big mall, but it's really nice.
[1:21:55.900 --> 1:22:00.900]  And Willie had the idea on air because a caller called him and said,
[1:22:00.900 --> 1:22:05.900]  you'll have a 9-11 truth slash anti-war concert.
[1:22:05.900 --> 1:22:06.900]  And Willie said, Alex, look into it.
[1:22:06.900 --> 1:22:07.900]  I want to do that.
[1:22:07.900 --> 1:22:10.900]  And then I was about to rent some big venue here in Austin.
[1:22:10.900 --> 1:22:15.900]  He said, look, just just just come to my event and invite Jesse Ventura down to that.
[1:22:15.900 --> 1:22:23.900]  And so you can it's sold out, but you can still get tickers, tickers.
[1:22:23.900 --> 1:22:28.900]  You can still get tickets to the event from scalpers and people.
[1:22:28.900 --> 1:22:29.900]  And it's going to be historical.
[1:22:29.900 --> 1:22:31.900]  There's going to be a lot of surprise guests there.
[1:22:31.900 --> 1:22:33.900]  I'll tell you one of them and take the surprise out of it.
[1:22:33.900 --> 1:22:38.900]  Jimmy Vaughn is going to be up there playing guitar with Willie Nelson on stage.
[1:22:38.900 --> 1:22:42.900]  My good friend, Jimmy Vaughn, let's see how to Jimmy and his wife and kids.
[1:22:42.900 --> 1:22:47.900]  And so that is coming up Sunday.
[1:22:47.900 --> 1:22:49.900]  And that's the good news.
[1:22:49.900 --> 1:22:54.900]  I mean, we have all these prominent people, former German defense ministers and Italian presidents and best actors this year.
[1:22:54.900 --> 1:22:59.900]  And director Rick Linkletter and now Bruce Willis knows about the New World Order and isn't a neocon anymore.
[1:22:59.900 --> 1:23:01.900]  We woke him up, told folks about that, and they didn't believe it.
[1:23:01.900 --> 1:23:02.900]  And then he told them that he fair.
[1:23:02.900 --> 1:23:03.900]  It was true.
[1:23:03.900 --> 1:23:05.900]  Just just hundreds of prominent people.
[1:23:05.900 --> 1:23:10.900]  And that's an indicator of a society saying no to the New World Order.
[1:23:10.900 --> 1:23:18.900]  And that is the good news here is that 95% in some polls higher.
[1:23:18.900 --> 1:23:23.900]  But the average poll was 95% three weeks ago with the banker takeover bill to bail out.
[1:23:23.900 --> 1:23:27.900]  90 plus percent were saying no to it in polls.
[1:23:27.900 --> 1:23:29.900]  A thousand to one phone calls.
[1:23:29.900 --> 1:23:32.900]  Barbara Boxer said it was 9,000 calls to one.
[1:23:32.900 --> 1:23:34.900]  And they really marked that down.
[1:23:34.900 --> 1:23:39.900]  Senator Boxer said 9,000 to one, 9,000 to one.
[1:23:39.900 --> 1:23:42.900]  But, but let's go with what other Congress spent on my show.
[1:23:42.900 --> 1:23:47.900]  Who was the one from Fort Worth we had on Burgess Burgess Burgess Burgess.
[1:23:47.900 --> 1:23:49.900]  Burgess said about a thousand to one.
[1:23:49.900 --> 1:23:51.900]  They had 2,500 phone calls.
[1:23:51.900 --> 1:23:55.900]  He said like a couple of more or the bankers taken over.
[1:23:55.900 --> 1:23:59.900]  And so we have a thousand to one phone calls conservatively.
[1:23:59.900 --> 1:24:02.900]  We have 95% plus saying no.
[1:24:02.900 --> 1:24:03.900]  And it happened.
[1:24:03.900 --> 1:24:06.900]  So I consider and say the American people are dumb or they're idiots or they don't know.
[1:24:06.900 --> 1:24:07.900]  No, they do know what's going on.
[1:24:07.900 --> 1:24:09.900]  These are the banks that did this.
[1:24:09.900 --> 1:24:14.900]  But, but, but some still believe, well, I'm against it, but they're idiots and we got to bail them out.
[1:24:14.900 --> 1:24:20.900]  No, ladies and gentlemen, in their own documents, this is by design.
[1:24:20.900 --> 1:24:23.900]  And I know I continue to harp on that.
[1:24:23.900 --> 1:24:25.900]  It's because we don't have a future.
[1:24:25.900 --> 1:24:27.900]  If we don't say no, this is criminal.
[1:24:27.900 --> 1:24:35.900]  I don't have words to describe how incredible it is to have Henry Paulson and another Goldman Sachs guy, his, his adjunct.
[1:24:35.900 --> 1:24:40.900]  Kashkari handing out the trillions of dollars to themselves in secret meetings.
[1:24:40.900 --> 1:24:43.900]  And again, even CNBC, I don't watch a lot of TV, but I was on the treadmill.
[1:24:43.900 --> 1:24:48.900]  I think Wednesday morning, and they had like an hour of yelling and screaming about, they couldn't believe it was secret.
[1:24:48.900 --> 1:24:50.900]  And God knows what really happened.
[1:24:50.900 --> 1:24:51.900]  And this is illegal.
[1:24:51.900 --> 1:24:53.900]  Ron Paul's called for Treasury Secretary to be arrested.
[1:24:53.900 --> 1:24:57.900]  Paulson, Fed Chairman of the private Federal Reserve, Bernanke to be arrested.
[1:24:57.900 --> 1:24:59.900]  He listed the crimes they committed a few weeks ago on the show.
[1:24:59.900 --> 1:25:01.900]  It was back on Friday.
[1:25:01.900 --> 1:25:08.900]  But I mean, we're here telling you what's happening and to know they're doing it, to know they're setting up the new world order run by the banks.
[1:25:08.900 --> 1:25:12.900]  The banks are bankrupting the world by design.
[1:25:12.900 --> 1:25:23.900]  And then they have the power because they control the central governments, the U.S., England, Europe, and the most powerful militaries to make the world then accept their takeover plan and a re-monitization of the debt through a global currency.
[1:25:23.900 --> 1:25:27.900]  They control global currency, global government.
[1:25:27.900 --> 1:25:28.900]  It's happening.
[1:25:28.900 --> 1:25:29.900]  I want to go to Dr. Bill Deagle.
[1:25:29.900 --> 1:25:32.900]  He's a radio talk show host on Genesis Communications.
[1:25:32.900 --> 1:25:39.900]  The net, the network through MS that carries this show and puts it out on a separate issue of vaccines.
[1:25:39.900 --> 1:25:40.900]  He's a medical doctor.
[1:25:40.900 --> 1:25:42.900]  He wanted to comment on this.
[1:25:42.900 --> 1:25:47.900]  The earlier call, they were going to come back and go to Doug, Eric, Nick, Mark, John, Stephen, Bill, and others.
[1:25:47.900 --> 1:25:49.900]  I promise nothing but calls when we get back.
[1:25:49.900 --> 1:25:52.900]  But Dr. Deagle, real fast, tell folks what's going on.
[1:25:52.900 --> 1:25:54.900]  You're doing a great job, Alex.
[1:25:54.900 --> 1:25:56.900]  Just always bumping it up a few.
[1:25:56.900 --> 1:25:58.900]  Some breaking news, and this is really important.
[1:25:58.900 --> 1:26:02.900]  The last week, I got a whistleblower again.
[1:26:02.900 --> 1:26:03.900]  You're right.
[1:26:03.900 --> 1:26:05.900]  People are waking up, including the police and the sheriffs.
[1:26:05.900 --> 1:26:08.900]  Former county sheriff from Harstinville, Arkansas.
[1:26:08.900 --> 1:26:11.900]  How can they not wake up when 95% know it's a scam?
[1:26:11.900 --> 1:26:12.900]  Exactly.
[1:26:12.900 --> 1:26:19.900]  Well, he called in and basically the plan is this new DNA vaccine against H5N1.
[1:26:19.900 --> 1:26:22.900]  All the county sheriffs in the country are going to be forced vaccinated and their families.
[1:26:22.900 --> 1:26:29.900]  Well, they tried forced vaccination in 2003, as you know, for the firefighters, police, nurses, medical workers.
[1:26:29.900 --> 1:26:36.900]  And the LA Times reported that 4,000 out of 14 million who were ordered to do it said no.
[1:26:36.900 --> 1:26:40.900]  Yeah, and those that did, if they had any sign of unstable plaque.
[1:26:40.900 --> 1:26:41.900]  A bunch of people died.
[1:26:41.900 --> 1:26:42.900]  Yeah.
[1:26:42.900 --> 1:26:44.900]  Including an NBC News reporter who took it.
[1:26:44.900 --> 1:26:52.900]  Now, this vaccine, they'll tell you that the vaccine that they've got for the, is the same vaccine that Senefi Pasteur in France had.
[1:26:52.900 --> 1:26:56.900]  Two scientists were Mossad style executed a little over a month ago.
[1:26:56.900 --> 1:27:02.900]  And their 500 million doses were delivered mid-September to American military bases in Homeland Security.
[1:27:02.900 --> 1:27:04.900]  Well, explain what an H5N1 is.
[1:27:04.900 --> 1:27:08.900]  Well, H5N1 is the virus that's been tracked in Asia.
[1:27:08.900 --> 1:27:12.900]  And there's at least a half a dozen what's called hypatogenic strains.
[1:27:12.900 --> 1:27:13.900]  That's the bird flu.
[1:27:13.900 --> 1:27:14.900]  Yeah.
[1:27:14.900 --> 1:27:16.900]  And what they've done is they made a bird flu vaccine only.
[1:27:16.900 --> 1:27:18.900]  This is a DNA vaccine, which means it carries DNA.
[1:27:18.900 --> 1:27:20.900]  They can recombine if you have the flu.
[1:27:20.900 --> 1:27:26.900]  Just like the HPV shot, the live cancer virus shot is killing so many people.
[1:27:26.900 --> 1:27:28.900]  And that's admitted, but they don't tell you that on the news.
[1:27:28.900 --> 1:27:30.900]  So the women could give it to their girls.
[1:27:30.900 --> 1:27:31.900]  Right.
[1:27:31.900 --> 1:27:39.900]  And that, the regular flu shot also has genes from H5N1 that's in an H3N2 as part of the
[1:27:39.900 --> 1:27:40.900]  trivalent vaccine.
[1:27:40.900 --> 1:27:41.900]  They're giving out this fall.
[1:27:41.900 --> 1:27:42.900]  They're going to start in the next few weeks.
[1:27:42.900 --> 1:27:43.900]  By the way, you're not just a medical doctor.
[1:27:43.900 --> 1:27:45.900]  You're a research scientist doctor.
[1:27:45.900 --> 1:27:46.900]  Right.
[1:27:46.900 --> 1:27:50.900]  And the thing is that I worked with Homeland Security in Operation Top Off in Dark Winter.
[1:27:50.900 --> 1:27:51.900]  That was when you were in Denver.
[1:27:51.900 --> 1:27:52.900]  Yeah.
[1:27:52.900 --> 1:27:53.900]  And I was in Denver.
[1:27:53.900 --> 1:27:54.900]  And what's going on here?
[1:27:54.900 --> 1:27:57.900]  They're literally turning people into test tubes that could create the pandemic.
[1:27:57.900 --> 1:28:01.900]  I had the head of Rick Perry's office.
[1:28:01.900 --> 1:28:02.900]  Forget the exact name.
[1:28:02.900 --> 1:28:06.900]  He showed up at in-game last year, one of the same screenings that we saw Willie Nelson
[1:28:06.900 --> 1:28:07.900]  at.
[1:28:07.900 --> 1:28:13.900]  And he said, look, I have to admit, 15 years ago when I was a medic at Fort Sam Houston
[1:28:13.900 --> 1:28:17.900]  Medical Center in San Antonio, these troops came in, they were told to give them shots,
[1:28:17.900 --> 1:28:19.900]  and they all died in three days.
[1:28:19.900 --> 1:28:20.900]  Oh yeah.
[1:28:20.900 --> 1:28:26.900]  Listen, I was told that if I followed up on the anthrax vaccine at CCOM that I would be
[1:28:26.900 --> 1:28:27.900]  fired or worse than this.
[1:28:27.900 --> 1:28:28.900]  And I said, what's worse than this?
[1:28:28.900 --> 1:28:30.900]  I said, help a dead doc.
[1:28:30.900 --> 1:28:31.900]  And that's the fact.
[1:28:31.900 --> 1:28:34.900]  The other thing is the carbon tax is tied directly to the bailout.
[1:28:34.900 --> 1:28:36.900]  No, no, it's actually in our bailout.
[1:28:36.900 --> 1:28:40.900]  They're going to put a carbon tax, and they're getting ready with Barack Obama saying that,
[1:28:40.900 --> 1:28:44.900]  quote, he is going to tax carbon dioxide, which is a life-giving guess.
[1:28:44.900 --> 1:28:45.900]  Absolutely.
[1:28:45.900 --> 1:28:47.900]  So there, Dr. Deagle, I'm going to let you finish up after this quick break.
[1:28:47.900 --> 1:28:48.900]  Stay with us.
[1:28:48.900 --> 1:28:49.900]  Question.
[1:28:49.900 --> 1:28:53.900]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
