[00:45.960 --> 00:55.180]  are live it is Friday the 6th day of April 2012 as we steam towards Easter
[00:55.180 --> 01:00.280]  and the Easter weekend thank you for joining us again amazing news and
[01:00.280 --> 01:04.040]  information we're going to be covering today we also have a security expert
[01:04.040 --> 01:08.120]  joining us who was on the roster a few weeks ago to speak before Congress
[01:08.120 --> 01:13.280]  exposing the fraud of the naked body scanners and the TSA ordered Congress to
[01:13.280 --> 01:16.400]  knock him off the list and of course they did as they were told by the
[01:16.400 --> 01:20.400]  bureaucracy kind of like Congress was told by Obama last year and this year
[01:20.400 --> 01:28.160]  hey I launched wars under UN command I work for the UN publicly and the joint
[01:28.160 --> 01:32.800]  chiefs of staff chairman said the same thing to him in testimony and so did the
[01:32.800 --> 01:39.240]  Secretary of Defense and now we have Obama a few days ago of course we've been
[01:39.240 --> 01:42.800]  talking about this quite a bit but it's such a big deal people are finally
[01:42.800 --> 01:46.160]  starting to pay attention to this because normally it's just one more okay
[01:46.160 --> 01:51.560]  there he is saying now the Supreme Court he didn't have to listen to them
[01:51.560 --> 01:57.280]  they have to listen to Congress has to listen to Supreme Court a total attempt
[01:57.280 --> 02:02.640]  at a seizure of power well finally I saw all the headlines yesterday mainline
[02:02.640 --> 02:09.640]  stuff about Obama creeping towards dictatorship Obama becoming dictatorial
[02:09.640 --> 02:17.080]  Obama shocks courts and then they had the fifth circuit that was ruling on some
[02:17.080 --> 02:21.960]  federal cases yesterday and they happen to have the Attorney General Mr. Fast
[02:21.960 --> 02:32.320]  and furious before them and there they are and they say to a holder what is
[02:32.320 --> 02:35.720]  this this is outrageous this is dangerous and the Attorney General had to
[02:35.720 --> 02:39.240]  put a statement out saying well the court shouldn't overturn with the
[02:39.240 --> 02:44.920]  president does but sometimes yes you do maybe have that authority but still
[02:44.920 --> 02:50.120]  creep towards saying don't listen to the courts the only group that can ignore
[02:50.120 --> 02:55.480]  courts if you look at the 230 plus year fights in this country is the Congress
[02:55.480 --> 03:01.080]  and they can't completely ignore it because Congress has done some
[03:01.080 --> 03:04.160]  unconstitutional things before it's just if you look at the separation of powers
[03:04.160 --> 03:08.200]  we're all taught that they're co-equal that's been taught in the last hundred
[03:08.200 --> 03:11.760]  years or so we really get back to the original jurisprudence and the
[03:11.760 --> 03:17.400]  statements by the founders and the intent Congress is slightly dominant
[03:17.400 --> 03:21.960]  because it's the most diverse group the largest group and the founders believe
[03:21.960 --> 03:27.680]  that illustrated its own separation of powers within it the next group that has
[03:27.680 --> 03:33.280]  more power after them than the presidency is the judicial because it
[03:33.280 --> 03:41.200]  again is separated by a larger number of judges that can come and go obviously
[03:41.200 --> 03:45.400]  with their death and they end up getting nominated by the president and the
[03:45.400 --> 03:49.520]  Congress has to approve it again a separation of powers the big danger in
[03:49.520 --> 03:53.320]  history of a dictatorship generally comes from a president a prime minister
[03:53.320 --> 03:58.160]  who goes bad they'd seen that in England and with prime ministerships it was
[03:58.160 --> 04:01.320]  happening in the parliament and all those fracases that had happened in
[04:01.320 --> 04:06.960]  civil wars and so that's why that was set up so it goes Congress courts
[04:06.960 --> 04:12.040]  president the president only is a commander-in-chief when a declaration of
[04:12.040 --> 04:18.000]  war or a bill of war is delivered by his boss the Congress who funds the war
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.040]  and who directs who the enemy is and what the parameters of that prosecution
[04:24.040 --> 04:30.240]  warrant are it's a warrant of war it's a letter of mark to the president to
[04:30.240 --> 04:38.160]  execute and then when he is given that that bill he becomes commander-in-chief
[04:38.160 --> 04:42.040]  and I've had constitutional law scholars on then he does become within that
[04:42.040 --> 04:46.400]  parameter a quasi dictator that's why declaring a war is such a big deal
[04:46.400 --> 04:51.360]  that's why professors like Boyle on the show pointed out if Obama ever actually
[04:51.360 --> 04:56.600]  is given a real war declaration then the dictatorship basically becomes legal to
[04:56.600 --> 05:03.080]  a certain degree well there I back stay with us hi folks this is Alex Jones I'm

[06:08.600 --> 06:12.680]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[06:12.680 --> 06:16.080]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely

[08:42.800 --> 08:47.600]  expert Bruce Snyder who was set to testify before Congress and their bosses
[08:47.600 --> 08:53.560]  the unelected criminal bureaucracy this was in the news ordered Congress to take
[08:53.560 --> 08:58.040]  him off the list and I see this all the time where bureaucracies say take that
[08:58.040 --> 09:03.600]  person off the testimony list and the Congress bows to them and ask which
[09:03.600 --> 09:08.160]  boot they would like licked just like when Obama comes in and says I have the
[09:08.160 --> 09:13.280]  UN authority for war total treason I sit on the UN Security Council never

[09:58.560 --> 10:03.600]  money through the criminal Federal Reserve set up in 1913 to fund the

[10:29.040 --> 10:32.120]  he started investigating the birth certificate feds rated them one week

[10:36.080 --> 10:41.080]  way they roll as they publicly ship guns into Mexico cocaine back into the US and
[10:41.080 --> 10:44.600]  it comes out in all the federal court cases and nobody gets in trouble and the
[10:44.600 --> 10:48.280]  big mega banks that run America are all caught publicly dealing drugs and
[10:48.280 --> 10:52.400]  laundering hundreds of billions of dollars a year publicly and owning CIA
[10:52.400 --> 10:57.840]  torture aircraft shipping and drugs and owning the company shipping weapons and
[10:57.840 --> 11:02.760]  worldwide and arming US street gangs I mean it's just all in Bloomberg AP
[11:02.760 --> 11:09.040]  Reuters Goldman Sachs sex slave trafficking funds the Romney's
[11:09.040 --> 11:14.440]  invested just total bedlam total insanity and it's driving me crazy I'm
[11:14.440 --> 11:19.640]  this is how I really feel I am on the edge of just running around like a
[11:19.640 --> 11:25.240]  crazy person screaming at the top of my lungs last night this morning four hours
[11:25.240 --> 11:29.320]  reading the news coming in here and seeing the piles of stuff they printed
[11:29.320 --> 11:35.800]  for me to look at most of it I've seen a lot of it I haven't absolute bedlam I
[11:35.800 --> 11:41.120]  mean I wanted to refresh my memory on one article this morning I noticed that
[11:41.120 --> 11:46.520]  Aaron Dykes must have posted it like 3 a.m. or something he had a report out of
[11:46.520 --> 11:57.720]  indium of what just in the last year in one year there were 47,500 cases of
[11:57.720 --> 12:04.000]  non polio paralysis viral paralysis and it's got all the top Indian medical
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.400]  university saying it's the vaccine that that a lot of the kids you know get
[12:08.400 --> 12:15.360]  paralysis out you know hours after and then I've got a CBS news NBC going back
[12:15.360 --> 12:20.080]  every year everywhere the UN goes and gives them the liquid vaccine it's full
[12:20.080 --> 12:29.920]  of SV 40 cancer virus I should add massive numbers it Pakistan everywhere
[12:29.920 --> 12:36.720]  it's actually causing polio to come back it's weaponized and I look at this
[12:36.720 --> 12:40.400]  image and videos of Bill Gates going around that's what he does on his
[12:40.400 --> 12:45.560]  vacation with a crazy look in his eye he gets this I mean you can look at the
[12:45.560 --> 12:49.080]  photo in fact if you guys will go to info wars.com put it on screen for people
[12:49.080 --> 12:54.160]  watching on prison planet TV paralysis cases spike and wake of Bill Gates
[12:54.160 --> 13:00.360]  polio vaccination effort in India GAVI global alliance for vaccines
[13:00.360 --> 13:05.520]  immunizations blamed for recommending untested polio vaccines oh they were
[13:05.520 --> 13:10.000]  they were tested alright and if you look he gets this in all the photos in
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.560]  Africa India you name it he gets this really sick predatory look when he's
[13:14.560 --> 13:20.000]  doing it now now now this is a guy whose dad publicly ran Planned Parenthood
[13:20.000 --> 13:27.240]  deep Rockefeller Foundation operative since the 40s army intelligence you
[13:27.240 --> 13:33.080]  name it Microsoft and people have actually heard journalists have heard me
[13:33.080 --> 13:35.400]  talk about this they've done research it and found it's all hidden in plain
[13:35.400 --> 13:41.040]  view is a total NSA front just like Google it doesn't even exist as a private
[13:41.040 --> 13:44.640]  company it's got shareholders you know it funds you know the the the public's
[13:44.640 --> 13:50.000]  tied into it and invest in it Bill Gates is on record being a eugenicist on
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.920]  record wanting to reduce population on record funding Monsanto and their
[13:53.920 --> 14:00.840]  sterilant crops on record saying yeah kill grandma and you can hire 10 teachers
[14:00.840 --> 14:04.680]  and the teachers clap on record saying give everybody vaccines to reduce
[14:04.680 --> 14:10.400]  population that's a quote on record saying humans are bad and then meanwhile
[14:10.400 --> 14:15.840]  he funds hundreds of publications ABC News London Guardian go look it up to
[14:15.840 --> 14:21.080]  write articles daily about him daily saying he's this angel who wants to
[14:21.080 --> 14:26.880]  help the brown people I mean I'm living in the Twilight Zone and then I read
[14:26.880 --> 14:31.040]  Aaron's article this morning and I got mad because Aaron just went off what the
[14:31.040 --> 14:35.200]  Indian doctors are saying on the Indian universities and they say yes it's
[14:35.200 --> 14:40.000]  clearly in the areas they give them this this oral vaccine it is causing
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.440]  paralysis basically it's causing polio they just call it paralysis and I
[14:44.440 --> 14:49.120]  already have the past reports I have CBS News admitting oh it is giving them a
[14:49.120 --> 14:52.880]  rare form of polio and it's it's more deadly than normal polio and it's
[14:52.880 --> 14:58.040]  actually causing polio to spread now and then Aaron writes his article and just
[14:58.040 --> 15:02.000]  quotes the doctors he did a great job by the way I'm not knocking him but it's
[15:02.000 --> 15:11.880]  not one-tenth as hardcore as it really is in reality in fact I just had that
[15:11.880 --> 15:15.920]  article in my hand and now there's so many hundreds of articles here I can't
[15:15.920 --> 15:23.160]  even find it here it is and I look at this photo and it it it it causes
[15:23.160 --> 15:28.760]  intense pain in my gut and my heart and then it's like seven o'clock in my
[15:28.760 --> 15:33.080]  little children walk in and they're playing with a puppy and I look at how
[15:33.080 --> 15:41.240]  innocent they are I think of these kids in one year 47,000 plus paralyzed by
[15:41.240 --> 15:47.920]  this and it's going on everywhere and then I see articles like CBS News will
[15:47.920 --> 15:52.240]  say the Pakistani villagers run because because they give Pakistan billions of
[15:52.240 --> 15:56.920]  US dollars and UN dollars taxpayer money if they'll take the vaccines so they
[15:56.920 --> 16:02.360]  come with soldiers and forcibly give it to them and it describes how in Africa
[16:02.360 --> 16:09.240]  and Pakistan and Central Asia the people actually have uprisings over this they
[16:09.240 --> 16:15.200]  know by the way I'm not even counting the SV 40 he's squirting into their mouth
[16:15.200 --> 16:21.360]  because that's the original polio stocks in that stuff all has it SV 40 cancer
[16:21.360 --> 16:28.960]  virus and and you know it's so crazy our pediatrician he's now retired he was
[16:28.960 --> 16:34.520]  probably one of the biggest pediatricians here in Austin and I'm in
[16:34.520 --> 16:38.960]  there and he didn't have a vaccine free clinic it was but it was they wouldn't
[16:38.960 --> 16:43.320]  harass you for not taking shots and he owned the clinic had a bunch of
[16:43.320 --> 16:49.440]  pediatricians under him and I was in there one day and he's doing a checkup
[16:49.440 --> 16:55.080]  this is like eight years ago of my son and he looks over he goes you know I've
[16:55.080 --> 16:58.160]  listened to your show and he goes you're right you know I volunteer for
[16:58.160 --> 17:02.160]  clinics a few times a year and you know it's illegal to give that liquid
[17:02.160 --> 17:06.640]  vaccine here in the US because it has the SV 40 and I said yeah he's not
[17:06.640 --> 17:09.960]  supposed to be shipped overseas they say that's legal he goes obviously we know
[17:09.960 --> 17:12.880]  why but I don't want to be quoted don't say my name don't say my name if I tell
[17:12.880 --> 17:20.840]  you this and I said okay doctor he's a man he looks at me and he says we give
[17:20.840 --> 17:27.880]  that at the free city clinics to the black kids and you know it's it's a
[17:27.880 --> 17:33.160]  patient doctor confidentiality it goes both ways as a journalist somebody
[17:33.160 --> 17:37.560]  tells me you don't tell anybody who I am when I tell you this I have a
[17:37.560 --> 17:41.920]  responsibility a sacred oath as a journalist when I'm wearing that hat not
[17:41.920 --> 17:46.680]  to reveal that source but I'm like you got to go public he goes no way in fact
[17:46.680 --> 17:54.100]  now these retired I ought to I ought to call him up and try to get him on the
[17:54.100 --> 17:57.760]  show because he's a you know top of his class well I'd love people listening to
[17:57.760 --> 18:04.080]  probably figure out who it is I need to shut up the point is is that it's so sick
[18:04.080 --> 18:08.360]  it's so sick and I don't know what I'm supposed to do I'm gonna tell you again
[18:08.360 --> 18:12.640]  I don't feel worthy and by that I don't feel like I'm doing a good enough job I
[18:12.640 --> 18:17.880]  don't know how to expose these people I don't know how to stop it I don't know
[18:17.880 --> 18:21.880]  how to stop it I mean my grandmother almost died of polio which we know is
[18:21.880 --> 18:25.240]  actually something they souped up and released at military bases that was a
[18:25.240 --> 18:29.680]  weaponized polio they released that was all staged so they could put the cancer
[18:29.680 --> 18:32.560]  viruses in it the rest of it I've got all the documents I've had scientists
[18:32.560 --> 18:36.240]  doctors on played the clips of the inventors of it bragging that they
[18:36.240 --> 18:40.560]  knew hundreds of millions got cancer from it I've played the stinking clips I
[18:40.560 --> 18:46.720]  mean I'm angry about this my grandmother
[18:46.720 --> 18:51.000]  God lover has not been able to walk without crutches and and she got polio
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.680]  really bad almost died it ain't most her muscle
[18:57.480 --> 19:02.440]  and then I think about how the cancers are up on average over 2,000% pediatric
[19:02.440 --> 19:07.320]  over 10,000 finally it's in the news that guys print this for me it's
[19:07.320 --> 19:13.400]  everywhere autism now a major health crisis because now it's one in 50
[19:13.400 --> 19:21.280]  something was one in 25,000 plus soon if this number it's gonna be one in 10
[19:21.280 --> 19:27.920]  within two years then within five years they estimate one in three and let me
[19:27.920 --> 19:32.720]  tell you it's real this is the zombification we are under total
[19:32.720 --> 19:41.880]  biological chemical warfare attack okay and I can't handle a murdering and
[19:41.880 --> 19:46.120]  degenerating children and paralyzing these kids my grandmother's gone through
[19:46.120 --> 19:51.760]  50 something years 56 57 58 years of hell since she got polio and I think
[19:51.760 --> 19:56.640]  about I'm doing this to these kids Bill Gates I mean these people these people
[19:56.640 --> 20:01.920]  make Hitler look like a cutie cake we'll be right back you don't need me to tell

[24:09.840 --> 24:15.400]  it's quite a paradox because I basically am able to mentally image the
[24:15.400 --> 24:20.480]  torture that I go through it'd be like knowing down the street that some
[24:20.480 --> 24:26.440]  three-year-old child was stuck in a well panicking with their legs broken with
[24:26.440 --> 24:31.440]  fire ants biting them and people are walking by not caring and we see people
[24:31.440 --> 24:37.320]  in the zombie light trance state that they're in with literal lower brain
[24:37.320 --> 24:43.800]  waves near a sleepwalking level we see them cases all the time where somebody's
[24:43.800 --> 24:48.000]  run over somebody's stabbed somebody's raped and will sit there on the side of
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.320]  the road even a nice area with hundreds of people walking by them for hours not
[24:53.320 --> 24:58.480]  helping them that's how it is in India that's how it is in China that's been
[24:58.480 --> 25:02.680]  engineered by the cultural system the West was never liked that in modern
[25:02.680 --> 25:10.840]  times that is now happening and people don't get that when you don't care what's
[25:10.840 --> 25:13.960]  happening to others they don't care what happens to you when you don't care
[25:13.960 --> 25:18.280]  about corruption they don't care about corruption and it destroys productivity
[25:18.280 --> 25:26.840]  it destroys everything good in the society and when I for 17 years on air
[25:26.840 --> 25:31.760]  have been totally aware because it's even in mainstream news hidden in plain
[25:31.760 --> 25:39.560]  view just like they report that Goldman Sachs has a sex trafficking which many
[25:39.560 --> 25:44.400]  of them are kidnapped and and and pressed and enslaved women and and miners
[25:44.400 --> 25:52.880]  and Goldman Sachs publicly has a fund invested in that and it's not even an
[25:52.880 --> 25:59.080]  issue see how they've just got us right where they want us and now I see
[25:59.080 --> 26:03.840]  articles all the time about yeah the UN programs under fire yeah there's
[26:03.840 --> 26:08.360]  conspiracy theorists that think they're doing it on purpose in Pakistan so the
[26:08.360 --> 26:11.680]  Pakistani government saying you know they don't care if we hold back their
[26:11.680 --> 26:16.720]  three billion they're not gonna do this because the money is attached to it just
[26:16.720 --> 26:20.720]  like schools don't get their federal funds unless they vaccinate unless they
[26:20.720 --> 26:25.680]  begin the lobotomization process see the average person just gets stunted
[26:25.680 --> 26:32.440]  dumbed down has that fire of creativity that human spark dimmed but some people
[26:32.440 --> 26:35.680]  especially boys because their blood-brain barrier is not as strong
[26:35.680 --> 26:39.960]  medical doctors have broken this down girl babies girl children women and on
[26:39.960 --> 26:44.120]  average live longer they're tougher in every major study they can take gun shot
[26:44.120 --> 26:48.320]  wounds better freeze everything better because they're designed to create the
[26:48.320 --> 26:52.880]  next wave of humans women have to be tough I don't mean physically tough like
[26:52.880 --> 26:57.080]  in a fight they're tougher in other ways
[26:57.920 --> 27:04.240]  and the point is that our boys are being absolutely decimated but the
[27:04.240 --> 27:07.560]  chemical biological radiological operations are getting so bad now it's
[27:07.560 --> 27:11.840]  hitting the girls and it's just devastating the boys and I read these
[27:11.840 --> 27:19.480]  articles about 47,000 and they estimate that only about half those cases are
[27:19.480 --> 27:23.120]  bad enough to where you know they're being put down by the National Health
[27:23.120 --> 27:26.720]  Service because in India they're so poor a lot of folks just died aren't even on
[27:26.720 --> 27:32.320]  the records now they give a they get the oral polio vaccine that is a souped up
[27:32.320 --> 27:36.880]  weaponized version and they get paralysis they get polio and the UN
[27:36.880 --> 27:47.040]  spends it and says well this is a non polio paralysis and we see autism from
[27:47.040 --> 27:54.800]  1 in 25,000 plus 30 or so years ago to now depending on the actuary 1 in 61 1
[27:54.800 --> 28:00.760]  in 58 it varies exponentially logarithmically doubling every two and a
[28:00.760 --> 28:10.680]  half to three years from 25,000 1 in 25,000 it's like 1 in 25,300 something
[28:10.680 --> 28:15.800]  look at the technical numbers down to 1 in 50 or 1 in 60 where's it gonna be
[28:15.800 --> 28:23.680]  next soon every other child will be a medicalized zombie and how's the new
[28:23.680 --> 28:26.960]  order gonna cover that it doesn't matter they've just been testing it soft
[28:26.960 --> 28:31.200]  killing us for when they release the real mega plagues that are just gonna
[28:31.200 --> 28:36.440]  devastate billions that's the plan and once they drop hammer down ladies and
[28:36.440 --> 28:39.600]  gentlemen the globalists are gonna go into their bunkers and it is going to
[28:39.600 --> 28:45.400]  be twilight zone meets road warrior and I know a lot of you're gonna laugh now
[28:45.400 --> 28:48.840]  if we don't back this off that's why I'm risking my life I get death threats
[28:48.840 --> 28:52.680]  attacks you wouldn't believe I just ignore it move forward I know that
[28:52.680 --> 28:56.800]  means I'm over the target but the fact is folks I know the only reason I
[28:56.800 --> 29:01.960]  hope you realize you're hearing a real radio show with someone going hard
[29:01.960 --> 29:09.680]  core 110% up against the New World Order I mean this is real as people can't
[29:09.680 --> 29:12.920]  believe it they're like well how could this guy not work for him is still be
[29:12.920 --> 29:17.720]  alive because of God and your prayers and providence but also they know that it
[29:17.720 --> 29:24.080]  will only highlight everything I've said and done I've got such prolific work out
[29:24.080 --> 29:28.320]  there that if I was some whistleblower that had a particular smoking gun
[29:28.320 --> 29:32.720]  they'll kill you they have like a handbook and they still may whatever
[29:32.720 --> 29:37.280]  we're already dead I've got to save children and it's not because I'm some
[29:37.280 --> 29:43.560]  hero I love the species it's my instinct it's survival it's what I was made for

[32:07.740 --> 32:11.520]  literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins
[32:11.520 --> 32:16.320]  and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating

[33:26.560 --> 33:53.400]  my eyes are blind but I can see the sun no longer sets me free this morning and
[33:53.400 --> 33:59.920]  last night I was just in deep deep deep thought about the nature of the new
[33:59.920 --> 34:06.120]  world order and what we're facing and it just it hit me again for the ten
[34:06.120 --> 34:12.120]  thousandth time but harder than ever that we are right we are accurate our
[34:12.120 --> 34:19.840]  proof is in not triplicate not quadruplicate but ten thousand
[34:19.840 --> 34:28.920]  duplicate I mean it's ridiculous how crazy it is it's like this professor
[34:28.920 --> 34:32.920]  that said treat people for mental illness a lot of other professors have
[34:32.920 --> 34:37.120]  said arrest them if they don't believe in global warming and then when she gets
[34:37.120 --> 34:41.520]  caught in it they use a psych warfare technique but these are all cheap tricks
[34:41.520 --> 34:46.800]  and says oh I didn't write that and they pull it when they get caught with the
[34:46.800 --> 34:52.800]  cash they say oh I didn't mean that and then we've they expunge all her other
[34:52.800 --> 34:58.160]  writings but we find one of her other writings saying get rid of what the
[34:58.160 --> 35:01.480]  Congress wants you know get rid of what the people want just do what she want
[35:01.480 --> 35:06.160]  mr. president I I read that and covered it yesterday here's the headline
[35:06.160 --> 35:14.600]  professor urged Obama to ignore democracy public opinion and in her
[35:14.600 --> 35:18.080]  letter she talks about basically how the public's dumb and that's what it is
[35:18.080 --> 35:23.680]  it's a religion of these people and the camp followers whenever you look at so
[35:23.680 --> 35:27.600]  called liberals they're not liberals the low-level ones are bleeding heart
[35:27.600 --> 35:32.200]  guilt-ridden people who are under the you know hypnotized voice literal
[35:32.200 --> 35:41.680]  hypnotized voice of NPR type stuff but that's just their cover so we've got
[35:41.680 --> 35:51.920]  that going on and it's all about how they're smart and we're stupid but
[35:51.920 --> 35:58.080]  really we're just nice people who aren't evil and twisted and corrupt so we so
[35:58.080 --> 36:03.440]  we have a blind spot but when you look into these globalists all they talk
[36:03.440 --> 36:07.880]  about I mean MSNBC does this to their kind of camp followers is how they're
[36:07.880 --> 36:13.000]  smart everybody else is dumb and then they just repeat that as a religion over
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.200]  and over again and how they're saving the world and how they love everybody and
[36:18.200 --> 36:22.600]  then you research their lives on average they're alone they're miserable their
[36:22.600 --> 36:29.200]  IQs are low but they've got a will to power and dominate and those of us that
[36:29.200 --> 36:33.520]  really do have power and life force and strength we're just giving everybody the
[36:33.520 --> 36:39.360]  benefit of the doubt we don't seek power because we already innately have it
[36:39.360 --> 36:44.680]  we're ashamed of our power we're ashamed of its use even when it's righteous not
[36:44.680 --> 36:50.240]  these people they crave it and those of us that have power real power given to us
[36:50.240 --> 36:56.960]  from the good Lord above have got to start using it on these dragons you have
[36:56.960 --> 37:03.160]  got to release the power you've got to use it or be enslaved why do you think
[37:03.160 --> 37:07.720]  they drug our water and add GMO designed to attack all of our adrenal glands
[37:07.720 --> 37:14.200]  organs blood systems nervous systems reproductive systems on record in every
[37:14.200 --> 37:19.520]  study why do they add radioactive isotopes to the water on record total
[37:19.520 --> 37:24.520]  twilight zone on record why do they do all this because they want to be number
[37:24.520 --> 37:29.760]  one they have to it's like in the movie gladiator to use a popular analogy when
[37:29.760 --> 37:32.840]  the crazy emperor there was actually real cases of this if you study Rome's
[37:32.840 --> 37:37.160]  under other names so that stories a composite of true stories kind of like
[37:37.160 --> 37:40.720]  the Patriot with it with Mel Gibson as a composite of three stories that when
[37:40.720 --> 37:46.160]  you've read Roman history that Ridley Scott movie I think even wrote it didn't
[37:46.160 --> 37:50.960]  he gladiator with Russell Crowe I think his best role is a composite of real
[37:50.960 --> 37:56.560]  things that happened but it's a composite like five different stories the
[37:56.560 --> 38:01.360]  emperor has him tied up stabs him in his heart but with a little you know stabs
[38:01.360 --> 38:05.780]  that he'll die in 30 minutes or so stabs him expertly brings him out to
[38:05.780 --> 38:09.680]  fighting and that's what they do that from birth they just stab is so they
[38:09.680 --> 38:13.440]  can be better than us you're smarter than me you're more beautiful you're not
[38:13.440 --> 38:18.000]  evil like I am you're happy like the fairy tales the wicked witch doesn't
[38:18.000 --> 38:24.800]  get invited into the marriage she curses everybody sleeping beauty those
[38:24.800 --> 38:29.480]  parables are all based in real things you know what I can't beat you out in
[38:29.480 --> 38:37.280]  gladiatorial floor so I'm gonna stab you in the heart with a nice pick and then
[38:37.280 --> 38:41.280]  run you out there to fight me two minutes later while you're bleeding to
[38:41.280 --> 38:46.680]  death inside that's what they do so they can I mean it is a cult of
[38:46.680 --> 38:53.200]  intellectual midgets and I want to indict you right now you will fail
[38:53.200 --> 39:01.120]  humanity will defeat you and I commit everything I am once again and I swear on
[39:01.120 --> 39:07.040]  the altar of Almighty God eternal resistance against every form of
[39:07.040 --> 39:12.680]  tyranny over the mind of men you guys queue up that Thomas Jefferson quote for
[39:12.680 --> 39:25.200]  me you see because the tyranny is over the mind first they want that mind they
[39:25.200 --> 39:29.320]  I mean if you looked at globalist I don't get it how people look but as a from
[39:29.320 --> 39:36.360]  a sociological view or from the study of cultural anthropology in every culture
[39:36.360 --> 39:42.960]  these ruling elites are like hunchback snaggletooth cross-eyed but always have
[39:42.960 --> 39:47.760]  the same weird leering demonic smile that's why whenever I saw this photo of
[39:47.760 --> 39:51.360]  this professor it was shocking and it looked like something on a fright night
[39:51.360 --> 39:58.080]  because I've seen it over and over again with Pionka he dresses up in a Gandalf
[39:58.080 --> 40:04.360]  outfit and talks about Lucifer on the UT site and how he wants to have 90% of
[40:04.360 --> 40:10.960]  us die one of the top guys in the biology department and he does interviews
[40:10.960 --> 40:15.960]  and he can hardly talk and he's not like he's some absent-minded professor he is
[40:15.960 --> 40:27.640]  a moron I have seen the enemy they are piles of demonic disease crud and that's
[40:27.640 --> 40:42.640]  why they hate us and poison us because they want to make us like them we need
[40:42.640 --> 40:45.760]  to let them have it in the info war we've got the smarts no matter what
[40:45.760 --> 40:51.000]  they've done to us some of us still have it we've got the will it's time in the
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.920]  info war to hit them and hit them hard and hit them again and hit them again and
[40:55.920 --> 40:59.600]  hit them again and hit them and hit them and hit them and hit them when you
[40:59.600 --> 41:04.220]  think you're tired second win and hit them and hit them and hit them and hit
[41:04.220 --> 41:07.920]  them and hit them and hit them when they hit the ground stomp them and stomp
[41:07.920 --> 41:11.280]  them into the ground you know where that whole thing comes from the old word
[41:11.280 --> 41:14.640]  I'll stomp you into the ground because in the old days when people would beat
[41:14.640 --> 41:19.340]  each other to death that's how you do it you stomp somebody into the ground I'm
[41:19.340 --> 41:23.360]  not talking about physical violence here I'm talking about in the information
[41:23.360 --> 41:29.520]  war. Hit them, and then hit them again, and then hit them, and then hit them, and when
[41:29.520 --> 41:35.280]  they hit back, that pain does not feel good, but it feels good to the soul, because you
[41:35.280 --> 41:41.880]  know you are gunning right up at them. You know you're hitting paid or up one side and
[41:41.880 --> 41:48.480]  down the other. We've got to stand up for all these innocence. These people are running
[41:48.480 --> 41:53.240]  through like a meat grinder right now. I can just see all the innocence. They're tearing
[41:53.240 --> 42:00.080]  up and diseasing and hurting and ruining and taking their dreams and destroying them.
[42:00.080 --> 42:07.120]  And I want the spirit of humanity to turn towards the light and turn towards life force
[42:07.120 --> 42:15.120]  and creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit and turn the power
[42:15.120 --> 42:29.080]  of humanity loose against these enemies. I want posters of her printed up in the office,
[42:29.080 --> 42:34.640]  and I want posters of Eric Pionka who says kill 90% of us. I want to get photos of David
[42:34.640 --> 42:38.480]  Rockefeller, all of them, and I want them all over our walls. I want us to remember
[42:38.480 --> 42:44.400]  who we're fighting. I want Bill Gates, another demon-eyed creature. They can look right into
[42:44.400 --> 43:01.800]  their souls. I want us every day to remember who we are and remember who our enemy is.
[43:01.800 --> 43:10.000]  Their crimes must be met head on. Every corrupt inbred elite always builds the same system
[43:10.000 --> 43:14.840]  where the public is scum and they've got a torturous and starve us and dominate us and
[43:14.840 --> 43:23.280]  make us grovel and that they're our saviors. This is what the scum of the earth manifest
[43:23.280 --> 43:31.640]  in every culture and every society. This is the attack profile, signature, algorithm,
[43:31.640 --> 43:43.280]  wavelength, broadcast of demon scum. Sworn upon the altar of God, for I have sworn upon
[43:43.280 --> 43:48.880]  the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[43:48.880 --> 43:55.360]  That's Thomas Jefferson, we can see who said the quote. There's another one of those that
[43:55.360 --> 43:59.640]  stand for nothing will fall for anything. It's been said many times throughout history,
[43:59.640 --> 44:03.840]  that's why they can't find out exactly who said it. It's also attributed to Alexander
[44:03.840 --> 44:11.080]  Hamilton. That's great, guys. I want to play the liner. We have a liner of Thomas Jefferson
[44:11.080 --> 44:19.920]  with the voice of her guy saying it. But let me hit him in the core here. The eugenics
[44:19.920 --> 44:30.200]  death cult took the writings of Plato and others from 2,400 years ago or so. Or is it
[44:30.200 --> 44:36.520]  2,300? They took the writings of that because that was already the belief of the Greeks,
[44:36.520 --> 44:40.000]  changed it because they thought a few thousand Greeks was crushing the quote breast of Mother
[44:40.000 --> 44:46.040]  Earth. So they had to and they wanted to exterminate the poor people and all the rest of it. Because
[44:46.040 --> 44:51.960]  it's a disease of embeds. It's always in a decline of a system that they start taking
[44:51.960 --> 44:57.680]  their God. Early on in the Roman system, Greek system, others, the common person in their
[44:57.680 --> 45:06.080]  hard work and the fact that the real strong blood comes out of the commoner and refreshes
[45:06.080 --> 45:12.200]  the elite, that's what always builds it. But as things become decadent, it's the other
[45:12.200 --> 45:17.960]  view. Then the elites always carry out policies to dumb down and make the commoner the squalid
[45:17.960 --> 45:23.840]  animal that they have stated we are. It's like you are dumb, so I'm going to give you
[45:23.840 --> 45:32.360]  a lobotomy to prove it. So they take this idea in about 1850 or so, codify it along with
[45:32.360 --> 45:37.960]  the theory and the origin of species. The Wedgewoods, the Gaultons, the Darwin's, the
[45:37.960 --> 45:46.360]  Huxleys, they all intermarry on record to produce the Superman. If they were such Superman,
[45:46.360 --> 45:50.640]  they'd know that the Egyptians and every other royal society had done this until most
[45:50.640 --> 45:56.560]  their children are born stillborn, mentally retarded, or if they do live, are wildly vicious
[45:56.560 --> 46:00.920]  and schizophrenic and psychopathic. Because I mean, that's what happens if you get a breed
[46:00.920 --> 46:07.200]  of dog and breed them a whole bunch. If they make it through the medical problems and most
[46:07.200 --> 46:11.680]  the litters completely die, you're going to end up getting some litters that are completely
[46:11.680 --> 46:20.680]  insane and vicious. In the litter, the few that live, that's the real system, plus the
[46:20.680 --> 46:25.880]  elites drinking pottery lined with lead to make it waterproof, making them criminally
[46:25.880 --> 46:32.920]  insane, the inbreeding, inbreeding with other families. And so they believe they would produce
[46:32.920 --> 46:44.480]  the Superman, the Vril. That's what I cover in my secrets of Prometheus, Leaked, Vidya.
[46:44.480 --> 46:50.400]  That's only got 400,000 views, should have 10 million. This is what the elite believe.
[46:50.400 --> 46:56.880]  And we've got their genealogy because it was public. It is a public experiment. By three
[46:56.880 --> 47:02.440]  generations of this, that's just 60 years on average, every 20 years, start having children.
[47:02.440 --> 47:09.080]  In 60 years, almost all of them were stillborn, miscarriages. The few that lived had to be
[47:09.080 --> 47:14.120]  locked up in mental institutions, horrible deformities, and they got a few of their quote
[47:14.120 --> 47:29.280]  Superman and put them in over the UN and everything. Julian Huxley, all of them. That's your Superman.
[47:29.280 --> 47:36.440]  So now with the genetic engineering, the chemical warfare, we're following a 160-year-old plan.
[47:36.440 --> 47:41.520]  They said we've got to discover what makes the smallest compounds in the body so we can
[47:41.520 --> 47:47.480]  control it. They did discover DNA, and all the discoveries of DNA on record say none
[47:47.480 --> 47:52.760]  of us are human except them, and they're going to kill all of us, and blacks are animals.
[47:52.760 --> 47:57.040]  Go look up. There's three discoverers of it on record, and then just take their name
[47:57.040 --> 48:00.720]  and put in, say blacks aren't human, and say everybody else need to be killed, and you'll
[48:00.720 --> 48:06.440]  get their quotes. It's big scandals. But it was because they were looking for it, had
[48:06.440 --> 48:12.160]  control of the government, and wanted this power. And they'll say, yeah, you say we're
[48:12.160 --> 48:15.400]  ugly and twisted, but look, we're the ones that looked for it, so we're going to the
[48:15.400 --> 48:19.320]  next level. So they say we're not part of the debate of GMO. We're not part of the debate
[48:19.320 --> 48:22.920]  of how they say they're going to forcibly evolve us to merge with machines, those of
[48:22.920 --> 48:27.280]  us that are left. They write articles about how they plan to kill most of us, and laugh
[48:27.280 --> 48:31.200]  at us in public magazines like Wired Magazine, saying even though we're writing this you
[48:31.200 --> 48:40.360]  won't care. Bill Joy. And I'm like, hey, I don't want to be killed, and I don't want
[48:40.360 --> 48:46.360]  to join with you either. I mean, they get most of these low grade morons in and tell
[48:46.360 --> 48:49.680]  them you're part of the elite because you believe in this, and then these very people
[48:49.680 --> 48:56.840]  are being soft killed. I mean, this is like the worst serial killer comes to your door
[48:56.840 --> 49:04.280]  and says, I want to take your son for a trip across America. You'd be nuts to turn your
[49:04.280 --> 49:08.920]  child over to him. And that's who runs our society, our governments and systems that
[49:08.920 --> 49:13.160]  have been caught thousands of times killing our troops in secret experiments, killing
[49:13.160 --> 49:18.400]  foster kids, shooting people up with syphilis, polio, and I know more and more this is all
[49:18.400 --> 49:23.880]  I tend to talk about because that's it. I mean, we're in a system murdering everybody
[49:23.880 --> 49:27.840]  with soft kill weapons with compartmentalized doctors who don't know what's going on. We're
[49:27.840 --> 49:31.320]  breaking that compartmentalization right now, more and more are getting it and freaking
[49:31.320 --> 49:37.600]  out when they go research what I'm saying. And we are in a system where a bunch of crazy
[49:37.600 --> 49:42.200]  people that think they're going to be Godmen, the first computer that IBM Thomas Watson
[49:42.200 --> 49:46.920]  came up with was race mixing study computers. Then he sold them to Hitler. The number they
[49:46.920 --> 49:51.800]  put on people was to be put into that computer. It was a mechanical computer and it would
[49:51.800 --> 49:56.800]  decide how much to feed you, how long to keep you alive. They put in height, weight, age,
[49:56.800 --> 50:00.360]  power of the skin and it would tell you, do you just go ahead and shoot this person, work
[50:00.360 --> 50:03.960]  him to death or how long can you work him to death?
[50:03.960 --> 50:11.760]  Our entire system biometrics, 150 year old plan by Galton to create a system for buying
[50:11.760 --> 50:18.640]  and selling and deciding if your eugenics are pure. All of it, every major science, every
[50:18.640 --> 50:24.240]  single science was taken over by them and turned into a way to prove they're the supermen
[50:24.240 --> 50:30.240]  and we're garbage. And now they've screwed up humanity, our DNA is screwed up, our sperm,
[50:30.240 --> 50:35.840]  eggs, everything fried on record, 90 plus percent fried. They're attacking the entire
[50:35.840 --> 50:40.320]  earth, the entire biosphere, this instinct, this will to destruction, there's thousands
[50:40.320 --> 50:45.080]  of plant grasses being GMO released, just total warfare against the planet, genetic
[50:45.080 --> 50:49.560]  armageddon, swatter of the biosphere while running around saying they're saving the
[50:49.560 --> 50:58.800]  earth. I mean just mega crazy, mega insane, mega off the charts. We'll be back, I'll

[52:38.320 --> 52:42.600]  Ambron eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too. So with your hormones in balance

[54:06.000 --> 54:14.160]  hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man. Thomas Jefferson. It's Alex
[54:14.160 --> 54:21.160]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[54:21.160 --> 54:28.720]  All right, we are back live. The globalists say that they are God and so they've sought
[54:28.720 --> 54:33.520]  after the technology. Well, we're happy to just raise our children, live our lives and
[54:33.520 --> 54:39.000]  contribute developments that they then steal and cobble together like pieces of Legos and
[54:39.000 --> 54:46.080]  build monstrous constructions. And I've intended to take calls and then I just look at Bill
[54:46.080 --> 54:50.400]  Gates giving people polio vaccine and it's spreading polio all over the world full of
[54:50.400 --> 54:56.000]  cancer viruses and paralyzing the kids and they just go, yeah, conspiracy theorists think
[54:56.000 --> 55:02.240]  they're doing it on purpose, but it is doing it to them, but we're going to continue. Yeah,
[55:02.240 --> 55:09.000]  my conspiracy theorist means people that don't trust known liars. They think the mega banks
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.400]  have imploded the world economy on purpose and are taking over, but in truth, the big
[55:13.400 --> 55:21.120]  banks are just taking over to take care of everybody. Yeah, autism's gone from 125,000
[55:21.120 --> 55:30.440]  plus to 150, 160 depending on which actuary, but yeah, it is a big global epidemic, but
[55:30.440 --> 55:35.760]  sure not the mercury we inject into you or the pesticide fluoride, they spray on the
[55:35.760 --> 55:43.240]  crops or all of it, just a total curse on our children. And you know that Alex Jones,
[55:43.240 --> 55:48.960]  he's a bad guy. He gets upset by all this. See, I've gotten to the point now, ladies
[55:48.960 --> 55:57.480]  and gentlemen, where I can't go to the shopping mall because they got cops all over them now,
[55:57.480 --> 56:02.840]  like we're a third world country or something. And it'll go buy some shoes or whatever because
[56:02.840 --> 56:09.400]  I'll see a kid with their hair falling out age 10 or 12, even sometimes with ports in
[56:09.400 --> 56:13.600]  their chest because they'll have their shirt down. You could see the big lump. If you know
[56:13.600 --> 56:19.000]  what you're looking for, for the chemo insertion or the chemo's on their arm, the chemo ports
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.400]  and they're being taken out, they'll be dead in a few months, but mama's taking them, mama's
[56:23.400 --> 56:29.200]  real sad, hits me like, punch in the stomach, boom. And then I'll see some cop or security
[56:29.200 --> 56:32.720]  guard looking everybody like they're the enemy on a little power trip. And I want to go over
[56:32.720 --> 56:36.600]  and grab them by the shoulders and say, we're all being murdered, idiot. Stop being thinking
[56:36.600 --> 56:44.040]  we're the enemy and we're the bad people. Understand it's the system. It's all this
[56:44.040 --> 56:48.280]  guilt of the general public's bad. The general public's going to do something, but oh, the
[56:48.280 --> 56:54.440]  government and the big bank buildings and all the shining steel structures, that represents
[56:54.440 --> 56:59.720]  the establishment with a bunch of pot, belly, twisted, faced, evil. It's just that the evil
[56:59.720 --> 57:04.680]  manifest on their faces, just with crazed looks in their eyes and every photo I see
[57:04.680 --> 57:10.880]  of these people, just in rapture, that they're hurting everybody and getting off on it and
[57:10.880 --> 57:15.480]  just endlessly torturing us and screwing with us and hurting us and dumbing us down
[57:15.480 --> 57:21.120]  and poisoning us and spreading poverty and wrecking societies and shutting down our industry
[57:21.120 --> 57:29.680]  and disease everything.
[57:29.680 --> 57:34.520]  I want to awaken the spirit of humanity to recognize the difference between good and
[57:34.520 --> 57:39.520]  evil and see the curse and the disease that is the new world order and its henchmen and
[57:39.520 --> 57:48.920]  its minions. Death manifest. Death attacking creation and the system of creation. An attack
[57:48.920 --> 57:53.360]  on the genetics of the globe. Of course, they claim they're environmentalist because they
[57:53.360 --> 57:59.680]  are earth killers. They are death. They come to kill, steal and destroy. Recognize them
[57:59.680 --> 58:11.720]  as the eternal enemy they are. I had a magical experience yesterday. Magic. I went home a
[58:11.720 --> 58:15.240]  little bit early about five o'clock, pulled off the road by a green belt. I know people
[58:15.240 --> 58:23.400]  won't climb down the cliffs to. Went down into Barton Creek and swam for about an hour
[58:23.400 --> 58:32.160]  and swam laps. And the reeds and the sunlight coming through at an angle. A little perch
[58:32.160 --> 58:45.320]  swimming over to me. The crawdads. The butterflies. It was like Valhalla. This is GCN, the Genesis
[58:45.320 --> 58:54.200]  communications radio network. When you're out on the road, the last place you want
[58:54.200 --> 59:01.800]  to be is on the road. But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond
[59:01.800 --> 59:11.600]  gussets. There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[59:11.600 --> 59:20.720]  They so pride in every stitch. Guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond
[59:20.720 --> 59:29.760]  gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't.
[59:29.760 --> 59:36.560]  We turned jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[59:36.560 --> 59:41.120]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can
[59:41.120 --> 59:48.360]  ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[59:48.360 --> 59:53.640]  Others don't.

[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:12.320]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:21.800]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:28.880]  All right, we're back live. The toll-free number to join us on some of the issues I've
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.840]  covered is 800-259-9231. We'll have totally open phones the third hour. We got a guest
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:41.640]  popping up for about 20 minutes at the bottom of the hour. I'll take some calls. Now, coming
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:47.320]  up, I've already talked about this for a week, but now it was senior people connected to
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:57.880]  the White House. That's who runs MSNBC and NBC that edited it together to make George
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.320]  Zimmerman sound like he was a racist. The original clip was Zimmerman. I'm going to
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:05.840]  play it later. This guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:12.560]  It's raining, and he's just walking around looking about. Dispatcher. Okay. And the
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:18.200]  guy is he black, white, or Hispanic? Zimmerman. He looks black. The altered NBC News version
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:23.360]  simply ran this way. Zimmerman. This guy looks like he's up to no good. He looks black. They
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:28.040]  edited it together. And folks, I've had him do stuff like that to me. There's always
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.680]  people on the web that poses Alex Jones and go out and do stuff. I mean, it's just, it's
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:41.280]  just the culture of cowards. And the system wants to get a race war going in this country
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:47.360]  because the globalists are busy killing everybody. Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton won't talk about
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:56.720]  it. I've got DOJ attempts to install their own embedded monitor in the Sheriff Joe's
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.640]  office. I've got huge news on how the illegal aliens are above the law, but citizens won't
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:07.800]  be able to travel under IRS control. That's all coming up. Tulfrey Number to join us 800
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:12.640]  at 259-9231. Alan and Oregon, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:17.040]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex? Been wanting to talk to you for quite some time.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:23.880]  It was good to talk to you. I just had a couple little points I wanted to make. I think we
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:29.920]  need to stop calling these people elite because it's just given a subliminal kind of a message
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:38.220]  to people. The criminal maggot worshippers. That's on track. Because I think every time
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:42.680]  even I hear it and I'm against it all, I'm right there with you. It kind of makes me
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:51.320]  stop and block. The criminal hijackers of humanity. What should we call, and we've got
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:57.040]  big debates about what do we call the prostitute media, the sewer stream media, the Decepticon
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:03.480]  media, the trader media. What do we call the main slime media? But this is a better debate.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.840]  In fact, I'm going to ask listeners now. You can talk about whatever you want to give me
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:15.440]  your caveat. What do we call the criminal hijackers? I call them the ruling cancer. That's what
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:22.800]  they are. They're earth cancer. The globalists are earth cancer.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:30.720]  I had just a couple of the quick little mentions. I was watching Saturday Night Live and the
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.280]  Jay Leno show and they're really mocking things. On the Jay Leno show, April 2nd, Betty White
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:41.680]  was on. It was her birthday. They had an Obama little mentioned clip come on and Obama
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:48.080]  mocks the whole birth certificate thing by requesting Betty White to send him her long
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:54.840]  form birth certificate so he can verify. She really is 90 years old, complete mockery and
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.840]  it's sickening.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:01.040]  Well, that's a very simple psychological warfare thing. We all know Betty White, who she says
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:08.400]  he has known her forever. She's Americana, so he associates himself with her and implies
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.120]  you wouldn't want hers, you wouldn't want his. Pure propaganda.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:17.240]  I just think there's something we could do without this. We could turn it around and
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:22.000]  use it against them. Maybe it's time to start criticizing these daily shows in the Corbair
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.160]  Report and get under their skin.
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:29.280]  I agree. In fact, guys, I even saw that clip. Get that ready for the nightly news. If not
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:35.280]  tonight, we'll do it on Monday or the Sunday show. Get that ready. Betty White on Jay Leno
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:41.160]  and a little Obama snip because we'll show how they do that.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.720]  No, no, no. Betty White didn't give up her citizenship in Indonesia and have the name
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:49.560]  Barry Satero on record. Betty White didn't block all her student records and she didn't
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:54.440]  become president of the U.S. Betty White didn't lie systematically about everything she said
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.280]  she'd do and launch wars like congressional approval.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.280]  Anything else, Alan?
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:05.200]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to

[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:05.240]  A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:09.920]  good sized meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:14.120]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:19.520]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:24.800]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:30.400]  healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:27.240]  All right, I just went to calls back in that short little segment and a caller, Alan, brought
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:31.760]  up. Hey, did you see Jay Leno? I just see the short clip online where they had a famous
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:37.600]  old actress on there with Betty White or whatever her name is. 90 years old and Obama had a clip
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.400]  on the show saying, hey, show me your birth certificate. I don't believe you're 90. Somebody
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:46.640]  else wouldn't have signing statements, wouldn't have banker bailouts. You're a known liar
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:51.280]  whose real name was Barry Sataro on record and gave up your citizenship. I knew that
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:57.840]  four years ago, people called it a conspiracy. Now they just admit it. Then they issue a
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:01.640]  fake birth certificate. Remember for three years saying, this is it. There is no long
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:09.160]  form. There is no such thing. Then they release this new thing that's ridiculously fake. And
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:14.560]  I think they did that on purpose. The U.S. government could have put out a good fake.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.000]  Anybody could have. Why do they want to make this the issue? Because they want to make
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.640]  it about Obama. He's just a puppet frontman. But the powerful interests behind him are
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:25.920]  turning the presidency into a dictatorship. That's one of the big issues I want to get
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:32.080]  to later in the third hour. As I go back to your calls now, is that finally, even mainstream
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:38.800]  corporate media is saying, wow, this is dictatorial. He's ignoring Congress on war and he's telling
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:45.880]  the Supreme Court he might try to ignore them and courts are raising this. I mean, again,
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:50.800]  this is serious. When they say, we don't care if it violates the fourth and fifth amendment
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:55.360]  and 10th amendment, we'll have the TSA grab your genitals. We'll have them in your state
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:58.840]  level. We'll have them on highway checkpoints. We don't care. By the way, we're not going
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:03.160]  to let you travel if you haven't paid your taxes. I mean, this is total banker dictatorship.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:08.640]  Meanwhile, the illegal aliens are above the law and the government issues them illegal
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:17.920]  alien waivers. Illegal stavises just automatically. Print me that because it's been a few days
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:24.840]  since I saw the article. What does the Justice Department call it? They're calling it a unlawful
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:30.080]  entry waiver. Print me the exact name. It's a judicial watch documents, judicial watch
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:33.520]  illegals being given to get out of jail free card. That'll pull it up. I need the exact
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:39.560]  name of it. Thank you. But Alan was pointing out it's time to show the propaganda. I agree.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.480]  It's why I'm trying to get more reporters. I'm trying to get more people to have more
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:47.120]  news packages where we've got news packages every single day on the nightly news and news
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:56.600]  packages. We end up airing here on the radio. Pardon me. Unlawful, unlawful presence waiver.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:01.360]  Yeah, put that in and show it on screen. We already knew this under Bush and under Obama
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.120]  and expanded. They will bust a meatpacking plant a couple times a year, 1000 employees
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:09.680]  on average and arrest the owners and find them and feed them because they're not part
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:13.360]  of a big mega company. They're not part of the inside baseball. Really, it's just shutting
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:19.580]  down competition for having illegals. Then they take the illegals by truck publicly over
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:24.520]  and give them all green cards. Sheriffs have talked about it. They catch illegals burning
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:28.600]  stuff down, killing people. They take them to ICE after they've been in jail for six
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:34.720]  months and ICE just releases them. Look at this. I saw a headline a few years ago on
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:45.400]  the Houston Chronicle where it said 249,000 was the headline. Aggravated felons released
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.840]  out of Houston jails in one year. And I remember reading that in the Houston Chronicle saying
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:58.280]  they had in one year, 249,000 people. I know there's like eight million people in that
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:07.240]  whole area, but my, I didn't even, I don't even know that's true.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:12.120]  Aggravated felons, folks. That's rape. I mean, look at this. DHS to grant illegal aliens
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:20.240]  unlawful presence waivers. Judicial watch. I just, I just can't even take it anymore.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:27.520]  I mean, it's insane. All right, let's go back to Alan. I'm going to shut up. Alan and Oregon,
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:28.520]  you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:33.600]  Hey, I was almost thinking that maybe we could use something like that to your advantage
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:40.600]  and start kind of making a point each daily show. Just do a mock shows like the Daily
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.040]  Show and Colbert Report. Maybe just to get a rise out of it.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:48.240]  Yeah, well, mocking gets them. Mocking gets them. Mainly what we're having banned on YouTube
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.600]  is if I make fun of Al Gore banned, I make fun of Obama banned. Nothing racial said about
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:59.000]  either one of them. If I say anything about this professor, they ban it. I mean, you're
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  just not allowed to talk about them because they're God. And I agree. They don't like
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:09.440]  being mocked. They block that TSA video making fun of them. That they do not like being made
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.120]  fun of. They love horrifying us. They love it when we're desperate and going bankrupt.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:16.920]  They love our humiliation. They love our pain. They love our cancer. They love our death.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:22.800]  They hate our freedom. But when we laugh at them, it really gets to them. Why do you think
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.760]  that is? Because I don't I like being laughed at. I like being ridiculed by scum. I could
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:31.240]  care less. I wonder why they don't like being laughed at. Why do you think that Alan?
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:36.080]  They don't like being laughed at like any other bully doesn't like being laughed at. He thinks
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:40.680]  he's got a muscle muscle fear into somebody. And then when the tables are turned, they
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:47.520]  don't know how to respond and react. And they need power trips. That's right. They're going
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:51.760]  to fail. Don't you know in your gut, this is sure, as you know, the sun's coming up
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.440]  tomorrow morning, we're going to beat these people. And when humanity survives its greatest
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:59.880]  test, thanks to God's help, it's going to really push us to the next level. We defeat
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:08.800]  these scum. Hey, Alex, I hope one day I can stand by your side and shake your hand, buddy.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:14.400]  I hope one day I can join you in this in the physical realm versus sitting here and watching
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.400]  about it.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:20.200]  We'll get out there and fight the new world order. Big things start small, brother. Appreciate
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:25.160]  your call. Engage. Engage. Start an access show. Start a radio blog. I want the radio
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:31.360]  blog site. Start YouTube. Start firing, firing, firing, firing, firing, firing. I shot a video
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:36.640]  during the break. In fact, I'll tell you what, will you guys go have whoever suddenly turned
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.200]  into a huge committee meeting? Because every time I try to download stuff off my iPhone,
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:46.200]  my little devil tracker phone made by slaves, every time they do this, they end up downloading
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:50.280]  the entire thing that de-indexes them and do was showing Aaron how to do it yesterday.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.200]  I want the last video you saw me shoot during the break where it showed the collateral murder
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:59.640]  or a patchy shoot in the Reuters reporters. My point is, that's all over YouTube, public
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:04.960]  domain, WikiLeaks. When I show that on my channel, they take it down and shut the channel
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:09.600]  down before until I threaten to sue them and do a bunch of stuff. I want to show that out
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:23.400]  there on NBC, we had NBC on, excuse me, was CNBC. Same thing. CNBC and it's on out there
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:30.400]  and I showed them showing and watch the public ban my channel for that because I'm not allowed
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:35.520]  to communicate to you. Why is that? Because I will stop them because not that I'm even
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:42.160]  good. They're a pack of weak deception. All you got to do is call their bluff. Doesn't
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:45.080]  mean all of us that call their bluff are going to make it out of this, but the spirit of
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:53.760]  crushing, diseased, new world order, control freak, murderous trash is pure victory. All
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:59.040]  that matters is they're defeated. That's truly living. Let's go ahead and go to Richard in
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:02.560]  Kansas. We're not in Kansas anymore, but I guess we are. Go ahead, Richard, you're on
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:07.600]  the air. How are you doing, Alex? I'm just absolutely fine. This is how I feel all the
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:12.280]  time and I'm always controlling myself not to act like this. The more and more I've been
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:18.480]  finding out about, I'm pretty much there with you. We've got to get motivated. Go ahead.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:23.840]  That's the problem. There's a lot of motivation for a few people up here, but the area in
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:29.000]  Kansas we live in has kind of been on lockdown and I'll go ahead and say I'm a 29-year-old
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.440]  combat vet, you know, OIF vet and the way we've been getting treated up here is it's
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:40.160]  almost, others have been describing it almost like Vietnam level. Sir, you're the enemy.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:45.840]  They say you are the ultimate enemy of Homeland Security because Homeland Security is a foreign
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:52.360]  receivership banker mafia. Go ahead. Oh, and it's definitely working. Literally just trying
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:57.160]  to go out in public. Even just trying to go to the corner store for cigarettes. Just wearing
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:03.800]  a dog tag is enough to get you yelled at, threatened, actually had people corner off
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:11.600]  with me at a Titanic event that was up in Union Station. So it's really up to the point
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:18.760]  where me and other vets that even my wife has spoken to through Facebook and other media
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.760]  that none of us are leaving the house anymore. Well, it's not just you though. I took my
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:29.000]  wife to a movie last night. We had a babysitter and the teenagers threw the 3D glasses and
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.640]  hit me in the back of the head with them and I thought it was an accident and then they
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:36.240]  got I didn't say anything and they got up and left like two minutes before the movie
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:39.120]  ended, I guess because they figured out they shouldn't have done it. And then as I was
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:45.080]  walking my wife out, these teenagers, these were like punk, you know, wealthy white kids,
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:50.960]  you could tell, started like bowing up a little and I ignored it. And then one of them ran
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:55.640]  up behind me like he was going to sucker punch me in the back of the head. And I just turned
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:18:00.640]  around and I looked at him and I was like, am I going to have to do like probably 16
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:06.440]  to 18? I was like, do these, I mean, it was ridiculous. I'm telling you, the public is
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:11.120]  there's top got killed in Austin last night for no reason. They shot some black guy in
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:17.120]  the back running the death everywhere craziness crime exploding. Sir, it's not just you. People
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:24.240]  are going crazy. But what types of folks, what types of folks are getting in your face?
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:28.680]  Ironically, like most people might be automatically thinking, oh, he's going to say one thing
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:36.560]  or another. They got it. But ironically, it's mostly like 18 to 24, 25 year old. I would
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.720]  say more privileged white males. No, that's it. They did. No, no, no, it's like a jibbering
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:46.520]  class and they pose. It's like TV warped their mind. I walked out and it was like 50, you
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:50.920]  know, kids and it was a nicer area town. We drove to see a movie and they were all like
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:55.160]  posing and acting weird and like messing with each other. Isn't like I even looked at them
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.760]  and I was like, yeah, that's the group hit me in the back of the head, you know, with
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:04.640]  the sunglasses, you know, with the 3D glasses and and they were all just sorry. It's just
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.600]  the end of society. We're this country's collapsing.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:15.880]  Really, like, like for the last three months, myself and of course, my wife, because she's
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:22.920]  actually, she actually has Native American status. After about three months, I would
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:28.160]  say about three months, honey, of handing out resumes, doing applications, handing out
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.800]  resumes, doing applications, no jobs, no callbacks. I actually had a gentleman from
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:37.840]  the security company tell me, you know, because I was speaking to him about an application
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.800]  that, you know, if I'm U.S. Army, I might as well give up trying to find work in this
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:47.600]  area. And that's because they say, think you're they've been told your damage goods
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:53.040]  serve in four, five, six tours, which is not really true. Compared to the average public,
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:57.680]  you're not half as prone to be insane. They're just cowardly insane people. Stay there. I'm
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:03.480]  going to come back to you. Do you know which 37 crucial food items are
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:07.600]  going to fly off the shelves when the next disaster hits? If you don't, you and your

[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:07.240]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:11.560]  like no one is home. Don't let your home be the next target. Make it look like someone
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:16.360]  is home watching television with fake TV. Fake TV is a small electronic device that
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:20.240]  makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:25.200]  home watching TV. Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:30.480]  to burglars. Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm and is highly recommended
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:34.760]  by numerous police departments. Use it anytime you're away from home. To order your fake

[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:16.560]  is the system knows how to create false role models for young people. So whether you're
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:22.080]  black, white, Hispanic, Asian, it doesn't matter. On every show, the guy that gets the
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:29.240]  girl acts like a gibbering idiotic, arrested development moron. And I was just talking
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:34.240]  to some of the crew, they say everywhere you go now, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:40.360]  You have got people who will make fun of you, who will bump into you, who will slap at you,
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:46.120]  they're having epidemics of men in subways rubbing up against women and basically hunching
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:55.480]  on them. It's just we're turning into animals. You had this old white guy, you know, 70-something
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:25:01.760]  years old, 78-year-old, you know, looks like he's not too long in this world, beat up by
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:09.000]  some black guys saying it was for Trayvon. But it's more than that. It's just beat up
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:16.160]  old people, start fights with adults. I mean, these people that are 16, 17 are already really
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:20.000]  adults. They would have been adults 100 years ago. And 100 years ago, if you did that to
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.320]  somebody, they would just pull a pistol out and shoot you. And the police wouldn't do
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.840]  anything because, well, you were seeing affronting someone. That's why people are real polite
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:32.840]  in the South was because, you know, in the old days, even just 50 years ago, you did
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:36.040]  something like that. And I don't think those kids, when they hit me in the back of the
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:40.400]  head with the sunglasses, they must have known who I was, or then can said something to me.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:45.040]  Because we came in two cars. I kind of walked around with my wife by where her car was came
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:48.120]  walking back down where mine was. And that's when they ran up behind me and all that. And
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:52.400]  I turned around to these guys. It's not that I missed her tough guy. It's just I was like,
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.920]  do they realize that? Okay, let's say they're tough. They're going to get in a fight with
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:03.560]  somebody who weighs 230 pounds and I'm pretty strong. And I don't look like a wimp. And
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:08.160]  they must be so disconnected from reality. They don't know who I am. They don't know
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:12.560]  if I'm a concealed weapon holder. They don't know if I'm some crazy, you know, veteran
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:18.720]  and by crazy, who's already willing to attack people. That's why they're that's why young
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:26.280]  people don't like vets. And I've seen it myself. I've seen cases of it on average is because
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:32.400]  they want to think they're violent and powerful. And so the idea that somebody's a soldier,
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:36.280]  why they want to show you because they're so used to shoving old people around and being
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:40.440]  mean to people at movie theaters and doing all this. And they think it's cowardice by
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:47.880]  older people that they're not responding to them. You know, those those young punks, there
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:51.640]  was a bunch of them like 15 of them, they thought I was scared. The difference was it
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:55.920]  was so inviting to have 15 people in front of me. I thought, well, if they attack me,
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:59.400]  I'm going to I'm going to really go captain caveman. And I mean, I'm not going to get
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:04.800]  off into it. But you know, the point is they they mistook the fact that I just turned and
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:08.960]  tried to walk away. And then they laughed that I was a coward, because I was like, no,
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:12.880]  I got a family. I got a mission. I got to get the word out. But I mean, it would have
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:20.720]  been good for them to come up and hit me and teach them a lesson. Teach them a lesson.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.480]  But but but tell us, you know, as a veteran, if they see dog tags or you're wearing your
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:28.920]  jacket or whatever, what do they do to you? What is it that kind of stuff like, hey, tough
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:33.360]  guy, what are you going to do? I mean, what because they're all UFC viewers or whatever.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.360]  What happens?
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:40.600]  Well, the worst incident and I mean, this is just from wearing dog tags, like it pretty
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:46.840]  much got to the point where I mean, you used to wear in a wedding ring, you used to dog
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.080]  tags, it becomes part of you wear it. Tell us, tell us what happens. Tell us quickly.
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:58.900]  Well, the worst example was me, my wife actually had gone out to a recent local grocery store.
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:05.200]  And unfortunately, me and my wife, we just lost a child, unfortunately. And so this
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:13.040]  was just lost a child, this carriage or after they were born, miscarriage. Okay, so you're
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:20.920]  at the store. And unfortunately, my dog tags were out of my shirt. And one of the older
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:25.280]  ladies who was working in gathering carts decided she wouldn't, you know, leaven the
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:33.880]  other word baby killer at me. So of course, this was great timing for this. I mean, I
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:36.880]  pretty much at that point just, you know, walked out and say, you know, I'll be in the
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:41.280]  car because at that point, it's getting to the point where even I'm ready to snap, but
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.280]  I won't.
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:45.560]  But I'll guarantee you that woman loves Obama who's launching more wars. They just want
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:50.040]  to feel like they're good and call you a baby killer when they're the people that let this
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:56.040]  country go into these illegal wars. And so instead, they just like to blame the soldiers.
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:01.760]  Oh, hey, people just love to find that one thing they can focus on so they don't have
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:03.320]  to focus on anything else.
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:08.880]  Listen, I was at the beach and there was a biker rally and usually bikers seem like
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:13.960]  nice folks, but this was a big but I was there with little children and had guys bow up and
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:18.880]  act tough and pull their motorcycles in when I was, you know, they had these plant pots
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:22.600]  out there by this little street and they were and they were pulling their bikes in the part
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:27.040]  between the plant pots and they drove in and I looked at the guy had my three year old
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:32.040]  daughter holding my hand and I almost killed the guy. And I'm sorry, I just grabbed him
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.040]  bang his brains out.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.880]  It's not hard. And the guy didn't understand. I was about to kill him and I looked at him
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:40.600]  and he tried to act tough and then he backed off. But I mean, they don't understand. I just
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:45.560]  can't take it anymore. Just it's a bunch of gang type scum and they make me want to throw
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:50.160]  up. We got a guest coming up and just I'm sorry, sir.
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:30:00.760]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:05.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:09.720]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:14.040]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:19.120]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:23.760]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:29.400]  is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:33.760]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:37.880]  of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:42.200]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:46.520]  in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:05.000]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.120]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:15.640]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:20.800]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are hundreds of great products at
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:27.840]  InfowarsTeam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:34.760]  in just two months. Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:38.520]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:44.440]  than 37 pounds in just two months. Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:49.960]  to go to InfowarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the

[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:27.520]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:33.280]  Bruce Schneier is our guest for the next 25 minutes or so and then I will have nothing
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:38.880]  but your phone calls and key news. I promise in the third hour today, those of you that
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:46.400]  are holding, Robert, Otter, Michael, Carl, Jonathan, and others that are joining us today.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:50.960]  Now I wanted to get Bruce Schneier on because we ran an article. It was also in the Associated
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:58.400]  Press as well. TSA blocks security experts from testifying to Congress, lawmakers, slam
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:02.880]  agency for treating Americans like prisoners and cattle. We've now in the last week seen
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:11.360]  the ad they ran looking for imperious people. That means imperial, bossy, overbearing, dominant.
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:17.000]  And we've also in the last week at TSA caught running sex rings, child porn, rapes, and I
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.960]  saw a report that hundreds of people, over 200 people have their bags robbed per week
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:28.680]  at JFK. Well, my daughter's seven now and she was newborn. I had to go to New York to
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:33.280]  do a speech and some things. And I bought, went to Tiffany's and I'm not a jewelry person,
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:38.040]  but I bought a rattle, a teething ring and another teething ring. And they just opened
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:42.200]  the little box in the boat, check it, make sure it wasn't a bomb and stole one of them.
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:47.400]  Didn't take the other two. They just liked how that looked. So I guess I should be thankful
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:51.640]  they only took that. After all, they've got a stressful job they deserve to rob me. But
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:59.200]  the reason that we have security expert Bruce Schneier on with us today is because, well,
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:03.680]  he was blocked from telling Congress what he wanted because I guess what TSA wants
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:08.360]  they get. Obama can launch wars without congressional approval and he now says the Supreme Court
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:12.720]  doesn't matter. So it's kind of like the TSA tells Congress who gets to have speeches.
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:18.000]  In fact, I saw an article yesterday where Congress was trying to find out about this
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:25.240]  new NSA base in Utah and they were told you're not allowed to know. Really, Congress, co-equal
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:32.080]  or above the president. I mean, we got problems here. So that's a sidebar. But TSA blocks
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:35.800]  security expert from testifying to Congress, lawmaker slam agency for treating Americans
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:40.120]  like prisoners and cattle. The TSA ensured that a leading security expert who has been
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:44.560]  vocally critical of the agency's screening methods was barred from speaking before congressional
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:49.200]  hearing, the hearing before the House committee on the oversight and government reform was
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:52.680]  held Monday in an effort to evaluate the agency's performance and their best concerns raised
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:58.720]  by lawmakers, experts in the field and members of the public. Bruce Schneier is an internationally
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:03.720]  renowned security technologist and author was scheduled to testify about the TSA security
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:12.840]  screening but was formally uninvited at the last minute following a complaint by the agency.
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:17.960]  And he'll tell us what happened to him here and what he would have said to Congress that's
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:22.080]  been censored, but now here reaching three million people. Sir, thank you for coming
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:29.160]  on with us. Thanks for having me. Okay. Tell us about yourself and what happened here.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:35.200]  So there was a hearing on the TSA on basically whether they're worth it, whether they're
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:39.640]  effective and this is mostly about their new measures, the full body scanners, the spot
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:45.640]  program that looks for people who are not acting right, a bunch of things. And I was
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:52.480]  one of the four witnesses scheduled and at the Friday before the Monday hearing, I got
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:58.440]  a call from one of the staffers who's running the hearing asking about the lawsuit and there's
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:03.640]  a lawsuit right now, Epic versus the TSA. I'm one of the plaintiffs and we're trying
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:09.000]  to get the TSA to follow the law with respect to full body scanners has to do with a public
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.080]  common period and certain documents. They have to make public. I mean, this is law and
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:18.040]  we're just trying to get the TSA to follow it. Anyway, the TSA objected and the excuse
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:23.400]  they use that it wouldn't be appropriate for us to be sitting at the same table because
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:29.200]  I'm a part of that lawsuit. I mean, that doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but in any case,
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:34.400]  the people who ran the hearing decided that they wanted the TSA there, which means I was
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:39.840]  uninvited, which is really a pity because I would have liked to have been at the table
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:45.240]  of the TSA. I spent a lot of time criticizing them and they have a luxury of not actually
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:49.440]  responding. I mean, they could ignore me. They could respond to pieces of me, but it
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:53.840]  would have been neat to be at a table and say, Hey, answer this question. And then if
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:58.120]  they didn't say you didn't answer the question and try again, I mean, that would have been
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:05.000]  sort of fun, but I didn't get to do that. Now, they're also famous, as you know, for
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.160]  claiming John Hopkins says there's no radiation danger. And then the head of the radiology
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:14.600]  department goes, we'd ever said that in our report. We said the opposite or they're famous
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:19.920]  for saying we've done all the radiology testing. We've got, you know, uh, radiation officers
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:23.480]  are supposed to wear a badge like it's my dental office or doctor's office. Turn out
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:28.080]  that was a lie. They said they'd given Congress years ago the data. That was a lie. They said
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:33.000]  they didn't save the images. That was a lie. They said that they weren't groping people.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:39.040]  I weren't strip searching old ladies. That was a lie. I mean, this is the only group
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:47.200]  I know of it's rumored to lie more than the TSA is the devil. The problem is that airports
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:52.160]  are really extra constitutional zones now. There are things that happen there that that
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:56.680]  would never happen out in the real world. And you know, this is just one example is
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:01.680]  a lot of dispute about the radiation levels. There are some people that do the math and
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:07.960]  say it's okay, but that math doesn't doesn't take into account that this is all skin radiation.
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:12.920]  Once you look at that, it's not okay. The problem is we don't have the data. I mean,
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:19.560]  this isn't security data. This isn't how well the machines work to detect plastic explosives.
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:23.200]  This is safety data. And they never released it. That's a good point you're making. So,
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.960]  so, so what were you going to testify to they blocked? If you put this exact machine in
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:34.200]  a hospital, it would be illegal because we just don't know how safe they are. So, you
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:39.480]  know, in some ways, in this instance, I just want the TSA to do something perfectly reasonable
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:46.760]  and release safety data, allow researchers to test them for safety before we start irradiating,
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:52.880]  you know, millions of Americans. It just seems plausible to ask. And you know, in like so
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:58.600]  many things were blocked. The TSA is required by law to ask for a public comment period
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:02.960]  before deploying this technology. They didn't. We went to the courts. The court said you
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:08.040]  have to do that. They haven't. Now, then, you know, just one of many things that once
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:12.120]  you get to the airport, you just don't have the rights you have as a citizen elsewhere
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:17.360]  in the country. And now they're they're setting the precedent with that to expand it TSA hardened
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:22.760]  bulletproof checkpoints, highway checkpoints, bus terminals, train stations. Now they're
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:26.760]  seeing the IRS will be over. And if you haven't paid your taxes, you won't be able to travel.
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:32.160]  This is the internal checkpoint passport that was, of course, was so famous in Nazi Germany
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:37.880]  and Stalinist Russia. I mean, it's like they're following up an authoritarian list and checking
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:43.240]  each box off twice and, you know, taking it to the next level. Again, what were you going
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:48.080]  to say to Congress specifically, sir? Because I want people to hear that testimony.
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:54.080]  Oh, wow. I mean, you know, what I was hoping to do is go after them and respond to them
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:57.480]  because, you know, as you're pointing out, they say a lot of things that turn out not
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:02.920]  to be true. And what I was hoping to do there is to be the fact checker that I wouldn't
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:08.600]  have stuff prepared necessarily that I would more respond when they say, you know, the
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:13.200]  radiation is safe. I'd be able to say, well, you know, you say that, but here's some data
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:18.040]  and you're not letting us letting us know when they say the full body scanners detect
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:22.040]  plastic explosives. I'd say, well, no, they don't. Here's the data. The manufacturers
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:26.760]  say they don't. We know they don't. I mean, you just you're lying there. And you know,
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:33.160]  and that's really what I wanted to do, whether talking about the no fly list or the shoe
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:37.880]  scanners. I mean, all of these things they do and they make the statements and they
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:42.600]  don't get a lot of checks on it. So I was hoping to be the fact checker. That's why I thought
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:47.280]  it would be fun because rarely do I get to actually confront them. I mean, I can say
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:51.840]  my pieces. I can make my arguments, but they don't have to respond. And I figured with
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:57.080]  con congressmen staring at them in the face, you know, we might be able to get an actual
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:58.080]  response.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:02.640]  Well, I mean, the TSA is being called before Congress to be grilled because the nations
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:09.640]  in near revolt over their legendary abusive exploits. And then you're one of the known
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:16.160]  admitted experts, you know, coming in to counter them and then they complain. What was the
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:22.160]  nature of the complaint where our godlike TSA, Trump's open discussion?
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:28.000]  So this is a technicality and it might be valid for all I know. There's a lawsuit going
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.840]  on. Epic Electronic Privacy Information Center versus the TSA about full body scanners.
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:38.720]  I'm one of the name plaintiff. And what they invoked, and this might be a rule for all
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:47.720]  I know, that both sides of an ongoing legal dispute should not appear at the same table
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:52.760]  in front of a congressional hearing. So, I mean, I don't know if this is a real rule.
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:58.200]  It might be. You know, honestly, if I knew that, I might have dropped off the lawsuit
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:02.920]  and showed up at the hearing because the hearing would have been more fun.
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:09.040]  Specifically, though, I mean, you're a technology expert. You've got a long bio here. Tell folks
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:14.120]  about your website and why you were being, why members of Congress thought you'd be
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:18.000]  a good person, you know, to call because the economist calls you a security guru.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:25.800]  Sure. I mean, I write about the TSA all the time. My website is schnire.com, S-C-H-N-E-I-E-R.
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:31.480]  At the same time this was unfolding, I was participating in an online debate at the Economist
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:37.320]  Magazine website with Kip Hawley. Kip Hawley is the former head of the TSA from its inception
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:42.400]  to basically when Obama became president. And he and I were going back and forth on
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:47.000]  the TSA, and it's a fantastic debate. I really recommend people read it. I thought I did
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  a great job.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.160]  So, you're an effective nemesis to the pervert squad, and so they just don't want you on
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:54.160]  the field.
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:59.880]  Now, I don't think they do. I'm actually pretty good. I could talk about the scanners. I can
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:07.440]  talk about the X-ray machines. I can talk about the scanning of check luggage of cockpit
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:09.400]  doors. I can talk about their spot programs.
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:12.920]  Yeah, do that. I mean, talk about why you say it's all security because you coined the
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:15.240]  term security theater.
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:20.560]  That's my term. And that's what we got a lot of here, things that look good but don't
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:25.920]  actually provide security. It's interesting. For that economist debate, I pulled some research
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:30.600]  that was done on the cost of the TSA because, you know, we never really look at it in terms
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:34.680]  of cost versus benefit. Is it worth it?
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:40.520]  And if you calculate the amount of waiting time for people flying, it's about 19 and
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:46.040]  a half minutes per flyer. I mean, that's the time you get to the airport early, on average.
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:51.960]  You run the math. That's about $10 billion a year that equals TSA's budget. If you look
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:45:00.680]  at the number of people who drive instead of flying to avoid the TSA, that equals about
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.480]  500 automobile related deaths per year.
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:05.480]  Wow.
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:14.320]  Right. So we're saying that the TSA is causing 500 fatal accidents a year. Now, that's a
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:20.120]  big number. I mean, you know, that makes them, you know, I'm sorry to say, more effective
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:25.800]  than the terrorists. And talking about that would have been interesting. Now, you know,
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:30.880]  they didn't cause the deaths in the same way the terrorists do, but it's not as scary.
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:35.240]  It's not as fun to get scared of that, but I've talked to bus company people. I know
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:40.000]  a side issue. The point is they say that buses are being used a lot more everywhere I go
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.160]  now. I'm seeing a lot more buses and everyone I talk to doesn't travel. They talk about
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:50.520]  upwards of $40 billion a year now in lost revenue. Friends I have in Europe won't come
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:56.120]  here now. I mean, this is a big deal. I mean, we're known. Communist China isn't anywhere
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:00.760]  near this. It's easier to fly into North Korea than it is the U.S. now.
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:03.960]  Oh, actually, it's not. And China is pretty bad.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:08.400]  Hold on. I'm sure you've been to China. I have it. Paul Watson's married to a nice
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:12.560]  Chinese lady and he flies to China two or three times a year. He says there's basically
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:16.720]  no security. And I've talked to journalists that recently flew to North Korea and they
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:21.280]  said basically as long as it's pre-authorized, they were just right in. And then once you
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:25.240]  go out in the countryside, they had a minder. But I'm talking about, I mean, in North Korea,
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:26.640]  they don't grab your genitals.
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:31.480]  Well, you know, I'd love to visit that country. I haven't. China I have and I've been to
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:36.480]  Russia in another month. We'll see how security there. I just came back from Europe. You know,
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:39.520]  they do a lot of security too. I mean, in a lot of ways.
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:44.560]  Oh, no, no, no. I mean, the Netherlands has it. England has more than the U.S. and some.
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:48.480]  The point is that we're losing. All I know is we're losing tourism.
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:52.440]  Yeah, and we are. A lot of people don't fly. I mean, one thing you said is that people
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:58.280]  are up in arms over this. The thing, unfortunately, you have to realize is most people aren't.
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:03.640]  Most people don't know better. They'll say something like anything if it keeps us safer.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:09.200]  Most people believe the government when they say this is essential. I mean, I wish there
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:17.160]  was a popular revolt over the TSA, but now those of us who object are still pretty fringy.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:22.040]  Most people just say, I guess this is what we have to do. You know, and one of the things
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:28.080]  I like to do with my writings is to raise awareness that maybe this isn't the best way, that
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:31.720]  maybe this isn't the right thing. But, you know, in a lot of ways, I'm still fighting
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:38.600]  it uphill battle because most people don't know enough to decide and trust the government.
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:42.640]  You know, most people I talked to absolutely hate what the TSA is doing, and I talked to
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:47.800]  one of my friends that works at the airport, and he said he watched local News 8 Austin
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:54.280]  interview more than 40 people until they found one old lady that liked what they were doing
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:56.920]  to her and they put her on the news.
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:02.080]  Yeah, I mean, I think there is some of that. I mean, certainly, you know, my friends, your
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:05.920]  friends are going to select this way. You know, a lot of people are outspoken where
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:09.720]  they don't like it, but they're willing to accept it. But, you know, go to the airport.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:13.960]  I fly all the time, and, you know, people aren't complaining. Now, of course, you know
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:18.440]  not to complain, right? Because if you complain, you're a troublemaker and you could end up
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:25.440]  on a list. Now, it really is a bad situation. You know, we just don't have the rights to
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:30.120]  argue, and I think people are afraid to argue. I mean, the people who don't like it are
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:35.720]  willing to accept it. You know, I'll complain more than most, but I know if I put up a stink
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:38.680]  at the airport, this is going to make my day miserable.
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:44.360]  Did you know the TSA asked for them to remove that other technologist video what a month
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:50.240]  or so ago we had him on where he showed how you could sneak through the scanners with explosives
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:55.840]  and then they removed it saying security. No, the security is showing their fraud, right?
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:59.880]  Yeah, and that actually isn't even new. You know, when I blogged about that, I found a
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:03.840]  research paper from two years previously that talked about the same attack. I mean, it's
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:08.000]  not like hiding it is going to make it go away. I didn't know the video was removed.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:13.120]  That's interesting. I'm pretty sure it's up in Europe somewhere. I'll go back to, I'll
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:17.600]  go back and look around and update my blog. If they took it down for a while, that was
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:21.480]  a big outrage. And then it was put back up. The point is, is that they did take it down
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:25.600]  for a while or so. So you read it to your listeners who don't know, this is a video
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:29.720]  of someone bringing metal through a full body scanner through both of them through both
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:34.640]  the other backscatter X-ray and through the millimeter wave. And basically he's hiding
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:40.880]  it in an outside pocket of a, of a sort of a swingy piece of clothing. And the way the
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:47.960]  images show up, it's, it's hidden in the background. It actually is a serious flaw. It's pretty
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:54.840]  easy to, to bypass. It's been known for a few years. And yes, the TSA is trying to hide
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:50:00.480]  information about it. The, the researcher who found this reported that the TSA was threatening
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:05.360]  reporters who were covering this. Oh yeah. In fact, I saw the emails and then he later
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:10.440]  actually talked to the, was the TV reporter in Florida. They told him, we tell you do
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:12.480]  not talk to this guy.
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:17.440]  Well, I mean, these are some more heavy handed tactics. But again, the way to think of airport
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:26.440]  security, the TSA is that as an extra constitutional, uh, organ, I mean, extra constitutional space
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:30.400]  organization that the normal rights you have, you know, don't exist.
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:35.080]  Like a constitution free zone. We've got one more short segment with you. I want to specifically
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:41.220]  get into the, you know, the scanners and other areas and the X-rays, the bomb detectors.
[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:46.480]  Because from what I've read, but you know more about this than I do, a good dog detects
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:54.080]  explosives on a wider range, much better than those machines. And they can do it to everybody.
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:51:01.040]  But a dog isn't proprietary to a company that gives lobbying money to Congress.
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:06.080]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:10.680]  good sized meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well known fact
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:14.880]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the

[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:50.640]  We're trying to detect an explosive called PETN. It's got a long name, you can look
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:56.200]  it up, it's what the shoe bomber used, it's what the underwear bomber used, it's the thing
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:00.920]  that's scary. And we're worried about people bringing it in on their person because the
[01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:08.320]  magnetometer won't detect it. Now, full body scanners actually won't detect PETN either.
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:13.680]  Only two things can detect it and that's a chemical sniffer or as you say a dog. So
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:19.080]  what we're trying to do with the full body scanners is to detect bulges in your clothing
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:24.840]  that could be PETN and if one is found then the officer will figure out what it is. So
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:30.800]  that's basically what the machines are doing. So yes, dogs would be better but if you think
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:35.520]  about it, dogs are kind of a logistical nightmare at an airport. I don't think it's a fact that
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:41.240]  the machines that are proprietary and dogs aren't. It's just that having trained animals
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:45.280]  requires a level of infrastructure that airports don't have.
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:49.080]  But I would rather walk by a dog and that's all you got to do than have somebody grab
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:50.080]  my genitals.
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:54.640]  Well, you know, it's not all you have to do. It's more complicated than that. I'm not
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:59.520]  convinced that dogs are a better solution than the machines. I think when we start looking
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:05.240]  at making dogs work, there's a lot of issues. But yeah, the machines don't actually detect
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:10.920]  the explosive. They detect bulges in your clothing which then the officer clears. And
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:14.520]  if you go to the airport and know this happens, then they see a bulge and the person who's
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:18.600]  looking at the images, radios to the officer says there's something in his left pocket.
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:22.440]  And the person looking at your genitals sees something that they want to look at, yeah.
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:27.840]  Right. And then so that is clear. So yeah, so that's basically how those machines work.
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:31.840]  I mean, I'd love to see more dogs. I think they're a great solution. I even saw some
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:38.840]  technology that uses bees as a different animal. Now, I don't think they work with a person
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:44.480]  but they work with luggage and other things that bees can also act as good chemical detectors.
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:49.560]  But there's a lot of work with using live animals, especially large. And Chertoff doesn't
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:54.120]  make money off the body scanners. And that's the other issue of course. There is Michael
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:59.080]  Chertoff, lobbyist, one of the two machines authorized to sell them. And you know, the
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:04.240]  rush to put them into place after the underwear bomber, even though the manufacturer of one
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:07.240]  of them, at least one of them has said, you know, wait a second, this wouldn't have detected
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:10.760]  the underwear bomb. Because remember, if it's not a bulge, you're not going to detect it.
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:15.520]  So if it's pounded, the flash flow is pounded thin. It's part of an article of clothing.
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:17.560]  There's a lot of ways to sneak it by.
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:21.920]  Well, what have you had inside your body? I mean, next they're saying they're talking
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:26.400]  about full body x-rays. I saw that in the Australian news because people might put it
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:29.720]  in artificial breasts. They might put it in their stomach.
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:36.320]  Or put it in your anus. We saw one example of that. Someone who set off a bomb against
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:42.280]  the Saudi prince a couple of years ago hid the, hid the bomb in his anal body cavity.
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:47.080]  So yes, I mean, this is a tactic. It's, you know, kind of an obvious one.
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:51.640]  Well, the answers have the potbellied TSA people get grandma in there and do proctology
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:52.640]  exams.
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:58.960]  Well, you know, I mean, this, this seems like an endless, a futile solution. I mean, I
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:03.360]  mean, how about we just face the danger like we always did and live in a free society?
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:07.480]  Okay. I, I mean, if they had a plane with no security versus security, I'm getting on
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:09.680]  the one with no security.
[01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:14.560]  You know, but unfortunately the market doesn't ever, I mean, market rarely differentiates
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:18.320]  on security. Yeah, I want to be, it would be interesting to have more secure airways
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:20.160]  and less secure airways.
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:24.160]  The truth is they can't protect you. The world's on it. What terrorists are going to attack
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:28.080]  down the road? We're going to have checkpoints on the road now. I mean, it's never ending.
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:31.480]  Of course, and we're all off. He did dine secretly at the Pentagon too. And then where
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:36.000]  bomber was put on the plane by the U S government, Bruce, thanks for the time. Thanks for joining
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.480]  us. And I'm glad you got to testify here.

[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:54.920]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non hybrid
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:59.760]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:03.560]  non hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true. Seeds have
[01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:07.080]  all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:11.600]  even happen again. So our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect
[01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:17.800]  mix of non hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:22.360]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:26.480]  not been genetically modified in any way. And you actually get enough seeds to plant
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:33.840]  a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com
[01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:45.160]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:53.800]  non hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:28.360]  try to give each person a minute and a half. I'll go to the next person, which we'll probably
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:31.720]  fail at, but we'll try. And I've got a ton of news I haven't gotten to. We'll cover
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:37.680]  it all coming up. Big Developments at infowars.com and prismplotted.com right now. Robert in
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:42.040]  Texas. And we'll go to Jonathan, Carl, Michael, Otter, and others. Robert, you're on the
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:43.040]  air. Go ahead.
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:51.480]  Thanks for having me on, Alex. Two quick points. The first, I refer to it as the brain drain
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:01:03.120]  mainframe. And that's what I call the establishment in their media arm. And if people want to
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:11.280]  take the time, we have a few new videos up where we call in for Ron Paul to major shows.
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:18.680]  We got Ed Schultz most recently and Dennis Miller. And we call them Ron Calls. We try
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:23.880]  to do them every Friday. You can check those videos out at Funkmaster 5 YouTube channel.
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:26.040]  And other than that, that's pretty much all I have.
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:31.600]  Good job, brother. Keep doing your work. Jonathan in Kansas, you're on the air.
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:35.720]  Yeah. How's it going, Howard? Good.
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:50.720]  I have some interesting news. One concerning 9-11 and let's see. Yeah, 9-11. First one
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:02:01.600]  is about how is it a new renovation, excuse me, well, new news about how another intelligence
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:09.840]  failure before 9-11. And apparently it's about how U.S. acted to conceal evidence of intelligence
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:14.160]  failure before 9-11. It just came out March 27.
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:19.080]  Yeah, I saw that. A lot of those are just regurgitated, though. Again, they lied and
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:23.480]  said they never heard of a plan to fly planes in the buildings. The FBI was trying to stop
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:27.720]  those people who were part of the drills and were told to shut up in four states, no five
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:34.680]  states, Oklahoma too. All of that went on. They ordered NORAD to stand down. I mean,
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:41.480]  it just goes on and on. Some of the hijackers trained at U.S. military bases, that was confirmed.
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:45.800]  It just never got followed up on. Now, I saw one of those last week. What particularly
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:49.480]  is the new one you're talking about? 9-11 intelligence failure. What's the newest?
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:54.240]  Well, that was the one that came out March 27. It may be the same one you were talking
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:03:00.320]  about. It was basically how they didn't allow, well, whatever, wire tie. But I have mixed
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:08.240]  emotions on it because, one, it may be let out just for the fact of saying that, oh,
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:13.520]  you can't, we can't protect you unless we wiretap. Basically, it said that because they
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:18.840]  were blocked from wiretapping at Afghanistan. And it only let to...
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:22.440]  Yeah, no, I saw that one. That's exactly, that's to make it look like, oh, they did
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:27.200]  screw up. They need the NSA to record everything you're doing, which they're already doing.
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:31.840]  That's what came out on 9-11. They had all the NSA communicates and ignored them. In
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:42.400]  fact, 9-11 intelligence, 9-11 NSA intelligence was ignored. Tie that in. You know, NSA, 9-11
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:46.280]  attack data ignored. That was in congressional hearings. So, yes, I did see that a few weeks
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:50.960]  ago where they're like, oh, we weren't able to spy on people. So this happened. Total
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:59.920]  red herring, total baloney on its face. As we know from Sybil Edmund's NSA translator
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:05.360]  with the FBI, as we know from Colonel Schaefer, they knew everything. They had him in their
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:12.880]  sights. They knew all of it. And in Sybil Edmund's words, she heard the CIA commanding
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:20.120]  al-Qaeda on 9-11. She told Congress that they have not denied that. So, I mean, again, just
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:26.960]  like they command al-Qaeda in Syria, just like they command al-Qaeda in Libya, just like
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:31.400]  they command al-Qaeda against the Russians, this is a fact.
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:39.240]  Anything else, sir? Yeah, I have a new video about eugenics and
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:45.040]  about how 300,000 women in Peru were forcibly sterilized. Oh, yeah. What's the name of the
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:53.360]  video? The name of the video is More Than 300 Women in Peru. Peru, the country of Peru,
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:57.080]  forcibly sterilized. Yeah, that's on record. Exactly. They only mentioned a few hundred
[02:04:57.080 --> 02:05:01.120]  when it was just massive numbers.
[02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:05.360]  Right now, the average family spends one fourth of their income on food. It's time to cut

[02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:12.800]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:21.800]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They're
[02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:31.560]  so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset
[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:40.000]  in the crotch, where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:46.800]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:00.520]  others don't.
[02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:05.560]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:10.240]  good size meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:14.440]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:19.840]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:24.920]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and
[02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:25.920]  be healthy.
[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:30.800]  You've searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there, and discovered

[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I've got two short videos, one I shot yesterday,
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:39.480]  the other I shot during a break, and they both illustrate something very important.
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:45.960]  That's coming up, audio for radio listeners, video for prisonplanet.tv viewers. One involves
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:51.080]  the French Bulldog, and then got some bad news for you, but it's not bad news. We knew
[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:55.520]  they'd come back at us again, we got to fight them again. It's an eternal battle. Secret
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:09:01.640]  plan underway to revive Internet censorship bill SOPA, Motion Picture Association of America's
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:07.320]  CEO, confident similar legislation will become law. It ends due process, let's shut down
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:14.720]  any website they want, extra judicially. Very serious, very serious news, and I do want
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:17.840]  to spend some time on this Trayvon Martin thing. I've known this for a couple weeks,
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:23.920]  but now it's finally getting some attention, which is good, because I was reading the transcripts
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:30.960]  of what NBC did, which is an organ of the Winehouse, where they edited, and we've played
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:36.640]  this before, but I mean, it's just incredible, and folks said it sounded like it was edited,
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:43.280]  and it was. This is the raw 911 call. Zimmerman, this guy looks like he's up to no good, or
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:50.880]  he's on drugs or something. It's raining, and he's just walking around looking about
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:56.640]  the Spatcher, okay, and this guy, is he black? Why are we spanning? Zimmerman, he looks black.
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:02.920]  The altered NBC news version simply ran this way. Zimmerman, this guy looks like he's up
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:08.640]  to no good. He looks black. They edited it together. This is the system wanting to get
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:14.320]  everybody fighting with each other. That is the plan. Well, the big megabanks, Rob America,
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:18.800]  shut down our industry. The IRS says they're going to ban travel if you haven't paid them
[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:23.720]  whenever they want. No due process. All this is happening. Classic police state, and they're
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:29.120]  trying to hype up every event. When there's tragedies every day in this country, and a
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:35.160]  lot of it racial, why are they hyping this? Because it's at this time. Like reportedly
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:41.640]  in Austin yesterday, an Asian man shot a police officer. Didn't appear to be racially motivated.
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:46.320]  He was just out of his mind in a Walmart, shot the guy, the police officer, and killed
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:51.640]  him for no reason. That's why we've got guns to protect ourselves from people like that.
[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:58.240]  I mean, it's you're never going to stop crazy people. In Japan, they've had people with
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:03.000]  knives going to grocery stores and stab 20, 30 people. And you know, these are pretty
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:08.280]  serious topics here, but it's got to be discussed. Let's go back to your phone calls. Michelle
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:13.320]  or is that Michael? It's so far away. It's Michael. Michael in Virginia. You're on the
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:23.360]  air. Go ahead. Michael, go ahead. Okay, he's gone. Let's go to Carl in Oregon. Carl, you're
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:24.360]  on the air.
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:31.760]  Hello, my fellow Patriot. Hey, buddy. Got two questions and a statement. I'm going to do
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:35.640]  them in 10 seconds. Go ahead.
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:40.240]  We have Fritz Springmeyer here, where I live. So when are you perhaps thinking about having
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:43.480]  a speaking, a special speaking engagement up here in the Northwest? This is the first
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:49.480]  question. The second one, I can't find out where the Jesse Ventura's two TVs, the special
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:54.600]  conspiracy theory, when is that airing? That's my two questions for you. My statement is,
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:59.360]  well, you say the globalists make you sick. You're sick of it. So I'm sick of it too,
[02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:03.280]  but it doesn't make me nauseous. It makes me want to take a bunch of sleeping pills,
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:08.480]  drink a 12 pack of beer, and just go to sleep. That's my sentiment on that. I mean, I won't
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:10.200]  do that, but that's what it makes me feel like.
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:16.120]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, never hurt yourself. No, we're beating these people at
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:20.160]  many levels. I get angry that more people won't wake up when it's so obvious and take
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:27.240]  action because I'm chomping at the bit. I'm salivating like a dog barking at a fence when
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:32.160]  somebody's messing with me. I mean, I want to route these people and it doesn't mean
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:35.600]  the world will ever be a perfect place. It just means we've got to get the pendulum going
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:39.640]  in the other direction. We're so close to that. So the system's pulling out all the
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:44.920]  stops. There is a major war going on right now at the greatest pitch ever for the human
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:50.320]  destiny of our society. I mean, it's all happening right now. I appreciate your call
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:52.320]  and the questions.
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:57.280]  As for the speaking engagement, I said that I was going to a beta test speaking in Dallas
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:03.000]  in Orlando only, and that that was my speaking term. Then they put out some disinformation
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:06.280]  thing that I'd canceled my speaking term. Everybody's calling me going, finish your
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:11.760]  speaking term. Why aren't you? I always said it was two locations and in the summer I might
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:17.000]  try a bigger one where I went to five or six locations. And I certainly enjoy meeting people
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:20.440]  and doing it because of the technology we're working on. I'm able to do the show on the
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:27.200]  road or at affiliates. So there is no new tour announced. I've got to check with affiliates.
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:33.320]  I've got to set it all up. I've got to go do it is a lot of infrastructure. The only
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:38.280]  way I won't go on this summer tour is if all Hades breaks loose and they're now having
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:45.600]  the aircraft carriers leave the Persian Gulf. And the word is for now the Iran Wars off
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:50.120]  deals have been made. Israel has said they're cutting back special forces attack. They're
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:55.920]  launching. Yeah, war. It's been ongoing inside Iran. So some behind the scenes deals have
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:14:02.480]  been made. And that is a good thing. Let me tell you because, you know, cooler heads can
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:08.800]  prevail in this. So barring a war or something. I am planning some type of trip and we were
[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:13.920]  looking at going out to California and up into Oregon and then going back down through
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:18.840]  into Colorado and back to Texas. I just don't know if I have time because I just cannot
[02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:25.240]  do the radio show and then drive from, you know, in the afternoon all the way through
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:33.080]  to midnight every night and do that. It's just not safe. We have to drive fast. And
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:36.960]  I certainly can't take my family if I do that. And that's the whole point is reach out to
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:41.120]  the public, go out into America while we still can before the domestic checkpoints are set
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:46.320]  up pretty soon. They're just going to say no drive list. You can't leave this area.
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:51.120]  It's going to be linked to your ID that they've said this. And if you leave the city, you're
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:55.760]  going to be arrested and permanently detained. And that's what this IRS domestic checkpoint
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:59.320]  thing is in the hardened bullet. Folks, you think I'm joking? It's all going to happen.
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:02.760]  Okay. I told you they'd be doing all the stuff they are now doing. I'm telling you the next
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:11.560]  phase. Well, been telling you for years. It's maximum tyranny. Where will they stop? Never.
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:16.680]  Well, we stop them. I mean, it's, it's, it's outrageous. But so are all the other tyrannies
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:21.600]  we've seen in history. It's like, how do the people let them do that by increment and through
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:26.960]  fear and through wars and through crises? Let's go ahead and go to Otter and Mass. Otter,
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:33.400]  you're on the air. Go ahead, you're there. Yes, sir. Greetings. Hi. Thank you. Thank
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:50.360]  you. Wordpress, etc. So regarding positivity as power. Yes, sir. You should wear a jumpsuit
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:57.440]  on one of the shows at some time with an orange jumpsuit with a PPTV initials rather than
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:07.000]  a DOC or other initials used by the present system. That's a great idea. In fact, I meant
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  to do that in the past, not with that on it, but, but I have meant to do a piece with myself
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.600]  in a Gitmo orange jumpsuit. Will somebody get me a large orange jumpsuit please? No
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:25.120]  longer extra large, large jumpsuit? Yeah, we'll definitely do that, sir. You're still
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:33.200]  there? Yes, sir. All right. Well, I'm seeing and I'm a healer. You know that you're showing
[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:40.800]  physical symptoms of heart issues. And I believe that you should probably because he is so
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:49.840]  good. Definitely has the level of intellect, the genius that you have trade off with Aaron
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:57.560]  on the nightly news to give yourself some time because times passing and you're missing
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:17:03.920]  the growth of your children and the awareness of the quickening the and it's only been the
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:12.280]  last year plus, you know, I've talked to you since last summer. It seems to me that you're
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:20.360]  missing out on one of the best things of life. And that is your family. I just hope that
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:27.880]  we can keep the words up. They are continually. Hold on. I mean, I know you've called in nice
[02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:32.480]  guy. You say your Native American guy. It's not like a smart person. I'm showing signs
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:37.680]  of heart problems. I've lost 40 pounds. I can have people run all the time. Marathoners
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:43.120]  drop dead, but I can run like eight miles, which is a lot for a big old fatty like me.
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:47.360]  I mean, I'm trying to get skinny. My heart feels super good. Well, you think I have signs
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:58.320]  of heart problems? The bags under the eyes. It is symptomatic. I'm a healer. Well, listen,
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:03.080]  it also might be symptomatic as I ever told people stories about growing up in Dallas.
[02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:09.360]  People wouldn't believe it. My eyes have both been blacked probably 20 times a piece. So
[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:15.440]  I've had, I'm just been beat up, sir. I've even got some cauliflowering in one of my
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:20.920]  ears. So I mean, I understand it is not a good sign to have, I guess, swollen ankles
[02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:24.760]  or bags under my eyes. That is a sign of heart problems. You're right. But I don't have swollen
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:31.560]  ankles. I've just, I've just, especially this eye is my right eye is permanently black.
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:37.320]  See, that's from, I mean, it's been, you know, you get in a fight, your eyes pure red for
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:41.960]  two weeks, you know, just bloody. I mean, that's why my, I mean, that's why I have black circles
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:47.080]  under my eyes. Can't get rid of them. All the blood vessels have been smashed and they're
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:53.480]  over and over again. Yes. Well, you were an athlete. Not really an athlete. I was in a
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:19:00.080]  few sports, but I've been beat up pretty bad. I've been beat up by that. Who knows though,
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:03.600]  whoever. I hear you. I should take off more time. You know why? Because when I do take
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:07.920]  off, I'm more focused. It's more powerful. But I am doing the nightly news three nights
[02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:10.640]  a week, which was always my plan. And the other guys are doing it the other two nights
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:16.600]  a week. I'm developing more folks here. And I am doing a lot more. God bless you, Otter.
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:18.880]  I appreciate your call.
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:25.280]  Enough about me though. Enough about me. I mean, I didn't work out this morning. I am
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:32.960]  planning to work out sometime today. Let's go ahead and go to the anger is an issue though.
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:41.160]  I mean, I, I, it's true. I need to get control of it. But at the same time, whatever, whatever,
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:44.560]  I'm not going to worry about it because I mean, it's not an act up here when I start
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:47.960]  yelling. It's screaming folks. I mean, I'm sick of this. I every day I look at these
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:55.840]  scumbags and I see what they're doing to us. And I just want to stop Michael James,
[02:19:55.840 --> 02:20:01.160]  Skeletor, Scarlett, your calls are all coming up. Stay with us. And we got those videos.
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:07.080]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis. Everyone can feel it.
[02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:12.680]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those
[02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:19.760]  who love darkness, bondage and enslavement. Yes, my friends, evil is rising. But take
[02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:25.520]  heart for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Recently, New World Order
[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:30.880]  operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war. We are in an information
[02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:37.160]  war and we are losing that war. The globalist are scared. They've overreached. The future

[02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:05.040]  high gear. We all know the importance of having storable foods. But what about when the food
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:08.040]  runs out? What then?

[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:37.800]  Well, a Navy jet crashed into some apartments and so I guess now that there's been a wreck,
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:42.760]  we have to ban Navy jets because that's the idea they use with terrorists because terrorists
[02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:47.280]  might attack us. We've got to take everybody's rights because a Navy jet crashed into apartments
[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:56.080]  in Virginia and we'll give you more details on that coming up. At least two people were
[02:24:56.080 --> 02:25:00.320]  hurt. A hospital spokesman said good news that nobody was killed so far. We're not
[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:04.840]  sure if there have been any deaths but it looks like there hasn't been and it says the
[02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:15.440]  two plane members were able to eject. Volunteer rescue squad said he and others found one of
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:20.720]  the two plane crew members who ejected so we don't even know if the other guy got out.
[02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:27.440]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Michael in Texas. Thanks for holding Michael. Go ahead.
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:33.000]  Good Friday, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. I've heard you many times on your radio show
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  talk about how frustrated you are that the headlines aren't getting out to the general
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:44.040]  public and I just kind of had this idea. If all the InfoWars who are strong would hit
[02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:49.320]  the street corners and let our presence be seen and we can get some strength to those
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:55.240]  who are weak. Exactly. Look, Ron Paul was cheated. He was winning in the first few
[02:25:55.240 --> 02:26:00.480]  states after they cheated him. I told people that folks would then say, oh, we can't win.
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:03.720]  It would shift to Romney. That's always been what they plan. People say, well, then why
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:08.440]  do you support Ron Paul? Because he was able to inject real issues. Now we've got to take
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:14.000]  that whole Ron Paul movement and put it into fighting the InfoWars. And I think promoting
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:19.480]  InfoWars is one of the best places to go with the articles, the documents, the info or whatever.
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:25.440]  Start your own organization. Just educate people about the globalist and little things,
[02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:31.160]  all of us doing it together, it will move mountains. I mean, what are some of the ideas
[02:26:31.160 --> 02:26:38.320]  you have? Just writing websites on money. So many people tell me they found InfoWars.com
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:42.800]  and they found about the New World Order and then met their wife because of it. The story
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:50.760]  goes on and on from things being written on money or people giving them a CD or a DVD.
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:59.400]  I mean, the power of that is incredible. Can I say something? Yes, sir. Go ahead. Here's
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:02.760]  a couple of my ideas. You know, we hit the street corners with poster boards, with the
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:06.040]  headlines from the InfoWars, you know, the headlines that the mainstream media seem
[02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:11.240]  to lose or to stop lights. That way the people have time to read the headlines. You want
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:15.440]  to put a date line on there so they'll be able to reference it. And at the bottom of
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:21.640]  your signs, put InfoWars.com so they'll know where to go to get that news. And also, I
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:27.960]  mean, what I'm doing is I've got me some signs. I've got one that's street news. Headlines
[02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:35.040]  that the mainstream seem to lose. One of the articles could be like MF Global, CEO John
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:40.680]  Corzine steals 2B and private accounts, no prosecution. You know, at the bottom, InfoWars.com,
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:45.240]  you can go down and take any of the headlines from, you know, four or five months back,
[02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:49.800]  just date lines so that people can reference them when they go to InfoWars.com. And even
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:55.320]  have a sign that says InfoWars.net on the news at PrisonPlanet.tv. You know, with this
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:27:58.600]  stuff out on the street corners, you know, making our presence be seen, that'll bring
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:03.080]  the week out. They'll soon join us. And the people who live in the little towns near
[02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:07.520]  big cities where most of the people in those little towns travel back and forth to work,
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:10.720]  get out there in the morning at one of their street lights out there on the edge of town
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:15.640]  where they have to stop long lines of them and work those lines. Get back out there on
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:17.160]  the evening when they're coming back home.
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:22.040]  Well, sure, that's what you call a banner hang. You can cheaply get a pretty good size
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:28.120]  banner and hang it across an overpass and it will reach thousands of people. Another
[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:32.360]  thing is micro FM transmitters. You can get like a one watt one. As long as you don't
[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:35.480]  announce who you are and where you're at, usually you never have any issues. If you
[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:40.080]  do it civil and then most people shut down after that and then they never have a problem.
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:49.160]  But this is a war we're in. Access TV. But what's most effective is doing one sheet printoffs
[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:54.640]  on your computer with just headlines and websites or business cards and sticking them in the
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:29:00.640]  free magazines and newspapers that they put out at the Walmarts and they put out at the
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:07.800]  gas stations. You just go and shove your stuff inside of them on the first page. And that
[02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:13.200]  is a very effective way. And look, the buzz of liberty is already off the charts and as
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:19.320]  the global is scared. And if they start shutting the web down, arresting people, folks will
[02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:26.000]  even look that much more for things. So beautiful what you're doing. God bless you, sir. Anything
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  else?
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:33.480]  Yes. You know, with all that said, I'd like to, I've got my feelings about where we stand
[02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:38.880]  in this info war. I believe we're on the brink of critical mass. I mean, we're on the brink.
[02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:40.320]  We'll just get out there and push, right?
[02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:44.760]  I agree with you. Stay there. You're right. And we have to do it alone up front. Then
[02:29:44.760 --> 02:29:50.480]  that will bring others. Build it. They will come. We'll be right back. Stay there.
[02:29:50.480 --> 02:30:01.080]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:05.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:10.040]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:10.040 --> 02:30:14.360]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:19.440]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:24.080]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:29.720]  is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:34.060]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:38.200]  of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power
[02:30:38.200 --> 02:30:42.520]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe
[02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:46.840]  in the solar power generators offered by solution from science. One of my oldest sponsors.

[02:33:13.160 --> 02:33:17.960]  It certainly is. We're talking to Michael in Texas. He's talking about critical mass.
[02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:23.120]  The globalist. I mean, I could go over Hillary Clinton's, the Big Noorzinski, the State Department,
[02:33:23.120 --> 02:33:28.040]  the Pentagon, all-banker run. This is not our government anymore. There may be good
[02:33:28.040 --> 02:33:33.280]  people in the government, but it's been taken over. The captain's a bad guy, and the captain
[02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:38.360]  is a consortium of globalists. That's what's running this. They admit they're losing the
[02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:44.760]  info war. That's the term they use now. We've played those clips here. They know that they're
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:50.720]  discredited. Zbigniew Brzezinski's new book, I actually bought it and I've now read most
[02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:56.880]  of it. He talks about the five big crises we face. The biggest one he says is the public
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:34:03.080]  no longer buys anything we say and recognizes we have the elite running things. No matter
[02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:10.080]  what they do, the same thing happens. He says, worldwide, he says, 30 years ago, I'm paraphrasing,
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:13.440]  you can read the quotes. They're online. It's also been a newspaper. Articles, what's in
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:22.600]  the book? He said, 30 years ago, it was easier to convince a million people of something
[02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:28.640]  that it would be to kill them. Now it's easier to just kill them. What he's saying is they
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:36.440]  cannot convince us anymore, and they know the process of waking up to them has happened.
[02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:41.800]  And don't get discouraged by people that just want to go get drunk or party or laugh at
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:46.320]  you when you talk about reality. Those people don't count, never would have counted. They
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:55.000]  know that it takes 5% of an irate focused group who's evil or good to take control.
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:02.120]  And folks, we got like 25, 30% that are really getting a good idea. They just are awake though.
[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:10.800]  They're not taking action. You get 20, 30% of the public to barely nudge the new order.
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:19.560]  Just going over the edge of a cliff. I mean, our audience is 3 million people a day, conservatively.
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:30.240]  If 3 million people went to infowars.com and ordered, I'm going back to our guest, and
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:36.400]  ordered for one penny, that's what the, because the shopping cart's got to have some amount
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:41.160]  of money put in and it won't work. That's just how it works. For one penny, you get 100 business
[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:46.640]  cards that say you are the resistance, and on the back, they say spread the word, infowars.com,
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:50.840]  prisonbunna.com, prisonbunna.tv, join the fight. And it's a provocative, good looking
[02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:56.320]  card. People will tend to look it up. And you get a citizen rulebook, and you get two
[02:35:56.320 --> 02:36:00.920]  bumper stickers, and the shipping's 495, and that is what the shipping cost is. So this
[02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:06.600]  is at cost. Now, if 3 million people all ordered this, we wouldn't be able to deliver them.
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:12.240]  Point is, we probably get 100 orders a day maybe for this. And it should be 1,000 a day,
[02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:15.000]  but quite frankly, we couldn't even do that. So I guess it's good that people don't take
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  action because we couldn't handle it. But we've put up stuff where you can just print
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:26.520]  up business cards yourself and give them out. Or just, you're not a graphics person, do
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:31.720]  it. I mean, I never had owned a camera. I'd never done TV. They were trying to ban guns,
[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:36.040]  restrict guns in Texas, where people under 18 couldn't touch a gun, even with their parents.
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:41.600]  I got mad. I was like 20, sort of trying to get into the media. And for a year, couldn't
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:45.760]  get on local radio, so I got an access show. And six months later, I had a radio show.
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:51.880]  And I mean, I was very embarrassing on those first shows. I turned the lights way up, didn't
[02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:55.480]  know how an iris worked, did it in the control room of access TV, because I couldn't get
[02:36:55.480 --> 02:37:00.160]  anybody to help me. It was real leftist down there, so they'd laugh at me and wouldn't
[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:03.840]  give me equipment and treated me pretty bad up front. But after I was successful, they
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:07.920]  claimed me as their own. That's how it always works. There were some friends up there. Some
[02:37:07.920 --> 02:37:12.960]  people helped me. And that's why I was mainly at first a conservative because that was already
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:17.120]  my beliefs, but it was the conservatives that would actually help me down there. I actually
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:21.920]  had liberals open the door of the control room, throw a coke against the wall. The guy
[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:27.560]  works for local newspaper now and then scream, Alex is pouring coke on the equipment. And
[02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:30.400]  they were going to kick me out. And I said, I'm going to sue you for this. I don't want
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:33.400]  to, but I'm going to have to. I know you have a surveillance camera right there. They said,
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:37.040]  let's just drop it right now. And I was like, oh, you're part of the setup. Then I learned
[02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:40.280]  there was embezzling going on and they were going to shut it all down, even though I wasn't
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:45.760]  even really doing a show there anymore. I had to sue and get a private investigator and
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:50.800]  found out indeed that they were stealing money and one of them went to prison. But the other
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:54.560]  stuff went up to the highest levels of the city. They were being paid off to shut access
[02:37:54.560 --> 02:38:00.200]  down. And so it's a side issue. I'm pontificating and have more calls and videos and audio.
[02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:09.240]  I want to go to the point is I used a used camera that I got for less than $100 and saved
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:15.760]  up my money and got like a $200 wireless mic and got my cousin to help me. And then later
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:27.040]  Mike Hansen and people and went out and did what I did and had immediate success. And
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:30.120]  you couldn't get in the edit bay up there because back then it was really busy because
[02:38:30.120 --> 02:38:35.240]  all the people were using it to produce films that never even showed on access. So all these,
[02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:39.080]  you know, Hollywood wannabe types were in there taking all the equipment and everything.
[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:45.600]  So I would go up and I had two day jobs, but I would go in and stay up all night to edit
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:50.120]  video. I'd shot on these big three quarter inch decks that were from the seventies that
[02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:56.480]  they had in there in the one room I could get into. And I would even cut audio tracks
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:00.760]  myself on an old audio machine. They had to put it in with a voiceover because I didn't
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:04.760]  know how to use the one room that had computers that were so primitive. They were always screwing
[02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:10.400]  up. So I was in there untrained doing all this and I would get no sleep, you know, half
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:14.080]  the time. I'd get like two hours sleep for I went to work, but I didn't care. That's
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:18.280]  what I did. I want to go into the whole story, but it's the classic, you know, a skinnier
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:26.240]  teeth bootstrap story because I didn't want him to enslave me. I was sick of it. I saw
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:32.520]  him barbecue folks at Waco blow up Oklahoma city. I wanted to expose them and folks, if
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:37.080]  you would just do what I've done and so many people have done it, they've said, we've used
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:41.180]  your example and they're and they're out there reaching millions of people. I mean, we've
[02:39:41.180 --> 02:39:46.880]  spawned hundreds of prominent people. A lot of them, the old parable who then turn against
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:51.040]  their father later, you know, that old thing of, of, of then wanting to attack me later
[02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:54.120]  just because they think they'll be the king of I'm gone. I don't want to be the king of
[02:39:54.120 --> 02:40:00.400]  Jack Diddly squat. Okay. I'm here just absolutely knowing I'm right with total proof that it's
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:06.640]  all off the chart, crazy land. And what the caller is saying is that if you'll just engage,
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:10.160]  we're having the reporter contest. We're going to a lot of great entries, but a lot of them
[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:14.120]  we get don't even follow the basic rules we gave and then people complain. We don't want
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:19.000]  to follow your rules. Okay. You don't want to work here. You don't want to win $10,000.
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:23.680]  You know, it's, it's just that it's such a decadent nation. People want things handed
[02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:29.720]  to them and nothing of value is ever handed to you. Anything handed to you and my experience
[02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:34.280]  will destroy you. The only thing handed to you is the gifts God gives you. And I learned
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:38.720]  that when you have gifts, a lot of people don't like you. They inherently are envious
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:42.640]  of it. Not that I have some great gifts, but people who are very good at sports, people
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:47.200]  who are beautiful, people who are great artists. I've noticed most people hate them because
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:53.800]  of their success or because of their beauty. I admire that. I don't see a guy with a totally
[02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:59.120]  gorgeous girlfriend and get mad at them like a lot of people I know do. I just am like,
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:05.280]  good for you. Wow. That must really be nice. I see people getting mad that I have such
[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:11.560]  wonderful wife and wonderful children. I mean, they get mad about it. Mad that I have beautiful
[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:18.400]  children. Mad that my, I have three children. It's all, it's like the public is caught
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:23.960]  in a delusional TV induced fantasy world. All right. I'm already digressing. Michael,
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:27.760]  finish your point about the critical mass. Well, you, you covered that pretty good, but
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:33.320]  I just like to make, make a couple of statements here. I'm so fortunate Alex to have grown
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:38.440]  up in Austin. I live out in Drippin Springs now, but to do street actions with you to
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:43.040]  march down Congress Avenue four or five years ago on Independence Day, go to the governor's
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:49.440]  mansion, uh, our two sieges on the Capitol. I mean, that was just such, you know, it's
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:54.760]  just so invigorating. And if the people would just let the spirit of you float, flow into
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:57.720]  them, that'll give them the impetus to get out there on them street corners with their
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:02.800]  signs and however they want to do it, but we need to do it. We need to push back hard.
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:09.720]  And anybody that denies that reality needs to understand this 10 years ago, 1% maybe knew
[02:42:09.720 --> 02:42:15.000]  the Federal Reserve was private. People would say that's code word for racism. Now when
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:20.400]  mainstream media comes to interview me, they can't do that anymore. We've made them a joke.
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:26.160]  We've been proven right, but it's not enough to be proven right. Now we've got to occupy
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:30.920]  the land as the Bible says, we have got to take the enemy out of the high ground they've
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:35.760]  taken. We're going to have to dig them out of their holes and we're just going to have
[02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:42.040]  to do it. I mean, look, ladies and gentlemen, I can't tell you the Navy seals that contact
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:47.600]  me, the, the Delta force people, the former current, I cannot even tell you off record
[02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:54.160]  the, the, the, how hot this info is in the military and the enlisted, the army, the Marines,
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:59.920]  the Navy. I mean, I've got to say everybody I talked to says more than half the military
[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:06.360]  is really awake now. Folks, 10 years ago, it was maybe 5%. It's exponential, but I'm
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:13.680]  telling you that globalists are going to pull some dirty tricks to try to get control again.
[02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:19.280]  I'm talking about mushroom clouds are possible, bio weapons. I mean, anything is possible.
[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:24.920]  You look at these terror attacks, these stage attacks, First World Trade Center, Oklahoma
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:32.440]  City, 9-11, they're all when they, they're bigger, they're bigger. And I'm telling you,
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:36.840]  the globalist aren't going to go away easy, but they were already planning to do devastating
[02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:41.640]  things to bring us under their control. So let them do the devastation on our terms.
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:45.320]  Okay, we're going to be in the fight. God bless you. I appreciate your call, sir. Good
[02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:51.320]  to hear from you. Okay, I'm going to go to Scarlett Skeletor James Jordan before this
[02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:58.280]  show ends, but I got to go to a couple of videos slash audio here before I even upload
[02:43:58.280 --> 02:44:03.680]  these to prisonplanet.tv. And I will air the dog one on, on M4s, not only news tonight,
[02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:07.400]  so prisonplanet.tv members can see it. And then the day later, we posted for everybody
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:11.520]  on the YouTube channel while we've still got it, one of the eight channels while we've
[02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:15.600]  still got it because they're trying to shut us down right now. And I mean, I'm telling
[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:19.800]  you, I've been hit by four different torpedoes at this office in the last week. YouTube's
[02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:24.360]  the least of them that I'm not even getting into here on air because, because the system
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:27.920]  is going to throw everything they've got at us, try to slow us down, but that only makes
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:33.720]  me know we're winning. Now, this first one is during a break an hour and a half ago,
[02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:42.840]  I walk out there and I see them showing on CNBC footage of the collateral damage video
[02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:49.780]  that they showed of the Army helicopter shooting Reuters reporters. And I was pointing out
[02:44:49.780 --> 02:44:55.080]  that the guys in the helicopter were laughing because they were removed like people in drones
[02:44:55.080 --> 02:45:03.080]  and how that's been written about in history, how it dehumanizes war versus the Army soldiers
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:07.680]  who pick up the little kids who were shot up and go and save them and, and, and, and,
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:11.720]  and who were upset about what's happening. I was illustrating how when you become removed
[02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:16.560]  from war, see this video had been on hundreds of newscast, thousands of videos online, none
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:20.800]  of them had been banned. It was a WikiLeaks video. It was months after it was out, I did
[02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:26.440]  a video about the dehumanization of being separated in warfare with drones and the rest
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:30.920]  of it. Okay. And how the helicopter pilots probably
[02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:35.160]  meant well, believe they were killing terrorists, but still even made a joke when they found
[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:39.200]  out it was kids because their conscience couldn't handle it. So they made a joke out of it versus
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:43.320]  the troops on the ground with, with, with, with choking back tears as they're running
[02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:47.360]  saying, hurry, we got to get these kids. Cause the normal response with little girls with
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:52.520]  their guts hanging out is to get choked up if you've got humanity, not because you're
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:57.440]  weak, but because you're strong. It's the week that turned away from humanity and, and,
[02:45:57.440 --> 02:46:02.280]  and decided they can't deal with the pain. It's the strong that absorbed the pain because
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:06.960]  we have our nerves. We have our conscious. Our soul is open to the universe. We're not
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:12.800]  burned out inside like these devils. I didn't call the helicopter pilots devils. I said,
[02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:17.960]  they were on the road to that and that their souls were in danger. That's why YouTube banned
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:23.480]  my video because the power of my words, the power of truth, the power of how it simply
[02:46:23.480 --> 02:46:27.680]  stands on its own. And I just, it just reminded me of how they're
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:33.880]  censoring me again for attacking this demon that says basically arrest people, drug them
[02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:38.040]  if they don't agree with us. And then we found other documents where she's saying, you know,
[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:42.000]  ignore the Congress, ignore democracy in her words. She means due process. She wants a
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:49.120]  dictatorship. So they removed my video about that. And again, it shows who they are. They're
[02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:54.520]  not liberal trendies that care. It's like Coney people don't. It's about selling war as,
[02:46:54.520 --> 02:47:03.000]  as, as liberal. And it's, it's devilish. War is necessary sometimes, but you only do it
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:06.840]  when you're attacked. You start hearing points. Let's go to the short video. Let's go and
[02:47:06.840 --> 02:47:11.920]  go to the video now. Here it is. Folks, here it is. We're in here in the broadcast.
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:16.960]  Studio of the radio show during a break. I walk out here and they're showing the collateral
[02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:24.640]  murder footage that's been on thousands of times on TV of the army helicopters, the apaches
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:30.640]  shooting up the Reuters camera guy with the kids. And why am I showing you this right
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:36.480]  now? Because remember YouTube gave us a community guidelines strike and tried to shut our channel
[02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:46.840]  down for showing that I'm sick of it. And now I criticize this professor who's sickeningly
[02:47:46.840 --> 02:47:50.240]  came out and said, put people in mental institutions. Basically, they don't believe in man. Make
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:56.520]  all the warming. Don't want to pay Al Gore money. I did that and they shut that video
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:01.200]  down. Can't, can't make fun of her, you know, a public figure. And then now we've gotten
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:05.040]  more of her writings. They didn't pull down quick enough where she says, ignore democracy
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:09.120]  Congress, everybody, just do what you want. Shut down the coal power plants, take over
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:13.040]  carbon dioxide is too deadly. What about genetic engineering, lady? What about all the real
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:21.920]  threats, huh? Just incredible. Absolutely incredible. And it makes me want to throw
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:27.640]  up the double standard system. What these people get away with Alex Jones reporting
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:32.120]  for info wars.com. Maybe they'll shut my channel down again, because I just showed
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:36.720]  the army shooting that up. And again, people say, well, so what, YouTube, you know, is
[02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:41.120]  its own private site, they advertises YouTube, a public comments, then they selectively enforce
[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:47.880]  the rules that I don't even violate. That's the problem. That's the issue. Okay, it's
[02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:54.320]  unfair trade practices. It's selective enforcement. It's false advertising. I've brought those
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:59.640]  people 600 million views with all my channels put together. I don't even take ads and they
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:03.360]  still put ads over it. They're making millions of dollars. I just want to reach the public
[02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:09.160]  and warn them and expose the lies. That's all I've ever wanted to do. That's all I've
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:16.000]  ever tried to do. It's all I've ever tried to establish is get the empire on the run.
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:30.600]  All right, there's that video. And we've got the dog video. How long is that? We'll come
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:34.080]  back from break and play that. And again, I got to narrate the video. You know what?
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:39.200]  We'll do the dog video on the news tonight. We'll do the dog video on the info wars nightly
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:44.560]  news this evening. But I preface it with how the media keeps us diverted and distracted.
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:48.760]  Let's go to a call right now. Scarlett in Pennsylvania, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:53.280]  I want to tell you how much I appreciate what you're doing for starters. You're doing
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:59.160]  a really good job. Well, thank you. Thank you, sir. I want to tell you, like, I have
[02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:03.880]  really high IQ, like IQs are my family and everything. And I've been running into everything
[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:07.640]  that you've been talking about. I was a little kid. You know, I was in school. I was one of
[02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:12.040]  the first ones there to read. They tell me shut up, put my hand down. Everything you're
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:16.640]  ever talked about. I've pretty much experienced all that. No, no, exactly. The new world order
[02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:23.280]  is run by the dumb evil people who hate smart people. That's the best way to describe them.
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:27.680]  That's very true. I mean, I've seen things before you've talked about them. I've been
[02:50:27.680 --> 02:50:30.600]  saying the same thing before you hear you talk about them. Well, I know that's all
[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:35.920]  I do is point out what people already know. Absolutely. It's so obvious that even if you
[02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:41.240]  do shut up, they're still going to get in your face. People need to not shut up. I agree.
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:47.160]  It's about gangs and bullying. And what people do is cowards go and join the gang and do
[02:50:47.160 --> 02:50:52.240]  whatever it says. So they feel like they're winners. Like, I'm going to pay Al Gore money.
[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:56.040]  I'm a winner. I'm part of the winning group. And they hate it when we go, no, you're a
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:01.640]  bunch of scam artists. And we're going to expose you. They're like, shut him up.
[02:51:01.640 --> 02:51:07.480]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights
[02:51:07.480 --> 02:51:12.000]  back on? If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear because
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:16.360]  there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead. Here's
[02:51:16.360 --> 02:51:21.800]  why solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science,
[02:51:21.800 --> 02:51:26.360]  one of our oldest sponsors. Their emergency backup systems provide life saving electrical
[02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:32.440]  power when you need it most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes
[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:36.760]  and produces electricity from the sun. It's like having an electric power plant running
[02:51:36.760 --> 02:51:41.480]  quietly in your own own, whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never
[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:46.080]  have to suffer through painful power outages again. When the power goes out this winter,
[02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:51.960]  you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science. Go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:51:51.960 --> 02:52:01.200]  for more information. That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365.

[02:53:05.400 --> 02:53:10.440]  poor mileage and poor performance? The cause is Stiction, a gummy residue that clings to
[02:53:10.440 --> 02:53:15.280]  injectors like cholesterol clings to arteries. Stiction robs your diesel engine of power,
[02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:20.400]  performance and gas mileage. The answer hot shot secret. This is Lee from Minnesota. I
[02:53:20.400 --> 02:53:25.160]  have a F 350 with a six oh diesel. I had many injector problems and hard starting problems.
[02:53:25.160 --> 02:53:29.200]  After I added hot shot secret and all starts better, feel stronger and my mileage went
[02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:34.880]  up two miles per gallon. I recommend hot shot secret to anyone with a diesel engine. Hot

[02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:29.280]  going to premiere an investigative report into Agenda 21 right here in Austin land grabbing.
[02:54:29.280 --> 02:54:34.480]  Loving you in. Let's go ahead and talk to James in Texas. You're on the air. Welcome,
[02:54:34.480 --> 02:54:45.280]  sir. The answer hot shot secret. Something's going on there. He's got his radio on or something.
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:53.280]  Skeletor in Colorado. Go ahead. Greetings from the trenches of pro-zachistan. The drain stream
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:58.960]  media is still dead. How are you doing, Alex? Good. You're a funny guy. What's going on,
[02:54:58.960 --> 02:55:04.000]  brother? Hey, I got an idea for a creative action that we could do with those undergarments
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:11.160]  that I sent you. I was thinking we should probably have like maybe a group that's traveling
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:16.120]  together. Let's say like a football team and let's all wear them on the outside. Oh, yeah,
[02:55:16.120 --> 02:55:19.680]  you're the guy that sent the underwear that the TSA can't see through and the TSA put
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:24.000]  a press release out. I guess saying that, you know, that that's not allowed or something
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:28.800]  because they're God. Well, I think it'd be fun to just get a whole group of people, you
[02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:32.840]  know, 50 people together and we're going to wear them on the outside and just like, you
[02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:39.400]  know, go ahead, try to, you know, let's see what you got. Skeletor, are you the guy that
[02:55:39.400 --> 02:55:44.200]  invented those underwear? Yes, this is my idea and I sent you a T-shirt and a few other
[02:55:44.200 --> 02:55:52.880]  designs. I'm wearing the underwear right now. I'm joking. I'm joking. Thanks for the call,
[02:55:52.880 --> 02:56:01.880]  man. That sounded weird at first. I'm the guy that sent you the undergarments. Oh, man.
[02:56:01.880 --> 02:56:12.880]  I was like, what? Oh, yeah. Jordan in Tennessee. You're on the air. Go ahead. Good. Did you
[02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:19.680]  send me undergarments? I'm sorry. Go ahead. Well, I'm just another day dealing with this
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:23.880]  corrupt government, which I mean, my grandfather's been paying attention to all the politics
[02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:28.080]  for the past 12 years. He's been telling me all this. It's been going down here on me.
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:32.760]  I'll go and tell you how we've had these really high gas prices and we say, well, these energy
[02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:38.960]  efficient cars come out working together. Well, sure. But I mean, did you hear Mark
[02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:46.200]  Fauber, top economist, you know, amazing researcher, he concurred the dollars being devalued.
[02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:49.920]  That's the main reason gas is up and that's why the stock market looks like it's got all
[02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:57.320]  this value. But I mean, you know, just because a cheeseburger cost a dollar 20 years ago
[02:56:57.320 --> 02:57:03.320]  and now costs $4 doesn't mean that's really more of a burger. Well, just because you know,
[02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:09.960]  a stock cost $500 if it's Google or Apple or whatever. Well, that's not really $500.
[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:16.000]  That's more like $100 20 years ago. It's bull. People think they're getting more value,
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:21.200]  but it's not. But you don't care. The country could burn as long as their stock says it's
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:28.160]  worth more. They don't care. So just inject your kids more. Just enjoy it then. Give them
[02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:31.880]  the cancer virus. It's love. Actually, don't give your kids cancer virus. But the point
[02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:33.880]  is, go ahead, sir.
[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:38.360]  Well, anyway, here's in the late great words of George and Bill. You know, I'm talking
[02:57:38.360 --> 02:57:43.840]  about probably George Carl and Bill Hicks. George Carl, he said that he defines perfectly
[02:57:43.840 --> 02:57:49.800]  the three classes in this country, the rich, y'all the money, paying those taxes, the middle
[02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:54.440]  class, they have to do all the work and pay all the taxes. The poor just there to scare
[02:57:54.440 --> 02:58:01.640]  the middle class. No, that's it. And in the words of Bill Hicks, and I just want to point
[02:58:01.640 --> 02:58:06.920]  this, you actually look a little like him. I'm just saying. I miss what you said there.
[02:58:06.920 --> 02:58:11.200]  You know, you're messing up my work there. As you know, I am Bill Hicks. And so don't
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:15.440]  be stealing my lines there. That's even funnier. I'm not Bill Hicks, folks. You know, they
[02:58:15.440 --> 02:58:23.320]  actually went and dug up my high school annuals and put them online. And people don't believe
[02:58:23.320 --> 02:58:28.320]  that's really Alex Jones. They say that's not proof. Who knows? You haven't seen my
[02:58:28.320 --> 02:58:37.280]  birth certificate. Maybe I'm from Klandathu. Maybe I'm secretly a brain bug. A reptoid.
[02:58:37.280 --> 02:58:45.880]  And continues.
