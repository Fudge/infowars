[00:00.000 --> 00:08.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:08.640 --> 00:16.120]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot-com studios it's alex
[00:16.120 --> 00:18.680]  jones
[00:18.680 --> 00:33.000]  335 days left till the 2020 election you can cut the suspense with a knife many
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.480]  people are accelerating their awakening while others are going deeper into the
[00:39.480 --> 00:48.640]  trance of death it is Tuesday December 11th December 3rd 2019
[00:48.640 --> 00:55.400]  it is 11 o'clock central standard time and we're going to be live here for the
[00:55.400 --> 01:00.640]  next four hours David Knight of course was just hosting his great broadcast we
[01:00.640 --> 01:07.600]  have Owen shroyer coming up with the war room from three to six p.m. then a
[01:07.600 --> 01:13.920]  rebroadcast of my first hour and then firepower with Will Johnson and Tom
[01:13.920 --> 01:20.720]  Pepper again this is teleprompter free live global news and information on this
[01:20.720 --> 01:30.320]  December 3rd 2019 Tuesday global broadcast David Ike's going to be
[01:30.320 --> 01:37.280]  joining us co-hosting for two hours today then Paul Joseph Watson is going to be
[01:37.280 --> 01:44.000]  hosting the fourth hour so quite a transmission that you're not going to
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.560]  want to miss obviously separately from that I'll do my best to cover a lot of
[01:50.560 --> 01:55.920]  the huge breaking news in the stacks here in the first hour and there's so much
[01:55.920 --> 02:03.040]  unfolding that wild horses can't drag me away I also co-hosted much of Owen's
[02:03.040 --> 02:09.120]  broadcast yesterday and still I didn't get to a lot of the news and
[02:09.120 --> 02:15.160]  information I think really the big takeaway is this
[02:21.920 --> 02:32.760]  there are forces on this planet that have been very mysterious and we know
[02:32.760 --> 02:37.320]  those forces are malevolent
[02:39.160 --> 02:46.120]  and those forces have been working to poison and disease and dumb down humanity
[02:46.120 --> 02:52.440]  and now mainline globalist publications and mainline universities on a
[02:52.440 --> 02:59.880]  planetary scale are all heralding the end of humanity a post-human world
[02:59.880 --> 03:05.880]  nightmare scenario now the only question is who's running this
[03:05.880 --> 03:08.920]  the bible would tell you it's interdimensional creatures that we
[03:08.920 --> 03:14.840]  can't see and now science shows that those dimensions do exist
[03:14.840 --> 03:19.960]  and mainline mathematical equations from the biggest supercomputer show that our
[03:19.960 --> 03:23.560]  universe is contained within another universe of
[03:23.560 --> 03:28.040]  dark matter that's many times more powerful artificially holding the
[03:28.040 --> 03:34.360]  universe in place that is the third dimension
[03:34.360 --> 03:38.840]  and this is something you know David Ike was talking about 25 26 27 years ago
[03:38.840 --> 03:43.400]  being attacked for I don't know if all of his theories are right
[03:43.400 --> 03:47.880]  but I do know that he pioneered exposing the whole pedophile agenda
[03:47.880 --> 03:52.680]  which is now out in the open and so you have to pay attention to what David Ike
[03:52.680 --> 03:56.280]  has to say he certainly gets people thinking and that's something the
[03:56.280 --> 04:03.560]  establishment doesn't want so he'll be with us in the
[04:03.560 --> 04:09.160]  second and third hour today and this is not a spectator sport fighting the
[04:09.160 --> 04:11.640]  globalist I cannot impress upon you enough how
[04:11.640 --> 04:15.320]  important you are the fact that you're the people that care enough
[04:15.320 --> 04:19.800]  to find the broadcast and they're aware of what's going on
[04:19.800 --> 04:22.840]  to a level no one else is on the planet it's really true
[04:22.840 --> 04:26.600]  that's why they want to extinguish info wars as a focal point for us to come
[04:26.600 --> 04:29.880]  together and share information that's why it's critical that they
[04:29.880 --> 04:33.480]  not extinguish info wars and it's why it's critical that you spread the word
[04:33.480 --> 04:37.240]  however you're listening however you're watching right now
[04:37.240 --> 04:42.760]  do it daily and it is an exercise of survival and exercise of victory and
[04:42.760 --> 04:46.280]  because of you in the face of the globalist attack we're still on air
[04:46.280 --> 04:50.280]  and in some way stronger so I salute you and thank you we'll start
[04:50.280 --> 04:58.840]  the official transmission in 60 seconds on the other side
[04:59.400 --> 05:03.000]  the anti defamation league is one of the most powerful
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.720]  globalist leftist anti-american organizations on the face of the planet
[05:07.720 --> 05:12.520]  and they have declared that info wars is public enemy number one
[05:12.520 --> 05:16.520]  they gave tim cook of apple an award specifically
[05:16.520 --> 05:20.520]  for deplat forming me to make sure that tens of millions of people
[05:20.520 --> 05:25.880]  could not hear the show and now they've had sasha barack cohen come out and call
[05:25.880 --> 05:31.480]  for the arrest of big tech heads that do not turn full control over to the
[05:31.480 --> 05:35.320]  globalist adl and they've called for a complete
[05:35.320 --> 05:40.280]  purge of anyone promoting americana we are being demoralized we are being
[05:40.280 --> 05:43.800]  conquered and the enemy wants to shut info wars down because they
[05:43.800 --> 05:47.480]  understand that we've got their number and know how to defeat their paradigm
[05:47.480 --> 05:51.320]  you have helped keep us on the air but now the attacks are more insane than
[05:51.320 --> 05:55.000]  ever so please visit info war store dot com during black friday for the biggest
[05:55.000 --> 05:59.480]  sales of the year and fund the info war please take action
[06:03.800 --> 06:08.600]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic
[06:08.600 --> 06:16.840]  it's alex jones
[06:16.840 --> 06:23.880]  it's tuesday december 3rd 2019 i'm your host alex jones still on air
[06:23.880 --> 06:27.880]  thanks to you in defiance of the globalist and their will
[06:27.880 --> 06:34.200]  to extinguish free humanities voices this broadcast
[06:34.200 --> 06:38.440]  chief amongst the american resistance to the globalist
[06:38.440 --> 06:42.040]  blasting out worldwide only magnified
[06:42.040 --> 06:47.160]  by you when you spread the word so this is a true symbiotic relationship
[06:47.160 --> 06:53.960]  335 days left until this critical election as the globalist
[06:53.960 --> 06:58.120]  mount their full assault try to defeat president trump
[06:58.120 --> 07:02.920]  who is a symbol of populism and nationalism and a symbol
[07:02.920 --> 07:12.040]  of americanism not globalism a symbol of unity a symbol of the nation state
[07:12.040 --> 07:15.480]  but the forces of tyranny are working around
[07:15.480 --> 07:21.880]  the clock right now not just here but across the world from brazil to europe
[07:21.880 --> 07:26.360]  from africa to asia to crush nationalists to crush
[07:26.360 --> 07:31.880]  every human system and break the will of humanity so that we can go to the long
[07:31.880 --> 07:36.120]  dark night of the technocracy and be absorbed
[07:36.120 --> 07:42.680]  into this silicon satanic system ladies and gentlemen this is the final
[07:42.680 --> 07:45.400]  countdown humanity's great decision the world
[07:45.400 --> 07:49.240]  government the casual society it's all going live
[07:49.240 --> 07:57.720]  right now run by communist china and the united nations
[07:57.720 --> 08:04.440]  that is officially been released by reuters ap and a un press release
[08:04.440 --> 08:12.040]  communist china is quarterbacking as the chief foreman
[08:12.040 --> 08:16.440]  on the engineering project for the world
[08:16.440 --> 08:24.760]  government 5g microchipped population interface it's right
[08:24.760 --> 08:32.920]  here chinese tech groups writing un facial recognition standards
[08:32.920 --> 08:38.840]  reuters and it goes on from there ladies and gentlemen
[08:38.840 --> 08:43.000]  you will face scan or palm scan to buy and sell
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.760]  and if you don't submit you will be turned off you will starve to death in the
[08:46.760 --> 08:50.040]  streets huge populations will run to the
[08:50.040 --> 08:53.640]  hills in the rural areas and will try to go back to agrarian societies they
[08:53.640 --> 08:58.280]  will be assaulted by robot drones robot tanks
[08:58.280 --> 09:02.280]  you think well humans won't go wipe out humans that run from the beast
[09:02.280 --> 09:05.480]  but the robots are already here and they're coming
[09:05.480 --> 09:09.320]  and china is writing the global standards for that america was supposed
[09:09.320 --> 09:13.880]  to fall and not even be in the picture
[09:13.880 --> 09:18.040]  and china is meant to empower the entire system
[09:18.040 --> 09:25.080]  and literally bake us with six seven eight nine and ten g already being rolled out
[09:25.080 --> 09:28.520]  this isn't science fiction this is the waning
[09:28.520 --> 09:31.640]  twilight hours
[09:32.680 --> 09:39.960]  of the year 2019 the future is here it's not equally distributed
[09:39.960 --> 09:44.520]  and it's being run by psychotic anti-human control freaks
[09:44.520 --> 09:47.960]  who believe they're going to merge with machines and become gods
[09:47.960 --> 09:54.760]  but only after they have paid choron to cross into their hell that they believe
[09:54.760 --> 09:59.240]  is heaven and the payment is the extermination of
[09:59.240 --> 10:08.040]  the disease the virus known as homo sapien sapien
[10:08.040 --> 10:16.040]  that is openly ladies and gentlemen going on
[10:16.040 --> 10:19.320]  you know the crew does a great job in real time
[10:19.320 --> 10:25.240]  pulling up articles and videos of just whatever subject i talk about here on
[10:25.240 --> 10:27.880]  air and and they don't even know what i'm
[10:27.880 --> 10:30.440]  going to be bringing up most of the time i would encourage listeners and
[10:30.440 --> 10:34.120]  viewers a lot of you do to actually look into what i say and what i claim
[10:34.120 --> 10:38.840]  because 99 of the time you can easily just go find it
[10:38.840 --> 10:43.320]  but it's from the globalist perspective telling you how great it is that oh
[10:43.320 --> 10:48.200]  next year tesla is going to roll out
[10:48.200 --> 10:52.200]  not just brain chips but dozens of wires put into your brain
[10:52.200 --> 10:55.800]  but it's essential that it not be done at a hospital because that sounds too
[10:55.800 --> 11:00.040]  medical and scary brain surgery so it's done at little
[11:00.040 --> 11:05.720]  kiosk at the mall where you just step in like you look at a tesla car and
[11:05.720 --> 11:10.360]  sign up and you and they don't worry a robot cuts a hole in the back of your
[11:10.360 --> 11:13.880]  head and sticks some wires in there and you sign the waiver forms and then you
[11:13.880 --> 11:17.400]  walk out and all your friends go oh you're so cool you're a cyborg now
[11:17.400 --> 11:20.520]  but again they got to do it like it's buying a pair of shoes
[11:20.520 --> 11:26.200]  or you know getting a pedicure it's all just no big deal
[11:26.200 --> 11:31.400]  get your bikini wax get some wires shoved in your brain while the homeless in
[11:31.400 --> 11:36.440]  austin get their microchips and yeah it's announced nobody cares okay
[11:36.440 --> 11:44.280]  just the homeless in a warehouse getting their microchips
[11:44.280 --> 11:47.400]  of course we had the documents over a month ago it's confirmed but oh it goes
[11:47.400 --> 11:51.720]  so viral when it's buried in just a video on the internet
[11:51.720 --> 11:55.080]  of a guy getting his hair trimmed who's homeless and he goes oh yeah they're
[11:55.080 --> 11:57.800]  moving into warehouse getting the microchip everything's gonna be free
[11:57.800 --> 12:01.720]  well that's actually what the plan says so you can see where this is going you
[12:01.720 --> 12:06.040]  do what you're told you get your microchip and then you behave the way
[12:06.040 --> 12:08.920]  you're told and then you get all these free little
[12:08.920 --> 12:13.240]  credits put onto your chip because the robot factories
[12:13.240 --> 12:16.760]  are making all the goods now humans don't have to work anymore
[12:16.760 --> 12:21.160]  but you're being made obsolete so that you don't know how things work or operate
[12:21.160 --> 12:26.360]  so you're lazy so you're stupid so you're drugged by weaponized level marijuana
[12:26.360 --> 12:30.680]  and fentanyl and fluoride in the water and it's all an admitted plan
[12:30.680 --> 12:36.840]  to shutter and control your consciousness
[12:38.120 --> 12:43.560]  and that really is my main message
[12:43.560 --> 12:53.320]  to everybody is that this is not a drill
[12:53.560 --> 12:57.320]  this is not a game this is not a joke this is real
[12:57.320 --> 13:03.400]  and info wars view of the world is the most accurate forecast of what was
[13:03.400 --> 13:07.720]  going to come and now it's here and you don't have to listen to me
[13:07.720 --> 13:11.960]  telling you what's going to come next the globalists
[13:11.960 --> 13:15.560]  have told you what's going to come next but don't worry you're going to be as
[13:15.560 --> 13:21.160]  high as a kite when you die 30 40 years before you're supposed to
[13:21.160 --> 13:26.280]  and you'll never know what hit you as the rise of the new species of machines
[13:26.280 --> 13:29.800]  takes over and we are phased out that's all been announced
[13:29.800 --> 13:33.640]  that's taught at all the universities and and people under Stockholm syndrome go
[13:33.640 --> 13:39.720]  well i better join that so i can be part of the last group that has to go
[13:39.720 --> 13:43.240]  and give up their humanity because they're all agreeing
[13:43.240 --> 13:47.560]  that they have to die before they're uploaded
[13:47.560 --> 13:53.000]  to the mothership this is beyond a hail bop
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.040]  cult where these men cut their testicles and penises off and
[13:58.040 --> 14:01.880]  were transgendered and all believe that they were going to beam their spirits
[14:01.880 --> 14:06.040]  up to the hail bop comment and those were some top programmers in silicon
[14:06.040 --> 14:08.360]  valley where do you think this whacked out stuff
[14:08.360 --> 14:11.880]  comes from they just thought they were moving to the end
[14:11.880 --> 14:16.440]  right away forget uploading to the computers
[14:16.440 --> 14:20.440]  when they were taking their dmt whatever it was they were talking to on the
[14:20.440 --> 14:24.440]  dmt told them to drink vodka and take barbiturates
[14:24.440 --> 14:28.200]  and wear their Nike tennis shoes
[14:31.240 --> 14:34.680]  see how that works we're going to go to break i'm going to come back and get into
[14:34.680 --> 14:38.520]  all the current temporal news head of David Ike
[14:38.520 --> 14:41.480]  hasn't been on two years joining us for two hours will be co-hosting this is
[14:41.480 --> 14:44.840]  going to be powerful he's always very thought-provoking
[14:44.840 --> 14:48.360]  but however you're watching however you're listening remember
[14:48.360 --> 14:51.880]  it's beyond paramount it's beyond central it's beyond critical it's
[14:51.880 --> 14:55.800]  absolutely imperative that if you're listening on local
[14:55.800 --> 14:59.480]  amenathem stations that you tell people about the station with urgency
[14:59.480 --> 15:03.320]  they want to have us in this trance no you go into the grocery store
[15:03.320 --> 15:07.560]  or the gas station or you walk into work you say hey i'm listening to Alex Jones
[15:07.560 --> 15:10.520]  right now or i'm gonna listen to him tonight on the local station he's
[15:10.520 --> 15:12.680]  covering stuff they don't want you to hear that's why he's so
[15:12.680 --> 15:16.120]  censored yeah i've heard of that guy well listen
[15:16.120 --> 15:19.480]  find out what he's really saying it affects you and your family
[15:19.480 --> 15:23.560]  we don't have to let this takeover happen well who's taking over
[15:23.560 --> 15:27.960]  listen you need to find out who's taking over one can't
[15:27.960 --> 15:32.600]  be told about the matrix one has to see it info wars
[15:32.600 --> 15:35.400]  sees into the matrix we can read the code so can you
[15:35.400 --> 15:39.640]  but at this point i can literally see the code
[15:39.640 --> 15:43.320]  just like hollywood says they're throwing in your face ladies and gentlemen
[15:43.320 --> 15:47.000]  and they believe a lot of you're going to see the code and get scared and join it
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.680]  you will not upload the machine you will
[15:50.680 --> 15:58.040]  download to hell do not join with satan it's a lie it's all a fraud

[16:06.600 --> 16:10.120]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear bill hide here i want
[16:10.120 --> 16:13.880]  to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our ppx
[16:13.880 --> 16:17.160]  microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of
[16:17.160 --> 16:20.280]  electricity off the grid the clearance price is a result of the
[16:20.280 --> 16:23.080]  historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the
[16:23.080 --> 16:26.040]  mississippi because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our
[16:26.040 --> 16:29.480]  inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the
[16:29.480 --> 16:32.440]  warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem
[16:32.440 --> 16:36.520]  unbelievable if you didn't know the flood waters backstory so here's what you
[16:36.520 --> 16:41.000]  should do right now check out the ppx microgrid system at my own power grid

[18:00.200 --> 18:02.840]  the last few days i've been online looking for the speech
[18:03.640 --> 18:07.640]  i actually read it in a book about winston churchill many years ago and i've
[18:07.640 --> 18:10.840]  found a few places where it's mentioned but if you can find it please send it to
[18:10.840 --> 18:14.200]  showtipsdenfullwords.com and he talked about in the darkest hours at the
[18:14.200 --> 18:18.120]  beginning of world war two the fact that there have been times in history where
[18:18.120 --> 18:21.480]  people had a chance to stand up and fight early on and we're assured of victory
[18:21.480 --> 18:25.160]  then there was a second point in history where folks have to fight even though the
[18:25.160 --> 18:30.040]  chances of winning are pretty steep there's a third time when you know you're
[18:30.040 --> 18:34.680]  gonna lose but you have to fight because being enslaved and being slowly killed is
[18:34.680 --> 18:38.680]  much much worse that's a paraphrase but ladies and gentlemen we are in the
[18:38.680 --> 18:42.600]  position now of being able to win this easily if we find our spirit find our
[18:42.600 --> 18:47.080]  focus and don't give up and take action but if we don't stand up and get involved
[18:47.080 --> 18:50.520]  we're going to skip number two and go right to number three
[18:50.520 --> 18:54.040]  that's a fact they fear info wars because we are alive
[18:54.040 --> 18:56.840]  it's time for the world to awaken and take back our future
[18:59.160 --> 19:03.800]  andy in florida thank you andy go ahead hey alex i love you man we love you
[19:03.800 --> 19:07.160]  before i go ahead and talk about the topic on hand i gotta talk about one of
[19:07.160 --> 19:11.640]  your product a little bit about me i'm 245 pounds i work about 10 to 13 hours a
[19:11.640 --> 19:16.520]  day at ups and make a long story short i used to have a problem with aterol i do
[19:16.520 --> 19:20.920]  have adhd but you know i was taking aterol for its energy boosting properties you
[19:20.920 --> 19:23.960]  know i kind of got a little out of hand and you know i listen you religiously in
[19:23.960 --> 19:28.440]  my truck every day so i tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche this
[19:28.440 --> 19:31.880]  product changed my life but turbo force really changed my life and it was a day
[19:31.880 --> 19:36.120]  i no longer take aterol and i get by literally the 13 hours a day i work on
[19:36.120 --> 19:40.360]  a half of a packet of your turbo force and if you take a half a packet that's
[19:40.360 --> 19:43.960]  literally a dollar a day and you save so much money versus you know a monster
[19:43.960 --> 19:48.040]  which is what 499 and you know i just had to call and tell you guys uh how great
[19:48.040 --> 19:51.000]  turbo force is and if anybody's on the fence they really have to try it we're
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.040]  really proud of turbo force so thank you sir commit to buy a lot of your products
[19:54.040 --> 19:58.360]  at m4store.com then help us spread the word let's just get busy m4store.com

[20:12.440 --> 20:18.280]  you have the power humanity has the power we have the power do you want to fight
[20:18.280 --> 20:20.360]  you better believe you got one
[20:22.760 --> 20:27.720]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty
[20:27.720 --> 20:31.720]  it's alex jones
[20:35.320 --> 20:38.520]  i don't say it with pleasure when i point out that
[20:38.520 --> 20:42.360]  info wars has laid out how the planet really works
[20:42.360 --> 20:47.400]  who's in charge and what their in game is long before they came out and admitted
[20:47.400 --> 20:52.280]  the in game and now they're just flooding us with electromagnetic
[20:52.280 --> 20:55.880]  radiation gmo tons and tons of fentanyl
[20:55.880 --> 21:01.800]  enough to kill the whole country if we took a dose is flooding in every week
[21:01.800 --> 21:07.080]  it's just incredible and christian pro-human nations are under attack
[21:07.080 --> 21:11.080]  everybody else is basically given up and are complete slaves
[21:11.080 --> 21:14.360]  but there's hope in defeating this if we can admit
[21:14.360 --> 21:18.440]  what's happening and rediscover the basic liberties that made us great now i
[21:18.440 --> 21:22.360]  want to tell you the news that's coming up i'm going to cover before david
[21:22.360 --> 21:26.920]  eich joins us but i also wanted to just encourage listeners and
[21:26.920 --> 21:30.520]  viewers with christmas being here to not spend your money
[21:30.520 --> 21:34.120]  with target and i occasionally still go to target if it's
[21:34.120 --> 21:38.520]  10 o'clock at night and you know the kids need socks or something i forgot to
[21:38.520 --> 21:41.880]  get if i'm out of town it's not the target's a bad
[21:41.880 --> 21:45.240]  store itself it's that it's a globalist anti-human
[21:45.240 --> 21:49.720]  transhumanist brainwash the kids get rid of the boys and girls toy sections
[21:49.720 --> 21:52.920]  because it's bad for boys and girls to be you know to be their own independent
[21:52.920 --> 21:57.000]  part of the species they're doing terrible stuff
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.040]  why would you go buy your christmas presents with them and then look at
[22:00.040 --> 22:05.080]  jeff bezos and his globalism and his slave factories and and
[22:05.080 --> 22:08.600]  with the robot takeover and i'm not judging you if you bought some stuff on
[22:08.600 --> 22:13.400]  amazon everybody does the point is buy stuff from local merchants buy
[22:13.400 --> 22:16.520]  things from info wars buy things that you need that are high quality
[22:16.520 --> 22:21.960]  with organizations that share your values why go out and fight all the traffic
[22:21.960 --> 22:24.920]  why go out and go through the craziness of the stores
[22:24.920 --> 22:29.400]  when you can go to m4store.com and get great apparel great air filtration
[22:29.400 --> 22:34.520]  water filtration uh preparedness items and ladies and gentlemen
[22:34.520 --> 22:39.320]  look right here eight-pack power stack i believed
[22:39.320 --> 22:43.320]  would be our best-selling item because if you look at the industry
[22:43.320 --> 22:47.240]  the hottest thing the last five years or so because it works
[22:47.240 --> 22:51.400]  is an a m pack and a p m pack that you take and it's been
[22:51.400 --> 22:55.080]  somewhat popular i wouldn't call it a bomb but i haven't really promoted it
[22:55.080 --> 22:59.480]  and so in the six months we've had this in it's not even our top ten sellers i
[22:59.480 --> 23:02.920]  think it should be people like what kind of pitch is that that you can't sell
[23:02.920 --> 23:06.440]  something well the truth's always my pitch
[23:06.440 --> 23:10.840]  i've been taking this religiously for about four months now
[23:10.840 --> 23:13.880]  and that way you don't forget it's got 13 pills
[23:13.880 --> 23:16.760]  i'm not going to go into everything that's in it but it's got stuff for the
[23:16.760 --> 23:19.240]  morning and then it's got stuff for the night
[23:19.240 --> 23:23.160]  and it's for people that are going to forget
[23:23.160 --> 23:26.520]  to take their supplements if you've got a husband or a wife or a brother
[23:26.520 --> 23:30.520]  or a sister or a grandmother or a grandfather or a boss or employee
[23:30.520 --> 23:33.720]  somebody that you care about somebody you know not taking care of themselves
[23:33.720 --> 23:36.920]  eating too much fast food not exercising the way to start
[23:36.920 --> 23:39.320]  is getting people to think about their health and getting people to take
[23:39.320 --> 23:41.560]  something like eight pack power stack now listen
[23:41.560 --> 23:44.760]  these are the best selling products in the industry i went out to the top
[23:44.760 --> 23:49.240]  manufacturers looked at it and the other top competitor puts
[23:49.240 --> 23:52.360]  about 15 dollars a product in everybody else puts about five
[23:52.360 --> 23:55.160]  dollars a product in and then the packaging because there's so many
[23:55.160 --> 23:59.240]  packages in here ends up costing about five dollars as well
[23:59.240 --> 24:02.600]  well the packaging costs is five dollars but
[24:02.600 --> 24:06.200]  there's you know there's 30 something packets in here
[24:06.200 --> 24:11.080]  but the product costs way more than that so we're selling this
[24:11.080 --> 24:20.920]  at cost at 29.95 you understand at cost at 29.95 and that way we can fund
[24:20.920 --> 24:24.600]  ourselves in the next year but this is the perfect thing to put under the tree
[24:24.600 --> 24:29.560]  perfect thing to give in in the stocking and then just hey
[24:29.560 --> 24:32.360]  for particular wives out there your husband's not taking care of himself
[24:32.360 --> 24:35.000]  he's not going to listen i just do the same way about supplements even though i
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.960]  knew they work so i've religiously started taking them and i still forget
[24:37.960 --> 24:40.200]  and then wow what happened i'm not feeling as good i've gained some weight
[24:40.200 --> 24:43.480]  again i'm not taking these things work it's the fastest growing industry
[24:43.480 --> 24:47.640]  because it works folks 13 pills i don't have time to get into
[24:47.640 --> 24:52.360]  what is in both the packs 13 pills a day game changing
[24:52.360 --> 24:54.920]  there's more nutrients in this and you're getting all those meals for the
[24:54.920 --> 24:57.640]  average person then you're not going to want to
[24:57.640 --> 25:00.360]  eat as much then you're going to lose weight in my experience
[25:00.360 --> 25:03.240]  i've already lost 30 pounds ladies and gentlemen because i'm religiously taking
[25:03.240 --> 25:06.040]  the eight pack power stack i'm taking the x2 the x3
[25:06.040 --> 25:09.400]  i'm taking the bodies when i have aches and pains
[25:09.400 --> 25:12.680]  i'm taking the brain force plus to work more hours turbo force is too strong i
[25:12.680 --> 25:14.920]  just can't take it i mean that's my sales pitch the truth
[25:14.920 --> 25:19.800]  works too well i don't need it um infowarstore.com now we have another deal

[25:39.160 --> 25:41.640]  59.95 it wasn't for the free shipping it'd be
[25:41.640 --> 25:46.440]  54 dollars or so this is literally at cost
[25:46.440 --> 25:49.880]  you'll never see deals like this next year so i finally sat down did the math
[25:49.880 --> 25:53.720]  to fund ourselves and everything that we had extra of i can sell at cost people
[25:53.720 --> 25:56.920]  get it it's moving out next year i'll have to go up to prices
[25:56.920 --> 26:00.840]  that then fund us with a smaller inventory and a smaller list of products
[26:00.840 --> 26:04.440]  and then we'll run through 2020 and if god keeps us on air and you support us
[26:04.440 --> 26:06.760]  we'll be there if not we'll be out of gas at the end of the

[31:01.000 --> 31:04.440]  why the servants of satan hate info wars it's because
[31:04.440 --> 31:10.680]  we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving up
[31:10.680 --> 31:13.640]  that's why it's critical for those of us that are aware
[31:13.640 --> 31:17.640]  of the new world order's plans to not get down when they attack us
[31:17.640 --> 31:21.880]  and they persecute us and they lie about us that's what we should expect
[31:21.880 --> 31:26.600]  because we are hurting these scumbags the globalists have literally sold their
[31:26.600 --> 31:29.720]  soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're
[31:29.720 --> 31:33.800]  slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress
[31:33.800 --> 31:37.560]  and dominate and destroy the innocent it is up to us
[31:37.560 --> 31:43.640]  who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheep dogs to stand firm
[31:43.640 --> 31:48.920]  and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake
[31:48.920 --> 31:53.320]  they fear the fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we
[31:53.320 --> 31:56.680]  love god and that's all we ever have to know
[31:56.680 --> 32:01.320]  is that god is in charge you want to break some globalist ribs you want to
[32:01.320 --> 32:04.040]  crush some skulls politically you want to drive
[32:04.040 --> 32:07.560]  ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually there's nowhere you can
[32:07.560 --> 32:11.400]  spend money there's nowhere you can place your bet
[32:11.400 --> 32:14.840]  in a fight where it's gonna have more power per dollar

[32:27.880 --> 32:31.240]  to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the
[32:31.240 --> 32:36.200]  enemy which god wants to see you see we have to make the effort 110 god will

[36:05.640 --> 36:09.240]  of the book with these people
[36:15.480 --> 36:20.120]  we'll get to that in a moment uh first off one thing i didn't add last segment
[36:20.120 --> 36:24.920]  something very exciting that we've been working on

[36:29.080 --> 36:34.040]  that but when you do it it gives other people faith and other people get
[36:34.040 --> 36:37.720]  really excited i can't tell you how many times i walk in the door

[36:55.800 --> 36:59.560]  and it spreads the word and info wars has been so demonized
[36:59.560 --> 37:03.080]  that it really is now a symbol of resistance against everything the
[37:03.080 --> 37:06.520]  globalists stand for and so i went to my great

[39:15.400 --> 39:21.240]  basically let a little more than a cent a sticker for these babies
[39:21.240 --> 39:25.240]  and then the bigger stickers cost us 10 cents a piece as well or whatever but
[39:25.240 --> 39:28.040]  the point is and you got the shipping and all the handling all the rest of it
[39:28.040 --> 39:33.400]  comes up to 995 is about what it cost us and this way you get it out
[39:33.400 --> 39:36.280]  very exciting go to info wars store dot com and find that i'm going to stop
[39:36.280 --> 39:40.680]  plugging it's just that information warfare is the way to go
[39:40.680 --> 39:44.920]  it's very very exciting and it's how we're going to change this world
[39:44.920 --> 39:48.360]  and it's how we're going to push back and fight back and
[39:48.360 --> 39:51.720]  you know when you have a sticker on your car
[39:51.720 --> 39:55.400]  if it's heptstein didn't kill himself the left now has embraced that
[39:55.400 --> 39:58.440]  and it's like yeah trumps involved no it's the clinton's it's the deep state
[39:58.440 --> 40:02.280]  it's not trump i've looked into it and they can't stand that
[40:02.280 --> 40:06.440]  but if you've got a information from that information banned on video in your
[40:06.440 --> 40:09.640]  car you're not going to get key to attacked
[40:09.640 --> 40:12.440]  but i would not stick an info wars in your car unless you live in a conservative
[40:12.440 --> 40:15.560]  rural area then you might meet your husband your wife you know your new
[40:15.560 --> 40:19.800]  best friend but do not do it in a blue area unless you
[40:19.800 --> 40:21.960]  are willing to be hit in the head with a bike lock
[40:21.960 --> 40:25.960]  i mean these people will go psychotic on you if you you you want to know what
[40:25.960 --> 40:29.320]  it's like to be alex shones walk around with an info wars shirt on

[40:33.560 --> 40:37.160]  but it doesn't matter that 15th person you walk by i'll take a swing at you
[40:37.160 --> 40:42.440]  because you are hitler to them and they want to attack somebody
[40:42.440 --> 40:46.360]  now as soon as you get back on her face they run
[40:46.360 --> 40:49.320]  but they'll bump you they'll hit you they'll you know not too hard it's like
[40:49.320 --> 40:53.720]  it's like a token thing to like with them it's all a simulation then you
[40:53.720 --> 40:56.760]  have to chase them down the street
[40:56.760 --> 41:00.680]  but that's how this works ladies and gentlemen this is a real war and i want
[41:00.680 --> 41:04.600]  you to experience it and engage these people because let me tell you
[41:04.600 --> 41:08.120]  they used to confront me all over i get right back in their face and now i go
[41:08.120 --> 41:12.040]  in restaurants i go in places they sit there with their upper lips shaking
[41:12.040 --> 41:16.200]  and they keep their libtard fascist mouth shut
[41:16.200 --> 41:20.360]  because i'm going to get right back in their stinking dirty child molestin
[41:20.360 --> 41:24.520]  face and they know it and they can't stand it
[41:24.520 --> 41:28.280]  they want to bully people just like the kids they kidnap and they rape
[41:28.280 --> 41:31.240]  and even if they're not raping kids they have that spirit now
[41:31.240 --> 41:35.400]  and now their main operating system we have the holy ghost they have the
[41:35.400 --> 41:39.720]  child molester spirit seriously the vampire hurt the children's spirit
[41:39.720 --> 41:43.720]  and they are now openly externalizing the method and saying yeah we want to
[41:43.720 --> 41:47.080]  kill babies we love to kill them after they're born hurt those little suckers
[41:47.080 --> 41:50.440]  i love chopping them up the mainline feminist all are saying how fun it is to
[41:50.440 --> 41:54.920]  kill babies and licking their lips and saying hail satan on tv
[41:54.920 --> 41:58.040]  they're not just doing that to demoralize you they're doing it because it's
[41:58.040 --> 42:02.600]  their power source and they're declaring the name of their god and their love
[42:02.600 --> 42:06.200]  of their god out of desperation because they can
[42:06.200 --> 42:09.640]  feel christ energy coming back of the world this is real this is happening
[42:09.640 --> 42:12.840]  they're very very scared right now
[42:13.640 --> 42:17.080]  and so exercise your free speech like never before
[42:17.080 --> 42:21.480]  call into a libtard show again go to congress confront them
[42:21.480 --> 42:25.480]  but whatever you do tell people about the local stations because
[42:25.480 --> 42:29.240]  folks are ready to wake up right now
[42:29.960 --> 42:32.600]  now we come back i'm gonna i'm gonna stop it and i'm gonna get to all this

[42:38.680 --> 42:42.200]  i mean these are psychotic demons and the veneers coming off where they're
[42:42.200 --> 42:46.120]  uncloaking it's not just senility it's not just that it's not just early
[42:46.120 --> 42:49.880]  dementia even the young leftists are having seizures on stage
[42:49.880 --> 42:55.320]  because they are falling and as the evil tries to come into them to attack us
[42:55.320 --> 43:00.600]  it's bringing them down not us my phone has been ringing off the hook
[43:00.600 --> 43:05.160]  dozens and dozens of people have called me i've gotten all these text messages
[43:05.160 --> 43:08.520]  the office phones ringing off the hook emails are flooding in

[43:12.440 --> 43:16.920]  gonna run tens of millions of times were pulled by google

[43:32.760 --> 43:36.040]  wouldn't let malania trump images be sent out
[43:36.040 --> 43:39.960]  saying it was hate speech ladies and gentlemen this is beyond censorship
[43:39.960 --> 43:44.200]  it's total information control it has to all go through a filter and
[43:44.200 --> 43:48.520]  that's what ai allows is what i call information singularity
[43:48.520 --> 43:52.200]  not empowering information but holding it all in like the one
[43:52.200 --> 43:59.160]  ring of mordor trump must act now or they will steal this election

[45:07.240 --> 45:10.360]  your product a little bit about me i'm 245 pounds i work
[45:10.360 --> 45:14.680]  about 10 to 13 hours a day at ups and make a long story short i used to
[45:14.680 --> 45:18.280]  have a problem with adderall i do have adhd but you know i was
[45:18.280 --> 45:21.800]  taking adderall for its energy boosting properties you know i kind of got a
[45:21.800 --> 45:24.600]  little out of hand and you know i listen to you religiously in my truck every
[45:24.600 --> 45:28.840]  day so i tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche this product
[45:28.840 --> 45:31.400]  changed my life but turbo force really changed my life
[45:31.400 --> 45:35.400]  it was a day i no longer take adderall and i get by literally the 13 hours a
[45:35.400 --> 45:38.440]  day i work on a half of a packet of your turbo force
[45:38.440 --> 45:41.800]  and if you take a half a packet that's literally a dollar a day
[45:41.800 --> 45:45.800]  and you save so much money versus you know a monster which is what 499 and
[45:45.800 --> 45:49.000]  you know i just had to call and tell you guys uh how great turbo force is and if
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.880]  anybody's on the fence they really have to try it we're really proud of turbo

[45:55.320 --> 46:00.120]  then help us spread the word let's just get busy infowarstore.com
[46:00.120 --> 46:08.120]  twilight is here the sun is setting on 2019 and we hurdle into the year 2020
[46:08.120 --> 46:13.960]  only 330 days out from this incredibly historic election
[46:13.960 --> 46:16.840]  and it's more important than ever to pray for president trump and to pray for
[46:16.840 --> 46:19.800]  his provision and his protection he's completely surrounded
[46:19.800 --> 46:23.400]  and to pray for him to have discernment and to
[46:23.400 --> 46:27.720]  be bold and to take action and not listen to the advisors that tell him to
[46:27.720 --> 46:30.920]  hold back and that if he goes after the deep state that they'll
[46:30.920 --> 46:34.280]  remove him from office they're trying to remove him
[46:34.280 --> 46:39.080]  regardless because they know that god put him in office
[46:39.080 --> 46:43.160]  and that he's going to continue his work and he's going to continue exposing
[46:43.160 --> 46:46.280]  him and bringing them down but that if he doesn't execute in that
[46:46.280 --> 46:49.480]  office that god's given him that the globalist could win
[46:49.480 --> 46:52.520]  ladies and gentlemen now is the time more than ever to pray for president
[46:52.520 --> 46:55.720]  trump and please pray for him for wars and please pray for all the children
[46:55.720 --> 47:00.280]  being targeted by the globalist thank you and god bless you all
[47:01.800 --> 47:06.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:14.440 --> 47:18.520]  the alex jones show because there is a war on
[47:18.520 --> 47:30.120]  for your mind
[47:30.120 --> 47:35.320]  even your emotions haven't let go in so much space
[47:35.320 --> 47:40.760]  losing your mind and when you're out there thank god i'm crazy
[47:40.760 --> 47:46.440]  and i would have gone insane a long time ago
[47:46.440 --> 47:52.440]  i just knew too much and the whole system is about
[47:52.440 --> 47:57.560]  ridiculing you if you know how things actually work
[47:57.560 --> 48:03.640]  if you study the ruling class and the scientific dictators and the world
[48:03.640 --> 48:09.320]  they're building because it's a world
[48:09.320 --> 48:16.680]  full of ugliness it's a post-human world
[48:16.680 --> 48:19.880]  these globalists think they're in charge
[48:19.880 --> 48:25.720]  but think twice the fact that they think they're in control is a real joke
[48:25.720 --> 48:28.680]  it's like the song says
[48:29.240 --> 48:34.360]  come on now who do you who do you who do you who do you think you are
[48:34.360 --> 48:40.120]  bless your soul you really think you're in control
[48:40.120 --> 48:43.560]  you really think you're in control you really think bill gates
[48:43.560 --> 48:48.040]  is in control well i think you're crazy you think
[48:48.040 --> 48:52.920]  hillary clinton's in control i think you're crazy you think
[48:52.920 --> 48:58.920]  lord roth child's in control no there's a dark force in control of them
[48:58.920 --> 49:05.880]  and that force is not in control of the force
[49:05.880 --> 49:10.120]  and the force is to simply god's will it's not something from
[49:10.120 --> 49:15.320]  the movie star wars and that force has been mathematically proven the will of
[49:15.320 --> 49:20.680]  god holding the universe in his hand
[49:22.760 --> 49:27.000]  all right let's lay it out the rotting edifice that is hillary
[49:27.000 --> 49:32.760]  that is joe biden with his fever dreams of dementia it's so sad when
[49:32.760 --> 49:37.080]  old people even if they're good people start to have a real brain rot
[49:37.080 --> 49:42.200]  and they start saying really nasty gross weird things that don't make sense
[49:42.200 --> 49:45.320]  one day they're fine the next day they're drawing on the walls with feces
[49:45.320 --> 49:49.560]  come back the next day they're okay next week they're cutting their fingers off
[49:49.560 --> 49:54.200]  you know this the type of stuff goes on next day they're walking down the
[49:54.200 --> 49:57.160]  street naked
[49:57.160 --> 50:01.160]  joe biden is degenerating in front of our very eyes like a vampire in a movie
[50:01.160 --> 50:04.280]  that gets caught out in the sun that starts turning into dust in front of
[50:04.280 --> 50:10.520]  you or the skexie death scene throne room
[50:10.520 --> 50:13.960]  scene death of the emperor skexie maybe we can roll that in the background
[50:13.960 --> 50:17.800]  i mean he's crumbling in slow motion in front of us
[50:17.800 --> 50:21.640]  and the system still keeps shoving him in front of us because the globalists are
[50:21.640 --> 50:26.840]  hierarchical and he has served the system and
[50:26.840 --> 50:31.080]  and it's all run by 80 and 90 year old crazy devil worshipers
[50:31.080 --> 50:34.440]  and and so they like seeing joe up there and they don't mind him
[50:34.440 --> 50:39.320]  he's flirting his words and stuff because they are
[50:39.320 --> 50:42.440]  they don't mind all that dandruff on his shoulders
[50:42.440 --> 50:46.920]  they don't mind him calling little black kids roaches that's what they call them
[50:46.920 --> 50:54.440]  in mexico the ruling class called the worker class roaches
[50:54.440 --> 51:00.280]  so this is all emblematic of who they are here's hillary saying oh i'd have to
[51:00.280 --> 51:03.640]  make up my mind really quickly and boy she's right at the edge of
[51:03.640 --> 51:06.520]  that cliff she knows she shouldn't run she knows it's not going to go well but
[51:06.520 --> 51:12.920]  she wants that power my power i am the emperor of mine
[51:12.920 --> 51:18.120]  here she is not yet
[51:18.120 --> 51:23.080]  and then the thawning audience
[51:23.080 --> 51:26.040]  look at webster hubbell's daughter mill is flying
[51:26.040 --> 51:30.040]  could you could step back into the ring yeah i i um
[51:30.040 --> 51:35.400]  i hear that i i especially have been deluged and you know the last few weeks
[51:35.400 --> 51:39.240]  um uh with uh thinking about uh doing that but right now
[51:39.240 --> 51:43.160]  i'm not at all uh you know planning that um
[51:43.160 --> 51:46.680]  i'd have to make up my mind really quickly uh because it's moving
[51:46.680 --> 51:50.600]  very fast but i do want to continue to influence the debate
[51:50.600 --> 51:55.640]  you know i'm not i'm not leaving you know the political arena completely i'm
[51:55.640 --> 52:00.360]  working really hard to uh you know make it clear that
[52:00.360 --> 52:03.800]  we have to hold our current leadership accountable
[52:03.800 --> 52:07.560]  so i'm on twitter i'm not as i think clever uh as
[52:07.560 --> 52:10.680]  chelsea isn't you know dealing with a lot of the undercurrent
[52:10.680 --> 52:14.040]  chelsea god help us i'm out there all the time uh
[52:14.040 --> 52:18.120]  sort of pointing out some of the foolishness and craziness that we are
[52:18.120 --> 52:22.440]  currently experiencing so you know i'm okay so that's good now let's move on
[52:22.440 --> 52:25.560]  this has been out for a week as you know or four or five days
[52:25.560 --> 52:29.400]  but darin mcreen puts some images to it but
[52:29.400 --> 52:33.000]  radio listeners you'll be spared looking at biden here's biden clearly in
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.520]  dementia talking about hairs and roaches and black
[52:36.520 --> 52:40.120]  kids and i love kids he realizes what he just i mean
[52:40.120 --> 52:43.240]  i mean i don't look at black kids and see roaches okay but that's how these
[52:43.240 --> 52:46.120]  folks operate they see kids period they see roaches they want to pull the
[52:46.120 --> 52:49.720]  legs off of uh let's uh go to biden
[52:49.720 --> 52:53.320]  you're on television so be good
[52:54.600 --> 52:58.280]  i said i'm telling you not getting a billion dollars if the prosecutor's not
[52:58.280 --> 53:00.920]  fired you're not getting the money oh son of a
[53:00.920 --> 53:06.920]  bitch got fired no not smile no
[53:06.920 --> 53:11.640]  eight to your thirty you know i sit on the stand
[53:11.640 --> 53:15.080]  and to get hot i got a lot of i got hairy legs
[53:15.080 --> 53:18.680]  that turn that that that that that turned
[53:18.680 --> 53:23.880]  blonde in the sun and the kids used to come up and reach in the pool
[53:23.880 --> 53:28.360]  and rub my leg down so it was straight and then watch the hair
[53:28.360 --> 53:32.840]  come come back up again they look at so i learned about roaches i learned about
[53:32.840 --> 54:00.200]  kids jumping on my lap and i love kids jumping on my lap
[54:00.200 --> 54:04.040]  oh son of a bitch it's called being cut off from god
[54:04.040 --> 54:09.240]  now let's go to this lady video's up on news wars dot com
[54:09.240 --> 54:13.080]  they're at a trump rally this woman comes over starts assaulting him it looks
[54:13.080 --> 54:16.520]  like she's about 89 and she sounds just like mickey
[54:16.520 --> 54:19.720]  mouse this has not been altered she starts hitting people cussing him the
[54:19.720 --> 54:22.200]  police officer says hey they're just having fun leave him alone
[54:22.200 --> 54:26.680]  so she cusses him out and stomps off but the entitlement of the left this is how
[54:26.680 --> 54:29.560]  they act if you go to a leftist rally they're almost all like this lady you're
[54:29.560 --> 54:33.400]  like this lady's a freak show they can be black they can be white
[54:33.400 --> 54:36.040]  they can be old they can be young they can be hispanic
[54:36.040 --> 54:40.040]  they can be asian they all act and look like her but they're mainly white
[54:40.040 --> 54:43.640]  and they're the ruling class they supposedly control things and they're
[54:43.640 --> 54:47.320]  just pissed that their goddess their god hillary
[54:47.320 --> 54:50.840]  didn't get in so old liberal lady with mickey mouse voice
[54:50.840 --> 54:55.640]  screams at trump supporters this is all emblematic of the rotting diseased
[54:55.640 --> 55:07.640]  brains here it is
[55:25.640 --> 55:33.640]  so
[56:03.640 --> 56:07.640]  We love President Trump.
[56:07.640 --> 56:09.640]  I just had a thought, okay?
[56:09.640 --> 56:11.640]  President Trump, thank you for meeting me.
[56:11.640 --> 56:13.640]  I'm going to raise it to keep America free.
[56:13.640 --> 56:15.640]  Please, man, take a seat.
[56:15.640 --> 56:17.640]  Thank you.
[56:17.640 --> 56:19.640]  It's Pete.
[56:19.640 --> 56:21.640]  It's Pete.
[56:21.640 --> 56:23.640]  It's Trump 2020.
[56:23.640 --> 56:25.640]  He loves you.
[56:25.640 --> 56:27.640]  He's fighting America.
[56:27.640 --> 56:31.640]  God bless President Trump and God bless America.
[56:31.640 --> 56:33.640]  Trump 2020.
[56:33.640 --> 56:35.640]  Trump 2020.
[56:35.640 --> 56:37.640]  Four more years.
[56:37.640 --> 56:39.640]  Four more years.
[56:39.640 --> 56:41.640]  Four more years.
[56:41.640 --> 56:43.640]  So, that's what we're facing.
[56:43.640 --> 56:45.640]  Now, they've been trying to hide their supporters.
[56:45.640 --> 56:47.640]  Last election, I mean, we had videos every week
[56:47.640 --> 56:49.640]  with 5, 10 million views.
[56:49.640 --> 56:51.640]  We would just go out and show them and it was just
[56:51.640 --> 56:53.640]  really hilarious, but also sad.
[56:53.640 --> 56:57.640]  Well, now they delete and take down videos everywhere
[56:57.640 --> 56:59.640]  that show the freak show that these people have turned into
[56:59.640 --> 57:01.640]  or maybe they were always like this.
[57:01.640 --> 57:04.640]  But I didn't think we'd find anybody the top
[57:04.640 --> 57:07.640]  age-scree-licks-carl-the-cut-triggly-puff.
[57:07.640 --> 57:10.640]  But, ladies and gentlemen,
[57:10.640 --> 57:12.640]  I mean, I guess this is the evil Mickey Mouse.
[57:12.640 --> 57:14.640]  I mean, I knew that Disney
[57:14.640 --> 57:17.640]  was fully behind the Democrats and Hillary,
[57:17.640 --> 57:20.640]  but my God, this is just over the top.
[57:20.640 --> 57:22.640]  Maybe this woman has been like 120 years old
[57:22.640 --> 57:25.640]  as the original voice of Mickey Mouse.
[57:25.640 --> 57:28.640]  I mean, that could be the case, folks.
[57:28.640 --> 57:30.640]  Stranger things have happened.
[57:30.640 --> 57:33.640]  Maybe it's an MPC in the program matrix
[57:33.640 --> 57:35.640]  and this is all a deep fake
[57:35.640 --> 57:37.640]  and none of this is real because let me tell you,
[57:37.640 --> 57:40.640]  that is frighteningly hilarious.
[57:40.640 --> 57:42.640]  I don't know whether I'm just going to go home,
[57:42.640 --> 57:44.640]  you know, hide in a hole somewhere
[57:44.640 --> 57:45.640]  or die laughing.
[57:45.640 --> 57:47.640]  Second hour, David Ike coming up.
[57:49.640 --> 57:51.640]  It's shocking but true.
[57:51.640 --> 57:54.640]  2019 is almost a memory
[57:54.640 --> 57:57.640]  in the rear view mirror
[57:57.640 --> 57:59.640]  and Cyber Week is here.

[58:16.640 --> 58:18.640]  It is an incredible time to be alive.
[58:18.640 --> 58:20.640]  It's an incredible time to still be on the air
[58:20.640 --> 58:23.640]  where almost everybody else has been shut down and censored.
[58:23.640 --> 58:25.640]  Yes, we were the first to be censored
[58:25.640 --> 58:27.640]  because we're such a threat to the globalists
[58:27.640 --> 58:29.640]  but now, thanks to the infrastructure and your support,
[58:29.640 --> 58:30.640]  we're still on air.
[58:30.640 --> 58:32.640]  But bigger attacks are already happening.

[59:17.640 --> 59:20.640]  and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy,
[59:20.640 --> 59:21.640]  which God wants to see,
[59:21.640 --> 59:24.640]  you see, we have to make the effort.
[59:24.640 --> 59:26.640]  110% God will finish the move.
[59:26.640 --> 59:30.640]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[59:30.640 --> 59:31.640]  I want to attack.
[59:31.640 --> 59:33.640]  I want to go after the globalist.
[59:33.640 --> 59:34.640]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen,
[59:34.640 --> 59:36.640]  that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family
[59:36.640 --> 59:38.640]  to fight for all of our futures together,
[59:38.640 --> 59:40.640]  you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[59:40.640 --> 59:43.640]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us,
[59:43.640 --> 59:45.640]  for myself and my family, for your family.
[59:45.640 --> 59:46.640]  Because we're in this together.
[59:46.640 --> 59:51.640]  infowarstore.com
[59:51.640 --> 59:54.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:54.640 --> 59:57.640]  You really shouldn't be served such a thing in the war.
[1:00:15.640 --> 1:00:17.640]  Land parenthood does more
[1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:22.640]  than just kill babies and sell their body parts.
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:28.140]  For many of us, this idea of transgenderism seems brand-new.
[1:00:28.140 --> 1:00:29.140]  It is male!
[1:00:29.140 --> 1:00:33.640]  But the movement we are seeing today was born a hundred years ago.
[1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:36.640]  The founding fathers of this transgender movement
[1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:40.640]  were of the same culture as the eugenics crowd.
[1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:48.140]  The media push for transgenderism happened 60 years before Bruce Caitlyn Jenner.
[1:00:48.140 --> 1:00:56.640]  In 1952, George Jorgensen became the first American to undergo a sex change operation.
[1:00:56.640 --> 1:00:59.640]  After learning about the procedure in the U.S. Army,
[1:00:59.640 --> 1:01:05.640]  he went to Denmark, where he was given special permissions from the Danish Minister of Justice
[1:01:05.640 --> 1:01:09.640]  to undergo several sexual reassignment operations.
[1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:13.640]  George Jorgensen became Christine Jorgensen
[1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:19.140]  and was instantly taken in by Hollywood and made an advocate for the transgender community.
[1:01:19.140 --> 1:01:27.140]  Her influence through pop culture made transgenderism and sex change operations more normal and acceptable.
[1:01:27.140 --> 1:01:30.140]  We then see it in the universities.
[1:01:30.140 --> 1:01:35.140]  Gender identity research began in 1962 at UCLA
[1:01:35.140 --> 1:01:38.140]  and the Gender Identity Clinic at Johns Hopkins
[1:01:38.140 --> 1:01:43.640]  was performing sex reassignment surgeries by the late 1960s.
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:50.640]  In 1969, the Marshall Tanner study created the term precocious puberty,
[1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:58.640]  which is defined as a disorder and diagnosed when a child shows signs of puberty too soon.
[1:01:58.640 --> 1:02:05.640]  According to the study, too soon is age eight for girls and age nine for boys.
[1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:13.140]  Precocious puberty doesn't physically harm the child and yet it was considered a disorder.
[1:02:13.140 --> 1:02:20.140]  Just two years later came the discovery of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, GNRH,
[1:02:20.140 --> 1:02:24.140]  what we know today as puberty blockers.
[1:02:24.140 --> 1:02:29.140]  And it was immediately prescribed to those diagnosed with precocious puberty
[1:02:29.140 --> 1:02:33.140]  to halt the natural hormonal process in their bodies.
[1:02:33.140 --> 1:02:39.640]  So why? Because two men wrote a paper that suggested it was emotionally bad for children
[1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:43.640]  to undergo puberty before everyone else.
[1:02:43.640 --> 1:02:52.640]  In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association's APA added gender identity disorder into the DSM-3,
[1:02:52.640 --> 1:02:59.640]  which opened the coffers of taxpayer health care funds to pay for sexual reassignment costs.
[1:02:59.640 --> 1:03:04.140]  Without FDA approval or any studies on the drug's long-term effects,
[1:03:04.140 --> 1:03:09.640]  they are injecting Lupron and other brands of puberty blockers into children
[1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:13.640]  and doctors are being paid to prescribe them.
[1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:20.640]  In 2001, the makers of Lupron paid an $875 million settlement to the Department of Justice
[1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:27.140]  for giving illegal kickbacks to doctors in exchange for prescribing Lupron to their patients.
[1:03:27.140 --> 1:03:32.140]  This company is now the sixth largest independent biotech company in the world
[1:03:32.140 --> 1:03:37.640]  with a revenue of over $32 billion in 2018.
[1:03:37.640 --> 1:03:41.640]  The company is also connected with the Clinton Global Initiative
[1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:45.640]  and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:53.640]  In 2007, Boston Children's Hospital began transitioning children as young as three years old.
[1:03:53.640 --> 1:04:00.140]  From 2000 to 2014, gender-affirming surgeries have increased fourfold
[1:04:00.140 --> 1:04:04.140]  and up another 20% the next two years.
[1:04:04.140 --> 1:04:09.140]  Private funding of transgender issues increased eightfold during this time
[1:04:09.140 --> 1:04:15.640]  from the Pritzker family, George Soros, Warren Buffett and others.
[1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:23.140]  The Department of State has allocated over $30 million of taxpayers' money to advance this agenda.
[1:04:23.140 --> 1:04:28.140]  Planned Parenthood is now the second largest provider of gender-affirming.
[1:04:28.140 --> 1:04:32.140]  Okay, folks, we're going to go to break. We're going to come back with David Ike.
[1:04:32.140 --> 1:04:35.140]  But, I mean, look at that report Gregory's just put out.
[1:04:35.140 --> 1:04:39.140]  And that's banned on YouTube, banned everywhere. We're not going to see that anywhere but banned.video.
[1:04:39.140 --> 1:04:44.140]  It's so important. Castration, Incorporated Planned Parenthood, the business of transgenderism,
[1:04:44.140 --> 1:04:47.140]  that needs to be seen by everybody on the planet, especially people with children
[1:04:47.140 --> 1:04:49.140]  being targeted by this post-human agenda.
[1:04:49.140 --> 1:04:53.140]  David Ike has been on the forefront as a vanguard exposing all this.
[1:04:53.140 --> 1:04:57.140]  And we'll talk to him in 60 seconds. Please tell folks to tune in.
[1:04:57.140 --> 1:05:07.140]  Cyber Week is here with the biggest sales of 2019 amazing products that will change your life, guaranteed.
[1:05:07.140 --> 1:05:12.140]  Not only will the products make you healthier, happier, more focused, more energized,
[1:05:12.140 --> 1:05:18.140]  they will fund the Info Wars operation into the critical year of 2020.
[1:05:18.140 --> 1:05:21.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of people notice I've lost weight.
[1:05:21.140 --> 1:05:23.140]  I have more focus. There's more of a sparkle in my eye.
[1:05:23.140 --> 1:05:28.140]  And it's because I've been taking the 8-pack power stack in the morning and at night.
[1:05:28.140 --> 1:05:32.140]  I've been taking X2 and X3. I've been taking Brain Force Plus.
[1:05:32.140 --> 1:05:35.140]  Quite frankly, I can't take Turbo Force. It's just too powerful.
[1:05:35.140 --> 1:05:39.140]  I have been taking the fish oil and the krill oil when I go to sleep at night.
[1:05:39.140 --> 1:05:44.140]  And it's totally energized my life. I know our products work, but I'm like everybody else.
[1:05:44.140 --> 1:05:46.140]  I use them, then I forget about them.
[1:05:46.140 --> 1:05:48.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, these products are amazing.
[1:05:48.140 --> 1:05:54.140]  There's huge sales, triple-patriot points, free shipping, 57% off, importstore.com.
[1:05:54.140 --> 1:06:17.140]  Cyber Week is here.
[1:06:24.140 --> 1:06:29.140]  Before there was Alex Jones on the scene, there was David Ike.
[1:06:29.140 --> 1:06:32.140]  I remember he blasted on the scene in the early 1990s.
[1:06:32.140 --> 1:06:39.140]  He had been a top British broadcasting host of their morning shows, nighttime shows, sports programs.
[1:06:39.140 --> 1:06:45.140]  He was the mainstay of the UK and really around the world.
[1:06:45.140 --> 1:06:56.140]  And then he had a, I guess, Saul on the road to Damascus moment hit by that bolt of light
[1:06:56.140 --> 1:07:04.140]  and suddenly saw a whole different paradigm view of the universe.
[1:07:04.140 --> 1:07:11.140]  And I would read the things David Ike was saying just a few years before I even got on air.
[1:07:11.140 --> 1:07:15.140]  And I thought, well, this is just too far out.
[1:07:15.140 --> 1:07:20.140]  But then as I personally just researched from the news and from white papers and from what was admitted,
[1:07:20.140 --> 1:07:30.140]  as time went on, it more and more lined up with what David Ike had been saying as the future became the present.
[1:07:30.140 --> 1:07:34.140]  And so I know this now.
[1:07:34.140 --> 1:07:42.140]  Whoever's running this, whatever it is, it's anti-human and it's telling us humans are a disease in bad and we need to be taken off the planet.
[1:07:42.140 --> 1:07:49.140]  And that a post-human world is about to be here and that only those that merge with machines will be part of the future.
[1:07:49.140 --> 1:07:55.140]  Now, Ray Kurzweil said that 30 years ago and other transhumanists said that, that come out of the eugenics movement,
[1:07:55.140 --> 1:08:02.140]  that created the whole movement with the trans agenda to give up our humanity.
[1:08:02.140 --> 1:08:11.140]  But as we go down this road and as it becomes out in the open, as it emerges, as David Ike said so long ago, it would finally do,
[1:08:11.140 --> 1:08:15.140]  we learn that it is definitely poisonous.
[1:08:15.140 --> 1:08:17.140]  It's definitely making our lifespan go down.
[1:08:17.140 --> 1:08:20.140]  It's making us be completely mentally ill.
[1:08:20.140 --> 1:08:22.140]  It's causing us to have all these diseases.
[1:08:22.140 --> 1:08:24.140]  It's causing us to be hateful.
[1:08:24.140 --> 1:08:26.140]  It's causing suicide to explode.
[1:08:26.140 --> 1:08:37.140]  And everything they're doing, the white papers come out from Bayer Pharmaceutical and Monsanto and others that they knowingly put out life of state to cause massive cancer in women.
[1:08:37.140 --> 1:08:41.140]  They knowingly put fluoride in the water to lower IQ and destroy fertility.
[1:08:41.140 --> 1:08:42.140]  It's now all admitted.
[1:08:42.140 --> 1:08:50.140]  They knowingly do all of this to stun us like a spider bites its prey, but just enough to stun it, then it winds it up,
[1:08:50.140 --> 1:08:55.140]  waits for the poison over the next few days to liquefy its insides and then sucks it all out.
[1:08:55.140 --> 1:09:00.140]  Well, the spider is now moving towards us to finish the meal.
[1:09:00.140 --> 1:09:04.140]  And that's how David Ike described it as a spider at the center of the web.
[1:09:04.140 --> 1:09:06.140]  So I want to cover the waterfront today.
[1:09:06.140 --> 1:09:09.140]  He's been on hiatus writing books, making films.
[1:09:09.140 --> 1:09:11.140]  I was saying, hey, I've been on a couple of years, why?
[1:09:11.140 --> 1:09:12.140]  He said, I've just had my head down.
[1:09:12.140 --> 1:09:20.140]  Well, he's here now and hopefully he'll come back again soon because two hours with the breaks is not enough to cover every angle.
[1:09:20.140 --> 1:09:24.140]  Now, I didn't know where he'd go with hundreds of pieces of this puzzle.
[1:09:24.140 --> 1:09:31.140]  But he said the global corporate climate takeover and transgenderism as the gateway to transhumanism,
[1:09:31.140 --> 1:09:36.140]  which was in my stack as the first thing I was going to bring up, knowing how key it is without even talking to David.
[1:09:36.140 --> 1:09:37.140]  So we're on the same page there.
[1:09:37.140 --> 1:09:41.140]  But just a big picture.
[1:09:41.140 --> 1:09:49.140]  The globalist Elon Musk was challenging this saying beware those worship AI gods and they want to get rid of humans.
[1:09:49.140 --> 1:09:50.140]  Now he says, oh, take brain chips.
[1:09:50.140 --> 1:09:52.140]  They're coming out next year.
[1:09:52.140 --> 1:09:53.140]  Put them in your kids.
[1:09:53.140 --> 1:09:55.140]  You're going to get to see the other dimensions.
[1:09:55.140 --> 1:09:59.140]  You'll be able to see these entities and he's tweeting images of demons and owls.
[1:09:59.140 --> 1:10:04.140]  And this is a Silicon Valley cult that admits now that they believe that through DMT,
[1:10:04.140 --> 1:10:07.140]  they're in contact with these other realms and entities.
[1:10:07.140 --> 1:10:14.140]  So all of these things you talked about almost 30 years ago are now coming to the surface, David.
[1:10:14.140 --> 1:10:22.140]  So whether it's truly real or not, or whether it's some genetic mass hallucination with the inbred elites and a product of that,
[1:10:22.140 --> 1:10:23.140]  it's still real.
[1:10:23.140 --> 1:10:25.140]  So David, that's my intro.
[1:10:25.140 --> 1:10:28.140]  David.com, your new book is out as well.
[1:10:28.140 --> 1:10:29.140]  I can't wait to read it.
[1:10:29.140 --> 1:10:32.140]  The trigger, the explosive new book by David Ike now available.
[1:10:32.140 --> 1:10:34.140]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[1:10:34.140 --> 1:10:36.140]  You'll have the floor for the next hour and 50 minutes.
[1:10:36.140 --> 1:10:38.140]  Where would you like to start?
[1:10:38.140 --> 1:10:41.140]  Well, Alex, nice to talk to you again.
[1:10:41.140 --> 1:10:46.140]  Glad you're still going after all the all the bands, et cetera.
[1:10:46.140 --> 1:11:03.140]  And we have to keep going because it's starting to dawn on people for the first time in many cases that the scale of what's going on is absolutely vast.
[1:11:03.140 --> 1:11:10.140]  And so often people look at the news and they look at world events.
[1:11:10.140 --> 1:11:17.140]  And they will research this or their research that all of which needs doing.
[1:11:17.140 --> 1:11:23.140]  But there's still dots within a vast picture.
[1:11:23.140 --> 1:11:31.140]  And once you realize what that picture is, then all the dots fall into place.
[1:11:31.140 --> 1:11:39.140]  And I have this phrase I use, know the outcome and you'll see the journey.
[1:11:39.140 --> 1:11:55.140]  And if we can uncover what the outcome is planned to be, then suddenly everything that happens daily in the world that appears to be to most people random and happening in and of itself.
[1:11:55.140 --> 1:12:04.140]  Suddenly, once you know what the planned outcome is, become very clear and blatant steps towards that outcome.
[1:12:04.140 --> 1:12:13.140]  And so if we look at the big picture, and again, you know, as you say, I've been saying this for a very, very long time.
[1:12:13.140 --> 1:12:33.140]  And being ridiculed for it because, you know, if you're going to be a relatively few and you are going to control billions and you are going to direct the society of billions, you have to control the perceptions of the billions.
[1:12:33.140 --> 1:12:41.140]  Because from perception comes behavior. You want to control behavior, you control perception.
[1:12:41.140 --> 1:12:49.140]  And how do you control perception? How do we form perceptions? We form perceptions from information received.
[1:12:49.140 --> 1:12:53.140]  It could be a personal experience. It could be the 10 o'clock news, a Facebook post.
[1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:59.140]  It's information received. We form our perceptions from our perceptions come our behavior.
[1:12:59.140 --> 1:13:05.140]  So in that sequence, first and foremost, control information.
[1:13:05.140 --> 1:13:10.140]  That's what all this censorship is about, and all the bans and all the suppression.
[1:13:10.140 --> 1:13:27.140]  And it's also what the education system is about, which is a massive perceptual programming operation, which starts at a very young age, continues through all the formative years of young people.
[1:13:27.140 --> 1:13:35.140]  This is where all the work stuff is coming out of and then continues through mainstream sources for the rest of a person's life.
[1:13:35.140 --> 1:13:43.140]  A human life is actually a perceptual download of the official version of everything.
[1:13:43.140 --> 1:14:08.140]  And I say that in relation to what we're talking about is the narrow band of information, perception that we're given, what I call the postage stamp consensus, only allows for a tiny, tiny span of possibility.
[1:14:08.140 --> 1:14:18.140]  If you stay within that postage stamp of possibility, the real world mate, then you're, you're all right. You're intelligent.
[1:14:18.140 --> 1:14:22.140]  You are always a good mind. Oh, yeah, he's intelligent man. He is.
[1:14:22.140 --> 1:14:35.140]  But you step off that postage stamp and you start exploring information and areas of life and society that are beyond the postage stamp.
[1:14:35.140 --> 1:14:43.140]  IE people like me saying actually behind all this is a non human force and postage stamp perception.
[1:14:43.140 --> 1:14:49.140]  Well, by reflex action, just like pressing enter on a computer will defend the status quo. We've got to go to break.
[1:14:49.140 --> 1:14:52.140]  But before I even talk to you, we didn't do any pre interview.
[1:14:52.140 --> 1:14:56.140]  David, I said, I want you upfront to go to the end.
[1:14:56.140 --> 1:14:59.140]  And as you're saying, it's critical to go to the end first.
[1:14:59.140 --> 1:15:05.140]  When we come back, I hope you'll go to the end and then we'll go back to the beginning as best your knowledge is.
[1:15:05.140 --> 1:15:10.140]  But now it's everybody knows this is a non human force, whatever it is, and it's out to tell us.
[1:15:10.140 --> 1:15:15.140]  So we got 45 seconds. Please continue.
[1:15:15.140 --> 1:15:25.140]  So people like me, therefore, all these decades have been ridiculed and dismissed for talking about a non human force being behind all this.
[1:15:25.140 --> 1:15:33.140]  And a lot of people who've ridiculed me have been those that follow the Bible and talk about demons.
[1:15:33.140 --> 1:15:36.140]  You've got the Islamic belief system.
[1:15:36.140 --> 1:15:38.140]  We talk about the gin.
[1:15:38.140 --> 1:15:43.140]  You've got the Nostics belief system that talked about the Arkons.
[1:15:43.140 --> 1:15:48.140]  You've got the Zulu belief system that talks about the Chittahuri.
[1:15:48.140 --> 1:15:53.140]  These are all different names for this non human force.
[1:15:53.140 --> 1:15:56.140]  Let's talk about the enemy when we come back with David Ike.

[1:18:22.140 --> 1:18:30.140]  If you want to take action and not listen to the advisors that tell him to hold back and that if he goes after the deep state that they'll remove him from office.
[1:18:30.140 --> 1:18:42.140]  They're trying to remove him regardless because they know that God put him in office and that he's going to continue his work and he's going to continue exposing him and bringing them down.
[1:18:42.140 --> 1:18:47.140]  But that if he doesn't execute in that office that God's given him that the globalist could win.
[1:18:47.140 --> 1:18:55.140]  Ladies and gentlemen now is the time more than ever to pray for President Trump and please pray for him for wars and please pray for all the children being targeted by the globalist.
[1:18:55.140 --> 1:19:18.140]  Thank you and God bless you all.
[1:19:18.140 --> 1:19:27.140]  Folks I live this every day I read the news like nobody else probably and they have been hitting hundreds of congressional candidates and members of Congress.
[1:19:27.140 --> 1:19:36.140]  They've been going after governor state reps it's been a rain of terror last week they wouldn't let Melania Trump images be sent out saying it was hate speech.
[1:19:36.140 --> 1:19:41.140]  Ladies and gentlemen this is beyond censorship it's total information control.
[1:19:41.140 --> 1:19:52.140]  It has to all go through a filter and that's what AI allows is what I call information singularity not empowering information but holding it all in like the one ring of Mordor.
[1:19:52.140 --> 1:19:59.140]  Trump must act now they will steal this election.
[1:19:59.140 --> 1:20:08.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:08.140 --> 1:20:31.140]  Big Brother mainstream media government coverups you want to stop tyranny will so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:31.140 --> 1:20:52.140]  Ladies and gentlemen it is December 3rd 2019 on this live worldwide broadcast.
[1:20:52.140 --> 1:21:06.140]  I'm your host Alex Jones and David Ike is our guest here today and he's got the floor here to talk about this non human force.
[1:21:06.140 --> 1:21:22.140]  That now has the planetary controllers openly saying they're building a post human world ladies and gentlemen a post human world that humans are bad and the environmental movement is going to save the earth from the humans.
[1:21:22.140 --> 1:21:27.140]  And then all that's going to be left is humans that give up their original form.
[1:21:27.140 --> 1:21:32.140]  David Ike thank you for joining us David Ike dot com please continue pleasure.
[1:21:32.140 --> 1:21:43.140]  Well what I've been talking about for the best part of 30 years in terms of this subject is the fact that you can you can track this in different cultures.
[1:21:43.140 --> 1:21:47.140]  This is one of the very compelling things about this.
[1:21:47.140 --> 1:22:04.140]  When you look at the the accounts and the legends and the stories from different cultures all around the world this same common theme is there again and again and again under different names but the theme is the same.
[1:22:04.140 --> 1:22:20.140]  That a non human force came in and started to hijack the human world and their plan is to assimilate human consciousness into itself.
[1:22:20.140 --> 1:22:36.140]  And so you know I am I hear people talk about AI this and AI that and AI the other. I very rarely hear anyone say but what is AI what is it artificial intelligence.
[1:22:36.140 --> 1:22:38.140]  Yeah but what does that mean.
[1:22:38.140 --> 1:22:45.140]  There are different levels obviously there's algorithmic artificial intelligence that's what they call learning artificial intelligence.
[1:22:45.140 --> 1:22:57.140]  Well what I've been saying for years and years and years is there's one level of this artificial intelligence that is actually the force that I'm talking about.
[1:22:57.140 --> 1:23:07.140]  And so when you have Ray Kurzweil as you mentioned and others the utter fraud by the way Elon Musk.
[1:23:07.140 --> 1:23:23.140]  We could talk about him a bit more later maybe they and certainly Kurzweil talks about by 2030 gives that that time period humans will start to have their brains connected to AI.
[1:23:23.140 --> 1:23:34.140]  And the reason that they're so open about it is the sales pitch the sales pitches will become super human we will not we will become sub human and post human.
[1:23:34.140 --> 1:23:42.140]  Because once AI is connected to the human brain and Kurzweil is very open about this.
[1:23:42.140 --> 1:23:52.140]  I'm AI will do more and more and more of human thinking he says until human thinking as we know it now is negligible in the end gone.
[1:23:52.140 --> 1:24:05.140]  And what I've just described just by quoting him is the assimilation of human consciousness the end of the human mind as we know it.
[1:24:05.140 --> 1:24:15.140]  So instead of having to manipulate information to dictate perception which dictates behavior through this AI connection.
[1:24:15.140 --> 1:24:23.140]  No need for any of that because our thoughts and what passed within our emotional responses will be coming direct.
[1:24:23.140 --> 1:24:26.140]  This is what it's all about.
[1:24:26.140 --> 1:24:33.140]  And what's happened is what I call the totalitarian tiptoe step by step by step.
[1:24:33.140 --> 1:24:44.140]  We have been infiltrated by artificial intelligence which is doing more and more of what humans used to do taking over more and more of human society.
[1:24:44.140 --> 1:24:50.140]  And of course people like me and I'm 67 born in 1952.
[1:24:50.140 --> 1:24:52.140]  I have a radar.
[1:24:52.140 --> 1:24:54.140]  I know what it was like before.
[1:24:54.140 --> 1:24:57.140]  And I can see what it's like now in comparison.
[1:24:57.140 --> 1:25:02.140]  The young people and the kids being born today this is all they know.
[1:25:02.140 --> 1:25:09.140]  This is reality to them this technological AI insanity.
[1:25:09.140 --> 1:25:24.140]  And the idea was why they're targeting the young why they've got the young addicted to smartphones which they hold then addicted to things on their body like your smart watches and your Bluetooth and all the rest of it.
[1:25:24.140 --> 1:25:32.140]  And the next stage which is already underway getting in the body this step by step by step kitty kitty here kitty kitty kitty.
[1:25:32.140 --> 1:25:46.140]  The reason why they're doing this technique is because the young people that they're targeting now will be the adults when they want to bring this in full blown and they want the young.
[1:25:46.140 --> 1:25:59.140]  So addicted to technology that they will accept the outcome because they've got to get the next version and let's let's talk about that because this is all admitted now.
[1:25:59.140 --> 1:26:06.140]  I talked about it 25 years ago. It's all admitted that they're making humans obsolete and the AI is already making all the decisions.
[1:26:06.140 --> 1:26:13.140]  It doesn't ask and interfaces from the phone into your car tells you when you need gas even before the car blinks on and tells you you need gas.
[1:26:13.140 --> 1:26:15.140]  People don't know how to do math anymore.
[1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.140]  People don't know how to communicate.
[1:26:17.140 --> 1:26:18.140]  The language is shrinking.
[1:26:18.140 --> 1:26:19.140]  We're dying.
[1:26:19.140 --> 1:26:22.140]  This isn't empowering us like Elon Musk says it will.
[1:26:22.140 --> 1:26:24.140]  It's killing us and he said it a few months ago.
[1:26:24.140 --> 1:26:29.140]  He said the AI won't take over your brain right away and then started laughing.
[1:26:29.140 --> 1:26:32.140]  His eyes are all whacked out. His pupils are giant.
[1:26:32.140 --> 1:26:34.140]  Tim Cook's pupils are giant.
[1:26:34.140 --> 1:26:36.140]  I know a lot of military's already gotten brain chips.
[1:26:36.140 --> 1:26:40.140]  I told people that 15 years ago was declassified 10 years ago from the Intel.
[1:26:40.140 --> 1:26:51.140]  I've got a lot of these guys already have chips and are also on a lot of drugs and that goes into the whole culture of Silicon Valley and convincing people to give up their humanity.
[1:26:51.140 --> 1:26:55.140]  Well, Elon Musk is a total fraud. I've been pointing him out for a long time.
[1:26:55.140 --> 1:27:01.140]  You know, when you come out and you say that AI could be the end of humanity.
[1:27:01.140 --> 1:27:03.140]  Brackets true.
[1:27:03.140 --> 1:27:08.140]  And then you start a company called Neuralink to connect the human brain to computers.
[1:27:08.140 --> 1:27:17.140]  When this smart grid, which is what the human mind and technology and everything through the Internet of Things, etc.
[1:27:17.140 --> 1:27:26.140]  is designed to be connected to, this smart grid is absolutely essential to this AI takeover of the human mind.
[1:27:26.140 --> 1:27:28.140]  It's all connected.
[1:27:28.140 --> 1:27:42.140]  And if you are going to have a global grid, a global bubble, artificial bubble, which you are going to connect everyone to,
[1:27:42.140 --> 1:27:50.140]  then things like Wi-Fi and the Internet have to be on every inch of the planet.
[1:27:50.140 --> 1:27:55.140]  It has to be. No one excluded. That's the idea of this grid.
[1:27:55.140 --> 1:28:00.140]  And this is the site of the AI system that interfaces the humans and absorbs us.
[1:28:00.140 --> 1:28:08.140]  And Google admitted when they were founded 25 years ago, their plan was to build an AI human interface where we are part of the AI.
[1:28:08.140 --> 1:28:16.140]  Just as Arthur C. Clarke envisioned, and then he wrote Childhood's End about us being uploaded into the mothership, but giving up our bodies.
[1:28:16.140 --> 1:28:22.140]  And now they're saying Childhood's End is real and that that's the plan they want us to carry out.
[1:28:22.140 --> 1:28:25.140]  Yeah, I mean, this wasn't decided yesterday.
[1:28:25.140 --> 1:28:32.140]  Of course, it goes way, way, way, way back into what we perceive as history.
[1:28:32.140 --> 1:28:44.140]  But where I was going with this is that the only way you're going to cover the entire planet with the cloud, as Kurzweil thought it, is from space.
[1:28:44.140 --> 1:28:52.140]  And here we have the same Elon Musk through his SpaceX that's sending up all the satellites.
[1:28:52.140 --> 1:29:03.140]  Stay there, David Ike. You're on fire, David Ike.
[1:29:22.140 --> 1:29:25.140]  That's Black RifleRealEstate.com.
[1:29:53.140 --> 1:29:58.140]  It's shocking, but true.
[1:29:58.140 --> 1:30:04.140]  2019 is almost a memory in the rear view mirror.
[1:30:04.140 --> 1:30:09.140]  And Cyber Week is here, the best deals of the year.
[1:30:09.140 --> 1:30:14.140]  Store-wide free shipping, triple Patriot points for the first time ever, 50 to 70% off.
[1:30:14.140 --> 1:30:17.140]  Many of these products are lost leaders.
[1:30:17.140 --> 1:30:23.140]  We are only 330 days out from the 2020 election.
[1:30:23.140 --> 1:30:25.140]  It is an incredible time to be alive.
[1:30:25.140 --> 1:30:29.140]  It's an incredible time to still be on the air where almost everybody else has been shut down and censored.
[1:30:29.140 --> 1:30:33.140]  Yes, we were the first to be censored because we're such a threat to the globalists.
[1:30:33.140 --> 1:30:36.140]  But now, thanks to the infrastructure and your support, we're still on air.
[1:30:36.140 --> 1:30:40.140]  But bigger attacks are already happening, more are coming.
[1:30:40.140 --> 1:30:46.140]  So please, spread the word about the broadcast and funder operation while getting great products out there.
[1:30:46.140 --> 1:30:50.140]  And while getting great products at the same time, a true 360 win.
[1:30:50.140 --> 1:30:55.140]  Cyber Week is here. Get those Christmas presents for you and your family today at mfoldwarstore.com.
[1:30:58.140 --> 1:31:02.140]  Cyber Week is here with the biggest sales of 2019.
[1:31:02.140 --> 1:31:06.140]  No sales in our history can even approach this.
[1:31:06.140 --> 1:31:08.140]  Triple Patriot points.
[1:31:08.140 --> 1:31:12.140]  Store-wide free shipping, 50 to 70% off.
[1:31:12.140 --> 1:31:20.140]  And when you add auto-ship to it on the order, a lot of these products become lost leaders,
[1:31:20.140 --> 1:31:25.140]  meaning I'm losing money on them, but bringing in capital so I can fund ourselves into next year.
[1:31:25.140 --> 1:31:29.140]  It is critical for folks to take advantage of these sales.
[1:31:29.140 --> 1:31:34.140]  If you've ever been on the fence trying some of the products like the protein bars or turbo force and the fish oil,
[1:31:34.140 --> 1:31:39.140]  now is the time we've got huge specials on DNA Force Plus, our flagship product,
[1:31:39.140 --> 1:31:42.140]  with a free bottle of Brain Force Plus with it.
[1:31:42.140 --> 1:31:47.140]  It's all available at mfoldwarstore.com during Cyber Week.
[1:31:47.140 --> 1:31:49.140]  Now, a lot of these sales will continue through Christmas,
[1:31:49.140 --> 1:31:52.140]  but some of them have to end because the products are selling out.
[1:31:52.140 --> 1:31:56.140]  mfoldwarstore.com funds the Mfold War. Thank you.
[1:31:56.140 --> 1:32:01.140]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate Mfold Wars,
[1:32:01.140 --> 1:32:08.140]  it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[1:32:08.140 --> 1:32:13.140]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans
[1:32:13.140 --> 1:32:18.140]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[1:32:18.140 --> 1:32:23.140]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[1:32:23.140 --> 1:32:26.140]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side,
[1:32:26.140 --> 1:32:29.140]  and they do what they do because they're slaves,
[1:32:29.140 --> 1:32:34.140]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[1:32:34.140 --> 1:32:38.140]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves,
[1:32:38.140 --> 1:32:44.140]  but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[1:32:44.140 --> 1:32:49.140]  They fear the fact that we are awake, they fear the fact that we are alive,
[1:32:49.140 --> 1:32:52.140]  they fear the fact that we love God,
[1:32:52.140 --> 1:33:08.140]  and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[1:33:23.140 --> 1:33:30.140]  I'm not normally standing on my feet when I have a guest on,
[1:33:30.140 --> 1:33:37.140]  but more and more I'm standing up during the broadcast to symbolize that we're not in Kansas anymore.
[1:33:37.140 --> 1:33:43.140]  The fight for human consciousness, the war on for our mind is intensifying.
[1:33:43.140 --> 1:33:46.140]  David Ike is here.
[1:33:46.140 --> 1:33:48.140]  DavidIke.com needs no introduction.
[1:33:48.140 --> 1:33:53.140]  He's laying out the total takeover, the post-human world, the addiction to the phones,
[1:33:53.140 --> 1:33:57.140]  the devices like a face sucker now entering our body.
[1:33:57.140 --> 1:34:02.140]  All the major sites, all the major tech companies are coming out with competing brain chips.
[1:34:02.140 --> 1:34:05.140]  Facebook, Google, they've already got the devices on our homes spying on us.
[1:34:05.140 --> 1:34:12.140]  Suddenly, they admit what we were telling you decades ago that they would put these devices in your homes
[1:34:12.140 --> 1:34:15.140]  and then spy on you, and it's all admitted.
[1:34:15.140 --> 1:34:17.140]  Now they've moved on to brain chips for you and your family.
[1:34:17.140 --> 1:34:19.140]  Now, pedophilia is being normalized.
[1:34:19.140 --> 1:34:21.140]  What's it all about?
[1:34:21.140 --> 1:34:25.140]  David Ike pioneered exposing the pedophilia running the British government,
[1:34:25.140 --> 1:34:26.140]  how it was spreading worldwide.
[1:34:26.140 --> 1:34:27.140]  Now that's all out in the open.
[1:34:27.140 --> 1:34:32.140]  I want him to lay it out for you here today and how we can reverse this.
[1:34:32.140 --> 1:34:33.140]  And there is a huge awakening.
[1:34:33.140 --> 1:34:35.140]  There isn't just evil in the universe.
[1:34:35.140 --> 1:34:36.140]  There's good.
[1:34:36.140 --> 1:34:43.140]  And so how do we expose this and fight this and what is the good path into the future
[1:34:43.140 --> 1:34:47.140]  versus where this non-human, anti-human force wants to take us?
[1:34:47.140 --> 1:34:52.140]  Where is that place versus where we could go?
[1:34:52.140 --> 1:34:54.140]  David Ike.
[1:34:54.140 --> 1:35:02.140]  Well, I could just finish what I was saying before the break, Alex, about Elon Musk.
[1:35:02.140 --> 1:35:09.140]  If you're going to cover every inch of the planet with this cloud, which you're going to connect the human brain to,
[1:35:09.140 --> 1:35:13.140]  then you've got to do it from space.
[1:35:13.140 --> 1:35:17.140]  And it's Elon Musk again, who through SpaceX is putting all these satellites up.
[1:35:17.140 --> 1:35:30.140]  And there's meant to be tens of thousands of them eventually that are beaming Wi-Fi and 5G at the entirety of the planet.
[1:35:30.140 --> 1:35:41.140]  And the end game in all this is to create a technological sub-reality which humans are connected to
[1:35:41.140 --> 1:35:54.140]  and will be no more than computer terminals on this internet and this manufactured internet of control, the smart grid.
[1:35:54.140 --> 1:36:05.140]  And one of the other things that I've been saying over the years is that this non-human force operates beyond the human frequency band.
[1:36:05.140 --> 1:36:15.140]  Because again, if you just take the postage stamp consensus version of possibility that we're given from cradle to grave,
[1:36:15.140 --> 1:36:22.140]  then people will think that when they look through their eyes, they're seeing everything there is in the space they're looking at.
[1:36:22.140 --> 1:36:30.140]  But they're not. It's tiny the band of frequency that we have for visual sight.
[1:36:30.140 --> 1:36:41.140]  Tiny. According to mainstream science, the electromagnetic spectrum is 0.005% of what exists in the universe.
[1:36:41.140 --> 1:36:51.140]  Visible light, which is the only tiny band of frequency that we can see, is a smear of the 0.005%.
[1:36:51.140 --> 1:36:58.140]  So the virtual entirety of existence in infinite existence is denied to us.
[1:36:58.140 --> 1:37:03.140]  We cannot see it because this vehicle will not decode it.
[1:37:03.140 --> 1:37:11.140]  It's like being tuned to a radio or television station and it can see and experience only that station.
[1:37:11.140 --> 1:37:16.140]  I can't switch the channel. We can, but most people don't.
[1:37:16.140 --> 1:37:22.140]  And this force is operating outside of the human frequency band.
[1:37:22.140 --> 1:37:37.140]  And so to manipulate within the human frequency band, they've had to create a network of bloodlines and secret societies to manipulate human society on behalf of this force.
[1:37:37.140 --> 1:37:50.140]  And this is what the Satanists are interacting with in their rituals. They're interacting with this non-human force operating outside the human frequency band.
[1:37:50.140 --> 1:37:58.140]  And so when people talk about bloodlines, of course, royalty goes back. I mean, royalty.
[1:37:58.140 --> 1:38:04.140]  What is royalty? Oh, it's bloodline. All right. What's our riskocracy? Oh, it's bloodline. What does that mean?
[1:38:04.140 --> 1:38:12.140]  To breed? Yeah, but why did they had to breed? Why have these bloodlines been so obsessed with interbreeding since the ancient world?
[1:38:12.140 --> 1:38:18.140]  For a long time, they called it royal and aristocratic. They still do in Britain staggeringly.
[1:38:18.140 --> 1:38:25.140]  We have a head of state in Britain, the queen, and her Adams family children.
[1:38:25.140 --> 1:38:41.140]  And David, let me briefly interject on this. We now know what was hypothesized hundreds of years ago that birds, insects, but also humans have cone cells in the brain that are able to pick up the magnetic line.
[1:38:41.140 --> 1:38:52.140]  So that's how geese can fly north in the summer south in the winter. That's how hummingbirds can fly from North America, 3,000 miles, 4,000 miles of South America along those magnetic lines.
[1:38:52.140 --> 1:39:01.140]  And so the royalty is interbreeding to, again, develop receptors in the brain that are already there, but to intensify those, to pick up a certain interdimensional frequency.
[1:39:01.140 --> 1:39:10.140]  And the reason I say this is studying skull and bones, reading secret documents that Anthony Sutton got from Charlotte, Israel, and others.
[1:39:10.140 --> 1:39:15.140]  That's why they're doing this. They believe, they call it spiritualism, that they're interfacing with these entities.
[1:39:15.140 --> 1:39:25.140]  But really, it's, again, just electromagnetic through this galactic internet. And you're absolutely right that now the globalists admit that they are communicating with entities more and more.
[1:39:25.140 --> 1:39:33.140]  And they're rolling it out at the university research level, and people taking DMT and other drugs, intervenously, are going in and out mapping these dimensions.
[1:39:33.140 --> 1:39:42.140]  And now they're trying to externalize that method that I heard about when I was a kid, because I just happened to be at the dinner table with some researchers that had been involved in it.
[1:39:42.140 --> 1:39:47.140]  And they were telling my parents about it. I'm just going to leave it at that. But I'm a kid hearing about this, and it just sounds completely fantastical.
[1:39:47.140 --> 1:39:52.140]  Then you forget about it for a long time. But my parents had some friends that were in research science in San Francisco.
[1:39:52.140 --> 1:39:57.140]  And that seems to be one of the main epicenters of the research in this post-human world.
[1:39:57.140 --> 1:40:01.140]  So you're talking about all this, but now they say they want a post-human world.
[1:40:01.140 --> 1:40:06.140]  Now they say humanity is about to be obsolete in BC News. They now say we're going to merge with machines.
[1:40:06.140 --> 1:40:16.140]  They now say that we are the robots. So yes, this is their admitted plans. I wanted to ask you, why are they now suddenly admitting so much of the plan after denying it for so long?
[1:40:16.140 --> 1:40:26.140]  And as you said, they're putting in the 5G systems that literally will slowly kill our humanity while they control us as biological androids.
[1:40:26.140 --> 1:40:36.140]  What they've done with the technological agenda is that they are selling it as a wonderful thing.
[1:40:36.140 --> 1:40:46.140]  The more and more we allow technology to become part of us, the more it will be like gods and all this nonsense.
[1:40:46.140 --> 1:40:55.140]  It's the sales pitch. See, there comes a point where you can't hide it anymore because it's so obvious.
[1:40:55.140 --> 1:41:08.140]  So for a long time, you keep your plan secret because you don't want to give people a long period of preparation of knowing where it's going.
[1:41:08.140 --> 1:41:09.140]  To find the resistance.
[1:41:09.140 --> 1:41:25.140]  So what you then do is you get close to your endgame and when you get close to your endgame, so many things are going into place that really anyone with half a brain cell on active duty could see it.
[1:41:25.140 --> 1:41:35.140]  So what you do when it becomes visible because it has to be, if it's going to become what society is, then you start selling it as a good thing and a wonderful thing.
[1:41:35.140 --> 1:41:40.140]  This is why we've had this shift.
[1:41:40.140 --> 1:41:48.140]  It's selling this Orwellian technological nightmare as a wonderful thing.
[1:41:48.140 --> 1:41:53.140]  I'll tell you another part of this.
[1:41:53.140 --> 1:41:59.140]  The Green Party in Britain had its conference a few weeks ago.
[1:41:59.140 --> 1:42:12.140]  Some people in the Green Party only a few, unfortunately, wanted a debate at that conference on 5G and the Green Party hierarchy turned it down.
[1:42:12.140 --> 1:42:23.140]  And when one or two of the people protested outside that this debate had been denied, a security guard came out and said that if they didn't go away, that they'd call the police.
[1:42:23.140 --> 1:42:26.140]  This is where the Green Movement has gone now.
[1:42:26.140 --> 1:42:27.140]  It's become the climate.
[1:42:27.140 --> 1:42:30.140]  By the way, you were the leader of that, what, 30-something years ago.
[1:42:30.140 --> 1:42:31.140]  Stay there, David Ike.
[1:42:31.140 --> 1:42:38.140]  When we come back, we're going to lay this out, the compartmentalization, and where the globalist endgame goes, the post-human endgame.
[1:42:38.140 --> 1:42:47.140]  Even if you don't believe it's aliens, folks, random dimensionals, whatever you want to call them, the globalists say the post-human world's here and that you're all dead and I'm dead while they slowly kill us.
[1:42:47.140 --> 1:42:50.140]  Well, I'm angry and I'm awake and I'm going to do something about it.
[1:42:50.140 --> 1:42:51.140]  What are you going to do?
[1:42:51.140 --> 1:42:53.140]  David Ike's, our guest, DavidIke.com.
[1:42:53.140 --> 1:42:56.140]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:42:56.140 --> 1:42:58.140]  Twilight is here.
[1:42:58.140 --> 1:43:10.140]  The sun is setting on 2019 and we hurdle into the year 2020, only 330 days out from this incredibly historic election.
[1:43:10.140 --> 1:43:15.140]  And it's more important than ever to pray for President Trump and to pray for his provision and his protection.
[1:43:15.140 --> 1:43:25.140]  He's completely surrounded and to pray for him to have discernment and to be bold and to take action and not listen to the advisors that tell him to hold back
[1:43:25.140 --> 1:43:35.140]  that if he goes after the deep state that they'll remove him from office, they're trying to remove him regardless because they know that God put him in office
[1:43:35.140 --> 1:43:41.140]  and that he's going to continue his work and he's going to continue exposing them and bringing them down.
[1:43:41.140 --> 1:43:46.140]  But that if he doesn't execute in that office that God's given him, that the globalist could win.
[1:43:46.140 --> 1:43:53.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time more than ever to pray for President Trump and please pray for him for wars and please pray for all the children being targeted by the globalist.
[1:43:53.140 --> 1:43:55.140]  Thank you and God bless you all.
[1:44:23.140 --> 1:44:24.140]  And so it's very simple.
[1:44:24.140 --> 1:44:31.140]  If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort.
[1:44:31.140 --> 1:44:34.140]  110% God will finish the move.
[1:44:34.140 --> 1:44:38.140]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[1:44:38.140 --> 1:44:39.140]  I want to attack.
[1:44:39.140 --> 1:44:45.140]  I want to go after the globalists and just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together,
[1:44:45.140 --> 1:44:53.140]  you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game. I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family.
[1:44:53.140 --> 1:45:16.140]  Let's get those together. InfowarsStore.com.
[1:45:24.140 --> 1:45:28.140]  And it's because I've been taking the eight pack power stack in the morning and at night.
[1:45:28.140 --> 1:45:30.140]  I've been taking X2 and X3.
[1:45:30.140 --> 1:45:32.140]  I've been taking Brain Force Plus.
[1:45:32.140 --> 1:45:34.140]  Quite frankly, I can't take Turbo Force.
[1:45:34.140 --> 1:45:35.140]  It's just too powerful.
[1:45:35.140 --> 1:45:42.140]  I have been taking the fish oil and the krill oil when I go to sleep at night and it's totally energized my life.
[1:45:42.140 --> 1:45:44.140]  I know our products work, but I'm like everybody else.
[1:45:44.140 --> 1:45:46.140]  I use them, then I forget about them.
[1:45:46.140 --> 1:45:48.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, these products are amazing.
[1:45:48.140 --> 1:45:56.140]  There's huge sales, triple patriot points, free shipping, 57% off. InfowarsStore.com. Cyber Week is here.
[1:45:56.140 --> 1:45:59.140]  My phone has been ringing off the hook.
[1:45:59.140 --> 1:46:01.140]  Dozens and dozens of people have called me.
[1:46:01.140 --> 1:46:03.140]  I've gotten all these text messages.
[1:46:03.140 --> 1:46:05.140]  The office phone's ringing off the hook.
[1:46:05.140 --> 1:46:07.140]  Emails are flooding in.
[1:46:07.140 --> 1:46:09.140]  They're saying, can you believe it?
[1:46:09.140 --> 1:46:15.140]  300 Trump ads that were going to run tens of millions of times were pulled by Google.
[1:46:15.140 --> 1:46:18.140]  And then it turns out it was done over the summer.
[1:46:18.140 --> 1:46:20.140]  Folks, I live this every day.
[1:46:20.140 --> 1:46:23.140]  I read the news like nobody else probably.
[1:46:23.140 --> 1:46:27.140]  And they have been hitting hundreds of congressional candidates and members of Congress.
[1:46:27.140 --> 1:46:29.140]  They've been going after governors, state reps.
[1:46:29.140 --> 1:46:31.140]  It's been a reign of terror.
[1:46:31.140 --> 1:46:36.140]  Last week they wouldn't let Melania Trump images be sent out saying it was hate speech.
[1:46:36.140 --> 1:46:39.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is beyond censorship.
[1:46:39.140 --> 1:46:41.140]  It's total information control.
[1:46:41.140 --> 1:46:47.140]  It has to all go through a filter, and that's what AI allows, is what I call information singularity.
[1:46:47.140 --> 1:46:52.140]  Not empowering information, but holding it all in like the one ring of Mordor.
[1:46:52.140 --> 1:47:15.140]  Trump must act now or they will steal this election.
[1:47:23.140 --> 1:47:29.140]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:47:29.140 --> 1:47:41.140]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:41.140 --> 1:47:43.140]  This is not a simulation.
[1:47:43.140 --> 1:47:45.140]  This is not a drill.
[1:47:45.140 --> 1:47:48.140]  Or as I've said, the simulation is real.
[1:47:48.140 --> 1:47:52.140]  But all these big top CEOs, the head of Bank of America came out here and said,
[1:47:52.140 --> 1:47:54.140]  this is all a simulation.
[1:47:54.140 --> 1:47:56.140]  Something's holding it in place.
[1:47:56.140 --> 1:47:58.140]  We're enslaved by something.
[1:47:58.140 --> 1:48:02.140]  And they've got the dark matter studies and the mathematics equation showing that there's a force
[1:48:02.140 --> 1:48:06.140]  many times more powerful than this reality, holding it in place artificially.
[1:48:06.140 --> 1:48:08.140]  What's really going on?
[1:48:08.140 --> 1:48:17.140]  I read David Ike's books, I don't know, like 26, 27 years ago, where he was talking about just that.
[1:48:17.140 --> 1:48:23.140]  So whatever humans can theoretically think of, we end up finding out actually exist.
[1:48:23.140 --> 1:48:25.140]  What a wild universe.
[1:48:25.140 --> 1:48:26.140]  Who are the players?
[1:48:26.140 --> 1:48:34.140]  Well, the ruling class have a good idea who the players are and they're keeping us away from knowing that.
[1:48:34.140 --> 1:48:39.140]  But all the ancient cultures and the Bible, the Old Andean Testament give you a pretty clear idea
[1:48:39.140 --> 1:48:41.140]  and it matches up with what other cultures said.
[1:48:41.140 --> 1:48:47.140]  And now, towards the end game, world government, Mark of the Beast, the Chinese Communist Social Score,
[1:48:47.140 --> 1:48:52.140]  the UN came out, it's in Reuters today, and said the Chinese communists are running the global standardization
[1:48:52.140 --> 1:48:58.140]  of face scanning for a world ID to access the internet.
[1:48:58.140 --> 1:49:04.140]  And all this stuff's been building very slowly, but now more is happening in a week than what happened in six months.
[1:49:04.140 --> 1:49:07.140]  Then more is going to happen in a day than what happened in a year.
[1:49:07.140 --> 1:49:08.140]  It's a quickening.
[1:49:08.140 --> 1:49:10.140]  It's an acceleration. David Ike's here.
[1:49:10.140 --> 1:49:12.140]  And you need to get his books.
[1:49:12.140 --> 1:49:14.140]  They'll definitely get people thinking.
[1:49:14.140 --> 1:49:19.140]  I'm not even saying I agree with all of it, but I'm very, very open to it because I respect David Ike.
[1:49:19.140 --> 1:49:22.140]  And I'd say about 90% of what he's talked about has turned out to be accurate.
[1:49:22.140 --> 1:49:26.140]  He is a maverick, a man before his time.
[1:49:26.140 --> 1:49:28.140]  That's coming to you from somebody who's a man before his time.
[1:49:28.140 --> 1:49:31.140]  Obviously, you're an audience of activists before your time.
[1:49:31.140 --> 1:49:33.140]  We aren't just following globalist scripts.
[1:49:33.140 --> 1:49:38.140]  We are the vanguard and we need to remember that and understand that.
[1:49:38.140 --> 1:49:42.140]  The trigger, the explosive new book by David Ike is available at DavidIke.com.
[1:49:42.140 --> 1:49:44.140]  We'll talk more about that in the next hour with him.
[1:49:44.140 --> 1:49:47.140]  Please don't forget, we've got Cyber Monday.
[1:49:47.140 --> 1:49:51.140]  It's being a cyber sales going right now.
[1:49:51.140 --> 1:49:54.140]  These are the biggest sales of the year so far.
[1:49:54.140 --> 1:49:56.140]  And we've got 15 new bumper stickers in.
[1:49:56.140 --> 1:50:03.140]  Every order gets an assortment of those to help spread the word and help trigger the leftist and control freaks.
[1:50:03.140 --> 1:50:08.140]  And we've got just huge sales with free bottles of Brain Force Plus, the great healthy Neutropic,
[1:50:08.140 --> 1:50:13.140]  with DNA Force Plus, 50% off that cleans out your cells, helps your telomeres last longer.
[1:50:13.140 --> 1:50:19.140]  DNA Force, the PQQ CoQ10, Survival Shield X2 and X3 get that 50% off the free bottle of Brain Force Plus.
[1:50:19.140 --> 1:50:23.140]  And then all these other products are back in stock, Krill Oil, the highest quality.
[1:50:23.140 --> 1:50:25.140]  Wow, talk about psychedelic.

[1:50:37.140 --> 1:50:38.140]  I'm not going to go through it all.
[1:50:38.140 --> 1:50:41.140]  Just check it out today in FullWarStore.com.
[1:50:41.140 --> 1:50:44.140]  Because they are trying to shut us down as you've seen.
[1:50:44.140 --> 1:50:49.140]  They're really pissed off that you keep spreading the word because they know as their plan emerges,
[1:50:49.140 --> 1:50:56.140]  as it all gets admitted, world government, pedophilia as the world religion, vampirism, Satanism out in the open.
[1:50:56.140 --> 1:51:01.140]  As all of this comes out, as the Epstein comes out, as all the Royal Family Devil worship comes out,
[1:51:01.140 --> 1:51:04.140]  the Jimmy Savelle stuff comes out.
[1:51:04.140 --> 1:51:07.140]  As it all comes out, our credibility's got to go up.
[1:51:07.140 --> 1:51:14.140]  So they've got to have a silenced or a forgotten or they need to silence us so they can build a strong man and put words in our mouth.
[1:51:14.140 --> 1:51:16.140]  But we're not silenced. David Ike isn't silenced.
[1:51:16.140 --> 1:51:21.140]  So David, please continue with the big agenda where they're taking us and how we counter it.
[1:51:21.140 --> 1:51:29.140]  And then I want to get into the Satanism, the pedophilia of the Royal Family because you've been a trailblazer exposing that.
[1:51:29.140 --> 1:51:37.140]  Yeah, well, as I was saying before the break, the Green Party doesn't want to know and the climate cult in general,
[1:51:37.140 --> 1:51:40.140]  which is what the Green Party's become, unfortunately.
[1:51:40.140 --> 1:51:46.140]  They don't want to know about challenging 5G and this whole technological agenda.
[1:51:46.140 --> 1:51:48.140]  And the break interrupted you and so did I.
[1:51:48.140 --> 1:51:53.140]  Go back to the some people wanted to raise it at the conference, so they were threatening to call the police on them.
[1:51:53.140 --> 1:51:55.140]  The environmentalists now want radiation.
[1:51:55.140 --> 1:51:59.140]  They want 5G. Top environmentalists say get rid of humans.
[1:51:59.140 --> 1:52:02.140]  Radiation's good.
[1:52:02.140 --> 1:52:14.140]  Well, the reason that they are supporting this stuff is that it is being sold to them as a way of overcoming climate change and saving the planet.
[1:52:14.140 --> 1:52:32.140]  And this whole climate hoax is a fundamental key to the justification of almost everything, not just this whole technological agenda,
[1:52:32.140 --> 1:52:41.140]  but what goes with it, which is the centralization of global power over the fine detail of our lives.
[1:52:41.140 --> 1:52:51.140]  And so you need an excuse to centralize power to dictate the fine detail of people's lives.
[1:52:51.140 --> 1:52:57.140]  And this climate hoax is what they've chosen to do it through.
[1:52:57.140 --> 1:53:07.140]  So if you start looking now as this climate cult agenda gets faster and faster and more expansive,
[1:53:07.140 --> 1:53:22.140]  all the different elements that this cult wants, the big cult wants, the global cult wants are being justified by saving the planet from climate change,
[1:53:22.140 --> 1:53:26.140]  not least massive centralization of power.
[1:53:26.140 --> 1:53:32.140]  And what's happened and will go back to this postage stamp consensus.
[1:53:32.140 --> 1:53:42.140]  Recent generations have had that postage stamp squeezed and squeezed as they've gone through the education system or what passes for it.
[1:53:42.140 --> 1:53:49.140]  And not only have they had their perceptions of reality, the world, etc. downloaded.
[1:53:49.140 --> 1:53:58.140]  There has been a political agenda relating not least to the climate cult and all that they want to unfold because of it.
[1:53:58.140 --> 1:54:07.140]  There's been going through the schools, the sexuality, the gender agenda is going through the schools as well, being forced on kids.
[1:54:07.140 --> 1:54:09.140]  And what we're now seeing.
[1:54:09.140 --> 1:54:20.140]  It's totally massive in public schools, private schools, colleges, down to five year olds in kindergarten, teaching children to masturbate, sexualizing the men and girls restrooms.
[1:54:20.140 --> 1:54:23.140]  What is the end game of this full on assault?
[1:54:23.140 --> 1:54:30.140]  Well, this is all an expression of this squeezing of the postage stamp.
[1:54:30.140 --> 1:54:45.140]  They are indoctrinating and manipulating the minds of the young to have a perception of reality that absolutely suits where they want the world to go.
[1:54:45.140 --> 1:54:58.140]  And therefore, in the end, the young people come out of the education system and they become adults and they go into things like politics.
[1:54:58.140 --> 1:55:09.140]  There's no greater example of an outcome of this programming than Alexandria Cassio Cortez and her Green New Deal.
[1:55:09.140 --> 1:55:22.140]  What the Green New Deal is demanding and what the Extinction Rebellion Organization that shuts streets in London and around the world is demanding, which is the same.
[1:55:22.140 --> 1:55:31.140]  Is the centralization of power over every area of people's lives on the basis of saving the planet?
[1:55:31.140 --> 1:55:47.140]  And they admit that AI will manage and watch every human activity to save the earth. So it's a global problem, a global solution, a global tax with global surveillance to then selectively cut off individuals and groups energy that don't comply with all the other demands of the social credit score.
[1:55:47.140 --> 1:55:52.140]  Yeah, and it's all a mind game.
[1:55:52.140 --> 1:56:00.140]  It's all about manipulating and imposing a perception because from perception comes everything else.
[1:56:00.140 --> 1:56:17.140]  So when you're trying to manipulate the young and crucially, not least this is happening through the climate hoax, divide the young from older people, another level, another fault line of divide and rule.
[1:56:17.140 --> 1:56:33.140]  So you bring in a young person, Greta Thunberg, and you turn her into some kind of martyr God who calls on kids around the world to strike over the climate.
[1:56:33.140 --> 1:56:42.140]  And she's very Hitlerian, big, huge, creepy murals, and you better do this. We're going to make you pay for what you've done to us.
[1:56:42.140 --> 1:57:02.140]  But the idea is you get a young person to focus the attention of young people. And for me, Greta Thunberg has been extraordinarily abused and go on to go on being abused and exploited by using her.
[1:57:02.140 --> 1:57:14.140]  And that's the form of abuse I'm talking about by using her as a political tool to bring about an agenda. So all this is going on.
[1:57:14.140 --> 1:57:23.140]  And the outcome is designed to be a global Marxist, stroke, fascist state.
[1:57:23.140 --> 1:57:33.140]  And let's go to that. Let's talk about where they're taking us in the endgame, where they admit they're taking us and how we counter that in this next hour with DavidIkeofDavidIke.com.
[1:57:33.140 --> 1:57:45.140]  It's a new book, The Trigger. I can't wait to read it. You should get it. You should give it to friends and family. You should wake people up. That's the number one mission. It's not work. It's the animating contest of liberty. It's survival.
[1:57:45.140 --> 1:57:48.140]  Andy in Florida. Thank you, Andy. Go ahead.
[1:57:48.140 --> 1:57:54.140]  Hey, Alex, I love you, man. We love you. Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I got to talk about one of your products.
[1:57:54.140 --> 1:58:02.140]  A little bit about me. I'm 245 pounds. I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS and make a long story short. I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[1:58:02.140 --> 1:58:11.140]  I do have ADHD, but, you know, I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties, you know, I kind of got a little out of hand and, you know, I listen to you religiously in my truck every day.
[1:58:11.140 --> 1:58:18.140]  So I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche. This product changed my life, but turbo force really changed my life.
[1:58:18.140 --> 1:58:25.140]  It was a day I'd no longer take Adderall and I get by literally 13 hours a day. I work on a half of a packet of your turbo force.
[1:58:25.140 --> 1:58:32.140]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day and you save so much money versus, you know, a monster, which is what, 499.
[1:58:32.140 --> 1:58:37.140]  And, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is. And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[1:58:37.140 --> 1:58:43.140]  We're really proud of turbo force. So thank you, sir. Commit to buy a lot of your products at m4store.com, then help us spread the word.
[1:58:43.140 --> 1:58:45.140]  Let's just get busy m4store.com.
[1:58:48.140 --> 1:58:55.140]  The last few days I've been online looking for the speech, actually read it in a book about Winston Churchill many years ago.
[1:58:55.140 --> 1:59:00.140]  And I've found a few places where it's mentioned, but if you can find it, please send it to showtipstem4wars.com.
[1:59:00.140 --> 1:59:09.140]  And he talked about in the darkest hours at the beginning of World War II, the fact that there have been times in history where people had a chance to stand up and fight early on and were assured of victory.
[1:59:09.140 --> 1:59:15.140]  Then there was a second point in history where folks have to fight even though the chances of winning are pretty steep.
[1:59:15.140 --> 1:59:23.140]  There's a third time when you know you're going to lose, but you have to fight because being enslaved and being slowly killed is much, much worse.
[1:59:23.140 --> 1:59:24.140]  That's a paraphrase.
[1:59:24.140 --> 1:59:32.140]  But ladies and gentlemen, we are in the position now of being able to win this easily if we find our spirit, find our focus, and don't give up and take action.
[1:59:32.140 --> 1:59:39.140]  But if we don't stand up and get involved, we're going to skip number two and go right to number three. That's a fact.
[1:59:39.140 --> 1:59:55.140]  They fear info wars because we are alive. It's time for the world to awaken and take back our future.
[1:59:55.140 --> 2:00:24.140]  That's the sound that a group of humans can make together. That's beautiful. We are an amazing species, but there are dark forces in this universe that seek to enslave us and force us to merge with their silicon system.
[2:00:24.140 --> 2:00:39.140]  It's now out in the open. Can you believe it's all out in the open now? When will the creatures step out from behind the shadows or will they ever?
[2:00:39.140 --> 2:00:48.140]  There's no doubt about it, ladies and gentlemen. They're keeping babies alive. They're selling their organs. There's a world government. There's an attack on the family.
[2:00:48.140 --> 2:00:54.140]  This is a short segment, a long segment coming up. David, before we go any further, because you never do this when you come on, I haven't read your book yet.
[2:00:54.140 --> 2:01:02.140]  I've read many of your books. I'm going to get your book, The Trigger. It's got the Twin Towers blowing up on the cover. I can guess what the book's about, but tell us about the book.
[2:01:02.140 --> 2:01:13.140]  Tell us where you've been. I usually do a lot of conferences and speeches. I know you've cut way back the last year and a half, and we've all missed you, so spend a few minutes on David Ike.
[2:01:13.140 --> 2:01:35.140]  Well, I've been doing internet videos all the time, as I do, but I've been writing a book. I've almost finished another one since this one came out, and I set about doing an update on a book I wrote about 9-11 called Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster.
[2:01:35.140 --> 2:01:47.140]  It came out in September 2002, and I set about just doing an update, and within two weeks I thought, this is not going to be an update. This is going to be a whole blank sheet of paper.
[2:01:47.140 --> 2:01:55.140]  And I put together this massive work, which is in two parts. The first, and it's not just about 9-11, but that's the theme.
[2:01:55.140 --> 2:02:08.140]  The first part of it demolishes the official story of 9-11, which is an absolute joke and an insult to the families who lost loved ones on 9-11, an absolute insult.
[2:02:08.140 --> 2:02:26.140]  And in the second half of the book, I tell an amazing story leading to who actually did do 9-11, who was really centrally orchestrating 9-11, and it wasn't 19 hijackers that couldn't fly one engine sessions.
[2:02:26.140 --> 2:02:38.140]  And it's a story that goes back to the 17th century, and the creation of a cult called Saboteanism through a guy called Zabotai Zevi.
[2:02:38.140 --> 2:02:45.140]  And in the next century, a guy came along. He claimed to be a Jewish Messiah.
[2:02:45.140 --> 2:02:54.140]  In the next century along came a guy called Jacob Frank, who said he was the reincarnation of Zevi and the biblical patriarch Jacob.
[2:02:54.140 --> 2:03:05.140]  And Saboteanism became Sabotean Frankism. And what it is, is an inversion of Judaism.
[2:03:05.140 --> 2:03:15.140]  What it does, it takes, for instance, if in Judaism, it's a day of fasting, then in Sabotean Frankism, it's a day of feasting.
[2:03:15.140 --> 2:03:26.140]  These Sabotean Frankists hate Jewish people, but they hide behind them. And I follow how their great technique is infiltration.
[2:03:26.140 --> 2:03:36.140]  They'll infiltrate, say, the Jewish community, they'll infiltrate as they did the Islamic community, they'll infiltrate the Christian community,
[2:03:36.140 --> 2:03:48.140]  and they'll appear to be advocates of that religion or that culture while working towards the agenda of this cult, Sabotean Frankism.
[2:03:48.140 --> 2:03:51.140]  And its public name is the ADL today, correct?
[2:03:51.140 --> 2:04:02.140]  Well, that's one expression of it. It's got a vast global network now, which made it able to manipulate 9-11.
[2:04:02.140 --> 2:04:12.140]  The core of the CIA and the American deep state is the Sabotean Frankist death cult, and in other places around the world, too.
[2:04:12.140 --> 2:04:16.140]  I'll tell you a quick story, if I've got time before the break.
[2:04:16.140 --> 2:04:19.140]  And a lot of the Nazis part of the Sabotean cult?
[2:04:19.140 --> 2:04:37.140]  Absolutely. It's all connected. And Sabotezevi operated in the Ottoman Empire, the Islamic Ottoman Empire, and he was told by the Sultan that he either converted to Islam or they would sort him out, if you know what I mean.
[2:04:37.140 --> 2:04:45.140]  So he converted. And a lot of his followers, because by that time in the 17th century, he had a million followers.
[2:04:45.140 --> 2:04:52.140]  Hold on. Listen, let's get more into this. This is really important, too. Wow. The David Ikes Art Gas. We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[2:05:15.140 --> 2:05:22.140]  This is one of the prices that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[2:05:22.140 --> 2:05:29.140]  And so it's very simple. If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see.
[2:05:29.140 --> 2:05:33.140]  You see, we have to make the effort. 110% God will finish the move.
[2:05:33.140 --> 2:05:39.140]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack. I want to attack. I want to go after the globalists.
[2:05:39.140 --> 2:05:46.140]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[2:05:46.140 --> 2:06:11.140]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family, because we're in this together. InfowarsStore.com.
[2:06:11.140 --> 2:06:17.140]  Well, you never know where David and I will go next, but it's always intriguing and very informative. I said, what's your new book, The Trigger?
[2:06:17.140 --> 2:06:27.140]  I haven't read it yet. And just came out and he plunged into it. A bizarre death cult that I'm aware of, and I'm aware of it being very powerful.
[2:06:27.140 --> 2:06:34.140]  And I'm aware of some of those folks interfacing with the Islamics, interfacing with multiple groups. And he was laying that out.
[2:06:34.140 --> 2:06:46.140]  So to finish up there, then I want to cut right to the chase with the off-world or interdimensional systems that the globalists admit they're interfacing with, why they do the occult rituals,
[2:06:46.140 --> 2:06:53.140]  why they hurt children, the energy of children, the different levels of it, why they're externalizing the hierarchy or the method right now,
[2:06:53.140 --> 2:07:03.140]  and then how we counter it with David Ike, here with us at DavidIke.com. Again, I'm Alex Jones. But then, FullWars.com, we've got Cyber Week going, critical to fund ourselves in the next year under all the attacks,
[2:07:03.140 --> 2:07:11.140]  store-wide free shipping, triple-patria points that we've done that before, and huge sales. We'll keep the sale going for the rest of the week, but some of these things are about to go off sale.
[2:07:11.140 --> 2:07:22.140]  A couple of things went off sale today because we're about to sell out. So take advantage of that and fund our operation. Don't spend your money with the big box stores or with the globalist anti-gun grips like Amazon and others.
[2:07:22.140 --> 2:07:32.140]  If you've got a choice, I'm not judging. If you buy some stuff of Amazon, it's very convenient. Everybody does it. But FullWars.com has great t-shirts, great books, great films, the best air filtration, best water filtration,
[2:07:32.140 --> 2:07:41.140]  a lot of good preparedness gear, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, and of course the best supplements out there you're going to find anywhere. So get your fish oil from us.
[2:07:41.140 --> 2:07:51.140]  Get your brain boost from us. Get your products at FullWars.com. Get your Wake Up America coffee. People drink it. It's got five stars by major coffee snob websites.
[2:07:51.140 --> 2:07:53.140]  It's that good.
[2:07:53.140 --> 2:07:59.140]  Infowarsstore.com. Whatever you do, do your shopping with us. Keeps us on the air, and it's critical to get the info out.
[2:07:59.140 --> 2:08:05.140]  So you can hear people like David Icke. I was talking during the break. He said, oh yeah, he's massively shadow banned, massively blocked.
[2:08:05.140 --> 2:08:12.140]  His videos still get millions of views online, and that's when they're shadow banned. So very important. Everybody realize this is not a spectator sport.
[2:08:12.140 --> 2:08:21.140]  We're all in this together, and you're human intelligence promoting the interviews, promoting the local stations. That's how we circumnavigate the censors.
[2:08:21.140 --> 2:08:30.140]  So I want to thank the viewers again. David, finishing up with your book, The Trigger, that I'm definitely going to read. Tell us more about it.
[2:08:30.140 --> 2:08:42.140]  So this Sabotai Zevi, who claimed to be the Jewish Messiah, who ran this Sabotian cult that was an inversion of Judaism.
[2:08:42.140 --> 2:08:50.140]  He was given the choice by the Sultan in the Ottoman Empire of convert to Islam or it's over.
[2:08:50.140 --> 2:09:01.140]  So he converted and a large number of his followers converted and they became known as the Donma or Donmet, which means to turn.
[2:09:01.140 --> 2:09:10.140]  And they outwardly claim to be followers of Islam, but they were Sabotians, which is a satanic cult.
[2:09:10.140 --> 2:09:22.140]  And I follow through one stream of this Donma and guess where it led, the Saudi royal family.
[2:09:22.140 --> 2:09:36.140]  And it led to another Sabotian called Wahab, who with the British Empire and the House of Saud, which the Wahabi's daughter married into,
[2:09:36.140 --> 2:09:50.140]  we get Wahabism, this head chopping ISIS extreme version of Islam, which is being used, of course, to create mayhem in the Middle East.
[2:09:50.140 --> 2:10:00.140]  You follow other streams of this Sabotian Frankis cult and it infiltrated the Roman Catholic Church.
[2:10:00.140 --> 2:10:06.140]  It was the force because the Rothschilds are Sabotian Frankists.
[2:10:06.140 --> 2:10:10.140]  It was the force behind the creation of Israel.
[2:10:10.140 --> 2:10:18.140]  I have a chapter in the book called Atlantic Crossing where I show how this cult moved in on the United States.
[2:10:18.140 --> 2:10:25.140]  It's in Britain and it's an expert in infiltration.
[2:10:25.140 --> 2:10:36.140]  It will appear as anything it wants to infiltrate and people will believe that, yeah, they really believe in whatever they claim to be,
[2:10:36.140 --> 2:10:44.140]  but they're working behind the scenes as the Donmet, the infiltrators.
[2:10:44.140 --> 2:10:54.140]  And the deep state in America at its core is controlled by the Sabotian Frankists and the Israeli government.
[2:10:54.140 --> 2:10:56.140]  I'm not talking about Jewish people.
[2:10:56.140 --> 2:11:07.140]  I mean, I've said in the book about three times, no one needs to read this book more urgently than Jewish people to see how they've been scammed by these infiltrators.
[2:11:07.140 --> 2:11:11.140]  Well, let's pull back from that because we know the Rothschilds are trying to put Netanyahu in prison.
[2:11:11.140 --> 2:11:13.140]  That's certainly going on.
[2:11:13.140 --> 2:11:17.140]  So there's major splits and power groups and things going on.
[2:11:17.140 --> 2:11:20.140]  And then we know that the Rothschilds helped found Israel.
[2:11:20.140 --> 2:11:27.140]  The internal WikiLeaks documents were now Soros wants to have a big cataclysm and have it fall and then out of that comes world government.
[2:11:27.140 --> 2:11:30.140]  This is biblical type revelation stuff.
[2:11:30.140 --> 2:11:32.140]  Can I just say a few things?
[2:11:32.140 --> 2:11:33.140]  Yes, please go ahead.
[2:11:33.140 --> 2:11:40.140]  By the way, I want to bring this from where I am now into what we've been talking about, the smart group.
[2:11:40.140 --> 2:11:58.140]  You know, I follow this through in the book and I explore this in the book and this is what I conclude that this apparent division between those that run Israel and George Soros is an absolute fricking myth.
[2:11:58.140 --> 2:12:02.140]  They are playing two sides against the center.
[2:12:02.140 --> 2:12:10.140]  We have a situation where Soros is funding the left through the open society foundations.
[2:12:10.140 --> 2:12:11.140]  He's funding all the woke.
[2:12:11.140 --> 2:12:17.140]  He's funding all the massive immigration agenda.
[2:12:17.140 --> 2:12:20.140]  And on the other side, they're funding the right.
[2:12:20.140 --> 2:12:26.140]  And it's a simple, simple, classic, sabotein, Frankish technique.
[2:12:26.140 --> 2:12:28.140]  Control both sides.
[2:12:28.140 --> 2:12:32.140]  Both sides would always fund both sides of a war.
[2:12:32.140 --> 2:12:33.140]  They admitted that.
[2:12:33.140 --> 2:12:34.140]  So in other groups have done that as well.
[2:12:34.140 --> 2:12:36.140]  So let's, the British Empire was going to that.
[2:12:36.140 --> 2:12:37.140]  So let's pull back here.
[2:12:37.140 --> 2:12:38.140]  Let me ask this question.
[2:12:38.140 --> 2:12:39.140]  One other thing.
[2:12:39.140 --> 2:12:40.140]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2:12:40.140 --> 2:12:49.140]  In the closing chapters of the book, I look at where the sabotein, Frankish agenda is going.
[2:12:49.140 --> 2:13:04.140]  Most people won't know this, but the second Silicon Valley in the world now is Israel and it's based on a place called beer sheba, which is a military cyber complex vast.
[2:13:04.140 --> 2:13:12.140]  And if you go on the internet and criticize Israel, there's a very good chance that the abuse that comes back will have a uniform.
[2:13:12.140 --> 2:13:15.140]  We'll be wearing a uniform out of beer sheba.
[2:13:15.140 --> 2:13:24.140]  Just to have a whole cyber on that because, because I see through AOC and all these groups and the four and all that also.
[2:13:24.140 --> 2:13:32.140]  I understand people can play both sides, but there's also a real anti-Israel anti-Jew sentiment from the left and on the universities.
[2:13:32.140 --> 2:13:40.140]  I mean, those people hate Jews.
[2:13:40.140 --> 2:13:45.140]  That's weird, David.
[2:13:45.140 --> 2:13:50.140]  Did you hear my question?
[2:13:50.140 --> 2:13:53.140]  You see that it's frozen.
[2:13:53.140 --> 2:13:55.140]  No.
[2:13:55.140 --> 2:13:56.140]  Can't hear it.
[2:13:56.140 --> 2:14:02.140]  Let's reconnect with David right now and get his take on that.
[2:14:02.140 --> 2:14:05.140]  You got to love Skype, especially since Microsoft bought it three years ago.
[2:14:05.140 --> 2:14:06.140]  It's gone nothing but downhill.
[2:14:06.140 --> 2:14:10.140]  Some technology used to get better and now it just stays the same where it gets worse.
[2:14:10.140 --> 2:14:12.140]  Absolutely annoying.
[2:14:12.140 --> 2:14:14.140]  And again, we go into everything.
[2:14:14.140 --> 2:14:19.140]  We look at everything here and it's all very interesting and people need to discuss it.
[2:14:19.140 --> 2:14:20.140]  We need to talk about it.
[2:14:20.140 --> 2:14:22.140]  Oh, do we have David back now?
[2:14:22.140 --> 2:14:27.140]  David, can you hear me?
[2:14:27.140 --> 2:14:28.140]  All right.
[2:14:28.140 --> 2:14:31.140]  What we're going to do is we're going to go to break and we're going to figure this out.
[2:14:31.140 --> 2:14:32.140]  We have to get on the telephone.
[2:14:32.140 --> 2:14:35.140]  We'll do that because I'm not going to do a 30 minute mess with the Skype ritual.
[2:14:35.140 --> 2:14:37.140]  That's just not going to happen today.
[2:14:37.140 --> 2:14:42.140]  But again, David, is our guest in FullWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[2:14:42.140 --> 2:14:51.140]  All I know is the globalists are anti-human and Communist China has been officially set up to standardize the model of dehumanization and enslavement.
[2:14:51.140 --> 2:14:53.140]  And that's in Reuters today.
[2:14:53.140 --> 2:14:55.140]  That's where I was going next.
[2:14:55.140 --> 2:14:57.140]  And I don't want to live like I live in Communist China.
[2:14:57.140 --> 2:15:01.140]  And so I don't care who's running it or what's behind it.
[2:15:01.140 --> 2:15:13.140]  I just simply know there is a race by all these countries and all these corporations to build this total surveillance grid that absolutely ends independent human activity and is being used to enslave us and kill us.
[2:15:13.140 --> 2:15:15.140]  And it's wrong and it's dangerous.
[2:15:15.140 --> 2:15:22.140]  So we're going to work on David Ike's Skype or our Skype, find out what the hell's going on, and we're going to have him finish up what he's trying to get into.
[2:15:22.140 --> 2:15:27.140]  They don't want to get into big picture, the offworld demons of the Bible.
[2:15:27.140 --> 2:15:31.140]  I mean, because the globalists follow these, they worship these, that's why I really wanted David on.
[2:15:31.140 --> 2:15:34.140]  Because he's been vindicated, the royal family, what's coming out.
[2:15:34.140 --> 2:15:35.140]  It's happening with Prince Andrew.
[2:15:35.140 --> 2:15:40.140]  Why is he in trouble when Prince Charles was best buddies with Jimmy Savelle and so much more.
[2:15:40.140 --> 2:15:43.140]  Back in just a few minutes with David Ike of DavidIke.com.
[2:15:43.140 --> 2:15:58.140]  We'll finish up talking about his book, The Trigger, and then we'll get into so much more straight ahead.
[2:16:14.140 --> 2:16:25.140]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[2:16:25.140 --> 2:16:29.140]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:16:29.140 --> 2:16:30.140]  I sued the IRS in one.
[2:16:30.140 --> 2:16:33.140]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:16:33.140 --> 2:16:39.140]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[2:16:39.140 --> 2:16:40.140]  I can help you too.
[2:16:40.140 --> 2:16:43.140]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[2:16:43.140 --> 2:16:45.140]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[2:16:45.140 --> 2:17:11.140]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[2:17:11.140 --> 2:17:17.140]  I'm sure how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[2:17:17.140 --> 2:17:21.140]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[2:17:21.140 --> 2:17:25.140]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[2:17:25.140 --> 2:17:27.140]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:17:27.140 --> 2:17:35.140]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[2:17:35.140 --> 2:17:43.140]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305, that's 866-295-5305,
[2:17:43.140 --> 2:17:56.140]  or order online, hbextract.com, heart and body extract, 866-295-5305, or hbextract.com.
[2:17:56.140 --> 2:18:00.140]  Cyber week is here with the biggest sales of 2019.
[2:18:00.140 --> 2:18:10.140]  No sales in our history can even approach this, triple Patriot points, store-wide free shipping, 50-70% off,
[2:18:10.140 --> 2:18:18.140]  and when you add auto-ship to it on the order, a lot of these products become lost leaders,
[2:18:18.140 --> 2:18:23.140]  meaning I'm losing money on them but bringing in capital so I can fund ourselves into next year.
[2:18:23.140 --> 2:18:27.140]  It is critical for folks to take advantage of these sales.
[2:18:27.140 --> 2:18:32.140]  If you've ever been on the fence trying some of the products like the protein bars or turbo force and the fish oil,
[2:18:32.140 --> 2:18:40.140]  now is the time we've got huge specials on DNA Force Plus, our flagship product, with a free bottle of Brain Force Plus with it.
[2:18:40.140 --> 2:18:45.140]  It's all available at infowarstore.com during Cyber Week.
[2:18:45.140 --> 2:18:50.140]  Now, a lot of these sales will continue through Christmas, but some of them have to end because the products are selling out.
[2:18:50.140 --> 2:18:54.140]  infowarstore.com funds the info war. Thank you.
[2:18:54.140 --> 2:18:59.140]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate info wars,
[2:18:59.140 --> 2:19:06.140]  it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[2:19:06.140 --> 2:19:13.140]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new order's plans to not get down when they attack us
[2:19:13.140 --> 2:19:15.140]  and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[2:19:15.140 --> 2:19:20.140]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[2:19:20.140 --> 2:19:26.140]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves
[2:19:26.140 --> 2:19:32.140]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[2:19:32.140 --> 2:19:36.140]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves,
[2:19:36.140 --> 2:19:42.140]  but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[2:19:42.140 --> 2:19:44.140]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[2:19:44.140 --> 2:19:47.140]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[2:19:47.140 --> 2:19:54.140]  They fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[2:20:18.140 --> 2:20:20.140]  We had a Skype problem. Who knows?
[2:20:20.140 --> 2:20:26.140]  Finish up with what you were getting to and then I want to get into the fact that we know the globalists are conducting occult rituals,
[2:20:26.140 --> 2:20:32.140]  why they're doing it, the pedophilia, why they're coming out with it, why they're admitting it, why they're promoting it,
[2:20:32.140 --> 2:20:39.140]  and where they want to take us versus what we can do to stop this agenda and what you think the timeline is, David,
[2:20:39.140 --> 2:20:41.140]  because you've been a big trailblazer.
[2:20:41.140 --> 2:20:47.140]  I want you to tell us what you think is coming next because they now admit world government, post-human future,
[2:20:47.140 --> 2:20:49.140]  really nightmare stuff that's all over the news.
[2:20:49.140 --> 2:20:53.140]  They're just telling us, roll over and die and I really don't want to do that.
[2:20:53.140 --> 2:20:55.140]  So please continue.
[2:20:55.140 --> 2:21:06.140]  Yeah, I was just saying before the Skype broke up that there's a chapter in the trigger of when this saboteur and Frank is cult moved in on America.
[2:21:06.140 --> 2:21:19.140]  And when you look at 9-11, you can see how this cult was the cement that pulled the whole thing together so that the CIA were involved,
[2:21:19.140 --> 2:21:27.140]  the Pentagon was involved, the government was involved, the FBI was involved because this cult works like that.
[2:21:27.140 --> 2:21:36.140]  It infiltrates all these different cultures, all these different agencies and through those connections, it works as one unit.
[2:21:36.140 --> 2:21:50.140]  And when you look at the ultra Zionist involvement in 9-11 before, during and after, it is absolutely staggering.
[2:21:50.140 --> 2:21:58.140]  The Jewish population of the world is 0.2%.
[2:21:58.140 --> 2:22:09.140]  And part of that community that I'm talking about is a tiny fraction of 0.2%, a tiny fraction of 2% of the American Jewish population.
[2:22:09.140 --> 2:22:18.140]  And yet the positions of influence and control across 9-11 were just beyond belief.
[2:22:18.140 --> 2:22:21.140]  Now that is not a statistical chance.
[2:22:21.140 --> 2:22:24.140]  That is because there's something to look at.
[2:22:24.140 --> 2:22:26.140]  And I expose it all in the trigger.
[2:22:26.140 --> 2:22:30.140]  And that's not to say the Jews did 9-11.
[2:22:30.140 --> 2:22:31.140]  They didn't.
[2:22:31.140 --> 2:22:35.140]  The vast majority of Jewish people have no idea they've been infiltrated.
[2:22:35.140 --> 2:22:40.140]  That the Islamic community don't realize they've been infiltrated.
[2:22:40.140 --> 2:22:44.140]  Christian Zionism in America doesn't realize it's been infiltrated.
[2:22:44.140 --> 2:22:51.140]  But this is how the Roman church doesn't realize at any follower level that it's been infiltrated.
[2:22:51.140 --> 2:22:58.140]  But it has by this same through the centuries death cult.
[2:22:58.140 --> 2:23:03.140]  And they are, as I was saying, in Israel.
[2:23:03.140 --> 2:23:10.140]  And again, I say again, it's the sabotee and Frank's cult that actually is the force running Israel.
[2:23:10.140 --> 2:23:15.140]  They've created this vast military cyber center at Beersheba.
[2:23:15.140 --> 2:23:25.140]  And all around that cyber center are research and development facilities put there by the major Silicon Valley companies.
[2:23:25.140 --> 2:23:34.140]  And they are turning out the technicians and the developers of this smart grid.
[2:23:34.140 --> 2:23:41.140]  They have an entire system in Israel whereby they are scanning the schools.
[2:23:41.140 --> 2:23:43.140]  They're scanning the universities.
[2:23:43.140 --> 2:23:48.140]  And then when they come into their conscripted military service,
[2:23:48.140 --> 2:23:56.140]  they're looking at those that have this capacity, this aptitude for cyber expertise.
[2:23:56.140 --> 2:24:01.140]  And they are putting them into this cyber development center at Beersheba.
[2:24:01.140 --> 2:24:09.140]  And then they're going off into Silicon Valley companies, creating their own startup companies,
[2:24:09.140 --> 2:24:11.140]  all to do with the smart grid.
[2:24:11.140 --> 2:24:16.140]  And they're representatives of this Mossad network.
[2:24:16.140 --> 2:24:22.140]  And that's why if you look again at Jeffrey Epstein,
[2:24:22.140 --> 2:24:29.140]  he was running a Mossad CIA, Sabotee and Frankist, with the connection.
[2:24:29.140 --> 2:24:33.140]  Blackmail operation on the rich and famous. Why?
[2:24:33.140 --> 2:24:40.140]  Because once they got you, then you will make decisions that this cult wants making to advance its agenda.
[2:24:40.140 --> 2:24:44.140]  I'm glad I brought that up and I definitely want to read the book.
[2:24:44.140 --> 2:24:46.140]  It's all fascinating.
[2:24:46.140 --> 2:24:49.140]  A mainstream reader absolutely ignored it.
[2:24:49.140 --> 2:24:51.140]  They usually attack me.
[2:24:51.140 --> 2:24:53.140]  They usually demonize me.
[2:24:53.140 --> 2:24:55.140]  They have completely ignored it.
[2:24:55.140 --> 2:24:57.140]  And that tells you something.
[2:24:57.140 --> 2:24:59.140]  Please come back again and get into the whole book.
[2:24:59.140 --> 2:25:00.140]  We'll spend two hours on it.
[2:25:00.140 --> 2:25:02.140]  And I can't wait to read it.
[2:25:02.140 --> 2:25:04.140]  Now we've got limited time left here.
[2:25:04.140 --> 2:25:07.140]  Paul Watson is hosting the fourth hour and I appreciate you've been gracious with your time, David.
[2:25:07.140 --> 2:25:16.140]  Let's start getting into the post-human in game and the off world or non-human element from your research,
[2:25:16.140 --> 2:25:19.140]  culturally looking at this, getting deep into it.
[2:25:19.140 --> 2:25:22.140]  I think basically everyone knows this is an anti-human agenda.
[2:25:22.140 --> 2:25:23.140]  It isn't just humans doing this.
[2:25:23.140 --> 2:25:24.140]  There's a master plan.
[2:25:24.140 --> 2:25:25.140]  It's very old.
[2:25:25.140 --> 2:25:28.140]  It's the globalists say they're in contact with inter-dimensionals.
[2:25:28.140 --> 2:25:31.140]  Joe Rogan's whole show is about how great it is and how wonderful it all is.
[2:25:31.140 --> 2:25:33.140]  And how we should interface with these little friendly folks.
[2:25:33.140 --> 2:25:36.140]  If you say they're bad, then you're crazy.
[2:25:36.140 --> 2:25:37.140]  It doesn't exist in your nuts.
[2:25:37.140 --> 2:25:42.140]  But if you love it and it's good, well, we should all just do what these little elves tell us to do.
[2:25:42.140 --> 2:25:44.140]  But what's really going on here?
[2:25:44.140 --> 2:25:45.140]  Who are the globalists?
[2:25:45.140 --> 2:25:46.140]  What do they believe they're doing?
[2:25:46.140 --> 2:25:49.140]  Why is the British royalty showing to the occult?
[2:25:49.140 --> 2:25:53.140]  Why is Prince Charles angry at his brother for an underage girl, which is bad?
[2:25:53.140 --> 2:25:55.140]  But meanwhile, he hangs out with Jimmy Savell.
[2:25:55.140 --> 2:25:56.140]  We know does far worse things.
[2:25:56.140 --> 2:25:57.140]  Is it Prince Andrew?
[2:25:57.140 --> 2:26:00.140]  Kind of the limited hangout right now.
[2:26:00.140 --> 2:26:07.140]  Well, you see, over the last 30 years, I've researched so many subjects.
[2:26:07.140 --> 2:26:12.140]  And as you research them, they connect and they show you a picture.
[2:26:12.140 --> 2:26:18.140]  So as you follow these interbreeding bloodlines, which came out of the ancient world,
[2:26:18.140 --> 2:26:25.140]  particularly out of the Middle East, out of Babylon, out of Sumer, out of Egypt,
[2:26:25.140 --> 2:26:32.140]  and up into Europe and then worldwide through the colonization of the world.
[2:26:32.140 --> 2:26:46.140]  You follow not just a sequence of interbreeding, because once...
[2:26:46.140 --> 2:26:49.140]  You know, ironically...
[2:26:49.140 --> 2:26:54.140]  So in one interest, but that's the way it works.
[2:26:54.140 --> 2:27:00.140]  Once the world in general started rejecting overrule by royalty,
[2:27:00.140 --> 2:27:03.140]  these bloodlines went into the dark suit professions.
[2:27:03.140 --> 2:27:09.140]  They went into politics, into banking, into business, into...
[2:27:09.140 --> 2:27:11.140]  All this network.
[2:27:11.140 --> 2:27:15.140]  And when you follow these bloodlines through history, two other things follow.
[2:27:15.140 --> 2:27:17.140]  Satanism and pedophilia.
[2:27:17.140 --> 2:27:21.140]  Because these entities, we take pedophilia,
[2:27:21.140 --> 2:27:27.140]  these entities operating outside of human sight, they feed off human energy.
[2:27:27.140 --> 2:27:31.140]  You remember in the Matrix movies when the Morpheus character held up the battery
[2:27:31.140 --> 2:27:34.140]  and said the machines have turned us into one of these.
[2:27:34.140 --> 2:27:36.140]  An energy source.
[2:27:36.140 --> 2:27:38.140]  Well, that's what they do.
[2:27:38.140 --> 2:27:44.140]  And the energy that they want in humans in general
[2:27:44.140 --> 2:27:48.140]  is what I call low vibrational emotional energy.
[2:27:48.140 --> 2:27:52.140]  They want energy we give off, because we're giving it off all the time
[2:27:52.140 --> 2:27:56.140]  in terms of electromagnetic frequency, depending on our state of emotion
[2:27:56.140 --> 2:27:58.140]  and our state of mind.
[2:27:58.140 --> 2:28:03.140]  They want the energy of depression, the energy of fear, the energy of anxiety,
[2:28:03.140 --> 2:28:07.140]  sexual energy in its more extreme form.
[2:28:07.140 --> 2:28:09.140]  This is what they want.
[2:28:09.140 --> 2:28:14.140]  And they structured society so that humans give them that energy.
[2:28:14.140 --> 2:28:19.140]  But their nectar, if you like, the energy they want more than anything
[2:28:19.140 --> 2:28:22.140]  is the energy of prepubescent children.
[2:28:22.140 --> 2:28:25.140]  And that's how they throw it in our face with monster university.
[2:28:25.140 --> 2:28:29.140]  Oh, scaring the energies with power is the monster kingdom.
[2:28:29.140 --> 2:28:32.140]  You're talking about this 30 years ago, but that's literally what they're doing.
[2:28:32.140 --> 2:28:36.140]  And terrorizing and torturing and using up a child is their ambrosia.
[2:28:36.140 --> 2:28:38.140]  And it's what they do in the Satanic rituals.
[2:28:38.140 --> 2:28:44.140]  This is why they, you know, if you go back into history
[2:28:44.140 --> 2:28:48.140]  and when they were openly sacrificing people, what were they doing?
[2:28:48.140 --> 2:28:51.140]  What was the line, sacrificing young virgins to the stars?
[2:28:51.140 --> 2:28:53.140]  Let's stay there. Let's talk about it.
[2:28:53.140 --> 2:28:58.140]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:28:58.140 --> 2:29:00.140]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[2:29:00.140 --> 2:29:02.140]  I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:02.140 --> 2:29:06.140]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control
[2:29:06.140 --> 2:29:08.140]  and almost ruined my life.
[2:29:08.140 --> 2:29:13.140]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:13.140 --> 2:29:16.140]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem
[2:29:16.140 --> 2:29:21.140]  and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[2:29:21.140 --> 2:29:26.140]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits

[2:29:55.140 --> 2:29:57.140]  Andy in Florida. Thank you, Andy. Go ahead.
[2:29:57.140 --> 2:29:59.140]  Hey, Alex. I love you, man. We love you.
[2:29:59.140 --> 2:30:03.140]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I got to talk about one of your products.
[2:30:03.140 --> 2:30:05.140]  A little bit about me. I'm 245 pounds.
[2:30:05.140 --> 2:30:08.140]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS.
[2:30:08.140 --> 2:30:11.140]  And make a long story short, I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[2:30:11.140 --> 2:30:16.140]  I do have ADHD, but, you know, I was taking Adderall for its energy-boosting properties.
[2:30:16.140 --> 2:30:18.140]  You know, I kind of got a little out of hand.
[2:30:18.140 --> 2:30:20.140]  And, you know, I listen to you religiously in my truck every day.
[2:30:20.140 --> 2:30:25.140]  So I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche, this product changed my life,
[2:30:25.140 --> 2:30:27.140]  but turbo force really changed my life.
[2:30:27.140 --> 2:30:29.140]  It was a day I'd no longer take Adderall.
[2:30:29.140 --> 2:30:34.140]  And I get by literally 13 hours a day I work on a half of a packet of your turbo force.
[2:30:34.140 --> 2:30:37.140]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day.
[2:30:37.140 --> 2:30:41.140]  And you save so much money versus, you know, a monster, which is what, 499.
[2:30:41.140 --> 2:30:44.140]  And, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is.
[2:30:44.140 --> 2:30:46.140]  And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[2:30:46.140 --> 2:30:48.140]  We're really proud of turbo force.
[2:30:48.140 --> 2:30:49.140]  So thank you, sir.

[2:31:22.140 --> 2:31:26.140]  And it's because I've been taking the eight pack power stack in the morning and at night.
[2:31:26.140 --> 2:31:28.140]  I've been taking X2 and X3.
[2:31:28.140 --> 2:31:30.140]  I've been taking brain force plus.
[2:31:30.140 --> 2:31:32.140]  Quite frankly, I can't take turbo force.
[2:31:32.140 --> 2:31:33.140]  It's just too powerful.
[2:31:33.140 --> 2:31:37.140]  I have been taking the fish oil and the krill oil when I go to sleep at night.
[2:31:37.140 --> 2:31:39.140]  And it's totally energized my life.
[2:31:39.140 --> 2:31:42.140]  I know our products work, but I'm like everybody else.
[2:31:42.140 --> 2:31:44.140]  I use them, then I forget about them.

[2:31:56.140 --> 2:31:58.140]  It's shocking, but true.
[2:31:58.140 --> 2:32:04.140]  2019 is almost a memory in the rear view mirror.
[2:32:04.140 --> 2:32:07.140]  And cyber week is here.

[2:32:24.140 --> 2:32:26.140]  It is an incredible time to be alive.
[2:32:26.140 --> 2:32:31.140]  It's an incredible time to still be on the air when almost everybody else has been shut down and censored.
[2:32:31.140 --> 2:32:34.140]  Yes, we were the first to be censored because we're such a threat to the globalist.
[2:32:34.140 --> 2:32:38.140]  But now, thanks to the infrastructure and your support, we're still on air.
[2:32:38.140 --> 2:32:41.140]  But bigger attacks are already happening, more are coming.

[2:33:33.140 --> 2:33:35.140]  We shall fight in the hills.
[2:33:35.140 --> 2:33:39.140]  We shall never surrender.
[2:33:39.140 --> 2:33:45.140]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:45.140 --> 2:34:01.140]  Music
[2:34:01.140 --> 2:34:04.140]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, David Ike is our guest.
[2:34:04.140 --> 2:34:07.140]  David, it's all coming out.
[2:34:07.140 --> 2:34:14.140]  Jimmy Savelle in the Dungeons and the Dead Children and the Royal Family and Best Buddies with Prince Charles.
[2:34:14.140 --> 2:34:22.140]  But then Prince Andrew, who I'm not defending, is obviously with this underage 17, 16-year-old girl.
[2:34:22.140 --> 2:34:27.140]  There's blackmail going on and it's obviously a deep state fight with each other.
[2:34:27.140 --> 2:34:31.140]  Now they're threatening to have videos come out of other world leaders.
[2:34:31.140 --> 2:34:33.140]  Bill Gates is involved.
[2:34:33.140 --> 2:34:42.140]  All these other people, Epstein was running meetings on an alternate world government is what the Wall Street Journal reported 12 years ago.
[2:34:42.140 --> 2:34:44.140]  And what the Guardian reported.
[2:34:44.140 --> 2:34:48.140]  Oh, an alternate world government to save the world from overpopulation.
[2:34:48.140 --> 2:34:57.140]  Oprah Winfrey, Bill and Melinda Gates, Ted Turner and others meeting secretly with Jeffrey Epstein at the Albert Einstein Institute.
[2:34:57.140 --> 2:35:05.140]  And then now Bill Gates living, staying with him in France, staying with him in New York, staying with him in the Caribbean,
[2:35:05.140 --> 2:35:12.140]  trying to cover that up and then weird secret breeding programs and, you know, the ranch with the medical facilities.
[2:35:12.140 --> 2:35:15.140]  What in the hell is going on with these people?
[2:35:15.140 --> 2:35:19.140]  And why are there so many dead bodies of children found around the Royals?
[2:35:19.140 --> 2:35:22.140]  And from your research, why is all this starting to come out?
[2:35:22.140 --> 2:35:28.140]  I mean, the deputy pope, the pope's best buddy just convicted of trafficking over 100 kidnapped little boys,
[2:35:28.140 --> 2:35:33.140]  barely made the news, 3,000 priests busted in Pennsylvania,
[2:35:33.140 --> 2:35:37.140]  barely made the news. They said, well, it wasn't just homosexual sex or pedophilia.
[2:35:37.140 --> 2:35:41.140]  They were doing satanic rituals in the churches, but it barely makes the news.
[2:35:41.140 --> 2:35:46.140]  So this is bigger than I thought it was. What in the hell is going on?
[2:35:46.140 --> 2:35:51.140]  Sabotein Frankism. You've covered every basis with that.
[2:35:51.140 --> 2:35:55.140]  That's what this cult does. That's why Epstein was involved.
[2:35:55.140 --> 2:36:02.140]  And Jimmy Savile was someone who had a lot of connections into this as well.
[2:36:02.140 --> 2:36:09.140]  And so there's no way that Savile wasn't running a because he was one of the things that's not coming out about Savile.
[2:36:09.140 --> 2:36:18.140]  Is the scale of the way he was providing children for the rich and famous, just like Epstein was.
[2:36:18.140 --> 2:36:24.140]  And you've got to ask this question. You see, I mean, let's let's do a little Laura statistics for a minute.
[2:36:24.140 --> 2:36:33.140]  You've got one family in London in a big palace and you've got on one side of the ocean,
[2:36:33.140 --> 2:36:41.140]  the most famous pedophile and procurer of children and child trafficker in America, Epstein,
[2:36:41.140 --> 2:36:47.140]  and he's a friend of Prince Andrew. And then you've got in Britain,
[2:36:47.140 --> 2:36:51.140]  the most famous pedophile and procurer of children for the rich and famous,
[2:36:51.140 --> 2:36:57.140]  the most famous pedophile sex with dead bodies and all that stuff that he was into Savile.
[2:36:57.140 --> 2:37:02.140]  And he was a bosom buddy for decades of Prince Charles.
[2:37:02.140 --> 2:37:15.140]  And according to Savile's own words, he was introduced into the bosom in a circle of the British royal family in the 1960s.
[2:37:15.140 --> 2:37:20.140]  He was just a disc jockey. Why would the royals being interested in him?
[2:37:20.140 --> 2:37:28.140]  Well, he says that he was introduced by a guy called old Mount Batten, a big member of the royal family.
[2:37:28.140 --> 2:37:33.140]  And I've been saying in my books for years that Mount Batten was pedophile.
[2:37:33.140 --> 2:37:40.140]  And there was a book came out this year, which was quoting Freedom of Information Act documents from the FBI,
[2:37:40.140 --> 2:37:49.140]  in which they were also talking about the fact that there were claims that Mount Batten was a pedophile.
[2:37:49.140 --> 2:37:53.140]  So a pedophile member of the royal family introduces Savile,
[2:37:53.140 --> 2:37:57.140]  this procurer of children for the rich and famous, into the royal family in a sanctum.
[2:37:57.140 --> 2:38:10.140]  He's there for decades. And by the way, he was actually used as a mediator between Prince Charles and Lady Diana
[2:38:10.140 --> 2:38:17.140]  when their marriage was breaking down. He was acting as a mediator, this disc jockey pedophile.
[2:38:17.140 --> 2:38:22.140]  And so the chances of that being a coincidence, of course, are ludicrous.
[2:38:22.140 --> 2:38:32.140]  And we have a situation in Britain where the police have not even acted or questioned this guy, Andrew,
[2:38:32.140 --> 2:38:37.140]  on the basis of what was claimed to have happened in a house in London.
[2:38:37.140 --> 2:38:44.140]  And by the way, getting back to the whole Sabatian angle, you've got the girlfriend of Epstein.
[2:38:44.140 --> 2:38:54.140]  Her dad was the famous British slash Israeli intelligence operative who admittedly ran giant rings for sex operations in pedophilia.
[2:38:54.140 --> 2:38:59.140]  That's all even come out mainstream news. So this is just an incredible nest of this.
[2:38:59.140 --> 2:39:14.140]  Bob Maxwell is actually in the trigger because the Sabatian Frank is Israeli Mossad have been manipulating the cyber world all along.
[2:39:14.140 --> 2:39:22.140]  And you'll remember this technology called Promise that was brought out by an American company.
[2:39:22.140 --> 2:39:29.140]  And then the American government in league with Mossad put back doors into it.
[2:39:29.140 --> 2:39:34.140]  So when it was being bought by all and sundry around the world, they had access to it.
[2:39:34.140 --> 2:39:40.140]  But according to Victor Ostrovsky, who was a Mossad agent, wrote a couple of books.
[2:39:40.140 --> 2:39:41.140]  We had him on the show.
[2:39:41.140 --> 2:39:49.140]  Yeah. Well, he was saying that Bob Maxwell, who was a big newspaper publisher in Britain,
[2:39:49.140 --> 2:39:56.140]  the under daily mirror at one point, I interviewed him once with a BBC, one of the most unpleasant pieces of work I've ever met in my life.
[2:39:56.140 --> 2:39:58.140]  I needed a shower when I left.
[2:39:58.140 --> 2:40:11.140]  Anyway, he is named by Ostrovsky as a Mossad agent who made a fortune selling the promise backdoor software all over the world.
[2:40:11.140 --> 2:40:21.140]  And according to him, it was Mossad that killed Maxwell on his boat, the Lady Ghislaine.
[2:40:21.140 --> 2:40:24.140]  And so here you have this.
[2:40:24.140 --> 2:40:36.140]  What I would strongly suggest is the Sabatian Frank is Mossad agent Epstein in league with the daughter of a Mossad agent, Bob Maxwell.
[2:40:36.140 --> 2:40:41.140]  It's a very small world once you start putting the pieces together.
[2:40:41.140 --> 2:40:45.140]  Yeah, but if you dig into his funeral in Israel, they admitted that he was a super spy.
[2:40:45.140 --> 2:40:46.140]  He got the highest honors.
[2:40:46.140 --> 2:40:48.140]  That's not even secret about Bob Maxwell.
[2:40:48.140 --> 2:40:51.140]  He was buried on the mountain wall, isn't he?
[2:40:51.140 --> 2:40:53.140]  Yeah, I mean, that's just a fact.
[2:40:53.140 --> 2:41:00.140]  So I mean, it's a fact that this was a giant trifecta between British, U.S. and Israeli intelligence.
[2:41:00.140 --> 2:41:03.140]  And so again, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, all of them.
[2:41:03.140 --> 2:41:09.140]  We know that Oprah Winfrey is highly compromised and likes girls.
[2:41:09.140 --> 2:41:11.140]  And this is just a fact.
[2:41:11.140 --> 2:41:13.140]  And so these people know they're being set up.
[2:41:13.140 --> 2:41:14.140]  It's like part of the club.
[2:41:14.140 --> 2:41:15.140]  It's the initiation.
[2:41:15.140 --> 2:41:18.140]  It's not like Bill Gates and all them just didn't know this was going on.
[2:41:18.140 --> 2:41:21.140]  They're going there to just to bathe in the waters.
[2:41:21.140 --> 2:41:24.140]  And that's just how you get in the club.
[2:41:24.140 --> 2:41:31.140]  Yeah, and of course, when you get into this club, if you are among the rich and famous,
[2:41:31.140 --> 2:41:37.140]  then you're not only in the club, you're compromised, ongoing.
[2:41:37.140 --> 2:41:40.140]  And therefore you do what the club tells you to do.
[2:41:40.140 --> 2:41:42.140]  Otherwise, it's revealed.
[2:41:42.140 --> 2:41:51.140]  And so when this Epstein network started getting close because, you know,
[2:41:51.140 --> 2:41:56.140]  you've got to take your older hand up to these girls who've been particularly Virginia Roberts,
[2:41:56.140 --> 2:42:02.140]  who's been vociferous in standing up and not bowing to it, to the pressure,
[2:42:02.140 --> 2:42:06.140]  that it was in danger of unraveling in public.
[2:42:06.140 --> 2:42:09.140]  Then, of course, you have to remove.
[2:42:09.140 --> 2:42:11.140]  Well, I'm not saying Virginia Roberts is bad.
[2:42:11.140 --> 2:42:12.140]  And I believe her.
[2:42:12.140 --> 2:42:16.140]  She's got the pr- I'm saying 16, 17-year-old girls is a limited hangout.
[2:42:16.140 --> 2:42:20.140]  We all know that, I mean, my God, it's chopping children's heads off.
[2:42:20.140 --> 2:42:22.140]  It's breaking their blood.
[2:42:22.140 --> 2:42:28.140]  I'm not saying that you're saying that Virginia Roberts is-
[2:42:28.140 --> 2:42:31.140]  No, no, no, no, I'm not saying you're saying that.
[2:42:31.140 --> 2:42:34.140]  I'm saying as soon as I say that's nothing, they're only focusing on that
[2:42:34.140 --> 2:42:39.140]  because that's a limited hangout to divert off the really horrible Satanism.
[2:42:39.140 --> 2:42:46.140]  Well, what they always do when something comes out is they try to make that the holding position.
[2:42:46.140 --> 2:42:51.140]  And so what's happened with Prince Andrew is the Queen,
[2:42:51.140 --> 2:42:53.140]  stand there, let's talk about this when we come back.
[2:43:21.140 --> 2:43:25.140]  They hold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves
[2:43:25.140 --> 2:43:31.140]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[2:43:31.140 --> 2:43:35.140]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves,
[2:43:35.140 --> 2:43:41.140]  but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[2:43:41.140 --> 2:43:43.140]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[2:43:43.140 --> 2:43:46.140]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[2:43:46.140 --> 2:43:53.140]  They fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[2:43:53.140 --> 2:43:56.140]  My phone has been ringing off the hook.
[2:43:56.140 --> 2:43:58.140]  Dozens and dozens of people have called me.
[2:43:58.140 --> 2:44:00.140]  I've gotten all these text messages.
[2:44:00.140 --> 2:44:02.140]  The office phones ringing off the hook.
[2:44:02.140 --> 2:44:04.140]  Emails are flooding in.
[2:44:04.140 --> 2:44:06.140]  They're saying, can you believe it?
[2:44:06.140 --> 2:44:12.140]  300 Trump ads that were going to run tens of millions of times were pulled by Google.
[2:44:12.140 --> 2:44:15.140]  And then it turns out it was done over the summer.
[2:44:15.140 --> 2:44:17.140]  Folks, I live this every day.
[2:44:17.140 --> 2:44:20.140]  I read the news like nobody else probably.
[2:44:20.140 --> 2:44:24.140]  And they have been hitting hundreds of congressional candidates and members of Congress.
[2:44:24.140 --> 2:44:26.140]  They've been going after governors, state reps.
[2:44:26.140 --> 2:44:28.140]  It's been a reign of terror.
[2:44:28.140 --> 2:44:33.140]  Last week they wouldn't let Melania Trump images be sent out saying it was hate speech.
[2:44:33.140 --> 2:44:36.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is beyond censorship.
[2:44:36.140 --> 2:44:38.140]  It's total information control.
[2:44:38.140 --> 2:44:44.140]  It has to all go through a filter and that's what AI allows is what I call information singularity.
[2:44:44.140 --> 2:44:49.140]  Not empowering information, but holding it all in like the one ring of Mordor.
[2:44:49.140 --> 2:44:55.140]  Trump must act now or they will steal this election.
[2:44:55.140 --> 2:44:57.140]  Twilight is here.
[2:44:57.140 --> 2:45:03.140]  The sun is setting on 2019 and we hurdle into the year 2020.
[2:45:03.140 --> 2:45:09.140]  Only 330 days out from this incredibly historic election.
[2:45:09.140 --> 2:45:13.140]  And it's more important than ever to pray for President Trump and to pray for his provision and his protection.
[2:45:13.140 --> 2:45:20.140]  He's completely surrounded and to pray for him to have discernment and to be bold and to take action
[2:45:20.140 --> 2:45:27.140]  and not listen to the advisors that tell him to hold back and that if he goes after the deep state that they'll remove him from office.
[2:45:27.140 --> 2:45:34.140]  They're trying to remove him regardless because they know that God put him in office
[2:45:34.140 --> 2:45:39.140]  and that he's going to continue his work and he's going to continue exposing him and bringing them down.
[2:45:39.140 --> 2:45:44.140]  But that if he doesn't execute in that office that God's given him that the globalist could win.
[2:45:44.140 --> 2:45:49.140]  Ladies and gentlemen now is the time more than ever to pray for President Trump and please pray for him for worse
[2:45:49.140 --> 2:45:52.140]  and please pray for all the children being targeted by the globalist.
[2:45:52.140 --> 2:45:55.140]  Thank you and God bless you all.
[2:45:55.140 --> 2:46:00.140]  Cyber week is here with the biggest sales of 2019.
[2:46:00.140 --> 2:46:04.140]  No sales in our history can even approach this.
[2:46:04.140 --> 2:46:10.140]  Triple Patriot points store wide free shipping 50 to 70 percent off.
[2:46:10.140 --> 2:46:18.140]  And when you add auto ship to it on the order a lot of these products become a lost leaders
[2:46:18.140 --> 2:46:23.140]  meaning I'm losing money on them but bringing in capital so I can fund ourselves into next year.
[2:46:23.140 --> 2:46:27.140]  It is critical for folks to take advantage of these sales.
[2:46:27.140 --> 2:46:32.140]  You've ever been on the fence trying some of the products like the protein bars or turbo force and the fish oil.
[2:46:32.140 --> 2:46:40.140]  Now is the time we've got huge specials on DNA force plus our flagship product with a free bottle of brain force plus with it.
[2:46:40.140 --> 2:46:45.140]  It's all available at info or store dot com during cyber week.
[2:46:45.140 --> 2:46:53.140]  Now a lot of these cells will continue through Christmas but some of them have to end because the products are selling out info or store dot com funds the info war.
[2:46:53.140 --> 2:47:03.140]  Thank you you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:24.140 --> 2:47:27.140]  Well somebody must be intercepting the emails we send to David.
[2:47:27.140 --> 2:47:29.140]  I because I've been trying to get him up for two years.
[2:47:29.140 --> 2:47:31.140]  He remembers like one email and he couldn't come on.
[2:47:31.140 --> 2:47:32.140]  He was busy.
[2:47:32.140 --> 2:47:37.140]  So I definitely you're going to hear David here on the show more and we appreciate him coming on.
[2:47:37.140 --> 2:47:39.140]  But there's all sorts of stuff that does go on.
[2:47:39.140 --> 2:47:44.140]  We have had our email intercepted block before that's why I told the crew more more.
[2:47:44.140 --> 2:47:50.140]  We got to pick the phone up and call people because there is a lot of weirdness going on with the AI with the control systems with the shadow banning.
[2:47:50.140 --> 2:47:53.140]  I remember just six months ago they were on CNN going.
[2:47:53.140 --> 2:47:57.140]  Let's see if Jones has WhatsApp on Facebook to privately communicate.
[2:47:57.140 --> 2:48:08.140]  They go he doesn't but thousands of other nationalists do ban them and they banned people from using private messengers like we're Al Qaeda or something.
[2:48:08.140 --> 2:48:14.140]  David I hear he's doing this segment the next little short segment that Paul Watson takes over from the UK.
[2:48:14.140 --> 2:48:16.140]  He's loaded for bear as usual.
[2:48:16.140 --> 2:48:21.140]  But David I don't mind that we swerved off into your book.
[2:48:21.140 --> 2:48:22.140]  I don't know what it was about.
[2:48:22.140 --> 2:48:23.140]  It's very interesting.
[2:48:23.140 --> 2:48:27.140]  I look forward to reading it and I actually get it.
[2:48:27.140 --> 2:48:28.140]  I'm going to read over many of your books.
[2:48:28.140 --> 2:48:30.140]  Page turners thought provoking.
[2:48:30.140 --> 2:48:31.140]  That's what's important.
[2:48:31.140 --> 2:48:35.140]  But there's no doubt there's a system that's killing us that's dumbing us down.
[2:48:35.140 --> 2:48:45.140]  That's taking us out of humanity out of love out of justice and that is turning us against each other and that says humans are bad teaching us to hate ourselves.
[2:48:45.140 --> 2:48:56.140]  Teaching us to have a post human world while they wreck the planet itself and override it with genetic engineering and the Kim trailing and which they now admit they're doing and all the rest of the craziness.
[2:48:56.140 --> 2:48:58.140]  So what's going to be admitted next.
[2:48:58.140 --> 2:49:03.140]  You have the CIA director come on say yeah we're doing exactly what people said we are but it's secret.
[2:49:03.140 --> 2:49:08.140]  What's coming next from these globalist and what's their total in game.
[2:49:08.140 --> 2:49:12.140]  I mean I mean I think it's just get rid of humans all together is what they're saying publicly now.
[2:49:12.140 --> 2:49:20.140]  I mean how fantastical is that and then how do we how do we counter this.
[2:49:20.140 --> 2:49:24.140]  Well they're going to be more and more open.
[2:49:24.140 --> 2:49:32.140]  They're going to have to be more and more open because what they're doing is being introduced.
[2:49:32.140 --> 2:49:40.140]  And along with trying to sell it in a positive way as I talked about earlier.
[2:49:40.140 --> 2:49:48.140]  Another side story to being open about it is to actually in effect say well what are you going to do about it.
[2:49:48.140 --> 2:50:01.140]  We got the power and I know you can do and they are going to try to take the power away from people by telling them that they have all the power.
[2:50:01.140 --> 2:50:04.140]  And so people go well what's the point is no point.
[2:50:04.140 --> 2:50:05.140]  You can't stop them.
[2:50:05.140 --> 2:50:06.140]  They're too powerful.
[2:50:06.140 --> 2:50:16.140]  They're not they have to persuade us that they're powerful and then they can be powerful because we believe they are.
[2:50:16.140 --> 2:50:19.140]  There's billions and billions of humans.
[2:50:19.140 --> 2:50:28.140]  The number of people in full knowledge of what they're doing in terms of this cult is tiny.
[2:50:28.140 --> 2:50:38.140]  And this is why they are desperate for people not to understand the nature of reality for a start.
[2:50:38.140 --> 2:50:43.140]  That's why it's all been suppressed because they know how reality works.
[2:50:43.140 --> 2:50:45.140]  They know this is not a solid world.
[2:50:45.140 --> 2:50:47.140]  I mean quantum physics knows that.
[2:50:47.140 --> 2:50:50.140]  So if you live in a solid world and that's how we experience it.
[2:50:50.140 --> 2:50:55.140]  Why we do can be very easily explained as I do in the books.
[2:50:55.140 --> 2:51:03.140]  And when you feel the world is solid and everything's apart from everything else then what do you have limitation.
[2:51:03.140 --> 2:51:05.140]  It's not possible.
[2:51:05.140 --> 2:51:10.140]  When I say this is happening that's happening many times people have said to me well that can't be happening.
[2:51:10.140 --> 2:51:11.140]  It's not possible.
[2:51:11.140 --> 2:51:14.140]  No it's not possible if the world's solid but it's not.
[2:51:14.140 --> 2:51:23.140]  They know that actually the base form of this reality is a wave form information fields think Wi-Fi.
[2:51:23.140 --> 2:51:29.140]  So you've got a Wi-Fi field and it's just a radiation field of information.
[2:51:29.140 --> 2:51:37.140]  But the computer simply decodes that field into a completely different reality on the screen.
[2:51:37.140 --> 2:51:45.140]  And everywhere apart from on the screen the Internet or what you see is nothing like what you're looking at.
[2:51:45.140 --> 2:51:47.140]  Only on the screen does it look like that.
[2:51:47.140 --> 2:52:00.140]  And in the same way we are decoding wave form information fields fluid wave form information fields think Wi-Fi again into this reality.
[2:52:00.140 --> 2:52:08.140]  And there's no doubt they're coming in to jam the transmissions we're getting from God the universe the information to jam it with artificiality.
[2:52:08.140 --> 2:52:13.140]  And you read their white papers they admit they're trying to stop something that humans are going to do.
[2:52:13.140 --> 2:52:23.140]  They're trying to bring in the false new age to make us think that they're saving us when they're really killing us because there is something really new coming.
[2:52:23.140 --> 2:52:26.140]  This is the whole point.
[2:52:26.140 --> 2:52:36.140]  I talked earlier about the postage stamp consensus and all that what all this perceptual programming does especially programming self identity.
[2:52:36.140 --> 2:52:43.140]  This is why they're getting this self identity politics where people self identity is getting smaller and smaller and smaller.
[2:52:43.140 --> 2:52:46.140]  And the letters describing it get longer and longer and longer.
[2:52:46.140 --> 2:52:58.140]  It's because they want us to have a myopic view of selfish island under yourself totally pissed off hating everyone around you a satanic world view.
[2:52:58.140 --> 2:53:09.140]  But also a myopic self identity so we self identify the eye with our labels your race your religion.
[2:53:09.140 --> 2:53:23.140]  It's false it's false labeling false programming so that it's a jamming what the real universe is putting up fake icons that they're teaching us through political correctness is literally to sabotage reality and not let us even to code third dimensional transmissions.
[2:53:23.140 --> 2:53:31.140]  But yeah so what they're doing is they're basically putting us in a bubble a perceptual bubble.
[2:53:31.140 --> 2:53:40.140]  And that's the basis of telling someone they're a victim so you wanted to get it trans transhumanism and the transgender here it is transgender man who gave birth loses battle to be registered as a father.
[2:53:40.140 --> 2:53:52.140]  That's upside down world saying you know pig not given the right to say he can fly to the moon and back Britain's first transgender couple to allow their five year old child to begin transitioning a total cult again doing this to their daughter.
[2:53:52.140 --> 2:54:03.140]  Here's another one favorite drag queen story time author likes pedophile Instagram post talking about hashtag young boy lover hashtag pedophilia hashtag.
[2:54:03.140 --> 2:54:16.140]  I mean it's all right here scroll through that for folks with all of this open Satanism and the coming out and these people all dress like demons and drag queen story time and women bringing their children to offer them up to men.
[2:54:16.140 --> 2:54:24.140]  Many of them convicted pedophiles what in the hell is going on there David will this externalization of this.
[2:54:24.140 --> 2:54:31.140]  Well I would like to comment on that because it's very important in terms of some of the subject of public but I could just finish this one point.
[2:54:31.140 --> 2:54:34.140]  Oh yes you just said make sure I bring that up and go ahead.
[2:54:34.140 --> 2:54:46.140]  Sure and I want to talk about it. I'll be very brief. So we've been putting this perceptual bubble and all the information we get which forms our perceptions of self and the world is within this bubble.
[2:54:46.140 --> 2:54:55.140]  But actually if we open our minds particularly open our hearts we can access levels of expanded awareness.
[2:54:55.140 --> 2:55:04.140]  That gives you a vast greater fix on the world and reality than ever that does.
[2:55:04.140 --> 2:55:19.140]  And what they want to do with this smart grid this connecting the human brain to artificial intelligence is to stop us expanding our consciousness into greater levels of awareness understanding
[2:55:19.140 --> 2:55:25.140]  and that's admitted the White House science are said we put floor on the water to lower your IQ to make you more manageable.
[2:55:25.140 --> 2:55:28.140]  They admit they're doing it. Talk about criminal activity.
[2:55:28.140 --> 2:55:32.140]  Exactly. And so that's that that's what it's all about.
[2:55:32.140 --> 2:55:41.140]  Anyway in terms of the transgender thing this this this relates to the whole smart grid technological agenda.
[2:55:41.140 --> 2:55:51.140]  They want in the end to change the nature of the human body so it becomes a synthetic a synthetic human body.
[2:55:51.140 --> 2:55:59.140]  They're already working on it sometimes in the open overwhelmingly in in the secret bases and projects.
[2:55:59.140 --> 2:56:14.140]  This synthetic human will not have gender and will not be able to procreate which takes us into brave new world and the world hatchery method of technological
[2:56:14.140 --> 2:56:29.140]  produce of children which is what Aldous actually was talking about in the world hatcheries. And so what they are doing is preparing people to be young as well because they're with the adults for the no gender world.
[2:56:29.140 --> 2:56:39.140]  So what this is the process confuse gender confuse gender confuse gender confuse gender fuse gender fuse gender no gender human.
[2:56:39.140 --> 2:56:55.140]  And because they are looking at a technological procreation instead of a human procreation they don't need men and women anymore because they don't need to procreate because
[2:56:55.140 --> 2:57:04.140]  they're that's going to be done another way. And so what is happening with this transgender indoctrination which is so disgusting.
[2:57:04.140 --> 2:57:12.140]  It's not because again it's not about protecting transgender people from from discrimination.
[2:57:12.140 --> 2:57:19.140]  It's about forcing this agenda and attacking the name man and woman and attacking the very biological jump point of the third dimension.
[2:57:19.140 --> 2:57:35.140]  Well in the same way that the school system which has been completely taken over for this agenda has been indoctrinating children into the climate cult agenda to terrify them at the world's going to win.
[2:57:35.140 --> 2:57:45.140]  So they are being at the same time indoctrinated into and boy are they back in two minutes with the final second day of the night. And then we've got all Joseph Watson.
[2:57:45.140 --> 2:57:54.140]  The last few days I've been online looking for the speech actually read it in a book about Winston Churchill many years ago and I've found a few places where it's mentioned.
[2:57:54.140 --> 2:57:57.140]  But if you can find it please send it to showtipstemforewords.com.
[2:57:57.140 --> 2:58:06.140]  And he talked about in the darkest hours at the beginning of World War two the fact that there have been times in history where people had a chance to stand up and fight early on and we're sure to victory.
[2:58:06.140 --> 2:58:12.140]  Then there was a second point in history where folks have to fight even though the chances of winning are pretty steep.
[2:58:12.140 --> 2:58:20.140]  There's a third time when you know you're going to lose but you have to fight because being enslaved and being slowly killed is much much worse.
[2:58:20.140 --> 2:58:21.140]  That's a paraphrase.
[2:58:21.140 --> 2:58:29.140]  But ladies and gentlemen we are in the position now of being able to win this easily if we find our spirit find our focus and don't give up and take action.
[2:58:29.140 --> 2:58:35.140]  But if we don't stand up and get involved we're going to skip number two and go right to number three.
[2:58:35.140 --> 2:58:44.140]  That's a fact. They fear Info Wars because we are alive. It's time for the world to awaken and take back our future.
[2:58:44.140 --> 2:58:53.140]  Cyber week is here with the biggest sales of two thousand and nineteen amazing products that will change your life.
[2:58:53.140 --> 2:59:00.140]  Guaranteed not only will the products make you healthier happier more focused more energized.
[2:59:00.140 --> 2:59:07.140]  They will fund the Info Wars operation into the critical year of twenty twenty ladies and gentlemen.
[2:59:07.140 --> 2:59:10.140]  A lot of people notice I've lost weight. I have more focus.
[2:59:10.140 --> 2:59:16.140]  There's more of a sparkle in my eye and it's because I've been taking the eight pack power stack in the morning and at night.
[2:59:16.140 --> 2:59:20.140]  I've been taking X two and X three. I've been taking brain force plus.
[2:59:20.140 --> 2:59:23.140]  Quite frankly I can't take turbo force. It's just too powerful.
[2:59:23.140 --> 2:59:29.140]  I have been taking the fish oil and the krill oil when I go to sleep at night and it's totally energized my life.
[2:59:29.140 --> 2:59:34.140]  I know our products work but I'm like everybody else. I use them then I forget about them.
[2:59:34.140 --> 2:59:36.140]  Ladies and gentlemen these products are amazing.
[2:59:36.140 --> 2:59:42.140]  There's huge sales triple patriot points free shipping fifty seventy percent off in four store dot com.
[2:59:42.140 --> 2:59:43.140]  Cyber week is here.
[2:59:43.140 --> 3:00:07.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:07.140 --> 3:00:14.140]  Our final segment with David Ike Paul Watson taking over. Look at this headline wax my balls trans activists
[3:00:14.140 --> 3:00:19.140]  complains that gynecologist won't see her files more lawsuits.
[3:00:19.140 --> 3:00:26.140]  Continuing transgendered men again give birth just totally made up and then now these families.
[3:00:26.140 --> 3:00:31.140]  Where they pressure their kids to do it.
[3:00:31.140 --> 3:00:37.140]  It's it's it's it's not turning them into another sex it's giving them chemicals that end up killing them early.
[3:00:37.140 --> 3:00:42.140]  It's it's criminal activity in my view and it came out of the Tabistock Institute powerful report.
[3:00:42.140 --> 3:00:49.140]  The Gregory's put out and I get mad at the crew because they're great people but they like do these incredible reports
[3:00:49.140 --> 3:00:52.140]  and it's like no promotion. It's not brought to me.
[3:00:52.140 --> 3:00:54.140]  Not a big deal is it made about it.
[3:00:54.140 --> 3:00:57.140]  We don't even get the people that we have that have Twitter accounts to put it out.
[3:00:57.140 --> 3:01:01.140]  It's like this. Yeah. So if you don't take our stuff serious and get it out at banned on video.
[3:01:01.140 --> 3:01:06.140]  Nobody is because we got first rate reporters and stuff breaking stuff that is earth shattering.
[3:01:06.140 --> 3:01:13.140]  Because as David Ike just said he's dead on the climate change system is about teaching humans to hate themselves
[3:01:13.140 --> 3:01:16.140]  and about turning everything over to a world government system.
[3:01:16.140 --> 3:01:22.140]  And the transgenderism is of getting them ready for brain chips and everything else because if you'll accept a man's a woman
[3:01:22.140 --> 3:01:29.140]  and a woman's a dog or any of this other stuff or people put Drano in their eyes because they want to be transabled
[3:01:29.140 --> 3:01:34.140]  and then we got to pay for their tax money to take care of them then we'll put up with cyborgs.
[3:01:34.140 --> 3:01:38.140]  Closing comments on that David Ike and I appreciate you joining us today.
[3:01:38.140 --> 3:01:45.140]  Well what have you just described you just described George Orwell's two plus two equals five.
[3:01:45.140 --> 3:01:54.140]  What they're telling us is to believe that two plus two equals five and in 1984 and there were punishments
[3:01:54.140 --> 3:01:58.140]  for not accepting that even if you thought it actually equal four.
[3:01:58.140 --> 3:02:01.140]  And so what we have now are the punishments.
[3:02:01.140 --> 3:02:07.140]  You've got parents who are terrified of social services knocking on their door.
[3:02:07.140 --> 3:02:13.140]  If they don't go along with the tyranny now school which is actually a tyranny which is what they've become
[3:02:13.140 --> 3:02:17.140]  imposing these things upon children.
[3:02:17.140 --> 3:02:24.140]  But if we're going to stop this then we need to grow a pair and we need to grow a backbone
[3:02:24.140 --> 3:02:30.140]  and we need to not accept that two and two equals anything but four.
[3:02:30.140 --> 3:02:37.140]  So when people say these things that you've just described these ludicrous things
[3:02:37.140 --> 3:02:45.140]  and you get attacked for saying actually that man and a woman is the biology of humans.
[3:02:45.140 --> 3:02:50.140]  And that's not to say that people can't be transgender good luck to them.
[3:02:50.140 --> 3:02:52.140]  But that's not what this is about.
[3:02:52.140 --> 3:02:54.140]  This is not about protecting transgender people.
[3:02:54.140 --> 3:03:02.140]  It's about indoctrinating kids to become confused about their gender for a big political reason.
[3:03:02.140 --> 3:03:09.140]  If this was about protecting transgender people then when those transgender people
[3:03:09.140 --> 3:03:13.140]  and I've been reading books about this come out who've been through the surgery
[3:03:13.140 --> 3:03:16.140]  who've been through the transition and say it was a big mistake.
[3:03:16.140 --> 3:03:21.140]  I wish I hadn't bowed to the pressure to do it because it's destroyed my life.
[3:03:21.140 --> 3:03:27.140]  The transgender activists if it was about transgender people would say hey hey you know
[3:03:27.140 --> 3:03:30.140]  if you're thinking about it you know you need to listen to these people because they're you know
[3:03:30.140 --> 3:03:34.140]  they're going to be problems no no what happens to those people when they come out
[3:03:34.140 --> 3:03:40.140]  and say I made a mistake is they are abused and vilified and demonized
[3:03:40.140 --> 3:03:44.140]  because it's not about transgender it's about an agenda.
[3:03:44.140 --> 3:03:49.140]  This is why when Jewish people come out and criticize Israel
[3:03:49.140 --> 3:03:54.140]  they get more abuse from the Israeli networks than non-Jewish people.
[3:03:54.140 --> 3:03:57.140]  So it's not about protecting Jewish people it's about protecting an agenda
[3:03:57.140 --> 3:04:03.140]  which has multiple faces and what we need to do is refuse to accept
[3:04:03.140 --> 3:04:06.140]  that two and two equal anything but four.
[3:04:06.140 --> 3:04:09.140]  So when they come out with this stuff and we need to keep we're supposed to keep our heads down
[3:04:09.140 --> 3:04:14.140]  and nod we just just say it's a load of fricking rubbish.
[3:04:14.140 --> 3:04:17.140]  What are you talking about it's insane.
[3:04:17.140 --> 3:04:20.140]  Exactly men can't have babies women aren't men
[3:04:20.140 --> 3:04:24.140]  and we're not going to live in your damn crazy hellbop cult on PCP.
[3:04:24.140 --> 3:04:28.140]  That's what this is it's non-human it's evil let's reject it
[3:04:28.140 --> 3:04:30.140]  and that is what is empowering.
[3:04:30.140 --> 3:04:34.140]  David Ike please come back very very soon because two hours was not enough
[3:04:34.140 --> 3:04:37.140]  I've got so many other subjects I wanted to cover with you

[3:05:00.140 --> 3:05:04.140]  there's nowhere you can spend money there's nowhere you can place your bet
[3:05:04.140 --> 3:05:08.140]  in a fight where it's gonna have more power per dollar.
[3:05:08.140 --> 3:05:13.140]  Your bang for your buck fear gets you great products at great prices

[3:05:19.140 --> 3:05:22.140]  and so it's very simple if you don't want to be slaves
[3:05:22.140 --> 3:05:26.140]  and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy which God wants to see
[3:05:26.140 --> 3:05:30.140]  you see we have to make the effort 110% God will finish the move

[3:09:01.140 --> 3:09:04.140]  thanks Alex yeah later on in the show we're going to get into
[3:09:04.140 --> 3:09:07.140]  the latest fallout from the London Bridge attack which of course occurred
[3:09:07.140 --> 3:09:12.140]  on Friday and the family of one of the unfortunate victims
[3:09:12.140 --> 3:09:16.140]  basically saying that people shouldn't be able to have a debate
[3:09:16.140 --> 3:09:19.140]  about the early release of terrorists despite the fact that
[3:09:19.140 --> 3:09:23.140]  the early release of the terrorists in this situation was what led
[3:09:23.140 --> 3:09:28.140]  to their son's death absolutely incredible double thing taking place on that
[3:09:28.140 --> 3:09:32.140]  first I'm going to get into what broke about an hour ago which of course
[3:09:32.140 --> 3:09:36.140]  Kamala Harris dropping out of the presidential race
[3:09:36.140 --> 3:09:40.140]  following other creatures of the establishment and completely failing
[3:09:40.140 --> 3:09:44.140]  to resonate with American voters and then wondering why of course
[3:09:44.140 --> 3:09:48.140]  back a few weeks ago now she said that it was Americans
[3:09:48.140 --> 3:09:53.140]  reluctance to elect a woman of color she cited that as a reason for her
[3:09:53.140 --> 3:09:59.140]  struggles in the campaign but as you can see from an article up on Summit.News
[3:09:59.140 --> 3:10:03.140]  that was certainly not the primary reason why her campaign
[3:10:03.140 --> 3:10:07.140]  completely crated and plummeted over the last few months
[3:10:07.140 --> 3:10:11.140]  headline Kamala Harris's decline began when Tulsi Gavar
[3:10:11.140 --> 3:10:16.140]  blasted her in July debate of course this was the famous
[3:10:16.140 --> 3:10:22.140]  confrontation back on July 31st when Kamala Harris basically
[3:10:22.140 --> 3:10:27.140]  destroyed her on a hypocrisy of locking up 1500 people in
[3:10:27.140 --> 3:10:31.140]  California for marijuana use and then laughing about it herself
[3:10:31.140 --> 3:10:35.140]  when she was asked if she had ever personally smoked marijuana
[3:10:35.140 --> 3:10:39.140]  and in fact there's a predicted chart which is in this article
[3:10:39.140 --> 3:10:42.140]  which shows that Kamala Harris's presidential odds began to plummet
[3:10:42.140 --> 3:10:46.140]  immediately after Tulsi Gavar destroyed her in a July Democratic
[3:10:46.140 --> 3:10:50.140]  presidential debate and if you look at that chart
[3:10:50.140 --> 3:10:54.140]  which is a bit lower in the article there you will see that right
[3:10:54.140 --> 3:10:58.140]  as that confrontation took place back on July 31st
[3:10:58.140 --> 3:11:02.140]  her presidential aspirations absolutely plummeted
[3:11:02.140 --> 3:11:06.140]  because again the American public got to see Kamala Harris
[3:11:06.140 --> 3:11:10.140]  for exactly who she was and established total nose dive
[3:11:10.140 --> 3:11:15.140]  yeah completely crated of course she blamed
[3:11:15.140 --> 3:11:20.140]  in a turmoil with her campaign she blamed the fact that she was
[3:11:20.140 --> 3:11:23.140]  struggling to raise money but again that all occurred in the
[3:11:23.140 --> 3:11:28.140]  months after that confrontation so whereas Gavar herself has
[3:11:28.140 --> 3:11:32.140]  struggled in the polls if she had one good impact during this
[3:11:32.140 --> 3:11:36.140]  presidential campaign it was the complete destruction of the
[3:11:36.140 --> 3:11:40.140]  hopes of Kamala Harris so now you've got people all over
[3:11:40.140 --> 3:11:45.140]  Twitter complaining bitterly on the left that now the debate
[3:11:45.140 --> 3:11:49.140]  stage and this is a tweet from Lauren Ducker again a big leftist
[3:11:49.140 --> 3:11:53.140]  on Twitter she said Kamala Harris officially ended her campaign
[3:11:53.140 --> 3:11:56.140]  today which means that all of the candidates who currently qualify
[3:11:56.140 --> 3:12:01.140]  for the December Democratic debate are white God forbid
[3:12:01.140 --> 3:12:06.140]  Sanders, Warren, Biden, Booty, George, Klobuchar and Steyer
[3:12:06.140 --> 3:12:10.140]  are all white and that apparently if you're a racist is a big
[3:12:10.140 --> 3:12:13.140]  problem and of course only racist would have a problem with
[3:12:13.140 --> 3:12:16.140]  people appearing on a stage because they have the right
[3:12:16.140 --> 3:12:20.140]  skin color or not so that is now the big narrative that
[3:12:20.140 --> 3:12:23.140]  because Kamala Harris has dropped out there are no people of
[3:12:23.140 --> 3:12:27.140]  color on the stage of course Andrew Yang is not going to
[3:12:27.140 --> 3:12:32.140]  qualify for the debate so he's out as it looks at the moment
[3:12:32.140 --> 3:12:36.140]  we've also got of course Hillary Clinton yet again still
[3:12:36.140 --> 3:12:39.140]  refusing to rule out whether she's going to run for president
[3:12:39.140 --> 3:12:42.140]  she's already missed the filing deadline for the New Hampshire
[3:12:42.140 --> 3:12:46.140]  primary but she was asked yet again and this must be the
[3:12:46.140 --> 3:12:50.140]  fifth time she was asked publicly on a show or on a stage in
[3:12:50.140 --> 3:12:54.140]  the past two months whether she would run for presidential
[3:12:54.140 --> 3:12:57.140]  election for a third time running and fail for a third time
[3:12:57.140 --> 3:12:59.140]  running no doubt during an appearance on Britain's Graeme
[3:12:59.140 --> 3:13:02.140]  Norton show Clinton was asked again about her presidential
[3:13:02.140 --> 3:13:07.140]  aspirations she cited a US women's soccer star in a book who
[3:13:07.140 --> 3:13:11.140]  retired on the tagline forget me Hillary said the intention of
[3:13:11.140 --> 3:13:14.140]  the words was to quote make a way for new people and get off
[3:13:14.140 --> 3:13:18.140]  the stage she was then asked are you saying forget me now
[3:13:18.140 --> 3:13:23.140]  Hillary responded not yet she was pressed further about whether
[3:13:23.140 --> 3:13:26.140]  she was aware of the presidential rumor mill and had been
[3:13:26.140 --> 3:13:30.140]  privileged with questions about running again she said right
[3:13:30.140 --> 3:13:33.140]  now I'm not you know planning that I'd have to make up my mind
[3:13:33.140 --> 3:13:37.140]  really quickly because it's moving very fast so when asked
[3:13:37.140 --> 3:13:40.140]  again a direct question whether she's going to run she refused
[3:13:40.140 --> 3:13:45.140]  to answer of course she appeared on PBS news hour back in
[3:13:45.140 --> 3:13:49.140]  October saying quote obviously I can beat him again referring to
[3:13:49.140 --> 3:13:52.140]  Donald Trump despite the fact that she didn't be in the first
[3:13:52.140 --> 3:13:55.140]  time round she also found the flames of speculation when she
[3:13:55.140 --> 3:13:59.140]  tweeted at Trump don't tempt me and of course long time Clinton
[3:13:59.140 --> 3:14:01.140]  advisor Dick Morris insisted that Hillary will become the
[3:14:01.140 --> 3:14:05.140]  presidential Democratic nominee because quote she believed she
[3:14:05.140 --> 3:14:08.140]  was put on earth to be president this is the level of
[3:14:08.140 --> 3:14:11.140]  arrogance we're dealing with where she's already missed the
[3:14:11.140 --> 3:14:15.140]  deadline for New Hampshire and she still refuses to rule it out
[3:14:15.140 --> 3:14:18.140]  because she thinks she has the divine right to be your
[3:14:18.140 --> 3:14:22.140]  president Morris said make no mistakes she wants it she's
[3:14:22.140 --> 3:14:26.140]  still planning on it she'll do everything she can to achieve
[3:14:26.140 --> 3:14:30.140]  it so that's what is going on there and in fact I think Tulsi
[3:14:30.140 --> 3:14:34.140]  Gabbard tweeted about this in the past few moments of course
[3:14:34.140 --> 3:14:38.140]  off the back of that confrontation with Harris in the
[3:14:38.140 --> 3:14:42.140]  debate she said sending my best wishes to Kamala Harris her
[3:14:42.140 --> 3:14:44.140]  family and supporters who have campaigned so hard while we
[3:14:44.140 --> 3:14:47.140]  disagree on some issues we agree on others and I respect
[3:14:47.140 --> 3:14:51.140]  us and see a decision to serve the American people many people
[3:14:51.140 --> 3:14:55.140]  are taking that as a little bit tongue in cheek and the is
[3:14:55.140 --> 3:14:58.140]  that in fact Tulsi Gabbard celebrating the departure of
[3:14:58.140 --> 3:15:02.140]  Kamala Harris from the race so that's why he's taking place
[3:15:02.140 --> 3:15:06.140]  there coming up in the next segment as I mentioned we're
[3:15:06.140 --> 3:15:10.140]  going to talk about the London Bridge attack because the
[3:15:10.140 --> 3:15:13.140]  Prime Minister of Britain and the expected next Prime
[3:15:13.140 --> 3:15:16.140]  Minister we have a national election next week is under
[3:15:16.140 --> 3:15:20.140]  fire basically for saying that terrorists who plan mass
[3:15:20.140 --> 3:15:23.140]  murder shouldn't be released from prison early because that's
[3:15:23.140 --> 3:15:26.140]  exactly what happened that's exactly what led to the tragic
[3:15:26.140 --> 3:15:30.140]  death the stabbing deaths of two people in London on Friday
[3:15:30.140 --> 3:15:35.140]  and now we have the parents of one of the victims slamming
[3:15:35.140 --> 3:15:38.140]  Boris Johnson for daring to suggest that terrorists should
[3:15:38.140 --> 3:15:41.140]  be locked up for more than eight years if indeed they are
[3:15:41.140 --> 3:15:44.140]  planning mass murder we're going to get into that in the
[3:15:44.140 --> 3:15:48.140]  psychological evaluations to why people on the left even when
[3:15:48.140 --> 3:15:51.140]  their own daughters and sons are dying will take this stance
[3:15:51.140 --> 3:15:54.140]  don't go I'm Dan Pilla I started fighting the IRS over 40

[3:17:59.140 --> 3:18:03.140]  many years ago and I've found a few places where it's mentioned
[3:18:03.140 --> 3:18:05.140]  but if you can find it please send it to show tips them for
[3:18:05.140 --> 3:18:08.140]  worse dot com and he talked about the darkest hours at the
[3:18:08.140 --> 3:18:10.140]  beginning of World War two the fact that there have been
[3:18:10.140 --> 3:18:13.140]  times in history where people had a chance to stand up and
[3:18:13.140 --> 3:18:15.140]  fight early on and we're sure to victory and there was a
[3:18:15.140 --> 3:18:18.140]  second point in history where folks have to fight even though
[3:18:18.140 --> 3:18:22.140]  the chances of winning are pretty steep there's a third time
[3:18:22.140 --> 3:18:25.140]  when you know you're going to lose but you have to fight
[3:18:25.140 --> 3:18:28.140]  because being enslaved and being slowly killed is much much
[3:18:28.140 --> 3:18:32.140]  worse that's a paraphrase but ladies and gentlemen we are in
[3:18:32.140 --> 3:18:35.140]  the position now of being able to win this easily if we find
[3:18:35.140 --> 3:18:38.140]  our spirit find our focus and don't give up and take action
[3:18:38.140 --> 3:18:41.140]  but if we don't stand up and get involved we're going to
[3:18:41.140 --> 3:18:45.140]  skip number two and go right to number three that's a fact
[3:18:45.140 --> 3:18:48.140]  they fear info wars because we are alive it's time for the
[3:18:48.140 --> 3:18:53.140]  world to awaken and take back our future Andy in Florida
[3:18:53.140 --> 3:18:57.140]  thank you Andy go ahead hey Alex I love you man we love you
[3:18:57.140 --> 3:19:00.140]  before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand I got to
[3:19:00.140 --> 3:19:02.140]  talk about one of your product a little bit about me I'm
[3:19:02.140 --> 3:19:05.140]  two hundred forty five pounds I work about ten to thirteen
[3:19:05.140 --> 3:19:08.140]  hours a day at UPS and make a long story short I used to
[3:19:08.140 --> 3:19:12.140]  have a problem with Adderall I do have ADHD but you know I was
[3:19:12.140 --> 3:19:15.140]  taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties you know
[3:19:15.140 --> 3:19:17.140]  I kind of got a little out of hand and you know I listen to
[3:19:17.140 --> 3:19:19.140]  you religiously in my truck every day so I tried your
[3:19:19.140 --> 3:19:22.140]  turbo force and really it's a cliche this product changed my
[3:19:22.140 --> 3:19:25.140]  life but turbo force really changed my life and it was a
[3:19:25.140 --> 3:19:28.140]  day I no longer take Adderall and I get by literally the
[3:19:28.140 --> 3:19:31.140]  thirteen hours a day I work on a half of a packet of your
[3:19:31.140 --> 3:19:34.140]  turbo force and if you take a half a packet that's literally
[3:19:34.140 --> 3:19:37.140]  a dollar a day and you save so much money versus you know a
[3:19:37.140 --> 3:19:39.140]  monster which is what four ninety nine and you know I just
[3:19:39.140 --> 3:19:42.140]  had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is and
[3:19:42.140 --> 3:19:44.140]  if anybody's on the fence they really have to try it we're
[3:19:44.140 --> 3:19:47.140]  really proud of turbo force so thank you sir commit to buy a
[3:19:47.140 --> 3:19:49.140]  lot of your products in four store dot com then help us
[3:19:49.140 --> 3:19:52.140]  spread the word let's just get busy in four store dot com
[3:19:52.140 --> 3:19:58.140]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:20:04.140 --> 3:20:10.140]  you're listening to summit dot news with Paul Joseph
[3:20:10.140 --> 3:20:11.140]  Watson
[3:20:16.140 --> 3:20:20.140]  I've pulled up a historical description of Aztec child
[3:20:20.140 --> 3:20:23.140]  sacrifice because I think it ties into what we're seeing in
[3:20:23.140 --> 3:20:27.140]  contemporary times especially with in some cases how even
[3:20:27.140 --> 3:20:32.140]  the parents of victims of terrorist attacks react after
[3:20:32.140 --> 3:20:37.140]  the attacks says Aztec child sacrifice child sacrifice as
[3:20:37.140 --> 3:20:40.140]  part of Aztec human sacrifice and was performed on a regular
[3:20:40.140 --> 3:20:44.140]  basis children were sacrificed at the Aztec God slaloc the
[3:20:44.140 --> 3:20:48.140]  rain god remnants of forty two children sacrificed to this
[3:20:48.140 --> 3:20:53.140]  God have been found in the great pyramid and this really ties
[3:20:53.140 --> 3:20:56.140]  into what's going on today at one time people sacrifice their
[3:20:56.140 --> 3:20:59.140]  children to the rain god we have to ask the question now are
[3:20:59.140 --> 3:21:03.140]  people sacrificing their children to the gods of political
[3:21:03.140 --> 3:21:07.140]  correctness because we had a major terror attack in London on
[3:21:07.140 --> 3:21:11.140]  Friday two people dead it would have been many more if
[3:21:11.140 --> 3:21:15.140]  citizens hadn't of intervened and attacked this terrorist until
[3:21:15.140 --> 3:21:18.140]  the police could arrive to shoot him dead by the way people
[3:21:18.140 --> 3:21:21.140]  were very upset about the fact that he was shot dead by police
[3:21:21.140 --> 3:21:26.140]  we had a story up on summit dot news about that on Friday but
[3:21:26.140 --> 3:21:30.140]  of course they had to grab fire extinguishers they had to grab
[3:21:30.140 --> 3:21:35.140]  I think whale tusks to fend off this terrorist they see one of
[3:21:35.140 --> 3:21:39.140]  the citizens disarmed disarmed him of his knife of course no
[3:21:39.140 --> 3:21:43.140]  legal right to firearms in Great Britain so they had to grab
[3:21:43.140 --> 3:21:47.140]  whatever weapons they could to take down the bad guy and in
[3:21:47.140 --> 3:21:50.140]  the aftermath of this attack it emerged that the terrorist in
[3:21:50.140 --> 3:21:55.140]  question had been sentenced to sixteen years in prison just
[3:21:55.140 --> 3:21:59.140]  sixteen years in prison for literally plotting to bomb the
[3:21:59.140 --> 3:22:04.140]  London stock exchange and carry out mass murder he was released
[3:22:04.140 --> 3:22:08.140]  after just after serving just eight years of that prison
[3:22:08.140 --> 3:22:11.140]  sentence and that was the primary reason why he went on to
[3:22:11.140 --> 3:22:16.140]  carry out that attack and now you see him in a video by the way
[3:22:16.140 --> 3:22:21.140]  from 2008 complaining about Islamophobia and how people
[3:22:21.140 --> 3:22:24.140]  calling Muslims terrorists is very offensive and politically
[3:22:24.140 --> 3:22:27.140]  incorrect so the guy who was complaining about Muslims being
[3:22:27.140 --> 3:22:31.140]  called terrorists saying that was Islamophobic went on to
[3:22:31.140 --> 3:22:36.140]  become a Muslim terrorist eleven years later killing two people
[3:22:36.140 --> 3:22:40.140]  the headline here out of Sky News London Bridge terror attack
[3:22:40.140 --> 3:22:43.140]  victim Jack Merritt's father launches veiled attack on Boris
[3:22:43.140 --> 3:22:48.140]  Johnson and by the way Jack Merritt out of Cambridge University
[3:22:48.140 --> 3:22:52.140]  had written a paper and was studying on the basis of how it
[3:22:52.140 --> 3:22:57.140]  was really wrong and really harsh on prisoners to keep them in
[3:22:57.140 --> 3:23:01.140]  prison for an elongated length of time he was actually campaigning
[3:23:01.140 --> 3:23:06.140]  to reduce prison sentences and his death was precisely because
[3:23:06.140 --> 3:23:10.140]  the terrorist in question had his prison sentence reduced now
[3:23:10.140 --> 3:23:13.140]  in the aftermath of this we've had a big public debate in the UK
[3:23:13.140 --> 3:23:17.140]  about whether prison sentences for terrorists are too short and
[3:23:17.140 --> 3:23:22.140]  why are terrorists being released too early in fact they
[3:23:22.140 --> 3:23:27.140]  arrested another terrorist after this attack who had also
[3:23:27.140 --> 3:23:30.140]  been released very early despite being involved in planning
[3:23:30.140 --> 3:23:34.140]  terrorist acts they immediately arrested him because they feared
[3:23:34.140 --> 3:23:38.140]  he was planning a new attack so that is a completely legitimate
[3:23:38.140 --> 3:23:42.140]  debate to have and yet now we have this the father of a man
[3:23:42.140 --> 3:23:44.140]  killed in last week's London Bridge terror attack has launched
[3:23:44.140 --> 3:23:47.140]  a veiled attack on Boris Johnson for using the incident to
[3:23:47.140 --> 3:23:51.140]  call for tougher criminal sentencing Dave Merritt father of 25
[3:23:51.140 --> 3:23:54.140]  year old Jack said his son would be livid at his death and his
[3:23:54.140 --> 3:23:57.140]  life being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave
[3:23:57.140 --> 3:24:02.140]  his everything fighting against now it's okay to have respect
[3:24:02.140 --> 3:24:06.140]  for the victims of terrorist attacks and yet then want to engage
[3:24:06.140 --> 3:24:11.140]  in a debate about how we stop future terrorist attacks that
[3:24:11.140 --> 3:24:14.140]  not be described as being offensive to the victims if it's
[3:24:14.140 --> 3:24:17.140]  coming out of a genuine place.
[3:24:17.140 --> 3:24:20.140]  But he said don't use my son's death and his and his colleagues
[3:24:20.140 --> 3:24:24.140]  photos to promote your vile propaganda Jack stood against
[3:24:24.140 --> 3:24:28.140]  everything you stand for hatred division ignorance.
[3:24:28.140 --> 3:24:32.140]  So Boris Johnson came out again on the eve of an election in
[3:24:32.140 --> 3:24:35.140]  the United Kingdom and pledged after the terror attack to end
[3:24:35.140 --> 3:24:38.140]  the early release of prisoners convicted of terrorist or
[3:24:38.140 --> 3:24:42.140]  extremist offences after it emerged Khan was a convicted
[3:24:42.140 --> 3:24:46.140]  terrorist wearing an electronic tag after being released halfway
[3:24:46.140 --> 3:24:50.140]  through a 16 year prison sentence for plotting to bomb the
[3:24:50.140 --> 3:24:54.140]  London Stock Exchange they see the other victim in the attack
[3:24:54.140 --> 3:24:58.140]  who was also present at this conference which again was
[3:24:58.140 --> 3:25:03.140]  about reducing sentences for dangerous prisoners that's where
[3:25:03.140 --> 3:25:06.140]  the attack started that's where those two victims were
[3:25:06.140 --> 3:25:10.140]  unfortunately killed before he then ran out onto the bridge
[3:25:10.140 --> 3:25:13.140]  and was taken down by the brave citizens.
[3:25:13.140 --> 3:25:17.140]  So we have this whole debate now with the left saying how dare
[3:25:17.140 --> 3:25:21.140]  you want to stop terrorists carrying out terrorist attacks
[3:25:21.140 --> 3:25:24.140]  how dare you want to keep dangerous terrorists in prison
[3:25:24.140 --> 3:25:28.140]  who've literally plotted mass murder literally plotted to
[3:25:28.140 --> 3:25:30.140]  bomb the London Stock Exchange.
[3:25:30.140 --> 3:25:34.140]  And the reason I read out that Aztec baby sacrifice thing
[3:25:34.140 --> 3:25:38.140]  was because in a modern parlance we see this again and again
[3:25:38.140 --> 3:25:41.140]  with people literally willing to sacrifice their children
[3:25:41.140 --> 3:25:44.140]  for the gods of political correctness and campaign
[3:25:44.140 --> 3:25:48.140]  against hardcore legal measures that would have prevented
[3:25:48.140 --> 3:25:52.140]  in many cases their sons and daughters from dying.
[3:25:52.140 --> 3:25:57.140]  We have this headline from back in 2016 family of EU
[3:25:57.140 --> 3:26:00.140]  officials teenage daughter who was raped and killed by
[3:26:00.140 --> 3:26:04.140]  Afghan migrant as for well wishes to donate money to
[3:26:04.140 --> 3:26:09.140]  refugee charity as teenage killer is revealed.
[3:26:09.140 --> 3:26:12.140]  This was the family of a teenage daughter who was
[3:26:12.140 --> 3:26:16.140]  allegedly raped and murdered by an Afghan migrant in Germany.
[3:26:16.140 --> 3:26:19.140]  Again he literally strangled her to death and drowned her
[3:26:19.140 --> 3:26:23.140]  in a river and the parents came out and said donate money
[3:26:23.140 --> 3:26:27.140]  to migrant causes medical student Maria Landenberger
[3:26:27.140 --> 3:26:30.140]  who had also taken time out to help asylum seekers as a
[3:26:30.140 --> 3:26:32.140]  volunteer.
[3:26:32.140 --> 3:26:36.140]  What does that remind you of again I did an entire video
[3:26:36.140 --> 3:26:39.140]  about this where in many cases the unfortunate victim to
[3:26:39.140 --> 3:26:43.140]  rapes and killed by migrants by refugees who turn out to be
[3:26:43.140 --> 3:26:47.140]  actual terrorists in some cases campaigned for refugee
[3:26:47.140 --> 3:26:49.140]  charities.
[3:26:49.140 --> 3:26:51.140]  She was found dead in a river in the southwestern German
[3:26:51.140 --> 3:26:54.140]  University University City of Freiburg in October this
[3:26:54.140 --> 3:26:56.140]  was 2016.
[3:26:56.140 --> 3:26:59.140]  The first picture since the merger of Hussain K.
[3:26:59.140 --> 3:27:01.140]  He was the 17 year old Afghan asylum seeker who was
[3:27:01.140 --> 3:27:06.140]  arrested on suspicion of the rape and murder.
[3:27:06.140 --> 3:27:08.140]  As the 19 year old students family tries to come to terms
[3:27:08.140 --> 3:27:11.140]  with their loss they have asked for donations to be made
[3:27:11.140 --> 3:27:14.140]  to an organization that aids refugees.
[3:27:14.140 --> 3:27:17.140]  So they literally came out and asked I think even at the
[3:27:17.140 --> 3:27:21.140]  funeral itself they came out and asked for donations to
[3:27:21.140 --> 3:27:26.140]  refugee charities having had their daughter killed by a
[3:27:26.140 --> 3:27:32.140]  one-time refugee and that's not the only example of this.
[3:27:32.140 --> 3:27:35.140]  Of course we had mass molestation of women in Cologne on
[3:27:35.140 --> 3:27:37.140]  New Year's Eve 2015.
[3:27:37.140 --> 3:27:42.140]  How did feminists react to 2,000 women being sexually
[3:27:42.140 --> 3:27:47.140]  abused in some cases outright raped by predominantly
[3:27:47.140 --> 3:27:50.140]  migrant men from North Africa and the Middle East back on
[3:27:50.140 --> 3:27:52.140]  New Year's Eve 2015.
[3:27:52.140 --> 3:27:54.140]  Of course we all remember the horrific videos of that,
[3:27:54.140 --> 3:27:56.140]  the absolute chaos.
[3:27:56.140 --> 3:27:59.140]  They reacted by apologizing for xenophobia.
[3:27:59.140 --> 3:28:02.140]  This is an info wars.com headline.
[3:28:02.140 --> 3:28:05.140]  Cologne women apologized for xenophobia by giving
[3:28:05.140 --> 3:28:08.140]  migrants roses following mass molestation.
[3:28:08.140 --> 3:28:11.140]  Women in Cologne responded to the mass molestation by
[3:28:11.140 --> 3:28:13.140]  predominantly Muslim migrants that occurred on New Year's
[3:28:13.140 --> 3:28:17.140]  Eve by visiting the city's largest refugee center and
[3:28:17.140 --> 3:28:21.140]  handing out roses as a gesture against xenophobia.
[3:28:21.140 --> 3:28:24.140]  What did we see last week in Paris?
[3:28:24.140 --> 3:28:28.140]  We saw a big feminist march against sexual assault
[3:28:28.140 --> 3:28:30.140]  committed by men.
[3:28:30.140 --> 3:28:33.140]  About three or four protesters turned up with signs
[3:28:33.140 --> 3:28:37.140]  pointing out that the majority of sexual abuse in Paris is
[3:28:37.140 --> 3:28:41.140]  being carried out by migrant men, by asylum seekers.
[3:28:41.140 --> 3:28:43.140]  What happened to those women?
[3:28:43.140 --> 3:28:45.140]  They were hounded, they were physically attacked,
[3:28:45.140 --> 3:28:47.140]  they were driven out of the protest.
[3:28:47.140 --> 3:28:49.140]  We'll be back with more of this on the other side,
[3:28:49.140 --> 3:28:50.140]  summit.news.
