[00:00.000 --> 00:11.200]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:11.200 --> 00:33.440]  it's thursday march 19th 2020 the globe is in one of the greatest crises it's ever faced
[00:33.440 --> 00:42.720]  it is a psychological warfare operation that at its heart has a kernel of truth this virus
[00:43.360 --> 00:50.720]  is deadly for the old and for the sick and almost 500 people died in idly alone yesterday
[00:51.520 --> 00:58.240]  from the virus coming up next segment we'll show you the video of the army convoys rolling out
[00:58.240 --> 01:04.720]  like scenes from the last man on earth with Vincent Price loaded with dead bodies to be
[01:04.720 --> 01:14.960]  taken to mass cremation fields unbelievable also the footage of all over the world now drones
[01:14.960 --> 01:20.000]  giving orders to people to stay off the streets the globalists have their technocracy in place
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.520]  their robot enforcers are here all of it choreographed worldwide all of it concerted all
[01:27.520 --> 01:34.080]  of it to suppress humanity and train us to live under martial law and to give trillions in bailout
[01:34.080 --> 01:42.880]  money to big box stores the airlines casinos but not to the mom and pops it is a vertical integration
[01:42.880 --> 01:48.400]  it is a consolidation of power trump tried to bucket we warned him that they were going to set
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.360]  him up and said that he caused it to get worse so he needed to compensate i think he over compensated
[01:53.360 --> 02:01.040]  now getting into the hype uh and now they're driving forward for total complete late stage
[02:01.040 --> 02:08.320]  martial law to be implemented everything we ever warned you about exactly as we warned you about
[02:08.320 --> 02:15.200]  it is now happening if our giant compendium wasn't erased off youtube it'd be easy to find but
[02:15.760 --> 02:20.960]  you remember in your mind that i said specifically they would use a bio weapons release probably
[02:20.960 --> 02:25.840]  out of china to bring in the world government and to make the people submit because billa melinda
[02:25.840 --> 02:31.440]  gates and others said that's what they were going to do in fact we put together a four minute
[02:31.440 --> 02:36.880]  compilation which is only a small sampling of it would be like an hour long of billa melinda gates
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.880]  and others openly bragging about depopulating the earth and how great it's going to be to kill
[02:42.880 --> 02:51.760]  all of the old people off so we're going to be airing that report premiering it coming up at
[02:51.760 --> 02:57.520]  the bottom of the hour and of course bill gates is involved at every level of this in the pre-planning
[02:57.520 --> 03:03.520]  in the hyping of it now in the response everywhere you go he's running the operation as the chief
[03:03.520 --> 03:10.640]  science officer of the new world order he is more important than anyone on earth even more so than
[03:10.640 --> 03:17.760]  president trump if any man has a direct line to be else above it is bill gates he is in command
[03:19.200 --> 03:27.840]  he is the chief science officer of satan on this planet running the entire show his father was one
[03:27.840 --> 03:34.640]  of the top science officers running the depopulation operation on record and it's a family business and
[03:34.640 --> 03:43.280]  the business is kicking into high gear to help call the herd in his own words prince philip let's
[03:43.280 --> 03:50.080]  just say is very pleased with what's going on and very pleased with the hysterical response
[03:51.680 --> 03:56.560]  of the public now i want to be clear the virus is deadly and that's the kernel of truth of the
[03:56.560 --> 04:00.320]  heart of it so people that are saying get ready protect yourself they're absolutely right but
[04:00.320 --> 04:07.200]  the response and the piggybacking and and the authoritarians absolutely exacerbating the the
[04:07.200 --> 04:12.800]  panic to make it as bad as possible to erase all the hard-worn one freedoms that we've
[04:12.800 --> 04:18.960]  had since the magna carta in 1215 that is absolutely the real long-standing threat
[04:18.960 --> 04:26.240]  and the financial integration and vertical integration that top globalist bloodhounds
[04:26.240 --> 04:32.000]  and wolves are licking their chops a few months ago before the hype began they all
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.640]  shorted the stock market and then right on time the virus came roaring out of wuhan but you're
[04:38.640 --> 04:45.920]  not supposed to say that or you're racist it's all coming up straight ahead on the most hated
[04:45.920 --> 04:51.840]  dreaded broadcast the most censored transmission in the world but thanks to you the transmission's

[06:35.680 --> 06:42.240]  time lapse footage of that thank you for joining us on this live original uncensored unfiltered
[06:42.240 --> 06:51.600]  transmission of info wars on alex jones it is thursday march 19 2020 228 228 until we have the
[06:51.600 --> 06:58.800]  historic election and coming up we're going to get into the public plan by the globalist you've
[06:59.440 --> 07:06.160]  you've seen the democrats you you've seen msnbc cnn you've seen bill mar you've seen them celebrate
[07:06.160 --> 07:14.160]  and say we want a recession or depression to punish trump voters and kill the u.s economy so we submit
[07:15.440 --> 07:21.760]  and it's worth it to take the hit bill mar just said that two weeks ago again and now you see
[07:22.640 --> 07:28.320]  our economy targeted china says they fixed it no more problem there no more hysteria no more images
[07:28.320 --> 07:33.920]  of into the world to scare us real deaths are going on but hyping it up as much as they can
[07:33.920 --> 07:39.680]  and now we're told a hundred percent are back to work everything's fine probably not true but it
[07:39.680 --> 07:45.600]  doesn't matter because we've moved on to europe and america and the e you that's collapsing and
[07:45.600 --> 07:51.360]  their authority collapsing now has an excuse to clamp down and control everyone and here in america
[07:51.360 --> 07:56.480]  we're not worried about the pedophile rings and the democrats and joe biden being the first uh
[07:56.480 --> 08:03.520]  you know democrat presidential nominee that openly has dementia bernie sanders about to drop out
[08:08.000 --> 08:15.440]  it's incredible so now we get to stay in our homes now we get to have special special
[08:15.440 --> 08:19.680]  government issued cell phone apps that they're going to be announcing the next few weeks uh
[08:19.680 --> 08:24.560]  that that tell you when you can go out and what you can do and and we're all just going to learn
[08:24.560 --> 08:30.320]  how to be land of the cowards home of the slaves but the southern border trump says he sealed it
[08:30.320 --> 08:33.760]  but it's still wide open our reporters are just down there two days ago we've got one of the
[08:33.760 --> 08:39.920]  reporters in studio tim reams former recon marine and patriot and well he's worked for some other
[08:39.920 --> 08:44.800]  three letter agencies we won't mention but he's a really smart guy got all the degrees too but
[08:44.800 --> 08:50.240]  just says those are worthless and he went down to the border with rob do and knocked a bunch of balls
[08:50.240 --> 08:55.280]  out of the park showing you what's really happening you're going to get locked down
[08:56.640 --> 09:02.640]  but the borders really aren't going to be locked down when the tbs brought in and the
[09:03.680 --> 09:06.720]  black plague and all the rest of it
[09:09.760 --> 09:13.120]  and it could all be secured very very quickly but the whole system is sabotaged
[09:13.120 --> 09:18.640]  all right let me let me lay a few things out here first
[09:22.160 --> 09:27.760]  the real number that emerged about a week ago is now confirmed the government's looking at 18 months
[09:29.360 --> 09:34.560]  the EU first announced this last week 18 months of lockdown so see first they tell you oh it's just
[09:34.560 --> 09:40.960]  two weeks also always two weeks and then killing on is going to bring down the deep state
[09:40.960 --> 09:46.800]  two weeks and we'll see all the indictments happen that's what happened for three years well
[09:46.800 --> 09:51.520]  same thing oh two weeks you'll be a lot out of your houses but notice every couple days they
[09:51.520 --> 09:58.720]  announced more restrictions more controls until they get the depression they're looking for
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.360]  and they've been very very public about how they want this depression and then the people that
[10:05.360 --> 10:12.000]  are out promoting that it's a depression are saying Trump's got to lock everything down to stop a
[10:12.000 --> 10:20.000]  depression but actually when he locks it down it's going to cause the depression but here's the new
[10:20.000 --> 10:28.400]  headline US government is prepping for an 18 month pandemic and critical shortages oh the
[10:28.400 --> 10:31.840]  articles on info wars.com it links to all the government statements saying they're going to
[10:31.840 --> 10:35.840]  run out of a bunch of stuff and that the factories are already grinding to a halt and the supply
[10:35.840 --> 10:41.040]  chains are already breaking down but if you turn on the nightly news
[10:44.640 --> 10:50.720]  if you turn on the nightly news you would never know that they're telling you it's all a conspiracy
[10:50.720 --> 10:57.600]  theory no need to get stocked up on anything here's some footage from a Costco the full footage is
[10:57.600 --> 11:08.560]  up on info wars.com in California Costco in Cyprus California when you didn't prep because prepping
[11:08.560 --> 11:12.000]  is for paranoia this is what ends up happening here's the footage
[11:15.120 --> 11:18.880]  getting for radio listeners on their right they leave the store and they begin walking to the
[11:18.880 --> 11:24.640]  parking lot down around the back of the store and then down the street and then they stop as the line
[11:24.640 --> 11:33.040]  continues to have more people added to it remember what Bernie Sanders said he says we
[11:33.040 --> 11:42.640]  have too many choices in stores and he said we need to learn how to stand in line you do not need
[11:42.640 --> 11:50.160]  30 types of the old rent you do not need full shelves you need to learn to stand in line because
[11:50.160 --> 11:57.440]  oh and boy you want to stand in line you live like Venezuela you are going to so I said it
[11:57.440 --> 12:07.120]  stretches for a mile as you can see I'm not joking here and more people loop around lining up as
[12:07.120 --> 12:19.600]  they go all in full total panic mode huh so let me just tell you again when I told everybody
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.160]  four weeks ago you better get your food orders in we're looking at if this continues which it will
[12:25.360 --> 12:29.440]  not being able to take new orders because we wouldn't be able to fulfill it in a timely fashion
[12:29.440 --> 12:34.080]  all the other food manufacturers we ordered from six different ones lied since seven days none of
[12:34.080 --> 12:39.440]  it ever came in stuff I ordered six weeks ago if you ordered from our supplier they had it and most
[12:39.440 --> 12:43.680]  of you already got your food but they made the decision when they were saying they were going
[12:43.680 --> 12:50.560]  to push it out even longer to say no more new orders to focus on getting the other orders out and
[12:50.560 --> 12:54.080]  then they talked to all the other big suppliers and they said the big box stores have already bought
[12:54.080 --> 13:00.640]  everything up that was left at twice the price it was you're about to see food prices go way up and
[13:02.240 --> 13:08.080]  that there's it's all breaking down the truck drivers are still delivering but most people in
[13:08.080 --> 13:12.960]  the warehouses have panicked to put their tail between their legs and run home not understanding
[13:12.960 --> 13:19.120]  you're going to get a big giant great depression now and if it really collapses millions will
[13:19.120 --> 13:23.680]  starve to death seven million major universities look it up starved to death during the great
[13:23.680 --> 13:30.160]  depression in the united states caused death malnutrition so if the infrastructure goes down
[13:30.160 --> 13:36.000]  hey you want to be scared you want to get into the virus and oh my gosh you know it's killed
[13:36.000 --> 13:42.960]  however many 15,000 in china and you know who knows six seven eight thousand in in italy if you

[20:59.760 --> 21:06.560]  the hospitals weighed that down many of the nurses worked in nursing homes part time and had old
[21:06.560 --> 21:12.800]  people in the hospitals and almost all the deaths were people in the hospitals where the healthy
[21:12.800 --> 21:22.560]  nurses got the virus incubated it and then spread it to the old people now remember what bill gates
[21:22.560 --> 21:28.640]  talked about we're going to play this bill gates compilation here in a moment he told teacher groups
[21:28.640 --> 21:34.000]  and others if you kill an old person and don't give them the end of life care that they would get
[21:34.000 --> 21:40.480]  in the last five years of life you can hire 10 teachers the idea of we kill people we have
[21:40.480 --> 21:45.120]  more resources no we grow the pie we don't shrink the pie it's not finite it's a non-zero
[21:45.120 --> 21:53.920]  some game and then he did ted tv talks about all this so that's what happened in italy yes the virus
[21:53.920 --> 22:02.320]  is bad news and yes if you're above 60 and have any health problems you probably should self quarantine
[22:02.320 --> 22:07.680]  so you don't get this but if you look at the curve it's going to be a big curve no matter what they
[22:07.680 --> 22:13.600]  do they say they want to space it out 18 months now we're locked up the economy is going to go under
[22:13.600 --> 22:23.120]  this has to be triaged but this is big pharma owned by the big banks and big media taking over
[22:23.120 --> 22:27.680]  and integrating the economy and doing trillions and bailouts to themselves but not to the general
[22:27.680 --> 22:34.960]  public just like in 2008 bailout no money for the public massive amounts of money trillions
[22:34.960 --> 22:44.240]  and trillions mainly to foreign banks so here is just a short sampling of bill gates who headed up
[22:44.240 --> 22:49.040]  the un disease x operation saying this mystery things coming in a few years get ready world
[22:49.040 --> 22:54.160]  government will save you then he did a tabletop exercise in november where 65 million died from
[22:54.160 --> 23:01.120]  a corona virus then he's got the patented vaccine ingredient that the i mean they've got the vaccine
[23:01.120 --> 23:06.880]  ready they send them the trials then they have all these tv shows that he finances
[23:07.520 --> 23:13.040]  about how he's a hero creating a vaccine to stop a world pandemic and out of china we get the bird
[23:13.040 --> 23:27.120]  flu the swine flu and now this and sars that's for the big pandemics all from china this one's
[23:27.120 --> 23:36.960]  man made we know that so let's go ahead and go to our good friend chief science officer of the
[23:36.960 --> 23:45.200]  new world order depopulation operation bill gates an issue that really grabbed me as as urgent uh
[23:45.760 --> 23:51.200]  was were issues related to population uh reproductive health so you've got a thing on
[23:51.200 --> 23:57.440]  the left co2 that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the
[23:57.440 --> 24:05.040]  services each person's using on average the energy on average for each service and the co2 being put
[24:05.040 --> 24:12.560]  out per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero
[24:13.280 --> 24:18.960]  probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero now that's back from a
[24:18.960 --> 24:25.680]  high school algebra but let's let's take a look the problem is that the population is growing
[24:25.680 --> 24:32.400]  the fastest where people are less able to deal with it so it's in the very poorest places
[24:32.960 --> 24:39.200]  that you're going to have a tripling in population by 2050 uh first we've got population
[24:39.760 --> 24:46.000]  now the world today has 6.8 billion people that's headed up to about 9 billion now if we do a really
[24:46.000 --> 24:52.960]  great job on new vaccines health care reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps
[24:52.960 --> 25:00.960]  10 or 15 percent but there we see an increase of uh about 1.3 now malaria is of course transmitted
[25:00.960 --> 25:08.320]  by mosquitoes i brought some here so you could uh experience this we'll let let those roam around the
[25:10.320 --> 25:14.800]  auditorium a little bit didn't really release them to create zika on record there's no reason
[25:14.800 --> 25:17.040]  only poor people should have have the experience
[25:20.720 --> 25:27.280]  they're the scientists all sick in the club not those mosquitoes are not not infected but uh
[25:28.800 --> 25:35.040]  but did you come to reproductive issues as an intellectual when i was growing up my parents
[25:35.040 --> 25:42.000]  were always involved in various uh volunteer things my dad was uh had a planned parenthood
[25:42.000 --> 25:50.880]  and it was very controversial uh to be involved with that that's a tradeoff society's making because
[25:51.440 --> 25:57.840]  of very very high medical costs and a lack of willingness to say you know is spending a million
[25:57.840 --> 26:03.280]  dollars on that last three months of life for that patient would it be better not to lay off
[26:03.840 --> 26:10.080]  the those 10 teachers and to make that tradeoff in medical costs but that's called the death panel
[26:10.080 --> 26:15.760]  uh and you're not supposed to have that discussion uh probably one of these numbers is going to have
[26:15.760 --> 26:23.120]  to get pretty near to zero today the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this
[26:24.400 --> 26:33.360]  instead it looks like this if anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades
[26:33.360 --> 26:42.480]  it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war not missiles but microbes
[26:43.040 --> 26:47.680]  what do you say to critics who claim their global vaccination program is nothing more than a eugenics
[26:47.680 --> 26:56.400]  program a huge eugenics over 48 000 children in india have been paralyzed due to polio vaccine
[26:56.400 --> 27:05.760]  point to your foundation no no i mean nothing has saved more lives than vaccination uh you know
[27:05.760 --> 27:13.440]  the key figure that we think about in terms of what we're practicing is the tragic death of young
[27:13.440 --> 27:21.200]  people and you know vaccines are about saving lives improving lives uh there's no better tool
[27:21.200 --> 27:28.320]  that mankind has ever invented for absolutely those things and you know polio the whole idea is to
[27:28.320 --> 27:37.520]  reduce uh and to zero uh the number of kids who are being paralyzed and it's during the the between
[27:37.520 --> 27:44.720]  now 2018 if things go well we expect that will become the second disease ever eradicated they
[27:44.720 --> 27:50.720]  don't call polio polio anymore they call it polio like and it's on record that that's what he does
[27:50.720 --> 27:54.400]  so he puts up an equation and says we've got to reduce humans down to zero to save the earth
[27:54.400 --> 27:59.920]  because carbon's bad not genetic engineering not uranium being dumped in the ocean but humans
[28:00.560 --> 28:04.560]  and it's all a big sick joke and they've recruited the scientific elite to be eugenicist
[28:05.280 --> 28:10.800]  and if you're a eugenicist and join the club then you get promoted again they tried to recruit my dad
[28:10.800 --> 28:16.160]  when he was in high school going to university of texas in plan two because he was you know
[28:16.160 --> 28:21.680]  testing one of the highest in the state so that's what's been going on for a long time folks and
[28:21.680 --> 28:25.280]  you can argue there's too many people you can argue folks are dumbed down you can argue they just
[28:25.280 --> 28:30.800]  watch tv all day and are lazy but you need to know that it's being done to everybody including
[28:30.800 --> 28:34.880]  those of us that don't want to be lazy and don't want to be slobs we're being hit by the gmo the
[28:34.880 --> 28:39.280]  5g and they're trying to now forcibly inoculate us with vaccines that are on record lowering
[28:39.280 --> 28:45.920]  fertility listen bill gates keep your damn hands off my children i know for a certain fact you don't
[28:45.920 --> 28:49.920]  take all your shots because you know what you're putting down and by the way it's all over the
[28:49.920 --> 28:56.240]  internet gates has failed to cover this up their depopulation project has been exposed and it's
[28:56.240 --> 29:02.560]  going to blow up in their face mark my words we can all agree these are troubled times right
[29:02.560 --> 29:08.000]  so do you know who's on your wireless network whether it's a big company selling your data

[30:00.880 --> 30:08.000]  heard of the strike it's a socialist and communist tactic but sometimes populist movements have used
[30:08.000 --> 30:14.800]  the strike you can have labor strikes you can have people that also boycott and refuse to use a
[30:14.800 --> 30:20.560]  company or a service and many times when the people actually get together and move and master the
[30:20.560 --> 30:29.520]  strike it has a great effect and some good things have come out of it but now we are seeing a global
[30:29.520 --> 30:37.920]  as corporate strike by shutting down key institutions at key times led by big tech over a month ago
[30:37.920 --> 30:44.000]  to then set the precedent to shut down small companies and businesses across the world but
[30:44.000 --> 30:52.160]  notice the big globalist corporations in the big box stores they are all exempt this is more than
[30:52.160 --> 30:56.480]  just martial law training this is the globalist trying to create a worldwide depression they
[30:56.480 --> 31:02.480]  can blame on trump and they even admit they're doing it it's all over the news it's being announced
[31:02.480 --> 31:09.440]  by politicians from germany the united states thank god coronaviruses here thank god it's going to
[31:09.440 --> 31:15.600]  kill the old people think the heavens that we're going to depopulate the planet because humanity
[31:15.600 --> 31:24.240]  is horrible humanity is evil all the hollywood movies all the propaganda all the un statements
[31:24.240 --> 31:29.440]  all the ted turner and prince philip garbage saying that they want to use a deadly virus
[31:29.440 --> 31:34.880]  to depopulate to control the population and now it's here and they want to lock down society
[31:34.880 --> 31:42.080]  and are licking their lips and saying trump isn't doing enough what a sickening in your face declaration
[31:42.080 --> 31:48.000]  of war against humanity by these control freaks who think it's their right to put fluoride in the
[31:48.000 --> 31:54.160]  water give us toxic vaccines openly dumb us down and then when we resist call us terrorists and
[31:54.160 --> 31:58.000]  conspiracy theorists when they're publicly admitting their plan to exterminate everyone
[31:58.000 --> 32:04.880]  it's time to expose the scum info wars has had to suspend all new food sales because the supply chain
[32:04.880 --> 32:11.440]  has collapsed this is a system-wide problem and this country is facing a new depression
[32:11.440 --> 32:18.800]  unless trump and the american people work together to develop a plan to expose this globalist operation
[32:19.440 --> 32:25.840]  that said people are calling and saying we wish you had the supplements in stock we wish that
[32:25.840 --> 32:32.000]  wasn't sold out they've confused that with the food everything we advertise everything we sell
[32:32.560 --> 32:39.440]  we have in the stock and we are only one day behind in shipping that means if you order on a monday
[32:39.440 --> 32:45.920]  it's shipping out on a wednesday and that's just as of today most days we are up to the day shipping
[32:45.920 --> 32:52.400]  meaning you order that day in the morning a lot of times it ships out that afternoon we have everything

[34:09.920 --> 34:16.560]  interview you don't want to miss tomorrow at high noon we're going to talk coronavirus the q
[34:16.560 --> 34:22.560]  movement ted newgent the second amendment and so much more speaking of the second amendment
[34:22.560 --> 34:30.720]  uh us government is now saying that they may cease gun sales nationwide because the fbi
[34:30.720 --> 34:35.680]  phone banks can't have people at them to take your calls when they do the background check
[34:35.680 --> 34:41.920]  isn't it convenient how the globalist control the bureaucracy still trump isn't even 10 percent
[34:41.920 --> 34:47.920]  control and they're able to then just decide what services you get and what services you don't
[34:47.920 --> 34:53.920]  know isn't that just special and all over the country democrats are banning the sale of guns
[34:53.920 --> 34:58.720]  in their towns and in their cities there's the article on info wars dot com second amendment
[34:58.720 --> 35:05.040]  red alert fbi could stop approving gun sales soon they say now i want to get to the real
[35:05.040 --> 35:15.280]  culprits here and the different facets of what's happening because again i'm not seeing the
[35:15.280 --> 35:20.640]  virus isn't deadly i'm not saying people shouldn't be concerned i'm saying the globalists are
[35:20.640 --> 35:25.840]  using the crisis to gain full control into a giant bailout for themselves and all these top
[35:25.840 --> 35:34.560]  globalists two months ago before the hysteria started shorted t us companies across the board
[35:34.560 --> 35:40.320]  that would be most hurt during this and who wouldn't be getting bailouts so we'll get to that in a
[35:40.320 --> 35:50.720]  moment we are selling out it was sold out for three weeks super silver 16 ounce nano silver

[38:50.080 --> 38:52.880]  let me just do this the time we have left the segment let me just read some headlines and
[38:52.880 --> 38:56.800]  then i'm going to come back and get into the people that are shorting the stock market
[38:56.800 --> 39:02.800]  and i went and i spent two hours on this last night uh researching what i already knew but
[39:02.800 --> 39:08.640]  just checking memory and and checking little pieces i saw it was actually going back about
[39:08.640 --> 39:15.200]  10 weeks ago that i saw these waskily wabbitz again saying that there's a depression coming
[39:15.200 --> 39:21.200]  and they're going to drive trump out with it and that uh they were getting others to come in and
[39:21.200 --> 39:28.240]  short the market to create a swarm a locust attack and of course soros has his little minions
[39:28.240 --> 39:35.680]  involved and then now these very individuals are parading around on tv as experts telling you
[39:35.680 --> 39:42.000]  that it's a great depression and it's all over and that trump's terrible and then some of these
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.800]  guys are people that famously would buy a prescription drug company and increase the price of the
[39:46.800 --> 39:56.640]  drug five thousand percent so it's just it's just sickening sickening sickening sickening people
[39:56.640 --> 39:59.760]  because they're not just trying to blame trump with this and kill the economy as they said they
[39:59.760 --> 40:06.400]  would do to bring down trump the teach americans as bill marr said to roll over and bow down just
[40:06.400 --> 40:11.680]  it's it's such a authoritarian's but they're making a buttload of money shorting the market
[40:11.680 --> 40:18.400]  and then they're also going to get the bailout out of it and now they're calling for abinadi
[40:18.400 --> 40:25.200]  and uh for made-off and uh for all these other individuals to be let out of prison because of
[40:25.200 --> 40:29.520]  the coronavirus and they're letting thousands of prisoners out in every major city it's not

[48:02.240 --> 48:10.480]  thursday edition now let's get into who stands to gain from all of this we know the virus is
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.680]  man-made that's confirmed i'll go over that more next hour we know that it was incubated in communist
[48:15.680 --> 48:20.880]  china and the left said leave our borders open to trump don't stop flights from china but he did
[48:21.520 --> 48:27.360]  then they said trump hadn't done enough and it was communist china and then idli and then the
[48:27.360 --> 48:32.240]  big tech companies and the big banks that first locked everything down to set the precedent that
[48:32.240 --> 48:37.520]  that's what you've got to do then they started saying it's going to create a depression we just
[48:37.520 --> 48:45.840]  have to accept this many stocks are going to go to zero many blue chip stocks are going to go to
[48:45.840 --> 48:53.040]  zero and we need trillions in bailouts to panic everyone and so trump did several federal reserve
[48:53.040 --> 49:01.120]  cuts trump announced a trillion dollar socialist style handout to try to kill the panic and then
[49:01.120 --> 49:11.120]  all the talking heads the billionaires the leftist the harvard mafia they marched out and got on all
[49:11.120 --> 49:19.440]  the talk shows and said trump hasn't done enough we need bigger bailouts to us to the casinos and to
[49:19.440 --> 49:26.800]  the big banks and to the airlines and we're still going to have a depression because he hasn't done
[49:26.800 --> 49:32.320]  enough to stop the spread of the virus we need total lockdown and when you watch these guys it's
[49:32.320 --> 49:37.200]  all the exact script they'll talk about oh the boomers you know they're really scared and my dad
[49:37.200 --> 49:41.520]  scared he's 80 something with a hard problem and oh it's the problems the millennials they're young
[49:41.520 --> 49:46.480]  and dumb they're spreading it they're the bad ones playing ages off against each other because
[49:46.480 --> 49:54.320]  they're talking on cnbc to older you know people investor class and it's just the right thing to
[49:54.320 --> 50:04.000]  do and that's why we did this oh and hilton's going to zero well what they don't tell you when
[50:04.000 --> 50:09.280]  they're all up they're manipulating the market on television is that they're shorting it and they
[50:09.280 --> 50:15.920]  started shorting it 10 weeks ago and i went and looked it up and they said a depression's gonna
[50:15.920 --> 50:20.320]  stop trump if i played all the clips we would take the rest of the hour up but but i do have
[50:20.320 --> 50:26.560]  someone to play next hour a bill marr and cnn and msnbc and pbs and the democrats and pelosi all
[50:26.560 --> 50:31.600]  saying we're gonna plunge the economy to get trump wow it's like saying i'm gonna burn your
[50:31.600 --> 50:36.720]  house down so your wife leaves you well your wife doesn't leave you because you burn the house down
[50:36.720 --> 50:43.120]  you go to jail like like blaming trump for what they're cheerleading and what they're implementing
[50:43.120 --> 50:50.640]  so they're using the virus fear i know i'm stating an obvious thing here to drive down the economy
[50:50.880 --> 50:55.600]  but i'll tell you the good news when i saw this video yesterday up on infoworks.com and
[50:55.600 --> 51:00.880]  apologize for watching the article i knew who the guy was already that he's a villain
[51:01.840 --> 51:05.840]  and connected to soros and then i went and looked him up and i went to the youtube of the video of
[51:05.840 --> 51:12.960]  him on national television on cnbc and almost every commenter was this is the guy that
[51:12.960 --> 51:17.040]  bought up that drug company and increased prices five thousand percent this is the guy that
[51:18.400 --> 51:22.320]  is constantly doing insider stuff and shorting things and trying to bring down u.s companies
[51:22.320 --> 51:28.640]  he calls himself an activist investor and what he works to do is go after nationalistic conservative
[51:28.640 --> 51:34.560]  operations oh but he's a harvard alum so he's part of the harvard mafia so they call him an activist
[51:34.560 --> 51:44.320]  investor yeah i guess you call hitler a activist leader so he says mr president the only answers
[51:44.320 --> 51:48.240]  are shut down the country for the next 30 days close the borders oh now liberal wants that
[51:48.240 --> 51:53.360]  tell all americans that you are putting us on an extended spring break at home with the family
[51:53.360 --> 51:58.560]  keep only essential services open the government pays wages until we reopen but then that will
[51:58.560 --> 52:04.320]  create a depression and the supply chain will break and it already is oh the left says we got
[52:04.320 --> 52:09.040]  plenty it's fine no they know scientifically with with just on time delivery that it's already
[52:09.040 --> 52:14.720]  breaking down we may already not be able to avert a depression and then you'll find out he's shorting
[52:14.720 --> 52:20.240]  all these key industries and he knows if trump orders the total shutdown they will then go down
[52:20.240 --> 52:25.040]  to close to zero and then he will buy them up and then turn the lights back on just like rothchild
[52:25.040 --> 52:30.000]  did when they beat napoleon rothchild had a fast ship go across he's carrier pigeon to get to the
[52:30.000 --> 52:36.320]  boat with the message that lord wellington had defeated napoleon in the second war they then had a
[52:37.120 --> 52:44.320]  fast corvette not a car a fast ship race across and tell the stock market lord wellington's been
[52:44.320 --> 52:49.600]  destroyed the british army's down we are now vanquished by the polian stock market went to one
[52:49.600 --> 52:54.800]  percent and lord rothchild became the richest man on earth and controlled the british empire
[52:54.800 --> 53:00.480]  that's on record that's in mainline history and the same thing's happening again today
[53:01.040 --> 53:07.920]  so billionaire bill ackerman ackman america will end as we know it unless trump shuts down the
[53:07.920 --> 53:12.640]  borders but see that that that sounds like a good conservative thing but the borders are
[53:12.640 --> 53:17.280]  porous you can't control them trump's already done that he goes on to say everybody has to be
[53:17.280 --> 53:23.520]  shut down and these industries have to be shut down and i say hilton's going to zero because
[53:23.520 --> 53:31.520]  he's shorted hilton let's play the club continue the way we are operating is until a vaccine is
[53:31.520 --> 53:38.800]  manufactured distributed and injected we will go through a depression era period in the country
[53:38.800 --> 53:43.440]  and millions of people will die around the globe and as many as a million americans
[53:43.440 --> 53:51.040]  are going to die and it's just math okay and the problem is it's a script with all of them it's
[53:51.040 --> 53:55.920]  just math it's just math but then when they lock everything down all those deaths don't happen they're
[53:55.920 --> 54:01.200]  the heroes but again i'm not debating whether the virus is deadly or not the fact is it's man made
[54:01.200 --> 54:07.200]  it came out they hyped it they shorted the markets before and they're on tv telling you it's all over
[54:07.200 --> 54:11.600]  because they're set to make billions and millions and billions individually off betting against it
[54:11.600 --> 54:16.720]  and then using their own corporations to set the precedent to shut down to start the wave rolling
[54:16.720 --> 54:24.160]  this is a chicken little event here it is and it's just math okay and the problem is if you lock down
[54:24.160 --> 54:28.880]  new york what will happen is governor qualmo will say okay we're locking down new york uh you know
[54:28.880 --> 54:33.440]  there was a rumor of that so what did everyone do everyone got out of new york okay moves went
[54:33.440 --> 54:37.440]  somewhere else because they didn't no one wants to be locked out and they and they spread the virus
[54:37.440 --> 54:42.080]  and they're not doing it you know to cause anyone harm they just don't even know that they're infected
[54:42.080 --> 54:45.680]  and by the way you look at the data from korea there's some very interesting evidence
[54:45.680 --> 54:51.600]  that suggests that people from 20 to 30 are are the massive spreaders you know the so-called are not
[54:51.600 --> 54:57.440]  you know the reproduction number of the virus i think is much higher uh particularly in that
[54:57.440 --> 55:01.200]  group of people so you have a group of people that are you know 20 to 30 the millennials they're
[55:01.760 --> 55:06.000]  what will happen is you know the hotel industry and the restaurant industry will go bankrupt first
[55:06.720 --> 55:11.920]  um bowing is you know on the brink okay bowing will not survive without a government bailout
[55:11.920 --> 55:18.640]  okay so look at airline industry auto industry restaurant industry hotel industry um you know
[55:19.920 --> 55:27.200]  capitalism does not work in an 18 month shutdown capitalism can work in a 30 day shutdown and we
[55:27.200 --> 55:32.000]  got to do the 30 day shutdown and if the president has to bring out the national guard to keep people
[55:32.000 --> 55:37.440]  in their homes which i don't think he will need to do he should do it listen to the sliminess of
[55:37.440 --> 55:43.520]  that guy's voice and then go look he's shorting those very stocks he just told you about
[55:45.120 --> 55:49.920]  oh this airline's going to zero oh this hotel's going to zero and i bet a bunch of money on that
[55:49.920 --> 55:56.000]  10 weeks ago wow did you have some good timing there little cupcake you're another one of the
[55:56.000 --> 56:01.840]  little hybrid elites that you know sits up there in that mafia that organizes the managers like you
[56:01.840 --> 56:05.520]  to go sit in those positions of power go research what he does with drug companies
[56:05.520 --> 56:09.760]  but he's a liberal it's okay that he increases prices five thousand percent when he takes over
[56:09.760 --> 56:17.120]  a company because he's liberal if you're if you're jeff bezos and have slave labor in the lowest
[56:17.120 --> 56:25.840]  wages and treated by like crap it's okay because you're he's liberal don't you understand you can
[56:25.840 --> 56:34.080]  be apple and own slave factories and and and use woogers slaves to build your devices it's okay
[56:34.080 --> 56:42.880]  tim cook is gay and when you're gay you can own slave factories and you can take whatever drug
[56:42.880 --> 56:49.040]  he's on where his pupil's under wider wide open like he's on seven hits of lsd who knows he just
[56:49.040 --> 56:58.720]  rules us that's all we know and ackman rules us oh ackman oh you're so slob oh ackman we bow to you
[56:58.720 --> 57:05.760]  you oh but he vowed reforms after he spiked the drug prices
[57:12.560 --> 57:19.120]  i shouldn't laugh hey folks we're already probably going to have a massive recession
[57:19.120 --> 57:23.760]  and if they shut things down for a month which they will do not worry you're going to get what
[57:23.760 --> 57:29.040]  all chicken littles get you're going to get a real crisis because while kicking littles running
[57:29.040 --> 57:35.360]  around freaking out squawking and yelling you know what's happening the weasel and the fox walking
[57:35.360 --> 57:44.240]  to that house and they say we're going to drink your blood real slow i'm ackman and i'm going to
[57:44.240 --> 57:48.800]  take care of you and your family i'm going to take real good care of you america under martial law
[57:48.800 --> 57:56.400]  the winds of change the waves of change are here the world has become decadent
[57:58.080 --> 58:03.680]  the population has become hypnotized and the globalists are moving in for the kill
[58:04.640 --> 58:12.880]  first they make us stupid and dumb down and put us into a trance and once they've done that
[58:12.880 --> 58:19.440]  once they've made us obsolete they begin to release the bio weapons each more deadly than
[58:19.440 --> 58:27.200]  the last as they hurt us into the bubble high tech control grid cities until they finally release
[58:27.200 --> 58:34.080]  the ultimate bio weapon with a 100 kill rate which then mutates into a harmless bug after a few years
[58:35.440 --> 58:41.040]  and the controllers emerge from their underground bunkers and of course they have the cure to all
[58:41.040 --> 58:45.280]  the diseases they release as well they admit it they publicly talk about their plan to kill us all
[58:45.920 --> 58:48.800]  a lot of liberals are celebrating this so remember who your enemies are
[58:50.240 --> 58:56.400]  ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here with the public service announcement info wars as of today
[58:56.400 --> 59:02.800]  is now suspending storable food sales we still have storable food we're able to package all the
[59:02.800 --> 59:07.280]  storable food and get it to everybody that ordered it most you've already gotten your food but the
[59:07.280 --> 59:12.720]  reason I'm making this announcement is all the other major food suppliers were sold out over a
[59:12.720 --> 59:18.080]  month ago as we first reported to you but they lied to you and they took your money well we know
[59:18.080 --> 59:24.400]  for the fact they're still taking everybody's money even though the food has all been sold out
[59:24.400 --> 59:30.640]  the basic ingredients for storable food is gone all the big box stores are paying way over normal
[59:30.640 --> 59:37.440]  prices to buy up what's left and so anybody telling you that they have storable food is lying to you
[59:37.440 --> 59:42.160]  the good news is everyone that ordered an info or store.com has already gotten it or if you ordered
[59:42.160 --> 59:47.280]  recently we have the food is being packaged and you will get it but as of now we are suspending
[59:47.280 --> 1:00:02.480]  all new food sales at infowarstore.com you're listening to the Alex Jones show waging war
[1:00:02.480 --> 1:00:09.040]  on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[1:00:09.040 --> 1:00:19.040]  and it's just math okay and the problem is if you lock down new york what will happen is
[1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:23.600]  governor Cuomo will say okay we're locking down new york uh you know there was a rumor of that
[1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:28.080]  so what did everyone do everyone got out of new york okay moved went somewhere else because they
[1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:32.400]  didn't know one wants to be locked out and they and they spread the virus and they're not doing it
[1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:36.560]  you know to cause anyone harm they just don't even know that they're infected and by the way
[1:00:36.560 --> 1:00:42.960]  if you look at the data from korea this is very interesting evidence
[1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:45.680]  escape from new york becomes reality
[1:00:50.960 --> 1:00:55.600]  the united states follows the pattern of the chai comms idly france spain and the eu
[1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:59.360]  and what hollywood and the megabanks are pushing for
[1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:09.520]  it ladies and gentlemen we will be locked down for 18 months it's now officially announced
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:18.960]  and even ap even yahoo news even reuters i have the articles right here admit that this is a take
[1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:24.080]  over by the financial institutions of the real economy that they already were waging war with
[1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:31.520]  and that all the small businesses will be shut down and only the big corporations will get the
[1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:39.760]  bailouts from the very same megabanks that own them that's right the big megabanks will get the
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:45.680]  federal reserve money they will get first use of it they're already freezing many new home loans
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:54.320]  they are killing the economy by design and if you remember democrats msnbc cnn hbo host like
[1:01:54.320 --> 1:02:01.520]  bill marr they've all come out and said over and over and over again that they were going
[1:02:01.520 --> 1:02:08.320]  to plunge the economy that it was worth it to stop donald trump and now they're hip hip hooray
[1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:14.720]  yay we may be able to remove trump because we're killing the economy that he helped start
[1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:18.480]  paul cragman of the new york times economist obama's economist said you'll never get it
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:24.160]  above three percent got to the three point eight and now you wonder like i was saying
[1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:28.000]  ten weeks ago when we knew that the impeachment was going to fail weeks before it did what would
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:35.360]  they do next i said bio weapon attack or a new war to create uncertainty in the economy
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:40.960]  and trump's pulling out of afghanistan all the rest of it they are pissed msnbc ho
[1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:47.200]  hopes a global financial crisis hope democrats win in 2020 why that was just two three weeks
[1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:52.320]  ago and now they're getting their wish here's a short compilation just just a sampling of
[1:02:53.040 --> 1:02:59.920]  their revelatory behavior against all of you here it is a woman asked me do you think we're
[1:02:59.920 --> 1:03:03.680]  going to have a recession and i said well i'd never say never but i said i think the economy
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:08.800]  is pretty fundamentally strong and and i don't see one on the horizon and and the people kind of
[1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:13.440]  grimaced when i said that one woman said i want a recession because that'll help get rid of
[1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:18.880]  donald trump and that i think that's most liberals won't admit that but when you see what's happened
[1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:24.960]  with the media coverage of the economy martha over the last 10 to 14 days it's you know the new
[1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:30.320]  outward isn't racism for now it's it's recession i feel like the bottom has to fall out at some
[1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:35.200]  point and by the way i'm hoping for it because i think one way you get rid of trump is a crashing
[1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:41.360]  economy so please bring on the recession but as far as the winning economy that the president needs
[1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:45.760]  from now until november do you really see that changing well i'll give you two examples 2008
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:50.800]  at this time nobody thought we would have a global financial crisis right on our shores
[1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:56.160]  and that's the thing that really sunk john mccain's candidacy then think about 2018 you know what
[1:03:56.160 --> 1:04:02.000]  happened in q4 2018 the stock market fell 20 percent you know what also happened the dems took back
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:06.720]  the house that in that period so if the stock market were to tumble this year if we don't get
[1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:11.120]  near the three percent gdp growth that this administration's been talking about for years
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:15.520]  these are all things that dems can run on and they pose a problem all right josh isn't the fed
[1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:20.400]  cutting rates now just going to make the next economic downturn worse what's your prediction
[1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:25.360]  i've been hoping for a recession people hate me for it but it would get rid of trump so you
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:29.360]  shouldn't hate me for it i mean they said we would see the global economy entering recession
[1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:34.720]  in three quarters perfect timing i say i mean i've been rooting for a recession shon anity says
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:39.040]  i'm able for that and i'm bringing it on shone if you're watching i'm not a genie i can't make it
[1:04:39.040 --> 1:04:44.800]  happen i'm just wishing it if it happens it'll be because of your lord and the savior donald j
[1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:52.640]  trump a recession is a survivable event what trump is doing to this country is not his trade policy
[1:04:52.640 --> 1:05:03.040]  with china first off the talking points are all the same everything is choreographed by the western
[1:05:03.040 --> 1:05:10.240]  media and every authoritarian regime on the planet that lust ever power and control their globalist
[1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:16.480]  system has been challenged humanity has awoken to them and so they use the man made of virus to
[1:05:16.480 --> 1:05:23.520]  create scenes out of a science fiction dystopian novel to scare the population into submission
[1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:31.920]  and then they launch their global corporate strike against the western world and against the average
[1:05:31.920 --> 1:05:39.040]  person and the average saver the average homeowner the average small business owner that's why the
[1:05:39.040 --> 1:05:44.560]  big mega corporations aren't exempt and they all get to stay open the mom and pops all have to
[1:05:44.560 --> 1:05:51.280]  close according to them it's a corporate strike against we the people it's a corporate strike
[1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:56.160]  the wuhan virus and the whole operation is a globalist corporate strike against the nation
[1:05:56.160 --> 1:06:22.800]  state and individuals america was coming back the chai comes and defeated economically the globalists
[1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:27.840]  were being arrested for their pedophile rings hillary clinton's serber have been retrieved
[1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:37.040]  the new york police had it all along the laptop how do you change the subject how do you lock it
[1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:45.520]  down how do you blame the president you launch a man made by a weapon that you know is going to
[1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:49.280]  kill a lot of old people that you already had on the shelf like bill gates said to get rid of
[1:06:49.280 --> 1:06:56.320]  granting save that million dollars per old person to kill and then the whole mechanized propaganda
[1:06:56.320 --> 1:07:02.160]  arm right before the virus is released all these tv shows and movies and productions for hbo and
[1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:06.960]  discovery channel and history that have been made over a year the end of the world all these shows
[1:07:06.960 --> 1:07:17.680]  premiered right on time yes you didn't know that's how they roll and they've got the vaccine ready
[1:07:17.680 --> 1:07:24.000]  but they got to the trials first bill gates owns that and in the tabletop exercise four months ago
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:30.160]  were 65 million died from the coronavirus and obama transferred the virus in 2015 under big
[1:07:30.160 --> 1:07:38.320]  protests to you guessed it the wuhan bio weapons lab they're getting busy they're getting busy
[1:07:38.320 --> 1:07:47.520]  they're getting busy i guess you didn't know now the martial law is going into place
[1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:56.880]  and do they have their land the fear keeps rolling you're not just gonna see that stock market go down
[1:07:58.320 --> 1:08:04.320]  you're going to see more bio weapons released because when you get on your knees to a slave
[1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:11.520]  master all that does is encourage him to kill more of it land of the free
[1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:20.480]  under the brave on its knees how many deaths in the united states how many deaths in the united
[1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:35.600]  states confirmed cases 9,415 let's look at italy 35,000 cases and what are the deaths
[1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:44.800]  2,978 probably higher than that now 475 in one day china's only had 3,000 you believe that
[1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:51.680]  you saw that total hysteria in china over 3,000 total martial law 700 million people locked down
[1:08:51.680 --> 1:08:58.560]  drone screaming orders everybody all of that craziness
[1:09:01.680 --> 1:09:06.000]  the flu kills about 150 people a day if you average it out over a year in the united states alone
[1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:08.560]  how many have died in the united states
[1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:12.480]  is it even 100
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:15.840]  let's look that up
[1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:24.240]  think about that
[1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:32.080]  all right well you guys just put it on screen over there for me when you get a chance thank you
[1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:41.600]  but this is the total attempt at hysteria 154 deaths
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:51.760]  in the united states 68 in washington state the epicenter new york california florida
[1:09:52.320 --> 1:10:00.800]  goes on from there and america on its knees 154 deaths a little over what you get in one
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:05.760]  day from the flu and of course the answer is well the bell curve you know if it goes straight
[1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:11.280]  up it'll overwhelm the hospitals and everything so we want to space it out they're saying oh
[1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:18.800]  you're all still gonna get it that's why we made it but we're gonna space it out over 18 months and
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:23.360]  of course you know once you've lived with having to have your papers you go outside your house and
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:33.040]  drones parking orders at you for 18 months you're never going back never going back never coming back
[1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:42.800]  just like the un said world government needs a bio weapon or a new plague
[1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:51.760]  to get the public to accept surveillance and control and forced inoculation and gun confiscation
[1:10:54.160 --> 1:10:58.080]  so we better start having a discussion about that but i know that's a thing that's happening
[1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:06.560]  the laws of freedoms the whole plan set up and ready for us but this virus itself is a trojan
[1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:12.000]  horse for the political and cultural and economic control that comes with it which they're now
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:18.160]  admitting and trillions to the bankers trillions to the globalist and their business is allowed to
[1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:23.600]  stay open and make record profits but your business can't stay open
[1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:33.120]  you know you saw those big national headlines last week about alex jones selling fake corona virus
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:39.760]  cures never said we had a cure never said we had a treatment so we have abl laboratories that
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:43.520]  produce this stuff for hospitals and over the counter and everything else and as soon as
[1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:50.080]  everybody found out the regulators that walmart sells this under another name
[1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:56.880]  and makes claims that abl has they've certified it all went away didn't it
[1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:05.280]  you didn't see any other articles it all just stopped sunday didn't it thousands of articles
[1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:09.760]  every tv channel everywhere and then went on oh really sold in walmart
[1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:19.680]  because you see walmart and target and all these big mega box stores they're part of
[1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:23.600]  the infrastructure protection operation and they get to operate when no one else does
[1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:30.240]  and that's what's so crazy about all this ladies and gentlemen
[1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:36.800]  is that this is a total raping of the economy a total raping of your future
[1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:41.600]  and it's all being sold
[1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:46.240]  like it's a good thing
[1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:54.400]  like there's a pbs piece where you're the smart guys and the guy talks to you like you're two
[1:12:54.400 --> 1:13:00.000]  years old you're the smart guys i'm gonna explain to you why that this is really dangerous and why
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:05.040]  it's really bad as if you just totally panic and it's the end of the world and you do whatever they
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:12.560]  say or you're denying that viruses are a problem and there's no problem no the truth is it's
[1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:17.280]  engineered it's been released it comes back that's the real threat and they're covering up the fact
[1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:22.480]  it's still ongoing in china but it's being used as a weapon against america and against president
[1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:31.040]  trump there's another article just went up on businessinsider.com it mirrors the article by
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:35.440]  paul watson on info wars.com idly's coronavirus lockdown is so severe that you need a form
[1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:42.880]  to prove you have good enough reason to go outside that's total martial law guys go to
[1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:49.120]  youtube and type in nazi's check jewish papers there's a lot of famous footage of you know a guy
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:52.720]  with a riding crop up against the jewish woman's neck like that and then you're like you know and
[1:13:52.720 --> 1:14:01.360]  they're tracking the papers well that's what's going on now all over the world we're gonna
[1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:04.240]  go to break i'm gonna come back and play part of that pbsp so i'm gonna open the phones up
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:08.080]  they have a special guest in the studio coming up next hour i'm just gonna throw this in there
[1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:16.800]  we are selling out of the super silver with the nano silver it's patented and that's amazing
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:25.920]  and it's the best you're gonna find out there and i mean you know 16 ounces of this for 1995
[1:14:25.920 --> 1:14:31.840]  it's an amazing deal it's about to sell out the one ounces came back in a limited number of these
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:36.080]  it's good to it's the same stuff you can use this as a dispenser spread on your hands for surface
[1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:40.240]  stuff that's really what their big business is for hospitals spraying it because it alcohol
[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:46.720]  off gases but in the army uh system when they got this approved for hospitals back in 90s well the
[1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:54.000]  army approved it in 93 i mean i mean 2003 and 2005 it was for hospitals nationwide um they found
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:58.480]  silver doesn't off gas it just stays there until you wipe it away it just stays on services why
[1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:04.880]  it's the thing you find in hospitals everywhere it's this company and so but but i you can also
[1:15:04.880 --> 1:15:10.960]  ingest it and so we talk about really good hand sanitizer you talk about surface sanitizer
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:16.560]  that's what this company is and you know we told everybody that hydrogen peroxide is really good
[1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:20.320]  in the studies and now trump gave a speech about it i mean i don't even sell hydrogen peroxide you
[1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:24.320]  can't get that anywhere this is just basic stuff like gargling if it's in your throat or whatever
[1:15:24.320 --> 1:15:28.640]  doesn't mean it's a panacea uh and of course we talked about malaria drugs two weeks ago
[1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:32.480]  and studies being good oh shut up don't say that now it's all over the news uh so we'll tell you
[1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:35.600]  about that as well we're not selling the malaria drug we're just telling you about it and you know
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:39.920]  it's good to get vitamin c folks that's what the studies say as well i don't sell vitamin c by itself
[1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:43.520]  because that's so easy to get an orange peel you name it uh but those are just things you need and
[1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:48.560]  sunshine get out in the backyard on a sunny day soon folks because every study shows that'll

[1:21:44.560 --> 1:21:50.320]  okay i'm going to introduce something here to everybody that i searched engines last night
[1:21:50.320 --> 1:21:55.440]  nobody's pointed out so i'm not just quaining something here i'm telling you what's going on
[1:21:56.160 --> 1:22:03.440]  there's no doubt that's what this is what do you call a group or a class of institutions or people
[1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:09.600]  exerting their will with economic power well you call it financial terrorism but one man's
[1:22:09.600 --> 1:22:15.520]  terrorist and other man's patriot the labor unions were pretty much communist but they
[1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:20.480]  were responding to the robber barons and the corruption of those guys and the labor unions
[1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:27.200]  got a lot of rights for people we can roll some of that b-roll footage of the labor unions back in
[1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:34.720]  the past and and some of those some of those uh you know famous events uh that uh that that that
[1:22:34.720 --> 1:22:42.640]  took place but what is it we're looking at now well it's the big mega banks and the most powerful
[1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:50.240]  fortune 500 exerting their will to start a stampede in non-essential areas they were running to have
[1:22:50.240 --> 1:22:55.760]  their executives go home but actually keep all their companies operating to then cancel some
[1:22:55.760 --> 1:23:01.120]  big public events and and you know have have governments declare martial law in areas like
[1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:06.240]  europe and china to then set the precedent to create the hysteria and the fear to have that
[1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:13.200]  done here if trump didn't follow suit monkey see monkey do and the big thing this will create is
[1:23:13.200 --> 1:23:17.920]  unrest in the end they know within a month will be into a depression with this lockdown once it's
[1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:23.520]  in place and they're incrementally putting more in every day trumps been bucking it but trying to
[1:23:23.520 --> 1:23:27.760]  give the rhetoric that he's doing this so that he doesn't get the political blame for the death he
[1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:32.880]  knows is already coming he's following a balancing act that we really advise him to cover he's either
[1:23:32.880 --> 1:23:39.200]  listening to us or he came up with the exact same pragmatic system um because regardless they're
[1:23:39.200 --> 1:23:44.240]  going to hype every event like it's the end of the world in communist china they had a plant
[1:23:44.240 --> 1:23:48.640]  media that stuck with the state and said the government was good here you're going to have
[1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:52.800]  the media saying the president is the worst thing on the earth and that every death is his fault
[1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:56.880]  and they'll show their each person's face and have sad music in the background one person dies
[1:23:56.880 --> 1:24:04.800]  it's a tragedy ten thousand dies it's a statistic a stolen set and so this is the big push and now
[1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:12.320]  they go oh actually remember the first they sold you it's a big high bell curve and so
[1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:18.080]  we need to stop that'll overwhelm the system and i said wait a minute it'll take years for this
[1:24:18.080 --> 1:24:23.280]  virus to run through well now they say 18 months have you put up with that 18 years like us being
[1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:30.560]  in afghanistan this is a takeover and so it all sounds reasonable it all sounds good i just want
[1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:37.360]  you to know the virus is the cover for the takeover the vertical integration the giant multi
[1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:45.760]  trillion uh dollar operation that they are engaged in that's what this is a giant vertical
[1:24:45.760 --> 1:24:54.000]  integration a giant ultramassive extraction and a consolidation by the corporate rulers who are
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  coordinating this between countries worldwide as they said they always would with bill gates
[1:24:58.960 --> 1:25:04.880]  right at the center of it and a bunch of obama appointees running them so this is a corporate
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:14.400]  strike against the people exercising their power over you to shut down the economy to shut down
[1:25:14.400 --> 1:25:20.880]  the infrastructure and to drive you into total hysterical fear and submission and if you pass
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:25.440]  the test and submit properly then you are never going to get out of the handcuffs
[1:25:28.480 --> 1:25:32.480]  this is the new world order this is the technocracy this is robot drones everywhere
[1:25:32.480 --> 1:25:37.520]  barking orders at you now becoming autonomous we're wanting to be police controlling them it'll be
[1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:42.320]  the ruling technocrats with their robot armies surveilling and controlling armed to the teeth
[1:25:42.320 --> 1:25:47.840]  with lethal and non-lethal weapons to dominate you this is the complete rollout with digital
[1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:55.520]  tattoos out of the skin microchips total tracking absolute domination absolute total control
[1:25:56.080 --> 1:26:01.360]  because after all we can't allow any deaths we have to get rid of the swimming pools that are
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:06.720]  more than three feet deep we have to get rid of diving boards we have to get rid of dodgeball
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:10.960]  and chase at the school someone might hit their knee and now they're not even allowed to talk at
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:15.360]  many recesses or shake hands we're all being trained to be these jellyfish and stay in our
[1:26:15.360 --> 1:26:20.560]  homes and watch the tv screens and the robots will tend the fields and the robots will bring us the
[1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:26.800]  food and the robots will enforce it like thx 1138 the actual globalist plan where you're forced
[1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:33.440]  drugged and everything else until you're just made obsolete and phased out so you wanted to know how
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:37.520]  it would look it's exactly how i predicted for meeting their own writings following the exact
[1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:42.000]  script exact time as you've all heard me five thousand times tell you animated film in-game
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:46.560]  blueprint for global settlement so there you go and i want all of you thinking you're working
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:49.280]  with the system to think you're getting out of this you're not you'll all be destroyed as well
[1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:53.680]  let's go to a few minutes of this pbs piece where they sound so reasonable laying out why this is
[1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:57.520]  going to happen but no discussion of where it came from no discussion of the depression it's
[1:26:57.520 --> 1:27:03.840]  going to cause uh by shutting everything down here it is on day one no one you know is sick it feels
[1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:11.200]  like a normal day it may stay like this for a long time until one day a few people you know are sick
[1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:17.040]  and suddenly a few days later it will seem like everyone is sick and it will feel like it happened
[1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:24.800]  instantly everything looks fine until it isn't fine this is the paradox of pandemics and it's
[1:27:24.800 --> 1:27:31.680]  why with an outbreak like covid 19 you hear health officials calling for huge drastic and rapid responses
[1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:36.400]  in the early days when infection numbers are still relatively small some people worry that these
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:43.520]  actions are over reactions sports teams playing to empty stadiums or not playing at all cancelling
[1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:49.760]  huge gatherings and festivals temporarily closing schools and offices telling people to avoid personal
[1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:56.800]  contact media sensationalism but this way of thinking fails to appreciate how disease outbreaks
[1:27:56.800 --> 1:28:03.280]  work it was really never fine to begin with but we don't notice until it's too late
[1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:14.400]  hey smart people joe here how bad will the coronavirus outbreak yet that's what we all
[1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:20.800]  want to know and the answer is in one of these curves this is what a rapid global pandemic
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:26.160]  looks like little to nothing to slow the number of new infections means a lot of people sick
[1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:32.080]  in a short amount of time a slower global pandemic looks like this the rate of new cases is lowered
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:36.880]  and they're spread out over a longer period of time and which one of these paths that we
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:42.160]  end up on is important because of this line it represents the capacity of our healthcare system
[1:28:42.160 --> 1:28:47.520]  the number of beds doctors respirators and everything else what experts fear is a sudden
[1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:52.800]  explosion like this overwhelming this capacity and what's really interesting here is that even if
[1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:56.960]  these two curves represent the same total number of people that eventually get infected
[1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:25.840]  that's black rifle real estate.com

[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:48.240]  in interviews we pull them up about how they want to depopulate the planet with a bio weapon
[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:56.400]  well now prince albert of monaco we guys reprint this for me it printed blank thank you

[1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:08.960]  kelly's son you know back a few weeks ago when they said tom hanks had it on that weekend i went
[1:34:08.960 --> 1:34:14.160]  live on sunday and i said i think this is either made up or it's pr to overshadow trump's emergency
[1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:20.800]  announcement turned out it was fake news that abc news ran kings of fake news and i think this is
[1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:29.840]  fake too this is all meant to make the establishment look like us so i don't believe a damn word comes
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:33.920]  out of their mouth it's all part of the hypen whether it's norway or whether it's sweden or
[1:34:33.920 --> 1:34:38.080]  whether it's france or whether it's spain or whether it's italy french face finds if they
[1:34:38.080 --> 1:34:45.520]  leave home amid coronavirus lockdown as europe prepares to close external borders so when you
[1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:52.560]  go see v for vendetta and the young news girl is getting home five minutes after dark and the
[1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:59.760]  thugs come around her she said i'm sorry i got stuck on the train they said you're gonna have to
[1:34:59.760 --> 1:35:07.760]  pay for this with your body and then v of course takes them out but you want to live like that like
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:14.160]  puny montana says in scarface you want to spy on every corner watching what you do telling you
[1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:19.760]  what to eat how to sleep where you can live where you can go you want squid you want squid coming
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:29.200]  out your ass i eat squid three times a day by the way you go to cuba today and the most beautiful
[1:35:29.200 --> 1:35:35.120]  women you can imagine will have sex with you for a two dollar little tube of worm that you can bring
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:40.640]  into the country because the government can't and won't procure dewormer and people get worms
[1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:45.360]  from childhood and they have worms their whole life because the open the communists they have the
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:51.360]  most doctors of any country and when you get cataracts you get a cane and when your knee goes out you
[1:35:51.360 --> 1:36:04.720]  get a cane and you don't get dewormer so all the lefties that want bernie sanders lines are good
[1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:12.560]  empty shelves are good there are too many types of deodorant but you know he's getting it something
[1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:20.160]  there he wants it for control over you but people really are decadent people aren't focused people
[1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:24.160]  don't have attention spans it's been done by design but but our own weakness to let it happen
[1:36:25.440 --> 1:36:31.440]  going with the flow instead of resisting it and so now we're in a soft pliable dumb down mass
[1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:38.720]  and you know what happens to soft pliable dumb down masses they get enslaved and if humans are
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:46.240]  worthless and consume stuff they get killed see america was about rugged individuals who stood
[1:36:46.240 --> 1:36:50.560]  for what you could produce and what you did like martin Luther king later pointed out
[1:36:50.560 --> 1:36:58.160]  not who you were because you were a prince or or some lord or some duke in the colonies you
[1:36:58.160 --> 1:37:04.720]  couldn't do basic business unless up the chain there was a duke or a lord or some viceroy some
[1:37:04.720 --> 1:37:12.960]  some some some some courtier of the crown that had licenses licensure for you to operate
[1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:18.720]  and for all of you that want to live like that they've trained the bureaucrats and the college
[1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:23.840]  students that that's the world that's coming and there's not going to be jobs for humans
[1:37:23.840 --> 1:37:28.240]  it's going to be robots that run it all and you're going to have to do what you're told and
[1:37:28.240 --> 1:37:31.920]  take the vaccines you're told and not have children and jump through all these hoops
[1:37:32.960 --> 1:37:37.760]  so you can be given your credits because they don't need people anymore they've got the minds
[1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:40.640]  and the robots and all the stuff they're phasing in the ai takeover
[1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:48.400]  and so humans have to start saying hey there needs to be a symbol on food a symbol on clothes made
[1:37:48.400 --> 1:37:54.320]  by humans and we need to have unions of pro-human futures and communities that are pro-human and
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:58.000]  we have to come together against the big corporations and all the little robot minders
[1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:03.040]  remember in doctor who they had the little dollocks that would roll around and say exterminate
[1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:07.520]  exterminate now they actually have robots in the u.s and japan and china that look like a dolloc
[1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:13.360]  that roll around and give you orders and now they're arming them of course i tell you this
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:19.120]  20 30 years ago your conspiracy theorist and driverless trucks and the post-human world
[1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:25.520]  because you can't leave your house and of course the next thing will be go underground
[1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:32.000]  so the virus can't get you and that's the whole idea of thx 1138 that george
[1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:37.040]  lucas made his first film about with robert deval
[1:38:37.040 --> 1:38:45.280]  all of other amazing actors was a composite of brave new world and then what the scientists
[1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:49.600]  knows we're talking about the time what they wanted to build and a scientific elite takes
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:56.800]  humanity underground to protect them from a bio threat and generations later we're ruled over by
[1:38:56.800 --> 1:39:04.640]  robots and a technotronic elite technocrats that's the plan it's always been the plan
[1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:10.240]  and since 1856 when sir francis gallton
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:18.320]  had a hallucination this is in history books so did darwin his cousin charles darwin
[1:39:19.440 --> 1:39:22.800]  they were part of a secret government breeding program this has been declassified
[1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:30.080]  between the wedgewoods the huxleys the darwins and several other families the blairs were involved
[1:39:30.080 --> 1:39:34.640]  a little bit that's towards our well later and they were breeding the smartest people together in
[1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:40.000]  eugenics experiment but most of them became mentally ill or crazy but then they started
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:47.600]  having hallucinations and they were told by aliens how to build all this this is in mainland
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:52.480]  history books and they envisioned computers and robots and the double helix and biometrics and
[1:39:52.480 --> 1:39:56.240]  everything they were supposed to build and then they set about with the scientific royal academy
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:40:03.440]  to to to to build this and then eisenhower 100 years later 105 years later 106 years later
[1:40:04.320 --> 1:40:10.080]  he comes out and warns you about this technotronic scientific elite controlling the military
[1:40:10.080 --> 1:40:15.280]  industrial complex was going to do all this you see and then it all makes perfect sense doesn't it
[1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:23.040]  demons literally inspired these people who the royal family had do a breeding program
[1:40:23.040 --> 1:40:28.160]  them with all this weird esoteric knowledge from egypt they know about to be able to then
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:35.680]  engineer a brains like a frank herbert idea like a guild navigator to be able to then interface
[1:40:35.680 --> 1:40:42.560]  with these people these little well their average operative looks like a little elf but if you
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:47.840]  take the hat off it's got horns i'm not kidding folks the cia takes drugs they interface with it
[1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:51.760]  i told you all that stuff i told you a rogue in that last year and then two months later he had
[1:40:51.760 --> 1:40:57.200]  a top scientist on going well we actually now are doing dmt studies with dmt drip it's like astronauts
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:01.440]  we go in other dimensions and we map it we're communicating with the creatures now joe already
[1:41:01.440 --> 1:41:05.120]  knew all that you know joe's a good guy but those those folks kind of recruited him in
[1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:09.120]  you know it's all interesting it's really professors it's not the cia you know the green
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:13.360]  berets and all that just go around killing people the globalists want dead um this is totally
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:17.760]  different than that and see i have to tell you this now so you know why i know all this okay
[1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:24.960]  okay because when i was a kid i i ran into a lot of interesting people i didn't know what i was
[1:41:24.960 --> 1:41:31.360]  seeing at the time who just talked about all this and these were university folks and people
[1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:35.760]  running major operations and you know you're sitting there listening about machine ls when
[1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:40.400]  you're six seven years old at the dinner table and how the government's got a project talking to
[1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:43.520]  the aliens and you know and it wasn't my parents at all they just had you know some friends over
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:51.680]  talking about uh running a secret project in san francisco so that's what this is and they the aliens
[1:41:51.680 --> 1:41:56.160]  are working with the globalists to kill everybody and they're going to kill you real slow so you
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:41:59.520]  never really wake up to it know what's hitting you so just like i told you about the bio attack
[1:41:59.520 --> 1:42:04.000]  that they'd have robots controlling us 20 years ago you know during the lockdown well now i'm
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:08.240]  telling you the rest of story and the bible tells you all right there about the fallen one of the
[1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:14.000]  earth and the whole plan and and how he would seduce us and have a mark to buy or sell under
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:20.400]  the skin the tattoo that now bill gates is rolling out an ibm ran hitler and ran the
[1:42:20.400 --> 1:42:26.800]  nazis and just it's it's all there so you just need to understand that they were given inspiration
[1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:31.920]  by the dark side to build this they didn't just come up with what do you think that the obelisk is
[1:42:31.920 --> 1:42:41.200]  in what do you think the obelisk is in 2001 space odyssey the obelisk tv screen movies through
[1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:47.680]  screen obelisk and then it sucks you into the other dimension and then soon you take a chip
[1:42:47.680 --> 1:42:52.000]  so you can just interface right away with it it listens to you it watches you this is all
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:56.800]  demonic alien tech it's been done before we're being farmed stay with us we'll be right back
[1:42:56.800 --> 1:43:04.320]  listen to me very very carefully i am involved at very high levels with supply chain management
[1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:10.560]  and talk to a lot of executives and they are confirming to me that the supply chain is starting

[1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:22.080]  alex jones show america's economy is being targeted china was the incubation point for the
[1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:28.160]  manmade virus that does kill at an alarming rate old and infirm but it's only the cover for the
[1:47:28.160 --> 1:47:33.360]  lockdown that brings down the economy i'm not debating those that say oh you can say it's legitimate
[1:47:33.360 --> 1:47:40.240]  to have quarantine that's just the cover though separately for the takeover and our new robot
[1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:45.120]  minders and controllers they always promised us would never control us but the dream is to get rid
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:49.840]  of human soldiers in place and have it all be robots because they will follow the orders it's
[1:47:49.840 --> 1:47:55.840]  very very simple equation we are entering the end of the human age if the globalists have their way
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:48:01.680]  this is not a drill it's not a joke i'm telling you what they believe and they may be wrong that
[1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:05.440]  they may not be working with off-world stuff and interdimensional things the globalists are none
[1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:10.640]  of them are atheists they are all super into the occult taking hardcore drugs they believe to
[1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:15.520]  interdimensionally interface with these creatures and now that's mainline thought you see all these
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:21.440]  billionaires on the news saying that and oh take ayahuasca you know meet meet the the watchers and all
[1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:29.840]  this no dude don't take the ayahuasca i would not take the dmt believe me um because if you're not
[1:48:29.840 --> 1:48:35.920]  deceived and they can rope you in they're gonna try to absolutely go watch buckaroo bonsai when
[1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:39.120]  the guy goes in the other dimension for a second and then they get him for a minute and he comes back
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:44.240]  crazy that's that let me tell you they don't just put that in hollywood movies because they just they
[1:48:44.240 --> 1:48:52.400]  just thought this up okay okay they didn't just think that up so that guys try to pull up buckaroo
[1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:56.400]  bonsai online even if it's on netflix the part where it explains what happens to the mad scientist
[1:48:56.960 --> 1:49:00.480]  where he runs himself into a wall and his head goes another dimension it's really like a hundred
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:04.960]  years they torture living hell out of him you want to know what a dmt trip's like that's what it's
[1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:10.240]  like and let me tell you it is a trip you're going somewhere so don't take it nobody says it's cool
[1:49:10.240 --> 1:49:14.960]  and it's wonderful no no all right i'm gonna stop ranting i'm gonna go to your phone calls
[1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:22.240]  but that's where this all goes it's spiritual it's real the devil's real okay and and the globalist
[1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:26.080]  want to tell you that if there's no god there's no nothing so you're defenseless and you don't know
[1:49:26.080 --> 1:49:31.360]  that there's a god infinitely more powerful than the devil but you've got free will you can tune
[1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:36.480]  into god and the holy ghost anytime you want unless you've sacrificed children or done really
[1:49:36.480 --> 1:49:42.000]  evil stuff and rejected god you've had the holy spirit come to you the hardcore spotlight transmission
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:49.040]  it's always there but coming down on you like sunday morning on a sunday morning sidewalk
[1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:51.840]  that old uh johnny cash song
[1:49:55.120 --> 1:50:01.360]  and you reject that and then you go and you commit a bunch of crimes well you're gonna have a big
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:07.600]  problem and then you're gonna get caught off completely and once that happens ladies and
[1:50:07.600 --> 1:50:14.400]  gentlemen once that goes on now you're gonna be a slave of the devil and it's not going to be fun
[1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:19.120]  here's the cheesy cheesy trailer for the movie but there's the part where the mad scientist goes
[1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:23.200]  another dimension for a second and then he's always trying to open the gate back up that's
[1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:31.280]  that's what this is okay okay uh let's go ahead and uh take a call here let's go to

[1:53:38.480 --> 1:53:41.920]  that's right your governor's not ordered all the beaches closed but a lot of them been closed
[1:53:41.920 --> 1:53:47.040]  they have left us control them but but your governor has said that uh that it's good he's not
[1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:50.560]  going to kill the economy for this virus and again when there's a few thousand deaths or whatever
[1:53:50.560 --> 1:53:55.440]  they're going to say he's the biggest devil you know since since whatever yep and so what i'm
[1:53:55.440 --> 1:54:01.680]  hearing from um friends that i still have in college and other friends who have kids in school
[1:54:02.240 --> 1:54:09.920]  they're already getting the emails that the system's already in place um they call it
[1:54:09.920 --> 1:54:16.400]  remote instruction not they call them instructions now not learning um but the system's already in
[1:54:16.400 --> 1:54:24.560]  place to finish out the school year um remotely and i really feel like this might be the big
[1:54:24.560 --> 1:54:30.560]  ai takeover when you have all the remote workers already home you have the universal basic income
[1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:39.360]  for the people who can't work and you know maybe you know this is the big this is the big rollout
[1:54:39.360 --> 1:54:45.120]  globally we have the infrastructure and we have the technology now get everybody to stay home
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:52.640]  and have the ai gods um take their place well that is the admitted plan they say this is going
[1:54:52.640 --> 1:54:56.480]  to teach us to work at home and cut our carbon footprint and drones are going to watch us because
[1:54:56.480 --> 1:55:01.760]  drones won't supposedly carry the disease but you know that in the future that's exactly how the
[1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:05.760]  globals will take out populations as they'll send out drones no humans will know that they're going
[1:55:05.760 --> 1:55:10.160]  to release a bio weapon on the public and then that's how you deliver the system there was a
[1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:16.960]  sunshine project report that got declassified in 99 the marine corps asked for it to be reclassified
[1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:23.360]  2002 and it was and the plan was secret military bases and in a joint task force of of the army
[1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:30.720]  and marines with with warehouses that pop open with drone helicopters that would take off and
[1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:37.280]  then spray opiate synthetic basic fentanyl on the public during mass riots but they found about 10
[1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:41.920]  percent would die because of car wrecks and fires but that's actually a government program
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:48.720]  uh with helicopter depots all over the country uh with uh basically a chemical weapon uh fentanyl
[1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:54.000]  loaded up in them uh doesn't that sound loving so i wonder what else is going on right now that we
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:56:02.960]  don't know about um it's not just going to be drones it's the whole ai system we have the remote
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:07.440]  workers who are able to work already home we have the infrastructure for everybody to take
[1:56:07.440 --> 1:56:11.920]  construction and school and all we're doing is training the ai they admit that so we're still
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:16.160]  needed to train the ai when it messes up hold the baby's hand the baby that's going to kill us
[1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:22.320]  yep and what is the end game so that's why i started off with that what is the end game
[1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:28.480]  dot com everybody needs to see what the plan is and that it's not the future it's now you know that
[1:56:28.480 --> 1:56:32.400]  site hadn't been up that in probably 10 years we need to get into i don't even know how it's still

[1:57:51.600 --> 1:57:58.080]  the united states thank god corona viruses here thank god it's going to kill the old people
[1:57:58.080 --> 1:58:04.880]  thank the heavens that we're going to depopulate the planet because humanity is horrible humanity
[1:58:04.880 --> 1:58:11.840]  is evil all the hollywood movies all the propaganda all the un statements all the
[1:58:11.840 --> 1:58:17.440]  ted turner and prince philip garbage saying that they want to use a deadly virus to depopulate
[1:58:17.440 --> 1:58:23.200]  and control the population and now it's here and they want to lock down society and are licking
[1:58:23.200 --> 1:58:29.840]  their lips and saying trump isn't doing enough what a sickening in your face declaration of war
[1:58:30.400 --> 1:58:35.520]  against humanity by these control freaks who think it's their right to put fluoride in the water
[1:58:35.520 --> 1:58:42.000]  give us toxic vaccines openly dumb us down and then when we resist call us terrorists and conspiracy
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:48.160]  theorists when they're publicly admitting their plan to exterminate everyone it's time to expose the scum
[1:58:48.400 --> 1:58:55.040]  there could no longer be any doubt the globalists have orchestrated this entire crisis but it's
[1:58:55.040 --> 1:59:02.960]  not a hoax the virus is real and the panic it's creating is on a scale never before seen it is
[1:59:02.960 --> 1:59:09.200]  said in the bible that the wicked flee when none pursue but the wicked really run for their lives
[1:59:09.200 --> 1:59:18.000]  when something real is killing people silently and quietly ladies and gentlemen it's time to pray
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:25.200]  it's time to seek god's face it's time to repent for the 64 million abortions in america and the
[1:59:25.200 --> 1:59:31.440]  400 million abortions in communist china and for all of the satanism and all of the pedophilia
[1:59:31.440 --> 1:59:37.920]  and all of the corruption or god is going to continue to allow the globalist to judge us for
[1:59:37.920 --> 1:59:44.480]  him that's right god is lifting the hedge of protection away from the people and allowing satan
[1:59:44.480 --> 1:59:53.920]  and his armies to have their will with the people you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:59:53.920 --> 2:00:05.120]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones

[2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:48.160]  us to our knees and have a great depression here in the u.s china only shut down for a few weeks
[2:02:48.160 --> 2:02:52.880]  they've now turned back on but we're supposed to do it 18 months so china doesn't do it but for two
[2:02:52.880 --> 2:02:57.360]  or three weeks we do it for 18 months and a couple months will be in a depression this is an economic
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:02.560]  warfare weapon god bless you lin powerful points i don't want to cut the next caller off so i'm
[2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:06.160]  going to talk for a few minutes to go to break for one minute come back with the next long segment
[2:03:06.160 --> 2:03:13.440]  but we've got a caller up here that ties into what she just said josh in illinois drones in colorada
[2:03:14.240 --> 2:03:20.880]  area before outbreak test kits bogus i said with that weird drones flying in grids all over central
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:26.880]  texas at the same time um they had large drones we're talking four or five feet across the four
[2:03:26.880 --> 2:03:34.560]  to six propellers and i said are they testing 5g are they testing delivery or are they spraying
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:38.800]  something because it's been declassified that there have been a lot of programs that use helicopters
[2:03:38.800 --> 2:03:44.480]  and things in the past to secretly test airborne vaccines you know there's all sorts of secret tests
[2:03:44.480 --> 2:03:49.440]  where they spray different pesticides or things for different bugs that are out there so there's
[2:03:49.440 --> 2:03:53.280]  all sorts of weird scientific stuff going on we know that i mean everybody knows about the ski
[2:03:53.280 --> 2:03:58.560]  experiment all the other atomic soldier experiments it's only gotten worse since then and again
[2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:04.160]  it's need to know basis compartmentalized scientific groups above the government that are
[2:04:04.160 --> 2:04:09.600]  breakaway civilization groups that are running all this and once they get us locked down and we
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:15.280]  behave during a pandemic that only encourages the globalist to release bio weapons into the future
[2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:21.280]  that'll even be stronger to corral and control it so i'm going to get to a bunch of your calls
[2:04:21.280 --> 2:04:26.320]  when we come back and then tim reams and the powerful report he and romp do have gone out and
[2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:32.880]  filed on the texas border they just got back yesterday and you can see these reports filed
[2:04:32.880 --> 2:04:39.520]  the last few days giant hole the brownsville border toilet paper smuggling they caught brownsville
[2:04:39.520 --> 2:04:46.240]  coming under shut down rio grand river crossing laredo border closure they've got all this stuff
[2:04:46.240 --> 2:04:51.440]  on tape we'll be right back please tell folks about bandot video and about the band broadcast
[2:04:56.080 --> 2:05:02.240]  ladies and gentlemen alex jones here with a public service announcement info wars as of today
[2:05:02.240 --> 2:05:08.640]  is now suspending storable food sales we still have storable food we're able to package all the
[2:05:08.640 --> 2:05:12.960]  storable food and get it to everybody that ordered it most of you've already gotten your food but
[2:05:12.960 --> 2:05:18.080]  the reason i'm making this announcement is all the other major food suppliers were sold out
[2:05:18.080 --> 2:05:23.360]  over a month ago as we first reported to you but they lied to you and they took your money
[2:05:23.360 --> 2:05:29.200]  well we know for the fact they're still taking everybody's money even though the food has all
[2:05:29.200 --> 2:05:35.360]  been sold out the basic ingredients for storable food is gone all the big box stores are paying
[2:05:35.360 --> 2:05:40.320]  way over normal prices to buy up what's left and so anybody telling you that they have
[2:05:40.320 --> 2:05:45.920]  storable food is lying to you the good news is everyone that ordered an info wars store
[2:05:45.920 --> 2:05:50.080]  dot com has already gotten it or if you ordered recently we have the food is being packaged
[2:05:50.080 --> 2:05:55.680]  and you will get it but as of now we are suspending all new food sales at info wars store dot com
[2:05:55.680 --> 2:06:07.520]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say i don't know what's
[2:06:07.520 --> 2:06:12.240]  going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one
[2:06:14.480 --> 2:06:19.600]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:06:19.600 --> 2:06:28.160]  you are witnessing 21st century psychological warfare with a real deadly virus at the heart
[2:06:28.160 --> 2:06:32.880]  of it to create the maximum hysteria and you're seeing the ai integration making us work from
[2:06:32.880 --> 2:06:39.520]  home with robot drones surveilling us and controlling us it's all a systematic plan
[2:06:39.520 --> 2:06:44.160]  a bunch of movies and tv shows coming out about pandemics right on time the tabletop exercise
[2:06:44.160 --> 2:06:51.600]  bill mullin gates running the whole show and the pliant chi coms incubating the virus hitting us
[2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:56.240]  they were only shut down maybe three four weeks now they're telling us 12 to 18 months for the
[2:06:56.240 --> 2:07:02.240]  us to be shut down we will be devastated and lose the economic war but we can't let one person die
[2:07:02.240 --> 2:07:08.480]  it's all over it's invisible enemy here come the doleks from dr who to control your life
[2:07:08.480 --> 2:07:15.120]  if it's here 2020 the dystopic nightmare unless humanity awakens now you know why there was all
[2:07:15.120 --> 2:07:20.480]  the censorship before and all the rest of this america is under attack i want to go to your
[2:07:20.480 --> 2:07:24.240]  phone calls right now and i'm going to play that clip when we come back with our next guest
[2:07:24.240 --> 2:07:29.680]  where trump just puts it out there that our military didn't do this the chi comms are behind it
[2:07:29.680 --> 2:07:35.280]  and that's a fact this is a bio weapon attack and now the whole media is aimed against our president
[2:07:35.280 --> 2:07:39.200]  during this crisis and against the american people you stay in your homes but all the big
[2:07:39.200 --> 2:07:45.840]  corporations they can stay open now i want to go to josh in illinois remember about three months ago
[2:07:46.720 --> 2:07:53.600]  texas colorada people caught it on tape big drones and grids flying over what were they doing
[2:07:53.600 --> 2:07:59.920]  and while josh talks will roll some b-roll of china then idly then spain the same thing drones
[2:07:59.920 --> 2:08:06.880]  shouting orders at everyone josh what do you think's going on i remember seeing that on your
[2:08:06.880 --> 2:08:13.200]  website and i kind of looked into it and then i noticed you know they were getting spotted
[2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:20.400]  out west and then the sheriffs knew anything the f a a didn't know anything about it but
[2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:26.320]  what the f a a did come out and clearly say is that you better not shoot at one because you know
[2:08:26.320 --> 2:08:34.720]  that's a felony so you know the f a a you know the government knew what was going on but
[2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:43.200]  local law was just you know oblivious to it and i think that ties into a lot with what's going on
[2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:52.960]  right now and another point i think this whole spread has of corona has really blossomed since
[2:08:52.960 --> 2:08:59.120]  the test kits have been put out and i think some of the test kits might actually have
[2:09:00.480 --> 2:09:09.760]  you know some sort of virus in there or something you know toxic deadly that i i think that might
[2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:18.320]  be why you know a lot of people are getting hit harder than others and the virus another point
[2:09:18.320 --> 2:09:27.040]  that could be nano tech i mean everything's winding up right now and those are just those
[2:09:27.040 --> 2:09:32.320]  are just a few theories and notice like any war it all lines up it all gets beta tested all gets
[2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:36.880]  ready and then boom it hits you worldwide at once that's why merkel says this is bigger than
[2:09:36.880 --> 2:09:42.800]  world war two it is this is the ai axis the chai comms the global is the big banks hollywood
[2:09:42.800 --> 2:09:47.040]  they admit the big banks are going to take the whole economy over this is a total takeover
[2:09:47.040 --> 2:09:53.760]  where you're dependent now live in your house on government checks unbelievable josh seven
[2:09:53.760 --> 2:09:58.240]  ways to sunday to get back at trump the deep state will do whatever they're going to do
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:08.080]  and you know that comment he'll reap the world when well the economy is done so you know maybe
[2:10:08.080 --> 2:10:14.480]  trump maybe trumps wrong in this whole thing and it was a deep state release something and that's
[2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:20.800]  just another thing if they can't go to war with russia maybe they'll go to war with china now or
[2:10:20.800 --> 2:10:26.880]  that doesn't work they'll say israel did it and china and russia go to war with israel so they're
[2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:32.320]  also having up india and pakistan going to war i mean i'm telling you 2020 it's all coming together
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:40.880]  like like 1914 1940 you're here ladies and gentlemen this is it this is modern war and the robots are
[2:10:40.880 --> 2:10:46.080]  rolling out but this is only a beta test of the global has taken full control of the population
[2:10:46.080 --> 2:10:51.520]  and locking us down with their robot armies thank you josh great points we're a radio listener it's
[2:10:51.520 --> 2:10:55.440]  it's important what you're hearing but if you're a tv viewer i mean the b-roll they're playing of
[2:10:55.440 --> 2:11:00.400]  just robots controlling everybody just suddenly everywhere and and and and and and now the u.s
[2:11:00.400 --> 2:11:04.720]  government says we're going to track you by your cell phone to make sure and now you can't leave
[2:11:04.720 --> 2:11:10.160]  your house but the the armored drones are going to bring you food so and if you don't behave yourself
[2:11:10.160 --> 2:11:15.120]  well the heavier robots are going to roll in with the 50 caliber machine guns and so just hope
[2:11:15.120 --> 2:11:20.080]  everybody enjoys themselves because the globalists told you there's too many people and so now here
[2:11:20.080 --> 2:11:24.880]  they come stay in your home till you die or the robots will kill you and the troops are all going
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:28.800]  to be made obsolete now of course they'll all be dying from bio weapons this is all just a beta
[2:11:28.800 --> 2:11:37.840]  test the post-human future is here the humans are being removed from the equation but it's okay
[2:11:37.840 --> 2:11:40.160]  so the con valley loves you
[2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:46.560]  oh they're releasing prisoners everywhere but if you go congregate for your free speech or
[2:11:46.560 --> 2:11:53.120]  the second amendment you get arrested let's go ahead and take another call here let's talk
[2:11:53.120 --> 2:12:00.080]  to john and virginia you're on the air john hey alex thanks for having me on thank you
[2:12:00.960 --> 2:12:07.120]  hey um so i think i recall um going to the first amendment summit uh last month i was a guy in the
[2:12:07.120 --> 2:12:13.840]  76ers and i think i sat a row behind you and then i i was also interviewed by uh oh and shroyer at
[2:12:13.840 --> 2:12:20.160]  the women's march cool brother good to talk to you and what's going on yeah so i know i don't think
[2:12:20.160 --> 2:12:26.240]  you've touched on this a lot but i think you've had in uh in previous shows but um so i know well
[2:12:26.240 --> 2:12:32.880]  i'm sure everyone knows that there's an election coming up in november and of course um we're hearing
[2:12:32.880 --> 2:12:39.760]  on the news like people in like small businesses and in the retail well excuse me in the like the
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:46.000]  restaurant business are like being affected so like if you're president trump and knowing that
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:51.680]  joe biden is probably going to pitch to those voters as like a moderate candidate if you're
[2:12:51.680 --> 2:12:56.400]  president trump how would you exactly pitch to those voters who are probably going to be
[2:12:56.400 --> 2:13:00.880]  affected by a potential recession well that's why trump said checkmate that we have an independent
[2:13:00.880 --> 2:13:05.840]  uh corporate system and do whatever it wants but the public is all controlled by that and so the
[2:13:05.840 --> 2:13:09.920]  corporation's cut everybody off then the government's basically forced to come in and give them money
[2:13:09.920 --> 2:13:14.000]  to live as the real economy is being destroyed right in front of them we're being domesticated
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:18.800]  but then what does trump do does he let everybody go bankrupt and then and then crime explodes and
[2:13:18.800 --> 2:13:23.360]  then there's riding in the streets so this is all part of an ai takeover the corporation
[2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:32.960]  striking against humanity cutting off services uh to bring the president under their control
[2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:38.720]  and then once we capitulate it's a very long road to ever fight out of this this is a concerted
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:43.520]  coordinated plan with a real bio weapon at the center of it that is killing people but that
[2:13:43.520 --> 2:13:47.280]  they're guaranteed to have a cure for and that they're hyping up i mean there's this malaria drug
[2:13:47.280 --> 2:13:50.880]  pretty much knocks it out almost every time but notice there's barely any coverage of that
[2:13:50.880 --> 2:13:56.000]  they want you to be totally and completely scared looking at italy where chinese workers
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:00.880]  that work in their factories uh brought the virus in they go back and forth between china
[2:14:00.880 --> 2:14:05.040]  it's only a couple thousand miles away and then they spread it in the hospitals with the old people
[2:14:05.040 --> 2:14:12.000]  and that's almost all of who's died the average age is now 85 it was 82 a few days ago so this is
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:15.360]  what bill gates said we need something to kill old people well here it is but then while everybody
[2:14:15.360 --> 2:14:19.760]  else scurries around freaking out it kills our economy and then we lose the trade war because
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:23.200]  again china maybe was locked down a month now they say back to business everything's fine
[2:14:23.920 --> 2:14:29.360]  but we're going to be locked down now we learned 18 months so you can see it right there it's a
[2:14:29.360 --> 2:14:34.560]  total economic takeover with us corporations that are really globalist allied with china
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:39.200]  using this to shut us down and then trump says it's bull they'll show the thousands that die
[2:14:39.200 --> 2:14:44.480]  every you know week or so and hype it up that it's his fault so again it's the weakness of the
[2:14:44.480 --> 2:14:50.720]  average american the cowardice the the loving to get into a pity party the wanting to be a victim
[2:14:50.720 --> 2:14:54.960]  the wanting to get a welfare check that wanting to win the lottery it's not all americans but
[2:14:54.960 --> 2:15:02.080]  it's the overall weakness or the average person that has green lit this situation uh and now it
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:05.920]  is just going to get totally hellish but there's going to be a whole new economy and running to
[2:15:05.920 --> 2:15:10.880]  the countryside people banding together politically saying we want a pro human future banning 5g in
[2:15:10.880 --> 2:15:16.880]  your towns banning drones uh not because technology is bad but because all this is built by the
[2:15:16.880 --> 2:15:21.280]  globalist and his trojan horses there's nothing wrong with a big beautiful you know hundred
[2:15:21.280 --> 2:15:26.720]  foot tall golden horse with you know stuff all over it except there's a bunch of enemy soldiers
[2:15:26.720 --> 2:15:31.120]  inside of its belly nothing wrong with the cell phones if attraction controls your life and so
[2:15:31.120 --> 2:15:36.480]  all of this has been given to us as a as a globalist takeover in their own words thank you so much
[2:15:36.480 --> 2:15:42.000]  john all right we'll get to these other colors as well and we've got uh poll lots of coming up

[2:18:01.200 --> 2:18:07.600]  but sometimes populist movements have used the strike you can have labor strikes you can have
[2:18:07.600 --> 2:18:13.440]  people that also boycott and refuse to use a company or a service and many times when the
[2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:19.600]  people actually get together and move and master the strike it has a great effect and some good
[2:18:19.600 --> 2:18:28.240]  things have come out of it but now we are seeing a globalist corporate strike by shutting down
[2:18:28.880 --> 2:18:35.760]  key institutions at key times led by big tech over a month ago to then set the precedent
[2:18:35.760 --> 2:18:41.760]  to shut down small companies and businesses across the world but notice the big globalist
[2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:49.520]  corporations and the big box stores they are all exempt this is more than just martial law training
[2:18:49.520 --> 2:18:54.080]  this is the globalist trying to create a worldwide depression they can blame on trump and they even

[2:21:15.120 --> 2:21:19.120]  good i think it's good well thanks for coming in i want to play some of these clips next segment
[2:21:19.840 --> 2:21:24.400]  the crazy stuff you know you and a dude at a you know out of the park job following like six or
[2:21:24.400 --> 2:21:28.960]  seven great reports down at the border in the last week that have been on info wars but just your
[2:21:28.960 --> 2:21:32.160]  take on what you've heard the last 30 minutes in there while you're waiting to come in you
[2:21:32.160 --> 2:21:36.960]  wanted to talk about ai you wanted to talk about uh the virus just in general what you think's going
[2:21:36.960 --> 2:21:42.800]  on sure this is uh well first and foremost you know i spent a lot of time overseas fighting
[2:21:42.800 --> 2:21:47.920]  different regimes if you will and then uh but this is all absolutely new to me as far as this
[2:21:47.920 --> 2:21:52.880]  virus thing coming out and uh artificial intelligence and things like that these robots flying overhead
[2:21:52.880 --> 2:21:59.920]  it's all all fairly new so it's again i'm kind of taken back with all this stuff going on especially
[2:21:59.920 --> 2:22:04.320]  my time down at the border recently i've been to the border you know through the last 20 years
[2:22:04.320 --> 2:22:08.640]  multiple times multiple different locations and i'd have to say it was the first time i ever saw
[2:22:08.640 --> 2:22:13.360]  it so desolate like a ghost town i mean before it was you know it would take you 30 minutes to an
[2:22:13.360 --> 2:22:17.280]  hour just to get in and then maybe two or three hours just to get back across to the united states
[2:22:17.840 --> 2:22:20.560]  this time walking around the streets were kind of empty people were
[2:22:21.280 --> 2:22:25.840]  hearing the words of the president uh the majority of the individuals that i saw going across were
[2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:30.560]  going in empty handed and coming back with tons of groceries because they didn't want to uh go to
[2:22:30.560 --> 2:22:36.400]  the empty stores that we have here and they would get whatever they needed toilet paper wipes food
[2:22:36.400 --> 2:22:41.200]  water everything that they could ever want was you know plenty of readily available over there
[2:22:41.200 --> 2:22:44.560]  i should have had also your father that's the most important thing and a husband
[2:22:44.560 --> 2:22:50.320]  how's your family handling the virus and all this craziness uh well they're down on lockdown
[2:22:50.320 --> 2:22:54.480]  you know my son he lives with his mother in houston and he's doing online school now
[2:22:54.480 --> 2:22:58.320]  and he's graduating high school this year but they don't even know they're not going to do a prom
[2:22:58.320 --> 2:23:02.800]  or if they're gonna walk or graduate or anything like that uh they will graduate and they will get
[2:23:02.800 --> 2:23:08.640]  something in the mail but they're not going to congregate and huge buildings and of course i've
[2:23:08.640 --> 2:23:12.080]  been hunting with you and your son before my son's gone with us we were talking about doing a hunt
[2:23:12.080 --> 2:23:15.600]  in colorado or something now that's off the table because everything is just going to be shut down
[2:23:15.600 --> 2:23:20.240]  sure absolutely everything's shut down uh nobody's wanting to go out uh i think a lot of it is a little
[2:23:20.240 --> 2:23:26.640]  more being overprotective in my opinion i think we still need to go on to day-to-day lives uh
[2:23:26.640 --> 2:23:31.600]  well that's it first trump was saying it was a hoax or the the media's response was hyping it was
[2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:34.720]  a hoax and then he backed off because they were saying it was doing nothing and i said he should
[2:23:34.720 --> 2:23:39.600]  do something but now it's going too far this will cause a depression oh absolutely uh i mean what's
[2:23:39.600 --> 2:23:44.640]  worse 100 000 dead or a depression and it's not and plus it's not going to save them they admit
[2:23:44.640 --> 2:23:49.520]  the same number will probably get it and die just over 18 months instead of over six months oh
[2:23:49.520 --> 2:23:54.000]  absolutely i mean if you want even to talk worse numbers i mean world health organization in 2016
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:59.920]  said that children five years and under about 5.6 million children died from starvation uh don't
[2:23:59.920 --> 2:24:03.600]  really hear about that but you hear about the 9 or 10 000 individuals that have died from this
[2:24:03.600 --> 2:24:07.920]  disease and how many died from malaria every year a lot more than that i think it's like look up
[2:24:07.920 --> 2:24:12.720]  yearly malaria does something like 10 million or something it's just crazy a lot yeah what about
[2:24:12.720 --> 2:24:17.040]  this china they're now announcing is oh they're okay they're open for business again that was like
[2:24:17.040 --> 2:24:21.760]  a month for them but we're supposed to shut down for 18 months well i guess if you had it planned
[2:24:21.760 --> 2:24:24.640]  if you wanted to go into the whole conspiracy theory and you were china and you had it planned
[2:24:24.640 --> 2:24:28.480]  well then it would be easy to recover just in my opinion uh you don't really hear any things that
[2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:33.840]  they were having issues with before this outbreak such as the uh you know all the protests in china
[2:24:33.840 --> 2:24:37.760]  wanting their their freedoms kind of like what we have here notice that shut down the taiwan stuff
[2:24:37.760 --> 2:24:42.240]  too absolutely you don't hear about that stuff going on anymore uh it's kind of quiet it's like
[2:24:42.240 --> 2:24:46.560]  all of a sudden and before that uh president trump was getting into it with china over uh trade and
[2:24:46.560 --> 2:24:51.840]  and the trade agreements and whatnot and then now you just all of a sudden you see these uh this
[2:24:51.840 --> 2:24:56.400]  coronavirus is kind of taken over and this stuff is going out by the wayside i've got the reports
[2:24:56.400 --> 2:25:02.080]  right here out of indian universities and what the intelligence committee on the senate said
[2:25:02.640 --> 2:25:08.160]  in fact get that clip ready of trump guys they believe that it's man-made and they believe china
[2:25:09.200 --> 2:25:13.680]  is is involved in it but then when we talk about that the media says we're not supposed to say that
[2:25:13.680 --> 2:25:18.160]  but major universities scan the virus and they said you they can see where it was artificially
[2:25:18.720 --> 2:25:24.080]  put together in my opinion honestly uh you know the people in china they've been doing the same
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:27.840]  stuff eating the same food for the past couple thousand years i would say and this has never
[2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:32.240]  really happened uh i don't think they really change anything so in my opinion it would be man-made
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:37.440]  here's what the president had to say a couple days ago about it and i thought he did a great
[2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:42.320]  job because the official chinese military and government spokespersons are saying they believe
[2:25:42.320 --> 2:25:47.600]  the us did it with zero evidence but then our own media says don't say it's man-made when the chinese
[2:25:47.600 --> 2:25:52.400]  are they're just saying we did it here's the president china and others have criticized you for
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:57.840]  using the phrase uh chinese virus how do you feel about that you're going to continue using that
[2:25:57.840 --> 2:26:04.160]  phrase well china uh was putting out information which was false that our military gave this to
[2:26:04.160 --> 2:26:10.720]  them that was false and uh rather than having an argument i said uh i have to call it where it came
[2:26:10.720 --> 2:26:15.440]  from it did come from china so i think it's a very accurate term but no i didn't appreciate the fact
[2:26:15.440 --> 2:26:20.000]  that china was saying that our military gave it to them our military did not give give it to anybody
[2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:26.960]  critics are using our phrase creates a stigma uh no i don't think so no i think saying that our
[2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:32.960]  military gave it to them creates a stigma uh this is the president
[2:26:32.960 --> 2:26:38.240]  here's the difference the chinese government controls the media there and they put out one
[2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:44.160]  message that the government was doing a great job our media is openly saying the president's
[2:26:44.160 --> 2:26:48.480]  doing a terrible job and signing with the communist chinese at every level this is treasonous but
[2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:53.360]  beyond that i mean it just shows this is going to be rocky when the media works against the president
[2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:59.440]  and and and tries to sabotage stuff you're absolutely correct uh you know and i'd have to
[2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:04.640]  say i'd have to applaud the president for uh his comments which we just saw because it's about time
[2:27:04.640 --> 2:27:08.720]  that the we have a president now it's going to actually back us and say when things are right
[2:27:08.720 --> 2:27:14.160]  and wrong you know china's a nation a nationality it's not racist to say something came from china
[2:27:14.160 --> 2:27:18.640]  and i'm not sure why they keep saying that because they kept saying trump is the blame
[2:27:18.640 --> 2:27:22.800]  sure oh and and trumps like screw you it came from wuhan in fact they know it came from that
[2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:26.560]  bio weapons lab the government knows they stand the virus you can literally see it under electron
[2:27:26.560 --> 2:27:32.480]  microscope sure in fact i'll show it it's got slices because they let they cut that in absolutely
[2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:38.240]  it's just crazy oh you're absolutely correct and just to say that it came from anywhere else i guess
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:42.240]  would be uh you know blasphemy where it came from it was wuhan so you might as well go with that yeah
[2:27:42.240 --> 2:27:48.560]  let me show uh listeners some of the best articles to read still is coronavirus contains hiv insertions
[2:27:48.560 --> 2:27:52.640]  stoking fears over artificially created bio weapon then you go to the actual scientific reports by
[2:27:52.640 --> 2:27:57.920]  major universities no it's confirmed okay here's the next one indian scientist discovers coronavirus
[2:27:57.920 --> 2:28:06.080]  engineer with hiv like insertions then it's got all the actual genes and protein signatures cut into
[2:28:06.080 --> 2:28:10.560]  it where they know it was gene edited okay it's it's it's like how do you know a woman's had a
[2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:16.480]  breast job you see the scars i mean it's like ridiculous okay um lab made coronavirus triggers
[2:28:16.480 --> 2:28:22.800]  debate this is the scientist journal five years ago saying why was obama giving a weaponized virus
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:29.360]  to the chai comms and it's almost the same virus minus the hiv slice that they cut into it so uh

[2:30:12.960 --> 2:30:20.080]  the mega corporations and tyrannical regimes like china and the communist part of that runs it
[2:30:20.080 --> 2:30:30.160]  there is a raw desire for power and control over people and now we learn from an mit tipster
[2:30:31.280 --> 2:30:34.640]  we even got the documents and were able to search them and then discovered that it was

[2:31:58.080 --> 2:32:03.040]  the waves of change are here the world has become decadent
[2:32:04.720 --> 2:32:10.320]  the population has become hypnotized and the globalists are moving in for the kill
[2:32:10.320 --> 2:32:19.840]  first they make us stupid and dumb down and put us into a trance and once they've done that once
[2:32:19.840 --> 2:32:26.720]  they've made us obsolete they begin to release the bio weapons each more deadly than last as they
[2:32:26.720 --> 2:32:34.400]  hurt us into the bubble high-tech control grid cities until they finally release the ultimate
[2:32:34.400 --> 2:32:40.800]  bio weapon with a 100 kill rate which then mutates into a harmless bug after a few years
[2:32:42.160 --> 2:32:47.760]  and the controllers emerge from their underground bunkers and of course they have the cure to all
[2:32:47.760 --> 2:32:51.920]  the diseases they release as well they admit it they publicly talk about their plan to kill us all
[2:32:52.560 --> 2:32:55.440]  a lot of liberals are celebrating this so remember who your enemies are
[2:32:55.440 --> 2:33:01.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:01.840 --> 2:33:12.240]  go
[2:33:19.120 --> 2:33:24.000]  alex jones here back live with veteran and patriot and reporter tim reams he has the
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:30.400]  recon review that info wars is sponsoring him and i do went down to the border for four or five days
[2:33:30.400 --> 2:33:34.400]  and followed a bunch of amazing reports you want to get into these reports turn on but you wanted
[2:33:34.400 --> 2:33:37.920]  to go ahead and tell folks what the best thinking is and what you think's really going on with the
[2:33:37.920 --> 2:33:43.440]  virus and where it came from its problems absolutely my personal opinion is that i believe
[2:33:43.440 --> 2:33:48.880]  that the virus was something to kind of uh stop all the eyes that were on china at the time you
[2:33:48.880 --> 2:33:54.320]  know even even going back before uh or during the same time in the protest remember the nba was
[2:33:54.320 --> 2:33:59.440]  having problems with china because they were saying you know we support the chinese protesters and
[2:33:59.440 --> 2:34:03.360]  they didn't like that at all so there was a bunch of even between the nba all that money going back
[2:34:03.360 --> 2:34:08.560]  and forth because china was such a huge uh part of the nba at that time and then you had the protest
[2:34:08.560 --> 2:34:12.880]  and then you had the trade uh disagreements between the u.s and i think it would be a perfect time to
[2:34:12.880 --> 2:34:17.520]  actually push something out like this you know it's not a global killer like it would be like
[2:34:17.520 --> 2:34:22.480]  maybe a modifying bolivirus but this is something perfect enough to great panic at home absolutely
[2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:27.040]  that didn't show up for 14 days spreads really good does kill a bunch of old people and the globalists
[2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:31.200]  want to get rid of old people and and the chai comms remember work with a bunch of big banks
[2:34:31.200 --> 2:34:35.920]  and and most the powerful governments the eu so they knew that they would then support china say
[2:34:35.920 --> 2:34:40.000]  they were heroes but then say america did a terrible job which we predicted six weeks ago
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:44.160]  they've now scripted it exactly sure as they would if they were behind it the same thing with uh
[2:34:44.160 --> 2:34:48.080]  with the timing as oh now we don't have any cases and we're shutting hospital downs or
[2:34:48.080 --> 2:34:52.880]  less people are getting sick is where we're kind of uh starting the bottom of the peak if you will
[2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:57.840]  about the ram and again we're going to be 18 months or probably the depression but china's fine now
[2:34:57.840 --> 2:35:02.720]  sure they're absolutely okay with it this is so obvious and i just hope the idiots in the
[2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:06.720]  mainstream media and all the leftists understand we go into a real depression it's going to hurt
[2:35:06.720 --> 2:35:12.560]  you idiots i mean you are idiots going against your own country in common sense with an authoritarian
[2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:19.120]  regime absolutely it's uh it's not just going to hurt one side or the other this is modern war
[2:35:19.120 --> 2:35:24.240]  we're i think we're really in they call the cold war the third world war i think this is a fourth
[2:35:24.240 --> 2:35:30.400]  world war it's it's definitely something first of our time you know this is absolutely absolutely
[2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:35.520]  as far as the work goes would not be your traditional you know military men and women leaving a country
[2:35:35.520 --> 2:35:39.120]  going to another one to occupy and take over this is absolutely something that would uh
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:45.040]  cost less lives up front as far as a military unit going in but you know it does cost lives on the
[2:35:45.040 --> 2:35:49.520]  back end as well it's really economic destruction sure absolutely mr. Merkel says this is big as
[2:35:49.520 --> 2:35:54.160]  world war two oh absolutely especially with well the whole world is actually involved now the whole
[2:35:54.160 --> 2:35:59.120]  world is shutting down their borders they're locking themselves at home regardless of what country you
[2:35:59.120 --> 2:36:04.880]  are you know even what continent you're at you know it's everybody's affected let's talk about the
[2:36:04.880 --> 2:36:10.160]  border you guys were going to go down and report um let's just say in a south american country
[2:36:10.160 --> 2:36:14.240]  i want to select a little communism but we decided to kill that because they were you might not have
[2:36:14.240 --> 2:36:17.760]  gotten back in the country so you went to the border instead tell folks what some of what you found
[2:36:17.760 --> 2:36:24.800]  and we'll play this um first clip brownsville uh with this uh local immigration lawyer uh admitting
[2:36:24.800 --> 2:36:29.440]  that they're worried about coronavirus coming across so the lawyer uh the lawyer was from
[2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:34.000]  miami and she flew in and she was there to represent some of the immigrants that were
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:39.280]  trying to seek asylum and while they were there she was really upset because there was a lack of
[2:36:39.280 --> 2:36:45.200]  of protection for her as far as the coronavirus was involved uh they kind of she said that everybody
[2:36:45.200 --> 2:36:49.200]  was just kind of pushed together at this in these uh these tents that we we actually i'm
[2:36:49.200 --> 2:36:54.160]  what does she think happens when when the left funds everybody to come up there and then where
[2:36:54.160 --> 2:36:58.720]  are we supposed to put them in the rich carlton oh i guess i'm not exactly sure where she wanted
[2:36:58.720 --> 2:37:03.280]  she just definitely wanted something uh nicer well she's going to get a depression now absolutely
[2:37:03.280 --> 2:37:07.520]  absolutely uh and the other thing too is she was supposed to represent all these individuals
[2:37:07.520 --> 2:37:12.080]  once they came back and then uh but she wasn't being told any information they were kind of
[2:37:12.080 --> 2:37:15.920]  withholding all the information whether she i would always i i kept asking her are there any
[2:37:15.920 --> 2:37:19.520]  precautions being taken are they giving you any masks or gloves or are they doing anything
[2:37:20.160 --> 2:37:25.200]  absolutely not she said she said that they were getting tested from the virus when they were coming
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:28.560]  across then when i asked her specifically what they were doing she said she couldn't tell me
[2:37:28.560 --> 2:37:32.560]  she was just told that they were being tested yeah well when they come in with tb and everything
[2:37:32.560 --> 2:37:36.800]  else they're not tested nobama said that was great trump tried to get some testing but i
[2:37:36.800 --> 2:37:40.960]  love these immigration lawyers these liberals live in this rich country that's now about to fall
[2:37:40.960 --> 2:37:48.080]  apart probably i mean depression's 50 chance the longer this goes and way to work venezuela
[2:37:48.080 --> 2:37:53.040]  these liberals and leftists are about to get a front row seat to what it's like when they got
[2:37:53.040 --> 2:37:57.280]  their clowered and pivot when they finally brought down america's economy absolutely for those that
[2:37:57.280 --> 2:38:02.320]  have not actually seen what's going on in venezuela and what they're doing down there and it didn't
[2:38:02.320 --> 2:38:06.240]  happen overnight this isn't going to happen overnight and if you just like you said if it's
[2:38:06.240 --> 2:38:11.360]  going to take 18 months to finally kick in well venezuela took you know what 14 16 years and now
[2:38:11.360 --> 2:38:16.400]  it's really full steam ahead and uh now other countries around are actually taking the whole
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:21.280]  venezuela issue into their own hands because so many refugees are actually pushing over into
[2:38:21.280 --> 2:38:25.040]  countries like five million in columbia in columbia and and uh i believe it was four years
[2:38:25.600 --> 2:38:29.760]  in four years but shouldn't they be racing to get in everything's free in venezuela
[2:38:30.800 --> 2:38:34.320]  you would you would think if it were actually but of course there's nothing it's free because
[2:38:34.320 --> 2:38:38.400]  there's nothing absolutely absolutely they ate your dogs and cats like five years ago
[2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:42.400]  they were doing that uh one of our contacts actually we uh and i'd been talking to uh
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:46.320]  preparing for that going down there i'd talk to uh she had a master's degree and she had to resort
[2:38:46.320 --> 2:38:52.320]  to prostitution or to feed her family and you know uh so it doesn't really matter if you're
[2:38:52.320 --> 2:38:57.360]  educated or not i mean it's affecting everybody these socialist policies that they hadn't venezuela
[2:38:57.360 --> 2:39:01.520]  you know i said you got a couple degrees you said they're not really yeah i've got a bachelor's
[2:39:01.520 --> 2:39:05.040]  degree and a master's degree and it's you know i don't really you know do anything with them
[2:39:05.040 --> 2:39:09.360]  it's all your street smarts it's uh on the job training of the marine corps yeah
[2:39:09.360 --> 2:39:14.080]  ojt for the marine corps uh kind of got me a little further but i couldn't imagine being a socialist
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:19.360]  country where things are supposedly going to be given to you and then not and so the whole time
[2:39:19.360 --> 2:39:22.160]  you're just kind of sitting there kind of like what we're looking at right now a lot of people
[2:39:22.160 --> 2:39:26.000]  are being promised these checks so they're just sitting at home waiting for them i mean are they
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:29.520]  going to be there i don't i don't know i i hope that the american people are able to get what they
[2:39:29.520 --> 2:39:34.000]  want uh but i can't really say well you can see it i'm not we were doing so great till this happened
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:39.440]  but i said they were gonna sucker punches folks america is in deep trouble and the left is celebrating
[2:39:39.440 --> 2:39:44.400]  it and it's not no one even gets mad the left is hoping we collapsed to get trump it's like
[2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:49.440]  they're just it's so criminal they're so villainous it's it's one of the things i've always said you
[2:39:49.440 --> 2:39:54.320]  know uh if you imagine uh president trump is the pilot of an airplane why would you want the airplane
[2:39:54.320 --> 2:39:57.760]  to go down i don't understand if we're all on this plane yeah they're like we want to kill the pilot
[2:39:57.760 --> 2:40:02.080]  let's crash the plane yeah i've never i've never understood the uh we want everybody to go down
[2:40:02.080 --> 2:40:06.640]  just because they don't like that individual and he did a good job since he got in absolutely and
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:10.960]  you know what's funny about that is recently a couple of the individuals that don't like him
[2:40:10.960 --> 2:40:15.360]  say illhan omar they've been praising him and applauding him for the way he's handled this
[2:40:15.360 --> 2:40:20.160]  as of right now and you know give him kudos and whatnot but for me i've i've been following him
[2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:23.920]  the whole time he hasn't done anything different he's this well that's it they're just here's their
[2:40:23.920 --> 2:40:27.360]  plan once the economy tanks though they're gonna blame it on him watch they know we don't have a
[2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:32.320]  memory here's that immigration lawyer the whole interviews at bandot video in the tim reams section
[2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:36.400]  but again there's the bitching and complaining parts in a larger video but this lady's in for a
[2:40:36.400 --> 2:40:40.800]  rude awakening here it is hello my name's tim reams i'm here with info wars and we're here at the
[2:40:40.800 --> 2:40:45.360]  border in brownsville trying to assess the situation with a coronavirus and whether or not there will
[2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:51.680]  be a shutdown so have you been experiencing any changes at all as far as a potential border crossing
[2:40:51.680 --> 2:41:02.000]  shut down so he's saying that he heard that the united states border wanted a shutdown
[2:41:04.160 --> 2:41:09.120]  individuals that are coming back and forth are they testing you as you come back and no no test
[2:41:09.120 --> 2:41:12.960]  no test so people immigrants who come for the hearings they are being tested for
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:20.000]  for the virus however as attorneys and interpreters who literally travel around the united states
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:25.280]  for instance i'm coming from miami florida we are not tested we are not even asked you come in
[2:41:25.280 --> 2:41:29.920]  you sign in you go in and when i ask them so they just let you walk around with these individuals
[2:41:29.920 --> 2:41:34.480]  as well without being tested back and forth and be exposed to to really court personnel and what
[2:41:34.480 --> 2:41:38.400]  we're looking at right here is a bunch of tents right now which we can only assume is processing
[2:41:38.400 --> 2:41:44.000]  at the moment but who knows we could be actually experiencing maybe a little build up for a potential
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:50.160]  border shutdown i know that there is a petition and decision you know also signed by ice by the
[2:41:50.160 --> 2:41:57.200]  ala by the also the association of judges asking for the courts border courts to be closed
[2:41:57.920 --> 2:42:01.840]  because it's really there is too much uncertainty and because we have so much vulnerable population
[2:42:02.720 --> 2:42:05.840]  so she's trying to bring in all these people who normally aren't even tested
[2:42:05.840 --> 2:42:10.320]  and now she's pissed that she could be in danger absolutely she was uh and she was also upset because
[2:42:10.320 --> 2:42:14.720]  she said that they were withholding information from her which is kind of uh what they kind of
[2:42:14.720 --> 2:42:19.040]  do to us anyway so well exactly but it's like she's trying to burn the house down and then she's
[2:42:19.040 --> 2:42:23.520]  pissed that a spark blew back in at her and got her exactly yeah she was that was she was very upset
[2:42:23.520 --> 2:42:28.400]  that this stuff was happening and maybe she wasn't being taken care of more than maybe other
[2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:31.840]  individuals that she's like i'm here flame throwing your country and just bringing all
[2:42:31.840 --> 2:42:36.880]  these people that george sorrell's funded to get there and then i might get sick as of right now
[2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:40.720]  and then she definitely wants something to be uh something to happen as far as maybe shutting
[2:42:40.720 --> 2:42:45.200]  it down or maybe making it better for her while she was him reams is our guest with the recon review
[2:42:45.760 --> 2:42:52.080]  when we come back we've got the toilet paper smugglers they caught on tape the recon reviews stay with us
[2:42:55.040 --> 2:43:00.800]  it's all over the news it's being announced by politicians from germany the united states

[2:48:08.800 --> 2:48:12.720]  rooms come up the one shroyer after watson's on tim reams is here tim you were pointing out all
[2:48:12.720 --> 2:48:17.120]  these articles on the desk one of these other clips your reports you and rob dude but video
[2:48:17.120 --> 2:48:22.560]  showing looting fights at supermarkets in london in paris there are so many videos just roll the b-roll
[2:48:23.920 --> 2:48:28.720]  that i can't even watch them all of burning hundreds of vehicles and beating up police and
[2:48:28.720 --> 2:48:36.160]  waving isis flags and al-qaeda flags and just just you know no go zones and uh turkey opening its
[2:48:36.160 --> 2:48:44.480]  border and launching all these invaders in and just checkpoints on fire and it's all just just
[2:48:44.480 --> 2:48:51.120]  pouring out the islamists are using this to just expand their no go zones but then the police do
[2:48:51.120 --> 2:48:56.160]  nothing and then throw the book at people that are walking their dog i mean it's just crazy
[2:48:56.160 --> 2:49:01.360]  what do you think the e use thinking you know what i don't i don't even know what they think
[2:49:01.360 --> 2:49:05.600]  they're thinking i don't even know that they uh actually have an answer to it uh especially with
[2:49:05.600 --> 2:49:09.280]  some of the uh like italy for example there's so much going on and so many people dying from this
[2:49:09.280 --> 2:49:14.080]  they just have no clue what they're doing well that's another thing they had 400 plus dead
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:19.040]  in one town yesterday because they had a bunch of chinese immigrants that make all the shoes and all
[2:49:19.040 --> 2:49:22.400]  the handmade stuff you get from italy's chinese made and they're and they fly back and forth they're
[2:49:22.400 --> 2:49:27.440]  only seasonal workers well they were in the hospitals and incubated it through the staff
[2:49:27.440 --> 2:49:31.680]  and so it's all these old people already in critical condition that died that's over 90%
[2:49:31.680 --> 2:49:37.040]  of the dead or above 75 absolutely and uh you know these are absolutely some of the things that
[2:49:37.040 --> 2:49:41.120]  we're actually trying to avoid and it's funny watching these images because i didn't see anything
[2:49:41.120 --> 2:49:45.840]  that bad say around here in austin and then uh but the the stores were pretty packed there's
[2:49:45.840 --> 2:49:50.480]  there's security guards a lot of stores going on right now however when i went to the border i
[2:49:50.480 --> 2:49:56.400]  went to brownsville mcallon and laredo i went down there um it wasn't that bad so much uh everybody
[2:49:56.400 --> 2:49:59.280]  was nice and calm getting the things that they needed and the things that they couldn't get
[2:49:59.280 --> 2:50:02.560]  because it was out they were just walking across the border picking it up and coming back
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:07.360]  yeah mexico's not done all this stuff yet they've done some of it let's let's go
[2:50:07.360 --> 2:50:12.000]  ahead and show the toilet paper hoarding free market activity and folks from mexico
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:18.080]  coming across unimpeded to sell their toilet paper here here's a a clip from the recon review here it
[2:50:18.080 --> 2:50:23.200]  is why people are buying so much toilet paper do you well it's because in harlingen because
[2:50:23.200 --> 2:50:29.440]  everybody is in harlingen um they run out okay so they asked for us to buy them toilet paper
[2:50:29.440 --> 2:50:34.000]  oh and then bring it back yeah so why is everybody running out it's still a kind of a mystery i don't
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:38.080]  even know why they're buying toilet paper so even in mexico it's a mystery as why everybody's buying
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:42.560]  toilet paper yeah everybody's like what's going on it's like i don't know they say there's like no
[2:50:42.560 --> 2:50:47.920]  explanation for why we're running out of paper maybe maybe the americans are just hoarding all of the
[2:50:47.920 --> 2:51:12.560]  toilet paper for no reason so there you have it pretty much mexico has all the toilet paper you
[2:51:12.560 --> 2:51:19.120]  could ever need right here in brownsville just cross right here your name was sir jose said at
[2:51:19.120 --> 2:51:23.600]  first mexico has all the toilet paper that you will ever need but we have actually figured out
[2:51:24.240 --> 2:51:30.800]  the the mystery behind the toilet paper thank you so much for your time it's all in mexico
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:35.680]  you might remember a couple days ago we put out a report of people smuggling toilet paper
[2:51:35.680 --> 2:51:40.400]  from mexico into the us and as you can see it might still be a good idea because there's not a
[2:51:40.400 --> 2:51:44.560]  whole lot of traffic going into mexico so if you're still running out of toilet paper just
[2:51:44.560 --> 2:51:50.560]  drive on in go across come back and there's not long lines at all so we laugh at this but
[2:51:51.440 --> 2:51:55.760]  why do people think it's toilet paper they need and not vitamins or minerals or food
[2:51:55.760 --> 2:52:01.440]  or water filtration and it's just crazy i can't actually you know i have no idea that you're an
[2:52:01.440 --> 2:52:05.680]  expert on survival is a recon marine uh in fact you were even on the big national tv show you know
[2:52:05.680 --> 2:52:12.080]  the american tarzan deal um i mean what would you do for survival what's the most important thing
[2:52:12.080 --> 2:52:17.200]  most importantly i'd get uh you know things like water uh bleach because you can always purify water
[2:52:17.200 --> 2:52:22.880]  with a bleach if you can't boil it uh and then i would get canned foods uh mre's and meals ready
[2:52:22.880 --> 2:52:27.280]  to eat if you will or some of this stuff that like like what you guys are selling the uh the food
[2:52:27.280 --> 2:52:32.560]  that's already packaged you can save it uh save it for a long extended amounts of amounts of time
[2:52:32.560 --> 2:52:36.960]  the toilet paper thing kind of really blows my mind just because you could always use uh
[2:52:36.960 --> 2:52:42.880]  rags and wash it out i mean it's just it's real weird uh and we kept asking the individuals
[2:52:42.880 --> 2:52:46.640]  why exactly and the most for the most part they didn't really know or they knew somebody that
[2:52:46.640 --> 2:52:50.720]  didn't have any because it was all sold out so they were afraid and they would just go to mexico
[2:52:50.720 --> 2:52:54.400]  and with those the lines that weren't that long at all they were absolutely doing that they would
[2:52:54.400 --> 2:52:58.800]  just go so the mexicans aren't panicking as bad as we are no no they're not they're not panicking
[2:52:58.800 --> 2:53:02.480]  and in matter of fact everybody that uh that i asked and everybody that we interviewed you know what
[2:53:02.480 --> 2:53:07.040]  are you thinking about this and like you know for the most part they just uh whatever you know
[2:53:07.040 --> 2:53:12.240]  they're still going to do their thing and then uh it was it was also a lot of uh confusion as to
[2:53:12.240 --> 2:53:16.000]  whether it was going to shut down or not a lot of them said that the us side was going to shut
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:19.920]  down and that the mexican side was not going to shut down so they really weren't worried about it
[2:53:19.920 --> 2:53:25.200]  but now it's all starting to get shut down yeah now uh now they're kind of taking a little more
[2:53:25.200 --> 2:53:33.600]  serious a lot of the uh uh the last place that we were at uh they they had a their city council
[2:53:33.600 --> 2:53:38.000]  actually shut down the city that night and we just so happened to get out and they were shutting
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:42.080]  everything down except for restaurants you could still go in and order food or if you needed medicine
[2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:46.080]  other than that everybody was told to stay in at home they had a curfew and they just voted on it
[2:53:46.080 --> 2:53:50.160]  because two of the individuals that got sick in the town they had no idea where they were the uh
[2:53:50.160 --> 2:53:53.920]  where they got sick from so they couldn't locate you know well here's the deal almost everybody
[2:53:53.920 --> 2:53:58.080]  that's healthy or young does not die from this and it's really sad for old folks they are dying
[2:53:58.080 --> 2:54:02.880]  i'm just saying now we got to do 18 months for trumps bad but china did a month this is bs to
[2:54:02.880 --> 2:54:06.800]  shut us down i i just gonna keep repeating that over and over again let me make a point about
[2:54:06.800 --> 2:54:12.240]  this too this funds our operation but you need it when i go out to sell water filtration i go out
[2:54:12.240 --> 2:54:17.440]  and i find the highest rated that's also a good price alexa pure and of course pro pure are right
[2:54:17.440 --> 2:54:21.680]  there apples and oranges uh you know one's better at this one's better at that but it's all down to
[2:54:21.680 --> 2:54:26.880]  non-detectable levels or nine nine nine nine nine you know percent of the stuff being taken out
[2:54:27.760 --> 2:54:32.640]  and we we have them in stock and we have them discounted during this crisis we have big ones
[2:54:32.640 --> 2:54:36.720]  we have little ones we have travel ones and we have a bunch of other great water filtration systems
[2:54:36.720 --> 2:54:42.560]  as well that at least you know are less expensive but they might just remove nine nine nine nine
[2:54:42.560 --> 2:54:46.720]  percent of hundreds and hundreds of different contaminants out there so people are trying to
[2:54:46.720 --> 2:54:50.240]  buy all this and hoard all this bottled water that's running out everywhere you need to have
[2:54:50.240 --> 2:54:55.360]  filtration that can then take crappy water out of a pond anything and you can use it that's an
[2:54:55.360 --> 2:55:01.360]  infowarstore.com i recommend you get a water filtration system that's portable like these

[2:55:39.440 --> 2:55:43.360]  all the rest of that hey sorry the food's getting sold out everywhere they're now admitting and
[2:55:43.360 --> 2:55:47.440]  mainline government reports that the supply chain's breaking down there will be shortages
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:52.160]  in the months to come this is an engineered collapse trump's fighting it as best he can
[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:56.160]  if he under reacts they'll remove him saying he didn't do enough if he overreacts he falls
[2:55:56.160 --> 2:56:02.640]  with their hands this is uh quite the crisis tim what's your view on that well uh first before
[2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:06.800]  going back to the water purifier i would actually recommend getting two of them because you know one
[2:56:06.800 --> 2:56:10.720]  is none two is one type thing if one breaks down the water is actually one of the bigger things
[2:56:10.720 --> 2:56:14.720]  that i would be more concerned about uh one of the schools i went through for the military was
[2:56:14.720 --> 2:56:19.440]  sear school you know surviving uh evade resistance gave school and they teach you you know on average
[2:56:19.440 --> 2:56:24.640]  you can go uh 48 72 a couple of days without water so you actually do need water as to where
[2:56:24.640 --> 2:56:28.720]  you can go up to on the average american or i've done a lot of folks die in three days that water
[2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:32.480]  uh with well yes that's absolutely correct which is why so water is so important you can actually
[2:56:32.480 --> 2:56:38.320]  go up to about 28 days without food on average give or take uh so the food of course is obviously
[2:56:38.320 --> 2:56:42.240]  important but the water the uh two i would i would personally get two of the portable
[2:56:42.240 --> 2:56:47.360]  water purifiers i actually have to at home uh just for that just for that specific reason
[2:56:47.360 --> 2:56:51.680]  and it's just a box you check off because if the depression hits the good thing is these last
[2:56:51.680 --> 2:56:56.480]  years since thousands of gallons of peace uh things are going to be serious we have the the the the
[2:56:56.480 --> 2:57:01.360]  seed banks uh so you can actually plant crops and do things like this one good thing about this is
[2:57:01.360 --> 2:57:04.880]  we don't become completely domesticated by it it's going to make people get more self-sufficient
[2:57:04.880 --> 2:57:08.320]  the problem is they're saying we're going to lock you up in your house and there's nothing you can
[2:57:08.320 --> 2:57:13.120]  do but but but then get government checks that is not good no absolutely not and if you look at it
[2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:18.720]  now they're saying uh well what is this day four five of the 15 days that was recommended by president
[2:57:18.720 --> 2:57:23.120]  trump yeah and so if you think about 18 months could you imagine what's gonna be like i mean we
[2:57:23.120 --> 2:57:28.800]  only hit not even a week i mean just imagine how much worse it'll get if we don't start doing some
[2:57:28.800 --> 2:57:33.040]  of these things right now and it's it's funny too because you know i'm not by any means the
[2:57:33.040 --> 2:57:37.280]  the huge prepper that a lot of people are or that some individuals are but i tell you what
[2:57:37.280 --> 2:57:40.400]  people aren't making fun of them anymore they're starting to actually go out and buy some of these
[2:57:40.400 --> 2:57:43.520]  things that's right we'll be right back with the clergy response team video
[2:57:45.200 --> 2:57:52.080]  there could no longer be any doubt the globalists have orchestrated this entire crisis but it's not
[2:57:52.080 --> 2:58:00.080]  a hoax the virus is real and the panic it's creating is on a scale never before seen it is said in
[2:58:00.080 --> 2:58:06.240]  the bible that the wicked flee when none pursue but the wicked really run for their lives when
[2:58:06.240 --> 2:58:14.240]  something real is killing people silently and quietly ladies and gentlemen it's time to pray
[2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:22.000]  it's time to seek god's face it's time to repent for the 64 million abortions in america and the
[2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:28.240]  400 million abortions in communist china and for all of the satanism and all of the pedophilia
[2:58:28.240 --> 2:58:35.280]  and all of the corruption or god is going to continue to allow the globalist to judge us for him
[2:58:35.280 --> 2:58:42.000]  that's right god is lifting the hedge of protection away from the people and allowing satan and his
[2:58:42.000 --> 2:58:48.480]  armies to have their will with the people we've all watched with disgust and anger
[2:58:49.280 --> 2:58:55.760]  as companies across the united states in the world raise prices during this crisis and gouge
[2:58:55.760 --> 2:59:01.760]  their customers in full wars has done the opposite despite the fact that we've sold out of many of

[2:59:49.680 --> 2:59:52.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:59:52.320 --> 2:59:59.120]  and as case lay news 12 jeff barrell discovered the clergy would help the government with potentially
[2:59:59.120 --> 3:00:05.600]  their biggest problem us done confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency
[3:00:05.600 --> 3:00:11.200]  following hurricane katrina in new orleans u.s troops also arrived something far easier to
[3:00:11.200 --> 3:00:18.400]  do even now thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 posse cometotus act that forbid u.s
[3:00:18.400 --> 3:00:24.560]  troops from policing on american soil easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical
[3:00:24.560 --> 3:00:30.080]  and that's exactly what the clergy response team as it's called helped accomplish in new orleans
[3:00:30.080 --> 3:00:34.240]  jeff the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's cooperate get this thing over with
[3:00:34.240 --> 3:00:38.880]  and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over such clergy response teams would
[3:00:38.880 --> 3:00:44.720]  walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus the wishes of the public in a lot of cases
[3:00:44.720 --> 3:00:49.600]  these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're helping to diffuse
[3:00:49.600 --> 3:00:54.560]  that situation for the clergy one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the
[3:00:54.560 --> 3:01:02.480]  public down or obey the law is the bible itself specifically romans romans 13 because the government
[3:01:02.480 --> 3:01:06.560]  is established by the lord you know and uh and that's what we believe in the christian faith that's
[3:01:06.560 --> 3:01:11.600]  what's stated in the scripture uh no that's what you twist that was hitler's favorite bible verse
[3:01:11.600 --> 3:01:16.800]  and radio broadcast is romans 13 is north korea established by god uh is communist china established
[3:01:16.800 --> 3:01:24.480]  by god no they kill christians and we're we're we the people and see god is our leader so a total
[3:01:24.480 --> 3:01:28.720]  twisting there tim and so we now know they've deployed the clergy response teams it's not trump
[3:01:28.720 --> 3:01:33.520]  it's the bureaucracy fema has and they've been trained as leftists tell everybody turn your guns
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:38.240]  in and the left's going to try to use this crisis to try to go after our guns they now admit that
[3:01:38.240 --> 3:01:42.560]  the fbi saying they may shut down the instant check system because we can't have everybody on the
[3:01:42.560 --> 3:01:46.880]  phones well no that's essential to keep the you're working for the instant background check what do
[3:01:46.880 --> 3:01:52.320]  you think about that shocking video you know i think it'd be very dangerous so i came up to my
[3:01:52.320 --> 3:01:57.280]  my house uh regardless if he was clergy or not and asked me for my gun because absolutely absolutely
[3:01:57.280 --> 3:02:02.880]  wouldn't happen and so i think that's very dangerous especially if uh people are trapped up in their
[3:02:02.880 --> 3:02:06.480]  cooped up in their homes all day and uh for weeks at a time and then you go in there and ask them for
[3:02:06.480 --> 3:02:10.800]  their guns and which i don't even understand to the what point well that would make the criminals
[3:02:10.800 --> 3:02:15.600]  be able to take over just like chicago or dc i mean that's crazy well and it would be easy to do
[3:02:15.600 --> 3:02:19.840]  especially now that you've seen in the news that they're actually talking about releasing criminals
[3:02:19.840 --> 3:02:23.200]  out of these prisons so they're doing it you don't want them to get sick and then now you want
[3:02:23.200 --> 3:02:27.360]  everybody else to give away their guns well that's that's just not gonna happen stay in your house
[3:02:27.360 --> 3:02:31.360]  but turn in your gun i mean my point is the democrats and the globalists are going to seize on every
[3:02:31.360 --> 3:02:36.080]  bit of this to get as much power as they can and i think trump should admonish them not to do it
[3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:40.240]  i do too i don't i don't think it's a i mean there's diseases that go all the way around the world
[3:02:40.240 --> 3:02:44.800]  and so now we're just gonna let everybody out because nine ten thousand individuals died from
[3:02:44.800 --> 3:02:49.360]  a disease you know sad to say that that many people died and you know i feel for them and
[3:02:49.360 --> 3:02:54.560]  whatnot however uh i shouldn't be prisoner in my own home and have all these prisoners who broke the
[3:02:54.560 --> 3:02:58.880]  law willingly released and then be able to do whatever they want and i've seen some of the
[3:02:58.880 --> 3:03:02.240]  lists of the things that they're actually not going to arrest individuals for you know theft
[3:03:02.240 --> 3:03:06.000]  burglary and things like that but if you leave your house they'll arrest you that or or if you're in
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:10.880]  a group of uh bigger than ten that might be the other but the border's still wide open though
[3:03:10.880 --> 3:03:14.960]  trump is trying to secure it the democrats and the judges are trying to block all of it it's insane
[3:03:14.960 --> 3:03:21.040]  and meanwhile erdogan is sending in masses of people in an admitted invasion of europe sure yeah
[3:03:21.040 --> 3:03:24.960]  they're they're they're sending them in and uh you know which is another reason why we kind of
[3:03:24.960 --> 3:03:28.560]  went to the border because it was one of the things where you know i wanted to see exactly for myself
[3:03:28.560 --> 3:03:33.200]  exactly what they were doing and which wasn't much as far as you know i wanted to see if i were to
[3:03:33.200 --> 3:03:37.280]  take a flight come home are they gonna take my temperature are they gonna say that i do have
[3:03:37.280 --> 3:03:41.840]  a cough and they're gonna hold me what's the next mission people can see at bandot video all the
[3:03:41.840 --> 3:03:47.600]  reports there in the recon uh review side the tim reams area at bandot video but what's the next
[3:03:47.600 --> 3:03:51.200]  mission you're thinking about the next mission i'm gonna do uh just because we still have an
[3:03:51.200 --> 3:03:56.400]  election coming up and you've got uh biden and bernie head to head uh you know regardless of who
[3:03:56.400 --> 3:04:00.560]  you're going for uh i'm gonna go down to columbia we're actually going to interview venezuelan
[3:04:00.560 --> 3:04:04.480]  refugees some of the five million individuals that have actually escaped in the last four five years
[3:04:04.480 --> 3:04:08.320]  we're gonna go there we're actually gonna see exactly uh how great socialism is you know if it's
[3:04:08.320 --> 3:04:12.480]  so great why have you left well i want to see that happen but if they shut down all the flights
[3:04:12.480 --> 3:04:16.720]  so you're gonna have to well they're gonna if they shut down the flights i'll kind of postpone
[3:04:16.720 --> 3:04:22.160]  it so then uh but until then uh you know kind of uh you know take up my time i might go around
[3:04:22.160 --> 3:04:26.000]  downtown here in central central texas and see if people are walking around running around still
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:29.680]  doing some of the outdoor stuff that they are uh which i'm going to do i'm not going to stay in
[3:04:29.680 --> 3:04:33.680]  the house i'm just not going to do it well it's it's just ridiculous it's a total culture of fear
[3:04:33.680 --> 3:04:37.920]  we're not saying the virus isn't deadly but my god it's just and it's going to build up it's going
[3:04:37.920 --> 3:04:44.240]  to kill a lot of people but uh traffic traffic is great right now man i it's like i can't drive
[3:04:44.240 --> 3:04:50.640]  around anywhere five times faster tim reams great job all right paul joseph watson from london england
[3:04:50.640 --> 3:04:58.240]  he's coming up in 60 seconds info wars has had to suspend all new food sales because the supply
[3:04:58.240 --> 3:05:05.520]  chain has collapsed this is a system-wide problem and this country is facing a new depression
[3:05:06.160 --> 3:05:11.840]  unless trump and the american people work together to develop a plan to expose this
[3:05:11.840 --> 3:05:19.280]  globalist operation that's it people are calling and saying we wish you had the supplements in stock
[3:05:19.280 --> 3:05:25.520]  we wish that wasn't sold out they've confused that with the food everything we advertise everything
[3:05:25.520 --> 3:05:32.800]  we sell we have in stock and we are only one day behind in shipping that means if you order on a
[3:05:32.800 --> 3:05:39.280]  monday it's shipping out on a wednesday and that's just as of today most days we are up to the day
[3:05:39.280 --> 3:05:45.280]  shipping meaning you order that day in the morning a lot of times it ships out that afternoon we have
[3:05:45.280 --> 3:05:53.120]  everything in stock that is so good to boost your overall defense against what's going on
[3:05:58.480 --> 3:06:05.520]  live from london england it's paul joseph watson with summit dot news
[3:06:05.520 --> 3:06:15.440]  and we are live talking about the chinese wuhan coronavirus the chinese virus which started
[3:06:15.440 --> 3:06:21.600]  in china was the fault of the chinese government and continues to be despite the protest stations
[3:06:21.600 --> 3:06:27.200]  of the main street media in america which is now on a daily basis multiple times daily literally
[3:06:27.200 --> 3:06:34.560]  mimicking boosting echoing chinese state propaganda because orange man bad they're
[3:06:34.560 --> 3:06:40.320]  literally taking the playbook the narrative directly from the state media from the foreign
[3:06:40.320 --> 3:06:48.400]  ministry of china in blaming trump blaming america for this outbreak and absolving china of blame
[3:06:48.400 --> 3:06:53.120]  despite the fact that they were responsible for it they covered it up for over a month
[3:06:53.120 --> 3:06:59.040]  they claimed back on january 14th and the world health organization amplified this
[3:06:59.040 --> 3:07:05.600]  that coronavirus was not transmissible from human to human they silenced whistleblowers
[3:07:05.600 --> 3:07:11.520]  threw them in prison this is the chinese virus they're responsible there to blame but you wouldn't
[3:07:11.520 --> 3:07:17.440]  know that if you're watching cnn or msnbc by the way now msnbc and we're going to get to this later
[3:07:18.240 --> 3:07:22.560]  they're now saying that it's racist to call it the chinese virus and that it should be called
[3:07:22.560 --> 3:07:30.400]  the bat virus now six weeks ago they were telling me they were telling people who were calling it
[3:07:30.400 --> 3:07:36.480]  the bat virus who were saying that this started as a result of people eating bats bats did transmit
[3:07:36.480 --> 3:07:42.880]  the disease that that was racist but now you can say that you just can't call it the chinese virus
[3:07:42.880 --> 3:07:49.360]  so yes next month maybe calling it the corona virus will be racist as well headline up on
[3:07:49.360 --> 3:07:57.600]  summit dot news china again pushes conspiracy america is to blame for coronavirus us media ignores
[3:07:58.720 --> 3:08:03.440]  they've done it yet again there's while the us media continues to obsess over trump calling
[3:08:03.440 --> 3:08:09.920]  covet nineteen the chinese virus which again jim acosta of cnn did so today he called it the chinese
[3:08:09.920 --> 3:08:17.040]  virus china itself continues to claim that america is to blame for releasing the coronavirus
[3:08:17.040 --> 3:08:22.800]  they've done it again on state media on chinese state media they had an expert on who said quote
[3:08:22.800 --> 3:08:28.160]  the us pushed out the vaccine so quickly despite the fact that there's no vaccine yet they're
[3:08:28.160 --> 3:08:32.640]  saying there won't be a vaccine for 18 months there may be a drug but there's no vaccine
[3:08:33.440 --> 3:08:39.120]  that only means they have been working on it way before the pandemic and then the host responded
[3:08:39.120 --> 3:08:45.840]  to this expert on chinese state television by saying so we can conclude that the us had this
[3:08:45.840 --> 3:08:52.400]  virus in their possession long ago so the obvious implication is they had the vaccine
[3:08:52.400 --> 3:08:58.400]  because they created the virus long before this outbreak thereby blaming the united
[3:08:58.400 --> 3:09:04.640]  states of america for the outbreak now they're saying this multiple times daily in china not
[3:09:04.640 --> 3:09:09.360]  only on state tv but their own chinese foreign ministry which i'm going to get onto and not
[3:09:09.360 --> 3:09:15.600]  only is the us media not reporting on it they're claiming and they did this in the press conference
[3:09:15.600 --> 3:09:21.840]  yesterday in the aftermath of it that trump is lying and that trump made up a conspiracy theory
[3:09:21.840 --> 3:09:27.280]  that china is blaming america for starting the coronavirus pandemic they're literally saying
[3:09:27.280 --> 3:09:34.720]  that even as every single day state organs of the chinese communist party say exactly that
[3:09:35.600 --> 3:09:42.240]  two days ago we reported the claim of china's foreign ministry spokesman zhou lijian
[3:09:42.240 --> 3:09:48.000]  who suggested that the us military was to blame for coronavirus he tweeted this twice in one day
[3:09:48.560 --> 3:09:54.080]  the chinese government not only refused to disavow lijian they endorsed his conspiracy
[3:09:54.080 --> 3:09:59.360]  in official communist party mouthpieces the global times which is the mouthpiece of the
[3:09:59.360 --> 3:10:05.440]  chinese communist party echoed endorsed his claim they actually quote tweeted him so there was no
[3:10:05.440 --> 3:10:13.520]  disavow whatsoever and again this is a media which for the past four years has been completely
[3:10:13.520 --> 3:10:22.640]  besotted and obsessed with foreign meddling and fake news by foreign powers and yet we have a
[3:10:22.640 --> 3:10:28.640]  foreign power a hostile foreign power now in china spinning a fake news conspiracy theory
[3:10:28.640 --> 3:10:34.000]  that the us is to blame for a global pandemic and not only are they not giving it attention
[3:10:34.000 --> 3:10:40.240]  they're actually aligning with china with their black propaganda narrative in blaming trump the
[3:10:40.240 --> 3:10:45.840]  outbreak or at least in saying that trump is trying to deflect from his own responsibility
[3:10:45.840 --> 3:10:51.120]  for the coronavirus outbreak by pointing the finger at china and by calling it the chinese
[3:10:51.120 --> 3:10:57.840]  virus to the point where you add white house reporters making up claims that somebody in
[3:10:57.840 --> 3:11:03.280]  the white house staff had called it kung flu with no evidence whatsoever when the person was asked
[3:11:03.280 --> 3:11:09.120]  who said this nobody really knew who it was they've completely ignored the story with some even
[3:11:09.120 --> 3:11:13.840]  insisting that trumps claim beijing is blaming america is completely made up they're saying
[3:11:13.840 --> 3:11:19.360]  where's trump got this idea from the chinese foreign ministers talking about it every freaking
[3:11:19.360 --> 3:11:25.120]  day on twitter it's on chinese state media every single day oh where's trump got it from
[3:11:25.120 --> 3:11:34.320]  now we have major news networks and this this is in cbs today hailing china's response as a lesson
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:42.720]  to the us they literally lied two months ago and claimed that the coronavirus was not transmissible
[3:11:42.720 --> 3:11:49.440]  from human to human and the world health organization tweeted it and said oh it's all under control
[3:11:49.440 --> 3:11:57.200]  because it can't be transmitted from humans to humans bold face lie then we have another study
[3:11:58.000 --> 3:12:01.680]  and i'm going to get onto this article which proves that they if they'd have told the truth
[3:12:01.680 --> 3:12:05.600]  from the start and not hidden this for six weeks and not literally locked up whistle
[3:12:05.600 --> 3:12:09.920]  block blowers who said that this was a big deal they could have stopped the global geographic
[3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:17.200]  spread of coronavirus by 95 percent oh but the america needs to learn the lesson from china
[3:12:17.200 --> 3:12:24.480]  what's the lesson cover it up for six months lock up whistle blowers kill 3 000 of your own people
[3:12:24.480 --> 3:12:30.480]  is that the lesson in some cases they've even mirrored and amplified the chinese communist
[3:12:30.480 --> 3:12:36.080]  parties rhetoric in claiming that blaming china for coronavirus despite the fact that it originated
[3:12:36.080 --> 3:12:42.880]  in china and china covered it up for over a month is also a form of racism because people's hurt
[3:12:42.880 --> 3:12:48.640]  feelings are more important than stopping a global pandemic as we know by now you had hillary clinton
[3:12:48.640 --> 3:12:57.520]  yesterday tweet an almost indistinct indistinguishable rhetoric from the chinese state media china
[3:12:57.520 --> 3:13:04.960]  jinhua news tweeted racism is not the right tool to cover your own incompetence they're accusing
[3:13:04.960 --> 3:13:12.000]  america of incompetence when they could have saved this 95 percent global spread of this virus
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:16.960]  if they'd have told the truth about it from the start and then hillary clinton puts out a tweet
[3:13:16.960 --> 3:13:23.120]  which is in terms of tone and rhetoric almost the mirror image of chinese state propaganda
[3:13:24.240 --> 3:13:29.280]  then you have silicon valley of course they've been in on this hysterical fear mongering for the
[3:13:29.280 --> 3:13:36.400]  past four years about how russian bots are manipulating social media to push pro kremlin
[3:13:36.400 --> 3:13:41.680]  narratives and to meddle in america's internal affairs well now we have clear evidence and there's
[3:13:41.680 --> 3:13:48.320]  an article on this out of the national pulse headline chinese bots flood twitter to spread
[3:13:48.320 --> 3:13:54.480]  anti trump coronavirus conspiracy theories so you've literally got chinese bots flooding twitter
[3:13:54.480 --> 3:13:59.920]  amplifying this chinese state media black propaganda that america's to blame for the
[3:13:59.920 --> 3:14:05.360]  outbreak of the coronavirus flooding twitter twitter does nothing about it oh but they're
[3:14:05.360 --> 3:14:11.280]  going to ban people who don't amplify claims by experts who are the experts the people who are
[3:14:11.280 --> 3:14:17.440]  aligned with chinese state propaganda people who talk to cbs and say we need to learn a lesson from
[3:14:17.440 --> 3:14:22.240]  china they're the experts so twitter are going to ban you for that but you can have hordes of
[3:14:22.240 --> 3:14:29.440]  actual chinese bots influencing twitter meddling and they're not going to do a damn thing about it
[3:14:30.320 --> 3:14:34.960]  article concludes by saying apparently trump potentially offending chinese people is more
[3:14:34.960 --> 3:14:41.200]  important to the press than a hostile foreign power launching a propaganda offensive to blame america
[3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:47.280]  for releasing a deadly virus and this this is the lesson that they taught america
[3:14:48.080 --> 3:14:53.840]  headline study global pandemic could have been avoided if china had acted sooner a scientific
[3:14:53.840 --> 3:14:58.560]  study is found that had china acted sooner to combat the spread of the coronavirus the spread
[3:14:58.560 --> 3:15:04.640]  could have been almost entirely avoided and it would not have become a global pandemic this is
[3:15:04.640 --> 3:15:10.080]  the lesson apparently that cbs says the trump administration and america needs to learn
[3:15:10.080 --> 3:15:16.640]  research out the university of southampton based on world population mapping discovered that if
[3:15:16.640 --> 3:15:20.800]  interventions in china could have been conducted one week two weeks or three weeks earlier
[3:15:20.800 --> 3:15:30.320]  cases could have been reduced by 66 86 and 95 respectively significantly limiting the geographical
[3:15:30.320 --> 3:15:35.680]  spread of the disease they could have saved the lives of thousands of people in china
[3:15:35.680 --> 3:15:41.040]  thousands of people in iran thousands of people in italy they didn't do it because they lied about
[3:15:41.040 --> 3:15:46.240]  the nature and the true threat of the outbreak from the very beginning and then it spread
[3:15:46.240 --> 3:15:52.240]  around the world this is the lesson that america needs to learn from china according to cbs news

[3:19:52.560 --> 3:19:59.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:06.480 --> 3:20:11.920]  you're listening to the summit.news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[3:20:11.920 --> 3:20:22.400]  so a study published in march indicated that if chinese authorities had acted three weeks earlier
[3:20:22.400 --> 3:20:28.400]  than they did the number of coronavirus cases could have been reduced by 95 percent and it's
[3:20:28.400 --> 3:20:35.920]  geographic spread limited and what is the u.s media's constant daily reaction boohoo stop being mean
[3:20:35.920 --> 3:20:41.280]  to china stop calling it the chinese virus some people may be offended oh when you need to learn
[3:20:41.280 --> 3:20:48.880]  the lesson from china and how they reacted to this absolutely absurd this is a study again
[3:20:48.880 --> 3:20:53.840]  headline study global pandemic could have been avoided if china had acted sooner university of
[3:20:53.840 --> 3:21:01.360]  south hampton in the uk study author dr sheng ji light said our study demonstrates how important
[3:21:01.360 --> 3:21:07.200]  it is countries facing an imminent outbreak to proactively plan the coordinated response which
[3:21:07.200 --> 3:21:12.640]  swiftly tackles the spread of the disease on a number of fronts one of the other professors
[3:21:12.640 --> 3:21:17.040]  involved in the study said quote we have narrow window of opportunity globally to respond to this
[3:21:17.040 --> 3:21:22.560]  disease our findings significant significantly contribute to an improved understanding of how
[3:21:22.560 --> 3:21:28.320]  best to implement these measures and the study outlines how it became clear that the first
[3:21:28.320 --> 3:21:34.560]  cases of the chinese virus were reported in oh yeah i said chinese virus oh my god boohoo
[3:21:34.560 --> 3:21:41.680]  boohoo were reported in mid late november and early december with scientists even estimating
[3:21:41.680 --> 3:21:47.360]  that the first jump of the virus from animals to humans probably occurred in october in the city of
[3:21:47.360 --> 3:21:54.720]  wuhan months before they even publicly acknowledged there was a problem instead of acting immediately
[3:21:54.720 --> 3:22:01.760]  the chinese government waited until january 23rd before issuing a quarantine to 11 million people
[3:22:01.760 --> 3:22:08.480]  living in wuhan while those flights were still flying out of wuhan still flying out of shanghai
[3:22:08.480 --> 3:22:14.240]  still flying out of beijing to every corner of the world by the way who started the coronavirus
[3:22:14.240 --> 3:22:23.040]  spread in italy two tourists from china who started the coronavirus spread in iran migrant laborers
[3:22:23.040 --> 3:22:30.560]  from china again this would have stopped the spread by 95 percent if they'd have been honest
[3:22:30.560 --> 3:22:37.120]  about it from the start the communist state was also actively working to suppress and punish
[3:22:37.120 --> 3:22:42.080]  doctors and scientists who tried to get warnings out the lives of the world by claiming there was
[3:22:42.080 --> 3:22:47.840]  no evidence of human to human transmission which by the way not just china was responsible for that
[3:22:48.640 --> 3:22:54.960]  the world health organization and the tweet is in this article on january 14th
[3:22:54.960 --> 3:23:01.680]  said this preliminary investigations conducted by the chinese authorities who you can trust
[3:23:02.400 --> 3:23:07.040]  have found no clear evidence of human to human transmission of the novel coronavirus that was
[3:23:07.040 --> 3:23:15.200]  january 14th the who amplifying communist party propaganda that was completely inaccurate
[3:23:15.200 --> 3:23:21.120]  put the world on the back foot and prevented the world from waking up and responding properly
[3:23:21.120 --> 3:23:27.600]  to this pandemic before it occurred and you still have people like richard has at the council on
[3:23:27.600 --> 3:23:34.640]  foreign relations coming out and saying that again like cbs news said that we need to learn from china
[3:23:35.600 --> 3:23:40.880]  they're responsible for the global spread of this pandemic they're responsible for covering it up
[3:23:40.880 --> 3:23:46.320]  they're responsible for locking up whistleblowers that's why we call it the chinese virus
[3:23:46.320 --> 3:23:53.280]  the London Times reported chinese scientists destroyed proof of virus in december
[3:23:54.080 --> 3:23:58.880]  chinese laboratories identified a mystery virus as a highly infectious new pathogen
[3:23:58.880 --> 3:24:06.560]  by late december last year but they were ordered to stop tests destroy samples and suppress the news
[3:24:07.200 --> 3:24:11.680]  oh that's exactly the lesson we need to learn from china cbs is that what you're talking about
[3:24:11.680 --> 3:24:17.760]  the regional health official in Wuhan sensor of the outbreak demanded the destruction of the lab
[3:24:17.760 --> 3:24:23.760]  samples that established the cause of unexplained viral pneumonia on january 1st china did not
[3:24:23.760 --> 3:24:28.960]  acknowledge there was human to human transmission until more than three weeks later and one week
[3:24:28.960 --> 3:24:35.600]  after they lied and said there was no human to human transmission is that the lesson that
[3:24:35.600 --> 3:24:43.200]  america needs to learn from china and then we have this absurd development yesterday richard
[3:24:43.200 --> 3:24:50.000]  engel the journalist for msnbc got up on msnbc and said that yes it is racist to call it the
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:57.440]  chinese virus because it came from bats and that it's a bat virus six weeks ago you were all saying
[3:24:57.440 --> 3:25:04.320]  that if we referred to it as the bat virus if we talked about it being you know unclean not in line
[3:25:04.320 --> 3:25:10.160]  with have reasonable sanitary conditions to be biting the heads of bats ozzy osbourne style
[3:25:10.160 --> 3:25:17.840]  that beat markets in wuhan eating snakes eating all kinds of wild exotic animals that that was
[3:25:17.840 --> 3:25:25.200]  racist to say that the entire bat suit meme for two three weeks straight the media says that was a
[3:25:25.200 --> 3:25:31.040]  racist dog whistle but now it's racist to call it the chinese virus and we should call it the bat
[3:25:31.040 --> 3:25:35.680]  virus what are they going to say next month is it going to be racist to call it the chinese
[3:25:35.680 --> 3:25:40.480]  virus to call it the corona virus next month are we going to have to call it somewhat something else
[3:25:40.480 --> 3:25:46.560]  remember literally six times the world health organization came out with statements saying
[3:25:46.560 --> 3:25:51.520]  yeah this is pretty bad and it could be a global pandemic but the most important thing is first
[3:25:51.520 --> 3:25:57.120]  of all to not stop the flow of international traffic of people because that's sacred even though
[3:25:57.120 --> 3:26:03.760]  that's what spread the global pandemic and to talk about it in the right way and to use the right
[3:26:03.760 --> 3:26:08.640]  words and you're not allowed to use these words to talk about it because some people might feel
[3:26:08.640 --> 3:26:14.400]  stigmatized and offended they literally said that the two months solid as this spread around the world
[3:26:15.120 --> 3:26:19.680]  and now they're saying that it's the bat virus when they said calling it the bat virus six weeks
[3:26:19.680 --> 3:26:28.400]  ago was racist here's richard engel from msnbc saying that exact thing let's roll the clip to
[3:26:28.400 --> 3:26:33.440]  scapegoat people and that is what has always happened when there have been pandemics or epidemics
[3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:39.520]  that foreigners are are attacked foreigners sometimes physically attacked if you look at what
[3:26:39.520 --> 3:26:45.840]  happened during the the middle ages there was lots and lots of scapegoating against an ethnic group
[3:26:45.840 --> 3:26:51.680]  or a religious group whenever there were pandemics that affected the society and frightened a lot of
[3:26:51.680 --> 3:26:57.120]  people and china certainly feels that is what happened what is happening now with people calling
[3:26:57.120 --> 3:27:03.280]  it the the wuhan flu or the wuhan virus or the the china virus this is a virus that came from
[3:27:03.280 --> 3:27:10.480]  the territory of china but came from bats this is a bat virus not a china virus it doesn't speak
[3:27:10.480 --> 3:27:16.000]  chinese it doesn't target chinese people uh it targets human beings who happen to touch their
[3:27:16.000 --> 3:27:23.840]  eyes nose or or mouth so now they're literally claiming that it's the bat virus when six weeks
[3:27:23.840 --> 3:27:27.760]  ago they said that anyone who called it the bat by in fact i'm going to dig up the articles for
[3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:33.600]  the next segment where the same news networks now saying you have to call it the bat virus
[3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:39.120]  said that calling it the bat virus was racist and xenophobic literally four to six weeks ago
[3:27:39.120 --> 3:27:43.760]  they were saying that but now we're worshiping china apparently because china's not to blame
[3:27:43.760 --> 3:27:48.400]  and trumps to blame because he's trying to deflect attention from china china had nothing to do with
[3:27:48.400 --> 3:27:55.680]  it we had the new york times lauding china's humanitarian efforts those were their words
[3:27:55.680 --> 3:28:00.000]  to combat the pandemic that it started may as well been written by the communist party
[3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:05.360]  and in this article they laud china again for the response headline it's corona viadra cases
[3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:11.200]  dwindling china turns focus outward but then they admit in this article that while china was
[3:28:11.200 --> 3:28:17.200]  desperately begging for respite but italy was desperately begging for respirators china refused
[3:28:17.200 --> 3:28:24.080]  to hand them over and it was selling masks and respirators it says many in italy for example
[3:28:24.080 --> 3:28:30.000]  angrily pointed out that china was selling masks respirators and other medical equipment
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:35.760]  not donating them so in an article licking china's bought about their response and how
[3:28:35.760 --> 3:28:40.560]  they helped the world cope with this pandemic they actually admit in the body of the article
[3:28:41.200 --> 3:28:46.800]  that italy was angry with them because they refused to donate the crucial medical equipment

[3:33:21.680 --> 3:33:27.280]  headline up on sky news coronavirus number of covid-19 deaths in italy surpasses china as total
[3:33:27.280 --> 3:33:36.960]  reaches 3405 italy is now the worst impacted country with regard to coronavirus you've seen the
[3:33:37.600 --> 3:33:42.400]  horrific images the videos of the military vehicles transporting the coffins out of
[3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:47.840]  certain areas of italy because they've just got no room to bury the victims good news though
[3:33:47.840 --> 3:33:54.000]  anti malaria drug to fight covid-19 could be available in days says donald trump he said this
[3:33:54.000 --> 3:33:58.640]  during the wires press conference today an anti malaria drug that could help fight coronavirus
[3:33:58.640 --> 3:34:05.200]  could be available within united states within days hydrochloroquine which is used for severe
[3:34:05.200 --> 3:34:10.480]  arthritis lupus and autoimmune condition has shown very encouraging early results and set
[3:34:10.480 --> 3:34:14.640]  to be approved for coronavirus use quickly he said we're going to make that drug available
[3:34:14.640 --> 3:34:19.840]  almost immediately it could be available in days it's a medical war we have to win this war
[3:34:19.840 --> 3:34:25.360]  and they were discussing this on tucker carlson last night a potential drug that could offset
[3:34:25.360 --> 3:34:30.400]  the impact of coronavirus while we wait for the development of a vaccine which apparently according
[3:34:30.400 --> 3:34:36.160]  to china the us already had months ago i guess the mainstream media is going to start repeating
[3:34:36.160 --> 3:34:41.520]  that claim next but that does appear to be some positive developments in terms of
[3:34:42.240 --> 3:34:46.240]  developing a drug to fight coronavirus here's tucker carlson from last night
[3:34:46.240 --> 3:34:52.960]  it's time to figure out how to treat the coronavirus this is a country of science and
[3:34:52.960 --> 3:34:56.640]  we will defeat this at some point the sooner the better fortunately there's some good news to
[3:34:56.640 --> 3:35:02.800]  reports not in that front early evidence suggests that chloroquine that's a cheap anti malaria drug
[3:35:02.800 --> 3:35:07.600]  may be effective in treating coronavirus gregory regano is an advisor of the stanford university
[3:35:07.600 --> 3:35:13.120]  school of medicine and he joins us tonight thanks so much for coming on so tell us what
[3:35:13.120 --> 3:35:20.320]  this is and why you think it's promising please so the president has the authority to authorize the
[3:35:20.320 --> 3:35:27.440]  use of hydroxychloroquine against coronavirus immediately he has cut more red tape at the
[3:35:27.440 --> 3:35:35.440]  fda than any other president in history and for example in 2017 a new drug was approved for muscular
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:42.880]  dystrophy that enroll in a for a clinical trial that for a clinical trial that enrolled less than
[3:35:42.880 --> 3:35:49.280]  15 patients and was generally uncontrolled in an open setting hydroxychloroquine has been on the
[3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:56.640]  market for over 50 years with a quality safety profile and i'm here to report that as of this
[3:35:56.640 --> 3:36:03.360]  morning about five o'clock this morning a well-controlled peer-reviewed study carried out
[3:36:03.360 --> 3:36:10.640]  by the most eminent infectious disease specialist in the world diddy a row old md phd out of the
[3:36:10.640 --> 3:36:17.040]  south of france in which he enrolled 40 patients again a well-controlled peer-reviewed study
[3:36:17.040 --> 3:36:24.400]  that showed a 100 pure right cure rate against coronavirus the study was released this morning
[3:36:24.400 --> 3:36:32.000]  on my twitter account regano esq as well as our most recent website covetrial.io
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:38.640]  the study was recently accepted to the international journal of anti-microbial agents by el severe
[3:36:41.680 --> 3:36:46.960]  so so i obviously i i only know what you're telling me but i i do know it's very unusual
[3:36:46.960 --> 3:36:51.840]  for a study of anything to pursue to produce results of a hundred percent i mean that that's
[3:36:51.840 --> 3:36:58.560]  remarkable isn't or i'm missing something that is remarkable in fact to be able to cure a virus
[3:36:58.560 --> 3:37:04.240]  was said to be mathematically impossible and the first company that did it was a small biotech
[3:37:04.240 --> 3:37:10.240]  called pharma set that was acquired by gilead sciences in the cure to hepatitis c what we're
[3:37:10.240 --> 3:37:19.040]  here to announce is the second cure to a virus of all time well that's i'm a remarkable i mean
[3:37:19.040 --> 3:37:26.560]  of course it's our job to be skeptical of all and any claims however i very much want to believe
[3:37:26.560 --> 3:37:31.520]  this and i think we need obviously immediately to run it down the federal government needs to find
[3:37:31.520 --> 3:37:37.120]  out if this is true because if it's it if it is you know that's the that's the biggest news of this
[3:37:37.120 --> 3:37:42.560]  moment so i'm so grateful that you announced that on the show and i hope we're hearing a lot more
[3:37:42.560 --> 3:37:49.040]  about it very soon thank you so much for coming on thank you please disseminate it to the scientific
[3:37:49.040 --> 3:37:57.120]  community immediately i would hope they'd be on it thank you we're out of time well we so good news
[3:37:57.120 --> 3:38:02.400]  there are potential anti malaria drug that could treat corona virus will continue to track what
[3:38:02.400 --> 3:38:07.280]  happens with that apparently trumps cut a lot of fda red tape to get it approved along with some
[3:38:07.280 --> 3:38:11.840]  other potential treatments we're going back to what we've talked about at the top of the show
[3:38:11.840 --> 3:38:15.840]  the world health organization repeatedly saying you have to be careful how you talk about this
[3:38:15.840 --> 3:38:20.320]  virus you have to be politically correct to not hurt anybody's feelings now that media
[3:38:20.320 --> 3:38:24.960]  obsessing every single day about trump calling it the correct the chinese virus because that's
[3:38:24.960 --> 3:38:31.440]  racist against chinese people they might be offended again hiding the true source and how
[3:38:31.440 --> 3:38:38.720]  this virus spread which was primarily through open borders and we still have a situation here in the
[3:38:38.720 --> 3:38:46.080]  uk where flights from italy even though we're about to go on lockdown according to some sources in
[3:38:46.080 --> 3:38:52.720]  london flights from milan the epicenter of the corona virus epidemic pandemic in italy
[3:38:52.720 --> 3:39:00.320]  are still arriving in the uk even canada even some of these northern european socialist countries
[3:39:00.320 --> 3:39:06.560]  have imposed some level of border control here in the uk under a conservative government no
[3:39:06.560 --> 3:39:13.040]  border controls whatsoever they might lock down major cities in the uk but still keep the borders
[3:39:13.040 --> 3:39:19.200]  open absolutely incredible which brings me to this story headline migrant labor was to blame
[3:39:19.200 --> 3:39:25.760]  for corona virus spread in both iran and italy the use of migrant labor some of it illegal in
[3:39:25.760 --> 3:39:30.720]  both iran and italy played a major role in the spread of corona virus emphasizing once again
[3:39:30.720 --> 3:39:38.640]  how open borders were a vector for the disease the wall street journal reported how iranian
[3:39:38.640 --> 3:39:43.840]  officials traced the origins of the country's corona virus epidemic in the whole city of kom
[3:39:43.840 --> 3:39:50.320]  to a number of chinese backed infrastructure projects built by scores of workers and technicians
[3:39:50.320 --> 3:39:57.440]  from china migrant labor was how it spread in iran of course iran massively here i think they're the
[3:39:57.440 --> 3:40:04.800]  third worst hit country now behind italy and china it was spread from them importing migrant labor no
[3:40:04.800 --> 3:40:10.160]  doubt some of it illegal according to the piece the migrant labor helped iran's economy alive
[3:40:10.800 --> 3:40:16.240]  stay alive in the face of american sanctions it also served as a source for the spread of
[3:40:16.240 --> 3:40:22.800]  a virus that has gone on to infect over 18 000 people in iran killing nearly 1300 hope it was
[3:40:22.800 --> 3:40:29.040]  worth it for the cheap foreign labor then you look at italy illegal immigrants in italy a thought
[3:40:29.040 --> 3:40:34.720]  to have played a major role in the spread of covid 19 as well as the mayor of florans who
[3:40:34.720 --> 3:40:40.320]  back at the start of february was encouraging italians to go out and kiss chinese people in the
[3:40:40.320 --> 3:40:47.520]  street to prove they weren't racist but as the new york times reported even they admitted it
[3:40:47.520 --> 3:40:54.960]  coronavirus was brought to italy by quote two chinese tourists visiting roland they failed to
[3:40:54.960 --> 3:41:01.280]  lock down their borders even as china was suffering from all these deaths all these infections all
[3:41:01.280 --> 3:41:06.960]  this quarantine all this martial law they said they could just keep on coming in two chinese
[3:41:06.960 --> 3:41:14.240]  tourists responsible for the outbreak in italy which has now claimed the lives of over 3000 people
[3:41:14.240 --> 3:41:21.680]  open borders milan was here even harder than rome in terms of covid 19 infections
[3:41:21.680 --> 3:41:25.440]  leaving many to point the finger at chinese immigrants working in the north of the country
[3:41:26.160 --> 3:41:32.640]  and it is a fact that according to reuters chinese migrants were dominant in these northern
[3:41:32.640 --> 3:41:40.240]  italian towns there's one called prato which is italy's textile capital they had 50 000 chinese
[3:41:40.240 --> 3:41:47.520]  workers living in this town of prato near florans working in the textile industry making clothes and
[3:41:47.520 --> 3:41:53.920]  handbags just so they could say made in italy though they were technically made in italy but
[3:41:53.920 --> 3:42:01.760]  they were being made by cheap foreign and often illegal migrant labor from china we had other
[3:42:01.760 --> 3:42:07.200]  reports which show there were a hundred thousand i'm not sure about the numbers on this but given
[3:42:07.200 --> 3:42:14.800]  though a 50 000 near florans others claim there are 100 000 chinese workers from wuhan who were allowed
[3:42:14.800 --> 3:42:21.360]  to fly back and forth from milan and areas around milan back to wuhan just so they could get in this
[3:42:21.360 --> 3:42:28.480]  cheap foreign labor to make their made in italy handbags and clothes so again in each case iran
[3:42:28.480 --> 3:42:34.960]  italy relying on cheap often illegal foreign migrant labor to make products at cheap prices
[3:42:34.960 --> 3:42:42.560]  and that in iran at least and certainly in italy after it started spreading was a major source
[3:42:42.560 --> 3:42:48.320]  of the covid 19 pandemic then spreading across the rest of europe and throughout the rest of the
[3:42:48.320 --> 3:42:53.760]  world once again open borders were a vector for this disease don't go away ladies and gentlemen
[3:42:53.760 --> 3:43:00.880]  alex jones here with a public service announcement info wars as of today is now suspending storeable
[3:43:00.880 --> 3:43:06.480]  food sales we still have storeable food we're able to package all the storeable food and get it to
[3:43:06.480 --> 3:43:10.640]  everybody that ordered it most of you've already gotten your food but the reason i'm making this
[3:43:10.640 --> 3:43:17.280]  announcement is all the other major food suppliers were sold out over a month ago as we first reported
[3:43:17.280 --> 3:43:21.760]  to you but they lied to you and they took your money well we know for the fact they're still
[3:43:21.760 --> 3:43:28.240]  taking everybody's money even though the food has all been sold out the basic ingredients for
[3:43:28.240 --> 3:43:35.040]  storeable food is gone all the big box stores are paying way over normal prices to buy up what's left
[3:43:35.040 --> 3:43:41.440]  and so anybody telling you that they have storeable food is lying to you the good news is everyone
[3:43:41.440 --> 3:43:45.760]  that ordered an info or store dot com has already gotten it or if you ordered recently we have the
[3:43:45.760 --> 3:43:51.120]  food is being packaged and you will get it but as of now we are suspending all new food sales
[3:43:51.120 --> 3:43:59.120]  at infowarstore.com we've all heard of the strike it's a socialist and communist tactic but sometimes
[3:43:59.120 --> 3:44:05.120]  populist movements have used the strike you can have labor strikes you can have people that also
[3:44:05.760 --> 3:44:12.160]  boycott and refuse to use a company or a service and many times when the people actually get together
[3:44:12.160 --> 3:44:18.240]  and move in mass with the strike it has a great effect and some good things have come out of it
[3:44:18.240 --> 3:44:28.320]  but now we are seeing a globalist corporate strike by shutting down key institutions at key times
[3:44:28.320 --> 3:44:34.720]  led by big tech over a month ago to then set the precedent to shut down small companies
[3:44:34.720 --> 3:44:40.800]  and businesses across the world but notice the big globalist corporations and the big box stores
[3:44:40.800 --> 3:44:47.280]  they are all exempt this is more than just martial law training this is the globalist
[3:44:47.280 --> 3:44:52.400]  trying to create a worldwide depression they can blame on trump and they even admit they're doing it
[3:44:53.760 --> 3:44:59.520]  it's all over the news it's being announced by politicians from germany the united states
[3:44:59.520 --> 3:45:06.160]  thank god coronavirus is here thank god it's going to kill the old people think the heavens
[3:45:06.160 --> 3:45:13.360]  that we're going to depopulate the planet because humanity is horrible humanity is evil all the
[3:45:13.360 --> 3:45:20.000]  hollywood movies all the propaganda all the un statements all the ted turner and prince philip
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:25.680]  garbage saying that they want to use a deadly virus to depopulate to control the population
[3:45:25.680 --> 3:45:30.880]  and now it's here and they want to lock down society and are licking their lips and saying
[3:45:30.880 --> 3:45:38.400]  trump isn't doing enough what a sickening in your face declaration of war against humanity
[3:45:38.400 --> 3:45:42.960]  by these control freaks who think it's their right to put fluoride in the water give us toxic
[3:45:42.960 --> 3:45:49.040]  vaccines openly dumb us down and then when we resist call us terrorists and conspiracy theorists
[3:45:49.040 --> 3:45:53.120]  when they're publicly admitting their plan to exterminate everyone it's time to expose the
[3:45:53.120 --> 3:46:00.160]  scum it was like a bad dream seven weeks ago the ghost cities in china that then spread to europe
[3:46:00.160 --> 3:46:06.400]  and now san francisco is a ghost city and we see fights and brawls taking place over toilet paper
[3:46:06.400 --> 3:46:12.160]  people don't need toilet paper to survive but people do need high quality water filtration and
[3:46:12.160 --> 3:46:20.960]  they need high quality supplementation by products like dna force plus x2 and x3 bodies ultimate

[3:48:26.000 --> 3:48:33.120]  at infowarstore.com today finishing up on what i was talking about before the break with the open
[3:48:33.120 --> 3:48:38.480]  borders being a vector for coronavirus spreading around the world of course as i was talking about
[3:48:39.280 --> 3:48:44.640]  the cheap foreign migrant labor they imported into iran for their infrastructure projects
[3:48:44.640 --> 3:48:49.600]  was directly attributed to spreading the coronavirus starting it and spreading it in
[3:48:49.600 --> 3:48:56.960]  iran where they had thousands of deaths in italy in milan in towns around florans they imported
[3:48:56.960 --> 3:49:03.440]  tens of thousands of chinese immigrants often illegally for cheap labor so they could make
[3:49:03.440 --> 3:49:10.000]  clothes and handbags in textile factories in italy just so they could put made in italy
[3:49:10.000 --> 3:49:16.800]  on the label despite the fact that those products were being made by often illegal foreign labor
[3:49:16.800 --> 3:49:23.680]  imported from china with many of those migrants flying back and forth between the epicenter of
[3:49:23.680 --> 3:49:31.040]  the outbreak in china and northern italy now italy is the worst hit country in terms of coronavirus
[3:49:31.040 --> 3:49:36.880]  some kind of connection there i don't know maybe ben harris quinney tweeted this he did a comparison
[3:49:36.880 --> 3:49:47.440]  he said coronavirus in nations with minimal border controls friends 9100 cases italy 35 000 cases
[3:49:47.440 --> 3:49:56.560]  obviously these numbers are even bigger now spain 17100 cases germany 13 000 infections of coronavirus
[3:49:56.560 --> 3:50:04.160]  those are the top european countries worldwide countries with lax open borders compare that
[3:50:04.160 --> 3:50:09.200]  to coronavirus in countries with strong border controls and indeed countries that impose them
[3:50:09.200 --> 3:50:15.680]  from the very start of course with singapore and russia they both closed their borders at the end
[3:50:15.680 --> 3:50:22.000]  of january and only today or yesterday did we have the first coronavirus death in russia
[3:50:22.000 --> 3:50:26.640]  and as far as i know the latest numbers that may have changed today but as of yesterday
[3:50:26.640 --> 3:50:33.360]  zero coronavirus deaths in singapore because they had strong border controls then you look at hungary
[3:50:33.360 --> 3:50:44.080]  73 coronavirus cases holand 325 israel 529 russia just 147 compare that to the number of cases in
[3:50:44.080 --> 3:50:53.920]  those worst hit open border european countries and the uk border remains firmly open it's interesting
[3:50:53.920 --> 3:50:59.280]  with the uk because they're now considering whether to lock down london another major city that
[3:50:59.280 --> 3:51:03.360]  looked like it was going to be announced as of last night but the government came out today and said
[3:51:03.360 --> 3:51:10.960]  that that's not going to happen at least in the short term interesting how our shall we say more
[3:51:10.960 --> 3:51:19.360]  diverse populations in london will react to any kind of mass quarantine order given how more
[3:51:19.360 --> 3:51:24.880]  diverse populations in countries like france and italy have reacted to it already and in that
[3:51:24.880 --> 3:51:30.960]  context we have an article here video migrants in paris refusing to comply with quarantine order
[3:51:31.760 --> 3:51:36.640]  video footage out of paris shows migrants violating the country's quarantine order by
[3:51:36.640 --> 3:51:42.880]  being outside without good reason as they squabble with and shout at police now i say being outside
[3:51:42.880 --> 3:51:47.600]  without good reason because this ties into another article martial law in france citizens have to
[3:51:47.600 --> 3:51:53.120]  fill out a form every time they leave the home every time you leave the house in france they have
[3:51:53.120 --> 3:51:59.920]  100 000 extra police patrolling the streets you have to fill out a form saying why you've left
[3:51:59.920 --> 3:52:06.240]  the house and you have to prove it otherwise you face massive fines and if you do it too many times
[3:52:06.240 --> 3:52:11.920]  potential imprisonment so french citizens having to comply with this what is basically a martial
[3:52:11.920 --> 3:52:19.680]  law quarantine order similar situation in spain where they have drones patrolling beaches shouting
[3:52:19.680 --> 3:52:24.080]  at people to get off the beaches and back into their homes via loudspeakers which are connected
[3:52:24.080 --> 3:52:30.560]  to police radios that's how they're enforcing it the migrant diverse migrant population in
[3:52:31.200 --> 3:52:38.240]  france in italy don't seem to be that keen on following those orders the clip in this article
[3:52:38.240 --> 3:52:43.200]  appears to show a man being arrested and bundled into a police car by officers the group of migrants
[3:52:43.200 --> 3:52:49.280]  then immediately form a crowd around the police officers and begin loudly remonstrating with them
[3:52:49.280 --> 3:52:54.880]  another video shows a woman in france breaking quarantine deliberately by deliberately coughing
[3:52:54.880 --> 3:53:01.520]  on police officers you've probably seen this clip by now and then of course we had a video out of
[3:53:01.520 --> 3:53:07.360]  napal's italy from a couple of days ago which shows migrants roaming around the streets while
[3:53:07.360 --> 3:53:13.520]  the people who are self isolating in their own apartments shout at them from up above telling
[3:53:13.520 --> 3:53:20.080]  them to get back inside they're not too keen on following the orders so we have this article
[3:53:20.880 --> 3:53:26.480]  videos show looting fights at supermarkets in london and paris video footage out of london and
[3:53:26.480 --> 3:53:32.880]  paris shows youths that's how we describe them youths attempting to loot stores and start fights in
[3:53:32.880 --> 3:53:40.320]  response to the coronavirus outbreak last night a sainsbury shop front sainsbury is a big supermarket
[3:53:40.320 --> 3:53:46.400]  in london shows youths youths attempting to smash down the supermarket's doors in an effort to break
[3:53:46.400 --> 3:53:53.280]  in they stole alcohol police said sainsbury staff confronted the men who became hostile and threatening
[3:53:53.280 --> 3:54:00.640]  and fled outside before trashing the storefront four youths were later arrested by police now we
[3:54:00.640 --> 3:54:08.960]  have another video from a branch of little in paris which shows more youths in a very diverse area
[3:54:08.960 --> 3:54:14.960]  fighting with each other with some of them wielding weapons another video in this article
[3:54:14.960 --> 3:54:21.040]  shows shoppers at a supermarket in london wherein by the way all the shelves are completely
[3:54:21.040 --> 3:54:26.000]  stripped they don't even seem to be restocking them at this point screaming at each other and
[3:54:26.000 --> 3:54:33.280]  squabbling as they engage in panic buying another clip from a test go in london features a customer
[3:54:33.280 --> 3:54:41.920]  threatening to bring his friends after the store refuses to allow him to buy bulk water the videos
[3:54:41.920 --> 3:54:48.080]  all appear to have something in common the protagonists seem to be very diverse which
[3:54:48.080 --> 3:54:54.480]  as we all know diversity is a strength maybe not so much of a strength though in germany
[3:54:54.480 --> 3:55:01.920]  where migrants at refugee camp in germany rioted displayed isis flags and threatened to burn down
[3:55:01.920 --> 3:55:07.680]  their refugee facility because they were put under quarantine the migrant tested positive for
[3:55:07.680 --> 3:55:14.000]  coronavirus in saul thuringia which is where this refugee camp is located quarantine was
[3:55:14.000 --> 3:55:19.520]  ordered for the other 533 residents and the camp was sealed off they were not too happy about that
[3:55:19.520 --> 3:55:26.000]  and responded by waving isis flags yes these migrants in refugee camps in germany just happened
[3:55:26.000 --> 3:55:33.360]  to have isis flags on hand that's completely normal so they started waving isis flags
[3:55:33.360 --> 3:55:39.520]  threatening to burn down the facility started rioting started bringing their children to the
[3:55:39.520 --> 3:55:45.440]  front of the gates they had to call in police officers to quell that riot so again the diverse
[3:55:45.440 --> 3:55:52.720]  populations of london and paris and the migrants in the camps in germany not too keen on obeying
[3:55:52.720 --> 3:55:59.440]  these quarantine laws which is probably why i uh i expect it's at least one of the considerations
[3:55:59.440 --> 3:56:04.640]  that's why the prime minister of britain borris johnson has not enforced a complete quarantine
[3:56:04.640 --> 3:56:12.320]  lockdown of london because our diverse populations are not too keen on following those kind of orders
[3:56:12.320 --> 3:56:19.280]  from what we've seen so far meanwhile breitbart reports illegal boat migrants received coronavirus
[3:56:19.280 --> 3:56:27.280]  tests as nhs staff were refused yes these are our new special people not only can they violate
[3:56:27.280 --> 3:56:32.800]  quarantines at will not only can they break into stores and loot them apparently but now they get
[3:56:32.800 --> 3:56:39.440]  coronavirus tests before everyone else dozens of illegal boat migrants have been arriving in england
[3:56:39.440 --> 3:56:45.840]  and receiving coronavirus tests while many health care workers were being refused in line with public
[3:56:45.840 --> 3:56:50.160]  health england guidance border force and all operational staff have the relevant personal
[3:56:50.160 --> 3:56:55.520]  protective equipment available to them as the migrants are taken on board brought to dover
[3:56:55.520 --> 3:57:00.640]  where they received further medical assessment which will include looking for symptoms of
[3:57:00.640 --> 3:57:07.280]  coronavirus and of course many of these migrants are coming directly from france which is one of
[3:57:07.280 --> 3:57:13.360]  the worst hit countries for coronavirus but this special class of people these loving and
[3:57:13.360 --> 3:57:19.680]  diverse migrants who are such a benefit to our country they get coronavirus tests first the old
[3:57:19.680 --> 3:57:26.400]  people self isolating in their homes barely even able to buy groceries sought them sought the health
[3:57:26.400 --> 3:57:31.360]  care workers who are on the front lines of the nhs in the hospitals trying to treat people they get
[3:57:31.360 --> 3:57:36.480]  to the back of the queue the people who come to the front of the queue are these loving diverse
[3:57:36.480 --> 3:57:40.640]  fantastic migrants that have offered such benefits to our society i was going to wrap it up come
[3:57:40.640 --> 3:57:46.320]  on next warren with our insurer summit dot news don't go listen to me very very carefully i am
[3:57:46.320 --> 3:57:53.280]  involved at very high levels with supply chain management and talk to a lot of executives
[3:57:53.280 --> 3:57:58.080]  and they are confirming to me that the supply chain is starting to break down because they're
[3:57:58.080 --> 3:58:03.920]  running out of the raw materials for food and things like high quality supplements that boost

[3:58:53.520 --> 3:58:59.760]  and the panic it's creating is on a scale never before seen it is said in the bible that the
[3:58:59.760 --> 3:59:07.440]  wicked flee when none pursue but the wicked really run for their lives when something real is killing
[3:59:07.440 --> 3:59:15.520]  people silently and quietly ladies and gentlemen it's time to pray it's time to seek god's face
[3:59:16.160 --> 3:59:22.560]  it's time to repent for the 64 million abortions in america and the 400 million abortions
[3:59:22.560 --> 3:59:28.640]  in communist china and for all of the satanism and all of the pedophilia and all of the corruption
[3:59:28.640 --> 3:59:35.920]  or god is going to continue to allow the globalist to judge us for him that's right god is lifting
[3:59:35.920 --> 3:59:42.480]  the hedge of protection away from the people and allowing satan and his armies to have their will
[3:59:42.480 --> 3:59:53.040]  with the people you're listening to the alex jones show
