[00:00:02.492 --> 00:00:14.045]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:20.553]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, it's Alex Jones!
[00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:31.394]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:31.394 --> 00:00:34.896]  Owen Schroer, David Knight filling in for Alex today.
[00:00:34.896 --> 00:00:38.859]  And we have a ton of news for you today.
[00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.961]  Major Red Pill Radio today here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:49.565]  I'm just going to try to get the waterfront here and just so you know what to expect today.
[00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:50.026]  We've got
[00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:56.912]  FBI seizing smashed hard drives from Debbie Wasserman Schultz's home and her IT staff's home.
[00:00:56.912 --> 00:01:04.719]  We've got a Bay Area ISIS supporter being arrested for colluding with ISIS, said he would kill 10,000 people.
[00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:08.062]  You've got President Trump calling out the Amazon Post.
[00:01:08.062 --> 00:01:14.128]  You've got a Newsweek attack on Alex Jones, the latest, claiming he's the one calling for civil war.
[00:01:14.628 --> 00:01:19.051]  You've got the former CIA director calling for a coup against Donald Trump.
[00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:20.471]  No, that's already going on.
[00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:25.674]  John Boehner has just said Republicans will never repeal and replace Obamacare.
[00:01:25.674 --> 00:01:31.598]  I think Rudy Giuliani has decided he does not want Attorney General Jeff Sessions' job.
[00:01:32.278 --> 00:01:33.099]  You made that pretty clear.
[00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.840]  Did he, didn't he?
[00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:52.479]  Confidence in America is up and then we got some video of Trump speaking to Boy Scouts yesterday.
[00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.719]  That was powerful.
[00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:59.121]  We've got the Democrats waging trade war right now with Russian sanctions.
[00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:00.802]  We're gonna have more on Jeff Sessions.
[00:02:00.802 --> 00:02:04.303]  Will he still be the Attorney General by the time we get off air?
[00:02:04.303 --> 00:02:06.324]  More on the coup against Donald Trump.
[00:02:06.824 --> 00:02:15.773]  And we're going to talk about sanctuary cities, and are they safer, are they not, are they leading to more deaths, as well as developments in the Ukraine.
[00:02:15.773 --> 00:02:18.917]  All that, all kinds of clips, going to be a stocked show.
[00:02:18.917 --> 00:02:20.618]  There's the waterfront, David Knight.
[00:02:20.618 --> 00:02:23.641]  Yeah, let's talk about what's going on here with this coup.
[00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:27.686]  Because we know this is something that's been happening for a long time, but now we've got
[00:02:28.226 --> 00:02:39.172]  The ex-CIA director who really needs to be investigated by a real Attorney General for violating the Hatch Act and for other crimes have been pointed out by none other than the FISA Court.
[00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:46.836]  And so we need to have an investigation of what the dark state has been doing in terms of election espionage and that's really what is happening here.
[00:02:46.836 --> 00:02:48.356]  But now they're getting very bold about this.
[00:02:48.356 --> 00:02:50.738]  Now they're openly calling for a coup against Trump.
[00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:55.260]  We also have the Democrats pushing Trump into a corner
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.387]  With all of this Russia narrative, pushing for trade sanctions, and the trade sanctions that they're pushing for have a couple of components here.
[00:03:02.387 --> 00:03:09.234]  This is a no-win situation for Trump if he takes this bait, and there's indications in the White House that they're warming up to this.
[00:03:09.234 --> 00:03:15.681]  The Republicans say, well, you know, we'll give you sanctions against Russia if you give us sanctions against Iran and North Korea.
[00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:23.471]  The problem is the sanctions against Russia are about the natural gas pipeline that Europe depends on.
[00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:26.395]  So now Europe is saying within days we're going to react to this.
[00:03:26.395 --> 00:03:28.658]  This is an internal memo that came out yesterday.
[00:03:28.658 --> 00:03:30.040]  We didn't have time to talk about that yesterday.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.783]  We're going to talk about it today and about developing trends here.
[00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:47.276]  The groundwork for a worldwide trade war, folks, and this is all coming from the Russians using, the Democrats using this Russian triangulation to paint Trump into a corner.
[00:03:47.276 --> 00:03:49.618]  Very important that we understand what's going on here.
[00:03:49.618 --> 00:04:00.528]  Meanwhile, in this Sanctuary City issue, we had this story that was a national story because we had, I think it's now 10 people that died in that truck at Walmart in San Antonio.
[00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:07.251]  The Texas Lieutenant Governor came out and said, this is something that is the responsibility of the sanctuary cities.
[00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:08.851]  And of course, they got very angry about that.
[00:04:08.851 --> 00:04:14.254]  We're going to give you proof as to why the Texas Lieutenant Governor is right.
[00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:17.215]  Why this is something that is the responsibility.
[00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:18.716]  They're contributing to this.
[00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:21.477]  Of course, the direct cause of this, of course, is the drug cartels.
[00:04:22.037 --> 00:04:30.320]  But he's made the point, are you going to pay $5,000 or $10,000 to a drug cartel to smuggle you in, or would you rather pay a couple hundred dollars and come in legally?
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:38.343]  Can we have legal immigration in this country, or are we going to turn ourselves over to the cartels and let them murder people like that?
[00:04:38.343 --> 00:04:42.705]  That's what the sanctuary cities are encouraging, and we'll prove that to you when we come back.
[00:04:42.705 --> 00:04:43.165]  Stay with us.
[00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:50.111]  So we've got all of that, and Trump has appointed a new lawyer to a White House counsel job.
[00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:55.096]  This new lawyer's name is Ty Cobb, and he says he has balls of steel.
[00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:57.297]  That's exactly what Trump needs in a lawyer right now.
[00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.939]  There used to be a baseball player named Ty Cobb, right?
[00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:00.020]  There used to be.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.101]  He had balls of steel too.
[00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:21.981]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:26.285]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:28.247]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:31.550]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:38.156]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[00:05:38.156 --> 00:05:42.901]  What kind of leverage do these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:46.645]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:49.686]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[00:05:49.686 --> 00:05:54.688]  Adams also said, liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:56.008]  Join the InfoWars.

[00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:11.628]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:06:11.628 --> 00:06:24.573]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:06:24.573 --> 00:06:31.136]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:06:31.136 --> 00:06:33.597]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[00:06:33.677 --> 00:06:44.524]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[00:07:06.918 --> 00:07:16.402]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar, a 360 win.

[00:08:02.472 --> 00:08:17.481]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:23.045]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:25.727]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:30.623 --> 00:08:37.129]  All right, so here in America, we're at a turning point tonight with forces now forming an alliance to try and remove President Trump from office.
[00:08:37.129 --> 00:08:38.109]  It's that serious.
[00:08:38.109 --> 00:08:39.691]  This is not a diversionary tactic.
[00:08:39.691 --> 00:08:40.692]  This stuff is real here.
[00:08:40.692 --> 00:08:44.535]  This coup, this silent coup that is taking place is real.
[00:08:44.535 --> 00:08:56.065]  A soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president from office.
[00:08:56.585 --> 00:09:02.812]  Sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind, a clear and present danger.
[00:09:02.812 --> 00:09:11.761]  I got to go into the Congress and spend three hours from 9.30 in the evening to 12.30am with one of the senior ranking members of Congress.
[00:09:12.782 --> 00:09:19.572]  And he told me, and of course this is what I said on CBN but they cut it out, but I'm going to go public with this because we have to.
[00:09:19.572 --> 00:09:23.678]  He said, there is a plot on Capitol Hill to take the President out.
[00:09:23.678 --> 00:09:26.142]  I said, you mean by impeachment or by indictment?
[00:09:26.142 --> 00:09:27.604]  He said, no, to take him out.
[00:09:28.024 --> 00:09:33.308]  This is an effort to subvert the administration of President Donald Trump.
[00:09:33.308 --> 00:09:34.529]  It is nothing less.
[00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:44.398]  It is an effort by the deep state to roll over a duly elected president and a legitimate government and to break the will of the American people.
[00:09:44.398 --> 00:09:45.759]  You can read between the lines.
[00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:48.441]  I said, look, I said, that's not going to happen.
[00:09:48.441 --> 00:09:51.103]  He said, he said, well, really, there's nothing we can do to stop it.
[00:09:51.103 --> 00:09:55.286]  I said, we are going to stop it because we're going to mobilize the body of Christ
[00:09:56.648 --> 00:10:02.374]  And the best description of it is by Barry Kesselman in his blog where he said this is a coup d'etat.
[00:10:02.374 --> 00:10:07.039]  He said 14 million citizens in private ballots picked Donald Trump.
[00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:09.261]  20 TV executives have decided to destroy him.
[00:10:09.261 --> 00:10:14.467]  This is no longer about Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals.
[00:10:15.027 --> 00:10:26.092]  This is about a full-on assault by the left, the Democratic Party, to absolutely carry out a coup d'etat against President Trump.
[00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:27.393]  So let's be very clear.
[00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:31.135]  This is something that the Democrats have been doing since the very beginning.
[00:10:31.135 --> 00:10:33.516]  This is what Project Veritas exposed with...
[00:10:34.156 --> 00:10:39.617]  The inner workings and Aaron Black and these people causing violence on the streets.
[00:10:39.617 --> 00:10:40.477]  This is what they did.
[00:10:40.477 --> 00:10:45.058]  This is why Debbie Washerman Schultz had her hard drive picked up today by the FBI.
[00:10:45.058 --> 00:10:50.180]  This is why Bernie Sanders supporters are suing the DNC right now.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.880]  It's all the same thing.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.681]  It's all because Trump got in the White House and he wasn't supposed to.
[00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:58.981]  So now there's a coup to try to take him out.
[00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:00.722]  You have George Soros funding these protests.
[00:11:01.562 --> 00:11:02.823]  So we have all this evidence.
[00:11:02.823 --> 00:11:04.305]  We know that all this is going on.
[00:11:04.305 --> 00:11:07.348]  Not even talking about all the witch ceremonies that are going on against Trump.
[00:11:07.348 --> 00:11:08.990]  We have all this evidence that's going on.
[00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:10.251]  Everybody knows it now.
[00:11:10.251 --> 00:11:13.735]  Even mainstream conservatives, mainline conservative media.
[00:11:13.735 --> 00:11:17.198]  It's all telling you about the coup against Donald Trump.
[00:11:17.198 --> 00:11:19.180]  But what did John Brennan have to say?
[00:11:20.225 --> 00:11:22.807]  John Brennan stepped out of reality.
[00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:25.568]  Actually, it was Brennan and who else was in that conference?
[00:11:25.568 --> 00:11:26.289]  Do you remember who it was?
[00:11:26.289 --> 00:11:28.290]  It was like Clapper, thank you.
[00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.471]  Some Aspen conference.
[00:11:29.471 --> 00:11:30.291]  They spoke for an hour.
[00:11:30.291 --> 00:11:32.072]  Nothing but propaganda for an hour.
[00:11:32.072 --> 00:11:39.637]  But here's the FBI director, former FBI director, saying that if Trump fires Mueller, there should be a coup against Trump.
[00:11:39.637 --> 00:11:48.062]  But this is where the work of Robert Mueller is critical to our future as a country because I, you know, in some respects we're a government and a nation in crisis right now.
[00:11:49.144 --> 00:11:51.625]  You have confidence in this special counsel?
[00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:52.705]  Absolutely.
[00:11:52.705 --> 00:11:54.065]  He both worked with him for a long time.
[00:11:54.065 --> 00:11:55.045]  A bunch of Clinton lawyers.
[00:11:55.045 --> 00:11:55.486]  Absolutely.
[00:11:55.486 --> 00:11:56.646]  It was an inspired choice.
[00:11:56.646 --> 00:11:57.646]  Clinton donors.
[00:11:57.646 --> 00:11:59.407]  They don't come any better.
[00:11:59.407 --> 00:12:04.228]  Nobody better than Bob Mueller, who is a straight shooter and will not be intimidated.
[00:12:04.228 --> 00:12:05.268]  Just look at these two liars.
[00:12:05.268 --> 00:12:07.509]  Look at their body language.
[00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:08.709]  They can't look anyone in the eye.
[00:12:09.409 --> 00:12:14.472]  I really hope that our members of Congress, our elected representatives, are going to stand up and say, enough is enough.
[00:12:14.472 --> 00:12:21.597]  And stop making apologies and excuses for things that are happening that really have... Meanwhile, the Russian probe conspiracy theory.
[00:12:21.597 --> 00:12:34.606]  When you say enough is enough, if he's fired, he's the President of the United States, he could tell Rosenstein to fire him if he wants, but if he's fired, what would you want Congress to do?
[00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:45.697]  First of all, I think it's the obligation of some executive branch officials to refuse to carry out some of these orders that, again, are inconsistent with what this country is all about.
[00:12:45.697 --> 00:12:51.260]  But I would just hope that this is not going to be a partisan issue.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.783]  That Republicans and Democrats are going to see that the future of this country is at stake, and there needs to be some things done for the good of the future.
[00:12:59.783 --> 00:13:04.344]  So John Brennan thinks he's above the American people, that's all that is, that arrogant punk.
[00:13:04.344 --> 00:13:09.766]  And the truth of the matter is, David, what I think they're trying to do here is the same tactic that they did with this whole Russia thing.
[00:13:09.766 --> 00:13:13.527]  They're trying to get out ahead of him firing Mueller, because Mueller should have been fired months ago.
[00:13:13.527 --> 00:13:15.468]  This guy, what is he even doing?
[00:13:15.468 --> 00:13:16.148]  What is he even doing?
[00:13:16.148 --> 00:13:17.128]  Nobody even knows what he's doing.
[00:13:17.128 --> 00:13:17.988]  He's getting paid.
[00:13:17.988 --> 00:13:19.869]  He's got all these Clinton lawyers working for him.
[00:13:20.009 --> 00:13:23.310]  He's got an army of lawyers, they've been working on this stuff now for about a year.
[00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:39.136]  When I look at that interview, I gotta say, the thing that bothers me so much, the thing that sticks out to me, is that we've got the former director of the CIA, and the director of national intelligence, and all this, holding press conferences, essentially, with... With Wolf Blitzer!
[00:13:39.136 --> 00:13:41.737]  I've never seen... Who cried when Hillary lost!
[00:13:42.017 --> 00:13:51.630]  Who has ever seen our intelligence officials this actively involved, and not only after the election, but really before the election.
[00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.052]  And that's what needs to be investigated.
[00:13:53.052 --> 00:13:57.197]  The Hatch Act, involvement of these individuals in supporting Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:57.197 --> 00:13:59.160]  You know, when Megyn Kelly was here.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.581]  After the interview, she said to me, she said, well, did you see the Putin interview?
[00:14:03.581 --> 00:14:05.921]  I said, I'm not worried about Putin.
[00:14:05.921 --> 00:14:09.962]  I'm worried about Brennan and Clapper and Michael Hayden and these people.
[00:14:09.962 --> 00:14:14.503]  I said, I'm worried about the American spies who are manipulating our election.
[00:14:14.503 --> 00:14:17.904]  I call it election espionage, because that's really what we had happening here.
[00:14:17.904 --> 00:14:21.045]  You understand that we go back to the DNC, right?
[00:14:21.045 --> 00:14:22.725]  It was the crimes of Hillary.
[00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:35.289]  And those that were allied with her within the DNC against Bernie Sanders that were exposed, and then to keep people from looking at those crimes, they created this fake narrative about Russian hacking.
[00:14:35.289 --> 00:14:39.731]  They were the ones, later on, then, that started saying, well, the Russians hacked our election.
[00:14:39.731 --> 00:14:47.074]  They would always come back, and these same individuals would say, we're not alleging that any votes were switched in machines.
[00:14:47.074 --> 00:14:49.255]  We're not saying that that kind of hacking went on.
[00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:51.836]  What we're saying is that they manipulated public opinion.
[00:14:51.836 --> 00:14:52.216]  Oh, really?
[00:14:52.816 --> 00:15:03.084]  Didn't the CIA, the NSA, the Director of National Intelligence, weren't they manipulating public opinion along with the press and the Democrats to manipulate and to hack our election?
[00:15:03.084 --> 00:15:05.285]  That's the reality, and yet they do the same thing.
[00:15:05.285 --> 00:15:08.448]  To cover their crimes, they switch it to a foreign country.
[00:15:09.188 --> 00:15:14.370]  And Julian Assange has told us it wasn't a foreign source that gave us that information about the DNC.
[00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.551]  And we have numerous evidence about that.
[00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:30.117]  We have testimony from a former UK ambassador who said, I came to the United States, I was handed this by a whistleblower who was a Bernie supporter, who was upset about the corruption in the Democrat Party and how they hacked the election against Bernie Sanders.
[00:15:30.117 --> 00:15:35.699]  They did the same thing, except it expanded and included our intelligence services.
[00:15:35.699 --> 00:15:38.180]  And you have to understand how dangerous this is.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:45.343]  When we have this massive dark state that has been created, that is now openly politicized.
[00:15:45.343 --> 00:15:51.366]  I have never in my life seen the directors of these intelligence agencies testifying.
[00:15:51.366 --> 00:15:53.548]  It was a big deal when they had the
[00:15:54.645 --> 00:15:56.687]  Frank Church hearings in the 1970s.
[00:15:56.687 --> 00:15:56.987]  Why?
[00:15:56.987 --> 00:15:59.690]  Because they were spying on the American people.
[00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.112]  So they called up the director of the CIA.
[00:16:02.112 --> 00:16:05.575]  The CIA was furious about that because he exposed their secrets.
[00:16:05.575 --> 00:16:15.564]  But you never saw these people testifying in public, let alone holding continual press conferences with the press that they're allied with, the Democrat press that they're allied.
[00:16:15.564 --> 00:16:16.966]  This is absolutely unprecedented.
[00:16:17.466 --> 00:16:20.148]  Most of you probably don't know who these people were.
[00:16:20.148 --> 00:16:26.373]  And in the past, before Snowden, NSA, everybody would joke, stood for no such agency.
[00:16:26.373 --> 00:16:36.080]  At the time that we had the Frank Church hearings, the House was also holding hearings on the CIA and the NSA spying on Americans illegally.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.484]  What was born out of that was the FISA Act, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[00:16:41.304 --> 00:16:53.514]  And it was that court now who has told us that these agencies violated the law to spy on the Trump administration officials and to also violate the Constitution, as if that made any difference anymore.
[00:16:53.514 --> 00:17:00.799]  But they also violated the prohibitions exposing these people, as we know Obama officials were involved in.
[00:17:00.799 --> 00:17:06.084]  But at the time of the Pike hearings in the House, going concurrently with the church hearings,
[00:17:06.724 --> 00:17:15.586]  When the NSA official came to the Pike hearings, he said, the guy who was running it, Pike, said, I'd like to see your documents that created the NSA.
[00:17:15.586 --> 00:17:19.067]  They were created by an executive order by President Truman.
[00:17:19.067 --> 00:17:22.108]  And the head of the NSA said, I'm not going to show them to you.
[00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:24.849]  That's how closely held they were.
[00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:26.089]  That's how secret they were.
[00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:28.470]  That's how behind the scenes they were.
[00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.050]  Now, they're out in public.
[00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.850]  They're talking about coups.
[00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.691]  They're talking about politics.
[00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:35.084]  I think?
[00:17:55.993 --> 00:17:58.254]  James Clapper is the head of that.
[00:17:58.254 --> 00:17:59.334]  He has been running that.
[00:17:59.334 --> 00:18:02.356]  That is the fastest growing part of the intelligence service.
[00:18:02.356 --> 00:18:04.877]  That is how they're going to control you in every aspect.
[00:18:04.877 --> 00:18:10.479]  But they're controlling you now with the political narrative going on shows like CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
[00:18:10.479 --> 00:18:14.981]  That's what absolutely amazes me is how politicized openly these people are.
[00:18:14.981 --> 00:18:17.062]  So you've got all of this evidence.
[00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:18.202]  This is what Trump needs to do.
[00:18:18.202 --> 00:18:19.423]  Trump needs to do what he did.
[00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:27.689]  With, I forget what it was, I think it was the process it took just to get a highway or something, a road paved, and he put all the stacks of documents.
[00:18:27.689 --> 00:18:45.223]  He needs to stack the documents of all the evidence with the Clinton campaign, Wasserman Schultz, all the evidence about them colluding, them breaking the law, literally probably break a folding table, and then put the evidence next to that of him colluding with Russia, Kushner colluding with Russia, his son colluding with Russia, and all that, just to compare it.
[00:18:46.784 --> 00:18:48.845]  We're going to get to this clip when we get back.
[00:18:48.845 --> 00:18:53.689]  Representative Gutierrez now has called on Democrats to eliminate Trump.
[00:18:53.689 --> 00:18:55.610]  We're going to get to that clip when we get back.
[00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.991]  But we're also going to get to this today.
[00:18:57.991 --> 00:19:02.774]  Exclusive FBIC smash hard drive from Washerman Schultz ITA's home.
[00:19:02.774 --> 00:19:06.437]  This report should open the eyes of everyone.
[00:19:07.415 --> 00:19:12.577]  This report should show everyone who voted for Hillary Clinton who you really voted for.
[00:19:12.577 --> 00:19:14.738]  Why are they trying to hide this stuff?
[00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:17.378]  Who smashes hard drives?
[00:19:17.378 --> 00:19:18.779]  And it wasn't just her!
[00:19:18.779 --> 00:19:20.439]  It was her IT staff!
[00:19:20.439 --> 00:19:22.820]  And guess what's about to get blown out?
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.481]  The Awan Brothers, folks.
[00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:24.681]  Yeah.
[00:19:24.941 --> 00:19:37.733]  This is going to blow the story of the Yuan brothers out of the water, and everybody who's sitting there crying over Trump is going to look like a complete fool when the final analysis of this case is revealed.
[00:19:37.733 --> 00:19:41.076]  It's going to be an amazing case of either corruption or incompetence.
[00:19:41.076 --> 00:19:42.577]  I think we're going to find it's corruption.
[00:19:42.577 --> 00:19:44.679]  Oh, we're going to find it's corruption, David.
[00:19:44.679 --> 00:19:50.104]  But the incompetence, even if they try to defend themselves, the incompetence is indefensible, even if they say they're not corrupt.
[00:19:50.104 --> 00:19:50.685]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:50.885 --> 00:19:51.446]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:51.446 --> 00:19:53.049]  Alex Jones Show, Owen Troyer, David Knight.
[00:19:53.049 --> 00:19:53.770]  More on the other side.
[00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:54.271]  More clips.
[00:19:54.271 --> 00:19:55.434]  They're calling for a coup against Trump.

[00:21:10.682 --> 00:21:13.523]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:15.504]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.

[00:21:23.848 --> 00:21:28.950]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:32.292]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns
[00:21:32.452 --> 00:21:35.794]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:38.757]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:42.439]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.

[00:22:23.973 --> 00:22:28.496]  But you can have tax-free access to use your life insurance while you're alive.

[00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.071]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:24:28.071 --> 00:24:29.832]  I'm David Knight along with Owen Shorter.
[00:24:29.832 --> 00:24:33.313]  We're going to be joined in the fourth hour by Roger Stone.
[00:24:33.313 --> 00:24:37.595]  He's going to be talking to us, I'm sure, about what's going on in Washington.
[00:24:37.595 --> 00:24:42.678]  His longtime partner, Paul Manafort, they're pushing to have him testify in Congress.
[00:24:42.678 --> 00:24:45.259]  So I'm sure that Roger Stone is going to have something to say about that.
[00:24:45.259 --> 00:24:49.441]  And of course, at the center of that, what they're going to be talking to him about is Ukraine.
[00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:53.764]  And in the next hour, let's see, it's going to be, actually in our third hour, right?
[00:24:53.764 --> 00:25:01.070]  We're going to have Lee Stranahan coming on, talking to us, hit the check on the time, but anyway, Lee Stranahan's going to be coming up in the show.
[00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.650]  Next hour.
[00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:02.251]  Next hour.
[00:25:02.251 --> 00:25:10.917]  Next hour, we're going to have Lee Stranahan, and he is going to break down for us what the press is telling us there's no evidence of.
[00:25:10.917 --> 00:25:12.178]  Check out this headline here.
[00:25:12.178 --> 00:25:13.739]  This is from Reuters.
[00:25:13.739 --> 00:25:15.881]  Says, Trump without evidence.
[00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:19.144]  Cites Ukraine ties to ex-rival Clinton.
[00:25:19.784 --> 00:25:21.245]  With no evidence, really?
[00:25:21.245 --> 00:25:29.350]  Well, there may be no evidence that Reuters has printed, but there has been a lot of discussion about this going all the way back to January.
[00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.851]  Politico had a story there, and it has been there.
[00:25:31.851 --> 00:25:36.614]  It's just not reported by the mainstream media, so they pretend that it doesn't exist.
[00:25:36.614 --> 00:25:45.359]  We're going to break down those connections for you with Lee Stranahan coming up in the next hour, and as I point out, I'm sure that Roger Stone is going to have a great deal to say about that as well.
[00:25:45.359 --> 00:25:48.461]  Now, we're talking about the cover-up, the Deep State cover-up.
[00:25:49.358 --> 00:26:07.111]  And now the open coup that is being talked about by former CIA director saying, and this was on a program with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, we played the clip for you in the last segment, but he said, I think it's the obligation of some executive branch officials to refuse to carry out the order
[00:26:07.831 --> 00:26:18.200]  If the White House were to fire Robert Mueller, and as Zero Hedge points out, that is effectively calling for a coup against the President.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:29.749]  He has the authority to shut down and fire the special prosecutor, especially when they have been going for a year with this investigation, with an army of investigators, and they haven't found anything.
[00:26:29.749 --> 00:26:36.394]  Especially when you've got a special prosecutor whose law firm gave over 90%, I don't know, I can't recall.
[00:26:37.435 --> 00:26:41.757]  It was 90 some odd percent that they gave to Hillary Clinton and to Democrats.
[00:26:41.757 --> 00:26:45.318]  This guy is heavily involved, heavily politicized.
[00:26:45.318 --> 00:26:47.559]  This is not a neutral investigation.
[00:26:47.559 --> 00:26:59.204]  And of course, at the same time, we don't have any investigation into what's going on with Hillary or the DNC or other ancillary issues like the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe.
[00:26:59.204 --> 00:27:04.346]  None of this is being investigated by Trump's Attorney General, Jeff Sessions.
[00:27:04.346 --> 00:27:06.527]  Jeff Sessions has an obsession
[00:27:07.347 --> 00:27:08.708]  With marijuana!
[00:27:08.708 --> 00:27:12.050]  And so now he's gearing up for a crackdown on marijuana.
[00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:15.132]  He just hasn't gotten the message.
[00:27:15.132 --> 00:27:24.497]  And he's off on another tangent, jousting at windmills, trying to stop people from taking drugs.
[00:27:24.497 --> 00:27:31.682]  And of course we have, in the United States, we have the legalization of recreational marijuana in eight states in the District of Columbia.
[00:27:31.682 --> 00:27:35.544]  We have 21 states that allow it for medical use.
[00:27:35.544 --> 00:27:36.325]  But Jeff Sessions,
[00:27:37.265 --> 00:27:49.470]  He's obsessed with not only pot, but he's obsessed with funding police departments with stolen property that they've never even charged anybody with a crime for, let alone found them guilty.
[00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.351]  It's called civil asset forfeiture.
[00:27:51.351 --> 00:27:58.153]  He wants to expand that because there's been so much abuse of that that we've had 24 states enact reform.
[00:27:58.153 --> 00:28:06.397]  So Jeff Sessions has come up with an idea that the federal government will seize the money and then kick it back, 80% of it, back to local law enforcement.
[00:28:06.997 --> 00:28:09.758]  to get around the reform at the state level.
[00:28:09.758 --> 00:28:13.320]  He has absolutely no respect for states' rights.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:20.424]  And so he's violating the 4th Amendment, the 5th Amendment, the 6th Amendment, with drug prohibition, with spying on people, with civil asset forfeiture.
[00:28:20.424 --> 00:28:22.925]  Now he wants to violate the 9th and 10th Amendment.
[00:28:22.925 --> 00:28:30.289]  So that's half of the Bill of Rights right there for you, for somebody who is our Attorney General, the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the country.
[00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:33.211]  So for that reason alone, I would support him being removed.
[00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:38.877]  But he is definitely, his task force doesn't have the right goals, the right priorities.
[00:28:38.877 --> 00:28:42.460]  It's very clear, and Donald Trump has been tweeting about it quite a bit lately.
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.703]  So we expect to see some kind of announcement on that today, don't we, Owen?
[00:28:45.703 --> 00:28:55.331]  Well, I think that it's obvious now that Trump is unhappy that there's been inaction from Sessions into the Clinton investigation, into the Clinton emails.
[00:28:56.332 --> 00:29:05.242]  And as Scaramucci said, as soon as these things go public, it usually doesn't mean good news for the guy on the other side of Trump.
[00:29:05.242 --> 00:29:07.524]  And now it was rumored that Giuliani might be the new one.
[00:29:07.524 --> 00:29:11.308]  Giuliani says Jeff Sessions made the right decision to recuse from Russian probe.
[00:29:11.308 --> 00:29:14.351]  To me, that's Giuliana saying, Trump, please do not give me this job.
[00:29:15.012 --> 00:29:16.633]  I think that's exactly what that means.
[00:29:16.633 --> 00:29:23.015]  And just to be clear, again, on the CIA, former CIA director saying that there needs to be a coup against Trump, the coup has already happened.
[00:29:23.015 --> 00:29:24.435]  Look at the circuit courts.
[00:29:24.435 --> 00:29:28.157]  Look at the fact that the Republicans wouldn't repeal Obamacare.
[00:29:28.157 --> 00:29:29.177]  And here's the thing too, David.
[00:29:29.177 --> 00:29:32.318]  The news is that they're just coming out with it, openly admitting it.
[00:29:32.318 --> 00:29:37.880]  We can't be confused and say, oh yes, it was just those three women that didn't want it.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.861]  No, the Republicans colluded to make Trump look bad.
[00:29:40.861 --> 00:29:42.342]  None of the Republicans wanted the repeal.
[00:29:42.762 --> 00:29:47.065]  Meanwhile, our crushed drives in the DNC by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[00:29:47.065 --> 00:29:49.127]  Is that obstruction of justice?
[00:29:49.127 --> 00:29:50.949]  Hmm, I would think so.
[00:29:50.949 --> 00:29:54.812]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:54.812 --> 00:29:56.213]  We're on the march.
[00:29:56.213 --> 00:29:58.835]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:58.835 --> 00:30:01.517]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:06.795 --> 00:30:08.917]  December 23rd, 1776.
[00:30:08.917 --> 00:30:12.261]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[00:30:12.261 --> 00:30:17.266]  The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.
[00:30:17.266 --> 00:30:22.071]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[00:30:22.071 --> 00:30:24.694]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[00:30:24.694 --> 00:30:26.436]  Yet we have this consolation with us.
[00:30:26.676 --> 00:30:29.680]  That the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.724]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[00:30:32.724 --> 00:30:35.688]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[00:30:35.688 --> 00:30:38.812]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods.
[00:30:38.812 --> 00:30:44.419]  And it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[00:30:44.419 --> 00:30:44.720]  Britain.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:52.769]  With an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right, not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[00:30:52.769 --> 00:30:58.034]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[00:30:58.034 --> 00:31:03.921]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[00:31:03.921 --> 00:31:05.923]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[00:31:06.983 --> 00:31:15.728]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[00:31:15.728 --> 00:31:16.248]  That's right.
[00:31:16.248 --> 00:31:21.511]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers.

[00:31:28.174 --> 00:31:35.776]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[00:31:35.776 --> 00:31:36.016]  Woo!
[00:31:36.016 --> 00:31:37.057]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:31:37.057 --> 00:31:45.779]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:31:45.779 --> 00:31:53.742]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:31:55.362 --> 00:31:58.803]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[00:31:58.803 --> 00:32:02.925]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[00:32:02.925 --> 00:32:04.005]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:04.005 --> 00:32:06.946]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:06.946 --> 00:32:13.469]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[00:32:13.469 --> 00:32:18.491]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ.
[00:32:18.891 --> 00:32:26.439]  And how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[00:32:26.439 --> 00:32:30.102]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[00:32:30.102 --> 00:32:36.769]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[00:32:37.069 --> 00:32:49.935]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[00:32:49.935 --> 00:32:51.796]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:32:51.796 --> 00:32:58.179]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[00:33:21.486 --> 00:33:24.787]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:29.508 --> 00:33:30.989]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:30.989 --> 00:33:36.754]  Owen Schroer, David Knight, filling in for you here in the war for the future, the war for America.
[00:33:36.754 --> 00:33:44.741]  And we have bombshell, huge breaking news at 2 o'clock central here with Roger Stone.
[00:33:44.741 --> 00:33:48.605]  Roger Stone is going to be joining us here on the Alex Jones Show at 2 o'clock central.
[00:33:49.085 --> 00:33:54.049]  For gang-busting news coming out of D.C., coming out of the White House.

[00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:05.357]  And we've got some big breaking news on the Debbie Washerman Schultz
[00:34:05.997 --> 00:34:08.139]  Um, computer hard drives being smashed.
[00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:13.664]  But before we get to that, I got to let you know about some of the specials going on at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:34:13.664 --> 00:34:16.306]  This is the last week of July.

[00:35:27.572 --> 00:35:29.013]  These are huge deals.
[00:35:29.013 --> 00:35:32.957]  Be sure to take advantage of some of our biggest specials ever at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:35:34.057 --> 00:35:37.558]  So you've got the deep state calling for a coup against Trump.
[00:35:37.558 --> 00:35:41.739]  The deep state has shown itself, shown its ugly head.
[00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:44.740]  You've got the former CIA director calling for a coup against Trump.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.201]  We've seen the coup within the Republicans.
[00:35:47.201 --> 00:35:50.342]  We've seen the coup within the liberal circuit courts.
[00:35:52.281 --> 00:35:57.502]  And let me add too, because it was also Clapper sitting there nodding his head along with CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
[00:35:57.502 --> 00:36:07.204]  And it was Clapper's DNI who supported the contention that was put out there in an October debate by Hillary Clinton that all 17 agencies agreed that the Russians had hacked our elections.
[00:36:07.204 --> 00:36:12.645]  And then we had retraction from the New York Times and from Reuters who came out and said, no, it actually wasn't.
[00:36:12.645 --> 00:36:15.446]  One of them said it was four, one of them said it was three.
[00:36:15.446 --> 00:36:17.046]  Where did they come up with those numbers?
[00:36:17.046 --> 00:36:19.267]  Because, you know, they're just throwing these numbers out?
[00:36:20.484 --> 00:36:33.656]  It was the NSA, the CIA, and the FBI that had a panel that came in and were presented by James Clapper with a report that came from CrowdStrike.
[00:36:33.656 --> 00:36:36.518]  A DNC contractor said, the Russians hacked us.
[00:36:37.338 --> 00:36:43.203]  And they were never allowed to look at these servers, servers which have been smashed by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[00:36:43.203 --> 00:36:45.004]  They refused to turn this over to the FBI.
[00:36:45.004 --> 00:36:47.106]  So the FBI didn't do an investigation.
[00:36:47.106 --> 00:36:49.808]  The CIA and the NSA didn't do an investigation.
[00:36:49.808 --> 00:36:58.896]  Instead, they took a report from a DNC contractor, was presented to this hand-picked panel of representatives from these three agencies.
[00:36:58.896 --> 00:37:00.977]  And, of course, they're not going to go against the DNI.
[00:37:01.878 --> 00:37:04.960]  They're going to agree, and that's what we heard in testimony in May.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.222]  We had Clapper come out and say, well, nobody objected to this.
[00:37:08.222 --> 00:37:12.345]  And so I presented this as head of all 17 agencies.
[00:37:12.345 --> 00:37:17.929]  So that means everybody, including the Coast Guard, agreed that the Russians hacked our election.
[00:37:17.929 --> 00:37:22.092]  That's the level of lies that we're seeing from these people and the level of collusion
[00:37:22.572 --> 00:37:34.797]  With the Democrats that our intelligence services and the leaders of the intelligence services were engaged in, and now they're engaged in political activity openly calling for a coup against Donald Trump.
[00:37:34.797 --> 00:37:46.783]  So you've got the political coup from the deep state, then you've got liberal media calling for violence, Hollywood calling for violence against Trump, New York public theater pretending to assassinate Trump, Snoop Dogg pretending to assassinate Trump.
[00:37:47.643 --> 00:37:56.005]  And then yesterday you had the breaking news of a pastor saying he met with a high-level congressman who said that there is a plan to take Trump out.
[00:37:56.005 --> 00:37:59.206]  It will be sudden and you can't stop it.
[00:37:59.206 --> 00:38:01.227]  Read between the lines, the pastor said.
[00:38:01.227 --> 00:38:10.570]  Then, you have Representative Gutierrez, a Democrat, now saying that we have to eliminate Trump.
[00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:13.190]  These people are completely unhinged.
[00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.431]  Here's a clip of Representative Gutierrez.
[00:38:15.981 --> 00:38:37.852]  Because I will not allow Donald Trump and all of his cronies that he surrounds himself with from Wall Street at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to determine the future of 1.2 million people and millions of other undocumented workers in this country.
[00:38:37.852 --> 00:38:39.993]  I am clear, the DREAMers are not criminals!
[00:38:44.352 --> 00:38:46.954]  Those who have TPS are not criminals!
[00:38:46.954 --> 00:38:56.263]  There are millions of undocumented workers that work every day, sweat and toil at some of the most miserable jobs in the United States of America, are not criminals!
[00:38:57.401 --> 00:39:01.567]  We are going to determine, and history is going to determine who those criminals are.
[00:39:01.567 --> 00:39:07.434]  And for me, the major criminal that exists in the United States of America is called Donald Trump.
[00:39:07.434 --> 00:39:09.837]  He lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[00:39:09.837 --> 00:39:14.443]  So we finally have a real president, we finally have a legitimate president, and this guy calls him a criminal.
[00:39:16.165 --> 00:39:34.031]  And we're going to take action tomorrow, and there will soon be a majority in the House of Representatives, and I'm going to make sure that I'm there to make sure of one thing, that we write those articles of impeachment and take them to trial before the Senate and eliminate him as President of the United States of America!
[00:39:35.043 --> 00:39:38.905]  Let me tell you, they actually will do that if they get a majority in the House.
[00:39:38.905 --> 00:39:39.265]  They won't go.
[00:39:39.265 --> 00:39:46.510]  Because it is the House that writes the articles of impeachment, and they are not averse to just making up charges, as we have seen.
[00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:52.173]  And when he talks about, I'm not going to let Donald Trump come after 1.2 million people, Owen.
[00:39:52.173 --> 00:40:04.020]  You know, what we have to understand is that the Mexican government's been widely reported, the Mexican government is helping people who are here illegally to avoid detection, to violate our laws.
[00:40:05.051 --> 00:40:11.696]  They're using America as a pressure relief valve because they don't want to pay for the education of their children.
[00:40:11.696 --> 00:40:14.098]  They send them to us and give us a tax bill.
[00:40:14.098 --> 00:40:15.740]  Well, we have a dream, too.
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.961]  The American dream was to be able to own a home.
[00:40:17.961 --> 00:40:22.825]  And if you've got exploding property tax bills like we do here in Texas, and I'm sure you do,
[00:40:23.726 --> 00:40:32.652]  You can understand that a large amount of that is due to the uncontrolled immigration of people that we then have to pay for their education.
[00:40:32.652 --> 00:40:36.454]  People who get preferential education even to American citizens.
[00:40:36.454 --> 00:40:42.318]  People who have lived here and worked here all of their life are not allowed to get in-state tuition in any state.
[00:40:42.318 --> 00:40:45.260]  And yet illegals are allowed to do that.
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.181]  And so that's a key thing.
[00:40:46.181 --> 00:40:50.224]  And I think at this point we need to talk about what happened with this trailer, Owen.
[00:40:51.144 --> 00:40:59.831]  Over the weekend we had the tragedy of, I don't know, nine or ten people, I don't know what the current death toll is now, people who died in the back of the trailer.
[00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:01.232]  I'm sure that everyone has heard of that.
[00:41:01.232 --> 00:41:10.119]  They were being smuggled in, they weren't given any air conditioning, even any air to breathe, because they turned themselves over to criminals who brought them in.
[00:41:10.119 --> 00:41:14.222]  And we had the Texas attorney, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick,
[00:41:14.662 --> 00:41:21.927]  Immediately came out and he called it, he says, a tragedy, but he said, this is why we passed the bill to ban sanctuary cities.
[00:41:21.927 --> 00:41:29.113]  Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said sanctuary cities entice people to believe they can come to America and Texas and live outside of the law.
[00:41:29.113 --> 00:41:33.276]  Sanctuary cities also enable human smugglers and cartels.
[00:41:34.016 --> 00:41:43.504]  Today, these people paid a terrible price, and they demonstrate why we need a secure border and legal immigration reform so that we can control those who enter our country.
[00:41:43.504 --> 00:41:46.327]  We continue to pray for the families and the friends of the victims.
[00:41:46.327 --> 00:41:52.032]  And he also pointed out, he said, they're paying somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 to these cartels to smuggle them in.
[00:41:52.032 --> 00:41:55.915]  He said, wouldn't it be better if they paid a couple hundred dollars to the American government?
[00:41:55.915 --> 00:41:59.919]  We had immigration, legal immigration reform, and they could come in legally.
[00:42:00.379 --> 00:42:06.143]  Well, we have a state representative here in Austin, Eddie Rodriguez, was furious about that.
[00:42:06.143 --> 00:42:23.014]  He said, I hope Lieutenant Governor Patrick puts people first in his future public statements because when 10 people from any background parish, I guess it is now 10, under such horrific circumstances, it's an occasion deserving of solemnity and respect, not self-indulgent cheerleading.
[00:42:23.014 --> 00:42:23.675]  Well, the question is,
[00:42:24.537 --> 00:42:28.018]  Do the sanctuary cities cause these deaths?
[00:42:28.018 --> 00:42:31.760]  Or do our immigration policies cause the deaths?
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.840]  That's a good question.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.541]  And we have proof that it's the sanctuary cities.
[00:42:35.541 --> 00:42:41.544]  We have reported multiple times about how illegal immigration is down 67% under Donald Trump.
[00:42:41.544 --> 00:42:42.124]  What changed?
[00:42:43.024 --> 00:42:45.266]  It was the policies that changed.
[00:42:45.266 --> 00:42:46.687]  They haven't built a wall.
[00:42:46.687 --> 00:42:49.849]  They haven't had time to hire more immigration officials.
[00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:59.055]  It was simply the expectation that people were not going to be allowed to come here and thumb their noses at the law and to get a free education, etc.
[00:42:59.055 --> 00:43:00.116]  That was what changed.
[00:43:00.116 --> 00:43:02.557]  The fact that they were going to be deported.
[00:43:02.557 --> 00:43:07.360]  We saw a massive increase in immigration when Obama encouraged that.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.262]  And we saw a massive decrease, 67%.
[00:43:09.262 --> 00:43:12.484]  Border Patrol Chief David Aguilar said,
[00:43:13.344 --> 00:43:17.346]  This administration has said we're going to address illegal immigration.
[00:43:17.346 --> 00:43:23.068]  ICE has started working in the interior, unlike other times, so that message resonates.
[00:43:23.068 --> 00:43:24.409]  They understand what's going on.
[00:43:24.409 --> 00:43:33.552]  And the Border Patrol Union chief said the significant downturn in the number of illegal border crossers between US and Mexico is nothing short of miraculous.
[00:43:33.552 --> 00:43:34.653]  He said that on C-SPAN.
[00:43:35.533 --> 00:43:44.699]  Weeks ago, he said Customs and Border Protection reported 53% decrease in the number of apprehensions at the border compared to last year.
[00:43:44.699 --> 00:43:45.780]  What changed?
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:47.721]  Simply the policies.
[00:43:47.721 --> 00:43:49.602]  So the Lieutenant Governor is correct.
[00:43:49.602 --> 00:43:53.985]  When you tell people, come on in, we're going to give you free everything.
[00:43:53.985 --> 00:43:57.747]  We're going to give you preferential treatment even over American citizens.
[00:43:57.747 --> 00:44:01.450]  When you tell people that, the border crossings are going to increase.
[00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.471]  And that's exactly what we see happening.
[00:44:04.471 --> 00:44:07.313]  And so, the Lieutenant Governor is right.
[00:44:07.313 --> 00:44:13.237]  We can stop this if we tell people we're going to enforce the law, we're going to have legal immigration, and we're going to control who comes in.
[00:44:13.237 --> 00:44:23.403]  And that includes the cartel members and the MS-13 gangs who are not going to be allowed to follow these people in and destroy their lives in America as they're doing on Long Island.
[00:44:24.318 --> 00:44:25.579]  And other places.
[00:44:25.579 --> 00:44:27.481]  They started out in LA.
[00:44:27.481 --> 00:44:30.003]  And now they have spread throughout the United States.
[00:44:30.003 --> 00:44:34.967]  And it is Hispanic people who have come here illegally trying to escape that kind of environment.
[00:44:34.967 --> 00:44:41.812]  But if the borders are wide open, MS-13 and the other cartel members are going to come in and they're going to get entrenched in our country.
[00:44:41.812 --> 00:44:48.198]  And we're not going to allow that level of violence, which is really far worse even than what's going on in Afghanistan now.
[00:44:49.139 --> 00:44:56.421]  What's happening in Mexico, because of the drug war, because of other issues, we're not going to allow that kind of violence to happen here in America.
[00:44:56.421 --> 00:44:58.361]  We're going to control the borders.
[00:44:58.361 --> 00:45:08.983]  Well, and Jeff Sessions, I think, was the right Attorney General to get the momentum going in that direction, to get border enforcement encouraged, and to start enforcing that law.
[00:45:08.983 --> 00:45:15.125]  Now Sessions, you know, that's kind of taking care of itself, and Sessions isn't really moving in the right direction, I think.
[00:45:15.785 --> 00:45:18.966]  That's something that he shared with Donald Trump.
[00:45:18.966 --> 00:45:21.567]  Jeff Sessions was an early supporter of Donald Trump.
[00:45:21.567 --> 00:45:22.948]  He bucked the establishment.
[00:45:22.948 --> 00:45:32.432]  He showed a lot of backbone and spine to be the only person and the earliest person in Washington to back Donald Trump in the very early days.
[00:45:32.432 --> 00:45:35.713]  And he did it on the issues, Owen, that you just pointed out.
[00:45:35.713 --> 00:45:37.654]  Immigration and also on trade.
[00:45:38.534 --> 00:45:40.516]  And it was very valuable for him to do that.
[00:45:40.516 --> 00:45:46.081]  He would have been a very valuable person to have in the Trump administration in certain areas.
[00:45:46.081 --> 00:45:52.126]  But in terms of being an attorney general, as we pointed out yesterday, Donald Trump needs a wartime concierge.
[00:45:52.126 --> 00:45:57.011]  He needs somebody who's going to go to war against the people who are organizing a coup against him.
[00:45:57.011 --> 00:45:58.352]  And this is very serious.
[00:45:58.352 --> 00:45:59.873]  These are people who are very powerful.
[00:46:01.855 --> 00:46:09.840]  Dark State, the intelligence community, who is trying to organize a coup against Donald Trump, along with the Democrat Party, along with the press.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:10.960]  It is a big task.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:16.324]  And if Donald Trump doesn't take this on, Alex Jones said this as soon as Donald Trump was elected.
[00:46:16.324 --> 00:46:21.567]  He said, if you don't go after the Democrats who have created crimes, they're going to take you down.
[00:46:22.427 --> 00:46:26.928]  And Jeff Sessions was not going to do that, and he isn't going to do that.
[00:46:26.928 --> 00:46:32.849]  And if he doesn't replace him with somebody who will, they're going to initiate a coup in one way or the other against Donald Trump.
[00:46:32.849 --> 00:46:39.250]  Well, I think Ty Cobb and Anthony Scaramucci is Trump sort of toughening up his cabinet, toughening up it a little bit.
[00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:45.292]  And we'll see what kind of moves are made with the Attorney General if Jeff Sessions doesn't come through in the ways he wants to.
[00:46:45.292 --> 00:46:50.933]  But now Trump needs help with the Republicans, and Paul Ryan is not helping him at all.
[00:46:51.912 --> 00:46:53.636]  But I'm not sure Paul Ryan wants to help him.
[00:46:53.636 --> 00:46:55.119]  I'm not sure the Republicans want to help him.
[00:46:55.119 --> 00:47:00.770]  And I think that that was identified when John Boehner said that Republicans will never repeal Obamacare.
[00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:01.973]  Here's that clip of John Boehner.
[00:47:07.438 --> 00:47:10.780]  They're never going to repeal it.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:13.341]  It's been around too long.
[00:47:13.341 --> 00:47:14.581]  That's what we were afraid of.
[00:47:28.408 --> 00:47:32.572]  I love how his arrogance, he's just telling you what's going to happen as if he knows.
[00:47:32.572 --> 00:47:33.153]  Status quo's changed.
[00:47:33.153 --> 00:47:33.413]  John Boner.
[00:47:54.773 --> 00:47:55.674]  Oh, it's a tax.
[00:47:55.674 --> 00:47:56.975]  Oh, I thought it wasn't.
[00:47:56.975 --> 00:48:00.680]  So he just got done telling you you'll never repeal Obamacare.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:04.484]  Now he's going to move on to insulting President Trump.
[00:48:16.824 --> 00:48:19.285]  That's nice from the former Republican leader.
[00:48:19.285 --> 00:48:20.945]  We've played a lot of golf together over the years.
[00:48:20.945 --> 00:48:22.826]  He was a donor of mine.
[00:48:22.826 --> 00:48:26.447]  And when I was Speaker, I was having a tough week.
[00:48:26.447 --> 00:48:31.489]  I could always count on the fact that Donald Trump would call me, cheer me up, pat me on the back.
[00:48:31.489 --> 00:48:33.169]  He's a good guy.
[00:48:33.169 --> 00:48:36.230]  But President?
[00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:37.611]  I never really saw him as President.
[00:48:40.583 --> 00:48:43.846]  We don't see you as Speaker of the House anymore, and there's a reason for that.
[00:48:43.846 --> 00:48:46.749]  That's just like when they laughed at Ian Colton.
[00:48:46.749 --> 00:48:51.573]  I said, well, Donald, you know, you weren't my first choice.
[00:48:51.573 --> 00:48:53.275]  No, I know, I know.
[00:48:53.275 --> 00:48:56.938]  I said, no, no, no, Donald, you weren't my second or my third choice.
[00:48:58.976 --> 00:49:02.860]  Yeah, because you want to repeal Obamacare that's hurting the American people.
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:07.784]  No, that's the Republicans.
[00:49:07.784 --> 00:49:09.146]  That's the Democrat Deep State.
[00:49:09.146 --> 00:49:11.448]  That's the media.
[00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:13.129]  That's the fake Russian probe.
[00:49:19.455 --> 00:49:22.557]  Uh, but, uh, he just keeps getting in his own way.
[00:49:22.557 --> 00:49:26.899]  Criticizing Comey, or criticizing the press every day.
[00:49:26.899 --> 00:49:30.340]  There's a couple things you learn when you get into politics.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:36.663]  One, is you never get into a fight with people who buy ink by the barrel.
[00:49:36.663 --> 00:49:40.005]  So you have to be a coward to go into politics, according to John Boehner.
[00:49:40.005 --> 00:49:42.026]  You have to be a coward.
[00:49:42.026 --> 00:49:43.747]  You don't go into politics unless you're a coward.
[00:49:46.044 --> 00:49:49.947]  He does it every day!
[00:49:49.947 --> 00:49:53.130]  And you don't have confidence in yourself, so don't go into politics.
[00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:59.796]  According to John Boehner, don't go into politics if you're a coward and you have no confidence.
[00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:02.558]  Yeah, let's hold this here because he says some things that we need to respond to.
[00:50:02.558 --> 00:50:05.901]  Number one, John Boehner is not Speaker of the House anymore.
[00:50:05.901 --> 00:50:06.201]  Why?
[00:50:06.201 --> 00:50:07.822]  He thinks he is.
[00:50:07.822 --> 00:50:11.906]  He had supported all of these policies that he continues to support.
[00:50:11.906 --> 00:50:13.187]  He was driven out of power.
[00:50:13.907 --> 00:50:20.451]  By the House Freedom Caucus, by conservatives who really mean what they say when they run as Republicans.
[00:50:20.451 --> 00:50:32.377]  If Donald Trump wants to get something done in Washington, he's going to have to ally himself with the House Freedom Caucus to drive out the scum at the top of the GOP party that are nothing but rhinos.
[00:50:32.377 --> 00:50:38.921]  People like Paul Ryanneau, who also came out defending Robert Mueller, saying he's anything but partisan.
[00:50:38.921 --> 00:50:39.121]  Look,
[00:50:39.781 --> 00:50:45.882]  Donald Trump said it's going to be death to the Republican Party if they don't pass Obamacare.
[00:50:45.882 --> 00:50:49.883]  Boehner is exhibit A as to how they're going to die.
[00:50:49.883 --> 00:50:57.805]  We're not going to put up with these phony Republicans who tell us one thing to get elected and then glibly say it isn't going to happen once they get in.
[00:50:57.805 --> 00:50:59.006]  Yeah, Mitch McConnell too.
[00:50:59.006 --> 00:51:03.787]  And by the way, Chuck Schumer was on the floor today literally pounding his arms against the desk for Obamacare.
[00:51:03.787 --> 00:51:05.027]  This guy's out completely unhinged.
[00:51:06.044 --> 00:51:11.187]  A great president once said, the nine most feared words in the English language.
[00:51:11.187 --> 00:51:13.889]  I am from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:51:13.889 --> 00:51:17.111]  Adequacy of loss, absorbing capacity.
[00:51:17.111 --> 00:51:18.391]  You call that help?
[00:51:18.391 --> 00:51:20.593]  That's the mandate approved by the G20.

[00:52:10.877 --> 00:52:19.440]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:27.341]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[00:52:27.341 --> 00:52:33.463]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,

[00:54:21.403 --> 00:54:22.764]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:22.764 --> 00:54:28.287]  I'm David Knight with Owen Schroer on this Tuesday, July 25, 2017.
[00:54:28.287 --> 00:54:30.949]  And we're getting close to the end of July.
[00:54:30.949 --> 00:54:40.736]  We had a large special that we began the 4th of July because it's about our independence from the mainstream media and your independence from the mainstream media.
[00:54:40.736 --> 00:54:47.620]  And so we appreciate you standing with us, supporting us, and we try to support your health as well as to fund this operation.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:48.681]  And so we created a
[00:54:49.321 --> 00:54:50.122]  We're good to go.
[00:55:06.994 --> 00:55:08.215]  Off-retail price.
[00:55:08.215 --> 00:55:14.739]  Silver Bullet, 66% off a retail price, along with free shipping storewide.
[00:55:14.739 --> 00:55:22.865]  We also have Strawberry Caveman, a new product that is in stock and 25% off retail, even though it is a new introductory product.
[00:55:22.865 --> 00:55:24.526]  We also have Caveman Combo.
[00:55:24.526 --> 00:55:29.449]  If you want to try two different flavors, we've got chocolate and strawberry at 25% off retail.
[00:55:29.449 --> 00:55:33.952]  And as we've had to pull some of our more popular products, like Supermail Vitality,
[00:55:35.026 --> 00:55:35.406]  All right.
[00:56:04.906 --> 00:56:08.388]  And I don't know why it doesn't sell as well as Supermail.
[00:56:08.388 --> 00:56:09.808]  It's essentially the same thing.
[00:56:09.808 --> 00:56:15.351]  It's going to work for you if you are trying to get Supermail and you can't get it because it's sold out.
[00:56:15.351 --> 00:56:23.896]  You can still get Super Female Vitality, and we have discounted that 30% off of retail, along with free shipping, store-wide.
[00:56:23.896 --> 00:56:26.957]  So check out our sales at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:56:26.957 --> 00:56:34.421]  We appreciate your support, and these July specials are going to be ending very soon, along with the month of July that will be ending very soon.
[00:56:35.061 --> 00:56:37.304]  All right, so let's take a look at what's going on.
[00:56:37.304 --> 00:56:48.856]  One of the things that I want to get back to, Owen, in the short amount of time that we've got here, it's not just the former CIA Director John Brennan who is pushing for a coup against Trump.
[00:56:48.856 --> 00:56:52.060]  We also had somebody, this is an interesting story that came out on Daily Mail.
[00:56:53.049 --> 00:56:54.090]  Here's the title.
[00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:55.831]  He's sprung a leak.
[00:56:55.831 --> 00:57:05.678]  Donald Trump appears to confirm the existence of a classified CIA operation in Syria in his late night Twitter rant about the Amazon Washington Post.
[00:57:05.678 --> 00:57:06.598]  And this is what he had to say.
[00:57:06.598 --> 00:57:15.624]  He said, the Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending a massive, dangerous, wasteful payments to Syrian rebels who are fighting Assad.
[00:57:16.584 --> 00:57:20.447]  The CIA program, they say, was shuttered by Trump because it was designed to help rebels.
[00:57:20.447 --> 00:57:21.188]  Come on.
[00:57:21.188 --> 00:57:22.809]  We know who it was helping.
[00:57:22.809 --> 00:57:24.311]  And it isn't a secret.
[00:57:24.311 --> 00:57:27.914]  We've had John McCain, I would argue that he's violating the Logan Act.
[00:57:27.914 --> 00:57:36.100]  He's not authorized to conduct foreign policy, but he continues to meet with Al Qaeda-affiliated rebels in Syria to try to create regime change.
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.301]  That's the CIA program.
[00:57:37.301 --> 00:57:38.522]  It is not a secret.
[00:57:38.522 --> 00:57:40.384]  It has been widely reported.
[00:57:40.384 --> 00:57:44.067]  We've had a lot of reports showing them dropping arms to the
[00:57:45.428 --> 00:57:47.611]  Al-Qaeda affiliated rebels there.
[00:57:47.611 --> 00:58:03.668]  But now we have Ned Price, a former CIA employee, I don't know what his rank was there, but he said, told the Daily Mail, and this is their angle that they're coming in, if the media reports are true, the President of the United States just confirmed a CIA covert action operation on Twitter.
[00:58:04.269 --> 00:58:06.611]  See, that's the way they're going to spend this, Owen.
[00:58:06.611 --> 00:58:13.716]  And when we see Gutierrez saying that we're going to impeach Trump, they could come up with something as absurd about that.
[00:58:13.716 --> 00:58:21.601]  Donald Trump saying, hey, look, we have the Washington Post fabricating a story and say, you're exposing a CIA operation.
[00:58:21.601 --> 00:58:24.484]  Well, we know that the Washington Post is a CIA operation.
[00:58:24.484 --> 00:58:27.646]  You know, they got a massive contract with the CIA.
[00:58:27.646 --> 00:58:29.387]  So we know that that's what's happening.
[00:58:29.387 --> 00:58:30.648]  That's the way they're going to spend this.
[00:58:30.708 --> 00:58:32.329]  Well that's the interesting point to me.
[00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:35.372]  You've got Amazon getting lucrative deals with the government.
[00:58:35.372 --> 00:58:38.095]  You've got Amazon going to the White House meeting with Trump and Kushner.
[00:58:38.095 --> 00:58:40.637]  But you've got Trump bashing the Amazon post on Twitter.
[00:58:40.637 --> 00:58:42.038]  So it's an interesting dynamic.
[00:58:42.038 --> 00:58:42.499]  Yeah.
[00:58:42.499 --> 00:58:46.042]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:46.042 --> 00:58:49.545]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:49.545 --> 00:58:56.511]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:56.511 --> 00:58:57.032]  They use their...
[00:58:58.524 --> 00:59:02.330]  MycoZx is back in after five plus months sold out.
[00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:03.832]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[00:59:03.832 --> 00:59:05.554]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.

[00:59:09.179 --> 00:59:10.080]  Big waiting list.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.926]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[00:59:13.926 --> 00:59:14.747]  Nobody's got something this
[00:59:15.067 --> 00:59:22.135]  Save 30% off of MycoZx and get the gut health support back when you get it with the Biome Defense 50 million lives in each pill.

[00:59:36.129 --> 00:59:37.509]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.596 --> 01:00:15.940]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:20.604]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:20.604 --> 01:00:24.667]  And now, your host, Owen Schroer.
[01:00:24.667 --> 01:00:26.889]  We need to change that liner.
[01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:31.613]  If you are listening to this transmission, you are a Russian agent.
[01:00:31.613 --> 01:00:33.294]  You work for Vladimir Putin.
[01:00:34.716 --> 01:00:37.278]  No, of course that's total fake news.
[01:00:37.278 --> 01:00:46.066]  You are the ones that got Trump elected, the American people that have been forgotten by Hollywood, that Hollywood hates, that the Washington establishment hates.
[01:00:46.066 --> 01:00:47.708]  They don't want you to have a dream.
[01:00:47.708 --> 01:00:49.910]  They don't want you to be a sovereign citizen.
[01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:56.536]  They want you to go into the world government, capitulate, and hand over the privilege of the great American lifestyle.
[01:00:56.536 --> 01:00:57.557]  What we were talking about
[01:00:58.197 --> 01:01:07.383]  In the last segment, Donald Trump talking about the CIA operation going on in Syria to arm terrorists that's anti-Assad.
[01:01:07.383 --> 01:01:09.525]  And it really goes beyond that though.
[01:01:09.525 --> 01:01:15.509]  I think that this is a CIA operation that was currently operating in Syria to arm anti-Assad rebels.
[01:01:15.509 --> 01:01:23.654]  But this was a CIA operation that was decades old, decades in the making, has been guilty of starting proxy wars in the Middle East for years.
[01:01:23.654 --> 01:01:26.036]  Trump has shut that down.
[01:01:26.036 --> 01:01:28.077]  Of course, the left doesn't want to point out that
[01:01:28.637 --> 01:01:35.702]  They don't want to point out the fact that President Trump is trying to stop proxy wars in the Middle East.
[01:01:35.702 --> 01:01:45.488]  And you've got President Trump talking about this on Twitter, the left freaking out, even though McCain posts on social media literally him pictured with these people that we're arming that are terrorists.
[01:01:45.488 --> 01:01:48.730]  But Tulsi Gabbard has come out and made a statement.
[01:01:48.730 --> 01:01:55.314]  She was on Fox's Tucker Carlson supporting Trump's ending of the CIA program that was arming terrorists in Syria.
[01:01:55.314 --> 01:01:55.915]  Here's that clip.
[01:01:57.312 --> 01:02:09.035]  American people have been crying out for peace for so long and the media completely is missing the point here about what is being reported that Trump is ending the CIA program as you described.
[01:02:09.035 --> 01:02:13.555]  But for the benefit of your viewers, let's talk about what the CIA program actually was.
[01:02:13.555 --> 01:02:20.337]  It's been widely reported that for years now, the CIA was providing arms, intelligence, money and other types of support.
[01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:21.478]  Which also happens.
[01:02:44.254 --> 01:02:46.018]  That is grotesque.
[01:02:46.018 --> 01:02:48.686]  I'm honestly and sincerely confused.
[01:02:48.686 --> 01:02:50.631]  Why would anyone defend this?
[01:02:52.014 --> 01:03:00.097]  It is this addiction to regime change and this idea that somehow this is what must be done.
[01:03:00.097 --> 01:03:15.081]  Again, without actually looking at the fact that we have been providing direct and indirect support to Al-Qaeda, this very same terrorist group that attacked us on 9-11 and that we are supposed to be continuing to be fighting against and trying to defeat.
[01:03:15.081 --> 01:03:19.603]  And that the thing that should make everyone feel sick is that
[01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:29.772]  People would rather support directly and indirectly Al-Qaeda than actually give up their regime change goals.
[01:03:29.772 --> 01:03:33.636]  So you are a progressive Democrat from one of the most liberal states in the world.
[01:03:34.594 --> 01:03:40.155]  Agreeing with Donald Trump on this specific piece of policy, what kind of reaction do you get from your fellow Democrats in the House?
[01:03:40.155 --> 01:04:01.461]  Well, look, for years, even through the Obama administration, I've been advocating to bring about an end to this program, and I'm continuing, actually, through the introduction of my bill, the Stop Arming Terrorists Act, to make sure that our government does not use taxpayer dollars to provide this kind of support, whether it's weapons, intelligence, or money, or anything else.
[01:04:01.981 --> 01:04:06.984]  You've got the Democrats who couldn't win an air hockey match against the Ghost.
[01:04:06.984 --> 01:04:10.786]  Why aren't they trying to force someone like Tulsi Gabbard up as their next leader?
[01:04:10.786 --> 01:04:15.428]  Why aren't the Democrats forcing Tulsi Gabbard up as the next leader of their party?
[01:04:15.428 --> 01:04:20.151]  I don't know what else she stands for, but I tell you what, it's a good example when somebody speaks the truth.
[01:04:20.831 --> 01:04:29.737]  Regardless of what party they're in, regardless of any other labels or, you know, identity of that person, we need to support them when they're saying the truth.
[01:04:29.737 --> 01:04:31.438]  And this is an example.
[01:04:31.438 --> 01:04:36.121]  Tulsi Gabbard is very articulate, very knowledgeable about what's going on there.
[01:04:36.121 --> 01:04:38.983]  She's speaking truth to power about this.
[01:04:38.983 --> 01:04:43.886]  I trust people who will say the truth, even if I disagree with them on issues.
[01:04:43.886 --> 01:04:45.827]  And she's a, as you point out, a progressive.
[01:04:45.827 --> 01:04:47.969]  They would probably disagree about health care.
[01:04:47.969 --> 01:04:49.890]  But I know that I could have a discussion with her.
[01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:55.398]  And maybe I could persuade her, and that's the way that I feel about Donald Trump on issues that I disagree with him on.
[01:04:55.398 --> 01:04:55.839]  No, David.
[01:04:55.839 --> 01:05:00.005]  On four issues I agree with him, I think it's important that we have honest people in government.
[01:05:00.005 --> 01:05:00.366]  No, David, no.
[01:05:00.366 --> 01:05:03.570]  We're gonna give you Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters.
[01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:04.612]  That's who we're gonna give you.
[01:05:04.612 --> 01:05:05.033]  John Boehner.
[01:05:06.107 --> 01:05:17.792]  Will the gov... Astonishing anti-federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution, fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[01:05:17.792 --> 01:05:20.794]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[01:05:20.794 --> 01:05:29.358]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you are to become a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:31.999]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[01:05:32.259 --> 01:05:40.405]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[01:05:40.405 --> 01:05:44.728]  Today, everything the government does, at every level, is concealed from us.
[01:05:44.728 --> 01:05:49.652]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[01:05:49.652 --> 01:05:55.917]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[01:05:55.917 --> 01:05:58.078]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[01:05:58.078 --> 01:06:01.581]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort.
[01:06:01.721 --> 01:06:03.913]  When we should be demanding liberty.
[01:06:03.913 --> 01:06:05.943]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:06:06.863 --> 01:06:11.526]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:06:11.526 --> 01:06:24.473]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:06:24.473 --> 01:06:31.037]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:06:31.037 --> 01:06:33.498]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[01:06:33.618 --> 01:06:33.838]  I think?
[01:06:54.087 --> 01:06:56.309]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:57.951]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:06:57.951 --> 01:06:59.233]  It's the air we're breathing.
[01:06:59.233 --> 01:07:00.654]  Especially for our children.
[01:07:00.654 --> 01:07:02.476]  The artificial particulates.
[01:07:02.476 --> 01:07:03.437]  The chemicals.
[01:07:16.411 --> 01:07:19.573]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:07:19.573 --> 01:07:28.780]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:36.305]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:07:36.305 --> 01:07:44.330]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:07:44.330 --> 01:07:45.311]  The general public doesn't.
[01:07:46.514 --> 01:07:49.875]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:07:49.875 --> 01:07:54.016]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:07:54.016 --> 01:08:00.719]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:08:00.719 --> 01:08:04.820]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:12.872]  You found it!
[01:08:12.872 --> 01:08:14.896]  The tip of the spear!
[01:08:14.896 --> 01:08:19.064]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[01:08:19.064 --> 01:08:21.889]  And now, your host, David Knight!
[01:08:27.486 --> 01:08:28.766]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:28.766 --> 01:08:29.987]  I'm David Knight with Owen Schroer.
[01:08:29.987 --> 01:08:32.647]  We're going to be joined now by Lee Stranahan.
[01:08:32.647 --> 01:08:36.868]  He's going to break down a story that he's been covering for months that is just now getting traction.
[01:08:36.868 --> 01:08:37.688]  Let me tell you how.
[01:08:37.688 --> 01:08:45.950]  Today, we had Reuters saying Trump, without evidence, cites Ukraine ties to ex-rival Clinton.
[01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:46.790]  Without evidence?
[01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:47.030]  Really?
[01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.791]  There's no evidence?
[01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:48.951]  Well, there is a lot of evidence.
[01:08:49.511 --> 01:08:51.373]  The mainstream media doesn't want to talk about it.
[01:08:51.373 --> 01:08:52.774]  Reuters doesn't want to talk about it.
[01:08:52.774 --> 01:08:55.797]  Lee Stranahan has been covering this story for months.
[01:08:55.797 --> 01:08:59.660]  And let's go back a couple of weeks, back to July 13th.
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:04.564]  We had The Atlantic doing a story, the What About Ukraine defense of Trump Jr.'
[01:09:04.524 --> 01:09:05.325]  's Russia meeting.
[01:09:05.325 --> 01:09:07.367]  And they said, before welcoming Donald Trump Jr.
[01:09:07.367 --> 01:09:14.032]  onto a show on Tuesday, Sean Hannity boiled down his defense of the President's son to one word, Ukraine.
[01:09:14.813 --> 01:09:18.115]  So, after Sean Hannity got onto it, it started to get traction.
[01:09:18.115 --> 01:09:23.197]  We've got Donald Trump talking about it, he came on the show, he's talked about it, now they're pushing back, saying there is no evidence.
[01:09:23.197 --> 01:09:33.101]  But going back to January, we had Politico break down a very long expose of this, saying the Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire.
[01:09:33.101 --> 01:09:40.325]  They say Kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the President-elect after quietly working to boost Clinton.
[01:09:41.175 --> 01:09:47.099]  This is the open secret that nobody wants to talk about, that Reuters does not want to talk about.
[01:09:47.099 --> 01:09:51.241]  But I wanted to get the guy on today that's been talking about it for quite some time, Lee Stranahan.
[01:09:51.241 --> 01:09:59.166]  Lee's been a contributing editor and reporter for two of the top news sites in the world, the liberal Huffington Post and conservative Breitbart News.
[01:09:59.166 --> 01:10:02.489]  He now runs citizenjournalismschool.com.
[01:10:02.489 --> 01:10:04.510]  And thank you for joining us, Lee Stranahan.
[01:10:05.646 --> 01:10:08.630]  And David, I gotta point out, let's give you credit too.
[01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:10.973]  You and I have talked about this Ukraine story.
[01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:12.255]  Yes.
[01:10:12.255 --> 01:10:14.358]  Weeks before Sean Hannity brought it up.
[01:10:14.358 --> 01:10:16.781]  And by the way, God bless Sean Hannity for bringing it up.
[01:10:16.781 --> 01:10:17.542]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:10:17.542 --> 01:10:18.804]  I'm glad it's getting traction.
[01:10:18.804 --> 01:10:19.625]  It needs to, yeah.
[01:10:19.625 --> 01:10:20.226]  Me too.
[01:10:20.226 --> 01:10:20.406]  Yeah.
[01:10:21.047 --> 01:10:22.388]  Me too.
[01:10:22.388 --> 01:10:35.233]  I will say this, the mistake that Hannity's making and that other people have made, Laura Ingram in the Daily Caller, this has nothing to do with the Donald Trump meeting with the Russian lawyer story.
[01:10:35.233 --> 01:10:40.475]  You and I were talking about it here on InfoWars well before that was even known.
[01:10:40.475 --> 01:10:41.155]  That's right.
[01:10:41.155 --> 01:10:43.516]  So I just want people to separate it out because
[01:10:44.156 --> 01:10:52.858]  This is not a story about like, oh well, it's okay if we did this because they did that, that kind of calling out hypocrisy thing.
[01:10:52.858 --> 01:11:02.601]  This is a story about admitted interference in the 2016 election by the Ukrainian government through a
[01:11:05.271 --> 01:11:10.133]  Operative, a DNC operative with the unfortunate name of Alexander Chalupa.
[01:11:10.133 --> 01:11:17.416]  Now, I say unfortunate because of Taco Bell, obviously, but... I like Chalupas.
[01:11:17.416 --> 01:11:27.939]  But here's the thing, it works out really well for us, because in a story that you point out correctly, the mainstream media has been ignoring, it's nice to have a name that's easy to remember, right?
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.825]  Will Hillary Clinton drop the Chalupa, for instance, is the headline.
[01:11:33.825 --> 01:11:35.567]  I predict coming, and it helps.
[01:11:35.567 --> 01:11:38.410]  Because here's another name that's less easy to remember.
[01:11:38.410 --> 01:11:39.852]  Leschenko.
[01:11:39.852 --> 01:11:40.132]  Okay?
[01:11:41.892 --> 01:11:43.913]  Sergei Leschenko.
[01:11:43.913 --> 01:11:46.655]  Sergei Leschenko is really important here.
[01:11:46.655 --> 01:11:53.258]  Sergei Leschenko is a former journalist in the Ukraine who's now a member of parliament, okay?
[01:11:53.258 --> 01:11:57.960]  By the way, if you look up Leschenko on Twitter, he's very well known in the Ukraine.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:04.263]  He's got about 350,000 followers on Twitter, which is, that's significant, right?
[01:12:04.263 --> 01:12:06.844]  And so, he's very well known there.
[01:12:06.844 --> 01:12:09.105]  Leschenko has admitted
[01:12:10.302 --> 01:12:12.544]  That Ukraine was interfering in the election.
[01:12:12.544 --> 01:12:15.105]  And by the way, he's one of the people who was involved.
[01:12:15.105 --> 01:12:19.829]  He said, we were so concerned about, there he is, he's a very attractive young man.
[01:12:19.829 --> 01:12:21.950]  He's tall as well.
[01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:28.815]  But Sergei Lyschenko is key to understanding this, as is Alexander Chalupa.
[01:12:28.815 --> 01:12:35.580]  Now, there's two things that happened on this in the past 24 hours, David, that are significant.
[01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:40.412]  This morning Donald Trump tweeted about it.
[01:12:40.412 --> 01:12:45.375]  And he said that Jeff Sessions should be investigating what's going on.
[01:12:45.375 --> 01:12:53.701]  Now I've been urging people to call the White House and call their congressman and urge an investigation for weeks now.
[01:12:53.701 --> 01:12:54.802]  So this is significant.
[01:12:54.802 --> 01:12:56.303]  But the other thing that happened.
[01:12:57.341 --> 01:13:07.392]  Is last night, Chuck Grassley brought up something about Alexander Chalupa and he quotes Leschenko in that.
[01:13:07.392 --> 01:13:15.702]  And I would advise, there's a great writer over at Daily Caller, Chuck Ross.
[01:13:15.702 --> 01:13:17.464]  Chuck's a great investigative journalist.
[01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:21.704]  He's one of those guys, David, and you know how this goes.
[01:13:21.704 --> 01:13:29.853]  Sometimes you read stories and you just notice the same journalist is on them and you go, well that dude or dudette is pretty good, right?
[01:13:29.853 --> 01:13:31.134]  Like Sarah Carter, yeah, exactly.
[01:13:33.106 --> 01:13:38.089]  And so he has a piece about it last night in the Daily Caller, but this is significant.
[01:13:38.089 --> 01:13:43.532]  I urge everybody to read what Chuck Grassley posted that's linked in that story.
[01:13:43.532 --> 01:13:56.420]  And of course, Chuck Grassley has also been pointing out the connections with Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS and all these other, and the connections to the FBI, asking questions of Director Comey when he was still director.
[01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:58.885]  We're completely ignored.
[01:13:58.885 --> 01:14:04.679]  So why are you working with these people to try to come after Donald Trump when they're putting out false information?
[01:14:04.679 --> 01:14:04.839]  Yes.
[01:14:05.488 --> 01:14:11.474]  Well, let's take this to a 50,000 foot level for a second because I really want people to understand why this story is so significant.
[01:14:11.474 --> 01:14:17.320]  In fact, I'm going to argue, David, that this is the most important story in the world right now.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.402]  It is the most important buried story in the world.
[01:14:20.402 --> 01:14:25.587]  It is the story of the DNC's collusion with the government of Ukraine.
[01:14:25.587 --> 01:14:28.030]  And the reason I say that, David, is that
[01:14:29.352 --> 01:14:36.040]  If you looked at the media in the past six months, you'd think the biggest story was Trump-Russia, right?
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:41.146]  If you consumed establishment media, you'd believe that's the biggest story, right?
[01:14:41.146 --> 01:14:46.592]  But as you point out on InfoWars all the time, there's so much of that story, it doesn't make sense, it's fake.
[01:14:48.252 --> 01:14:57.440]  So, the reason I say the Ukraine story is significant is Alexander Chalupa is the person who started the Trump-Russia narrative.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:59.602]  She is a significant force behind it.
[01:14:59.602 --> 01:15:05.747]  In fact, the investigative reporter Michael Isikoff from now at Yahoo, but he's covered a lot of major stories.
[01:15:06.508 --> 01:15:22.698]  He called, if you just Google Yahoo 2016 election Alexander Chalupa, you'll find an article he wrote calling Alexander Chalupa, who we're going to make a household name, Alexander Chalupa, you're on notice, you're going to be a household name.
[01:15:22.698 --> 01:15:28.442]  He called her one of the most significant people in the 2016 election back in October.
[01:15:28.442 --> 01:15:30.023]  That's what he said.
[01:15:30.023 --> 01:15:32.925]  She was working closely with Isikoff.
[01:15:32.925 --> 01:15:35.246]  She, her sister, Andrea Chalupa,
[01:15:36.483 --> 01:15:42.825]  Said in two separate tweets that Alexandra Chalupa was behind the Trump-Russia narrative.
[01:15:42.825 --> 01:15:46.326]  She was the main researcher for the DNC.
[01:15:46.326 --> 01:15:47.066]  Very important.
[01:15:47.066 --> 01:15:51.528]  You gotta remember, Alexandra Chalupa, she worked in the Clinton White House.
[01:15:51.528 --> 01:15:54.149]  She goes back to the Bill Clinton era.
[01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:56.589]  She's been a DNC operative since 2004.
[01:15:58.772 --> 01:16:01.496]  She was working directly for the DNC.
[01:16:01.496 --> 01:16:05.743]  And as we're going to point out, the DNC was using Chalupa.
[01:16:05.743 --> 01:16:07.044]  This is what they're doing.
[01:16:07.044 --> 01:16:12.072]  So, so let me, Reuters, when they say, for instance, there's no connection to Clinton.
[01:16:13.137 --> 01:16:16.342]  That's because Chalupa's a cutout.
[01:16:16.342 --> 01:16:23.833]  In other words, I believe it's very clear, and I've had a source directly tell me who's been involved in this, that they believe this as well.
[01:16:23.833 --> 01:16:28.560]  The DNC wants to keep one level of separation from Chalupa.
[01:16:29.535 --> 01:16:35.079]  And Chalupa was funding operations through a guy named Brett Kimberlin.
[01:16:35.079 --> 01:16:40.023]  Brett Kimberlin's a convicted serial bomber who I've written about for years as well.
[01:16:40.023 --> 01:16:42.184]  And again, no conjecture on this.
[01:16:42.184 --> 01:16:44.306]  She's worked directly with this guy.
[01:16:44.306 --> 01:16:48.109]  So what the DNC's doing, David, this is Watergate stuff.
[01:16:48.689 --> 01:16:48.909]  Yes.
[01:16:48.909 --> 01:16:51.471]  The cover-up is worse than the crime.
[01:16:51.471 --> 01:17:08.100]  And that's what I said from the very beginning, is when we look at what they did, going back to their manipulation against Bernie Sanders, what they do is they project their crimes onto Russia, or onto Trump, to cover up what they're actually doing.
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:09.261]  And that's what we're seeing right here.
[01:17:09.261 --> 01:17:14.544]  There's not any collusion, there's nothing there, in spite of all these special prosecutors, this longtime investigation.
[01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:25.650]  Nothing showing collusion between Trump and Russia, but there's a lot of collusion that's going on between the DNC, and we all know how intricately connected the DNC was to Hillary Clinton.
[01:17:25.650 --> 01:17:35.455]  If it was investigated, I'm sure we would find those ties to come up, but they don't want to investigate the real collusion that was going on with the foreign government to manipulate our election.
[01:17:35.455 --> 01:17:38.177]  Well, first off, there is paper.
[01:17:38.177 --> 01:17:40.698]  I'm going to be reporting today on my website, populist.tv.
[01:17:42.797 --> 01:17:57.430]  For the first time, this is an exclusive and I'm really breaking some of it here, that Alexander Chalupa, after the election, worked with convicted bomber Brett Kimberlin, who financed it, to bring a foreign national into the country.
[01:17:58.050 --> 01:18:05.012]  This is right after the election, where that foreign national met with members on Capitol Hill, and that's 100% confirmed.
[01:18:05.012 --> 01:18:14.395]  Chuck Ross confirmed to me, he spoke to people on the Hill, I heard it from another source, with the intent of keeping Donald Trump from taking office.
[01:18:14.395 --> 01:18:16.255]  Now, David, you know how I roll.
[01:18:16.255 --> 01:18:18.456]  I don't like to do the conjecture thing.
[01:18:18.456 --> 01:18:18.916]  That's right.
[01:18:18.916 --> 01:18:21.637]  You're very conservative about that, yes.
[01:18:21.637 --> 01:18:22.557]  I am.
[01:18:22.557 --> 01:18:24.398]  That's one area where I'm very conservative.
[01:18:25.816 --> 01:18:29.637]  Marijuana legalization is an area where I'm not so conservative, but let's leave that aside.
[01:18:29.637 --> 01:18:32.799]  You're conservative about the information that you present to people and your sources.
[01:18:32.799 --> 01:18:33.879]  That's right, yeah, that's right.
[01:18:33.879 --> 01:18:40.942]  So, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I consider myself a conservatively, you know, small government populist, right?
[01:18:40.942 --> 01:18:43.763]  So, this is absolutely confirmed.
[01:18:43.763 --> 01:18:51.646]  They brought a foreign national over to meet with Democrats on the Hill, and they met with several of them and their staffers.
[01:18:52.714 --> 01:18:56.638]  To try to keep Donald Trump from taking office.
[01:18:56.638 --> 01:19:04.427]  They hatched a plan, and this is all going to come out, that would have had Barack Obama... This sounds so crazy.
[01:19:04.427 --> 01:19:05.948]  That's bombshell news.
[01:19:05.948 --> 01:19:07.590]  This is really bombshell news.
[01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:08.791]  I'm anxious to see this report.
[01:19:08.791 --> 01:19:09.352]  Yes.
[01:19:09.352 --> 01:19:09.973]  Go ahead, break it down.
[01:19:10.834 --> 01:19:22.978]  So yeah, this is going to sound so crazy that the mainstream media would accuse it of being a conspiracy theory on InfoWars, but it's 100% proven, and you'll see that this plays out, David.
[01:19:22.978 --> 01:19:24.239]  They hatched a plan.
[01:19:25.302 --> 01:19:31.446]  Where Obama would step down early, Biden would, they would cancel the Electoral College.
[01:19:31.446 --> 01:19:40.593]  Now you remember, this time in November, and if anyone doesn't believe me, go look at Andrea Chalupa, Alexandra Chalupa's sister's Twitter feed from November 2016.
[01:19:40.593 --> 01:19:45.456]  She's all about stopping the Electoral College vote.
[01:19:45.456 --> 01:19:45.777]  Oh yeah?
[01:19:45.777 --> 01:19:50.100]  They were going to have Obama step down early, this was the plan, hatched by this foreign national.
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.007]  Hang on, this is a dynamite bombshell information.
[01:19:54.007 --> 01:19:55.109]  We're going to be right back.
[01:19:55.109 --> 01:19:59.237]  Lee Stranahan, and you can find him at thepopulist.tv.
[01:19:59.237 --> 01:19:59.878]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:05.666 --> 01:20:06.547]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:20:06.547 --> 01:20:08.928]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:20:08.928 --> 01:20:16.973]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:20:16.973 --> 01:20:18.895]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[01:20:36.986 --> 01:20:38.868]  A real zinc shortage is upon us.
[01:20:38.868 --> 01:20:46.954]  The Wall Street Journal says zinc supplies are down to three weeks, mine supplies struggling to meet demand, and no major discoveries in the last 22 years.
[01:20:46.954 --> 01:20:48.095]  What's it mean for you?
[01:20:48.095 --> 01:20:53.899]  Keith Neumeyer, who's made hundreds of millions investing in hard asset mining clays, is making his biggest call yet.

[01:21:10.474 --> 01:21:13.316]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:21:13.316 --> 01:21:15.298]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:21:15.298 --> 01:21:20.282]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:21:20.282 --> 01:21:22.364]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:21:22.364 --> 01:21:23.645]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:28.750]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:32.093]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[01:21:32.233 --> 01:21:35.575]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:21:35.575 --> 01:21:38.558]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:21:38.558 --> 01:21:42.240]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.

[01:24:10.885 --> 01:24:17.961]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:17.961 --> 01:24:20.507]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[01:24:24.258 --> 01:24:25.539]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:25.539 --> 01:24:30.081]  I'm David Knight here with Owen Schroer and we're talking to Lee Stranahan, a veteran reporter.
[01:24:30.081 --> 01:24:35.944]  He's worked, as I pointed out before, both for the liberal Huffington Post and the conservative Breitbart News.
[01:24:35.944 --> 01:24:38.486]  And when I said before that he's conservative, yes, he is.
[01:24:38.486 --> 01:24:39.826]  He believes in limited government.
[01:24:39.826 --> 01:24:44.329]  But I was talking about the fact that Lee is very careful about connecting the dots.
[01:24:45.209 --> 01:24:50.853]  He's got citizenjournalismschool.com, where he trains people about the principles of good journalism.
[01:24:50.853 --> 01:24:54.376]  So he's not going to go over the edge with this.
[01:24:54.376 --> 01:25:06.104]  And yet, as we were going to break, Lee Strahan gave us bombshell information about a serial bomber who came to the United States with others within the DNC and with the Ukraine.
[01:25:06.724 --> 01:25:11.546]  He's talking about subverting the election and subverting the electoral college.
[01:25:11.546 --> 01:25:15.989]  I'm going to get back to Lee and give him the floor so he can break this down for us right now.
[01:25:15.989 --> 01:25:16.729]  Lee, go ahead.
[01:25:16.729 --> 01:25:17.249]  Continue.
[01:25:17.249 --> 01:25:17.930]  Sure.
[01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:21.511]  So let's just go over the cast of characters again here because it's significant.
[01:25:21.511 --> 01:25:24.273]  There's a DNC operative named Alexandra Chalupa.
[01:25:24.273 --> 01:25:27.114]  She was involved with the Ukraine, right?
[01:25:27.114 --> 01:25:31.596]  And by the way, you can look this up in a WikiLeaks email, Ali Chalupa.
[01:25:31.596 --> 01:25:33.437]  She sent an email to the DNC.
[01:25:33.437 --> 01:25:34.398]  It's completely proven.
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:38.502]  Alex Chalupa worked in the Clinton administration.
[01:25:38.502 --> 01:25:40.663]  Second person you need to know about is Brett Kimberlin.
[01:25:40.663 --> 01:25:43.625]  Brett Kimberlin's a convicted serial bomber.
[01:25:43.625 --> 01:25:48.928]  In the 80s, he set off a series of bombs around Indianapolis, Indiana.
[01:25:48.928 --> 01:25:51.350]  He spent 17 years in prison.
[01:25:51.350 --> 01:26:01.316]  You may remember there was a story many years ago where Dan Quayle was accused of, someone said, I was Dan Quayle's pot dealer.
[01:26:01.316 --> 01:26:03.017]  That was Brett Kimberlin.
[01:26:03.017 --> 01:26:04.098]  He lied, he lied.
[01:26:05.252 --> 01:26:12.759]  He's a, this is a guy who was convicted of perjury by the time he was like 19 years old.
[01:26:12.759 --> 01:26:16.202]  Right, but he gets out of prison and becomes a liberal activist.
[01:26:16.202 --> 01:26:19.105]  That's what Barack Kimballon does, okay?
[01:26:19.105 --> 01:26:23.148]  Now, he was the money guy here.
[01:26:23.148 --> 01:26:30.135]  In other words, this foreign national was contacted after the election by someone with the Democrat Party.
[01:26:31.934 --> 01:26:36.800]  Then they were put in touch with Alexander Chalupa.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.703]  Then they said, we want to bring you over to Washington.
[01:26:39.703 --> 01:26:42.407]  The money came from Brett Kimberlin.
[01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:52.812]  And we were just showing, for the people who are listening on radio, we're just showing a clip here laying out the crimes of Brett Kimberlin and the bombings that he was convicted of.
[01:26:52.812 --> 01:26:53.592]  Go ahead, Lee.
[01:26:53.592 --> 01:26:56.253]  So this is a video I did a few years ago to explain.
[01:26:56.253 --> 01:26:59.274]  Again, it's a complex story, but it's stunning.
[01:26:59.274 --> 01:27:03.815]  Now, Brett Kimberlin appears to be the bag man for this operation.
[01:27:03.815 --> 01:27:07.176]  In other words, the DNC is not going to write a check.
[01:27:07.176 --> 01:27:07.956]  Does that make sense?
[01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:08.736]  Right, right.
[01:27:09.676 --> 01:27:19.541]  They kept one level of separation by using Alexandra Chalupa, who by this time was no longer officially working for the DNC.
[01:27:19.541 --> 01:27:27.466]  She introduced this foreign national to Brett Kimberlin, and Brett Kimberlin paid for the trip over.
[01:27:27.466 --> 01:27:30.407]  Where did Brett Kimberlin get the money?
[01:27:30.407 --> 01:27:34.409]  Well, that's what an investigation is going to need to find out, right?
[01:27:34.409 --> 01:27:35.710]  They're not going to say.
[01:27:35.710 --> 01:27:36.751]  But this is significant.
[01:27:38.191 --> 01:27:40.492]  They brought the foreign national over.
[01:27:40.492 --> 01:27:42.232]  Well, how does this tie into the Democrats?
[01:27:42.232 --> 01:27:44.173]  Maybe Kimberlin was acting on his own.
[01:27:44.173 --> 01:27:46.113]  Maybe Shalhoub was acting on her own.
[01:27:46.113 --> 01:27:47.074]  No.
[01:27:47.074 --> 01:27:52.055]  Because this foreign national was brought over to talk to people on Capitol Hill, and he did.
[01:27:52.055 --> 01:27:54.756]  Now, here's the thing, David.
[01:27:54.756 --> 01:27:56.176]  I'm just asking.
[01:27:56.176 --> 01:27:57.997]  You're a well-connected journalist.
[01:27:57.997 --> 01:28:03.118]  If you wanted to get someone from a foreign country to come over to talk to people on Capitol Hill, could you set up meetings?
[01:28:03.118 --> 01:28:04.118]  Because I couldn't.
[01:28:04.118 --> 01:28:04.418]  That's right.
[01:28:04.418 --> 01:28:05.159]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:28:05.159 --> 01:28:05.759]  That's right.
[01:28:05.759 --> 01:28:06.199]  Absolutely.
[01:28:06.719 --> 01:28:19.802]  And that's very suspicious, the fact that this guy who's got a long criminal record would pay to bring over a foreign national who then he shops around to the highest levels of people on Capitol Hill in Washington.
[01:28:19.802 --> 01:28:32.764]  Now then months later, this foreign national was involved again with Alexander Chalupa and Brett Kimberlin in a scheme to take down Donald Trump with documents that turned out to be false.
[01:28:32.764 --> 01:28:35.485]  And at that point, and this has been reported by BuzzFeed,
[01:28:36.804 --> 01:28:38.085]  No right-wing source.
[01:28:38.085 --> 01:28:45.169]  BuzzFeed reported on this, and then it was followed up on by the great Chuck Ross at Daily Caller.
[01:28:45.169 --> 01:28:56.015]  Brett Kimberlin, again, paid three times for this foreign national, Jonathan Schwartz, who used to be with the ANC, by the way, in South Africa.
[01:28:56.015 --> 01:28:57.516]  So, back to that.
[01:28:57.516 --> 01:28:58.497]  Heavily communist, yeah.
[01:28:59.201 --> 01:28:59.501]  Right.
[01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:00.521]  No, he was.
[01:29:00.521 --> 01:29:02.682]  He was the militant wing of the ANC.
[01:29:02.682 --> 01:29:08.723]  Brett Kimberlin paid three times for him to fly from Israel to Rome to look at these documents.
[01:29:08.723 --> 01:29:10.224]  They got these documents.
[01:29:10.224 --> 01:29:13.785]  They paid $9,000 to get these documents.
[01:29:13.785 --> 01:29:16.585]  And the documents turned out to be false.
[01:29:16.585 --> 01:29:18.746]  BuzzFeed did a story about this.
[01:29:20.649 --> 01:29:23.172]  But they didn't mention Alexander Chalupa's name.
[01:29:23.172 --> 01:29:25.755]  Chuck Ross is the one who followed up on that.
[01:29:25.755 --> 01:29:32.482]  So what I'm saying is, now when you tie this in, and let me tell you, two people
[01:29:33.673 --> 01:29:36.254]  Okay, we got 10 seconds, and then we're gonna have to take a break.
[01:29:36.254 --> 01:29:40.036]  Tie it in real quickly for us in 10 seconds, and we'll have you back right after the break.
[01:29:40.036 --> 01:29:47.278]  George Soros, who you've heard of, and also just Ukrainians in general, but Soros comes up all over the place.
[01:29:47.278 --> 01:29:50.220]  He's a major funder, he's connected to all of these groups.
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:55.221]  The Moriarty of Crime, George Soros, and we're gonna be right back with Lee Stranahan and this bombshell investigation.
[01:29:55.221 --> 01:29:56.122]  We're on the march.
[01:29:56.122 --> 01:29:58.663]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:58.663 --> 01:30:01.304]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:18.064]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:30:18.064 --> 01:30:25.107]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[01:30:25.107 --> 01:30:34.231]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.
[01:30:35.896 --> 01:30:37.696]  Independence isn't a day.
[01:30:37.696 --> 01:30:38.737]  It's a mindset.
[01:30:38.737 --> 01:30:41.497]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[01:30:41.497 --> 01:30:43.098]  I will not be your slave.
[01:30:43.098 --> 01:30:49.159]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[01:30:49.159 --> 01:30:54.120]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:56.021]  Slaves are never safe.
[01:30:56.021 --> 01:30:59.001]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[01:30:59.001 --> 01:31:00.102]  Guard your liberty.
[01:31:00.102 --> 01:31:03.462]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[01:31:03.462 --> 01:31:05.343]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.

[01:32:08.183 --> 01:32:11.966]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:32:11.966 --> 01:32:19.691]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:32:19.691 --> 01:32:28.296]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:32:28.296 --> 01:32:32.739]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:32:32.739 --> 01:32:38.063]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:32:38.303 --> 01:32:42.545]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:32:42.545 --> 01:32:45.946]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:32:45.946 --> 01:32:57.090]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:32:57.090 --> 01:33:00.012]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[01:33:00.012 --> 01:33:05.994]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[01:33:13.907 --> 01:33:15.148]  You found it.
[01:33:15.148 --> 01:33:17.190]  The tip of the spear.
[01:33:17.190 --> 01:33:21.554]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:25.741]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.741 --> 01:33:29.164]  I'm David Knight here with Owen Schroer and we're talking to Lee Stranahan.
[01:33:29.164 --> 01:33:31.366]  Amazing bombshell information.
[01:33:31.366 --> 01:33:32.346]  We had to take a break.
[01:33:32.346 --> 01:33:37.350]  We're going to continue back with this story, this research that Lee Stranahan has put together.
[01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:45.777]  The thread of what is really state collusion and a foreign state trying to alter our election.
[01:33:45.777 --> 01:33:47.138]  And that's the Ukraine.
[01:33:47.138 --> 01:33:49.380]  And this is something that hasn't been talked about.
[01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:51.241]  It's been hidden by the mainstream media.
[01:33:51.241 --> 01:33:52.723]  And even as we have Donald Trump
[01:33:53.479 --> 01:33:55.340]  Tweet out about it today, we have Reuters say.
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:56.600]  There's absolutely no proof.
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:04.324]  Well, if you're listening, you heard some very hardcore links and we're going to break down some more of those with Lee Stranahan here in just a moment.
[01:34:04.324 --> 01:34:08.466]  Before we get back to the news and to Lee, I just want to remind you that our
[01:34:09.446 --> 01:34:17.148]  July specials that began with the 4th of July or Independence specials that began with free shipping storewide, massive discounts on our most popular products.
[01:34:17.148 --> 01:34:18.228]  That's going to be ending soon.
[01:34:18.228 --> 01:34:26.790]  We're here July 25th and so this is going to be ending the end of July and we've already had some items like Supermail Vitality.
[01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:30.311]  We had to end that discount because it's almost sold out.
[01:34:30.311 --> 01:34:36.373]  We have to reserve a few for people who are on auto ship who get that 10% discount for setting up their auto ship.
[01:34:37.153 --> 01:34:42.154]  However, we still have plenty of Super Female Vitality left, and it's discounted 30%.
[01:34:42.154 --> 01:34:44.775]  And that's in addition to free shipping.
[01:34:44.775 --> 01:34:49.435]  And you need to understand that male vitality, Super Male Vitality, is basically the same formula.
[01:34:49.435 --> 01:34:50.876]  It's just a little bit different.
[01:34:50.876 --> 01:34:53.776]  There's nothing there that's going to harm you.
[01:34:53.776 --> 01:34:57.317]  It's not going, there's nothing that's hormonal that's going to harm you.
[01:34:57.317 --> 01:34:58.657]  It's basically the same formula.
[01:34:58.657 --> 01:35:00.678]  So if you want to get that, and you want to get a 30% discount,
[01:35:02.458 --> 01:35:06.142]  Super Female Vitality is still available and of course free shipping store-wide.
[01:35:06.142 --> 01:35:10.085]  Let me tell you some of the other things that we have at the store that are, well we have free shipping store-wide.
[01:35:10.085 --> 01:35:11.166]  We have a couple new products.
[01:35:11.166 --> 01:35:15.190]  We have True Whey Protein, 25% off out of the gate.
[01:35:15.190 --> 01:35:16.871]  That's at infowarriorslife.com.
[01:35:16.871 --> 01:35:21.796]  The Ultimate Protein Pack, 25% off Caveman and True Whey Protein.
[01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:23.297]  Another special that we have there.
[01:35:23.297 --> 01:35:26.239]  We also have another flavor of Caveman.
[01:35:26.239 --> 01:35:28.921]  Our special bone formulation there to support you.
[01:35:28.921 --> 01:35:30.302]  That's Strawberry Caveman.
[01:35:30.302 --> 01:35:31.963]  That's 25% off.
[01:35:31.963 --> 01:35:35.746]  But we have discounts up to 66% off.
[01:35:35.746 --> 01:35:40.489]  Silver Bullet is discounted 66% off retail price.
[01:35:40.489 --> 01:35:41.910]  Take a look at the specials that we have there.
[01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:46.453]  We got everything from water filters, to air filters, to vitamin mineral fusion drink, 33% off.
[01:35:47.834 --> 01:35:50.577]  Two, as I pointed out, Super Female Vitality, 30% off.
[01:35:50.577 --> 01:35:52.820]  We have DNA Force, 20% off.
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:36:02.231]  That's a big discount, a big savings dollar-wise, folks, because that is a very expensive product to produce, a very effective product.
[01:36:02.231 --> 01:36:04.634]  If you talk to the people, take a look at the reviews that are there.
[01:36:05.589 --> 01:36:06.830]  A very unique product.
[01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:09.031]  That's 20% off of DNA Force.
[01:36:09.031 --> 01:36:10.472]  A lot of specials.
[01:36:10.472 --> 01:36:11.433]  Look at the website.
[01:36:11.433 --> 01:36:12.974]  And again, that's going to be ending soon.
[01:36:12.974 --> 01:36:13.834]  The month of July.
[01:36:13.834 --> 01:36:14.554]  Free shipping.
[01:36:14.554 --> 01:36:17.516]  That'll be ending the end of July.
[01:36:17.516 --> 01:36:18.577]  So thank you for your support.
[01:36:18.577 --> 01:36:19.778]  Let's get back to Lee.
[01:36:19.778 --> 01:36:28.263]  He's breaking down this amazing bombshell story about a guy who has a long criminal record, Brett Kimberlin.
[01:36:28.263 --> 01:36:30.944]  He's served time in prison for bombings.
[01:36:30.944 --> 01:36:33.286]  He's been involved as a political operative.
[01:36:34.026 --> 01:36:44.010]  And he just happened to give money to a foreign national, bring them to the United States, shop them around the highest levels of Washington, D.C.
[01:36:44.010 --> 01:36:48.652]  And as Lee was pointing out, this is all involved, and he's going to break it down on his website as well.
[01:36:48.652 --> 01:36:56.155]  And of course, you can find him at citizenjournalismschool.com, and also the website, I guess the article, Lee, will be at thepopulist.us.
[01:36:56.155 --> 01:36:59.036]  Will that be where the article is, or is it thepopulist.tv?
[01:36:59.036 --> 01:37:01.237]  Populist.tv is the URL I'm using now.
[01:37:01.957 --> 01:37:02.157]  Okay.
[01:37:02.157 --> 01:37:02.317]  Yes.
[01:37:26.109 --> 01:37:29.993]  Regular viewers of InfoWars know that we were basically backing the wrong side.
[01:37:29.993 --> 01:37:38.283]  We were funding the rebels who were the Islamists, who've been killing Christians and other Muslims, by the way, in Syria.
[01:37:38.283 --> 01:37:39.464]  Al-Qaeda's air force.
[01:37:39.464 --> 01:37:41.226]  Yep, Al-Qaeda's air force.
[01:37:41.226 --> 01:37:46.432]  Now in Ukraine, we backed the overthrow of Yanukovych.
[01:37:47.344 --> 01:37:48.525]  Okay.
[01:37:48.525 --> 01:38:01.637]  And by the way, we then install, people can go to, you remember Victoria Nuland, the State Department official, who was caught on a phone call picking the new government of Ukraine, handpicking it?
[01:38:01.637 --> 01:38:02.018]  That's right.
[01:38:02.018 --> 01:38:03.139]  You can find that on YouTube.
[01:38:03.139 --> 01:38:05.821]  Just look for Victoria Nuland Ukraine phone call.
[01:38:05.821 --> 01:38:06.362]  That's right.
[01:38:06.362 --> 01:38:09.585]  It was leaked out, you can listen to it or you can read the transcript.
[01:38:09.585 --> 01:38:10.625]  It's absolutely amazing.
[01:38:11.306 --> 01:38:16.470]  Now, the reason I mention this is let's talk about who was on the side.
[01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:19.151]  No, no, the other side is Russia.
[01:38:19.151 --> 01:38:27.357]  In other words, if you demonize Russia, you can bury the truth about Syria and the truth about Ukraine.
[01:38:27.357 --> 01:38:28.218]  Does that make sense?
[01:38:28.218 --> 01:38:29.158]  Yep.
[01:38:29.158 --> 01:38:33.741]  Now, who was behind the burying of that?
[01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:38.625]  Hillary Clinton, who's the Secretary of State under Barack Obama, who pushed
[01:38:40.113 --> 01:38:49.057]  For the overthrow of the Syrian government and who was behind, though it didn't happen on her watch, but she was deeply involved in the Ukraine.
[01:38:49.057 --> 01:38:50.078]  Hillary Clinton.
[01:38:50.078 --> 01:38:51.178]  Yes.
[01:38:51.178 --> 01:38:58.342]  John McCain, who spoke in the Ukraine and has been one of the most vocal advocates for the rebels.
[01:38:58.342 --> 01:39:02.744]  We know that the CIA was involved in the Ukraine and Syria.
[01:39:02.744 --> 01:39:04.685]  We know that they were training people, right?
[01:39:04.685 --> 01:39:04.805]  Yes.
[01:39:04.805 --> 01:39:06.145]  I'm just keeping this simple.
[01:39:06.145 --> 01:39:09.127]  And we know that George Soros was also heavily involved.
[01:39:09.747 --> 01:39:19.372]  First off, he's one of Hillary Clinton's top donors, but he also spent $100 million in the Ukraine and helped push for things like the Arab Spring.
[01:39:19.372 --> 01:39:20.533]  You with me so far?
[01:39:20.533 --> 01:39:21.374]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:21.374 --> 01:39:30.259]  And we just had Donald Trump shut down the CIA's weapons program to the so-called moderate rebels that we know are really Al Qaeda or ISIS.
[01:39:30.259 --> 01:39:36.422]  And that's why the CIA, I think, is stepping up their rhetoric saying, hey, we need to basically take down Donald Trump.
[01:39:36.462 --> 01:39:41.124]  I mean, openly calling for a coup now, in terms of what they're saying to CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
[01:39:41.124 --> 01:39:41.444]  Go ahead.
[01:39:41.444 --> 01:39:48.326]  Now, what we also know is that the media did not inform the public about what was actually happening in Syria.
[01:39:48.326 --> 01:39:52.288]  I went to Lebanon myself in 2013 and got the truth.
[01:39:52.288 --> 01:39:54.108]  Ukraine, they didn't tell people.
[01:39:54.108 --> 01:39:58.790]  It's like, oh, Russia's the next, this place, and it's horrible, right?
[01:39:58.790 --> 01:40:03.272]  Now, I want you to notice who's behind the Trump-Russia narrative.
[01:40:03.272 --> 01:40:04.032]  Hillary Clinton.
[01:40:05.359 --> 01:40:10.962]  John McCain, the CIA, how many CIA leaks have we seen to the Washington Post?
[01:40:10.962 --> 01:40:14.903]  The Washington Post has got a six, owned by Jeff Bezos from Amazon.
[01:40:14.903 --> 01:40:19.145]  Amazon's got a $600 million contract with the CIA.
[01:40:19.145 --> 01:40:20.186]  Anybody can look that up.
[01:40:21.348 --> 01:40:21.808]  Right?
[01:40:21.808 --> 01:40:22.188]  That's right.
[01:40:22.188 --> 01:40:27.869]  John McCain, Hillary Clinton, the CIA, and the media, and it's all funded by George Soros.
[01:40:27.869 --> 01:40:35.931]  Yeah, isn't it interesting that the $600 million contract... Let's focus on that $600 million contract there with Jeff Bezos and Amazon.
[01:40:35.931 --> 01:40:46.013]  They're providing data services for the CIA, and then his newspaper just happens to get this anonymous information and leaks and so forth, and then run that through.
[01:40:46.013 --> 01:40:48.994]  And we heard earlier John Boehner saying, hey, you don't pick a fight.
[01:40:49.574 --> 01:40:53.576]  With people like the Washington Post, people who buy ink by the barrel.
[01:40:53.576 --> 01:40:57.038]  Well, what he is buying is leverage.
[01:40:57.038 --> 01:41:00.280]  What Bezos bought was leverage in Washington.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:07.944]  And he is using that political leverage, his little, you know, he paid $250 million, which is chump change for Jeff Bezos.
[01:41:07.944 --> 01:41:13.947]  As I pointed out, it'd be equivalent to somebody who's making $50,000 or so in the U.S., which is about the median family income.
[01:41:14.167 --> 01:41:34.298]  It'd be equivalent to you spending $300 to buy the Amazon Post, the Washington Post, so that you could push your narrative in Washington, so you could lobby people and say, hey, I better get what I want for my businesses, for Amazon, for my space businesses, or maybe there's going to be some unfriendly stories that come out of the Washington Post.
[01:41:34.298 --> 01:41:36.419]  So that's the kind of leverage that he's got with that.
[01:41:36.419 --> 01:41:42.903]  I think it's very important that we see that connection, what he's doing there, and the fact that Donald Trump is also calling him out on that.
[01:41:42.903 --> 01:41:43.343]  Go ahead, Lee.
[01:41:43.743 --> 01:41:47.445]  Well, because this Trump-Russia narrative has been pushed from the start.
[01:41:47.445 --> 01:41:57.349]  The first story to come out about it is Ellen Nakashima in the Washington Post on June 14th of last year did the first story accusing Russia.
[01:41:57.349 --> 01:42:00.250]  Now, by the way, the other group who fits in here is CrowdStrike.
[01:42:00.250 --> 01:42:04.092]  CrowdStrike are the only people to examine the DNC servers.
[01:42:04.092 --> 01:42:07.133]  Comey never subpoenaed them and never pushed for it.
[01:42:07.133 --> 01:42:12.816]  And CrowdStrike, by the way, co-founded by a former FBI person and
[01:42:13.536 --> 01:42:20.021]  CrowdStrike also had a false report about Ukraine that tried to tie this in.
[01:42:20.021 --> 01:42:26.745]  By the way, one other thing to note about CrowdStrike, they just went through a round of funding and that funding was by Google.
[01:42:26.745 --> 01:42:35.832]  So what we've seen is these new economy tech giants, Google Eric Schmidt is one of Hillary Clinton's biggest supporters.
[01:42:35.832 --> 01:42:38.173]  Bezos owns the Washington Post.
[01:42:38.173 --> 01:42:40.255]  So we're seeing how the world of new media
[01:42:41.431 --> 01:43:01.943]  What I will call non-independent new media, the clearly partisan pro-Clinton new media, right, has worked with the old media to hide the truth about Syria, about Ukraine, and the way they had to do that, David, think about it, it's Hillary, it's McCain, it's CIA.
[01:43:01.943 --> 01:43:03.604]  They had to make Russia
[01:43:04.975 --> 01:43:05.876]  The enemy.
[01:43:05.876 --> 01:43:06.637]  Yes.
[01:43:06.637 --> 01:43:10.240]  And you've been on CrowdStrike for the longest time, along with Ukraine.
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.862]  We've talked about it at length.
[01:43:12.862 --> 01:43:19.147]  And I think it's interesting that a couple weeks ago, you and I have not talked since it happened, but we had a retraction from the New York Times.
[01:43:19.147 --> 01:43:25.053]  I mentioned earlier in the show, New York Times and Reuters retracted and said, well, yeah, it wasn't all 17 agencies.
[01:43:25.053 --> 01:43:27.194]  It was actually a DNI clapper.
[01:43:27.194 --> 01:43:28.716]  He met with some hand-picked
[01:43:29.136 --> 01:43:30.077]  We're good to go.
[01:43:44.227 --> 01:43:54.751]  And then he says in testimony in May, he says, well, nobody objected when I told them what CrowdStrike told me, so therefore I speak for all 17 agencies, and that's where this nonsense came from.
[01:43:54.751 --> 01:44:05.935]  But it was a narrative that began with Hillary Clinton back in October in the debate, saying all 17 agencies agree that the Russians have tried to corrupt and hacked our election.
[01:44:06.215 --> 01:44:08.618]  And so they're, I think, guilty of the Hatch Act.
[01:44:08.618 --> 01:44:16.427]  They need to be investigated by a real Attorney General as to their violations in working with Hillary Clinton to try to get her elected.
[01:44:16.427 --> 01:44:18.770]  That's a violation of the Hatch Act at the very least.
[01:44:19.639 --> 01:44:32.790]  Well, and I don't want to shock the InfoWars audience, but you'd almost think there's a provable case that establishment Republicans and Democrats, in collusion with the media and the deep state, are trying to fool the American public.
[01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:36.533]  You'd almost, I don't know, like I said, I don't want to freak people out.
[01:44:36.533 --> 01:44:38.474]  If you're an InfoWars audience member, you're going...
[01:44:40.536 --> 01:44:42.717]  And that's kind of, that's the story.
[01:44:42.717 --> 01:44:48.378]  And also, Lee, you know, you're there, you've been at the White House press conference and press corps and everything.
[01:44:48.378 --> 01:45:03.602]  And of course, Jim Acosta, White House press corps representative for CNN, a full week after you had the New York Times and Reuters say that, no, it wasn't 17 agencies, it was, and they said it was three or four, it wasn't, it was just CrowdStrike and Clapper.
[01:45:03.602 --> 01:45:06.443]  But anyway, when Trump talked about that,
[01:45:06.863 --> 01:45:08.303]  Jim Acosta took him to task.
[01:45:08.303 --> 01:45:09.564]  He says, oh, it was all seven.
[01:45:09.564 --> 01:45:11.925]  And that was a week after they'd done their retraction.
[01:45:11.925 --> 01:45:23.428]  So even when other parts of mainstream media will retract and do it quietly, you still have people like CNN pushing that long-term narrative to the public.
[01:45:23.428 --> 01:45:33.491]  The way the American propaganda machine works, when we think of propaganda, we think of North Korea, where they have one state news agency and all the news comes through that.
[01:45:33.491 --> 01:45:36.552]  Or the Soviet Union, where you had Provident Tass and that's it, right?
[01:45:37.768 --> 01:45:44.713]  The way the American propaganda machine works is you have 500 channels, but they're all pushing the same narrative.
[01:45:44.713 --> 01:45:45.014]  Yes.
[01:45:45.014 --> 01:45:45.694]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:45:45.694 --> 01:45:46.595]  Yes, yes.
[01:45:46.595 --> 01:45:52.239]  It used to just be 3 channels, now it's 500.
[01:45:52.239 --> 01:45:55.522]  It's very important that people understand that they do it by two means.
[01:45:55.522 --> 01:45:57.363]  Repetition.
[01:45:57.363 --> 01:45:58.024]  See, don't forget.
[01:45:59.133 --> 01:46:02.259]  This is not Info Wars versus CNN.
[01:46:02.259 --> 01:46:05.726]  This is not Breitbart versus the Washington Post.
[01:46:05.726 --> 01:46:07.570]  This is a handful of sites.
[01:46:09.153 --> 01:46:14.177]  Infowars, Breitbart, Daily Caller, a few others, against everybody else.
[01:46:14.177 --> 01:46:21.763]  That's right, it used to just be, and I think it's interesting, Lee, to say, you know, we used to have like three to five channels that we could listen to, and they would all say the same thing.
[01:46:21.763 --> 01:46:26.807]  Operation Mockingbird, being what we've got up, if you don't know what that is, but you probably do if you're listening to Infowars.
[01:46:26.807 --> 01:46:32.131]  Now we've got three to five companies, but they've got 500 channels to say the same thing.
[01:46:32.131 --> 01:46:33.452]  That's essentially what we're looking at now.
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:37.381]  That's right, and they do it two ways, by repetition and omission.
[01:46:37.381 --> 01:46:46.002]  Repetition is everybody in that press room, or I've been in the White House press room many times, and everybody's asking a variant of the same question.
[01:46:46.002 --> 01:46:51.643]  And David, I've literally heard other reporters congratulate each other and say, hey, good job on picking up my question.
[01:46:51.643 --> 01:46:54.224]  And they literally said, this is the way we're going to do this.
[01:46:54.224 --> 01:46:56.724]  We need to carry the ball down the field for each other.
[01:46:56.724 --> 01:46:59.725]  They see themselves as a... I literally heard this, David.
[01:47:00.865 --> 01:47:03.567]  The Washington Post and CNN never mentioned once the email where Ali Chalupa
[01:47:17.339 --> 01:47:19.660]  Is reporting to the DNC.
[01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:21.521]  She says, I'll have more for you.
[01:47:21.521 --> 01:47:28.605]  And it's forwarded by the DNC's Luis Rivera, who's the Director of Communications.
[01:47:28.605 --> 01:47:32.227]  He forwards it to the Democrats' National Press Secretary.
[01:47:32.227 --> 01:47:34.128]  These are not low-level people, David.
[01:47:34.128 --> 01:47:34.969]  Right.
[01:47:34.969 --> 01:47:36.250]  This is provable.
[01:47:36.250 --> 01:47:37.630]  Every single thing is so provable.
[01:47:37.630 --> 01:47:43.614]  And this is one of the reasons I'm really big on, I don't like conjecture, because
[01:47:44.662 --> 01:47:55.429]  This story, which is all provable and admitted, proves exactly what the InfoWars audience and people like you and Alex have been saying for years.
[01:47:55.429 --> 01:48:01.453]  There is in fact, I don't know how else to put it without sounding like an ad, there is a conspiracy to control your mind.
[01:48:01.453 --> 01:48:02.594]  That's what's going on here.
[01:48:02.594 --> 01:48:03.054]  That's right.
[01:48:05.211 --> 01:48:11.337]  Repetition every single day on these other networks, and then they leave out key facts and key stories.
[01:48:11.337 --> 01:48:13.619]  There's no coverage of this Ukrainian thing.
[01:48:13.619 --> 01:48:14.379]  Nothing.
[01:48:14.379 --> 01:48:16.882]  So thank you, David.
[01:48:16.882 --> 01:48:21.326]  God bless you for the work you guys are doing, and God bless you for giving the time.
[01:48:21.326 --> 01:48:22.387]  No, you're doing great research.
[01:48:23.007 --> 01:48:28.151]  Now, what you were saying earlier about the Electoral College, we never did get to that connection.
[01:48:28.151 --> 01:48:36.898]  We were talking about the connection of this long-term convicted criminal, Brett Kimberlin, to the DNC, to the foreign agents who are coming here.
[01:48:36.898 --> 01:48:42.682]  Tell us how they were working to subvert the Electoral College, possibly.
[01:48:42.682 --> 01:48:43.463]  Well, you can see it.
[01:48:43.463 --> 01:48:46.145]  They were openly working to subvert the Electoral College.
[01:48:46.145 --> 01:48:50.868]  And Andrea Chalupa, Alexander's sister, who was part of bringing this foreign national over,
[01:48:53.268 --> 01:48:56.751]  Connected, right?
[01:48:56.751 --> 01:49:01.155]  They were openly talking about, well, what can we do to keep Donald Trump from getting seated?
[01:49:01.155 --> 01:49:07.300]  This foreign national came up with a plan that Obama would step down, Biden would take over.
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:10.823]  He would name someone like John Kasich as his vice president.
[01:49:10.823 --> 01:49:15.367]  After they subverted the Electoral College, you'd have a 50-50 split in Congress.
[01:49:15.367 --> 01:49:16.388]  This was his idea.
[01:49:16.388 --> 01:49:17.769]  This was his idea.
[01:49:19.554 --> 01:49:20.054]  We're good to go.
[01:49:38.544 --> 01:49:39.925]  We'd make up, right?
[01:49:39.925 --> 01:49:42.846]  I mean, it sounds crazy.
[01:49:42.846 --> 01:49:45.907]  Well, you know, we see that type of thing in history in the past.
[01:49:45.907 --> 01:49:48.008]  Yeah, we see crazy things like that in the past.
[01:49:48.008 --> 01:50:05.056]  I mean, if you go back and you look at Operation Northwoods, we had the staff pitching to President Kennedy to say, hey, we could have, you know, false flag terrorists who would attack malls, who would fly planes into buildings, and we could blame it on Castro, and that would give us a pretense to invade Cuba, and Kennedy shot it down.
[01:50:05.416 --> 01:50:07.618]  And then not too long after that, they shot Kennedy down.
[01:50:07.618 --> 01:50:10.561]  Literally shot him down.
[01:50:10.561 --> 01:50:16.327]  This foreign national, Jonathan Schwartz, aka Yanni, that's the name he uses.
[01:50:16.327 --> 01:50:20.651]  He was with the ANC, but he was in the intelligence division of the ANC.
[01:50:20.651 --> 01:50:22.913]  He was with the militant wing of the ANC.
[01:50:22.913 --> 01:50:23.995]  You follow me?
[01:50:23.995 --> 01:50:27.298]  So, he's not an insubstantial person.
[01:50:27.298 --> 01:50:28.519]  He's not just like a lone
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:33.341]  A guy sitting in his room knitting tinfoil, right?
[01:50:33.341 --> 01:50:39.323]  This is a guy who was with the African National Congress in the late 70s, early 80s.
[01:50:39.323 --> 01:50:41.563]  By the way, when they were connected to the Soviets.
[01:50:41.563 --> 01:50:43.124]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:43.124 --> 01:50:44.304]  Alright, we've got to take a quick break.
[01:50:44.304 --> 01:50:47.225]  We're going to be back one more segment with Lee Stranahan.
[01:50:47.225 --> 01:50:51.926]  We're going to try to wrap this up, sum it up, and he's going to tell you where you can find the rest of his
[01:50:52.526 --> 01:50:53.387]  Breaking article.
[01:50:53.387 --> 01:50:56.949]  He's done a lot of research on this and he is a very careful journalist.
[01:50:56.949 --> 01:50:57.530]  So stay with us.
[01:50:57.530 --> 01:50:58.250]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:58.250 --> 01:51:05.576]  David Knight with Owen Schroer and Lee Stranahan.
[01:51:05.576 --> 01:51:10.039]  It's been said any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:51:10.039 --> 01:51:11.640]  Those times may be near.
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:12.541]  Think about it.
[01:51:12.541 --> 01:51:17.164]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:51:17.164 --> 01:51:21.808]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:51:22.128 --> 01:51:27.954]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:51:27.954 --> 01:51:34.660]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:37.203]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:51:37.643 --> 01:51:40.445]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[01:52:05.143 --> 01:52:10.768]  Today, I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.

[01:52:41.389 --> 01:52:45.150]  And just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.

[01:55:41.905 --> 01:55:43.367]  Final week of these specials.
[01:55:43.367 --> 01:55:50.932]  So if you're thinking about getting something, do not procrastinate because we have the best specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:55:50.932 --> 01:55:52.934]  I want to go back to Lee Stranahan.
[01:55:52.934 --> 01:55:54.875]  Lee, we're getting into the George Soros
[01:55:56.036 --> 01:55:59.699]  Uh, aspect of this and how everything is being funded and pushed by Soros.
[01:55:59.699 --> 01:56:02.081]  What do you think that's about?
[01:56:02.081 --> 01:56:04.843]  Well, Soros clearly, there's two things.
[01:56:04.843 --> 01:56:07.244]  Number one, he spent a lot of money in the Ukraine.
[01:56:07.244 --> 01:56:09.826]  He helped overthrow Yanukovych.
[01:56:09.826 --> 01:56:13.649]  Uh, uh, and the way he did that is what he's doing in the United States.
[01:56:13.649 --> 01:56:15.770]  This is what people really need to be aware of.
[01:56:15.770 --> 01:56:20.654]  What happened in the Ukraine in a, in what was called the Euromaidan revolution.
[01:56:20.654 --> 01:56:21.955]  This happened at the end of 2013, early 2014.
[01:56:25.938 --> 01:56:27.219]  Tell me if this sounds familiar.
[01:56:27.219 --> 01:56:34.905]  All these protest groups started coming forward and protesting, trying to delegitimize the president, doing big demonstrations.
[01:56:34.905 --> 01:56:35.666]  Sound familiar?
[01:56:35.666 --> 01:56:36.947]  Sound like what's been happening?
[01:56:36.947 --> 01:56:42.172]  Yeah, and his color revolution is now going to look like the colors that he's using now are racial colors.
[01:56:42.172 --> 01:56:44.654]  That's why he's doing it with Black Lives Matter and other groups now.
[01:56:45.339 --> 01:56:50.241]  And also those pink hats during the Women's March.
[01:56:50.241 --> 01:56:58.244]  Soros is clearly funding all these groups in the United States just as he funded them in Ukraine, right?
[01:57:01.087 --> 01:57:06.113]  What they're trying to do is delegitimize Trump and delegitimize Russia.
[01:57:06.113 --> 01:57:07.835]  That's what they're trying to do.
[01:57:07.835 --> 01:57:14.102]  And what I noticed was Soros kept showing up all over the place here.
[01:57:14.102 --> 01:57:22.111]  And so, for instance, Ali Chaloupe in that email that she sent to the DNC, she spoke at a place called the Open World Leadership Center.
[01:57:22.691 --> 01:57:27.872]  Well, guess who was on the board of the Open World Leadership Center when it started in 2002?
[01:57:27.872 --> 01:57:28.692]  George Soros.
[01:57:28.692 --> 01:57:30.692]  I posted that on my Twitter feed.
[01:57:30.692 --> 01:57:34.613]  So, he keeps showing up every place you look here.
[01:57:34.613 --> 01:57:36.253]  He's the financier.
[01:57:36.253 --> 01:57:43.695]  What Hillary Clinton was able to do was, while she was Secretary of State, she was able to use the embassy in Kiev.
[01:57:43.695 --> 01:57:48.876]  Remember I talked about how he was funding these groups who were doing protests?
[01:57:48.876 --> 01:57:51.196]  We were doing these things called Tech Camp.
[01:57:52.589 --> 01:57:53.290]  At the U.S.
[01:57:53.290 --> 01:57:56.553]  Embassy, where we were literally training activists.
[01:57:56.553 --> 01:57:57.975]  I gotta say this again.
[01:57:57.975 --> 01:58:00.037]  We were training activists.
[01:58:00.037 --> 01:58:01.579]  And this started two things.
[01:58:02.591 --> 01:58:08.254]  The Arab Spring, Tech Camp was a way to show activists how to use technology.
[01:58:08.254 --> 01:58:09.134]  That's what it was.
[01:58:09.134 --> 01:58:09.574]  Yes.
[01:58:09.574 --> 01:58:10.635]  And you can look it up.
[01:58:10.635 --> 01:58:13.036]  It was a program started by Hillary Clinton.
[01:58:13.036 --> 01:58:14.416]  Civil Society 2.0.
[01:58:14.416 --> 01:58:17.238]  Just look up Hillary Clinton Civil Society 2.0.
[01:58:17.238 --> 01:58:18.999]  That's what fomented the revolution.
[01:58:18.999 --> 01:58:22.700]  And that's exactly what Clinton and Soros are trying to do now.
[01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:24.141]  The same M.O.
[01:58:24.141 --> 01:58:28.163]  And you've got a literal, it's a Nazi collaborator, George Soros, a literal Nazi.
[01:58:28.723 --> 01:58:29.424]  That's behind it.
[01:58:29.424 --> 01:58:31.325]  The Moriarty of regime change.
[01:58:31.325 --> 01:58:35.008]  Tell us, Lee, where we can find this article that you're going to break all this down.
[01:58:35.008 --> 01:58:43.374]  Well, if you go to populist.tv right now, we've got a new piece up right now that goes over the details of some of the stuff.
[01:58:43.374 --> 01:58:44.174]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:44.174 --> 01:58:47.557]  Infowars.com slash show.
[01:58:47.557 --> 01:58:50.519]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:50.519 --> 01:58:52.581]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:56.352 --> 01:59:02.155]  Today, I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[01:59:02.155 --> 01:59:10.819]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[01:59:10.819 --> 01:59:18.703]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[01:59:18.703 --> 01:59:24.846]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,
[01:59:25.186 --> 01:59:28.248]  NAR Lipoic Acid, Bio-PQQ and many others.
[01:59:28.248 --> 01:59:32.952]  Bio-PQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[01:59:32.952 --> 01:59:36.714]  And just one batch of this stuff cost us more than $30,000.
[01:59:36.714 --> 01:59:39.456]  Visit Infowarslife.com and read the reviews for yourself.

[01:59:57.740 --> 02:00:17.485]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:17.485 --> 02:00:23.026]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[02:00:23.026 --> 02:00:25.727]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:28.524 --> 02:00:29.665]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:29.665 --> 02:00:38.593]  We just had Lee Strahan breaking down how the Clintons were colluding with Ukraine to try to delegitimize President Trump and Russia, George Soros being behind that.
[02:00:38.593 --> 02:00:39.754]  This is another bombshell.
[02:00:39.754 --> 02:00:45.139]  This is another angle of the corruption from the Clinton campaign and the Democrats.
[02:00:45.139 --> 02:00:51.324]  Exclusive from the Daily Caller, FBI seized smashed hard drives from Washerman Schultz ITA's home.
[02:00:51.324 --> 02:00:52.566]  Now this is a big development.
[02:00:53.166 --> 02:01:00.372]  Washerman Schultz and the DNC have been doing everything they can to keep the FBI from getting these documents.
[02:01:00.372 --> 02:01:02.193]  They have been stonewalling.
[02:01:02.193 --> 02:01:04.195]  They have been not cooperating.
[02:01:04.195 --> 02:01:11.641]  Debbie Washerman Schultz has even gone as far as to threaten the Capitol Police for retaining these hard drives.
[02:01:12.441 --> 02:01:29.120]  But now they finally got it, and not only did they get the hard drives from Wasserman Schultz, they also got older hard drives from Pakistani-born Imran Awan, who was working with his three brothers and their wives for multiple members of the Democrat Party.
[02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:31.061]  Paid very well, by the way, too.
[02:01:31.061 --> 02:01:32.561]  Paid millions of dollars, in fact.
[02:01:32.561 --> 02:01:36.563]  Very, very well, compared to anybody else that does this kind of comparable work.
[02:01:36.563 --> 02:01:38.044]  And they were stealing property!
[02:01:38.044 --> 02:01:42.626]  They got busted by the Capitol Police for stealing computer equipment.
[02:01:42.626 --> 02:01:44.647]  And so, there's a lot more involved in that.
[02:01:44.907 --> 02:01:49.532]  I wish I had time to get to all this, but basically you have Wasserman Schultz who's destroying hard drives.
[02:01:49.532 --> 02:01:51.935]  You have the Awan brothers that are destroying hard drives.
[02:01:51.935 --> 02:01:52.676]  And stealing them.
[02:01:52.676 --> 02:01:56.960]  And then finally, the FBI comes in here and now has the hard drives.
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:00.744]  Wasserman Schultz threatens Capitol Police for taking the hard drives.
[02:02:01.425 --> 02:02:13.469]  The guy who came into the house, who moved into the house that the Awan brothers were living in, he found a bunch of weird burnt up hard drives and clearly hard drives that they tried to destroy, as well as other stuff.
[02:02:13.469 --> 02:02:19.671]  So you've got all of these crazy angles, and all the mainstream media wants to talk about is Trump and Russia.
[02:02:20.562 --> 02:02:23.405]  All they're talking about on the hill is Trump and Russia.
[02:02:23.405 --> 02:02:27.468]  It's a conviction looking for evidence, is what it's been called.
[02:02:27.468 --> 02:02:36.076]  We look at this Daily Caller thing, and they were exposing these brothers who were hired by Wasserman Schultz and others, and the crimes that they committed in terms of stealing.
[02:02:36.076 --> 02:02:43.803]  It kind of reminds me of the old story, you know, the guy that they kept going across the border, they thought he was smuggling something, and then they eventually figure out, hey, he's stealing bicycles.
[02:02:43.803 --> 02:02:45.184]  You know, when these guys take these hard drives,
[02:02:45.424 --> 02:02:51.511]  This is probably the information on the hard drives that they were just trying to get out and destroy.
[02:02:51.511 --> 02:02:58.698]  Here's the question that the public needs to ask, and it should be asked on Capitol Hill, it should be asked by the mainstream media, but they won't do it.
[02:02:58.698 --> 02:03:00.380]  They are total failures.
[02:03:01.457 --> 02:03:06.079]  Why did Hillary Clinton delete 33,000 emails and destroy cell phones?
[02:03:06.079 --> 02:03:09.700]  Why did Debbie Washerman Schultz destroy multiple hard drives?
[02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:14.902]  Why did the Awan brothers, who worked for multiple members of the Democrat Party, destroy multiple hard drives?
[02:03:14.902 --> 02:03:24.806]  And then why did the Awans and Debbie Washerman Schultz both threaten Capitol Police when they took the hard drives?
[02:03:24.806 --> 02:03:26.247]  And I forgot another angle of this!
[02:03:27.984 --> 02:03:32.766]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz's people called Jared Beck's office.
[02:03:32.766 --> 02:03:37.707]  Jared Beck is representing the plaintiffs right now in the DNC fraud lawsuit.
[02:03:37.707 --> 02:03:46.590]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz called the Beck's law firm, put on a voice modulator, and threatened them!
[02:03:46.590 --> 02:03:50.391]  And they're so dumb that they didn't even have the wherewithal to change the phone number!
[02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:52.584]  What are they hiding?
[02:03:52.584 --> 02:03:55.150]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[02:03:55.150 --> 02:03:57.035]  What is it that they're hiding?
[02:03:57.035 --> 02:03:57.637]  So think about it.
[02:03:58.573 --> 02:04:01.894]  All the investigation in Trump-Russia on the Hill, nothing there.
[02:04:01.894 --> 02:04:08.235]  Lee Stranahan, an independent journalist, just broke down the actual collusion with the Clinton campaign and Ukraine.
[02:04:08.235 --> 02:04:13.436]  We've got all of the investigation on Trump-Russia collusion, but yet we have all of the evidence.
[02:04:13.436 --> 02:04:18.477]  We have clear cases of obstruction of justice with Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[02:04:18.477 --> 02:04:23.739]  We have an actual lawsuit being levied against the DNC right now.
[02:04:23.739 --> 02:04:24.839]  You know what I think, David?
[02:04:25.459 --> 02:04:42.875]  I think amongst probably heinous other things that we won't even get into, I think that the Clintons and the Washerman Schultz of the world of the Democrat Party deleted these emails, deleted and smashed these hard drives because everything that Lee Stranahan just said was on there and everything about the DNC was on there.
[02:04:42.875 --> 02:04:48.661]  They stole the election from Bernie Sanders and they colluded with Ukraine and I think it's all in there and that's why they smashed it.
[02:04:48.661 --> 02:04:50.242]  Or I guess they just regularly do that.
[02:04:50.242 --> 02:04:50.542]  You think?
[02:04:51.363 --> 02:04:52.965]  I think that's exactly what's going on.
[02:04:52.965 --> 02:04:55.507]  They look at these guys and say, hey, they're stealing the hardware.
[02:04:55.507 --> 02:04:57.450]  No, they're stealing and covering up information.
[02:04:57.450 --> 02:04:58.070]  I'll be right back.
[02:04:58.070 --> 02:05:01.053]  I'm going to get a new computer, so I'm going to smash up this one during the break.
[02:05:01.053 --> 02:05:02.615]  We'll be right back with Michael Snyder.
[02:05:02.615 --> 02:05:04.117]  Roger Stone, breaking news at 2 o'clock.
[02:05:06.141 --> 02:05:13.126]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[02:05:13.126 --> 02:05:18.630]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[02:05:18.630 --> 02:05:21.973]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[02:05:21.973 --> 02:05:24.315]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[02:05:24.315 --> 02:05:29.659]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[02:05:29.659 --> 02:05:31.500]  That is the ultimate concern.
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:33.782]  The concentration of power, the excess of power,
[02:05:33.902 --> 02:05:34.062]  I think?
[02:05:51.092 --> 02:05:54.573]  ...must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[02:05:54.573 --> 02:05:59.936]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[02:05:59.936 --> 02:06:03.657]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[02:06:03.657 --> 02:06:05.498]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:06:06.218 --> 02:06:16.809]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:06:16.809 --> 02:06:18.871]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:21.754]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:06:21.754 --> 02:06:23.236]  It's made in the USA.
[02:06:23.236 --> 02:06:26.379]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[02:06:26.599 --> 02:06:27.019]  Absolutely.
[02:06:46.926 --> 02:06:58.654]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:06:58.654 --> 02:07:01.956]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:07:01.956 --> 02:07:05.138]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and fullwarslife.com.
[02:07:06.325 --> 02:07:09.348]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[02:07:09.348 --> 02:07:13.551]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[02:07:13.551 --> 02:07:20.236]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[02:07:20.236 --> 02:07:24.000]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:44.774]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[02:07:44.774 --> 02:07:48.317]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[02:07:48.877 --> 02:08:00.123]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[02:08:00.123 --> 02:08:05.225]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm freedom's safest place.
[02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:15.174]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[02:08:15.174 --> 02:08:21.423]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:21.423 --> 02:08:24.228]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[02:08:25.874 --> 02:08:27.235]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:27.235 --> 02:08:31.800]  I'm David Knight here with Owen Schroer and we have joining us now Michael Snyder.
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:37.346]  Michael Snyder is a frequent contributor to the Alex Jones Show, to Infowars.com.
[02:08:37.346 --> 02:08:39.207]  Of course he's now been attacked for that.
[02:08:39.207 --> 02:08:39.608]  Why?
[02:08:39.608 --> 02:08:42.691]  Because he's running for Congress in Idaho.
[02:08:42.691 --> 02:08:49.398]  Alternate, with a right-wing watch, says earlier this month, radical religious right prepper pundit
[02:08:50.058 --> 02:08:50.658]  Michael Snyder.
[02:08:50.658 --> 02:08:52.099]  I think that's a great introduction.
[02:08:52.099 --> 02:08:56.220]  I imagine you probably want to own that, Michael.
[02:08:56.220 --> 02:09:03.923]  Announced that he's running for Congress in Idaho for the seat being vacated by Representative Raul Labrador, who's running now for governor.
[02:09:03.923 --> 02:09:09.644]  And of course, they talk about some of the heinous positions that you take, which are things for freedom.
[02:09:09.644 --> 02:09:12.405]  You actually support health freedom, Idaho.
[02:09:12.405 --> 02:09:14.206]  I mean, who would want to support health freedom?
[02:09:14.426 --> 02:09:26.854]  This coming from the people who always like to identify themselves as pro-choice, unless that's the choice that you want to make for your children's health, the choice you want to make for your children's education, the choice you want to make for your own health care.
[02:09:26.854 --> 02:09:29.055]  No, no, no, we're not going to have any of those choices.
[02:09:29.055 --> 02:09:32.377]  The only choice that matters is the choice to abort your child.
[02:09:32.777 --> 02:09:36.218]  After that, they will make all the choices for you and for your children.
[02:09:36.218 --> 02:09:37.538]  So joining us now is Michael Snyder.
[02:09:37.538 --> 02:09:43.720]  He has EconomicCollapseBlog.com and also you can find him at MichaelSnyderForCongress.com.
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:45.641]  Thank you for joining us, Michael.
[02:09:45.641 --> 02:09:47.401]  David, it's great to be with you guys again.
[02:09:47.401 --> 02:09:49.262]  Thank you for having me.
[02:09:49.262 --> 02:09:53.723]  So how do you, do you own this fact that you are a prepper pundit?
[02:09:53.723 --> 02:09:59.985]  I mean, is that a negative or is that something that could get you elected in Idaho?
[02:10:01.397 --> 02:10:03.138]  Up here, people love that kind of thing.
[02:10:03.138 --> 02:10:11.083]  So, yeah, I'm glad to be attacked by the left because it just shows people how truly conservative, how, you know, liberty-oriented I am.
[02:10:11.083 --> 02:10:16.906]  So these attacks... And, you know, David, when I first started, when I jumped into this, I maybe was a little bit naive.
[02:10:16.906 --> 02:10:19.868]  I didn't know that it was going to be kind of like running into a hornet's nest.
[02:10:20.328 --> 02:10:20.428]  Right.
[02:10:40.401 --> 02:10:41.081]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:11:05.291 --> 02:11:08.092]  They want to take our choice totally away from us.
[02:11:08.092 --> 02:11:09.892]  And that's what the left always want.
[02:11:09.892 --> 02:11:15.193]  They want to take away liberty and freedom and impose their choices on the rest of us.
[02:11:15.193 --> 02:11:16.653]  And they don't want to have a discussion.
[02:11:16.653 --> 02:11:17.694]  They want to censor things.
[02:11:17.694 --> 02:11:19.194]  Well, you say you're under attack.
[02:11:19.194 --> 02:11:28.916]  Wait until they start talking about how you colluded with Russia, you met with prostitutes, concoct a report from MI5 to take you down.
[02:11:28.916 --> 02:11:31.396]  I mean, that's when you know that you're really over the target.
[02:11:31.396 --> 02:11:34.077]  They'll probably wait till you get elected before they do something like that.
[02:11:35.199 --> 02:11:43.938]  But good luck to your race and is there anything on your radar that you want to talk about or do you just want to talk about your races coming up here?
[02:11:45.129 --> 02:11:48.570]  Oh, we can certainly talk about my race, but we can talk about all kinds of things.
[02:11:48.570 --> 02:11:51.572]  We can talk about Obamacare just today.
[02:11:51.572 --> 02:11:57.274]  You know, now they're saying they might, the Senate might pass a skinny version of Obamacare repeal.
[02:11:57.274 --> 02:12:01.816]  Very, very limited in terms of what they want to do, but it just seems like they can't do anything.
[02:12:01.816 --> 02:12:09.399]  And that's part of the reason, David, why we need good people to get into Congress and the Senate, because up to this point,
[02:12:09.679 --> 02:12:14.523]  This is being called the most inactive Congress in 164 years.
[02:12:14.523 --> 02:12:21.129]  And even though we gave the Republicans the White House and the Senate and the House of Representatives, we can't seem to get anything done.
[02:12:21.129 --> 02:12:27.874]  Trump's agenda is stalled on all these major issues, whether it's Obamacare, repealing Obamacare, one of the worst pieces of legislation in U.S.
[02:12:27.874 --> 02:12:31.217]  history, whether it's building the wall.
[02:12:31.217 --> 02:12:36.962]  Trump is not just being blocked by the Democrats, but many Republicans don't want to build the wall on the southern border, whether it's
[02:12:37.102 --> 02:12:37.703]  Congratulate themselves.
[02:12:52.774 --> 02:13:01.676]  Well, you know, we just had a clip earlier in the show where we had former Speaker Boehner say, they're not going to get rid of Obamacare, they're not going to get anything done on tax return.
[02:13:01.676 --> 02:13:12.259]  He's Exhibit A, and of course his hand-picked successor, Paul Ryan, who was a running mate of Mitt Romney, and they were going to give us Romneycare if we didn't get Obamacare.
[02:13:12.259 --> 02:13:14.839]  They had already enacted Obamacare.
[02:13:14.839 --> 02:13:18.340]  Mitt Romney had in Massachusetts with Ted Kennedy.
[02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:22.383]  And Obamacare was simply a clone of that plan.
[02:13:22.383 --> 02:13:26.787]  So when we see John Boehner talking about, well, you know, Trump wasn't my first pick.
[02:13:26.787 --> 02:13:29.169]  He wasn't my second or my third pick.
[02:13:29.169 --> 02:13:33.953]  They always give us a choice of two people who are going to give us the same thing in the end.
[02:13:33.953 --> 02:13:36.836]  And that's what we saw when we had Romney running against Obama.
[02:13:36.836 --> 02:13:37.537]  We were going to get
[02:13:38.368 --> 02:13:41.150]  Government-run healthcare regardless of who we pick.
[02:13:41.150 --> 02:13:45.214]  They were going to give us, they were going to handpick the two choices to give us and that was going to be the choice.
[02:13:45.214 --> 02:13:47.736]  So it's great to have a different choice who's running.
[02:13:47.736 --> 02:13:50.338]  Tell us what you would change about Obamacare.
[02:13:50.338 --> 02:13:59.626]  I mean do you want to rip it out root and branch or would you sign into any of these bills that have come through so far that have been proposed by the Senate or by the House?
[02:14:00.825 --> 02:14:06.187]  Well, David, what I would do is what Republicans have been promising the voters for years and years.
[02:14:06.187 --> 02:14:10.489]  What I believe we need to do is, first of all, let's repeal Obamacare 100%.
[02:14:10.489 --> 02:14:13.210]  The Republicans actually did this twice before.
[02:14:13.210 --> 02:14:19.553]  Twice before they passed a bill to completely repeal Obamacare and got it to Barack Obama's desk.
[02:14:19.553 --> 02:14:24.195]  Why can't they get that same bill to President Trump's desk?
[02:14:24.195 --> 02:14:26.056]  But beyond that, of course, that doesn't fix our health.
[02:14:26.056 --> 02:14:27.096]  Because I know Trump would sign it.
[02:14:27.396 --> 02:14:29.177]  Well, that's the key though.
[02:14:29.177 --> 02:14:30.798]  Michael Snyder just pointed out the key.
[02:14:30.798 --> 02:14:35.301]  They knew Obama wasn't going to sign it, so they were okay with passing the repeal.
[02:14:35.301 --> 02:14:40.324]  Now they know that Trump would sign it, so they don't want to pass the repeal.
[02:14:40.324 --> 02:14:41.925]  And you better just watch out today.
[02:14:41.925 --> 02:14:45.788]  The Republicans are going to bluff again and pretend like they're going to pass a repeal.
[02:14:45.788 --> 02:14:52.772]  They're going to try to carry out this narrative for the rest of the week, stay in the media attention, pretend like they're working, and then go on vacation when they don't
[02:14:53.092 --> 02:14:54.813]  When they don't figure it out.
[02:14:54.813 --> 02:14:55.593]  It's all fake.
[02:14:55.593 --> 02:14:56.614]  It's all posing.
[02:14:56.614 --> 02:14:58.374]  They don't want to repeal Obamacare.
[02:14:58.374 --> 02:15:02.776]  But I want to get back, Michael Snyder, to the point you were talking about of being attacked from the left.
[02:15:02.776 --> 02:15:07.279]  You know, I don't think that the left realizes that these attacks aren't going to stick anymore.
[02:15:07.279 --> 02:15:09.399]  They can say here, oh, he's an anti-vaxxer.
[02:15:09.399 --> 02:15:10.100]  Lookit, he's crazy.
[02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:15.864]  But people are gonna, people are starting to move to the next level and say, alright, that's not, why is that crazy?
[02:15:15.864 --> 02:15:19.287]  He's just talking about vaccine choice and actually vaccines is making people sick.
[02:15:19.287 --> 02:15:21.068]  So that's not gonna stick.
[02:15:21.068 --> 02:15:22.950]  They don't want to debate you on actual issues.
[02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:25.352]  They don't want to bait you on actual substance.
[02:15:25.352 --> 02:15:27.614]  What about, I mean, are you hearing about your candidate?
[02:15:27.614 --> 02:15:29.295]  Have you talked about debating your candidate?
[02:15:29.295 --> 02:15:30.536]  Where they stand on anything?
[02:15:30.536 --> 02:15:31.557]  Or your opponent, excuse me?
[02:15:32.890 --> 02:15:43.581]  Yeah, I've got two opponents, and they're real establishment-type Republicans, kind of, and they're trying to appeal to the middle of the road, and so I'm trying to make a clear distinction that, hey, I'm the Liberty candidate.
[02:15:43.581 --> 02:15:55.474]  But, you know, every time a left attacks me, kind of like Trump, where the left and the mainstream media attack Trump, attack Trump, and they thought those attacks would work, but it just made them stronger, because people are starting to learn to think for themselves, and they're saying, hey,
[02:15:55.714 --> 02:15:58.796]  We're not necessarily going to take what the mainstream media tells us to do.
[02:15:58.796 --> 02:16:00.517]  We're going to look into this for ourselves.
[02:16:00.517 --> 02:16:02.278]  And so the media would attack Trump.
[02:16:02.278 --> 02:16:05.019]  They would look at him and say, no, no, we want what this guy is saying.
[02:16:05.019 --> 02:16:12.763]  Because even though Trump is not perfect, he tapped into an underlying desire for liberty and freedom that's in the heart of all of us.
[02:16:12.763 --> 02:16:15.985]  And people said, we finally have a chance to fight back against the establishment.
[02:16:15.985 --> 02:16:17.085]  Yeah, maybe this guy's not 100% perfect.
[02:16:18.206 --> 02:16:19.087]  But he's fighting.
[02:16:19.087 --> 02:16:23.510]  He's fighting and he's trying to fight back against the establishment.
[02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:32.115]  And so, you know, and I think that's going to strike up a chord up here with my campaign and what I want to do in that, you know, a lot of people, a lot of conservatives say, oh yeah, I'm a conservative.
[02:16:32.115 --> 02:16:33.216]  But what does that mean?
[02:16:33.216 --> 02:16:42.722]  Like, for example, a lot of people say they're pro-gun, but and yet they don't, when Republicans get into office, they don't want to do anything to repeal the laws that are already in place.
[02:16:42.722 --> 02:16:43.303]  For example,
[02:16:43.923 --> 02:16:53.028]  If I am fortunate enough to go to Washington, you know, in terms of being pro-gun, I want to abolish the B.A.T.F.E., which has been abusive.
[02:16:53.028 --> 02:16:54.328]  I mean, it goes back for decades.
[02:16:54.328 --> 02:16:57.470]  Alex Jones has been talking about this for as long as he's been on the air.
[02:16:57.470 --> 02:17:03.113]  But that's an agency we need to completely abolish because they've been used to harass and abuse gun owners for decades.
[02:17:03.553 --> 02:17:11.377]  I also want to start repealing the federal gun laws that have been on the books, were passed under Democrats, but were never repealed.
[02:17:11.377 --> 02:17:13.519]  Like the National Firearms Act of 1934.
[02:17:13.519 --> 02:17:18.501]  The Gun Control Act of 1968 needs to be completely repealed.
[02:17:18.501 --> 02:17:22.544]  All these federal laws so that we can fully restore our Second Amendment rights.
[02:17:23.124 --> 02:17:26.445]  Yeah, you know, when they talk about you being... They love to use labels, Michael, right?
[02:17:26.445 --> 02:17:30.826]  So when they talk about you being an anti-vaxxer, why don't you throw back some other labels at them?
[02:17:30.826 --> 02:17:34.107]  Say, I'm not an anti-vaxxer, I'm pro-life and pro-choice.
[02:17:34.107 --> 02:17:34.747]  Yeah, I'm pro-choice.
[02:17:34.747 --> 02:17:35.748]  They won't know what to do with that.
[02:17:35.748 --> 02:17:37.348]  It's like, I'm pro-life and pro-choice.
[02:17:37.348 --> 02:17:38.569]  It's like, what does that mean?
[02:17:38.569 --> 02:17:40.929]  So yeah, and just say, I'm for health freedom.
[02:17:40.929 --> 02:17:42.030]  I'm pro-life and pro-choice.
[02:17:43.730 --> 02:17:47.912]  Yeah, and ultimately that's what we all should be able to agree on.
[02:17:47.912 --> 02:17:52.915]  This country, our founders wanted a nation where liberty and freedom would be maximized.
[02:17:52.915 --> 02:17:58.918]  And so they wanted a limited federal government, they wanted a limited number of laws and rules and regulations to protect
[02:17:59.398 --> 02:17:59.958]  We're good to go.
[02:18:26.932 --> 02:18:39.696]  Yes, and every new law, every new rule, regulation, government agency restricts our liberty and freedom in some way and so that's, you know, we need to swing the pendulum completely back from where we're very, very restricted.
[02:18:39.696 --> 02:18:42.217]  Our liberties and freedoms have been greatly eroded.
[02:18:42.217 --> 02:18:47.318]  We need to go completely back in the other direction toward maximizing liberty and freedom.
[02:18:47.318 --> 02:18:49.699]  You know, here's the thing about what he just said.
[02:18:50.419 --> 02:18:51.800]  Most people don't understand the history.
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:54.921]  The liberals don't understand the history, especially the young liberals.
[02:18:54.921 --> 02:18:59.544]  America was created as a bastion of freedom to escape from big government.
[02:18:59.544 --> 02:19:01.845]  That's why America is here!
[02:19:01.845 --> 02:19:05.206]  It's not about being the best or being this or being that or being that.
[02:19:05.206 --> 02:19:06.147]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:19:06.147 --> 02:19:10.569]  This is where you go when you're trying to escape oppressive governments.
[02:19:10.569 --> 02:19:12.350]  That's why this country was created.
[02:19:12.350 --> 02:19:16.652]  If you want to go to an oppressive regime, if you want to go to a big government, that exists otherwhere.
[02:19:17.032 --> 02:19:18.133]  Not here in America.
[02:19:18.133 --> 02:19:19.954]  That's why this country was created, David.
[02:19:19.954 --> 02:19:30.000]  We declared our independence because the king had created a multitude of new offices and laws and sent swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.582]  And nothing ever good comes out of a swarm.
[02:19:32.582 --> 02:19:34.623]  Let's just make that clear.
[02:19:34.623 --> 02:19:39.807]  And when you're talking about the regulations, Michael, you get elected, what you need to do is you need to work with
[02:19:40.667 --> 02:19:51.053]  Ran Paul on his Reins Act to make sure that we don't have all of our laws being written by these unaccountable, unelected, and you can't remove them, bureaucracies.
[02:19:51.053 --> 02:19:52.213]  That's the real issue.

[02:21:15.246 --> 02:21:20.229]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:21:20.229 --> 02:21:22.310]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:21:22.310 --> 02:21:23.591]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:21:23.591 --> 02:21:28.694]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:21:28.694 --> 02:21:32.036]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:21:32.196 --> 02:21:35.537]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:21:35.537 --> 02:21:38.417]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:21:38.417 --> 02:21:42.178]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:21:42.178 --> 02:21:49.060]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:21:49.060 --> 02:21:56.521]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[02:22:04.545 --> 02:22:06.426]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[02:22:06.426 --> 02:22:09.667]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center cut, presidential bacon.
[02:22:09.667 --> 02:22:11.268]  Savory and delicious.
[02:22:11.268 --> 02:22:14.090]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[02:22:14.090 --> 02:22:14.490]  Awesome!

[02:22:17.851 --> 02:22:19.411]  NASA PAC Technology.
[02:22:19.411 --> 02:22:20.031]  Bacon.
[02:22:20.031 --> 02:22:24.192]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon.
[02:22:24.192 --> 02:22:25.613]  Or warm and served.
[02:22:25.613 --> 02:22:27.673]  Life-saving, ready to eat bacon.
[02:22:27.673 --> 02:22:29.614]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[02:22:34.575 --> 02:22:35.976]  It's time to get greedy.
[02:22:35.976 --> 02:22:37.838]  A real zinc shortage is upon us.
[02:22:37.838 --> 02:22:45.943]  The Wall Street Journal says zinc supplies are down to three weeks, mine supplies struggling to meet demand, and no major discoveries in the last 22 years.
[02:22:45.943 --> 02:22:46.884]  What's it mean for you?
[02:22:46.884 --> 02:22:52.868]  Heath Neumeyer, who's made hundreds of millions investing in hard asset mining plays, is making his biggest call yet.

[02:23:04.540 --> 02:23:06.480]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:13.382]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:23:13.382 --> 02:23:21.744]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:23:21.744 --> 02:23:27.425]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:23:27.605 --> 02:23:29.426]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:23:29.426 --> 02:23:31.708]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:23:31.708 --> 02:23:36.111]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:23:36.111 --> 02:23:38.292]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:23:38.292 --> 02:23:46.358]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:23:46.698 --> 02:23:46.938]  We're good.
[02:24:17.774 --> 02:24:35.244]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:24:35.244 --> 02:24:39.566]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here live.
[02:24:39.566 --> 02:24:40.727]  David Knight, Owen Schroyer.
[02:24:42.737 --> 02:24:45.498]  And others are coming back in the next segment live.
[02:24:45.498 --> 02:24:48.999]  I am here with breaking news and information.
[02:24:48.999 --> 02:24:58.603]  The biggest exclusive yet in the two year history of us covering what's happening with the campaign of President Trump.
[02:24:58.603 --> 02:25:03.885]  And of course, what's happened since he was president elect and then now president of the nation.
[02:25:03.885 --> 02:25:10.767]  So we have given you a lot of big exclusives, many of which came from the highest levels of the campaign and the White House.
[02:25:10.767 --> 02:25:11.968]  But this is undoubtedly
[02:25:12.987 --> 02:25:24.435]  In this whole quickening season we're in, the biggest news on this particular subject we've ever revealed, and it's coming up in 35 minutes when Roger Stone joins us via Skype.
[02:25:24.435 --> 02:25:26.236]  Roger Stone, InfoWars correspondent.
[02:25:27.782 --> 02:25:34.108]  Covering things that obviously are happening inside the executive branch and inside Washington and inside the White House.
[02:25:34.108 --> 02:25:45.278]  He has high-level sources, as folks obviously know, and I've been authorized to tell you that this is probably the biggest news he's broke so far in the last, really, three years of this saga.
[02:25:45.979 --> 02:25:50.942]  We have the details of the shake-ups that are happening inside the White House.
[02:25:50.942 --> 02:25:55.164]  We have the details of what's about to happen to Attorney General Sessions.
[02:25:55.164 --> 02:26:02.409]  We have the details of more firings, like you just saw from Mr. Scaramucci, of operatives of Reince Priebus.
[02:26:02.409 --> 02:26:06.871]  There has been a general amnesty given to people that if they leak one more time, they'll be removed.
[02:26:06.871 --> 02:26:09.273]  And as you see people leak, they're being removed each time.
[02:26:10.714 --> 02:26:12.175]  So this is a big, big deal.
[02:26:12.175 --> 02:26:14.277]  This is Trump taking the gloves off.
[02:26:14.277 --> 02:26:23.966]  Sessions, who I really like for whatever reason, is not going after Hillary for all the giant crimes she committed, for getting money from the Russians and the Chinese, for having illegal servers.
[02:26:25.555 --> 02:26:29.518]  And instead is going along with them trying to create a witch hunt against the President.
[02:26:29.518 --> 02:26:32.439]  Now the executive branch has the right to fire Sessions.
[02:26:32.439 --> 02:26:34.581]  He's trying to get Sessions to resign, obviously.
[02:26:34.581 --> 02:26:36.262]  Sessions hasn't done that yet.
[02:26:36.262 --> 02:26:38.583]  And Sessions is on his way out.
[02:26:38.583 --> 02:26:44.407]  And we need an Attorney General that will go after the Clintons for their crimes, Obama for their crimes.
[02:26:44.407 --> 02:26:53.293]  They're going to continue to try to dig stuff up that's made up on Trump and destroy him as a figurehead of the Liberty Movement and derail our killing of the TPP, derail our killing of
[02:26:54.093 --> 02:26:54.473]  We're good to go.
[02:27:21.727 --> 02:27:23.489]  This is why the globalists are panicking.
[02:27:23.489 --> 02:27:29.054]  If he succeeds, and he's already partially done that, if we succeed, it is going to be a giant game changer.
[02:27:29.054 --> 02:27:33.719]  So you're going to get the inside intel on what Trump's doing, why he's doing it.
[02:27:33.719 --> 02:27:34.540]  This is not leaks.
[02:27:35.865 --> 02:27:39.648]  This is information, obviously, that folks want you to know.
[02:27:39.648 --> 02:27:51.016]  The people in the White House obviously realize, as does the enemy, as does David Brock, as does people like George Soros, while the only living globalist who's been involved in this for the last 60 years.
[02:27:51.016 --> 02:27:52.016]  He is firmly against this.
[02:27:52.016 --> 02:27:53.597]  They're sworn to destroy us.
[02:27:53.597 --> 02:27:55.138]  They've openly said they want to shut us down.
[02:27:55.979 --> 02:28:02.125]  Because they understand InfoWars is developing the counter-talking points to their globalist narrative.
[02:28:02.125 --> 02:28:11.253]  Our talking points are based in truth, Americana, justice, free market, common sense, prosperity, and free society, where you're free to be a Christian or not.
[02:28:12.202 --> 02:28:15.245]  The West, the Renaissance, that's under attack.
[02:28:15.245 --> 02:28:17.007]  Trump's bringing it back.
[02:28:17.007 --> 02:28:19.270]  And I didn't invent all these talking points.
[02:28:19.270 --> 02:28:24.415]  I simply popularized them again, just like working with gun owners of America.
[02:28:24.415 --> 02:28:28.680]  We re-radicalized the NRA in the last decade and took it back over.
[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:32.824]  We were there to keep them honest, to get rid of the operatives, to get rid of the compromisers.
[02:28:32.824 --> 02:28:34.206]  And now the NRA is a giant.
[02:28:34.506 --> 02:28:34.966]  We're good to go.
[02:28:55.175 --> 02:28:56.275]  It is.
[02:28:56.275 --> 02:29:00.158]  99.8% of their campaign donations went to the Democratic Party in 2016.
[02:29:00.158 --> 02:29:02.080]  This is a lynch mob.
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:04.962]  Two of them were fired by Trump.
[02:29:04.962 --> 02:29:05.843]  We've got U.S.
[02:29:05.843 --> 02:29:10.146]  attorneys and people fired by Trump, now on a witch hunt.
[02:29:10.146 --> 02:29:14.990]  They'd be like if the judge, like you've been married to the judge, and she sat over the divorce court proceeding you're in.
[02:29:14.990 --> 02:29:17.552]  You're like, Your Honor, you're my wife, we're getting a divorce.
[02:29:18.211 --> 02:29:20.673]  The judge goes, no, I'm taking everything.
[02:29:20.673 --> 02:29:21.353]  I'm the judge.
[02:29:21.353 --> 02:29:24.996]  Of course, that never happened because you'd recuse yourself.
[02:29:24.996 --> 02:29:26.897]  It'd be flagrant misjustice.
[02:29:26.897 --> 02:29:27.718]  It'd be a miscarriage.
[02:29:27.718 --> 02:29:28.979]  Everyone would see through it.
[02:29:28.979 --> 02:29:30.059]  That's what they're doing.
[02:29:30.059 --> 02:29:33.402]  So Roger Stone in T-minus 30 minutes.
[02:29:33.402 --> 02:29:38.345]  Roger Stone in T-minus 30 minutes is going to lay out all this massive news.
[02:29:38.345 --> 02:29:38.786]  Stay with us.
[02:29:54.827 --> 02:29:58.749]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:58.749 --> 02:30:06.332]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:06.332 --> 02:30:07.913]  Duty, honor, country.
[02:30:07.913 --> 02:30:14.116]  Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be.
[02:30:14.116 --> 02:30:16.377]  They are your rallying points.
[02:30:16.377 --> 02:30:18.838]  To build courage when courage seems to fail.
[02:30:18.838 --> 02:30:22.379]  To regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith.
[02:30:22.379 --> 02:30:23.660]  To create hope when hope
[02:30:23.820 --> 02:30:25.381]  Becomes forlorn.
[02:30:25.381 --> 02:30:34.329]  Unhappily, I possess neither that eloquence of dictation, that poetry of imagination, nor that brilliance of metaphor to tell you all that they mean.
[02:30:34.329 --> 02:30:38.753]  The unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, but a flamboyant phrase.
[02:30:39.053 --> 02:30:50.721]  Every demagogue, every cynic, every hypocrite, every troublemaker, and I am sorry to say some others of an entirely different character will try to downgrade them even to the extent of mockery and ridicule.
[02:30:50.721 --> 02:30:52.703]  But these are some of the things they do.
[02:30:52.703 --> 02:30:54.424]  They build your basic character.
[02:30:54.424 --> 02:30:58.967]  They mold you for the future roles as the custodians of the nation's defense.
[02:30:58.967 --> 02:31:03.450]  This was said on May 12, 1962 by General Douglas MacArthur.
[02:31:03.450 --> 02:31:05.712]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:31:06.212 --> 02:31:15.302]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:31:15.302 --> 02:31:23.410]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:23.690 --> 02:31:28.575]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:31:28.575 --> 02:31:35.381]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:35.381 --> 02:31:42.548]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:31:42.548 --> 02:31:49.414]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:31:49.554 --> 02:31:54.040]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:31:54.040 --> 02:31:57.444]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[02:32:03.752 --> 02:32:05.414]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[02:32:07.654 --> 02:32:11.436]  MycoZx is back in after five plus months sold out.
[02:32:11.436 --> 02:32:12.936]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[02:32:12.936 --> 02:32:14.637]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[02:32:14.637 --> 02:32:17.078]  Latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[02:32:17.078 --> 02:32:18.279]  It's been sold out for months.
[02:32:18.279 --> 02:32:19.179]  Big waiting list.
[02:32:19.179 --> 02:32:23.001]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[02:32:23.001 --> 02:32:24.481]  Nobody's got something this good.
[02:32:24.481 --> 02:32:31.244]  Save 30% off of MycoZx and get the gut health support back when you get it with the Biome Defense 50 billion live in each pill.

[02:32:47.415 --> 02:32:52.258]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel, Crohn's-type stuff.
[02:32:52.258 --> 02:32:53.919]  Didn't exist years ago, now it's epidemic.
[02:32:53.919 --> 02:32:56.882]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them.
[02:32:56.882 --> 02:32:59.283]  Because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[02:32:59.283 --> 02:33:02.305]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:33:16.227 --> 02:33:27.310]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.310 --> 02:33:31.031]  We are back live.
[02:33:31.031 --> 02:33:35.993]  Coming up at the start of the next hour, T-minus 30 minutes away.
[02:33:35.993 --> 02:33:36.513]  Coming up...
[02:33:37.446 --> 02:33:51.856]  In the next hour, Roger Stone has been green-lighted to give you exclusive information of the shake-up of the ongoing purge of globalist deep state operators inside the Trump White House.
[02:33:51.856 --> 02:34:04.484]  So this is highest level intel directly from the shake-up exclusively given to InfoWars so that we can relay that information out to you.
[02:34:04.484 --> 02:34:05.705]  The shake-ups that are coming
[02:34:06.725 --> 02:34:07.245]  I think?
[02:34:21.630 --> 02:34:29.376]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Senator Sessions is on his way out for refusing to go after the crimes of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and others.
[02:34:29.376 --> 02:34:38.224]  Trump is trying to get him to resign, but if he doesn't, he is about to be out, and we're going to tell you who's being looked at on the list to replace him.
[02:34:38.224 --> 02:34:40.666]  Some of the names, though, are quite frightening.
[02:34:41.306 --> 02:34:50.493]  So, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to give you a big data dump from Stone's sources in the White House, but also my sources and sources on Capitol Hill.
[02:34:50.493 --> 02:34:54.256]  All this is coming up in the third hour.
[02:34:54.256 --> 02:34:58.679]  All this is coming up at the end of the third hour into the fourth hour.
[02:34:58.679 --> 02:35:04.044]  This is all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, in the fourth hour with Roger Stone.
[02:35:04.044 --> 02:35:05.345]  I want to go back to Owen Schroer.
[02:35:05.345 --> 02:35:06.706]  I want to go back to their guests.
[02:35:06.706 --> 02:35:10.288]  I want to go back to David Knight here in just a moment.
[02:35:10.288 --> 02:35:10.789]  But first,
[02:35:12.265 --> 02:35:14.588]  Obviously, we're about to launch new shows.
[02:35:14.588 --> 02:35:17.211]  Obviously, we are trying to hire more people.
[02:35:17.211 --> 02:35:18.973]  Obviously, we're having a lot of contests.
[02:35:18.973 --> 02:35:22.798]  Obviously, we're in the eye of the storm going up against the globalists right now.
[02:35:22.798 --> 02:35:27.323]  And it's so important for everybody to continue to pray for Infowars, but also pray for President Trump.
[02:35:27.323 --> 02:35:28.304]  Pray for this Republic.
[02:35:28.945 --> 02:35:30.366]  Because we're the targets.
[02:35:30.366 --> 02:35:37.892]  If they can destroy us, they believe the mouthpieces will be gone, and that will intimidate you, and that we'll have leaderless movement here.
[02:35:37.892 --> 02:35:39.313]  We all know that's not the case.
[02:35:39.313 --> 02:35:40.494]  Liberty's popular.
[02:35:40.494 --> 02:35:42.416]  You can't hold it down like a beach ball underwater.
[02:35:42.416 --> 02:35:44.718]  It's going to get back to the surface with amazing pressure.
[02:35:44.718 --> 02:35:51.603]  But financial support is so critical, and I want people to experience how good these supplements and nutraceuticals are.
[02:35:51.603 --> 02:35:58.329]  I want people to experience what X2 has done for me, because I was obviously deficient in bioavailable, true, pure, clean iodine.
[02:36:00.009 --> 02:36:12.734]  I was obviously having gut issues when I started getting on probiotics a few years ago, and then I got on MycoZx, which only I take a few times a year, and it goes in and knocks out the yeast, the mold, the fungus, you name it, which is the whole other side of the equation.
[02:36:12.734 --> 02:36:15.774]  The bacteria, it was the other side of the equation.
[02:36:15.774 --> 02:36:17.275]  People know how great probiotics are.
[02:36:17.275 --> 02:36:18.635]  We have Biome Defense.
[02:36:18.635 --> 02:36:23.697]  It's at full price because it's about to sell out, but MycoZx is so powerful, and I want you to have it.
[02:36:23.697 --> 02:36:24.757]  It's 46% off, even though
[02:36:26.818 --> 02:36:33.100]  It's been a great seller and has 500 plus reviews, 4.8 stars from third-party sites.
[02:36:33.100 --> 02:36:39.362]  I want you to have MycoZx because if you don't have a yeast, candida, or fungus or mold problem, then it's fine.
[02:36:39.362 --> 02:36:42.464]  It's just really good concentrated herbs and things that are good for you overall.
[02:36:42.464 --> 02:36:49.806]  But if you do, which they admit is an epidemic out there, not just in humans, but in bats are dying, people are getting brain tumors from funguses.
[02:36:49.806 --> 02:36:51.847]  I mean, it's mutating, it's out of control.
[02:36:53.188 --> 02:36:54.508]  Microzx is so incredible.
[02:36:54.508 --> 02:36:57.609]  At 46% off, it's almost a lost leader.
[02:36:57.609 --> 02:36:58.669]  Because we have 100% markup.
[02:36:58.669 --> 02:36:59.389]  Sounds like a lot.
[02:36:59.389 --> 02:37:01.150]  In supplements, it's five or seven times usually.
[02:37:01.150 --> 02:37:02.170]  We don't do that.
[02:37:02.170 --> 02:37:04.711]  That's why we have super high quality products in it.
[02:37:04.711 --> 02:37:08.512]  But right now, you know, with it at that price, it's almost half off.
[02:37:08.512 --> 02:37:09.692]  So we make a few bucks on it.
[02:37:09.692 --> 02:37:11.452]  I want you to experience it.
[02:37:11.452 --> 02:37:13.993]  Sign up for AutoShip, an additional 10% off.
[02:37:13.993 --> 02:37:16.213]  And then fullworkstore.com, cancel anytime.
[02:37:16.213 --> 02:37:18.634]  It's every 15, every 30, every three months, every nine months.
[02:37:18.634 --> 02:37:21.095]  Again, cancel anytime, an additional 10% off.
[02:37:21.095 --> 02:37:22.255]  And the biggest sale right now,
[02:37:23.615 --> 02:37:27.738]  60 plus percent off, 66 percent off retail.
[02:37:27.738 --> 02:37:30.100]  So it's $9.95 silver bullet, the exact same stuff.
[02:37:30.100 --> 02:37:32.741]  It's private labeled at Whole Foods for $19.
[02:37:32.741 --> 02:37:35.243]  When it's on sale, usually $24.
[02:37:35.243 --> 02:37:42.488]  It is, ladies and gentlemen, $9.95 silver bullet, 30 parts per million, made by the biggest lab in the United States.
[02:37:42.488 --> 02:37:43.388]  Super high quality.
[02:37:43.388 --> 02:37:46.471]  You got to watch some of the other silvers because they can be too strong.
[02:37:46.471 --> 02:37:47.851]  People say, oh, yeah, well, I don't care.
[02:37:47.851 --> 02:37:48.412]  I want it, you know.
[02:37:49.642 --> 02:37:52.905]  However, billion parts per million or whatever, it gets toxic at that level.
[02:37:52.905 --> 02:37:54.486]  But consult your own physician.
[02:37:54.486 --> 02:37:57.989]  It's believed by most experts, 30 parts is what you want, it's the optimal level between.
[02:37:57.989 --> 02:38:05.755]  Let's face it, you know, something that's going to kill viruses and bacteria, I mean, you know, it's Mother Nature antibiotic, but it doesn't have problems.
[02:38:05.755 --> 02:38:10.219]  Of course, the ancients talked about silver bullets, you know, being good or whatever, silver crosses.
[02:38:10.219 --> 02:38:12.621]  Everybody knew silver was good, warded off evil.
[02:38:12.621 --> 02:38:14.803]  They didn't know why, they just associated it with health.
[02:38:14.803 --> 02:38:15.483]  Now we know why.
[02:38:16.884 --> 02:38:19.025]  Mainline science is adopting silver now.
[02:38:19.025 --> 02:38:20.766]  We've been promoting it 20 plus years.
[02:38:20.766 --> 02:38:23.008]  But now you notice, finally, they admit we're all right.
[02:38:23.008 --> 02:38:25.409]  Employable silver is super, super awesome.
[02:38:25.409 --> 02:38:27.730]  I mean, it's the big rage for years now.
[02:38:27.730 --> 02:38:32.153]  We've got high quality, very low price, 66% off, and it funds what we're doing.
[02:38:32.153 --> 02:38:33.754]  So again, thank you all for what you're doing.
[02:38:34.614 --> 02:38:39.157]  We also have the CNN is fake news shirts with InfoWars.com's real news.
[02:38:39.157 --> 02:38:42.459]  Great way to meet like-minded people, to spread the word.
[02:38:42.459 --> 02:38:46.362]  But you know, not as bold as wearing a Trump shirt, but you can still meet like-minded people and stuff.
[02:38:46.362 --> 02:38:50.445]  For folks who don't want to be that bold, the InfoWars shirt's the way to go, because everybody hates CNN.
[02:38:50.445 --> 02:38:55.328]  At least 94% of folks, according to polls, 6% trust mainstream media.
[02:38:55.328 --> 02:38:58.110]  So again, InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.
[02:38:58.110 --> 02:39:00.711]  InfoWarsLife.com is a supplement site.
[02:39:00.711 --> 02:39:02.673]  Or we'll answer all your questions, tell you about other specials.
[02:39:02.673 --> 02:39:03.874]  There's a lot of them running right now.
[02:39:05.655 --> 02:39:09.937]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:39:09.937 --> 02:39:15.420]  All the sales end on the 1st, so next Monday they're going to have to end.
[02:39:15.420 --> 02:39:17.562]  And some things are going to end already because we're selling out of them.
[02:39:17.562 --> 02:39:23.245]  Super Mel Vitality, X2, a lot of the products are completely sold out.
[02:39:23.245 --> 02:39:27.467]  So again, a lot of the products that our own sell right now, like the air filters at $149, at $400 they're a deal.
[02:39:27.467 --> 02:39:28.088]  We sell them for $218 usually.
[02:39:32.190 --> 02:39:34.433]  And make like $60 on them.
[02:39:34.433 --> 02:39:34.453]  $70.
[02:39:34.453 --> 02:39:36.135]  Well, now we're making like $20.
[02:39:36.135 --> 02:39:39.498]  I mean, these are amazing Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:39:39.498 --> 02:39:40.399]  Super high quality.
[02:39:40.399 --> 02:39:41.601]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:39:41.601 --> 02:39:44.304]  Just a few years ago, these were like $1,000 a piece, similar units.
[02:39:44.304 --> 02:39:48.288]  Now, because of cost going down, miniaturization, these are still a deal at $200, but they're $149 right now.
[02:39:48.288 --> 02:39:48.869]  Competitors are $400 or more.
[02:39:52.588 --> 02:39:57.353]  Very similar units that have the same technology and handle the same square footage.
[02:39:57.353 --> 02:39:58.674]  These are really high quality.
[02:39:58.674 --> 02:40:00.376]  InfowarStore.com.
[02:40:00.376 --> 02:40:04.120]  There's discounts on water filtration, 30% right now as well.
[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:11.048]  So shopping with us, use this free market to get things you need that help you have a better life and from the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[02:40:11.048 --> 02:40:12.029]  But again, next hour...
[02:40:12.549 --> 02:40:13.470]  Tell everybody.
[02:40:13.470 --> 02:40:15.531]  Roger Stone, the big exclusive.
[02:40:15.531 --> 02:40:16.432]  Trump is moving.
[02:40:16.432 --> 02:40:18.033]  He's doing what the people want.
[02:40:18.033 --> 02:40:20.614]  He's doing what justice demands, moving against them.
[02:40:20.614 --> 02:40:27.759]  And it's not like Nixon, who got caught admitting he was doing corrupt stuff, that was still like one one-millionth of what the Clintons and Obamas have done.
[02:40:27.759 --> 02:40:28.380]  Still, it was wrong.
[02:40:30.458 --> 02:40:37.504]  This is where they're making stuff up to stop Trump, to stop our election, and stop our return of control over the government to our own system.
[02:40:50.034 --> 02:40:50.914]  No quarter.
[02:40:50.914 --> 02:40:52.215]  They want violent civil war.
[02:40:52.215 --> 02:40:53.095]  They're coming after us.
[02:40:53.095 --> 02:40:54.115]  They want to arrest us.
[02:40:54.115 --> 02:40:55.336]  They want to kill Trump.
[02:40:55.336 --> 02:40:57.276]  They love killing babies.
[02:40:57.276 --> 02:40:58.196]  You know, they love evil.
[02:40:58.196 --> 02:40:58.937]  They love Satan.
[02:40:58.937 --> 02:40:59.997]  I mean, they really are evil.
[02:40:59.997 --> 02:41:01.137]  Just watch TV.
[02:41:01.137 --> 02:41:01.957]  Watch MTV.
[02:41:01.957 --> 02:41:03.258]  Watch Hollywood.
[02:41:03.258 --> 02:41:05.538]  It is a cult of mentally ill scum that want to rule us.
[02:41:05.538 --> 02:41:06.639]  And it's us or them.
[02:41:06.639 --> 02:41:07.779]  We're winning politically.
[02:41:07.779 --> 02:41:13.561]  But we need to go ahead and give Trump the backing with a G to put these criminals in prison.
[02:41:13.561 --> 02:41:15.461]  Infowars.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:15.461 --> 02:41:18.202]  Now back to the live transmission from the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:41:18.662 --> 02:41:26.027]  And it's the liberal media and the people that have infiltrated this government to take America down that started the Civil War.
[02:41:26.027 --> 02:41:27.908]  That's who started the Civil War.
[02:41:27.908 --> 02:41:29.569]  That's why we elected Trump.
[02:41:29.569 --> 02:41:30.849]  We are doing it peacefully.
[02:41:30.849 --> 02:41:31.910]  We are doing it politically.
[02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:34.371]  The left is trying to do it violently.
[02:41:34.371 --> 02:41:41.236]  That's why when I saw the story on Newsweek saying that Alex Jones is calling for a Civil War, I was just fully triggered, like, that's total bull!
[02:41:41.236 --> 02:41:43.497]  Kathy Griffin is the one that had to sever Trump's head.
[02:41:43.757 --> 02:41:47.519]  The left is the one that depicts Donald Trump being assassinated.
[02:41:47.519 --> 02:41:55.144]  It's the Democrats and Republicans colluding with one another, bringing down America for the last decades that won the Civil War and brought in Obamacare.
[02:41:55.144 --> 02:42:00.388]  But real quick, as Roger Stone is about to have groundbreaking news here at 2 p.m.
[02:42:00.388 --> 02:42:02.129]  Central here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:03.956 --> 02:42:06.077]  The left is cornered, folks.
[02:42:06.077 --> 02:42:10.738]  Now, this isn't what the picture that's being painted right now by the mainstream media, but this is the accurate picture.
[02:42:10.738 --> 02:42:16.240]  The left is completely cornered, and President Trump is ready to put them in the corner with his gloves up.
[02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:17.620]  Gloves off, as well.
[02:42:17.620 --> 02:42:20.841]  That's why he brought in Scaramucci as communications director.
[02:42:20.841 --> 02:42:24.042]  He's going to be dictating the terms of communication.
[02:42:24.042 --> 02:42:28.964]  He's going to be dictating the terms of what news is being spoken of, what is coming out of Washington.
[02:42:29.304 --> 02:42:34.467]  Pretty soon, don't be surprised if that's negative press about Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[02:42:34.467 --> 02:42:39.471]  You've got Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz smashing servers, deleting emails.
[02:42:39.471 --> 02:42:49.017]  Wasserman Schultz had her hard drive seized from the FBI now, as well as the Awan brothers who were working with Democrats, including Hillary Clinton.
[02:42:49.497 --> 02:42:51.277]  They tried to smash those hard drives.
[02:42:51.277 --> 02:42:53.478]  They've now been seized by the FBI.
[02:42:53.478 --> 02:43:00.220]  And Awan Brothers and Debbie Wasserman Schultz have threatened authorities who dare do their job.
[02:43:00.220 --> 02:43:01.740]  We have them cornered.
[02:43:01.740 --> 02:43:12.723]  That's why President Trump wants to bring in a new AG because he wants an AG that's going to get in the ring and put these scum where they belong in the corner and pummel them into submission.
[02:43:13.732 --> 02:43:19.215]  You know, we had Alex talking about how Roger Stone is coming up in, what is it now, about 15 minutes.
[02:43:19.215 --> 02:43:22.537]  He's going to be talking about what's going to be happening in the White House.
[02:43:22.537 --> 02:43:28.180]  There's a shake-up going on there, and there has to be a shake-up in the White House if we're going to do a shake-up in Washington, D.C.
[02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:30.501]  Yesterday we had this story come out from the AP.
[02:43:30.501 --> 02:43:33.182]  Trump speaks to advisers about firing Sessions.
[02:43:33.182 --> 02:43:36.404]  Well, one of Trump's longest advisers is Roger Stone.
[02:43:36.404 --> 02:43:37.765]  He's going to be breaking down
[02:43:38.345 --> 02:43:42.788]  What's going to be coming up and possible replacements for Jeff Sessions.
[02:43:42.788 --> 02:43:50.273]  But this is what AP said yesterday as he continues to rage against Sessions' decisions to recuse himself from all matters related to the Russia investigation.
[02:43:50.273 --> 02:43:59.719]  So Trump has speculated aloud to allies in recent days about the potential consequences of firing Sessions according to three people who've recently spoke to the President.
[02:43:59.719 --> 02:44:00.300]  So we're going to have
[02:44:00.680 --> 02:44:06.385]  The real information, we're going to have the scoop for AP when Roger Stone joins us in about 15 minutes.
[02:44:06.385 --> 02:44:13.732]  But I want to read for you something here from McClatchy, because McClatchy is not a pro-Trump, it's not a libertarian or conservative source.
[02:44:15.011 --> 02:44:16.633]  This is mainstream media.
[02:44:16.633 --> 02:44:18.175]  And here's what they point out.
[02:44:18.175 --> 02:44:23.763]  They said Trump's messages with Sessions and Senators are not pleased with that, okay?
[02:44:23.763 --> 02:44:25.846]  They don't want him messing with Sessions.
[02:44:25.846 --> 02:44:29.831]  They say, you don't pick a fight with one of the Senate's guys.
[02:44:29.831 --> 02:44:31.554]  One of the Senators said, I don't understand it.
[02:44:31.894 --> 02:44:35.739]  There's no honorable person, more honorable person that I've met in my life than Jeff Sessions.
[02:44:35.739 --> 02:44:38.162]  It's not about whether or not he's an honorable person.
[02:44:38.162 --> 02:44:40.985]  It's not about whether or not he's right on some key issues.
[02:44:40.985 --> 02:44:46.852]  It's about the fact that he won't move forward with locking up criminals who need to be
[02:44:47.553 --> 02:44:52.537]  And they shouldn't get a pass simply because they're Washington insiders.
[02:44:52.537 --> 02:45:00.143]  And here's what they said in this McClatchy article that I think really distills it and shows the problem even though they don't acknowledge it as a problem.
[02:45:00.143 --> 02:45:00.403]  They said,
[02:45:07.389 --> 02:45:14.693]  He understood and doggedly practiced the code of what's been called the world's most exclusive club.
[02:45:14.693 --> 02:45:25.060]  You can disagree without being disagreeable, but you protect the institution and its members.
[02:45:25.060 --> 02:45:29.182]  Is that why he won't go after the people who are criminals?
[02:45:29.182 --> 02:45:31.383]  The people who have violated the law?
[02:45:31.383 --> 02:45:33.385]  The people inside the FBI and others?
[02:45:34.105 --> 02:45:35.386]  It's an insider club.
[02:45:35.386 --> 02:45:38.067]  You can't have somebody with that mentality.
[02:45:38.067 --> 02:45:41.809]  Hopefully, Trump is going to pick someone who will not play by those rules.
[02:45:41.809 --> 02:45:45.131]  They go on the next session, they say, well Trump clearly doesn't play by those rules.
[02:45:45.131 --> 02:45:47.992]  No, we don't want to see people playing by those rules.
[02:45:47.992 --> 02:45:49.533]  If somebody is breaking the law,
[02:45:49.813 --> 02:45:52.014]  You come after them.
[02:45:52.014 --> 02:46:17.605]  Instead of trying to break the 9th and 10th Amendment and to shut down the states that have had civil asset forfeiture reform to protect our right to private property, instead of coming after people who are using marijuana for medical purposes, he ought to be going after the criminals in Washington who are trying to subvert our election, trying to organize a coup against Donald Trump, and who ought to be prosecuted even if they weren't coming after Donald Trump because they broke the law.
[02:46:17.865 --> 02:46:23.687]  And I think that Ty Cobb, the new lawyer appointed by Trump, is also evidence of that.
[02:46:23.687 --> 02:46:25.068]  And this is what you're saying, David.
[02:46:25.068 --> 02:46:26.488]  This is what Washington is saying.
[02:46:26.488 --> 02:46:29.509]  This is what you just broke down.
[02:46:29.509 --> 02:46:37.292]  The mindset of Congress, the mindset of DC, the mindset of the political establishment is us versus them.
[02:46:37.292 --> 02:46:38.813]  We have our mandate.
[02:46:38.813 --> 02:46:40.113]  We're in the club.
[02:46:40.113 --> 02:46:41.494]  We're on the hill.
[02:46:41.494 --> 02:46:42.774]  We dictate policy.
[02:46:42.774 --> 02:46:43.755]  We dictate the future.
[02:46:44.155 --> 02:46:46.236]  If you go back to the confirmation hearings for Sessions,
[02:47:08.803 --> 02:47:13.188]  It was a big deal that Cory Booker criticized Sessions.
[02:47:26.849 --> 02:47:38.891]  Adamantly opposed to him, and even though Cory Booker may have been doing this, and we know he was doing it because he wants to run for president, so it was a political opportunity, but they were saying, no, no, no, this is an inside, and this is exactly what McClatchy said.
[02:47:38.891 --> 02:47:40.052]  They were right about this.
[02:47:40.052 --> 02:47:41.612]  It is an inside club.
[02:47:41.612 --> 02:47:45.133]  It's an institution that you don't criticize because you're part of it.
[02:47:45.133 --> 02:47:46.353]  Remember George Carlin?
[02:47:46.353 --> 02:47:49.093]  It's a club, and you're not a member, okay?
[02:47:49.093 --> 02:47:56.715]  Well, he is a member of the club, and that's why he won't go after the members who break the rules that are supposed to apply to all of us, and that's a big problem.
[02:47:56.935 --> 02:48:00.358]  And you saw the headline on the Washington Post saying Scaramucci says he's going to fire everybody.
[02:48:00.358 --> 02:48:01.539]  Breitbart just published this.
[02:48:01.539 --> 02:48:05.582]  Scaramucci terminates suspected leaker Michael Short from the White House.
[02:48:05.582 --> 02:48:09.145]  And I want you guys to pull up that other Washington Post story that you had up a second ago.
[02:48:09.145 --> 02:48:14.149]  The headline was, Trump leaves people whirling in the wind.
[02:48:14.149 --> 02:48:15.170]  Twisting in the wind.
[02:48:15.170 --> 02:48:16.311]  Twisting in the wind.
[02:48:16.311 --> 02:48:17.112]  I love this.
[02:48:17.112 --> 02:48:18.093]  I love this.
[02:48:18.093 --> 02:48:21.095]  Trump leaves session twisting in the wind while berating him publicly.
[02:48:21.095 --> 02:48:22.096]  No folks, here's the truth.
[02:48:22.096 --> 02:48:22.476]  Here's the truth.
[02:48:22.476 --> 02:48:23.817]  Try to make it sound like a lynching.
[02:48:23.817 --> 02:48:24.338]  Here's the truth.
[02:48:24.778 --> 02:48:31.402]  President Trump is probably talking to Sessions, and Session knows what's going on, and Trump is saying, look, I gotta trade ya.
[02:48:31.402 --> 02:48:35.824]  I need a pitcher, you're a power hitter, I gotta trade ya, I gotta bring someone else in.
[02:48:35.824 --> 02:48:43.429]  So they probably already know that this is going on, and everything that you're seeing in public is President Trump twisting the Washington Post by the wind!
[02:48:43.849 --> 02:48:45.370]  That's what's going on!
[02:48:45.370 --> 02:48:49.213]  So now, Scaramucci is going to purge the White House of the leakers.
[02:48:49.213 --> 02:48:53.075]  Trump is the one dictating the news now by what he's saying on Twitter.
[02:48:53.075 --> 02:48:56.517]  It's the Washington Post that's twisting in the wind!
[02:48:56.517 --> 02:48:57.998]  It's the Amazon Post!
[02:48:57.998 --> 02:48:59.299]  It's the New York Times!
[02:48:59.299 --> 02:49:01.721]  It's the fake news that's trying to attack Trump!
[02:49:01.721 --> 02:49:02.361]  The CNNs!
[02:49:02.361 --> 02:49:03.662]  The MSNBCs!
[02:49:03.662 --> 02:49:05.263]  They're the ones twisting in the wind!
[02:49:05.623 --> 02:49:08.044]  They're the ones that can't figure out what's going on.
[02:49:08.044 --> 02:49:10.045]  They're the ones that can't be proven right.
[02:49:10.045 --> 02:49:12.507]  They're the ones that keep putting out these talking points.
[02:49:12.507 --> 02:49:14.888]  Trump Russia, Trump this, Trump that.
[02:49:14.888 --> 02:49:16.429]  Falls on deaf ears.
[02:49:16.429 --> 02:49:20.271]  So they're the ones twisting in the wind, not the Trump administration.
[02:49:20.271 --> 02:49:23.332]  And I think that we're finally starting to see this move.
[02:49:23.332 --> 02:49:25.053]  We're starting to see this momentum.
[02:49:25.053 --> 02:49:26.494]  Trump taking the gloves off.
[02:49:26.494 --> 02:49:27.895]  The Democrats are cornered.
[02:49:27.895 --> 02:49:31.477]  He's now got to put the right people in place to bring these people to justice, David.
[02:49:31.477 --> 02:49:33.998]  And it might not happen quick, but I think we're starting to see the movement.
[02:49:34.338 --> 02:49:39.826]  You know, we talk about the Washington Post or the Amazon Washington Post.
[02:49:39.826 --> 02:49:41.448]  We call them the Amazon Post or whatever.
[02:49:41.448 --> 02:49:43.331]  Maybe they're the CIA Post.
[02:49:43.331 --> 02:49:46.856]  We've talked about the connection, the $600 million contract.
[02:49:46.856 --> 02:49:49.680]  We're talking about that and how the leaks seem to always originate.
[02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:51.621]  Uh, with the Washington Post.
[02:49:51.621 --> 02:49:56.182]  Maybe they should change the headline, the sub-headline, which is kind of strange.
[02:49:56.182 --> 02:50:00.283]  Uh, you know, Washington Post, democracy dies in the dark state.
[02:50:00.283 --> 02:50:02.064]  Maybe that's really what they should have there.
[02:50:02.064 --> 02:50:03.924]  They should say, we killed democracy.
[02:50:03.924 --> 02:50:05.565]  We killed journalism, Washington Post.
[02:50:05.745 --> 02:50:10.129]  Let's talk about this Michael Short firing because Scaramucci got rid of this guy.
[02:50:10.129 --> 02:50:15.693]  This is somebody who is an ally of Reince Priebus and he said, I've not been involved in any leaks.
[02:50:15.693 --> 02:50:18.295]  Allegations I ever leaked anything are demonstrably false.
[02:50:18.295 --> 02:50:20.657]  However, let's talk about the fact that he was
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:23.322]  Where this guy came from.
[02:50:23.322 --> 02:50:26.545]  And this is a story that was reported by Politico.
[02:50:26.545 --> 02:50:32.833]  They say he was closely aligned with Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who resigned on Friday after Scaramucci was appointed to the communications role.
[02:50:32.833 --> 02:50:35.496]  He was scorned by many of his colleagues.
[02:50:35.496 --> 02:50:36.317]  Why?
[02:50:36.317 --> 02:50:37.919]  Because he quit the Trump campaign
[02:50:38.539 --> 02:50:42.745]  Only to rejoin as a White House staffer because of Priebus.
[02:50:42.745 --> 02:50:51.397]  They said in a story told by campaign staffers, they arrived at Trump Tower one morning months before the election to find his laptop open saying, I've resigned and he just left.
[02:50:51.397 --> 02:50:53.119]  And then they said the next time they saw him,
[02:50:54.020 --> 02:51:01.485]  As was as a campaign with his fellow campaign staffers was in January when Primus had brought him in as their supervisor.
[02:51:01.485 --> 02:51:03.066]  This is the problem folks.
[02:51:03.066 --> 02:51:04.087]  This is what's being addressed.
[02:51:04.087 --> 02:51:04.887]  Stay with us.

[02:54:38.001 --> 02:54:43.705]  This is President Trump speaking to 40,000 Boy Scouts of America.
[02:54:43.705 --> 02:54:46.346]  Hey, what am I gonna do?
[02:54:46.346 --> 02:54:48.247]  He sounds like a nice person.
[02:54:48.247 --> 02:54:50.869]  He, he, he, he.
[02:54:50.869 --> 02:54:51.449]  Thank you.
[02:54:51.449 --> 02:54:52.470]  I do, I do love you.
[02:55:07.995 --> 02:55:12.799]  Never seen this type of energy for a politician in years, folks, since Reagan.
[02:55:12.799 --> 02:55:14.840]  And even this is greater, probably.
[02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:17.262]  Yeah, we never saw 20,000 people show up to hear Reagan speak.
[02:55:17.262 --> 02:55:19.444]  By the way, just a question.
[02:55:19.444 --> 02:55:29.071]  Did President Obama ever come to a jamboree?
[02:55:29.071 --> 02:55:31.513]  Just a regular event for Trump, you know, 20,000, 40,000 people, no big deal.
[02:55:34.073 --> 02:55:36.798]  Look at all those Russians.
[02:55:36.798 --> 02:55:38.120]  The Boy Scouts of Russia!
[02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:41.126]  And we'll be back.
[02:55:41.126 --> 02:55:42.208]  We'll be back.
[02:55:42.208 --> 02:55:44.352]  The answer is no, but we'll be back.
[02:55:47.884 --> 02:55:49.826]  So, President Trump is popular, folks.
[02:55:49.826 --> 02:55:56.513]  I'm telling you, that freaks the establishment out, that the youth loves President Trump and would boo Barack Obama.
[02:55:56.513 --> 02:55:57.794]  But it's amazing, you know?
[02:55:57.794 --> 02:56:00.437]  Yeah, they called it, it looked like a Hitler youth rally.
[02:56:00.437 --> 02:56:02.599]  Yeah, they're saying it was a white supremacy rally.
[02:56:02.599 --> 02:56:04.201]  It's a bunch of Boy Scouts of America.
[02:56:04.201 --> 02:56:05.082]  These people are sick.
[02:56:05.422 --> 02:56:15.132]  But it's funny because we went from Barack Obama saying, you didn't build that, you didn't build that business, to President Trump saying, you can build and be anything that you want to be.
[02:56:15.132 --> 02:56:19.957]  So that's a great difference right there between President Trump and President Obama.
[02:56:19.957 --> 02:56:25.883]  You've got the S&P hitting record highs today, Bloomberg article talking about unemployment near a 16-year low.
[02:56:27.744 --> 02:56:30.285]  Job market confidence is up.
[02:56:30.285 --> 02:56:34.465]  America's labor market is the best it's been since before Obama.
[02:56:34.465 --> 02:56:35.485]  Shocker there.
[02:56:35.485 --> 02:56:37.106]  You've got a lot of jobs being created.
[02:56:37.106 --> 02:56:42.487]  So all of that is good news and that's why the future is excited for President Trump and what he might bring.
[02:56:42.487 --> 02:56:52.709]  And we're excited for the future here at InfoWars.com and that's because you have funded us at InfoWarsStore.com and because of that we are running one of our biggest specials ever.

[02:57:52.270 --> 02:57:59.611]  Well, we're about to have Roger Stone joining us at 8 after in the next hour, and he's going to be breaking the big news.
[02:57:59.611 --> 02:58:02.472]  But right now, David, I think that it's the Democrats that are being
[02:58:03.677 --> 02:58:04.277]  I don't think so.
[02:58:22.276 --> 02:58:23.136]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:49.215 --> 02:58:51.423]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:56.848 --> 02:58:58.449]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[02:59:47.501 --> 02:59:48.642]  That means it's pure.

[02:59:51.525 --> 02:59:54.328]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:59:54.328 --> 03:00:00.735]  Take action now before... You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.619 --> 03:00:16.882]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:00:16.882 --> 03:00:22.106]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[03:00:22.106 --> 03:00:23.627]  Russia, Russia, Russia!
[03:00:23.627 --> 03:00:25.389]  Trump, Trump, Trump!
[03:00:25.389 --> 03:00:28.852]  No, it's gonna end up being Ukraine and Hillary Clinton.
[03:00:28.852 --> 03:00:30.493]  Mark my words on that.
[03:00:30.493 --> 03:00:36.518]  We had Lee Stranahan breaking that down earlier on the broadcast as well as the George Soros involvements with that.
[03:00:36.518 --> 03:00:37.299]  But tomorrow,
[03:00:38.635 --> 03:00:46.937]  The Judiciary Committee will convene a hearing to examine enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and attempts to influence U.S.
[03:00:46.937 --> 03:00:47.798]  elections.
[03:00:47.798 --> 03:00:51.959]  This is coming from Senator Chuck Grassley's official website.
[03:00:51.959 --> 03:00:55.200]  Grassley raises further concerns over foreign agent registration.
[03:00:55.640 --> 03:01:00.464]  Report alleges DNC consultant involved in presidential election work with Ukraine.
[03:01:00.464 --> 03:01:01.925]  He published that yesterday.
[03:01:01.925 --> 03:01:03.906]  The hearing will be tomorrow.
[03:01:03.906 --> 03:01:07.569]  You know that Chuck Grassley is going to raise awareness of this, David.
[03:01:07.569 --> 03:01:08.590]  He's been raising awareness.
[03:01:08.590 --> 03:01:14.814]  In fact, I was saying outside the break, if we just had 50 senators like Chuck Grassley, this country would be a lot better off.
[03:01:14.814 --> 03:01:18.016]  The story is getting traction now about what's happening with Ukraine.
[03:01:18.016 --> 03:01:18.577]  We had Trump
[03:01:19.097 --> 03:01:20.158]  Tweet this out today.
[03:01:20.158 --> 03:01:26.104]  Immediately got pushed back against that by Reuters, but we had Lee Stranahan on.
[03:01:26.104 --> 03:01:27.585]  He's been talking about this a very long time.
[03:01:27.585 --> 03:01:32.189]  Politico had the story out in January, but now it is gradually beginning to get traction.
[03:01:32.189 --> 03:01:44.640]  But it's going to explode, especially if we have a change in Attorney General and we get somebody who is going to come after these criminals and really, truly investigate the hard evidences here.
[03:01:44.640 --> 03:01:44.981]  And again,
[03:01:45.481 --> 03:01:52.507]  If you didn't see that interview with Lee Stranahan, we're going to post his article as well as the interview embedded in that at InfoWars.com.
[03:01:52.507 --> 03:02:06.740]  A very important story breaking down how a serial bomber, after he gets out, joins forces, becomes a money bag man for the DNC, bringing in these foreign agents who are then working to subvert our election.
[03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:08.800]  That's how hardcore the evidence is.
[03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:14.442]  The Democrats have always been guilty of the crimes that they project onto others.
[03:02:14.442 --> 03:02:16.502]  That's what this Russian situation is.
[03:02:16.502 --> 03:02:18.463]  I've always said it's a red herring.
[03:02:18.463 --> 03:02:25.505]  It is something that you use to drag across the trail to throw the foxhounds off of what the real crime is.
[03:02:25.505 --> 03:02:29.886]  And now it looks like Trump is getting serious about going after these people saying, hey,
[03:02:30.286 --> 03:02:36.234]  Attorney General Sessions, if you're not going to expose what happened with Ukraine and Hillary Clinton, I'll get somebody who will.
[03:02:36.234 --> 03:02:40.921]  And he absolutely has to do it, or they're going to take him down, they're going to paralyze the regime.
[03:02:40.921 --> 03:02:45.968]  And tonight on the Nightly News, we're going to talk about the Russian sanctions that are now being pushed out.
[03:02:46.388 --> 03:02:57.783]  It's very important to understand how they're going to box President Trump into a corner but even more importantly create a world war as far as trade goes because the EU is going to be affected by this.
[03:02:57.783 --> 03:03:01.388]  The EU is saying if you enact these Russian sanctions we're going to enact
[03:03:02.269 --> 03:03:05.471]  Retaliatory trade sanctions against the U.S.
[03:03:05.471 --> 03:03:10.555]  because we're talking about shutting down their supply of gas that they buy from the Russians.
[03:03:10.555 --> 03:03:12.956]  So this is a very complicated situation.
[03:03:12.956 --> 03:03:14.777]  They're trying to enact these sanctions.
[03:03:14.777 --> 03:03:18.920]  They're offering the carrot to the Republicans saying, hey, we can overturn this Iranian thing.
[03:03:18.920 --> 03:03:26.125]  There's a better way to do that without boxing Trump into this and shutting down his ability to remove sanctions against anyone.
[03:03:26.405 --> 03:03:37.254]  So you've got Project Veritas exposing the Democrat Party for terroristic behavior, and now you've got Democrats colluding with a serial bomb maker, a terrorist.
[03:03:37.254 --> 03:03:37.914]  So there you go.
[03:03:37.914 --> 03:03:39.535]  But Trump is the bad guy, folks.
[03:03:39.535 --> 03:03:41.257]  It's all Trump's fault.
[03:03:41.257 --> 03:03:43.539]  Look at Trump, look at Russia, look over here.
[03:03:43.539 --> 03:03:43.659]  No.
[03:03:44.980 --> 03:03:48.262]  I'm telling you, it was the weirdest thing for me, David.
[03:03:48.262 --> 03:04:02.672]  On Sunday night, I was sitting there and I was thinking about what Trump can do, what the Trump administration can do to change the tide and to move things in the opposite direction, instead of against him, but against his opponents.
[03:04:02.672 --> 03:04:08.917]  And I was thinking, what Trump needs is a young New York attorney who wants to make a name for himself and who has balls of steel.
[03:04:09.497 --> 03:04:12.721]  And I was thinking it was going to have to be a young guy who wanted to make a name for himself.
[03:04:12.721 --> 03:04:14.583]  But then Ty Cobb came around.
[03:04:14.583 --> 03:04:16.525]  Ty Cobb already made a name for himself.
[03:04:16.525 --> 03:04:18.247]  So Ty Cobb's already got the name.
[03:04:18.247 --> 03:04:19.709]  But then he even said it himself.
[03:04:19.709 --> 03:04:21.571]  He said, I have balls of steel.
[03:04:21.571 --> 03:04:23.353]  That's what Trump needs.
[03:04:23.353 --> 03:04:26.537]  Trump needs someone to put it all on the line and say, you know what?
[03:04:26.537 --> 03:04:29.661]  This is going to be ugly, but I'm going into the briar patch with you, Donald.
[03:04:30.001 --> 03:04:32.623]  And again, as we saw from McClatchy, they laid it out.
[03:04:32.623 --> 03:04:35.284]  They said, look, Jeff Sessions has been around a long time.
[03:04:35.284 --> 03:04:37.706]  He's very congenial.
[03:04:37.706 --> 03:04:39.767]  His colleagues, he's not going to criticize them.
[03:04:39.767 --> 03:04:42.509]  He's part of that club that we're not in.
[03:04:42.509 --> 03:04:48.793]  And people that are in that club, you know, just like James Comey said about Hillary Clinton, well, you know, don't you try this at home.
[03:04:49.433 --> 03:04:51.515]  But we're not going to come after Hillary Clinton.
[03:04:51.515 --> 03:04:53.857]  We'll take the guy who is a sailor on a sub.
[03:04:53.857 --> 03:04:58.742]  We'll lock him up for confidential pictures, but not her for above top secrets.
[03:04:58.742 --> 03:04:59.502]  Stay with us.
[03:04:59.502 --> 03:05:04.086]  Roger Stone is going to have breaking information about the shakeup at the White House.
[03:05:04.086 --> 03:05:05.628]  He's been an advisor for a long time to Trump.
[03:05:05.908 --> 03:05:15.797]  The Constitutional Convention of 1787 was held in strict secrecy, and at the end of the proceedings, citizens gathered outside Independence Hall to learn what had been produced behind closed doors.
[03:05:15.797 --> 03:05:19.980]  While Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall, a lady asked him, Well, Doctor, what have we got?
[03:05:19.980 --> 03:05:21.582]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:05:21.582 --> 03:05:24.544]  To which he responded, A republic, if you can keep it.
[03:05:24.544 --> 03:05:29.309]  But today, not only have we lost a republic, but most people don't even know what a republic even is.
[03:05:29.309 --> 03:05:31.851]  For one thing, a republic is not a democracy.
[03:05:32.031 --> 03:05:38.020]  A republic operates under the rule of law which protects individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority.
[03:05:38.020 --> 03:05:43.569]  Under a republic, the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws regardless of political power or lack thereof.
[03:05:43.569 --> 03:05:47.715]  Democracy, on the other hand, only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims of the public.
[03:05:47.895 --> 03:05:50.137]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:06:11.318 --> 03:06:24.285]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[03:06:24.285 --> 03:06:30.849]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[03:06:30.849 --> 03:06:33.310]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[03:06:33.370 --> 03:06:44.217]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[03:07:05.012 --> 03:07:10.579]  A new shipment of Bio-True Selenium is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:07:10.579 --> 03:07:12.041]  We've been sold out for months.
[03:07:12.041 --> 03:07:17.107]  Our one-of-a-kind InfoWarsLife Bio-True Selenium formula is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:07:17.107 --> 03:07:21.132]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[03:07:21.252 --> 03:07:25.778]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[03:07:25.778 --> 03:07:30.924]  But BioTrue Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[03:07:30.924 --> 03:07:34.408]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[03:07:34.408 --> 03:07:38.433]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[03:07:38.553 --> 03:07:46.640]  BioTruth Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[03:07:46.640 --> 03:07:51.544]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTruth Selenium before we sell it again.
[03:07:51.544 --> 03:08:00.051]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that not only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalists.
[03:08:00.051 --> 03:08:00.612]  A 360 win.
[03:08:00.612 --> 03:08:02.673]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[03:08:02.673 --> 03:08:04.195]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[03:08:04.195 --> 03:08:05.356]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:08:12.415 --> 03:08:16.597]  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:08:16.597 --> 03:08:27.021]  You're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[03:08:27.021 --> 03:08:29.402]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:08:29.402 --> 03:08:34.904]  And I'm with you for a special exclusive report here on InfoWars.
[03:08:34.904 --> 03:08:41.247]  Very important to understand what's happening in Washington regarding both Attorney General Sessions
[03:08:42.054 --> 03:08:52.259]  Possible shakeup at the White House and what is clearly a decision by President Trump to turn the tables and go on offense.
[03:08:52.259 --> 03:09:09.967]  It's important to understand before we get into the sessions matter that the FISA court declaration at the end of last year nails President Barack Obama and his entire front line on the Intel community for the illegal
[03:09:10.769 --> 03:09:21.513]  Unconstitutional, willful surveillance of tens of thousands of Americans for specifically political reasons.
[03:09:21.513 --> 03:09:31.677]  Coupling that with the massive scandals at the Clinton Foundation, Donald Trump has two major leverage points on his opponents.
[03:09:32.771 --> 03:09:41.338]  He can, never mind the Russian collusion delusion, turn the table on his tormentors.
[03:09:41.338 --> 03:09:51.926]  And his disappointment in Jeff Sessions is based on Sessions' either inability or unwillingness to do either.
[03:09:51.926 --> 03:10:01.273]  Now comes word from my sources that the president has decided to replace Mr. Sessions
[03:10:02.290 --> 03:10:11.818]  But the leading candidate for that position, at least as of this moment, is CIA Director Richard Pompeo.
[03:10:11.818 --> 03:10:15.401]  This is troubling for a number of reasons.
[03:10:15.401 --> 03:10:25.470]  First of all, Pompeo, who was a supporter of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks during the election, has become a captive of the mandarins at the CIA.
[03:10:28.663 --> 03:10:37.869]  Repeating the canard that there was some proof that WikiLeaks and Assange are cutouts for the Russians.
[03:10:37.869 --> 03:10:39.791]  This is false.
[03:10:39.791 --> 03:10:58.364]  And then there is even more troubling, Pompeo's speech to the Aspen Institute, widely praised by John Brennan, the CIA director under Barack Obama, in which he parroted, once again, the anti-Russian line.
[03:10:59.346 --> 03:11:23.214]  In view of the incredible progress the President is making on Syria by engaging a dialogue with the Russians, the appointment of a deep stater like Pompeo at Justice would seem to preclude the prosecutions of the Obama Intelligence Community, including, of course, the CIA.
[03:11:23.214 --> 03:11:27.596]  You heard it all first, here at InfoWars.
[03:11:27.596 --> 03:11:28.196]  Additionally,
[03:11:29.022 --> 03:11:40.354]  There is much speculation after the firing of Sean Spicer about the fate of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.
[03:11:40.354 --> 03:11:52.086]  First of all, the president deserves kudos, in my opinion, for the appointment of Sarah Huckabee Sanders as his chief spokeswoman and the White House press secretary.
[03:11:52.637 --> 03:11:55.419]  This is a strong appointment.
[03:11:55.419 --> 03:12:05.065]  She's been doing a much better job defending the President and speaking on his behalf than Spicer, and in my view, she well deserves the job.
[03:12:05.065 --> 03:12:09.748]  So congratulations to Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[03:12:09.748 --> 03:12:19.715]  In the meantime, however, it appears that there is a three-way decision that the President has before him regarding the White House Chief of Staff.
[03:12:21.065 --> 03:12:30.990]  On this list are David Urban, a decorated veteran, a former chief of staff on Capitol Hill, the U.S.
[03:12:30.990 --> 03:12:32.871]  Senator Arlen Specter.
[03:12:32.871 --> 03:12:42.435]  But nonetheless, a hardline Trump loyalist who ran the nuts and bolts campaign on the ground in Pennsylvania.
[03:12:42.435 --> 03:12:48.298]  Someone the president knows well and someone who has both administrative skills
[03:12:49.219 --> 03:12:51.800]  And political skills.
[03:12:51.800 --> 03:13:00.304]  Urban was the administrative assistant to perhaps the meanest, toughest, smartest, and most difficult member of the U.S.
[03:13:00.304 --> 03:13:03.025]  Senate, Arlen Specter.
[03:13:03.025 --> 03:13:16.791]  This does not in any way reflect the politics of Urban himself, who is a solid Trumpite from the beginning, and in my view, responsible for the historical win in Pennsylvania.
[03:13:17.902 --> 03:13:24.023]  Also, unbelievably, in the running is Dina Habib Howell.
[03:13:24.023 --> 03:13:42.788]  She is a former member of the George W. Bush White House staff, a certified globalist, her best friends Valerie Jarrett, also Huma Abedin, and then, of course, Condi Rice.
[03:13:43.852 --> 03:14:07.411]  She was very successful in squeezing Rick Grenell, another key Trump supporter, out of the position of NATO ambassador, delivering that to former Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a certified Trump hater, a never-Trumper, who had nothing good to say about candidate Trump during the election.
[03:14:08.544 --> 03:14:24.769]  And then also, a wild card, and you'll be hearing this first at InfoWars, General John Kelly, currently the head of Homeland Security, is also in contention for the position of White House Chief of Staff.
[03:14:25.811 --> 03:14:33.215]  Researching Kelly, the first thing that pops up is his status as an unreconstructed drug warrior.
[03:14:33.215 --> 03:14:51.106]  Someone who agrees with Jeff Sessions on the question of re-firing up the failed, expensive, and I think proven disaster that was the war on drugs, first initiated by my mentor, Richard Nixon.
[03:14:51.106 --> 03:14:52.667]  It is hard to determine
[03:14:53.388 --> 03:15:01.352]  With Kelly's military background, whether he is in fact a globalist, and we're researching that.
[03:15:01.352 --> 03:15:15.778]  But in the meantime, it's very important that the president understand that his next administrative assistant, his next chief of staff, pardon me, should be someone with both administrative skills, but also political skills.
[03:15:16.576 --> 03:15:39.925]  General Kelly, without any question, has administrative skills, but that does not speak to his understanding of the core Trump constituency that won the election and is sustaining the president now as he tries to govern in the face of a mainstream media onslaught that is unrelenting.
[03:15:39.925 --> 03:15:41.466]  So there you have it.
[03:15:41.466 --> 03:15:46.088]  Urban, Habib Powell, or General John Kelly.
[03:15:47.178 --> 03:15:51.581]  This is, again, an InfoWars exclusive.
[03:15:51.581 --> 03:16:04.428]  We are also, I think, able to say that Anthony Scaramucci has already brought a breath of fresh air as the White House Communications Director.
[03:16:04.428 --> 03:16:08.751]  The leakers are now recoiling and trying to hide.
[03:16:09.545 --> 03:16:19.456]  Scaramucci made it very clear that he would root out and fire those who continue to leak to the President's detriment.
[03:16:19.456 --> 03:16:23.099]  But what is the leaking going on in the intelligence community?
[03:16:23.099 --> 03:16:31.128]  Only last week, yet again, the intelligence community leaked a document that showed Russian Ambassador Kislyak
[03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:40.607]  Telling his superiors that when he met with Jeff Sessions, they did discuss the presidential campaign.
[03:16:40.607 --> 03:16:46.912]  This is contrary to what Sessions has said publicly and under oath.
[03:16:46.912 --> 03:16:51.416]  And frankly, I think it is the last straw for Mr. Sessions.
[03:16:52.398 --> 03:16:55.780]  Unfortunately, the Attorney General's made several mistakes.
[03:16:55.780 --> 03:17:17.233]  One is his failure to prosecute Obama, Ben Rhodes, Susan Rice, Valerie Jarrett, Admiral Rogers, and yes, John Brennan, for the willful, unconstitutional surveillance of tens of thousands of Americans, and then the use of that surveillance information for political purposes.
[03:17:17.233 --> 03:17:21.476]  Ten times worse than anything that happened during Watergate.
[03:17:22.228 --> 03:17:35.938]  Secondarily has been his aforementioned failure to prosecute Bill and Hillary Clinton on the scam that was the Clinton Foundation.
[03:17:35.938 --> 03:17:38.720]  The Clinton Foundation was never a charity.
[03:17:38.720 --> 03:17:42.283]  It was a slush fund for grifters.
[03:17:42.283 --> 03:17:51.350]  One wonders how Bill and Hillary paid for Chelsea's $6 million wedding utilizing Clinton Foundation funds.
[03:17:52.953 --> 03:18:04.545]  Also problematic for Jeff Sessions is his obsession with busting people for using medicinal marijuana in the 29 states where it is legal.
[03:18:04.545 --> 03:18:15.497]  Completely contrary to what candidate Donald Trump assured the millions of Americans currently using marijuana for medicinal purposes during the campaign.
[03:18:16.494 --> 03:18:36.342]  And then there is Jeff Sessions' comments in Nevada only two weeks ago, where he commented on the Bundy case currently going to trial in a Nevada courtroom, thus tainting the jury and potentially creating a motion for mistrial.
[03:18:36.342 --> 03:18:45.446]  Some of you may remember when President Richard Nixon, in the middle of Charles Manson's trial for mass murder, said, Manson is guilty, we know it.
[03:18:46.115 --> 03:18:49.916]  And the liberals in the media went insane.
[03:18:49.916 --> 03:18:51.696]  Why is this different?
[03:18:51.696 --> 03:19:10.161]  How could Attorney General Sessions, an officer of the court, not understand that the comments praising the prosecution for the pursuit of the Bundys taints that trial and is completely and totally inappropriate?
[03:19:10.161 --> 03:19:11.541]  I'll be back in just a moment.
[03:19:17.162 --> 03:19:20.785]  All right, that's Roger Stone, as you heard him say at the very beginning.
[03:19:20.785 --> 03:19:23.407]  Trump is going to go on offense.
[03:19:23.407 --> 03:19:29.472]  That's something that Roger Stone and Alex Jones said from the very first moment of the Trump administration.
[03:19:29.472 --> 03:19:31.373]  They said, you're going to have to go on offense.
[03:19:31.373 --> 03:19:37.458]  If you don't go on offense, they're going to be attacking you, and that's what we have seen for the last six months.
[03:19:37.458 --> 03:19:39.420]  A very important turn of events.
[03:19:39.420 --> 03:19:41.702]  Also, a good name, David Urban.
[03:19:42.262 --> 03:19:45.785]  Uh, for Chief of Staff, but some very, very troubling names.
[03:19:45.785 --> 03:19:53.791]  We see Dina Habib Goldman Sachs Powell being offered forward as a possible candidate for Chief of Staff.
[03:19:53.791 --> 03:19:54.612]  Very concerning.
[03:19:54.612 --> 03:19:55.412]  So stay with us.
[03:19:55.412 --> 03:19:57.294]  We'll be right back with more from Roger Stone.
[03:20:05.788 --> 03:20:07.749]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:20:07.749 --> 03:20:13.073]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:20:13.073 --> 03:20:14.655]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:20:14.655 --> 03:20:23.001]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:20:23.001 --> 03:20:28.705]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:20:28.865 --> 03:20:30.686]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:20:30.686 --> 03:20:32.967]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:20:32.967 --> 03:20:37.348]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:20:37.348 --> 03:20:39.549]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[03:21:04.893 --> 03:21:10.276]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:21:10.276 --> 03:21:13.118]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[03:21:13.118 --> 03:21:15.099]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[03:21:15.099 --> 03:21:20.081]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.

[03:21:23.443 --> 03:21:28.546]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:21:28.546 --> 03:21:31.888]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[03:21:32.028 --> 03:21:35.389]  ...that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:21:35.389 --> 03:21:38.351]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:21:38.351 --> 03:21:42.032]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.

[03:24:08.288 --> 03:24:11.970]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:24:11.970 --> 03:24:17.512]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:24:17.512 --> 03:24:20.493]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:24:21.465 --> 03:24:28.955]  Well, I thought that they were going to put a bunch of attention on this Obamacare repeal vote and then try to steal attention away from anything else with it.
[03:24:28.955 --> 03:24:29.996]  It looks like that's the case.
[03:24:29.996 --> 03:24:32.540]  They're now saying they think they have the votes in the Senate.
[03:24:32.540 --> 03:24:34.402]  I'm not celebrating that until I see it.
[03:24:34.402 --> 03:24:35.844]  John McCain returns to the floor.
[03:24:36.565 --> 03:24:38.165]  Bashes talk radio.
[03:24:38.165 --> 03:24:40.506]  Right back to prime form for John McCain.
[03:24:40.506 --> 03:24:42.926]  Goes right to bashing talk radio.
[03:24:42.926 --> 03:24:43.987]  Thanks for that, John McCain.
[03:24:43.987 --> 03:24:50.708]  Bernie Sanders says he doesn't want to have to call parents because children are going to die from the repeal of Obamacare.
[03:24:50.708 --> 03:24:52.388]  Well, Bernie Sanders, you're not going to call anyone.
[03:24:52.388 --> 03:24:53.909]  You're a total fraud anyway.
[03:24:53.909 --> 03:24:55.749]  And we already know what government health care does.
[03:24:55.749 --> 03:24:56.389]  It kills.
[03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:57.770]  Just ask Charlie Gard.
[03:24:57.770 --> 03:25:03.291]  But the big news is, right now it looks like Senator Sessions is going to be on his way out the door.
[03:25:03.291 --> 03:25:04.311]  Roger Stone broke that.
[03:25:04.651 --> 03:25:13.763]  He had the breaking news as well as the people that might be being considered to replace the Attorney General labeled as beleaguered from President Trump.
[03:25:13.763 --> 03:25:14.885]  Roger, I'd like to ask you this.
[03:25:14.885 --> 03:25:16.527]  The Washington Post ran the headline.
[03:25:17.799 --> 03:25:22.264]  That I forget exactly who it was was spinning around in a whirlwind.
[03:25:22.264 --> 03:25:24.887]  I think it was Sessions spinning in a whirlwind.
[03:25:24.887 --> 03:25:27.631]  Sessions spinning in a whirlwind created by Trump.
[03:25:27.631 --> 03:25:31.175]  I think that Sessions and Trump are probably in communications and Sessions knows what's going on.
[03:25:31.175 --> 03:25:34.979]  I'd like your insight on that as well as who is really in the whirlwind here.
[03:25:34.979 --> 03:25:36.862]  Is it Sessions or is it the liberal media?
[03:25:38.379 --> 03:25:44.286]  Well, I think the president is genuinely disappointed in Jeff Sessions as I am.
[03:25:44.286 --> 03:25:46.109]  I think we all should be.
[03:25:46.109 --> 03:25:48.311]  He came to office with a terrific reputation.
[03:25:48.311 --> 03:25:51.956]  He's been a real leader in the Senate on immigration issues.
[03:25:51.956 --> 03:25:55.320]  But on the key points here, he's completely M.I.A.
[03:25:56.744 --> 03:25:58.625]  He has declined.
[03:25:58.625 --> 03:26:22.974]  He, as you know, he recused himself, I think unnecessarily, on Russia, although perhaps he knew that he had discussed the campaign, contrary to his public comments, and I believe his sworn testimony, and now contrary to a document that conveniently leaked from the intelligence community in which Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, claims that he did talk politics in the campaign.
[03:26:24.038 --> 03:26:29.021]  He's been missing on the prosecution of the Clintons.
[03:26:29.021 --> 03:26:34.384]  He's been missing on the prosecution of the Obama gang for wiretapping.
[03:26:34.384 --> 03:26:39.207]  His asset forfeiture program is something Adolf Hitler would be proud of.
[03:26:40.027 --> 03:26:49.271]  He wants to relaunch the war on drugs, shearing off a giant piece of the Trump liberty-based constituency.
[03:26:49.271 --> 03:26:51.772]  You can see why the president is upset.
[03:26:51.772 --> 03:26:53.732]  Jeff Sessions is MIA.
[03:26:53.732 --> 03:26:54.713]  Where is he?
[03:26:54.713 --> 03:26:57.834]  When he does exert himself, it's on the wrong issues.
[03:26:57.834 --> 03:27:06.297]  Roger, let me join in there and say, you know, we all got angry, and rightfully so, I think, when Comey refused to prosecute Hillary Clinton.
[03:27:06.297 --> 03:27:07.418]  But now we understand that
[03:27:08.158 --> 03:27:11.119]  Sessions is doing the same thing, and he's taking it to another level.
[03:27:11.119 --> 03:27:24.383]  As you pointed out before, this isn't a supposition, this isn't your opinion, that the FBI and the NSA violated the law when they surveilled the Trump campaign, when they unmasked individuals.
[03:27:24.383 --> 03:27:29.124]  That was the FISA court that said that, so there's no question at all about this.
[03:27:29.124 --> 03:27:37.607]  The FISA court has looked very carefully at this, and they said yes, there was a violation of the law by the FBI, by the NSA, at the bare minimum.
[03:27:38.087 --> 03:27:40.869]  Why isn't the Attorney General prosecuting them?
[03:27:40.869 --> 03:27:47.712]  And again, still letting Hillary off the hook as we had FBI Director Comey do.
[03:27:47.712 --> 03:27:53.576]  Well, and if I may steal a line from others, what did the President know and when did he know it?
[03:27:53.576 --> 03:28:04.982]  Hard for me to believe that Barack Obama was unaware of the illegal surveillance of tens of thousands of people, all of whom happen to be political opponents of this administration.
[03:28:05.662 --> 03:28:13.685]  Anyone who has not read the Circa news stories on this by John Solomon and Sarah Carter should do so.
[03:28:13.685 --> 03:28:18.447]  It's funny how none of this appeared on the front pages of the Washington Post or the New York Times.
[03:28:18.447 --> 03:28:24.229]  You won't find it on CNN, but it is a scandal far bigger than Watergate.
[03:28:24.229 --> 03:28:27.751]  And it is the key to the President's survival.
[03:28:27.751 --> 03:28:28.591]  Stone's Rule.
[03:28:28.591 --> 03:28:30.632]  You do not win on defense.
[03:28:31.465 --> 03:28:41.676]  Here he has his opponents by the short hairs in an outrageously illegal and unconstitutional spying operation.
[03:28:41.676 --> 03:28:47.883]  And his attorney general is dithering around trying to prosecute people for smoking pot to improve their health.
[03:28:49.285 --> 03:28:53.009]  Sessions is just an abysmal failure.
[03:28:53.009 --> 03:28:55.091]  And I know Donald Trump for 40 years.
[03:28:55.091 --> 03:28:59.477]  When he hits you in four tweets, he's sending you a message.
[03:28:59.477 --> 03:29:01.899]  Jeff Sessions is toast.
[03:29:01.899 --> 03:29:09.208]  When you said earlier that the only name that you mentioned as a possible successor to Sessions was Pompeo.
[03:29:10.368 --> 03:29:11.769]  Is there anybody else's name there?
[03:29:11.769 --> 03:29:17.672]  Because, I mean, as you pointed out before, he's got connections to the deep state, and he's got connections to the intelligence community.
[03:29:17.672 --> 03:29:22.375]  And I said, you know, the real issue here is elect spionage that we've had here.
[03:29:22.375 --> 03:29:26.257]  It's election espionage by our own intelligence community.
[03:29:26.257 --> 03:29:29.259]  As a member of the intelligence community, are you really going to come after those people?
[03:29:29.799 --> 03:29:36.561]  You have just capsulized my concern exactly, David, and that is the President is high on Pompeo.
[03:29:36.561 --> 03:29:48.745]  But I don't think he understands that Pompeo will not prosecute the boys at Langley for their role in the illegal spying on the Trump campaign, Trump associates, and other Republicans.
[03:29:48.745 --> 03:29:51.025]  And there is the nut of the problem.
[03:29:51.025 --> 03:29:52.846]  One must wonder what happened to Pompeo.
[03:29:52.846 --> 03:29:53.426]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:54.850 --> 03:29:58.772]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:58.772 --> 03:30:06.096]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:06.096 --> 03:30:12.159]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com is writing about it.
[03:30:12.159 --> 03:30:21.424]  But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[03:30:21.424 --> 03:30:23.765]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh
[03:30:23.965 --> 03:30:25.026]  on the grasshoppers.
[03:30:25.026 --> 03:30:28.387]  But the grasshoppers will still sing the tune if they can make money.
[03:30:28.387 --> 03:30:35.090]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[03:30:35.090 --> 03:30:39.572]  There are still very effective, low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[03:30:39.572 --> 03:30:47.355]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[03:30:47.355 --> 03:30:53.418]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock,
[03:30:53.698 --> 03:30:55.799]  Or to protect you from home invasion.
[03:30:55.799 --> 03:31:01.783]  Prepare for the worst case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best case scenario.
[03:31:01.783 --> 03:31:04.665]  Get more information at InfoWars.com.
[03:31:04.665 --> 03:31:05.226]  I'm David Knight.
[03:31:06.024 --> 03:31:14.767]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[03:31:14.767 --> 03:31:15.308]  That's right.
[03:31:15.308 --> 03:31:20.570]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.

[03:31:34.855 --> 03:31:35.055]  Woo!
[03:31:35.055 --> 03:31:36.096]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:31:36.096 --> 03:31:44.842]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[03:31:44.842 --> 03:31:54.429]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[03:31:54.429 --> 03:31:57.871]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[03:31:57.871 --> 03:32:01.994]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[03:32:01.994 --> 03:32:02.835]  So what are you waiting for?

[03:32:05.896 --> 03:32:11.298]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:11.298 --> 03:32:14.139]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[03:32:14.139 --> 03:32:16.120]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[03:32:16.120 --> 03:32:21.142]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[03:32:21.142 --> 03:32:23.243]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:32:23.243 --> 03:32:24.523]  In fact, it's certified.
[03:32:24.523 --> 03:32:29.445]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:32:29.645 --> 03:32:36.531]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:32:36.531 --> 03:32:39.514]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:32:39.514 --> 03:32:43.218]  It's loaded with good halogen iodides of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:32:43.218 --> 03:32:50.124]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:32:50.124 --> 03:32:55.309]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,

[03:33:00.791 --> 03:33:02.272]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:27.372 --> 03:33:29.819]  Happens.
[03:33:29.819 --> 03:33:32.125]  In fact, we're not.
[03:33:32.125 --> 03:33:33.930]  I'm not gonna do it.
[03:33:33.930 --> 03:33:34.651]  I know there's a lot.
[03:33:39.215 --> 03:33:41.177]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:41.177 --> 03:33:47.962]  Owen Troyer, David Knight, we have Roger Stone on the line as well, breaking down the developments in the White House today.
[03:33:47.962 --> 03:33:56.769]  The momentum is shifting against Jeff Sessions and towards an aggressive White House that wants to go on the offense.
[03:33:56.769 --> 03:33:59.831]  Speaking of offensive, John McCain.
[03:33:59.831 --> 03:34:02.993]  You know, I didn't want to come on here and bash the guy who just got brain cancer.
[03:34:02.993 --> 03:34:04.735]  I don't know if we have the clip.
[03:34:04.735 --> 03:34:06.296]  You guys may not have gotten the clip yet.
[03:34:08.083 --> 03:34:11.525]  Just go ahead and play John McCain reintroducing himself on the Hill today.
[03:34:11.525 --> 03:34:12.926]  Go ahead.
[03:34:12.926 --> 03:34:25.334]  I hope we can again rely on humility, on our need to cooperate, on our dependence on each other, to learn how to trust each other again, and by so doing, better serve the people who elected us.
[03:34:25.334 --> 03:34:31.297]  Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and the internet.
[03:34:31.297 --> 03:34:32.138]  To hell with them!
[03:34:33.072 --> 03:34:33.613]  I got news.
[03:34:33.613 --> 03:34:36.076]  To hell with you, McCain.
[03:34:36.076 --> 03:34:36.917]  To hell with you.
[03:34:36.917 --> 03:34:38.820]  I didn't want to attack you.
[03:34:38.820 --> 03:34:40.161]  I didn't want to deal with you.
[03:34:40.161 --> 03:34:42.605]  You just got brain cancer, but you came after us.
[03:34:42.605 --> 03:34:43.165]  Get him out of here.
[03:34:43.165 --> 03:34:43.926]  I'm done with him.
[03:34:43.926 --> 03:34:45.548]  To hell with you, John McCain.
[03:34:45.548 --> 03:34:50.275]  And I got news for John McCain, who says he wants to be reaching out to the people that got him elected.
[03:34:50.655 --> 03:34:51.775]  Guess what, buddy?
[03:34:51.775 --> 03:34:53.196]  We're the media now.
[03:34:53.196 --> 03:34:54.637]  We get people elected.
[03:34:54.637 --> 03:34:56.037]  We got Trump elected.
[03:34:56.037 --> 03:34:59.078]  We're gonna be in charge in the 2018 midterm elections.
[03:34:59.078 --> 03:34:59.939]  Get used to it.
[03:34:59.939 --> 03:35:03.980]  And all that globalist ass-kissing you're doing right now for life extension technology?
[03:35:03.980 --> 03:35:05.461]  You're not gonna get it, McCain!
[03:35:06.161 --> 03:35:08.042]  Excuse me, that's my Rant on McCain.
[03:35:08.042 --> 03:35:10.124]  We want to talk about people cooperating.
[03:35:10.124 --> 03:35:13.807]  Well, let's talk about his cooperation or collusion with ISIS.
[03:35:13.807 --> 03:35:25.355]  How many people have suffered and died in just that one country because of the actions of John McCain acting as Al-Qaeda's weapon source, as ISIS's weapon source?
[03:35:25.355 --> 03:35:27.297]  That's the thing that is really key.
[03:35:27.657 --> 03:35:32.981]  Let's go back to Roger because he pointed out how the Trump administration is shifting from a defense mode.
[03:35:32.981 --> 03:35:41.187]  He said one of his key rules, and this is something that Roger and Alex said from day one, Trump had to go on offense.
[03:35:41.187 --> 03:35:45.490]  We've talked about how Attorney General Sessions has refused to come after
[03:35:46.451 --> 03:35:51.033]  Former Director James Comey, who allowed Hillary Clinton a pass.
[03:35:51.033 --> 03:35:52.334]  We're all upset about that.
[03:35:52.334 --> 03:35:53.374]  He hasn't gone after Hillary.
[03:35:53.374 --> 03:36:00.517]  He hasn't gone after the man who colluded with her to give her a pass, who obstructed justice by giving her a pass.
[03:36:00.517 --> 03:36:05.159]  And he hasn't gone after the people, the FBI, the NSA, the FISA court.
[03:36:05.159 --> 03:36:06.400]  This is not my opinion.
[03:36:06.400 --> 03:36:08.101]  This is not Roger Stone's opinion.
[03:36:08.101 --> 03:36:10.242]  This is the opinion of the FISA court.
[03:36:10.782 --> 03:36:21.971]  That the FBI, the NSA violated the Fourth Amendment, violated the FISA Act, violated the laws of the United States to go after the Trump campaign and to surveil them and to unmask them.
[03:36:21.971 --> 03:36:22.872]  That's the key issue.
[03:36:22.872 --> 03:36:29.037]  So we need a fighter, but we're very concerned about the name that Roger has put up here, Pompeo.
[03:36:29.037 --> 03:36:30.238]  I agree, Roger.
[03:36:30.238 --> 03:36:36.143]  I think we're going to have a situation where, just like Jeff Sessions doesn't want to go after his colleagues in Washington,
[03:36:36.463 --> 03:36:42.687]  I'm concerned the same thing is going to happen with Pompeo, who doesn't want to go after his colleagues in the intelligence community.
[03:36:42.687 --> 03:36:46.650]  It may wind up exactly in the same place where we are right now.
[03:36:46.650 --> 03:36:49.692]  I think that's a very legitimate concern, David.
[03:36:49.692 --> 03:36:52.274]  First of all, let me address John McCain.
[03:36:52.274 --> 03:36:57.377]  There seems to be some new argument that because he's ill, he's now immune from criticism.
[03:36:58.517 --> 03:36:59.818]  I wish him well.
[03:36:59.818 --> 03:37:04.239]  I wish him Godspeed and a speedy recovery from his surgery.
[03:37:04.239 --> 03:37:08.140]  But that does not mean that he should be immune to criticism.
[03:37:08.140 --> 03:37:19.524]  His trafficking of a fake document, a fake dossier smearing Donald Trump amounts to treason in my opinion against the President of the United States.
[03:37:19.524 --> 03:37:21.584]  And Trump still supports him, by the way.
[03:37:23.585 --> 03:37:25.045]  I don't know what he's talking about.
[03:37:25.045 --> 03:37:26.886]  We can't find any collusion.
[03:37:26.886 --> 03:37:30.767]  He said Barack Obama was a greater president than Donald Trump.
[03:37:30.767 --> 03:37:32.927]  He traffics with ISIS.
[03:37:32.927 --> 03:37:42.709]  His institute, which you would have us believe he doesn't control, even though everyone who works there came from his Senate staff, has taken millions from the Saudis.
[03:37:42.709 --> 03:37:44.810]  John McCain is a disgrace.
[03:37:45.683 --> 03:37:54.231]  This is a guy I supported for president, not once but twice, and I'm gravely disappointed in the way he has conducted himself.
[03:37:54.231 --> 03:38:08.966]  I can only suggest to you that perhaps his erratic, explosive, irrational behavior, his violent outbursts, and his trucking with the enemy may have been caused by pressure from his brain tumor.
[03:38:09.426 --> 03:38:10.587]  Well, I don't know.
[03:38:10.587 --> 03:38:18.290]  It seems like, Roger, he's always used his POW status and his injuries from the war.
[03:38:18.290 --> 03:38:20.811]  He's used that to shield himself from criticism.
[03:38:20.811 --> 03:38:27.294]  Now it seems like he's using the brain cancer to shield himself from criticism while he goes on the attack against others.
[03:38:27.294 --> 03:38:29.134]  And he's about to gear up for another Senate run.
[03:38:29.134 --> 03:38:33.456]  If he's that sick, he can't even think clearly because of a brain tumor, why is he running for Senate again?
[03:38:33.456 --> 03:38:35.357]  Well, he just got elected in the fall.
[03:38:36.935 --> 03:38:41.257]  I'm going to be speaking in Tucson tomorrow, and I'm going to be very careful.
[03:38:41.257 --> 03:38:48.219]  I recognize that he is gravely ill, and I respect that, and I really do wish him a speedy recovery from his health problems.
[03:38:48.219 --> 03:38:52.601]  But that should not make him immune from any criticism of his public record.
[03:38:53.421 --> 03:39:00.206]  I don't understand why the Republicans in the Senate haven't censured him for trafficking in phony intelligence documents.
[03:39:00.206 --> 03:39:00.606]  Yes.
[03:39:00.606 --> 03:39:16.537]  Frankly, if I were the President, I would tell Mitch McConnell, either the Senate Republicans censure John McCain, or you can kiss your wife, the Secretary of Transportation, who's doing nothing whatsoever to make America great again, she can kiss her job as Secretary of Transportation goodbye.
[03:39:17.239 --> 03:39:19.100]  You know, this is actually an interesting thought.
[03:39:19.100 --> 03:39:27.402]  I just had creep into my head because we've been talking about the notion or the paradigm that it's Washington establishment, it's the D.C.
[03:39:27.402 --> 03:39:28.823]  deep state versus the people.
[03:39:28.823 --> 03:39:30.283]  Trump represents the people.
[03:39:30.283 --> 03:39:31.103]  Everyone in D.C.
[03:39:31.103 --> 03:39:34.084]  looks out for their own, including Jeff Sessions, it appears.
[03:39:34.084 --> 03:39:36.105]  Maybe this is what McCain was saying.
[03:39:36.105 --> 03:39:42.647]  Maybe McCain went to the floor and he was actually talking to everyone on the Hill today saying, all of my brothers and sisters in Congress
[03:39:43.547 --> 03:39:45.509]  Screw the people on TV!
[03:39:45.509 --> 03:39:47.210]  Screw the people in radio!
[03:39:47.210 --> 03:39:49.332]  Forget the fact that everyone listens to them.
[03:39:49.332 --> 03:39:50.373]  We're in charge!
[03:39:50.373 --> 03:39:51.914]  We're the DC establishment!
[03:39:51.914 --> 03:39:53.456]  I'm John McCain!
[03:39:53.456 --> 03:39:55.257]  And he gets them all fired up.
[03:39:55.257 --> 03:39:56.398]  Maybe that's what he was doing.
[03:39:56.398 --> 03:39:57.579]  Do you think I'm out of line there?
[03:39:58.396 --> 03:39:59.577]  Well, it's very hard to say.
[03:39:59.577 --> 03:40:03.700]  In all honesty, I think he's becoming increasingly erratic and mentally unbalanced.
[03:40:03.700 --> 03:40:05.381]  I'm not surprised that he's not well.
[03:40:05.381 --> 03:40:08.963]  I've been trying to figure out his behavior now for some time.
[03:40:08.963 --> 03:40:14.467]  Remember, this is someone I've known since he came to Washington as a conservative Republican congressman.
[03:40:14.467 --> 03:40:17.028]  I supported him over George W. Bush.
[03:40:17.028 --> 03:40:23.753]  I supported him in the pivotal Florida primary, where he was nominated, essentially, where he wrapped up the nomination.
[03:40:24.654 --> 03:40:34.746]  And his behavior towards the president of his own party and towards the movement that elected Donald Trump is reprehensible.
[03:40:35.467 --> 03:40:38.029]  Why has he just switched to become a Democrat?
[03:40:38.029 --> 03:40:40.150]  That would make a lot more sense.
[03:40:40.150 --> 03:40:43.192]  He seems to be more comfortable with them anyway.
[03:40:43.192 --> 03:40:46.213]  Let's trade Tulsi Gabbard for John McCain.
[03:40:46.213 --> 03:40:48.054]  I'd make that deal tomorrow.
[03:40:48.054 --> 03:40:49.355]  That would make sense.
[03:40:49.355 --> 03:40:55.499]  Tulsi Gabbard calls out John McCain's terrorist in Syria and John McCain's the Republican though.
[03:40:56.195 --> 03:41:05.785]  Well, you know, when we had the Comey hearings, everybody was talking about John McCain, and it clearly appeared at that point in time that he was not in full possession of his faculties.
[03:41:05.785 --> 03:41:07.888]  So people were saying, is this dementia?
[03:41:07.888 --> 03:41:09.129]  Is it some other issue?
[03:41:09.129 --> 03:41:12.853]  And as the blood clot issue came, that was one of the things that people talked about.
[03:41:12.853 --> 03:41:13.814]  Possible brain tumor.
[03:41:15.015 --> 03:41:25.221]  We do, as you said, wish him well in terms of his personal health, but there's not anybody I could find in Washington that I would disagree with any more strongly.
[03:41:25.221 --> 03:41:28.422]  There's many that I would disagree with as strongly as John McCain.
[03:41:28.422 --> 03:41:35.206]  But he clearly has been the leader of the opposition, and as we all pointed out before the election,
[03:41:36.209 --> 03:41:42.875]  Donald Trump's greatest opposition was going to come from within the GOP, from the establishment of the GOP.
[03:41:42.875 --> 03:42:02.030]  And that's what we see now, with Boehner saying earlier today, Roger, I don't know if you saw that or not, that we're not ever going to have a repeal of Obamacare, and then laughing about the fact that Trump used to give him money, but Trump wasn't his first, or even his second or third choice, so forth and so on.
[03:42:02.831 --> 03:42:15.857]  At the same time, Donald Trump said that if they don't repeal Obamacare, that is going to be death to the Republican Party, and Exhibit A is John Boehner, who is no longer there because he refused to do what he campaigned on.
[03:42:15.857 --> 03:42:22.700]  He refused to deliver on the promises to the Republican Party, and so it was the conservatives who pushed him out.
[03:42:22.700 --> 03:42:30.283]  Aren't they the people that Donald Trump needs to coalesce around the House Freedom Caucus, the people who really do want to do what they told the voters who voted for them?
[03:42:31.004 --> 03:42:34.166]  Yeah, I think this was a major failure of Reince Priebus.
[03:42:34.166 --> 03:42:43.653]  You'll recall that the first health care bill that was put forward by Paul Ryan, but in fact actually drafted by John Boehner, was abysmal.
[03:42:43.653 --> 03:42:48.276]  Was a laydown for the medical industry and a nightmare for the taxpayers.
[03:42:49.062 --> 03:42:51.044]  That went down in flames.
[03:42:51.044 --> 03:43:13.122]  Is it any surprise now that Paul Ryan yesterday comes out and says that Robert Mueller is some kind of a second coming of Christ, a man of great integrity, when in fact Mueller is just a stooge for the Clintons and the Bushes and the deep state, still chasing after a crime that he can't seem to define because he doesn't have one.
[03:43:14.042 --> 03:43:20.305]  Can we learn that he's going to go back into the President's business career before he was in politics?
[03:43:20.305 --> 03:43:21.366]  Relevance?
[03:43:21.366 --> 03:43:24.527]  Relevance is what?
[03:43:24.527 --> 03:43:41.736]  Just an inalterable attempt to ride this out until the 18 elections, hoping that the Democrats win the House, and then he can hang any charge on the President he wants, perjury, any phony charge, which the Democrats would then use as grounds for impeachment.
[03:43:42.116 --> 03:44:01.164]  We already had a story today as an example of that, Roger, on the Daily Mail, calling out Donald Trump and saying he just leaked on himself, and then having a CIA, former CIA employee say, well it looks like he leaked out some classified information, when Donald Trump said, hey, the fake Washington, Amazon Washington Post
[03:44:01.844 --> 03:44:06.267]  Is talking about what happened with Syrian arms and support for that.
[03:44:06.267 --> 03:44:19.474]  He didn't even say anything about the CIA and yet we got the CIA coming out here with a story that everybody knows has been out in the open about the fact that the CIA and John McCain have been giving arms to the Syrian rebels.
[03:44:19.474 --> 03:44:20.735]  That's what they're very upset about.
[03:44:20.735 --> 03:44:22.196]  The CIA is upset about that.
[03:44:22.196 --> 03:44:27.519]  So we get one former employee saying, oh well we could come after Donald Trump for this at the same time we get
[03:44:27.999 --> 03:44:33.502]  John Brennan coming out and saying, hey, we need to have a coup against him if he does anything with Robert Mueller.
[03:44:33.502 --> 03:44:40.447]  They can use any pretense to come after him and impeach him if the Democrats have a majority in the House.
[03:44:40.447 --> 03:44:44.489]  You know, if I had five minutes with Jeff Sessions, I'd ask him one question.
[03:44:44.489 --> 03:44:46.630]  Why hasn't John Brennan been arrested?
[03:44:46.630 --> 03:44:47.071]  Yes.
[03:44:47.071 --> 03:44:49.492]  Why hasn't he been indicted?
[03:44:49.492 --> 03:44:56.396]  He is up to his neck in the illegal surveillance and the leaking illegally of surveillance material.
[03:44:56.396 --> 03:44:57.397]  He makes it obvious.
[03:44:58.084 --> 03:45:13.013]  And as disgusted as I was by the memo by Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, which said that he did discuss the campaign with Jeff Sessions, I'm more concerned with the fact that that memo leaked in violation of the law.
[03:45:13.013 --> 03:45:14.874]  When will this leaking stop?
[03:45:14.874 --> 03:45:16.595]  I can answer your question.
[03:45:16.595 --> 03:45:19.377]  When the president gets around to appointing a government.
[03:45:20.146 --> 03:45:30.715]  I would point out to you that about 20% of the government are Trump appointees and the other 80% in appointed positions are Obama holdovers or vacancies.
[03:45:31.992 --> 03:45:35.933]  I lay this again at the feet of Reince Priebus.
[03:45:35.933 --> 03:45:48.478]  We are now deep into the first year of the administration, but the President has no loyalists in these individual departments, which is why the leaking from the Intelligence Committee continues.
[03:45:48.478 --> 03:45:51.219]  Or I should say the Intelligence Community continues.
[03:45:52.190 --> 03:45:55.153]  Well, Roger, we've got John Rappaport, who is going to come on.
[03:45:55.153 --> 03:45:57.354]  We're going to split this hour between you and John.
[03:45:57.354 --> 03:45:58.635]  This has been such breaking news.
[03:45:58.635 --> 03:46:07.082]  We want to keep you on, but also bring John Rappaport in with us and get his opinion on what he's heard from Roger Stone, as well as the other news of the day.
[03:46:07.082 --> 03:46:08.303]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:46:08.303 --> 03:46:11.866]  John Rappaport's site is NoMoreFakeNews.
[03:46:11.866 --> 03:46:15.329]  You've been on top of fake news for a long time, John.
[03:46:15.329 --> 03:46:16.851]  Welcome.
[03:46:16.851 --> 03:46:17.591]  Good to be here.
[03:46:17.591 --> 03:46:17.971]  Thank you.
[03:46:18.993 --> 03:46:25.798]  I would just double down on pretty much everything that you've been saying and Roger's been saying here.
[03:46:25.798 --> 03:46:30.501]  If you don't go on the offense, then you're always playing defense.
[03:46:30.501 --> 03:46:36.064]  And if the enemy is strong enough, they're going to keep you distracted and operating on a dozen
[03:46:37.406 --> 03:46:44.455]  Two dozen fronts all at the same time trying to plug the gaps and it's not going to work.
[03:46:44.455 --> 03:46:51.184]  So from the beginning when we were all saying do not let the Clintons off the hook!
[03:46:52.011 --> 03:46:52.391]  Yes.
[03:46:52.391 --> 03:46:54.152]  This is not a dead issue.
[03:46:54.152 --> 03:46:58.455]  The Clinton Foundation is not a dead issue.
[03:46:58.455 --> 03:47:02.537]  The Money Laundering Foundation, the U.S.
[03:47:02.537 --> 03:47:09.441]  uranium deal, which the Clintons, both of them, were so instrumental in, which gave 20% of U.S.
[03:47:09.441 --> 03:47:16.745]  uranium production to Putin and Russia, that I've detailed many times, that is not a dead issue.
[03:47:17.865 --> 03:47:35.554]  None of this, the email scandal, Hillary's email server, that is not a dead issue and of course neither is the Obama team spying and leaking and spying and leaking on the Trump team.
[03:47:35.554 --> 03:47:45.920]  None of this is going to, you know, if you just let it go and say we're being nice guys and we're moving on.
[03:47:47.369 --> 03:47:50.011]  Well, we see how that worked.
[03:47:50.011 --> 03:47:55.756]  This Russia collusion story with Trump, etc., is never going to go away.
[03:47:55.756 --> 03:48:05.705]  And if you want to stop it, you have to stop it by going on the offense and saying, here's what the real collusion looks like, folks.
[03:48:05.705 --> 03:48:06.566]  20% of U.S.
[03:48:06.566 --> 03:48:08.167]  uranium to Russia.
[03:48:08.167 --> 03:48:10.089]  The Clintons were up to their necks in it.
[03:48:12.273 --> 03:48:18.898]  And just go back over the whole thing, including, of course, the Clinton Foundation chapter and verse.
[03:48:18.898 --> 03:48:20.739]  Go on the offense.
[03:48:20.739 --> 03:48:23.941]  And I'm sorry, but Trump has to clear his head.
[03:48:23.941 --> 03:48:39.051]  I mean, if he wants to clear his head, if he can't find anybody to appoint to these key posts that falls in line with the agenda that he promised the voter, then he's going to have to do it himself.
[03:48:39.051 --> 03:48:41.253]  He can't just stand by and say, well,
[03:48:42.358 --> 03:48:47.803]  Another screw-up, so who can I appoint now that will appoint the person I want?
[03:48:47.803 --> 03:48:50.045]  It doesn't work that way after a certain point.
[03:48:51.084 --> 03:48:51.564]  Absolutely.
[03:48:51.564 --> 03:48:54.027]  And so now what we've seen is a revival.
[03:48:54.027 --> 03:48:56.428]  Actually, it's a story that's been around for several months.
[03:48:56.428 --> 03:48:58.610]  We talked earlier to Lee Stranahan.
[03:48:58.610 --> 03:49:02.093]  It's now getting traction, and that's what actually happened in Ukraine.
[03:49:02.093 --> 03:49:07.297]  Another aspect of this corruption, we're going to have hearings on it tomorrow by Grassley.
[03:49:07.297 --> 03:49:10.740]  Had a very interesting report earlier from Lee Stranahan.
[03:49:10.740 --> 03:49:15.744]  There's so many different aspects to this that have just been left there on the floor.
[03:49:15.744 --> 03:49:18.066]  Attorney General Sessions has not done anything to it.
[03:49:18.066 --> 03:49:19.588]  As I pointed out before, it's just as a
[03:49:20.248 --> 03:49:25.031]  It's just as much of a problem that he gave these people a pass as it is that Comey gave Clinton a pass.
[03:49:25.031 --> 03:49:35.359]  So now Comey and Clinton and all the rest of them are getting passes from Attorney General Sessions, especially the people that have been flagged by the FISA court.
[03:49:35.859 --> 03:49:40.342]  The FISA court telling us that we've had massive violations of the law and our Attorney General is sitting on the sidelines.
[03:49:40.342 --> 03:49:41.703]  Well, think about this too.
[03:49:41.703 --> 03:49:48.468]  When you talk about playing defense and offense, yeah, we've been playing defense with the Trump-Russia thing and all the allegations against Trump.
[03:49:48.468 --> 03:49:50.370]  We've defended all of them and won.
[03:49:50.370 --> 03:49:51.150]  But think about this.
[03:49:51.150 --> 03:49:54.032]  Obama spying on the American people in the Trump campaign?
[03:49:54.032 --> 03:49:54.873]  They haven't addressed that.
[03:49:54.873 --> 03:49:56.154]  They haven't played defense on that.
[03:49:56.154 --> 03:49:57.255]  They just take it.
[03:49:57.255 --> 03:49:58.236]  How about Ukraine?
[03:49:58.236 --> 03:49:59.216]  All this stuff on Ukraine.
[03:49:59.216 --> 03:50:01.018]  Does Clinton play defense on that?
[03:50:01.758 --> 03:50:02.379]  No!
[03:50:02.379 --> 03:50:07.784]  Does the DNC, Washerman Schultz, does she play defense on all the charges with the DNC fraud lawsuit?
[03:50:07.784 --> 03:50:08.545]  No!
[03:50:08.545 --> 03:50:10.928]  So these people are never on defense.
[03:50:10.928 --> 03:50:13.430]  They never defend the allegations against them even though they're true.
[03:50:13.430 --> 03:50:15.573]  They're always on offense even if they make it up.
[03:50:15.573 --> 03:50:17.595]  So maybe it's time to take a page out of their playbook.
[03:50:18.592 --> 03:50:20.333]  All right, let's recap with Roger Stone.
[03:50:20.333 --> 03:50:27.638]  Roger, you told us that you believe that both the Attorney General as well as the White House Chief of Staff positions are in play.
[03:50:27.638 --> 03:50:29.960]  It's a major shakeup in the White House.
[03:50:29.960 --> 03:50:35.323]  We've got one good name that came out of it, but we've got some very troubling names that are coming out of this as well.
[03:50:35.323 --> 03:50:45.370]  Yeah, David, to recap, the breaking news here is that Richard Pompeo, under consideration to become White House Chief of Staff, pardon me, to become U.S.
[03:50:45.370 --> 03:50:46.751]  Attorney General,
[03:50:47.595 --> 03:50:52.982]  This is deeply troubling because I doubt he would prosecute the CIA for their involvement in the spying.
[03:50:52.982 --> 03:51:01.331]  And both Dina Powell and General John Kelly in the running as well as David Urban for the position of Chief of Staff.
[03:51:01.331 --> 03:51:02.973]  I'm neutral on the Kelly question.
[03:51:02.973 --> 03:51:05.036]  I need to collect- We'll be right back with more from Roger Stone.
[03:51:05.376 --> 03:51:13.460]  What if ExtendoVite really works, but you find that hard to believe, and you spend precious time looking for someone to say, just try it?
[03:51:13.460 --> 03:51:21.324]  I have my help today because of ExtendoVite, and if I did not take a leap of faith and try it, well, I would be on disability today.
[03:51:21.324 --> 03:51:26.127]  Take one bottle of ExtendoVite, as suggested, for 60 days to find out for yourself.
[03:51:26.127 --> 03:51:28.548]  No need to stop any other meds you may be on.
[03:51:28.548 --> 03:51:30.789]  You know by now that they are not working for you.
[03:51:31.129 --> 03:51:37.914]  Before the 60 days are up, I know that you will feel Xtendivite working for you and will want to take another bottle.
[03:51:37.914 --> 03:51:39.055]  Life is too short!

[03:54:11.200 --> 03:54:12.300]  Final segment here today.
[03:54:12.300 --> 03:54:14.742]  Owen Troyer and David Knight have been filling in for Alex.
[03:54:14.742 --> 03:54:15.803]  Alex will be back tomorrow.
[03:54:15.803 --> 03:54:17.144]  John Ratport on the line with us.
[03:54:17.144 --> 03:54:18.505]  He's going to close it out.
[03:54:18.505 --> 03:54:22.949]  Got to tell you about the July, last week of July specials, folks.

[03:54:26.371 --> 03:54:28.193]  Probably, if not the biggest.
[03:54:28.673 --> 03:54:29.194]  We're good.
[03:54:47.972 --> 03:54:51.515]  I know a lot of our listeners like to exercise, like to lift weights.
[03:54:51.515 --> 03:54:53.497]  You take protein after your workout.
[03:54:53.497 --> 03:54:56.500]  Now you can get your protein from InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:54:57.861 --> 03:55:01.424]  And I'm telling you, I am one of the people that always takes protein after my workout.
[03:55:01.424 --> 03:55:05.488]  And I'm someone that has avoided vanilla flavored protein for basically my entire life.
[03:55:05.908 --> 03:55:14.240]  This is the best tasting protein, the only vanilla protein I've ever liked, finely grind, and it mixes well with water, too.
[03:55:14.240 --> 03:55:16.763]  I've never had a protein that I think mixes well with water.
[03:55:16.763 --> 03:55:18.486]  It does great with just water.
[03:55:18.486 --> 03:55:21.310]  So, switch proteins now to the True Whey Protein.

[03:55:36.359 --> 03:55:38.280]  Let's go back to John Rappaport.
[03:55:38.280 --> 03:55:47.146]  John, what do you think Trump needs to do now to swing the tide in the direction to put them, the enemy, on defense?
[03:55:47.146 --> 03:55:48.887]  Well, I think at the beginning,
[03:55:49.861 --> 03:55:58.797]  When he took office, one of his thoughts was, look, if I keep on playing offense against the Clintons, against Obama, and so on...
[03:55:59.929 --> 03:56:09.478]  You know, there's just going to be too much stuff stirred up, and I've got my agenda, and I'm trying to forward this, that, and the other thing, so let's just let it ride.
[03:56:09.478 --> 03:56:24.711]  What he didn't realize was the ferocity and the consistency of the attack against him, and how it was all going to keep on going and actually escalate way beyond probably what he even imagined it could.
[03:56:24.711 --> 03:56:25.912]  And it's never going to stop.
[03:56:26.873 --> 03:56:30.714]  So now, perhaps he gets the point.
[03:56:30.714 --> 03:56:35.716]  He should have gone on offense right away, and he should do it now.
[03:56:35.716 --> 03:56:49.301]  He should find an attorney general who's willing to carry out that program against the illegal spying and leaking and unmasking of the Obama administration against him, Trump.
[03:56:49.301 --> 03:56:52.262]  Do you think that the current CIA director Pompeo will do that, John?
[03:56:52.867 --> 03:56:53.767]  No, absolutely not.
[03:56:53.767 --> 03:56:54.688]  I don't either.
[03:56:54.688 --> 03:56:57.809]  No, there's no... You see, and this is the mystery.
[03:56:57.809 --> 03:56:59.690]  Come on, man, wake up.
[03:56:59.690 --> 03:57:02.731]  You're going to appoint another loser?
[03:57:02.731 --> 03:57:03.051]  Yes.
[03:57:03.051 --> 03:57:04.852]  It's just going to prolong the agony and make it worse.
[03:57:04.852 --> 03:57:07.333]  Yeah, I mean, you could say the same things that you would say against Sessions.
[03:57:07.333 --> 03:57:10.595]  I mean, Sessions has been more impactful than Pompeo.
[03:57:10.595 --> 03:57:13.036]  I mean, what has Pompeo done?
[03:57:13.036 --> 03:57:14.036]  Exactly.
[03:57:14.036 --> 03:57:17.198]  I mean, you know, we're sitting here and we can see it.
[03:57:18.098 --> 03:57:20.720]  So, he certainly should be able to see it.
[03:57:20.720 --> 03:57:22.142]  I'm talking about Trump.
[03:57:22.142 --> 03:57:33.492]  If he wants to do what he has to do, then he's got to think clearly now and say who... Because look, the Attorney General is under the President of the United States.
[03:57:33.492 --> 03:57:35.934]  We saw that with Eric Holder and Barack Obama.
[03:57:36.434 --> 03:57:44.400]  Eric Holder was not stepping out of line and saying things against Obama and criticizing his foreign policy and so on and so forth.
[03:57:44.400 --> 03:57:45.621]  Get real here!
[03:57:45.621 --> 03:57:49.585]  The Attorney General is under the President of the United States constitutionally.
[03:57:49.585 --> 03:58:01.754]  Okay, put somebody in the chair who is going to take the offensive and carry out these prosecutions single-mindedly and absolutely come hell or high water.
[03:58:01.754 --> 03:58:03.175]  Why is that so difficult?
[03:58:03.175 --> 03:58:03.716]  I don't see it.
[03:58:04.016 --> 03:58:08.118]  Yeah, it's amazing to me that you don't have somebody that wants to take that stand.
[03:58:08.118 --> 03:58:14.702]  I would imagine there's a ton of young lawyers throughout the United States that would love to make a name for themselves with this Clinton case.
[03:58:14.702 --> 03:58:22.306]  So we've got Attorney General Sessions who's on this quixotic quest to shut down the 9th and 10th Amendment along with the arrest warrants.
[03:58:23.366 --> 03:58:28.828]  I'll tell you what, thank you NoMoreFakeNews.com, John Radford, thank you Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com.
[03:58:28.828 --> 03:58:35.810]  I'm telling you what, regardless of whoever gets hired or whatever, justice is coming to the Clintons, justice is coming to Wasserman Schultz.
[03:58:35.810 --> 03:58:39.451]  We hope it's on this earth, but if not, it'll be in the next, folks.
[03:58:39.451 --> 03:58:40.231]  Thank you for tuning in.
[03:58:40.231 --> 03:58:41.831]  Support us at InfoWarsStore.com.
