[00:00.000 --> 00:14.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:14.000 --> 00:29.840]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29.840 --> 00:31.400]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[00:31.400 --> 00:35.000]  Owen Schreuer, David Knight filling in for Alex today.
[00:35.000 --> 00:42.040]  And we have a ton of news for you today, major red pill radio today here on the Alex Jones
[00:42.040 --> 00:43.040]  show.
[00:43.040 --> 00:49.660]  I'm just going to try to get the waterfront here and just so you know what to expect today.
[00:49.660 --> 00:55.460]  We've got FBI seizing smashed hard drives from Debbie Wasserman Schultz home and her
[00:55.460 --> 00:57.000]  IT staffs home.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.680]  We've got a Bay Area ISIS supporter being arrested for colluding with ISIS, said he
[01:02.680 --> 01:04.800]  would kill 10,000 people.
[01:04.800 --> 01:08.160]  You've got President Trump calling out the Amazon Post.
[01:08.160 --> 01:13.560]  You've got a Newsweek attack on Alex Jones, the latest claiming he's the one calling for
[01:13.560 --> 01:14.720]  civil war.
[01:14.720 --> 01:19.040]  You've got the former CIA director calling for a coup against Donald Trump.
[01:19.040 --> 01:20.480]  No, that's already going on.
[01:20.480 --> 01:25.640]  John Boehner has just said Republicans will never repeal and replace Obamacare.
[01:25.640 --> 01:31.640]  I think Rudy Giuliani has decided he does not want Attorney General Jeff Sessions job.
[01:31.640 --> 01:33.240]  He made that pretty clear.
[01:33.240 --> 01:34.240]  Did he, didn't he?
[01:34.240 --> 01:39.720]  Princeton's new men's engagement manager to combat masculinity on campus.
[01:39.720 --> 01:44.440]  New U.S. Naval aircraft carrier does not have urinals.
[01:44.440 --> 01:46.040]  President Trump, the Trump effect is winning.
[01:46.040 --> 01:49.480]  New S&P highs, confidence in America is up.
[01:49.480 --> 01:52.660]  And then we got some video of Trump speaking to Boy Scouts yesterday.
[01:52.660 --> 01:53.820]  That was powerful.
[01:53.820 --> 01:59.200]  You've got the Democrats waging trade war right now with Russian sanctions.
[01:59.200 --> 02:00.920]  We're gonna have more on Jeff Sessions.
[02:00.920 --> 02:04.480]  Will he still be the Attorney General by the time we get off air?
[02:04.480 --> 02:06.920]  More on the coup against Donald Trump.
[02:06.920 --> 02:09.360]  And we're gonna talk about sanctuary cities.
[02:09.360 --> 02:10.360]  And are they safer?
[02:10.360 --> 02:11.360]  Are they not?
[02:11.360 --> 02:15.840]  Are they leading to more deaths as well as developments in the Ukraine?
[02:15.840 --> 02:19.080]  All that, all kinds of clips, going to be a stocked show.
[02:19.080 --> 02:20.400]  There's the waterfront, David Knight.
[02:20.400 --> 02:24.640]  Yeah, let's talk about what's going on here with this coup, because we know this is something
[02:24.640 --> 02:26.760]  that's been happening for a long time.
[02:26.760 --> 02:32.240]  But now we've got the ex-CIA director, who really needs to be investigated by a real
[02:32.240 --> 02:35.840]  attorney general for violating the Hatch Act and for other crimes that have been pointed
[02:35.840 --> 02:39.240]  out by none other than the FISA court.
[02:39.240 --> 02:43.360]  And so we need to have an investigation of what the dark state has been doing in terms
[02:43.360 --> 02:46.920]  of Alex Pinaj, and that's really what is happening here.
[02:46.920 --> 02:48.400]  But now they're getting very bold about this.
[02:48.400 --> 02:50.800]  Now they're openly calling for a coup against Trump.
[02:50.800 --> 02:57.880]  We also have the Democrats pushing Trump into a corner with all of this Russian narrative,
[02:57.880 --> 02:59.480]  pushing for trade sanctions.
[02:59.480 --> 03:02.480]  And the trade sanctions that they're pushing for have a couple of components here.
[03:02.480 --> 03:05.760]  This is a no-win situation for Trump if he takes this bait.
[03:05.760 --> 03:09.280]  And there's indications in the White House that they're warming up to this.
[03:09.280 --> 03:14.360]  The Republicans say, well, we'll give you sanctions against Russia if you give us sanctions
[03:14.360 --> 03:16.600]  against Iran and North Korea.
[03:16.600 --> 03:22.720]  The problem is, the sanctions against Russia are about the natural gas pipeline that Europe
[03:22.720 --> 03:23.720]  depends on.
[03:23.720 --> 03:26.480]  So now Europe is saying, within days, we're going to react to this.
[03:26.480 --> 03:28.720]  This is an internal memo that came out yesterday.
[03:28.720 --> 03:30.000]  We didn't have time to talk about that yesterday.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.080]  We're going to talk about it today and about developing trends here.
[03:33.080 --> 03:38.360]  This is the groundwork for a worldwide trade war, folks.
[03:38.360 --> 03:46.280]  And this is all coming from the Democrats using this Russian triangulation to paint Trump
[03:46.280 --> 03:47.480]  into a corner.
[03:47.480 --> 03:49.880]  Very important that we understand what's going on here.
[03:49.880 --> 03:54.840]  Meanwhile, in this sanctuary city issue, we had this story that was a national story because
[03:54.840 --> 04:01.040]  we had, I think it's now 10 people that died in that truck at Walmart in San Antonio.
[04:01.040 --> 04:06.120]  The Texas Lieutenant Governor came out and said, this is something that is a responsibility
[04:06.120 --> 04:07.120]  to the sanctuary cities.
[04:07.120 --> 04:08.960]  And of course, they got very angry about that.
[04:08.960 --> 04:15.160]  We're going to give you proof as to why the Texas Lieutenant Governor is right, why this
[04:15.160 --> 04:17.280]  is something that is the responsibility.
[04:17.280 --> 04:18.440]  They're contributing to this.
[04:18.440 --> 04:22.120]  Of course, the direct cause of this, of course, is the drug cartels.
[04:22.120 --> 04:26.360]  But he's made the point, are you going to pay $5,000 or $10,000 to a drug cartel to smuggle
[04:26.360 --> 04:27.360]  you in?
[04:27.360 --> 04:30.480]  Or would you rather pay a couple hundred dollars and come in legally?
[04:30.480 --> 04:33.240]  Can we have legal immigration in this country?
[04:33.240 --> 04:38.200]  Or are we going to turn ourselves over to the cartels and let them murder people like
[04:38.200 --> 04:39.200]  that?
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.720]  That's what the sanctuary cities are encouraging.
[04:40.720 --> 04:42.800]  And we'll prove that to you when we come back.
[04:42.800 --> 04:43.800]  Stay with us.
[04:43.800 --> 04:45.160]  We've got all of that.
[04:45.160 --> 04:50.200]  And Trump has appointed a new lawyer to a White House counsel job.
[04:50.200 --> 04:52.360]  This new lawyer's name is Ty Cobb.
[04:52.360 --> 04:55.200]  And he says he has balls of steel.
[04:55.200 --> 04:57.120]  That's exactly what Trump needs in a lawyer right now.
[04:57.120 --> 04:59.040]  He used to be a baseball player named Ty Cobb, right?
[04:59.040 --> 05:06.080]  He had balls of steel, too.
[05:06.080 --> 05:08.160]  Water is the sea.
[05:08.160 --> 05:13.200]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise, not from objects in their
[05:13.200 --> 05:18.800]  constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright
[05:18.800 --> 05:22.200]  ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[05:22.200 --> 05:26.320]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[05:26.320 --> 05:28.880]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[05:28.880 --> 05:31.120]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[05:31.120 --> 05:36.880]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles
[05:36.880 --> 05:37.880]  and to profit from it?
[05:37.880 --> 05:42.200]  What kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American
[05:42.200 --> 05:43.200]  people?
[05:43.200 --> 05:47.320]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[05:47.320 --> 05:49.680]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[05:49.680 --> 05:54.720]  Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[05:54.720 --> 06:00.080]  Join the InfoWars, spread the information, educate yourself and others, the truth shall
[06:00.080 --> 06:01.080]  set you free.
[06:01.080 --> 06:07.000]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[06:07.000 --> 06:11.800]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[06:11.800 --> 06:16.080]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact
[06:16.080 --> 06:21.320]  that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in
[06:21.320 --> 06:24.640]  many cases had much better nutrition than we do today.
[06:24.640 --> 06:30.160]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing
[06:30.160 --> 06:31.160]  and then processing.
[06:31.160 --> 06:36.600]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from
[06:36.600 --> 06:43.360]  chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the
[06:43.360 --> 06:45.480]  body at the same time.
[06:45.480 --> 06:49.880]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalist, we're getting results and we're expanding
[06:49.880 --> 06:55.040]  in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[06:55.040 --> 06:57.760]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[06:57.760 --> 07:03.200]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com or
[07:03.200 --> 07:07.280]  by calling toll free triple A 253 3139.
[07:07.280 --> 07:11.240]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[07:11.240 --> 07:16.600]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWars, a 360 win.
[07:16.600 --> 07:21.600]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[07:21.600 --> 07:23.160]  at infowarsore.com.
[07:23.160 --> 07:27.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.080]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[07:31.080 --> 07:36.360]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[07:36.360 --> 07:40.440]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[07:40.440 --> 07:42.200]  the products that you need each month.
[07:42.200 --> 07:46.800]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and
[07:46.800 --> 07:49.960]  choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[07:49.960 --> 07:55.240]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[07:55.240 --> 07:58.200]  this is a sure win, 10% off on auto ship.
[07:58.200 --> 08:04.040]  Win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50 and all out of stock items
[08:04.040 --> 08:17.880]  are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[08:17.880 --> 08:23.200]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[08:23.200 --> 08:30.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[08:30.760 --> 08:34.800]  So here in America, we're at a turning point tonight with forces now forming an alliance
[08:34.800 --> 08:37.200]  to try and remove President Trump from office.
[08:37.200 --> 08:38.200]  It's that serious.
[08:38.200 --> 08:39.760]  This is not a diversionary tactic.
[08:39.760 --> 08:40.800]  This stuff is real here.
[08:40.800 --> 08:44.440]  This coup, this silent coup that is taking place is real.
[08:44.440 --> 08:50.840]  A soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to overturn
[08:50.840 --> 08:56.960]  November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president from office.
[08:56.960 --> 09:02.240]  Sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind, a clear and present
[09:02.240 --> 09:03.240]  danger.
[09:03.240 --> 09:09.120]  I got to go into the Congress and spend three hours from 9.30 in the evening to 12.30 a.m.
[09:09.120 --> 09:14.880]  with one of the senior ranking members of Congress and he told me, and of course this
[09:14.880 --> 09:18.320]  is what I said on CBN but they cut it out, but I'm going to go public with this because
[09:18.320 --> 09:19.600]  we have to.
[09:19.600 --> 09:23.600]  He said, there is a plot on Capitol Hill to take the president out.
[09:23.600 --> 09:28.240]  I said, you mean by impeachment or by not, but he said, no, to take him out.
[09:28.240 --> 09:33.360]  This is an effort to subvert the administration of President Donald Trump.
[09:33.360 --> 09:34.560]  It is nothing less.
[09:34.560 --> 09:40.200]  It is an effort by the deep state to roll over a duly elected president and the legitimate
[09:40.200 --> 09:44.460]  government and to break the will of the American people.
[09:44.460 --> 09:45.720]  You can read between the lines.
[09:45.720 --> 09:48.480]  I said, look, I said, that's not going to happen.
[09:48.480 --> 09:51.040]  He said, well, really, there's nothing we can do to stop it.
[09:51.040 --> 09:56.280]  I said, we are going to stop it because we are going to mobilize the body of Christ to
[09:56.280 --> 09:57.280]  pray.
[09:57.280 --> 10:00.760]  And the best description of it is by Barry Castleman in his blog where he said, this
[10:00.760 --> 10:02.400]  is a coup d'etat.
[10:02.400 --> 10:07.960]  He said, 14 million citizens in private ballots picked Donald Trump, 20 TV executives have
[10:07.960 --> 10:09.360]  decided to destroy him.
[10:09.360 --> 10:15.200]  This is no longer about Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals.
[10:15.200 --> 10:23.160]  This is about a full on assault by the left, the Democratic Party, to absolutely carry
[10:23.160 --> 10:26.160]  out a coup d'etat against President Trump.
[10:26.160 --> 10:28.280]  So let's be very clear.
[10:28.280 --> 10:31.200]  This is something that the Democrats have been doing since the very beginning.
[10:31.200 --> 10:37.160]  This is what Project Veritas exposed with the inner workings and Aaron Black and these
[10:37.160 --> 10:39.720]  people causing violence on the streets.
[10:39.720 --> 10:40.720]  This is what they did.
[10:40.720 --> 10:45.760]  This is why Debbie Washington Schultz had her hard drive picked up today by the FBI.
[10:45.760 --> 10:50.240]  This is why Bernie Sanders supporters are suing the DNC right now.
[10:50.240 --> 10:51.960]  It's all the same thing.
[10:51.960 --> 10:55.760]  It's all because Trump got in the White House and he wasn't supposed to.
[10:55.760 --> 10:59.040]  So now there's a coup to try to take him out.
[10:59.040 --> 11:01.640]  You have George Soros funding these protests.
[11:01.640 --> 11:02.880]  So we have all this evidence.
[11:02.880 --> 11:06.160]  We know that all this is going on, not even talking about all the witch ceremonies that
[11:06.160 --> 11:07.400]  are going on against Trump.
[11:07.400 --> 11:09.400]  We have all this evidence that's going on.
[11:09.400 --> 11:14.640]  Everybody knows it now, even mainstream conservatives, mainline conservative media, it is all telling
[11:14.640 --> 11:17.280]  you about the coup against Donald Trump.
[11:17.280 --> 11:20.200]  But what did John Brennan have to say?
[11:20.200 --> 11:22.320]  John Brennan stepped out of reality.
[11:22.320 --> 11:25.600]  Actually, it was Brennan and who else was in that conference?
[11:25.600 --> 11:26.600]  Do you remember who it was?
[11:26.600 --> 11:27.600]  It was like Clapper.
[11:27.600 --> 11:28.600]  Thank you.
[11:28.600 --> 11:29.600]  Some Aspen conference.
[11:29.600 --> 11:30.600]  They spoke for an hour.
[11:30.600 --> 11:32.160]  Nothing but propaganda for an hour.
[11:32.160 --> 11:37.440]  But here's the FBI director, former FBI director, saying that if Trump fires Mueller, there should
[11:37.440 --> 11:39.760]  be a coup against Trump.
[11:39.760 --> 11:44.720]  But this is where the work of Robert Mueller is critical to our future as a country because
[11:44.720 --> 11:49.240]  I, you know, in some respects, we're a government and a nation in crisis right now.
[11:49.240 --> 11:51.800]  You have confidence in this special counsel?
[11:51.800 --> 11:52.800]  Absolutely.
[11:52.800 --> 11:53.800]  You both worked with him.
[11:53.800 --> 11:54.800]  A bunch of Clinton lawyers.
[11:54.800 --> 11:55.800]  Absolutely.
[11:55.800 --> 11:57.720]  That was an expired choice.
[11:57.720 --> 11:59.720]  They don't come any better.
[11:59.720 --> 12:04.280]  Nobody better than Bob Mueller, who is a straight shooter and will not be intimidated.
[12:04.280 --> 12:05.280]  Just look at these two liars.
[12:05.280 --> 12:06.280]  Look at their body language.
[12:06.280 --> 12:09.320]  They can't look anyone in the eye.
[12:09.320 --> 12:12.400]  I really hope that our members of Congress or elected representatives are going to stand
[12:12.400 --> 12:17.880]  up and say enough is enough and stop making apologies and excuses for things that are happening
[12:17.880 --> 12:18.880]  that really...
[12:18.880 --> 12:21.840]  Meanwhile, the Russian probe conspiracy theory.
[12:21.840 --> 12:29.360]  When you say enough is enough, if he's fired, he's the president of the United States.
[12:29.360 --> 12:32.000]  He could tell Rosenstein to fire him if he wants.
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.080]  But if he's fired, what would you want Congress to do?
[12:36.080 --> 12:39.280]  First of all, I think it's the obligation of some executive branch officials to refuse
[12:39.280 --> 12:44.160]  to carry out some of these orders that, again, are inconsistent with what this country is
[12:44.160 --> 12:47.160]  all about.
[12:47.160 --> 12:53.600]  I would just hope that this is not going to be a partisan issue, that Republicans, Democrats
[12:53.600 --> 12:57.160]  are going to see the future of this country is at stake, and there needs to be some things
[12:57.160 --> 12:59.840]  done for the good of the future.
[12:59.840 --> 13:02.120]  So John Brennan thinks he's above the American people.
[13:02.120 --> 13:03.120]  That's all that is.
[13:03.120 --> 13:04.720]  That arrogant punk.
[13:04.720 --> 13:07.600]  The truth of the matter is, David, what I think they're trying to do here is the same
[13:07.600 --> 13:10.800]  tactic that they did with this whole Russia thing, they're trying to get out ahead of
[13:10.800 --> 13:13.720]  him firing Mueller, because Mueller should have been fired months ago.
[13:13.720 --> 13:15.520]  What is he even doing?
[13:15.520 --> 13:16.520]  What is he even doing?
[13:16.520 --> 13:17.520]  Nobody even knows what he's doing.
[13:17.520 --> 13:18.520]  He's getting paid.
[13:18.520 --> 13:20.000]  He's got all these Clinton lawyers working for him.
[13:20.000 --> 13:21.000]  He's got an army of lawyers.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.400]  They've been working on this stuff now for about a year.
[13:23.400 --> 13:27.200]  When I look at that interview, I got to say the thing that bothers me so much, the thing
[13:27.200 --> 13:32.000]  that sticks out to me, is that we've got the former director of the CIA and the director
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.440]  of National Intelligence and all those holding press conferences, essentially, with-
[13:37.440 --> 13:38.440]  With Wolf Blitzer.
[13:38.440 --> 13:39.440]  Wolf Blitzer.
[13:39.440 --> 13:40.440]  Wolf Blitzer.
[13:40.440 --> 13:41.440]  I've never seen that before.
[13:41.440 --> 13:42.440]  Who cried when Hillary lost?
[13:42.440 --> 13:46.320]  Who has ever seen our intelligence officials?
[13:46.320 --> 13:51.680]  This actively involved, and not only after the election, but really before the election.
[13:51.680 --> 13:55.480]  And that's what needs to be investigated, the Hatch Act involvement of these individuals
[13:55.480 --> 13:57.440]  and supporting Hillary Clinton.
[13:57.440 --> 14:02.280]  Megyn Kelly was here after the interview, she said to me, she said, well, did you see
[14:02.280 --> 14:03.280]  the Putin interview?
[14:03.280 --> 14:05.760]  And I said, I'm not worried about Putin.
[14:05.760 --> 14:09.920]  I'm worried about Brennan and Clapper and Michael Hayden and these people.
[14:09.920 --> 14:14.440]  I said, I'm worried about the American spies who are manipulating our election.
[14:14.440 --> 14:17.920]  I call it elect espionage, because that's really what we had happening here.
[14:17.920 --> 14:23.520]  You understand that when we go back to the DNC, right, it was the crimes of Hillary and
[14:23.520 --> 14:29.720]  those that were part of, allied with her within the DNC against Bernie Sanders that were exposed.
[14:29.720 --> 14:33.800]  And then to keep people from looking at those crimes, they created this fake narrative about
[14:33.800 --> 14:35.360]  Russian hacking.
[14:35.360 --> 14:39.780]  They were the ones later on then that started saying, well, the Russians hacked our election.
[14:39.780 --> 14:44.360]  They would always come back and these same individuals would say, we're not alleging
[14:44.360 --> 14:47.120]  that any votes were switched in machines.
[14:47.120 --> 14:49.360]  We're not saying that that kind of hacking went on.
[14:49.360 --> 14:51.760]  What we're saying is that they manipulated public opinion.
[14:51.760 --> 14:58.040]  Oh really, didn't the CIA, the NSA, the director of national intelligence, weren't they manipulating
[14:58.040 --> 15:03.280]  public opinion along with the press and the Democrats to manipulate and to hack our election?
[15:03.280 --> 15:04.280]  That's the reality.
[15:04.280 --> 15:05.280]  And yet they do the same thing.
[15:05.280 --> 15:09.360]  To cover their crimes, they switch it to a foreign country.
[15:09.360 --> 15:13.320]  And Julian Assange has told us it wasn't a foreign source that gave us that information
[15:13.320 --> 15:14.440]  about the DNC.
[15:14.440 --> 15:16.560]  And we have numerous evidence about that.
[15:16.560 --> 15:21.000]  We have testimony from a former UK ambassador who said, I came to the United States.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.920]  I was handed this by a whistleblower who was a Bernie supporter who was upset about the
[15:24.920 --> 15:30.160]  corruption in the Democrat Party and how they hacked the election against Bernie Sanders.
[15:30.160 --> 15:35.480]  They did the same thing except it expanded and included our intelligence services.
[15:35.480 --> 15:41.800]  And you have to understand how dangerous this is when we have this massive dark state that
[15:41.800 --> 15:45.280]  has been created that is now openly politicized.
[15:45.280 --> 15:51.400]  I have never in my life seen the directors of these intelligence agencies testifying.
[15:51.400 --> 15:56.760]  It was a big deal when they had the Frank Church hearings in the 1970s.
[15:56.760 --> 15:57.760]  Why?
[15:57.760 --> 15:59.760]  Because they were spying on the American people.
[15:59.760 --> 16:02.160]  So they called up the director of the CIA.
[16:02.160 --> 16:05.640]  The CIA was furious about that because he exposed their secrets.
[16:05.640 --> 16:10.960]  But you never saw these people testifying in public, let alone holding continual press
[16:10.960 --> 16:15.680]  conferences with the press that they're allied, with the Democrat press that they're allied.
[16:15.680 --> 16:17.640]  This is absolutely unprecedented.
[16:17.640 --> 16:20.200]  Most of you probably don't know who these people were.
[16:20.200 --> 16:26.400]  And in the past, before Snowden, NSA, everybody would joke stood for no such agency.
[16:26.400 --> 16:31.920]  At the time that we had the Frank Church hearings, the House was also holding hearings on the
[16:31.920 --> 16:36.160]  CIA and the NSA spying on Americans illegally.
[16:36.160 --> 16:41.480]  What was born out of that was the FISA Act, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[16:41.480 --> 16:46.800]  And it was that court now who has told us that these agencies violated the law to spy
[16:46.800 --> 16:52.120]  on the Trump administration officials and to also violate the Constitution, as if that
[16:52.120 --> 16:53.600]  made any difference anymore.
[16:53.600 --> 16:59.600]  But they also violated the prohibitions exposing these people, as we know Obama officials
[16:59.600 --> 17:00.600]  were involved in.
[17:00.600 --> 17:06.840]  But at the time of the Pike hearings in the House, going concurrently with the Church hearings,
[17:06.840 --> 17:12.440]  when the NSA official came to the Pike hearings, he said, the guy who was running at Pike said,
[17:12.440 --> 17:15.640]  I'd like to see your documents that created the NSA.
[17:15.640 --> 17:19.160]  They were created by an executive order by President Truman.
[17:19.160 --> 17:22.360]  And the head of the NSA said, I'm not going to show them to you.
[17:22.360 --> 17:24.960]  That's how closely held they were.
[17:24.960 --> 17:26.240]  That's how secret they were.
[17:26.240 --> 17:28.520]  That's how behind the scenes they were.
[17:28.520 --> 17:31.960]  Now they're out in public, they're talking about coups.
[17:31.960 --> 17:36.520]  They're talking about politics, incredibly politicized.
[17:36.520 --> 17:38.920]  And that's the danger, folks.
[17:38.920 --> 17:42.200]  This is completely different and it is out of control.
[17:42.200 --> 17:46.400]  What you don't see now, and what's going to be coming out soon, is what they're doing
[17:46.400 --> 17:52.240]  behind the scenes in terms of the massive total information awareness, dragnet surveillance
[17:52.240 --> 17:55.960]  of metadata that they're putting together, this geospatial intelligence.
[17:55.960 --> 17:58.280]  James Clapper is the head of that.
[17:58.280 --> 17:59.440]  He has been running that.
[17:59.440 --> 18:02.520]  That is the fastest growing part of the intelligence service.
[18:02.520 --> 18:04.960]  That is how they're going to control you in every aspect.
[18:04.960 --> 18:10.640]  But they're controlling you now with the political narrative going on shows like CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
[18:10.640 --> 18:15.040]  That's what absolutely amazes me, is how politicized openly these people are.
[18:15.040 --> 18:16.920]  So you've got all of this evidence.
[18:16.920 --> 18:18.400]  This is what Trump needs to do.
[18:18.400 --> 18:23.160]  Trump needs to do what he did with, I forget what it was, I think it was the process it
[18:23.160 --> 18:27.720]  took just to get a highway or something, a road paved, and he put all the stacks of documents.
[18:27.720 --> 18:32.880]  He needs to stack the documents of all the evidence with the Clinton campaign, Wasserman
[18:32.880 --> 18:36.600]  Schultz, all the evidence about them colluding, them breaking the law, literally probably
[18:36.600 --> 18:38.440]  break a folding table.
[18:38.440 --> 18:42.280]  And then put the evidence next to that of him colluding with Russia, Kushner colluding
[18:42.280 --> 18:45.920]  with Russia, his son colluding with Russia, and all that, just to compare it.
[18:45.920 --> 18:49.520]  Because we're going to get to this clip when we get back.
[18:49.520 --> 18:53.720]  Representative Gutierrez now has called on Democrats to eliminate Trump.
[18:53.720 --> 18:55.320]  We're going to get to that clip when we get back.
[18:55.320 --> 19:00.600]  But we're also going to get to this today, exclusive FBIC smash hard drive from Wasserman
[19:00.600 --> 19:02.920]  Schultz, ITA's home.
[19:02.920 --> 19:07.560]  This report should open the eyes of everyone.
[19:07.560 --> 19:11.740]  This report should show everyone who voted for Hillary Clinton, who you really voted
[19:11.740 --> 19:12.740]  for.
[19:12.740 --> 19:15.000]  Why are they trying to hide this stuff?
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.480]  Who smashes hard drives?
[19:17.480 --> 19:20.560]  And it wasn't just her, it was her IT staff.
[19:20.560 --> 19:22.880]  And guess what's about to get blown out?
[19:22.880 --> 19:27.960]  The Awan brothers, folks, this is going to blow the story of the Awan brothers out of
[19:27.960 --> 19:28.960]  the water.
[19:28.960 --> 19:33.280]  And everybody who's sitting there crying over Trump is going to look like a complete
[19:33.280 --> 19:37.440]  fool when the final analysis of this case is revealed.
[19:37.440 --> 19:41.040]  It's going to be an amazing case of either corruption or incompetence.
[19:41.040 --> 19:42.760]  I think we're going to find it's corruption.
[19:42.760 --> 19:44.760]  We're going to find it's corruption, David.
[19:44.760 --> 19:49.200]  But the incompetence, even if they try to defend themselves, the incompetence is indefensible.
[19:49.200 --> 19:51.000]  Even if they say they're not corrupt, we'll be right back.
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  We'll be right back.
[19:52.000 --> 19:53.880]  So, Owen Troyer, David Knight, more on the other side.
[19:53.880 --> 19:54.880]  More clips.
[19:54.880 --> 20:05.960]  They're calling for a coup against Trump.
[20:05.960 --> 20:07.560]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[20:07.560 --> 20:12.320]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.

[20:13.320 --> 20:14.320]  I use some.
[20:14.320 --> 20:15.320]  I store some.

[21:10.680 --> 21:14.440]  The first shipment of super blue sold out in one week, I thought it would be a six-month
[21:14.440 --> 21:15.440]  supply for listeners.
[21:15.440 --> 21:19.720]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their

[21:47.040 --> 21:49.480]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.

[24:29.680 --> 24:33.360]  We're going to be joined in the fourth hour by Roger Stone.
[24:33.360 --> 24:37.800]  He's going to be talking to us, I'm sure, about what's going on in Washington.
[24:37.800 --> 24:42.720]  His longtime partner, Paul Manafort, they're pushing to have him testify in Congress.
[24:42.720 --> 24:45.280]  So I'm sure that Roger Stone is going to have something to say about that.
[24:45.280 --> 24:48.960]  And of course, at the center of that, what they're going to be talking to him about is
[24:48.960 --> 24:49.960]  Ukraine.
[24:49.960 --> 24:53.800]  And in the next hour, let's see, it's going to be actually in our third hour, right?
[24:53.800 --> 24:58.960]  We're going to have Lee Stranahan coming on, talking to us to check on the time.
[24:58.960 --> 25:01.240]  But anyway, Lee Stranahan is going to be coming up in the show.
[25:01.240 --> 25:02.240]  Next hour.
[25:02.240 --> 25:04.680]  Next hour, we're going to have Lee Stranahan.
[25:04.680 --> 25:10.040]  And he is going to break down for us what the press is telling us there's no evidence
[25:10.040 --> 25:11.040]  of.
[25:11.040 --> 25:12.280]  Check out this headline here.
[25:12.280 --> 25:19.880]  This is from Reuters, says, Trump without evidence, sites Ukraine ties to ex-rival Clinton.
[25:19.880 --> 25:21.360]  With no evidence, really?
[25:21.360 --> 25:27.320]  Well, there may be no evidence that Reuters has printed, but there has been a lot of discussion
[25:27.320 --> 25:29.280]  about this going all the way back to January.
[25:29.280 --> 25:31.880]  Politico had a story there, and it has been there.
[25:31.880 --> 25:34.400]  It's just not reported by the mainstream media.
[25:34.400 --> 25:36.680]  So they pretend that it doesn't exist.
[25:36.680 --> 25:39.760]  We're going to break down those connections for you with Lee Stranahan coming up in the
[25:39.760 --> 25:40.760]  next hour.
[25:40.760 --> 25:44.240]  And as I pointed out, I'm sure that Roger Stone is going to have a great deal to say about
[25:44.240 --> 25:45.240]  that as well.
[25:45.240 --> 25:51.600]  Now, we're talking about the cover-up, the deep state cover-up, and now the open coup
[25:51.600 --> 25:57.240]  that is being talked about by former CIA director saying, and this was on a program with CNN's
[25:57.240 --> 25:58.240]  Wolf Blitzer.
[25:58.240 --> 26:00.600]  We played the clip for you in the last segment.
[26:00.600 --> 26:05.640]  But he said, I think it's the obligation of some executive branch officials to refuse
[26:05.640 --> 26:11.880]  to carry out the order if the White House were to fire Robert Mueller.
[26:11.880 --> 26:18.240]  But as Zero Hedge points out, that is effectively calling for a coup against the president.
[26:18.240 --> 26:24.280]  He has the authority to shut down and fire the special prosecutor, especially when they
[26:24.280 --> 26:28.840]  have been going for a year with this investigation, with an army of investigators, and they haven't
[26:28.840 --> 26:29.840]  found anything.
[26:29.840 --> 26:36.360]  Especially when you've got a special prosecutor whose law firm gave over 90%, I can't recall
[26:36.360 --> 26:41.840]  was it, it was 90-some odd percent that they gave to Hillary Clinton and to Democrats.
[26:41.840 --> 26:45.440]  This guy is heavily involved, heavily politicized.
[26:45.440 --> 26:47.640]  This is not a neutral investigation.
[26:47.640 --> 26:51.600]  And of course, at the same time, we don't have any investigation into what's going on
[26:51.600 --> 26:58.280]  with Hillary or the DNC or other ancillary issues, like the governor of Virginia, Terry
[26:58.280 --> 26:59.280]  McAuliffe.
[26:59.280 --> 27:04.320]  None of this is being investigated by Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions.
[27:04.320 --> 27:08.800]  Jeff Sessions has an obsession with marijuana.
[27:08.800 --> 27:12.080]  And so now he's gearing up for a crackdown on marijuana.
[27:12.080 --> 27:15.320]  He just hasn't gotten the message.
[27:15.320 --> 27:24.680]  And he's off another tangent jousting at windmills, trying to stop people from taking drugs.
[27:24.680 --> 27:29.800]  And of course, we have in the United States, we have the legalization of recreational marijuana
[27:29.800 --> 27:34.600]  and eight states in the District of Columbia, we have 21 states that allow it for medical
[27:34.600 --> 27:35.600]  use.
[27:35.600 --> 27:41.520]  But Jeff Sessions is obsessed with not only pot, but he's obsessed with funding police
[27:41.520 --> 27:48.400]  departments with stolen property that they've never even charged anybody with a crime for,
[27:48.400 --> 27:49.480]  let alone found them guilty.
[27:49.480 --> 27:51.360]  It's called civil asset forfeiture.
[27:51.360 --> 27:57.240]  He wants to expand that because there's been so much abuse of that that we've had 24 states
[27:57.240 --> 27:58.240]  in act reform.
[27:58.240 --> 28:01.680]  So Jeff Sessions has come up with an idea that the federal government will seize the
[28:01.680 --> 28:08.320]  money and then kick it back, 80% of it back to local law enforcement, to get around the
[28:08.320 --> 28:09.800]  reform at the state level.
[28:09.800 --> 28:13.400]  He has absolutely no respect for states rights.
[28:13.400 --> 28:16.840]  And so he's violating the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment,
[28:16.840 --> 28:20.480]  with a drug prohibition with spying on people, with civil asset forfeiture.
[28:20.480 --> 28:22.980]  Now he wants to violate the Ninth and Tenth Amendment.
[28:22.980 --> 28:27.360]  So that's half of the Bill of Rights right there for you for somebody who is our Attorney
[28:27.360 --> 28:30.600]  General, the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the country.
[28:30.600 --> 28:33.280]  So for that reason alone, I would support him being removed.
[28:33.280 --> 28:38.920]  But he is definitely his task force, doesn't have the right goals, the right priorities.
[28:38.920 --> 28:39.920]  It's very clear.
[28:39.920 --> 28:42.480]  And Donald Trump has been tweeting about it quite a bit lately.
[28:42.480 --> 28:45.800]  So we expect to see some kind of announcement on that today, don't we, Owen?
[28:45.800 --> 28:51.720]  Well, I think that it's obvious now that Trump is unhappy that there's been inaction from
[28:51.720 --> 28:59.240]  sessions into the Clinton investigation, into the Clinton emails, and as Scaramucci said,
[28:59.240 --> 29:03.760]  as soon as these things go public, it usually doesn't mean good news for the guy on the
[29:03.760 --> 29:05.280]  other side of Trump.
[29:05.280 --> 29:07.600]  And now it was rumored that Giuliani might be the new one.
[29:07.600 --> 29:11.320]  Giuliani says Jeff Sessions made the right decision to recuse from Russian probe.
[29:11.320 --> 29:14.960]  To me, that's Giuliani saying, Trump, please do not give me this job.
[29:14.960 --> 29:16.680]  I think that's exactly what that means.
[29:16.680 --> 29:21.000]  But just to be clear, again, on the former CIA director saying that there needs to be
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.120]  a coup against Trump, the coup has already happened.
[29:23.120 --> 29:24.520]  Look at the circuit courts.
[29:24.520 --> 29:28.240]  Look at the fact that the Republicans wouldn't repeal Obamacare.
[29:28.240 --> 29:29.240]  And here's the thing too, David.
[29:29.240 --> 29:32.360]  The news is that they're just coming out with it, but don't be admitting it.
[29:32.360 --> 29:37.440]  We can't be confused and say, oh, yes, it was just those three women that didn't want
[29:37.440 --> 29:38.440]  it.
[29:38.440 --> 29:40.920]  No, the Republicans colluded to make Trump look bad.
[29:40.920 --> 29:42.800]  None of the Republicans wanted the repeal.
[29:42.800 --> 29:47.120]  Meanwhile, are crushed drives from the DNC by Debbie Wasserman Schultz?
[29:47.120 --> 29:49.000]  Is that obstruction of justice?
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  I would think so.
[29:51.000 --> 29:54.920]  We'll be right back.
[29:54.920 --> 29:56.200]  We're on the march.
[29:56.200 --> 29:58.720]  The empire's on the run.
[29:58.720 --> 30:06.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:06.840 --> 30:09.760]  December 23, 1776.
[30:09.760 --> 30:12.240]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[30:12.240 --> 30:16.480]  The summer soldier and the Sunshine Patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service
[30:16.480 --> 30:21.840]  of their country, but he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and
[30:21.840 --> 30:22.840]  woman.
[30:22.840 --> 30:26.800]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered, yet we have this consolation with us that
[30:26.800 --> 30:29.800]  the heart of the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[30:29.800 --> 30:34.760]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly, it is dearness only that gives everything
[30:34.760 --> 30:35.760]  its value.
[30:35.760 --> 30:40.520]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods, and it would be strange indeed
[30:40.520 --> 30:44.480]  if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[30:44.480 --> 30:49.120]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only
[30:49.120 --> 30:52.880]  to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[30:52.880 --> 30:57.120]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery
[30:57.120 --> 30:58.120]  upon earth.
[30:58.120 --> 31:03.920]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[31:03.920 --> 31:27.000]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[31:27.000 --> 31:40.360]  That's what I'm talking about, and when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like
[31:40.360 --> 31:44.920]  canning or dehydrating, you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no
[31:44.920 --> 31:45.920]  comparison.
[31:45.920 --> 31:51.960]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value
[31:51.960 --> 31:55.440]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[31:55.440 --> 31:59.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[31:59.000 --> 32:03.000]  Harvest right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[32:03.000 --> 32:04.000]  So what are you waiting for?
[32:04.000 --> 32:07.000]  Check it out right now at infowarstore.com.
[32:07.000 --> 32:11.440]  More than two years ago, Info Wars first told you about our research into what has been
[32:11.440 --> 32:13.440]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[32:13.440 --> 32:17.560]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[32:17.560 --> 32:22.760]  devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[32:22.760 --> 32:26.480]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family into the water.
[32:26.480 --> 32:30.960]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in, and when the Fukushima
[32:30.960 --> 32:35.600]  crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare
[32:35.600 --> 32:37.160]  yourself and your family.
[32:37.160 --> 32:42.600]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[32:42.600 --> 32:48.400]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[32:48.400 --> 32:50.000]  ever concerning iodine.
[32:50.000 --> 32:51.960]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[32:51.960 --> 32:56.200]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[32:56.200 --> 32:58.200]  any optimum health regimen.

[33:26.000 --> 33:33.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, Owens Royer, David Knight, filling in for you here
[33:33.800 --> 33:41.560]  in the War for the Future, the War for America, and we have bombshell, huge breaking news
[33:41.560 --> 33:44.720]  at 2 o'clock central here with Roger Stone.
[33:44.720 --> 33:49.000]  Roger Stone is going to be joining us here on the Alex Jones Show at 2 o'clock central
[33:49.000 --> 33:54.080]  for gang busting news coming out of DC, coming out of the White House.

[33:58.560 --> 33:59.560]  at 2.
[33:59.560 --> 34:04.320]  Again, Lee Stranahan in the next hour, and we've got some big breaking news on the Debbie
[34:04.320 --> 34:09.320]  Wasserman Schultz computer hard drives being smashed, but before we get to that, I got
[34:09.320 --> 34:13.720]  to let you know about some of the specials going on at InfowarsStore.com.

[35:34.080 --> 35:37.560]  So you've got the deep state calling for a coup against Trump.
[35:37.560 --> 35:41.800]  The deep state has shown itself, shown its ugly head.
[35:41.800 --> 35:44.800]  You've got the former CIA director calling for a coup against Trump.
[35:44.800 --> 35:47.280]  We've seen the coup within the Republicans.
[35:47.280 --> 35:50.440]  We've seen the coup within the liberal circuit courts.
[35:50.440 --> 35:55.960]  And let me add too, because it was also Clapper sitting there nodding his head along with
[35:55.960 --> 35:57.600]  CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
[35:57.600 --> 36:02.440]  And it was Clapper's DNI who supported the contention that was put out there in an October
[36:02.440 --> 36:07.280]  debate by Hillary Clinton that all 17 agencies agreed that the Russians had hacked our elections.
[36:07.280 --> 36:11.040]  And then we had retraction from the New York Times and from Reuters who came out and said,
[36:11.040 --> 36:12.720]  no, it actually wasn't.
[36:12.720 --> 36:14.960]  One of them said it was four, one of them said it was three.
[36:14.960 --> 36:17.280]  Where did they come up with those numbers?
[36:17.280 --> 36:20.120]  Because they're just making, throwing these numbers out.
[36:20.120 --> 36:28.840]  Well, it was the NSA, the CIA, and the FBI that had a panel that came in and were presented
[36:28.840 --> 36:36.040]  by James Clapper with a report that came from CrowdStrike, a DNC contractor said the Russians
[36:36.040 --> 36:37.440]  hacked us.
[36:37.440 --> 36:41.480]  And they were never allowed to look at these servers, servers which have been smashed
[36:41.480 --> 36:45.040]  by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, they refused to turn this over to the FBI.
[36:45.040 --> 36:49.560]  So the FBI didn't do an investigation, the CIA and the NSA didn't do an investigation.
[36:49.560 --> 36:57.000]  Instead, they took a report from a DNC contractor, was presented to this handpicked panel of representatives
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.040]  from these three agencies.
[36:59.040 --> 37:01.960]  And of course, they're not going to go against the DNI.
[37:01.960 --> 37:02.960]  They're going to agree.
[37:02.960 --> 37:06.600]  And that's what we heard in testimony in May, we had Clapper come out and say, well, nobody
[37:06.600 --> 37:12.400]  objected to this, and so I presented this as head of all 17 agencies.
[37:12.400 --> 37:17.240]  So that means everybody, including the Coast Guard, agreed with the Russians hacked our
[37:17.240 --> 37:18.240]  election.
[37:18.240 --> 37:22.480]  That's the level of lies that we're seeing from these people and the level of collusion
[37:22.480 --> 37:27.720]  with the Democrats that our intelligence services and the leaders of the intelligence services
[37:27.720 --> 37:28.920]  were engaged in.
[37:28.920 --> 37:34.840]  And now they're engaged in political activity, openly calling for a coup against Donald Trump.
[37:34.840 --> 37:38.840]  So you've got the political coup from the deep state, then you've got liberal media calling
[37:38.840 --> 37:43.840]  for violence, Hollywood calling for violence against Trump, New York public leader pretending
[37:43.840 --> 37:47.720]  to assassinate Trump, Snoop Dogg pretending to assassinate Trump.
[37:47.720 --> 37:51.560]  And then yesterday, you had the breaking news of a pastor saying he met with a high-level
[37:51.560 --> 37:56.000]  congressman who said that there is a plan to take Trump out.
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.520]  It will be sudden and you can't stop it, read between the lines the pastor said.
[38:01.520 --> 38:10.720]  Then you have Representative Gutierrez, a Democrat, now saying that we have to eliminate Trump.
[38:10.720 --> 38:13.360]  These people are completely unhinged.
[38:13.360 --> 38:15.600]  Here's a clip of Representative Gutierrez.
[38:15.600 --> 38:25.880]  If I will not allow Donald Trump and all of his cronies to make America great again, we
[38:25.880 --> 38:26.880]  won't let them do it.
[38:26.880 --> 38:31.480]  We will not let them make America great again, we won't determine the future of 1.2 million
[38:31.480 --> 38:37.720]  people and millions of other undocumented workers in this country.
[38:37.720 --> 38:42.200]  I am clear, lawbreakers, line skippers, the dreamers are not criminals.
[38:42.200 --> 38:45.800]  Those who have TPS are not criminals.
[38:45.800 --> 38:47.800]  No, Obama's the criminal who brought him there.
[38:47.800 --> 38:52.720]  Millions of undocumented workers that work every day, sweat in toilet, some of the most
[38:52.720 --> 38:57.480]  miserable jobs in the United States of America are not criminals.
[38:57.480 --> 39:01.720]  We are going to determine, and history is going to determine who those criminals are.
[39:01.720 --> 39:06.560]  And for me, the major criminal that exists in the United States of America is called
[39:06.560 --> 39:07.560]  Donald Trump.
[39:07.560 --> 39:09.560]  He lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Pennsylvania.
[39:09.560 --> 39:13.360]  So we finally have a real president, we finally have a legitimate president, and this guy
[39:13.360 --> 39:14.360]  calls him a criminal.
[39:14.360 --> 39:20.600]  And we're going to take actions tomorrow and there will soon be a majority in the House
[39:20.600 --> 39:25.920]  of Representatives, and I'm going to make sure that I'm there to make sure of one thing,
[39:25.920 --> 39:30.880]  that we write those articles of impeachment and take them to trial before the Senate and
[39:30.880 --> 39:34.480]  eliminate him as president of the United States of America.
[39:34.480 --> 39:39.360]  Let me tell you, they actually will do that if they get a majority in the House.
[39:39.360 --> 39:43.640]  Because it is the House that writes the articles of impeachment, and they are not averse to
[39:43.640 --> 39:46.640]  just making up charges, as we have seen.
[39:46.640 --> 39:50.800]  And when he what talks about, I'm not going to let Donald Trump come after 1.2 million
[39:50.800 --> 39:52.800]  people, Owen.
[39:52.800 --> 39:56.720]  What we have to understand is that the Mexican government's been widely reported.
[39:56.720 --> 40:02.680]  The Mexican government is helping people who are here illegally to avoid detection, to
[40:02.680 --> 40:05.160]  violate our laws.
[40:05.160 --> 40:10.360]  They're using America as a pressure relief valve, because they don't want to pay for
[40:10.360 --> 40:11.760]  the education of their children.
[40:11.760 --> 40:14.200]  They send them to us and give us a tax bill.
[40:14.200 --> 40:15.800]  Well, we have a dream too.
[40:15.800 --> 40:18.080]  The American dream was to be able to own a home.
[40:18.080 --> 40:22.680]  And if you've got exploding property tax bills like we do here in Texas, and I'm sure you
[40:22.680 --> 40:29.720]  do, you can understand that a large amount of that is due to the uncontrolled immigration
[40:29.720 --> 40:32.880]  of people that we then have to pay for their education.
[40:32.880 --> 40:36.680]  People who get preferential education, even to American citizens.
[40:36.680 --> 40:40.720]  People who have lived here and worked here all of their life are not allowed to get in-state
[40:40.720 --> 40:42.400]  tuition in any state.
[40:42.400 --> 40:45.320]  And yet, illegals are allowed to do that.
[40:45.320 --> 40:46.320]  And so that's a key thing.
[40:46.320 --> 40:51.240]  And I think at this point, we need to talk about what happened with this trailer over
[40:51.240 --> 40:52.240]  the weekend.
[40:52.240 --> 40:55.880]  We had the tragedy of, there's nine or 10 people.
[40:55.880 --> 40:58.720]  I don't know what the current death toll is now.
[40:58.720 --> 41:01.280]  People who died in the back of the trailer, I'm sure that everyone has heard of that.
[41:01.280 --> 41:02.280]  They were being smuggled in.
[41:02.280 --> 41:06.360]  They weren't given any air conditioning or even any air to breathe, because they turned
[41:06.360 --> 41:10.120]  themselves over to criminals who brought them in.
[41:10.120 --> 41:15.440]  Now we had the Texas Attorney, Lieutenant Governor, Dan Patrick, immediately came out
[41:15.440 --> 41:19.840]  and he called it, he says, a tragedy, but he said, this is why we passed the bill to
[41:19.840 --> 41:22.240]  ban sanctuary cities.
[41:22.240 --> 41:26.280]  Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said sanctuary cities entice people to believe they can come
[41:26.280 --> 41:29.480]  to America and Texas and live outside of the law.
[41:29.480 --> 41:33.560]  Sanctuary cities also enable human smugglers and cartels.
[41:33.560 --> 41:38.440]  Today, these people paid a terrible price and they demonstrate why we need a secure
[41:38.440 --> 41:43.560]  border and legal immigration reform so that we can control those who enter our country.
[41:43.560 --> 41:47.000]  We continue to pray for the families and the friends of the victims and he also pointed
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.560]  out, he said, they're paying somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 to these cartels to smuggle
[41:51.560 --> 41:52.560]  them in.
[41:52.560 --> 41:55.960]  He said, wouldn't it be better if they paid a couple hundred dollars to the American government?
[41:55.960 --> 42:00.520]  We had immigration legal immigration reform and they could come in legally.
[42:00.520 --> 42:05.920]  Well we have a state representative here in Austin, Eddie Rodriguez, was furious about
[42:05.920 --> 42:06.920]  that.
[42:06.920 --> 42:11.000]  Well, Lieutenant Governor Patrick puts people first in his future public statements because
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.760]  when 10 people from any background parish, I guess it is now 10, under such horrific
[42:15.760 --> 42:22.040]  circumstances, it's an occasion deserving of solemnity and respect, not self-indulgent
[42:22.040 --> 42:23.040]  cheerleading.
[42:23.040 --> 42:30.320]  Well, the question is, do the sanctuary cities cause these deaths or do our immigration policies
[42:30.320 --> 42:31.320]  cause the deaths?
[42:31.320 --> 42:35.600]  That's a good question and we have proof that it's the sanctuary cities.
[42:35.600 --> 42:41.280]  We have reported multiple times about how illegal immigration is down 67% under Donald
[42:41.280 --> 42:42.280]  Trump.
[42:42.280 --> 42:43.280]  What changed?
[42:43.280 --> 42:44.880]  It was the policies that changed.
[42:44.880 --> 42:46.440]  They haven't built a wall.
[42:46.440 --> 42:49.880]  They haven't had time to hire more immigration officials.
[42:49.880 --> 42:54.080]  It was simply the expectation that people were not going to be allowed to come here and
[42:54.080 --> 42:59.200]  thumb their noses at the law and to get a free education, etc.
[42:59.200 --> 43:02.600]  That was what changed, the fact that they were going to be deported.
[43:02.600 --> 43:08.320]  We saw a massive increase in immigration when Obama encouraged that and we saw a massive
[43:08.320 --> 43:09.320]  decrease.
[43:09.320 --> 43:15.560]  67% Border Patrol Chief David Aguilar said, this administration has said we're going to
[43:15.560 --> 43:17.120]  address illegal immigration.
[43:17.120 --> 43:23.120]  ICE has started working in the interior unlike other times, so that message resonates.
[43:23.120 --> 43:28.040]  They understand what's going on and the Border Patrol Union chief said the significant downturn
[43:28.040 --> 43:33.600]  in the number of illegal border crossers between US and Mexico is nothing short of miraculous.
[43:33.600 --> 43:36.520]  He said that on C-SPAN weeks ago.
[43:36.520 --> 43:42.560]  He said customs and border protection reported 53% decrease in the number of apprehensions
[43:42.560 --> 43:44.800]  at the border compared to last year.
[43:44.800 --> 43:46.080]  What changed?
[43:46.080 --> 43:47.760]  Simply the policies.
[43:47.760 --> 43:52.080]  So the Lieutenant Governor is correct when you tell people, come on in.
[43:52.080 --> 43:54.040]  We're going to give you free everything.
[43:54.040 --> 43:57.820]  We're going to give you preferential treatment even over American citizens.
[43:57.820 --> 44:02.520]  When you tell people that, the border crossings are going to increase.
[44:02.520 --> 44:04.540]  And that's exactly what we see happening.
[44:04.540 --> 44:07.360]  And so the Lieutenant Governor is right.
[44:07.360 --> 44:09.920]  We can stop this if we tell people we're going to enforce the law.
[44:09.920 --> 44:13.320]  We're going to have legal immigration and we're going to control who comes in.
[44:13.320 --> 44:18.240]  And that includes the cartel members and the MS-13 gangs who are not going to be allowed
[44:18.240 --> 44:22.880]  to follow these people in and destroy their lives in America as they're doing on Long
[44:22.880 --> 44:25.600]  Island and other places.
[44:25.600 --> 44:27.600]  They started out in LA.
[44:27.600 --> 44:30.080]  And now they have spread throughout the United States.
[44:30.080 --> 44:35.080]  And it is Hispanic people who have come here illegally trying to escape that kind of environment.
[44:35.080 --> 44:39.200]  But if the borders are wide open, MS-13 and the other cartel members are going to come
[44:39.200 --> 44:41.880]  in and they're going to get entrenched in our country.
[44:41.880 --> 44:46.720]  And we're not going to allow that level of violence, which is really far worse even than
[44:46.720 --> 44:49.280]  what's going on in Afghanistan now.
[44:49.280 --> 44:53.440]  What's happening in Mexico because of the drug war, because of other issues.
[44:53.440 --> 44:56.520]  We're not going to allow that kind of violence to happen here in America.
[44:56.520 --> 44:58.040]  We're going to control the borders.
[44:58.040 --> 45:02.700]  Well, and Jeff Sessions, I think, was the right attorney general to get the momentum
[45:02.700 --> 45:09.040]  going in that direction, to get border enforcement encouraged, and to start enforcing that law.
[45:09.040 --> 45:14.040]  Now Sessions, you know, that's kind of taken care of itself and Sessions isn't really moving
[45:14.040 --> 45:15.280]  in the right direction, I think.
[45:15.280 --> 45:16.280]  So it's-
[45:16.280 --> 45:18.040]  Well, that's something that he shared with Donald Trump.
[45:18.040 --> 45:21.600]  You know, Jeff Sessions was an early supporter of Donald Trump.
[45:21.600 --> 45:23.000]  He bucked the establishment.
[45:23.000 --> 45:27.720]  He showed a lot of backbone and spine to be the only person and the earliest person in
[45:27.720 --> 45:32.600]  Washington to back Donald Trump in the very early days.
[45:32.600 --> 45:38.720]  And he did it on the issues, Owen, that you just point out, immigration and also on trade.
[45:38.720 --> 45:40.520]  And it was very valuable for him to do that.
[45:40.520 --> 45:44.720]  He would have been a very valuable person to have in the Trump administration in certain
[45:44.720 --> 45:46.220]  areas.
[45:46.220 --> 45:50.520]  But in terms of being an attorney general, as we pointed out yesterday, Donald Trump
[45:50.520 --> 45:52.120]  needs a wartime consularity.
[45:52.120 --> 45:56.680]  He needs somebody who's gonna go to war against the people who are organizing a coup against
[45:56.680 --> 45:57.680]  him.
[45:57.680 --> 45:58.680]  And this is very serious.
[45:58.680 --> 46:00.440]  These are people who are very powerful.
[46:00.440 --> 46:07.000]  This is the dark state, the intelligence community, who is trying to organize a coup against Donald
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.840]  Trump along with the Democrat Party, along with the press.
[46:09.840 --> 46:11.000]  It is a big task.
[46:11.000 --> 46:15.720]  And if Donald Trump doesn't take this on, Alex Jones said this as soon as Donald Trump
[46:15.720 --> 46:16.720]  was elected.
[46:16.720 --> 46:21.040]  He said, if you don't go after the Democrats who have created crimes, they're gonna take
[46:21.040 --> 46:22.600]  you down.
[46:22.600 --> 46:25.760]  And Jeff Sessions was not going to do that.
[46:25.760 --> 46:27.000]  And he isn't going to do that.
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.960]  And if he doesn't replace him with somebody who will, they're gonna initiate a coup in
[46:30.960 --> 46:32.800]  one way or the other against Donald Trump.
[46:32.800 --> 46:37.800]  Well, I think Ty Cobb and Anthony Scaramucci is Trump sort of toughening up his cabinet,
[46:37.800 --> 46:39.320]  toughening up it a little bit.
[46:39.320 --> 46:43.000]  And we'll see what kind of moves are made with the attorney general if Jeff Sessions
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.360]  doesn't come through in the ways he wants to.
[46:45.360 --> 46:51.960]  But now Trump needs help with the Republicans, and Paul Ryan is not helping him at all.
[46:51.960 --> 46:54.720]  But I'm not sure Paul Ryan wants to help him, I'm not sure the Republicans want to
[46:54.720 --> 46:55.720]  help him.
[46:55.720 --> 46:59.200]  And I think that that was identified when John Boehner said that Republicans will never
[46:59.200 --> 47:00.840]  repeal Obamacare.
[47:00.840 --> 47:02.840]  Here's that clip of John Boehner.
[47:02.840 --> 47:16.040]  They're never gonna repeal Obamacare.
[47:16.040 --> 47:17.040]  It's been around too long.
[47:17.040 --> 47:18.040]  They're never gonna repeal it.
[47:18.040 --> 47:19.040]  And then people have gotten exactly what they were afraid of.
[47:19.040 --> 47:20.040]  It's been around too long.
[47:20.040 --> 47:21.040]  That's what we were afraid of.
[47:21.040 --> 47:22.040]  They've got a custom to this Medicaid expansion.
[47:22.040 --> 47:23.040]  And so trying to pull it back is really not gonna work.
[47:23.040 --> 47:24.040]  But what they can do, though, is move it away from government control, but this is
[47:24.040 --> 47:34.040]  the state's have more control over what happens, and individuals have more control.
[47:34.040 --> 47:36.040]  So when it's all said and done, here's what's gonna happen.
[47:36.040 --> 47:37.040]  You're not gonna have an employer mandate anymore.
[47:37.040 --> 47:38.040]  You're not gonna have the individual mandate.
[47:38.040 --> 47:39.040]  I love how his arrogance.
[47:39.040 --> 47:40.040]  He's just telling you what's gonna happen, as if he knows.
[47:40.040 --> 47:41.040]  Status quo has changed.
[47:41.040 --> 47:42.040]  John Boehner.
[47:42.040 --> 47:59.040]  Oh, it's a tax.
[47:59.040 --> 48:09.040]  Oh, I thought it wasn't.
[48:09.040 --> 48:12.040]  So we just got done telling you you'll never repeal Obamacare.
[48:12.040 --> 48:15.040]  Now he's gonna move on to insulting President Trump.
[48:15.040 --> 48:20.040]  That's nice from the former Republican leader.
[48:20.040 --> 48:44.040]  We don't see you as Speaker of the House anymore, and there's a reason for that.
[48:44.040 --> 48:54.040]  It's just like when they laugh at him.
[48:54.040 --> 49:06.040]  No, no, no, no, no, Donald, you weren't my second or my third choice.
[49:06.040 --> 49:16.040]  No, that's the Republicans, that's the Democrat, Deep State, that's the media, that's the fake Russian probe.
[49:16.040 --> 49:42.040]  So you have to be a coward to go into politics, according to John Boehner, you have to be a coward.
[49:42.040 --> 49:50.040]  You don't go into politics unless you're a coward.
[49:50.040 --> 49:51.040]  And you don't have confidence in yourself.
[49:51.040 --> 50:00.040]  So don't go into politics, according to John Boehner, don't go into politics if you're a coward and you have no confidence.
[50:00.040 --> 50:03.040]  Yeah, let's hold this here because he said some things that we need to respond to.
[50:03.040 --> 50:06.040]  Number one, John Boehner is not Speaker of the House anymore.
[50:06.040 --> 50:07.040]  Why?
[50:07.040 --> 50:08.040]  Thinks he is.
[50:08.040 --> 50:12.040]  He had supported all of these policies that he continues to support.
[50:12.040 --> 50:20.040]  He was driven out of power by the House Freedom Caucus by conservatives who really mean what they say when they run as Republicans.
[50:20.040 --> 50:32.040]  If Donald Trump wants to get something done in Washington, he's going to have to ally himself with the House Freedom Caucus to drive out the scum at the top of the GOP party that are nothing but rhinos.
[50:32.040 --> 50:39.040]  People like Paul Rhino, who also came out defending Robert Mueller saying he's anything but partisan.
[50:39.040 --> 50:45.040]  Look, Donald Trump said it's going to be death to the Republican Party if they don't pass Obamacare.
[50:45.040 --> 50:50.040]  Boehner is exhibit A as to how they're going to die.
[50:50.040 --> 50:58.040]  We're not going to put up with these phony Republicans who tell us one thing to get elected and then glibly say it isn't going to happen once they get in.
[50:58.040 --> 51:04.040]  Mitch McConnell too, and by the way, Chuck Schumer was on the floor today literally pounding his arms against the desk for Obamacare.
[51:04.040 --> 51:06.040]  This guy's completely unhinged.
[51:06.040 --> 51:08.040]  A great president once said,
[51:08.040 --> 51:11.040]  The nine most feared words in the English language.
[51:11.040 --> 51:14.040]  I am from the government and I'm here to help.
[51:14.040 --> 51:17.040]  Adequacy of loss, absorbing capacity.
[51:17.040 --> 51:18.040]  You call that help?
[51:18.040 --> 51:20.040]  That's the mandate approved by the G20.
[51:20.040 --> 51:23.040]  The banks can steal your money.
[51:23.040 --> 51:30.040]  They can't steal your gold and silver, that you fully control, you can have it delivered into an IRA at a depository under lock and key,
[51:30.040 --> 51:34.040]  where you can hide it, where no one can find it, not even your wife.
[51:34.040 --> 51:35.040]  What?
[51:35.040 --> 51:36.040]  Sorry, honey.
[51:36.040 --> 51:40.040]  Your CDs, money market accounts, and savings accounts are all at risk.

[54:06.040 --> 54:28.040]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight with Owen Schroyer on this Tuesday, July 25, 2017.
[54:28.040 --> 54:41.040]  We're getting close to the end of July. We had a large special that we began the 4th of July because it's about our independence from the mainstream media and your independence from the mainstream media.
[54:41.040 --> 54:47.040]  We appreciate you standing with us, supporting us, and we try to support your health as well as to fund this operation.
[54:47.040 --> 54:58.040]  We created a sale on 4th of July weekend, free shipping store-wide, and we have continued that through July along with massive discounts on some of our most popular products.
[54:58.040 --> 55:08.040]  Some of them are running low on supply, but we have added other products and we have discounted them up to 66% off retail price.
[55:08.040 --> 55:20.040]  Silver Bullet, 66% off retail price along with free shipping store-wide. We also have Strawberry Caveman, a new product that is in stock and 25% off retail.
[55:20.040 --> 55:29.040]  Even though it is a new introductory product, we also have Caveman Combo. If you want to try two different flavors, we've got chocolate and strawberry at 25% off retail.
[55:29.040 --> 55:38.040]  And as we've had to pull some of our more popular products like Supermail Vitality off because we have people who are signed up for auto-ship.
[55:38.040 --> 55:45.040]  And that's something, if you haven't done that, think about that. You never run out of product. You always get it at 10% off discount, off the retail price.
[55:45.040 --> 55:52.040]  And you get free shipping if you sign up for more than $50 worth of product at a time on your order.
[55:52.040 --> 56:00.040]  So we set product aside and we have to reserve it for people who are on auto-ship. So we're getting low on Supermail Vitality.
[56:00.040 --> 56:05.040]  So that sale has ended because we're almost sold out. However, we still have plenty of Superfemale Vitality.
[56:05.040 --> 56:10.040]  And I don't know why it doesn't sell as well as Supermail. It's essentially the same thing.
[56:10.040 --> 56:15.040]  It's going to work for you if you are trying to get Supermail and you can't get it because it's sold out.
[56:15.040 --> 56:23.040]  You can still get Superfemale Vitality and we have discounted that 30% off of retail along with free shipping store-wide.
[56:23.040 --> 56:28.040]  So check out our sales at infowarstore.com. We appreciate your support.
[56:28.040 --> 56:34.040]  And these July specials are going to be ending very soon along with a month of July that will be ending very soon.
[56:34.040 --> 56:37.040]  All right, so let's take a look at what's going on.
[56:37.040 --> 56:41.040]  One of the things that I wanted to get back to, Owen, in this short amount of time that we've got here.
[56:41.040 --> 56:48.040]  It's not just the former CIA director, John Brennan, who is pushing for a coup against Trump.
[56:48.040 --> 56:52.040]  We also had somebody, and this is an interesting story that came out on Daily Mail.
[56:52.040 --> 56:55.040]  Here's the title. He's sprung a leak.
[56:55.040 --> 57:05.040]  Donald Trump appears to confirm the existence of a classified CIA operation in Syria in his late-night Twitter rant about the Amazon Washington Post.
[57:05.040 --> 57:12.040]  And this is what he had to say. He said, the Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending a massive, dangerous,
[57:12.040 --> 57:16.040]  wasteful payments to Syrian rebels who are fighting Assad.
[57:16.040 --> 57:20.040]  The CIA program, they say, was shuttered by Trump because it was designed to help rebels.
[57:20.040 --> 57:24.040]  Come on, we know who it was helping. And it isn't a secret.
[57:24.040 --> 57:28.040]  We've had John McCain, I would argue, that he's violating the Logan Act.
[57:28.040 --> 57:34.040]  He's not authorized to conduct foreign policy, but he continues to meet with al-Qaeda-affiliated rebels in Syria
[57:34.040 --> 57:37.040]  to try to create regime change. That's the CIA program.
[57:37.040 --> 57:40.040]  It is not a secret. It has been widely reported.
[57:40.040 --> 57:47.040]  We've had a lot of reports showing them dropping arms to the al-Qaeda-affiliated rebels there.
[57:47.040 --> 57:51.040]  But now we have Ned Price, a former CIA employee.
[57:51.040 --> 57:56.040]  I don't know what his rank was there, but he said, told the Daily Mail, and this is their angle that they're coming in,
[57:56.040 --> 58:04.040]  if the media reports are true, the President of the United States just confirmed a CIA covert action operation on Twitter.
[58:04.040 --> 58:06.040]  See, that's the way they're gonna spend this, Owen.
[58:06.040 --> 58:13.040]  And when we see Gutierrez saying that we're gonna impeach Trump, they could come up with something as absurd about that.
[58:13.040 --> 58:21.040]  Donald Trump saying, hey, look, we have the Washington Post fabricating a story and saying, you're exposing a CIA operation.
[58:21.040 --> 58:24.040]  Well, we know that the Washington Post is a CIA operation.
[58:24.040 --> 58:27.040]  You know, they got a massive contract with the CIA.
[58:27.040 --> 58:30.040]  So we know that that's what's happening. That's the way they're gonna spend this.
[58:30.040 --> 58:35.040]  Well, that's the interesting point to me. You've got Amazon getting lucrative deals with the government.
[58:35.040 --> 58:38.040]  You've got Amazon going to the White House meeting with Trump and Kushner.
[58:38.040 --> 58:42.040]  But you've got Trump bashing the Amazon Post on Twitter, so it's an interesting dynamic.
[58:42.040 --> 58:58.040]  Yeah, we'll be right back.
[58:58.040 --> 59:13.040]  Michael ZX is back in after five plus months sold out.
[59:13.040 --> 59:39.040]  Michael ZX is back in after five plus months sold out.
[59:39.040 --> 1:00:08.040]  Michael ZX is back in after five plus months sold out.
[1:00:08.040 --> 1:00:15.040]  You are listening to an info wars.com frontline report.
[1:00:15.040 --> 1:00:20.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:20.040 --> 1:00:24.040]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:26.040]  We need to change that liner.
[1:00:26.040 --> 1:00:31.040]  If you are listening to this transmission, you are a Russian agent.
[1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:34.040]  You work for Vladimir Putin.
[1:00:34.040 --> 1:00:39.040]  No, of course, that's total fake news. You are the ones that got Trump elected.
[1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:45.040]  The American people that have been forgotten by Hollywood, that Hollywood hates, that the Washington establishment hates.
[1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:49.040]  They don't want you to have a dream. They don't want you to be a sovereign citizen.
[1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:56.040]  They want you to go into the world government, capitulate and hand over the privilege of the great American lifestyle.
[1:00:56.040 --> 1:01:07.040]  Well, we were talking about, in the last segment, Donald Trump talking about the CIA operation going on in Syria to arm terrorists that's anti-Assad.
[1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:09.040]  And it really goes beyond that, though.
[1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:15.040]  I think that this is a CIA operation that was currently operating in Syria to arm anti-Assad rebels.
[1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:23.040]  But this was a CIA operation that was decades old, decades in the making, has been guilty of starting proxy wars in the Middle East for years.
[1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:30.040]  Trump has shut that down. Of course, the left doesn't want to point out that goodness of President Trump.
[1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:35.040]  They don't want to point out the fact that President Trump is trying to stop proxy wars in the Middle East.
[1:01:35.040 --> 1:01:39.040]  And you've got President Trump talking about this on Twitter, the left freaking out,
[1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:45.040]  even though McCain posts on social media literally him pictured with these people that were arming that are terrorists.
[1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:55.040]  But Tulsi Gabbard has come out and made a statement. She was on Fox's Tucker Carlson supporting Trump's ending of the CIA program that was arming terrorists in Syria.
[1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:57.040]  Here's that clip.
[1:01:57.040 --> 1:02:16.040]  A million people have been crying out for peace for so long, and the media completely is missing the point here about what is being reported that Trump is ending the CIA program as you described.
[1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:30.040]  The CIA was providing arms, intelligence, money and other types of support to these armed militants who were working hand in hand and who are working hand in hand and oftentimes under the command of al-Qaeda in Syria.
[1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:35.040]  So this isn't a matter of like we're giving weapons to people but they end up falling in the wrong hands.
[1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:44.040]  We are directly arming armed militants who are working under the command of al-Qaeda all in this effort to overthrow the Syrian government.
[1:02:44.040 --> 1:02:51.040]  That is grotesque. I'm honestly and sincerely confused. Why would anyone defend this?
[1:02:51.040 --> 1:03:06.040]  It is this addiction to regime change and this idea that somehow this is what must be done, again without actually looking at the fact that we have been providing direct and indirect support to al-Qaeda,
[1:03:06.040 --> 1:03:15.040]  this very same terrorist group that attacked us on 9-11 and that we are supposed to be continuing to be fighting against and trying to defeat.
[1:03:15.040 --> 1:03:29.040]  And the thing that should make everyone feel sick is that people would rather support directly and indirectly al-Qaeda than actually give up their regime change goals.
[1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:37.040]  So you are a progressive Democrat from one of the most liberal states in the world agreeing with Donald Trump on this specific piece of policy.
[1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:40.040]  What kind of reaction do you get from your fellow Democrats in the House?
[1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:49.040]  Well look for years. Even through the Obama administration I've been advocating to bring about an end to this program and I'm continuing actually through the introduction of my bill,
[1:03:49.040 --> 1:04:01.040]  the Stop Arming Terrorist Act, to make sure that our government does not use taxpayer dollars to provide this kind of support, whether it's weapons, intelligence or money or anything else.
[1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:10.040]  You got the Democrats who couldn't win an air hockey match against a ghost. Why aren't they trying to force someone like Tulsi Gabbard up as their next leader?
[1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:15.040]  Why aren't the Democrats forcing Tulsi Gabbard up as the next leader of their party?
[1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:23.040]  I don't know what else she stands for but I tell you what, it's a good example when somebody speaks the truth, regardless of what party they're in,
[1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:30.040]  regardless of any other labels or identity of that person, we need to support them when they're saying the truth.
[1:04:30.040 --> 1:04:36.040]  And this is an example, Tulsi Gabbard is very articulate, very knowledgeable about what's going on there.
[1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:44.040]  She's speaking truth to power about this. I trust people who will say the truth even if I disagree with them on issues.
[1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:48.040]  She's a, as you point out, progressive. They will probably disagree about healthcare.
[1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:52.040]  But I know that I could have a discussion with her and maybe I could persuade her.
[1:04:52.040 --> 1:04:56.040]  And that's the way that I feel about Donald Trump on issues that I disagree with him on.
[1:04:56.040 --> 1:05:00.040]  On issues I agree with him, I think it's important that we have honest people.
[1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:05.040]  No, we're going to give you Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters. That's who we're going to give you.
[1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:25.040]  Will the government...
[1:05:36.040 --> 1:05:40.040]  secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them?
[1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:44.040]  Today, everything the government does at every level is concealed from us.
[1:05:44.040 --> 1:05:49.040]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[1:05:49.040 --> 1:05:55.040]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[1:05:55.040 --> 1:06:03.040]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object. Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[1:06:03.040 --> 1:06:06.040]  BrenfordWords.com, I'm David Knight.
[1:06:33.040 --> 1:06:45.040]  I'm Dave Mann, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[1:06:45.040 --> 1:06:55.040]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalist. We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.

[1:07:14.040 --> 1:07:29.040]  The official particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.

[1:07:36.040 --> 1:07:46.040]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't.
[1:07:46.040 --> 1:08:00.040]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[1:08:11.040 --> 1:08:22.040]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show. And now your host, David Knight.
[1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:37.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. David Knight with Onshore. We're going to be joined now by Lee Stranahan. He's going to break down a story that he's been covering for months that is just now getting traction.
[1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:49.040]  Let me tell you how. Today, we had Reuters saying Trump, without evidence, cites Ukraine ties to ex-rival Clinton. Without evidence? Really? There's no evidence? Well, there is a lot of evidence.
[1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:55.040]  The mainstream media doesn't want to talk about it. Reuters doesn't want to talk about it. Lee Stranahan has been covering this story for months.
[1:08:55.040 --> 1:09:05.040]  And let's go back a couple of weeks. Back to July 13th. We had the Atlantic doing a story, the, what about Ukraine, Defense of Trump Jr.'s Russia meeting?
[1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:14.040]  And they said, before welcoming Donald Trump Jr. onto a show, on Tuesday, Sean Hannity boiled down his defense to the president's son to one word, Ukraine.
[1:09:14.040 --> 1:09:23.040]  So, after Sean Hannity got onto it, it started to get traction. We've got Donald Trump talking about it. He came on the show. He's talked about it now. They're pushing back saying there is no evidence.
[1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:40.040]  But going back to January, we had Politico break down a very long expose of this, saying the Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire, they say Kyiv officials are scrambling to make amends with the president-elect after quietly working to boost Clinton.
[1:09:40.040 --> 1:09:50.040]  This is the open secret that nobody wants to talk about, that Reuters does not want to talk about. But I wanted to get the guy on today that's been talking about it for quite some time.
[1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:58.040]  Lee Stranahan, Lee's been a contributing editor, a reporter for two of the top news sites in the world, the liberal Huffington Post and conservative Breitbart News.
[1:09:58.040 --> 1:10:04.040]  He now runs CitizenJournalismSchool.com. And thank you for joining us, Lee Stranahan.
[1:10:04.040 --> 1:10:10.040]  And David, I gotta point out, let's give you credit too. You and I have talked about this Ukraine story.
[1:10:10.040 --> 1:10:11.040]  Yes.
[1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:16.040]  Weeks before Sean Hannity brought it up. And by the way, God bless Sean Hannity for bringing it up.
[1:10:16.040 --> 1:10:19.040]  Oh yeah, yeah. I'm glad it's getting traction. It needs to, yeah.
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:20.040]  Me too.
[1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:21.040]  Me too.
[1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:29.040]  Me too. I will say this, the mistake that Hannity's making and that other people have made, Laura Ingram and the Daily Caller.
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:34.040]  This has nothing to do with the Donald Trump meeting with the Russian lawyer's story.
[1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:40.040]  You and I were talking about it here in Infowars well before that was even known.
[1:10:40.040 --> 1:10:41.040]  That's right.
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:52.040]  So I just want people to separate it out because this is not a story about like, oh well, it's okay if we did this because they did that, that kind of calling out hypocrisy thing.
[1:10:52.040 --> 1:11:09.040]  This is a story about admitted interference in the 2016 election by the Ukrainian government through a operative, a DNC operative with the unfortunate name of Aleksandr Chalupa.
[1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:14.040]  Now, I say unfortunate because of Taco Bell obviously.
[1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:16.040]  I like Chalupas.
[1:11:16.040 --> 1:11:18.040]  But here's the thing.
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:20.040]  She made a run for the border, yeah.
[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:25.040]  Because in a story that you point out correctly, the mainstream media has been ignoring.
[1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:28.040]  It's nice to have a name that's easy to remember, right?
[1:11:28.040 --> 1:11:38.040]  Every, you know, Will Hillary Clinton drop the Chalupa, for instance, is a headline I predict coming and it helps because here's another name that's less easy to remember.
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:39.040]  Leschenko.
[1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:40.040]  Okay.
[1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:43.040]  Sergei Leschenko.
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:46.040]  Sergei Leschenko is really important here.
[1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:52.040]  Sergei Leschenko is a former journalist in the Ukraine who's now a member of parliament.
[1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:53.040]  Okay.
[1:11:53.040 --> 1:11:58.040]  By the way, if you look up Leschenko on Twitter, he's very well known in the Ukraine.
[1:11:58.040 --> 1:12:04.040]  He's got about 350,000 followers on Twitter, which is that's significant, right?
[1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:06.040]  And so he's very well known there.
[1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:12.040]  Leschenko has admitted that Ukraine was interfering in the election.
[1:12:12.040 --> 1:12:15.040]  And by the way, he's one of the people who was involved.
[1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:18.040]  He said we were so concerned about areas.
[1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:20.040]  He's a very attractive young man.
[1:12:20.040 --> 1:12:22.040]  He's tall as well.
[1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:29.040]  But Sergei Leschenko is key to understanding this as is Alexander Chalupa.
[1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:36.040]  Now, there's two things that happened on this in the past 24 hours, David, that are significant.
[1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:45.040]  One, this morning, Donald Trump tweeted about it and he said that Jeff Session should be investigating what's going on.
[1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:53.040]  Now, I've been urging people to call the White House and call their congressmen and urge an investigation for weeks now.
[1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:55.040]  So this is significant.
[1:12:55.040 --> 1:13:04.040]  But the other thing that happened is last night, Chuck Grassley brought up something about Alexander Chalupa.
[1:13:04.040 --> 1:13:07.040]  And he quotes Leschenko in that.
[1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:15.040]  And I would advise there's a great writer over at Daily Caller, Chuck Ross.
[1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:18.040]  Chuck's a great investigative journalist.
[1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:21.040]  He's one of those guys, David, and you know how this goes.
[1:13:21.040 --> 1:13:27.040]  Sometimes you read stories and you just notice the same journalist is on them and you go, well, that's right.
[1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:30.040]  Yeah, that dude or do that is pretty good, right?
[1:13:30.040 --> 1:13:31.040]  That's Eric Carter.
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:33.040]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:38.040]  And so he is a piece about it last night in the Daily Caller, but this is significant.
[1:13:38.040 --> 1:13:44.040]  I urge everybody to read what Chuck Grassley posted that's linked in that story.
[1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:51.040]  And of course, Chuck Grassley has also been pointing out the connections with Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS and all these other,
[1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:59.040]  and the connections to the FBI asking questions of Director Comey when he was still director that were completely ignored.
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:04.040]  Why are you working with these people to try to come after Donald Trump when they're putting out false information?
[1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:05.040]  Yes.
[1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:11.040]  Well, let's take this to a 50,000 foot level for a second because I really want people to understand why this story is so significant.
[1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:18.040]  In fact, I'm going to argue, David, that this is the most important story in the world right now is the most important,
[1:14:18.040 --> 1:14:25.040]  buried story in the world is the story of the DNC's collusion with the government of Ukraine.
[1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:31.040]  And the reason I say that, David, is that if you looked at the media in the past six months,
[1:14:31.040 --> 1:14:34.040]  you'd think the biggest story was Trump-Russia, right?
[1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:40.040]  If you consumed establishment media, you'd believe that's the biggest story, right?
[1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:47.040]  But as you point out on Infowars all the time, there's so much of that story doesn't make sense, it's fake.
[1:14:47.040 --> 1:14:57.040]  So the reason I say the Ukraine story is significant is Alexander Chalupa is the person who started the Trump-Russia narrative.
[1:14:57.040 --> 1:14:59.040]  She has a significant force behind it.
[1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:04.040]  In fact, the investigative reporter Michael Isikov from now at Yahoo!
[1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:06.040]  But he's covered a lot of major stories.
[1:15:06.040 --> 1:15:13.040]  He called, if you just Google Yahoo! 2016 election Alexander Chalupa,
[1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:19.040]  you'll find an article he wrote calling Alexander Chalupa, who we're going to make a household name.
[1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:22.040]  Alexander Chalupa, you're unnoticed, you're going to be a household name.
[1:15:22.040 --> 1:15:28.040]  He called her one of the most significant people in the 2016 election back in October.
[1:15:28.040 --> 1:15:30.040]  That's what he said.
[1:15:30.040 --> 1:15:33.040]  She was working closely with Isikov.
[1:15:33.040 --> 1:15:42.040]  Her sister, Andrea Chalupa, said in two separate tweets that Alexander Chalupa was behind the Trump-Russia narrative.
[1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:46.040]  She was the main researcher for the DNC.
[1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:47.040]  Very important.
[1:15:47.040 --> 1:15:51.040]  You've got to remember Alexander Chalupa, she worked in the Clinton White House.
[1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:53.040]  She goes back to the Bill Clinton era.
[1:15:53.040 --> 1:15:58.040]  She's been a DNC operative since 2004.
[1:15:58.040 --> 1:16:01.040]  She was working directly for the DNC.
[1:16:01.040 --> 1:16:05.040]  And as we're going to point out, the DNC was using Chalupa.
[1:16:05.040 --> 1:16:07.040]  This is what they're doing.
[1:16:07.040 --> 1:16:13.040]  So let me, Reuters, when they say, for instance, there's no connection to Clinton,
[1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:16.040]  that's because Chalupa is a cutout.
[1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:22.040]  In other words, I believe it's very clear, and I've had a source directly tell me who's been involved in this,
[1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:24.040]  that they believe this as well.
[1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:29.040]  The DNC wants to keep one level of separation from Chalupa.
[1:16:29.040 --> 1:16:35.040]  And Chalupa was funding operations through a guy named Brett Kimberlin.
[1:16:35.040 --> 1:16:40.040]  Brett Kimberlin's a convicted serial bomber who I've written about for years as well.
[1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:42.040]  And again, no conjecture on this.
[1:16:42.040 --> 1:16:44.040]  She's worked directly with this guy.
[1:16:44.040 --> 1:16:48.040]  So what the DNC is doing, David, this is Watergate stuff.
[1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:49.040]  Yes.
[1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:51.040]  The cover-up is worse than the crime.
[1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:55.040]  And that's what I've said from the very beginning is when we look at what they did,
[1:16:55.040 --> 1:17:00.040]  going back to their manipulation against Bernie Sanders,
[1:17:00.040 --> 1:17:08.040]  what they do is they project their crimes onto Russia or onto Trump to cover up what they're actually doing.
[1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:09.040]  And that's what we're seeing right here.
[1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:10.040]  There's not any collusion.
[1:17:10.040 --> 1:17:14.040]  There's nothing there, in spite of all these special prosecutors, this long-time investigation,
[1:17:14.040 --> 1:17:17.040]  nothing showing collusion between Trump and Russia.
[1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:20.040]  But there's a lot of collusion that's going on between the DNC.
[1:17:20.040 --> 1:17:25.040]  And we all know how intricately connected the DNC was to Hillary Clinton.
[1:17:25.040 --> 1:17:30.040]  If it was investigated, I'm sure we would find those ties to come up, but they don't want to investigate
[1:17:30.040 --> 1:17:35.040]  the real collusion that was going on with the foreign government to manipulate our election.
[1:17:35.040 --> 1:17:37.040]  Well, first off, there is paper.
[1:17:37.040 --> 1:17:42.040]  I'm going to be reporting today on my website populist.tv.
[1:17:42.040 --> 1:17:47.040]  For the first time, this is an exclusive, and I'm really breaking some of it here,
[1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:55.040]  that Alexander Chalupa, after the election, worked with convicted bomber Brett Kimberlin, who financed it,
[1:17:55.040 --> 1:17:58.040]  to bring a foreign national into the country.
[1:17:58.040 --> 1:18:03.040]  This was right after the election, where that foreign national met with members on Capitol Hill,
[1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:05.040]  and that's 100% confirmed.
[1:18:05.040 --> 1:18:08.040]  Chuck Ross confirmed to me he spoke to people on the Hill.
[1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:14.040]  I'd heard it from another source, with the intent of keeping Donald Trump from taking office.
[1:18:14.040 --> 1:18:18.040]  Now, David, you know how I roll. I don't like to do the conjecture thing.
[1:18:18.040 --> 1:18:21.040]  That's right. You're very conservative about that, yes.
[1:18:21.040 --> 1:18:25.040]  I am. That's one area where I'm very conservative.
[1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:29.040]  Marijuana legalizations, an area where I'm not so conservative, but let's leave that aside.
[1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:33.040]  You're conservative about the information that you present to people, and your sources.
[1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:34.040]  That's right, yeah, that's right.
[1:18:34.040 --> 1:18:40.040]  So, I'm just saying, I consider myself conservatively, you know, a small government populist, right?
[1:18:40.040 --> 1:18:44.040]  No, so this is absolutely confirmed.
[1:18:44.040 --> 1:18:49.040]  They brought a foreign national over to meet with Democrats on the Hill,
[1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:56.040]  and they met with several of them and their staffers to try to keep Donald Trump from taking office.
[1:18:56.040 --> 1:19:04.040]  They hatched a plan that, and this is all gonna come out, that would have had Barack Obama's, this sounds-
[1:19:04.040 --> 1:19:07.040]  That's bombshell news. This is really bombshell news.
[1:19:07.040 --> 1:19:10.040]  I'm anxious to see this report, yes. Go ahead, break it down.
[1:19:10.040 --> 1:19:17.040]  So, yeah, so I mean, this is gonna sound so crazy that the mainstream media would accuse it of being a conspiracy theory on info wars,
[1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:22.040]  but it's 100% proven, and you'll see that this plays out, David.
[1:19:22.040 --> 1:19:27.040]  They hatched a plan where Obama would step down early.
[1:19:27.040 --> 1:19:31.040]  Biden would cancel the electoral college.
[1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:35.040]  Now, you remember this time in November, and if anyone doesn't believe me,
[1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:41.040]  go look at Andrea Chalupa, Alexandra Chalupa's sister's Twitter feed from November 2016.
[1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:45.040]  She's all about stopping the electoral college vote.
[1:19:45.040 --> 1:19:46.040]  Oh, yeah?
[1:19:46.040 --> 1:19:50.040]  They were gonna have Obama step down early, this was the plan hatched by this foreign national.
[1:19:50.040 --> 1:19:54.040]  Hang on, this is a dynamite bombshell information.
[1:19:54.040 --> 1:19:55.040]  We're gonna be right back.
[1:19:55.040 --> 1:19:59.040]  Lee Stranahan, and you can find him at thepopulist.tv.
[1:19:59.040 --> 1:20:06.040]  We'll be right back.
[1:20:29.040 --> 1:20:37.040]  It's time to get greedy.
[1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:39.040]  A real zinc shortage is upon us.
[1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:42.040]  The Wall Street Journal says zinc supplies are down to three weeks.
[1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:47.040]  Mine supplies struggling to meet demand, and no major discoveries in the last 22 years.
[1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:48.040]  What's it mean for you?
[1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:54.040]  Keith Neumeyer, who's made hundreds of millions investing in hard asset mining clays, is making his biggest call yet.

[1:21:04.040 --> 1:21:10.040]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at mforwardstore.com.
[1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:13.040]  The first shipment of super blue sold out in one week.
[1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:15.040]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:20.040]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their super blue.
[1:21:20.040 --> 1:21:22.040]  Research across the board is clear.
[1:21:22.040 --> 1:21:23.040]  In fact, it's certified.
[1:21:23.040 --> 1:21:28.040]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream, and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[1:21:28.040 --> 1:21:35.040]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:38.040]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:42.040]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:21:42.040 --> 1:21:49.040]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:52.040]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include
[1:21:52.040 --> 1:21:56.040]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodide, nanosilver and more.

[1:22:04.040 --> 1:22:06.040]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:12.040]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[1:22:12.040 --> 1:22:13.040]  But the symptoms are there.
[1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:18.040]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[1:22:18.040 --> 1:22:22.040]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[1:24:00.040 --> 1:24:03.040]  That's 877-965-2140.
[1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:36.040]  He's worked as I pointed out before, both for the liberal Huffington Post and the conservative Breitbart News.
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:38.040]  And when I said before that he's conservative, yes, he is.
[1:24:38.040 --> 1:24:44.040]  He believes in limited government, but I was talking about the fact that Lee is very careful about connecting the dots.
[1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:50.040]  He's got CitizenJournalismSchool.com where he trains people about the principles of good journalism.
[1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:54.040]  So he's not going to go over the edge with this.
[1:24:54.040 --> 1:25:06.040]  And yet, as we're going to break, Lee Strandhand gave us bombshell information about a serial bomber who came to the United States and with others within the DNC and with the Ukraine.
[1:25:06.040 --> 1:25:11.040]  He was talking about subverting the election and subverting the electoral college.
[1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:16.040]  I'm going to get back to Lee and give him the floor so he can break this down for us right now.
[1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:17.040]  Lee, go ahead.
[1:25:17.040 --> 1:25:18.040]  Continue.
[1:25:18.040 --> 1:25:19.040]  Sure.
[1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:21.040]  So let's just go over the cast of characters again here because it's significant.
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:24.040]  There's a DNC operative named Alexandra Chalupa.
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:27.040]  She was involved with the Ukraine, right?
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:31.040]  And by the way, you can look this up in a WikiLeaks email, Ali Chalupa.
[1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:33.040]  She sent an email to the DNC.
[1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:35.040]  It's completely proven.
[1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:38.040]  Ali Chalupa worked in the Clinton administration.
[1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:40.040]  The second person you need to know about is Brett Kimberlin.
[1:25:40.040 --> 1:25:43.040]  Brett Kimberlin is a convicted serial bomber.
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:48.040]  In the 80s, he set off a series of bombs around Indianapolis, Indiana.
[1:25:48.040 --> 1:25:51.040]  He spent 17 years in prison.
[1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:59.040]  You may remember there was a story many years ago where Dan Quayle was accused of, someone said,
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:01.040]  I was Dan Quayle's pot dealer.
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:03.040]  That was Brett Kimberlin.
[1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:04.040]  He lied.
[1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:06.040]  He lied.
[1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:13.040]  This is a guy who was convicted of perjury by the time he was like 19 years old, right?
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:16.040]  But he gets out of prison, he becomes a liberal activist.
[1:26:16.040 --> 1:26:19.040]  That's what Brett Kimberlin does, okay?
[1:26:19.040 --> 1:26:23.040]  Now, he was the money guy here.
[1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:31.040]  In other words, this foreign national was contacted after the election by someone with the Democrat Party.
[1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:36.040]  Then they were put in touch with Alexander Chalupa.
[1:26:36.040 --> 1:26:39.040]  Then they said, we want to bring you over to Washington.
[1:26:39.040 --> 1:26:43.040]  The money came from Brett Kimberlin.
[1:26:43.040 --> 1:26:48.040]  We were just showing, for the people who are listening on radio, we're just showing a clip here,
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:53.040]  laying out the crimes of Brett Kimberlin and the bombings that he was convicted of.
[1:26:53.040 --> 1:26:54.040]  Go ahead, Lee.
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:56.040]  This is a video I did a few years ago to explain.
[1:26:56.040 --> 1:26:59.040]  Again, it's a complex story, but it's stunning.
[1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:04.040]  Now, Brett Kimberlin appears to be the bag man for this operation.
[1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:07.040]  In other words, the DNC is not going to write a check.
[1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:08.040]  Does that make sense?
[1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:09.040]  Right.
[1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:19.040]  They kept one level of separation by using Alexander Chalupa, who by this time was no longer officially working for the DNC.
[1:27:19.040 --> 1:27:27.040]  She introduced this foreign national to Brett Kimberlin, and Brett Kimberlin paid for the trip over.
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:30.040]  Where did Brett Kimberlin get the money?
[1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:34.040]  Well, that's what an investigation is going to need to find out, right?
[1:27:34.040 --> 1:27:37.040]  They're not going to say, but this is significant.
[1:27:37.040 --> 1:27:40.040]  Now, they brought the foreign national over.
[1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:42.040]  Well, how does this tie into the Democrats?
[1:27:42.040 --> 1:27:44.040]  Maybe Kimberlin was acting on his own.
[1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:46.040]  Maybe Chalupa was acting on her own.
[1:27:46.040 --> 1:27:52.040]  No, because this foreign national was brought over to talk to people on Capitol Hill, and he did.
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:54.040]  Now, here's the thing, David.
[1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:58.040]  Could you, I'm just asking, you're a well-connected journalist.
[1:27:58.040 --> 1:28:03.040]  If you wanted to get someone from a foreign country to come over to talk to people on Capitol Hill, could you set up meetings?
[1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:04.040]  Because I couldn't.
[1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:05.040]  That's right.
[1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:06.040]  That's what I'm saying.
[1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:07.040]  Absolutely.
[1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:14.040]  That's very suspicious, the fact that this guy who's got a long criminal record would pay to bring over a foreign national,
[1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:19.040]  who then he shops around to the highest levels of people on Capitol Hill in Washington.
[1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:27.040]  Now, then months later, this foreign national was involved again with Alexandre Chalupa and Brett Kimberlin
[1:28:27.040 --> 1:28:32.040]  in a scheme to take down Donald Trump with documents that turned out to be false.
[1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:38.040]  And at that point, this has been reported by BuzzFeed, no right-wing source.
[1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:44.040]  BuzzFeed reported on this, and then it was followed up on by the great Chuck Ross at Daily Caller.
[1:28:44.040 --> 1:28:51.040]  Brett Kimberlin, again, paid three times for this foreign national, Jonathan Schwartz,
[1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:55.040]  who used to be with the ANC, by the way, in South Africa.
[1:28:55.040 --> 1:28:57.040]  So, back to that end.
[1:28:57.040 --> 1:28:59.040]  Yeah, heavily commissed, yeah.
[1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:00.040]  Right.
[1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:01.040]  No, he was.
[1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:02.040]  A militant wing of the ANC.
[1:29:02.040 --> 1:29:03.040]  Yes.
[1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:08.040]  Brett Kimberlin paid three times for him to fly from Israel to Rome to look at these documents.
[1:29:08.040 --> 1:29:16.040]  They got these documents, they paid $9,000 to get these documents, and the documents turned out to be false.
[1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:23.040]  BuzzFeed did a story about this, but they didn't mention Alexander Chalupa's name.
[1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:25.040]  Chuck Ross is the one who followed up on that.
[1:29:25.040 --> 1:29:33.040]  So, what I'm saying is, now, when you tie this in, and let me tell you, two people...
[1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:36.040]  Okay, we got 10 seconds, and then we're gonna have to take a break.
[1:29:36.040 --> 1:29:39.040]  Tie it in real quickly for us in 10 seconds, and we'll have you back right after the break.
[1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:44.040]  George Soros, who you've heard of, and also just Ukrainians in general.
[1:29:44.040 --> 1:29:47.040]  But Soros comes up all over the place.
[1:29:47.040 --> 1:29:48.040]  He's a major funder.
[1:29:48.040 --> 1:29:50.040]  He's connected to all of these groups.
[1:29:50.040 --> 1:29:52.040]  The Moriarty of Crime, George Soros.
[1:29:52.040 --> 1:29:55.040]  And we're gonna be right back with Lee Stranahan in this bombshell investigation.
[1:29:55.040 --> 1:29:56.040]  We're on the march.
[1:29:56.040 --> 1:29:58.040]  The Empires on the Run.
[1:29:58.040 --> 1:30:24.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:28.040 --> 1:30:35.040]  It is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government.
[1:30:35.040 --> 1:30:37.040]  Independence isn't a day.
[1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:41.040]  It's a mindset, an attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[1:30:41.040 --> 1:30:43.040]  I will not be your slave.
[1:30:43.040 --> 1:30:49.040]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[1:30:49.040 --> 1:30:54.040]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[1:30:54.040 --> 1:30:56.040]  Slaves are never safe.
[1:30:56.040 --> 1:30:59.040]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[1:30:59.040 --> 1:31:03.040]  Guard your liberty, regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[1:31:03.040 --> 1:31:32.040]  River Wars.com, I'm David Dine.
[1:31:34.040 --> 1:31:37.040]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.
[1:31:37.040 --> 1:31:41.040]  The organic oils help hydrate the skin, leaving it nice and smooth.
[1:31:41.040 --> 1:31:46.040]  The truly natural fragrance-free sunscreen for the most sensitive skin.
[1:31:46.040 --> 1:31:52.040]  Emrex Essentials wants you to enjoy the sun and strives to bring you organic products to enhance your life.

[1:32:30.040 --> 1:32:32.040]  There are silent weapons for quiet war.
[1:32:32.040 --> 1:32:38.040]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[1:32:38.040 --> 1:32:42.040]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[1:32:42.040 --> 1:32:45.040]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[1:32:45.040 --> 1:32:57.040]  Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[1:32:57.040 --> 1:33:00.040]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[1:33:00.040 --> 1:33:06.040]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[1:33:13.040 --> 1:33:17.040]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[1:33:17.040 --> 1:33:22.040]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[1:33:22.040 --> 1:33:26.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:26.040 --> 1:33:29.040]  I'm David Knight here with Owen Shroy and we're talking to Lee Stranahan.
[1:33:29.040 --> 1:33:31.040]  Amazing bombshell information.
[1:33:31.040 --> 1:33:33.040]  We had to take a break.
[1:33:33.040 --> 1:33:37.040]  We're going to continue back with this story, this research that Lee Stranahan has put together,
[1:33:37.040 --> 1:33:45.040]  the thread of what is really state collusion and a foreign state trying to alter our election.
[1:33:45.040 --> 1:33:47.040]  And that's the Ukraine.
[1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:49.040]  And this is something that hasn't been talked about.
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:51.040]  It's been hidden by the mainstream media.
[1:33:51.040 --> 1:33:56.040]  And even as we have Donald Trump put out about it today, we have Reuters say there's absolutely no proof.
[1:33:56.040 --> 1:34:04.040]  Well, if you're listening, you heard some very hardcore links and we're going to break down some more of those with Lee Stranahan here in just a moment.
[1:34:04.040 --> 1:34:12.040]  Before we get back to the news and to Lee, I just want to remind you that our July specials that began with the 4th of July are independent specials.
[1:34:12.040 --> 1:34:17.040]  They began with free shipping store-wide, massive discounts on our most popular products.
[1:34:17.040 --> 1:34:18.040]  That's going to be ending soon.
[1:34:18.040 --> 1:34:23.040]  We're here July 25th, and so this is going to be ending the end of July.
[1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:26.040]  And we've already had some items like super mail vitality.
[1:34:26.040 --> 1:34:30.040]  We had to end that discount because it's almost sold out.
[1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:37.040]  We have to reserve a few for people who are on auto ship who get that 10% discount for setting up their auto ship.
[1:34:37.040 --> 1:34:42.040]  However, we still have plenty of super female vitality left and it's discounted 30%.
[1:34:42.040 --> 1:34:44.040]  And that's in addition to free shipping.
[1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:49.040]  And you need to understand that mail vitality, super mail vitality is basically the same formula.
[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:50.040]  It's just a little bit different.
[1:34:50.040 --> 1:34:53.040]  There's nothing there that's going to harm you.
[1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:57.040]  There's nothing that's hormonal that's going to harm you.
[1:34:57.040 --> 1:34:58.040]  It's basically the same formula.
[1:34:58.040 --> 1:35:04.040]  So if you want to get that and you want to get a 30% discount, super female vitality is still available.
[1:35:04.040 --> 1:35:06.040]  And of course, free shipping store-wide.
[1:35:06.040 --> 1:35:10.040]  Let me tell you some of the other things that we have at the store that are, well, we have free shipping store-wide.
[1:35:10.040 --> 1:35:11.040]  We have a couple of new products.
[1:35:11.040 --> 1:35:15.040]  We have true whey protein 25% off out of the gate.
[1:35:15.040 --> 1:35:17.040]  That's at infowarslife.com.
[1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:22.040]  The ultimate protein pack 25% off caveman and true whey protein.
[1:35:22.040 --> 1:35:23.040]  Another special that we have there.
[1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:26.040]  We also have another flavor of caveman.
[1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:29.040]  Our special bone formulation there to support you.
[1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:30.040]  That's strawberry caveman.
[1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:32.040]  That's 25% off.
[1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:35.040]  But we have discounts up to 66% off.
[1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:40.040]  Silver bullet is discounted 66% off retail price.
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:42.040]  Take a look at the specials that we have there.
[1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:47.040]  We got everything from water filters to air filters to vitamin mineral fusion drink 33% off.
[1:35:47.040 --> 1:35:50.040]  Two, as I pointed out, super female vitality 30% off.
[1:35:50.040 --> 1:35:52.040]  We have DNA force 20% off.
[1:35:52.040 --> 1:35:54.040]  That's a big discount.
[1:35:54.040 --> 1:36:02.040]  A big savings dollar wise folks, because that is a very expensive product to produce a very effective product.
[1:36:02.040 --> 1:36:05.040]  If you talk to the people, take a look at the reviews that are there.
[1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:06.040]  A very unique product.
[1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:09.040]  That's 20% off of DNA force.
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:10.040]  A lot of specials.
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:11.040]  Look at the website.
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:14.040]  And again, that's going to be ending soon, the month of July free shipping.
[1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:17.040]  That'll be ending the end of July.
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:18.040]  So thank you for your support.
[1:36:18.040 --> 1:36:20.040]  Let's get back to Lee.
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:28.040]  He's breaking down this amazing bombshell story about a guy who has a long criminal record, Brett Kimberlin.
[1:36:28.040 --> 1:36:30.040]  He's served time in prison for bombings.
[1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:33.040]  He's been involved as a political operative.
[1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:40.040]  And he just happened to give money to a foreign national, bring them to the United States,
[1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:43.040]  shop them around the highest levels of Washington DC.
[1:36:43.040 --> 1:36:46.040]  And as Lee was pointing out, this is all involved.
[1:36:46.040 --> 1:36:48.040]  And he's going to break it down his website as well.
[1:36:48.040 --> 1:36:51.040]  And of course, you can find him at citizenjournalismschool.com.
[1:36:51.040 --> 1:36:56.040]  And also the website, I guess the article Lee will be at thepopulus.us.
[1:36:56.040 --> 1:36:59.040]  So that'd be where the article is, or thepopulus.tv.
[1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:01.040]  Populus.tv is the URL I'm using now.
[1:37:01.040 --> 1:37:04.040]  It's just shorter. It all goes to the same place.
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:09.040]  But I mentioned right before the break, Soros, let's give some names people know.
[1:37:09.040 --> 1:37:12.040]  Because I want people to understand why this is happening, okay?
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:13.040]  Yes.
[1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:18.040]  So I'm going to name two countries, Syria and Ukraine, that the US has been involved in.
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:24.040]  Now, the media has hidden what's happened in Syria and the Ukraine.
[1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:30.040]  In Syria, regular viewers of info wars know that we were basically backing the wrong side.
[1:37:30.040 --> 1:37:37.040]  We were funding the rebels who were the Islamist, who've been killing Christians and other Muslims, by the way.
[1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:38.040]  That's right.
[1:37:38.040 --> 1:37:39.040]  In Syria, right?
[1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:41.040]  Al Qaeda's Air Force, yep, Al Qaeda's Air Force.
[1:37:41.040 --> 1:37:48.040]  Now, in Ukraine, we backed the overthrow of Yanukovych, okay?
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:54.040]  And by the way, we then installed, people can go to, you remember Victoria Newland,
[1:37:54.040 --> 1:38:00.040]  the State Department official, who was caught on a phone call picking the new government of Ukraine.
[1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:01.040]  That's right.
[1:38:01.040 --> 1:38:02.040]  Hand picking it.
[1:38:02.040 --> 1:38:03.040]  That's right.
[1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:04.040]  You can find that on YouTube.
[1:38:04.040 --> 1:38:06.040]  Just look for Victoria Newland Ukraine phone call.
[1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:07.040]  That's right.
[1:38:07.040 --> 1:38:08.040]  It was leaked out.
[1:38:08.040 --> 1:38:09.040]  You can listen to it or you can watch it.
[1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:10.040]  You can read the transcript.
[1:38:10.040 --> 1:38:11.040]  It's absolutely amazing.
[1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:16.040]  Now, the reason I mentioned this is let's talk about who was on the side.
[1:38:16.040 --> 1:38:19.040]  No, no, the other side is Russia.
[1:38:19.040 --> 1:38:27.040]  In other words, if you demonize Russia, you can bury the truth about Syria and the truth about Ukraine.
[1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:28.040]  Does that make sense?
[1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:29.040]  Yep.
[1:38:29.040 --> 1:38:33.040]  Now, who was behind the burying of that?
[1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:42.040]  Hillary Clinton, who's the Secretary of State under Barack Obama, who pushed for the overthrow of the Syrian government
[1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:48.040]  and who was behind, it didn't happen on her watch, but she was deeply involved in the Ukraine.
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:50.040]  Hillary Clinton.
[1:38:50.040 --> 1:38:51.040]  Yes.
[1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:58.040]  John McCain, who spoke in the Ukraine and has been one of the most vocal advocates for the rebels.
[1:38:58.040 --> 1:39:02.040]  We know that the CIA was involved in the Ukraine and Syria.
[1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:04.040]  We know that they were training people, right?
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:05.040]  Yeah.
[1:39:05.040 --> 1:39:06.040]  I'm just keeping this simple.
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:09.040]  And we know that George Soros was also heavily involved.
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:16.040]  First off, he's one of Hillary Clinton's top donors, but he also spent $100 million in the Ukraine
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:19.040]  and helped push for things like the Arab Spring.
[1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:20.040]  You with me so far?
[1:39:20.040 --> 1:39:21.040]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:30.040]  And we just had Donald Trump shut down the CIA's weapons program to the so-called moderate rebels that we know are really al-Qaeda or ISIS.
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:36.040]  And that's why the CIA, I think, is stepping up their rhetoric saying, hey, we need to basically take down Donald Trump.
[1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:41.040]  I mean, openly calling for a coup now in terms of what they're saying to CNN's Wolf Blisser.
[1:39:41.040 --> 1:39:42.040]  Go ahead.
[1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:48.040]  Now, what we also know is that the media did not inform the public about what was actually happening in Syria.
[1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:52.040]  I went to Lebanon myself in 2013 and got the truth.
[1:39:52.040 --> 1:39:54.040]  Ukraine, they didn't tell people.
[1:39:54.040 --> 1:39:58.040]  It's like, oh, Russia's the next, this place and it's horrible, right?
[1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:03.040]  Now, I want you to notice who's behind the Trump-Russian narrative.
[1:40:03.040 --> 1:40:11.040]  Hillary Clinton, John McCain, the CIA, how many CIA leaks have we seen to the Washington Post?
[1:40:11.040 --> 1:40:15.040]  The Washington Post has owned by Jeff Bezos from Amazon.
[1:40:15.040 --> 1:40:19.040]  Amazon's got a $600 million contract with the CIA.
[1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:21.040]  Anybody can look that up, right?
[1:40:21.040 --> 1:40:22.040]  That's right.
[1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:28.040]  John McCain, Hillary Clinton, the CIA, and the media, and it's all funded by George Soros.
[1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:36.040]  Isn't it interesting that the $600 million contract, let's focus on that $600 million contract there with Jeff Bezos and Amazon.
[1:40:36.040 --> 1:40:44.040]  They're providing data services for the CIA, and then his newspaper just happens to get this anonymous information and leaks and so forth,
[1:40:44.040 --> 1:40:46.040]  and then run that through.
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:53.040]  And we heard earlier John Boehner saying, hey, you don't pick a fight with people like the Washington Post, people who buy ink by the barrel.
[1:40:53.040 --> 1:41:00.040]  Well, what he is buying is what Bezos bought was leverage in Washington.
[1:41:00.040 --> 1:41:08.040]  And he is using that political leverage, his little, you know, he paid $250 million, which is chump change for Jeff Bezos.
[1:41:08.040 --> 1:41:14.040]  As I pointed out, it'd be equivalent to somebody who's making $50,000 or so in the U.S., which is about the median family income.
[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:20.040]  It'd be equivalent to you spending $300 to buy the Amazon, the Amazon Post, the Washington Post,
[1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:27.040]  so that you could push your narrative in Washington so you could lobby people and say, hey, I better get what I want for my businesses,
[1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:34.040]  or Amazon for my space businesses, or maybe there's going to be some unfriendly stories that come out of the Washington Post.
[1:41:34.040 --> 1:41:37.040]  So that's the kind of leverage that he's got with that.
[1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:43.040]  I think it's very important that we see that connection, what he's doing there, and the fact that Donald Trump is also calling him out on that.
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:44.040]  Go ahead, Lee.
[1:41:44.040 --> 1:41:51.040]  Well, because this Trump-Russia narrative has been pushed from the start, the first story to come out about it is Ellen Nakashima in the
[1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:57.040]  post on June 14th of last year did the first story accusing Russia.
[1:41:57.040 --> 1:42:00.040]  Now, by the way, the other group that fits in here is CrowdStrike.
[1:42:00.040 --> 1:42:04.040]  CrowdStrike are the only people to examine the DNC servers.
[1:42:04.040 --> 1:42:07.040]  Comey never subpoenaed them and never pushed for it.
[1:42:07.040 --> 1:42:12.040]  And CrowdStrike, by the way, co-founded by a former FBI person.
[1:42:12.040 --> 1:42:20.040]  And CrowdStrike also had a false report about Ukraine that tried to tie this in.
[1:42:20.040 --> 1:42:27.040]  By the way, one other thing to note about CrowdStrike, they just went through a round of funding, and that funding was by Google.
[1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:32.040]  So what we've seen is these new economy tech giants.
[1:42:32.040 --> 1:42:36.040]  Google Eric Schmidt is one of Hillary Clinton's biggest supporters.
[1:42:36.040 --> 1:42:38.040]  Bezos owns the Washington Post.
[1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:44.040]  So we're seeing how the world of new media, what I will call non-independent new media,
[1:42:44.040 --> 1:42:56.040]  clearly partisan pro-Clinton new media, right, has worked with the old media to hide the truth about Syria, about Ukraine,
[1:42:56.040 --> 1:42:59.040]  and the way they had to do that, David, think about it.
[1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:02.040]  It's Hillary, it's McCain, it's CIA.
[1:43:02.040 --> 1:43:06.040]  They had to make Russia the enemy.
[1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:10.040]  Yes, and you've been on CrowdStrike for the longest time along with Ukraine.
[1:43:10.040 --> 1:43:13.040]  We've talked about it at length.
[1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:19.040]  I think it's interesting that a couple of weeks ago, you and I have not talked since it happened, but we had a retraction from the New York Times.
[1:43:19.040 --> 1:43:25.040]  I mentioned earlier in the show, New York Times and Reuters retracted and said, well, yeah, it wasn't all 17 agencies.
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:27.040]  It was actually a DNI clapper.
[1:43:27.040 --> 1:43:34.040]  He met with some hand-picked representatives, it was a sick offense, if you will, of the NSA, the CIA, and the FBI.
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:39.040]  The FBI, who had not seen the service, as you pointed out, because CrowdStrike wouldn't turn them over.
[1:43:39.040 --> 1:43:41.040]  So where's all this information coming from?
[1:43:41.040 --> 1:43:44.040]  It's coming from this DNC contractor. He presents it to them.
[1:43:44.040 --> 1:43:50.040]  And then he says in testimony in May, he says, well, nobody objected when I told them what CrowdStrike told me.
[1:43:50.040 --> 1:43:55.040]  So therefore, I speak for all 17 agencies, and that's where this nonsense came from.
[1:43:55.040 --> 1:44:06.040]  But it was a narrative that began with Hillary Clinton back in October in the debate, saying all 17 agencies agree that the Russians have tried to corrupt and hacked our election.
[1:44:06.040 --> 1:44:16.040]  And so they're, I think, guilty of the Hatch Act. They need to be investigated by a real attorney general as to their violations and working with Hillary Clinton to try to get her elected.
[1:44:16.040 --> 1:44:19.040]  That's a violation of the Hatch Act, at the very least.
[1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:33.040]  Well, and I don't want to shock the InfoWars audience, but you'd almost think there's a provable case that establishment Republicans and Democrats in collusion with the media in the deep state are trying to fool the American public.
[1:44:33.040 --> 1:44:43.040]  Almost. I don't know. Like I said, I don't want to freak people out. If you're an InfoWars audience member, you're going, and that's the story.
[1:44:43.040 --> 1:44:49.040]  And also, Lee, you know, you're there. You've been at the White House press conference and press corps and everything.
[1:44:49.040 --> 1:45:00.040]  And of course, Jim Acosta, White House press corps representative for CNN, full week after you had the New York Times and Reuters say that, no, it wasn't 17 agencies.
[1:45:00.040 --> 1:45:03.040]  And they said it was three or four. It wasn't. It was just crowd striking clapper.
[1:45:03.040 --> 1:45:08.040]  But anyway, when Trump talked about that, Jim Acosta took him to task.
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:12.040]  He says, oh, it was all seven. And that was a week after they've done their retraction.
[1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:23.040]  So even when other parts of mainstream media will retract and do it quietly, you still have people like CNN pushing that long term narrative to the public.
[1:45:23.040 --> 1:45:33.040]  The way the American propaganda machine works, when we think of propaganda, we think of North Korea, where they have one state news agency and all the news comes through that.
[1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:37.040]  Or the Soviet Union, where you had provident tasks and that's it, right?
[1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:44.040]  The way the American propaganda machine works is you have 500 channels, but they're all pushing the same narrative.
[1:45:44.040 --> 1:45:46.040]  Yes. You see what I'm saying? Yes. Yes.
[1:45:46.040 --> 1:45:49.040]  And really, we go with five or six companies.
[1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:51.040]  That's right.
[1:45:51.040 --> 1:45:57.040]  But it's very important that people understand it. They do it by two means, repetition.
[1:45:57.040 --> 1:46:02.040]  So you don't forget, this is not Info Wars versus CNN.
[1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:05.040]  This is not Breitbart versus the Washington Post.
[1:46:05.040 --> 1:46:14.040]  This is a handful of sites, Info Wars, Breitbart, Daily Caller, a few others, against everybody else.
[1:46:14.040 --> 1:46:20.040]  That's right. It used to just be, and I think it's interestingly to say, we used to have like three to five channels that we could listen to.
[1:46:20.040 --> 1:46:24.040]  And they would all say the same thing, Operation Mockingbird, being what we've got up if you don't know what that is.
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:26.040]  But you'll probably do if you're listening to Info Wars.
[1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:32.040]  Now we've got three to five companies, but they've got 500 channels to say the same thing.
[1:46:32.040 --> 1:46:34.040]  That's essentially what we're looking at now.
[1:46:34.040 --> 1:46:37.040]  That's right. And they do it two ways by repetition and omission.
[1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:42.040]  Repetition is everybody in that press room, where I've been in the White House press room many times,
[1:46:42.040 --> 1:46:46.040]  and everybody's asking a variant of the same question.
[1:46:46.040 --> 1:46:51.040]  David, I've literally heard other reporters congratulate each other and say, hey, good job on picking up my question.
[1:46:51.040 --> 1:46:54.040]  And they literally said, this is the way we're going to do this.
[1:46:54.040 --> 1:46:56.040]  We need to carry the ball down the field for each other.
[1:46:56.040 --> 1:47:00.040]  They see themselves as a, I literally heard this, David.
[1:47:00.040 --> 1:47:02.040]  They see themselves as a team.
[1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:04.040]  But the other way they do it is omission.
[1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:09.040]  If you look at the pushback against Sean Hannity's bringing the story up,
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:19.040]  the Washington Post and CNN never mentioned once the email where Ali Chalupa is reporting to the DNC.
[1:47:19.040 --> 1:47:21.040]  She says, I'll have more for you.
[1:47:21.040 --> 1:47:28.040]  And it's forwarded by the DNC's Luis Rivera, who's the director of communications.
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:32.040]  He forwards it to the Democrats National Press Secretary.
[1:47:32.040 --> 1:47:34.040]  These are not low level people, David.
[1:47:34.040 --> 1:47:35.040]  Right.
[1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:36.040]  This is provable.
[1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:37.040]  Every single thing is so provable.
[1:47:37.040 --> 1:47:42.040]  And this is one of the reasons I'm really big on, I don't like conjecture,
[1:47:42.040 --> 1:47:48.040]  because this story, which is all provable and admitted,
[1:47:48.040 --> 1:47:55.040]  proves exactly what the Info Wars audience and people like you and Alex have been saying for years.
[1:47:55.040 --> 1:47:59.040]  There is in fact, I don't know how else to put it without sounding like an ad,
[1:47:59.040 --> 1:48:01.040]  there is a conspiracy to control your mind.
[1:48:01.040 --> 1:48:02.040]  That's what's going on here.
[1:48:02.040 --> 1:48:07.040]  And the way they do it is repetition every single day on these other networks,
[1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:11.040]  and then they leave out key facts and key stories.
[1:48:11.040 --> 1:48:14.040]  There's no coverage of this Ukrainian thing, nothing.
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:19.040]  So thank you, David, for, I really, God bless you for the work you guys are doing,
[1:48:19.040 --> 1:48:21.040]  and God bless you for giving this.
[1:48:21.040 --> 1:48:22.040]  Oh, no, you're doing great research.
[1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:26.040]  And break down what you were saying earlier about the electoral college.
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:28.040]  We never did get to that connection.
[1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:33.040]  We were talking about the connection of this long-term convicted criminal, Brett Kimberlin,
[1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:36.040]  to the DNC, to the foreign agents who are coming here.
[1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:42.040]  Tell us how they were working to subvert the electoral college, possibly.
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:43.040]  Well, you can see it.
[1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:46.040]  They were openly working to subvert the electoral college,
[1:48:46.040 --> 1:48:48.040]  and Andrea Chalupa, Alexander's sister,
[1:48:48.040 --> 1:48:51.040]  who was part of bringing this foreign national over.
[1:48:51.040 --> 1:48:55.040]  She was connected, right?
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:58.040]  She was openly, they were openly talking about, well,
[1:48:58.040 --> 1:49:01.040]  what can we do to keep Donald Trump from getting seated?
[1:49:01.040 --> 1:49:05.040]  This foreign national came up with a plan that Obama would step down,
[1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:07.040]  Biden would take over.
[1:49:07.040 --> 1:49:10.040]  He would name someone like John Kasich as his vice president.
[1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:15.040]  After they've subverted the electoral college, you'd have a 50-50 split in Congress.
[1:49:15.040 --> 1:49:16.040]  This was his idea.
[1:49:16.040 --> 1:49:21.040]  This was his idea, which Democrats apparently loved.
[1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:24.040]  Democrats apparently thought it was a good idea.
[1:49:24.040 --> 1:49:29.040]  And it seems like it went to the level where it was pitched to President Obama,
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:32.040]  and there was frustration that Obama wouldn't do it.
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:35.040]  So, this is stunning.
[1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:40.040]  But, and again, it sounds like something we'd make up, right?
[1:49:40.040 --> 1:49:43.040]  I mean, it sounds crazy.
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:45.040]  Well, you know, we see that type of thing in history in the past.
[1:49:45.040 --> 1:49:46.040]  We see Democrats on Capitol Hill.
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:48.040]  Yeah, we see crazy things like that in the past.
[1:49:48.040 --> 1:49:50.040]  If you go back and look at Operation Northwoods,
[1:49:50.040 --> 1:49:54.040]  we had the staff pitching to President Kennedy to say,
[1:49:54.040 --> 1:49:58.040]  hey, we could have, you know, false flag terrorists who would attack malls,
[1:49:58.040 --> 1:50:01.040]  who would fly planes in the buildings, and we could blame it on Castro.
[1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:03.040]  And that would give us a pretense to invade Cuba.
[1:50:03.040 --> 1:50:05.040]  And Kennedy shot it down.
[1:50:05.040 --> 1:50:09.040]  And then not too long after that, they shot Kennedy down, literally shot him down.
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:13.040]  This foreign national, Jonathan Swartz, a.k.a. Yanni,
[1:50:13.040 --> 1:50:16.040]  that's the name of Yanni Ariel, that's the name he uses,
[1:50:16.040 --> 1:50:20.040]  he was with the ANC, but he was in the intelligence division at ANC.
[1:50:20.040 --> 1:50:23.040]  He was with the militant wing of the ANC, you follow me?
[1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:27.040]  So, this, he's not an insubstantial person.
[1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:33.040]  He's not just like a lone guy sitting in his room knitting tinfoil, right?
[1:50:33.040 --> 1:50:39.040]  This is a guy who was with the African National Congress in the late 70s, early 80s.
[1:50:39.040 --> 1:50:41.040]  By the way, when they were connected to the Soviets.
[1:50:41.040 --> 1:50:43.040]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:45.040]  All right, we've got to take a quick break.
[1:50:45.040 --> 1:50:47.040]  In fact, one more segment with Lee Strandhand.
[1:50:47.040 --> 1:50:49.040]  We're going to try to wrap this up, sum it up,
[1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:53.040]  and he's going to tell you where you can find the rest of his breaking article.
[1:50:53.040 --> 1:50:57.040]  He's done a lot of research on this, and he is a very careful journalist.
[1:50:57.040 --> 1:50:58.040]  So stay with us. We'll be right back.
[1:50:58.040 --> 1:51:27.040]  David Knight with Owen Shroyer and Lee Strandhand.
[1:51:28.040 --> 1:51:30.040]  In the chaos from any one of these threats arises,
[1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:34.040]  the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[1:51:34.040 --> 1:51:37.040]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[1:51:37.040 --> 1:51:40.040]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[1:52:05.040 --> 1:52:08.040]  Today I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA forces
[1:52:08.040 --> 1:52:10.040]  finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:14.040]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for auto-ship

[1:52:25.040 --> 1:52:27.040]  an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[1:52:27.040 --> 1:52:30.040]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup
[1:52:30.040 --> 1:52:33.040]  of patented ingredients like CoQ-10, systematic enzymes,
[1:52:33.040 --> 1:52:36.040]  NAR-lipoic acid, BioPQQ and many others.
[1:52:36.040 --> 1:52:41.040]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies,
[1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:45.040]  and just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.

[1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:39.040]  why the media is not reporting on it.

[1:55:51.040 --> 1:55:53.040]  I want to go back to Lee Strandhand.
[1:55:53.040 --> 1:55:57.040]  Lee, we're getting into the George Soros aspect of this
[1:55:57.040 --> 1:56:00.040]  and how everything is being funded and pushed by Soros.
[1:56:00.040 --> 1:56:02.040]  What do you think that's about?
[1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:05.040]  Well, Soros clearly, there's two things.
[1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:07.040]  Number one, he spent a lot of money in the Ukraine.
[1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:11.040]  He helped overthrow Yanukovych.
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:14.040]  And the way he did that is what he's doing in the United States.
[1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:16.040]  This is what people really need to be aware of.
[1:56:16.040 --> 1:56:21.040]  What happened in the Ukraine in what was called the Euro-Madan Revolution,
[1:56:21.040 --> 1:56:25.040]  at the end of 2013, early 2014, was that...
[1:56:25.040 --> 1:56:27.040]  Tell me if this sounds familiar.
[1:56:27.040 --> 1:56:30.040]  All these protest groups started being coming forward
[1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:33.040]  and protesting, trying to delegitimize the president,
[1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:35.040]  doing big demonstrations.
[1:56:35.040 --> 1:56:37.040]  Sound familiar? Sound like what's been happening?
[1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:39.040]  Yeah, and his color revolutions now are going to look like
[1:56:39.040 --> 1:56:42.040]  the colors that he's using now are racial colors.
[1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:45.040]  That's why he's doing it with Black Lives Matter and other groups now.
[1:56:45.040 --> 1:56:48.040]  And also those pink hats during the Women's March.
[1:56:48.040 --> 1:56:52.040]  But Soros, if you look at things like there was a march here a few weeks,
[1:56:52.040 --> 1:56:55.040]  Soros is clearly funding all these groups in the United States
[1:56:55.040 --> 1:56:59.040]  just as he funded them in Ukraine, right?
[1:56:59.040 --> 1:57:06.040]  And what they're trying to do is delegitimize Trump and delegitimize Russia.
[1:57:06.040 --> 1:57:08.040]  That's what they're trying to do.
[1:57:08.040 --> 1:57:14.040]  And what I noticed was Soros kept showing up all over the place here.
[1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:19.040]  And so, for instance, Ali Chalupa in that email that she sent to the DNC,
[1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:23.040]  she spoke at a place called the Open World Leadership Center.
[1:57:23.040 --> 1:57:26.040]  Well, guess who was on the board of the Open World Leadership Center
[1:57:26.040 --> 1:57:29.040]  when it started in 2002? George Soros.
[1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:31.040]  I posted that on my Twitter page.
[1:57:31.040 --> 1:57:35.040]  So he keeps showing up every place you look here.
[1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:37.040]  He's the financier.
[1:57:37.040 --> 1:57:41.040]  What Hillary Clinton was able to do was while she was Secretary of State,
[1:57:41.040 --> 1:57:44.040]  she was able to use the embassy in Kiev.
[1:57:44.040 --> 1:57:48.040]  Remember, I talked about how he was funding these groups that were doing protests?
[1:57:48.040 --> 1:57:54.040]  We were doing these things called tech camp at the U.S. Embassy
[1:57:54.040 --> 1:57:57.040]  where we were literally training activists.
[1:57:57.040 --> 1:58:00.040]  I've got to say this again, we were training activists.
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:02.040]  And this started two things.
[1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:08.040]  The Arab Spring, tech camp was a way to show activists how to use technology.
[1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:09.040]  That's what it was.
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:10.040]  Yes.
[1:58:10.040 --> 1:58:11.040]  You can look it up.
[1:58:11.040 --> 1:58:13.040]  It was a program started by Hillary Clinton.
[1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:14.040]  Civil Society 2.0.
[1:58:14.040 --> 1:58:15.040]  Just look up.
[1:58:15.040 --> 1:58:17.040]  Hillary Clinton, Civil Society 2.0.
[1:58:17.040 --> 1:58:19.040]  That's what fomented the revolution.
[1:58:19.040 --> 1:58:23.040]  And that's exactly what Clinton and Soros are trying to do now.
[1:58:23.040 --> 1:58:24.040]  The same MO.
[1:58:24.040 --> 1:58:29.040]  And you've got a literal Nazi collaborator, George Soros, a literal Nazi that's behind it.
[1:58:29.040 --> 1:58:31.040]  The Moriarty of regime change.
[1:58:31.040 --> 1:58:35.040]  Tell us, Lee, where we can find this article that you're going to break all this down.
[1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:38.040]  Well, if you go to populist.tv right now,
[1:58:38.040 --> 1:58:43.040]  we've got a new piece up right now that goes over the details of some of the stuff.
[1:58:43.040 --> 1:58:45.040]  We'll write back infowars.com.
[1:58:45.040 --> 1:58:49.040]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:49.040 --> 1:59:18.040]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:59:19.040 --> 1:59:22.040]  I'm going to talk about the secret behind DNA force is its powerful lineup of patented
[1:59:22.040 --> 1:59:29.040]  ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes, NAR, lipoic acid, BioPQQ, and many others.
[1:59:29.040 --> 1:59:34.040]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies, and just one batch of
[1:59:34.040 --> 1:59:37.040]  this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[1:59:37.040 --> 1:59:40.040]  Visit infowarslife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[1:59:40.040 --> 1:59:45.040]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA force an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars through our third-party
[1:59:45.040 --> 1:59:47.040]  certified review agency, Power Review.

[2:00:18.040 --> 2:00:30.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:00:30.040 --> 2:00:34.040]  We just had Lee Strayhan breaking down how the Clintons were colluding with Ukraine to
[2:00:34.040 --> 2:00:38.040]  try to delegitimize President Trump and Russia, George Soros, being behind that.
[2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:40.040]  This is another bombshell.
[2:00:40.040 --> 2:00:45.040]  This is another angle of the corruption from the Clinton campaign and the Democrats.
[2:00:45.040 --> 2:00:50.040]  Exclusive from the Daily Caller, FBI seized smashed hard drives from Wasserman Schultz
[2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:51.040]  ITA's home.
[2:00:51.040 --> 2:00:53.040]  Now, this is a big development.
[2:00:53.040 --> 2:00:59.040]  Wasserman Schultz and the DNC have been doing everything they can to keep the FBI from getting
[2:00:59.040 --> 2:01:00.040]  these documents.
[2:01:00.040 --> 2:01:02.040]  They have been stonewalling.
[2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:04.040]  They have been not cooperating.
[2:01:04.040 --> 2:01:10.040]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz has even gone as far as to threaten the Capitol Police for retaining
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:12.040]  these hard drives.
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:17.040]  But now they finally got it and not only did they get the hard drives from Wasserman Schultz,
[2:01:17.040 --> 2:01:24.040]  they also got older hard drives from Pakistani born Imran Awan, who was working with his
[2:01:24.040 --> 2:01:29.040]  three brothers and their wives for multiple members of the Democrat Party.
[2:01:29.040 --> 2:01:31.040]  Paid very well, by the way, too.
[2:01:31.040 --> 2:01:33.040]  Paid millions of dollars, in fact.
[2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:36.040]  Very, very well compared to anybody else that does this kind of comparable work.
[2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:38.040]  And they were stealing property.
[2:01:38.040 --> 2:01:42.040]  They got busted by the Capitol Police for stealing computer equipment.
[2:01:42.040 --> 2:01:45.040]  And so there's a lot more involved in that.
[2:01:45.040 --> 2:01:47.040]  I wish I had time to get to all this.
[2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:50.040]  But basically, you have Wasserman Schultz who's destroying hard drives.
[2:01:50.040 --> 2:01:52.040]  You have the Awan brothers that are destroying hard drives.
[2:01:52.040 --> 2:01:53.040]  And stealing them.
[2:01:53.040 --> 2:01:57.040]  And then finally, the FBI comes in here and now has the hard drives.
[2:01:57.040 --> 2:02:01.040]  Wasserman Schultz threatens Capitol Police for taking the hard drives.
[2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:06.040]  The guy who came into the house, who moved into the house that the Awan brothers were living in,
[2:02:06.040 --> 2:02:12.040]  he found a bunch of weird burnt up hard drives and clearly hard drives that they tried to destroy,
[2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:13.040]  as well as other stuff.
[2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:15.040]  So you've got all of these crazy angles.
[2:02:15.040 --> 2:02:20.040]  And all the mainstream media wants to talk about is Trump and Russia.
[2:02:20.040 --> 2:02:23.040]  All they're talking about on the Hill is Trump and Russia.
[2:02:23.040 --> 2:02:26.040]  It's a conviction looking for evidence.
[2:02:26.040 --> 2:02:27.040]  You know what Awan called?
[2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:29.040]  Well, we look at this daily caller thing.
[2:02:29.040 --> 2:02:33.040]  They were exposing these brothers who were hired by Wasserman Schultz and others,
[2:02:33.040 --> 2:02:36.040]  and the crimes that they committed in terms of stealing.
[2:02:36.040 --> 2:02:39.040]  It kind of reminds me of the old story, you know, the guy that they kept going across the border.
[2:02:39.040 --> 2:02:41.040]  They thought he was smuggling something.
[2:02:41.040 --> 2:02:43.040]  And then they eventually figure out, hey, he's stealing bicycles.
[2:02:43.040 --> 2:02:47.040]  You know, when these guys take these hard drives, it's probably the information on the hard drives
[2:02:47.040 --> 2:02:50.040]  that they were just trying to get out and destroy.
[2:02:50.040 --> 2:02:54.040]  So here's the question that the public needs to ask.
[2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:56.040]  And it should be asked on Capitol Hill.
[2:02:56.040 --> 2:02:58.040]  It should be asked by the mainstream media, but they won't do it.
[2:02:58.040 --> 2:03:01.040]  They are total failures.
[2:03:01.040 --> 2:03:05.040]  Why did Hillary Clinton delete 33,000 emails and destroy cell phones?
[2:03:05.040 --> 2:03:09.040]  Why did Debbie Wasserman Schultz destroy multiple hard drives?
[2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:13.040]  Why did the Awan brothers who worked for multiple members of the Democrat Party
[2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:15.040]  destroy multiple hard drives?
[2:03:15.040 --> 2:03:22.040]  And then why did the Awans and Debbie Wasserman Schultz both threaten Capitol police
[2:03:22.040 --> 2:03:25.040]  when they took the hard drives?
[2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:27.040]  And I forgot another angle of this.
[2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:32.040]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz people called Jared Beck's office.
[2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:37.040]  Jared Beck is representing the plaintiffs right now in the DNC fraud lawsuit.
[2:03:37.040 --> 2:03:46.040]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz called the Beck's law firm, put on a voice modulator, and threatened them.
[2:03:46.040 --> 2:03:51.040]  And they're so dumb that they didn't even have the wherewithal to change the phone number.
[2:03:51.040 --> 2:03:53.040]  What are they hiding?
[2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:55.040]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[2:03:55.040 --> 2:03:57.040]  What is it that they're hiding?
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:03:58.040]  So think about it.
[2:03:58.040 --> 2:04:02.040]  All the investigation in Trump Rush on the Hill, nothing there.
[2:04:02.040 --> 2:04:08.040]  Lee Stranahan, an independent journalist just broke down the actual collusion with the Clinton campaign and Ukraine.
[2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:13.040]  We've got all of the investigation on Trump Rush occlusion, but yet we have all of the evidence.
[2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:18.040]  We have clear cases of obstruction of justice with Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:23.040]  We have an actual lawsuit being levied against the DNC right now.
[2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:25.040]  You know what I think, David?
[2:04:25.040 --> 2:04:34.040]  I think amongst probably heinous other things that we won't even get into, I think that the Clintons and the Wasserman Schultz of the world at the Democrat Party
[2:04:34.040 --> 2:04:42.040]  deleted these emails, deleted and smashed these hard drives because everything that Lee Stranahan just said was on there and everything about the DNC was on there.
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:48.040]  They stole the election from Bernie Sanders and they colluded with Ukraine and I think it's all in there and that's why they smashed it.
[2:04:48.040 --> 2:04:50.040]  Or I guess they just regularly do that.
[2:04:50.040 --> 2:04:51.040]  You think?
[2:04:51.040 --> 2:04:53.040]  No, I'm done with this phone.
[2:04:53.040 --> 2:04:55.040]  They look at these guys and they say, hey, they're stealing on their hardware.
[2:04:55.040 --> 2:04:57.040]  No, they're stealing and covering up information.
[2:04:57.040 --> 2:04:58.040]  I'll be right back.
[2:04:58.040 --> 2:05:01.040]  I'm going to get a new computer, so I'm going to smash up this one during the break.
[2:05:01.040 --> 2:05:22.040]  We'll be right back with Michael Snyder.
[2:05:22.040 --> 2:05:31.040]  The only question is, how do we contain it and how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual? That is the ultimate concern.
[2:05:31.040 --> 2:05:37.040]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[2:05:37.040 --> 2:05:40.040]  It was why the anti-Fedalists opposed the Constitution.
[2:05:40.040 --> 2:05:49.040]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power, but as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[2:05:49.040 --> 2:05:54.040]  A people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[2:05:54.040 --> 2:06:00.040]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[2:06:00.040 --> 2:06:03.040]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[2:06:03.040 --> 2:06:32.040]  FriendForWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[2:06:32.040 --> 2:06:42.040]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[2:06:42.040 --> 2:06:51.040]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[2:06:51.040 --> 2:06:58.040]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[2:06:58.040 --> 2:07:03.040]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies.
[2:07:03.040 --> 2:07:32.040]  With Z-Field and InforWarsLive.com.
[2:07:33.040 --> 2:08:00.040]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[2:08:00.040 --> 2:08:06.040]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[2:08:06.040 --> 2:08:31.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight here with Owen Schreuer, and we have joining us now Michael Snyder.
[2:08:31.040 --> 2:08:39.040]  Michael Snyder is a frequent contributor to the Alex Jones Show to InforWars.com, and of course he's now been attacked for that.
[2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:42.040]  Why? Because he's running for Congress in Idaho.
[2:08:42.040 --> 2:09:03.040]  Alternate, with a right-wing watch. Earlier this month, Radical Religious Right Prepper Pundit Michael Snyder announced that he's running for Congress in Idaho for the seat being vacated by Representative Raoul Labrador who's running now for governor.
[2:09:03.040 --> 2:09:12.040]  And of course they talk about some of the heinous positions that you take, which are things for freedom. You actually support health freedom, Idaho.
[2:09:12.040 --> 2:09:26.040]  I mean, who would want to support health freedom? This coming from the people who always like to identify themselves as pro-choice, unless that's the choice that you want to make for your children's health, the choice you want to make for your children's education, the choice you want to make for your own health care.
[2:09:26.040 --> 2:09:36.040]  No, no, no. We're not going to have any of those choices. The only choice that matters is the choice to abort your child. After that, they will make all the choices for you and for your children.
[2:09:36.040 --> 2:09:45.040]  So joining us now is Michael Snyder. He has economiccollapseblog.com, and also you can find him at michaelsnyderforcongress.com. Thank you for joining us, Michael.
[2:09:45.040 --> 2:09:48.040]  David, it's great to be with you guys again. Thank you for having me.
[2:09:48.040 --> 2:10:00.040]  So how do you, do you own this fact that you are a prepper pundit? I mean, is that a negative, or is that something that could get you elected in Idaho?
[2:10:00.040 --> 2:10:10.040]  Up here, people love that kind of thing. So yeah, I'm glad to be attacked by the left because it just shows people how truly conservative, how, you know, liberty-oriented I am.
[2:10:10.040 --> 2:10:20.040]  So these attacks, and you know, David, when I first started, when I jumped into this, I maybe was a little bit naive. I didn't know that it was going to be kind of like running into a hornet's nest.
[2:10:20.040 --> 2:10:30.040]  And already I've been getting really nasty emails, not just directed at me, but my wife and even my two-year-old daughter. People, I had one guy say the most horrible things about my two-year-old daughter.
[2:10:30.040 --> 2:10:40.040]  And of course, the left is jumping on me for being, they're calling me an anti-vaxxer just because I'm concerned, hey, I want us to be able to make our own choices, what we put into our own bodies.
[2:10:40.040 --> 2:10:54.040]  I believe parents should be able to decide for their own children, make the health choices for their own children, not mandated by the state like we're seeing out in California and other places where these big vaccine manufacturers want to pass laws to force us to take vaccines,
[2:10:54.040 --> 2:11:08.040]  which study after study has shown that there's dangers and we've seen rates of autism absolutely skyrocket. So there are major concerns, but they want to take our choice totally away from us.
[2:11:08.040 --> 2:11:15.040]  And that's what the left always want. They want to take away liberty and freedom and impose their choices on the rest of us.
[2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:29.040]  And they don't want to have a discussion. They want to censor things. Well, you say you're under attack. Wait until they start talking about how you colluded with Russia, you met with prostitutes, concoct a report from MI5 to take you down.
[2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:35.040]  I mean, that's when you know that you're really over the target. They'll probably wait until you get elected before they do something like that.
[2:11:35.040 --> 2:11:45.040]  But good luck to your race. And is there anything on your radar that you want to talk about or do you just want to talk about your races coming up here?
[2:11:45.040 --> 2:11:57.040]  Well, we can certainly talk about my race, but we can talk about all kinds of things. We can talk about Obamacare just today. You know, now they're saying the Senate might pass a skinny version of Obamacare repeal.
[2:11:57.040 --> 2:12:07.040]  Very, very limited in terms of what they want to do. But it just seems like they can't do anything. And that's part of the reason, David, why we need good people to get into Congress and the Senate.
[2:12:07.040 --> 2:12:21.040]  Because up to this point, this is being called the most inactive Congress in 164 years. And even though we gave the Republicans the White House and the Senate and the House of Representatives, we can't seem to get anything done.
[2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:31.040]  Trump's agenda is stalled on all these major issues, whether it's Obamacare, repealing Obamacare, one of the worst pieces of legislation in US history, whether it's building the wall.
[2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:38.040]  Trump is not just being blocked by the Democrats, but many Republicans don't want to build the wall on the southern border, whether it's lowering taxes.
[2:12:38.040 --> 2:12:50.040]  Nothing has been accomplished on tax reform so far or defunding Planned Parenthood. The list goes on. And you know what? Even though they've done nothing, they're about to go on vacation very quickly here.
[2:12:50.040 --> 2:12:52.040]  Congratulate themselves.
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:13:01.040]  Well, you know, we just had a clip earlier in the show where we had former Speaker Boehner say they're not going to get rid of Obamacare. They're not going to get anything done on tax return.
[2:13:01.040 --> 2:13:12.040]  He's Exhibit A and of course his handpicked successor, Paul Rhino, who was a running mate of Mitt Romney and they were going to give us Romneycare if we didn't get Obamacare.
[2:13:12.040 --> 2:13:22.040]  They had already enacted Obamacare. Mitt Romney had in Massachusetts with Ted Kennedy and Obamacare was simply a clone of that plan.
[2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:29.040]  So when we see John Boehner talking about, well, you know, Trump wasn't my first pick. He wasn't my second or my third pick.
[2:13:29.040 --> 2:13:37.040]  They always give us a choice of two people who are going to give us the same thing in the end. And that's what we saw when we had Romney running against Obama.
[2:13:37.040 --> 2:13:45.040]  So we're going to get government-run health care regardless of who we picked. They were going to give us, they were going to handpick the two choices to give us and that was going to be the choice.
[2:13:45.040 --> 2:14:00.040]  So it's great to have a different choice who's running. Tell us what you would change about Obamacare. I mean, do you want to rip it out, root and branch, or would you sign into any of these bills that have come through so far that have been proposed by the Senate or by the House?
[2:14:00.040 --> 2:14:10.040]  Well, David, what I would do is what Republicans have been promising the voters for years and years. What I believe we need to do is first of all, let's repeal Obamacare 100%.
[2:14:10.040 --> 2:14:19.040]  The Republicans actually did this twice before. Twice before they passed a bill to completely repeal Obamacare and got it to Barack Obama's desk.
[2:14:19.040 --> 2:14:26.040]  Why can't they get that same bill to President Trump's desk? But beyond that, of course, that doesn't fix our health.
[2:14:26.040 --> 2:14:35.040]  They knew Trump would sign it. Well, that's the key though. Michael Snyder just pointed out the key. They knew Obama wasn't going to sign it, so they were okay with passing the repeal.
[2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:42.040]  Now they know that Trump would sign it, so they don't want to pass the repeal, or the repeal, excuse me, and you better just watch out today.
[2:14:42.040 --> 2:14:54.040]  The Republicans are going to bluff again and pretend like they're going to pass repeal. They're going to try to carry out this narrative for the rest of the week, stay in the media attention, pretend like they're working, and then go on vacation when they don't figure it out.
[2:14:54.040 --> 2:15:02.040]  It's all fake. It's all posing. They don't want to repeal Obamacare. But I want to get back, Michael Snyder, to the point you were talking about of being attacked from the left.
[2:15:02.040 --> 2:15:10.040]  You know, I don't think that the left realizes that these attacks aren't going to stick anymore. They can say here, oh, he's an anti-vaxxer. Look at, he's crazy.
[2:15:10.040 --> 2:15:15.040]  But people are going to, people are starting to move to the next level and say, alright, that's not, why is that crazy?
[2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:23.040]  He's just talking about vaccine choice, and actually vaccines is making people sick. So that's not going to stick. They don't want to debate you on actual issues.
[2:15:23.040 --> 2:15:31.040]  They don't want to debate you on actual substance. What about, I mean, are you hearing about your candidate? Have you talked about debating your candidate, where they stand on anything?
[2:15:31.040 --> 2:15:33.040]  Are your opponent, excuse me?
[2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:40.040]  Yeah, I've got two opponents and they're real establishment type Republicans kind of, and they're trying to appeal to the middle of the road.
[2:15:40.040 --> 2:15:49.040]  And so I'm trying to make a clear distinction that, hey, I'm the Liberty candidate, but, you know, every time the left attacks me, kind of like Trump, where the left and the mainstream media attack Trump, attack Trump,
[2:15:49.040 --> 2:15:54.040]  and they thought those attacks would work, but it just made him stronger, because people are starting to learn to think for themselves.
[2:15:54.040 --> 2:16:00.040]  And they're saying, hey, we're not necessarily going to take what the mainstream media tells us to do. We're going to look into this for ourselves.
[2:16:00.040 --> 2:16:07.040]  And so the media would attack Trump, they would look at him and say, no, no, we want what this guy is saying, because even though Trump is not perfect,
[2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:15.040]  he tapped into an underlying desire for liberty and freedom that's in the heart of all of us. And people say, we finally have a chance to fight back against the establishment.
[2:16:15.040 --> 2:16:23.040]  Yeah, maybe this guy's not 100% perfect, but he's fighting. He's fighting and he's trying to fight back against the establishment.
[2:16:23.040 --> 2:16:32.040]  And so, you know, and I think that's going to strike up a chord up here with my campaign and what I want to do in that, you know, a lot of conservatives say, oh, yeah, I'm a conservative.
[2:16:32.040 --> 2:16:42.040]  But what does that mean? Like, for example, a lot of people say they're pro-gun, but and yet they don't, when Republicans get into office, they don't want to do anything to repeal the laws that are already in place.
[2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:52.040]  For example, if I am fortunate enough to go to Washington, you know, in terms of being pro-gun, I want to abolish the BATFE, which has been abusive.
[2:16:52.040 --> 2:17:03.040]  I mean, it goes back for decades. Alex Jones has been talking about this for as long as he's been on the air, but that's an agency we need to completely abolish because they've been used to harass and abuse gun owners for decades.
[2:17:03.040 --> 2:17:14.040]  I also want to start repealing the federal gun laws that have been on the books, were passed under Democrats, but were never repealed, like the National Firearms Act of 1934.
[2:17:14.040 --> 2:17:23.040]  The Gun Control Act of 1968 needs to be completely repealed. All these federal laws so that we can fully restore Second Amendment rights.
[2:17:23.040 --> 2:17:30.040]  Yeah, you know, when they talk about you being hit, they love to use labels, Michael, right? So when they talk about you being an anti-vaxxer, why don't you throw back some other labels?
[2:17:30.040 --> 2:17:34.040]  I'm not an anti-vaxxer. I'm pro-life and pro-choice.
[2:17:34.040 --> 2:17:35.040]  Yeah, I'm pro-choice.
[2:17:35.040 --> 2:17:39.040]  They won't know what to do with that. It's like, I'm pro-life and pro-choice. It's like, what does that mean?
[2:17:39.040 --> 2:17:43.040]  And just say, I'm for health freedom. I'm pro-life and pro-choice.
[2:17:43.040 --> 2:17:48.040]  Yeah, and ultimately, that's what we all should be able to agree on.
[2:17:48.040 --> 2:17:55.040]  This country, our founders wanted a nation where liberty and freedom would be maximized, and so they wanted a limited federal government.
[2:17:55.040 --> 2:18:01.040]  They wanted a limited number of laws and rules and regulations to protect life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[2:18:01.040 --> 2:18:08.040]  But beyond that, they wanted people to make their own choices, to live their own lives and to pursue their own dreams, and that's what we need to return to.
[2:18:08.040 --> 2:18:15.040]  Instead, the left, the control freaks that run things, what they want to do, they're constantly coming up with new laws, new rules and new regulations.
[2:18:15.040 --> 2:18:19.040]  So on the federal level, we've got hundreds of thousands of laws just on the federal level.
[2:18:19.040 --> 2:18:27.040]  But when you throw in state and local levels, all the levels of government in this country, the total number of laws and rules and regulations governing us is in the millions.
[2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:33.040]  And every new law, every new rule, regulation, government agency restricts our liberty and freedom in some way.
[2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:39.040]  And so that's, you know, we need to swing the pendulum completely back from where we're very, very restricted.
[2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:47.040]  Our liberties and freedoms have been greatly eroded. We need to go completely back in the other direction toward maximizing liberty and freedom.
[2:18:47.040 --> 2:18:54.040]  You know, here's the thing about what he just said. Most people don't understand the history. The liberals don't understand the history, especially the young liberals.
[2:18:54.040 --> 2:19:01.040]  America was created as a bastion of freedom to escape from big government. That's why America is here.
[2:19:01.040 --> 2:19:10.040]  It's not about being the best or being this or being that or being that. No, no, no, no. This is where you go when you're trying to escape oppressive governments.
[2:19:10.040 --> 2:19:16.040]  That's why this country was created. If you want to go to an oppressive regime, if you want to go to a big government, that exists other where.
[2:19:16.040 --> 2:19:20.040]  Not here in America. That's why this country was created, David.
[2:19:20.040 --> 2:19:30.040]  We declared our independence because the king had created a multitude of new offices and laws and sent swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.
[2:19:30.040 --> 2:19:34.040]  And nothing ever good comes out of a swarm. Let's just make that clear.
[2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:38.040]  And when you're talking about the regulations, Michael, you get elected.
[2:19:38.040 --> 2:19:51.040]  What you need to do is you need to work with Rand Paul on his Reigns Act to make sure that we don't have all of our laws being written by these unaccountable, unelected, and you can't remove them bureaucracies.
[2:19:51.040 --> 2:20:00.040]  That's the real issue. You can find Michael at michaelsniterforcongress.com. Also, he writes at economiccollapseblog.com, and you'll find his articles at infowars.com.

[2:24:45.040 --> 2:24:58.040]  I am here with breaking news and information. The biggest exclusive yet in the two-year history of us covering what's happening with the campaign of President Trump
[2:24:58.040 --> 2:25:03.040]  and of course what's happened since he was president-elect and then now president of the nation.
[2:25:03.040 --> 2:25:10.040]  So we have given you a lot of big exclusives, many of which came from the highest levels of the campaign and the White House.
[2:25:10.040 --> 2:25:18.040]  But this is undoubtedly, in this whole quickening season we're in, the biggest news on this particular subject we've ever revealed.
[2:25:18.040 --> 2:25:24.040]  And it's coming up in 35 minutes when Roger Stone joins us via Skype.
[2:25:24.040 --> 2:25:33.040]  Roger Stone, Infowars correspondent, covering things that obviously are happening inside the executive branch and inside Washington and inside the White House.
[2:25:33.040 --> 2:25:45.040]  He has high-level sources, as folks obviously know, and I've been authorized to tell you that this is probably the biggest news he's broke so far in the last, really, three years of this saga.
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:50.040]  We have the details of the shake-ups that are happening inside the White House.
[2:25:50.040 --> 2:25:54.040]  We have the details of what's about to happen to Attorney General's sessions.
[2:25:54.040 --> 2:26:01.040]  We have the details of more firings like you just saw from Mr. Scaramucci of operatives of rents previous.
[2:26:01.040 --> 2:26:06.040]  There has been a general amnesty given to people that if they leak one more time, they'll be removed.
[2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:10.040]  And as you see people leak, they're being removed each time.
[2:26:10.040 --> 2:26:13.040]  So this is a big, big deal. This is Trump taking the gloves off.
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:24.040]  Sessions, who I really like for whatever reason, is not going after Hillary for all the giant crimes she committed for getting money from the Russians and the Chinese for having illegal servers.
[2:26:24.040 --> 2:26:29.040]  And instead is going along with them trying to create a witch hunt against the president.
[2:26:29.040 --> 2:26:32.040]  Now, the executive branch has the right to fire sessions.
[2:26:32.040 --> 2:26:36.040]  He's trying to get sessions to resign, obviously. Sessions hasn't done that yet.
[2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:38.040]  And sessions is on his way out.
[2:26:38.040 --> 2:26:44.040]  And we need an attorney general that will go after the Clintons for their crimes, Obama for their crimes.
[2:26:44.040 --> 2:26:52.040]  They're going to continue to try to dig stuff up that's made up on Trump and destroy him as a figurehead of the Liberty Movement and derail our killing of the TPP,
[2:26:52.040 --> 2:26:58.040]  derail our killing of things like the carbon tax, and derail our economy coming back.
[2:26:58.040 --> 2:27:05.040]  So Trump is trying to force sessions out right now because he is not going after the people that have committed the crimes.
[2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:07.040]  They're the ones that have committed the crimes.
[2:27:07.040 --> 2:27:12.040]  And so understand this, folks, the Liberty Movement's destiny to a great extent is tied to Trump.
[2:27:12.040 --> 2:27:21.040]  He's a federal beachhead for us, an executive beachhead with good Supreme Court justices, 90-plus judges he's about to put into other major high courts.
[2:27:21.040 --> 2:27:23.040]  This is why the globalists are panicking.
[2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:29.040]  If he succeeds, and he's already partially done that, if we succeed, it is going to be a giant game changer.
[2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:34.040]  So you're going to get the inside intel on what Trump's doing, why he's doing it.
[2:27:34.040 --> 2:27:36.040]  This is not leaks.
[2:27:36.040 --> 2:27:47.040]  This is information, obviously, that folks want you to know that people in the White House obviously realize as does the enemy, as is David Brock, as is people like George Soros,
[2:27:47.040 --> 2:27:53.040]  while the only living globalist who's been involved in this for the last 60 years, he is firmly against us. They're sworn to destroy us.
[2:27:53.040 --> 2:28:02.040]  They've openly said they want to shut us down because they understand info wars is developing the counter talking points to their globalist narrative.
[2:28:02.040 --> 2:28:12.040]  Our talking points are based in truth, Americana, justice, free market, common sense, prosperity, and free society where you're free to be a Christian or not.
[2:28:12.040 --> 2:28:19.040]  The West, the Renaissance, that's under attack. Trump's bringing it back, and I didn't invent all these talking points.
[2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:24.040]  I simply popularized them again, just like working with gun owners of America.
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:28.040]  We re-radicalized the NRA in the last decade and took it back over.
[2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:38.040]  We were there to keep them honest, to get rid of the operatives, to get rid of the compromisers, and now the NRA is a giant gun owners of America ultra hard core that's saying what I say word for word.
[2:28:38.040 --> 2:28:43.040]  Not because I told them to say it, but because we've won the political debate, we've won the intellectual debate.
[2:28:43.040 --> 2:29:00.040]  All they've got left now is violence and cooked up garbage with every lawyer, Mueller's hired being a Democrat, and 99 plus percent, it's like 99.8, if it is, 99.8 percent of their campaign donations went to the Democratic Party in 2016.
[2:29:00.040 --> 2:29:04.040]  This is a lynch mob. Two of them were fired by Trump.
[2:29:04.040 --> 2:29:10.040]  We've got U.S. attorneys and people fired by Trump, now on a witch hunt.
[2:29:10.040 --> 2:29:15.040]  They'd be like if the judge, like you've been married to the judge, and she sat over the divorce court proceeding you're in.
[2:29:15.040 --> 2:29:18.040]  You're like, your honor, you're my wife, we're getting a divorce.
[2:29:18.040 --> 2:29:21.040]  The judge goes, no, I'm taking everything, I'm the judge.
[2:29:21.040 --> 2:29:24.040]  Of course, that never happened because you'd recuse yourself.
[2:29:24.040 --> 2:29:28.040]  It'd be flagrant misjustice, it'd be a miscarriage, everyone would see through it.
[2:29:28.040 --> 2:29:30.040]  That's what they're doing.
[2:29:30.040 --> 2:29:33.040]  So Roger Stone in T minus 30 minutes.
[2:29:33.040 --> 2:29:38.040]  Roger Stone in T minus 30 minutes is going to lay out all this massive news.
[2:29:38.040 --> 2:30:06.040]  Stay with us.
[2:30:06.040 --> 2:30:14.040]  Duty, honor, country, those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be.
[2:30:14.040 --> 2:30:22.040]  They are your rallying points to build courage when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith,
[2:30:22.040 --> 2:30:25.040]  to create hope when hope becomes forlorn.
[2:30:25.040 --> 2:30:34.040]  Unhappily, I possess neither that eloquence of dictation, that poetry of imagination, nor that brilliance of metaphor to tell you all that they mean.
[2:30:34.040 --> 2:30:39.040]  The unbelievers will say their but words, but a slogan, but a flamboyant phrase.
[2:30:39.040 --> 2:30:51.040]  Every demagogue, every cynic, every hypocrite, every troublemaker, and I am sorry to say some others of an entirely different character will try to downgrade them even to the extent of mockery and ridicule.
[2:30:51.040 --> 2:30:53.040]  But these are some of the things they do.
[2:30:53.040 --> 2:30:55.040]  They build your basic character.
[2:30:55.040 --> 2:30:59.040]  They mold you for the future roles as custodians of the nation's defense.
[2:30:59.040 --> 2:31:06.040]  This was set on May 12, 1962 by General Douglas MacArthur. I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[2:31:29.040 --> 2:31:35.040]  Remember and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[2:31:35.040 --> 2:31:42.040]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[2:31:42.040 --> 2:31:49.040]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[2:31:49.040 --> 2:31:54.040]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[2:31:54.040 --> 2:31:59.040]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press.
[2:31:59.040 --> 2:32:04.040]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[2:32:04.040 --> 2:32:25.040]  Available at InfowarsLife.com.
[2:32:34.040 --> 2:32:59.040]  InfowarsLife.com.
[2:32:59.040 --> 2:33:01.040]  InfowarsLife.com.
[2:33:01.040 --> 2:33:16.040]  InfowarsLife.com.
[2:33:16.040 --> 2:33:27.040]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:27.040 --> 2:33:31.040]  We are back live.
[2:33:31.040 --> 2:33:36.040]  Coming up at the start of the next hour, T-minus 30 minutes away.
[2:33:36.040 --> 2:33:52.040]  Coming up in the next hour, Roger Stone has been green-lighted to give you exclusive information of the shake-up of the ongoing purge of globalist deep state operators inside the Trump White House.
[2:33:52.040 --> 2:34:04.040]  This is highest level intel directly from the shake-up, exclusively given to Infowars so that we can relay that information out to you.
[2:34:04.040 --> 2:34:14.040]  The shake-ups that are coming, the offers of clemency that have been given to people, the amnesty that's been offered if they'll stop leaking,
[2:34:14.040 --> 2:34:22.040]  and the shake-ups coming not just inside the White House, but also at the Department of Justice.
[2:34:22.040 --> 2:34:29.040]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Senator Sessions is on his way out for refusing to go after the crimes of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and others.
[2:34:29.040 --> 2:34:33.040]  Trump is trying to get him to resign, but if he doesn't, he is about to be out.
[2:34:33.040 --> 2:34:38.040]  And we're going to tell you who's being looked at on the list to replace him.
[2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:41.040]  Some of the names, though, are quite frightening.
[2:34:41.040 --> 2:34:50.040]  So, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to give you a big data dump from Stone's sources in the White House, but also my sources and sources on Capitol Hill.
[2:34:50.040 --> 2:34:58.040]  All this is coming up in the third hour, all this is coming up at the end of the third hour into the fourth hour.
[2:34:58.040 --> 2:35:04.040]  This is all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, in the fourth hour with Roger Stone.
[2:35:04.040 --> 2:35:11.040]  Now, I want to go back to Owen Schreuer, I want to go back to their guest, I want to go back to David Knight, here in just a moment.
[2:35:11.040 --> 2:35:15.040]  But first, obviously, we're about to launch new shows.
[2:35:15.040 --> 2:35:18.040]  Obviously, we are trying to hire more people.
[2:35:18.040 --> 2:35:20.040]  Obviously, we're having a lot of contest.
[2:35:20.040 --> 2:35:26.040]  Obviously, we're in the eye of the storm going up against the globalists right now, and it's so important for everybody to continue to pray for info wars,
[2:35:26.040 --> 2:35:31.040]  but also pray for President Trump, pray for this republic, because we're the targets.
[2:35:31.040 --> 2:35:38.040]  Destroy us, they believe the mouthpieces will be gone, and that will intimidate you, and that will have a leaderless movement here.
[2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:45.040]  We all know that's not the case. Liberty's popular, you can't hold it down like a beach ball underwater, it's going to get back to the surface with amazing pressure.
[2:35:45.040 --> 2:35:52.040]  But financial support is so critical, and I want people to experience how good these supplements and interstitials are.
[2:35:52.040 --> 2:36:00.040]  I want people to experience what X2 has done for me, because I was obviously deficient in bioavailable, true, pure, clean iodine.
[2:36:00.040 --> 2:36:08.040]  I was obviously having gut issues when I started getting on probiotics a few years ago, and then I got on Myco ZX, which only I take a few times a year,
[2:36:08.040 --> 2:36:13.040]  and it goes in and knocks out the yeast, the mold, the fungus, you name it, which is the whole other side of the equation.
[2:36:13.040 --> 2:36:18.040]  The bacteria, it was the other side of the equation. People know how great probiotics are, we have biome defense.
[2:36:18.040 --> 2:36:24.040]  It's at full price because it's about to sell out, but Myco ZX is so powerful, and I want you to have it.
[2:36:24.040 --> 2:36:33.040]  It's 46% off, even though it's been a great seller and has 500 plus reviews, 4.8 stars from third-party sites.
[2:36:33.040 --> 2:36:39.040]  I want you to have Myco ZX, because if you don't have a yeast candida or fungus or mold problem, then it's fine.
[2:36:39.040 --> 2:36:42.040]  It's just really good concentrated herbs and things that are good for you overall.
[2:36:42.040 --> 2:36:50.040]  But if you do, which they admit is an epidemic out there, not just in humans, but in bats or dying, people are getting brain tumors from funguses.
[2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:54.040]  It's mutating, it's out of control. Myco ZX is so incredible.
[2:36:54.040 --> 2:36:58.040]  At 46% off, it's almost a lost leader, because we have 100% markup.
[2:36:58.040 --> 2:37:02.040]  It sounds like a lot. In supplements, it's five to seven times usually. We don't do that.
[2:37:02.040 --> 2:37:04.040]  That's why we have super high-quality products in it.
[2:37:04.040 --> 2:37:08.040]  But right now, with it at that price, it's almost half off.
[2:37:08.040 --> 2:37:11.040]  So we make a few bucks on it. I want you to experience it.
[2:37:11.040 --> 2:37:15.040]  Sign up for auto-ship an additional 10% off, and then foldwarestore.com.
[2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:20.040]  Cancel any time. It's every 15, every 30, every three months, every nine months.
[2:37:20.040 --> 2:37:23.040]  Cancel any time, additional 10% off, and the biggest sale right now.
[2:37:23.040 --> 2:37:27.040]  60% plus off, 66% off retail.
[2:37:27.040 --> 2:37:30.040]  So it's $9.95 silver bullet, the exact same stuff.
[2:37:30.040 --> 2:37:35.040]  It's private labeled at Whole Foods for $19 when it's on sale, usually $24.
[2:37:35.040 --> 2:37:42.040]  It is, ladies and gentlemen, $9.95 silver bullet, 30 parts per million, made by the biggest lab in the United States.
[2:37:42.040 --> 2:37:46.040]  Super high-quality. You've got to watch some of the other silvers so they can be too strong.
[2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:51.040]  People say, oh, yeah, well, I don't care. I want, you know, however billion parts per million or whatever.
[2:37:51.040 --> 2:37:54.040]  You can get toxic at that level. But consult your own physician.
[2:37:54.040 --> 2:37:58.040]  It's believed by most experts 30 parts is what you want. It's the optimal level between.
[2:37:58.040 --> 2:38:01.040]  Because let's face it, you know, some of those kill viruses and bacteria.
[2:38:01.040 --> 2:38:06.040]  I mean, you know, it's mother nature antibiotic, but it doesn't have problems.
[2:38:06.040 --> 2:38:09.040]  Of course, the ancients talked about silver bullets, you know, being good or whatever.
[2:38:09.040 --> 2:38:12.040]  Silver crosses. Everybody knew silver was good, warded off evil.
[2:38:12.040 --> 2:38:15.040]  But they didn't know why they just associated with health. Now we know why.
[2:38:15.040 --> 2:38:20.040]  So mainline science is adopting silver now. We've been promoting it 20 plus years.
[2:38:20.040 --> 2:38:23.040]  But now, you notice, finally, they admit we're all right.
[2:38:23.040 --> 2:38:27.040]  Employal silver is super, super awesome and everybody's, I mean, I mean, it's the big rage for years now.
[2:38:27.040 --> 2:38:32.040]  We've got high quality, very low price, 66% off, and it funds what we're doing.
[2:38:32.040 --> 2:38:34.040]  So again, thank you all for what you're doing.
[2:38:34.040 --> 2:38:39.040]  We also have the CNN is fake news shirts with info wars.com is real news.
[2:38:39.040 --> 2:38:42.040]  Great way to meet like minded people to spread the word.
[2:38:42.040 --> 2:38:48.040]  But, you know, not as bulls wearing a Trump shirt, but you can still meet like minded people and stuff for folks that don't want to be that bold.
[2:38:48.040 --> 2:38:55.040]  The info or shirts the way to go is everybody hates CNN, at least 94% of folks according to polls, 6% trust mainstream media.
[2:38:55.040 --> 2:39:02.040]  So again, info wars store.com is the umbrella site info wars life.com is a supplement site or we'll answer all your questions.

[2:39:46.040 --> 2:39:52.040]  You know, these are still a deal at 200 bucks, but they're 149 right now competitors are $400 or more.
[2:39:52.040 --> 2:39:57.040]  Very similar units that have the same technology and handle the same square footage.

[2:40:16.040 --> 2:40:18.040]  He's doing what the people want.
[2:40:18.040 --> 2:40:20.040]  He's doing what justice demands moving against them.
[2:40:20.040 --> 2:40:24.040]  And it's not like Nixon who got caught admitting he was doing corrupt stuff.
[2:40:24.040 --> 2:40:28.040]  There was still like one, one million to what the Clintons and Obama's have done.
[2:40:28.040 --> 2:40:30.040]  So it was wrong.
[2:40:30.040 --> 2:40:41.040]  This is where they're making stuff up to stop Trump to stop our election and stop our return of control over the government to our own system info wars life.com info or store.com.
[2:40:41.040 --> 2:40:44.040]  Again, want to thank the great crew back to Michael Schneider.
[2:40:44.040 --> 2:40:47.040]  If he's still with us back to David Knight back to Owen Shroyer.
[2:40:47.040 --> 2:40:50.040]  They're in studio, but it's us or them.
[2:40:50.040 --> 2:40:51.040]  No quarter.
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:52.040]  They want violence to the war.
[2:40:52.040 --> 2:40:54.040]  They're coming after us. They want to arrest us.
[2:40:54.040 --> 2:40:55.040]  They want to kill Trump.
[2:40:55.040 --> 2:40:57.040]  They love killing babies.
[2:40:57.040 --> 2:40:58.040]  You know, they love evil.
[2:40:58.040 --> 2:40:59.040]  They love Satan.
[2:40:59.040 --> 2:41:00.040]  I mean, they really are evil.
[2:41:00.040 --> 2:41:03.040]  Just watch TV, watch MTV, watch Hollywood.
[2:41:03.040 --> 2:41:05.040]  It is a cult of mentally ill scum that want to rule us.
[2:41:05.040 --> 2:41:06.040]  And it's us or them.
[2:41:06.040 --> 2:41:14.040]  We're winning politically, but we need to go ahead and give Trump the backing with a AG to put these criminals in prison info wars.com.
[2:41:14.040 --> 2:41:18.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, now back to the live transmission from the central Texas command center.
[2:41:18.040 --> 2:41:25.040]  And it's the liberal media and the people that have infiltrated this government to take America down that started the civil war.
[2:41:25.040 --> 2:41:27.040]  That's who started the civil war.
[2:41:27.040 --> 2:41:29.040]  That's why we elected Trump.
[2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:30.040]  We are doing it peacefully.
[2:41:30.040 --> 2:41:31.040]  We are doing it politically.
[2:41:31.040 --> 2:41:33.040]  The left is trying to do it violently.
[2:41:33.040 --> 2:41:39.040]  That's why when I saw the story on Newsweek saying that Alex Jones is calling for a civil war, I was just fully triggered.
[2:41:39.040 --> 2:41:40.040]  Like, that's total bull.
[2:41:40.040 --> 2:41:43.040]  Kathy Griffin is the one that had a severed Trump's head.
[2:41:43.040 --> 2:41:47.040]  The left is the one that depicts Donald Trump being assassinated.
[2:41:47.040 --> 2:41:54.040]  It's the Democrats and Republicans colluding with one another, bringing down America for the last decades that wanted the civil war and brought in Obamacare.
[2:41:54.040 --> 2:42:05.040]  But real quick, as Roger Stone is about to have groundbreaking news here at 2 p.m. central here on the Alex Jones show, the left is cornered, folks.
[2:42:05.040 --> 2:42:10.040]  Now, this isn't what the picture that's being painted right now by the mainstream media, but this is the accurate picture.
[2:42:10.040 --> 2:42:16.040]  The left is completely cornered and President Trump is ready to put them in the corner with his gloves up.
[2:42:16.040 --> 2:42:17.040]  Gloves off as well.
[2:42:17.040 --> 2:42:20.040]  That's why he brought in Scaramucci as communications director.
[2:42:20.040 --> 2:42:23.040]  He's going to be dictating the terms of communication.
[2:42:23.040 --> 2:42:29.040]  He's going to be dictating the terms of what news is being spoken of, what is coming out of Washington.
[2:42:29.040 --> 2:42:34.040]  Pretty soon, don't be surprised if that's negative press about Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[2:42:34.040 --> 2:42:39.040]  You've got Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz smashing servers, deleting emails.
[2:42:39.040 --> 2:42:49.040]  Wasserman Schultz had her hard drive seized from the FBI now, as well as the Awan brothers who were working with Democrats, including Hillary Clinton.
[2:42:49.040 --> 2:42:51.040]  They tried to smash those hard drives.
[2:42:51.040 --> 2:42:53.040]  They've now been seized by the FBI.
[2:42:53.040 --> 2:43:00.040]  And Awan brothers and Debbie Wasserman Schultz have threatened authorities who dare do their job.
[2:43:00.040 --> 2:43:13.040]  We have them cornered. That's why President Trump wants to bring in a new AG because he wants an AG that's going to get in the ring and put these scum where they belong in the corner and pummel them into submission.
[2:43:13.040 --> 2:43:17.040]  You know, we had Alex talking about how Roger Stone is coming up.
[2:43:17.040 --> 2:43:18.040]  And what is it now?
[2:43:18.040 --> 2:43:19.040]  About 15 minutes.
[2:43:19.040 --> 2:43:22.040]  He's going to be talking about what's going to be happening in the White House.
[2:43:22.040 --> 2:43:24.040]  There's a shake-up going on there.
[2:43:24.040 --> 2:43:28.040]  And there has to be a shake-up in the White House if we're going to do a shake-up in Washington, D.C.
[2:43:28.040 --> 2:43:30.040]  Yesterday we had this story come out from the AP.
[2:43:30.040 --> 2:43:33.040]  Trump speaks to advisors about firing sessions.
[2:43:33.040 --> 2:43:36.040]  Well, one of Trump's longest advisors is Roger Stone.
[2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:42.040]  He's going to be breaking down what's going to be coming up and possible replacements for Jeff Sessions.
[2:43:42.040 --> 2:43:44.040]  But this is what AP said yesterday.
[2:43:44.040 --> 2:43:50.040]  As he continues to rage against Sessions' decisions to accuse himself from all matters related to the Russia investigation,
[2:43:50.040 --> 2:43:59.040]  Trump has speculated aloud to allies in recent days about the potential consequences of firing sessions according to three people who've recently spoke to the president.
[2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:01.040]  So we're going to have the real information.
[2:44:01.040 --> 2:44:06.040]  We're going to have the scoop for AP when Roger Stone joins us in about 15 minutes.
[2:44:06.040 --> 2:44:11.040]  But I want to read for you something here from McClatchy, because McClatchy is not a pro-Trump.
[2:44:11.040 --> 2:44:14.040]  It's not a libertarian or conservative source.
[2:44:14.040 --> 2:44:16.040]  This is mainstream media.
[2:44:16.040 --> 2:44:23.040]  And here's what they point out. They said, Trump's messages with Sessions and senators are not pleased with that, okay?
[2:44:23.040 --> 2:44:25.040]  They don't want him messing with Sessions.
[2:44:25.040 --> 2:44:29.040]  They say, you don't pick a fight with one of the Senate's guys.
[2:44:29.040 --> 2:44:31.040]  One of the senators said, I don't understand it.
[2:44:31.040 --> 2:44:35.040]  There's no honorable person, more honorable person that I've met in my life than Jeff Sessions.
[2:44:35.040 --> 2:44:37.040]  It's not about whether or not he's an honorable person.
[2:44:37.040 --> 2:44:40.040]  It's not about whether or not he's right on some key issues.
[2:44:40.040 --> 2:44:47.040]  It's about the fact that he won't move forward with locking up criminals who need to be prosecuted.
[2:44:47.040 --> 2:44:52.040]  And they shouldn't get a pass simply because they're Washington insiders.
[2:44:52.040 --> 2:44:54.040]  And here's what they said in this McClatchy article.
[2:44:54.040 --> 2:45:00.040]  I think really distills it and shows the problem even though they don't acknowledge it as a problem.
[2:45:00.040 --> 2:45:06.040]  They said, Sessions spent 20 years in the Senate winning a reputation for affability and party loyalty.
[2:45:06.040 --> 2:45:14.040]  He understood and doggedly practiced the code of what's been called the world's most exclusive club.
[2:45:14.040 --> 2:45:24.040]  You can disagree, rather, without being disagreeable, but you protect the institution and its members.
[2:45:24.040 --> 2:45:31.040]  Is that why he won't go after the people who are criminals, the people who have violated the law,
[2:45:31.040 --> 2:45:33.040]  the people inside the FBI and others?
[2:45:33.040 --> 2:45:35.040]  It's an insider club.
[2:45:35.040 --> 2:45:38.040]  You can't have somebody with that mentality.
[2:45:38.040 --> 2:45:42.040]  Hopefully, Trump is going to pick someone who will not play by those rules.
[2:45:42.040 --> 2:45:43.040]  They go on the next session.
[2:45:43.040 --> 2:45:45.040]  They say, well, Trump clearly doesn't play by those rules.
[2:45:45.040 --> 2:45:48.040]  No, we don't want to see people playing by those rules.
[2:45:48.040 --> 2:45:51.040]  If somebody is breaking the law, you come after them.
[2:45:51.040 --> 2:46:00.040]  Instead of trying to break the 9th and 10th Amendment and to shut down the states that have had civil asset forfeiture reform
[2:46:00.040 --> 2:46:06.040]  to protect our right to private property, instead of coming after people who are using marijuana for medical purposes,
[2:46:06.040 --> 2:46:11.040]  he ought to be going after the criminals in Washington who are trying to subvert our election,
[2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:15.040]  trying to organize a coup against Donald Trump, and who ought to be prosecuted,
[2:46:15.040 --> 2:46:18.040]  even if they weren't coming after Donald Trump because they broke the law.
[2:46:18.040 --> 2:46:23.040]  And I think that Ty Cobb, the new lawyer appointed by Trump, is also evidence of that.
[2:46:23.040 --> 2:46:25.040]  And this is what you're saying, David.
[2:46:25.040 --> 2:46:26.040]  This is what Washington is saying.
[2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:29.040]  This is what you just broke down.
[2:46:29.040 --> 2:46:37.040]  The mindset of Congress, the mindset of DC, the mindset of the political establishment is us versus them.
[2:46:37.040 --> 2:46:38.040]  We have our mandate.
[2:46:38.040 --> 2:46:40.040]  We're in the club.
[2:46:40.040 --> 2:46:41.040]  We're on the hill.
[2:46:41.040 --> 2:46:42.040]  That's right.
[2:46:42.040 --> 2:46:43.040]  We dictate policy.
[2:46:43.040 --> 2:46:46.040]  We dictate the future, not the American people.
[2:46:46.040 --> 2:46:48.040]  Well, that's why we elected Trump.
[2:46:48.040 --> 2:46:50.040]  And those are not the type of people Trump wants to work with.
[2:46:50.040 --> 2:46:56.040]  So he's trying to get as many people in there that don't have that mentality of Washington DC establishment versus the people.
[2:46:56.040 --> 2:47:00.040]  And I think that that started some of the purge that we're beginning to see.
[2:47:00.040 --> 2:47:04.040]  More of the purge will hopefully happen in 2018 when we get to vote in the midterms.
[2:47:04.040 --> 2:47:13.040]  If you go back to the confirmation hearings for sessions, it was a big deal that Cory Booker criticized sessions.
[2:47:13.040 --> 2:47:17.040]  Whether you agree with what he had to say about them or not, they said, you don't do that.
[2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:23.040]  You don't criticize a fellow senator when he's being confirmed for cabinet position.
[2:47:23.040 --> 2:47:28.040]  It's an insider club. And even though you may be adamantly opposed to him,
[2:47:28.040 --> 2:47:33.040]  and even though Cory Booker may have been doing this and we know he was doing it because he wants to run for president.
[2:47:33.040 --> 2:47:35.040]  So it was a political opportunity.
[2:47:35.040 --> 2:47:37.040]  But they were saying, no, no, no, this is an inside.
[2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:39.040]  And this is exactly what McClatchy said.
[2:47:39.040 --> 2:47:40.040]  They were right about this.
[2:47:40.040 --> 2:47:41.040]  It is an inside club.
[2:47:41.040 --> 2:47:45.040]  It's an institution that you don't criticize because you're part of it.
[2:47:45.040 --> 2:47:46.040]  Remember George Carlin?
[2:47:46.040 --> 2:47:48.040]  It's a club and you're not a member.
[2:47:48.040 --> 2:47:55.040]  Okay, well, he is a member of the club and that's why he won't go after the members who break the rules that are supposed to apply to all of us.
[2:47:55.040 --> 2:48:00.040]  So you saw the headline on Washington Post saying, Scare Mucci says he's going to fire everybody.
[2:48:00.040 --> 2:48:01.040]  Breitbart just published this.
[2:48:01.040 --> 2:48:05.040]  Scare Mucci terminates suspected leaker Michael Short from the White House.
[2:48:05.040 --> 2:48:09.040]  And I want you guys to pull up that other Washington Post or that you had up a second ago.
[2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:13.040]  The headline was something Trump leaves people whirling in the wind.
[2:48:13.040 --> 2:48:14.040]  Pull up that.
[2:48:14.040 --> 2:48:15.040]  Twisting in the wind.
[2:48:15.040 --> 2:48:16.040]  Twisting in the wind.
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:17.040]  I love this.
[2:48:17.040 --> 2:48:21.040]  Trump leaves Session twisting in the wind while berating him publicly.
[2:48:21.040 --> 2:48:22.040]  No, folks, here's the truth.
[2:48:22.040 --> 2:48:23.040]  Here's the truth.
[2:48:23.040 --> 2:48:24.040]  Gotta make it sound like a lynching.
[2:48:24.040 --> 2:48:25.040]  Here's the truth.
[2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:31.040]  President Trump is probably talking to Sessions and Session knows what's going on and Trump is saying, look, I gotta trade ya.
[2:48:31.040 --> 2:48:32.040]  I need a pitcher.
[2:48:32.040 --> 2:48:33.040]  You're a power hitter.
[2:48:33.040 --> 2:48:34.040]  I gotta trade ya.
[2:48:34.040 --> 2:48:35.040]  I gotta bring someone else in.
[2:48:35.040 --> 2:48:43.040]  So they probably already know that this is going on and everything that you're seeing in public is President Trump twisting the Washington Post by the wind.
[2:48:43.040 --> 2:48:45.040]  That's what's going on.
[2:48:45.040 --> 2:48:49.040]  So now, Scaramucci is going to purge the White House of the Leakers.
[2:48:49.040 --> 2:48:53.040]  Trump is the one dictating the news now by what he's saying on Twitter.
[2:48:53.040 --> 2:48:56.040]  It's the Washington Post that's twisting in the wind.
[2:48:56.040 --> 2:48:58.040]  It's the Amazon Post.
[2:48:58.040 --> 2:48:59.040]  It's the New York Times.
[2:48:59.040 --> 2:49:03.040]  It's the fake news that's trying to attack Trump, the CNNs, the MSNBCs.
[2:49:03.040 --> 2:49:05.040]  They're the ones twisting in the wind.
[2:49:05.040 --> 2:49:08.040]  They're the ones that can't figure out what's going on.
[2:49:08.040 --> 2:49:10.040]  They're the ones that can't be proven right.
[2:49:10.040 --> 2:49:12.040]  They're the ones that keep putting out these talking points.
[2:49:12.040 --> 2:49:13.040]  Trump Russia.
[2:49:13.040 --> 2:49:14.040]  Trump this.
[2:49:14.040 --> 2:49:16.040]  Trump that falls on deaf ears.
[2:49:16.040 --> 2:49:20.040]  So they're the ones twisting in the wind, not the Trump administration.
[2:49:20.040 --> 2:49:23.040]  And I think that we're finally starting to see this move.
[2:49:23.040 --> 2:49:25.040]  We're starting to see this momentum.
[2:49:25.040 --> 2:49:26.040]  Trump taking the gloves off.
[2:49:26.040 --> 2:49:28.040]  The Democrats are cornered.
[2:49:28.040 --> 2:49:31.040]  He's now got to put the right people in place to bring these people to justice, David.
[2:49:31.040 --> 2:49:34.040]  And that might not happen quick, but I think we're starting to see the movement.
[2:49:34.040 --> 2:49:39.040]  You know, we talk about the Washington Post or the Amazon Washington Post.
[2:49:39.040 --> 2:49:41.040]  We call them the Amazon Post or whatever.
[2:49:41.040 --> 2:49:43.040]  Maybe they're the CIA Post.
[2:49:43.040 --> 2:49:45.040]  We've talked about the connection.
[2:49:45.040 --> 2:49:47.040]  The $600 million contract.
[2:49:47.040 --> 2:49:52.040]  We're talking about that and how the leaks seem to always originate with the Washington Post.
[2:49:52.040 --> 2:49:56.040]  Maybe they should change the headline, the sub-headline, which is kind of strange.
[2:49:56.040 --> 2:50:00.040]  You know, Washington Post democracy dies in the dark state.
[2:50:00.040 --> 2:50:02.040]  Maybe that's really what they should have there.
[2:50:02.040 --> 2:50:04.040]  They should say we killed democracy.
[2:50:04.040 --> 2:50:05.040]  We killed journalism.
[2:50:05.040 --> 2:50:06.040]  Washington Post.
[2:50:06.040 --> 2:50:10.040]  Let's talk about this Michael Short firing because Scaramucci got rid of this guy.
[2:50:10.040 --> 2:50:13.040]  This is somebody who was an ally of Ryan's previous.
[2:50:13.040 --> 2:50:16.040]  And he said, I've not been involved in any leaks.
[2:50:16.040 --> 2:50:18.040]  Allegations I've leaked anything are demonstrably false.
[2:50:18.040 --> 2:50:23.040]  However, let's talk about the fact that he was where this guy came from.
[2:50:23.040 --> 2:50:26.040]  And this is a story that was reported by Politico.
[2:50:26.040 --> 2:50:29.040]  They say he was closely aligned with Press Secretary Sean Spicer,
[2:50:29.040 --> 2:50:32.040]  who resigned on Friday after Scaramucci was appointed to the communications role.
[2:50:32.040 --> 2:50:35.040]  He was scorned by many of his colleagues.
[2:50:35.040 --> 2:50:42.040]  Why? Because he quit the Trump campaign only to rejoin as a White House staffer because of previous.
[2:50:42.040 --> 2:50:44.040]  They said in a story told by campaign staffers,
[2:50:44.040 --> 2:50:48.040]  they arrived at Trump Tower one morning months before the election to find his laptop open saying,
[2:50:48.040 --> 2:50:51.040]  I resigned and he just left.
[2:50:51.040 --> 2:50:56.040]  And then they said the next time they saw him as was as a campaign with his fellow campaign staffers
[2:50:56.040 --> 2:51:01.040]  was in January when previous had brought him in as their supervisor.
[2:51:01.040 --> 2:51:04.040]  This is the problem, folks. This is what's being addressed.
[2:51:04.040 --> 2:51:06.040]  Stay with us. Roger Stone in 10 minutes.
[2:51:34.040 --> 2:51:38.040]  Why not put your money up the drain for a change?
[2:52:05.040 --> 2:52:09.040]  Today I'm excited to announce the new limited shipment of DNA Forces Finally Arrived,
[2:52:09.040 --> 2:52:11.040]  the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[2:52:11.040 --> 2:52:17.040]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for auto-ship to receive out-of-stock products at DNA Force.
[2:52:17.040 --> 2:52:20.040]  And we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[2:52:20.040 --> 2:52:23.040]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game changer like DNA Force,
[2:52:23.040 --> 2:52:27.040]  we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[2:52:27.040 --> 2:52:32.040]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10,
[2:52:32.040 --> 2:52:36.040]  systematic enzymes, NAR-lipolic acid, BIO-PQQ and many others.
[2:52:36.040 --> 2:52:41.040]  BIO-PQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[2:52:41.040 --> 2:52:45.040]  And just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[2:52:45.040 --> 2:52:48.040]  Visit m4slife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[2:52:48.040 --> 2:52:53.040]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA Force an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars
[2:52:53.040 --> 2:52:56.040]  through our third party certified review agency Power Review.

[2:53:01.040 --> 2:53:03.040]  That's m4slife.com.
[2:53:31.040 --> 2:53:33.040]  What?
[2:54:01.040 --> 2:54:26.040]  You can do anything. You can be anything you want to be.
[2:54:26.040 --> 2:54:31.040]  But in order to succeed, you must find out what you love to do.
[2:54:31.040 --> 2:54:36.040]  You have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you.
[2:54:36.040 --> 2:54:38.040]  If you don't, I love you too.
[2:54:38.040 --> 2:54:43.040]  This is President Trump speaking to 40,000 Boy Scouts of America.
[2:54:43.040 --> 2:54:48.040]  Hey, what am I going to do? He sounds like a nice person.
[2:54:48.040 --> 2:54:53.040]  He, he, he, he. Thank you. I do, I do love you.
[2:54:53.040 --> 2:55:08.040]  I do love you.
[2:55:08.040 --> 2:55:12.040]  Never seen this type of energy for a politician in years, folks, since Reagan.
[2:55:12.040 --> 2:55:14.040]  And even this is greater, probably.
[2:55:14.040 --> 2:55:18.040]  Yeah, we never saw 20,000 people show up to hear Reagan speak.
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:29.040]  Question. Did President Obama ever come to a jamboree?
[2:55:29.040 --> 2:55:34.040]  Just a regular event for Trump, you know, 20,000, 40,000 people. No big deal.
[2:55:34.040 --> 2:55:39.040]  Look at all those Russians. The Boy Scouts of Russia.
[2:55:39.040 --> 2:55:47.040]  And we'll be back. We'll be back. The answer is no, but we'll be back.
[2:55:47.040 --> 2:55:52.040]  So President Trump is popular, folks. I'm telling you, that freaks the establishment out
[2:55:52.040 --> 2:55:56.040]  that the youth loves President Trump and would boo Barack Obama.
[2:55:56.040 --> 2:55:57.040]  But it's amazing, you know.
[2:55:57.040 --> 2:56:00.040]  Yeah, they called it a, it looked like a Hitler youth rally.
[2:56:00.040 --> 2:56:02.040]  Yeah, they're saying it was a white supremacy rally.
[2:56:02.040 --> 2:56:05.040]  It's a bunch of Boy Scouts of America. These people are sick.
[2:56:05.040 --> 2:56:09.040]  But it's funny because we went from Barack Obama saying, you didn't build that.
[2:56:09.040 --> 2:56:15.040]  You didn't build that business to President Trump saying, you can build and be anything that you want to be.
[2:56:15.040 --> 2:56:20.040]  So that's a great difference right there between President Trump and President Obama.
[2:56:20.040 --> 2:56:27.040]  You've got the S&P hitting record highs today. Bloomberg article talking about unemployment near a 16-year low.
[2:56:27.040 --> 2:56:34.040]  Job market. Confidence is up. America's labor market is the best it's been since before Obama.
[2:56:34.040 --> 2:56:37.040]  Shocker there. You've got a lot of jobs being created.
[2:56:37.040 --> 2:56:42.040]  So all of that is good news, and that's why the future is excited for President Trump and what he might bring.
[2:56:42.040 --> 2:56:45.040]  And we're excited for the future here at infowars.com.
[2:56:45.040 --> 2:56:49.040]  And that's because you have funded us at infowarsstore.com.
[2:56:49.040 --> 2:56:55.040]  And because of that, we are running one of our biggest specials ever, the last week of July specials.
[2:56:55.040 --> 2:56:58.040]  We've got specials up to 66% off.

[2:57:01.040 --> 2:57:03.040]  Introductory products like TrueWay protein.
[2:57:03.040 --> 2:57:07.040]  That comes to you at 25% off right out of the gates.
[2:57:07.040 --> 2:57:12.040]  We've got a new package. This is the oral health care package.
[2:57:12.040 --> 2:57:17.040]  Silver bullet, super blue toothpaste, and the power toothbrush.
[2:57:17.040 --> 2:57:23.040]  50% off. You can get that entire package for under $35.
[2:57:23.040 --> 2:57:28.040]  That's silver bullet, super blue toothpaste, and our power toothbrush.
[2:57:28.040 --> 2:57:33.040]  That's the super silver special, the oral care package for under $35 right now.
[2:57:33.040 --> 2:57:39.040]  This is part of the last week of July specials, and we are running store-wide free shipping.
[2:57:39.040 --> 2:57:42.040]  So it doesn't matter how much. It doesn't matter what you purchase.
[2:57:42.040 --> 2:57:52.040]  You can get the biggest product, the smallest product, 10 items, one item, 100 item, and it's all free shipping store-wide.
[2:57:52.040 --> 2:57:59.040]  Well, we're about to have Roger Stone joining us at 8 after in the next hour, and he's going to be breaking the big news.
[2:57:59.040 --> 2:58:05.040]  But right now, David, I think that it's the Democrats that are being caught up in a whirlwind.
[2:58:05.040 --> 2:58:12.040]  It's the left that doesn't really know what's hit them, and they're trying to act like that's how the Republicans are, the right is, and how Trump is.
[2:58:12.040 --> 2:58:17.040]  That's just not the case. These people are living in denial. They've been living in denial for a long time, David.
[2:58:17.040 --> 2:58:24.040]  It's going to be interesting to see what Roger has to say, because I think we've seen some of the people that President Trump has picked.
[2:58:24.040 --> 2:58:30.040]  They've tried to offer a gesture to people, will you work with me? And I think what we're seeing now at this point in the Trump administration says,
[2:58:30.040 --> 2:58:35.040]  I realize these people are not going to work with me. They're going to continue to work against me. I'm going to get rid of them.
[2:58:35.040 --> 2:58:37.040]  Roger Stone is going to break that down when you come back.
[2:58:37.040 --> 2:58:42.040]  And Lee Strandhand broke the Ukrainian ties to Clinton. Tomorrow, there will be a hearing, and Chuck Grassley will be there.
[2:58:42.040 --> 2:58:56.040]  He's going to raise attention to that, too. We'll be right back.
[2:59:13.040 --> 2:59:19.040]  With a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[2:59:19.040 --> 2:59:27.040]  In the history of M4's lives, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, SuperMail Vitality, and so many others.
[2:59:27.040 --> 2:59:37.040]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[2:59:37.040 --> 2:59:46.040]  And this part is most important. The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[2:59:46.040 --> 2:59:51.040]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure, and rest-secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the info war.
[2:59:51.040 --> 3:00:07.040]  That's infowarswives.com and vitamin mineral fusion. Take action now before...
[3:00:22.040 --> 3:00:25.040]  Russia, Russia, Russia! Trump, Trump, Trump!
[3:00:25.040 --> 3:00:30.040]  No, it's going to end up being Ukraine and Hillary Clinton. Mark my words on that.
[3:00:30.040 --> 3:00:36.040]  We had Lee Strandhand breaking that down earlier on the broadcast, as well as the George Soros involvements with that.
[3:00:36.040 --> 3:00:47.040]  But tomorrow, the Judiciary Committee will convene a hearing to examine enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and attempts to influence U.S. elections.
[3:00:47.040 --> 3:00:51.040]  This is coming from Senator Chuck Grassley's official website.
[3:00:51.040 --> 3:00:55.040]  Grassley raises further concerns over foreign agent registration.
[3:00:55.040 --> 3:01:00.040]  Report alleges DNC consultant involved in presidential election worked with Ukraine.
[3:01:00.040 --> 3:01:03.040]  He published that yesterday. The hearing will be tomorrow.
[3:01:03.040 --> 3:01:07.040]  You know that Chuck Grassley is going to raise awareness of this, David.
[3:01:07.040 --> 3:01:14.040]  He's been raising awareness. In fact, I was saying outside the break, if we just had 50 senators like Chuck Grassley, this country would be a lot better off.
[3:01:14.040 --> 3:01:18.040]  This story is getting traction now about what's happening with Ukraine.
[3:01:18.040 --> 3:01:24.040]  We had Trump tweet this out today, immediately got pushed back against that by Reuters.
[3:01:24.040 --> 3:01:27.040]  But we had Lee Strandhand on. He's been talking about this a very long time.
[3:01:27.040 --> 3:01:32.040]  Politico had the story out in January, but now it is gradually beginning to get traction.
[3:01:32.040 --> 3:01:41.040]  But it's going to explode, especially if we have a change in Attorney General and we get somebody who is going to come after these criminals
[3:01:41.040 --> 3:01:45.040]  and really, truly investigate the hard evidences here.
[3:01:45.040 --> 3:01:52.040]  And again, if you didn't see that interview with Lee Strandhand, we're going to post this article as well as the interview embedded in that at infowars.com.
[3:01:52.040 --> 3:02:02.040]  A very important story breaking down how a serial bomber gets out, joins forces, becomes a money bag man for the DNC,
[3:02:02.040 --> 3:02:07.040]  bringing in these foreign agents who are then working to subvert our election.
[3:02:07.040 --> 3:02:14.040]  That's how hardcore the evidence is. The Democrats have always been guilty of the crimes that they project onto others.
[3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:18.040]  That's what this Russian situation is. I've always said it's a red herring.
[3:02:18.040 --> 3:02:25.040]  It is something that you use to drag across the trail to throw the foxhounds off of what the real crime is.
[3:02:25.040 --> 3:02:29.040]  And now it looks like Trump is getting serious about going after these people saying,
[3:02:29.040 --> 3:02:36.040]  hey, Attorney General Sessions, if you're not going to expose what happened with Ukraine and Hillary Clinton, I'll get somebody who will.
[3:02:36.040 --> 3:02:41.040]  And then he absolutely has to do it, or they're going to take him down, they're going to paralyze the regime.
[3:02:41.040 --> 3:02:46.040]  And tonight on the Nightly News, we're going to talk about the Russian sanctions that are now being pushed out.
[3:02:46.040 --> 3:02:51.040]  It's very important to understand how they're going to box President Trump into a corner,
[3:02:51.040 --> 3:02:58.040]  but even more importantly, create a world war as far as trade goes, because the EU is going to be affected by this.
[3:02:58.040 --> 3:03:05.040]  The EU is saying, if you enact these Russian sanctions, we're going to enact retaliatory trade sanctions against the US,
[3:03:05.040 --> 3:03:10.040]  because we're talking about shutting down their supply of gas that they buy from the Russians.
[3:03:10.040 --> 3:03:14.040]  So this is a very complicated situation. They're trying to enact these sanctions.
[3:03:14.040 --> 3:03:19.040]  They're offering the carrot to the Republicans saying, hey, we can overturn this Iranian thing.
[3:03:19.040 --> 3:03:26.040]  There's a better way to do that without boxing Trump into this and shutting down his ability to remove sanctions against anyone.
[3:03:26.040 --> 3:03:31.040]  So you've got Project Veritas exposing the Democrat Party for terroristic behavior,
[3:03:31.040 --> 3:03:36.040]  and now you've got Democrats colluding with a serial bomb maker, a terrorist.
[3:03:36.040 --> 3:03:40.040]  So there you go. But Trump is the bad guy, folks. It's all Trump's fault.
[3:03:40.040 --> 3:03:44.040]  Look at Trump. Look at Russia. Look over here. No.
[3:03:44.040 --> 3:03:47.040]  I'm telling you, it was the weirdest thing for me, David.
[3:03:47.040 --> 3:03:53.040]  On Sunday night, I was sitting there and I was thinking about what Trump can do,
[3:03:53.040 --> 3:03:59.040]  what the Trump administration can do to change the tide and to move things in the opposite direction,
[3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:02.040]  instead of against him, but against his opponents.
[3:04:02.040 --> 3:04:09.040]  And I was thinking what Trump needs is a young New York attorney who wants to make a name for himself and who has balls of steel.
[3:04:09.040 --> 3:04:12.040]  And I was thinking it was going to have to be a young guy who wanted to make a name for himself.
[3:04:12.040 --> 3:04:14.040]  But then Ty Cobb came around.
[3:04:14.040 --> 3:04:18.040]  Ty Cobb already made a name for himself. So Ty Cobb's already got the name.
[3:04:18.040 --> 3:04:23.040]  But then he even said in himself, he said, I have balls of steel. That's what Trump needs.
[3:04:23.040 --> 3:04:30.040]  Trump needs someone to put it all on the line and say, you know what, this is going to be ugly, but I'm going into the briar patch with you, Donald.
[3:04:30.040 --> 3:04:35.040]  And again, as we saw from Lukacschi, they laid it out. They said, look, Jeff Sessions has been around a long time.
[3:04:35.040 --> 3:04:42.040]  He's very congenial. His colleagues, he's not going to criticize them. He's part of that club, but we're not in.
[3:04:42.040 --> 3:04:49.040]  And people that are in that club, just like James Comey said about Hillary Clinton, well, you try this at home,
[3:04:49.040 --> 3:04:54.040]  but we're not going to come after Hillary Clinton. We'll take the guy who is a sailor on a sub.
[3:04:54.040 --> 3:04:59.040]  We'll lock him up for confidential pictures, but not her for above top secrets.
[3:04:59.040 --> 3:05:04.040]  Stay with us. Roger Stone is going to have breaking information about the shakeup at the White House.
[3:05:04.040 --> 3:05:06.040]  He's been an advisor for a long time to Trump.
[3:05:06.040 --> 3:05:07.040]  Think about it.
[3:05:07.040 --> 3:05:10.040]  The Constitutional Convention of 1787 was held strict secrecy.
[3:05:10.040 --> 3:05:16.040]  And at the end of the proceeding, citizens gathered outside Independence Hall to learn what had been produced behind closed doors.
[3:05:16.040 --> 3:05:20.040]  Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall. A lady asked him, well, doctor, what have we got?
[3:05:20.040 --> 3:05:24.040]  A republic or a monarchy? To which he responded, a republic, if you can keep it.
[3:05:24.040 --> 3:05:29.040]  But today, not only have we lost a republic, but most people don't even know what a republic even is.
[3:05:29.040 --> 3:05:32.040]  For one thing, a republic is not a democracy.
[3:05:32.040 --> 3:05:38.040]  A republic operates under the rule of law, which protects individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority.
[3:05:38.040 --> 3:05:43.040]  Under a republic, the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws, regardless of political power or lack thereof.
[3:05:43.040 --> 3:05:47.040]  A democracy, on the other hand, only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims of the public.
[3:05:47.040 --> 3:05:54.040]  In a democracy, the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have no protection against the unlimited power of the majority.
[3:05:54.040 --> 3:05:56.040]  It is a case of majority over man.
[3:05:56.040 --> 3:06:00.040]  In other words, under democracy, two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner.
[3:06:00.040 --> 3:06:03.040]  But under a republic, a sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.
[3:06:03.040 --> 3:06:14.040]  This is Kit Daniels with Infowars.com.
[3:06:33.040 --> 3:06:58.040]  Kaveman is back at the Infowars store.
[3:06:58.040 --> 3:07:10.040]  A new shipment of bio-truth selenium is now available at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:07:10.040 --> 3:07:12.040]  We've been sold out for months.

[3:07:17.040 --> 3:07:21.040]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the pharmaceutical industry to its core.

[3:07:26.040 --> 3:07:31.040]  Bio-truth selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[3:07:31.040 --> 3:07:34.040]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[3:07:34.040 --> 3:07:38.040]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight,
[3:07:38.040 --> 3:07:43.040]  bio-truth selenium is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine,
[3:07:43.040 --> 3:07:46.040]  as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.

[3:08:02.040 --> 3:08:06.040]  This is the time to support Infowars. That's InfowarsLife.com.
[3:08:12.040 --> 3:08:16.040]  I follow Americans. Let me make this perfectly clear.
[3:08:16.040 --> 3:08:21.040]  You're listening to Roger Stone on Infowars.
[3:08:25.040 --> 3:08:34.040]  Thank you. I'm Roger Stone, and I'm with you for a special exclusive report here on Infowars.
[3:08:34.040 --> 3:08:41.040]  It's very important to understand what's happening in Washington regarding both Attorney General Sessions,
[3:08:41.040 --> 3:08:51.040]  the possible shakeup at the White House, and what is clearly a decision by President Trump to turn the tables and go on offense.
[3:08:51.040 --> 3:09:01.040]  It's important to understand, before we get into the session's matter, that the FISA court declaration at the end of last year
[3:09:01.040 --> 3:09:12.040]  nails President Barack Obama and his entire front line on the Intel community for the illegal, unconstitutional,
[3:09:12.040 --> 3:09:21.040]  willful surveillance of tens of thousands of Americans for specifically political reasons.
[3:09:21.040 --> 3:09:26.040]  Coupling that with the massive scandals at the Clinton Foundation,
[3:09:26.040 --> 3:09:32.040]  Donald Trump has two major leverage points on his opponents.
[3:09:32.040 --> 3:09:41.040]  He can, never mind the Russian collusion delusion, turn the table on his tormentors.
[3:09:41.040 --> 3:09:51.040]  And his disappointment in Jeff Sessions is based on Sessions' either inability or unwillingness to do either.
[3:09:51.040 --> 3:10:01.040]  Now comes word from my sources that the President has decided to replace Mr. Sessions,
[3:10:01.040 --> 3:10:11.040]  but the leading candidate for that position, at least as of this moment, is CIA Director Richard Pompeo.
[3:10:11.040 --> 3:10:15.040]  This is troubling for a number of reasons.
[3:10:15.040 --> 3:10:22.040]  First of all, Pompeo, who was a supporter of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks during the election,
[3:10:22.040 --> 3:10:26.040]  has become a captive of the mandarins at the CIA.
[3:10:26.040 --> 3:10:37.040]  Only a month ago, repeating the canard that there was some proof that WikiLeaks and Assange are cutouts for the Russians.
[3:10:37.040 --> 3:10:39.040]  This is false.
[3:10:39.040 --> 3:10:46.040]  And then there is even more troubling Pompeo's speech to the Aspen Institute,
[3:10:46.040 --> 3:10:53.040]  widely praised by John Brennan, the CIA Director under Barack Obama,
[3:10:53.040 --> 3:10:59.040]  in which he parroted, once again, the anti-Russian line.
[3:10:59.040 --> 3:11:08.040]  In view of the incredible progress the President is making on Syria by engaging a dialogue with the Russians,
[3:11:08.040 --> 3:11:19.040]  the appointment of a deep stator like Pompeo at justice would seem to preclude the prosecutions of the Obama Intelligence Community,
[3:11:19.040 --> 3:11:23.040]  including, of course, the CIA.
[3:11:23.040 --> 3:11:27.040]  You heard it all first, here at Info Awards.
[3:11:27.040 --> 3:11:40.040]  Additionally, there is much speculation after the firing of Sean Spicer about the fate of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.
[3:11:40.040 --> 3:11:52.040]  First of all, the President deserves kudos, in my opinion, for the appointment of Sarah Huckabee Sanders as his Chief Spokeswoman and the White House Press Secretary.
[3:11:52.040 --> 3:11:55.040]  This is a strong appointment.
[3:11:55.040 --> 3:12:01.040]  She's been doing a much better job defending the President and speaking on his behalf than Spicer,
[3:12:01.040 --> 3:12:05.040]  and in my view, she well deserves the job.
[3:12:05.040 --> 3:12:09.040]  So congratulations to Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[3:12:09.040 --> 3:12:20.040]  In the meantime, however, it appears that there is a three-way decision that the President has before him regarding the White House Chief of Staff.
[3:12:20.040 --> 3:12:32.040]  On this list are David Urban, a decorated veteran, a former Chief of Staff on Capitol Hill, the U.S. Senator Arlen Specter.
[3:12:32.040 --> 3:12:42.040]  But nonetheless, a hardline Trump loyalist who ran the nuts and bolts campaign on the ground in Pennsylvania.
[3:12:42.040 --> 3:12:51.040]  Someone the President knows well, and someone who has both administrative skills and political skills.
[3:12:51.040 --> 3:13:03.040]  Urban was the administrative assistant to perhaps the meanest, toughest, smartest, and most difficult member of the U.S. Senate, Arlen Specter.
[3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:13.040]  This does not in any way reflect the politics of Urban himself, who is a solid Trumpite from the beginning,
[3:13:13.040 --> 3:13:18.040]  and in my view, responsible for the historical win in Pennsylvania.
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:24.040]  Also, unbelievably in the running is Dina Habib Howell.
[3:13:24.040 --> 3:13:40.040]  She is a former member of the George W. Bush White House staff, a certified globalist, her best friends, Valerie Jarrett, also a Huma Abedin,
[3:13:40.040 --> 3:13:44.040]  and then of course, Kandi Rice.
[3:13:44.040 --> 3:13:54.040]  She was very successful in squeezing Rick Grinnell, another key Trump supporter, out of the position of NATO ambassador,
[3:13:54.040 --> 3:14:08.040]  delivering that to former Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a certified Trump hater, a never-Trumper who had nothing good to say about candidate Trump during the election.
[3:14:08.040 --> 3:14:20.040]  And then also, a wild card, and you'll hearing this first at InfoWars, General John Kelly, currently the head of Homeland Security,
[3:14:20.040 --> 3:14:25.040]  is also in contention for the position of White House Chief of Staff.
[3:14:25.040 --> 3:14:33.040]  Researching Kelly, the first thing that pops up, is his status as an unreconstructed drug warrior,
[3:14:33.040 --> 3:14:46.040]  someone who agrees with Jeff Sessions on the question of refiring up the failed expensive and I think proven disaster that was the war on drugs
[3:14:46.040 --> 3:14:50.040]  first initiated by my mentor, Richard Nixon.
[3:14:50.040 --> 3:15:01.040]  It is hard to determine with Kelly's military background whether he is in fact a globalist, and we're researching that.
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:09.040]  But in the meantime, it's very important that the President understand that his next administrative assistant, his next Chief of Staff,
[3:15:09.040 --> 3:15:16.040]  pardon me, should be someone with both administrative skills, but also political skills.
[3:15:16.040 --> 3:15:27.040]  General Kelly, without any question, has administrative skills, but that does not speak to his understanding of the core Trump constituency that won the election
[3:15:27.040 --> 3:15:39.040]  and is sustaining the President now as he tries to govern in the face of a mainstream media onslaught that is unrelenting.
[3:15:39.040 --> 3:15:46.040]  So there you have it, Urban, Abib Powell, or General John Kelly.
[3:15:46.040 --> 3:15:51.040]  This is, again, an InfoWars exclusive.
[3:15:51.040 --> 3:16:04.040]  We are also, I think, able to say that Anthony Scaramucci has already brought a breath of fresh air as the White House Communications Director.
[3:16:04.040 --> 3:16:09.040]  The leakers are now recoiling and trying to hide.
[3:16:09.040 --> 3:16:19.040]  Scaramucci made it very clear that he would root out and fire those who continue to leak to the President's detriment.
[3:16:19.040 --> 3:16:23.040]  But what of the leaking going on in the intelligence community?
[3:16:23.040 --> 3:16:36.040]  Only last week, yet again, the intelligence community leaked a document that showed Russian Ambassador Kizlak telling his superiors that when he met with Jeff Sessions,
[3:16:36.040 --> 3:16:40.040]  they did discuss the presidential campaign.
[3:16:40.040 --> 3:16:47.040]  This is contrary to what Sessions has said publicly and under oath.
[3:16:47.040 --> 3:16:52.040]  And frankly, I think it is the last straw for Mr. Sessions.
[3:16:52.040 --> 3:16:56.040]  Unfortunately, the Attorney General has made several mistakes.
[3:16:56.040 --> 3:17:06.040]  One is his failure to prosecute Obama, Ben Rhodes, Susan Rice, Valerie Jarrett, Admiral Rogers, and yes, John Brennan,
[3:17:06.040 --> 3:17:12.040]  for the willful, unconstitutional surveillance of tens of thousands of Americans,
[3:17:12.040 --> 3:17:22.040]  and the use of that surveillance information for political purposes, ten times worse than anything that happened during Watergate.
[3:17:22.040 --> 3:17:36.040]  Secondarily, has been his aforementioned failure to prosecute Bill and Hillary Clinton on the scam that was the Clinton Foundation.
[3:17:36.040 --> 3:17:42.040]  When the Clinton Foundation was never a charity, it was a slush fund for grifters.
[3:17:42.040 --> 3:17:53.040]  One wonders how Bill and Hillary paid for Chelsea's $6 million wedding utilizing Clinton Foundation funds.
[3:17:53.040 --> 3:18:05.040]  Also problematic for Jeff Sessions is his obsession with busting people for using medicinal marijuana in the 29 states where it is legal.
[3:18:05.040 --> 3:18:16.040]  It is entirely contrary to what candidate Donald Trump assured the millions of Americans currently using marijuana for medicinal purposes during the campaign.
[3:18:16.040 --> 3:18:28.040]  And then there is Jeff Sessions' comments in Nevada only two weeks ago, where he commented on the Bundy case currently going to trial in a Nevada courtroom,
[3:18:28.040 --> 3:18:36.040]  thus tainting the jury and potentially creating a motion for mistrial.
[3:18:36.040 --> 3:18:46.040]  Some of you may remember when President Richard Nixon in the middle of Charles Manson's trial for mass murder said Manson is guilty, we know it,
[3:18:46.040 --> 3:18:50.040]  and the liberals in the media went insane.
[3:18:50.040 --> 3:18:52.040]  Why is this different?
[3:18:52.040 --> 3:19:05.040]  Why would eternally general Sessions, an officer of the court, not understand that the comments praising the prosecution for the pursuit of the Bundy's
[3:19:05.040 --> 3:19:10.040]  taint that trial and is completely and totally inappropriate.
[3:19:10.040 --> 3:19:17.040]  I'll be back just a moment.
[3:19:17.040 --> 3:19:23.040]  All right, that's Roger Stone. As you heard him say at the very beginning, Trump is going to go on offense.
[3:19:23.040 --> 3:19:29.040]  That's something that Roger Stone and Alex Jones said from the very first moment of the Trump administration.
[3:19:29.040 --> 3:19:31.040]  They said, you're going to have to go on offense.
[3:19:31.040 --> 3:19:34.040]  If you don't go on offense, they're going to be attacking you.
[3:19:34.040 --> 3:19:39.040]  And that's what we have seen for the last six months, a very important turn of events.
[3:19:39.040 --> 3:19:47.040]  Also, a good name, David Urban, for Chief of Staff, but some very, very troubling names.
[3:19:47.040 --> 3:19:55.040]  We see Dina Habib Goldman Sachs Powell being offered forward as a possible candidate for Chief of Staff, very concerning.
[3:19:55.040 --> 3:20:05.040]  So stay with us. We'll be right back with more from Roger Stone.
[3:20:05.040 --> 3:20:13.040]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clawed arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[3:20:13.040 --> 3:20:23.040]  But the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[3:20:23.040 --> 3:20:29.040]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[3:20:29.040 --> 3:20:33.040]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[3:20:33.040 --> 3:20:37.040]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.

[3:20:39.040 --> 3:20:47.040]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[3:24:09.040 --> 3:24:17.040]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[3:24:17.040 --> 3:24:21.040]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[3:24:21.040 --> 3:24:26.040]  Well, I thought that they were going to put a bunch of attention on this Obamacare repeal vote
[3:24:26.040 --> 3:24:30.040]  and then try to steal attention away from anything else with it. It looks like that's the case.
[3:24:30.040 --> 3:24:34.040]  They're now saying they think they have the votes in the Senate. I'm not celebrating that until I see it.
[3:24:34.040 --> 3:24:40.040]  John McCain returns to the floor, bashes talk radio right back to prime form for John McCain.
[3:24:40.040 --> 3:24:44.040]  Goes right to bashing talk radio. Thanks for that, John McCain.
[3:24:44.040 --> 3:24:50.040]  Bernie Sanders says he doesn't want to have to call parents because children are going to die from the repeal of Obamacare.
[3:24:50.040 --> 3:24:53.040]  Well, Bernie Sanders, you're not going to call anyone. You're a total fraud anyway.
[3:24:53.040 --> 3:24:57.040]  And we already know what government healthcare does. It kills. Just ask Charlie Gard.
[3:24:57.040 --> 3:25:03.040]  But the big news is, right now it looks like Senator Sessions is going to be on his way out the door.
[3:25:03.040 --> 3:25:08.040]  Roger Stone broke that. He had the breaking news as well as the people that might be being considered to replace
[3:25:08.040 --> 3:25:13.040]  the attorney general labeled as beleaguered from President Trump.
[3:25:13.040 --> 3:25:19.040]  Roger, I'd like to ask you this. The Washington Post ran the headline that, I forget exactly who it was,
[3:25:19.040 --> 3:25:24.040]  was spinning around in a whirlwind. I think it was Sessions spinning in a whirlwind.
[3:25:24.040 --> 3:25:29.040]  Sessions spinning in a whirlwind created by Trump. I think that Sessions and Trump are probably in communications
[3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:34.040]  and Sessions knows what's going on. I'd like your insight on that as well as who is really in the whirlwind here.
[3:25:34.040 --> 3:25:38.040]  Is it Sessions or is it the liberal media?
[3:25:38.040 --> 3:25:45.040]  Well, I think the president is genuinely disappointed in Jeff Sessions as I am. I think we all should be.
[3:25:45.040 --> 3:25:51.040]  He came to office with a terrific reputation. He's been a real leader in the Senate on immigration issues.
[3:25:51.040 --> 3:25:56.040]  But on the key points here, he's completely MIA.
[3:25:56.040 --> 3:26:04.040]  He has declined. As you know, he recused himself, I think unnecessarily, on Russia although perhaps he knew
[3:26:04.040 --> 3:26:10.040]  that he had discussed the campaign contrary to his public comments and I believe his sworn testimony.
[3:26:10.040 --> 3:26:16.040]  And now contrary to a document that conveniently leaked from the intelligence community,
[3:26:16.040 --> 3:26:24.040]  in which Kizlak, the Russian ambassador, claims that he did talk politics in the campaign with Sessions.
[3:26:24.040 --> 3:26:28.040]  He's been missing on the prosecution of the Clintons.
[3:26:28.040 --> 3:26:33.040]  He'd been missing on the prosecution of the Obama gang for wiretapping.
[3:26:33.040 --> 3:26:40.040]  His asset forfeiture program is something Adolf Hitler would be proud of.
[3:26:40.040 --> 3:26:49.040]  He wants to relaunch the war on drugs, shearing off a giant piece of the Trump liberty-based constituency.
[3:26:49.040 --> 3:26:54.040]  You can see why the president is upset. Jeff Sessions is MIA. Where is he?
[3:26:54.040 --> 3:26:58.040]  When he does exert himself, it's on the wrong issues.
[3:26:58.040 --> 3:27:06.040]  Let me join in there and say, when we all got angry and rightfully so, I think when Comey refused to prosecute Hillary Clinton.
[3:27:06.040 --> 3:27:11.040]  But now we understand that Sessions is doing the same thing and he's taking it to another level.
[3:27:11.040 --> 3:27:20.040]  As you pointed out before, this isn't a supposition, this isn't your opinion that the FBI and the NSA violated the law
[3:27:20.040 --> 3:27:24.040]  when they surveilled the Trump campaign, when they unmasked individuals.
[3:27:24.040 --> 3:27:29.040]  That was the FISA court that said that. So there's no question at all about this.
[3:27:29.040 --> 3:27:35.040]  The FISA court has looked very carefully at this and they said yes, there was a violation of the law by the FBI,
[3:27:35.040 --> 3:27:41.040]  by the NSA at the bare minimum. Why isn't the Attorney General prosecuting them?
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:47.040]  And again, still letting Hillary off the hook as we had FBI Director Comey do.
[3:27:47.040 --> 3:27:53.040]  Well, and if I may steal a line from others, what did the president know and when did he know it?
[3:27:53.040 --> 3:28:01.040]  It's hard for me to believe that Barack Obama was unaware of the illegal surveillance of tens of thousands of people,
[3:28:01.040 --> 3:28:05.040]  all of whom happened to be political opponents of this administration.
[3:28:05.040 --> 3:28:13.040]  Anyone who has not read the circa news stories on this by John Solomon and Sarah Carter should do so.
[3:28:13.040 --> 3:28:18.040]  It's funny how none of this appeared on the front pages of the Washington Post or the New York Times.
[3:28:18.040 --> 3:28:23.040]  You won't find it on CNN, but it is a scandal far bigger than Watergate.
[3:28:23.040 --> 3:28:27.040]  And it is the key to the president's survival.
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:31.040]  Stone's rules. You do not win on defense.
[3:28:31.040 --> 3:28:41.040]  Here he has his opponents by the shorthairs in an outrageously illegal and unconstitutional spying operation.
[3:28:41.040 --> 3:28:48.040]  And his Attorney General is dithering around trying to prosecute people for smoking pot to improve their health.
[3:28:48.040 --> 3:28:52.040]  His sessions is just an abysmal failure.
[3:28:52.040 --> 3:28:59.040]  And I know Donald Trump for 40 years, when he hits you in four tweets, he's sending you a message.
[3:28:59.040 --> 3:29:01.040]  His sessions is toast.
[3:29:01.040 --> 3:29:09.040]  When you said earlier that the only name that you mentioned as a possible successor to sessions was Pompeo.
[3:29:09.040 --> 3:29:11.040]  Is there anybody else's name there?
[3:29:11.040 --> 3:29:17.040]  Because I mean, as you pointed out before, he's got connections to the deep state and he's got connections to the intelligence community.
[3:29:17.040 --> 3:29:25.040]  And I said, you know, the real issue here is elect espionage that we've had here is election espionage by our own intelligence community.
[3:29:25.040 --> 3:29:29.040]  As a member of the intelligence community, you're really going to come after those people.
[3:29:29.040 --> 3:29:35.040]  You have just capitalized my concern exactly, David, and that is the president is I on Pompeo.
[3:29:35.040 --> 3:29:45.040]  But I don't think he understands that Pompeo will not prosecute the boys at Langley for their role in the illegal spying on the Trump campaign,
[3:29:45.040 --> 3:29:48.040]  Trump associates, and other Republicans.
[3:29:48.040 --> 3:29:50.040]  And there is the nut of the problem.
[3:29:50.040 --> 3:29:52.040]  One must wonder what happened to Pompeo.
[3:29:52.040 --> 3:30:05.040]  We'll be right back.
[3:30:22.040 --> 3:30:28.040]  The ants may have the last laugh on the grasshoppers, but the grasshoppers will still sing the tune if they can make money.
[3:30:28.040 --> 3:30:35.040]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation proof bunker.
[3:30:35.040 --> 3:30:39.040]  There are still very effective low tech, low cost things you can do to prepare.
[3:30:39.040 --> 3:30:47.040]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[3:30:47.040 --> 3:30:55.040]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock, or to protect you from home invasion.
[3:30:55.040 --> 3:31:01.040]  Prepare for the worst case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best case scenario.

[3:31:35.040 --> 3:31:36.040]  That's what I'm talking about.
[3:31:36.040 --> 3:31:45.040]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[3:31:45.040 --> 3:31:54.040]  Harvestrite freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[3:31:54.040 --> 3:31:58.040]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[3:31:58.040 --> 3:32:02.040]  Harvestrite is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[3:33:27.040 --> 3:33:40.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:40.040 --> 3:33:47.040]  Oh, and Troyer David Knight, we have Roger Stone on the line as well breaking down the developments in the White House today.
[3:33:47.040 --> 3:33:56.040]  The momentum is shifting against Jeff Sessions and towards an aggressive White House that wants to go on the offense.
[3:33:56.040 --> 3:33:59.040]  Speaking of offensive, John McCain.
[3:33:59.040 --> 3:34:03.040]  You know, I didn't want to come on here and bash the guy you just got, brain cancer.
[3:34:03.040 --> 3:34:07.040]  I don't know if we have the clip, but you guys may not have gotten the clip yet.
[3:34:07.040 --> 3:34:12.040]  Just go ahead and play John McCain, reintroducing himself on the Hill today. Go ahead.
[3:34:12.040 --> 3:34:21.040]  I hope we can again rely on humility, on our need to cooperate, on our dependence on each other, and learn how to trust each other again.
[3:34:21.040 --> 3:34:25.040]  And by so doing better, serve the people who elected us.
[3:34:25.040 --> 3:34:31.040]  Stop listening to the bombastic loud mouths on the radio and television and the internet.
[3:34:31.040 --> 3:34:33.040]  To hell with them.
[3:34:33.040 --> 3:34:37.040]  I got new to hell with you, McCain. To hell with you.
[3:34:37.040 --> 3:34:43.040]  I didn't want to attack you. I didn't want to deal with you. You just got brain cancer, but you came after us. Get him out of here.
[3:34:43.040 --> 3:34:45.040]  I'm done with him. To hell with you, John McCain.
[3:34:45.040 --> 3:34:50.040]  And I got news for John McCain, who says he wants to be reaching out to the people that got him elected.
[3:34:50.040 --> 3:34:54.040]  Guess what, buddy? We're the media now. We get people elected.
[3:34:54.040 --> 3:34:59.040]  We got Trump elected. We're going to be in charge in the 2018 midterm elections. Get used to it.
[3:34:59.040 --> 3:35:05.040]  And all that globalist ass-kissing you're doing right now for life extension technology, you're not going to get it, McCain.
[3:35:05.040 --> 3:35:08.040]  Excuse me. That's my rant on McCain, David.
[3:35:08.040 --> 3:35:10.040]  We want to talk about people cooperating.
[3:35:10.040 --> 3:35:13.040]  Let's talk about his cooperation or collusion with ISIS.
[3:35:13.040 --> 3:35:23.040]  How many people have suffered and died in just that one country because of the actions of John McCain acting as Al Qaeda's weapon source,
[3:35:23.040 --> 3:35:27.040]  as ISIS's weapon source. That's the thing that is really key.
[3:35:27.040 --> 3:35:33.040]  But let's go back to Roger because he pointed out how the Trump administration is shifting from a defense mode.
[3:35:33.040 --> 3:35:38.040]  He said one of his key rules, and this is something that Roger and Alex said from day one.
[3:35:38.040 --> 3:35:41.040]  Trump had to go on offense.
[3:35:41.040 --> 3:35:48.040]  We talked about how Attorney General Sessions has refused to come after former director James Comey,
[3:35:48.040 --> 3:35:51.040]  who allowed Hillary Clinton a pass.
[3:35:51.040 --> 3:35:53.040]  We were all upset about that. He hasn't gone after Hillary.
[3:35:53.040 --> 3:36:00.040]  He hasn't gone after the man who colluded with her to give her a pass, who obstructed justice by giving her a pass.
[3:36:00.040 --> 3:36:05.040]  And he hasn't gone after the people, the FBI, the NSA, the FISA court.
[3:36:05.040 --> 3:36:08.040]  This is not my opinion. This is not Roger Stone's opinion.
[3:36:08.040 --> 3:36:14.040]  This is the opinion of the FISA court that the FBI, the NSA violated the Fourth Amendment, violated the FISA Act,
[3:36:14.040 --> 3:36:21.040]  violated the laws of the United States to go after the Trump campaign and to surveil them and to unmask them.
[3:36:21.040 --> 3:36:28.040]  That's the key issue. So we need a fighter, but we're very concerned about the name that Roger has put up here, Pompeo.
[3:36:28.040 --> 3:36:36.040]  I agree, Roger. I think we're going to have a situation where just like Jeff Sessions doesn't want to go after his colleagues in Washington.
[3:36:36.040 --> 3:36:42.040]  I'm concerned the same thing is going to happen with Pompeo, who doesn't want to go after his colleagues in the intelligence community.
[3:36:42.040 --> 3:36:46.040]  It may wind up exactly in the same place where we are right now.
[3:36:46.040 --> 3:36:52.040]  I think that's a very legitimate concern, David. First of all, let me address John McCain.
[3:36:52.040 --> 3:36:58.040]  There seems to be some new argument that because he's ill, he's now immune from criticism.
[3:36:58.040 --> 3:37:08.040]  I wish him well. I wish him Godspeed and a speedier recovery from his surgery, but that does not mean that he should be immune to criticism.
[3:37:08.040 --> 3:37:19.040]  His trafficking of a fake document, a fake dossier smearing Donald Trump amounts to treason in my opinion against the president of the United States.
[3:37:19.040 --> 3:37:22.040]  And Trump still supports him, by the way.
[3:37:22.040 --> 3:37:27.040]  He's worse than Watergate. I don't know what he's talking about. We can't find any collusion.
[3:37:27.040 --> 3:37:31.040]  He said Barack Obama was a greater president than Donald Trump.
[3:37:31.040 --> 3:37:40.040]  His graphics with ISIS, his institute, which he would have us believe he doesn't control, even though everyone who works there came from his Senate staff,
[3:37:40.040 --> 3:37:43.040]  has taken millions from the Saudis.
[3:37:43.040 --> 3:37:46.040]  John McCain is a disgrace.
[3:37:46.040 --> 3:37:50.040]  This is a guy I supported for president, not once, but twice.
[3:37:50.040 --> 3:37:54.040]  I'm bravely disappointed in the way he has conducted himself.
[3:37:54.040 --> 3:38:09.040]  I can only suggest to you that perhaps his erratic, explosive, irrational behavior, his violent outbursts, and his trucking with the enemy may have been caused by pressure from his brain tumor.
[3:38:09.040 --> 3:38:18.040]  Well, I don't know. It seems like Roger, he's always used his POW status and his injuries from the war.
[3:38:18.040 --> 3:38:27.040]  He's used that to shield himself from criticism. Now it seems like he's using the brain cancer to shield himself from criticism while he goes on the attack against others.
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:33.040]  And he's about to gear up for another Senate run. If he's that sick, he can't even think clearly because of a brain tumor. Why is he running for Senate again?
[3:38:33.040 --> 3:38:36.040]  Well, he just got elected in the fall.
[3:38:36.040 --> 3:38:48.040]  I'm going to be speaking in Tucson tomorrow and I'm going to be very careful. I recognize that he is gravely ill and I respect that and I really do wish him a speedy recovery from his health problems.
[3:38:48.040 --> 3:38:53.040]  But that should not make him immune from any criticism of his public record.
[3:38:53.040 --> 3:39:00.040]  I don't understand why the Republicans in the Senate haven't censured him for trafficking in phony intelligence documents.
[3:39:00.040 --> 3:39:13.040]  Frankly, if I were the president, I would tell Mitch McConnell, either the Senate Republican censor John McCain or you can kiss your wife, the Secretary of Transportation, who's doing nothing whatsoever to make America great again.
[3:39:13.040 --> 3:39:17.040]  She can kiss her job as Secretary of Transportation. Goodbye.
[3:39:17.040 --> 3:39:26.040]  You know, this is actually an interesting thought. I just had creep into my head because we've been talking about the notion or the paradigm that it's Washington establishment.
[3:39:26.040 --> 3:39:33.040]  It's the D.C. Deep State versus the people. Trump represents the people. Everyone in D.C. looks out for their own, including Jeff Sessions, it appears.
[3:39:33.040 --> 3:39:47.040]  Maybe this is what McCain was saying. Maybe McCain went to the floor and he was actually talking to everyone on the Hill today saying, all of my brothers and sisters in Congress, screw the people on TV, screw the people in radio.
[3:39:47.040 --> 3:39:53.040]  Forget the fact that everyone listens to them. We're in charge. We're the D.C. establishment. I'm John McCain.
[3:39:53.040 --> 3:39:58.040]  And he gets them all fired up. Maybe that's what he was doing. Do you think I'm out of line there?
[3:39:58.040 --> 3:40:05.040]  Well, it's very hard to say. In all honesty, I think he's become increasingly erratic and mentally unbalanced. I'm not surprised that he's not well.
[3:40:05.040 --> 3:40:14.040]  I've been trying to figure out his behavior now for some time. Remember, this is someone I've known since he came to Washington as a conservative Republican congressman.
[3:40:14.040 --> 3:40:24.040]  I supported him over George W. Bush. I supported him in the pivotal Florida primary where he was nominated, essentially where he wrapped up the nomination.
[3:40:24.040 --> 3:40:35.040]  And his behavior towards a president of his own party and towards the movement that elected Donald Trump is reprehensible.
[3:40:35.040 --> 3:40:42.040]  Why does he just switch to become a Democrat? That would make a lot more sense. He seems to be more comfortable with them anyway.
[3:40:42.040 --> 3:40:47.040]  Let's trade Tulsi Gabbard for John McCain. I'd make that deal tomorrow.
[3:40:47.040 --> 3:40:55.040]  That would make sense. Tulsi Gabbard calls out John McCain's terrorist in Syria. And John McCain's the Republican, though.
[3:40:55.040 --> 3:41:01.040]  Well, you know, when we had the Comey hearings, everybody was talking about John McCain.
[3:41:01.040 --> 3:41:05.040]  And it clearly appeared at that point in time that he was not in full possession of his faculty.
[3:41:05.040 --> 3:41:14.040]  So people were saying, is this dementia? Is it some other issue? And as the blood clot issue came, that was one of the things that people talked about, possible brain tumor.
[3:41:14.040 --> 3:41:25.040]  So we do, as you said, wish him well in terms of his personal health. But there's not anybody I could find in Washington that I would disagree with any more strongly.
[3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:28.040]  There's many that I would disagree with as strongly as John McCain.
[3:41:28.040 --> 3:41:42.040]  But he clearly has been the leader of the opposition. And as we all pointed out before the election, Donald Trump's greatest opposition was going to come from within the GOP, from the establishment of the GOP.
[3:41:42.040 --> 3:41:52.040]  And that's what we see now with Boehner saying earlier today, Roger, I don't know if you saw that or not, that we're not ever going to have a repeal of Obamacare.
[3:41:52.040 --> 3:42:02.040]  And then laughing about the fact that Trump used to give him money, but Trump wasn't his first or even his second or third choice, so forth and so on.
[3:42:02.040 --> 3:42:09.040]  At the same time, Donald Trump said that if they don't repeal Obamacare, that is going to be death to the Republican Party.
[3:42:09.040 --> 3:42:15.040]  And exhibit A is John Boehner, who is no longer there because he refused to do what he campaigned on.
[3:42:15.040 --> 3:42:22.040]  He refused to deliver on the promises to the Republican Party. And so it was the conservatives who pushed him out.
[3:42:22.040 --> 3:42:30.040]  Aren't they the people that Donald Trump needs to coalesce around the House Freedom Caucus of people who really do want to do what they told the voters who voted for them?
[3:42:30.040 --> 3:42:43.040]  Yeah, I think this was a major failure of Ryan's previous. You'll recall that the first healthcare bill that was put forward by Paul Ryan, but in fact actually drafted by John Boehner, was abysmal.
[3:42:43.040 --> 3:42:50.040]  Was a lay down for the medical industry and a nightmare for the taxpayers. That went down in flames.
[3:42:50.040 --> 3:43:01.040]  Is it any surprise now that Paul Ryan yesterday comes out and says that Robert Mueller is some kind of a second coming of Christ, a man of great integrity.
[3:43:01.040 --> 3:43:13.040]  When in fact Mueller is just a stooge for the Clintons and the Bushes and the deep state still chasing after a crime that he can't seem to define because he doesn't have one.
[3:43:13.040 --> 3:43:22.040]  Then we learned that he's going to go back into the president's business career before he was in politics. Relevance? Relevance is what?
[3:43:22.040 --> 3:43:35.040]  Just an unalterable attempt to ride this out until the 18 elections, hoping that the Democrats win the House and then he can hang any charge on the president he wants.
[3:43:35.040 --> 3:43:42.040]  Perjury, any phony charge which the Democrats would then use as grounds for impeachment.
[3:43:42.040 --> 3:43:57.040]  We already had a story today as an example of that Roger on the Daily Mail calling out Donald Trump and say he just leaked on himself and then having a CIA former CIA employee say well it looks like he leaked out some classified information.
[3:43:57.040 --> 3:44:06.040]  When Donald Trump said hey the fake Washington, Amazon, Washington Post is talking about what happened with Syrian arms and support for that.
[3:44:06.040 --> 3:44:19.040]  He didn't even say anything about the CIA and yet we got the CIA coming out here. The story that everybody knows has been out in the open about the fact that the CIA and John McCain have been giving arms to the Syrian rebels.
[3:44:19.040 --> 3:44:33.040]  That's what they're very upset about. The CIA is upset about that so we get one former employee saying well we could come after Donald Trump for this at the same time we get John Brennan coming out and saying hey we need to have a coup against him if he does anything with Robert Mueller.
[3:44:33.040 --> 3:44:40.040]  They can use any pretense to come after him and impeach him if the Democrats have a majority in the House.
[3:44:40.040 --> 3:44:46.040]  If I had five minutes with Jeff Sessions I'd ask him one question. Why hasn't John Brennan been arrested?
[3:44:46.040 --> 3:44:47.040]  Yes.
[3:44:47.040 --> 3:45:08.040]  Why hasn't he been indicted? He is up to his neck in the illegal surveillance and the leaking illegally of surveillance material. He makes it obvious. And as disgusted as I was by the memo by Kislak, the Russian ambassador, which said that he did discuss the campaign with Jeff Sessions,
[3:45:08.040 --> 3:45:20.040]  I'm more concerned with the fact that that memo leaked in violation of the law. When will this leaking stop? I can answer your question. When the president gets around to appointing a government.
[3:45:20.040 --> 3:45:32.040]  I would point out to you that about 20% of the government are Trump appointees and the other 80% in appointed positions are Obama holdovers or vacancies.
[3:45:32.040 --> 3:45:46.040]  I lay this again at the feet of Reince Priebus. We are now deep into the first year of the administration, but the president has no loyalists in these individual departments, which is why the leaking from the intelligence committee
[3:45:46.040 --> 3:45:52.040]  committees continues. Or I should say the intelligence community continues.
[3:45:52.040 --> 3:46:07.040]  Well, Roger, we've got a John Rappaport, who is going to come on. We're going to split this hour between you and John. This has been such breaking news. We want to keep you on, but also bring John Rappaport in with us and get his opinion on what he's heard from Roger Stone as well as the other news.
[3:46:07.040 --> 3:46:16.040]  They thank you for joining us. John Rappaport site is no more fake news. You've been on top of fake news for a long time, John. Welcome.
[3:46:16.040 --> 3:46:25.040]  Good to be here. Thank you. I would just double down on pretty much everything that you've been saying and Roger's been saying here.
[3:46:25.040 --> 3:46:44.040]  If you don't go on the offense, then you're always playing defense. And if the enemy is strong enough, they're going to keep you distracted and operating on a dozen, two dozen fronts all at the same time trying to plug the gaps and it's not going to work.
[3:46:44.040 --> 3:46:58.040]  So from the beginning, when we were all saying, do not let the Clintons off the hook. Yes, this is not a dead issue. The Clinton Foundation is not a dead issue.
[3:46:58.040 --> 3:47:15.040]  The money laundering foundation, the U.S. uranium deal, which the Clintons, both of them were so instrumental in which gave 20% of U.S. uranium production to Putin and Russia that I've detailed many times.
[3:47:15.040 --> 3:47:35.040]  That is not a dead issue. None of this, the email scandal, Hillary's email service, that is not a dead issue. And of course, neither is the Obama team spying and leaking and spying and leaking on the Trump team.
[3:47:35.040 --> 3:47:47.040]  None of this is going to, you know, if you just let it go and say, we're being nice guys and we're moving on.
[3:47:47.040 --> 3:47:55.040]  Well, we see how that worked. This Russia collusion story with Trump, etc. is never going to go away.
[3:47:55.040 --> 3:48:05.040]  And if you want to stop it, you have to stop it by going on the offense and saying, here's what the real collusion looks like, folks.
[3:48:05.040 --> 3:48:20.040]  20% of U.S. uranium to Russia, the Clintons were up to their necks in it, money, and just go back over the whole thing, including, of course, the Clinton Foundation chapter and verse, go on the offense.
[3:48:20.040 --> 3:48:38.040]  And I'm sorry, but Trump has to clear his head. I mean, if he wants to clear his head, if he can't find anybody to appoint to these key posts that falls in line with the agenda that he promised the voter, then he's going to have to do it himself.
[3:48:38.040 --> 3:48:50.040]  He can't just stand by and say, well, another screw up. So who can I appoint now that will appoint the person I want? It doesn't work that way after a certain point.
[3:48:50.040 --> 3:48:58.040]  Absolutely. And so now what we've seen is a revival, actually a story that's been around for several months. We talked earlier to Lee Stranahan.
[3:48:58.040 --> 3:49:08.040]  It's now getting traction, and that's what actually happened in Ukraine. Another aspect of this corruption, we're going to have hearings on it tomorrow by Grassley.
[3:49:08.040 --> 3:49:15.040]  I had a very interesting report earlier from Lee Stranahan. There's so many different aspects to this that have just been left there on the floor.
[3:49:15.040 --> 3:49:25.040]  Attorney General Sessions has not done anything to it. As I pointed out before, it's just as much of a problem that he gave these people a pass as it is that Comey gave Clinton a pass.
[3:49:25.040 --> 3:49:36.040]  So now Comey and Clinton and all the rest of them are getting passes from Attorney General Sessions, especially the people that have been flagged by the FISA court.
[3:49:36.040 --> 3:49:40.040]  The FISA court telling us that we've had massive violations of the law and our Attorney General is sitting on the sideline.
[3:49:40.040 --> 3:49:48.040]  Well, think about this too. When you talk about playing defense and offense, yeah, we've been playing defense with Trump, Russia thing and all the allegations against Trump.
[3:49:48.040 --> 3:49:56.040]  We've defended all of them in one, but think about this. Obama spying on the American people in the Trump campaign. They haven't addressed that. They haven't played defense on that.
[3:49:56.040 --> 3:50:07.040]  They just take it. How about Ukraine? All the stuff on Ukraine. Does Clinton play defense on that? No. Does the DNC, Washington Schultz, does she play defense on all the charges with the DNC fraud lawsuit?
[3:50:07.040 --> 3:50:15.040]  No. So these people are never on defense. They never defend the allegations against them, even though they're true. They're always on offense, even if they make it up.
[3:50:15.040 --> 3:50:18.040]  So maybe it's time to take a page out of their playbook.
[3:50:18.040 --> 3:50:27.040]  Alright, let's recap with Roger Stone. Roger, you told us that you believe that both the Attorney General as well as the White House Chief of Staff positions are in play.
[3:50:27.040 --> 3:50:35.040]  It's a major shakeup in the White House. We've got one good name that came out of it, but we've got some very troubling names that are coming out of this as well.
[3:50:35.040 --> 3:50:47.040]  David, to recap, the breaking news here is that Richard Pompeo, under consideration to become White House Chief of Staff, pardon me, to become U.S. Attorney General.
[3:50:47.040 --> 3:51:00.040]  This is deeply troubling because I doubt he would prosecute the CIA for their involvement in the spying, and both Dina Powell and General John Kelly in the running as well as David Urban for the position of Chief of Staff.
[3:51:00.040 --> 3:51:05.040]  I'm neutral on the Kelly question. I need to collect your opinion. We'll be right back with more from Roger Stone.

[3:55:36.040 --> 3:55:46.040]  Let's go back to John Rappaport. John, what do you think Trump needs to do now to swing the tide in the direction to put them, the enemy, on defense?
[3:55:46.040 --> 3:55:59.040]  Well, I think at the beginning, when he took office, one of his thoughts was, look, if I keep on playing offense against the Clintons, against Obama, and so on,
[3:55:59.040 --> 3:56:07.040]  you know, there's just going to be too much stuff stirred up, and I've got my agenda, and I'm trying to forward this, that, and the other thing.
[3:56:07.040 --> 3:56:18.040]  So, let's just let it ride. What he didn't realize was the ferocity and the consistency of the attack against him, and how it was all going to keep on going,
[3:56:18.040 --> 3:56:26.040]  and actually escalate way beyond probably what he even imagined it could, and it's never going to stop.
[3:56:26.040 --> 3:56:43.040]  So now, perhaps he gets the point. He should have gone on offense right away, and he should do it now. He should find an attorney general who's willing to carry out that program against the illegal spying and leaking
[3:56:43.040 --> 3:56:49.040]  and unmasking of the Obama administration against him, Trump.
[3:56:49.040 --> 3:56:52.040]  Do you think that the current CIA director of Pompeo will do that, John?
[3:56:52.040 --> 3:56:53.040]  No, absolutely not.
[3:56:53.040 --> 3:56:54.040]  I don't either.
[3:56:54.040 --> 3:57:02.040]  No, there's no, you see, and this is the mystery. Come on, man, wake up. You're going to appoint another loser.
[3:57:02.040 --> 3:57:03.040]  Yes.
[3:57:03.040 --> 3:57:05.040]  It's just going to prolong the acting and you make it work.
[3:57:05.040 --> 3:57:12.040]  Yeah, I mean, you could say the same things that you would say against Sessions. I mean, Sessions has been more impactful than Pompeo. I mean, what has Pompeo done?
[3:57:12.040 --> 3:57:22.040]  Exactly. I mean, you know, we're sitting here, and we can see it, so he certainly should be able to see it. I'm talking about Trump.
[3:57:22.040 --> 3:57:33.040]  If he wants to do what he has to do, then he's got to think clearly now and say who, because look, the attorney general is under the president of the United States.
[3:57:33.040 --> 3:57:44.040]  We saw that with Eric Holder and Barack Obama. Eric Holder was not stepping out of line and saying things against Obama and criticizing his foreign policy and so on and so forth.
[3:57:44.040 --> 3:57:49.040]  Get real here. The attorney general is under the president of the United States constitutionally.
[3:57:49.040 --> 3:58:04.040]  Okay, put somebody in the chair who is going to take the offensive and carry out these prosecutions single-mindedly and absolutely come hell or high water. Why is that so difficult? I don't see it.
[3:58:04.040 --> 3:58:14.040]  Yeah, it's amazing to me that you don't have somebody that wants to take that stand. I would imagine there's a ton of young lawyers throughout the United States that would love to make a name for themselves with this Clinton case.
[3:58:14.040 --> 3:58:23.040]  And so we got attorney general Sessions, who's on this quixotic quest to shut down the Ninth and Tenth Amendment along with the arrest of the Bill of Rights.
[3:58:23.040 --> 3:58:34.040]  I'll tell you what. Thank you. NoMoreFakeNews.com. John Rapport. Thank you. Roger Stone. StoneColdTruth.com. I'm telling you what, regardless of whoever gets hired or whatever, justice is coming to the Clintons.
[3:58:34.040 --> 3:58:39.040]  Justice is coming to Wasserman Schultz. We hope it's on this earth, but if not, it'll be in the next, folks.
