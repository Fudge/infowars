[00:00.000 --> 00:04.600]  I've known Alex for like more than 20 years.
[00:04.600 --> 00:05.600]  I've hung out with that guy.
[00:05.600 --> 00:07.360]  We've been hammered together so many times.
[00:07.360 --> 00:09.120]  That is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[00:09.120 --> 00:11.400]  He was right about all this Jeffrey Epstein ****.
[00:11.400 --> 00:12.960]  That is a **** fact.
[00:12.960 --> 00:15.600]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:15.600 --> 00:18.720]  For years, Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories.
[00:18.720 --> 00:21.800]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[00:21.800 --> 00:25.240]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist.
[00:25.240 --> 00:28.120]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[00:28.120 --> 00:33.480]  Alex Jones supported President Trump, but also peddled and promoted sick conspiracy theories.
[00:33.480 --> 00:38.520]  It's really hard for me to understand how anyone can be so sick in the head.
[00:38.520 --> 00:41.040]  Alex Jones, my God, Mika, and just...
[00:41.040 --> 00:42.040]  Yeah.
[00:42.040 --> 00:44.000]  Conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.520]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[00:46.520 --> 00:48.200]  Conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[00:48.200 --> 00:52.000]  Alex Jones has been behind several right-wing conspiracy theories.
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.320]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[00:54.320 --> 00:57.360]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[00:57.360 --> 01:02.680]  The captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership, Alex Jones.
[01:02.680 --> 01:08.280]  Jones espouses a litany of conspiracy theories, although he thinks that term belittles his
[01:08.280 --> 01:09.280]  reporting.
[01:09.280 --> 01:10.600]  The government's poisoning the water.
[01:10.600 --> 01:11.600]  Absolutely.
[01:11.600 --> 01:15.200]  I have all these other government documents where the government proposes and government
[01:15.200 --> 01:19.480]  think tanks propose poisoning the water to dumb down the population, make them more
[01:19.480 --> 01:20.480]  easily manageable.
[01:20.480 --> 01:23.360]  Oh, dear, the floor, I didn't work on this one.
[01:23.360 --> 01:25.360]  He's fighting back against my takeover.
[01:25.360 --> 01:27.560]  Hurry, chemtrail him immediately.
[01:27.560 --> 01:31.160]  I've noticed what they attack me with on mainstream news.
[01:31.160 --> 01:33.800]  Jones claims your cell phones are killing you.
[01:33.800 --> 01:37.520]  Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that are lowering your fertility and confusing
[01:37.520 --> 01:38.520]  your sexuality.
[01:38.520 --> 01:41.000]  Jones says there's black helicopters.
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.720]  Jones says there's a world government.
[01:42.720 --> 01:46.480]  Jones says the EU is unelected, it is, on and on and on.
[01:46.480 --> 01:49.280]  And everything we're saying is out in the open.
[01:49.280 --> 01:54.280]  Kelly Prime's son, Kyle, was just 10 years old when he was diagnosed with kidney cancer
[01:54.280 --> 01:56.480]  in 2016.
[01:56.480 --> 02:01.760]  Five months later, Kyle's friend and classmate, Mason Ferule, developed brain cancer.
[02:01.760 --> 02:05.440]  Two more kids at the school were diagnosed this year.
[02:05.440 --> 02:10.560]  The moms believe the recent increase in cancer cases could be caused by radiation from radio
[02:10.560 --> 02:17.280]  frequency or RF waves coming from this cell tower located on the elementary school campus.
[02:17.280 --> 02:22.400]  So think about how the LA Times and even Wired Magazine will admit there are thousands
[02:22.400 --> 02:27.600]  of studies that prove that wireless radiation, as it's intensified in its strength the last
[02:27.600 --> 02:32.200]  30 years and how many places it's emanating from, and especially the microwave millimeter
[02:32.200 --> 02:36.960]  waves, cell phones operate as microwaves, transmitters, and receivers, transceivers.
[02:36.960 --> 02:38.920]  Now, what's a microwave doing?
[02:38.920 --> 02:43.720]  Vibrates water, vibrates molecules, and 5G is an even more powerful form of microwave
[02:43.720 --> 02:48.040]  that even rattles it faster, that's what causes the heat, the friction of the molecules,
[02:48.040 --> 02:50.800]  and burns oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[02:50.800 --> 02:51.800]  You heard me right.
[02:51.800 --> 02:55.000]  5G burns the atmosphere.
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.360]  Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008 as part of a controversial
[03:00.360 --> 03:01.360]  deal.
[03:01.360 --> 03:06.040]  In a civil case against the government about that deal, one accuser says she took part in
[03:06.040 --> 03:12.640]  an orgy on Epstein's private island in 2002 with approximately eight other young girls
[03:12.640 --> 03:15.000]  who appeared to be under the age of 18.
[03:15.000 --> 03:16.520]  What may have happened here?
[03:16.520 --> 03:19.160]  Just because some people want to restrict views doesn't mean they have a right to do
[03:19.160 --> 03:20.160]  it.
[03:20.160 --> 03:24.480]  You see, once that happens, now you can shut down the details of Bill Clinton's best buddy
[03:24.480 --> 03:26.840]  and the pedophile island that we've been exposing.
[03:26.840 --> 03:32.240]  Prison guards working when Epstein apparently died by suicide may have falsified reports
[03:32.240 --> 03:35.920]  to make it look like they were checking in on Epstein when they were in fact not.
[03:35.920 --> 03:39.440]  I am now more suspicious than ever that this could be a homicide.
[03:39.440 --> 03:42.600]  People won't listen to me because I got too much data, and you imagine what this is like?
[03:42.600 --> 03:45.800]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[03:45.800 --> 03:51.360]  He was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island, and they have all these
[03:51.360 --> 03:53.960]  young girls that this guy hooks them up with.
[03:53.960 --> 04:22.120]  He was talking about this years ago, now it is mainstream news.
[04:22.120 --> 04:24.120]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[04:24.120 --> 04:27.160]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies, and the way they did so is because
[04:27.160 --> 04:31.600]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political, or legal for their illicit activities
[04:31.600 --> 04:32.600]  over two decades.
[04:32.600 --> 04:35.960]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[04:35.960 --> 04:39.280]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[04:39.280 --> 04:43.560]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[04:43.560 --> 04:46.640]  to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change, and they will become the
[04:46.640 --> 04:50.680]  Big Tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American
[04:50.680 --> 04:54.960]  politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after
[04:54.960 --> 04:55.960]  the Great Depression.
[04:55.960 --> 05:00.960]  The infamous audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make
[05:00.960 --> 05:05.720]  real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent
[05:05.720 --> 05:06.720]  free press.
[05:06.720 --> 05:11.120]  Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[05:11.120 --> 05:14.880]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole
[05:14.880 --> 05:15.880]  time it's not happening.
[05:15.880 --> 05:17.920]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[05:17.920 --> 05:19.840]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[05:19.840 --> 05:34.120]  And it is what we just saw.
[05:34.120 --> 05:38.120]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[05:38.120 --> 06:04.120]  So we should do what any other country does by dealing this situation in a serious way.
[06:04.120 --> 06:12.560]  So we have to bring in the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees, an agency that
[06:12.560 --> 06:24.520]  has the expertise and the training to handle massive flows of refugees, you may be.
[06:24.520 --> 06:35.520]  Now I got sent that clip seven or eight times in the last 12 hours.
[06:35.520 --> 06:40.000]  I got sent some late last night, some today by friends, family, you name it.
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.960]  And Paul Joseph Watson is putting a big article together for infowars.com that gives you the
[06:44.960 --> 06:45.960]  rest of the backstory.
[06:45.960 --> 06:47.680]  But you heard what she said.
[06:47.680 --> 06:54.300]  She said we should do what every other country does.
[06:54.300 --> 07:00.560]  We should have the United Nations run our borders and run the refugee crisis.
[07:00.560 --> 07:08.200]  Now when she says that, she's giving you the establishment goal of the United Nations.
[07:08.200 --> 07:14.360]  The United Nations Refugee Office, the treaties that most nations are signatories to, puts
[07:14.360 --> 07:22.120]  the UN in control, not just of your borders, but of the policies and of who you accept
[07:22.120 --> 07:23.160]  into your country.
[07:23.160 --> 07:29.160]  So I'm getting all these calls saying, Alex, it's incredible, you were right again.
[07:29.160 --> 07:31.480]  They say they want the UN to run our borders.
[07:31.480 --> 07:37.680]  Well, Obama called for the UN to come and oversee the border patrol four or five times.
[07:37.680 --> 07:41.320]  The Congress made a bunch of noises about it, so he backed off.
[07:41.320 --> 07:45.960]  Congress has been run by the UN for decades.
[07:45.960 --> 07:49.400]  Back when the old Soviet Union was operating, a lot of times the UN would come in, take
[07:49.400 --> 07:52.160]  control of an area, and then turn it over to the Soviets.
[07:52.160 --> 07:59.040]  It was the UN sabotage dust in the Korean War, and wouldn't let us win the war, and
[07:59.040 --> 08:03.960]  basically ordered Congress to stand down and to remove General MacArthur.
[08:03.960 --> 08:05.440]  So this is all mainline history.
[08:05.440 --> 08:10.280]  It's like Alex, who told us fluorides causing brain damage and low IQ, why American Medical
[08:10.280 --> 08:15.560]  Association says you're right, because they said I was right 50 years ago.
[08:15.560 --> 08:19.120]  I'm going off reports that are already confirmed.
[08:19.120 --> 08:22.040]  It's just now people don't believe mainstream media, they don't believe the system, and
[08:22.040 --> 08:24.720]  so people are looking at the reports and going, oh, wow, you're right.
[08:24.720 --> 08:26.240]  I was always right.
[08:26.240 --> 08:33.720]  I'm right about yield signs being yellow, stop signs being red, direction signs being
[08:33.720 --> 08:38.800]  green, water being clear or blue that's reflecting the sky.
[08:38.800 --> 08:46.000]  I mean, that's what's so frustrating is 90% of what I cover is not cutting edge.
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.080]  It's just the reality.
[08:48.080 --> 08:53.000]  And people think that, oh, wow, it keeps coming true.
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.360]  I'm telling you about global cashless societies and face scanning to buy and sell, or to travel
[08:58.360 --> 09:02.960]  or live, and global social scores, Mark and the Beast, because they were planning it decades
[09:02.960 --> 09:05.160]  ago, now it's here.
[09:05.160 --> 09:11.640]  I was telling you beforehand so we could stop it, not to be a profit when it all happened.
[09:11.640 --> 09:17.720]  Because it's all been laid out by social engineers at DARPA, and they're charting our course.
[09:17.720 --> 09:22.640]  The eugenicists, the globalists, the transhumanists that control it, they are the ones running
[09:22.640 --> 09:23.640]  the show.
[09:23.640 --> 09:27.080]  It doesn't mean that most people in those agencies are actually well-meaning.
[09:27.080 --> 09:28.080]  They're compartmentalized.
[09:28.080 --> 09:34.920]  The little gerbils on the wheel turning the engine of the deep state, breakaway technology
[09:34.920 --> 09:41.800]  are good people, but those piloting it, those siphoning off our resources, they're the bad
[09:41.800 --> 09:42.800]  guys.
[09:42.800 --> 09:47.840]  So, Ilhan Omar demands United Nations take over America's border crisis.
[09:47.840 --> 09:55.600]  We'll play that clip again, I've heard, just in a moment, again, so cue it up, please.
[09:55.600 --> 10:00.920]  She says we need to do what every other nation does, yes, every other nation that is a signature
[10:00.920 --> 10:08.600]  to the UN, that's most countries of 170 plus, are signed onto the UN, and then it decides
[10:08.600 --> 10:12.120]  who can come in your country through the refugee office.
[10:12.120 --> 10:20.600]  Trump two years ago wisely pulled out of that treaty, because we weren't even congressionally
[10:20.600 --> 10:26.120]  never ratified it, but it was being executively followed.
[10:26.120 --> 10:33.680]  Going back to George Herbert Walker Bush and the whole Agenda 21 initiative that he signed
[10:33.680 --> 10:40.580]  onto that Congress didn't pass in 1992, so we've been harping on this since it happened.
[10:40.580 --> 10:47.720]  I was reading about this when I was graduating high school in 1992, and I was reading about
[10:47.720 --> 10:52.320]  a schooling under the UN, then it was being hailed on the news, because back then they
[10:52.320 --> 10:56.600]  thought there was an opposition, they're like, the UN now runs our borders and decides who
[10:56.600 --> 11:01.400]  can come to the US, it's wonderful, and the UN will decide standardization of toilets,
[11:01.400 --> 11:06.400]  light bulbs, the atomic family will no longer be here.
[11:06.400 --> 11:09.080]  And so I was witnessing it, that's what helped wake me up.
[11:09.080 --> 11:12.480]  So this is a big deal, and I just want to open with this, and there's a story that
[11:12.480 --> 11:16.160]  could pop up any moment on infowars.com and newswars.com, it was going to actually be
[11:16.160 --> 11:20.840]  up by the start of the show, can we look at infowars.com front page or newswars.com,
[11:20.840 --> 11:25.480]  can we put that on screen for me, on my knees, I beg for it.
[11:25.480 --> 11:28.760]  Because it was supposed to be up by the time we started the show, Paul Watson is going
[11:28.760 --> 11:34.560]  to be on, there you go, it's live, it's been live, I need those new stories, the last
[11:34.560 --> 11:38.800]  hour is worth, printed on my knees, I beg for it.
[11:38.800 --> 11:47.160]  Now continuing, Ilhan Omar demands United Nations take over America's border crisis.
[11:47.160 --> 11:53.800]  So we see this all over the place, we see them announcing it's the UN that supposedly
[11:53.800 --> 11:57.640]  runs this, and a lot of us are like, it's incredible Jones, you're right, how did you
[11:57.640 --> 11:59.520]  know this, how did it come through?
[11:59.520 --> 12:06.320]  Because it is the international world government law, that the UN will use giant third world
[12:06.320 --> 12:12.800]  populations, that they first stage in regional camps for six months to a year, literal brainwashing
[12:12.800 --> 12:21.280]  facilities, they then organize them, and they then flood the borders of the western nations
[12:21.280 --> 12:28.080]  where then UN camps are set up to receive them, then they are deployed to certain regions
[12:28.080 --> 12:34.000]  and to leftist political parties, who then sign them up for welfare and jobs, and then
[12:34.000 --> 12:40.320]  keep them as a sub slave class, and they skim off the top their wages and their welfare,
[12:40.320 --> 12:47.640]  and then give them ID's, driver's license, unionize them, and then weaponize them.
[12:47.640 --> 12:55.440]  They give them USAID State Department and UN funded $1,000 to $2,000 to 2,000 euro debit
[12:55.440 --> 13:03.000]  cards per leg of the trip with no name on it, mainline hotels are ordered to let the
[13:03.000 --> 13:10.920]  refugees in for free, this is all part of World War 4, the UN and the globalist wage
[13:10.920 --> 13:16.440]  and war, so these stories have gone live on infowars.com and newswars.com, they are our
[13:16.440 --> 13:22.080]  top stories today, they are so incredibly important, if you want to understand the big
[13:22.080 --> 13:27.720]  picture and how this whole thing is going down, Ilhan Omar demands UN take control
[13:27.720 --> 13:34.880]  of U.S. borders in mirror of European migrant crisis, we have to bring the United Nations
[13:34.880 --> 13:43.080]  High Commissioner on refugees, and it goes through the entire plan, it's on newswars.com,
[13:43.080 --> 13:48.000]  it's on infowars.com, and it is the most critical story ever, and so when we come back from
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.320]  break, I am going to walk through the history of this, the plan, and I am going to walk
[13:53.320 --> 14:00.200]  through how to stop it, ladies and gentlemen, but this is an absolute, stated world government
[14:00.200 --> 14:09.920]  admitted plan to bring down western nations and to bring in 600 million refugees by 2050
[14:09.920 --> 14:20.000]  to the U.S., that is the stated goal, the past resolution by the UN, 600 million, that's
[14:20.000 --> 14:28.360]  three times our population who will be totally kept and controlled and dominated by the globalist,
[14:28.360 --> 14:34.600]  this is the end of our nations, the end of our sovereignty, this is how fifth six-generational
[14:34.600 --> 14:41.840]  warfare operates, and if we don't get a handle on it, we are going to lose everything, then
[14:41.840 --> 14:48.440]  Paul Joseph Watson who just spent a week in Hong Kong, just got back today to the U.K.,
[14:48.440 --> 14:52.160]  he's going to be giving us stunning inside intel and reports not just from what happened
[14:52.160 --> 14:57.800]  on the ground, but from groups and organizations that he met with, and so much more, and this
[14:57.800 --> 15:03.760]  whole proxy war between the U.S. and China, and there is a lot more, but bottom line,
[15:03.760 --> 15:09.160]  that we are now in the middle of a global civil war between nation states and free people,
[15:09.160 --> 15:14.080]  and multinational corporations, allied with authoritarian regimes like China, it's lining
[15:14.080 --> 15:18.720]  up along the same battle lines of World War II, you notice the queen just suspended parliament
[15:18.720 --> 15:21.280]  and got behind Brexit.
[15:21.280 --> 15:27.080]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you
[15:27.080 --> 15:32.480]  now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill, because

[18:21.080 --> 18:26.480]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are
[18:26.480 --> 18:30.520]  control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[18:30.520 --> 18:35.840]  and make your own decisions, it's for the way of their great destiny to merge with AI
[18:35.840 --> 18:36.840]  Gods.
[18:36.840 --> 18:39.320]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[18:39.320 --> 18:43.840]  third dimension, but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[18:43.840 --> 18:46.800]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[18:46.800 --> 18:52.080]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from the ForwardsLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[18:52.080 --> 18:56.440]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality

[19:24.640 --> 19:31.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[19:54.640 --> 20:08.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide, Paul Watson joins us, fresh back
[20:08.920 --> 20:13.040]  from the Insanity of Hong Kong next segment.
[20:13.040 --> 20:18.160]  Draftreport.com is linked to an article that Adon Salazar wrote that I'll be getting to
[20:18.160 --> 20:20.160]  next hour.
[20:20.160 --> 20:22.560]  Hundreds of dogs have died in Austin.
[20:22.560 --> 20:30.960]  They're dying all over the U.S. from drinking water in creeks and lakes, will tell you why.
[20:30.960 --> 20:37.400]  And everyone I know basically has gotten sick swimming in Lake Travis, in Lake Austin or
[20:37.400 --> 20:38.400]  in Barton Creek.
[20:38.400 --> 20:43.320]  And I'm a big water guy, but a month ago I told my family, I said we need to stop going
[20:43.320 --> 20:52.080]  into the lake and get into the water because of this type of algae that is literally almost
[20:52.080 --> 20:55.440]  everyone I know that's gotten in the lake or the water in the last month and a half
[20:55.440 --> 20:58.680]  has gotten seriously sick, including myself and my family.
[20:58.680 --> 21:04.480]  So we're going to tell you about this blue-green algae and why it's so deadly.
[21:04.480 --> 21:11.080]  That's coming up next hour with that story is on Infowars.com and of course Drudgerport.com.
[21:11.080 --> 21:14.960]  So let's get to this right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:14.960 --> 21:18.360]  Let's break this down right now.
[21:18.360 --> 21:24.480]  Ilhan Omar demands United Nations takeover America's border crisis.
[21:24.480 --> 21:29.800]  I was sent this daily wire story by a lot of people last night and this morning and
[21:29.800 --> 21:33.200]  they were like, wow, you know, look Ben Shapiro is telling the truth about stuff now.
[21:33.200 --> 21:34.680]  Wow, you've been proven right again.
[21:34.680 --> 21:38.040]  I'm like proven right again.
[21:38.040 --> 21:44.800]  This is an official U.N. plan going back decades to build refugee centers in the third world,
[21:44.800 --> 21:50.720]  brainwash large groups of people into globalism, socialism and communism and anti-westernism
[21:50.720 --> 21:56.680]  and then have them invade and be a permanent political underclass inside the Western countries.
[21:56.680 --> 21:58.600]  So document cam shot please.
[21:58.600 --> 22:00.880]  Here are a few of the articles.
[22:00.880 --> 22:06.880]  McCryne, Europe entering age of unprecedented mass migration, shares destiny with Africa,
[22:06.880 --> 22:11.520]  says he wants 200 plus million in the next 30 years.
[22:11.520 --> 22:14.760]  That's a quote brought in to the country.
[22:14.760 --> 22:18.560]  200 million brought in, okay.
[22:18.560 --> 22:19.560]  Here's another one.
[22:19.560 --> 22:23.720]  This is from Paul Joseph Watson, links directly to the United Nations website revealed U.N.
[22:23.720 --> 22:32.520]  plan to flood America with 600 million migrants by 2050 tripling the population and they're
[22:32.520 --> 22:33.520]  building the U.N.
[22:33.520 --> 22:34.520]  refugee centers as we speak.
[22:34.520 --> 22:41.520]  Now here's the big article that's on newswars.com and infowars.com that Paul Joseph Watson has
[22:41.520 --> 22:44.080]  written about that gives you the back story of all of this.
[22:44.080 --> 22:47.680]  This is the article you send out, this is the article you share, you'll get censored
[22:47.680 --> 22:52.480]  on Twitter, you'll get censored on Facebook, but if you send out the newswars.com you won't
[22:52.480 --> 22:57.280]  get censored as much but whatever you do hand share it, send it out on your email, send
[22:57.280 --> 23:00.520]  it out on your text message while you still can.
[23:00.520 --> 23:04.000]  Facebook and others are buying up all the text message apps and not letting you do that
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.000]  as well.
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.920]  They're also not letting you tweet stuff about Jesus or strong women.
[23:09.920 --> 23:14.920]  Just disguise the limit of this takeover of communications and of course Congress is still
[23:14.920 --> 23:15.920]  doing nothing.
[23:15.920 --> 23:24.200]  Ilhan Omar demands U.N. take control of U.S. border in mirror of European migrant crisis.
[23:24.200 --> 23:29.000]  We have to bring the United Nations High Commissioner on refugees.
[23:29.000 --> 23:34.640]  Now, representative Ilhan Omar is demanding that the United Nations take control of the
[23:34.640 --> 23:39.400]  U.S. border with Mexico in a mirror of how Europe was inundated with migrants following
[23:39.400 --> 23:42.160]  lobbying from international bodies.
[23:42.160 --> 23:48.480]  When Paul goes on with the history of how they build the refugee centers in areas that
[23:48.480 --> 23:57.760]  are close to European or U.S. borders like Guatemala or places like Egypt or places like
[23:57.760 --> 24:02.920]  Libya once they take control of it, then they advertise that people can come in, they give
[24:02.920 --> 24:06.680]  them money, they give them aid, they give them backpacks, they give them food and they
[24:06.680 --> 24:12.880]  give them contacts and cell phones on who to contact once they make landfall and then
[24:12.880 --> 24:18.040]  they come across on the Zodiac boats, they come across on the land bridges, they jump
[24:18.040 --> 24:22.720]  on trains going from France under the tunnel that goes under the English Channel and they
[24:22.720 --> 24:29.360]  pour in in mass and then leftist and globalist are waiting on the other side to further indoctrinate
[24:29.360 --> 24:35.720]  them into the anti-American, anti-European, anti-white brainwashing culture.
[24:35.720 --> 24:40.120]  Today I have two articles, Uncle of Italian Girl Murdered by Migrants threatens to show
[24:40.120 --> 24:45.280]  photos of her dismembered body if immigration laws are loosened and it goes into the Nigerians
[24:45.280 --> 24:47.480]  torturing her and shopping her to death.
[24:47.480 --> 24:54.240]  Here's an Ethiopian national stabs to death random white girl walking her dog in D.C.
[24:54.240 --> 24:55.720]  because she was white.
[24:55.720 --> 25:02.600]  These hate crimes are just exploding but the U.N. teaches them this and it goes on to continue.
[25:02.600 --> 25:06.080]  Johan Omar says white people are the problem.
[25:06.080 --> 25:07.720]  Should I play the clips of her saying that?
[25:07.720 --> 25:09.000]  You've heard her say that.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.080]  Let's hear her say like every other country we need the U.N. that builds the centers,
[25:14.080 --> 25:20.120]  organizes the people, brain washes them for six months and then ships them here but instead
[25:20.120 --> 25:22.040]  we have a border patrol trying to stop it.
[25:22.040 --> 25:23.040]  No, no, no.
[25:23.040 --> 25:28.680]  The U.N. should be running it like every other country but see Trump withdrew us from
[25:28.680 --> 25:29.680]  the treaty.
[25:29.680 --> 25:30.680]  Here it is.
[25:30.680 --> 25:38.840]  So we should do what any other country does by dealing with this situation in a serious
[25:38.840 --> 25:39.840]  way.
[25:39.840 --> 25:48.120]  So we have to bring in the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees, an agency that
[25:48.120 --> 25:57.960]  has the expertise and the training to handle massive flows of refugees humanely.
[25:57.960 --> 26:00.120]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[26:00.120 --> 26:02.840]  So this isn't something I cooked up in my head.
[26:02.840 --> 26:05.880]  It's not something that patriots cooked up.
[26:05.880 --> 26:10.440]  Under Kennedy, who people lionized and said he was the greatest guy in the world, he had
[26:10.440 --> 26:20.240]  a lot of problems, they passed State Department memorandum 7277 and Congress created a whole
[26:20.240 --> 26:32.840]  system under what they call a uniform commercial code or a public law that said the U.N. would
[26:32.840 --> 26:38.240]  finally occupy Russia and the United States as part of a global government peace deal
[26:38.240 --> 26:40.520]  run by the Carnegie Endowment.
[26:40.520 --> 26:44.920]  Anybody can type into Bing, I wouldn't go to Google, it's worthless now, memorandum
[26:44.920 --> 26:51.680]  7277, State Department memorandum 7277 or public law and you'll get scanned copies,
[26:51.680 --> 26:56.400]  I've got a few around the office, of the actual U.N. pamphlet that was given to every college
[26:56.400 --> 27:02.600]  student in the United States after we signed on to it and it shows our military going down
[27:02.600 --> 27:07.320]  to zero on graphs and the U.N. going straight up.
[27:07.320 --> 27:18.880]  State Department memorandum 7277, State Department memorandum 7277, you can instantly pull it
[27:18.880 --> 27:23.040]  up for anybody that wants to see that for yourself.
[27:23.040 --> 27:27.560]  So this has always been the big public plan.
[27:27.560 --> 27:34.560]  This has always been the program, so back then they just announced it, they just announced
[27:34.560 --> 27:38.160]  it to Americans like, oh, the U.N. is going to occupy us and we're going to take all the
[27:38.160 --> 27:44.920]  guns and we passed a U.N. resolution that says all small arms will be handed in and
[27:44.920 --> 27:50.360]  the family is going to have to be ended and single parent homes have to be ended because
[27:50.360 --> 27:56.600]  it's called freedom from war and once we all live in dormitories, pre-education camps,
[27:56.600 --> 27:57.680]  then there'll be no more war.
[27:57.680 --> 28:01.400]  Once there's no more religion, except a one world religion, it'll all be okay.
[28:01.400 --> 28:06.480]  So see, how do I know all this, it's been the plan all along and the old days, the New
[28:06.480 --> 28:11.280]  York Times at front page articles promoting America rejected it so they went, okay, it
[28:11.280 --> 28:12.760]  doesn't exist, you're crazy.
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.120]  But right now we're being assaulted by U.N. takeover, the world's the middle of a civil
[28:17.120 --> 28:20.480]  war between the nation states and the globalist.
[28:20.480 --> 28:25.040]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[28:25.040 --> 28:26.960]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[28:26.960 --> 28:28.640]  I had a problem like you once.
[28:28.640 --> 28:34.120]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[28:34.120 --> 28:35.200]  my life.
[28:35.200 --> 28:40.440]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[28:40.440 --> 28:45.640]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[28:45.640 --> 28:48.800]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[28:48.800 --> 28:53.480]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[28:53.480 --> 28:55.800]  and totally change your life.
[28:55.800 --> 29:01.040]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[29:01.040 --> 29:04.320]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[29:04.320 --> 29:05.320]  Get clean.
[29:05.320 --> 29:22.240]  Call now and learn more 800-506-6740-800-506-6740 that's 800-506-6740.
[29:22.240 --> 29:26.120]  I talk about this on the air and I know it stinks into people, but I've decided that
[29:26.120 --> 29:29.880]  we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[29:29.880 --> 29:33.040]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would
[29:33.040 --> 29:36.440]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and
[29:36.440 --> 29:38.960]  I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[29:38.960 --> 29:42.360]  And instead the last few years I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[29:42.360 --> 29:43.360]  shut us down.
[29:43.360 --> 29:45.720]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[29:45.720 --> 29:46.720]  wonderful they were.
[29:46.720 --> 29:48.520]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[29:48.520 --> 29:52.840]  Joan sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[29:52.840 --> 29:58.120]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[29:58.120 --> 30:00.840]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[30:00.840 --> 30:04.600]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is
[30:04.600 --> 30:08.040]  the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different
[30:08.040 --> 30:09.040]  things.
[30:09.040 --> 30:10.040]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[30:10.040 --> 30:13.520]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[30:13.520 --> 30:15.480]  God's medicine chest.
[30:15.480 --> 30:21.480]  Our store dot com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[30:21.480 --> 30:27.400]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our Republic was in trouble
[30:27.400 --> 30:31.800]  in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who
[30:31.800 --> 30:34.680]  actually work for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[30:34.680 --> 30:39.400]  And today the Communist Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago.
[30:39.400 --> 30:44.240]  And we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's doing
[30:44.240 --> 30:45.600]  in this trade war.
[30:45.600 --> 30:48.280]  Once China put pressure on our farmers.
[30:48.280 --> 30:49.680]  That's beautiful.
[30:49.680 --> 30:52.760]  Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down.
[30:52.760 --> 30:56.800]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the world that want to intimidate
[30:56.800 --> 31:01.520]  people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up and all you've done is awaken
[31:01.520 --> 31:02.520]  the human spirit.
[31:02.520 --> 31:08.600]  The human spirit lives at info wars dot com and news wars dot com and I'm asking listeners,

[33:10.480 --> 33:12.720]  We are live broadcasting worldwide.
[33:12.720 --> 33:16.360]  I am your host Alex Jones radio or TV listener.
[33:16.360 --> 33:18.480]  It is beyond imperative.
[33:18.480 --> 33:25.040]  It is absolutely essential that you visit drugs report dot com, which we'll put on screen
[33:25.040 --> 33:31.600]  and that you go over to the right hand side of grudge and click on the fourth story down.
[33:31.600 --> 33:40.280]  Ilhan Omar demands UN take control of US borders in mirror of European migrant crisis.
[33:40.280 --> 33:44.880]  Paul Joseph Watson and I talked this morning, I said, my friend, you've written the articles
[33:44.880 --> 33:49.720]  I've laid it out here on air for decades, we've got to create a condensed article showing
[33:49.720 --> 33:55.200]  people that this is actually how the UN does it and that it's their plan every step of
[33:55.200 --> 33:56.200]  the way.
[33:56.200 --> 33:57.200]  Paul's done that.
[33:57.200 --> 34:02.000]  This could not be more of a Paul Revere type moment.
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.600]  The UN has been set up to take over and collapse nation states.
[34:06.600 --> 34:11.960]  The EU has been set up to take over nation states, suck them dry and collapse them.
[34:11.960 --> 34:18.080]  The EU is now saying they're going to get rid of national team names because soccer teams
[34:18.080 --> 34:24.440]  and rugby teams and basketball teams that have nationalist names are bad.
[34:24.440 --> 34:31.840]  We're told that our president saying that America exists is bad.
[34:31.840 --> 34:36.720]  We're told the word nationalist is racist.
[34:36.720 --> 34:43.760]  This is the insane level of this garbage, but it's all in freedom from war, the United
[34:43.760 --> 34:49.360]  Nations program for general and complete disarmament in a peaceful world.
[34:49.360 --> 34:55.760]  And they say, tribes make people fight, families make up tribes, get rid of families.
[34:55.760 --> 34:58.880]  Religion makes people fight, get rid of religion.
[34:58.880 --> 35:03.160]  Nations make people fight, get rid of nations, get rid of cultures.
[35:03.160 --> 35:06.640]  But once you've gotten rid of all that, what replaces it?
[35:06.640 --> 35:14.840]  The transhumanist, post-human world that NBC News has been telling us about.
[35:14.840 --> 35:19.400]  So of course everyone's freaking out right now when Ilhan Omar comes out and says we
[35:19.400 --> 35:24.040]  should do like other nations and have the UN come in and have them organize the refugee
[35:24.040 --> 35:31.800]  centers and then invite more so that it's 10 million a year, not a million a year.
[35:31.800 --> 35:39.000]  That's the bum rush plan happening.
[35:39.000 --> 35:45.800]  Ilhan Omar, the article is on drugreport.com, demands UN take control of U.S. borders in
[35:45.800 --> 35:49.560]  mirror of European migrant crisis.
[35:49.560 --> 35:54.520]  We have to bring in the United Nations High Commissioner on refugees.
[35:54.520 --> 35:59.280]  Ilhan Omar is demanding the United Nations take control of U.S. border with Mexico in
[35:59.280 --> 36:05.040]  a mirror of how Europe was inundated with migrants following lobbying from international
[36:05.040 --> 36:06.040]  bodies.
[36:06.040 --> 36:13.560]  Quote, we should do what any other country does by dealing with this situation in a serious
[36:13.560 --> 36:14.560]  way.
[36:14.560 --> 36:19.160]  Omar said during an immigration forum in South Minneapolis.
[36:19.160 --> 36:24.680]  He had to bring in the United Nations High Commissioner, somewhere Russian, on the refugees,
[36:24.680 --> 36:32.520]  an agency that has expertise and the training to handle massive flows of refugees humanely.
[36:32.520 --> 36:37.120]  Representative Ilhan Omar says the United Nations must be brought in to handle the immigration
[36:37.120 --> 36:39.360]  crisis on America's southern border.
[36:39.360 --> 36:40.880]  These are all quotes.
[36:40.880 --> 36:45.240]  Omar, who was accused this week of having an affair with a married man, lectured the
[36:45.240 --> 36:47.080]  audience about the mortal high ground.
[36:47.080 --> 36:52.360]  Well, she also reportedly gave him a quarter million dollars of campaign cash, which if
[36:52.360 --> 36:57.080]  true, makes him, I'm just a gigolo and everywhere I go.
[36:57.080 --> 37:02.640]  Yes, that's the old song from the Van Halen singer.
[37:02.640 --> 37:09.600]  Continuing, the demand bears hallmarks of how Europe was deluge with migrants or invaders
[37:09.600 --> 37:13.840]  after governments were forced to accept millions of refugees after lobbying from international
[37:13.840 --> 37:15.400]  groups and non-governmental organizations.
[37:15.400 --> 37:21.200]  And such intervention by the UN would represent a direct violation of U.S. sovereignty, fundamentally
[37:21.200 --> 37:23.400]  weakening America's national security.
[37:23.400 --> 37:27.520]  Omar previously called for the elimination of the entire Department of Homeland Security,
[37:27.520 --> 37:33.080]  which was tasked with dealing with threats to the nation following 9-11.
[37:33.080 --> 37:36.920]  And I'm going to have one of my writers beef this up a little bit, because I know Paul's
[37:36.920 --> 37:38.800]  busy and he never misses an interview.
[37:38.800 --> 37:40.920]  He was supposed to be here a few minutes ago.
[37:40.920 --> 37:44.920]  He's not here, so he might have had an issue getting back into London, but we'll find out.
[37:44.920 --> 37:50.160]  We're going to add to his articles, previous ones by Paul, we'll just add little blurbs
[37:50.160 --> 37:56.680]  that see his past reports, where the UN says they're going to put 600 million people in
[37:56.680 --> 38:01.080]  the U.S. as replacement populations.
[38:01.080 --> 38:08.480]  And with Macron saying 200 million from Africa into, of course, France.
[38:08.480 --> 38:16.360]  Those articles are all up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[38:16.360 --> 38:24.360]  In fact, let me just read to you from those right now, revealed, UN plan to fund America,
[38:24.360 --> 38:31.360]  to flood America, revealed, UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[38:31.360 --> 38:39.240]  By 2050, 73% of population would be immigrants or their descendants, a 2001 UN strategy document
[38:39.240 --> 38:43.400]  and getting fresh attention in light of the migrant crisis because it outlines the need
[38:43.400 --> 38:47.920]  to flood America and Europe with hundreds of millions of migrants in order to maintain
[38:47.920 --> 38:49.880]  population levels.
[38:49.880 --> 38:56.600]  Entitled replacement migration is a solution to declining and aging populations.
[38:56.600 --> 39:01.960]  The plan seeks to offset population decline and population aging resulting from low fertility
[39:01.960 --> 39:10.000]  and mortality rates, so they tell people in the U.S. don't have kids, but then they bring
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.800]  in third-world populations who are first brainwashed for six months at refugee camps and then taken
[39:14.800 --> 39:19.660]  control of by socialist, communist, anti-fund democratic parties.
[39:19.660 --> 39:25.040]  It concedes that mass migration to the West is needed for governments to maintain established
[39:25.040 --> 39:27.680]  economic, social, and political policies and programs.
[39:27.680 --> 39:32.560]  The strategy document sets out six potential scenarios for each country or region of the
[39:32.560 --> 39:35.080]  world necessary to meet the goal.
[39:35.080 --> 39:39.640]  Under the most severe scenario, large numbers of migrants will be required to maintain the
[39:39.640 --> 39:41.680]  population support ratio.
[39:41.680 --> 39:46.520]  How is 600 million in the U.S. alone maintaining the 340 million?
[39:46.520 --> 39:50.960]  No, they are politically supercharged with hate, they are brought in, and they are taught
[39:50.960 --> 39:56.000]  that white people are evil, turn on any channel, any show, it's all you see.
[39:56.000 --> 40:02.120]  And just today, without even looking, uncle of Italian girl murdered by migrants from
[40:02.120 --> 40:08.360]  Nigeria threatens to show photos of her dismembered body of immigration laws are loosened.
[40:08.360 --> 40:14.320]  Ethiopian national stabs to death random white girl walking her dogs in D.C. because she
[40:14.320 --> 40:15.480]  was white.
[40:15.480 --> 40:21.000]  This is every day by the hundreds, the fire bombings, the killings, the mass grooming,
[40:21.000 --> 40:29.200]  and this is all targeting white people, westerners, and the U.N. is brainwashing them to do this
[40:29.200 --> 40:30.720]  before they come in.
[40:30.720 --> 40:35.040]  They're even giving them hand grenades, there's hand grenade attacks every day in Europe now
[40:35.040 --> 40:39.720]  where the Islamists will throw hand grenades into white families at picnic tables.
[40:39.720 --> 40:44.920]  All of this is being done to completely destroy the West and why?
[40:44.920 --> 40:48.320]  Because the megacorporations already dominate the third world and already use it.
[40:48.320 --> 40:51.720]  If they can dominate the first world and destroy the Renaissance, they win.
[40:51.720 --> 40:56.080]  We did get Paul Joseph Watson connected, we're going to come back to him on the other side
[40:56.080 --> 41:02.760]  to get into Hong Kong, what he witnessed, but also this big report up on drudgereport.com
[41:02.760 --> 41:03.920]  that is so critical.
[41:03.920 --> 41:06.880]  I know you as an audience know about the U.N. takeover plan.
[41:06.880 --> 41:12.000]  I know you're aware of this whole globalist operation, but if you don't get this to everyone
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.920]  you know, then they're not going to understand the big picture, so I appreciate Paul getting
[41:16.920 --> 41:22.800]  this article out today, but we're going to add to it for him, or he'll do it.
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.880]  Where the U.N. says it's part of a plan to overturn the West and where it's part of a
[41:26.880 --> 41:32.600]  plan to replace the population in their own admissions, that's something that the globalist
[41:32.600 --> 41:36.440]  and Snopes said, well, it's a real document, but they don't really plan to do that.
[41:36.440 --> 41:37.600]  They are doing it.
[41:37.600 --> 41:39.120]  They don't want this out.
[41:39.120 --> 41:41.120]  This is critical information.
[41:41.120 --> 41:45.600]  You've got to get these articles out right now.
[41:45.600 --> 41:50.680]  It's so critical, and the same U.N. system says overthrow Russia for the Islamics, overthrow
[41:50.680 --> 41:56.040]  Israel for the Islamics, and they've got the left chomping at the bit wanting to get Israel,
[41:56.040 --> 42:01.140]  so they're accepting this worldwide against every Western nation state and saying Israel's
[42:01.140 --> 42:03.840]  mainly white, so it deserves to be overthrown.
[42:03.840 --> 42:07.480]  That was even on Bill Maher, had guessed on saying that two weeks ago, and Bill Maher
[42:07.480 --> 42:08.480]  disagreed.
[42:08.480 --> 42:14.520]  Now Ilhan Omar and Tlaib stayed boycott Bill Maher for saying that white people should
[42:14.520 --> 42:15.520]  be able to live.
[42:15.520 --> 42:21.120]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[42:21.120 --> 42:25.760]  One half of the incredible eight-pack power stack, the AM Wake Up and Work packet is exactly
[42:25.760 --> 42:27.720]  what you need to start your day right.
[42:27.720 --> 42:32.280]  The pack contains five original formulas built to fuel your day and take care of your body's

[42:36.880 --> 42:37.880]  and more.
[42:37.880 --> 42:43.120]  The PM pack contains a flex and joint support, energy kickstart, krill oil, neutropic brain,
[42:43.120 --> 42:45.360]  and greens detox formula.
[42:45.360 --> 42:51.080]  With the PM pack in the eight-pack power stack, you can rest easy and simplify your routine.
[42:51.080 --> 42:55.600]  Containing four original formulas, the PM rest and recover pack will build up your body's
[42:55.600 --> 43:00.160]  defenses and help you get restful, satisfying sleep every night.
[43:00.160 --> 43:04.600]  Containing bone support, krill oil, sound sleep, and immune support formulas, the PM
[43:04.600 --> 43:09.200]  packet was created to support improving your body's bones and immune system, all while
[43:09.200 --> 43:10.920]  you rest from the day's work.
[43:10.920 --> 43:14.960]  When combined with the AM Wake Up and Work packet, it makes the eight-pack power stack
[43:14.960 --> 43:21.080]  the new Can't Miss InfoWars Life product.
[43:21.080 --> 43:26.200]  An InfoWarier fan favorite formula, Survival Shield X2, continues to lead the way into

[44:27.760 --> 44:32.800]  are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[44:32.800 --> 44:36.560]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[44:36.560 --> 44:43.480]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared
[44:43.480 --> 44:46.680]  to stay strong when the system fails.
[44:46.680 --> 44:52.720]  The system is vulnerable, electricity could be gone in an instant, and grocery stores

[45:31.680 --> 45:32.680]  Kansas anymore.
[45:32.680 --> 45:40.040]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[45:40.040 --> 45:43.680]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam, because it's a form
[45:43.680 --> 45:44.680]  of fascism.
[45:44.680 --> 45:49.240]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[45:49.240 --> 46:00.480]  Local online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[46:00.480 --> 46:12.000]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.880]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[46:15.880 --> 46:25.080]  You can't watch this, the movie available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[46:25.080 --> 46:46.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[46:46.720 --> 46:52.640]  I'm watching the midterms, then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[46:52.640 --> 47:00.360]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[47:00.360 --> 47:05.520]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[47:05.520 --> 47:27.040]  Who won the president?
[47:27.040 --> 47:42.100]  And then you would think everybody in the countries is like to the bunker
[47:42.100 --> 47:58.520]  And folks get in the footage of African migrant invaders attacking federal police on the Guatemala
[47:58.520 --> 48:00.020]  Mexico border viciously.
[48:00.020 --> 48:03.900]  We're going to be playing some of that coming up in a moment.
[48:03.900 --> 48:11.700]  Paul Joseph Watson just got back from Hong Kong and he's saying, oh, this ties together.
[48:11.700 --> 48:17.220]  The UN invasion, the UN saying open the borders, the UN saying, let us run your border system.
[48:17.220 --> 48:20.460]  Let us build refugee centers in the US like we've done in Europe.
[48:20.460 --> 48:21.940]  This is all a plan.
[48:21.940 --> 48:27.700]  Paul Joseph Watson's story is top-linked up on the right hand side of DrudgeReport.com.
[48:27.700 --> 48:28.700]  Critical to get that out.
[48:28.700 --> 48:32.420]  Paul, wow, so much happened in Hong Kong.
[48:32.420 --> 48:36.180]  You are now here back in the UK.
[48:36.180 --> 48:37.380]  This all ties together.
[48:37.380 --> 48:39.060]  Where do you want to start first?
[48:39.060 --> 48:44.980]  Well, it ties together, Alex, on three continents because you have that quote from Ilhan Omar
[48:44.980 --> 48:48.100]  talking about the UN's plan to take over the US border.
[48:48.100 --> 48:52.140]  We know they called for 600 million migrants who went to America by 2050.
[48:52.140 --> 48:54.700]  That report was our exclusive as well.
[48:54.700 --> 48:59.740]  In Europe, on a different continent, you have the collapse of Salvini's government.
[48:59.740 --> 49:04.580]  He was the one guy at the fulcrum of preventing the migrant crisis in Europe.
[49:04.580 --> 49:08.340]  He basically stopped the migrant crisis, at least at the level it was at.
[49:08.340 --> 49:09.340]  Back governments now collapse.
[49:09.340 --> 49:14.460]  They've got a coalition with the center-left party and the five-star movement, so Salvini's
[49:14.460 --> 49:19.220]  now out of power until 2023, I believe.
[49:19.220 --> 49:23.220]  Trump has already praised Conte, the left wing of the new prime minister.
[49:23.220 --> 49:26.580]  So he didn't have Salvini's back, unfortunately.
[49:26.580 --> 49:31.820]  And then in Hong Kong, as we saw this week, Alex, and this is not being reported by any
[49:31.820 --> 49:35.700]  media that I've seen, but this is what the protesters who we spoke to on the ground
[49:35.700 --> 49:41.260]  are saying, that one of the primary reasons why they're protesting is resentment against
[49:41.260 --> 49:43.380]  immigration from mainland China.
[49:43.380 --> 49:48.660]  And it's even worse than immigration into Europe, because not only do they get immediate
[49:48.660 --> 49:54.420]  access to the jobs market, to housing benefits, to health care benefits, by order of the Chinese
[49:54.420 --> 50:00.020]  government, basically, coming from the mainland into Hong Kong with a totally different culture,
[50:00.020 --> 50:01.740]  very different from what you would expect.
[50:01.740 --> 50:05.820]  You would expect them to have a very similar culture, but they don't, according to the
[50:05.820 --> 50:07.380]  protesters in Hong Kong.
[50:07.380 --> 50:10.060]  And Alex, they're allowed to vote.
[50:10.060 --> 50:14.900]  So imagine having millions of migrants coming over from Mexico, and they immediately get
[50:14.900 --> 50:17.900]  the right to vote, and guess what they vote for?
[50:17.900 --> 50:20.980]  They vote for more power for Beijing.
[50:20.980 --> 50:26.220]  So you've already got this tenuous situation in Hong Kong, where the leader of Hong Kong
[50:26.220 --> 50:28.140]  has to be approved by Beijing.
[50:28.140 --> 50:34.900]  Half of the executive body is pro-China, and now you're getting tons of Chinese immigrants
[50:34.900 --> 50:39.460]  moving into Hong Kong, voting against the interests of the Hong Kong people.
[50:39.460 --> 50:45.180]  That is one of the primary reasons why they're out on the street protesting, and no mainstream
[50:45.180 --> 50:47.340]  media outlet will talk about it.
[50:47.340 --> 50:49.860]  Isn't that a surprise?
[50:49.860 --> 50:52.460]  And Paul, let me add this, because this is so critical.
[50:52.460 --> 50:53.460]  China is unelected.
[50:53.460 --> 50:58.140]  In 1949, communist overthrew what's left of it at the end of World War II.
[50:58.140 --> 51:00.820]  Start killing tens of millions of people right away.
[51:00.820 --> 51:05.380]  Anybody that had a job, or a company, or who was smart, who could run, ran to Hong Kong,
[51:05.380 --> 51:06.460]  ran to Taiwan.
[51:06.460 --> 51:09.860]  That was 70 years ago, right now, it's the seventh anniversary, coming up here in just
[51:09.860 --> 51:11.540]  a few weeks, as you know.
[51:11.540 --> 51:14.540]  Chinese armored vehicles are now entering as we speak today.
[51:14.540 --> 51:17.660]  That's confirmed, so the troops are now starting to roll in.
[51:17.660 --> 51:23.420]  But Hong Kong has elections and representative democracy, so the Chinese move in, and then
[51:23.420 --> 51:26.900]  use that to vote them under Chinese control.
[51:26.900 --> 51:31.380]  And now the government, as you know, two years ago, got voted under Chinese control, right
[51:31.380 --> 51:37.100]  as the new bridge the Chinese built, the biggest in the world, from the mainland was completed,
[51:37.100 --> 51:41.580]  which they promised would never be used as an invasion point, and it's now being used
[51:41.580 --> 51:42.740]  as an invasion point.
[51:42.740 --> 51:45.380]  We're showing the armored vehicles coming in right now.
[51:45.380 --> 51:47.980]  I mean, this is incredible.
[51:47.980 --> 51:52.140]  Just like the Democrats are using illegal aliens from around the world to come in, to be given
[51:52.140 --> 51:56.060]  driver's license, to then vote and checkmate us as well.
[51:56.060 --> 52:00.940]  Precisely, and the key problem is they don't integrate, just like in Europe, they don't
[52:00.940 --> 52:01.940]  integrate.
[52:01.940 --> 52:05.780]  We're told that, you know, we need these giant numbers of immigrants in order to fund the
[52:05.780 --> 52:08.380]  pension funds, the social security system.
[52:08.380 --> 52:13.060]  In Europe, the majority of them immediately go on welfare, they don't pay tax.
[52:13.060 --> 52:18.260]  And meanwhile, we're being told as white westerners not to have children, so they're deliberately
[52:18.260 --> 52:22.380]  driving down our population and saying we need these to replace us.
[52:22.380 --> 52:27.260]  And yet in China, you have a situation, for example, where as a foreigner, you try to get
[52:27.260 --> 52:33.380]  a taxi on some occasions, driven by a Chinese immigrant, they're refusing to take foreigners
[52:33.380 --> 52:34.380]  in their own taxes.
[52:34.380 --> 52:41.620]  So it's like reverse discrimination, Alex, I posted a photo on Twitter, dozens of taxis
[52:41.620 --> 52:45.900]  driving through the streets of Hong Kong while these mass protests are taking place, waving
[52:45.900 --> 52:49.420]  giant Chinese flags out the back of their vehicles.
[52:49.420 --> 52:54.340]  So they brought the migrants in, they're voting against the interests of the Hong Kong people
[52:54.340 --> 52:59.380]  and discriminating against Hong Kong people and westerners in Hong Kong.
[52:59.380 --> 53:03.620]  The other aspect, Alex, is this whole anti-surveillance movement.
[53:03.620 --> 53:08.860]  Another key plank of the protest movement in Hong Kong is against mass surveillance.
[53:08.860 --> 53:13.340]  They're concerned about the Chinese social credit score being introduced there.
[53:13.340 --> 53:18.620]  That's why they've got lasers pointed at all the cameras to stop the facial recognition.
[53:18.620 --> 53:23.140]  That's why they literally tore down these smart lamps, which have been put up all over
[53:23.140 --> 53:24.140]  the city.
[53:24.140 --> 53:28.580]  The government, the pro-Beijing government claims it's to measure air quality.
[53:28.580 --> 53:33.620]  The protest does actually say there for facial tracking surveillance to tie into ultimately
[53:33.620 --> 53:36.340]  the Chinese social credit score system.
[53:36.340 --> 53:41.020]  So a fundamental plank of these protests is against big brother, against surveillance,
[53:41.020 --> 53:46.540]  they're waving US flags, they're calling on Trump to support them, they're even carrying
[53:46.540 --> 53:48.980]  around Pepe memes.
[53:48.980 --> 53:51.180]  So this is not a left-wing protest.
[53:51.180 --> 53:54.740]  They've been discredited as far right, they're not far right.
[53:54.740 --> 53:59.780]  The left in America has tried to tie all this into their obsession with the culture war.
[53:59.780 --> 54:02.340]  There is really no left and right in Hong Kong.
[54:02.340 --> 54:07.620]  It's classic authoritarianism versus liberty, and that's what they're protesting for.
[54:07.620 --> 54:12.500]  And again, the big brother surveillance system that we've largely accepted in the West.
[54:12.500 --> 54:14.860]  Paul, this is beyond a movie.
[54:14.860 --> 54:16.580]  This is really sensational.
[54:16.580 --> 54:18.900]  This is 1776 type stuff.
[54:18.900 --> 54:20.620]  This is Magna Carta type stuff.
[54:20.620 --> 54:25.380]  And of course, for hundreds of years, the British have been in Hong Kong, and just like we
[54:25.380 --> 54:29.820]  got our Bill of Rights out of Magna Carta, they have some of those similar systems.
[54:29.820 --> 54:36.380]  They've had hundreds of years of basic freedom versus 70 years of communist mass murder re-education
[54:36.380 --> 54:37.380]  camps.
[54:37.380 --> 54:39.780]  And of course, the two groups are incompatible.
[54:39.780 --> 54:44.260]  China, as you know, has about 12 different ethnic groups that don't get along with each
[54:44.260 --> 54:47.580]  other, even though genetically they're basically the same people.
[54:47.580 --> 54:54.180]  So this is Asian not wanting Asian to come in and overturn the place they built, one
[54:54.180 --> 54:58.620]  of the most successful islands in the world, and they don't want to be usurped, and they
[54:58.620 --> 55:01.780]  don't want to be spied on, and they don't want their children to grow up or they can
[55:01.780 --> 55:03.860]  be secretly arrested and disappeared.
[55:03.860 --> 55:05.020]  We should be with them.
[55:05.020 --> 55:06.420]  We should be standing with them.
[55:06.420 --> 55:10.900]  This isn't like some fake regime change that the globalists would be pushing in Syria or
[55:10.900 --> 55:11.900]  someplace.
[55:11.900 --> 55:12.900]  This is good.
[55:12.900 --> 55:13.900]  Precisely.
[55:13.900 --> 55:19.260]  And there are several ways in which it mirrors what's happening in the United States, Alex.
[55:19.260 --> 55:23.140]  Just as in the United States, we're now, you know, with Maxine Waters and everyone calling
[55:23.140 --> 55:28.980]  for Trump supporters, Trump cabinet members to be confronted in public at restaurants,
[55:28.980 --> 55:33.060]  people wearing MAGA hats assaulted on the street on a routine basis, they want to make
[55:33.060 --> 55:38.460]  it completely intolerable to support freedom and democracy in Hong Kong, to the point now
[55:38.460 --> 55:43.540]  where the police, the pro-Beijing authorities are working with triad gangs and criminal
[55:43.540 --> 55:48.700]  members to literally hunt down protest leaders in the streets, and there's a Financial Times
[55:48.700 --> 55:53.700]  article about this today, and beat them up to prevent them from organizing in and taking
[55:53.700 --> 55:55.060]  part in protests.
[55:55.060 --> 55:57.260]  So it's really an across the board thing.
[55:57.260 --> 56:02.460]  To give you an example of the control over information and propaganda that Beijing has
[56:02.460 --> 56:07.980]  in Hong Kong and in the mainland, we went to a local Catholic church and talked to a
[56:07.980 --> 56:12.300]  priest who didn't want to be on record, didn't want to be on camera because he would be,
[56:12.300 --> 56:14.660]  he'd face obvious repercussions.
[56:14.660 --> 56:21.300]  He said that the religious education control in China is now so strict, so locked down
[56:21.300 --> 56:26.780]  that many Chinese people have never even heard of Jesus Christ.
[56:26.780 --> 56:31.660]  That how much authoritarianism and control of information there is in China, the social
[56:31.660 --> 56:35.940]  credit score, and it's exactly what's being introduced in America out.
[56:35.940 --> 56:40.940]  You've got CNN today saying, oh, isn't it horrible that the Chinese government, the
[56:40.940 --> 56:46.500]  Hong Kong authorities, are considering banning social media, the platforming protest organizers,
[56:46.500 --> 56:51.540]  and that's the exact same thing they've been lobbying for against dissidents in the West
[56:51.540 --> 56:53.380]  for the past two years plus.
[56:53.380 --> 56:56.180]  Oh, but it's bad when it happens in Hong Kong.
[56:56.180 --> 56:57.180]  Complete him off.
[56:57.180 --> 56:58.180]  Stay in attack formation.
[56:58.180 --> 56:59.500]  This is incredible radio.
[56:59.500 --> 57:00.500]  This is in fiction.
[57:00.500 --> 57:01.500]  It's not Netflix.
[57:01.500 --> 57:02.500]  It's happening.
[57:02.500 --> 57:04.500]  A global info war for human freedom.
[57:04.500 --> 57:07.500]  There is a for freedom there against it.
[57:07.500 --> 57:09.500]  No, they're right back.
[57:09.500 --> 57:12.740]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[57:12.740 --> 57:13.740]  I've been so busy.
[57:13.740 --> 57:17.420]  I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news, but it's very exciting.
[57:17.420 --> 57:19.740]  It's super silver skin cream.
[57:19.740 --> 57:23.580]  It's got all of these benefits, too many to mention, but it's revolutionary.
[57:23.580 --> 57:24.580]  It's brand new.
[57:24.580 --> 57:25.580]  People are going to love it.
[57:25.580 --> 57:27.500]  Introducing the new super silver skin cream.

[57:33.180 --> 57:35.420]  It helps reduce wrinkles and keep your skin healthy.

[57:40.260 --> 57:44.300]  and health clinics to kill off everything from Mercer to Candida fungus.
[57:44.300 --> 57:49.220]  It's also loaded with the best natural ingredients for your skin like coconut oil, vitamin E,

[58:12.260 --> 58:16.180]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[58:16.180 --> 58:20.700]  The other thing that's unique about Infowars is it is the only network of this reach that
[58:20.700 --> 58:23.940]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[58:23.940 --> 58:27.780]  That's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by secret foreign government.
[58:27.780 --> 58:29.780]  It is completely independent of all that.
[58:29.780 --> 58:35.500]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[58:35.500 --> 58:39.340]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[58:39.340 --> 58:40.340]  the country.
[58:40.340 --> 58:44.140]  They actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this
[58:44.140 --> 58:45.660]  was the kind of press they wanted.
[58:45.660 --> 58:49.060]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big
[58:49.060 --> 58:53.060]  corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[58:53.060 --> 58:57.020]  what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear.
[58:57.020 --> 58:59.260]  And the Infowars audience has broken through that.
[58:59.260 --> 59:03.540]  The idea that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American
[59:03.540 --> 59:04.540]  democracy and freedom.
[59:04.540 --> 59:08.940]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the blackwarming defamation,
[59:08.940 --> 59:38.780]  lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[59:38.940 --> 59:46.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, if I seem excited and on the edge of my seat, India has invaded
[59:46.940 --> 59:47.940]  Kashmir.
[59:47.940 --> 59:51.940]  China is rolling troops into Hong Kong.
[59:51.940 --> 59:57.300]  The Democrats are all over the news saying burn down cities, kill Trump supporters, burn
[59:57.300 --> 59:58.300]  down their buildings.
[59:58.300 --> 1:00:00.980]  I mean this is on MSNBC.
[1:00:00.980 --> 1:00:04.020]  The UN plan is flooding our borders.
[1:00:04.020 --> 1:00:07.460]  The left is invoking the migrants to kill white people.
[1:00:07.460 --> 1:00:10.060]  It's happening everywhere.
[1:00:10.060 --> 1:00:12.780]  Giant child kidnapping rings.
[1:00:12.780 --> 1:00:18.340]  You cannot make this up and it's only getting crazier by the minute.
[1:00:18.340 --> 1:00:19.620]  But humanity is waking up.
[1:00:19.620 --> 1:00:24.380]  And again, it's not that people from Africa or Latin America or Asia are bad people.
[1:00:24.380 --> 1:00:29.300]  It's the ones that UN brainwashes in these camps are low educated, bottom of the barrel,
[1:00:29.300 --> 1:00:34.700]  brainwashed for six months, then shipped in to the west to literally run around like wild
[1:00:34.700 --> 1:00:36.980]  animals killing people.
[1:00:36.980 --> 1:00:42.420]  And this plan is to bring down civilization and have a global civil war.
[1:00:42.420 --> 1:00:44.420]  Paul, we're in a civil war right now.
[1:00:44.420 --> 1:00:45.940]  Yeah, let's play the audio of this.
[1:00:45.940 --> 1:00:50.500]  In fact, we'll get to this next segment, but this is just yesterday in Mexico.
[1:00:50.500 --> 1:00:57.860]  This is Africans from Africa by the thousands shipped in by the UN and dumped out in Guatemala
[1:00:57.860 --> 1:00:59.460]  attacking Mexican police.
[1:00:59.460 --> 1:01:04.580]  I mean, this isn't supposed to be happening, but this is the UN.
[1:01:04.580 --> 1:01:10.260]  So this is a global civil war between nation states who aren't perfect and the global corporations
[1:01:10.260 --> 1:01:14.740]  of the UN who admit, Paul, you have all the documents, I have all the documents.
[1:01:14.740 --> 1:01:17.260]  People need to know this is a plan.
[1:01:17.260 --> 1:01:18.260]  Can you elaborate on that?
[1:01:18.260 --> 1:01:20.300]  We'll get back into Hong Kong next segment.
[1:01:20.300 --> 1:01:26.300]  But this is how you take over countries is collapsing borders and migration.
[1:01:26.300 --> 1:01:32.940]  No, we've seen that especially in London where there's basically a stabbing every night
[1:01:32.940 --> 1:01:37.060]  now, a mass stabbing five minutes from where I live, there were two stabbings over the
[1:01:37.060 --> 1:01:38.060]  past two weeks.
[1:01:38.060 --> 1:01:44.740]  And again, when you look into it, 73% of the people responsible are from what they call
[1:01:44.740 --> 1:01:47.220]  BAME ethnic minority groups.
[1:01:47.220 --> 1:01:51.860]  The immigrants who came in from the Congo and these really violent areas of Africa are
[1:01:51.860 --> 1:01:57.900]  so violent that the local crime gangs had to step up their levels of violence simply
[1:01:57.900 --> 1:02:02.100]  to compete in these postcode turf wars in London.
[1:02:02.100 --> 1:02:07.380]  And that's what you're seeing right now where we're at a point now in London where Somalian
[1:02:07.380 --> 1:02:12.380]  migrants are sending their own children back to Somalia because they say it's safer for
[1:02:12.380 --> 1:02:15.580]  them in Somalia than it is in London.
[1:02:15.580 --> 1:02:17.820]  These are the joys of diversity, Alex.
[1:02:17.820 --> 1:02:21.340]  And again, that's one of the things they're protesting about in Hong Kong.
[1:02:21.340 --> 1:02:23.700]  They're also flying American flags.
[1:02:23.700 --> 1:02:26.300]  People keep asking why they're flying American flags.
[1:02:26.300 --> 1:02:29.380]  Very simple because it represents liberty and democracy.
[1:02:29.380 --> 1:02:34.340]  Unlike in Portland where snarling, spitting leftists burn the American flag.
[1:02:34.340 --> 1:02:36.860]  In Hong Kong, they actually venerate it.
[1:02:36.860 --> 1:02:42.540]  Unlike in Portland and these kind of areas where your crew are attacked and defamed and
[1:02:42.540 --> 1:02:47.780]  viciously snarl that in person, the protesters in Hong Kong, although they might dress similar
[1:02:47.780 --> 1:02:53.220]  to Antifa with the blackout of the schemas and whatever, they're the most kind polite
[1:02:53.220 --> 1:02:55.060]  people you could ever imagine.
[1:02:55.060 --> 1:02:58.220]  But if you piss them off, they will come against you.
[1:02:58.220 --> 1:03:00.940]  Many protesters are like nothing else I've seen.
[1:03:00.940 --> 1:03:06.260]  The levels of courage that they have to go up against, rubber bullets, tear gas.
[1:03:06.260 --> 1:03:09.740]  I mean, they were even teargassing them inside shopping malls.
[1:03:09.740 --> 1:03:14.580]  It was absolutely incredible what we witnessed in the streets of Hong Kong.
[1:03:14.580 --> 1:03:17.060]  And again, they're flying the American flag.
[1:03:17.060 --> 1:03:21.980]  They're not protesting, Alex, like the left does in America, the rights that they already
[1:03:21.980 --> 1:03:28.060]  have, like these gay pride marches, just so they can take a selfie and put it on Instagram.
[1:03:28.060 --> 1:03:32.780]  They're literally going up against one of the most feared military regimes on the planet
[1:03:32.780 --> 1:03:38.140]  that flattens people with tanks if they stand up against them, that puts a million minority
[1:03:38.140 --> 1:03:42.740]  members in reeducation camps wanting to take over Hong Kong.
[1:03:42.740 --> 1:03:44.620]  This is not the first protest of its kind.
[1:03:44.620 --> 1:03:50.340]  This has been going on in Hong Kong solidly year after year for the past 20 years or so,
[1:03:50.340 --> 1:03:52.940]  and it really seems to be coming to the fore now, Alex.
[1:03:52.940 --> 1:03:56.900]  But just to compare these protesters to what you see in America with the chicken necked
[1:03:56.900 --> 1:04:01.740]  Tantea for thugs, if you put them up against the Hong Kong protesters, they wouldn't stand
[1:04:01.740 --> 1:04:02.740]  the chance.
[1:04:02.740 --> 1:04:06.460]  That's right, because the anti-futile love the Chai comms.
[1:04:06.460 --> 1:04:07.460]  They love evil.
[1:04:07.460 --> 1:04:09.700]  That's like their mascot is a G, the dictator.
[1:04:09.700 --> 1:04:13.020]  We'll be back and talk about the armored personnel carriers now entering Hong Kong.
[1:04:13.020 --> 1:04:16.020]  Looks like we got our reporters out in the nick of time.
[1:04:16.020 --> 1:04:18.020]  Stay with us.
[1:04:18.020 --> 1:04:19.020]  Alex.
[1:04:19.020 --> 1:04:20.020]  Yes.
[1:04:20.020 --> 1:04:22.620]  I got a plug for the Patriot points I get.
[1:04:22.620 --> 1:04:23.620]  Oh, thanks.
[1:04:23.620 --> 1:04:26.620]  I got $180 so far this year, and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[1:04:26.620 --> 1:04:29.780]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[1:04:29.780 --> 1:04:32.460]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't
[1:04:32.460 --> 1:04:33.460]  believe in.
[1:04:33.460 --> 1:04:34.460]  So I'd rather give that money to you.
[1:04:34.460 --> 1:04:35.460]  And they're getting quality products.
[1:04:35.460 --> 1:04:38.220]  The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[1:04:38.220 --> 1:04:40.540]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me.
[1:04:40.540 --> 1:04:41.540]  I've lost weight.
[1:04:41.540 --> 1:04:42.540]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[1:04:42.540 --> 1:04:44.820]  My kids, they use the toothpaste.
[1:04:44.820 --> 1:04:49.060]  My son used to get these little sore throats, and he puts X2 in water and drinks it, and
[1:04:49.060 --> 1:04:50.060]  it gets rid of his sore throat.
[1:04:50.060 --> 1:04:52.060]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[1:04:52.060 --> 1:04:53.540]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[1:04:53.540 --> 1:04:54.540]  I want a good price.
[1:04:54.540 --> 1:04:58.740]  But I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[1:04:58.740 --> 1:05:01.140]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off.
[1:05:01.140 --> 1:05:04.780]  And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:05.780]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[1:05:05.780 --> 1:05:09.740]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss leader
[1:05:09.740 --> 1:05:13.700]  because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship, then we're doing
[1:05:13.700 --> 1:05:14.700]  50% off.
[1:05:14.700 --> 1:05:17.500]  And then you do something like that, where you have Patriot points, we lose money.
[1:05:17.500 --> 1:05:18.500]  But that's okay.
[1:05:18.500 --> 1:05:36.380]  Let's get some support.
[1:05:36.380 --> 1:05:38.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here back live.
[1:05:38.620 --> 1:05:43.940]  We have just had an astounding last hour armored vehicles by the hundreds and thousands
[1:05:43.940 --> 1:05:49.100]  of Chinese troops are now entering into Hong Kong on the biggest bridge in the world,
[1:05:49.100 --> 1:05:52.460]  the longest bridge in the world, built in the last two years.
[1:05:52.460 --> 1:05:55.820]  So the Chinese military is now invading.
[1:05:55.820 --> 1:06:02.900]  I felt a disturbance in the force two days ago and I called Paul and I called Greg, Reese
[1:06:02.900 --> 1:06:06.940]  and Savannah Hernandez and everybody and I said, get the hell out of there.
[1:06:06.940 --> 1:06:10.940]  They're like, although the word is the Chinese military is not going to invade, the Chinese
[1:06:10.940 --> 1:06:12.180]  military is not going to invade.
[1:06:12.180 --> 1:06:15.300]  And I said, they're invading, get ready, get out of there.
[1:06:15.300 --> 1:06:19.220]  I have the text messages because I know how commies operate.
[1:06:19.220 --> 1:06:23.460]  If they tell you they're not going to invade and the invasion isn't imminent, you know,
[1:06:23.460 --> 1:06:24.460]  it's going to happen.
[1:06:24.460 --> 1:06:28.580]  Paul Watson was there just 24 hours ago.
[1:06:28.580 --> 1:06:31.940]  He just got back to London, England and we're going to go back to him in just a moment.
[1:06:31.940 --> 1:06:34.540]  But this is so huge.
[1:06:34.540 --> 1:06:35.540]  I didn't plug last time.
[1:06:35.540 --> 1:06:36.540]  I'm going to plug right now.
[1:06:36.540 --> 1:06:41.540]  We're running two huge mega specials introducing the new super silver skin cream that's got
[1:06:41.540 --> 1:06:44.820]  the hyaluronic acid that the women and everybody absolutely love.
[1:06:44.820 --> 1:06:47.100]  It's so good for your skin.
[1:06:47.100 --> 1:06:49.780]  It's high quality hyaluronic acid.
[1:06:49.780 --> 1:06:56.580]  Then it's got all of these different great vitamins and minerals in it as well.
[1:06:56.580 --> 1:06:59.260]  It's BPA free.
[1:06:59.260 --> 1:07:00.260]  But here's the key.
[1:07:00.260 --> 1:07:09.060]  It's got the patented nano silver salt technology skin cream inside the skin cream.
[1:07:09.060 --> 1:07:10.060]  It has that.
[1:07:10.060 --> 1:07:14.620]  It's 10 times more effective than similar products containing up to 3,000 ppm silver.
[1:07:14.620 --> 1:07:17.460]  It's only 20 ppm silver because of the patented system.
[1:07:17.460 --> 1:07:23.900]  It's the same silver that is in the FDA approved for over the counter and use in medical facilities.
[1:07:23.900 --> 1:07:27.500]  Silver super silver wound dressing gel.
[1:07:27.500 --> 1:07:29.340]  We're able to private label this.
[1:07:29.340 --> 1:07:33.020]  No one else is because the owners of this company are fans.
[1:07:33.020 --> 1:07:37.580]  And so again, we now worked with them in the last year to develop a whole new product line
[1:07:37.580 --> 1:07:38.940]  that we're explicitly putting out.
[1:07:38.940 --> 1:07:43.080]  They're kind of beta testing with us that is skin cream.
[1:07:43.080 --> 1:07:46.660]  So it's an antibiotic healthy natural skin cream.
[1:07:46.660 --> 1:07:47.660]  It's so revolutionary.
[1:07:47.660 --> 1:07:48.660]  Here's the great point.
[1:07:48.660 --> 1:07:52.460]  It's $7 for the little tube, $14 for the big tube.
[1:07:52.460 --> 1:07:56.140]  Just hyaluronic acid of this quality would be 30 bucks.
[1:07:56.140 --> 1:07:59.700]  You know some place like Ulta or something because they mark it up four or five times.
[1:07:59.700 --> 1:08:01.860]  Which I get it takes money to run operations.
[1:08:01.860 --> 1:08:03.860]  That's not our model.
[1:08:03.860 --> 1:08:05.020]  That's not how we do it.
[1:08:05.020 --> 1:08:09.940]  So it's available 25% off out of the gates at infowarstore.com, but it's already going
[1:08:09.940 --> 1:08:10.940]  to sell out very soon.
[1:08:10.940 --> 1:08:14.820]  So we're going to have to end that special at the end of the weekend.
[1:08:14.820 --> 1:08:16.220]  There's another big special.
[1:08:16.220 --> 1:08:24.380]  Nine days left to get DNA Force Plus at 50% off with the PQQ, the CoQ10, all the rest
[1:08:24.380 --> 1:08:25.380]  of it.
[1:08:25.380 --> 1:08:29.180]  What it does for your cells, your body, your energy, your brain.
[1:08:29.180 --> 1:08:30.180]  It's everything.
[1:08:30.180 --> 1:08:33.180]  It's the basis, the building block for all the other supplements and other things you
[1:08:33.180 --> 1:08:38.060]  do, like the things you eat, the things you drink, to overall purify and make all those
[1:08:38.060 --> 1:08:44.540]  building blocks work better and you get a free 90 count bottle of carnivore enzyme to
[1:08:44.540 --> 1:08:49.980]  help digest protein and fat and fluster stomach and guts out like nothing else can.
[1:08:49.980 --> 1:08:54.100]  It costs us $17 plus just to produce this bottle of carnivore.
[1:08:54.100 --> 1:08:56.700]  Why am I doing it even though we're close to selling out of carnivore?
[1:08:56.700 --> 1:09:01.700]  Because I need more money to order more carnivore for next year and I think you're going to
[1:09:01.700 --> 1:09:08.140]  think it's so amazing that you're going to become a steady buyer of carnivore at $30.
[1:09:08.140 --> 1:09:14.180]  So we make 13 bucks on it, but right now it's a $17 plus value free with super male
[1:09:14.180 --> 1:09:19.140]  vitality and of course DNA Force Plus.
[1:09:19.140 --> 1:09:23.740]  But that's only while the bottles of carnivore last and there's only 2,000 or so at the
[1:09:23.740 --> 1:09:29.060]  30 count, a little more than 2,000 of the 90 count that you get with these and so when
[1:09:29.060 --> 1:09:34.660]  they're gone, nine days left in FullWarsStore.com and that's how we financed, sending camera
[1:09:34.660 --> 1:09:40.060]  guy and reporters to Hong Kong for a week to bring you all of that world exclusive footage.
[1:09:40.060 --> 1:09:41.460]  So thank you for the support.
[1:09:41.460 --> 1:09:44.260]  Paul, you've got the floor for the rest of this segment.
[1:09:44.260 --> 1:09:49.820]  Recap how huge this is, armored vehicles now invading, already the motorcycle cops by the
[1:09:49.820 --> 1:09:54.660]  thousands, already leaders of the resistance being beaten half to death.
[1:09:54.660 --> 1:09:56.140]  This is so ominous.
[1:09:56.140 --> 1:10:00.260]  The CHICOM said, oh, we're not going to move in at least for a few weeks or months, maybe
[1:10:00.260 --> 1:10:01.260]  never.
[1:10:01.260 --> 1:10:05.300]  Now they're moving in, risking a new Tiananmen Square, a biblical proportions, Paul.
[1:10:05.300 --> 1:10:09.100]  A lot of experts and I agree with them say that if they have a new Tiananmen Square there
[1:10:09.100 --> 1:10:13.660]  in Hong Kong, they won't control it like they controlled 1989 and this could really
[1:10:13.660 --> 1:10:16.620]  send shock waves that could bring down the Communist Chinese party.
[1:10:16.620 --> 1:10:17.620]  What do you say?
[1:10:17.620 --> 1:10:23.020]  Well, yeah, you've got experts in Hong Kong saying it could bring down the entire capitalist
[1:10:23.020 --> 1:10:26.940]  system if they invade with tanks like with Tiananmen Square.
[1:10:26.940 --> 1:10:30.100]  What I didn't mention is the demands of the protesters, okay, they've got five demands.
[1:10:30.100 --> 1:10:35.300]  The primary demand is the withdrawal of this bill, which allows suspects in Hong Kong, which
[1:10:35.300 --> 1:10:38.860]  would be these protest leaders, to be extradited to China.
[1:10:38.860 --> 1:10:41.300]  They've only suspended it, they haven't withdrawn it.
[1:10:41.300 --> 1:10:46.060]  So now they're talking about martial law, basically, they're talking about forced seizure
[1:10:46.060 --> 1:10:50.180]  of property, where you can enter a property without a warrant, talking about terms of
[1:10:50.180 --> 1:10:55.260]  life imprisonment, and they're talking about censoring the media, which of course means
[1:10:55.260 --> 1:10:57.020]  social media.
[1:10:57.020 --> 1:11:00.860]  That's what the media in the West has lobbied for for the past two years, and they've got
[1:11:00.860 --> 1:11:03.740]  the nerve to call it out as being bad in Hong Kong.
[1:11:03.740 --> 1:11:08.100]  So you've got the martial law coming in, then as you mentioned today, you've got this garrison
[1:11:08.100 --> 1:11:12.980]  of Chinese troops within Hong Kong claiming they're just being routine maneuvers, while
[1:11:12.980 --> 1:11:16.980]  the PLA tanks roll through the streets.
[1:11:16.980 --> 1:11:18.420]  What's going to happen next, Alec?
[1:11:18.420 --> 1:11:23.860]  Well, in China, you've got this culture of saving face, of not being embarrassed.
[1:11:23.860 --> 1:11:27.740]  That's what the entire nation of China is founded around.
[1:11:27.740 --> 1:11:33.980]  October 1st is the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
[1:11:33.980 --> 1:11:38.740]  So everyone in Hong Kong, all the media is speculating that China has to get this under
[1:11:38.740 --> 1:11:43.100]  ramps, and if that includes violent repression, then so be it.
[1:11:43.100 --> 1:11:48.380]  Before the 1st of October, because they want to save face, and that's what it's all about.
[1:11:48.380 --> 1:11:54.900]  So on the flip side, the protesters are planning something absolutely massive on October 1st.
[1:11:54.900 --> 1:12:01.260]  So that could be the biggest protest slash riot yet, but it's definitely picking up steam.
[1:12:01.260 --> 1:12:05.380]  We were there on a weekend when water cannons were used for the first time.
[1:12:05.380 --> 1:12:08.260]  They were lobbing tear gas at protesters.
[1:12:08.260 --> 1:12:12.300]  Basically what happens, Alec, is they have a peaceful protest.
[1:12:12.300 --> 1:12:16.020]  The government then declares that any protest after that is banned.
[1:12:16.020 --> 1:12:17.940]  They bring in the riot cops.
[1:12:17.940 --> 1:12:19.780]  They posh back the protesters.
[1:12:19.780 --> 1:12:21.020]  They fire the tear gas.
[1:12:21.020 --> 1:12:23.060]  They fire the rubber bullets.
[1:12:23.060 --> 1:12:25.140]  Gregory's got all that footage.
[1:12:25.140 --> 1:12:26.620]  Savannah got tear gas.
[1:12:26.620 --> 1:12:28.580]  It was absolute bedlam.
[1:12:28.580 --> 1:12:33.340]  You had one medic who basically lost her eye because of a rubber bullet, and it only seems
[1:12:33.340 --> 1:12:34.860]  to be escalating.
[1:12:34.860 --> 1:12:40.660]  You got Chinese troops massing in nearby Shenzhen, which is so close to Hong Kong you
[1:12:40.660 --> 1:12:42.140]  wouldn't even believe it.
[1:12:42.140 --> 1:12:43.660]  So it's going to kick off.
[1:12:43.660 --> 1:12:46.340]  It's going to be sorted one way or the other.
[1:12:46.340 --> 1:12:51.540]  Before October 1st, the Hong Kong government has said it will not bow down to any of the
[1:12:51.540 --> 1:12:53.140]  protesters' demands.
[1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:55.140]  It never has in the past.
[1:12:55.140 --> 1:12:57.500]  These protesters, though, they're not stopping.
[1:12:57.500 --> 1:12:58.780]  We talk to them.
[1:12:58.780 --> 1:13:03.220]  Every single one said until the five demands are met, they are not stopping.
[1:13:03.220 --> 1:13:05.020]  They are going to be out on the streets.
[1:13:05.020 --> 1:13:08.860]  They're going to be battling the riot cops until the bitter end.
[1:13:08.860 --> 1:13:13.220]  So what's coming next could be a lot worse than what we've seen already, and it's chilling
[1:13:13.220 --> 1:13:14.740]  to think what could happen.
[1:13:14.740 --> 1:13:20.540]  Alex, given that Tiananmen Square, where they literally flattened people for wanting free
[1:13:20.540 --> 1:13:23.740]  speech in China, was only 30 years ago.
[1:13:23.740 --> 1:13:30.260]  Paul, again, it is being confirmed by Reuters and others as you were posting last night.
[1:13:30.260 --> 1:13:32.100]  Armored vehicles by the hundreds are entering.
[1:13:32.100 --> 1:13:34.660]  Chinese troops are entering Hong Kong right now.
[1:13:34.660 --> 1:13:39.860]  There have been increases in brutal attacks by mask men against demonstration leaders.
[1:13:39.860 --> 1:13:44.380]  It appears to be that Tiananmen Square Part 2 has already begun.
[1:13:44.380 --> 1:13:48.420]  They're already viciously attacking people with the motorcycle police.
[1:13:48.420 --> 1:13:53.100]  Armored vehicles and tanks, wheeled tanks are rolling in over the bridge.
[1:13:53.100 --> 1:13:58.660]  We have video of that into Hong Kong triggering a global crisis.
[1:13:58.660 --> 1:14:00.660]  Precisely.
[1:14:00.660 --> 1:14:05.620]  People need to realize this isn't just a hardcore group of protesters who are out protesting
[1:14:05.620 --> 1:14:06.620]  routinely.
[1:14:06.620 --> 1:14:08.740]  This is the entire population.
[1:14:08.740 --> 1:14:14.780]  The protesters supported by the clear majority of the Hong Kong population, and old people,
[1:14:14.780 --> 1:14:18.540]  middle-class people, it's mainly young people, but it's all across the board.
[1:14:18.540 --> 1:14:20.660]  This isn't just hardcore protesters.
[1:14:20.660 --> 1:14:23.460]  On the Friday night we were there the first day.
[1:14:23.460 --> 1:14:29.140]  They had a human chain, Alex, which stretched 30 miles around the entire city.
[1:14:29.140 --> 1:14:34.020]  They even went up mountains, and these were students, quite middle-class students.
[1:14:34.020 --> 1:14:38.780]  Some of them have been shopping for luxury clothing and brought their bags with them,
[1:14:38.780 --> 1:14:40.380]  forming this human chain.
[1:14:40.380 --> 1:14:41.380]  So this is widespread.
[1:14:41.380 --> 1:14:42.380]  Paul, let me stop you.
[1:14:42.380 --> 1:14:43.380]  Let me stop you.
[1:14:43.380 --> 1:14:46.380]  We're going to have to do part of one more segment, and then we'll get back to your important
[1:14:46.380 --> 1:14:47.380]  work.
[1:14:47.380 --> 1:14:48.380]  We're going to come back.
[1:14:48.380 --> 1:14:51.740]  I want viewers and listeners to understand something right now as we go to break.
[1:14:51.740 --> 1:14:57.300]  If you look at the political climate, the population, the people that we're dealing with here,
[1:14:57.300 --> 1:14:58.300]  it's explosive.
[1:14:58.300 --> 1:15:00.660]  This is not Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
[1:15:00.660 --> 1:15:04.940]  This is not people already trained to be slaves and the university students demanding freedom
[1:15:04.940 --> 1:15:08.420]  of being crushed by tens of thousands of troops.
[1:15:08.420 --> 1:15:14.020]  This is a free nation of 70 years, with hundreds of years of quasi-freedom before that, and
[1:15:14.020 --> 1:15:15.540]  it's going to be explosive.
[1:15:15.540 --> 1:15:18.980]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[1:15:18.980 --> 1:15:24.780]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you
[1:15:24.780 --> 1:15:30.220]  now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[1:16:18.420 --> 1:16:20.180]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[1:16:20.180 --> 1:16:24.820]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[1:16:24.820 --> 1:16:27.060]  by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:16:27.060 --> 1:16:31.980]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat

[1:17:16.900 --> 1:17:23.900]  We've had this in for two weeks, I've been so busy, I haven't talked about it because
[1:17:23.900 --> 1:17:26.300]  I've been covering news, but it's very exciting.
[1:17:26.300 --> 1:17:28.620]  It's super silver skin cream.

[1:19:14.300 --> 1:19:43.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:19:43.140 --> 1:19:47.660]  Hey man, did you see that NFL game last night?
[1:19:47.660 --> 1:19:53.220]  Yeah, my fantasy football club is really great, we're going to go eat some wings, drink beer
[1:19:53.220 --> 1:19:54.220]  tonight.
[1:19:54.220 --> 1:19:59.540]  Hey, nothing wrong with that folks except, there's a social engineer program funded by
[1:19:59.540 --> 1:20:04.100]  the CHICOMS, sexualizing your children, your borders are being crushed by the UN, world
[1:20:04.100 --> 1:20:06.100]  governments being announced.
[1:20:06.100 --> 1:20:09.820]  The Democratic Party in Hollywood is trying to demoralize the nation and stop our president
[1:20:09.820 --> 1:20:14.940]  from winning a trade war with China that's really about getting China out of our business.
[1:20:14.940 --> 1:20:21.620]  And now hundreds and hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles are rolling across the longest
[1:20:21.620 --> 1:20:29.180]  bridge in the world from the Chinese communist mainland right into Hong Kong.
[1:20:29.180 --> 1:20:34.420]  And if you go, at least when I checked during the break, to CNN or ABC News, there's no
[1:20:34.420 --> 1:20:35.420]  coverage of it.
[1:20:35.420 --> 1:20:40.340]  You go to dredgereport.com, there's some links, you go to infowars.com, there's some links,
[1:20:40.340 --> 1:20:44.740]  but you'd think that's a bigger deal, you see, but a lot of our media has been siding
[1:20:44.740 --> 1:20:50.300]  with China against Hong Kong, and our media has been siding against Trump in the trade
[1:20:50.300 --> 1:20:51.300]  war.
[1:20:51.300 --> 1:20:55.460]  And all these Hollywood stars are saying China's good and Xi will show us.
[1:20:55.460 --> 1:20:59.300]  It's absolutely disgusting, but our own Greg Reese was just there days ago, right at the
[1:20:59.300 --> 1:21:05.500]  bridge on the Chinese side predicting that the invasion would come.
[1:21:05.500 --> 1:21:09.780]  So while Paul's talking for TV viewers will roll some of that b-roll, Paul, this is so
[1:21:09.780 --> 1:21:13.220]  historic, this is going to explode.
[1:21:13.220 --> 1:21:14.940]  You were just there, obviously.
[1:21:14.940 --> 1:21:16.740]  What do you expect to unfold next?
[1:21:16.740 --> 1:21:21.620]  Do they think the Chinese show of force will make the protesters not come out in the streets?
[1:21:21.620 --> 1:21:24.660]  Because from what you've said in the history I've studied, this is not going to go like
[1:21:24.660 --> 1:21:25.660]  Tiananmen Square.
[1:21:25.660 --> 1:21:30.300]  It's going to be a lot more people, a lot more sustained, a lot more serious, and I predict
[1:21:30.300 --> 1:21:35.300]  as the violence by the Chai Kong's escalates, we're going to start seeing reprisals, because
[1:21:35.300 --> 1:21:39.380]  the word is, there's a lot of illegal weapons in Hong Kong, and I predict you're going
[1:21:39.380 --> 1:21:42.420]  to start seeing some liberator pistols.
[1:21:42.420 --> 1:21:48.820]  Well, we've already seen some fake pistols, we've already seen live rounds fired into
[1:21:48.820 --> 1:21:53.660]  the air by the police to turn back off some of the protesters, and no, they're not going
[1:21:53.660 --> 1:21:54.660]  anywhere.
[1:21:54.660 --> 1:21:58.420]  It's literally to a man, everyone we spoke to said whatever happens, they're going to
[1:21:58.420 --> 1:22:01.300]  be out on the streets until their demands are met.
[1:22:01.300 --> 1:22:05.740]  To give you an idea, Alex, of what they're fighting against, just look at what the citizens
[1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:07.660]  of China have to labor under.
[1:22:07.660 --> 1:22:12.220]  Under their social credit system, which is being introduced in the West, and you were
[1:22:12.220 --> 1:22:18.940]  one of the primary first victims of it, Alex, they've already banned 2.5 million people in
[1:22:18.940 --> 1:22:21.900]  China from buying plane tickets.
[1:22:21.900 --> 1:22:28.540]  They've banned 90,000 people from buying train tickets in the month of July alone, because
[1:22:28.540 --> 1:22:34.100]  either they said something bad about the government, maybe they smoked in a non-smoking area, maybe
[1:22:34.100 --> 1:22:37.180]  they crossed the road on a red light.
[1:22:37.180 --> 1:22:40.500]  Literally there's a list where you can be banned, you can be part of this social credit
[1:22:40.500 --> 1:22:46.900]  score list, have your score lowered, be denied basic commerce, basic services, but buying
[1:22:46.900 --> 1:22:52.180]  too many video games, buying too much junk food, buying too much alcohol, this is the
[1:22:52.180 --> 1:22:57.900]  complete control over society that the communists have been yearning after for decades and decades,
[1:22:57.900 --> 1:22:59.620]  now with technology they have it.
[1:22:59.620 --> 1:23:06.060]  They even prevent people in China from going on dating websites if their social credit score
[1:23:06.060 --> 1:23:07.060]  is too low.
[1:23:07.060 --> 1:23:08.740]  What do we see in America?
[1:23:08.740 --> 1:23:13.500]  Now we see people being banned from having bank accounts because they have the wrong political
[1:23:13.500 --> 1:23:18.980]  opinions, you were banned from having a bank account for having the wrong political opinions.
[1:23:18.980 --> 1:23:24.260]  So the media has the nerve to try and grandstand and pretend they're on the side of the protesters,
[1:23:24.260 --> 1:23:28.540]  Hillary Clinton tweets about it on the side of the protesters, meanwhile they're lobbying
[1:23:28.540 --> 1:23:34.780]  for the exact same social credit score authoritarian system to be introduced in the West and that's
[1:23:34.780 --> 1:23:39.220]  what really gets me, that the protesters are not going away, whatever happens they're going
[1:23:39.220 --> 1:23:45.340]  to be out on the streets, come what may, even if China, which we hope it doesn't invade,
[1:23:45.340 --> 1:23:48.260]  so that's what's going to happen.
[1:23:48.260 --> 1:23:55.860]  This is literally a giant authoritarian nation with a hundred million standing army, they've
[1:23:55.860 --> 1:24:00.060]  got that many in the reserves, like five million in the regular military, some say ten million,
[1:24:00.060 --> 1:24:04.500]  they've got reserves of a hundred million obviously, that some former way claim they
[1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:08.540]  can fight, they don't have the supplies to do it, but they are the greatest mass murderers
[1:24:08.540 --> 1:24:12.100]  in history, killing a hundred plus million of their own people, and they're now trying
[1:24:12.100 --> 1:24:18.620]  to absorb once free Hong Kong and are already admittedly sending their triads and mafias
[1:24:18.620 --> 1:24:24.180]  in to squeeze everybody, because that's what the Communist Party is, this is just amazing,
[1:24:24.180 --> 1:24:29.660]  and I expect to see our media side against Hong Kong and against Trump supporting Hong
[1:24:29.660 --> 1:24:30.660]  Kong.
[1:24:30.660 --> 1:24:36.420]  Well, we've already seen many people on the left who are called tankies trying to smear
[1:24:36.420 --> 1:24:41.180]  these protestors as far right, because they're carrying pepe memes, they don't know what
[1:24:41.180 --> 1:24:46.660]  it means in the West, the media's demonized this meme as a white supremacist dog whistle,
[1:24:46.660 --> 1:24:51.340]  they're not carrying signs because of that, there's not this ridiculous partisan bickering
[1:24:51.340 --> 1:24:56.940]  in Hong Kong, the society's largely united behind the protestors, and again they're largely
[1:24:56.940 --> 1:25:03.380]  united against this migration invasion which is subverting their society, there was a quote
[1:25:03.380 --> 1:25:09.980]  from one protestor there who said quote, they drain our resources from healthcare to education
[1:25:09.980 --> 1:25:15.980]  and are diluting our culture, making it increasingly pro-Beijing, which is what we see happening
[1:25:15.980 --> 1:25:20.580]  in the West with this mass migration from the Middle East and North Africa, so they
[1:25:20.580 --> 1:25:26.060]  have many of the same concerns that their society is being subverted, diluted, and the
[1:25:26.060 --> 1:25:31.780]  power that they once held is being transferred to China as a result of this mass migration
[1:25:31.780 --> 1:25:37.540]  weapon, that's not far right, that's just being right to stand up against, again one
[1:25:37.540 --> 1:25:42.020]  of the most fearsome military regimes on the planet, that does not make you far right,
[1:25:42.020 --> 1:25:46.420]  that just puts you in the right, that makes you a freedom fighter for liberty, for democracy
[1:25:46.420 --> 1:25:49.540]  and that's exactly what they're doing, that's who they are.
[1:25:49.540 --> 1:25:54.300]  Well we see headlines out of the Guardian going, oh Chinese troops coming into Hong Kong
[1:25:54.300 --> 1:26:00.340]  causes unease, so we're gonna see the left's love affair with communist China that's all
[1:26:00.340 --> 1:26:04.540]  over our news and I know all over your news, we're gonna see that put to the test, I wonder
[1:26:04.540 --> 1:26:10.020]  how folks are gonna feel when we see bloodied and murdered and run over bodies by tanks
[1:26:10.020 --> 1:26:15.460]  because the Chai comms aren't gonna be able to contain this information very, very long
[1:26:15.460 --> 1:26:20.140]  once it kicks off, Paul, because I predict we're gonna see even bigger protest and bigger
[1:26:20.140 --> 1:26:24.340]  response, I know that Hong Kong folks told you that the Chai comms invaded, they had
[1:26:24.340 --> 1:26:28.020]  something really big planned, do you have any idea what that could be?
[1:26:28.020 --> 1:26:33.620]  Well yeah, it's gonna be, they've already got a garrison within Hong Kong, they haven't
[1:26:33.620 --> 1:26:38.100]  rolled that out, they've rolled it out today as you said, claiming they were doing maneuvers,
[1:26:38.100 --> 1:26:42.900]  it's obviously an intimidation tactic, in fact they put out a video, the Chinese military
[1:26:42.900 --> 1:26:47.820]  and it's in the video I posted a couple of hours ago, truth about the Hong Kong protest,
[1:26:47.820 --> 1:26:51.860]  where they're literally training with live rounds to just gun down protesters, so if
[1:26:51.860 --> 1:26:55.940]  you wanna know what they may have planned, just watch that video, but people need to
[1:26:55.940 --> 1:27:01.420]  understand, Alex, this is so widespread, this is not isolated protest in little areas
[1:27:01.420 --> 1:27:07.860]  of the city, everywhere you go in the city, everywhere, there's graffiti, democracy now,
[1:27:07.860 --> 1:27:13.740]  Chai Nazi, literally Chai Nazi has written everywhere around the city, this is so widespread,
[1:27:13.740 --> 1:27:19.260]  this is so supported by the whole population that it's not just a minor protest movement,
[1:27:19.260 --> 1:27:22.580]  it is basically at this point a revolution.
[1:27:22.580 --> 1:27:28.700]  We're gonna play your report, Paul, we come back, incredible job, look forward to having
[1:27:28.700 --> 1:27:32.260]  you back on as you track this, I know you've spent a lot of time in China and a lot of
[1:27:32.260 --> 1:27:38.460]  time previously in that area, through some family interest and so you're a great reporter,
[1:27:38.460 --> 1:27:42.020]  and you and the rest of the crew had a lot of courage over there, amazing footage you
[1:27:42.020 --> 1:27:45.260]  got getting right in the middle of it, we should be praying for the folks in Hong Kong
[1:27:45.260 --> 1:27:50.180]  and Taiwan, but bottom line, there are periods in history when a lot of big developments
[1:27:50.180 --> 1:27:55.060]  unfold, they say every century or so more happens in just a few years, it happens in
[1:27:55.060 --> 1:27:58.620]  the whole next hundred, we've reached that quickening point right now, so everybody
[1:27:58.620 --> 1:28:05.020]  strap yourselves in, we are not in Kansas anymore, thank you Paul Watson, thanks Alex,
[1:28:05.020 --> 1:28:09.540]  alright we come back, we're gonna finish up with this and then we're gonna move into
[1:28:09.540 --> 1:28:14.580]  the news that ties into it, the Queen of England just suspended parliament to enforce Briggs
[1:28:14.580 --> 1:28:21.580]  it, we'll be right back.

[1:29:38.260 --> 1:29:41.660]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam, because it's a
[1:29:41.660 --> 1:29:42.660]  form of fascism.

[1:32:22.580 --> 1:32:48.300]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:32:52.580 --> 1:32:57.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am just completely on the edge of my seat right now with the
[1:32:57.740 --> 1:33:03.820]  Chai Combs, the images of hundreds and hundreds of armored vehicles, wheeled tanks, heavy
[1:33:03.820 --> 1:33:08.380]  APCs, and hundreds of thousands of war troops massing.
[1:33:08.380 --> 1:33:14.100]  We were just rolling the footage in the last two segments with Paul Joseph Watson.
[1:33:14.100 --> 1:33:21.060]  We're going to be tracking that throughout the day and in the fourth hour, we have three
[1:33:21.060 --> 1:33:26.900]  of our great intrepid reporters that are going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[1:33:26.900 --> 1:33:33.740]  Greg Ries, Savannah Hernandez, Beko Wright, and we're probably also going to have another
[1:33:33.740 --> 1:33:40.060]  military expert pop in to give his take on where this could go sideways.
[1:33:40.060 --> 1:33:44.780]  Perhaps we should also, for at least one segment, if he can still do it, get Matt Bracken
[1:33:44.780 --> 1:33:47.620]  to give us his take popping in.
[1:33:47.620 --> 1:33:50.740]  I kind of preempted his hour, though it's always informative when he does it, at least
[1:33:50.740 --> 1:33:53.900]  an hour once a week with us, because they've gotten back and I wanted them to be able to
[1:33:53.900 --> 1:33:57.860]  host an hour of the main show, but I think Matt can also, if he can still do it, do at
[1:33:57.860 --> 1:34:02.100]  least one segment, maybe the last segment with them to give his perspective as an author,
[1:34:02.100 --> 1:34:08.260]  researcher, terrorism expert, former Navy SEAL, really respect his opinions and views on that.
[1:34:08.260 --> 1:34:15.020]  This next issue is so huge that I probably should have opened the show with it.
[1:34:15.020 --> 1:34:19.620]  But the UN officially saying that they want to break the U.S. border and build refugee
[1:34:19.620 --> 1:34:24.780]  centers inside the U.S. and Ilan Omar reporting it is the first thing I led with, because
[1:34:24.780 --> 1:34:29.740]  that's the attack on Konos or the continental United States.
[1:34:29.740 --> 1:34:34.340]  And for me, it's not just an oath I've personally taken to defend the Republic, for me it's
[1:34:34.340 --> 1:34:35.340]  foreign domestic.
[1:34:35.340 --> 1:34:40.020]  When you fought for something for a long time and gone through a lot to defend it, you start
[1:34:40.020 --> 1:34:41.740]  to love it even more.
[1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:46.140]  I don't resent anything I've done in this fight, and I don't resent the fact that I've
[1:34:46.140 --> 1:34:50.500]  been persecuted for it, but let me tell you, it makes me not want to lose it that much
[1:34:50.500 --> 1:34:52.620]  more, you understand?
[1:34:52.620 --> 1:34:57.100]  And I can feel the spirit of liberty rising, I can feel the human spirit fighting back
[1:34:57.100 --> 1:35:03.100]  against this global technocracy, this global mark of the beast, this global Chinese social
[1:35:03.100 --> 1:35:10.820]  score that's almost in place, and the 5G going in, and all of this human enslaving tech,
[1:35:10.820 --> 1:35:13.020]  and my very cells cry out against it.
[1:35:13.020 --> 1:35:17.940]  Now let me do the best job I can here, telling you what we haven't hit yet, and what really
[1:35:17.940 --> 1:35:25.220]  today's top story you could say was going to be, because as I do so many times before
[1:35:25.220 --> 1:35:30.220]  the show starts, I'm sitting here looking at all this news and I go, is it the Chai
[1:35:30.220 --> 1:35:39.420]  comms invading Hong Kong that's getting almost no attention, is that most important?
[1:35:39.420 --> 1:35:44.340]  Is it the world awakening to the UN running the migrant invasion, and the left openly
[1:35:44.340 --> 1:35:47.420]  calling for the UN to occupy the US?
[1:35:47.420 --> 1:35:49.460]  Is that the top story?
[1:35:49.460 --> 1:36:02.100]  Or is it the Queen of England suspending parliament for the first time in 400 years?
[1:36:02.100 --> 1:36:13.620]  Now I have to say that's the top story, Hong Kong's incredibly important and can trigger
[1:36:13.620 --> 1:36:18.580]  a new world war, and it's going to be a bloody spectacle, I don't think there's any doubt
[1:36:18.580 --> 1:36:20.460]  about that.
[1:36:20.460 --> 1:36:24.260]  The Chai comms need to show how tough they are, they're in a war with the US, a proxy
[1:36:24.260 --> 1:36:28.260]  war, and they want to feast on the wealth of Hong Kong.
[1:36:28.260 --> 1:36:34.980]  The communist desire for dominance is unmatched, and it's thirst or what is engorged in innocent
[1:36:34.980 --> 1:36:36.580]  blood.
[1:36:36.580 --> 1:36:42.540]  They have no soul, the Chai comms in China, human animal cloning, total experimentation,
[1:36:42.540 --> 1:36:47.300]  mass murder of Christians, Buddhists, millions in forced labor camps, I mean they are what
[1:36:47.300 --> 1:36:51.340]  North Korea wishes it was.
[1:36:51.340 --> 1:37:01.340]  But the Queen of England suspending parliament for the first time in 400 years, just happens
[1:37:01.340 --> 1:37:04.780]  to be a 400 perfect number.
[1:37:04.780 --> 1:37:15.380]  That signifies, like the cutting of a diamond, the constellation of resistance of the power
[1:37:15.380 --> 1:37:16.380]  structure.
[1:37:16.380 --> 1:37:22.180]  The Axis, if you want to call it the globalist and the Chai comms, and their leftist system,
[1:37:22.180 --> 1:37:31.780]  and then the United States, the UK, the liberty movement, and how those groups are going to
[1:37:31.780 --> 1:37:32.780]  fight.
[1:37:32.780 --> 1:37:39.140]  And the fact that the Queen of England has weighed in looking at how the breaks are happening,
[1:37:39.140 --> 1:37:46.380]  not in a game of pool or billiards, if you're over in the UK, if you call it billiards,
[1:37:46.380 --> 1:37:47.380]  tells us a lot.
[1:37:47.380 --> 1:37:56.940]  And you know who in the last two configurations of this sided with the US and with England,
[1:37:56.940 --> 1:37:58.860]  and that's the Russians.
[1:37:58.860 --> 1:38:02.740]  And Trump knows that, has been trying to get the Russians to side with us in this.
[1:38:02.740 --> 1:38:06.260]  And the globalist through the Chai comms have been working through our media to say, Trump's
[1:38:06.260 --> 1:38:11.900]  a Russian agent, so that in this new world war that's here, that's economic, cultural,
[1:38:11.900 --> 1:38:19.420]  and military, that Russia will sit on the sidelines.
[1:38:19.420 --> 1:38:25.260]  And so, exactly what we laid out and what we foresaw is now here.
[1:38:25.260 --> 1:38:30.740]  And just like World War I and World War II, World War III was the Cold War.
[1:38:30.740 --> 1:38:31.740]  This is World War IV.
[1:38:31.740 --> 1:38:33.620]  It has started.
[1:38:33.620 --> 1:38:40.940]  It's a global civil war between nation states and with the globalist combine.
[1:38:40.940 --> 1:38:44.460]  Now you could say, wait a minute, I thought the globalist combine came out of the brits
[1:38:44.460 --> 1:38:48.300]  and came out of Cecil Rhodes and the whole plan did, yes.
[1:38:48.300 --> 1:38:55.300]  But there's factions within it and they broke away with the Chai comms and with the EU.
[1:38:55.300 --> 1:39:01.740]  And these old power splits between Europe and the UK are still the dynamism that runs
[1:39:01.740 --> 1:39:07.540]  this, and Bilderberg was always about trying to get the British Empire to work with the
[1:39:07.540 --> 1:39:09.460]  European Empire.
[1:39:09.460 --> 1:39:14.420]  But it's two different distinct groups and these old fissures just split wide open and
[1:39:14.420 --> 1:39:18.420]  it's beautiful.
[1:39:18.420 --> 1:39:24.660]  The World Government Project is on the rocks and it's breaking right in front of us and
[1:39:24.660 --> 1:39:26.460]  this couldn't be better for humanity.
[1:39:26.460 --> 1:39:32.420]  We don't want one global system, a unipolar dictatorship with the Chai comms as the engine
[1:39:32.420 --> 1:39:33.420]  of it.
[1:39:33.420 --> 1:39:35.460]  No, thank you.
[1:39:35.460 --> 1:39:40.820]  I don't think that's going to be happening now or ever.
[1:39:40.820 --> 1:39:49.060]  And I predict if we're successful, and I think we will be, that Russia is going to slide
[1:39:49.060 --> 1:39:55.060]  into this alliance and out of this we can defeat radical Islam, we can defeat the Chai
[1:39:55.060 --> 1:39:59.660]  comms, the Hollywood EU group and you're like, but wait a minute, the British Role family
[1:39:59.660 --> 1:40:05.060]  is super corrupt, there's a bunch of pedophiles in it, absolutely, that's well known.
[1:40:05.060 --> 1:40:08.860]  And they're not even British themselves, but they know who's winning.
[1:40:08.860 --> 1:40:14.540]  They sat on the sidelines for the last minute and now the Queen just flipped her dictator
[1:40:14.540 --> 1:40:19.020]  switch because the Brits did vote to get out of the Euro.
[1:40:19.020 --> 1:40:23.660]  The Euro's been sabotaging things, trying to sabotage that economy and so she just
[1:40:23.660 --> 1:40:30.900]  dropped the trillion pound bomb on them and man, this is history, that's all I gotta say.
[1:40:30.900 --> 1:40:37.180]  So I'm going to do my best when we come back to lay this out and this is going to be spectacular.
[1:40:37.180 --> 1:40:39.700]  These alignments are real.
[1:40:39.700 --> 1:40:44.140]  The world is now in a bipolar structure, I don't mean that psychologically, that's what
[1:40:44.140 --> 1:40:50.980]  it's called, two fronts and Russia as usual is going to be the wild card right in the
[1:40:50.980 --> 1:40:56.780]  middle and Russia, I believe, will side with the West in the final equation.
[1:40:56.780 --> 1:41:01.340]  That's why there's been every move made to keep Russia out of this alliance.
[1:41:01.340 --> 1:41:07.420]  We will discuss it when we come back, but we are now entering the quickening and this
[1:41:07.420 --> 1:41:13.380]  is an incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen and there's been a lot of double
[1:41:13.380 --> 1:41:17.500]  dealing by the globalist UK, a lot of double dealing by Israel, a lot of double dealing
[1:41:17.500 --> 1:41:21.620]  by our government because there's double dealing everywhere, but the double dealing is about
[1:41:21.620 --> 1:41:28.900]  to come to zero and you're going to see people divide into their groups right now and all
[1:41:28.900 --> 1:41:31.940]  the folks out there that have been sucking up the Hollywood propaganda, the Chai Kham
[1:41:31.940 --> 1:41:38.500]  propaganda, you're going to lose and I know you're going to commit a lot of crimes because
[1:41:38.500 --> 1:41:41.900]  you've been promised you'll be in the power structure if you could just overthrow America.
[1:41:41.900 --> 1:41:44.220]  It's not going to happen.
[1:41:44.220 --> 1:41:45.220]  You failed.
[1:41:45.220 --> 1:41:51.380]  I can tell you right now, there's no way you win.
[1:41:51.380 --> 1:41:52.380]  You're not mental.
[1:41:52.380 --> 1:41:53.380]  You're losers.
[1:41:53.380 --> 1:41:57.940]  You think you can beat the United States and what's left of the British Empire?
[1:41:57.940 --> 1:41:58.940]  Really?
[1:41:58.940 --> 1:42:01.940]  You think you can beat us?
[1:42:01.940 --> 1:42:02.940]  Good luck.
[1:42:02.940 --> 1:42:07.020]  Nobody has and nobody ever will when we're defending ourselves and so the Chai Kham and

[1:43:19.060 --> 1:43:20.860]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[1:43:20.860 --> 1:43:24.220]  A Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because
[1:43:24.220 --> 1:43:28.660]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities
[1:43:28.660 --> 1:43:29.660]  over two decades.
[1:43:29.660 --> 1:43:33.020]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[1:43:33.020 --> 1:43:36.340]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[1:43:36.340 --> 1:43:40.620]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[1:43:40.620 --> 1:43:43.700]  to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change and they will become the
[1:43:43.700 --> 1:43:47.740]  Big Tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American
[1:43:47.740 --> 1:43:51.740]  politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover
[1:43:51.740 --> 1:43:52.860]  after the Great Depression.
[1:43:52.860 --> 1:43:57.740]  The inforward's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world
[1:43:57.740 --> 1:44:02.140]  to make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise
[1:44:02.140 --> 1:44:03.660]  of an independent free press.
[1:44:03.660 --> 1:44:07.420]  Real collusion is Big Tech and Big Media manipulating and working with each other to
[1:44:07.420 --> 1:44:10.180]  try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[1:44:10.180 --> 1:44:13.140]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[1:44:13.140 --> 1:44:14.940]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[1:44:14.940 --> 1:44:16.900]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[1:44:16.900 --> 1:44:21.580]  Even it is what you just saw.
[1:44:21.580 --> 1:44:26.340]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[1:45:17.860 --> 1:45:18.860]  routine.
[1:45:18.860 --> 1:45:24.140]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people but I've decided that we're
[1:45:24.140 --> 1:45:27.980]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements and that if you go back 5-6 years ago before
[1:45:27.980 --> 1:45:31.380]  all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how
[1:45:31.380 --> 1:45:34.980]  great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and I'd have doctors
[1:45:34.980 --> 1:45:36.940]  on an expert to explain why they were so good.
[1:45:36.940 --> 1:45:40.260]  And instead the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[1:45:40.260 --> 1:45:41.260]  shut us down.
[1:45:41.260 --> 1:45:43.620]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[1:45:43.620 --> 1:45:44.620]  wonderful they were.
[1:45:44.620 --> 1:45:46.460]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[1:45:46.460 --> 1:45:50.740]  Joan sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[1:45:50.740 --> 1:45:55.940]  You know, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through
[1:45:55.940 --> 1:45:58.660]  the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[1:45:58.660 --> 1:46:02.540]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the
[1:46:02.540 --> 1:46:06.140]  system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things
[1:46:06.140 --> 1:46:07.420]  and a lot of drugs work great.
[1:46:07.420 --> 1:46:11.380]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[1:46:11.380 --> 1:46:13.340]  God's medicine chest.
[1:46:13.340 --> 1:46:24.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:30:01.940 --> 1:47:10.020]  control of the UK and the one-sided EU deal where they're flooded with illegal
[1:47:10.020 --> 1:47:15.060]  aliens and where the country's broken down and where they have all these horrible deals
[1:47:15.060 --> 1:47:16.300]  on trade.
[1:47:16.300 --> 1:47:23.500]  That's all coming to an end and now the UK can negotiate with the euro and absolutely
[1:47:23.500 --> 1:47:25.780]  wreck the euro if they want to.
[1:47:25.780 --> 1:47:31.020]  But the euro was designed, as the founders of it said, to kill nation states, including
[1:47:31.020 --> 1:47:33.860]  Europeans countries and flood them as well.
[1:47:33.860 --> 1:47:40.340]  So again, the United States and the UK are coming to save Europe from itself, not putting
[1:47:40.340 --> 1:47:41.580]  Europe down.
[1:47:41.580 --> 1:47:45.180]  It's just a fact and history doesn't rhyme.
[1:47:45.180 --> 1:47:47.220]  It repeats, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:47:47.220 --> 1:47:50.260]  You always hear that it rhymes, no, it repeats.
[1:47:50.260 --> 1:47:52.260]  Now let's continue.
[1:47:52.260 --> 1:47:59.540]  Off with her head, this is a real quote in the British newspapers, Soros funded best for
[1:47:59.540 --> 1:48:09.820]  Britain group threatens Queen over Brexit and says last time a king actually quoted suspended
[1:48:09.820 --> 1:48:15.940]  parliament, they cut off his head.
[1:48:15.940 --> 1:48:20.780]  Now people got to ask, are you going to side with the Queen of England or are you going
[1:48:20.780 --> 1:48:28.180]  to side with the Rothschilds that are also based there that run Soros, who by the way
[1:48:28.180 --> 1:48:33.660]  want to overthrow Israel, all these idiotic anti-Jewite supremacists go online and they
[1:48:33.660 --> 1:48:39.620]  call here and they say, oh, you're not against Israel, you're a traitor, Israel's a bunch
[1:48:39.620 --> 1:48:42.060]  of factions, you dumbasses.
[1:48:42.060 --> 1:48:47.900]  Just like the United States or Russia or anybody else that's got free political parties, everybody
[1:48:47.900 --> 1:48:49.860]  wants control.
[1:48:49.860 --> 1:48:51.460]  I happen to know the real power structure.
[1:48:51.460 --> 1:48:52.460]  I've studied it.
[1:48:52.460 --> 1:48:53.980]  I actually want to know who the players are.
[1:48:53.980 --> 1:48:59.420]  I don't want to just spout off how smart I am because I can list how many Jews or have
[1:48:59.420 --> 1:49:01.340]  powerful jobs all day.
[1:49:01.340 --> 1:49:05.340]  It has nothing to do with it.
[1:49:05.340 --> 1:49:08.740]  And the Rothschilds funded Hitler early on, but later didn't.
[1:49:08.740 --> 1:49:13.460]  They've helped fund World War I, opportunists.
[1:49:13.460 --> 1:49:16.780]  And now they're trying to stop Brexit.
[1:49:16.780 --> 1:49:20.780]  The powerful Rothschilds, there's diversity in that family as well of opinions.
[1:49:20.780 --> 1:49:27.180]  And it's on, ladies and gentlemen, and you've got 400 years.
[1:49:27.180 --> 1:49:31.420]  Well, the parliament is still trying to scuttle the vote of the people.
[1:49:31.420 --> 1:49:33.540]  And for four years, they've been trying to stop it.
[1:49:33.540 --> 1:49:39.140]  So the Queen of England knows that real polls show up to 70% of people in the UK won out
[1:49:39.140 --> 1:49:40.140]  now.
[1:49:40.140 --> 1:49:42.340]  It's just like our fake polls.
[1:49:42.340 --> 1:49:44.780]  The fake polls show 55%, 60% won out.
[1:49:44.780 --> 1:49:46.300]  Well, they already voted to do it.
[1:49:46.300 --> 1:49:53.700]  So she says, I'm suspending parliament for five weeks so that the government can really
[1:49:53.700 --> 1:49:59.420]  negotiate a deal with the EU that actually gives us the power to vote on our sovereignty
[1:49:59.420 --> 1:50:04.980]  because 93% of UK laws are set and controlled by the EU.
[1:50:04.980 --> 1:50:06.140]  And it just hit me.
[1:50:06.140 --> 1:50:07.780]  We've got to get Lord Moncton on.
[1:50:07.780 --> 1:50:09.700]  He was chief advisor to Margaret Thatcher.
[1:50:09.700 --> 1:50:11.940]  He is at the heart of this resistance.
[1:50:11.940 --> 1:50:15.300]  He'll give us all the inside baseball as if we don't already know it.
[1:50:15.300 --> 1:50:21.740]  Please get Lord Moncton on today or tomorrow, Daria and crew as soon as you can.
[1:50:21.740 --> 1:50:26.900]  So I mean, I'm about to read you the quotes here, but they threatened to cut the Queen
[1:50:26.900 --> 1:50:28.260]  of England's head off.
[1:50:28.260 --> 1:50:29.980]  They say, oh, the last king did that.
[1:50:29.980 --> 1:50:30.980]  We cut his head off.
[1:50:30.980 --> 1:50:34.260]  Now, I'm all for parliaments, folks, and I'm all for votes.
[1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:39.100]  And back when the Queen suspended the Canadian parliament a decade ago, I said, this is so
[1:50:39.100 --> 1:50:40.580]  she's still in command.
[1:50:40.580 --> 1:50:43.900]  To a great extent, she has that veto power.
[1:50:43.900 --> 1:50:47.340]  But this time she's in the right because they voted to get out.
[1:50:47.340 --> 1:50:51.340]  The government for almost four years wouldn't let them do it.
[1:50:51.340 --> 1:50:57.420]  They couldn't get their vote again in the last two years to stay in it.
[1:50:57.420 --> 1:51:01.620]  And so she says, follow what the people voted in a referendum.
[1:51:01.620 --> 1:51:03.180]  You're not giving the people what they want.
[1:51:03.180 --> 1:51:08.060]  So I'm exercising my veto over your undemocratic behavior.
[1:51:08.060 --> 1:51:14.500]  And so the Saxe-Coburg Transylvania Queen knows which way the wind is blowing and can
[1:51:14.500 --> 1:51:20.300]  see that Trump and America and the nationalist and the populist and the reinsurgence of the
[1:51:20.300 --> 1:51:24.220]  Christian movements worldwide are winning.
[1:51:24.220 --> 1:51:28.180]  She sat on the sidelines while all this happened.
[1:51:28.180 --> 1:51:34.580]  And while the UK got sucked down a black hole, and now she's coming in like the Dusex.
[1:51:34.580 --> 1:51:39.860]  So the Dusex is the hero that comes in at the last moment when the main hero is going
[1:51:39.860 --> 1:51:41.020]  to lose.
[1:51:41.020 --> 1:51:44.300]  But the Dusex saves him right at the minute.
[1:51:44.300 --> 1:51:45.780]  He's the second king.
[1:51:45.780 --> 1:51:47.660]  He's the little hero.
[1:51:47.660 --> 1:51:53.500]  Han Solo and Darth Vader is about to kill Luke Skywalker in episode four, right, when
[1:51:53.500 --> 1:51:57.260]  he's about to blow the Death Star up, Darth Vader says, I have you now.
[1:51:57.260 --> 1:52:04.220]  Well, the Dusex is Han Solo comes in and stops him from killing Luke Skywalker, and the Death
[1:52:04.220 --> 1:52:06.100]  Star gets blown up.
[1:52:06.100 --> 1:52:10.700]  Queen Elizabeth, with this action, has now become the Han Solo Dusex at the moment.
[1:52:10.700 --> 1:52:12.300]  And I'm not lionizing her.
[1:52:12.300 --> 1:52:13.740]  I don't like royalty.
[1:52:13.740 --> 1:52:15.420]  I don't like what they've done.
[1:52:15.420 --> 1:52:17.220]  House of Windsor is a fake name.
[1:52:17.220 --> 1:52:18.220]  They're not even Brits.
[1:52:18.220 --> 1:52:19.340]  They're not Scots.
[1:52:19.340 --> 1:52:21.140]  They're not Irish, OK?
[1:52:21.140 --> 1:52:22.140]  They removed.
[1:52:22.140 --> 1:52:24.580]  Their ancestors removed the old line of kings.
[1:52:24.580 --> 1:52:29.340]  They removed the Norse kings that took over in 1100, William the Conqueror.
[1:52:29.340 --> 1:52:32.180]  So there's nothing British about them.
[1:52:32.180 --> 1:52:36.180]  But they know how the cookie crumbles.
[1:52:36.180 --> 1:52:40.900]  They know how to cut this diamond, and they know that America is winning.
[1:52:40.900 --> 1:52:44.980]  And so they understand now what they've got to do.
[1:52:44.980 --> 1:52:54.500]  This is big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, and it shows that the power alliances
[1:52:54.500 --> 1:53:00.940]  are lining up just like they did right before World War II.
[1:53:00.940 --> 1:53:07.100]  The only question is, can the Chai Kong stay behinds and the leftist start a war with Russia,
[1:53:07.100 --> 1:53:11.980]  which Obama tried to do starting a war by trying to take the Russian half of Ukraine
[1:53:11.980 --> 1:53:15.580]  that Russia's had since they founded Ukraine 500 years ago.
[1:53:15.580 --> 1:53:18.700]  Russia was founded in Ukraine 500 years ago.
[1:53:18.700 --> 1:53:19.700]  Look it up.
[1:53:19.700 --> 1:53:21.740]  What's modern Russia?
[1:53:21.740 --> 1:53:26.700]  That modern Tsarist system got removed in 1917.
[1:53:26.700 --> 1:53:32.620]  I mean, it'd be like taking New York City, if the Chinese came and took New York City.
[1:53:32.620 --> 1:53:37.500]  That's what Obama did, trying to get the Russians to go ape, you know what?
[1:53:37.500 --> 1:53:38.500]  And it didn't happen.
[1:53:38.500 --> 1:53:40.180]  Putin cut their military funding.
[1:53:40.180 --> 1:53:42.660]  He said, I'm not going to play that game.
[1:53:42.660 --> 1:53:45.740]  And he's a sovereign leader, and he's kicked the globalist out of there.
[1:53:45.740 --> 1:53:49.340]  They're not teaching five-year-olds how to put dresses on in Russia.
[1:53:49.340 --> 1:53:54.180]  And they're throwing George Soros' ass in his companies and his foundations out of Russia
[1:53:54.180 --> 1:53:59.860]  because they're foreign, alien, criminal groups, like media matters and all the rest of it.
[1:53:59.860 --> 1:54:02.020]  And they're getting their asses kicked.
[1:54:02.020 --> 1:54:05.900]  So I hope you all enjoy it, dirtbags.
[1:54:05.900 --> 1:54:07.660]  But we need Russia in the alliance.
[1:54:07.660 --> 1:54:12.420]  I know we've been taught in the post-World War II era to hate Russia.
[1:54:12.420 --> 1:54:15.900]  Russia was captured by the same globalists that have tried to capture us.
[1:54:15.900 --> 1:54:19.900]  Russia pulled the face sucker off.
[1:54:19.900 --> 1:54:22.060]  We should be celebrating that.
[1:54:22.060 --> 1:54:26.460]  We should be happy for Russia trying to increase its birth rate and trying to keep its culture.
[1:54:26.460 --> 1:54:27.940]  We need to be that way.
[1:54:27.940 --> 1:54:32.180]  The culture of Americana that unifies us all, and a Christian ethos, whether you believe
[1:54:32.180 --> 1:54:35.740]  in God or not, the Christian ethos builds good societies.
[1:54:35.740 --> 1:54:43.340]  I'll take that over the leftist, godless ethos of child molestation and their sacrament.
[1:54:43.340 --> 1:54:47.260]  Off with their heads, Soros funded Best for Britain Group, threatens Queen over Briggs
[1:54:47.260 --> 1:54:51.260]  at the EU Loyalist Best for Britain Group, appeared to invoke the fate of the headed
[1:54:51.260 --> 1:54:56.820]  King Charles I of the Queen Elizabeth II, agreed to prologue, typically suspend parliament
[1:54:56.820 --> 1:54:59.740]  for a few weeks before the Briggs deadline.
[1:54:59.740 --> 1:55:03.580]  Following news, the Queen rubber stamp her minister Boris Johnson's request to suspend
[1:55:03.580 --> 1:55:07.620]  the parliamentary session, the longest running for almost 400 years, so the government can
[1:55:07.620 --> 1:55:11.020]  bring forward a new legislation program October 14th.
[1:55:11.020 --> 1:55:15.620]  The Soros funded group tweeted that it would make no sense for the Queen to back this deeply
[1:55:15.620 --> 1:55:22.780]  undemocratic, unconstitutional, and fundamentally political maneuver from the government.
[1:55:22.780 --> 1:55:27.980]  They went on to say if the Queen is asked to help, she would do well to remember history
[1:55:27.980 --> 1:55:32.300]  doesn't look too kindly on royals, who aided that the suspension of democracy.
[1:55:32.300 --> 1:55:36.340]  The anti-briggs group added darkly, appearing to allude to the fate of the monarch's ancestor
[1:55:36.340 --> 1:55:43.420]  Charles I, who tried to govern without parliament, was in the end publicly beheaded.
[1:55:43.420 --> 1:55:48.540]  Let's just pull back from that, yeah, but we're not facing Oliver Cromwell or anybody
[1:55:48.540 --> 1:55:50.940]  like that at this point.
[1:55:50.940 --> 1:55:56.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Lord High Protector and all the rest of it, you have to understand
[1:55:56.780 --> 1:56:04.660]  that the Brits voted to leave, the people in the UK voted to leave the unelected EU.
[1:56:04.660 --> 1:56:06.300]  They never voted to enter it.
[1:56:06.300 --> 1:56:08.900]  It's like China trying to take over Hong Kong.
[1:56:08.900 --> 1:56:10.980]  The Chinese communists were never elected.
[1:56:10.980 --> 1:56:16.660]  People ran 70 years ago, they created the most successful per square mile place in the
[1:56:16.660 --> 1:56:22.420]  world, Hong Kong, the most expensive real estate, everything, incredible wealth, the
[1:56:22.420 --> 1:56:27.380]  average person there is, but now you see they're standing up.
[1:56:27.380 --> 1:56:33.180]  And so history is repeating itself over and over and over again.
[1:56:33.180 --> 1:56:39.660]  And then Soros has the nerve to say, you are the one killing people's democracy.
[1:56:39.660 --> 1:56:42.380]  It's outrageous.
[1:56:42.380 --> 1:56:50.860]  The British Royals, the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha is clearly aligned itself with Trump and America
[1:56:50.860 --> 1:56:52.860]  and it's chosen wisely.
[1:56:52.860 --> 1:57:08.180]  But the enemy is going to strike back, we'll talk about how, if you return, take this.
[1:57:08.180 --> 1:57:13.540]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are
[1:57:13.540 --> 1:57:17.620]  control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[1:57:17.620 --> 1:57:22.740]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[1:57:22.740 --> 1:57:26.380]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[1:57:26.380 --> 1:57:30.900]  third dimension, but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[1:57:30.900 --> 1:57:33.900]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[1:57:33.900 --> 1:57:39.180]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[1:57:39.180 --> 1:57:43.540]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[1:57:43.540 --> 1:57:49.260]  Methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[1:57:49.260 --> 1:57:54.140]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going
[1:57:54.140 --> 1:57:55.140]  to find anywhere.
[1:57:55.140 --> 1:58:00.300]  It is amazing, experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American
[1:58:00.300 --> 1:58:07.300]  evolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[1:58:31.300 --> 1:58:35.420]  This is Nazi Germany level, this is racketeering, this is cartels.
[1:58:35.420 --> 1:58:39.780]  Mr. President, we need your help, we need it now.
[1:58:39.780 --> 1:58:41.420]  You can take on Big Tech.
[1:58:41.420 --> 1:58:48.740]  They saw InfoWars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[1:58:48.740 --> 1:58:54.100]  populist organization, so they thought first they come for Alex Jones, then when people
[1:58:54.100 --> 1:58:58.420]  say okay take him off the air, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[1:58:58.420 --> 1:59:03.340]  The way to fight back is to support InfoWars now more than ever and make it a standard
[1:59:03.340 --> 1:59:05.140]  of freedom and free speech.
[1:59:05.140 --> 1:59:31.140]  And they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[1:59:31.140 --> 1:59:44.420]  We have a surprise guest joining us for two segments and then I'll dive into all the news
[1:59:44.420 --> 1:59:50.620]  after that, but we're in a historical period, a major power flux, the corporate global
[1:59:50.620 --> 2:00:00.260]  government plan of globalism gave untold fiat wealth to megacorporations and then they allied
[2:00:00.260 --> 2:00:04.820]  themselves with communist China, there was an agreement, the China would control the
[2:00:04.820 --> 2:00:10.160]  economics and the manufacturing, the banks would control the finance and the digital
[2:00:10.160 --> 2:00:17.300]  currencies, the United States and Europe would control the military in an alliance.
[2:00:17.300 --> 2:00:21.180]  Of course all these different power groups didn't follow the agreement except for the
[2:00:21.180 --> 2:00:27.780]  United States and the UK did to a certain extent and were absolutely cheated and set
[2:00:27.780 --> 2:00:28.780]  up.
[2:00:28.780 --> 2:00:33.740]  Now all those agreements are being broken, the United States is exercising its power
[2:00:33.740 --> 2:00:41.060]  over Europe and over the Chai Khoms, Russia is trying to stay out of it wisely, the Queen
[2:00:41.060 --> 2:00:48.460]  of England has now joined with the United States and the West and is trying to get a
[2:00:48.460 --> 2:00:55.780]  clean Brexit in place, this is an incredible time to be alive, we are winning.
[2:00:55.780 --> 2:01:03.500]  Now we're still being culturally rotted out from the inside, we are still seeing the establishment
[2:01:03.500 --> 2:01:08.180]  try to crash the economy, they can still try to assassinate Trump, that would only backfire,
[2:01:08.180 --> 2:01:14.140]  look at all the angles on that, but they are going to just keep putting out this info and
[2:01:14.140 --> 2:01:17.500]  propaganda as long as they can and there's a lot of other ways that they're going to
[2:01:17.500 --> 2:01:22.660]  try to strike back and so on tomorrow's show I'm going to get more into the real transhumanist
[2:01:22.660 --> 2:01:26.820]  threat, which we've still got to face, just because the global model for global governments
[2:01:26.820 --> 2:01:30.620]  in trouble doesn't mean these organizations still aren't there, they're not still moving
[2:01:30.620 --> 2:01:36.740]  forward and trying to reconstitute their operations through big tech that is forming the real global
[2:01:36.740 --> 2:01:44.420]  government with the casual society, with the surveillance, with the censorship in live time
[2:01:44.420 --> 2:01:49.980]  using AI and its human collaborators, we'll be talking about that some next segment.
[2:01:49.980 --> 2:01:57.860]  But there's more than one way, as I say, to skin a rabbit or skin a cat and that is to
[2:01:57.860 --> 2:02:02.860]  cut off the infrastructure of Google and Facebook and Twitter to pull government contracts,
[2:02:02.860 --> 2:02:07.340]  not allow them to be used at government installations because they've been compromised by foreign
[2:02:07.340 --> 2:02:11.460]  powers, particularly Apple and Google, and to do things like the Justice Department just
[2:02:11.460 --> 2:02:17.020]  did, we had callers talk about this yesterday, how we need to treat Apple and Google like
[2:02:17.020 --> 2:02:22.300]  Huawei, which is really an organ of the Chinese communist government, and this is now out
[2:02:22.300 --> 2:02:26.780]  from Bloomberg, Justice Department opposes Google's undersea cable from China and is
[2:02:26.780 --> 2:02:32.780]  not allowing them to connect it to the US mainland or to Hong Kong.
[2:02:32.780 --> 2:02:39.900]  So there you go, the plot is thickening, oh, parliament suspended for working against the
[2:02:39.900 --> 2:02:45.100]  referendum of the people, oh, I'm sorry, oh, Kashmir just got invaded by the Indians, it's
[2:02:45.100 --> 2:02:49.180]  their land anyways, they're not going to submit anymore and have the Hindus ordered out of
[2:02:49.180 --> 2:02:56.220]  their own country, oh, sorry, and you just see move after move after move after move
[2:02:56.220 --> 2:03:02.300]  and you see Russia telling neocon US senators, you're not welcome here, and Israel telling
[2:03:02.300 --> 2:03:05.980]  all the Islamists in our Congress, you're not welcome here to come here and try to overthrow,
[2:03:05.980 --> 2:03:11.900]  I mean, people are fighting back, also this is huge, Trump administration to create special
[2:03:11.900 --> 2:03:16.940]  office of transparency to expedite release of DOJ documents, unfortunately they're not
[2:03:16.940 --> 2:03:22.620]  charging Comey at this time, just like we see Barr saying, oh, there's no foul play with Epstein,
[2:03:23.180 --> 2:03:27.740]  he's there to clean stuff up and have an alliance in the government and try to stop the civil war
[2:03:27.740 --> 2:03:33.420]  in the government, but the left isn't stopping, I'd love them to stop and we can make America
[2:03:33.420 --> 2:03:36.860]  great again and fix the country and move on, I don't want to just piddly around and fight them
[2:03:36.860 --> 2:03:41.820]  all day, I want them to go away with their stolen money, but they're not, just like Napoleon got
[2:03:41.820 --> 2:03:46.140]  put on an island and he came back and formed his army again, finally he wouldn't give him, you know,
[2:03:46.140 --> 2:03:51.420]  a hundred troops and his generals to reconstitute, oh, you'd have your generals pretend to be a king,
[2:03:51.420 --> 2:03:56.940]  he used them to launch another, another giant war, got his ass hated to him, finally, by Lord
[2:03:56.940 --> 2:04:01.980]  Wellington, and we're right back at that point again, we're going to have to indict these people
[2:04:01.980 --> 2:04:06.300]  and lock them up for espionage, they're not going to stop, okay, we've got all the evidence,
[2:04:06.940 --> 2:04:09.740]  it's not going to hurt to stop Marcus, the right thing to do, they're the ones trying to overthrow
[2:04:09.740 --> 2:04:13.980]  the country, so we've got to move against them, like Benedict Arnold, they've got to indict them,
[2:04:13.980 --> 2:04:41.980]  lock their ass up, throw away the key, we'll be right back.
[2:04:41.980 --> 2:04:47.420]  With the PM pack and the eight pack power stack, you can rest easy and simplify your routine,
[2:04:47.420 --> 2:04:53.100]  containing four original formulas, the PM rest and recover pack will build up your body's defenses
[2:04:53.100 --> 2:04:58.780]  and help you get restful, satisfying sleep every night, containing bone support, krill oil, sound
[2:04:58.780 --> 2:05:04.620]  sleep, and immune support formulas, the PM packet was created to support improving your body's bones
[2:05:04.620 --> 2:05:09.260]  and immune system, all while you rest from the day's work, when combined with the AM wake up and
[2:05:09.260 --> 2:05:14.380]  work packet, it makes the eight pack power stack the new can't miss info wars life product.
[2:05:39.260 --> 2:05:44.300]  In their power, words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen,
[2:05:44.300 --> 2:05:51.420]  the enunciation of truth, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[2:05:51.420 --> 2:05:55.980]  You designed it sir, you wanted it foolproof, you told me every television in longer cruelty and
[2:05:55.980 --> 2:06:00.540]  injustice, intolerance and depression, and where once you have the freedom to object,
[2:06:00.540 --> 2:06:05.660]  this thing can speak as you saw fit, you now have sensors and systems of surveillance,
[2:06:05.660 --> 2:06:10.540]  perwessing your conformity and selecting your submachine cameras, how did this happen?
[2:06:11.180 --> 2:06:15.980]  Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others,
[2:06:15.980 --> 2:06:21.580]  they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty,
[2:06:21.580 --> 2:06:28.540]  you need only look into a mirror, I know why you did it, I know you were afraid, who would
[2:06:28.540 --> 2:06:35.500]  be looking me, war, terror, disease, there were a myriad of problems to inspire to corrupt your
[2:06:35.500 --> 2:06:41.500]  reason and rob you of your common sense, fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned
[2:06:41.500 --> 2:06:47.340]  to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler, he promised you order, he promised you peace,
[2:06:47.340 --> 2:06:51.020]  and all he demanded in return was your silent obedient consent.
[2:06:51.020 --> 2:07:03.580]  There is a war, it's happening now, it will decide the fate of humanity,
[2:07:03.580 --> 2:07:09.900]  the time to choose sides has come, we are the resistance, we are the info war.
[2:07:09.900 --> 2:07:21.180]  Hi folks, I'm here to tell you all about Murph's ****, you see Facebook won't let us
[2:07:21.180 --> 2:07:27.500]  use the word **** in any advertisements, they also won't let us show **** shunt **** or ****.
[2:07:28.860 --> 2:07:34.220]  Hippies, here at Murph's **** we got tons of stuff for all your outdoor and self-protection
[2:07:34.220 --> 2:07:39.740]  needs, so much so that this is one of the only camera angles in the store that we can show you
[2:07:39.740 --> 2:07:47.500]  without violating Facebook's rules. We got it all, and in real life none of the stuff in the
[2:07:47.500 --> 2:07:57.820]  store is covered up or blurry, we got a great selection of **** **** **** **** **** **** and
[2:07:57.820 --> 2:08:03.500]  water bottles, so whether you're trying to stock up for a great pheasant, whitetail or turkey trip,
[2:08:03.500 --> 2:08:08.060]  or you're just trying to exercise your second amendment right to protect your family and own
[2:08:08.060 --> 2:08:14.380]  a **** **** or ****, come on down to Murph's **** before you'll get the most bang for your buck.
[2:08:25.740 --> 2:08:30.540]  I've got a tiger in my tail that's playing to see
[2:08:30.540 --> 2:08:41.860]  me. I won't be much when you get through with me. He never gives up. He's Alex Jones, broadcasting
[2:08:41.860 --> 2:08:49.780]  from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide. Well, Cale Murfrey is our guest at MurfsGuns.com.
[2:08:49.780 --> 2:08:55.780]  We aired this earlier in the week. I had it posted at newswars.com and then forewars.com
[2:08:55.780 --> 2:09:00.380]  over the weekend. I said, I got to find out who this little gun shop in a medium sized
[2:09:00.380 --> 2:09:05.580]  city of Oklahoma is because they did a super good commercial, much better than you see
[2:09:05.580 --> 2:09:10.380]  on national television. It turned out it's a real gun shop, popular all over the country,
[2:09:10.380 --> 2:09:16.300]  not a sponsor of ours, which they were. MurfsGuns and Cale is the third generation owner of Murfs
[2:09:16.300 --> 2:09:21.460]  Guns in Duncan, Oklahoma. He's buying the store from his father and uncle in 2013. Cale has
[2:09:21.460 --> 2:09:25.140]  been working hard to grow the online presence and recognition of his gun store. And I said
[2:09:25.140 --> 2:09:30.020]  he did a damn good job here on a higher end to do our marketing. But the big story is
[2:09:30.020 --> 2:09:35.540]  how they got censored. Now, you can't say the word gun or shotgun or handgun or ammo.
[2:09:35.540 --> 2:09:40.220]  And again, with AI watching it now, Facebook saying you won't be able to text it just like
[2:09:40.220 --> 2:09:44.660]  my names. First, they said you can't say Alex Jones or Info Wars. You try to use the WhatsApp.
[2:09:44.660 --> 2:09:49.260]  They're blocking talk of guns. So this is Congress has got to act. I mean, these things
[2:09:49.260 --> 2:09:53.540]  are bigger than utilities. Imagine if AT&T said, we've got AI listening to your phone.
[2:09:53.540 --> 2:09:58.140]  And if you say the wrong word, we're going to cut in on it. Well, Facebook's doing that.
[2:09:58.140 --> 2:10:02.660]  I was just warning of this three months ago. Now they're doing it. Remember CNN said, well,
[2:10:02.660 --> 2:10:06.780]  we're at Jones. You can't say his name on Facebook unless it's negative. And if you
[2:10:06.780 --> 2:10:10.900]  do say it positive, you'll be banned. But they said, we're also looking to see if people
[2:10:10.900 --> 2:10:15.300]  are talking about him on WhatsApp. That's private messengers. And they said, yes, we're
[2:10:15.300 --> 2:10:21.340]  watching you there. So this is beyond what the Chai comms are even doing. So Cale, thanks
[2:10:21.340 --> 2:10:26.140]  for coming on with us. And thanks for fighting back, you know, Dick Sporting Goods. I mean,
[2:10:26.140 --> 2:10:30.100]  Dick is really goes by his name here, doesn't he? Nothing against people have the name Richard,
[2:10:30.100 --> 2:10:34.260]  but Dick's is saying they're anti-gun. They're going to pull guns out. Period. That is, I
[2:10:34.260 --> 2:10:39.660]  think, building towards confiscation. So I'm glad you are fighting back, my friend.
[2:10:39.660 --> 2:10:46.380]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for having me. Thanks for having time to join us. So tell us what happened
[2:10:46.380 --> 2:10:53.420]  to you and why you did this. Well, a friend of mine, I were having breakfast one morning.
[2:10:53.420 --> 2:11:00.580]  I was kind of telling him how hard it was to advertise on Facebook. No, but this brilliant
[2:11:00.580 --> 2:11:07.820]  idea out. You know, what if we said everything that Facebook won't allow us to say, but we
[2:11:07.820 --> 2:11:16.180]  censor. And so he came up with this great idea. It's all bleak. Where every time it's
[2:11:16.180 --> 2:11:21.220]  done, it's talking to rivals, officials, it's alert. Hey, Mercer, man, I really want to
[2:11:21.220 --> 2:11:24.900]  get you on. We're going to reconnect on your Skype. We're having a Skype problem here.
[2:11:24.900 --> 2:11:27.740]  Hell, you just might have to fly down here to Austin or drive down here and be in studio
[2:11:27.740 --> 2:11:31.620]  with us. But again, we love what you're doing over there. We're going to work on that here
[2:11:31.620 --> 2:11:37.140]  for just a minute and get back with you because we are radio show. So you are pretty. Seriously,
[2:11:37.140 --> 2:11:42.620]  folks, this shows the level we've gotten to where last week, the Republican Party put
[2:11:42.620 --> 2:11:48.180]  out just a color online brochure that said, we want strong women to join the Trump campaign.
[2:11:48.180 --> 2:11:53.220]  If you believe in America and women empowered and America and having women at the corporate
[2:11:53.220 --> 2:11:57.260]  leadership level, Donald Trump's launched a leadership council to get women into even
[2:11:57.260 --> 2:12:01.820]  more leadership positions. He's put more women in leadership positions than last two presidents
[2:12:01.820 --> 2:12:07.540]  combined. And he wants to have you join his campaign. And they said, you are not allowed
[2:12:07.540 --> 2:12:16.300]  period. You are not allowed to say strong women because somebody might not be a woman.
[2:12:16.300 --> 2:12:19.740]  That's misgendering. You know, that didn't make sense. It makes perfect sense. If you
[2:12:19.740 --> 2:12:24.580]  can sabotage the very language you totally control that long, California says, if you
[2:12:24.580 --> 2:12:30.180]  misgender someone, he's a, hey, sir, and the guy's got a short hair cut and looks like
[2:12:30.180 --> 2:12:34.300]  me. I'm a woman. How dare you? I've got a beard, but you ain't never seen a birded
[2:12:34.300 --> 2:12:43.180]  lady. That's a crime. So this is a war on reality, a total power grab. It's absolutely
[2:12:43.180 --> 2:12:48.340]  out of control. And it's incredibly dangerous. But I can't wait to talk to this fellow because
[2:12:48.340 --> 2:12:52.700]  he put together a really good ad. So we're going to work on his audio. Maybe get him
[2:12:52.700 --> 2:12:58.300]  an external mic. Maybe we'll teleport that up to Oklahoma. Northerners up there. Part
[2:12:58.300 --> 2:13:02.100]  of Oklahoma is part of Texas. And then we'll get right back to him. But I wanted to air
[2:13:02.100 --> 2:13:07.860]  this little piece. Smart meter radiation attached to millions of homes as a public service
[2:13:07.860 --> 2:13:12.900]  announcement is incredibly important. So again, smart meter radiation attached to millions
[2:13:12.900 --> 2:13:18.660]  of homes. The only way we're going to warn people about the smart meters being basically
[2:13:18.660 --> 2:13:24.060]  4G, the 5G, not linked, but proven to be causing cancer is to admit this is happening. So we're
[2:13:24.060 --> 2:13:28.060]  going to go out to break playing part of this report. The government says you should set
[2:13:28.060 --> 2:13:32.940]  your thermostat to 80-something degrees at night to save the earth and save the planet.
[2:13:32.940 --> 2:13:37.340]  The idea that carbon dioxide is bad, it's actually good. Be liquefied. All the CO2 in
[2:13:37.340 --> 2:13:42.500]  the atmosphere down to be less than an inch. It was liquefied. I mean, it's one of the
[2:13:42.500 --> 2:13:46.820]  most trace gases out there essential for life. Didn't have it. We'd all die. Plants would
[2:13:46.820 --> 2:13:52.860]  not put out oxygen. So that's what's going on. First they said 80-something degrees.
[2:13:52.860 --> 2:13:57.100]  Now they're saying 78 degrees. They're trying to walk it back because of the backlash. But
[2:13:57.100 --> 2:14:01.860]  remember, they told us 10 years ago, oh, the smart meters will turn your thermostat down
[2:14:01.860 --> 2:14:07.420]  for you at night. And your smart phones will interface with it and track what you're doing.
[2:14:07.420 --> 2:14:12.580]  The government then under Obama was saying, we'll just do this without you consenting.
[2:14:12.580 --> 2:14:20.260]  We do know that some smart meters produce data that has enough granularity that experts
[2:14:20.260 --> 2:14:24.780]  are able to go in and tell what kind of appliances people are using. Despite concerns from groups
[2:14:24.780 --> 2:14:30.580]  like the ACLU, the utility says it's built cybersecurity into the meters and the software
[2:14:30.580 --> 2:14:35.540]  that runs them. But information's still being gleaned. They're building a profile on the
[2:14:35.540 --> 2:14:40.580]  consumer, not only their usage but the time of day. You can tell when a homeowner is home
[2:14:40.580 --> 2:14:46.100]  or not by this monitoring. We don't know if their system can be hacked. And then there's
[2:14:46.100 --> 2:14:51.580]  the concern of radio frequency emissions, which some say can cause health issues. We spend
[2:14:51.580 --> 2:14:55.700]  a lot of time out here. We're going to break. It isn't some say. It's all the major studies
[2:14:55.700 --> 2:15:01.660]  it's conclusive. Cigarettes cost cancer. 5G, 4G, 3G cost cancer. Cell towers give your
[2:15:01.660 --> 2:15:06.300]  kids big giant brain tumors. Brain tumors are up tens of thousands of percent. I see
[2:15:06.300 --> 2:15:10.420]  kids everywhere with their heads shaved and surgery points on them. It's all like five
[2:15:10.420 --> 2:15:16.220]  kids yesterday that had part of their brains cut out. I wasn't even looking for it.
[2:15:16.220 --> 2:15:20.340]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector
[2:15:20.340 --> 2:15:25.780]  without all the speculation. No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the
[2:15:25.780 --> 2:15:30.180]  ups and downs of Bitcoin. Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain

[2:15:34.820 --> 2:15:38.900]  inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush. The money is
[2:15:38.900 --> 2:15:43.660]  in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets, not a security
[2:15:43.660 --> 2:15:48.580]  IPO or note. Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program
[2:15:48.580 --> 2:15:54.580]  with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month. Don't miss

[2:16:10.740 --> 2:16:13.860]  risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing on an offer to buy or sell
[2:16:13.860 --> 2:16:16.380]  a security which requires an offering document.

[2:18:16.980 --> 2:18:22.820]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[2:18:22.820 --> 2:18:27.220]  in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who
[2:18:27.220 --> 2:18:31.020]  actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation. And today, the communist
[2:18:31.020 --> 2:18:36.700]  Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago. And we've seen massive increases
[2:18:36.700 --> 2:18:41.900]  in polls, support for the president, and what he's doing in this trade war, once China put
[2:18:41.900 --> 2:18:46.580]  pressure on our farmers. That's beautiful. Americans aren't going to be bullied, and
[2:18:46.580 --> 2:18:51.260]  we aren't going to back down. So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clinton's of the
[2:18:51.260 --> 2:18:55.220]  world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give
[2:18:55.220 --> 2:19:00.860]  up. And all you've done is awaken the human spirit. And the human spirit lives at Infowars.com
[2:19:00.860 --> 2:19:06.220]  and NewsWars.com. And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links, because
[2:19:06.220 --> 2:19:13.220]  we are the light, the dark of the night. We are the resistance. We are 1776 worldwide.
[2:19:36.220 --> 2:19:49.740]  This is an example of a small business person fighting back and putting out a viral video
[2:19:49.740 --> 2:19:54.860]  that shows how Facebook won't let you say the word guns, firearms, ammunition, shotguns,
[2:19:54.860 --> 2:19:59.660]  rifles, you name it. And again, they've now moved on to everything else. In all these
[2:19:59.660 --> 2:20:05.180]  other words, Congress has got to act. So get into why you did this, recap what you were
[2:20:05.180 --> 2:20:11.060]  saying earlier before your audio cut out and where you see all this is going. And again,
[2:20:11.060 --> 2:20:15.700]  it's a hilarious gun store ad, bypasses Facebook censorship. It's on Infowars.com. So tell
[2:20:15.700 --> 2:20:22.420]  us, tell us more about this. Yeah, Alex. So a friend of mine and I were having breakfast
[2:20:22.420 --> 2:20:27.100]  one morning and I was telling him about the struggles I was having about advertising
[2:20:27.100 --> 2:20:33.340]  on Facebook. And he said, you know what, what if you said all those, all the words, guns,
[2:20:33.340 --> 2:20:41.060]  rifles, pistols, shotguns, but you bleeped it out and you make eight videos where every
[2:20:41.060 --> 2:20:44.900]  one of those words is bleeped out. So that's what we did.
[2:20:44.900 --> 2:20:50.620]  Well, it was really smart and it's gotten a lot of attention. Tell us about this particular
[2:20:50.620 --> 2:20:56.740]  actor. He's a funny guy. Oh, he was great. He owns the media production company. He's
[2:20:56.740 --> 2:21:03.700]  called X5 Production in Birmingham and actually a friend of mine that I was having breakfast
[2:21:03.700 --> 2:21:09.420]  with new Taylor Robinson. And he said, you know, this is, this is your guy. This is the
[2:21:09.420 --> 2:21:15.180]  actor that you want. And what's really funny is whenever you talk to him in real life,
[2:21:15.180 --> 2:21:19.780]  he's very laid back. He's not anything like that. Well, I'm actually just like this guy
[2:21:19.780 --> 2:21:20.780]  in real life. So
[2:21:20.780 --> 2:21:25.900]  Oh, are you really? Well, I'll call you next time. I know. No, no, no. I want to hire him
[2:21:25.900 --> 2:21:30.260]  to do an ad for us because seriously, we're in the same position where you can't say Alex
[2:21:30.260 --> 2:21:34.300]  Jones. You can't say info wars. You can't say strong women. So I'm going to take all
[2:21:34.300 --> 2:21:38.060]  the things that Facebook has actually banned and maybe have somebody like him saying, Hey,
[2:21:38.060 --> 2:21:41.860]  I'm here from Facebook. Let me tell you what you can't say. Shut your damn mouth, Americans.
[2:21:41.860 --> 2:21:45.420]  You can't say this. You can't say that. I mean, he's a good guy.
[2:21:45.420 --> 2:21:51.060]  Oh, he was a great guy. And we, what we want to do was we just wanted to, you know, kind
[2:21:51.060 --> 2:21:57.060]  of poke fun at both sides of it and, um, you know, create something that we thought that
[2:21:57.060 --> 2:22:01.500]  our customers would like and our customers would think was funny. And I think we've done
[2:22:01.500 --> 2:22:08.180]  that so far. What's the response been like? Oh, it's been great. I've had Pete. I had
[2:22:08.180 --> 2:22:14.540]  a guy call me from Amsterdam. Um, we've had several emails, even from Ireland, you know,
[2:22:14.540 --> 2:22:19.540]  telling us to, to, um, you know, keep fighting, keep fighting a good fight and that they love
[2:22:19.540 --> 2:22:24.220]  the, they love the commercial. And what's even funny too, is, you know, there's been
[2:22:24.220 --> 2:22:30.340]  almost negative, you know, no negative feedback, you know, even, even the anti gun people have
[2:22:30.340 --> 2:22:36.540]  emailed us and said, you know what, I can appreciate something like this. This is funny.
[2:22:36.540 --> 2:22:40.500]  But think about the danger of the assault on the language where you can't say strong
[2:22:40.500 --> 2:22:45.620]  women because that misgenders people. If someone sees the word woman, I mean, this is a cult.
[2:22:45.620 --> 2:22:49.820]  This is so dangerous. This is beyond things like 1984.
[2:22:49.820 --> 2:22:58.620]  It is. And you know, I wish they wouldn't answer stuff like that, but no, there's, there's
[2:22:58.620 --> 2:23:03.300]  rules that they have that I have to play by. And so that's what we did. And we were able
[2:23:03.300 --> 2:23:09.300]  to create these, these videos. And what's funny is a lot of people don't know.
[2:23:09.300 --> 2:23:15.740]  Sorry, go ahead. Well, a lot of people don't know is that we, we did create eight of them.
[2:23:15.740 --> 2:23:21.100]  So the next one is actually coming out tomorrow at nine 15 and they all have, you know, every
[2:23:21.100 --> 2:23:25.300]  time it says any of these words, it's bleeped out.
[2:23:25.300 --> 2:23:29.300]  Well, I would love for you to send us that as well. If you send it to us, we'll premiere
[2:23:29.300 --> 2:23:34.500]  it at nine 15 as well on info wars.com because these are really, really funny ads. So we've
[2:23:34.500 --> 2:23:38.860]  only seen the first and now we're going to get to see seven more.
[2:23:38.860 --> 2:23:41.220]  That is correct. Yes, sir.
[2:23:41.220 --> 2:23:46.260]  So I would say that's money, money well spent. I like how you worked around what Facebook
[2:23:46.260 --> 2:23:50.260]  is doing. So they haven't restricted these ads yet.
[2:23:50.260 --> 2:23:55.740]  No, they haven't. And you know, I'm, I'm kind of surprised they haven't, but you know,
[2:23:55.740 --> 2:24:01.220]  we actually never say guns, rifles, pistols or shotguns. So I don't know what their grounds
[2:24:01.220 --> 2:24:03.180]  would be if they didn't want to take it off.
[2:24:03.180 --> 2:24:07.980]  Well, you know, they're just going to probably change their rules, which is really frightening.
[2:24:07.980 --> 2:24:12.300]  How are folks responding to all this censorship and things that are going on up in Oklahoma?
[2:24:12.300 --> 2:24:19.300]  Oh, you know, there's, of course, you know, in, in Oklahoma and especially in my part
[2:24:19.300 --> 2:24:25.260]  of the country in Duncan, Oklahoma, most people are pro guns. So they do think it's, it's
[2:24:25.260 --> 2:24:29.420]  pretty ridiculous, but there's ways around it. You know, if you want to, if an individual
[2:24:29.420 --> 2:24:34.060]  wants to sell, you know, two guns and they want to put it on Facebook, you know, they
[2:24:34.060 --> 2:24:38.900]  could take a picture of it and say, you know, the cup of coffee is on the, the cup of coffee
[2:24:38.900 --> 2:24:44.140]  on the left is, you know, X amount of dollars and the cup of coffee on the right is X amount
[2:24:44.140 --> 2:24:45.140]  of dollars.
[2:24:45.140 --> 2:24:49.380]  But Facebook won't pick up on it because you didn't say guns. So there's ways around it.
[2:24:49.380 --> 2:24:52.180]  So people still do it.
[2:24:52.180 --> 2:24:56.900]  And that's why Facebook and Twitter and the European Union want to ban memes. They actually
[2:24:56.900 --> 2:25:01.260]  passed a law saying you can be fined thousands of euros if you don't get a meme pre approved
[2:25:01.260 --> 2:25:06.460]  by the government. That's just taking an image and making a joke about it because AI can't
[2:25:06.460 --> 2:25:11.140]  tell what humor is and AI can't tell when you're making a joke. And that's really the
[2:25:11.140 --> 2:25:12.460]  beauty of the human mind.
[2:25:12.460 --> 2:25:17.580]  So we're being told by Elon Musk of the age of humans is over. Our age is just beginning
[2:25:17.580 --> 2:25:23.140]  unless we advocate our authority over to the system.
[2:25:23.140 --> 2:25:28.180]  That is, that is correct. I mean, we, we need to continue to support those who support the
[2:25:28.180 --> 2:25:33.940]  second amendment. And, you know, I, I am all for the second amendment. I'm all for electing
[2:25:33.940 --> 2:25:38.460]  people that are pro second amendment. And, you know, it's really funny. I've done detailed
[2:25:38.460 --> 2:25:44.660]  research and I've never sold a gun to somebody that was anti gun. So we need to continue
[2:25:44.660 --> 2:25:49.580]  to put those people in office that, you know, that are pro second amendment that are going
[2:25:49.580 --> 2:25:50.580]  to fight for our rights.
[2:25:50.580 --> 2:25:55.060]  By the way, is that a new T shirt that says Merse and it shows a pheasant guns is blurred
[2:25:55.060 --> 2:25:59.820]  out. That is, is that part of this advertising campaign?
[2:25:59.820 --> 2:26:05.540]  It is. Yes, sir. And in fact, we were, we were planning on making some T shirts, but
[2:26:05.540 --> 2:26:10.260]  we were just a little bit behind the ball. And whenever we released this video, man,
[2:26:10.260 --> 2:26:15.220]  it went over like gangbusters and people were telling us, you know, get a shirt, get a shirt.
[2:26:15.220 --> 2:26:19.540]  So we actually have shirts available on our website and we'll also have water bottles
[2:26:19.540 --> 2:26:20.540]  as well.
[2:26:20.540 --> 2:26:24.540]  That's awesome. So shirts are allowed, water bottles are allowed. Facebook won't get mad
[2:26:24.540 --> 2:26:29.820]  about that. But seriously, I hope that you'll send me or maybe I should get one of complimentary
[2:26:29.820 --> 2:26:35.180]  Merse guns in extra large, because that is a handsome, simple, good old fashioned shirt.
[2:26:35.180 --> 2:26:38.780]  And people ask why it's blurred. Well, that's not to make the Lib Tards angry. We don't
[2:26:38.780 --> 2:26:41.060]  want to trigger them with free speech.
[2:26:41.060 --> 2:26:47.340]  That is correct. If you'll send me your address, I'll send you a couple where we're on a water
[2:26:47.340 --> 2:26:48.340]  bottle for you.
[2:26:48.340 --> 2:26:53.180]  All right. Well, listen, Kale, absolutely. We'll write a blurb tomorrow when your second
[2:26:53.180 --> 2:26:57.900]  one drops and Merse guns dot com. We really appreciate you coming. We got about a minute
[2:26:57.900 --> 2:27:00.700]  left. Anything else you want to add?
[2:27:00.700 --> 2:27:06.420]  I just want to say I appreciate you having me on here and stay tuned. We do have seven
[2:27:06.420 --> 2:27:08.980]  more commercials coming. So I hope you enjoy them.
[2:27:08.980 --> 2:27:12.220]  All right. Well, let's all hang together on the first amendment as well, because I know
[2:27:12.220 --> 2:27:15.580]  you're getting around it and it's cute and it's funny and it's smart. You should do it.
[2:27:15.580 --> 2:27:19.780]  We should adapt and improvise, but we should also go to Congress and say, listen, these
[2:27:19.780 --> 2:27:24.820]  are bigger than telecoms, bigger than AT&T, and they need to stop this because they're
[2:27:24.820 --> 2:27:29.580]  trying to block Christian groups. Like I said, they're blocking Republican ads. Twitter blocked
[2:27:29.580 --> 2:27:33.780]  the leader of the Senate when he's just linked to video people for death, threatening him
[2:27:33.780 --> 2:27:37.820]  at his house. They left up the people that put it up, but wouldn't let the leader of
[2:27:37.820 --> 2:27:42.500]  the Senate say it was wrong. I mean, this is dangerous.
[2:27:42.500 --> 2:27:47.060]  It is very dangerous. And, you know, I wish everybody was able to play by the same set
[2:27:47.060 --> 2:27:51.500]  of rules. You know, if you beat a gun store owner, I'm limited on that. But the one thing
[2:27:51.500 --> 2:27:56.340]  that I am thankful for is I know God is still in control. And so that's what I hang my hat
[2:27:56.340 --> 2:28:00.700]  on every night I go to sleep and every morning I'll wake up. And so I'm thankful for that,
[2:28:00.700 --> 2:28:03.820]  but we do need to continue to fight for our freedoms and our liberties.
[2:28:03.820 --> 2:28:06.460]  That's right. Well, Kale Murfrey, thank you so much. We'll talk to you again soon and
[2:28:06.460 --> 2:28:07.460]  Godspeed.
[2:28:07.460 --> 2:28:08.940]  All right. Thank you.
[2:28:08.940 --> 2:28:13.660]  Love what they're doing. We need every mom and pop to fight back the same way. Build
[2:28:13.660 --> 2:28:20.220]  alternative systems, but fight on the platforms when you have a pain in the neck, a real pain

[2:29:17.420 --> 2:29:23.940]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists
[2:29:23.940 --> 2:29:29.500]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war. Borders are being
[2:29:29.500 --> 2:29:36.860]  broken and sovereignty is being challenged. The world is going to change and how it changes
[2:29:36.860 --> 2:29:42.820]  will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails. The
[2:29:42.820 --> 2:29:48.980]  system is vulnerable. Electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could
[2:29:48.980 --> 2:29:55.300]  be empty in three days. Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give
[2:29:55.300 --> 2:30:00.860]  you a fighting chance in the next level and being without puts you at the mercy of others

[2:30:07.260 --> 2:30:16.260]  filter today. Support mankind by being prepared and support freedom by buying from infowarstore.com.
[2:30:16.260 --> 2:30:23.180]  I got a plug for the Patriot points I get. I got $180 so far this year and I feel like
[2:30:23.180 --> 2:30:26.860]  I'm stealing from you. I buy so much in the store because I mean I don't want to give
[2:30:26.860 --> 2:30:29.340]  that money to Walmart. I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate
[2:30:29.340 --> 2:30:32.900]  it to causes I don't believe in. So I'd rather give that money to you. And they're getting
[2:30:32.900 --> 2:30:37.660]  quality products. The products that I do receive have changed my life. I mean the X2 has really
[2:30:37.660 --> 2:30:41.940]  done a lot for me. I've lost weight. My brain works a whole lot better. My kids they use
[2:30:41.940 --> 2:30:46.700]  the toothpaste. My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks
[2:30:46.700 --> 2:30:50.380]  it and it gets rid of his sore throat. Well sir let me break this down for you. I want
[2:30:50.380 --> 2:30:54.500]  high quality stuff in there. I want a good price. But I've kind of habituated everybody
[2:30:54.500 --> 2:30:59.140]  to where everybody buys when it's 50% off. I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off. And
[2:30:59.140 --> 2:31:02.820]  so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth. Thank you
[2:31:02.820 --> 2:31:06.940]  so much for the plugs. But listen when people get the Patriot points a lot of times it makes
[2:31:06.940 --> 2:31:10.940]  things a loss later because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship
[2:31:10.940 --> 2:31:14.900]  then we're doing 50% off and then you do something like that. We have Patriot points
[2:31:14.900 --> 2:31:19.780]  we lose money but that's okay. Thanks for the support. We've had this in for two weeks.
[2:31:19.780 --> 2:31:23.420]  I've been so busy I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news but it's
[2:31:23.420 --> 2:31:28.820]  very exciting. It's super silver skin cream. It's got all of these benefits. Too many to

[2:32:46.180 --> 2:32:53.180]  Like I said, we've got Greg Reese from Savannah Hernandez joining the broadcast in the fourth
[2:32:54.740 --> 2:32:59.220]  hour today. They're going to be cow hosting. They just got back from Hong Kong. That's
[2:32:59.220 --> 2:33:06.220]  really a big deal. Chinese troops began invading with wheeled tanks and armored vehicles as
[2:33:07.500 --> 2:33:12.540]  threatened. Our media is basically playing it down like, oh, it's causing unease in Hong
[2:33:12.540 --> 2:33:17.180]  Kong that Chinese troops just rolled in. They have promised that they are going to
[2:33:17.180 --> 2:33:24.180]  be attacking the population if they try to go out and demonstrate. It's estimated that
[2:33:24.180 --> 2:33:30.940]  80% of the population there does not want to be under Chinese mainland rule. They are
[2:33:30.940 --> 2:33:36.180]  the children and grandchildren of those that fled 70 years ago when Mao Zedong took over
[2:33:36.180 --> 2:33:41.660]  the mainland and began slaughtering over 100 million people. But they never got in trouble
[2:33:41.660 --> 2:33:48.100]  like Hitler. So basically the government put in by somebody as bad or worse than Hitler
[2:33:48.100 --> 2:33:54.660]  is now invading their nation and now shipping in massive Chinese Communist party nationals
[2:33:54.660 --> 2:34:01.260]  to take over. And they're angry. They're upset. So I've got a bunch of other news I want to
[2:34:01.260 --> 2:34:05.900]  hit, but we'll do that next segment. I want to play Paul Joseph Watson's report. He just
[2:34:05.900 --> 2:34:11.780]  got back yesterday as well, breaking down what's really happening in Hong Kong. But this is
[2:34:11.780 --> 2:34:18.780]  a big, big deal. And then engineering school lowers entry bar for women. Critics blast
[2:34:20.020 --> 2:34:26.520]  move as insulting to women, especially current female engineers. And the Army Rangers have
[2:34:26.520 --> 2:34:33.520]  lowered standards yet again so that they can put women into the meat grinder. Also, I mentioned
[2:34:33.520 --> 2:34:37.860]  this at the start of the show. It's linked up at newswars.com and infowars.com. It's
[2:34:37.860 --> 2:34:41.860]  not just happening in Austin. I first heard about this two months ago. Now it's happening
[2:34:41.860 --> 2:34:47.980]  all over areas in the southern United States where they've had temperatures over 100 degrees
[2:34:47.980 --> 2:34:54.740]  weeks on end, hundreds of dog deaths in Austin, because most of them don't get reported, thousands
[2:34:54.740 --> 2:34:59.060]  all over the country. I personally know people who've dogs have died that didn't tell the
[2:34:59.060 --> 2:35:05.100]  news or the health department and will tell you what's happening. Dog deaths across U.S.
[2:35:05.100 --> 2:35:10.140]  linked to toxic blue, green algae in lakes and ponds. But here's Paul Joseph Watson's
[2:35:10.140 --> 2:35:35.640]  report on Hong Kong, tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons, live rounds fired. That was
[2:35:35.640 --> 2:35:40.340]  my leisurely Sunday afternoon in Hong Kong. While other protesters out on the streets,
[2:35:40.340 --> 2:35:45.140]  they have five demands. One, the full withdrawal of a bill that would allow suspects in Hong
[2:35:45.140 --> 2:35:50.300]  Kong to be extradited to China. Two, an inquiry into allegations of police brutality. Three,
[2:35:50.300 --> 2:35:56.060]  amnesty for the arrested protesters. Four, universal suffrage to allow 100% of the city's
[2:35:56.060 --> 2:36:01.340]  executive council, which is dominated by Beijing, to be voted in by the people of Hong Kong.
[2:36:01.340 --> 2:36:06.340]  The fifth demand is that authorities stop referring to the demonstrations as riots,
[2:36:06.340 --> 2:36:10.060]  which is probably going to be difficult given that you basically have two armies dressed
[2:36:10.060 --> 2:36:15.180]  in battle gear, gas masks and armed with weapons. One side lobbing tear gas, the other side
[2:36:15.180 --> 2:36:27.100]  lobbing bricks. It certainly looked like a riot to me. The Hong Kong government has
[2:36:27.100 --> 2:36:32.300]  said over and over again that it won't accept any of the five demands, so the violence will
[2:36:32.300 --> 2:36:37.620]  only escalate. Many protesters have also said they think violence is part of protest and
[2:36:37.620 --> 2:36:43.820]  that the threat to their freedoms is so existential, they need to resort to all means possible.
[2:36:43.820 --> 2:36:49.100]  We talked to several people who said that the Chinese government is using mass migration
[2:36:49.100 --> 2:37:03.180]  to subsume Hong Kong's identity and weaken its unity. Does that remind you of anything?
[2:37:03.180 --> 2:37:07.860]  Chinese people are allowed to move to Hong Kong and get immediate access to the jobs market
[2:37:07.860 --> 2:37:13.340]  housing and health care benefits. They're even allowed to vote. This destabilization
[2:37:13.340 --> 2:37:19.060]  and subversion of Hong Kong is driving a great deal of the resentment and it goes both ways.
[2:37:19.060 --> 2:37:23.820]  Dozens of Chinese taxi drivers in Hong Kong are flying huge Chinese flags from the back
[2:37:23.820 --> 2:37:28.900]  of their cars. There have also been small sporadic pro-China protests in the city,
[2:37:28.900 --> 2:37:35.540]  but they're minuscule in comparison to the anti-Beijing protests. Despite dressing similar,
[2:37:35.540 --> 2:37:41.540]  the Hong Kong protesters are very different from America's snarling, spitting, obnoxious
[2:37:41.540 --> 2:37:46.940]  Antifa thugs. Whereas Antifa attacks the media and refuses to be filmed, the Hong Kong
[2:37:46.940 --> 2:37:52.340]  protesters go out of their way to protect the media and prevent journalists from being
[2:37:52.340 --> 2:37:58.420]  harmed. Whereas Antifa burns the American flag, the Hong Kong protesters fly it proudly.
[2:37:58.420 --> 2:38:03.940]  They've also taken a shining to Pepe the Frog, proving once again that any meme can be reclaimed
[2:38:03.940 --> 2:38:10.140]  and repurposed despite the American media's obsession with denouncing it as a hate symbol.
[2:38:10.140 --> 2:38:15.620]  And no, that doesn't mean the protesters are far right as numerous idiotic, tanky left wing
[2:38:15.620 --> 2:38:20.780]  journalists are claiming. Opposing an authoritarian regime that silences dissent by literally
[2:38:20.780 --> 2:38:26.940]  flattening people doesn't make you far right. It just makes you right. No reasonable person
[2:38:26.940 --> 2:38:32.060]  could deny that the protesters' grievances and fears are entirely authentic. This isn't
[2:38:32.060 --> 2:38:37.380]  a bunch of whiny privileged leftists protesting for rights they already have, just so they
[2:38:37.380 --> 2:38:42.900]  convert you signal about waving a woke banner on social media. This is a nation's youth
[2:38:42.900 --> 2:38:47.660]  fighting for the preservation of its future. They're going up against one of the most fearsome
[2:38:47.660 --> 2:38:53.380]  military regimes on the planet, a nuclear-armed dictatorship that interns millions of members
[2:38:53.380 --> 2:38:59.780]  of minority groups in reeducation camps. They're risking incarceration, torture, and a nightmare
[2:38:59.780 --> 2:39:06.020]  future trapped in China's social credit score system. A minority report-style dystopia where
[2:39:06.020 --> 2:39:10.660]  dissidents who express the wrong political opinions are prevented from using social
[2:39:10.660 --> 2:39:16.260]  media, travelling, or even having bank accounts. Again, remind you of anything.
[2:39:16.260 --> 2:39:22.660]  Dear passengers, people who travel without tickets or behave disorderly as well as being
[2:39:22.660 --> 2:39:28.660]  public areas will be punished according to regulations and the behavior will be recorded
[2:39:28.660 --> 2:39:33.620]  in the individual credit information system. The unsight surveillance aspect of the demonstrations
[2:39:33.620 --> 2:39:38.620]  came to the fore when protesters tore down so-called smart lamps which they fear are
[2:39:38.620 --> 2:39:43.740]  secretly scanning their faces. To give you an idea of how intense China's control over
[2:39:43.740 --> 2:39:48.620]  propaganda and information really is, a local Catholic priest who didn't want to be named
[2:39:48.620 --> 2:39:53.740]  for fear of repercussion said that religious education in China is so tightly controlled
[2:39:53.740 --> 2:40:00.860]  that many people have never even heard of Jesus Christ. The Christian community in Hong Kong
[2:40:00.860 --> 2:40:06.140]  is standing firmly behind the protesters. On Friday night there was a vigil attended by
[2:40:06.140 --> 2:40:10.140]  thousands of participants.
[2:40:21.180 --> 2:40:28.140]  This preceded the monumental human chain, where protesters linked arms for 30 miles
[2:40:28.140 --> 2:40:33.900]  around the entire city. They even climbed up mountains. The event was an homage to the Baltic
[2:40:33.900 --> 2:40:39.340]  way. When two million people joined hands around three countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,
[2:40:39.340 --> 2:40:46.060]  in 1989, to protest against the tyranny of Soviet rule. Which reminds us that the Hong Kong
[2:40:46.060 --> 2:40:52.620]  protest is fundamentally anti-communist. China's graffiti also adorns walls across the city.
[2:40:52.620 --> 2:40:57.500]  The wider Hong Kong population broadly supports the protesters, which is no surprise given that
[2:40:57.500 --> 2:41:04.700]  police have fired tear gas inside shopping malls, subways and densely populated residential areas,
[2:41:04.700 --> 2:41:10.380]  leading in some situations to angry residents banding together and forcing the cops to leave.
[2:41:10.380 --> 2:41:14.220]  Who's responsible for the violence? Police claim they're merely defending themselves
[2:41:14.220 --> 2:41:20.700]  against armed mobs and trying to maintain order. But protesters say the demonstrations were peaceful
[2:41:20.700 --> 2:41:27.020]  up until riot cops were deployed and tear gas was used against them. China has thousands of troops
[2:41:27.020 --> 2:41:42.460]  massing in nearby Shenzhen. Will they be sent into Hong Kong to enact a brutal, bloody crackdown?
[2:41:42.460 --> 2:41:49.500]  Probably not experts say, but Chinese culture is all about avoiding embarrassment, saving face.
[2:41:49.500 --> 2:41:55.180]  If Hong Kong is still in turmoil on October 1st, the 70th anniversary of the founding of
[2:41:55.180 --> 2:42:01.980]  Communist China, that will be the biggest embarrassment imaginable for Beijing. So they have to do
[2:42:01.980 --> 2:42:08.140]  something. And this is China we're talking about. Tiananmen Square was only 30 years ago. What that
[2:42:08.140 --> 2:42:13.660]  something will be remains to be seen, but it certainly isn't going to be printed.
[2:42:16.700 --> 2:42:23.980]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee. And luckily,

[2:44:09.900 --> 2:44:21.580]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air. Go ahead. Alex, God bless you. I have an idea for a new
[2:44:21.580 --> 2:44:26.940]  info wars t-shirt instead of this is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. This is your brain.
[2:44:26.940 --> 2:44:31.660]  This is your brain on 5G. Oh, yeah. Showing your brain, getting fried. Then I have some comments
[2:44:31.660 --> 2:44:36.140]  on your supplements, man. Pull it change my life. I use turbo force, bodies, alpha power,
[2:44:36.140 --> 2:44:42.300]  brain force, fish oil, ultra 12 daily X2 every several days. Now, what I found is really combining
[2:44:42.300 --> 2:44:48.220]  them is so synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products and I
[2:44:48.220 --> 2:44:51.580]  just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them. I just want to say why not. Well,

[2:44:55.820 --> 2:45:00.620]  it's the fish oil or the krill oil or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and bio PQQ
[2:45:00.620 --> 2:45:04.300]  and all the rest of it. All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body. You take

[2:46:15.900 --> 2:46:37.020]  Hey, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:46:37.020 --> 2:46:58.620]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. Who's hosting the fourth hour? You know who.
[2:46:59.340 --> 2:47:05.420]  Savannah Hernandez and Greg Reese back from Hong Kong. It's important. Chinese troops have invaded.
[2:47:05.420 --> 2:47:10.700]  We're going to be breaking it all down. And then, of course, tomorrow I'm going to have wide open
[2:47:10.700 --> 2:47:16.460]  phones and I'm going to get into the technocracy, the transhumanist takeover plan that's now being
[2:47:16.460 --> 2:47:23.100]  admitted everywhere. If you look at the reports we heard earlier, it is simply amazing footage
[2:47:23.100 --> 2:47:32.860]  of the armored vehicles, the tanks rolling across the troops, massing. That story is up on drugsreport.com
[2:47:32.860 --> 2:47:38.060]  and infowarstore.com. If you want to see the raw videos and all of it for yourself.
[2:47:38.940 --> 2:47:43.260]  And also Ilhan Omar demands UN take control of U.S. borders in
[2:47:43.260 --> 2:47:49.660]  mayor of European migrant crisis. Such an important story because the UN is running that operation.
[2:47:51.580 --> 2:47:56.780]  And by the way, I don't do inhalers. This inhaler has been here for about
[2:47:56.780 --> 2:48:02.700]  six months. I can just see people in the document can. There'll be a whole new conspiracy about
[2:48:03.420 --> 2:48:07.820]  the inhaler there. But it doesn't really matter. The only way to get rid of this inhaler is to do
[2:48:07.820 --> 2:48:12.940]  this. There you go. Oh, wow. Actually broke a lot or something. That's a good shot, huh?
[2:48:13.660 --> 2:48:17.660]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, continuing. What else is over here on this table? We've got,
[2:48:19.100 --> 2:48:26.060]  we've got a Trump 2020 $100 bill. I don't think this is, I don't think this is real.
[2:48:26.060 --> 2:48:30.700]  It's kind of like a seashore or something over here. Things just kind of accumulate and pile up on
[2:48:30.700 --> 2:48:35.180]  it. I have a eco science book down here. They're planned to put fluoride in the water and poison
[2:48:35.180 --> 2:48:41.020]  you and your family. Maybe we should talk about that. But again, continuing. I have a few stories
[2:48:41.020 --> 2:48:50.620]  that I want to hit here. But first, we produced a product called Carnivore that has these very
[2:48:50.620 --> 2:48:56.540]  expensive high quality enzymes in it that naturally help your body when you're on an Adkins diet or
[2:48:56.540 --> 2:49:05.100]  a ketosis diet absorb and break down the protein and the fat much better and then also flush you
[2:49:05.100 --> 2:49:10.380]  out. Everybody knows probiotics are really, really good foods that are also been fermented are really,
[2:49:10.380 --> 2:49:15.420]  really good for your guts, upper and lower intestine. But because of all the toxins in the food,
[2:49:15.420 --> 2:49:20.300]  the chemicals and things, a lot of those bacteria get killed, especially if you take antibiotics.
[2:49:20.300 --> 2:49:25.260]  You've got to replace it with, again, really good probiotics is the quickest way to do that with
[2:49:25.260 --> 2:49:32.220]  a regimen. And we sell great fluorolive probiotics at m4wrestore.com. But we also have the Myco ZX
[2:49:32.220 --> 2:49:37.420]  that knocks out the yeast, the candida, the mold. That's something people don't go after. It's
[2:49:37.420 --> 2:49:48.300]  incredible. But Carnivore in the 90 capsule bottle costs a $17.80 something cents because we went
[2:49:48.300 --> 2:49:55.340]  with the very best enzymes, the most high quality, the most concentrated. The 30 pack costs us over
[2:49:55.340 --> 2:50:01.900]  $7 in a nice glass bottle. Those are free right now while the 2000 bottles sell out. In just a
[2:50:01.900 --> 2:50:07.740]  couple days, it'll be a new special. When you get it with DNA Force Plus, with the PQQ, the CoQ10
[2:50:07.740 --> 2:50:12.300]  and all the rest of it for your telomeres, your cells, for a base for everything you do, you
[2:50:12.300 --> 2:50:17.980]  cannot beat that product. But because I want you to experience DNA Force Plus and Carnivore that
[2:50:17.980 --> 2:50:24.620]  goes so well together, you get a free bottle of Carnivore with DNA Force, the 90 count one. And
[2:50:24.620 --> 2:50:30.380]  with Supermell Vitality, you get a free bottle of the 30 count Carnivore. So this is the Trafecta,
[2:50:30.380 --> 2:50:35.340]  the good bacteria with the probiotic, the Myco ZX to knock out the yeast, the candida, the mold,
[2:50:35.340 --> 2:50:39.980]  which then takes over when you've had bad bacteria in there. And then of course, getting all that
[2:50:39.980 --> 2:50:44.380]  meat out with that meat diet, which has a lot of benefits, but a lot of bad things in the upper
[2:50:44.380 --> 2:50:49.340]  and lower intestine. You know, we love meat. I'm all about meat. Truth is, we have really
[2:50:49.340 --> 2:50:55.020]  high meat diets and it's got some bad side effects. And Carnivore literally is incredible. So get
[2:50:55.020 --> 2:51:00.620]  those today at inforwarstore.com or call toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three,
[2:51:00.620 --> 2:51:09.340]  nine and ask for the buy DNA Force 50% off and get a free bottle of Carnivore today. You can read
[2:51:09.340 --> 2:51:17.740]  all the great reviews at infowarslife.com as well. Also 25% off Supermell Vitality and the free bottle
[2:51:17.740 --> 2:51:22.460]  of 30 count Carnivore. I was saying 50% off. They said, Hey boss, we lose money on that.
[2:51:22.460 --> 2:51:27.180]  Please don't have sales where we lose money. Let us make 10, 20% because we're selling a lot of
[2:51:27.180 --> 2:51:31.340]  stuff, but we're not making a lot of money because of this way you do things. You are a screwball.
[2:51:31.980 --> 2:51:36.380]  I don't really think that's true. I want to just ramp up sales so high that even we're making 20,
[2:51:36.380 --> 2:51:41.820]  30% on stuff, we can still pay the bills, but whether it's the toothpaste or whether it's the
[2:51:41.820 --> 2:51:45.900]  colloidal silver, it's all excellent. The fish oil, the krill oil, it's all amazing. A lot of
[2:51:45.900 --> 2:51:50.140]  other specials as well. So be sure and check those out. I thank you all for making the transmission
[2:51:50.140 --> 2:51:55.420]  possible and also think Matt Drudge is usual, but it is important that Ilhan Omar says, well,
[2:51:55.420 --> 2:51:59.500]  the UN runs everything around the world and runs borders. Why don't they run it here? I want the
[2:51:59.500 --> 2:52:04.060]  UN to get rid of our borders and take over and build refugee centers here to bring more in faster.
[2:52:04.060 --> 2:52:08.940]  That's a UN plan. Thank God Drudge thinks that's important and link to it.
[2:52:10.780 --> 2:52:15.180]  It could not be more important because it's the rest of the story. It's not just Ilhan Omar
[2:52:18.380 --> 2:52:24.140]  saying that. Ooh, I want that. Grab that. Trump confronted by Fox host about criticizing the network
[2:52:24.700 --> 2:52:29.100]  except for four or five hosts on there. It's backstabbing. It's polls are fake.
[2:52:29.100 --> 2:52:35.500]  It's run by a bunch of globalists. And so, yeah, Trump better watch out because they're
[2:52:35.500 --> 2:52:40.860]  planning to have him unelected. They're planning to steal that election. CNN has a big article
[2:52:40.860 --> 2:52:46.540]  out about, you know, don't be so sure 2020 that Trump's going to lose because, you know, he might
[2:52:46.540 --> 2:52:53.420]  steal it. They're getting you ready for a contested election. Okay, let's get to the big story.
[2:52:53.420 --> 2:53:01.180]  The story is so important. It's up on infoworse.com, newsworse.com. Starting about a month ago,
[2:53:02.780 --> 2:53:05.980]  I started talking to folks that are dog lovers. They're saying, yeah, have you heard about all
[2:53:05.980 --> 2:53:11.260]  the dogs dying that drink out of the Colorado River? It's damned up at Austin. They call it Lady Bird
[2:53:11.260 --> 2:53:16.220]  Lake. But really, it's just an extension of the Highland Lake chains that are the Colorado River.
[2:53:16.220 --> 2:53:23.340]  And I said, no. So a couple of weeks later, I started seeing articles about this blue-green algae
[2:53:24.300 --> 2:53:29.980]  and the dogs stir up the bank. They drink it and it kills them deader than a hammer.
[2:53:31.020 --> 2:53:38.220]  Well, my wife swam in Lake Travis about a month ago and got an infection in her throat and another
[2:53:38.220 --> 2:53:46.460]  infection. Both my daughters got earaches and sore throat. I like to go and swim. I started swimming
[2:53:46.460 --> 2:53:52.780]  more, but the lake got up to 90 degrees in the afternoon. It's a petri dish. And then a bunch
[2:53:52.780 --> 2:53:58.220]  of my friends got sick and then Drew was swimming in the creek that's real popular, Barton Creek.
[2:53:58.780 --> 2:54:04.460]  It's been raining a lot, but still it's like bathwater. He got sick, like some kind of stuff
[2:54:04.460 --> 2:54:12.860]  eating his skin. Kellen has his ears swole shut from the Colorado River. He was up even higher
[2:54:12.860 --> 2:54:18.380]  where it's actually called the Colorado. And so this is serious. And just like we know 5G and
[2:54:18.380 --> 2:54:24.540]  4G before that is causing cancer, just like we know stuff's going on. This is something that
[2:54:24.540 --> 2:54:31.340]  needs to be discussed because every year in Texas, you don't want to swim when it's 110 degrees
[2:54:31.340 --> 2:54:35.980]  and you see little things swimming on the top of the water, little white specks. Those are amoebas.
[2:54:36.540 --> 2:54:40.940]  And every year there's at least two deaths in Lake Travis where an amoeba gets up into the
[2:54:40.940 --> 2:54:47.660]  sinus, reproduces, eats through the sinus wall and eats your brain. There are dozens of deaths
[2:54:47.660 --> 2:54:53.660]  a year from it. Now this isn't amoebas, but they think it's bacteria that are actually growing on
[2:54:53.660 --> 2:55:01.660]  the blue-green algae. And so again, it's just an example of how we know this is killing the dogs.
[2:55:02.220 --> 2:55:05.580]  But with some pharmaceutical drug, they just cover it up. But if it's blue-green algae,
[2:55:05.580 --> 2:55:09.900]  they'll admit it. Breast cancer is killing millions a year. Every place that puts in life
[2:55:09.900 --> 2:55:13.740]  of states gets massive increases in breast cancer, just like they admit the fluorides,
[2:55:13.740 --> 2:55:18.060]  lowering IQ and giving you bone cancer. But at least with the dogs, people are learning about it
[2:55:18.060 --> 2:55:23.020]  and keeping their dogs out. So here's the deal. Until the end of September, I'm not getting
[2:55:23.020 --> 2:55:28.460]  in any water in Texas. And I wouldn't get it in the South either. This is happening all over
[2:55:28.460 --> 2:55:34.540]  the country. Dog deaths across the U.S., like the toxic blue-green algae in lakes and ponds,
[2:55:35.900 --> 2:55:42.140]  there's an emergency health alert to canines nationwide. But I would also again tell humans,
[2:55:42.140 --> 2:55:48.460]  just do not go in the water. I won't get in the Texas Gulf when it's 100 degrees out because
[2:55:48.460 --> 2:55:52.940]  the few times I've gotten infections, it's been in there. And I'm not a germaphobe either, but
[2:55:52.940 --> 2:55:58.220]  you start getting something, eating your skin off, it's not fun. From Oregon to Maine, from Minnesota
[2:55:58.220 --> 2:56:03.100]  to Texas, beloved pets are dying at the swimming in lakes and ponds. Stories are emerging nationwide
[2:56:03.100 --> 2:56:09.100]  of dogs who took a dip and died moments later, moments later, in some cases. And local governments
[2:56:09.100 --> 2:56:14.700]  are advising against pets, swim in bodies of water, which maybe contaminated with toxic blue-green
[2:56:14.700 --> 2:56:19.340]  algae in Austin, Texas. And this is what the news admits. It's hundreds, folks. Most people I know
[2:56:19.340 --> 2:56:25.900]  it's happened to. Dogs have died at the swimming in Lady Bird Lake, with the deaths attributed to
[2:56:25.900 --> 2:56:32.940]  the algae blooms being found across the U.S. And then it just goes on from there. But here's why
[2:56:32.940 --> 2:56:38.060]  this is so important. It's never been this bad. There's always been amoeba deaths. There's always
[2:56:38.060 --> 2:56:42.460]  been deaths from toxic stuff in the water. But it's much worse, not just in the South,
[2:56:42.460 --> 2:56:46.780]  but in places like Maine and Minnesota. They've never seen things like this. So what's in our
[2:56:46.780 --> 2:56:53.260]  environment that's triggering all this? Well, the GMO, the mutations, the cell towers are mutating
[2:56:53.260 --> 2:56:58.860]  cells. The radiation released from Fukushima, the earth is getting more toxic and it's very serious.
[2:56:59.500 --> 2:57:02.060]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[2:57:05.900 --> 2:57:08.620]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus here on the air. Thanks for holding.
[2:57:08.620 --> 2:57:13.100]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot of people
[2:57:13.100 --> 2:57:17.740]  here out in New York City. And one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these
[2:57:17.740 --> 2:57:22.220]  wars. I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because
[2:57:22.220 --> 2:57:26.220]  they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public,
[2:57:26.220 --> 2:57:30.300]  the approaching 2020. That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his
[2:57:30.300 --> 2:57:33.740]  presidency. It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him. It's
[2:57:33.740 --> 2:57:37.420]  a time to be praying, my friend. I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex,
[2:57:37.420 --> 2:57:41.180]  is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[2:57:41.180 --> 2:57:45.260]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I would love to see what you're talking
[2:57:45.260 --> 2:57:50.380]  about when you're 80. But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a
[2:57:50.380 --> 2:57:55.340]  lot of battles. And there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[2:57:55.340 --> 2:57:59.740]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War. And even if something does happen to you or your show,
[2:57:59.740 --> 2:58:03.740]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[2:58:03.740 --> 2:58:10.940]  Thank you, sir, for calling. I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people,
[2:58:10.940 --> 2:58:14.620]  but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back
[2:58:14.620 --> 2:58:18.620]  five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it,
[2:58:18.620 --> 2:58:22.380]  I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were. And I'd
[2:58:22.380 --> 2:58:26.060]  have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good. And instead, the last few years,
[2:58:26.060 --> 2:58:29.580]  I'm like, Hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down. The biggest thing people
[2:58:29.580 --> 2:58:32.540]  like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[2:58:32.540 --> 2:58:37.980]  And the left always has headlines everywhere. Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims
[2:58:37.980 --> 2:58:43.740]  are supplements. Know under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been
[2:58:43.740 --> 2:58:47.420]  through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it. But then they say you've
[2:58:47.420 --> 2:58:51.660]  got to say it's not approved by them. And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in
[2:58:51.660 --> 2:58:55.580]  Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things. And a lot of drugs work great. They have
[2:58:55.580 --> 2:59:00.380]  side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine
[2:59:00.380 --> 2:59:06.060]  chest. Info or store.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:59:09.500 --> 2:59:12.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:16.140 --> 2:59:17.660]  Be one. Your soul.
[2:59:19.660 --> 2:59:21.340]  Be one. Your soul.
[2:59:22.460 --> 2:59:29.580]  Let it be central. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[2:59:29.580 --> 2:59:34.140]  It's Alex Jones, the fourth hour, always with an amazing guest.
[2:59:34.140 --> 2:59:39.580]  Those are sometimes that comment. He shot this video on August 23rd from Hong Kong.
[2:59:40.220 --> 2:59:45.500]  Now six days later, it's coming true. China's plan for Hong Kong invasion revealed.
[2:59:46.060 --> 2:59:51.020]  He showed you the bridge they did debate on and now it's happened. Gregory Savannah Hernandez,
[2:59:51.580 --> 2:59:57.180]  they are suiting up and they're ready coming in in the next segment. Please share the links to
[2:59:57.180 --> 3:00:02.540]  info wars.com forward slash show and promote all the great shows that we have here for you.
[3:00:02.540 --> 3:00:06.940]  The war room with our employer, David Knight and so much more. Okay.
[3:00:09.340 --> 3:00:13.100]  I meant to get to the chest. I didn't get to it, but I was watching it again last night
[3:00:13.980 --> 3:00:19.100]  and let's start rolling the video for TV viewers. It was this Tampa, Florida event
[3:00:19.740 --> 3:00:22.620]  where you have this teenager who admittedly was on psychotropic drugs.
[3:00:22.620 --> 3:00:29.820]  And I saw it. I said, I bet he's on psychotropic. He was. He just killed his sister and his
[3:00:30.460 --> 3:00:36.380]  niece, his brother. It was a major league baseball prospect, older brother. And then he attacks
[3:00:36.380 --> 3:00:43.180]  the groundskeeper will show people this footage and begins humping him like a demon and making
[3:00:43.180 --> 3:00:50.940]  demon faces and trying to strangle him. Okay. Now he also before was chasing the police around.
[3:00:50.940 --> 3:00:56.940]  Um, uh, now folks in the ancients would call those demon possession and it's getting worse.
[3:00:56.940 --> 3:01:03.580]  It's popping up more places. It's out of control. And when people go on the serotonin reuptake
[3:01:03.580 --> 3:01:09.500]  inhibitors or these so-called antidepressants, the insert says can make you kill yourself or
[3:01:09.500 --> 3:01:15.500]  kill others can make you have delusions of grandeur. And almost every shooter has been on
[3:01:15.500 --> 3:01:19.260]  this. Can we back that up and maybe slow it down and blow it up? When you look at his face,
[3:01:19.260 --> 3:01:23.900]  he is what you call demon possessed or his lower brain is taken over. If you want to be
[3:01:23.900 --> 3:01:30.460]  scientific and say that's it. Uh, but this is why we have guns and I got to tell you
[3:01:31.980 --> 3:01:37.980]  if the economy goes south, this whole country is going to be a time bomb. Crime is exploding
[3:01:39.340 --> 3:01:44.940]  all over the country and it's getting worse and the robberies are getting worse. Everybody I know
[3:01:44.940 --> 3:01:49.900]  is getting robbed or know someone has been robbed in the last couple of months. Muggings are up.
[3:01:50.460 --> 3:01:55.500]  Even in areas that people are armed, I see stacks of news every day where women protect
[3:01:55.500 --> 3:02:00.780]  themselves from rapists and intruders, uh, where, where, where people stop killers. I mean, I don't
[3:02:00.780 --> 3:02:08.140]  even get to those stories. Thank God we've got the second amendment and it's better to be judged
[3:02:08.140 --> 3:02:13.100]  by nine than carried by six. Better to, you know, have them catch you with a gun you're not supposed
[3:02:13.100 --> 3:02:18.540]  to have and have a jury trial than be killed. And Americans need to get guns, need to learn how to
[3:02:18.540 --> 3:02:24.060]  use them and need to get seriously to start watching your butt because there's a lot of dangerous
[3:02:24.060 --> 3:02:30.540]  stuff going on. Also, Apple knows they've been in bed with the chai comms for a long time and, uh,
[3:02:30.540 --> 3:02:36.060]  Google's now having its undersea cable with China completion cut off by the federal government.
[3:02:36.060 --> 3:02:39.500]  They're saying you're not going to hook that up to the United States. We're in a proxy war with
[3:02:39.500 --> 3:02:45.740]  China. And, uh, MarketWatch is reporting Apple CEO Tim Cook sells millions in Apple stock.
[3:02:47.100 --> 3:02:56.700]  Cook sold 265,000 Apple shares for 54.7 million, an average price of $206. He sold stock at requiring
[3:02:59.020 --> 3:03:06.300]  560,000 Apple shares in August through restricted stock units that vested Apple withheld 294,000
[3:03:06.300 --> 3:03:11.900]  shares to satisfy tax withholding requirements for the vet. So he's, he's starting to dump on his
[3:03:11.900 --> 3:03:17.260]  stocks so he can get whatever drug it is he takes to make his people's giant. Uh, this is another
[3:03:17.260 --> 3:03:23.820]  traitorist dirt bag. Also MSNBC's O'Donnell retracts Trump's story after Trump prepares to file
[3:03:23.820 --> 3:03:29.980]  suit on him, claiming that Deutsche Bank said that Trump's funded by Putin. Well, O'Donnell is
[3:03:29.980 --> 3:03:35.980]  again a miscreant liar with no ratings who literally pulled that out of his rear end. He just keeps
[3:03:35.980 --> 3:03:40.300]  hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering with the propaganda. And then we hammer him with the
[3:03:40.300 --> 3:03:45.660]  truth that he says, stop the hammering. Well, guess what, buddy boy? We're not going to stop the
[3:03:45.660 --> 3:03:51.980]  hammering. We're going to come back. I see her in there. Savannah Hernandez, Greg Reese, they're
[3:03:51.980 --> 3:03:57.500]  getting ready and they shot those reports saying the Chinese invasion was imminent on the 23rd.
[3:03:57.500 --> 3:04:05.820]  That's just six days ago. And boy, look at Greg Reese in there looking sharp. He's ready. We're
[3:04:05.820 --> 3:04:15.820]  ready. And they're taking over and then the war room with the one, the only Robert Barnes. What
[3:04:15.820 --> 3:04:19.820]  does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have become big bullies? And the way they did so
[3:04:19.820 --> 3:04:24.060]  is because they face no consequence of social economic, political or legal for their illicit
[3:04:24.060 --> 3:04:28.300]  activities over two decades. And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries,
[3:04:28.300 --> 3:04:32.220]  the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public
[3:04:32.220 --> 3:04:36.540]  and the audience that care about this have to bring real social, political economic consequence
[3:04:36.540 --> 3:04:40.140]  to their course of conduct. Otherwise they will never change. And they will become the big tech
[3:04:40.140 --> 3:04:44.540]  oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran
[3:04:44.540 --> 3:04:48.780]  American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[3:04:48.780 --> 3:04:54.460]  The informer's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make real
[3:04:54.460 --> 3:04:58.700]  the actions of independent free speech to make real the original promise of an independent
[3:04:58.700 --> 3:05:03.260]  free press. Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other
[3:05:03.260 --> 3:05:07.500]  to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts. And then the whopper of telling
[3:05:07.500 --> 3:05:11.420]  us the whole time it's not happening. It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw
[3:05:11.420 --> 3:05:27.340]  isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[3:05:31.260 --> 3:05:35.260]  This is Greg Rees reporting from Mainland China for Infowars.com.
[3:05:35.260 --> 3:05:42.780]  Behind me here is the start of the HKZM bridge. Open less than one year ago, the Hong Kong
[3:05:42.780 --> 3:05:50.300]  Zuhai Macau Bridge is 34 miles long, consisting of three cable-stayed bridges, an undersea tunnel,
[3:05:50.300 --> 3:05:56.300]  and four artificial islands. It is the longest open sea fixed link on earth. The bridge links
[3:05:56.300 --> 3:06:01.980]  the mainland to Hong Kong. This is the bridge the chai comms are going to use to invade Hong Kong.
[3:06:01.980 --> 3:06:07.100]  Reporter Savannah Hernandez is reporting on the upcoming elections that are already fixed,
[3:06:07.100 --> 3:06:12.380]  where only one candidate who stands for Beijing rule over Macau is set to win the election.
[3:06:13.180 --> 3:06:17.500]  First comes Macau, second comes Hong Kong, and this is the bridge.
[3:06:20.700 --> 3:06:27.420]  After World War II, we saw the rise of communism in the Soviet Union and in the People's Republic
[3:06:27.420 --> 3:06:36.380]  of China. In 1949, the Chinese Communist Revolution, led by Party Chairman Mao Zedong,
[3:06:36.380 --> 3:06:40.060]  was responsible for the murder of over 100 million Chinese.
[3:06:42.220 --> 3:06:48.220]  Millions of others fled the mainland into Taiwan and Hong Kong, which as a result,
[3:06:48.220 --> 3:06:53.020]  grew into thriving societies as mainland China plunged into darkness.
[3:06:53.020 --> 3:07:00.460]  In 2019, the 70-year anniversary of the Communist Revolution, and despite its horrors,
[3:07:00.460 --> 3:07:07.420]  communism continues to spread. The People's Republic is a model for globalized governance,
[3:07:07.420 --> 3:07:13.020]  and the Communist Chinese are now looking to absorb those who fled 70 years ago.
[3:07:13.020 --> 3:07:22.780]  A hundred thousand troops of the chai comms paramilitary PAF are now training on the border
[3:07:22.780 --> 3:07:26.460]  of these autonomous cities, preparing for an invasion.
[3:07:29.820 --> 3:07:34.940]  And the people of Hong Kong are united against this tyrannical cancer.
[3:07:34.940 --> 3:07:42.940]  Right behind me is mainland China, separated by this small waterway. With over a hundred
[3:07:42.940 --> 3:07:48.940]  thousand troops already amassed set to invade, only a fraction of the People's Armed Force,
[3:07:48.940 --> 3:07:55.500]  the chai comms are preparing for Tiananmen Square 2.0. Reporting from mainland China,
[3:07:55.500 --> 3:08:05.500]  for Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[3:08:25.500 --> 3:08:37.980]  Welcome back. This is Greg Rees with Savannah Hernandez. We just returned from Hong Kong
[3:08:38.780 --> 3:08:44.460]  about a day ago, really. And our hearts are still there, and we're not at all surprised to hear
[3:08:44.460 --> 3:08:49.740]  about troops crossing in. We didn't really think it would happen this soon, but we knew it was
[3:08:49.740 --> 3:08:55.340]  going to happen in the next month, and it's chilling when I saw the video played on the Alex
[3:08:55.340 --> 3:09:00.780]  Jones Show today of the troops crossing that bridge. That bridge was first proposed in 88,
[3:09:01.420 --> 3:09:06.460]  and a year later when Tiananmen Square happened, they halted the discussions of it.
[3:09:07.740 --> 3:09:13.260]  1997, when the United Kingdom returned Hong Kong to China, they began discussing and planning
[3:09:13.260 --> 3:09:20.060]  the bridge again. They began construction in 2008, which is just a couple years after the first
[3:09:20.060 --> 3:09:27.260]  protest began in Hong Kong. 2005, they had a march for pro-democracy and the abolishment
[3:09:27.260 --> 3:09:33.500]  of appointed district councils. The bridge was completed less than a year ago. The protests
[3:09:33.500 --> 3:09:39.340]  began early this year, and then now we have thousands of troops crossing the bridge,
[3:09:39.340 --> 3:09:45.740]  a 30-minute commute from the mainland into Hong Kong. And the protesters know what they're up
[3:09:45.740 --> 3:09:54.940]  against. This is really the central happening in the global awakening right next door to China.
[3:09:56.860 --> 3:10:02.540]  Now, Greg, we actually went to Macau when we were in Hong Kong for this past week. And again,
[3:10:02.540 --> 3:10:07.260]  I do want to say a quick thank you to all of our supporters that went to infowarstore.com
[3:10:07.260 --> 3:10:10.780]  and help support us and get us over to Hong Kong and allow us to stay over there.
[3:10:10.780 --> 3:10:14.940]  But we went to Macau while we were over there and we did those special reports. We actually
[3:10:14.940 --> 3:10:20.060]  saw that bridge. And you were talking about how, like you just said, that connects mainland China
[3:10:20.060 --> 3:10:25.340]  to Hong Kong, and it's going to be a central point in mainland China invading this city.
[3:10:25.340 --> 3:10:29.660]  These stories just came out today. China sends fresh troops into Hong Kong as military pledges
[3:10:29.660 --> 3:10:33.900]  to protect national sovereignty. Vice came out with this article, Chinese military vehicles
[3:10:33.900 --> 3:10:38.780]  just entered Hong Kong. Beijing says there's nothing to worry about. They talk about how
[3:10:38.780 --> 3:10:45.420]  there's armored vehicles, armored helicopters going into the city. So, of course, this is
[3:10:45.420 --> 3:10:50.540]  something that we've been reporting on for the past week. What do you make of all of this,
[3:10:50.540 --> 3:10:55.180]  Greg? I mean, are you surprised to see China invading now?
[3:10:55.180 --> 3:10:58.060]  No, I'm not surprised. I mean, when we were there, and I don't think any of them are surprised.
[3:10:58.060 --> 3:11:02.540]  Everyone we talked to over there, they kind of knew that they were up against the Chinese
[3:11:02.540 --> 3:11:06.940]  government. They knew the Chinese government was not going to allow them to continue the
[3:11:06.940 --> 3:11:10.380]  protests. And that's really the whole purpose of the protests. They get criticized a lot
[3:11:11.100 --> 3:11:15.420]  for being violent, but they know exactly what they're doing. They're very smart. And what
[3:11:15.420 --> 3:11:23.340]  they're doing is they're forcing China's hand. They know that their only hope is a conflict,
[3:11:23.340 --> 3:11:30.140]  which will hopefully create some type of global outrage and people will come to their defense.
[3:11:30.140 --> 3:11:34.140]  And you have to admire them for that. They're not taking a knee. Those that are
[3:11:35.740 --> 3:11:41.100]  rising up in defiance of the police are the heroes of the Hong Kong people. It's their only hope.
[3:11:41.100 --> 3:11:45.500]  Right. And you and I actually saw a video. I don't know if we put it in the show folder for today,
[3:11:45.500 --> 3:11:50.220]  but there was a clip that we saw, and it was protesters walking in a line in a mall in Hong
[3:11:50.220 --> 3:11:54.300]  Kong. And all of the citizens around them begin clapping for them. And you and I were talking
[3:11:54.300 --> 3:11:59.660]  about just how beautiful that video was, how chilling it was. You were talking to me about how
[3:11:59.660 --> 3:12:06.540]  there's a small percent of the population willing to stand up. And these are the people in Hong
[3:12:06.540 --> 3:12:11.180]  Kong willing to stand up right now, willing to die for this cause. We were actually just watching
[3:12:11.180 --> 3:12:15.580]  a vice news piece as well. And many protesters have come forward and said, we're willing to die
[3:12:15.580 --> 3:12:21.100]  for this cause. I was actually watching a video this morning, too. And this is clip four on this
[3:12:21.100 --> 3:12:27.340]  list. If you guys want to just roll that SB roll, protesters are getting tattoos now. A local tattoo
[3:12:27.340 --> 3:12:33.260]  artist in Hong Kong, I believe he's 28 years old. He's giving protesters free tattoos. And it is
[3:12:33.260 --> 3:12:37.820]  both the emblem of the Hong Kong flag and the umbrella. And they're basically saying, we're
[3:12:37.820 --> 3:12:42.220]  getting these tattoos because when you get a tattoo, it really showed you like you can't go
[3:12:42.220 --> 3:12:47.980]  back on it, you know, and it's there forever. Just like we are going to be with this protest,
[3:12:47.980 --> 3:12:51.580]  we're going to stay with it. We're going to stick with the protest until the five demands that we
[3:12:51.580 --> 3:12:55.820]  requested are met. So I think that's a beautiful thing. And we really have seen the resilience
[3:12:55.820 --> 3:13:00.940]  of the citizens of the protesters when we were over there. This is the spirit. This is the only
[3:13:00.940 --> 3:13:05.340]  thing that's going to save us from tyranny is this type of fighting spirit. And you know,
[3:13:05.340 --> 3:13:10.300]  the rest of the world, a lot of the Western world, we've been like frogs slowly boiling in water
[3:13:10.300 --> 3:13:15.180]  to the point where we're willing to accept whatever they hand us. But what I learned when I was in
[3:13:15.180 --> 3:13:22.540]  Hong Kong is they don't seem to have that handicap that we do. They seem to be well aware of what
[3:13:22.540 --> 3:13:28.460]  they're up against. They're well aware of their limited freedom. I asked many people, do you want
[3:13:28.460 --> 3:13:33.740]  independence? Do you want some sort of a constitution second amendment? And they're pretty much
[3:13:33.740 --> 3:13:37.580]  everyone's answer was no, they were very realistic. They just wanted justice. They said they wanted
[3:13:37.580 --> 3:13:42.460]  something in between. Mainly they just want to remain Hong Kong. They want to remain the way
[3:13:42.460 --> 3:13:49.180]  that they've been always been. And they don't want communist China there. Right. And we talked about
[3:13:49.180 --> 3:13:54.380]  to how Hong Kong was set to have their autonomy. They had a deal in 1997 when they were handed back
[3:13:54.380 --> 3:13:59.100]  over to mainland China. However, they were set to have autonomy for 50 years. And of course,
[3:13:59.100 --> 3:14:04.140]  a lot of people are feeling that this extradition bill that was introduced was mainland China beginning
[3:14:04.140 --> 3:14:09.580]  to impede upon their autonomy ahead of that 2047 deadline date. And as we're seeing to, you know,
[3:14:09.580 --> 3:14:13.820]  the military starting to move in, we've been reporting on this bridge. We're really seeing
[3:14:13.820 --> 3:14:19.660]  them starting to impose on this city come in and like Alex has been talking about China's get set
[3:14:19.660 --> 3:14:24.060]  to take over basically. And we were looking in Macau as well. We reported on their elections.
[3:14:24.060 --> 3:14:31.420]  And we're seeing that in Macau, they're basically their chief executive is elected by Beijing.
[3:14:31.420 --> 3:14:37.020]  And it's similar to Hong Kong here. Carrie Lam is their chief executive. She's pro Beijing.
[3:14:37.020 --> 3:14:41.580]  And Beijing is the one that allows who really gets elected, who's allowed to run these cities.
[3:14:41.580 --> 3:14:45.500]  So this is something that's been going on for a long time. And I think these protests are just
[3:14:45.500 --> 3:14:49.660]  the rest of the world finally waking up to the fact that China is really taking over
[3:14:49.660 --> 3:14:53.580]  and trying to take their autonomy. Well, that's right. And in the 2005 protests,
[3:14:53.580 --> 3:14:56.620]  one of their big things was they wanted the abolishment of appointed district councils,
[3:14:56.620 --> 3:14:59.900]  because they knew that Beijing was entering their government that way. They knew that they were
[3:14:59.900 --> 3:15:04.700]  getting pro China officials back then. So this has been going on for a long time. And it's all
[3:15:04.700 --> 3:15:12.540]  playing out right now. We'll be back after this break. This is a major exciting moment
[3:15:12.540 --> 3:15:16.620]  in the global global awakening. Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain,

[3:18:14.780 --> 3:18:33.780]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words. And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods. Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[3:18:33.780 --> 3:18:49.780]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from theFowarsLife.com, I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality,
[3:18:49.780 --> 3:19:04.780]  and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12. Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere. It is amazing. Experience pure medical B12 for yourself.

[3:19:17.780 --> 3:19:23.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:19:23.780 --> 3:19:52.780]  We are back with Greg Reese and Savannah Hernandez fresh off the plane from Hong Kong. Here today, we're now thousands of the people's libelies.
[3:19:52.780 --> 3:20:06.780]  The People's Liberation Army of China are now entering Hong Kong via the HKZM Bridge and Chinese naval vessels about a month ahead of the October 1st, 70th anniversary of Communist China.
[3:20:06.780 --> 3:20:15.780]  Now, we were down there talking to a lot of the protesters. We got tear gassed. We witnessed people get hit with rubber bullets.
[3:20:15.780 --> 3:20:28.780]  And the spirit that we saw there in that fight was extremely moving, especially being Americans. We have our own problems, and we are so divided in this country.
[3:20:28.780 --> 3:20:36.780]  It was such an unexpected treat to witness a united people like Hong Kong.
[3:20:36.780 --> 3:20:47.780]  Definitely, Greg. And I was actually talking to Owen too yesterday about how surprising it was to see all of the citizens who weren't protesting but were supporting all of the people who were out there standing up for Hong Kong.
[3:20:47.780 --> 3:20:55.780]  People were handing out water. They were handing out snacks. They were giving other protesters rides home after all of the events for the day.
[3:20:55.780 --> 3:21:09.780]  So there's such a sense of everyone being united in that city. And it was a beautiful thing to see something that I don't think we've commonly seen here in America, and that was very foreign to us just because there's so much internal conflict here.
[3:21:09.780 --> 3:21:21.780]  Yes. There was one moment on the Sunday protests where I saw a bunch of elderly people holding hands and they were blocking in an entranceway that behind them was a bunch of young protesters.
[3:21:21.780 --> 3:21:29.780]  And I didn't really know what I was seeing at first. And then there was the police were yelling at the protesters behind the people and the people were calling other people to hold hands.
[3:21:29.780 --> 3:21:37.780]  And then later that day I spoke to a Hong Konger and they mentioned to me what they say translates into English as the gray haired squad.
[3:21:37.780 --> 3:21:46.780]  And she said that it's a lot of the elderly in Hong Kongers that show up to these marches wearing yellow vests and they hold hands and they try to protect the young protesters.
[3:21:46.780 --> 3:21:53.780]  So it is the entire city of Hong Kong standing in solidarity.
[3:21:53.780 --> 3:22:00.780]  Right. And I think we saw people of all ages as well at those protests during the peaceful marches. We saw a lot of young children.
[3:22:00.780 --> 3:22:06.780]  And then again at the end of the day when those protests started getting more violent, we saw the gray haired squad come forward.
[3:22:06.780 --> 3:22:19.780]  We saw people of all ages. There was even a 16-year-old protestor who I interviewed at one point who had gotten attacked, not attacked, but he got hit by a tear gas canister and it cut his leg open.
[3:22:19.780 --> 3:22:25.780]  So again there's people from all different ages at these marches, at these protests all standing up for Hong Kong.
[3:22:25.780 --> 3:22:33.780]  And we were actually at a protest on Saturday and that was at Kuintong and that was the anti-surveillance protest.
[3:22:33.780 --> 3:22:42.780]  And we'll show you guys a little bit of b-roll from that. And it was really interesting to note that we did see those lasers being used when we were there.
[3:22:42.780 --> 3:22:53.780]  And this video actually came out that day too of Citizens Downing and Surveillance Post in the city. This was actually at the protest that we were at on Saturday.
[3:22:53.780 --> 3:23:04.780]  Yeah, I think I read recently that the average IQ for a Hong Konger is about 108. And that's what we were seeing, a very clever, well thought out movement.
[3:23:04.780 --> 3:23:11.780]  They understand that they're not going to beat the police with umbrellas. They understand that.
[3:23:11.780 --> 3:23:18.780]  But what they also understand is that the only hope they have is to push them and to force and to resist them.
[3:23:18.780 --> 3:23:25.780]  I would imagine that the Hong Kong police aren't necessarily happy about what they're doing, but they're being forced by the Communist Chinese.
[3:23:25.780 --> 3:23:33.780]  They seem to be working with the triad gangs. There's actual video footage of showing the police allowing triad gangs with weapons and communist flags
[3:23:33.780 --> 3:23:37.780]  enter into the group of protesters for violence doing nothing.
[3:23:37.780 --> 3:23:44.780]  And so they know that if they can't stop it, the Chinese government's going to come in. Chinese government's on their way right now.
[3:23:44.780 --> 3:23:55.780]  And so the protesters' main tactic, it seemed, was to resist the police and force the Chinese to come in, which is a very brave and noble tactic, I would say.
[3:23:55.780 --> 3:24:04.780]  And going back to that footage of the surveillance post being taken down, I thought that was extremely interesting because we've been reporting on the Chinese social credit score for a long time.
[3:24:04.780 --> 3:24:11.780]  We've also been reporting on the AI facial recognition software that they have in China. We know that's a really big thing there.
[3:24:11.780 --> 3:24:18.780]  I believe over 20 million people could not buy plane tickets in China because of that social credit score.
[3:24:18.780 --> 3:24:30.780]  So I think that this was an interesting example of how the people of Hong Kong are resisting that by taking down that surveillance post, by using those lasers which toward the AI software.
[3:24:30.780 --> 3:24:37.780]  So that was a really interesting thing that we saw in response to mainland China starting to come into Hong Kong.
[3:24:37.780 --> 3:24:47.780]  Yeah, and it's a shame to see that our western mainstream media and social media are now starting to paint these protesters as alt-right Nazis.
[3:24:47.780 --> 3:24:59.780]  I mean, it's not necessarily surprising, but in any other reality, these people would be celebrated worldwide for their bravery and for their spirit.
[3:24:59.780 --> 3:25:07.780]  And I know that they are amongst many people, but the other interesting thing there is while I was off, I was watching a lot of the mainstream news in Hong Kong.
[3:25:07.780 --> 3:25:12.780]  And even their mainstream media seems to be united with Hong Kong.
[3:25:12.780 --> 3:25:20.780]  It's really only the police working with the triad gangs, both working for the Communist Chinese to try to shut this thing down.
[3:25:20.780 --> 3:25:31.780]  And now what I'm wondering right now is we see, you know, what was it a couple hours ago? I saw that video of the troops moving across the bridge, gave me chills.
[3:25:31.780 --> 3:25:39.780]  I knew we were going to see it. I didn't expect to see it so soon, but I just can't help but think about what this weekend's going to be like there.
[3:25:39.780 --> 3:25:46.780]  Definitely. And again, this was the 12th week of protest in Hong Kong, and this was one of the most violent weekends.
[3:25:46.780 --> 3:25:55.780]  Water cannons were deployed. Of course, as we talked about tear gas, rubber bullets were used, beanbag grenades, which you and I didn't see.
[3:25:55.780 --> 3:26:02.780]  We read reports about that. We experienced all that with the people there. And again, we stood in solidarity with the protesters.
[3:26:02.780 --> 3:26:10.780]  We marched with them. We were on the ground, and we talked with them and asked them, what do these marches mean to you? What do these protests mean to you?
[3:26:10.780 --> 3:26:20.780]  And I did do a man on the street while we were over there as well, and I talked to a couple of the protesters and I asked them, are there fears of people, of the protesters specifically being kidnapped by Beijing,
[3:26:20.780 --> 3:26:31.780]  being extradited to mainland China for protesting? And of course, a lot of them came forward and they admitted to us that, yes, this is a very real fear that many of them have.
[3:26:31.780 --> 3:26:40.780]  And we got close enough up where I could see several of the faces of the Hong Kong police, and there was a lot of conflict, which is understandable.
[3:26:40.780 --> 3:26:50.780]  I mean, these are their own people. And we always wonder, like, could our own military turn against us? And I'm sure there would be a conflict there.
[3:26:50.780 --> 3:26:57.780]  But now we're talking about the Chinese military coming in, and a lot of people think that the Hong Kongers and the Chinese are the same, but they're not.
[3:26:57.780 --> 3:27:02.780]  The Hong Kongers, we talked to, one of their biggest issues is that their culture is being changed by this mass immigration.
[3:27:02.780 --> 3:27:10.780]  Paul Joseph Watson was just talking about that. They're having the same sinister immigration policies that Europe has had.
[3:27:10.780 --> 3:27:21.780]  They're getting thousands of Chinese coming into Hong Kong, being able to take their jobs and being able to get benefits of the system and vote.
[3:27:21.780 --> 3:27:30.780]  And so they are under threat now more than ever. And I think this is happening worldwide. We see this everywhere. We see this in our own country.
[3:27:30.780 --> 3:27:38.780]  We see this through Europe. But to me, this is the pinnacle of everything because it is the Chinese, the Communist Chinese is the model for the new global government.
[3:27:38.780 --> 3:27:48.780]  It's the perfect model for the elites. The Hong Kongers probably know it better than anyone, and Hong Kong seems to be ground zero for everything that's happening in the world.
[3:27:48.780 --> 3:27:53.780]  Our prayers are with them. And thank you so much for supporting us.

[3:30:46.780 --> 3:30:54.780]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[3:30:54.780 --> 3:30:56.780]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[3:30:56.780 --> 3:31:00.780]  The human spirit lives at infowars.com and newswars.com.

[3:32:14.780 --> 3:32:19.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:32:45.780 --> 3:32:51.780]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[3:32:58.780 --> 3:33:05.780]  Welcome back. You are with Greg Reese and Savannah Hernandez talking about the latest developments in Hong Kong.
[3:33:05.780 --> 3:33:09.780]  We're about to talk about getting tear gas in Hong Kong last week.
[3:33:09.780 --> 3:33:15.780]  And so before we do, we can talk about something that would have been very beneficial for a lot of people there right now.
[3:33:15.780 --> 3:33:19.780]  One of infowarsstore.com's great products.
[3:33:19.780 --> 3:33:28.780]  Yeah, Greg. So I actually want to talk about one of our newest products, which I'm actually very excited about because I'm always all about skin health and preventing wrinkles.
[3:33:28.780 --> 3:33:36.780]  So we have our new super silver skin cream at infowarsstore.com and that is at 25% off the introductory price.
[3:33:36.780 --> 3:33:41.780]  So it is currently on sale for $14.95 and it comes in two cents.
[3:33:41.780 --> 3:33:47.780]  You can get it in an unscented version for those with sensitive skin or a grapefruit version.
[3:33:47.780 --> 3:33:52.780]  Now, this is the ultimate skin solution. It helps reduce wrinkles and it keeps your skin healthy.
[3:33:52.780 --> 3:33:56.780]  It kills dangerous viruses and bacteria that make you sick.
[3:33:56.780 --> 3:34:05.780]  Not only that, but it's infused with our patented silver soul technology that's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.
[3:34:05.780 --> 3:34:20.780]  Now, of course, unfortunately, over time, the hyaluronic acid contents of our skin slowly decreases as we age and that's why the super silver skin cream also contains hyaluronic acid, a key compound that keeps our skin healthy, retain moisture, and protect from free radicals.
[3:34:20.780 --> 3:34:29.780]  And of course, unlike most skin creams, super silver skin cream is free of BPAs, paraben, harsh preservatives, and sulfates.
[3:34:29.780 --> 3:34:37.780]  Of course, we know that we're all about health here at InfoWars, so great and super exciting that this product is so great for our skin and so healthy for us.
[3:34:37.780 --> 3:34:50.780]  Independent studies have proven that silver soul technology in super silver skin cream at just 20 ppm silver is up to 10 times more effective than similar products containing up to 3,000 ppm silver.
[3:34:50.780 --> 3:35:01.780]  So, of course, this stuff is the real deal, so get your super silver skin cream exclusively at Infowarsstore.com. Again, 25% off the introductory price.
[3:35:01.780 --> 3:35:14.780]  If you can get that on sale right now for $14.95, I know that I'm going to start using this product immediately, Greg, because again, I'm always about fighting wrinkles, protecting my skin, especially after a week in Hong Kong, like you talked about.
[3:35:14.780 --> 3:35:28.780]  We got tear gas, we were marching out in the sun for hours, and then we were marching out in the rain for hours. We were exposed to all of the harsh elements, so I'm really excited to use this product on my skin and have that protection that I so desperately need on my face.
[3:35:28.780 --> 3:35:36.780]  Yeah, and if you want to support the Hong Kong protesters, then you can buy a case of this and send it off to Hong Kong where they'll surely appreciate it.
[3:35:36.780 --> 3:35:48.780]  I was just reading an article today how a lot of them are suffering skin problems, because if you watch these videos, they are prepared for the tear gas with gas masks, but their skin is exposed, and they're bathing in it basically.
[3:35:48.780 --> 3:36:01.780]  I mean, they were just popping off hundreds of canisters, and they're not afraid. They're running right up to the canisters and pitching them up with badminton rackets, grabbing them with their hands, throwing them back at the police, and so they are suffering a lot of skin issues there.
[3:36:01.780 --> 3:36:11.780]  Not only that, but I was actually reading another article that stated that the tear gas is heavier than the air, so it sinks down. So even when you don't feel the effects of the tear gas there, it's still there.
[3:36:11.780 --> 3:36:20.780]  And a lot of young children are walking throughout the cities because of course these protests are taking place all over, and they're being affected by this. They'll break out and rashes.
[3:36:20.780 --> 3:36:33.780]  So even young children, of course, unfortunately are being affected by this, so hopefully we'll see if this product can work, this product can hopefully help with those issues.
[3:36:33.780 --> 3:36:43.780]  Now a lot of our audience might not realize what a warrior Savannah Hernandez is, but I got to see it firsthand last week.
[3:36:43.780 --> 3:36:55.780]  I have the good fortune of being in the United States Marine Corps, URA, and we were subjected to CS gas on a regular basis. They used to lock us in a room, fill the room with CS gas.
[3:36:55.780 --> 3:37:02.780]  We had to take our masks off until we started vomiting, and then they would open the doors to fresh air. We would do that quite a few times to get us used to it.
[3:37:02.780 --> 3:37:07.780]  So I've been there before. It's not pleasant. That was your first time getting tear gas. What do you think about that?
[3:37:07.780 --> 3:37:15.780]  It definitely hurt a lot. Well, I told Rob do before we left that I was fully ready when we went to Hong Kong for anything that was going to happen.
[3:37:15.780 --> 3:37:27.780]  I just wanted to get the shot and I wanted to get our reports out. So being tear gas was not fun at all, but I'm glad that we were able to go and again experience what everyone in Hong Kong is experiencing there.
[3:37:27.780 --> 3:37:35.780]  So it was really, you know, on the ground coverage in depth and once in a lifetime experience for sure.
[3:37:35.780 --> 3:37:42.780]  Yeah. And one of our journalist friends that we were with got a big scar, I believe, right on their arm from a rubber bullet just grazed her.
[3:37:42.780 --> 3:37:49.780]  But it opened up her skin a pretty ugly gash. It was, it was a war zone there, at least as close as you could get to it.
[3:37:49.780 --> 3:37:56.780]  And it's going to get a lot worse now that the Chinese army is rolling in troops.
[3:37:56.780 --> 3:38:03.780]  It's hard to imagine how it's going to turn out. I mean, we're familiar with Tiananmen Square. We're familiar with Tibet.
[3:38:03.780 --> 3:38:13.780]  And you have to realize that Tibet and Tiananmen Square, these events were questioned and protested throughout the world, but not really that much.
[3:38:13.780 --> 3:38:17.780]  And not so much that the Chinese government has ever changed.
[3:38:17.780 --> 3:38:24.780]  So to think that we're not going to get another Tibet, that we're not going to get another Tiananmen Square is a childish notion.
[3:38:24.780 --> 3:38:26.780]  It's really hiding your head in the sand.
[3:38:26.780 --> 3:38:34.780]  We are on the verge of seeing perhaps one of the biggest slaughters in some people's lifetimes right now.
[3:38:34.780 --> 3:38:42.780]  It's chilling when I look at these video footage that they're playing right now of the Chinese army rolling into Hong Kong.
[3:38:42.780 --> 3:38:50.780]  And we actually have a military expert joining us now. Matt Bracken, what do you make of the Chinese military coming into Hong Kong?
[3:38:50.780 --> 3:38:54.780]  Give us some insight into what's going on here.
[3:38:54.780 --> 3:39:10.780]  First, I've been watching for the last few days and I salute you, Greg and Savannah and Paul Joseph Watson and the others behind the cameras that made it all possible.
[3:39:10.780 --> 3:39:15.780]  This is very emotional and I'm a boomer. There's no doubt about it.
[3:39:15.780 --> 3:39:20.780]  And I was born in 57, which was a year after the Hungarian Revolution.
[3:39:20.780 --> 3:39:25.780]  During the 50s, America was very patriotic and very anti-communist.
[3:39:25.780 --> 3:39:36.780]  And when the Hungarians, another very high IQ organized society, they kind of took their cues from the USA and Voice of America.
[3:39:36.780 --> 3:39:42.780]  And they had a revolution against the Russian Soviet communists that had occupied their country.
[3:39:42.780 --> 3:39:46.780]  And it was crushed. It was absolutely crushed.
[3:39:46.780 --> 3:39:51.780]  They were very smart, very brave. They had organized rat lines to get people out of Hungary.
[3:39:51.780 --> 3:40:03.780]  They had their own pirate broadcasting and pirate newspapers during the short period in 56 of the Hungarian Revolution.
[3:40:03.780 --> 3:40:15.780]  They even attacked tanks with Molotov cocktails, which is like a self-sacrifice, to run up to a tank in a tight city street like Hong Kong with just a Molotov cocktail.
[3:40:15.780 --> 3:40:20.780]  They put things like dinner plates on roads and covered them with dust.
[3:40:20.780 --> 3:40:25.780]  So it looked like maybe a landmine had been planted because they had no weapons like Hong Kong.
[3:40:25.780 --> 3:40:32.780]  And a takeaway from the Hungarian Revolution was that people can be very gung-ho for freedom.
[3:40:32.780 --> 3:40:40.780]  But maybe then in the final analysis, the Americans say, you know, there's nothing we can do that we're not going to start World War III for Hungary.
[3:40:40.780 --> 3:40:51.780]  Now, Hong Kong in 2019, this is 30 years after Tiananmen Square from the – going back to Hungary.
[3:40:51.780 --> 3:40:57.780]  Hungary was in 1956. The Soviets just crushed that revolution, crushed it.
[3:40:57.780 --> 3:41:00.780]  Hung people, shot people, disappeared people.
[3:41:00.780 --> 3:41:10.780]  But by 1991, the Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union now in an era of cameras and television network cameras even,
[3:41:10.780 --> 3:41:19.780]  they knew they couldn't just do another Hungarian Revolution crush, like on East Berlin or Hungary or Czechoslovakia.
[3:41:19.780 --> 3:41:24.780]  And now it's 30 years since Tiananmen Square.
[3:41:24.780 --> 3:41:30.780]  Will the Chinese communists feel that they're ready to just crush Hong Kong?
[3:41:30.780 --> 3:41:33.780]  Because Hong Kong could turn into Warsaw ghetto.
[3:41:33.780 --> 3:41:41.780]  It could turn into a grasny that the Russians had to attack twice and almost level that city to take it.
[3:41:41.780 --> 3:41:48.780]  You know, it was spoken of earlier that the Chinese have very much importance on face.
[3:41:48.780 --> 3:41:52.780]  And it's coming up on the anniversary of the 1949 Revolution.
[3:41:52.780 --> 3:41:56.780]  And what will it mean if Hong Kong is still having a, you know, an uprising?
[3:41:56.780 --> 3:42:00.780]  Well, it'll be a lot worse if it's Tiananmen Square times a thousand.
[3:42:00.780 --> 3:42:04.780]  Ten thousand people died on Tiananmen Square. Nobody knows for sure.
[3:42:04.780 --> 3:42:08.780]  But there was no video coming out of Tiananmen Square.
[3:42:08.780 --> 3:42:11.780]  But I'll tell you what, there'll be video coming out of Hong Kong.
[3:42:11.780 --> 3:42:23.780]  There'll be video.
[3:42:41.780 --> 3:42:44.780]  You can rest easy and simplify your routine.
[3:42:44.780 --> 3:42:49.780]  Containing four original formulas, the PM Rest and Recover Pack will build up your body's defenses
[3:42:49.780 --> 3:42:53.780]  and help you get restful, satisfying sleep every night.
[3:42:53.780 --> 3:42:57.780]  Containing bone support, krill oil, sound sleep, and immune support formulas,
[3:42:57.780 --> 3:43:02.780]  the PM packet was created to support improving your body's bones and immune system
[3:43:02.780 --> 3:43:04.780]  all while you rest from the day's work.
[3:43:04.780 --> 3:43:06.780]  When combined with the AM Wake Up and Work packet,
[3:43:06.780 --> 3:43:11.780]  it makes the eight-pack power stack the new Can't Miss InfoWars Life product.
[3:43:36.780 --> 3:43:48.780]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you. I want high-quality stuff in there. I want a good price.
[3:43:48.780 --> 3:43:52.780]  But I've kind of obituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[3:43:52.780 --> 3:43:54.780]  I'm making $2 on my toothpaste, 50% off.
[3:43:54.780 --> 3:43:58.780]  And so it's the same thing with, like, the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[3:43:58.780 --> 3:44:02.780]  Thank you so much for the plugs. But listen, when people get the Patriot points,
[3:44:02.780 --> 3:44:07.780]  a lot of times it makes things a loss later. Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship,
[3:44:07.780 --> 3:44:10.780]  then we're doing 50% off, and then you do something like that,
[3:44:10.780 --> 3:44:39.780]  we have Patriot points, we lose money, but that's okay. Thanks for the support.
[3:44:40.780 --> 3:44:44.780]  The system is vulnerable. Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[3:44:44.780 --> 3:44:48.780]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[3:44:48.780 --> 3:44:55.780]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[3:44:55.780 --> 3:45:01.780]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.

[3:48:54.780 --> 3:48:59.780]  Matt Bracken, you were just talking and you kind of sobered me up.
[3:48:59.780 --> 3:49:03.780]  I can be somewhat optimistic. I tend to be very optimistic in life.
[3:49:03.780 --> 3:49:07.780]  Coming back from Hong Kong, I still am there in my heart.
[3:49:07.780 --> 3:49:13.780]  The people there are so kind. It was probably one of the nicest societies I've ever visited.
[3:49:13.780 --> 3:49:18.780]  And I really wish I was there still today and it breaks my heart to know what's coming to them.
[3:49:18.780 --> 3:49:26.780]  You were just talking about what's likely coming and it kind of sobered me up a little bit and made me realize these people are really brave.
[3:49:26.780 --> 3:49:28.780]  And everything you were describing is how it's going to be in Hong Kong.
[3:49:28.780 --> 3:49:33.780]  I mean, this is a very thriving capitalist city, a huge economic hub.
[3:49:33.780 --> 3:49:40.780]  It's a beautiful place and to imagine tanks rolling through and the fighting there, it's heartbreaking.
[3:49:40.780 --> 3:49:51.780]  I think that it gives Beijing pause, very serious pause to consider if they go in hard, you know, shooting at windows, for example.
[3:49:51.780 --> 3:49:59.780]  People wave a flag and they're going to, you know, put 20 or 30 millimeter rounds through windows and high rises because that's what it's going to take.
[3:49:59.780 --> 3:50:04.780]  The optics of that are going to be disastrous for Beijing and they know it.
[3:50:04.780 --> 3:50:16.780]  So this so-called troop rotation that they're doing now, it can be the beginning of a full-out invasion or it can be just like another move on the chessboard, like a poker game, you know, showing another card.
[3:50:16.780 --> 3:50:27.780]  But if they go in hard, like they're going to just crush the Hungarian Revolution, I think that the difference is today, not only is there going to be film, there's independent journalism.
[3:50:27.780 --> 3:50:39.780]  And I salute and my hat is off to Alex Jones and Infowars for doing better journalism, for backing better journalism than our mainstream media is doing.
[3:50:39.780 --> 3:50:42.780]  Because the mainstream media is all tied into the narrative.
[3:50:42.780 --> 3:50:49.780]  So they're never, for example, going to talk about Pepe the Frog or the American flag because they're not into that.
[3:50:49.780 --> 3:50:56.780]  They want to show this in their own preconceived narrative and there's really a freedom narrative going on in Hong Kong.
[3:50:56.780 --> 3:51:04.780]  And if they are crushed, which I think is going to be very difficult to do, if they are crushed, this is going to be a global red pill.
[3:51:04.780 --> 3:51:10.780]  This is going to expose everybody who supported the Chinese, including the Antifa communists.
[3:51:10.780 --> 3:51:12.780]  This is going to totally expose them.
[3:51:12.780 --> 3:51:20.780]  You know, I think Bernie Sanders in the last day or two was talking positively about China, about how they lifted so many people out of poverty.
[3:51:20.780 --> 3:51:26.780]  Yeah, only killed 50 to 100 million Chinese, but what the hell, you got to break a few eggs to make an omelet.
[3:51:26.780 --> 3:51:27.780]  That's what Chairman Mao said.
[3:51:27.780 --> 3:51:34.780]  So this will expose the American communists and the international globalists.
[3:51:34.780 --> 3:51:39.780]  If they support China and China goes in, it's going to be like Tiananmen Square times a thousand.
[3:51:39.780 --> 3:51:45.780]  This is a city, you know, and we've seen urban warfare in places like Grozny or Sarajevo.
[3:51:45.780 --> 3:51:47.780]  It's not easy to do.
[3:51:47.780 --> 3:51:50.780]  And something else on the military level, I love you reporting.
[3:51:50.780 --> 3:51:56.780]  I saw that guy using a badminton racket to throw back a grenade that could have been a flashbang grenade.
[3:51:56.780 --> 3:51:59.780]  You can lose your hand, you know, easily.
[3:51:59.780 --> 3:52:01.780]  So these guys are very smart.
[3:52:01.780 --> 3:52:07.780]  So the Chinese must be considering when we come in with the tanks, it's not like they're going to roll over and surrender.
[3:52:07.780 --> 3:52:09.780]  They're going to move to another phase.
[3:52:09.780 --> 3:52:12.780]  They're going to have all kinds of ways of sabotaging us.
[3:52:12.780 --> 3:52:19.780]  You know, the first time that the Russians invaded Grozny, they moved right into the center of the city in armored columns
[3:52:19.780 --> 3:52:22.780]  and thought, hey, we've arrived, we won.
[3:52:22.780 --> 3:52:28.780]  And the next thing, you know, from close range, they're taking all kind of RPG attacks.
[3:52:28.780 --> 3:52:33.780]  Of course, in Hong Kong, they don't have RPGs, but they'll have other weapons, other things that they can use.
[3:52:33.780 --> 3:52:37.780]  Between high rises, tanks are, it's not a panacea.
[3:52:37.780 --> 3:52:38.780]  What are you going to do?
[3:52:38.780 --> 3:52:41.780]  Blow up the building, destroy the foundation.
[3:52:41.780 --> 3:52:45.780]  So, and there's no way they can't get this out on film.
[3:52:45.780 --> 3:52:55.780]  So already in Hong Kong, believe me, before the troops roll in, already the last month, there are Chinese special operations forces all over the ground.
[3:52:55.780 --> 3:52:59.780]  This is including the so-called taxi drivers with the communist flags.
[3:52:59.780 --> 3:53:00.780]  They're Spetsnaz.
[3:53:00.780 --> 3:53:01.780]  They're speck-ups.
[3:53:01.780 --> 3:53:03.780]  The triads, they're speck-ups.
[3:53:03.780 --> 3:53:04.780]  That's cover.
[3:53:04.780 --> 3:53:08.780]  Everybody's wearing a mask, so it's easy to do whatever you want.
[3:53:08.780 --> 3:53:12.780]  It's the Chinese version of the Russian men with green faces.
[3:53:12.780 --> 3:53:14.780]  They're already in Hong Kong.
[3:53:14.780 --> 3:53:16.780]  This is a fourth-generation war.
[3:53:16.780 --> 3:53:18.780]  It's already engaged.
[3:53:18.780 --> 3:53:20.780]  The war is already happening.
[3:53:20.780 --> 3:53:24.780]  And we're just going to see how it escalates phase by phase.
[3:53:24.780 --> 3:53:36.780]  But what will be worse for the Chinese anniversary than what's going on now is Hong Kong in flames with a Grosny, a Stalin grad, you know, a Sarajevo happening.
[3:53:36.780 --> 3:53:38.780]  That's going to be even worse.
[3:53:38.780 --> 3:53:40.780]  And they don't want that, believe me.
[3:53:40.780 --> 3:53:49.780]  No, you know, we did see several different uniformed types of police there, including what definitely clearly looked like special forces of some kind.
[3:53:49.780 --> 3:53:54.780]  We even saw some white Westerners wearing uniforms amongst the troops there.
[3:53:54.780 --> 3:53:57.780]  Not many, but there are some photographs going around on the Internet of that.
[3:53:57.780 --> 3:54:01.780]  And the other thing I noticed, too, is you're talking about the mainstream media coverage.
[3:54:01.780 --> 3:54:15.780]  It's not like the majority of the mainstream media was embedded behind the police looking out at the protesters, which definitely made the protesters appear to be sort of the, you know, problematic rioters, violent protesters.
[3:54:15.780 --> 3:54:19.780]  Whereas we were mostly within the protesters, and it's interesting how the angle makes everything look different.
[3:54:19.780 --> 3:54:26.780]  From our angle, we saw a united city with a police force trying to hold them back.
[3:54:26.780 --> 3:54:35.780]  And this is so key, when everybody can be wearing a mask or taking the mask off, depending on what they want to do, anybody can be anybody.
[3:54:35.780 --> 3:54:44.780]  So it's a perfect environment for all kind of false flag operations, you know, where people would throw a Molotov cocktail at the police, but it's a policeman doing it.
[3:54:44.780 --> 3:54:55.780]  Even in Europe, we've seen in Germany, somebody released a German, like Special Forces Police Manual, that gave them the authority to throw rocks at police.
[3:54:55.780 --> 3:55:08.780]  Certain German police units were given authority to commit violence against police so that they could then have a reason to go in with water cannons against the AFD party, for example.
[3:55:08.780 --> 3:55:12.780]  So it's not exactly, this is fourth generation warfare, and we're seeing it.
[3:55:12.780 --> 3:55:19.780]  And a new factor in Hong Kong, with all of the face surveillance and etc., is these people are very brave.
[3:55:19.780 --> 3:55:29.780]  They're putting their necks on the line, literally, because if this goes the wrong way, and China clamps down building by building, which is how this kind of a war is fought.
[3:55:29.780 --> 3:55:33.780]  You know, you secure the sidewalk, then you capture the building floor by floor.
[3:55:33.780 --> 3:55:39.780]  People are going to be hauled away to gulags in China, and they know it, and that's why they're fighting so hard.
[3:55:39.780 --> 3:55:45.780]  They know that a month, a year from now, they can be dragged out of their bed or off of the street.
[3:55:45.780 --> 3:55:52.780]  And the next thing they know, they're having their kidneys removed and they're being shot with an AK-47, because that's how the Chai Khoms roll.
[3:55:52.780 --> 3:56:00.780]  And that's what we've been talking about a lot too, Matt, because a lot of people here in America are trying to equate the Hong Kong protesters to Antifa.
[3:56:00.780 --> 3:56:06.780]  They're saying, you know, if they weren't so violent against police, the police wouldn't have to retaliate with such force.
[3:56:06.780 --> 3:56:15.780]  But again, they don't understand. People here in America that are saying these things don't understand that this is authoritarian China that is trying to come in and take away these people's rights.
[3:56:15.780 --> 3:56:24.780]  And China, again, as we've talked about, we know that they have that AI facial recognition, the Chinese social credit score.
[3:56:24.780 --> 3:56:31.780]  They're very authoritarian, and these people are genuinely fighting for their rights, and they're fighting for everything that people here in America take for granted.
[3:56:31.780 --> 3:56:36.780]  You know, they're flying the American flag in Hong Kong, meanwhile people in America are burning it.
[3:56:36.780 --> 3:56:48.780]  They're fighting for their lives, because if they fail, if the Chai Khoms roll in hard, they will one at a time be dragged away to a Chinese gulag and to never be seen again.
[3:56:48.780 --> 3:56:52.780]  So they're fighting for their lives. I salute them, and thank you InfoWars for sending you guys.
