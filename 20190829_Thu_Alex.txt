[00:00:02.552 --> 00:00:04.654]  I've known Alex for, like, more than 20 years.
[00:00:04.654 --> 00:00:05.475]  I've hung out with that guy.
[00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:07.237]  We've been hammered together so many times.
[00:00:07.237 --> 00:00:09.119]  That is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.241]  He was right about all this Jeffrey Epstein s***.
[00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:12.963]  That is a f***ing fact.
[00:00:12.963 --> 00:00:15.586]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:00:15.586 --> 00:00:18.449]  For years, Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories.
[00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.890]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist.
[00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.012]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist.
[00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:28.153]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:33.375]  Alex Jones supported President Trump, but also peddled and promoted sick conspiracy theories.
[00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:38.518]  It's really hard for me to understand how anyone can be so sick in the head.
[00:00:38.518 --> 00:00:41.539]  Alex Jones, my God, Mika, and just... Yeah.
[00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.660]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.001]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.023]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.023 --> 00:00:51.905]  Alex Jones has been behind several right-wing conspiracy theories.
[00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:54.127]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:54.127 --> 00:00:57.369]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:01.232]  The captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership.
[00:01:02.072 --> 00:01:09.019]  Alex Jones espouses a litany of conspiracy theories, although he thinks that term belittles his reporting.
[00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:10.641]  The government's poisoning the water?
[00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:11.261]  Absolutely.
[00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:20.170]  I have all these other government documents where the government proposes and government think tanks propose it's poisoning the water to dumb down the population, make them more easily manageable.
[00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.231]  Oh dear, the fluoride didn't work on this one.
[00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:25.472]  He's fighting back against my takeover.
[00:01:25.472 --> 00:01:27.593]  Hurry, chemtrail him immediately!
[00:01:27.593 --> 00:01:30.814]  I've noticed what they attack me with on mainstream news.
[00:01:30.814 --> 00:01:33.735]  Jones claims your cell phones are killing you.
[00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:38.637]  Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that are lowering your fertility and confusing your sexuality.
[00:01:38.637 --> 00:01:40.778]  Jones says there's black helicopters.
[00:01:40.778 --> 00:01:42.498]  Jones says there's a world government.
[00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:44.659]  Jones says the EU is unelected.
[00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:44.979]  It is.
[00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.420]  On and on and on.
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.001]  And everything we're saying is out in the open.
[00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:56.266]  Kelly Prime's son, Kyle, was just 10 years old when he was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2016.
[00:01:56.266 --> 00:02:01.729]  Five months later, Kyle's friend and classmate, Mason Faruli, developed brain cancer.
[00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.451]  Two more kids at the school were diagnosed this year.
[00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:16.979]  The moms believe the recent increase in cancer cases could be caused by radiation from radiofrequency, or RF waves, coming from this cell tower located on the elementary school campus.
[00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:33.049]  So think about how the LA Times and even Wired Magazine will admit there are thousands of studies that prove that wireless radiation, as it's intensified in its strength the last 30 years, and how many places it's emanating from, and especially the microwave millimeter waves.
[00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:33.569]  Cell phones!
[00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:37.312]  Operate as microwave transmitters and receivers, transceivers.
[00:02:37.312 --> 00:02:38.393]  Now, what's a microwave do?
[00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:40.655]  It vibrates water, vibrates molecules.
[00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:45.580]  And 5G is an even more powerful form of microwave that even rattles it faster.
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.765]  That's what causes the heat, the friction of the molecules, and burns oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:51.986]  You heard me right.
[00:02:51.986 --> 00:02:54.208]  5G burns the atmosphere.
[00:02:54.708 --> 00:03:01.031]  Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008 as part of a controversial deal.
[00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:14.796]  In a civil case against the government about that deal, one accuser says she took part in an orgy on Epstein's private island in 2002 with approximately eight other young girls who appeared to be under the age of 18.
[00:03:14.796 --> 00:03:16.117]  What may have happened here?
[00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:20.060]  Just because some people want to restrict views doesn't mean they have a right to do it.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.626]  And see, once that happens, now you can shut down the details of Bill Clinton's best buddy and the pedophile island that we've been exposing.
[00:03:26.626 --> 00:03:36.095]  Prison guards working when Epstein apparently died by suicide may have falsified reports to make it look like they were checking in on Epstein, when they were in fact not.
[00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:39.158]  I am now more suspicious than ever that this could be a homicide.
[00:03:39.258 --> 00:03:41.119]  People won't listen to me because I got too much data!
[00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:42.640]  Can you imagine what this is like?
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.541]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:46.181]  Years ago.
[00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:53.945]  He was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they have all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with.
[00:03:53.945 --> 00:03:56.166]  He was talking about this years ago.
[00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:57.847]  Now it is mainstream news.
[00:04:06.685 --> 00:04:09.628]  Start your engines, and get ready.
[00:04:09.628 --> 00:04:17.093]  Because this is going to be one hell of a transmission, you're going to love it.
[00:04:17.093 --> 00:04:18.595]  It's Thursday, August 29th, 2019.
[00:04:21.986 --> 00:04:24.007]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:26.048]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[00:04:26.048 --> 00:04:32.550]  And the way they did so is because they faced no consequence, social, economic, political or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:43.375]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence.
[00:04:43.735 --> 00:04:44.175]  We're good to go.
[00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:17.796]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[00:05:17.796 --> 00:05:19.716]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:22.317]  Even it is what you just saw.
[00:05:22.317 --> 00:05:24.457]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:26.798]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:05:51.319 --> 00:06:05.130]  So we should do what any other country does by dealing with this situation in a serious way.
[00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:15.218]  So we have to bring in the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees, an agency that has the expertise and the training
[00:06:16.352 --> 00:06:20.715]  Now, I got sent that clip seven or eight times.
[00:06:34.423 --> 00:06:35.543]  The last 12 hours.
[00:06:35.543 --> 00:06:39.884]  I got sent some late last night, some today by friends, family, you name it.
[00:06:39.884 --> 00:06:45.845]  And Paul Joseph Watson is putting a big article together for Infowars.com that gives you the rest of the backstory.
[00:06:45.845 --> 00:06:47.646]  But you heard what she said.
[00:06:47.646 --> 00:06:54.267]  She said we should do what every other country does.
[00:06:54.267 --> 00:07:00.548]  We should have the United Nations run our borders and run the refugee crisis.
[00:07:00.548 --> 00:07:02.469]  Now, when she says that, she's giving you
[00:07:04.028 --> 00:07:24.442]  The establishment goal of the United Nations, the United Nations Refugee Office, the treaties that most nations are signatories to, puts the UN in control, not just of your borders, but of the policies and of who you accept into your country.
[00:07:24.442 --> 00:07:27.104]  So I'm getting all these calls saying, Alex, it's incredible.
[00:07:27.104 --> 00:07:27.885]  You were right again.
[00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.391]  They say they want the U.N.
[00:07:30.391 --> 00:07:31.372]  to run our borders.
[00:07:31.372 --> 00:07:33.894]  Well, Obama called for the U.N.
[00:07:33.894 --> 00:07:37.677]  to come and oversee the Border Patrol four or five times.
[00:07:37.677 --> 00:07:41.080]  But Congress made a bunch of noises about it, so he backed off.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.442]  Europe's been run by the U.N.
[00:07:42.442 --> 00:07:45.864]  for decades.
[00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:48.186]  Back when the old Soviet Union was operating, a lot of times the U.N.
[00:07:48.186 --> 00:07:52.830]  would come in, take control of an area, and then turn it over to the Soviets.
[00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.411]  It was the U.N.
[00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:56.193]  sabotaged us in the Korean War.
[00:07:57.361 --> 00:08:03.882]  And wouldn't let us win the war and basically ordered Congress to stand down and to remove General MacArthur.
[00:08:03.882 --> 00:08:05.383]  So this is all mainline history.
[00:08:05.383 --> 00:08:09.264]  It's like, Alex, you told us fluoride's causing brain damage and low IQ.
[00:08:09.264 --> 00:08:12.244]  Why American Medical Association says you're right?
[00:08:12.244 --> 00:08:15.625]  Because they said I was right 50 years ago.
[00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:19.046]  I'm going off reports that are already confirmed.
[00:08:19.046 --> 00:08:21.086]  It's just now people don't believe mainstream media.
[00:08:21.086 --> 00:08:21.986]  They don't believe the system.
[00:08:21.986 --> 00:08:24.827]  And so people are looking at the reports and going, oh, wow, you're right.
[00:08:24.827 --> 00:08:25.547]  I was always right.
[00:08:26.314 --> 00:08:38.845]  I'm right about yield signs being yellow, stop signs being red, direction signs being green, water being clear or blue that's reflecting the sky.
[00:08:38.845 --> 00:08:45.951]  I mean, that's what's so frustrating is 90% of what I cover is not cutting edge.
[00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:47.993]  It's just the reality.
[00:08:47.993 --> 00:08:52.017]  And people think that, oh, wow, it keeps coming true.
[00:08:53.112 --> 00:09:00.597]  I'm telling you about global cashless societies and face scanning to buy and sell, or to travel or live, and global social scores.
[00:09:00.597 --> 00:09:05.199]  Market the Beast, because they were planning it decades ago, now it's here.
[00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:11.443]  I was telling you beforehand so we could stop it, not to be a prophet when it all happened.
[00:09:11.443 --> 00:09:14.285]  Because it's all been laid out by social engineers at DARPA.
[00:09:15.782 --> 00:09:17.643]  And they're charting our course.
[00:09:17.643 --> 00:09:23.525]  The eugenicists, the globalists, the transhumanists that control it, they are the ones running the show.
[00:09:23.525 --> 00:09:26.986]  It doesn't mean that most people in those agencies are actually well-meaning.
[00:09:26.986 --> 00:09:29.187]  They're compartmentalized.
[00:09:29.187 --> 00:09:36.169]  The little gerbils on the wheel turning the engine of the deep state breakaway technocracy are good people.
[00:09:36.169 --> 00:09:42.092]  But those piloting it, those siphoning off our resources, they're the bad guys.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.423]  Yohan Omar demands United Nations take over America's border crisis.
[00:09:48.423 --> 00:09:51.844]  We'll play that clip again of her just in a moment.
[00:09:51.844 --> 00:09:53.005]  Again.
[00:09:53.005 --> 00:09:55.526]  So cue it up, please.
[00:09:55.526 --> 00:09:57.508]  She says we need to do what every other nation does.
[00:09:57.508 --> 00:10:04.271]  Yes, every other nation that is a signature to the UN, that's most countries of 170 plus,
[00:10:06.229 --> 00:10:06.649]  I think?
[00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:36.984]  Going back to George Herbert Walker Bush and the whole Agenda 21 initiative that he signed on to that Congress didn't pass in 1992.
[00:10:36.984 --> 00:10:40.685]  So we've been harping on this since it happened.
[00:10:40.685 --> 00:10:44.106]  I was reading about this when I was graduating high school in 1992.
[00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:51.115]  And I was reading about us going under the U.N., then it was being hailed on the news.
[00:10:51.115 --> 00:10:53.478]  Because back then, they thought there wasn't opposition.
[00:10:53.478 --> 00:10:54.599]  They're like, the U.N.
[00:10:54.599 --> 00:10:57.643]  now runs our borders and decides who can come to the U.S.
[00:10:57.643 --> 00:10:58.404]  It's wonderful.
[00:10:58.404 --> 00:10:59.085]  And the U.N.
[00:10:59.085 --> 00:11:02.148]  will decide standardization of toilets, light bulbs.
[00:11:02.148 --> 00:11:04.211]  The atomic family will no longer be here.
[00:11:06.297 --> 00:11:07.618]  And so I was witnessing it.
[00:11:07.618 --> 00:11:09.020]  That's what helped wake me up.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.241]  So this is a big deal.
[00:11:10.241 --> 00:11:11.783]  And I just want to open with this.
[00:11:11.783 --> 00:11:15.547]  And there's a story that could pop up any moment on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:11:15.547 --> 00:11:17.609]  It was going to actually be up by the start of the show.
[00:11:17.609 --> 00:11:20.832]  Can we look at InfoWars.com front page or NewsWars.com?
[00:11:20.832 --> 00:11:22.875]  Can we put that on screen for me?
[00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:24.657]  On my knees, I beg for it!
[00:11:25.177 --> 00:11:27.238]  Because it was supposed to be up by the time we started the show.
[00:11:27.238 --> 00:11:30.721]  Paul Watson is going to be on.
[00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:31.281]  There you go!
[00:11:31.281 --> 00:11:32.062]  It's live!
[00:11:32.062 --> 00:11:33.162]  It's been live!
[00:11:33.162 --> 00:11:37.966]  I need those new stories, the last hour's worth, printed on my knees!
[00:11:37.966 --> 00:11:38.746]  I beg for it.
[00:11:38.746 --> 00:11:40.187]  Now, continuing.
[00:11:40.187 --> 00:11:47.092]  Ilhan Omar demands United Nations take over America's border crisis.
[00:11:47.092 --> 00:11:49.714]  So we see this all over the place.
[00:11:52.062 --> 00:11:53.364]  We see them announcing it's the U.N.
[00:11:53.364 --> 00:11:57.290]  that supposedly runs this, and a lot of us are like, it's incredible, Jones, you're right!
[00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.252]  How did you know this?
[00:11:58.252 --> 00:11:59.153]  How did it come true?
[00:11:59.153 --> 00:11:59.854]  Because it is!
[00:12:02.076 --> 00:12:14.184]  The international world government law that the UN will use giant third world populations that they first stage in regional camps for six months to a year, literal brainwashing facilities.
[00:12:14.184 --> 00:12:25.792]  They then organize them and they then flood the borders of the Western nations where then UN camps are set up to receive them.
[00:12:25.792 --> 00:12:31.536]  Then they are deployed to certain regions and to leftist political parties who then sign them up for welfare.
[00:12:32.516 --> 00:12:47.560]  And jobs, and then keep them as a sub-slave class, and they skim off the top their wages and their welfare, and then give them IDs, driver's license, unionize them, and then weaponize them.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:53.802]  They give them USAID, State Department, and UN-funded $1,000 to $2,000 to 2,000 euro debit cards per leg of the trip with no name on it.
[00:13:00.638 --> 00:13:05.461]  Mainline hotels are ordered to let the refugees in for free.
[00:13:05.461 --> 00:13:09.003]  This is all part of World War 4.
[00:13:09.003 --> 00:13:11.564]  The UN and the globalist waging war.
[00:13:11.564 --> 00:13:15.906]  So these stories have gone live on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:13:15.906 --> 00:13:18.748]  They are our top stories today.
[00:13:18.748 --> 00:13:25.772]  They are so incredibly important if you want to understand the big picture and how this whole thing is going down.
[00:13:25.772 --> 00:13:29.194]  Ilhan Omar demands UN take control of US borders in
[00:13:30.174 --> 00:13:33.436]  Mirror of European migrant crisis.
[00:13:33.436 --> 00:13:38.158]  We have to bring the United Nations High Commissioner on refugees.
[00:13:38.158 --> 00:13:41.060]  And it goes through the entire plan.
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.961]  It's on newswars.com.
[00:13:42.961 --> 00:13:44.822]  It's on infowars.com.
[00:13:44.822 --> 00:13:47.043]  And it is the most critical story ever.
[00:13:47.043 --> 00:13:48.224]  And so when we come back from break.
[00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:56.636]  I am going to walk through the history of this, the plan, and I'm going to walk through how to stop it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:56.636 --> 00:14:10.705]  But this is an absolute, stated, world government-admitted plan to bring down Western nations and to bring in 600 million refugees by 2050 to the U.S.
[00:14:10.705 --> 00:14:15.508]  That is the stated goal, the past resolution by the U.N., 600 million.
[00:14:19.266 --> 00:14:28.214]  That's three times our population who will be totally kept and controlled and dominated by the globalists.
[00:14:28.214 --> 00:14:31.858]  This is the end of our nations, the end of our sovereignty.
[00:14:31.858 --> 00:14:36.402]  This is how fifth, sixth generational warfare operates.
[00:14:36.402 --> 00:14:39.525]  And if we don't get a handle on it, we're going to lose everything.
[00:14:41.701 --> 00:14:48.346]  Paul Joseph Watson, who just spent a week in Hong Kong, just got back today to the UK.
[00:14:48.346 --> 00:15:00.855]  He's going to be giving us stunning inside intel and reports, not just from what happened on the ground, but from groups and organizations that he met with, and so much more in this whole proxy war between the US and China.
[00:15:00.855 --> 00:15:02.677]  And there is a lot more, but bottom line,
[00:15:03.649 --> 00:15:13.621]  That we are now in the middle of a global civil war between nation states and free people and multinational corporations allied with authoritarian regimes like China.
[00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:16.745]  It's lining up along the same battle lines of World War II.
[00:15:16.745 --> 00:15:19.749]  You notice the Queen just suspended Parliament and got behind Brexit.
[00:15:21.127 --> 00:15:32.171]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[00:16:51.227 --> 00:16:55.148]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:55.148 --> 00:16:56.689]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:59.630]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:05.192]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[00:18:21.046 --> 00:18:25.228]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:18:25.228 --> 00:18:26.288]  They are technocrats.
[00:18:26.288 --> 00:18:28.569]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:18:28.569 --> 00:18:35.471]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life, make your own decisions, it's in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:18:35.931 --> 00:18:37.791]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:18:37.791 --> 00:18:40.272]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:18:40.272 --> 00:18:46.754]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:18:46.754 --> 00:18:51.955]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:18:51.955 --> 00:19:00.957]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlemen and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:19:01.937 --> 00:19:07.919]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:08.859]  It is amazing.
[00:19:08.859 --> 00:19:18.081]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:19:18.081 --> 00:19:19.602]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:04.915 --> 00:20:05.595]  We're good to go.
[00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:30.911]  Water in creeks and lakes will tell you why.
[00:20:30.911 --> 00:20:35.275]  And everyone I know, basically, has gotten sick swimming in Lake Travis.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.641]  In Lake Austin or in Barton Creek.
[00:20:38.641 --> 00:20:59.069]  And I'm a big water guy, but a month ago, I told my family, I said, we need to stop going into the lake and getting in the water because of this type of algae that is literally... Almost everyone I know that's gotten in the lake or the water in the last month and a half has gotten seriously sick, including myself and my family.
[00:20:59.069 --> 00:21:02.350]  So we're gonna tell you about this blue-green algae
[00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:08.553]  And why it's so deadly, that's coming up next hour, but that story is on Infowars.com.
[00:21:08.553 --> 00:21:11.014]  And of course, DrugsReport.com.
[00:21:11.014 --> 00:21:14.776]  So, let's get to this right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:14.776 --> 00:21:18.398]  Let's break this down right now.
[00:21:18.398 --> 00:21:24.561]  Ilhan Omar demands United Nations take over America's border crisis.
[00:21:24.561 --> 00:21:28.463]  I was sent this Daily Wire story by a lot of people last night and this morning.
[00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:33.169]  And they were like, wow, you know, look, Ben Shapiro's telling the truth about stuff now.
[00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:34.312]  Wow, you've been proven right again.
[00:21:34.312 --> 00:21:36.698]  I'm like, proven right again?
[00:21:37.947 --> 00:21:56.619]  This is an official UN plan, going back decades, to build refugee centers in the third world, brainwash large groups of people into globalism, socialism and communism, and anti-westernism, and then have them invade and be a permanent political underclass inside the western countries.
[00:21:56.619 --> 00:21:58.481]  So document cam shot please.
[00:21:58.481 --> 00:22:00.842]  Here are a few of the articles.
[00:22:00.842 --> 00:22:01.423]  McCrime.
[00:22:02.123 --> 00:22:06.766]  Europe entering age of unprecedented mass migration shares destiny with Africa.
[00:22:06.766 --> 00:22:11.389]  Says he wants 200 plus million in the next 30 years.
[00:22:11.389 --> 00:22:14.872]  That's a quote brought in to the country.
[00:22:14.872 --> 00:22:16.713]  200 million brought in.
[00:22:16.713 --> 00:22:18.434]  Okay?
[00:22:18.434 --> 00:22:19.135]  Here's another one.
[00:22:19.135 --> 00:22:20.556]  This is from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:22:20.556 --> 00:22:22.917]  Links directly to the United Nations website.
[00:22:22.917 --> 00:22:27.500]  Revealed UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants by 2050.
[00:22:29.878 --> 00:22:32.340]  Tripling the population.
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.701]  And they're building the UN Refugee Centers as we speak.
[00:22:34.701 --> 00:22:36.422]  Now here's the big article that's on newswars.com
[00:22:37.921 --> 00:22:43.982]  And Infowars.com that Paul Joseph Watson has written about that gives you the backstory of all of this.
[00:22:43.982 --> 00:22:45.803]  This is the article you send out.
[00:22:45.803 --> 00:22:47.003]  This is the article you share.
[00:22:47.003 --> 00:22:48.543]  You'll get censored on Twitter.
[00:22:48.543 --> 00:22:50.344]  You'll get censored on Facebook.
[00:22:50.344 --> 00:22:53.624]  But if you send out the Newswars.com, you won't get censored as much.
[00:22:53.624 --> 00:22:55.165]  But whatever you do, hand-share it.
[00:22:55.165 --> 00:22:57.145]  Send it out on your email.
[00:22:57.145 --> 00:23:00.206]  Send it out on your text message while you still can.
[00:23:00.206 --> 00:23:04.787]  Facebook and others are buying up all the text message apps and not letting you do that as well.
[00:23:04.787 --> 00:23:06.227]  They're also not letting you tweet.
[00:23:07.047 --> 00:23:09.650]  You know, stuff about Jesus or strong women.
[00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.854]  It's the sky's the limit of this takeover of communications.
[00:23:13.854 --> 00:23:16.016]  And of course, Congress is still doing nothing.
[00:23:16.016 --> 00:23:24.143]  Ilhan Omar demands UN take control of US border in mirror of European migrant crisis.
[00:23:24.143 --> 00:23:27.707]  We have to bring the United Nations High Commissioner on refugees.
[00:23:30.151 --> 00:23:34.893]  Now, Representative Ilhan Omar is demanding that the United Nations take control of the U.S.
[00:23:34.893 --> 00:23:42.116]  border with Mexico in a mirror of how Europe was inundated with migrants following lobbying from international bodies.
[00:23:42.116 --> 00:23:49.939]  And Paul goes on with the history of how they build the refugee centers in areas that are close to European or U.S.
[00:23:49.939 --> 00:23:55.522]  borders, like Guatemala or places like Egypt.
[00:23:56.954 --> 00:23:57.074]  We're
[00:24:17.012 --> 00:24:35.569]  They jump on trains going from France under the tunnel that goes under the English Channel, and they pour in en masse, and then leftists and globalists are waiting on the other side to further indoctrinate them into the anti-American, anti-European, anti-white brainwashing culture.
[00:24:35.569 --> 00:24:37.290]  Just today, I have two articles.
[00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:43.776]  Uncle of Italian girl murdered by migrants threatens to show photos of her dismembered body if immigration laws are loosened.
[00:24:44.076 --> 00:24:48.000]  And it goes into the Nigerians torturing her and chopping her to death.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.282]  Here's another Ethiopian national.
[00:24:50.282 --> 00:24:51.203]  Stabs to death.
[00:24:51.203 --> 00:24:53.886]  Random white girl walking her dog in D.C.
[00:24:53.886 --> 00:24:55.568]  because she was white.
[00:24:55.568 --> 00:24:57.490]  These hate crimes are just exploding.
[00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:58.551]  But the U.N.
[00:24:58.551 --> 00:25:00.112]  teaches them this.
[00:25:01.113 --> 00:25:02.594]  And it goes on to continue.
[00:25:02.594 --> 00:25:05.975]  Ilhan Omar says white people are the problem.
[00:25:05.975 --> 00:25:07.556]  Should I play the clips of her saying that?
[00:25:07.556 --> 00:25:08.857]  You've heard her say that.
[00:25:08.857 --> 00:25:22.042]  Let's hear her say, like every other country, we need the UN that builds the centers, organizes the people, brainwashes them for six months, and then ships them here, but instead we have a border patrol trying to stop it.
[00:25:22.042 --> 00:25:22.743]  No, no, no, no.
[00:25:22.743 --> 00:25:25.824]  The UN should be running it like every other country.
[00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:29.326]  But see, Trump withdrew us from the treaty.
[00:25:29.326 --> 00:25:29.666]  Here it is.
[00:25:30.523 --> 00:25:40.608]  So we should do what any other country does by dealing with this situation in a serious way.
[00:25:40.608 --> 00:25:56.477]  So we have to bring in the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees, an agency that has the expertise and the training to handle massive flows of refugees humanely.
[00:25:57.904 --> 00:25:59.785]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:59.785 --> 00:26:02.787]  So this isn't something I cooked up in my head.
[00:26:02.787 --> 00:26:05.749]  It's not something that patriots cooked up.
[00:26:05.749 --> 00:26:12.013]  Under Kennedy, who people lionize and say was the greatest guy in the world, he had a lot of problems.
[00:26:12.013 --> 00:26:15.815]  They passed State Department Memorandum 7277.
[00:26:15.815 --> 00:26:24.661]  And Congress created a whole system under what they call a
[00:26:26.548 --> 00:26:40.213]  Uniform Commercial Code, or a public law, that said the UN would finally occupy Russia and the United States as part of a global government peace deal run by the Carnegie Endowment.
[00:26:40.213 --> 00:26:46.395]  Anybody can type into Bing, I wouldn't go to Google, it's workless now, Memorandum 7277, State Department Memorandum 7277, or public law.
[00:26:49.756 --> 00:27:00.142]  And you'll get scanned copies, I've got a few around the office, of the actual UN pamphlet that was given to every college student in the United States after we signed on to it.
[00:27:00.142 --> 00:27:07.106]  And it shows our military going down to zero on graphs, and the UN going straight up.
[00:27:07.106 --> 00:27:08.927]  State Department Memorandum 7277.
[00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:11.008]  State Department Memorandum 7277.
[00:27:17.952 --> 00:27:22.955]  You can instantly pull it up for anybody that wants to see that for yourself.
[00:27:22.955 --> 00:27:27.478]  So this has always been the big public plan.
[00:27:27.478 --> 00:27:29.079]  This has always been the program.
[00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:33.621]  So back then, they just announced it.
[00:27:33.621 --> 00:27:43.768]  They just announced it to Americans like, oh, the UN is going to occupy us, and we're going to take all the guns, and we passed a UN resolution that says all small arms will be handed in.
[00:27:44.784 --> 00:27:51.900]  And the family's gonna have to be ended and single-parent homes have to be ended because it's called freedom from war.
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.006]  And once we all live in dormitories, re-education camps...
[00:27:56.437 --> 00:27:57.578]  Then there'll be no more war.
[00:27:57.578 --> 00:28:01.401]  Once there's no more religion, except a one-world religion, it'll all be okay.
[00:28:01.401 --> 00:28:03.262]  So see, how do I know all this?
[00:28:03.262 --> 00:28:05.704]  It's been the plan all along.
[00:28:05.704 --> 00:28:09.106]  In the old days, the New York Times had front-page articles promoting it.
[00:28:09.106 --> 00:28:13.089]  America rejected it, so they went, okay, it doesn't exist, you're crazy.
[00:28:13.089 --> 00:28:15.151]  But right now, we're being assaulted by a U.N.
[00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:15.571]  takeover.
[00:28:15.571 --> 00:28:19.194]  The world's in the middle of a civil war between nation-states and the globalists.
[00:28:20.419 --> 00:28:24.982]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[00:28:24.982 --> 00:28:27.063]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:28:27.063 --> 00:28:28.804]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:28:28.804 --> 00:28:35.347]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:28:35.347 --> 00:28:40.430]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:45.133]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[00:28:45.213 --> 00:28:45.673]  I'm good.
[00:29:10.981 --> 00:29:11.461]  800-506-6740 That's 800-506-6740
[00:29:22.344 --> 00:29:39.012]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[00:29:39.012 --> 00:29:43.113]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[00:29:43.113 --> 00:29:46.435]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[00:29:46.795 --> 00:29:48.536]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[00:29:48.536 --> 00:29:52.779]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[00:29:52.779 --> 00:30:00.723]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[00:30:00.723 --> 00:30:03.445]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[00:30:03.445 --> 00:30:08.348]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[00:30:08.348 --> 00:30:09.528]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[00:30:09.528 --> 00:30:10.369]  They have side effects.
[00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:15.118]  Not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[00:30:15.118 --> 00:30:17.021]  Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:30:21.451 --> 00:30:34.622]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[00:30:34.622 --> 00:30:37.545]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:39.306]  farming goods a week ago.
[00:30:39.306 --> 00:30:42.950]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:48.131]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[00:30:48.131 --> 00:30:49.171]  That's beautiful.
[00:30:49.171 --> 00:30:51.072]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[00:30:51.072 --> 00:30:52.672]  And we aren't going to back down.
[00:30:52.672 --> 00:31:00.274]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[00:31:00.274 --> 00:31:02.595]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[00:31:02.595 --> 00:31:06.776]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:31:06.776 --> 00:31:07.716]  And I'm asking listeners.
[00:31:08.496 --> 00:31:12.623]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[00:31:12.623 --> 00:31:13.725]  We are the resistance.
[00:31:13.725 --> 00:31:14.366]  We are 1776 Worldwide.
[00:31:23.405 --> 00:31:28.026]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[00:32:23.951 --> 00:32:39.115]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:39.115 --> 00:32:47.777]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:10.266 --> 00:33:12.848]  And we are back live, contesting worldwide.
[00:33:12.848 --> 00:33:14.329]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:14.329 --> 00:33:18.451]  If you're a radio or TV listener, it is beyond imperative.
[00:33:18.451 --> 00:33:20.012]  It is absolutely essential.
[00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:31.615]  Let you visit DrudgeReport.com, which we'll put on screen, and then you go over to the right-hand side of Drudge and click on the fourth story down.
[00:33:31.615 --> 00:33:34.696]  Ilhan Omar demands UN take control of U.S.
[00:33:34.696 --> 00:33:39.217]  borders in mirror of European migrant crisis.
[00:33:40.197 --> 00:33:42.299]  Paul Joseph Watson and I talked this morning.
[00:33:42.299 --> 00:33:45.021]  I said, my friend, you've written the articles.
[00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:47.703]  I've laid it out here on air for decades.
[00:33:47.703 --> 00:33:55.929]  We've got to create a condensed article showing people that this is actually how the UN does it and that it's their plan every step of the way.
[00:33:55.929 --> 00:33:56.869]  Paul's done that.
[00:33:56.869 --> 00:34:01.093]  This could not be more of a Paul Revere type moment.
[00:34:01.994 --> 00:34:06.576]  The UN has been set up to take over and collapse nation states.
[00:34:06.576 --> 00:34:11.958]  The EU has been set up to take over nation states, suck them dry and collapse them.
[00:34:11.958 --> 00:34:24.402]  The EU is now saying they're going to get rid of national team names because soccer teams and rugby teams and basketball teams that have nationalist names are bad.
[00:34:24.402 --> 00:34:29.544]  We're told that our president saying that America exists is bad.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.524]  We're told the word nationalist is racist.
[00:34:36.524 --> 00:34:49.294]  This is the insane level of this garbage, but it's all in freedom from war, the United Nations program for general and complete disarmament in a peaceful world.
[00:34:49.294 --> 00:34:55.298]  And they say tribes make people fight, families make up tribes, get rid of families.
[00:34:55.298 --> 00:34:58.501]  Religion makes people fight, get rid of religion.
[00:34:58.501 --> 00:35:00.863]  Nations make people fight, get rid of nations.
[00:35:02.076 --> 00:35:03.057]  Get rid of cultures.
[00:35:03.057 --> 00:35:06.619]  But once you've gotten rid of all that, what replaces it?
[00:35:06.619 --> 00:35:14.765]  The trans-humanist, post-human world that NBC News has been telling us about.
[00:35:14.765 --> 00:35:29.896]  So, of course everyone's freaking out right now when Ilhan Omar comes out and says we should do like other nations and have the UN come in and have them organize the refugee centers and then invite more so that it's 10 million a year, not a million a year.
[00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:34.198]  That's the bum rush plan happening.
[00:36:01.539 --> 00:36:17.746]  We should do what any other country does by dealing with this situation in a serious way, Omar said during an immigration forum in South Minneapolis.
[00:36:19.051 --> 00:36:31.461]  So I had to bring in the United Nations High Commissioner, somewhere Russian, on the refugees, an agency that has expertise and the training to handle massive flows of refugees humanely.
[00:36:31.461 --> 00:36:39.288]  Representative Ilhan Omar says the United Nations must be brought in to handle the immigration crisis on America's southern border.
[00:36:39.288 --> 00:36:39.969]  These are all quotes.
[00:36:40.629 --> 00:36:47.476]  Omar, who was accused this week of having an affair with a married man, lectured the audience about the mortal high ground.
[00:36:47.476 --> 00:36:56.725]  Well, she also reportedly gave him a quarter million dollars of campaign cash, which if true makes him, I'm just a gigolo and everywhere I go.
[00:36:56.725 --> 00:37:01.710]  Yes, that's the old song from Van Halen singer.
[00:37:03.277 --> 00:37:15.882]  Continuing, the demand bears hallmarks of how Europe was deluged with migrants or invaders after governments were forced to accept millions of refugees after lobbying from international groups and non-governmental organizations.
[00:37:15.882 --> 00:37:17.363]  Any such intervention by the U.N.
[00:37:17.363 --> 00:37:19.704]  would represent a direct violation of U.S.
[00:37:19.704 --> 00:37:23.606]  sovereignty, fundamentally weakening America's national security.
[00:37:23.606 --> 00:37:30.609]  Omar previously called for the elimination of the entire Department of Homeland Security, which was tasked with dealing with threats to the nation following 9-11.
[00:37:32.947 --> 00:37:38.768]  And I'm going to have one of my writers beef this up a little bit, because I know Paul's busy and he never misses an interview.
[00:37:38.768 --> 00:37:40.849]  He was supposed to be here a few minutes ago.
[00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:45.190]  He's not here, so he might have had an issue getting back into London, but we'll find out.
[00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:59.914]  We're going to add to his articles, previous ones by Paul, we'll just add little blurbs that see his past reports, where the UN says they're going to put 600 million people in the US as replacement populations.
[00:38:00.934 --> 00:38:08.341]  And with Macron saying 200 million from Africa into, of course, France.
[00:38:08.341 --> 00:38:16.309]  Those articles are all up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:20.453]  In fact, let me just read to you from those right now, revealed.
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:21.800]  U.N.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:26.924]  plan to fund America, to flood America, revealed U.N.
[00:38:26.924 --> 00:38:31.327]  plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[00:38:31.327 --> 00:38:37.391]  By 2050, 73% of the population would be immigrants or their descendants.
[00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:38.471]  A 2001 U.N.
[00:38:38.471 --> 00:38:49.519]  strategy document getting fresh attention in light of the migrant crisis because it outlines the need to flood America and Europe with hundreds of millions of migrants in order to maintain population levels.
[00:38:49.519 --> 00:38:51.100]  Entitled Replacement Migration,
[00:38:53.242 --> 00:38:56.565]  is a solution to declining and aging populations.
[00:38:56.565 --> 00:39:04.692]  The plan seeks to offset population decline and population aging, resulting from low fertility and mortality rates.
[00:39:04.692 --> 00:39:05.913]  So they tell people in the U.S.
[00:39:05.913 --> 00:39:18.244]  don't have kids, but then they bring in third-world populations who were first brainwashed for six months at refugee camps and then taken control of by socialist, communist, anti-democratic parties.
[00:39:19.614 --> 00:39:27.639]  It concedes that mass migration to the West is needed for governments to maintain established economic, social, and political policies and programs.
[00:39:27.639 --> 00:39:34.944]  The strategy documents sets out six potential scenarios for each country or region of the world necessary to meet the goal.
[00:39:34.944 --> 00:39:41.608]  Under the most severe scenario, large numbers of migrants will be required to maintain the population support ratio.
[00:39:41.608 --> 00:39:43.749]  How is 600 million in the U.S.
[00:39:43.749 --> 00:39:45.330]  alone maintaining the 340 million?
[00:39:46.641 --> 00:39:49.602]  No, they are politically supercharged with hate.
[00:39:49.602 --> 00:39:52.804]  They are brought in and they are taught that white people are evil.
[00:39:52.804 --> 00:39:55.885]  Turn on any channel, any show, it's all you see.
[00:39:55.885 --> 00:40:06.850]  And just today, without even looking, uncle of Italian girl murdered by migrants from Nigeria threatened to show photos of her dismembered body if immigration laws are loosened.
[00:40:08.337 --> 00:40:15.360]  Ethiopian national stabs to death random white girl walking her dogs in DC because she was white.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.521]  This is every day by the hundreds.
[00:40:17.521 --> 00:40:22.604]  The fire bombings, the killings, the mass grooming, and this is all targeting
[00:40:24.554 --> 00:40:30.378]  White people, Westerners, and the UN is brainwashing them to do this before they come in.
[00:40:30.378 --> 00:40:32.499]  They're even giving them hand grenades.
[00:40:32.499 --> 00:40:39.604]  There's hand grenade attacks every day in Europe now, where the Islamists will throw hand grenades into white families at picnic tables.
[00:40:39.604 --> 00:40:44.707]  All of this is being done to completely destroy the West, and why?
[00:40:44.707 --> 00:40:46.829]  Because the megacorporations already dominate the third world.
[00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:48.269]  And already use it.
[00:40:48.269 --> 00:40:51.631]  If they can dominate the first world and destroy the Renaissance, they win.
[00:40:51.631 --> 00:40:53.512]  We did get Paul Joseph Watson connected.
[00:40:53.512 --> 00:41:04.038]  We're going to come back to him on the other side to get into Hong Kong, what he witnessed, but also this big report up on DrudgeReport.com that is so critical.
[00:41:04.038 --> 00:41:06.980]  I know you as an audience know about the UN takeover plan.
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:10.101]  I know you're aware of this whole globalist operation.
[00:41:10.101 --> 00:41:12.663]  But if you don't get this to everyone you know,
[00:41:13.905 --> 00:41:15.910]  Then they're not going to understand the big picture.
[00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:21.243]  So I appreciate Paul getting this article out today, but we're going to add to it for him, or he'll do it.
[00:41:22.659 --> 00:41:31.007]  Where the UN says it's part of a plan to overturn the West, and where it's part of a plan to replace the population in their own admissions.
[00:41:31.007 --> 00:41:36.432]  That's something that the globalists and Snopes said, well, it's a real document, but they don't really plan to do that.
[00:41:36.432 --> 00:41:37.513]  They are doing it.
[00:41:37.513 --> 00:41:38.974]  They don't want this out.
[00:41:38.974 --> 00:41:40.836]  This is critical information.
[00:41:40.836 --> 00:41:44.540]  You've got to get these articles out right now.
[00:41:45.512 --> 00:41:46.814]  It's so critical.
[00:41:46.814 --> 00:41:47.815]  And the same U.N.
[00:41:47.815 --> 00:41:50.358]  system says, overthrow Russia for the Islamists.
[00:41:50.358 --> 00:41:52.941]  Overthrow Israel for the Islamists.
[00:41:52.941 --> 00:42:03.475]  And they've got the left chomping at the bit, wanting to get Israel, so they're accepting this worldwide against every Western nation state, and saying Israel's mainly white, so it deserves to be overthrown.
[00:42:03.735 --> 00:42:08.339]  That was even though Bill Maher had guessed on saying that two weeks ago and Bill Maher disagreed.
[00:42:08.339 --> 00:42:15.305]  So now Ilhan Omar and Tlaib say boycott Bill Maher for saying that white people should be able to live.
[00:42:15.305 --> 00:42:17.427]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[00:42:21.067 --> 00:42:27.671]  One half of the incredible 8-pack Power Stack, the AM Wake Up and Work Packet is exactly what you need to start your day right.
[00:42:27.671 --> 00:42:37.496]  The pack contains five original formulas built to fuel your day and take care of your body's individual needs in the morning, targeting the heart, brain, muscles, energy production, and more.
[00:42:37.496 --> 00:42:44.460]  Each AM pack contains a flex and joint support, energy kickstart, krill oil, nootropic brain, and greens detox formula.

[00:42:50.761 --> 00:42:53.402]  Containing four original formulas, the P.M.

[00:43:04.704 --> 00:43:08.725]  Packet was created to support improving your body's bones and immune system.

[00:43:10.828 --> 00:43:12.111]  When combined with the A.M.

[00:43:54.957 --> 00:43:57.899]  That's why it's so important that you try Survival Shield X2.

[00:44:21.169 --> 00:44:32.397]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[00:44:32.397 --> 00:44:36.520]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:45.887]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[00:44:46.627 --> 00:44:48.648]  The system is vulnerable.
[00:44:48.648 --> 00:44:51.330]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:54.952]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.

[00:45:23.873 --> 00:45:27.315]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[00:45:27.315 --> 00:45:30.578]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:45:30.578 --> 00:45:32.599]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:45:32.599 --> 00:45:37.163]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[00:45:40.066 --> 00:45:43.189]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[00:45:43.189 --> 00:45:44.229]  It's a form of fascism.
[00:45:44.229 --> 00:45:48.953]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[00:45:48.953 --> 00:46:00.282]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[00:46:00.282 --> 00:46:03.685]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Dominoes would fall.
[00:46:11.886 --> 00:46:15.851]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:46:15.851 --> 00:46:17.213]  You can't watch this!
[00:46:17.213 --> 00:46:27.547]  The movie available now at infowarsstore.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:46:46.787 --> 00:46:48.709]  I'm watching the midterms.
[00:46:48.709 --> 00:46:52.572]  Man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:46:52.572 --> 00:47:00.238]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:47:00.238 --> 00:47:02.140]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.642]  You want a drop?
[00:47:04.642 --> 00:47:13.208]  You want a drop?
[00:47:13.208 --> 00:47:14.790]  Yeah!
[00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:16.271]  Who are the presidents?
[00:47:19.837 --> 00:47:42.089]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[00:47:51.887 --> 00:48:00.112]  And folks, we have good footage of African migrant invaders attacking federal police on the Guatemala-Mexico border viciously.
[00:48:00.112 --> 00:48:03.814]  We're going to be playing some of that coming up in a moment.
[00:48:03.814 --> 00:48:07.937]  Paul Joseph Watson just got back from Hong Kong.
[00:48:09.271 --> 00:48:12.192]  And he's saying, oh, this ties together.
[00:48:12.192 --> 00:48:12.673]  The U.N.
[00:48:12.673 --> 00:48:13.613]  invasion, the U.N.
[00:48:13.613 --> 00:48:14.873]  saying open the borders, the U.N.
[00:48:14.873 --> 00:48:19.495]  saying let us run your border system, let us build refugee centers in the U.S.
[00:48:19.495 --> 00:48:20.396]  like we've done in Europe.
[00:48:20.396 --> 00:48:21.936]  This is all a plan.
[00:48:21.936 --> 00:48:27.358]  Paul Joseph Watson's story is top-linked up on the right-hand side of DrugsReport.com.
[00:48:27.358 --> 00:48:29.059]  Critical to get that out.
[00:48:29.059 --> 00:48:32.320]  Paul, wow, so much happened in Hong Kong.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:36.142]  You are now here back in the U.K.
[00:48:36.142 --> 00:48:37.342]  This all ties together.
[00:48:37.342 --> 00:48:38.303]  Where do you want to start first?
[00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:48.077]  Well, it ties together, Alex, on three continents, because you have that quote from Ilhan Omar talking about the UN's plan to take over the US border.
[00:48:48.077 --> 00:48:51.860]  We know they called for 600 million migrants who went to America by 2050.
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.663]  That report was our exclusive as well.
[00:48:54.663 --> 00:48:59.747]  In Europe, on a different continent, you have the collapse of Salvini's government.
[00:48:59.747 --> 00:49:04.610]  He was the one guy at the fulcrum of preventing the migrant crisis in Europe.
[00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:07.713]  He basically stopped the migrant crisis, at least at the level it was at.
[00:49:08.157 --> 00:49:09.718]  That government's now collapsed.
[00:49:09.718 --> 00:49:18.965]  They've got a coalition with the centre-left party and the Five Star Movement, so Salvini's now out of power until 2023, I believe.
[00:49:18.965 --> 00:49:26.530]  Trump has already praised Conte, the left wing of the new Prime Minister, so he didn't have Salvini's back, unfortunately.
[00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:36.157]  And then in Hong Kong, as we saw this week, Alex, and this is not being reported by any media that I've seen, but this is what the protesters who we spoke to on the ground are saying.
[00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:43.777]  But one of the primary reasons why they're protesting is resentment against immigration from mainland China.
[00:49:43.777 --> 00:49:45.759]  It's even worse than immigration into Europe.
[00:49:46.559 --> 00:50:01.713]  Because not only do they get immediate access to the jobs market, to housing benefits, to health care benefits, by order of the Chinese government basically, coming from the mainland into Hong Kong with a totally different culture, very different from what you would expect.
[00:50:01.713 --> 00:50:07.259]  You would expect them to have a very similar culture, but they don't according to the protests within Hong Kong.
[00:50:07.259 --> 00:50:09.781]  And Alex, they're allowed to vote!
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:16.182]  Imagine having millions of migrants coming over from Mexico and they immediately get the right to vote.
[00:50:16.182 --> 00:50:17.863]  And guess what they vote for?
[00:50:17.863 --> 00:50:20.904]  They vote for more power for Beijing.
[00:50:20.904 --> 00:50:28.566]  So you've already got this tenuous situation in Hong Kong where the leader of Hong Kong has to be approved by Beijing.
[00:50:28.566 --> 00:50:32.788]  Half of the executive body is pro-China.
[00:50:32.788 --> 00:50:36.049]  And now you're getting tons of Chinese immigrants moving into Hong Kong.
[00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:39.754]  Voting against the interests of the Hong Kong people.
[00:50:39.754 --> 00:50:47.263]  That is one of the primary reasons why they're out on the street protesting and no mainstream media outlet will talk about it.
[00:50:47.263 --> 00:50:48.144]  Isn't that a surprise?
[00:50:49.758 --> 00:50:52.159]  And Paul, let me add this, because this is so critical.
[00:50:52.159 --> 00:50:54.140]  China is unelected.
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:54.580]  1949.
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:55.680]  Communist overthrow.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.961]  What's left of it at the end of World War II.
[00:50:57.961 --> 00:51:00.482]  Start killing tens of millions of people right away.
[00:51:00.482 --> 00:51:06.385]  Anybody that had a job, or a company, or who was smart, who could run, ran to Hong Kong, ran to Taiwan.
[00:51:06.385 --> 00:51:07.585]  That was 70 years ago.
[00:51:07.585 --> 00:51:09.306]  Right now is the 70th anniversary.
[00:51:09.306 --> 00:51:11.207]  Coming up here in just a few weeks, as you know.
[00:51:11.207 --> 00:51:14.388]  Chinese armored vehicles are now entering, as we speak, today.
[00:51:14.388 --> 00:51:15.088]  That's confirmed.
[00:51:15.088 --> 00:51:16.469]  So the troops are now starting to roll in.
[00:51:17.529 --> 00:51:42.675]  But Hong Kong has elections and representative democracy, so the Chinese move in and then use that to vote them under Chinese control, and now the government, as you know, two years ago got voted under Chinese control, right as the new bridge the Chinese built, the biggest in the world, from the mainland was completed, which they promised would never be used as an invasion point, and it's now being used as an invasion point.
[00:51:42.875 --> 00:51:43.195]  Precisely.
[00:51:43.195 --> 00:51:45.777]  And the key problem is they don't integrate.
[00:51:45.777 --> 00:51:48.379]  Just like in Europe, they don't integrate.
[00:51:48.379 --> 00:51:52.722]  We're told that, you know, we need these giant numbers of immigrants in order to fund the pension funds, the social security system.
[00:51:52.722 --> 00:51:56.864]  In Europe, the majority of them immediately go on welfare.
[00:51:56.864 --> 00:51:58.426]  They don't pay tax.
[00:52:12.893 --> 00:52:22.337]  And meanwhile we're being told as white Westerners not to have children, so they're deliberately driving down our population and saying we need these to replace us.
[00:52:22.337 --> 00:52:34.582]  And yet in China you have a situation, for example, where as a foreigner you try to get a taxi and on some occasions, driven by a Chinese immigrant, they're refusing to take foreigners in their own taxis.
[00:52:34.582 --> 00:52:37.443]  So it's like reverse discrimination, Alex.
[00:52:37.443 --> 00:52:39.543]  I posted a photo on Twitter.
[00:52:39.543 --> 00:52:40.804]  Dozens of taxis
[00:52:41.704 --> 00:52:49.366]  Driving through the streets of Hong Kong while these mass protests are taking place, waving giant Chinese flags out the back of their vehicles.
[00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:59.348]  So they've brought the migrants in, they're voting against the interests of the Hong Kong people, and discriminating against Hong Kong people and Westerners in Hong Kong.
[00:52:59.348 --> 00:53:03.389]  The other aspect, Alex, is this whole anti-surveillance movement.
[00:53:03.389 --> 00:53:08.370]  Another key plank of the protest movement in Hong Kong is against mass surveillance.
[00:53:08.783 --> 00:53:13.126]  They're concerned about the Chinese social credit score being introduced there.
[00:53:13.126 --> 00:53:18.450]  That's why they've got lasers pointed at all the cameras to stop the facial recognition.
[00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:23.934]  That's why they literally tore down these smart lamps, which have been put up all over the city.
[00:53:23.934 --> 00:53:28.137]  The government, the pro-Beijing government, claims it's to measure air quality.
[00:53:28.561 --> 00:53:36.267]  The protesters actually say they're for facial tracking surveillance to tie into, ultimately, the Chinese social credit score system.
[00:53:36.267 --> 00:53:41.431]  So a fundamental plank of these protests is against Big Brother, against surveillance.
[00:53:41.431 --> 00:53:43.373]  They're waving US flags.
[00:53:43.373 --> 00:53:45.815]  They're calling on Trump to support them.
[00:53:45.815 --> 00:53:48.958]  They're even carrying around Pepe memes.
[00:53:48.958 --> 00:53:50.619]  So this is not a left-wing protest.
[00:53:51.127 --> 00:53:53.470]  They've been discredited as far-right.
[00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:54.731]  They're not far-right.
[00:53:54.731 --> 00:53:59.716]  The left in America has tried to tie all this into their obsession with the culture war.
[00:53:59.716 --> 00:54:02.299]  There is really no left and right in Hong Kong.
[00:54:02.299 --> 00:54:11.730]  It's classic authoritarianism versus liberty, and that's what they're protesting for, and against the Big Brother surveillance system that we've largely accepted in the West.
[00:54:12.346 --> 00:54:14.767]  Paul, this is beyond a movie.
[00:54:14.767 --> 00:54:16.508]  This is really sensational.
[00:54:16.508 --> 00:54:18.870]  This is 1776 type stuff.
[00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:20.530]  This is Magna Carta type stuff.
[00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:29.756]  And, of course, for hundreds of years, the British have been in Hong Kong, and just like we got our Bill of Rights out of Magna Carta, they have some of those similar systems.
[00:54:29.756 --> 00:54:37.039]  They've had hundreds of years of basic freedom versus 70 years of communist mass murder re-education camps.
[00:54:37.039 --> 00:54:39.621]  So, of course, the two groups are incompatible.
[00:54:39.921 --> 00:54:47.527]  China, as you know, has about 12 different ethnic groups that don't get along with each other, even though genetically they're basically the same people.
[00:54:47.527 --> 00:55:03.820]  So this is Asian not wanting Asian to come in and overturn the place they built, one of the most successful islands in the world, and they don't want to be usurped, and they don't want to be spied on, and they don't want their children to grow up where they can be secretly arrested and disappeared.
[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:04.981]  We should be with them.
[00:55:04.981 --> 00:55:06.342]  We should be standing with them.
[00:55:06.342 --> 00:55:08.404]  This isn't like some fake regime change.
[00:55:08.664 --> 00:55:11.445]  That the globalists would be pushing in Syria or someplace.
[00:55:11.445 --> 00:55:13.985]  This is good!
[00:55:13.985 --> 00:55:18.987]  Precisely, and there are several ways in which it mirrors what's happening in the United States, Alex.
[00:55:18.987 --> 00:55:27.889]  Just as in the United States, we're now, you know, with Maxine Waters and everyone calling for Trump supporters, Trump cabinet members to be confronted in public at restaurants.
[00:55:28.753 --> 00:55:32.514]  People wearing MAGA hats assaulted on the street on a routine basis.
[00:55:32.514 --> 00:55:37.856]  They want to make it completely intolerable to support freedom and democracy in Hong Kong.
[00:55:37.856 --> 00:55:47.339]  To the point now where the police, the pro-Beijing authorities, are working with triad gangs and criminal members to literally hunt down protest leaders in the streets.
[00:55:47.339 --> 00:55:50.140]  And there's a Financial Times article about this today.
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:54.981]  And beat them up to prevent them from organizing in and taking part in protest.
[00:55:54.981 --> 00:55:57.222]  So it's really an across-the-board thing.
[00:55:57.222 --> 00:55:58.242]  To give you an example,
[00:55:59.136 --> 00:55:59.477]  I don't know.
[00:56:20.046 --> 00:56:26.648]  So locked down that many Chinese people have never even heard of Jesus Christ!
[00:56:26.648 --> 00:56:31.190]  That's how much authoritarianism and control of information there is in China.
[00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:35.852]  The social credit score and it's exactly what's being introduced in America Alex.
[00:56:35.852 --> 00:56:36.432]  You've got CNN.
[00:56:37.489 --> 00:56:53.860]  Today saying, oh, isn't it horrible that the Chinese government, the Hong Kong authorities, are considering banning social media, deplatforming protest organizers, when that's the exact same thing they've been lobbying for against dissidents in the West for the past two years plus.
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.821]  Oh, but it's bad when it happens in Hong Kong.
[00:56:55.821 --> 00:56:56.641]  Complete hypocrisy.
[00:56:56.641 --> 00:56:57.882]  Stay in attack formation.
[00:56:57.882 --> 00:56:59.443]  This is incredible radio.
[00:56:59.443 --> 00:57:00.504]  This isn't fiction.
[00:57:00.504 --> 00:57:01.545]  It's not Netflix.
[00:57:01.545 --> 00:57:02.565]  It's happening!
[00:57:02.565 --> 00:57:04.667]  A global info war for human freedom!
[00:57:05.348 --> 00:57:07.240]  You're either for freedom or against it!
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:07.984]  We'll be right back!
[00:57:11.559 --> 00:57:12.760]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.122]  I've been so busy I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[00:57:16.122 --> 00:57:17.363]  But it's very exciting.
[00:57:17.363 --> 00:57:19.685]  It's Super Silver Skin Cream.
[00:57:19.685 --> 00:57:21.206]  It's got all of these benefits.
[00:57:21.206 --> 00:57:22.287]  Too many to mention.
[00:57:22.287 --> 00:57:23.568]  But it's revolutionary.
[00:57:23.568 --> 00:57:24.508]  It's brand new.
[00:57:24.508 --> 00:57:25.389]  People are going to love it.
[00:57:25.389 --> 00:57:27.491]  Introducing the new Super Silver Skin Cream.
[00:57:27.491 --> 00:57:28.872]  Exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:28.872 --> 00:57:30.393]  25% off introductory price.
[00:57:30.393 --> 00:57:33.075]  The new Super Silver Skin Cream is the best of both worlds.
[00:57:33.075 --> 00:57:35.297]  It helps reduce wrinkles and keep your skin healthy.
[00:57:35.297 --> 00:57:37.118]  Super Silver Skin Cream is infused with
[00:57:37.318 --> 00:57:37.498]  I think?
[00:57:57.432 --> 00:57:57.792]  I think so.
[00:58:12.077 --> 00:58:28.005]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[00:58:28.005 --> 00:58:29.726]  It is completely independent of all that.
[00:58:29.726 --> 00:58:40.611]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[00:58:40.811 --> 00:58:41.351]  We're good to go.
[00:59:00.726 --> 00:59:02.907]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:59:42.065 --> 00:59:48.210]  Ladies and gentlemen, if I seem excited and on the edge of my seat, India's invaded Kashmir.
[00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:51.912]  China is rolling troops into Hong Kong.
[00:59:51.912 --> 00:59:58.457]  The Democrats are all over the news saying burn down cities, kill Trump supporters, burn down their buildings.
[00:59:58.457 --> 01:00:00.939]  I mean, this is on MSNBC.
[01:00:00.939 --> 01:00:04.001]  The UN plan is flooding our borders.
[01:00:04.001 --> 01:00:07.444]  The left is invoking the migrants to kill white people.
[01:00:07.444 --> 01:00:09.766]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:00:09.766 --> 01:00:11.287]  Giant child kidnapping rings.
[01:00:12.691 --> 01:00:18.252]  You cannot make this up, and it's only getting crazier by the minute.
[01:00:18.252 --> 01:00:20.033]  But humanity's waking up.
[01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:23.953]  And again, it's not that people from Africa or Latin America or Asia are bad people.
[01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:35.776]  It's the ones that UN brainwashes in these camps are low-educated, bottom of the barrel, brainwashed for six months, then shipped in to the West to literally run around like wild animals, killing people.
[01:00:38.649 --> 01:00:42.331]  This plan is to bring down civilization and have a global civil war.
[01:00:42.331 --> 01:00:44.733]  Paul, we're in a civil war right now.
[01:00:44.733 --> 01:00:46.214]  Yeah, let's play the audio of this.
[01:00:46.214 --> 01:00:50.437]  In fact, we'll get to this next segment, but this is just yesterday in Mexico.
[01:00:50.437 --> 01:00:59.443]  This is Africans from Africa by the thousands shipped in by the UN and dumped out in Guatemala attacking Mexican police.
[01:00:59.443 --> 01:01:02.165]  I mean, this isn't supposed to be happening.
[01:01:02.905 --> 01:01:04.506]  But this is the UN.
[01:01:04.506 --> 01:01:14.470]  So this is a global civil war between nation states who aren't perfect and the global corporations of the UN who admit, Paul, you have all the documents, I have all the documents.
[01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:17.151]  People need to know this is a plan.
[01:01:17.151 --> 01:01:18.111]  Can you elaborate on that?
[01:01:18.111 --> 01:01:20.232]  We'll get back into Hong Kong next segment.
[01:01:20.232 --> 01:01:25.374]  But this is how you take over countries is collapsing borders and migration.
[01:01:27.438 --> 01:01:34.483]  No, we've seen that, especially in London, where there's basically a stabbing every night now, a mass stabbing.
[01:01:34.483 --> 01:01:38.345]  Five minutes from where I live, there were two stabbings over the past two weeks.
[01:01:38.345 --> 01:01:47.191]  And again, when you look into it, 73% of the people responsible are from what they call BAME ethnic minority groups.
[01:01:47.191 --> 01:01:52.915]  The immigrants who came in from the Congo, these really violent areas of Africa, are so violent
[01:01:53.715 --> 01:02:02.040]  That the local crime gangs had to step up their levels of violence simply to compete in these postcode turf wars in London.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.021]  And that's what you're seeing right now.
[01:02:04.021 --> 01:02:15.187]  We're at a point now in London where Somalian migrants are sending their own children back to Somalia because they say it's safer for them in Somalia than it is in London.
[01:02:15.187 --> 01:02:17.768]  These are the joys of diversity, Alex.
[01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:21.250]  And again, that's one of the things they're protesting about in Hong Kong.
[01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:22.991]  They're also flying American flags.
[01:02:23.476 --> 01:02:26.138]  People keep asking why they're flying American flags.
[01:02:26.138 --> 01:02:29.139]  Very simple, because it represents liberty and democracy.
[01:02:29.139 --> 01:02:36.624]  Unlike in Portland where, you know, snarling, spitting leftists burn the American flag, in Hong Kong they actually venerate it.
[01:02:36.624 --> 01:02:44.288]  Unlike in Portland and these kind of areas where your crew are attacked and defamed and viciously snarl that in person.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:54.988]  The protesters in Hong Kong, although they might dress similar to Antifa with the black out of the ski masks and whatever, they're the most kind, polite people you could ever imagine.
[01:02:54.988 --> 01:02:58.050]  But if you piss them off, they will come against you.
[01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:00.912]  These protesters are like nothing else I've seen.
[01:03:00.912 --> 01:03:02.013]  The levels of courage.
[01:03:02.782 --> 01:03:06.243]  That they have to go up against rubber bullets, tear gas.
[01:03:06.243 --> 01:03:09.705]  I mean, they were even tear gassing them inside shopping malls.
[01:03:09.705 --> 01:03:14.507]  It was absolutely incredible what we witnessed in the streets of Hong Kong.
[01:03:14.507 --> 01:03:16.948]  And again, they're flying the American flag.
[01:03:16.948 --> 01:03:27.252]  They're not protesting, Alex, like the left does in America, for rights that they already have, like these gay pride marches, just so they can take a selfie and put it on Instagram.
[01:03:27.935 --> 01:03:42.621]  They're literally going up against one of the most feared military regimes on the planet that flattens people with tanks if they stand up against them, that puts a million minority members in re-education camps wanting to take over Hong Kong.
[01:03:42.621 --> 01:03:44.522]  This is not the first protest of its kind.
[01:03:44.522 --> 01:03:45.963]  This has been going on in Hong Kong
[01:03:46.463 --> 01:03:52.786]  Solidly, year after year, for the past 20 years or so, and it really seems to be coming to the fore now, Alex.
[01:03:52.786 --> 01:03:58.329]  But just to compare these protesters to what you see in America with the chicken-necked Antifa thugs.
[01:03:58.329 --> 01:04:02.551]  If you put them up against the Hong Kong protesters, they wouldn't stand a chance.
[01:04:02.551 --> 01:04:06.413]  That's right, because the Antifa love the Chi-Coms.
[01:04:06.413 --> 01:04:07.574]  They love evil.
[01:04:07.574 --> 01:04:09.635]  That's like their mascot is Xi, the dictator.
[01:04:09.635 --> 01:04:13.177]  We'll be back and talk about the armored personnel carriers now entering Hong Kong.
[01:04:13.177 --> 01:04:15.618]  Looks like we got our reporters out in the nick of time.
[01:04:15.998 --> 01:04:16.324]  I won't.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.020]  Oh, thank you.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:52.141]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[01:04:52.141 --> 01:04:53.642]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[01:04:53.642 --> 01:04:54.683]  I want a good price.
[01:04:54.683 --> 01:04:58.785]  But I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[01:04:58.785 --> 01:05:01.046]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off.
[01:05:01.046 --> 01:05:04.648]  And so it's the same thing with like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[01:05:04.648 --> 01:05:05.609]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[01:05:05.609 --> 01:05:09.791]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[01:05:09.791 --> 01:05:17.495]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, and then we're doing 50% off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot points, we lose money.
[01:05:17.495 --> 01:05:17.875]  But that's OK.
[01:05:17.875 --> 01:05:18.756]  Thanks for the support.
[01:05:36.195 --> 01:05:38.577]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:05:38.577 --> 01:05:41.660]  We have just had an astounding last hour.
[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:52.409]  Armored vehicles by the hundreds and thousands of Chinese troops are now entering into Hong Kong on the biggest bridge in the world, the longest bridge in the world, built in the last two years.
[01:05:52.409 --> 01:05:56.233]  So the Chinese military is now invading.
[01:05:56.233 --> 01:06:00.757]  I felt a disturbance in the force two days ago and I called Paul and I called
[01:06:01.761 --> 01:06:07.284]  Greg Reese and Savannah Hernandez and everybody and I said, get the hell out of there.
[01:06:07.284 --> 01:06:10.545]  They're like, oh no, the word is the Chinese military is not going to invade.
[01:06:10.545 --> 01:06:12.206]  The Chinese military is not going to invade.
[01:06:12.206 --> 01:06:13.246]  I said, they're invading.
[01:06:13.246 --> 01:06:14.127]  Get ready.
[01:06:14.127 --> 01:06:15.327]  Get out of there.
[01:06:15.327 --> 01:06:19.169]  I have the text messages because I know how commies operate.
[01:06:19.169 --> 01:06:24.311]  If they tell you they're not going to invade and that invasion isn't imminent, you know it's going to happen.
[01:06:24.311 --> 01:06:25.172]  Paul Watson was there.
[01:06:26.428 --> 01:06:28.555]  Just 24 hours ago.
[01:06:28.555 --> 01:06:29.919]  He just got back to London, England.
[01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:33.470]  We're going to go back to him in just a moment, but this is so huge.
[01:06:34.571 --> 01:06:35.312]  I didn't plug last time.
[01:06:35.312 --> 01:06:36.252]  I'm going to plug right now.
[01:06:36.252 --> 01:06:38.053]  We're running two huge mega specials.
[01:06:38.053 --> 01:06:44.778]  Introducing the new Super Silver Skin Cream that's got the hyaluronic acid that the women and everybody absolutely love.
[01:06:44.778 --> 01:06:47.040]  It's so good for your skin.
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.621]  It's high quality hyaluronic acid.
[01:06:49.621 --> 01:06:56.506]  Then it's got all of these different great vitamins and minerals in it as well.
[01:06:56.506 --> 01:06:59.188]  It's BPA free.
[01:06:59.188 --> 01:07:00.068]  But here's the key.
[01:07:00.068 --> 01:07:03.030]  It's got the patented nano silver salt
[01:07:04.042 --> 01:07:05.504]  Technology.
[01:07:05.504 --> 01:07:07.966]  Skin cream.
[01:07:07.966 --> 01:07:09.848]  Inside the skin cream, it has that.
[01:07:09.848 --> 01:07:14.553]  It's 10 times more effective than similar products containing up to 3,000 ppm silver.
[01:07:14.553 --> 01:07:17.676]  It's only 20 ppm silver because of the patented system.
[01:07:17.676 --> 01:07:23.582]  It's the same silver that is in the FDA approved for over-the-counter and use in medical facilities.
[01:07:23.582 --> 01:07:25.985]  Silver, super silver wound dressing gel.
[01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:29.296]  We're able to private label this.
[01:07:29.296 --> 01:07:32.939]  No one else is, because the owners of this company are fans.
[01:07:32.939 --> 01:07:43.005]  And so again, we now worked with them in the last year to develop a whole new product line that we're exclusively putting out, they're kind of beta testing it with us, that is skin cream.
[01:07:43.005 --> 01:07:46.107]  So it's an antibiotic, healthy, natural skin cream.
[01:07:46.107 --> 01:07:48.449]  It's so revolutionary, and here's the great point.
[01:07:48.449 --> 01:07:50.730]  It's $7 for the little tube, $14 for the big tube.
[01:07:52.291 --> 01:07:56.032]  Just hyaluronic acid of this quality would be 30 bucks.
[01:07:56.032 --> 01:07:59.613]  You know, some place like Ulta or something, because they mark it up four or five times.
[01:07:59.613 --> 01:08:01.654]  Which I get, it takes money to run operations.
[01:08:01.654 --> 01:08:03.695]  That's not our model.
[01:08:03.695 --> 01:08:04.975]  That's not how we do it.
[01:08:04.975 --> 01:08:09.256]  So it's available 25% off, out of the gates, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:08:09.256 --> 01:08:14.518]  But it's already going to sell out very soon, so we're going to have to end that special at the end of the weekend.
[01:08:14.518 --> 01:08:16.359]  There's another big special.
[01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:17.259]  Nine days left.
[01:08:18.223 --> 01:08:28.828]  To get DNA Force Plus at 50% off with the PQQ, the CoQ10, all the rest of it, what it does for your cells, your body, your energy, your brain.
[01:08:28.828 --> 01:08:29.749]  It's everything.
[01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:38.673]  It's the basis, the building block for all the other supplements and other things you do, like the things you eat, the things you drink, to overall purify and make all those building blocks.
[01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:49.981]  Work better and you get a free 90 count bottle of carnivore enzyme to help digest protein and fat and flush your stomach and guts out like nothing else can.
[01:08:49.981 --> 01:08:54.006]  It costs us 17 plus dollars just to produce this bottle of carnivore.
[01:08:54.006 --> 01:08:57.149]  Why am I doing it even though we're close to selling out of carnivore?
[01:08:57.149 --> 01:08:59.552]  Because I need more money to order more carnivore for next year.
[01:09:00.919 --> 01:09:06.761]  And I think you're going to think it's so amazing that you're going to become a steady buyer of Carnivore at $30.
[01:09:06.761 --> 01:09:10.003]  You know, so we make 13 bucks on it.
[01:09:10.003 --> 01:09:17.666]  But right now it's a $17 plus value free with super male vitality and of course DNA force plus.
[01:09:19.053 --> 01:09:21.775]  But that's only while the bottles of Carnivore last.
[01:09:21.775 --> 01:09:28.639]  And there's only 2,000 or so of the 30 count, a little more than 2,000 of the 90 count that you get with these.
[01:09:28.639 --> 01:09:31.861]  And so when they're gone, nine days left in fullworkstore.com.
[01:09:31.861 --> 01:09:40.006]  And that's how we financed sending camera guy and reporters to Hong Kong for a week to bring you all of that world exclusive footage.
[01:09:40.006 --> 01:09:41.467]  So thank you for the support.
[01:09:41.467 --> 01:09:43.308]  Paul, you've got the floor for the rest of this segment.
[01:09:44.208 --> 01:09:46.249]  Recap how huge this is.
[01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:48.410]  Armored vehicles now invading.
[01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:50.390]  Already the motorcycle cops by the thousands.
[01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:54.552]  Already leaders of the resistance being beaten half to death.
[01:09:54.552 --> 01:09:56.092]  This is so ominous.
[01:09:56.092 --> 01:10:00.834]  The Chi Com said, oh, we're not going to move in, at least for a few weeks or months, maybe never.
[01:10:00.834 --> 01:10:05.255]  Now they're moving in, risking a new Tiananmen Square of biblical proportions, Paul.
[01:10:05.255 --> 01:10:11.957]  A lot of experts, and I agree with them, say that if they have a new Tiananmen Square there in Hong Kong, they won't control it like they controlled 1989.
[01:10:11.957 --> 01:10:12.398]  This could really
[01:10:13.738 --> 01:10:26.029]  Well yeah, you've got experts in Hong Kong saying it could bring down the entire capitalist system if they invade with tanks like they did with Tiananmen Square.
[01:10:26.849 --> 01:10:28.930]  What I didn't mention is the demands of the protesters.
[01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:30.051]  Okay, they've got five demands.
[01:10:30.051 --> 01:10:38.775]  The primary demand is the withdrawal of this bill, which allows suspects in Hong Kong, which would be these protest leaders, to be extradited to China.
[01:10:38.775 --> 01:10:41.236]  They've only suspended it, they haven't withdrawn it.
[01:10:41.236 --> 01:10:44.557]  So now they're talking about martial law, basically.
[01:10:44.557 --> 01:10:49.400]  They're talking about forced seizure of property, where you can enter a property without a warrant.
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.021]  Talking about terms of life imprisonment.
[01:10:52.021 --> 01:10:56.203]  And they're talking about censoring the media, which of course means social media.
[01:10:56.755 --> 01:11:03.699]  That's what the media in the West has lobbied for for the past two years, and they've got the nerves to call it out as being bad in Hong Kong.
[01:11:03.699 --> 01:11:05.980]  So you've got the martial law coming in.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:16.805]  Then, as you mentioned today, you've got this garrison of Chinese troops within Hong Kong claiming they're just doing routine maneuvers while the PLA tanks roll through the streets.
[01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:18.346]  What's going to happen next, Alex?
[01:11:18.346 --> 01:11:23.689]  Well, in China, you've got this culture of saving face, of not being embarrassed.
[01:11:23.689 --> 01:11:26.530]  That's what the entire nation of China is founded around.
[01:11:27.282 --> 01:11:33.924]  October 1st is the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
[01:11:33.924 --> 01:11:48.429]  So everyone in Hong Kong, all the media, is speculating that China has to get this under wraps, and if that includes violent repression then so be it, before the 1st of October because they want to save face and that's what it's all about.
[01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:53.031]  So on the flip side, the protesters are planning something absolutely massive
[01:11:53.419 --> 01:11:53.719]  I don't
[01:12:12.287 --> 01:12:16.008]  The government then declares that any protest after that is banned.
[01:12:16.008 --> 01:12:23.051]  They bring in the riot cops, they push back the protesters, they fire the tear gas, they fire the rubber bullets.
[01:12:23.051 --> 01:12:25.111]  Greg Rees got all that footage.
[01:12:25.111 --> 01:12:26.612]  Savannah got tear gassed.
[01:12:26.612 --> 01:12:28.553]  It was absolute bedlam.
[01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:32.594]  You had one medic who basically lost her eye because of a rubber bullet.
[01:12:32.594 --> 01:12:34.835]  And it only seems to be escalating.
[01:12:34.835 --> 01:12:38.336]  You've got Chinese troops massing in nearby Shenzhen.
[01:12:39.056 --> 01:12:39.857]  We're good to go.
[01:12:54.993 --> 01:12:57.473]  These protesters, though, they're not stopping.
[01:12:57.473 --> 01:12:58.534]  We talked to them.
[01:12:58.534 --> 01:13:03.555]  Every single one said, until the five demands are met, they are not stopping.
[01:13:03.555 --> 01:13:05.275]  They are going to be out on the streets.
[01:13:05.275 --> 01:13:08.815]  They're going to be battling the riot cops until the bitter end.
[01:13:08.815 --> 01:13:22.538]  So what's coming next could be a lot worse than what we've seen already, and it's chilling to think what could happen, Alex, given that Tiananmen Square, where they literally flattened people for wanting free speech in China, was only 30 years ago.
[01:13:24.335 --> 01:13:30.076]  Paul, again, it is being confirmed by Reuters and others as you were posting last night.
[01:13:30.076 --> 01:13:31.837]  Armored vehicles by the hundreds are entering.
[01:13:31.837 --> 01:13:34.558]  Chinese troops are entering Hong Kong right now.
[01:13:34.558 --> 01:13:39.839]  There have been increases in brutal attacks by masked men against demonstration leaders.
[01:13:39.839 --> 01:13:44.300]  It appears to be that Tiananmen Square Part 2 has already begun.
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:47.501]  They're already viciously attacking people with the motorcycle police.
[01:13:48.141 --> 01:13:53.045]  Armored vehicles and tanks, wheeled tanks, are rolling in over the bridge.
[01:13:53.045 --> 01:13:59.571]  We have video of that into Hong Kong, triggering a global crisis.
[01:13:59.571 --> 01:14:00.491]  Precisely.
[01:14:00.491 --> 01:14:06.817]  People need to realize this isn't just a hardcore group of protesters who are out protesting routinely.
[01:14:06.817 --> 01:14:08.718]  This is the entire population.
[01:14:08.718 --> 01:14:13.042]  The protests are supported by the clear majority of the Hong Kong population and
[01:14:14.056 --> 01:14:18.484]  Old people, middle class people, it's mainly young people, but it's all across the board.
[01:14:18.484 --> 01:14:20.648]  This isn't just hardcore protesters.
[01:14:20.648 --> 01:14:22.712]  On the Friday night, we were there the first day.
[01:14:23.427 --> 01:14:29.451]  They had a human chain, Alex, which stretched 30 miles around the entire city.
[01:14:29.451 --> 01:14:31.332]  They even went up mountains.
[01:14:31.332 --> 01:14:33.993]  And these were students, quite middle-class students.
[01:14:33.993 --> 01:14:40.357]  In fact, some of them have been shopping for luxury clothing and brought their bags with them, forming this human chain.
[01:14:40.357 --> 01:14:41.818]  So this is widespread.
[01:14:41.818 --> 01:14:42.899]  And Paul, let me stop you.
[01:14:42.899 --> 01:14:43.299]  Let me stop you.
[01:14:43.299 --> 01:14:45.240]  We're going to have to do part of one more segment.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.260]  I'll let you get back to your important work.
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:47.461]  We're going to come back.
[01:14:47.461 --> 01:14:50.283]  I want viewers and listeners to understand something right now as we go to break.
[01:14:51.727 --> 01:14:58.069]  If you look at the political climate, the population, the people that we're dealing with here, it's explosive.
[01:14:58.069 --> 01:15:00.629]  This is not Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
[01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:08.231]  This is not people already trained to be slaves and the university students demanding freedom and being crushed by tens of thousands of troops.
[01:15:08.231 --> 01:15:15.893]  This is a free nation of 70 years with hundreds of years of quasi-freedom before that, and it's going to be explosive.
[01:15:15.893 --> 01:15:17.794]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[01:15:18.891 --> 01:15:29.937]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[01:16:18.211 --> 01:16:20.173]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:16:20.173 --> 01:16:25.477]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:16:25.477 --> 01:16:27.059]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:16:27.059 --> 01:16:35.426]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:17:20.427 --> 01:17:21.628]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[01:17:21.628 --> 01:17:24.991]  I've been so busy, I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[01:17:24.991 --> 01:17:26.232]  But it's very exciting.
[01:17:26.232 --> 01:17:28.554]  It's Super Silver Skin Cream.
[01:17:28.554 --> 01:17:30.075]  It's got all of these benefits.
[01:17:30.075 --> 01:17:31.156]  Too many to mention.
[01:17:31.156 --> 01:17:32.437]  But it's revolutionary.
[01:17:32.437 --> 01:17:33.378]  It's brand new.

[01:19:22.276 --> 01:19:24.917]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:56.014 --> 01:20:01.657]  There's a social engineering program funded by the Chai Com sexualizing your children.
[01:20:01.657 --> 01:20:03.417]  Your borders are being crushed by the UN.
[01:20:03.417 --> 01:20:06.099]  World government's being announced.
[01:20:06.099 --> 01:20:11.841]  The Democratic Party in Hollywood is trying to demoralize the nation and stop our president from winning a trade war with China.
[01:20:11.841 --> 01:20:14.862]  It's really about getting China out of our business.
[01:20:14.862 --> 01:20:24.967]  And now, hundreds and hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles are rolling across the longest bridge in the world from the Chinese Communist mainland
[01:20:26.172 --> 01:20:29.093]  Right in to Hong Kong.
[01:20:29.093 --> 01:20:35.655]  And if you go, at least when I checked during the break, to CNN or ABC News, there's no coverage of it.
[01:20:35.655 --> 01:20:37.816]  You go to DrugsReport.com, there's some links.
[01:20:37.816 --> 01:20:40.257]  You go to Infowars.com, there's some links.
[01:20:40.257 --> 01:20:43.078]  But you'd think that's a bigger deal, you see.
[01:20:43.078 --> 01:20:47.060]  But a lot of our media's been siding with China against Hong Kong.
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:50.521]  And our media's been siding against Trump in the trade war.
[01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:55.413]  All these Hollywood stars are saying China's good and Xi will show us.
[01:20:55.413 --> 01:20:56.674]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[01:20:56.674 --> 01:21:05.461]  But our own Greg Reese was just there days ago, right at the bridge, on the Chinese side, predicting that the invasion would come.
[01:21:05.461 --> 01:21:09.064]  So while Paul's talking, for TV viewers, we'll roll some of that B-roll.
[01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:11.326]  Paul, this is so historic.
[01:21:11.326 --> 01:21:13.168]  This is going to explode.
[01:21:13.168 --> 01:21:14.849]  You were just there, obviously.
[01:21:14.849 --> 01:21:16.630]  What do you expect to unfold next?
[01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:18.212]  Do they think the Chinese show a force?
[01:21:19.172 --> 01:21:21.494]  We'll make the protesters not come out in the streets.
[01:21:21.494 --> 01:21:25.476]  Because from what you've said, the history I've studied, this is not going to go like Tiananmen Square.
[01:21:25.476 --> 01:21:29.659]  It's going to be a lot more people, a lot more sustained, a lot more serious.
[01:21:29.659 --> 01:21:35.123]  And I predict as the violence by the chi-coms escalates, we're going to start seeing reprisals.
[01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:38.445]  Because the word is, there's a lot of illegal weapons in Hong Kong.
[01:21:38.445 --> 01:21:41.327]  And I predict you're going to start seeing some liberator pistols.
[01:21:43.513 --> 01:21:46.136]  Well, we've already seen some fake pistols.
[01:21:46.136 --> 01:21:52.424]  We've already seen live rounds fired into the air by the police to try and back off some of the protesters.
[01:21:52.424 --> 01:21:54.567]  And no, they're not going anywhere.
[01:21:54.567 --> 01:22:01.175]  Literally, to a man, everyone we spoke to said, whatever happens, they're going to be out on the streets until their demands are met.
[01:22:01.175 --> 01:22:02.537]  And to give you an idea, Alex, of
[01:22:02.864 --> 01:22:04.225]  What they're fighting against.
[01:22:04.225 --> 01:22:07.506]  Just look at what the citizens of China have to labour under.
[01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:21.752]  Under their social credit system, which is being introduced in the West, and you were one of the primary first victims of it, Alex, they've already banned 2.5 million people in China from buying plane tickets.
[01:22:21.752 --> 01:22:30.896]  They've banned 90,000 people from buying train tickets in the month of July alone because either they said something bad about the government
[01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:33.883]  Maybe they smoked in a non-smoking area.
[01:22:33.883 --> 01:22:36.767]  Maybe they crossed the road on a red light.
[01:22:36.767 --> 01:22:39.090]  Literally, there's a list where you can be banned.
[01:22:39.090 --> 01:22:41.493]  You can be put on this social credit score list.
[01:22:41.493 --> 01:22:42.414]  Have your score low.
[01:22:43.117 --> 01:22:46.439]  They denied basic commerce, basic services.
[01:22:46.439 --> 01:22:51.741]  They're buying too many video games, buying too much junk food, buying too much alcohol.
[01:22:51.741 --> 01:22:57.885]  This is the complete control over society that the communists have been yearning after for decades and decades.
[01:22:57.885 --> 01:22:59.585]  Now with technology they have it.
[01:22:59.585 --> 01:23:07.089]  They even prevent people in China from going on dating websites if their social credit score is too low.
[01:23:07.089 --> 01:23:08.330]  What do we see in America?
[01:23:08.710 --> 01:23:14.458]  Now we see people being banned from having bank accounts because they have the wrong political opinions.
[01:23:14.458 --> 01:23:18.965]  You were banned from having a PayPal account for having the wrong political opinions.
[01:23:18.965 --> 01:23:19.666]  So the media
[01:23:20.484 --> 01:23:24.207]  As the nerve to try and grandstand and pretend they're on the side of the protesters.
[01:23:24.207 --> 01:23:27.290]  Hillary Clinton tweets about it on the side of the protesters.
[01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:34.437]  Meanwhile, they're lobbying for the exact same social credit score authoritarian system to be introduced in the West.
[01:23:34.437 --> 01:23:36.298]  And that's what really gets me.
[01:23:36.298 --> 01:23:38.280]  The protesters are not going away.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:45.286]  Whatever happens, they're going to be out on the streets come what may, even if China, which we hope it doesn't, invades.
[01:23:45.286 --> 01:23:46.728]  So that's what's going to happen.
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:55.766]  This is literally a giant authoritarian nation with a hundred million standing army.
[01:23:55.766 --> 01:23:56.847]  They've got that many in their reserves.
[01:23:56.847 --> 01:23:58.849]  They've got like five million in their regular military.
[01:23:58.849 --> 01:24:00.010]  Some say ten million.
[01:24:00.010 --> 01:24:05.374]  They've got reserves of a hundred million, obviously, that in some form or way claim they can fight.
[01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:11.179]  They don't have the supplies to do it, but they are the greatest mass murderers in history, killing a hundred plus million of their own people.
[01:24:11.499 --> 01:24:22.471]  And they're now trying to absorb once-free Hong Kong and are already admittedly sending their triads and mafias in to squeeze everybody because that's what the Communist Party is.
[01:24:22.471 --> 01:24:23.952]  This is just amazing.
[01:24:23.952 --> 01:24:29.959]  And I expect to see our media side against Hong Kong and against Trump supporting Hong Kong.
[01:24:31.823 --> 01:24:40.408]  Well, we've already seen many people on the left who are called tankies try and smear these protesters as far right because they're carrying Pepe memes.
[01:24:40.408 --> 01:24:42.229]  They don't know what it means in the West.
[01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:46.592]  The media's demonised this meme as, you know, a white supremacist dog whistle.
[01:24:46.592 --> 01:24:48.874]  They're not carrying signs because of that.
[01:24:48.874 --> 01:24:52.456]  There's not this ridiculous partisan bickering in Hong Kong.
[01:24:52.456 --> 01:24:54.237]  The society is largely united
[01:24:54.617 --> 01:24:56.101]  Behind the protesters.
[01:24:56.101 --> 01:25:02.514]  And again, they're largely united against this migration invasion, which is subverting their society.
[01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:06.021]  There was a quote from one protester there who said quote,
[01:25:06.567 --> 01:25:20.349]  They drain our resources from healthcare to education and are diluting our culture, making it increasingly pro-Beijing, which is what we see happening in the West with this mass migration from the Middle East and North Africa.
[01:25:20.349 --> 01:25:32.651]  So they have many of the same concerns that their society is being subverted, diluted, and the power that they once held is being transferred to China as a result of this mass migration weapon.
[01:25:32.651 --> 01:25:35.972]  That's not far right, that's just being right to stand up against
[01:25:36.417 --> 01:25:40.198]  Again, one of the most fearsome military regimes on the planet.
[01:25:40.198 --> 01:25:41.918]  That does not make you far right.
[01:25:41.918 --> 01:25:43.059]  That just puts you in the right.
[01:25:43.059 --> 01:25:47.860]  That makes you a freedom fighter for liberty, for democracy, and that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.460]  That's who they are.
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:56.522]  Well, we see headlines out of The Guardian going, oh, Chinese troops coming into Hong Kong causes unease.
[01:25:56.522 --> 01:26:02.783]  So we're going to see the left's love affair with Communist China that's all over our news, and I know all over your news.
[01:26:02.783 --> 01:26:04.284]  We're going to see that put to the test.
[01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:05.504]  I wonder how folks are going to feel
[01:26:06.707 --> 01:26:10.070]  When we see bloodied and murdered and run over bodies by tanks.
[01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:16.715]  Because the CHICOMS aren't going to be able to contain this information very, very long once it kicks off, Paul.
[01:26:16.715 --> 01:26:20.759]  Because I predict we're going to see even bigger protest and bigger response.
[01:26:20.759 --> 01:26:23.841]  I know the Hong Kong folks told you that the CHICOMS invaded.
[01:26:23.841 --> 01:26:25.723]  They had something really big planned.
[01:26:25.723 --> 01:26:26.944]  Do you have any idea what that could be?
[01:26:29.605 --> 01:26:34.389]  Well yeah, they've already got a garrison within Hong Kong, they haven't rolled that out yet.
[01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:38.011]  They've rolled it out today, as he said, claiming they were doing manoeuvres.
[01:26:38.011 --> 01:26:40.273]  It's obviously an intimidation tactic.
[01:26:40.273 --> 01:26:47.138]  In fact, they put out a video, the Chinese military, and it's in the video I posted a couple of hours ago, Truth About the Hong Kong Protest.
[01:26:47.694 --> 01:26:51.637]  Well, they're literally training with live rounds to just gun down protesters.
[01:26:51.637 --> 01:26:55.280]  So if you want to know what they may have planned, just watch that video.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:58.282]  But people need to understand, Alex, this is so widespread.
[01:26:58.282 --> 01:27:02.506]  This is not isolated protest in little areas of the city.
[01:27:02.506 --> 01:27:08.811]  Everywhere you go in the city, everywhere, there's graffiti, Democracy Now!, Chi Nazi,
[01:27:09.522 --> 01:27:12.446]  Literally, Chai Nazi is written everywhere around the city.
[01:27:12.446 --> 01:27:19.234]  This is so widespread, this is so supported by the whole population, that it's not just a minor protest movement.
[01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:21.717]  It is basically, at this point, a revolution.
[01:27:23.695 --> 01:27:26.097]  We're going to play your report, Paul, when we come back.
[01:27:26.097 --> 01:27:27.578]  Incredible job.
[01:27:27.578 --> 01:27:30.020]  Look forward to having you back on as you track this.
[01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:36.125]  I know you've spent a lot of time in China and a lot of time previously in that area through some family interest.
[01:27:36.125 --> 01:27:38.387]  And so you're a great reporter.
[01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:41.290]  And you and the rest of the crew had a lot of courage over there.
[01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:43.472]  Amazing footage you got getting right in the middle of it.
[01:27:43.472 --> 01:27:46.454]  We should be praying for the folks in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[01:27:46.454 --> 01:27:50.738]  But bottom line, there are periods in history when a lot of big developments unfold.
[01:27:51.278 --> 01:27:53.780]  They say every century or so, more happens.
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:55.001]  In just a few years, it happens.
[01:27:55.001 --> 01:27:58.303]  In the whole next hundred, we've reached that quickening point right now.
[01:27:58.303 --> 01:28:00.144]  So everybody, strap yourselves in.
[01:28:00.144 --> 01:28:02.326]  We are not in Kansas anymore.
[01:28:02.326 --> 01:28:04.107]  Thank you, Paul Watson.
[01:28:04.107 --> 01:28:05.308]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:28:05.308 --> 01:28:11.452]  All right, when we come back, we're going to finish up with this, and then we're going to move into the news that ties into it.
[01:28:11.452 --> 01:28:15.134]  The Queen of England just suspended Parliament to enforce Brexit.
[01:28:15.134 --> 01:28:15.775]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:19.731]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:19.731 --> 01:28:23.652]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:28:23.652 --> 01:28:25.193]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:28:25.193 --> 01:28:28.155]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:28:28.155 --> 01:28:33.697]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:28:33.697 --> 01:28:34.918]  I can help you, too.
[01:28:34.918 --> 01:28:37.839]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:28:37.839 --> 01:28:40.060]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:44.502]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:28:44.502 --> 01:28:46.803]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:28:48.344 --> 01:28:49.605]  Maybe not today.
[01:28:49.605 --> 01:28:50.885]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:28:50.885 --> 01:28:54.627]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:28:54.627 --> 01:28:55.707]  Forget bunkers.
[01:28:55.707 --> 01:28:57.548]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:28:57.548 --> 01:28:59.249]  You need Survivalist Camps.
[01:28:59.249 --> 01:29:07.052]  The ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid, mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[01:29:07.052 --> 01:29:08.052]  Bold statement?
[01:29:08.052 --> 01:29:09.053]  You bet.

[01:29:25.563 --> 01:29:29.607]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:29:29.607 --> 01:29:31.229]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:29:31.229 --> 01:29:38.336]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[01:29:38.336 --> 01:29:41.500]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:42.521]  It's a form of fascism.
[01:29:43.456 --> 01:29:47.198]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[01:29:47.198 --> 01:29:58.524]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:29:58.524 --> 01:30:10.149]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:11.370]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:30:14.051 --> 01:30:16.092]  You can't watch this, the movie.
[01:30:16.092 --> 01:30:19.875]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:31:25.874 --> 01:31:35.281]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[01:31:35.281 --> 01:31:46.929]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[01:31:46.929 --> 01:31:51.112]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[01:31:52.032 --> 01:31:56.055]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[01:31:56.055 --> 01:32:02.959]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.

[01:32:22.351 --> 01:32:34.835]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:34.835 --> 01:32:46.638]  Alright, you're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:32:46.638 --> 01:32:48.059]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:32:55.014 --> 01:33:08.345]  Completely on the edge of my seat right now with the Chi-Coms, the images of hundreds and hundreds of armored vehicles, wheeled tanks, heavy APCs, and hundreds of thousands of more troops massing.
[01:33:08.345 --> 01:33:13.429]  We were just rolling the footage in the last two segments with Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:33:15.285 --> 01:33:26.933]  We're going to be tracking that throughout the day, and in the fourth hour, we have three of our great intrepid reporters that are going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[01:33:26.933 --> 01:33:39.802]  Gregg Reese, Savannah Hernandez, Becca Wright, and we're probably also going to have another military expert pop in to give his take on where this could go sideways.
[01:33:39.802 --> 01:33:43.205]  Perhaps we should also, for at least one segment, if we can still do it, get
[01:33:44.025 --> 01:33:47.087]  Matt Bracken to give us his take popping in.
[01:33:47.087 --> 01:33:55.652]  I kind of preempted his hour, though it's always informative when he does at least an hour once a week with us because they've gotten back and I wanted them to be able to host an hour of the main show.
[01:33:55.652 --> 01:34:08.180]  But I think Matt can also, if he can still do it, do at least one segment, maybe the last segment with them to give his perspective as an author, researcher, terrorism expert, former Navy SEAL, really respect his opinions and views on that.
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:13.583]  This next issue is so huge that I probably should have opened the show with it.
[01:34:14.838 --> 01:34:15.838]  But the U.N.
[01:34:15.838 --> 01:34:18.239]  officially saying that they want to break the U.S.
[01:34:18.239 --> 01:34:29.664]  border and build refugee centers inside the U.S., and Ilhan Omar reporting it, is the first thing I led with, because that's the attack on Konish, or the continental United States.
[01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:35.826]  And for me, it's not just an oath I've personally taken to defend the republic from each foreign domestic.
[01:34:35.826 --> 01:34:40.928]  When you fought for something for a long time and gone through a lot to defend it, you start to love it even more.
[01:34:41.952 --> 01:34:47.915]  I don't resent anything I've done in this fight, and I don't resent the fact that I've been persecuted for it.
[01:34:47.915 --> 01:34:52.497]  But let me tell you, it makes me not want to lose it that much more, you understand?
[01:34:52.497 --> 01:35:09.404]  And I can feel the spirit of liberty rising, I can feel the human spirit fighting back against this global technocracy, this global mark of the beast, this global Chinese social score that's almost in place, and the 5G going in, and all of this human enslaving tech.
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:12.960]  And my very cells cry out against it.
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:23.722]  Now, let me do the best job I can here, telling you what we haven't hit yet, and what really today's top story, you could say, was going to be.
[01:35:23.722 --> 01:35:37.225]  Because as I do so many times before the show starts, I'm sitting here looking at all this news and I go, is it the Chi-Coms invading Hong Kong that's getting almost no attention?
[01:35:37.225 --> 01:35:38.125]  Is that most important?
[01:35:39.375 --> 01:35:43.656]  Is it the world awakening to the UN running the migrant invasion?
[01:35:43.656 --> 01:35:47.358]  And the left openly calling for the UN to occupy the US?
[01:35:47.358 --> 01:35:49.398]  Is that the top story?
[01:35:49.398 --> 01:35:56.901]  Or is it the Queen of England suspending Parliament for the first time in 400 years?
[01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:10.872]  I have to say that's the top story.
[01:36:10.872 --> 01:36:15.795]  Hong Kong's incredibly important and could trigger a new world war.
[01:36:15.795 --> 01:36:17.837]  And it's going to be a bloody spectacle.
[01:36:17.837 --> 01:36:20.419]  I don't think there's any doubt about that.
[01:36:20.419 --> 01:36:22.580]  The Chi-Coms need to show how tough they are.
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:24.802]  They're in a war with the US, a proxy war.
[01:36:24.802 --> 01:36:28.184]  They want to feast on the wealth of Hong Kong.
[01:36:28.184 --> 01:36:35.269]  Their communist desire for dominance is unmatched in its thirst or what it's engorged in innocent blood.
[01:36:36.533 --> 01:36:39.834]  They have no soul, the Chai Kongs in China.
[01:36:39.834 --> 01:36:45.976]  Human-animal cloning, total experimentation, mass murder of Christians, Buddhists, millions in forced labor camps.
[01:36:45.976 --> 01:36:51.237]  I mean, they are what North Korea wishes it was.
[01:36:51.237 --> 01:37:00.960]  But the Queen of England suspending Parliament for the first time in 400 years.
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:04.641]  This happens to be a 400 perfect number.
[01:37:04.641 --> 01:37:05.662]  That signifies
[01:37:06.738 --> 01:37:09.720]  Like the cutting of a diamond.
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:16.164]  The constellation of resistance of the power structure.
[01:37:16.164 --> 01:37:32.333]  The Axis, if you want to call the globalists the jycoms, and their leftist system, and then the United States, the UK, the Liberty Movement, and how those groups are going to fight.
[01:37:32.333 --> 01:37:33.474]  And the fact that the Queen of England
[01:37:34.974 --> 01:37:43.421]  Trump has weighed in, looking at how the breaks are happening, like in a game of pool or billiards.
[01:37:43.421 --> 01:37:46.123]  If you're over in the UK, we call it billiards.
[01:37:46.123 --> 01:37:48.085]  Tells us a lot.
[01:37:48.085 --> 01:37:58.793]  And you know who in the last two configurations of this sided with the US and with England, and that's the Russians.
[01:37:58.793 --> 01:38:01.796]  And Trump knows that and has been trying to get the Russians to side with us in this.
[01:38:02.677 --> 01:38:19.341]  And the globalists through the Chai Com's been working through our media to say, Trump's a Russian agent, so that in this new world war that's here, that's economic, cultural, and military, that Russia will sit on the sidelines.
[01:38:19.341 --> 01:38:23.842]  And so, exactly what we laid out and what we foresaw is now here.
[01:38:23.842 --> 01:38:26.963]  And just like World War I and World War II,
[01:38:28.786 --> 01:38:30.707]  World War 3 was the Cold War.
[01:38:30.707 --> 01:38:31.747]  This is World War 4.
[01:38:31.747 --> 01:38:33.568]  It has started.
[01:38:33.568 --> 01:38:40.871]  It's a global civil war between nation-states and with the globalist combine.
[01:38:40.871 --> 01:38:47.253]  Now you can say, wait a minute, I thought the globalist combine came out of the Brits and came out of Cecil Rhodes and the whole plan did.
[01:38:47.253 --> 01:38:53.416]  Yes, but there's factions within it and they broke away with the CHICOMS and with the EU.
[01:38:55.106 --> 01:39:02.489]  And these old power splits between Europe and the UK are still the dynamism that runs this.
[01:39:02.489 --> 01:39:09.392]  And Bilderberg was always about trying to get the British Empire to work with the European Empire.
[01:39:09.392 --> 01:39:11.573]  But it's two different distinct groups.
[01:39:11.573 --> 01:39:18.416]  And these old fishers just split wide open, and it's beautiful.
[01:39:18.416 --> 01:39:21.738]  The World Government Project is on the rocks.
[01:39:22.791 --> 01:39:26.412]  And it's breaking right in front of us, and this couldn't be better for humanity.
[01:39:26.412 --> 01:39:33.314]  We don't want one global system, a unipolar dictatorship, with the Chai Koms as the engine of it.
[01:39:33.314 --> 01:39:35.554]  No thank you.
[01:39:35.554 --> 01:39:40.656]  I don't think that's going to be happening now or ever.
[01:39:40.656 --> 01:39:50.018]  And I predict, if we're successful, and I think we will be, that Russia is going to slide into this alliance.
[01:39:51.161 --> 01:39:57.969]  And out of this, we can defeat radical Islam, we can defeat the Chi-Coms, the Hollywood EU group.
[01:39:57.969 --> 01:40:01.774]  And you're like, but wait a minute, the British royal family is super corrupt, there's a bunch of pedophiles in it.
[01:40:01.774 --> 01:40:04.978]  Absolutely, that's well known.
[01:40:04.978 --> 01:40:08.822]  And they're not even British themselves, but they know who's winning.
[01:40:08.822 --> 01:40:10.985]  They sat on the sidelines to the last minute.
[01:40:12.079 --> 01:40:18.965]  And now the Queen just flipped her dictator switch, because the Brits did vote to get out of the Euro.
[01:40:18.965 --> 01:40:29.554]  The Euro's been sabotaging things, trying to sabotage that economy, and so she just dropped the trillion pound bomb on them, and man, this is history.
[01:40:29.554 --> 01:40:37.060]  That's all I gotta say, so I'm gonna do my best when we come back to lay this out, and this is gonna be spectacular.
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:38.401]  These alignments are real.
[01:40:39.735 --> 01:40:42.857]  The world is now in a bipolar structure.
[01:40:42.857 --> 01:40:43.918]  I don't mean that psychologically.
[01:40:43.918 --> 01:40:45.199]  That's what it's called.
[01:40:45.199 --> 01:40:47.641]  Two fronts.
[01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:51.604]  And Russia, as usual, is going to be the wild card right in the middle.
[01:40:51.604 --> 01:40:56.668]  And Russia, I believe, will side with the West in the final equation.
[01:40:56.668 --> 01:41:01.291]  That's why there's been every move made to keep Russia out of this alliance.
[01:41:01.291 --> 01:41:02.932]  We will discuss it when we come back.
[01:41:02.932 --> 01:41:07.235]  But we are now entering the quickening.
[01:41:07.235 --> 01:41:08.816]  And this is an incredible time.
[01:41:09.778 --> 01:41:12.159]  To be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:12.159 --> 01:41:19.940]  And there's been a lot of double-dealing by the globalist UK, a lot of double-dealing by Israel, a lot of double-dealing by our government, because there's double-dealing everywhere.
[01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:24.041]  But the double-dealing is about to come to zero.
[01:41:24.041 --> 01:41:28.062]  And you're going to see people divide into their groups right now.
[01:41:28.062 --> 01:41:35.124]  And all the folks out there that have been sucking up the Hollywood propaganda, the shycom propaganda, you're going to lose.
[01:41:35.124 --> 01:41:36.844]  And I know you're going to commit a lot of crimes.
[01:41:38.339 --> 01:41:42.063]  Because you've been promised you'll be in the power structure if you could just overthrow America.
[01:41:42.063 --> 01:41:44.165]  It's not gonna happen.
[01:41:44.165 --> 01:41:45.666]  You failed.
[01:41:45.666 --> 01:41:51.292]  I can tell you right now, there's no way you win.
[01:41:51.292 --> 01:41:52.152]  You're not meant to win.
[01:41:52.152 --> 01:41:53.954]  You're losers.
[01:41:53.954 --> 01:41:58.478]  You think you can beat the United States and what's left of the British Empire?
[01:41:58.478 --> 01:41:58.799]  Really?
[01:41:58.799 --> 01:41:59.740]  You think you can beat us?
[01:42:01.937 --> 01:42:02.397]  Good luck!
[01:42:02.397 --> 01:42:05.738]  Nobody has and nobody ever will when we're defending ourselves.
[01:42:05.738 --> 01:42:11.000]  And so the CHICOMS and the EU and all of you can piss up a rope.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.522]  Because you're about to get your back broken and your ribs torn out.
[01:42:14.522 --> 01:42:14.882]  Get ready.
[01:42:19.425 --> 01:42:20.626]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[01:42:20.626 --> 01:42:23.987]  I've been so busy I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[01:42:23.987 --> 01:42:25.228]  But it's very exciting.
[01:42:25.228 --> 01:42:27.569]  It's Super Silver Skin Cream.
[01:42:27.569 --> 01:42:29.069]  It's got all of these benefits.
[01:42:29.069 --> 01:42:30.150]  Too many to mention.
[01:42:30.150 --> 01:42:31.430]  But it's revolutionary.
[01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:32.371]  It's brand new.
[01:42:32.371 --> 01:42:33.211]  People are going to love it.
[01:42:33.211 --> 01:42:35.372]  Introducing the new Super Silver Skin Cream.

[01:43:19.048 --> 01:43:21.070]  Robert Morris, what has Big Tech become?
[01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:23.091]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[01:43:23.091 --> 01:43:29.577]  And the way they did so is because they faced no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[01:43:29.577 --> 01:43:41.666]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[01:43:41.666 --> 01:43:44.749]  Otherwise, they will never change, and they will become the Big Tech oligarchs
[01:43:44.929 --> 01:43:46.950]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[01:44:14.839 --> 01:44:16.788]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[01:44:16.788 --> 01:44:18.034]  Even it is what you just saw.
[01:44:21.494 --> 01:44:26.096]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.
[01:44:26.096 --> 01:44:33.839]  That's why we created the 8-Pack Power Stack, your go-to option for the building blocks of a successful approach to supplementation.

[01:45:07.163 --> 01:45:12.224]  You can find what you like and get even more powerful versions in the store.

[01:45:20.194 --> 01:45:36.882]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks in to people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[01:45:36.882 --> 01:45:40.983]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll shut us down.
[01:45:40.983 --> 01:45:44.285]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[01:45:44.645 --> 01:45:46.406]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[01:45:46.406 --> 01:45:50.648]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[01:45:50.648 --> 01:45:58.591]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been to the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[01:45:58.591 --> 01:46:01.293]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[01:46:01.293 --> 01:46:06.195]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[01:46:06.195 --> 01:46:07.396]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[01:46:07.396 --> 01:46:08.216]  They have side effects.
[01:46:08.376 --> 01:46:12.961]  Not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[01:46:12.961 --> 01:46:13.942]  Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:13.942 --> 01:46:15.844]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:44.994 --> 01:46:53.959]  The show has been called the masterstroke by the UK's new prime minister, his top advisor, Nigel Farage.
[01:46:53.959 --> 01:46:57.502]  See how far the liberty movement has come?
[01:46:57.502 --> 01:47:01.264]  The UK was supposed to end, be merged into a world government, but the people didn't want it.
[01:47:02.631 --> 01:47:16.105]  And so now ultranationalists are in control of the UK and the one-sided EU deal where they're flooded with illegal aliens and where the country's broken down and where they have all these horrible deals on trade.
[01:47:16.105 --> 01:47:19.729]  That's all coming to an end and now the UK can negotiate
[01:47:21.212 --> 01:47:25.677]  With the euro and absolutely wreck the euro if they want to.
[01:47:25.677 --> 01:47:33.787]  But the euro was designed, as the founders of it said, to kill nation states, including Europeans countries and flood them as well.
[01:47:33.787 --> 01:47:37.892]  So again, the United States and the UK are coming to save Europe.
[01:47:38.673 --> 01:47:39.894]  From itself.
[01:47:39.894 --> 01:47:41.475]  I'm not putting Europe down.
[01:47:41.475 --> 01:47:43.216]  It's just a fact.
[01:47:43.216 --> 01:47:45.138]  And history doesn't rhyme.
[01:47:45.138 --> 01:47:47.159]  It repeats, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:47.159 --> 01:47:48.900]  You always hear that it rhymes.
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:50.201]  No, it repeats.
[01:47:50.201 --> 01:47:52.143]  Now, let's continue.
[01:47:52.143 --> 01:47:53.664]  Off with her head.
[01:47:53.664 --> 01:47:57.646]  This is a real quote in the British newspapers.
[01:47:57.646 --> 01:48:05.152]  Soros-funded Best for Britain group threatens Queen over Brexit and says last time a king
[01:48:07.395 --> 01:48:15.860]  Actually quote it, suspended Parliament, they cut off his head.
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:24.945]  Now people got to ask, are you going to side with the Queen of England or are you going to side with the Rothschilds that are also based there that run Soros?
[01:48:27.509 --> 01:48:29.651]  Who, by the way, want to overthrow Israel.
[01:48:29.651 --> 01:48:38.998]  All these idiotic anti-Jew, white supremacists go online and they call here and they say, oh, you're not against Israel, you're a traitor.
[01:48:38.998 --> 01:48:41.840]  Israel's a bunch of factions, you dumbasses!
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:47.604]  Just like the United States or Russia or anybody else that's got free political parties.
[01:48:47.604 --> 01:48:48.545]  Everybody wants control.
[01:48:49.991 --> 01:48:51.512]  I happen to know the real power structure.
[01:48:51.512 --> 01:48:52.412]  I've studied it.
[01:48:52.412 --> 01:48:54.473]  I actually want to know who the players are, see?
[01:48:54.473 --> 01:49:01.335]  I don't want to just spout off how smart I am because I can list how many Jews have powerful jobs all day.
[01:49:01.335 --> 01:49:05.277]  It has nothing to do with it.
[01:49:05.277 --> 01:49:08.738]  And the Rothschilds funded Hitler early on, but later didn't.
[01:49:08.738 --> 01:49:13.420]  They helped fund World War I. Opportunists.
[01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:15.741]  And now they're trying to stop Brexit.
[01:49:16.786 --> 01:49:17.887]  The powerful Rothschilds.
[01:49:17.887 --> 01:49:20.649]  There's diversity in that family as well, of opinions.
[01:49:20.649 --> 01:49:24.512]  And it's on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:24.512 --> 01:49:27.315]  And you've got 400 years.
[01:49:27.315 --> 01:49:31.358]  Well, the Parliament is still trying to scuttle the vote of the people.
[01:49:31.358 --> 01:49:33.500]  And for four years, they've been trying to stop it.
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:39.345]  So the Queen of England knows that real polls show up to 70% of people in the UK want out now.
[01:49:40.632 --> 01:49:42.354]  It's just like our fake polls.
[01:49:42.354 --> 01:49:45.056]  The fake polls show 55-60% won out.
[01:49:45.056 --> 01:49:46.257]  Well, they already voted to do it.
[01:49:46.257 --> 01:50:00.089]  So she says, I'm suspending Parliament for five weeks so that the government can really negotiate a deal with the EU that actually gives us the power to vote on our sovereignty because 93% of UK laws
[01:50:02.421 --> 01:50:05.145]  Are set and controlled by the EU.
[01:50:05.145 --> 01:50:06.086]  And it just hit me.
[01:50:06.086 --> 01:50:07.748]  We've got to get Lord Monckton on.
[01:50:07.748 --> 01:50:09.691]  He was Chief Advisor to Margaret Thatcher.
[01:50:09.691 --> 01:50:11.873]  He is at the heart of this resistance.
[01:50:11.873 --> 01:50:15.118]  He'll give us all the inside baseball as if we don't already know it.
[01:50:15.118 --> 01:50:20.345]  Please get Lord Monckton on today or tomorrow, Daria and crew, as soon as you can.
[01:50:21.696 --> 01:50:28.244]  So, I mean, I'm about to read you the quotes here, but they threaten to cut the Queen of England's head off.
[01:50:28.244 --> 01:50:31.308]  They say, oh, the last king did that, we cut his head off.
[01:50:31.308 --> 01:50:34.192]  Now, I'm all for parliaments, folks, and I'm all for votes.
[01:50:34.192 --> 01:50:40.240]  And back when the Queen suspended the Canadian parliament a decade ago, I said, this is so she's still in command.
[01:50:41.766 --> 01:50:43.827]  To a great extent, she has that veto power.
[01:50:43.827 --> 01:50:47.330]  But this time, she's in the right because they voted to get out.
[01:50:47.330 --> 01:50:51.333]  The government, for almost four years, wouldn't let them do it.
[01:50:51.333 --> 01:50:57.417]  They couldn't get their vote again in the last two years to stay in it.
[01:50:57.417 --> 01:51:01.520]  And so she says, follow what the people voted in a referendum.
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:07.304]  You're not giving the people what they want, so I'm exercising my veto over your undemocratic behavior.
[01:51:08.024 --> 01:51:24.209]  And so the Saxe-Koburg Transylvanian Queen knows which way the wind is blowing and can see that Trump and America and the Nationalists and the Populists and the resurgence of the Christian movements worldwide are winning.
[01:51:24.209 --> 01:51:26.730]  She sat on the sidelines while all this happened.
[01:51:28.171 --> 01:51:34.595]  And while the UK got sucked down a black hole, and now she's coming in like the Deus Ex.
[01:51:34.595 --> 01:51:43.081]  The Deus Ex is the hero that comes in at the last moment when the main hero is going to lose, but the Deus Ex saves him right at the minute.
[01:51:43.763 --> 01:51:47.526]  You know, he's the second king, he's the little hero.
[01:51:47.526 --> 01:51:57.415]  Han Solo, when Darth Vader is about to kill Luke Skywalker in Episode 4, right when he's about to blow the Death Star up, Darth Vader says, I have you now.
[01:51:57.415 --> 01:52:05.021]  Well, the due sex is Han Solo comes in and stops him from killing Luke Skywalker and the Death Star gets blown up.
[01:52:05.902 --> 01:52:10.604]  Queen Elizabeth, with this action, has now become the Han Solo due sex at the moment.
[01:52:10.604 --> 01:52:12.485]  And I'm not lionizing her.
[01:52:12.485 --> 01:52:13.845]  I don't like royalty.
[01:52:13.845 --> 01:52:15.366]  I don't like what they've done.
[01:52:15.366 --> 01:52:17.087]  House of Windsor is a fake name.
[01:52:17.087 --> 01:52:18.107]  They're not even Brits.
[01:52:18.107 --> 01:52:19.208]  They're not Scots.
[01:52:19.208 --> 01:52:21.068]  They're not Irish, okay?
[01:52:21.068 --> 01:52:24.510]  They removed, their ancestors removed the old line of kings.
[01:52:24.510 --> 01:52:29.272]  They removed the Norse kings that took over in 1100, William the Conqueror.
[01:52:29.272 --> 01:52:31.973]  So there's nothing British about them.
[01:52:31.973 --> 01:52:34.674]  But they know how the cookie crumbles.
[01:52:36.127 --> 01:52:44.851]  They know how to cut this diamond, and they know that America is winning, and so they understand now what they've got to do.
[01:52:44.851 --> 01:52:52.275]  This is big, big, big, big, big, big, big.
[01:52:52.275 --> 01:52:59.338]  And it shows that the power alliances are lining up just like they did right before World War II.
[01:53:00.896 --> 01:53:15.601]  The only question is, can the CHICOM stay behind and the leftists start a war with Russia, which Obama tried to do, starting a war, by trying to take the Russian half of Ukraine that Russia's had since they founded Ukraine 500 years ago.
[01:53:15.601 --> 01:53:18.602]  Russia was founded in Ukraine 500 years ago.
[01:53:18.602 --> 01:53:19.722]  Look it up.
[01:53:19.722 --> 01:53:21.643]  What's modern Russia?
[01:53:21.643 --> 01:53:24.644]  That modern czarist system that got removed in 1917.
[01:53:26.557 --> 01:53:32.519]  And it'd be like taking New York City, you know, if the Chinese came and took New York City.
[01:53:32.519 --> 01:53:37.421]  That's what Obama did, trying to get the Russians to go ape you-know-what.
[01:53:37.421 --> 01:53:38.501]  And it didn't happen.
[01:53:38.501 --> 01:53:40.842]  Putin cut their military funding.
[01:53:40.842 --> 01:53:42.603]  He said, I'm not going to play that game.
[01:53:42.603 --> 01:53:44.143]  And he's a sovereign leader.
[01:53:44.143 --> 01:53:45.584]  And he's kicked the globalists out.
[01:53:45.584 --> 01:53:47.945]  And they're not teaching five-year-olds how to put trusses on in Russia.
[01:53:49.278 --> 01:53:54.281]  And they've thrown George Soros' ass, and his companies, and his foundations out of Russia!
[01:53:54.281 --> 01:53:57.963]  Because they're foreign, alien, criminal groups.
[01:53:57.963 --> 01:53:59.804]  Like Media Matters, and all the rest of it.
[01:53:59.804 --> 01:54:01.945]  And they're getting their asses kicked.
[01:54:01.945 --> 01:54:05.767]  So I hope you all enjoy it, dirtbags.
[01:54:05.767 --> 01:54:07.708]  But we need Russia in the alliance.
[01:54:07.708 --> 01:54:12.210]  I know we've been taught in the post-World War II era to hate Russia.
[01:54:12.210 --> 01:54:15.692]  Russia was captured by the same globalists that have tried to capture us.
[01:54:15.692 --> 01:54:17.513]  Russia pulled the face sucker off.
[01:54:19.850 --> 01:54:21.991]  We should be celebrating that.
[01:54:21.991 --> 01:54:26.394]  We should be happy for Russia trying to increase its birth rate and trying to keep its culture.
[01:54:26.394 --> 01:54:27.915]  We need to be that way.
[01:54:27.915 --> 01:54:31.797]  The culture of Americana that unifies us all and a Christian ethos.
[01:54:31.797 --> 01:54:35.799]  Whether you believe in God or not, the Christian ethos builds good societies.
[01:54:35.799 --> 01:54:41.603]  I'll take that over the leftist, godless ethos of child molestation and their sacrament.
[01:54:43.234 --> 01:54:44.055]  Off with their heads!
[01:54:44.055 --> 01:54:47.420]  Soros-funded Best for Britain group threatens Queen over Brexit.
[01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:58.814]  The EU loyalist Best for Britain group appeared to invoke the fate of beheaded King Charles I for Queen Elizabeth II, agreed to prologue, temporarily suspend Parliament for a few weeks before the Brexit deadline.
[01:54:59.415 --> 01:55:09.877]  Following news, the Queen, Robert Stamper Minister Boris Johnson's request to suspend the parliamentary session, the longest running for almost 400 years, so the government can bring forward a new legislation program.
[01:55:09.877 --> 01:55:22.720]  October 14th, the Soros-funded group tweeted that it would make no sense for the Queen to back this deeply undemocratic, unconstitutional, and fundamentally political maneuver from the government.
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:24.660]  They went on to say if the Queen is asked to help,
[01:55:25.925 --> 01:55:27.946]  Let's just pull back from that.
[01:55:27.946 --> 01:55:31.307]  Yeah, but we're not facing Oliver Cromwell or anybody like that at this point.
[01:55:31.307 --> 01:55:33.868]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Lord High Protector and all the rest of it,
[01:55:55.796 --> 01:56:02.118]  You have to understand that the Brits voted to leave.
[01:56:02.118 --> 01:56:04.618]  The people in the UK voted to leave the unelected EU.
[01:56:04.618 --> 01:56:06.239]  They never voted to enter it.
[01:56:06.239 --> 01:56:08.880]  It's like China trying to take over Hong Kong.
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:10.880]  The Chinese communists were never elected.
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:13.001]  The people ran 70 years ago.
[01:56:13.001 --> 01:56:17.162]  They created the most successful per square mile place in the world.
[01:56:18.015 --> 01:56:19.115]  Hong Kong.
[01:56:19.115 --> 01:56:20.956]  The most expensive real estate, everything.
[01:56:20.956 --> 01:56:22.356]  Incredible wealth.
[01:56:22.356 --> 01:56:27.337]  The average person there is... But now you see, they're standing up.
[01:56:27.337 --> 01:56:33.058]  And so history is repeating itself over and over and over again.
[01:56:33.058 --> 01:56:39.580]  And then Soros has the nerve to say, you are the one killing people's, quote, democracy.
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:42.381]  It's outrageous.
[01:56:42.381 --> 01:56:43.441]  The British Royals
[01:56:44.457 --> 01:56:59.548]  The House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha has clearly aligned itself with Trump and America and has chosen wisely.
[01:56:59.548 --> 01:57:02.010]  Things are going very well.
[01:57:02.010 --> 01:57:03.811]  But the enemy is going to strike back.
[01:57:03.811 --> 01:57:05.612]  We'll talk about how when we return.
[01:57:05.612 --> 01:57:06.153]  Stay with us.
[01:57:08.154 --> 01:57:12.337]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[01:57:12.337 --> 01:57:13.397]  They are technocrats.
[01:57:13.397 --> 01:57:15.679]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:57:15.679 --> 01:57:23.043]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:57:23.043 --> 01:57:24.924]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:57:24.924 --> 01:57:27.006]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:57:27.526 --> 01:57:33.870]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:39.053]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4WheelsLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:57:39.053 --> 01:57:48.079]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality, and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:57:49.039 --> 01:57:55.023]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[01:57:55.023 --> 01:57:55.964]  It is amazing.
[01:57:55.964 --> 01:58:10.354]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the Second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:10.354 --> 01:58:16.879]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[01:58:17.728 --> 01:58:22.018]  This is a digital, AI-enforced, gag order.
[01:58:22.018 --> 01:58:25.727]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or Infowars.com.
[01:58:31.397 --> 01:58:33.098]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[01:58:33.098 --> 01:58:34.319]  This is racketeering.
[01:58:34.319 --> 01:58:35.439]  This is cartels.
[01:58:35.439 --> 01:58:37.841]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[01:58:37.841 --> 01:58:39.722]  We need it now.
[01:58:39.722 --> 01:58:41.423]  You can take on Big Ten.
[01:58:41.423 --> 01:58:50.368]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[01:58:50.368 --> 01:58:58.392]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[01:58:58.392 --> 01:58:59.273]  The way to fight back
[01:58:59.853 --> 01:59:01.355]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:59:30.954 --> 01:59:39.778]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:39.778 --> 01:59:45.340]  Okay, we have a surprise guest joining us for two seconds, and then I'll dive into all of the news after that.
[01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:49.782]  But we're in a historical period, a major power flux.
[01:59:49.782 --> 01:59:58.266]  The corporate global government plan of globalism gave untold fiat wealth to megacorporations.
[01:59:59.676 --> 02:00:01.508]  And then they allied themselves with Communist China.
[02:00:01.508 --> 02:00:02.896]  There was an agreement.
[02:00:03.991 --> 02:00:07.252]  The China would control the economics and the manufacturing.
[02:00:07.252 --> 02:00:11.373]  The banks would control the finance and the digital currencies.
[02:00:11.373 --> 02:00:17.295]  The United States and Europe would control the military in an alliance.
[02:00:17.295 --> 02:00:23.237]  Of course, all these different power groups didn't follow the agreement except for the United States.
[02:00:23.237 --> 02:00:25.778]  And the UK did to a certain extent.
[02:00:25.778 --> 02:00:28.618]  And were absolutely cheated and set up.
[02:00:28.618 --> 02:00:30.399]  Now all those agreements are being broken.
[02:00:31.923 --> 02:00:36.707]  The United States is exercising its power over Europe and over the CHICOMS.
[02:00:36.707 --> 02:00:40.830]  Russia is trying to stay out of it wisely.
[02:00:40.830 --> 02:00:50.317]  The Queen of England has now joined with the United States and the West and is trying to get a clean Brexit in place.
[02:00:50.317 --> 02:00:54.340]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:55.741]  We are winning.
[02:00:55.741 --> 02:01:00.284]  Now, we're still being culturally rotted out from the inside.
[02:01:00.284 --> 02:01:00.805]  We are still
[02:01:02.089 --> 02:01:05.596]  Uh, seeing the establishment try to crash the economy.
[02:01:05.596 --> 02:01:07.139]  They can still try to assassinate Trump.
[02:01:07.139 --> 02:01:08.742]  That would only backfire.
[02:01:08.742 --> 02:01:09.924]  Look at all the angles on that.
[02:01:11.297 --> 02:01:15.759]  But they are going to just keep putting out disinfo and propaganda as long as they can.
[02:01:15.759 --> 02:01:18.880]  And there's a lot of other ways that they're going to try to strike back.
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:24.583]  And so on tomorrow's show, I'm going to get more into the real transhumanist threat, which we've still got to face.
[02:01:24.583 --> 02:01:29.325]  Because just because the global model for global government's in trouble, doesn't mean these organizations still aren't there.
[02:01:29.325 --> 02:01:34.347]  They're not still moving forward and trying to reconstitute their operations.
[02:01:34.347 --> 02:01:37.148]  Through big tech that is forming the real global government,
[02:01:37.728 --> 02:01:47.672]  With the Casual Society, with the surveillance, with the censorship in live time using AI and its human collaborators.
[02:01:47.672 --> 02:01:49.873]  We'll be talking about that some next segment.
[02:01:49.873 --> 02:01:55.695]  But there's more than one way, as I say, to skin a wabbit or skin a cat.
[02:01:55.695 --> 02:02:00.998]  And that is to cut off the infrastructure of Google and Facebook and Twitter.
[02:02:01.906 --> 02:02:09.547]  To pull government contracts and not allow them to be used at government installations because they've been compromised by foreign powers, particularly Apple and Google.
[02:02:09.547 --> 02:02:13.248]  And to do things like the Justice Department just did.
[02:02:13.248 --> 02:02:21.389]  We had callers talk about this yesterday, how we need to treat Apple and Google like Huawei, which is really an organ of the Chinese Communist government.
[02:02:21.389 --> 02:02:23.010]  And this is now out from Bloomberg.
[02:02:23.010 --> 02:02:29.491]  Justice Department opposes Google's undersea cable from China and is not allowing them to connect it to the U.S.
[02:02:29.491 --> 02:02:31.071]  mainland or to Hong Kong.
[02:02:32.734 --> 02:02:33.694]  So there you go.
[02:02:33.694 --> 02:02:37.576]  The plot is thickening.
[02:02:37.576 --> 02:02:40.898]  Oh, Parliament suspended for working against the referendum of the people.
[02:02:40.898 --> 02:02:41.678]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:02:41.678 --> 02:02:45.040]  Oh, Kashmir just got invaded by the Indians.
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:46.240]  It's their land anyways.
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:49.962]  They're not going to submit anymore and have the Hindus ordered out of their own country.
[02:02:49.962 --> 02:02:50.442]  Oh, sorry.
[02:02:53.326 --> 02:02:56.371]  Move after move after move after move.
[02:02:56.371 --> 02:03:00.437]  You see Russia telling neocon US senators, you're not welcome here.
[02:03:00.437 --> 02:03:06.065]  And Israel telling all the Islamists in our Congress, you're not welcome here, to come here and try to overthrow.
[02:03:06.065 --> 02:03:07.827]  I mean, people are fighting back.
[02:03:08.843 --> 02:03:10.284]  Also, this is huge.
[02:03:10.284 --> 02:03:16.230]  Trump administration to create special Office of Transparency to expedite release of DOJ documents.
[02:03:16.230 --> 02:03:19.253]  Unfortunately, they're not charging Comey at this time.
[02:03:19.253 --> 02:03:23.377]  Just like we see Barr saying, oh, there's no foul play with Epstein.
[02:03:23.377 --> 02:03:29.062]  He's there to clean stuff up and have an alliance in the government and try to stop the civil war in the government.
[02:03:29.062 --> 02:03:30.423]  But the left isn't stopping.
[02:03:31.684 --> 02:03:35.185]  I'd love them to stop and we can make America great again and fix the country and move on.
[02:03:35.185 --> 02:03:37.246]  I don't want to just piddly around and fight them all day.
[02:03:37.246 --> 02:03:39.686]  I want them to go away with their stolen money.
[02:03:39.686 --> 02:03:41.047]  But they're not.
[02:03:41.047 --> 02:03:44.868]  Just like Napoleon got put on an island and he came back and formed his army again.
[02:03:44.868 --> 02:03:48.789]  Finally he wasn't given, you know, a hundred troops and his generals to reconstitute.
[02:03:49.429 --> 02:03:51.570]  Oh, you can have your generals pretend to be a king.
[02:03:51.570 --> 02:03:54.711]  He used them to launch another giant war.
[02:03:54.711 --> 02:03:57.992]  Got his ass handed to him, finally, by Lord Wellington.
[02:03:57.992 --> 02:04:00.213]  And we're right back at that point again.
[02:04:00.213 --> 02:04:03.155]  We're gonna have to indict these people and lock them up for espionage.
[02:04:03.155 --> 02:04:05.335]  They're not gonna stop, okay?
[02:04:05.335 --> 02:04:06.416]  We've got all the evidence.
[02:04:06.416 --> 02:04:08.197]  It's not gonna hurt the stock market.
[02:04:08.197 --> 02:04:08.937]  It's the right thing to do.
[02:04:08.937 --> 02:04:10.658]  They're the ones trying to overthrow the country.
[02:04:10.658 --> 02:04:13.279]  So we gotta move against them like Benedict Arnold.
[02:04:13.279 --> 02:04:16.120]  Indict them, lock their ass up, throw away the key.
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:16.700]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:17.879 --> 02:04:20.841]  One half of the incredible 8-pack Power Stack, the A.M.
[02:04:20.841 --> 02:04:24.483]  Wake Up and Work Packet is exactly what you need to start your day right.
[02:04:24.483 --> 02:04:34.328]  The pack contains five original formulas built to fuel your day and take care of your body's individual needs in the morning, targeting the heart, brain, muscles, energy production and more.
[02:04:34.328 --> 02:04:34.908]  Each A.M.
[02:04:34.908 --> 02:04:41.292]  pack contains a flex and joint support, energy kickstart, krill oil, nootropic brain and greens detox formula.
[02:04:42.092 --> 02:04:42.893]  With the P.M.
[02:04:42.893 --> 02:04:47.596]  Pack and the 8 Pack Power Stack, you can rest easy and simplify your routine.
[02:04:47.596 --> 02:04:50.217]  Containing four original formulas, the P.M.
[02:04:50.217 --> 02:04:56.661]  Rest and Recover Pack will build up your body's defenses and help you get restful, satisfying sleep every night.
[02:04:56.661 --> 02:05:01.524]  Containing bone support, krill oil, sound sleep, and immune support formulas, the P.M.
[02:05:01.524 --> 02:05:07.408]  Packet was created to support improving your body's bones and immune system, all while you rest from the day's work.
[02:05:07.648 --> 02:05:21.473]  When combined with the AM wake-up and work packet, it makes the 8-pack power stack the new can't-miss InfoWars life product.
[02:05:21.473 --> 02:05:24.313]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[02:05:24.313 --> 02:05:25.434]  Let me think, just let me think!
[02:05:25.434 --> 02:05:31.016]  I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will still be on their way.
[02:05:31.016 --> 02:05:31.796]  It's Chancellor Settler.
[02:05:34.122 --> 02:05:40.747]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[02:05:40.747 --> 02:05:43.890]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[02:05:46.487 --> 02:05:51.512]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[02:05:51.512 --> 02:05:52.553]  You designed it, sir.
[02:05:52.553 --> 02:05:53.494]  You wanted it foolproof.
[02:05:53.494 --> 02:05:55.135]  You told me every television in London!
[02:05:55.135 --> 02:05:57.257]  Cruelty and injustice.
[02:05:57.257 --> 02:05:59.039]  Intolerance and oppression.
[02:05:59.039 --> 02:06:08.567]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and surveilling your submachines.
[02:06:08.567 --> 02:06:08.868]  Cameras.
[02:06:08.868 --> 02:06:09.888]  We need cameras.
[02:06:09.888 --> 02:06:11.330]  How did this happen?
[02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:12.090]  Who's to blame?
[02:06:13.072 --> 02:06:15.757]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[02:06:15.757 --> 02:06:17.661]  They will be held accountable.
[02:06:17.661 --> 02:06:23.533]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[02:06:24.739 --> 02:06:26.720]  I know why you did it.
[02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:27.800]  I know you were afraid.
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:29.921]  Who wouldn't be?
[02:06:29.921 --> 02:06:30.201]  War?
[02:06:30.201 --> 02:06:30.841]  Terror?
[02:06:30.841 --> 02:06:32.141]  Disease?
[02:06:32.141 --> 02:06:38.603]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[02:06:38.603 --> 02:06:44.985]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[02:06:44.985 --> 02:06:51.147]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:06:57.847 --> 02:06:59.548]  There is a war.
[02:06:59.548 --> 02:07:01.268]  It's happening now.
[02:07:01.268 --> 02:07:03.769]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:07:03.769 --> 02:07:06.390]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:08.271]  We are the resistance.
[02:07:08.271 --> 02:07:15.433]  We are the Infowar.
[02:07:15.433 --> 02:07:17.674]  Howdy, folks!
[02:07:17.674 --> 02:07:19.814]  I'm here to tell you all about Murph's d***.
[02:07:19.814 --> 02:07:23.556]  You see, Facebook won't let us use the word d*** in any advertisements.
[02:07:23.556 --> 02:07:27.117]  They also won't let us show d***, shotgun d***, or d***.
[02:07:29.076 --> 02:07:30.117]  Hippies!
[02:07:30.117 --> 02:07:34.920]  Here at Murph's We got tons of stuff for all your outdoor and self-protection needs.
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:44.145]  So much so, that this is one of the only camera angles in the store that we can show you without violating Facebook's rules.
[02:07:44.145 --> 02:07:45.866]  We got it all!
[02:07:45.866 --> 02:07:49.488]  And in real life, none of the stuff in the store is covered up or blurry.
[02:07:49.488 --> 02:07:50.869]  We got a great selection of
[02:07:59.381 --> 02:08:14.535]  So, whether you're trying to stock up for a great pheasant, whitetail, or turkey trip, or you're just trying to exercise your Second Amendment right to protect your family and own a r***** or s*****, come on down to Merv's s*****, where you'll get the most bang for your buck!
[02:08:29.380 --> 02:08:33.421]  I've got to!
[02:08:33.421 --> 02:08:39.082]  He never gives up.
[02:08:39.082 --> 02:08:46.164]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[02:08:46.164 --> 02:08:49.565]  Well, Cale Murphree is our guest at MurphsGuns.com.
[02:08:49.565 --> 02:08:50.405]  We aired this
[02:08:51.566 --> 02:09:06.613]  Earlier in the week, I had it posted at NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com over the weekend, and I said, I gotta find out who this little gun shop in a medium-sized city of Oklahoma is, because they did a super good commercial, much better than you see on national television.
[02:09:06.613 --> 02:09:13.437]  It turned out it's a real gun shop, popular all over the country, not a sponsor of ours, wish they were, Murph's Guns.
[02:09:13.437 --> 02:09:17.759]  And Cale is the third generation owner of Murph's Guns in Duncan, Oklahoma.
[02:09:18.359 --> 02:09:20.720]  He's buying the store from his father and uncle.
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:24.841]  In 2013, Cale has been working hard to grow the online presence and recognition of his gun store.
[02:09:24.841 --> 02:09:27.022]  And I said he did a damn good job here.
[02:09:27.022 --> 02:09:28.923]  I ought to hire him to do our marketing.
[02:09:28.923 --> 02:09:31.924]  But the big story is how they got censored.
[02:09:31.924 --> 02:09:35.425]  Now you can't say the word gun or shotgun or handgun or ammo.
[02:09:35.425 --> 02:09:40.907]  And again, with AI watching it now, Facebook's saying, you won't be able to text it just like my name.
[02:09:40.907 --> 02:09:42.648]  First, they said you can't say Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[02:09:43.228 --> 02:09:46.432]  You try to use the WhatsApp, they're blocking talk of guns.
[02:09:46.432 --> 02:09:48.494]  So this is, Congress has got to act.
[02:09:48.494 --> 02:09:50.416]  I mean, these things are bigger than utilities.
[02:09:50.416 --> 02:09:56.342]  Imagine if AT&T said, we've got AI listening to your phone, and if you say the wrong word, we're going to cut in on it.
[02:09:56.342 --> 02:09:58.204]  Well, Facebook's doing that.
[02:09:58.204 --> 02:10:00.167]  I was just warning of this three months ago.
[02:10:00.167 --> 02:10:00.867]  Now they're doing it.
[02:10:00.867 --> 02:10:01.708]  Remember CNN said,
[02:10:02.429 --> 02:10:06.351]  Well, Jones, you can't say his name on Facebook unless it's negative.
[02:10:06.351 --> 02:10:08.272]  And if you do say it positive, you'll be banned.
[02:10:08.272 --> 02:10:12.694]  But they said, we're also looking to see if people are talking about him on WhatsApp.
[02:10:12.694 --> 02:10:14.035]  That's private messengers.
[02:10:14.035 --> 02:10:16.396]  And they said, yes, we're watching you there.
[02:10:16.396 --> 02:10:19.918]  So this is beyond what the Chai comms are even doing.
[02:10:20.678 --> 02:10:24.001]  So, Cale, thanks for coming on with us and thanks for fighting back.
[02:10:24.001 --> 02:10:25.722]  You know, Dick's Sporting Goods.
[02:10:25.722 --> 02:10:28.684]  I mean, Dick really goes by his name here, doesn't he?
[02:10:28.684 --> 02:10:33.387]  Nothing against people that have the name Richard, but Dick's is saying they're anti-gun, they're going to pull guns out.
[02:10:33.387 --> 02:10:33.827]  Period.
[02:10:33.827 --> 02:10:36.469]  That is, I think, building towards confiscation.
[02:10:36.469 --> 02:10:39.071]  So, I'm glad you are fighting back, my friend.
[02:10:39.071 --> 02:10:41.553]  Hi, Alex.
[02:10:41.553 --> 02:10:42.834]  Thanks for having me.
[02:10:42.834 --> 02:10:45.135]  Thanks for having time to join us.
[02:10:45.135 --> 02:10:47.317]  So, tell us what happened to you and why you did this.
[02:10:49.056 --> 02:10:52.438]  Well, a friend of mine and I were having breakfast one morning.
[02:10:52.438 --> 02:11:09.430]  I was kind of telling him how hard it was to advertise on Facebook with this brilliant idea about, you know, what if we said everything that Facebook won't allow us to say, but we censored it?
[02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:14.294]  And so he came up with this great idea to make this oblique
[02:11:15.407 --> 02:11:19.812]  Where every time it says guns, shotguns, rifles, pistols, it's blurred.
[02:11:19.812 --> 02:11:23.416]  Hey Merv, man, I really want to get you on, but we're going to reconnect on your Skype.
[02:11:23.416 --> 02:11:24.958]  We're having a Skype problem here.
[02:11:24.958 --> 02:11:28.521]  Hell, you just might have to fly down here to Austin or drive down here and be in studio with us.
[02:11:28.521 --> 02:11:30.283]  But again, we love what you're doing over there.
[02:11:30.283 --> 02:11:34.068]  We're going to work on that here for just a minute and get back with you, because we are a radio show.
[02:11:34.807 --> 02:11:36.829]  Well, you are pretty.
[02:11:36.829 --> 02:11:48.180]  Seriously, folks, this shows the level we've gotten to where last week the Republican Party put out just a color online brochure that said we want strong women to join the Trump campaign.
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:57.630]  If you believe in America and women empowered and America and having women at the corporate leadership level, Donald Trump's lost a leadership council to get women into even more.
[02:11:58.150 --> 02:12:05.038]  He's put more women in leadership positions than the last two presidents combined and he wants to have you join his campaign.
[02:12:05.038 --> 02:12:08.481]  And they said you are not allowed.
[02:12:08.481 --> 02:12:10.283]  Period.
[02:12:10.283 --> 02:12:16.189]  You are not allowed to say strong women because somebody might not be a woman.
[02:12:16.189 --> 02:12:17.090]  That's misgendering.
[02:12:17.844 --> 02:12:18.645]  You know, that doesn't make sense.
[02:12:18.645 --> 02:12:19.605]  It makes perfect sense.
[02:12:19.605 --> 02:12:22.547]  If you can sabotage the very language you totally control.
[02:12:22.547 --> 02:12:27.531]  That law in California says if you misgender someone, you say, hey, sir.
[02:12:27.531 --> 02:12:30.613]  And the guy's got a short haircut and looks like me.
[02:12:30.613 --> 02:12:32.034]  I'm a woman, how dare you?
[02:12:32.034 --> 02:12:35.676]  I've got a beard, but you ain't never seen a bearded lady?
[02:12:35.676 --> 02:12:37.738]  That's a crime.
[02:12:37.738 --> 02:12:40.860]  So this is a war on reality, a total power grab.
[02:12:41.860 --> 02:12:46.723]  It's absolutely out of control, and it's incredibly dangerous.
[02:12:46.723 --> 02:12:50.966]  But I can't wait to talk to this fella, because he put together a really good ad.
[02:12:50.966 --> 02:12:53.908]  So we're gonna work on his audio, maybe get him an external mic.
[02:12:53.908 --> 02:12:56.490]  Maybe we'll teleport that up to Oklahoma.
[02:12:56.490 --> 02:12:57.331]  Northerners up there.
[02:12:58.111 --> 02:12:59.852]  Part of Oklahoma, part of Texas.
[02:12:59.852 --> 02:13:01.513]  And then we'll get right back to him.
[02:13:01.513 --> 02:13:03.274]  But I wanted to air this little piece.
[02:13:03.274 --> 02:13:09.597]  Smart meter radiation attached to millions of homes as a public service announcement is incredibly important.
[02:13:09.597 --> 02:13:14.079]  So again, smart meter radiation attached to millions of homes.
[02:13:14.079 --> 02:13:23.944]  The only way we're going to warn people about smart meters being basically 4G, the 5G, not linked but proven to be causing cancer, is to admit this is happening.
[02:13:23.944 --> 02:13:25.865]  So we're going to go out to break playing part of this report.
[02:13:26.687 --> 02:13:32.891]  The government says you should set your thermostat to 80-something degrees at night to save the Earth and save the planet.
[02:13:32.891 --> 02:13:35.232]  The idea that carbon dioxide is bad, it's actually good.
[02:13:35.232 --> 02:13:40.875]  If you liquefied all the CO2 in the atmosphere down to be less than an inch, it was liquefied.
[02:13:40.875 --> 02:13:44.617]  I mean, it's one of those trace gases out there essential for life.
[02:13:44.617 --> 02:13:46.418]  If we didn't have it, we'd all die.
[02:13:46.418 --> 02:13:47.679]  Plants would not put out oxygen.
[02:13:50.325 --> 02:13:51.567]  That's what's going on.
[02:13:51.567 --> 02:13:53.669]  First they said 87 degrees, now they're saying 78 degrees.
[02:13:53.669 --> 02:13:56.974]  They're trying to walk it back because of the backlash.
[02:13:56.974 --> 02:14:06.425]  But remember, they told us 10 years ago, oh the smart meters will turn your thermostat down for you at night, and your smartphones will interface with it and track what you're doing.
[02:14:07.318 --> 02:14:12.525]  And the government then under Obama was saying, we'll just do this without you consenting.
[02:14:12.525 --> 02:14:23.199]  We do know that some smart meters produce data that has enough granularity that experts are able to go in and tell what kind of appliances people are using.
[02:14:23.559 --> 02:14:31.644]  Despite concerns from groups like the ACLU, the utility says it's built cyber security into the meters and the software that runs them.
[02:14:31.644 --> 02:14:33.885]  But information's still being gleaned.
[02:14:33.885 --> 02:14:36.627]  They're building a profile on the consumer.
[02:14:36.627 --> 02:14:39.028]  Not only their usage, but the time of day.
[02:14:39.028 --> 02:14:43.431]  You can tell when a homeowner is home or not by this monitoring.
[02:14:43.431 --> 02:14:45.552]  We don't know if their system can be hacked.
[02:14:45.552 --> 02:14:50.815]  And then there's the concern of radio frequency emissions, which some say can cause health issues.
[02:14:51.235 --> 02:14:52.476]  We spend a lot of time out here.
[02:14:52.476 --> 02:14:53.257]  We're going to break.
[02:14:53.257 --> 02:14:54.718]  It isn't some say.
[02:14:54.718 --> 02:14:55.780]  It's all the major studies.
[02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:56.861]  It's conclusive.
[02:14:56.861 --> 02:14:58.502]  Cigarettes cause cancer.
[02:14:58.502 --> 02:15:00.664]  5G, 4G, 3G cause cancer.
[02:15:00.664 --> 02:15:03.207]  Cell towers give your kids big giant brain tumors.
[02:15:03.207 --> 02:15:06.130]  Brain tumors are up tens of thousands of percent.
[02:15:06.130 --> 02:15:08.872]  I see kids everywhere with their heads shaved and surgery points on them.
[02:15:08.872 --> 02:15:12.596]  Saw like five kids yesterday that had part of their brains cut out.
[02:15:12.596 --> 02:15:13.577]  I wouldn't even looking for it!
[02:15:16.334 --> 02:15:22.076]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[02:15:22.076 --> 02:15:27.177]  Now, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[02:15:27.177 --> 02:15:34.899]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[02:15:34.899 --> 02:15:42.781]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[02:15:42.961 --> 02:15:44.762]  Not a security IPO or note.
[02:15:44.762 --> 02:15:54.267]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[02:15:54.267 --> 02:15:55.107]  Don't miss this one.
[02:15:55.107 --> 02:15:56.408]  Stake your claim today.
[02:15:56.408 --> 02:15:56.688]  Call 800-600-3388.
[02:15:56.688 --> 02:15:57.028]  That's 800-600-3388.
[02:15:57.028 --> 02:15:59.109]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.469]  Call now 800-600-3388.
[02:15:59.469 --> 02:15:59.509]  800-600-3388.
[02:16:09.654 --> 02:16:11.077]  Equipment offered poses a financial risk.
[02:16:11.077 --> 02:16:13.001]  Owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[02:16:13.001 --> 02:16:15.506]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[02:16:16.346 --> 02:16:21.407]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[02:16:21.407 --> 02:16:26.769]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the outleft sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.

[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:30.033]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[02:18:30.033 --> 02:18:32.936]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[02:18:32.936 --> 02:18:34.698]  farming goods a week ago.
[02:18:34.698 --> 02:18:38.361]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[02:18:38.982 --> 02:18:43.543]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[02:18:43.543 --> 02:18:44.584]  That's beautiful.
[02:18:44.584 --> 02:18:46.484]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[02:18:46.484 --> 02:18:48.085]  And we aren't going to back down.
[02:18:48.085 --> 02:18:55.687]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[02:18:55.687 --> 02:18:58.007]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[02:18:58.007 --> 02:19:02.169]  And the human spirit lives at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:19:02.169 --> 02:19:03.089]  And I'm asking listeners,
[02:19:03.889 --> 02:19:08.012]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[02:19:08.012 --> 02:19:09.112]  We are the resistance.
[02:19:09.112 --> 02:19:20.259]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[02:19:20.259 --> 02:19:23.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:44.502 --> 02:19:56.126]  And this is an example of a small business person fighting back and putting out a viral video that shows how Facebook won't let you say the word guns, firearms, ammunition, shotguns, rifles, you name it.
[02:19:56.126 --> 02:20:00.667]  And again, they've now moved on to everything else and all these other words.
[02:20:00.667 --> 02:20:01.947]  Congress has got to act.
[02:20:01.947 --> 02:20:04.608]  So get into why you did this.
[02:20:04.608 --> 02:20:06.849]  Recap what you were saying earlier before your audio cut out.
[02:20:07.529 --> 02:20:10.191]  And where do you see all this is going?
[02:20:10.191 --> 02:20:14.274]  And again, it's a hilarious gun store ad bypasses Facebook censorship.
[02:20:14.274 --> 02:20:15.515]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:20:15.515 --> 02:20:18.177]  So tell us, tell us more about this.
[02:20:18.177 --> 02:20:18.738]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:20:18.738 --> 02:20:27.845]  So a friend of mine and I were having breakfast one morning and I was kind of telling him about the struggles I was having about advertising on Facebook.
[02:20:27.845 --> 02:20:36.712]  And he said, you know what, what if you said all those, all the words, guns, rifles, pistols, shotguns, but you bleeped it out.
[02:20:37.648 --> 02:20:43.030]  And you make eight videos where every one of those words is bleeped out.
[02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:47.472]  So that's what we did.
[02:20:47.472 --> 02:20:49.612]  Well, it was really smart and it's gotten a lot of attention.
[02:20:49.612 --> 02:20:51.093]  Tell us about this particular actor.
[02:20:51.093 --> 02:20:52.974]  He's a funny guy.
[02:20:52.974 --> 02:20:54.794]  Oh, he was great.
[02:20:54.794 --> 02:20:56.695]  He owns the media production company.
[02:20:56.695 --> 02:21:00.556]  He's called Six Foot Five Production in Birmingham.
[02:21:00.556 --> 02:21:05.358]  And actually, a friend of mine that I was having breakfast with knew Taylor Robinson.
[02:21:06.001 --> 02:21:09.322]  Well, I'm actually just like this guy in real life, so...
[02:21:22.088 --> 02:21:22.728]  Oh, are you really?
[02:21:22.728 --> 02:21:24.349]  Well, I'll call you next time.
[02:21:24.349 --> 02:21:24.870]  No, no, no.
[02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:33.355]  I'm going to hire him to do an ad for us because, seriously, we're in the same position where you can't say Alex Jones, you can't say InfoWars, you can't say Strong Women.
[02:21:33.355 --> 02:21:38.938]  So I'm going to take all the things that Facebook has actually banned and maybe have somebody like him saying, hey, I'm here from Facebook.
[02:21:38.938 --> 02:21:40.339]  Let me tell you what you can't say.
[02:21:40.339 --> 02:21:41.840]  Shut your damn mouth, Americans.
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:42.700]  You can't say this.
[02:21:42.700 --> 02:21:43.480]  You can't say that.
[02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:45.021]  I mean, he's a good guy.
[02:21:45.021 --> 02:21:47.783]  Oh, he was a great guy.
[02:21:47.783 --> 02:21:51.165]  And what we wanted to do was we just wanted to, you know, kind of
[02:21:51.618 --> 02:22:00.663]  Poke fun at both sides of it and, you know, create something that we thought that our customers would like and our customers would think was funny.
[02:22:00.663 --> 02:22:03.425]  And I think we've done that so far.
[02:22:03.425 --> 02:22:06.186]  What's the response been like?
[02:22:06.186 --> 02:22:07.387]  Oh, it's been great.
[02:22:07.387 --> 02:22:11.289]  I had a guy call me from Amsterdam.
[02:22:11.289 --> 02:22:20.955]  We've had several emails, even from Ireland, you know, telling us to, you know, keep fighting, keep fighting the good fight and that they love the commercial.
[02:22:21.641 --> 02:22:27.385]  And what's even funny, too, is, you know, there's been almost negative, you know, no negative feedback.
[02:22:27.385 --> 02:22:32.228]  You know, even the anti-gun people have emailed us and said, you know what?
[02:22:32.228 --> 02:22:33.668]  I can appreciate something like this.
[02:22:33.668 --> 02:22:36.470]  This is funny.
[02:22:36.470 --> 02:22:44.655]  But think about the danger of the assault on the language where you can't say strong women because that misgenders people if someone sees the word woman.
[02:22:44.655 --> 02:22:45.556]  This is a cult.
[02:22:45.556 --> 02:22:46.917]  This is so dangerous.
[02:22:46.917 --> 02:22:48.217]  This is beyond things like 1984.
[02:22:51.492 --> 02:23:06.264]  It is, and you know, I wish they wouldn't censor stuff like that, but no, there's rules that they have that I have to play by, and so that's what we did, and we were able to create these videos.
[02:23:06.264 --> 02:23:08.346]  And what's funny is a lot of people don't know.
[02:23:08.346 --> 02:23:12.769]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:23:12.769 --> 02:23:19.214]  Well, a lot of people don't know is that we did create eight of them, so the next one is actually coming out tomorrow at 9.15, and they all have
[02:23:20.694 --> 02:23:26.417]  You know, every time it says any of these words, it's bleeped out.
[02:23:26.417 --> 02:23:28.238]  Well, I would love for you to send us that as well.
[02:23:28.238 --> 02:23:34.001]  If you send it to us, we'll premiere it at 9.15 as well on Infowars.com, because these are really, really funny ads.
[02:23:34.001 --> 02:23:38.724]  So, we've only seen the first, and now we're going to get to see seven more.
[02:23:38.724 --> 02:23:39.824]  That is correct.
[02:23:39.824 --> 02:23:41.165]  Yes, sir.
[02:23:41.165 --> 02:23:44.427]  So, I would say that's money well spent.
[02:23:44.427 --> 02:23:48.469]  I like how you worked around what Facebook is doing, so they haven't restricted these ads yet.
[02:23:50.189 --> 02:23:50.989]  No, they haven't.
[02:23:50.989 --> 02:23:53.290]  And you know, I'm kind of surprised they haven't.
[02:23:53.290 --> 02:23:59.091]  But, you know, we actually never say guns, rifles, pistols or shotguns.
[02:23:59.091 --> 02:24:03.693]  So I don't know what their grounds would be if they did want to take it off.
[02:24:03.693 --> 02:24:07.934]  Well, you know, they're just going to probably change their rules, which is really frightening.
[02:24:07.934 --> 02:24:13.315]  How are folks responding to all this censorship and things that are going on up in Oklahoma?
[02:24:13.315 --> 02:24:16.436]  Oh, you know, there's of course, you know, and
[02:24:17.310 --> 02:24:27.293]  In Oklahoma, and especially in my part of the country, in Duncan, Oklahoma, most people are pro-gun, so they do think it's pretty ridiculous, but there's ways around it.
[02:24:27.293 --> 02:24:42.457]  You know, if you want to, if an individual wants to sell, you know, two guns and they want to put it on Facebook, you know, they could take a picture of it and say, you know, the cup of coffee is on the, the cup of coffee on the left is, you know, X amount of dollars and the cup of coffee on the right
[02:24:43.253 --> 02:24:47.805]  Is X amount of dollars, but Facebook won't pick up on it because you didn't say gun.
[02:24:47.805 --> 02:24:49.309]  So there's ways around it.
[02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:50.331]  So people still do it.
[02:24:52.079 --> 02:24:56.622]  And that's why Facebook and Twitter and the European Union want to ban memes.
[02:24:56.622 --> 02:25:02.126]  They actually passed a law saying you can be fined thousands of euros if you don't get a meme pre-approved by the government.
[02:25:02.126 --> 02:25:05.308]  That's just taking an image and making a joke about it.
[02:25:05.308 --> 02:25:09.991]  Because AI can't tell what humor is and AI can't tell when you're making a joke.
[02:25:09.991 --> 02:25:12.333]  And that's really the beauty of the human mind.
[02:25:12.333 --> 02:25:15.975]  So we're being told by Elon Musk that the age of humans is over.
[02:25:15.975 --> 02:25:20.118]  Our age is just beginning unless we advocate our authority over to this system.
[02:25:22.506 --> 02:25:23.787]  That is correct.
[02:25:23.787 --> 02:25:29.589]  I mean, we need to continue to support those who support the Second Amendment.
[02:25:29.589 --> 02:25:32.711]  And, you know, I am all for the Second Amendment.
[02:25:32.711 --> 02:25:35.973]  I'm all for electing people that are pro-Second Amendment.
[02:25:35.973 --> 02:25:37.553]  And, you know, it's really funny.
[02:25:37.553 --> 02:25:42.896]  I've done detailed research, and I've never sold a gun to somebody that was anti-gun.
[02:25:42.896 --> 02:25:47.058]  So we need to continue to put those people in office that
[02:25:47.955 --> 02:25:50.816]  You know, that are pro Second Amendment and that are going to fight for our rights.
[02:25:50.816 --> 02:25:52.516]  By the way, is that a new t-shirt?
[02:25:52.516 --> 02:25:54.317]  It says Murphs and it shows a pheasant.
[02:25:54.317 --> 02:25:56.017]  Guns is blurred out.
[02:25:56.017 --> 02:25:59.798]  Is that part of this advertising campaign?
[02:25:59.798 --> 02:26:00.539]  It is.
[02:26:00.539 --> 02:26:01.259]  Yes, sir.
[02:26:01.259 --> 02:26:07.621]  And in fact, we were planning on making some t-shirts, but we were just a little bit behind the ball.
[02:26:07.621 --> 02:26:15.043]  And whenever we released this video, man, it went over like gangbusters and people were telling us, you know, get a shirt, get a shirt.
[02:26:16.161 --> 02:26:20.623]  We actually have shirts available on our website and we also have water bottles as well.
[02:26:20.623 --> 02:26:21.764]  That's awesome.
[02:26:21.764 --> 02:26:23.644]  So shirts are allowed, water bottles are allowed.
[02:26:23.644 --> 02:26:25.285]  Facebook won't get mad about that.
[02:26:25.285 --> 02:26:36.410]  But seriously, I hope that you'll send me or maybe I should get one of complimentary Murph's guns in extra large because that is a handsome, simple, good old-fashioned shirt and people ask why it's blurred.
[02:26:36.410 --> 02:26:38.611]  Well, that's not to make the libtards angry.
[02:26:38.611 --> 02:26:42.053]  We don't want to trigger them with free speech.
[02:26:42.053 --> 02:26:42.773]  That is correct.
[02:26:42.773 --> 02:26:44.794]  If you'll send me your address, I'll send you a couple.
[02:26:46.013 --> 02:26:48.836]  I'm throwing a water bottle for you.
[02:26:48.836 --> 02:26:55.563]  I just want to say I appreciate you having me on here and stay tuned we do have seven more commercials coming so I hope you enjoy them.
[02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:15.506]  All right, well, let's all hang together on the First Amendment as well, because I know you're getting around it, and it's cute, and it's funny, and it's smart, and you should do it.
[02:27:15.506 --> 02:27:26.697]  We should adapt and improvise, but we should also go to Congress and say, listen, these are bigger than telecoms, bigger than AT&T, and they need to stop this, because they're trying to block Christian groups.
[02:27:26.697 --> 02:27:29.180]  Like I said, they're blocking Republican ads, Twitter block.
[02:27:29.660 --> 02:27:30.140]  It is very dangerous.
[02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:32.981]  And, you know, I wish everybody was able to play by the same set of rules.
[02:27:32.981 --> 02:27:35.682]  You know, you being a gun store owner, I'm limited on that.
[02:27:35.682 --> 02:27:39.083]  But the one thing that I'm thankful for is I know God is still in control.
[02:27:39.083 --> 02:27:42.764]  And so that's what I hang my hat on.
[02:27:42.764 --> 02:27:44.665]  Every night I go to sleep and every morning I wake up and
[02:27:59.696 --> 02:28:03.659]  So I'm thankful for that, but we do need to continue to fight for our freedoms and our liberties.
[02:28:16.894 --> 02:28:27.940]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[02:29:28.592 --> 02:29:32.715]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[02:29:32.715 --> 02:29:42.082]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[02:29:42.802 --> 02:29:44.844]  The system is vulnerable.
[02:29:44.844 --> 02:29:47.527]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[02:29:47.527 --> 02:29:51.150]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.

[02:30:17.607 --> 02:30:17.907]  Alec?
[02:30:17.907 --> 02:30:18.307]  Yes?
[02:30:18.307 --> 02:30:20.668]  I gotta plug for the Patriot Points I get.
[02:30:20.668 --> 02:30:21.448]  Oh, thank you.
[02:30:21.448 --> 02:30:23.969]  I've gotten $180 so far this year, and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[02:30:24.629 --> 02:30:27.750]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:30.970]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in.
[02:30:30.970 --> 02:30:32.531]  So I'd rather give that money to you.
[02:30:32.531 --> 02:30:33.651]  And I'm getting quality products.
[02:30:33.651 --> 02:30:36.211]  The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[02:30:36.211 --> 02:30:38.432]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me.
[02:30:38.432 --> 02:30:39.212]  I've lost weight.
[02:30:39.212 --> 02:30:40.972]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[02:30:40.972 --> 02:30:42.753]  My kids, they use the toothpaste.
[02:30:42.753 --> 02:30:47.854]  My son used to get these little sore throats, and he puts X2 in water and drinks it, and it gets rid of his sore throat.
[02:30:48.474 --> 02:30:50.095]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[02:30:50.095 --> 02:30:51.597]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[02:30:51.597 --> 02:30:52.638]  I want a good price.
[02:30:52.638 --> 02:30:56.741]  But I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[02:30:56.741 --> 02:30:59.003]  I'm making $2 on my toothpaste 50% off.
[02:30:59.003 --> 02:31:02.606]  And so it's the same thing with like the fish oil, or the turmeric, or the bone broth.
[02:31:02.606 --> 02:31:03.566]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[02:31:03.566 --> 02:31:07.770]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[02:31:07.770 --> 02:31:15.536]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, then we're doing 50% off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot points, we lose money.
[02:31:15.536 --> 02:31:16.096]  But that's okay.
[02:31:16.096 --> 02:31:16.717]  Thanks for the support.
[02:31:18.570 --> 02:31:19.771]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[02:31:19.771 --> 02:31:23.133]  I've been so busy I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[02:31:23.133 --> 02:31:24.374]  But it's very exciting.
[02:31:24.374 --> 02:31:26.696]  It's Super Silver Skin Cream.
[02:31:26.696 --> 02:31:28.217]  It's got all of these benefits.
[02:31:28.217 --> 02:31:29.297]  Too many to mention.
[02:31:29.297 --> 02:31:30.558]  But it's revolutionary.
[02:31:30.558 --> 02:31:31.519]  It's brand new.
[02:31:31.519 --> 02:31:32.359]  People are going to love it.
[02:31:32.359 --> 02:31:34.501]  Introducing the new Super Silver Skin Cream.
[02:31:34.501 --> 02:31:35.442]  Exclusively at Inforestore.com.
[02:31:35.442 --> 02:31:36.242]  25% off introductory price.
[02:31:37.603 --> 02:31:40.065]  Super Silver Skin Cream is the best of both worlds.
[02:31:40.065 --> 02:31:42.307]  It helps reduce wrinkles and keep your skin healthy.
[02:31:42.307 --> 02:31:46.070]  Super Silver Skin Cream is infused with patented Silver Sol Technology.
[02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:51.214]  It's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.
[02:31:51.214 --> 02:32:02.323]  It's also loaded with the best natural ingredients for your skin, like coconut oil, vitamin E. Unlike most skin creams, Super Silver Skin Cream is free of BPA, parabens, harsh preservatives, and sulfates.
[02:32:02.323 --> 02:32:04.325]  It's got the highly sought-after hyaluronic
[02:32:04.665 --> 02:32:06.845]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:32:37.293 --> 02:32:39.735]  We've got Greg Reese and Savannah Hernandez.
[02:32:39.735 --> 02:32:43.297]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:32:43.297 --> 02:32:46.458]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:32:46.458 --> 02:32:55.264]  Like I said, we've got Greg Reese and Savannah Hernandez joining the broadcast in the fourth hour today.
[02:32:55.264 --> 02:32:56.284]  They're going to be co-hosting.
[02:32:56.284 --> 02:32:59.086]  They just got back from Hong Kong.
[02:32:59.086 --> 02:33:01.327]  That's really a big deal.
[02:33:01.327 --> 02:33:02.008]  Chinese troops.
[02:33:03.058 --> 02:33:04.899]  We're good to go.
[02:33:20.103 --> 02:33:30.728]  The population, if they try to go out and demonstrate, it's estimated that 80% of the population there does not want to be under Chinese mainland rule.
[02:33:30.728 --> 02:33:39.433]  They are the children and grandchildren of those that fled 70 years ago when Mao Zedong took over the mainland and began slaughtering over 100 million people.
[02:33:40.728 --> 02:33:42.991]  But they never got in trouble like Hitler.
[02:33:42.991 --> 02:33:55.386]  So basically, the government put in by somebody as bad or worse than Hitler is now invading their nation and now shipping in massive Chinese Communist Party nationals to take over.
[02:33:55.386 --> 02:33:57.189]  And they're angry.
[02:33:58.424 --> 02:33:59.766]  They're upset.
[02:33:59.766 --> 02:34:03.110]  So I've got a bunch of other news I want to hit, but we'll do that next segment.
[02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:05.653]  I want to play Paul Joseph Watson's report.
[02:34:05.653 --> 02:34:11.280]  He just got back yesterday as well, breaking down what's really happening in Hong Kong.
[02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:13.582]  But this is a big, big deal.
[02:34:13.582 --> 02:34:17.748]  And then Engineering School lowers entry bar for women.
[02:34:19.363 --> 02:34:25.407]  Critics blast MOVE as insulting to women, especially current female engineers.
[02:34:25.407 --> 02:34:31.911]  And the Army Rangers have lowered standards yet again so that they can put women into the meat grinder.
[02:34:32.839 --> 02:34:37.782]  Also, I mentioned this at the start of the show, it's linked up at newswars.com and infowars.com.
[02:34:37.782 --> 02:34:39.443]  It's not just happening in Austin.
[02:34:39.443 --> 02:34:41.304]  I first heard about this two months ago.
[02:34:41.304 --> 02:34:49.929]  Now it's happening all over areas in the southern United States where they've had temperatures over 100 degrees weeks on end.
[02:34:49.929 --> 02:34:51.450]  Hundreds of dog deaths in Austin.
[02:34:52.270 --> 02:34:54.312]  Because most of them don't get reported.
[02:34:54.312 --> 02:34:55.593]  Thousands all over the country.
[02:34:55.593 --> 02:35:02.759]  I personally know people whose dogs have died that didn't tell the news or the health department.
[02:35:02.759 --> 02:35:03.980]  And we'll tell you what's happening.
[02:35:03.980 --> 02:35:05.221]  Dog deaths across the U.S.
[02:35:05.221 --> 02:35:08.463]  linked to toxic blue-green algae in lakes and ponds.
[02:35:08.463 --> 02:35:12.327]  But here's Paul Joseph Watson's report on Hong Kong.
[02:35:12.327 --> 02:35:15.890]  Tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons, live rounds fired.
[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:30.367]  What's that dog got?
[02:35:35.336 --> 02:35:38.278]  That was my leisurely Sunday afternoon in Hong Kong.
[02:35:38.278 --> 02:35:40.319]  Why are the protesters out on the streets?
[02:35:40.319 --> 02:35:42.080]  They have five demands.
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:47.223]  One, the full withdrawal of a bill that would allow suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to China.
[02:35:47.223 --> 02:35:49.985]  Two, an inquiry into allegations of police brutality.
[02:35:49.985 --> 02:35:52.727]  Three, amnesty for the arrested protesters.
[02:35:52.727 --> 02:36:01.132]  Four, universal suffrage to allow 100% of the city's executive council, which is dominated by Beijing, to be voted in by the people of Hong Kong.
[02:36:01.332 --> 02:36:06.254]  The fifth demand is that authorities stop referring to the demonstrations as riots.
[02:36:06.254 --> 02:36:13.217]  Which is probably going to be difficult given that you basically have two armies dressed in battle gear, gas masks and armed with weapons.
[02:36:13.217 --> 02:36:16.399]  One side lobbing tear gas, the other side lobbing bricks.
[02:36:16.399 --> 02:36:18.280]  It certainly looked like a riot to me.
[02:36:26.201 --> 02:36:33.644]  The Hong Kong government has said over and over again that it won't accept any of the five demands, so the violence will only escalate.
[02:36:33.644 --> 02:36:43.787]  Many protesters have also said they think violence is part of protest and that the threat to their freedoms is so existential they need to resort to all means possible.
[02:36:43.787 --> 02:36:53.250]  We talked to several people who said that the Chinese government is using mass migration to subsume Hong Kong's identity and weaken its unity.
[02:36:53.250 --> 02:36:55.071]  Does that remind you of anything?
[02:37:02.856 --> 02:37:09.960]  Chinese people are allowed to move to Hong Kong and get immediate access to the jobs market, housing and healthcare benefits.
[02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:11.841]  They're even allowed to vote.
[02:37:11.841 --> 02:37:17.625]  This destabilisation and subversion of Hong Kong is driving a great deal of the resentment.
[02:37:17.745 --> 02:37:19.046]  And it goes both ways.
[02:37:19.046 --> 02:37:24.690]  Dozens of Chinese taxi drivers in Hong Kong are flying huge Chinese flags from the back of their cars.
[02:37:24.690 --> 02:37:28.853]  There have also been small, sporadic pro-China protests in the city.
[02:37:28.853 --> 02:37:33.876]  But they're miniscule in comparison to the anti-Beijing protests.
[02:37:33.996 --> 02:37:42.924]  Despite dressing similar, the Hong Kong protesters are very different from America's snarling, spitting, obnoxious Antifa thugs.
[02:37:42.924 --> 02:37:52.974]  Whereas Antifa attacks the media and refuses to be filmed, the Hong Kong protesters go out of their way to protect the media and prevent journalists from being harmed.
[02:37:52.974 --> 02:37:58.259]  Whereas Antifa burns the American flag, the Hong Kong protesters fly it proudly.
[02:37:58.339 --> 02:38:10.123]  They've also taken a shining to Pepe the Frog, proving once again that any meme can be reclaimed and repurposed despite the American media's obsession with denouncing it as a hate symbol.
[02:38:10.123 --> 02:38:16.905]  And no, that doesn't mean the protesters are far right, as numerous idiotic, tanky, left-wing journalists are claiming.
[02:38:17.005 --> 02:38:24.507]  Opposing an authoritarian regime that silences dissent by literally flattening people doesn't make you far right.
[02:38:24.507 --> 02:38:25.868]  It just makes you right.
[02:38:25.868 --> 02:38:31.690]  No reasonable person could deny that the protesters' grievances and fears are entirely authentic.
[02:38:31.690 --> 02:38:41.533]  This isn't a bunch of whiny privileged leftists protesting for rights they already have just so they can virtue signal about waving a woke banner on social media.
[02:38:41.533 --> 02:38:45.554]  This is a nation's youth fighting for the preservation of its future.
[02:38:45.674 --> 02:38:49.897]  They're going up against one of the most fearsome military regimes on the planet.
[02:38:49.897 --> 02:38:56.482]  A nuclear armed dictatorship that interns millions of members of minority groups in re-education camps.
[02:38:56.482 --> 02:39:03.567]  They're risking incarceration, torture, and a nightmare future trapped in China's social credit score system.
[02:39:03.567 --> 02:39:14.175]  A minority report style dystopia where dissidents who express the wrong political opinions are prevented from using social media, traveling, or even having bank accounts.
[02:39:14.175 --> 02:39:14.475]  Again,
[02:39:14.895 --> 02:39:16.116]  Remind you of anything?
[02:39:31.482 --> 02:39:40.687]  The anti-surveillance aspect of the demonstrations came to the fore when protesters tore down so-called smart lamps which they fear are secretly scanning their faces.
[02:39:40.687 --> 02:39:53.853]  To give you an idea of how intense China's control over propaganda and information really is, a local Catholic priest who didn't want to be named for fear of repercussions said that religious education in China is so tightly controlled
[02:39:53.933 --> 02:39:58.956]  That many people have never even heard of Jesus Christ.
[02:39:58.956 --> 02:40:03.698]  The Christian community in Hong Kong is standing firmly behind the protesters.
[02:40:03.698 --> 02:40:07.680]  On Friday night there was a vigil attended by thousands of participants.
[02:40:21.317 --> 02:40:29.699]  This preceded the monumental Human Chain, where protesters linked arms for 30 miles around the entire city.
[02:40:29.699 --> 02:40:31.960]  They even climbed up mountains.
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:44.324]  The event was an homage to the Baltic Way, when two million people joined hands around three countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in 1989 to protest against the tyranny of Soviet rule.
[02:40:44.324 --> 02:40:48.785]  Which reminds us that the Hong Kong protest is fundamentally anti-communist.
[02:40:48.965 --> 02:40:52.767]  Chai Nazi graffiti also adorns walls across the city.
[02:40:52.767 --> 02:40:56.309]  The wider Hong Kong population broadly supports the protesters.
[02:40:56.309 --> 02:41:04.793]  Which is no surprise given that police have fired tear gas inside shopping malls, subways and densely populated residential areas.
[02:41:04.793 --> 02:41:10.536]  Leading in some situations to angry residents banding together and forcing the cops to leave.
[02:41:10.536 --> 02:41:12.256]  Who's responsible for the violence?
[02:41:12.256 --> 02:41:17.059]  Police claim they're merely defending themselves against armed mobs and trying to maintain order.
[02:41:17.759 --> 02:41:18.500]  Who the hell are you?
[02:41:37.341 --> 02:41:42.566]  Will they be sent into Hong Kong to enact a brutal, bloody crackdown?
[02:41:42.566 --> 02:41:49.652]  Probably not, experts say, but Chinese culture is all about avoiding embarrassment, saving face.
[02:41:49.652 --> 02:42:00.662]  If Hong Kong is still in turmoil on October 1st, the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China, that will be the biggest embarrassment imaginable for Beijing.
[02:42:00.662 --> 02:42:02.564]  So they have to do something.
[02:42:02.944 --> 02:42:04.665]  And this is China we're talking about.
[02:42:04.665 --> 02:42:07.807]  Tiananmen Square was only 30 years ago.
[02:42:07.807 --> 02:42:11.209]  What that something will be remains to be seen.
[02:42:11.209 --> 02:42:16.813]  But it certainly isn't going to be pretty.
[02:42:16.813 --> 02:42:20.055]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor.
[02:42:20.055 --> 02:42:21.656]  But I still need my morning coffee.
[02:42:22.972 --> 02:42:32.374]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:42:32.374 --> 02:42:43.996]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[02:42:43.996 --> 02:42:48.197]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.

[02:44:20.341 --> 02:44:22.923]  I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt.
[02:44:22.923 --> 02:44:28.908]  Instead of, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[02:44:28.908 --> 02:44:29.568]  Ooh, yeah.
[02:44:29.568 --> 02:44:30.929]  Showing your brain getting frat.

[02:44:32.771 --> 02:44:33.811]  Totally changed my life.

[02:44:37.054 --> 02:44:37.435]  We're good.
[02:44:52.351 --> 02:45:01.478]  All of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil, or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[02:45:01.478 --> 02:45:04.000]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel in the body.
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:08.924]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation, now you can build the big strong temple.
[02:45:08.924 --> 02:45:15.669]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better, and then it funds the information war, which is so critical.

[02:46:23.376 --> 02:46:36.629]  Keep your eyes on the road and your hands upon the wheel.
[02:46:53.689 --> 02:46:56.630]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:58.231]  Who's hosting the fourth hour?
[02:46:58.231 --> 02:46:59.532]  You know who.
[02:46:59.532 --> 02:47:02.754]  Savannah Hernandez and Greg Reese back from Hong Kong.
[02:47:02.754 --> 02:47:03.834]  It's important.
[02:47:03.834 --> 02:47:06.255]  Chinese troops have invaded.
[02:47:06.255 --> 02:47:08.656]  We're going to be breaking it all down.
[02:47:08.656 --> 02:47:17.681]  And then, of course, tomorrow I'm going to have wide open phones and I'm going to get into the technocracy, the transhumanist takeover plan that's now being admitted everywhere.
[02:47:20.109 --> 02:47:23.192]  If you look at the reports we aired earlier, it is simply amazing footage.
[02:47:23.192 --> 02:47:26.915]  The armored vehicles, the tanks rolling across, the troops massing.
[02:47:29.127 --> 02:47:39.195]  That story is up on DrugsReport.com and Infowars.com if you want to see the raw videos and all of it for yourself.
[02:47:39.195 --> 02:47:45.761]  And also Ilhan Omar demands the UN take control of US borders in mirror of European migrant crisis.
[02:47:45.761 --> 02:47:51.746]  Such an important story because the UN is running that operation.
[02:47:51.746 --> 02:47:55.208]  And by the way, I don't do inhalers.
[02:47:55.208 --> 02:47:56.850]  This inhaler has been here for about
[02:47:58.490 --> 02:48:00.151]  Six months.
[02:48:00.151 --> 02:48:01.411]  I can just see people in the document cam.
[02:48:01.411 --> 02:48:05.293]  There'll be a whole new conspiracy about the inhaler there.
[02:48:05.293 --> 02:48:06.474]  But it doesn't really matter.
[02:48:06.474 --> 02:48:08.455]  The only way to get rid of this inhaler is to do this.
[02:48:08.455 --> 02:48:10.836]  There you go.
[02:48:10.836 --> 02:48:12.137]  Wow, actually broke a light or something.
[02:48:12.137 --> 02:48:13.798]  That's a good shot, huh?
[02:48:13.798 --> 02:48:16.239]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, continuing.
[02:48:16.239 --> 02:48:17.419]  What else is over here on this table?
[02:48:17.419 --> 02:48:19.920]  We've got, we've got a Trump 2020.
[02:48:23.468 --> 02:48:24.309]  $100 bill.
[02:48:24.309 --> 02:48:26.650]  I don't think this is, I don't think this is real.
[02:48:26.650 --> 02:48:28.391]  It's kind of like a seashore or something over here.
[02:48:28.391 --> 02:48:31.193]  Things just kind of accumulate and pile up on it.
[02:48:31.193 --> 02:48:32.934]  I have a eco-science book down here.
[02:48:32.934 --> 02:48:36.516]  They're planning to put fluoride in the water and poison you and your family.
[02:48:36.516 --> 02:48:38.857]  Maybe we should talk about that.
[02:48:38.857 --> 02:48:42.199]  But again, continuing, I have a few stories that I want to hit here.
[02:48:42.199 --> 02:48:46.762]  But first, we produced a product
[02:48:47.895 --> 02:48:48.855]  Call it carnivore.
[02:48:59.790 --> 02:49:05.772]  Absorb and break down the protein and the fat much better, and then also flush you out.
[02:49:05.772 --> 02:49:08.873]  Everybody knows probiotics are really, really good.
[02:49:08.873 --> 02:49:13.755]  Foods that are also been fermented are really, really good for your guts, upper and lower intestine.
[02:49:13.755 --> 02:49:20.417]  But because of all the toxins in the food, the chemicals and things, a lot of those bacteria get killed, especially if you take antibiotics.
[02:49:20.417 --> 02:49:26.079]  You gotta replace it with, again, really good probiotics is the quickest way to do that with a regimen.
[02:49:26.079 --> 02:49:28.360]  And we sell great Floralife probiotics.
[02:49:30.681 --> 02:49:35.683]  But we also have the MycoZX that knocks out the yeast, the candida, the mold.
[02:49:35.683 --> 02:49:37.364]  That's something people don't go after.
[02:49:37.364 --> 02:49:38.104]  It's incredible.
[02:49:38.104 --> 02:49:47.849]  But Carnivore, in the 90 capsule bottle, cost us $17.80 something cents.
[02:49:47.849 --> 02:49:52.191]  Because we went with the very best enzymes, the most high quality, the most concentrated.
[02:49:54.092 --> 02:49:57.973]  The 30-pack cost us over $7 in a nice glass bottle.
[02:49:57.973 --> 02:50:01.714]  Those are free right now while the 2000 bottles sell out.
[02:50:01.714 --> 02:50:04.074]  In just a couple days, it'll be a new special.
[02:50:04.074 --> 02:50:14.636]  When you get it with DNA Force Plus, with the PQQ, the CoQ10, and all the rest of it for your telomeres, your cells, for a base, for everything you do, you cannot beat that product.
[02:50:14.636 --> 02:50:19.057]  But because I want you to experience DNA Force Plus and Carnivore that goes so well together,
[02:50:20.555 --> 02:50:24.736]  You get a free bottle of Carnivore with DNA Force, the 90 count one.
[02:50:24.736 --> 02:50:28.897]  And with Super Mel Vitality, you get a free bottle of the 30 count Carnivore.
[02:50:28.897 --> 02:50:30.557]  So this is the trifecta.
[02:50:30.557 --> 02:50:32.678]  The good bacteria with the probiotic.
[02:50:32.678 --> 02:50:38.499]  The MycoZX to knock out the yeast, the Candida, the mold, which then takes over when you've had bad bacteria in there.
[02:50:38.499 --> 02:50:45.660]  And then, of course, getting all that meat out with that meat diet, which has a lot of benefits, but a lot of bad things in the upper and lower intestine.
[02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:46.841]  You know, we love meat.
[02:50:46.841 --> 02:50:47.501]  I'm all about meat.
[02:50:48.697 --> 02:50:52.519]  Truth is, we have really high meat diets and it's got some bad side effects.
[02:50:52.519 --> 02:50:54.761]  And carnivore literally is incredible.
[02:50:54.761 --> 02:51:09.009]  So get those today at mfulwarsstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and ask for the buy DNA force 50% off and get a free bottle of carnivore today.
[02:51:09.009 --> 02:51:11.951]  You can read all the great reviews at mfulwarslife.com.
[02:51:13.772 --> 02:51:14.973]  I don't really think that's true.
[02:51:14.973 --> 02:51:20.456]  I want to just ramp up sales so high that even if we're making 20-30% on stuff, we can still pay the bills.
[02:51:40.077 --> 02:51:43.719]  Whether it's the toothpaste, or whether it's the cloyal silver, it's all excellent.
[02:51:43.719 --> 02:51:45.819]  The fish oil, the krill oil, it's all amazing.
[02:51:45.819 --> 02:51:48.400]  A lot of other specials as well, so be sure and check those out.
[02:51:48.400 --> 02:51:51.202]  And I thank you all for making the transmission possible.
[02:51:51.202 --> 02:51:53.543]  And I also thank Matt Drudge, as usual.
[02:51:53.543 --> 02:51:58.325]  But it is important that Ilhan Omar says, well, the UN runs everything around the world and runs borders.
[02:51:58.325 --> 02:51:59.225]  Why don't they run it here?
[02:51:59.225 --> 02:52:05.067]  I want the UN to get rid of our borders and take over and build refugee centers here to bring more in faster.
[02:52:05.067 --> 02:52:06.248]  That's a UN plan.
[02:52:06.248 --> 02:52:08.969]  Thank God Drudge thinks that's important and linked to it.
[02:52:10.965 --> 02:52:13.546]  It could not be more important, because it's the rest of the story.
[02:52:13.546 --> 02:52:18.967]  It's not just Ilhan Omar saying that.
[02:52:18.967 --> 02:52:19.727]  Ooh, I want that.
[02:52:19.727 --> 02:52:20.787]  Grab that.
[02:52:20.787 --> 02:52:24.848]  Trump confronted by Fox hosts about criticizing the network.
[02:52:24.848 --> 02:52:28.229]  Except for four or five hosts on there, it's backstabbing.
[02:52:28.229 --> 02:52:30.449]  Its polls are fake.
[02:52:30.449 --> 02:52:32.510]  It's run by a bunch of globalists.
[02:52:33.444 --> 02:52:37.786]  And so yeah, Trump better watch out because they're planning to have him unelected.
[02:52:37.786 --> 02:52:39.867]  They're planning to steal that election.
[02:52:39.867 --> 02:52:47.149]  CNN has a big article out about, don't be so sure 2020 that Trump's gonna lose because he might steal it.
[02:52:47.149 --> 02:52:52.291]  They're getting you ready for a contested election.
[02:52:52.291 --> 02:52:54.632]  Okay, let's get to the big story.
[02:52:54.632 --> 02:52:59.734]  The story is so important, it's up on infowars.com, newswars.com.
[02:52:59.734 --> 02:53:01.235]  Starting about a month ago,
[02:53:03.004 --> 02:53:09.428]  I started talking to folks that are dog lovers, and they're saying, yeah, have you heard about all the dogs dying that drink out of the Colorado River?
[02:53:09.428 --> 02:53:10.409]  It's dammed up in Austin.
[02:53:10.409 --> 02:53:12.170]  They call it Lady Bird Lake.
[02:53:12.170 --> 02:53:17.153]  But really, it's just an extension of the Highland Lake chains that are the Colorado River.
[02:53:17.153 --> 02:53:18.154]  And I said, no.
[02:53:18.154 --> 02:53:29.982]  So a couple weeks later, I started seeing articles about this blue-green algae, and the dogs stir up the bank, they drink it, and it kills them deader than a hammer.
[02:53:31.144 --> 02:53:40.246]  Well, my wife swam in Lake Travis about a month ago and got an infection in her throat and another infection.
[02:53:40.246 --> 02:53:44.147]  Both my daughters got earaches and sore throats.
[02:53:44.147 --> 02:53:46.788]  I like to go and swim, so I started swimming more.
[02:53:46.788 --> 02:53:50.129]  But the lake got up to 90 degrees in the afternoon.
[02:53:50.129 --> 02:53:51.429]  It's a petri dish.
[02:53:51.429 --> 02:53:54.010]  And then a bunch of my friends got sick.
[02:53:54.010 --> 02:53:58.231]  And then Drew was swimming in the creek that's real popular, Barton Creek.
[02:53:58.911 --> 02:54:01.652]  It's been raining a lot, but still, it's like bathwater.
[02:54:01.652 --> 02:54:06.213]  He got sick, like some kind of stuff eating his skin.
[02:54:06.213 --> 02:54:12.294]  Kellan has his ears swole shut from the Colorado River.
[02:54:12.294 --> 02:54:14.795]  He was up even higher, where it's actually called the Colorado.
[02:54:14.795 --> 02:54:16.495]  And so, this is serious.
[02:54:16.495 --> 02:54:27.578]  And just like we know 5G and 4G before that is causing cancer, just like we know stuff's going on, this is something that needs to be discussed, because every year in Texas,
[02:54:28.922 --> 02:54:35.207]  You don't want to swim when it's 110 degrees and you see little things swimming on the top of the water with little white specks.
[02:54:35.207 --> 02:54:36.788]  Those are amoebas.
[02:54:36.788 --> 02:54:46.716]  And every year there's at least two deaths in Lake Travis where an amoeba gets up into the sinus, reproduces, eats through the sinus wall, and eats your brain.
[02:54:46.716 --> 02:54:48.397]  There are dozens of deaths a year from it.
[02:54:48.397 --> 02:54:54.862]  Now this isn't amoebas, but they think it's bacteria that are actually growing on the blue-green
[02:54:56.878 --> 02:54:58.499]  We're good to go.
[02:55:21.286 --> 02:55:25.193]  Until the end of September, I'm not getting in any water in Texas.
[02:55:25.193 --> 02:55:26.535]  And I wouldn't get it in the South either.
[02:55:26.535 --> 02:55:29.720]  This is happening all over the country.
[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:31.964]  Dog deaths across the U.S.
[02:55:31.964 --> 02:55:34.649]  linked to toxic blue-green algae in lakes and ponds.
[02:55:36.101 --> 02:55:39.662]  This is an emergency health alert to canines nationwide.
[02:55:39.662 --> 02:55:44.923]  But I would also, again, tell humans, just do not go in the water.
[02:55:44.923 --> 02:55:51.064]  I won't get in the Texas Gulf when it's 100 degrees out, because the few times I've gotten infections, it's been in there.
[02:55:51.064 --> 02:55:56.325]  And I'm not a germaphobe either, but you start getting something eating your skin off, it's not fun.
[02:55:56.325 --> 02:56:02.106]  From Oregon to Maine, from Minnesota to Texas, beloved pets are dying after swimming in lakes and ponds.
[02:56:02.106 --> 02:56:05.547]  Stories are emerging nationwide of dogs who took a dip and died moments later.
[02:56:06.585 --> 02:56:08.386]  Moments later, in some cases.
[02:56:08.386 --> 02:56:16.288]  And local governments are advising against pets swim in bodies of water which may be contaminated with toxic blue-green algae in Austin, Texas.
[02:56:16.288 --> 02:56:17.509]  And this is what the news admits.
[02:56:17.509 --> 02:56:18.289]  It's hundreds, folks.
[02:56:18.289 --> 02:56:20.550]  Most people I know, it's happened to.
[02:56:20.550 --> 02:56:30.153]  Dogs have died after swimming in Lady Bird Lake with the deaths attributed to the algae blooms being found across the U.S.
[02:56:30.153 --> 02:56:32.633]  And then it just goes on from there.
[02:56:32.633 --> 02:56:33.934]  But here's why this is so important.
[02:56:34.767 --> 02:56:36.528]  It's never been this bad.
[02:56:36.528 --> 02:56:37.788]  There's always been amoeba deaths.
[02:56:37.788 --> 02:56:40.309]  There's always been deaths from toxic stuff in the water.
[02:56:40.309 --> 02:56:44.891]  But it's much worse, not just in the South, but in places like Maine and Minnesota.
[02:56:44.891 --> 02:56:46.071]  They've never seen things like this.
[02:56:46.071 --> 02:56:49.472]  So what's in our environment that's triggering all this?
[02:56:49.472 --> 02:56:50.753]  Well, the GMO.
[02:56:50.753 --> 02:56:51.973]  The mutations.
[02:56:51.973 --> 02:56:54.874]  The cell towers are mutating cells.
[02:56:54.874 --> 02:56:56.755]  The radiation released from Fukushima.
[02:56:56.755 --> 02:56:59.716]  The Earth is getting more toxic and it's very serious.
[02:56:59.716 --> 02:57:01.637]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:01.637 --> 02:57:02.177]  Stay with us.
[02:57:06.121 --> 02:57:07.442]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[02:57:07.442 --> 02:57:08.202]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[02:57:08.202 --> 02:57:08.782]  Thanks for holding.
[02:57:08.782 --> 02:57:09.303]  Hey, Alex.
[02:57:09.303 --> 02:57:12.144]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[02:57:12.144 --> 02:57:18.248]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[02:57:18.248 --> 02:57:26.933]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[02:57:26.933 --> 02:57:27.633]  That's it.
[02:57:27.633 --> 02:57:30.875]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[02:57:30.875 --> 02:57:33.716]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[02:57:33.716 --> 02:57:34.997]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[02:57:35.157 --> 02:57:35.917]  I agree entirely.
[02:57:35.917 --> 02:57:41.360]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:44.161]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[02:57:44.161 --> 02:57:46.222]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[02:57:46.222 --> 02:57:55.467]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[02:57:55.467 --> 02:57:57.367]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[02:57:57.367 --> 02:58:03.850]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[02:58:03.850 --> 02:58:04.791]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[02:58:08.251 --> 02:58:24.812]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[02:58:24.932 --> 02:58:29.013]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[02:58:29.013 --> 02:58:32.695]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[02:58:32.695 --> 02:58:34.455]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[02:58:34.455 --> 02:58:38.676]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[02:58:38.676 --> 02:58:46.459]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been to the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[02:58:46.539 --> 02:58:48.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:59:25.533 --> 02:59:30.414]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:59:30.414 --> 02:59:32.195]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:32.195 --> 02:59:34.655]  It's the fourth hour, always with an amazing guest host.
[02:59:34.655 --> 02:59:36.355]  Sometimes I commandeer it.
[02:59:36.355 --> 02:59:40.336]  He shot this video on August 23rd from Hong Kong.
[02:59:40.336 --> 02:59:43.157]  Now, six days later, it's coming true.
[02:59:43.157 --> 02:59:45.617]  China's plan for Hong Kong invasion revealed.
[02:59:45.617 --> 02:59:49.498]  Let me show you the bridge they'd invade on, and now it's happened.
[02:59:49.498 --> 02:59:51.739]  Gregory, Savannah, Hernandez.
[02:59:51.739 --> 02:59:52.899]  They are suiting up.
[02:59:53.539 --> 02:59:55.801]  And they're ready, coming in in the next segment.
[02:59:55.801 --> 03:00:02.726]  Please, share the links to InfoWars.com forward slash show and promote all the great shows that we have here for you.
[03:00:02.726 --> 03:00:06.768]  The War Room with Owen Schroeder, David Knight, and so much more.
[03:00:06.768 --> 03:00:09.530]  Okay.
[03:00:09.530 --> 03:00:10.591]  I meant to get to this yesterday.
[03:00:10.591 --> 03:00:14.214]  I didn't get to it, but I was watching it again last night.
[03:00:14.214 --> 03:00:17.176]  And let's start rolling the video for TV viewers.
[03:00:17.176 --> 03:00:22.680]  It was this Tampa, Florida event where you have this teenager who admittedly was on psychotropic drugs.
[03:00:23.662 --> 03:00:27.623]  I saw it, I said, I bet he's on psychotropics, he was.
[03:00:27.623 --> 03:00:35.784]  He just killed his sister and his niece, his brother, it was a Major League Baseball prospect, older brother.
[03:00:35.784 --> 03:00:48.167]  And then he attacks the groundskeeper, we'll show people this footage, and begins humping him like a demon and going, and making demon faces and trying to strangle him, okay?
[03:00:48.167 --> 03:00:51.048]  Now, he also before was chasing the police around.
[03:00:51.048 --> 03:00:52.908]  Now, folks.
[03:00:54.363 --> 03:00:56.164]  And the ancients would call this demon possession.
[03:00:56.164 --> 03:00:59.746]  And it's getting worse, it's popping up more places.
[03:00:59.746 --> 03:01:01.646]  It's out of control.
[03:01:01.646 --> 03:01:13.292]  And when people go on these serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or these so-called antidepressants, the insert says, can make you kill yourself or kill others, can make you have delusions of grandeur.
[03:01:13.292 --> 03:01:15.713]  And almost every shooter has been on this.
[03:01:15.713 --> 03:01:18.374]  Can we back that up and maybe slow it down and blow it up?
[03:01:18.374 --> 03:01:19.315]  When you look at his face,
[03:01:20.504 --> 03:01:26.551]  He is what you call demon possessed, or his lower brain has taken over if you want to be scientific and say that's it.
[03:01:26.551 --> 03:01:29.694]  But this is why we have guns.
[03:01:29.694 --> 03:01:36.802]  And I got to tell you, if the economy goes south, this whole country is going to be a time bomb.
[03:01:36.802 --> 03:01:40.186]  Crime is exploding all over the country.
[03:01:41.408 --> 03:01:42.468]  And it's getting worse.
[03:01:42.468 --> 03:01:44.389]  And the robberies are getting worse.
[03:01:44.389 --> 03:01:49.251]  Everybody I know is getting robbed or knows someone that's been robbed in the last couple months.
[03:01:49.251 --> 03:01:50.711]  Muggings are up.
[03:01:50.711 --> 03:01:52.392]  Even in areas that people are armed.
[03:01:52.392 --> 03:02:00.595]  I see stacks of news every day where women protect themselves from rapists and intruders, where people stop killers.
[03:02:00.595 --> 03:02:02.316]  I mean, I don't even get to those stories.
[03:02:02.316 --> 03:02:04.997]  Thank God we've got the Second Amendment.
[03:02:04.997 --> 03:02:05.777]  And it's better to be
[03:02:07.478 --> 03:02:10.920]  Judged by nine and carried by six.
[03:02:10.920 --> 03:02:16.403]  Better to have them catch you with a gun you're not supposed to have and have a jury trial than be killed.
[03:02:16.403 --> 03:02:23.046]  And Americans need to get guns, need to learn how to use them, and need to get serious, need to start watching your butt.
[03:02:23.046 --> 03:02:24.867]  Because there's a lot of dangerous stuff going on.
[03:02:24.867 --> 03:02:28.209]  Also, Apple knows they've been in bed with the Chai-coms for a long time.
[03:02:29.452 --> 03:02:34.275]  And Google's now having its undersea cable with China.
[03:02:34.275 --> 03:02:36.036]  Completion cut off by the federal government.
[03:02:36.036 --> 03:02:38.538]  They're saying, you're not going to hook that up to the United States.
[03:02:38.538 --> 03:02:41.320]  We're in a proxy war with China.
[03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:47.264]  And MarketWatch is reporting Apple CEO Tim Cook sells millions in Apple stock.
[03:02:47.264 --> 03:02:50.005]  Cook sold 265,000 Apple shares for $54.7 million, an average price of $206.
[03:02:50.005 --> 03:02:50.766]  He sold stock at requiring
[03:02:59.607 --> 03:03:04.752]  560,000 Apple shares in August through restricted stock units that vested.
[03:03:04.752 --> 03:03:09.796]  Apple withheld 294,000 shares to satisfy tax withholding requirements for the vet.
[03:03:09.796 --> 03:03:16.581]  So he's starting to dump on his stocks so he can get whatever drug it is he takes to make his people's giant.
[03:03:16.581 --> 03:03:19.364]  This is another traitorous dirtbag.
[03:03:19.364 --> 03:03:27.751]  Also MSNBC's O'Donnell retracts Trump's story after Trump prepares to file suit on him, claiming that Deutsche Bank said that Trump's funded by Putin.
[03:03:28.817 --> 03:03:35.279]  Well, O'Donnell is, again, a miscreant liar with no ratings who literally pulled that out of his rear end.
[03:03:35.279 --> 03:03:38.941]  He just keeps hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering with the propaganda.
[03:03:38.941 --> 03:03:42.862]  And then we hammer him with the truth and he says, stop the hammering!
[03:03:42.862 --> 03:03:44.143]  Well, guess what, buddy boy?
[03:03:44.143 --> 03:03:46.684]  We're not going to stop the hammering.
[03:03:46.684 --> 03:03:47.904]  We're going to come back.
[03:03:47.904 --> 03:03:49.305]  I see her in there.
[03:03:49.305 --> 03:03:52.686]  Savannah Hernandez, Greg Reese, they're getting ready.
[03:03:52.686 --> 03:03:56.908]  And they shot those reports saying the Chinese invasion was imminent on the 23rd.
[03:03:58.393 --> 03:04:00.515]  That's just six days ago.
[03:04:00.515 --> 03:04:02.856]  And boy, look at Gregg Reese in there.
[03:04:02.856 --> 03:04:04.578]  Looking sharp!
[03:04:04.578 --> 03:04:06.319]  He's ready!
[03:04:06.319 --> 03:04:07.480]  We're ready!
[03:04:07.480 --> 03:04:08.901]  And they're taking over!
[03:04:08.901 --> 03:04:12.764]  And in the war room with the one and the only Owen Sharp!
[03:04:15.683 --> 03:04:17.685]  Robert Morris, what has Big Tech become?
[03:04:17.685 --> 03:04:19.726]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[03:04:19.726 --> 03:04:26.231]  And the way they did so is because they faced no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[03:04:26.231 --> 03:04:38.300]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[03:04:38.300 --> 03:04:39.481]  Otherwise, they will never change.
[03:04:39.741 --> 03:04:42.103]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[03:05:09.701 --> 03:05:11.484]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[03:05:11.484 --> 03:05:13.407]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[03:05:13.407 --> 03:05:14.628]  Even it is what you just saw.
[03:05:31.434 --> 03:05:36.157]  This is Greg Reese reporting from mainland China for InfoWars.com.
[03:05:36.157 --> 03:05:40.419]  Behind me here is the start of the HKZM Bridge.
[03:05:40.419 --> 03:05:52.667]  Opened less than one year ago, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is 34 miles long, consisting of three cable-stayed bridges, an undersea tunnel, and four artificial islands.
[03:05:52.667 --> 03:05:55.648]  It is the longest open-sea fixed link on Earth.
[03:05:55.648 --> 03:05:58.090]  The bridge links the mainland to Hong Kong.
[03:05:58.670 --> 03:06:02.773]  This is the bridge the Chai Kams are going to use to invade Hong Kong.
[03:06:02.773 --> 03:06:13.380]  Reporter Savannah Hernandez is reporting on the upcoming elections that are already fixed, where only one candidate who stands for Beijing rule over Macau is set to win the election.
[03:06:13.380 --> 03:06:17.583]  First comes Macau, second comes Hong Kong, and this is the breach.
[03:06:20.936 --> 03:06:30.526]  After World War II, we saw the rise of communism in the Soviet Union and in the People's Republic of China.
[03:06:30.526 --> 03:06:40.116]  In 1949, the Chinese Communist Revolution, led by Party Chairman Mao Zedong, was responsible for the murder of over a hundred million Chinese.
[03:06:42.356 --> 03:06:55.866]  Millions of others fled the mainland into Taiwan and Hong Kong, which as a result, grew into thriving societies as mainland China plunged into darkness.
[03:06:55.866 --> 03:07:03.692]  2019, the 70-year anniversary of the Communist Revolution, and despite its horrors, communism continues to spread.
[03:07:05.541 --> 03:07:14.409]  The People's Republic is a model for globalized governance, and the Communist Chinese are now looking to absorb those who fled 70 years ago.
[03:07:14.409 --> 03:07:26.520]  100,000 troops of the CHICOM's paramilitary PAF are now training on the border of these autonomous cities, preparing for an invasion.
[03:07:29.966 --> 03:07:38.131]  And the people of Hong Kong are united against this tyrannical cancer.
[03:07:38.131 --> 03:07:42.334]  Right behind me is mainland China, separated by this small waterway.
[03:07:42.334 --> 03:07:53.521]  With over 100,000 troops already amassed, set to invade, only a fraction of the people's armed force, the Chi-Coms are preparing for Tiananmen Square 2.0.
[03:07:53.521 --> 03:07:58.144]  Reporting from mainland China, for InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[03:08:32.964 --> 03:08:33.864]  Welcome back.
[03:08:33.864 --> 03:08:36.525]  This is Greg Reese with Savannah Hernandez.
[03:08:36.525 --> 03:08:42.727]  We just returned from Hong Kong about a day ago, really, and our hearts are still there.
[03:08:42.727 --> 03:08:46.969]  And we're not at all surprised to hear about troops crossing in.
[03:08:46.969 --> 03:08:51.831]  We didn't really think it would happen this soon, but we knew it was going to happen in the next month.
[03:08:51.831 --> 03:08:52.331]  And it's
[03:08:53.271 --> 03:08:58.332]  Chilling, when I saw the video played on the Alex Jones Show today of the troops crossing that bridge.
[03:08:58.332 --> 03:09:08.774]  That bridge was first proposed in 88, and a year later when Tiananmen Square happened, they halted the discussions of it.
[03:09:08.774 --> 03:09:14.155]  1997, when the United Kingdom returned Hong Kong to China, they began discussing and planning the bridge again.
[03:09:14.155 --> 03:09:21.817]  They began construction in 2008, which is just a couple years after the first protests began in Hong Kong.
[03:09:23.167 --> 03:09:30.190]  2005, they had a march for pro-democracy and the abolishment of appointed district councils.
[03:09:30.190 --> 03:09:31.931]  The bridge was completed less than a year ago.
[03:09:31.931 --> 03:09:43.036]  The protests began early this year, and then now we have thousands of troops crossing the bridge, a 30-minute commute from the mainland into Hong Kong.
[03:09:43.036 --> 03:09:47.177]  And the protesters know what they're up against.
[03:09:47.177 --> 03:09:50.539]  This is really the central happening
[03:09:51.528 --> 03:09:54.051]  In the global awakening.
[03:09:54.051 --> 03:09:54.973]  Right next door to China.
[03:09:57.011 --> 03:10:01.992]  Now Greg, we actually went to Macau when we were in Hong Kong for this past week.
[03:10:01.992 --> 03:10:10.975]  And again, I do want to say a quick thank you to all of our supporters that went to Infowarsstore.com and helped support us and get us over to Hong Kong and allow us to stay over there.
[03:10:10.975 --> 03:10:14.376]  But we went to Macau while we were over there and we did those special reports.
[03:10:14.376 --> 03:10:25.079]  We actually saw that bridge and you were talking about how, like you just said, that connects mainland China to Hong Kong and it's going to be a central point in mainland China invading this city.
[03:10:25.439 --> 03:10:26.879]  These stories just came out today.
[03:10:26.879 --> 03:10:31.500]  China sends fresh troops into Hong Kong as military pledges to protect national sovereignty.
[03:10:31.500 --> 03:10:32.801]  Vice came out with this article.
[03:10:32.801 --> 03:10:35.361]  Chinese military vehicles just entered Hong Kong.
[03:10:35.361 --> 03:10:38.082]  Beijing says there's nothing to worry about.
[03:10:38.082 --> 03:10:44.343]  They talk about how there's armored vehicles, armored helicopters going into the city.
[03:10:44.343 --> 03:10:48.964]  So, of course, this is something that we've been reporting on for the past week.
[03:10:48.964 --> 03:10:51.185]  What do you make of all of this, Greg?
[03:10:51.185 --> 03:10:52.405]  I mean, are you surprised to see
[03:10:53.945 --> 03:10:55.246]  China invading?
[03:10:55.246 --> 03:10:56.167]  No, I'm not surprised.
[03:10:56.167 --> 03:10:58.189]  I mean, when we were there, and I don't think any of them are surprised.
[03:10:58.189 --> 03:11:02.953]  Everyone we talked to over there, they kind of knew that they were up against the Chinese government.
[03:11:02.953 --> 03:11:07.577]  They knew the Chinese government was not going to allow them to continue the protests.
[03:11:07.577 --> 03:11:09.458]  And that's really the whole purpose of the protests.
[03:11:09.458 --> 03:11:14.042]  They get criticized a lot for being violent, but they know exactly what they're doing.
[03:11:14.042 --> 03:11:15.023]  They're very smart.
[03:11:15.023 --> 03:11:18.786]  And what they're doing is they're forcing China's hand.
[03:11:18.786 --> 03:11:21.249]  They know that their only hope is
[03:11:22.614 --> 03:11:30.316]  A conflict which will hopefully create some type of global outrage and people will come to their defense.
[03:11:30.316 --> 03:11:31.917]  And you have to admire them for that.
[03:11:31.917 --> 03:11:33.617]  They're not taking a knee.
[03:11:33.617 --> 03:11:40.179]  Those that are rising up in defiance of the police are the heroes of the Hong Kong people.
[03:11:40.179 --> 03:11:41.199]  It's their only hope.
[03:11:41.199 --> 03:11:41.439]  Right.
[03:11:41.439 --> 03:11:43.100]  And you and I actually saw a video.
[03:11:43.100 --> 03:11:50.562]  I don't know if we put it in the show folder for today, but there was a clip that we saw and it was protesters walking in a line in a mall in Hong Kong.
[03:11:50.962 --> 03:11:53.524]  And all of the citizens around them begin clapping for them.
[03:11:53.524 --> 03:11:57.748]  And you and I were talking about just how beautiful that video was, how chilling it was.
[03:11:57.748 --> 03:12:03.793]  You were talking to me about how there's a small percent of the population willing to stand up.
[03:12:03.793 --> 03:12:10.198]  And these are the people in Hong Kong willing to stand up right now, willing to die for this cause.
[03:12:10.198 --> 03:12:13.060]  We were actually just watching a Vice News piece as well.
[03:12:13.060 --> 03:12:16.944]  And many protesters have come forward and said, we're willing to die for this cause.
[03:12:16.944 --> 03:12:19.165]  I was actually watching a video this morning too.
[03:12:19.986 --> 03:12:23.989]  And this is clip four on this list if you guys want to just roll that as b-roll.
[03:12:23.989 --> 03:12:26.691]  Protesters are getting tattoos now.
[03:12:26.691 --> 03:12:45.223]  A local tattoo artist in Hong Kong, I believe he's 28 years old, he's giving protesters free tattoos and it is both the emblem of the Hong Kong flag and the umbrella and they're basically saying we're getting these tattoos because when you get a tattoo it really shows you like you can't go back on it you know and it's there forever.
[03:12:45.783 --> 03:12:48.085]  Just like we are going to be with this protest.
[03:12:48.085 --> 03:12:49.005]  We're going to stay with it.
[03:12:49.005 --> 03:12:53.048]  We're going to stick with the protest until the five demands that we requested are met.
[03:12:53.048 --> 03:12:58.392]  So I think that's a beautiful thing and we really have seen the resilience of the citizens of the protesters when we were over there.
[03:12:59.264 --> 03:13:00.385]  This is the spirit.
[03:13:00.385 --> 03:13:05.009]  This is the only thing that's gonna save us from tyranny is this type of fighting spirit.
[03:13:05.009 --> 03:13:13.916]  And you know the rest of the world, a lot of the Western world, we've been like frogs slowly boiling in water to the point where we're willing to accept whatever they hand us.
[03:13:13.916 --> 03:13:17.299]  But what I learned when I was in Hong Kong is they don't seem to have that
[03:13:19.156 --> 03:13:20.716]  Handicap that we do.
[03:13:20.716 --> 03:13:23.797]  They seem to be well aware of what they're up against.
[03:13:23.797 --> 03:13:26.498]  They're well aware of their limited freedom.
[03:13:26.498 --> 03:13:29.118]  I asked many people, do you want independence?
[03:13:29.118 --> 03:13:32.079]  Do you want some sort of Constitution, Second Amendment?
[03:13:32.079 --> 03:13:34.920]  And pretty much everyone's answer was no.
[03:13:34.920 --> 03:13:35.740]  They were very realistic.
[03:13:35.740 --> 03:13:37.060]  They just wanted justice.
[03:13:37.060 --> 03:13:39.101]  They said they wanted something in between.
[03:13:39.101 --> 03:13:41.221]  Mainly, they just want to remain Hong Kong.
[03:13:41.221 --> 03:13:44.022]  They want to remain the way that they've always been.
[03:13:45.695 --> 03:13:48.337]  And they don't want communist China there.
[03:13:48.337 --> 03:13:48.577]  Right.
[03:13:48.577 --> 03:13:52.039]  And we talked about, too, how Hong Kong was set to have their autonomy.
[03:13:52.039 --> 03:13:55.941]  They had a deal in 1997 when they were handed back over to mainland China.
[03:13:55.941 --> 03:13:58.743]  However, they were set to have autonomy for 50 years.
[03:13:58.743 --> 03:14:06.707]  And, of course, a lot of people are feeling that this extradition bill that was introduced was mainland China beginning to impede upon their autonomy ahead of that 2047 deadline date.
[03:14:08.228 --> 03:14:08.308]  Yes.
[03:14:27.236 --> 03:14:31.638]  Basically, their chief executive is elected by Beijing.
[03:14:31.638 --> 03:14:34.078]  And it's similar to Hong Kong here.
[03:14:34.078 --> 03:14:35.739]  Carrie Lam is our chief executive.
[03:14:35.739 --> 03:14:37.279]  She's pro-Beijing.
[03:14:37.279 --> 03:14:41.761]  And Beijing is the one that allows who really gets elected, who's allowed to run these cities.
[03:14:41.761 --> 03:14:43.822]  So this is something that's been going on for a long time.
[03:14:43.822 --> 03:14:50.824]  And I think these protests are just the rest of the world finally waking up to the fact that China is really taking over and trying to take the autonomy.
[03:14:50.984 --> 03:14:51.585]  Well, that's right.
[03:14:51.585 --> 03:14:59.474]  And in the 2005 protests, one of their big things was they wanted the abolishment of appointed district councils because they knew that Beijing was entering their government that way.
[03:14:59.474 --> 03:15:02.638]  They knew that they were getting pro-China officials back then.
[03:15:02.638 --> 03:15:07.824]  So this has been going on for a long time and it's all playing out right now.
[03:15:07.824 --> 03:15:09.046]  We'll be back after this break.
[03:15:10.020 --> 03:15:14.042]  This is a major exciting moment in the global awakening.

[03:16:44.696 --> 03:16:48.617]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:48.617 --> 03:16:50.137]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:50.137 --> 03:16:53.098]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:53.098 --> 03:16:58.659]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:58.659 --> 03:16:59.859]  I can help you, too.

[03:18:14.580 --> 03:18:18.765]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[03:18:18.765 --> 03:18:19.826]  They are technocrats.
[03:18:19.826 --> 03:18:22.149]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[03:18:22.149 --> 03:18:29.016]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life, make your own decisions, gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[03:18:29.497 --> 03:18:31.338]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[03:18:31.338 --> 03:18:33.819]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[03:18:33.819 --> 03:18:40.301]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[03:18:40.301 --> 03:18:45.503]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[03:18:45.503 --> 03:18:54.507]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical modelment and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.

[03:19:12.420 --> 03:19:13.801]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:42.492 --> 03:19:49.553]  We are back with Greg Reese and Savannah Hernandez, fresh off the plane from Hong Kong.
[03:19:49.553 --> 03:20:00.515]  Here today we're now, thousands of the People's Liberation Army of China are now entering Hong Kong via the HKZM bridge and Chinese naval vessels.
[03:20:00.515 --> 03:20:06.797]  About a month ahead of the October 1st, 70th anniversary of Communist China.
[03:20:06.797 --> 03:20:08.977]  Now we were down there talking to a lot of the protesters,
[03:20:10.442 --> 03:20:11.964]  We got tear gassed.
[03:20:11.964 --> 03:20:15.827]  We witnessed people get hit with rubber bullets.
[03:20:15.827 --> 03:20:25.535]  And the spirit that we saw there in that fight was extremely moving, especially being Americans.
[03:20:25.535 --> 03:20:28.597]  We have our own problems and we're so divided in this country.
[03:20:28.597 --> 03:20:36.164]  It was such an unexpected treat to witness a united people like Hong Kong.
[03:20:37.284 --> 03:20:48.010]  Definitely Greg and I was actually talking to Owen too yesterday about how surprising it was to see all of the citizens who weren't protesting but were supporting all of the people who were out there standing up for Hong Kong.
[03:20:48.010 --> 03:20:56.254]  People were handing out water, they were handing out snacks, they were giving other protesters rides home after all of the events for the day.
[03:20:56.254 --> 03:21:02.598]  So there's such a sense of everyone being united in that city and it was a beautiful thing to see something that
[03:21:02.998 --> 03:21:09.460]  I don't think we've commonly seen here in America and that was very foreign to us just because there's so much internal conflict here.
[03:21:10.575 --> 03:21:22.980]  Yes, there was one moment on the Sunday protests where I saw a bunch of elderly people holding hands and they were blocking in an entrance way that behind them was a bunch of young protesters.
[03:21:22.980 --> 03:21:25.181]  And I didn't really know what I was seeing at first.
[03:21:25.181 --> 03:21:30.783]  And then there was the police were yelling at the protesters behind the people and the people were calling other people to hold hands.
[03:21:30.783 --> 03:21:38.086]  And then later that day, I spoke to a Hong Konger and they mentioned to me what they say translates into English as the gray haired squad.
[03:21:39.210 --> 03:21:47.778]  And she said that it's a lot of the elderly and Hong Kongers that show up to these marches wearing yellow vests and they hold hands and they try to protect the young protesters.
[03:21:47.778 --> 03:21:54.265]  So it is the entire city of Hong Kong standing in solidarity.
[03:21:54.577 --> 03:21:58.379]  Right, and I think we saw people of all ages as well at those protests.
[03:21:58.379 --> 03:22:07.483]  During the peaceful marches, we saw a lot of young children, and then again at the end of the day when those protests started getting more violent, we saw the gray-haired squad come forward.
[03:22:07.483 --> 03:22:09.144]  We saw people of all ages.
[03:22:09.144 --> 03:22:14.727]  There was even a 16-year-old protester who I interviewed at one point who had gotten attacked.
[03:22:14.727 --> 03:22:18.269]  Not attacked, but he got hit by a tear gas canister.
[03:22:18.849 --> 03:22:19.870]  And it cut his leg open.
[03:22:19.870 --> 03:22:26.655]  So again, there's people from all different ages at these marches, at these protests, all standing up for Hong Kong.
[03:22:26.655 --> 03:22:29.197]  And we were actually at a protest on Saturday.
[03:22:29.197 --> 03:22:34.061]  And that was at Kwun Tong and that was the anti-surveillance protest.
[03:22:34.061 --> 03:22:36.603]  And we'll show you guys a little bit of B-roll from that.
[03:22:36.603 --> 03:22:38.224]  And it was really interesting to note that
[03:22:39.424 --> 03:22:50.069]  Um, we did see those lasers being used when we were there and this video actually came out that day too of citizens downing and the surveillance post in the city.
[03:22:50.069 --> 03:22:53.190]  This is actually at the protest that we were at on Saturday.
[03:22:53.190 --> 03:22:58.292]  Yeah, I think I read recently that the average IQ for a Hong Konger is about 108.
[03:22:58.292 --> 03:23:02.554]  And that's what we were, we were seeing a very clever
[03:23:03.476 --> 03:23:05.897]  Well thought out movement.
[03:23:05.897 --> 03:23:11.601]  They understand that they're not going to beat the police with umbrellas.
[03:23:11.601 --> 03:23:12.441]  They understand that.
[03:23:12.441 --> 03:23:18.325]  But what they also understand is that the only hope they have is to push them and to force and to resist them.
[03:23:19.125 --> 03:23:26.011]  I would imagine that the Hong Kong police aren't necessarily happy about what they're doing, but they're being forced by the communist Chinese.
[03:23:26.011 --> 03:23:27.953]  They seem to be working with the triad gangs.
[03:23:27.953 --> 03:23:37.141]  There's actual video footage of showing the police allowing triad gangs with weapons and communist flags enter into the group of protesters for violence, doing nothing.
[03:23:40.083 --> 03:23:42.865]  They know that if they can't stop it, the Chinese government's going to come in.
[03:23:42.865 --> 03:23:45.607]  The Chinese government's on their way right now.
[03:23:45.607 --> 03:23:56.235]  And so the protesters' main tactic, it seemed, was to resist the police and force the Chinese to come in, which is a very brave and noble tactic, I would say.
[03:23:56.835 --> 03:24:05.063]  And going back to that footage of the surveillance post being taken down, I thought that was extremely interesting because we've been reporting on the Chinese social credit score for a long time.
[03:24:05.063 --> 03:24:10.388]  We've also been reporting on the AI facial recognition software that they have in China.
[03:24:10.388 --> 03:24:12.470]  We know that's a really big thing there.
[03:24:12.470 --> 03:24:19.177]  I believe over 20 million people could not buy plane tickets in China because of that social credit score.
[03:24:19.437 --> 03:24:30.981]  So I think that this was an interesting example of how the people of Hong Kong are resisting that by taking down that surveillance post, by using those lasers which thwart the AI software.
[03:24:30.981 --> 03:24:39.283]  So that was a really interesting thing that we saw in response to mainland China starting to come into Hong Kong.
[03:24:39.283 --> 03:24:48.166]  Yeah, and it's a shame to see that our Western mainstream media and social media are now starting to paint these protesters as alt-right Nazis.
[03:24:49.312 --> 03:25:01.361]  I mean, it's not necessarily surprising, but in any other reality, these people would be celebrated worldwide for their bravery and for their spirit.
[03:25:01.361 --> 03:25:13.411]  And I know that they are amongst many people, but the other interesting thing there is while I was off, I was watching a lot of the mainstream news in Hong Kong, and even their mainstream media seems to be united with Hong Kong.
[03:25:13.411 --> 03:25:17.074]  It's really only the police working with the triad gangs,
[03:25:18.294 --> 03:25:22.098]  Both working for the Communist Chinese to try to shut this thing down.
[03:25:22.098 --> 03:25:31.767]  And now what I'm wondering right now as we see, you know, what was it, a couple hours ago I saw that video of the troops moving across the bridge.
[03:25:31.767 --> 03:25:32.548]  Gave me chills.
[03:25:32.548 --> 03:25:33.509]  I knew we were going to see it.
[03:25:33.509 --> 03:25:36.131]  I didn't expect to see it so soon.
[03:25:36.131 --> 03:25:39.455]  But I just can't help but think about what this weekend's going to be like there.
[03:25:40.302 --> 03:25:40.982]  Definitely.
[03:25:40.982 --> 03:25:45.164]  And again, this was the 12th week of protests in Hong Kong.
[03:25:45.164 --> 03:25:47.585]  And this was one of the most violent weekends.
[03:25:47.585 --> 03:25:49.266]  Water canyons were deployed.
[03:25:49.266 --> 03:25:56.190]  Of course, as we talked about, tear gas, rubber bullets were used, beanbag grenades, which you and I didn't see.
[03:25:56.190 --> 03:25:58.071]  We read reports about that.
[03:25:58.071 --> 03:26:00.232]  We experienced all that with the people there.
[03:26:00.232 --> 03:26:03.273]  And again, we stood in solidarity with the protesters.
[03:26:03.273 --> 03:26:04.454]  We marched with them.
[03:26:04.454 --> 03:26:06.955]  We were on the ground and we talked with them and asked them,
[03:26:07.515 --> 03:26:09.096]  What do these marches mean to you?
[03:26:09.096 --> 03:26:11.698]  What do these protests mean to you?
[03:26:11.698 --> 03:26:25.209]  And I did do a man on the street while we were over there as well and I talked to a couple of the protesters and I asked them, are there fears of people, of the protesters specifically being kidnapped by Beijing, being extradited to mainland China for protesting?
[03:26:25.209 --> 03:26:31.574]  And of course a lot of them came forward and they admitted to us that yes, this is a very real fear that many of them have.
[03:26:33.217 --> 03:26:40.581]  We got close enough up where I could see several of the faces of the Hong Kong police, and there was a lot of conflict, which is understandable.
[03:26:40.581 --> 03:26:43.442]  I mean, these are their own people.
[03:26:43.442 --> 03:26:47.364]  And, you know, we always wonder, like, could our own military turn against us?
[03:26:49.198 --> 03:26:57.422]  And I'm sure there would be a conflict there, but now we're talking about the Chinese military coming in and a lot of people think that the Hong Kongers and the Chinese are the same, but they're not.
[03:26:57.422 --> 03:27:03.604]  Most of the Hong Kongers we talk to, one of their biggest issues is that their culture is being changed by this mass immigration.
[03:27:03.604 --> 03:27:05.425]  Paul Joseph Watson was just talking about that.
[03:27:05.425 --> 03:27:11.147]  They're having the same sinister immigration policies that Europe has had.
[03:27:13.143 --> 03:27:25.919]  Thousands of Chinese coming into Hong Kong being able to take their jobs and being able to get benefits of the system and vote and so they are under threat now more than ever and I think
[03:27:27.304 --> 03:27:28.685]  This is happening worldwide.
[03:27:28.685 --> 03:27:29.666]  We see this everywhere.
[03:27:29.666 --> 03:27:30.847]  We see this in our own country.
[03:27:30.847 --> 03:27:32.308]  We see this through Europe.
[03:27:32.308 --> 03:27:39.533]  But to me, this is the pinnacle of everything because the Communist Chinese is the model for the new global government.
[03:27:39.533 --> 03:27:41.654]  It's the perfect model for the elites.
[03:27:41.654 --> 03:27:44.456]  The Hong Kongers probably know it better than anyone.
[03:27:44.456 --> 03:27:48.619]  And Hong Kong seems to be ground zero for everything that's happening in the world.
[03:27:50.340 --> 03:27:52.181]  Our prayers are with them.
[03:27:52.181 --> 03:27:54.182]  And thank you so much for supporting us.
[03:27:54.182 --> 03:28:00.405]  We're going to be talking about this a lot because what we did in Hong Kong would not have been possible if it wasn't for the support of our audience at InfoWarsStory.com.

[03:30:15.543 --> 03:30:28.736]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[03:30:28.736 --> 03:30:31.659]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[03:30:31.659 --> 03:30:33.421]  farming goods a week ago.
[03:30:33.421 --> 03:30:37.064]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[03:30:37.705 --> 03:30:42.250]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[03:30:42.250 --> 03:30:43.291]  That's beautiful.
[03:30:43.291 --> 03:30:45.192]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[03:30:45.192 --> 03:30:46.794]  And we aren't going to back down.

[03:32:28.444 --> 03:32:30.286]  He's going for speed!
[03:32:46.383 --> 03:32:50.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:32:50.000 --> 03:32:51.326]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:32:59.224 --> 03:32:59.785]  Welcome back.
[03:32:59.785 --> 03:33:05.972]  You are with Greg Reese and Savannah Hernandez talking about the latest developments in Hong Kong.
[03:33:05.972 --> 03:33:10.577]  We're about to talk about getting tear gassed in Hong Kong last week.
[03:33:10.577 --> 03:33:16.543]  And so before we do, we can talk about something that would have been very beneficial for a lot of people there right now.
[03:33:16.543 --> 03:33:19.447]  One of InfoWarsTore.com's great products.
[03:33:20.151 --> 03:33:29.159]  Yeah Greg, so I actually want to talk about one of our newest products which I'm actually very excited about because I'm always all about skin health and preventing wrinkles.
[03:33:29.159 --> 03:33:37.167]  So we have our new Super Silver Skin Cream at Infowarsstore.com and that is at 25% off the introductory price.
[03:33:37.167 --> 03:33:38.668]  So it is currently on sale for $14.95.
[03:33:40.450 --> 03:33:41.950]  And it comes in two scents.
[03:33:41.950 --> 03:33:48.412]  You can get it in an unscented version for, you know, those with sensitive skin or a grapefruit version.
[03:33:48.412 --> 03:33:50.772]  Now, this is the ultimate skin solution.
[03:33:50.772 --> 03:33:53.233]  It helps reduce wrinkles and it keeps your skin healthy.
[03:33:53.233 --> 03:33:56.814]  It kills dangerous viruses and bacteria that make you sick.
[03:33:56.814 --> 03:34:06.136]  Not only that, but it's infused with our patented Silver Soul technology that's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.
[03:34:06.716 --> 03:34:20.912]  Now, of course, unfortunately, over time, the hyaluronic acid contents of our skin slowly decreases as we age, and that's why the Super Silver Skin Cream also contains hyaluronic acid, a key compound that keeps our skin healthy, retain moisture, and protect from free radicals.
[03:34:21.653 --> 03:34:29.981]  And of course, unlike most skin creams, Super Silver Skin Cream is free of BPAs, paraben, harsh preservatives, and sulfates.
[03:34:29.981 --> 03:34:38.590]  Of course, we know that we're all about health here at InfoWars, so great and super exciting that this product is so great for our skin and so healthy for us.
[03:34:38.590 --> 03:34:42.473]  Independent studies have proven that Silver Soul Technology and Super Silver Skin Cream
[03:34:43.234 --> 03:34:50.820]  At just 20 ppm silver is up to 10 times more effective than similar products containing up to 3,000 ppm silver.
[03:34:50.820 --> 03:34:53.502]  So of course this stuff is the real deal.
[03:34:53.502 --> 03:34:58.365]  So get your super silver skin cream exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:34:58.365 --> 03:35:01.508]  Again 25% off the introductory price.
[03:35:01.508 --> 03:35:03.029]  You can get that on sale right now for $14.95.
[03:35:04.910 --> 03:35:14.754]  I know that I'm going to start using this product immediately, Greg, because, again, I'm always about fighting wrinkles, protecting my skin, especially after a week in Hong Kong, like you talked about.
[03:35:14.754 --> 03:35:20.237]  We got tear gassed, we were marching out in the sun for hours, and then we were marching out in the rain for hours.
[03:35:20.237 --> 03:35:28.801]  We were exposed to all of the harsh elements, so I'm really excited to use this product on my skin and have that protection that I so desperately need on my face.
[03:35:29.554 --> 03:35:37.147]  Yeah, and if you want to support the Hong Kong protesters, then you can buy a case of this and send it off to Hong Kong, where they'll surely appreciate it.
[03:35:37.147 --> 03:35:41.615]  I was just reading an article today how a lot of them are suffering skin problems, because if you watch these videos...
[03:35:42.438 --> 03:35:48.685]  They are prepared for the tear gas with gas masks, but their skin is exposed and they're bathing in it, basically.
[03:35:48.685 --> 03:35:53.069]  I mean, they were just popping off hundreds of canisters and they're not afraid.
[03:35:53.069 --> 03:35:59.136]  They're running right up to the canisters and pitching them up with badminton rackets, grabbing them with their hands, throwing them back at the police.
[03:35:59.136 --> 03:36:01.819]  And so they are suffering a lot of skin issues there.
[03:36:02.159 --> 03:36:08.301]  Not only that, but I was actually reading another article that stated that the tear gas is heavier than the air, so it sinks down.
[03:36:08.301 --> 03:36:12.402]  So even when you don't feel the effects of the tear gas there, it's still there.
[03:36:12.402 --> 03:36:18.164]  And a lot of young children are walking throughout the cities because, of course, these protests are taking place all over.
[03:36:18.164 --> 03:36:19.765]  And they're being affected by this.
[03:36:19.765 --> 03:36:21.025]  They'll break out in rashes.
[03:36:21.025 --> 03:36:24.826]  So even young children, of course, unfortunately, are being affected by this.
[03:36:26.687 --> 03:36:30.469]  A lot of our audience might not realize what a warrior Savannah Hernandez is.
[03:36:42.011 --> 03:36:43.812]  But I got to see it firsthand last week.
[03:36:43.812 --> 03:36:48.134]  I have the good fortune of being in the United States Marine Corps.
[03:36:48.134 --> 03:36:49.454]  Hoorah!
[03:36:49.454 --> 03:36:52.756]  And we were subjected to CS gas on a regular basis.
[03:36:52.756 --> 03:36:55.577]  They used to lock us in a room, fill the room with CS gas.
[03:36:55.577 --> 03:36:58.458]  We'd have to take our masks off until we started vomiting.
[03:36:58.458 --> 03:36:59.979]  And then they would open the doors to fresh air.
[03:36:59.979 --> 03:37:02.740]  We would do that quite a few times to get us used to it.
[03:37:02.740 --> 03:37:04.161]  So I've been there before.
[03:37:04.161 --> 03:37:04.981]  It's not pleasant.
[03:37:04.981 --> 03:37:06.542]  That was your first time getting tear gassed.
[03:37:06.542 --> 03:37:07.362]  What do you think about that?
[03:37:08.248 --> 03:37:09.549]  It definitely hurt a lot.
[03:37:09.549 --> 03:37:16.192]  I was, well, I told Rob Dew before we left that I was fully ready when we went to Hong Kong for anything that was going to happen.
[03:37:16.192 --> 03:37:19.254]  I just wanted to get the shot and I wanted to get our reports out.
[03:37:19.254 --> 03:37:27.539]  So being tear gassed was not fun at all, but I'm glad that we were able to go and again, experience what everyone in Hong Kong is experiencing there.
[03:37:27.539 --> 03:37:35.343]  So it was really, you know, on the ground coverage in depth and once in a lifetime experience for sure.
[03:37:35.759 --> 03:37:41.480]  Yeah, and one of our journalist friends that we were with got a big scar, I believe, right on their arm from a rubber bullet.
[03:37:41.480 --> 03:37:46.721]  It just grazed her, but it opened up her skin, a pretty ugly gash.
[03:37:46.721 --> 03:37:49.822]  It was a war zone there, at least as close as you could get to it.
[03:37:49.822 --> 03:37:57.323]  And it's going to get a lot worse now that the Chinese army is rolling in troops.
[03:37:57.323 --> 03:37:59.263]  It's hard to imagine how it's going to turn out.
[03:37:59.263 --> 03:38:01.464]  I mean, we're familiar with Tiananmen Square.
[03:38:01.464 --> 03:38:02.564]  We're familiar with Tibet.
[03:38:04.079 --> 03:38:14.387]  And you have to realize that Tibet and Tiananmen Square, these events were questioned and protested throughout the world, but not really that much.
[03:38:14.387 --> 03:38:18.691]  And not so much that the Chinese government has ever changed.
[03:38:18.691 --> 03:38:25.236]  So to think that we're not going to get another Tibet, that we're not going to get another Tiananmen Square is a childish notion.
[03:38:25.236 --> 03:38:27.638]  It's really hiding your head in the sand.
[03:38:27.638 --> 03:38:29.959]  We are on the verge of seeing perhaps
[03:38:30.982 --> 03:38:35.383]  One of the biggest slaughters in some people's lifetimes right now.
[03:38:35.383 --> 03:38:43.065]  It's chilling when I look at these video footage that they're playing right now of the Chinese army rolling into Hong Kong.
[03:38:43.065 --> 03:38:47.106]  And we actually have a military expert joining us now, Matt Bracken.
[03:38:47.106 --> 03:38:51.868]  What do you make of the Chinese military coming into Hong Kong?
[03:38:51.868 --> 03:38:56.769]  Give us some insight into what's going on here.
[03:38:56.769 --> 03:39:00.250]  First, I've been watching for the last few days and
[03:39:01.235 --> 03:39:11.163]  I salute you, Greg and Savannah and Paul Joseph Watson and the others behind the cameras that made it all possible.
[03:39:11.163 --> 03:39:14.105]  This is very emotional and I'm, you know, I'm a boomer.
[03:39:14.105 --> 03:39:16.026]  There's no doubt about it.
[03:39:16.026 --> 03:39:21.170]  And I was born in 57, which was a year after the Hungarian Revolution.
[03:39:21.170 --> 03:39:25.753]  During the 50s, America was very patriotic and very anti-communist.
[03:39:25.753 --> 03:39:27.715]  And when the Hungarians and other
[03:39:28.479 --> 03:39:33.143]  Very high IQ, organized society.
[03:39:33.143 --> 03:39:43.453]  They kind of took their cues from the USA and Voice of America, and they had a revolution against the Russian Soviet Communists that had occupied their country.
[03:39:43.453 --> 03:39:45.074]  And it was crushed.
[03:39:45.074 --> 03:39:46.555]  It was absolutely crushed.
[03:39:46.555 --> 03:39:48.777]  They were very smart, very brave.
[03:39:48.777 --> 03:39:52.080]  They had organized rat lines to get people out of Hungary.
[03:39:52.080 --> 03:39:52.421]  They had
[03:39:53.314 --> 03:40:03.817]  They even, they had their own pirate broadcasting and pirate newspapers during the short period in 56 of the Hungarian Revolution.
[03:40:03.817 --> 03:40:09.598]  They even attacked tanks with Molotov cocktails, which is like a self-sacrifice.
[03:40:09.598 --> 03:40:16.020]  You know, to run up to a tank in a tight city street, like Hong Kong, with just a Molotov cocktail.
[03:40:17.295 --> 03:40:23.801]  They put things like dinner plates on roads and covered them with dust, so it looked like maybe a landmine had been planted.
[03:40:23.801 --> 03:40:26.964]  Because they had no weapons, like Hong Kong.
[03:40:26.964 --> 03:40:38.514]  And a takeaway from the Hungarian Revolution was that, you know, people can be very gung-ho for freedom, but maybe then, in the final analysis, the Americans say, you know, there's nothing we can do.
[03:40:38.514 --> 03:40:41.416]  We're not going to start World War III for Hungary.
[03:40:41.416 --> 03:40:42.677]  Now, Hong Kong, in 2019,
[03:40:45.711 --> 03:40:49.152]  This is 30 years after Tiananmen Square.
[03:40:49.152 --> 03:40:52.194]  From the, going back to Hungary.
[03:40:52.194 --> 03:40:53.134]  Hungary was in 1956.
[03:40:53.134 --> 03:40:56.715]  The Soviets just crushed that revolution.
[03:40:56.715 --> 03:40:57.956]  Crushed it.
[03:40:57.956 --> 03:41:01.617]  Hung people, shot people, disappeared people.
[03:41:01.617 --> 03:41:04.719]  But by 1991, the Berlin Wall fell.
[03:41:04.719 --> 03:41:15.363]  The Soviet Union, now in an era of cameras and television, network cameras even, they knew they couldn't just do another Hungarian revolution crush.
[03:41:15.990 --> 03:41:20.092]  Like on East Berlin or Hungary or Czechoslovakia.
[03:41:20.092 --> 03:41:24.915]  And now it's 30 years since Tiananmen Square.
[03:41:24.915 --> 03:41:30.418]  Will the Chinese Communists feel that they're ready to just crush Hong Kong?
[03:41:30.418 --> 03:41:33.440]  Because Hong Kong could turn into Warsaw Ghetto.
[03:41:33.440 --> 03:41:40.984]  It could turn into Grozny that the Russians had to attack twice and almost leveled that city to take it.
[03:41:42.867 --> 03:41:48.429]  It was spoken of earlier that the Chinese have very much importance on face.
[03:41:48.429 --> 03:41:52.990]  And it's coming up on the anniversary of the 1949 revolution.
[03:41:52.990 --> 03:41:56.891]  And what will it mean if Hong Kong is still having an uprising?
[03:41:56.891 --> 03:42:01.553]  Well, it'll be a lot worse if it's Tiananmen Square times a thousand.
[03:42:01.553 --> 03:42:03.453]  10,000 people died on Tiananmen Square.
[03:42:03.453 --> 03:42:04.974]  Nobody knows for sure.
[03:42:04.974 --> 03:42:08.655]  But there was no video coming out of Tiananmen Square.
[03:42:08.655 --> 03:42:11.776]  But I'll tell you what, there'll be video coming out of Hong Kong.
[03:42:11.776 --> 03:42:12.496]  There'll be video.
[03:42:14.708 --> 03:42:21.310]  One half of the incredible 8-pack Power Staff, the AM Wake Up and Work Packet is exactly what you need to start your day right.
[03:42:21.310 --> 03:42:31.153]  The pack contains five original formulas built to fuel your day and take care of your body's individual needs in the morning, targeting the heart, brain, muscles, energy production and more.
[03:42:31.153 --> 03:42:38.115]  Each AM pack contains a flex and joint support, energy kickstart, krill oil, nootropic brain and greens detox formula.
[03:42:38.935 --> 03:42:39.715]  With the P.M.

[03:42:44.417 --> 03:42:47.038]  Containing four original formulas, the P.M.

[03:42:53.480 --> 03:42:58.361]  Containing bone support, krill oil, sound sleep, and immune support formulas, the P.M.
[03:42:58.361 --> 03:43:04.203]  Packet was created to support improving your body's bones and immune system, all while you rest from the day's work.
[03:43:04.483 --> 03:43:11.276]  When combined with the AM Wake Up and Work Packet, it makes the 8-pack power stack the new can't-miss InfoWars life product.
[03:43:14.312 --> 03:43:14.632]  Alex?
[03:43:14.632 --> 03:43:15.033]  Yes?
[03:43:15.033 --> 03:43:17.714]  I got a plug for the Patriot points I get.
[03:43:17.714 --> 03:43:18.175]  Oh, thanks.
[03:43:18.175 --> 03:43:21.377]  I've gotten $180 so far this year, and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[03:43:21.377 --> 03:43:24.479]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[03:43:24.479 --> 03:43:29.262]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in, so I'd rather give that money to you.
[03:43:29.262 --> 03:43:30.383]  And I'm getting quality products.
[03:43:30.383 --> 03:43:32.945]  The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[03:43:32.945 --> 03:43:35.166]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me.
[03:43:35.166 --> 03:43:35.947]  I've lost weight.
[03:43:35.947 --> 03:43:37.688]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[03:43:37.688 --> 03:43:39.489]  My kids, they use the toupee.
[03:43:39.489 --> 03:43:42.331]  My son used to get these little sore throats, and he puts X2
[03:43:42.571 --> 03:43:42.751]  I think?
[03:44:06.149 --> 03:44:12.807]  10% off because you're on auto-ship, then we'll do a 30% off, and then you do something like that, we have Patriot Points, we lose money, but that's okay.
[03:44:12.807 --> 03:44:13.428]  Thanks for the support.
[03:44:15.385 --> 03:44:26.611]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[03:44:26.611 --> 03:44:30.733]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[03:44:30.733 --> 03:44:40.099]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[03:44:40.839 --> 03:44:42.861]  The system is vulnerable.
[03:44:42.861 --> 03:44:45.543]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[03:44:45.543 --> 03:44:49.166]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[03:44:49.166 --> 03:44:56.072]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[03:44:56.072 --> 03:45:02.038]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.

[03:45:21.090 --> 03:45:22.311]  But it's very exciting.
[03:45:22.311 --> 03:45:24.653]  It's super silver skin cream.
[03:45:24.653 --> 03:45:26.154]  It's got all of these benefits.
[03:45:26.154 --> 03:45:27.254]  Too many to mention.
[03:45:27.254 --> 03:45:28.515]  But it's revolutionary.
[03:45:28.515 --> 03:45:29.455]  It's brand new.
[03:45:29.455 --> 03:45:30.316]  People are gonna love it.

[03:48:53.062 --> 03:48:54.985]  And we really appreciate your support up to this point.
[03:48:56.064 --> 03:48:59.885]  Matt Bracken, you were just talking and you kind of sobered me up.
[03:48:59.885 --> 03:49:02.405]  I can be somewhat optimistic.
[03:49:02.405 --> 03:49:04.366]  I tend to be very optimistic in life.
[03:49:04.366 --> 03:49:08.146]  Coming back from Hong Kong, I still am there in my heart.
[03:49:08.146 --> 03:49:09.707]  The people there are so kind.
[03:49:09.707 --> 03:49:19.189]  It was probably one of the nicest societies I've ever visited and I really wish I was there still today and it breaks my heart to know what's coming to them.
[03:49:19.189 --> 03:49:20.249]  You were just talking about
[03:49:21.169 --> 03:49:29.296]  What's likely coming and it kind of sobered me up a little bit and made me realize these people are really brave and everything you were describing is how it's going to be in Hong Kong.
[03:49:29.296 --> 03:49:34.080]  I mean, this is a very thriving capitalist city, a huge economic hub.
[03:49:34.080 --> 03:49:35.221]  It's not.
[03:49:35.221 --> 03:49:36.102]  It's a beautiful place.
[03:49:36.102 --> 03:49:41.807]  And to imagine tanks rolling through and the fighting there, it's it's heartbreaking.
[03:49:41.807 --> 03:49:47.812]  I think that it gives Beijing pause, very serious pause to consider
[03:49:48.385 --> 03:50:00.834]  If they go in hard, you know, shooting at windows, for example, people wave a flag and they're going to, you know, put 20 or 30 millimeter rounds through windows and high rises, because that's what it's going to take.
[03:50:00.834 --> 03:50:05.537]  The optics of that are going to be disastrous for Beijing, and they know it.
[03:50:05.537 --> 03:50:17.445]  So this so-called troop rotation that they're doing now, it can be the beginning of a full out invasion, or it can be just like another move on the chessboard, like a poker game, you know, showing another card.
[03:50:18.061 --> 03:50:29.089]  But if they go in hard, like they're going to just crush the Hungarian revolution, I think that the difference is today, not only is there going to be film, there's independent journalism.
[03:50:29.089 --> 03:50:37.735]  And I salute and my hat is off to Alex Jones and Infowars for doing better journalism, for backing better journalism.
[03:50:38.157 --> 03:50:38.357]  Thank you.
[03:50:59.244 --> 03:51:01.325]  Which I think is going to be very difficult to do.
[03:51:01.325 --> 03:51:04.707]  If they are crushed, this is going to be a global red pill.
[03:51:04.707 --> 03:51:11.051]  This is going to expose everybody who supported the Chinese, including the Antifa communists.
[03:51:11.051 --> 03:51:13.332]  This is going to totally expose them.
[03:51:13.332 --> 03:51:21.297]  You know, I think Bernie Sanders in the last day or two was talking positively about China, about how they lifted so many people out of poverty.
[03:51:21.297 --> 03:51:24.859]  Yeah, I only killed 50 to 100 million Chinese, but what the hell?
[03:51:24.859 --> 03:51:26.720]  You got to break a few eggs to make an omelet.
[03:51:26.720 --> 03:51:27.781]  That's what Chairman Mao said.
[03:51:28.382 --> 03:51:35.194]  So this will expose the American communists and the international globalists.
[03:51:35.194 --> 03:51:40.443]  If they support China and China goes in, it's going to be like Tiananmen Square times a thousand.
[03:51:40.443 --> 03:51:41.225]  This is a city.
[03:51:42.092 --> 03:51:46.636]  And we've seen urban warfare in places like Grozny or Sarajevo.
[03:51:46.636 --> 03:51:48.657]  It's not easy to do.
[03:51:48.657 --> 03:51:51.680]  And something else on the military level, I love your reporting.
[03:51:51.680 --> 03:51:57.844]  I saw that guy using a badminton racket to throw back a grenade that could have been a flashbang grenade.
[03:51:57.844 --> 03:52:00.506]  Can lose your hand, you know, easily.
[03:52:00.506 --> 03:52:02.348]  So these guys are very smart.
[03:52:02.348 --> 03:52:08.913]  So the Chinese must be considering, when we come in with the tanks, it's not like they're going to roll over and surrender.
[03:52:08.913 --> 03:52:10.394]  They're going to move to another phase.
[03:52:10.967 --> 03:52:13.808]  They're going to have all kinds of ways of sabotaging us.
[03:52:13.808 --> 03:52:23.752]  You know, the first time that the Russians invaded Grozny, they moved right into the center of the city in armored columns and thought, hey, we've arrived, we won.
[03:52:23.752 --> 03:52:28.933]  And the next thing you know, from close range, they're taking all kinds of RPG attacks.
[03:52:28.933 --> 03:52:31.514]  Of course, in Hong Kong, they don't have RPGs.
[03:52:31.514 --> 03:52:34.735]  But they'll have other weapons, other things that they can use.
[03:52:34.735 --> 03:52:36.316]  Between high-rises, tanks are
[03:52:37.412 --> 03:52:38.553]  It's not a panacea.
[03:52:38.553 --> 03:52:39.273]  What are you going to do?
[03:52:39.273 --> 03:52:40.534]  Blow up the building?
[03:52:40.534 --> 03:52:42.955]  Destroy the foundation?
[03:52:42.955 --> 03:52:45.857]  And there's no way they can't get this out on film.
[03:52:45.857 --> 03:52:56.262]  So already in Hong Kong, believe me, before the troops roll in, already the last month, there are Chinese special operations forces all over the ground.
[03:52:56.262 --> 03:53:00.204]  This is including the so-called taxi drivers with the communist flags.
[03:53:00.204 --> 03:53:01.165]  They're spetsnaz.
[03:53:01.165 --> 03:53:02.546]  They're spec ops.
[03:53:02.546 --> 03:53:04.527]  The triads, they're spec ops.
[03:53:04.527 --> 03:53:05.167]  That's cover.
[03:53:05.666 --> 03:53:09.707]  Everybody's wearing a mask, so it's easy to do whatever you want.
[03:53:09.707 --> 03:53:13.188]  It's the Chinese version of the Russian men with green faces.
[03:53:13.188 --> 03:53:14.648]  They're already in Hong Kong.
[03:53:14.648 --> 03:53:16.728]  This is a fourth-generation war.
[03:53:16.728 --> 03:53:18.509]  It's already engaged.
[03:53:18.509 --> 03:53:21.029]  The war is already happening.
[03:53:21.029 --> 03:53:25.030]  And we're just going to see how it escalates phase by phase.
[03:53:25.030 --> 03:53:29.311]  But what will be worse for the Chinese anniversary than what's going on now?
[03:53:29.995 --> 03:53:36.680]  Is Hong Kong in flames with a Grozny, a Stalingrad, you know, a Sarajevo happening?
[03:53:36.680 --> 03:53:40.423]  That's going to be even worse, and they don't want that, believe me.
[03:53:40.423 --> 03:53:49.711]  No, you know, we did see several different uniformed types of police there, including what definitely clearly looked like special forces of some kind.
[03:53:49.711 --> 03:53:54.455]  We even saw some white Westerners wearing uniforms amongst the troops there.
[03:53:54.455 --> 03:53:57.037]  Not many, but there are some photographs going around on the Internet of that.
[03:53:58.077 --> 03:54:01.458]  And the other thing I noticed, too, is you were talking about the mainstream media coverage.
[03:54:01.458 --> 03:54:17.583]  It seemed like the majority of the mainstream media was embedded behind the police looking out at the protesters, which definitely made the protesters appear to be sort of the, you know, problematic rioters, violent protesters, whereas we were mostly within the protesters.
[03:54:17.583 --> 03:54:19.843]  And it's interesting how the angle makes everything look different.
[03:54:19.843 --> 03:54:25.385]  From our angle, we saw a united city with a police force trying to hold them back.
[03:54:26.533 --> 03:54:29.074]  Yeah, and this is so key.
[03:54:29.074 --> 03:54:35.736]  When everybody can be wearing a mask or taking the mask off, depending on what they want to do, anybody can be anybody.
[03:54:35.736 --> 03:54:44.539]  So it's a perfect environment for all kinds of false flag operations, you know, where people would throw a Molotov cocktail at the police, but it's a policeman doing it.
[03:54:45.074 --> 03:54:55.318]  Even in Europe, we've seen in Germany, somebody released a German special forces police manual that gave them the authority to throw rocks at police.
[03:54:55.318 --> 03:55:08.344]  Certain German police units were given authority to commit violence against police so that they could then have a reason to go in with water cannons against the AFD party, for example.
[03:55:08.664 --> 03:55:12.685]  So it's not exactly, this is fourth generation warfare, and we're seeing it.
[03:55:12.685 --> 03:55:19.668]  And a new factor in Hong Kong, with all of the base surveillance and etc, is these people are very brave.
[03:55:19.668 --> 03:55:23.029]  They're putting their necks on the line, literally.
[03:55:23.029 --> 03:55:33.532]  Because if this goes the wrong way, and China clamps down building by building, which is how this kind of a war is fought, you know, you secure the sidewalk, then you capture the building floor by floor.
[03:55:34.218 --> 03:55:38.079]  People are going to be hauled away to gulags in China, and they know it.
[03:55:38.079 --> 03:55:39.900]  And that's why they're fighting so hard.
[03:55:39.900 --> 03:55:45.681]  They know that a month, a year from now, they can be dragged out of their bed or off of the street.
[03:55:45.681 --> 03:55:51.383]  And the next thing they know, they're having their kidneys removed and they're being shot with an AK-47.
[03:55:51.383 --> 03:55:52.943]  Because that's how the Chai Koms roll.
[03:55:53.283 --> 03:56:01.087]  And that's what we've been talking about a lot too, Matt, because a lot of people here in America are trying to equate the Hong Kong protesters to Antifa.
[03:56:01.087 --> 03:56:07.330]  They're saying, you know, if they weren't so violent against police, the police wouldn't have to retaliate with such force.
[03:56:07.330 --> 03:56:16.114]  But again, they don't understand, people here in America that are saying these things don't understand that this is authoritarian China that is trying to come in and take away these people's rights.
[03:56:16.114 --> 03:56:16.614]  And China...
[03:56:17.094 --> 03:56:24.843]  Again, as we've talked about, we know that they have that AI facial recognition, the Chinese social credit score.
[03:56:24.843 --> 03:56:31.952]  They're very authoritarian, and these people are genuinely fighting for their rights, and they're fighting for everything that people here in America take for granted.
[03:56:31.952 --> 03:56:34.415]  You know, they're flying the American flag in Hong Kong.
[03:56:34.415 --> 03:56:36.077]  Meanwhile, people in America are burning it.
[03:56:37.020 --> 03:56:49.143]  They're fighting for their lives because if they fail, if the Chai Koms roll in hard, they will one at a time be dragged away to a Chinese gulag and to never be seen again.
[03:56:49.143 --> 03:56:50.464]  So they're fighting for their lives.
[03:56:50.464 --> 03:56:51.364]  I salute them.
[03:56:51.364 --> 03:56:53.344]  And thank you InfoWars for sending you guys.
