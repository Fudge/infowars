[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you've got one!
[00:16.000 --> 00:32.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:32.000 --> 00:43.000]  This idea that there's a woke mob and cancel culture that's coming for Aaron Rodgers, I think he's paranoid.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  Aaron Rodgers thinks he's smarter than everybody else. He's the smartest guy in the room.
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  Aaron Rodgers always thinks he's the smartest guy in the room.
[00:52.000 --> 00:53.000]  He does.
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  And rules don't apply to him.
[00:55.000 --> 00:58.000]  It's him thinking he knows more than all of us and that the rules don't apply to him.
[00:58.000 --> 01:06.000]  Rodgers is now blaming the quote, woke mob for how he's being treated, perhaps creating a new definition for the term cheesehead.
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.000]  It's my body and my COVID. You know, I could give it to whoever I want, but suddenly the woke mob is coming after me.
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  Aaron Rodgers is a liar. Period.
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  Are you vaccinated and what's your stance on vaccinations?
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  Yeah, I've been immunized.
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.000]  Yeah, you see, did you notice the air quotes? That's how you know.
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.000]  He lied to his teeth with a smirk on his face.
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.000]  Aaron Rodgers showing up cavalier with his head around, you know, talking all slow and smug with smug with his attitude.
[01:37.000 --> 01:45.000]  Unfortunately, we've got players that pretty much think only about themselves and I'm extremely disappointed in the actions of Aaron Rodgers.
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  Bravo, Terry Bradshaw, for what you said and everyone else who's got half a brain in this country.
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  But this guy, they should throw him out of the league so fast.
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.000]  I think we're seeing a very different side of Aaron Rodgers. I think we're seeing a side of Aaron Rodgers that people are really, really disgusted by.
[02:01.000 --> 02:09.000]  Let me just say that the guy is in a huddle six days a week, breathing on people and directly exposing his teammates to COVID.
[02:09.000 --> 02:16.000]  I took all my teammates into a huddle, got all their faces three inches away from my wet mouth and told them, trust me.
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  Let me breathe on you.
[02:18.000 --> 02:29.000]  You know, he says, I did my own research. It's almost like he's implying that people who got vaccinated didn't.
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  Rodgers also said he had done his own homework, like consulting with podcast host Joe Rogan.
[02:33.000 --> 02:39.000]  What you were doing was taking stuff that would keep you from getting COVID-19. You got COVID-19.
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.000]  I've remept him as a cattle dewormer. Sorry, folks. That's what it is.
[02:42.000 --> 02:46.000]  It's literal horse pills. That's a horse dewormer.
[02:46.000 --> 02:53.000]  It's a deworming product for cows and horses. Sorry, folks. That's what it is.
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  We take inflation very seriously.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  Economists call all these things transitory effects.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  These one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on inflation.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  There will be transitory impacts as it relates to inflation.
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  I believe it's transitory.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  Temporary transitory impacts.
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  In the end, it will be transitory.
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  Inflation rises will be transitory, that they will come back down next year.
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  Inflation is going to come down next year.
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  Inflation will come down next year.
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.000]  Talking about inflation, the overwhelming consensus is going to pop up a little bit and then go back down.
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  People fully expect this inflation to be temporary.
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  There's nobody suggesting there's unchecked inflation on the way. No serious economists.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  The president's Build Back Better Agenda as a whole will ease some of that inflationary pressure.
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.000]  A bipartisan infrastructure deal and Build Back Better Agenda could likely ease inflationary pressures.
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  It will ease longer-term inflationary pressures.
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  We're going to ease inflationary pressure.
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  I don't think that these investments will drive up inflation at all.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  Build Back Better will not increase inflation.
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  The overall Build Back Better vision is designed to reduce inflationary pressures.
[04:04.000 --> 04:13.000]  I have 17 Nobel laureates in economics sent me a letter recently saying that my proposals would actually reduce inflation.
[04:13.000 --> 04:19.000]  17 Nobel laureate economists said that if we pass both of these plans, we would reduce inflation.
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  17 Nobel laureates in economics said it's going to lower inflation.
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  17 Nobel Prize winners in economics.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  17 Nobel Prize winning economists.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  15 Nobel laureates.
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.000]  A total of 14, I think there's 14 Nobel laureate economists.
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000]  Since it is paid for, it would not increase inflation.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  Wages have gone up higher faster than inflation.
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  Monthly rates of inflation have already fallen substantially.
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  If we pass the other two things I'm trying to get done, we will in fact reduce inflation.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  Reduce inflation. Reduce inflation.
[04:56.000 --> 05:01.000]  Well, it's now out in the open.
[05:01.000 --> 05:07.000]  It's now becoming accepted knowledge.
[05:07.000 --> 05:15.000]  Accepted fact that global government run by private corporations is taking over the United States and other formerly sovereign nations.
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.000]  They're being destroyed. All the checks and balances are being annihilated.
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.000]  Our borders are being destroyed. Our currency is being destroyed.
[05:21.000 --> 05:26.000]  And the American people have been listed as terrorists by the rogue federal government.
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  Info wars is going to continue to fight on.
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  And there is a big awakening happening. We have a good chance of beating these people.
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  But we're not going to be able to stay on air unless you support us and you've been doing it.
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  So spread the word about the broadcast.
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  Pray for the broadcast, but also buy great products at infowarshow.com.
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  If you're shopping with the big corporations or the establishment, you're aiding the enemy.
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.000]  If you're funding us and getting great products, you are helping lead the war effort.
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  I cannot express to you how important it is to buy your products and do your Christmas shopping
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000]  and do your Black Friday shopping at infowarshow.com.
[05:56.000 --> 06:25.000]  We've got store-wide free shipping right now and double-patria points.
[06:26.000 --> 06:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Tuesday, November 9th, 2021.
[06:39.000 --> 06:43.000]  And if you are a radio listener, you'll be able to hear me read you this headline.
[06:43.000 --> 06:48.000]  But if you're a TV viewer, you just saw the headline front and center.
[06:48.000 --> 06:55.000]  CNN says people are taking three shots and have, quote, no antibodies for COVID-19
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  and are catching COVID-19.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  They're answer more shots.
[06:59.000 --> 07:04.000]  That's like saying, if you cut one of your fingers off with a meat cleaver,
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.000]  the way to fix it is to cut off three more, or maybe slit your throat,
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  or maybe hang yourself, or shoot yourself, or drink cyanide,
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  or why not put the baby in the microwave?
[07:17.000 --> 07:18.000]  That'll help him.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  Oh, your baby's got a stomach ache?
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  Put him in a wood chipper.
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.000]  Think of the level of the war on logic and reality happening,
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  where they say, oh, a big problem in California,
[07:31.000 --> 07:36.000]  prisons, women are having babies together.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  You think, well, that's insanity.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  That's the plan.
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  Three shots in one booster later.
[07:43.000 --> 07:46.000]  Three shots in one booster later.
[07:46.000 --> 07:49.000]  This man has little protection against COVID-19.
[07:49.000 --> 07:54.000]  Don't worry, Pfizer and Moderna now have a pill.
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  But you're both based on ivermectin.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  Isn't that interesting?
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.000]  But of course, now they're just going to release some new deadly virus to begin depopulating.
[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  Gates has told us it's just around the corner.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  Think about how crazy everything has gotten.
[08:15.000 --> 08:21.000]  Here we are in the year 2021. It's almost over.
[08:21.000 --> 08:39.000]  And we're sitting here watching the corporate controlled news tell us that you will take these shots to fly on a plane to have a job.
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  They want five-year-olds and up to take it.
[08:43.000 --> 08:49.000]  And then you learn that the so-called vaccine doesn't give you antibodies because it's not a vaccine.
[08:49.000 --> 08:57.000]  It's a gene therapy that turns off your killer white blood cells, the ones that protect your body.
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  And I've got all the major studies and the literature and the scientists.
[09:01.000 --> 09:09.000]  It's an admitted fact that it doesn't protect you and gives you all sorts of serious disorders.
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  Now, coming up next hour, we have the investigative journalist on very respected, also a scientist,
[09:15.000 --> 09:26.000]  Major Invenor, who has sources confirming to him that Newsom is partially paralyzed with Guillaume Marais.
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  And that is why he has not been seen now in 12 days.
[09:31.000 --> 09:42.000]  And counting, he took the Moderna shot 14 days ago as his quote booster for his J&J.
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  No studies, no science behind it. Now we know the science.
[09:46.000 --> 09:54.000]  It's a death sentence if you keep taking the quote boosters because it grows the prion crystals, spike protein in your body.
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  And one person might die right away from one shot.
[09:57.000 --> 10:04.000]  The other person might be able to take five, but it starts establishing protein colonies in the body.
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  Spongiform encephalopathy.
[10:09.000 --> 10:16.000]  It's mainline science.
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  Think about that. So here's some of the headlines today.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  CNN.
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  And this story is such a murder of logic.
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.000]  It's just like all the pieces out of Canada and the U.S. and Europe and Australia and New Zealand.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  We don't know why the hospitals are full of double jab people.
[10:31.000 --> 10:38.000]  We don't know why they've got such horrible allergies and diseases and most of them have their lungs filled and can't breathe and die.
[10:38.000 --> 10:45.000]  They have an autoimmune response. They say it's like the Spanish flu of 1913, but it's not COVID.
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  It's called a super cold.
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  Well, they know the Spanish flu was because they got one flu that was very similar.
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.000]  And then they got another one, a new mutation right away that caused an autoimmune response like a bee sting.
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  Again, I used to laugh at people that were scared of bees. They had allergies.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  I've been stung many times. I only got the allergy when I was about 18.
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  I've been stung twice since then.
[11:09.000 --> 11:16.000]  Can't breathe, starts swelling up, got to take a bunch of medication or I could die.
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  Same thing here. It's very simple. Having a very serious autoimmune response.
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  There's a bunch of different types.
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  One of them is when your body just flat out attacks itself, basically rejects itself.
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.000]  It's like when you reject a new organ, but it actually attacks your body itself, A-D-E.
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  And they put an electron microscope video up.
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  If you're a radio listener, watch this archive later, you can see it, but put it back on screen.
[11:40.000 --> 11:48.000]  That's an electron microscope of a killer white blood cell coming over to cancer.
[11:48.000 --> 11:55.000]  And it recognizes that this is not a regular cell in the body. This is a mutant and it eats it.
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  And when they stop eating the cancer, you get cancer. You know children get cancer every day.
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  Adults get cancer when you get older every few hours. They got studies.
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.000]  And if you don't have your white blood cells doing their job or they get screwed up
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  because there's so much they're being bombarded with, they just give up, then you get cancer.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  And that's what all the experts are saying is that these injections, the number one thing they do
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  is attack the ovaries in children and adult women.
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  They attack the testicles and concentrate there, the prions, the protein crystals, spike protein.
[12:28.000 --> 12:38.000]  And they attack the lungs, the heart, the cardiovascular. And they just start growing inside of your body.
[12:38.000 --> 12:46.000]  And then it basically causes cancer and your killer T's turn off, they don't die.
[12:46.000 --> 12:52.000]  They just stop fighting and you get cancer and it starts replicating and you die.
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  And now we've got top scientists that own major biopsy labs in England, in Germany, in France,
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.000]  and the U.S. have all come out and said the same thing that they've seen over a 20-fold increase
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.000]  in cancer biopsy positives in the last year plus.
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  I'm going to say that again. You can pull it, just type it in. It'll come up on Twitter.
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  It's everywhere. It's scientists at their labs who they are. They go, yeah, we're seeing a 20-fold plus increase.
[13:17.000 --> 13:26.000]  The main coroner association of Germany, the pathology union, the head of it came out
[13:26.000 --> 13:33.000]  what six months ago and said, we're seeing a massive increase in cancers and a doubling in cancer deaths
[13:33.000 --> 13:39.000]  connected to the shots. That's just the pathology head of the union.
[13:39.000 --> 13:45.000]  So here we are. So I'm going to say it again. They have injected the general public with a carcinogen,
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000]  with a system that programs your body not to kill cancer.
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.000]  And what do the Georgia Guidestones say? That they're going to kill 80% of the world population down to 500 million
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  and that you should not be a cancer upon the earth. And they decided that they got to make room for them.
[14:04.000 --> 14:11.000]  Three shots and one booster later, this man has little protection against COVID-19, CNN.
[14:11.000 --> 14:20.000]  Biden White House tells businesses to follow vaccine mandate despite court blocking it, seeing as grave constitutional issues.
[14:20.000 --> 14:27.000]  French health authority advises against Moderna COVID vaccine for under 30s. Oh, really?
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.000]  And the same national EU board said no one under 16 should take any of them.
[14:32.000 --> 14:41.000]  And it was Sweden banned it last week in a couple other countries in Europe this week and all totaled to over 150 countries
[14:41.000 --> 14:50.000]  that have banned the Moderna shot. The Moderna shot's the one that not noose about the last 12 days.
[14:50.000 --> 14:58.000]  And again, I want to be very, very clear about this. I don't wish harm on anybody.
[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  I don't take glee in the how fallen Governor Newsom is, but I hope and pray that God works his miracles here
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  and the Lord works mysterious ways and that Newsom either be spared, but repent and come out and admit the truth.
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.000]  Or if he needs to die as an example to others about how deadly these shots are, that would be a blessing to save children
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.000]  in California as young as five, next it'll be newborns, they're already saying it, who they're trying to, quote,
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  take it to go to the park or go to the mall or go get a hamburger or go to the doctor or go to school.
[15:28.000 --> 15:34.000]  I mean, they're giving our children an experimental deadly shot. And so I hope if it's God's will that Governor Newsom dies
[15:34.000 --> 15:41.000]  so that children will be saved. I mean, I don't want him to die, but I'm saying if he needs to die to reverse this in California
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000]  before our children die in mass, which already happened in the trials, they suppressed it, then yeah, I mean, he's an adult,
[15:46.000 --> 15:52.000]  he's had a life, he decided to take it. If it's an example to others, I ask God to strike him down.
[15:52.000 --> 15:58.000]  God, if it's your will, please make sure Governor Newsom dies so the children get saved. Please strike him down.
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  I am cutting this announcement.

[20:17.000 --> 20:31.000]  In the councils of government, we should guard against the influence of shot and unsought of the military industrial complex.
[20:31.000 --> 20:37.000]  You watch the full speech of Eisenhower in his farewell address in 1961. It's 21 minutes long.
[20:37.000 --> 20:55.000]  He talks about a technocratic scientific elite that is building an authoritarian system and is taking control of the American academic and military ecclesiastical systems.
[20:55.000 --> 21:07.000]  That was him trying to warn people about the globalist and about their eugenics plan that by then was already firmly rooted and then he'd been briefed on.
[21:07.000 --> 21:19.000]  And since then, you know the rest is history. They killed the next president because he tried to actually be the president and because this scientific group of mad scientists wanted full control.
[21:19.000 --> 21:30.000]  And everything you see now is the launch of the transhumanist medical tyranny takeover of the human condition and everything we are.
[21:30.000 --> 21:42.000]  Everything flows out of this and it's all about isolating you, making you alone, controlling the means of production so that you're dependent so you will then sign on to their agenda.
[21:42.000 --> 21:52.000]  For most people that means being sterilized and then being slowly euthanized or agreeing to be euthanized immediately, dying, killing yourself, state sponsored.
[21:52.000 --> 22:09.000]  For others it means bowing to them and being their servants and turning your will over to them. This is a living death, a form of neo-slavery, truly an abomination.
[22:09.000 --> 22:22.000]  So watching him flip out about Aaron Rodgers and hyperventilate on every channel and say he needs to be arrested, thrown out of the league, all the rest of it, because he doesn't want to take an experimental shot is just insane.
[22:22.000 --> 22:33.000]  And then when he joked and said, have you been vaccinated? He goes, yeah, vaccinated in air quotes, being sarcastic, meaning it's not really a vaccine.
[22:33.000 --> 22:44.000]  He's saying, I'm taking care of my own immune system. And of course he tests positive, probably not even a real positive, never even really feel sick.
[22:44.000 --> 22:51.000]  Talks to Joe Rogan, takes some ivermectin, takes some uesidine, takes some zinc, feels great.
[22:51.000 --> 22:58.000]  But they all line up the Terry Bradshaw's of the world. I mean, have you read about Terry Bradshaw, what a loser he is?
[22:58.000 --> 23:06.000]  The empty suit that reads off a teleprompter. He's on a whole bunch of drugs and psychotropics. I mean, the man's a joke.
[23:06.000 --> 23:17.000]  He doesn't believe in other Americans' rights not to take the garbage that Big Pharma pushes. Hey, Terry Bradshaw, you dumb thug.
[23:17.000 --> 23:23.000]  They're coming after our children with this experimental crap now. And their blood's going to be on your hands.
[23:23.000 --> 23:32.000]  You bully? Look at this. Three shots in one booster later, this man has little protection against COVID.
[23:32.000 --> 23:38.000]  And now these people are like, oh, we need more shots. That's the answer. That's what CNN says.
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.000]  Biden White House tells businesses to follow vaccine mandate despite court block.
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  They don't have a vaccine mandate from a president over businesses.
[23:46.000 --> 23:53.000]  Oh, how about this Terry Bradshaw, you dumb bastard? French health authority. This is Reuters.
[23:53.000 --> 23:59.000]  Advises against Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for under 30s because of heart attacks and massive microcarditis.
[23:59.000 --> 24:07.000]  Oh, where's Governor Newsom right now? Oh, he took the Moderna shot two weeks ago and has been gone for 12 days.
[24:07.000 --> 24:13.000]  We got a source coming on that confirms what my sources are saying. He's partially paralyzed. It has Bell's palsy.
[24:13.000 --> 24:20.000]  Yama Ray Bell's palsy, same, same disease, different names.
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.000]  Look at that. Oh, here's another one. Here's another one right here.
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.000]  Don't vaccinate kids urgent message from major doctor's group summit.
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  But you know, Terry Bradshaw doesn't listen to that. He just listens to the paycheck he gets from the big corporations.
[24:34.000 --> 24:40.000]  Hey, Terry, the Pfizer and Moderna shot are banned in hundreds of countries.
[24:40.000 --> 24:48.000]  Moderna is banned in over 150. Pfizer's banned in close to 100, like China, like India.
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.000]  You see this? French health authority advises against Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.000]  It's now been banned in a bunch of other countries. You see that Terry? That's your precious Reuters.
[24:58.000 --> 25:06.000]  You dumb, you dumb thug. Don't vaccinate kids urgent message from doctor's summit. Go read it.
[25:06.000 --> 25:13.000]  Oh, here's one out of major German publication. Puzzling heart diseases in soccer players in football.
[25:13.000 --> 25:19.000]  An unusually large number of professional and amateur soccer players have collapsed recently with heart attacks and deaths.
[25:19.000 --> 25:28.000]  That's happening in every sport. And they're reporting in Scotland a doubling in microcarditis in people below the age of 30.
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  A doubling. Same numbers are in Europe, same in Canada, same here.
[25:33.000 --> 25:40.000]  But just suddenly there's just massive numbers of people having heart attacks and heart swelling.
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.000]  And it goes on the big article. You can go read.
[25:45.000 --> 25:56.000]  Oh, but, oh, how about this, Terry? Update, Governor Newsom's wife defends his absence after taking booster shot, then deletes tweet and panic.
[25:56.000 --> 26:03.000]  Governor Newsom remains out of public sight to deal with a family obligation. Yes.
[26:03.000 --> 26:10.000]  Dr. Mercola files lawsuit against U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is a private citizen, wrote letters to Amazon asking for his book to be removed.
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  That's now sold over a million, 100,000 copies.
[26:13.000 --> 26:19.000]  When he's a agreed medical doctor and only showed mainline studies saying, the book was published six months ago,
[26:19.000 --> 26:25.000]  that this doesn't protect you, the different injections, that they're not vaccines, they're gene therapy, and they erase your immune system.
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  Which is what the damn studies show now all vindicated.
[26:29.000 --> 26:35.000]  Good. I hope he cleans your clock, that lying witch.
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  And it goes on and on and on.
[26:38.000 --> 26:49.000]  We've got the supercut at mandat video, Aaron Rodgers versus the woke mob, get it and share it.
[26:49.000 --> 26:55.000]  We also have some other big developments. I got a supercut of it. It's like 20 minutes long. I wouldn't have time to air the whole thing,
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.000]  but it's posted at mandat video and it's powerful written house trial.
[27:00.000 --> 27:08.000]  The one survivor that got shot in the arm admits to chasing him down, trying to kill written house.
[27:08.000 --> 27:21.000]  And all sorts of other stuff under rough. Just absolutely gets destroyed. All of them do.
[27:21.000 --> 27:25.000]  These witnesses, it's just incredible, but that's part of the course.
[27:25.000 --> 27:37.000]  And then the prosecutor, this big leftist trying to put written house in jail for the rest of his life is just palms his face when the witness admits everything that written house said was true.
[27:37.000 --> 27:46.000]  And the FBI had the FLIR footage from a plane above and ground footage of written house being shot at.
[27:46.000 --> 27:56.000]  Shot at and chased by men with guns and men beating him over the head with a skateboard and men pointing guns at him.
[27:56.000 --> 28:07.000]  Prosecutor hangs head and shame as star witness admits he only was shot after pointing a gun at call written house as he stood over and with the gun.
[28:07.000 --> 28:18.000]  But you can see the damn gun in the video, but national media never shows you that written house showed incredible poise and grace really.
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  And that's why they're trying to put him in jail because it's a crime under a socialist global assistant to defend yourself.
[28:23.000 --> 28:29.000]  By the way, I live in Austin. Nice areas. Poor areas doesn't matter. Just 78 shootings at one apartment complex.
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  They're reporting this week that we had a vote to downsize the police actually defunded the police partially here.
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  They try to have a vote to refund it. No, the police don't even respond now, barely.
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  And they certainly don't preemptively stop criminals. I mean, it's dangerous.
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  That's all part of the plan to collapse society.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  They'll bring in a super police state after it. That's all the planet cloud swab.
[28:48.000 --> 28:54.000]  We got a lot of news on that and Ted Cruz has called out pedophiles. We'll cover that when we come back on the other side.
[28:54.000 --> 29:19.000]  Remember, it's up to you to spread the word. That's how we override the sensors.
[29:19.000 --> 29:26.000]  It's even better than last formula with chaga mushrooms and turmeric and just everything.

[30:35.000 --> 30:41.000]  Magnesium, potassium's added. This is so good for inflammation, for your immune system, for your whole body.
[30:41.000 --> 30:50.000]  Grandma always gave you chicken soup when you were sick. Remember, that's a tiny amount of the same stuff that's in there that is now in here in a very large amount.
[30:50.000 --> 30:59.000]  So again, get the power of Grandma's chicken soup with the power of turmeric and everything else with the new and improved Bone Broth at InfoWarsStore.com.

[32:51.000 --> 33:12.000]  So thank you all for your support with supply chain breakdowns. I recommend you get your Christmas shopping done now and have it done and support the InfoWare at InfoWarsStore.com.
[33:21.000 --> 33:36.000]  All right, folks, we are back live. It is the dreaded Alex Jones show. You are right in the middle of it.
[33:36.000 --> 33:47.000]  Again, this whole Aaron Rodgers thing, the foaming at the mouth by all these pathetic talking heads in agreement in the whole sports world,
[33:47.000 --> 33:59.000]  attacking this guy and saying he's the worst person ever. That's why I stopped watching the National Football League and all the rest of it more than 20 years ago,
[33:59.000 --> 34:08.000]  because it's so political. It's so anti-American. It's so anti-family. It's so full of thugs and just, it's idle worship.
[34:08.000 --> 34:18.000]  And I don't watch basketball. I don't watch golf. I don't watch hockey. I might sometimes watch the Olympics, but it's full of new world order propaganda.
[34:18.000 --> 34:30.000]  And I really like sports, and sports is good for people, but it's been taken over and it's sick. It's woke, and that's why it has about half the viewers it had just five years ago.
[34:30.000 --> 34:38.000]  I'm not the only person that's had this exodus out of it, but watching the unified talking heads demonizing somebody.
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  They didn't want to put some experimental shot in their body that's banned in most countries.
[34:42.000 --> 34:49.000]  And then disgusting Howard Stern, who you know, they're blackmailing with all the stuff he's done in the past, coming out saying,
[34:49.000 --> 35:01.000]  FPM, F. Aaron Rodgers, he should be kicked out of the NFL for refusing the injection. And then I have stacks of news here where the Pfizer and Moderna shot is getting either banned completely
[35:01.000 --> 35:12.000]  or major governments are saying, do not give it to people under 30 because it's causing people that have young, healthy hearts to have heart attacks and die.
[35:12.000 --> 35:22.000]  And then again, major German publications like build and der Spiegel are saying, why is there record heart attacks in sports players?
[35:22.000 --> 35:31.000]  Does it matter if it's skin divers or soccer players or football players or baseball players or basketball players?
[35:31.000 --> 35:38.000]  Record numbers have microcarditis and their doctors tell them, oh, you got this from the vaccine. Hopefully you'll get better.
[35:38.000 --> 35:44.000]  And there's news articles I read yesterday where the top skin diver in the world. This happened four months ago and he's getting worse and worse.
[35:44.000 --> 35:56.000]  And now his heart valve collapsed and he might die. And they had to go replace his heart valve. Incredible.
[35:56.000 --> 36:08.000]  And remember back, you know, in the early days, I said the earlys, earlys for me like back in the 80s and 90s, you would see really healthy basketball players would just collapse and die.
[36:08.000 --> 36:17.000]  And then you would learn, oh, they'd taken a little bit of cocaine or whatever. I mean, you can't go out there and take drugs when your heart is operating at such a level and you're so prime.
[36:17.000 --> 36:24.000]  It's like giving a racehorse, you know, drugs, it'll have a heart attack. And that's what's happening to these people because they're causing blood clots in the body.
[36:24.000 --> 36:38.000]  And the heart just totally freaks out. It's killing old people as well. But we have the studies, we have the information and there they are demonizing, demonizing Aaron Rodgers, which will only make the guy a hero.
[36:38.000 --> 36:45.000]  I mean, I mean, I wish more of sports was like Aaron Rodgers, but they're just not the type of people I look up to.
[36:45.000 --> 36:58.000]  I see sports icons now. It's just as disgusting as Howard Stern or any of the leftist in Hollywood pushing their forced injection allusions.
[36:58.000 --> 37:10.000]  And listen, do I think Howard Stern deserves to be fired because he dressed up in blackface and made jokes about Aunt Jemima and drank, you know, malt liquor out of a 40 in 1994? No.
[37:10.000 --> 37:21.000]  But he goes along and says de-platform everybody else now for things far less and he doesn't get de-platform because he's protected.
[37:21.000 --> 37:30.000]  And that's the thing about censorship and this wokeness. It's not equally applied because it was never designed to be equally applied.
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  So let's recap these articles and I've got new ones I want to hit.
[37:34.000 --> 37:42.000]  Let's bring it in. Three shots and one booster later, this man has little protection against COVID and has no antibodies because it doesn't give you antibodies.
[37:42.000 --> 37:47.000]  It's a gene therapy. Their answer, more shots.
[37:47.000 --> 37:53.000]  Biden White House tells businesses to follow vaccine mandate despite court block.
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.000]  And now they've expanded. They're saying, oh, we'll probably just do it to smaller businesses than 100 boys.
[37:58.000 --> 38:04.000]  Oh, and we may just do an interstate travel ban if you want to fly on airplanes or get on buses.
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.000]  So they already make you interstate mask, which is totally unconstitutional.
[38:09.000 --> 38:14.000]  The federal government saying you want to go between states. Well, now, oh, yeah, got a habit.
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  Oh, they're getting rid of the PCR test. They now admit it was a fraud. It was a fraud.
[38:17.000 --> 38:24.000]  They have a new globally approved system that costs $200 on average and that's owned by Bill Gates and George Soros.
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  I'm not kidding. They got the test. They got it ready. They got it approved by the UN.
[38:28.000 --> 38:33.000]  And now you're going to pay to use it and pay George Soros and Bill Gates money to travel and live.
[38:33.000 --> 38:39.000]  That's real slavery. That's real control.
[38:39.000 --> 38:46.000]  Here they are talking about interstate travel controls using the vaccine passport.
[38:46.000 --> 38:54.000]  The U.S. is now accepting fully vaccinated travelers from countries that were previously restricted during the pandemic,
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  given how rapidly the Delta variant spread here within the United States over the summer.
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  Why are there still no vaccine or testing requirements for domestic travel?
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  So, you know, we say this all the time. Everything's on the table.
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.000]  We just don't have any announcement to preview right now on this.
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  So I don't have anything more to share on the domestic travel.
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.000]  We're in a lot of trouble, folks. You know, as good as the Santas is on the surface.
[39:20.000 --> 39:28.000]  Florida has legislation moving forward to make you have a digital passport, digital ID on your phone,
[39:28.000 --> 39:34.000]  which will then have proof of inoculation. But who's even worse? Utah. I've got it here on the stack.
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  Utah has put out the press release and says, oh, we're the most advanced in the U.S.
[39:38.000 --> 39:46.000]  It's you and approved social credit score through your driver's license that will also be a vaccine passport.
[39:46.000 --> 39:51.000]  See? Just like that. Now, there's the Washington Post.
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.000]  Your driver's license could soon live on your phone. Here's what you need to know.
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  Oh, there'll be lots of requirements. Oh, and it gets worse.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  Big article up on infowars.com. Remember what we kept warning you about?
[40:04.000 --> 40:10.000]  I'm going to cover it next segment, the Ties of the Carbon Taxes. What did the BlackRock group say?
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.000]  And what did the U.N. say? And what did the Davos group say in the last month?
[40:13.000 --> 40:23.000]  They said, the whole new future of tech will be devices that surveil for carbon use and that surveil COVID.
[40:23.000 --> 40:31.000]  Cameras and sensors and cars and phones in your house, you know, the Alexa type systems that you have to have
[40:31.000 --> 40:36.000]  by law for the devices to even work.
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.000]  And here it is. They want $150 trillion in taxpayer money.
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.000]  That's officially announced by the Federal Reserve to fund the New World Order.
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.000]  That's more than the whole GDP every year.
[40:46.000 --> 40:58.000]  Look at this. Infrastructure bill to require breathalyzer-style systems in all cars by 2026, and it's now past the house.
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  And now it's already past the Senate. Biden is implementing it.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  So remember how I warned you about that a few months ago?
[41:03.000 --> 41:08.000]  Buried in there is cameras and sensors that, of course, it's not going to just end with alcohol.
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.000]  It's watching you. It's tracking you. It'll claim you have COVID or it'll claim it.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  It's a PCR test system. It's a fraud.
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  It's Theranos. There's going to be a Theranos fraud detector.
[41:18.000 --> 41:21.000]  It's fraudulent. It doesn't detect fraud.
[41:21.000 --> 41:26.000]  In there scanning you to then report back something's wrong with you so the technocracy can come grab you.
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  That's all this is.
[41:28.000 --> 41:35.000]  More surveillance and less privacy with a new normal after the coronavirus pandemic. Fortune.
[41:35.000 --> 41:43.000]  And here it is. Infrastructure bill to require breathalyzer-style systems in all cars within four years.
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  It's time to say no.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  And now it's not just some article on the intercept three months ago.
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  It's not just some Alex Jones show.
[41:51.000 --> 41:59.000]  It's now the law and 16 Republicans voted to go along with it.
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.000]  And that's exactly what Big Tech wanted. They wanted a law to protect them.
[42:03.000 --> 42:08.000]  It was even the automobile industry that lobbied for this whereby law, they've all got to do it.
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  And guess what? Europe's passed laws and Japan's passed laws and China's passed laws.
[42:12.000 --> 42:20.000]  It's all globally standardized going in to the cars and into the phones and into everything where you can't get away from it.
[42:20.000 --> 42:28.000]  You've got to have your social credit score, the Alexa or the Google system in your house watching and listening to you.
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  And Al Gore says this will call the Green Police on you.
[42:31.000 --> 42:37.000]  It will find the culprits of climate crime and will come.
[42:37.000 --> 42:42.000]  And what is the crime all carbon? What you're based on? What you live off of?
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  A new form of feudalism.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  All right, I'll get to that.

[45:00.000 --> 45:08.000]  If a hurricane is smashing into the Gulf Coast and I make the prediction that it's going to cause flooding,
[45:08.000 --> 45:12.000]  that's not a prediction. You know it's a hurricane, you know it's got a lot of water, it's going to die up,
[45:12.000 --> 45:19.000]  it's going to cause flooding. So it wasn't a prediction 20 months ago when I said the UN order to lock down the world economy
[45:19.000 --> 45:25.000]  is going to cause a chain reaction that's going to cause supply chain problems for years and it's going to starve tens of millions to death
[45:25.000 --> 45:30.000]  and now it all happened. 25 million extra dead, hundreds of millions on the verge of starvation
[45:30.000 --> 45:36.000]  and the UN that ordered it's running around being the savior. Listen, when the first world collapses, the third world dies

[47:46.000 --> 47:51.000]  That's right, I ain't fooling around, done had my fun.
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  I ain't going to see no more damage done.
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.000]  There's a meme going around.
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.000]  I think everybody should share.
[48:03.000 --> 48:10.000]  I'm going to have it added to the live show feed of the broadcast today so you can share it.
[48:10.000 --> 48:16.000]  It's, oh my God, young people are suddenly dying everywhere.
[48:16.000 --> 48:22.000]  The man says while he's reading his laptop, but he looks up with his coffee in his hand and says, oh wait,
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.000]  that's completely normal according to this fact checker.
[48:27.000 --> 48:38.000]  Billboards in Europe and the United States confirmed saying it's completely normal for children
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  and others to have heart attacks and strokes because they're suddenly exploded.
[48:42.000 --> 48:47.000]  They're all pre-programmed and ready. There's the live show headline for the day.
[48:47.000 --> 48:53.000]  I hope everybody will share with everyone they know and in that live show headline,
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  we're going to post that meme so you can share it.
[48:55.000 --> 49:02.000]  Tuesday live, CNN admits COVID vaccines don't work and destroy your immune system,
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  then calls for more shots.
[49:05.000 --> 49:13.000]  The system's wife confirms Governor has been in hiding for 12 days after taking the Moderna injection
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  that's now banned in over 150 countries.
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  She admits he's not leaving the house but won't say why.
[49:19.000 --> 49:25.000]  Watch and share this vital addition of the most banned broadcast in the world.
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  If the tyrants fear it, it must be the antidote.
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  Yes, it is.
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.000]  And again, here's major German newspaper.
[49:36.000 --> 49:41.000]  Puzzling heart disease in soccer players explodes.
[49:41.000 --> 49:47.000]  An unusually large number of professional and amateur soccer players have collapsed recently.
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  Many of them dying.
[49:52.000 --> 49:55.000]  Isn't that nice?
[49:55.000 --> 49:58.000]  Very, very serious.
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  This is what this is billed.
[50:01.000 --> 50:12.000]  So, let me hit this because I mentioned it's just interesting because it's what these people deserve to be called out.
[50:12.000 --> 50:18.000]  The Lincoln Project is a Democratic Party globalist organization of total disinformation.
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.000]  We got caught dressing up as white nationalists,
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.000]  posing as the last group that dressed up as white nationalists in Charlottesville four years ago.
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.000]  They were criticizing Ted Cruz saying that the vaccine shouldn't be mandatory for five and ups,
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  and their answers, the videos right here on MSNBC,
[50:34.000 --> 50:40.000]  was to talk about Ted Cruz's daughters and say that he's a bad father.
[50:40.000 --> 50:46.000]  And Ted Cruz responded, the pedophiles of the Lincoln Project need to stop talking about my children.
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  Think about that.
[50:49.000 --> 50:55.000]  Over and over and over again, it's the same thing.
[50:55.000 --> 51:03.000]  And now more countries are saying, do not give the Moderna shot to people under 30 because it's really deadly.
[51:03.000 --> 51:10.000]  I mean, it's the same thing as the Pfizer, it's just three times stronger.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  Coming up next hour, he's going to be on with us.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  He's really one of the leading journalists out there.
[51:14.000 --> 51:20.000]  He's also a big software engineer and inventor of the OpticMouse.
[51:20.000 --> 51:25.000]  Steve Kirsch is going to be joining us, and boy does he have a lot of points he wants to get to,
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  until a guest is ready and loaded for bear,
[51:28.000 --> 51:34.000]  and they send you a big list of things he wants to get into, and I want to get into all of it with him.
[51:34.000 --> 51:37.000]  So look for that coming up.
[51:37.000 --> 51:43.000]  But he's got the article out there first reporting that his sources say it's Guillain-Barre,
[51:43.000 --> 51:47.000]  or Bell's palsy that can be diagnosed both names, but the same thing.
[51:47.000 --> 51:52.000]  So the body's being paralyzed, usually Bell palsy's in the face, Guillain-Barre's in the extremities,
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  but both can be interchangeable.
[51:54.000 --> 52:01.000]  Gavin Newsom is out of sight, likely because he has Bell's palsy from his booster shot.
[52:01.000 --> 52:04.000]  He will be joining us coming up here in just a few minutes.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  I've got the big carbon tax news, the global government news,
[52:07.000 --> 52:16.000]  and it ties into university studies that close to 40% of students identify as LGBTQ.
[52:16.000 --> 52:22.000]  Also, 76% of students saying that they are African-American
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.000]  and getting led into college are Caucasian or Asian.
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.000]  And the school says, we don't care if you're Asian or white,
[52:29.000 --> 52:34.000]  biologically you're allowed to identify as black.
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.000]  And then actual black people don't get led into the school with the quota.
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.000]  This is just sickness on top of sickness on top of evil.
[52:42.000 --> 52:45.000]  And it's meant to destroy society, that's the plan, as Klaus Schwab said.
[52:45.000 --> 52:48.000]  But I just go off the actual globalist battle plans that are actually what they're doing.
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.000]  I mean, don't listen to me.
[52:51.000 --> 52:56.000]  Separately, listen, I'm in a total war with the New World Order
[52:56.000 --> 52:59.000]  and we don't have a bunch of big sponsors like the establishment does.
[52:59.000 --> 53:02.000]  We don't get any big globalist sugar daddy money.
[53:02.000 --> 53:03.000]  We get funded by you.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  You're my sugar daddy, the listeners and viewers, and I really appreciate you.
[53:06.000 --> 53:09.000]  We're fighting hard and we're the tip of the spear.
[53:09.000 --> 53:14.000]  So I want you all really just to think about the fact that when you shop at the big block stores,
[53:14.000 --> 53:17.000]  which we all do, sometimes you have to do it for convenience or they got things you want.
[53:17.000 --> 53:23.000]  You ought to also do some shopping with the Patriots and support the Patriots as much as you can.
[53:23.000 --> 53:27.000]  It's like tithing to the church that stands up against abortion or feeds the homeless.
[53:27.000 --> 53:32.000]  Tithes the local radio station that has the show on by becoming a sponsor,
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  a supporting sponsor, or give them a donation.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  It really goes a long way.
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.000]  I can't tell you how many stations where we've been on at night.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  They get good ratings, but Alex Jones is a little controversial.
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  They get enough calls, they get donations, even at commercial stations.
[53:44.000 --> 53:49.000]  And suddenly we're on live during the day, reaching tens of thousands in that town of new people.
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  That's how it happens.
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  So please support your local stations.
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  Please support us and go to infowarstore.com.
[53:56.000 --> 53:59.000]  We have the biggest sale of the year running right now.
[53:59.000 --> 54:02.000]  Store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points.
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  You usually get 5% off on your next order and it goes in your little membership there when you're, you know,
[54:06.000 --> 54:11.000]  sign up or buy stuff if you opt into it, you can then use those points in the future.
[54:11.000 --> 54:15.000]  Well, you got 10 points now on every purchase you make for your next purchase.

[54:25.000 --> 54:30.000]  But you get 10% off on the next order when you sign up for that item in auto-ship,
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.000]  also at infowarstore.com.
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  But that's always going.
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.000]  We always have the auto-ship discount of 10% additional.
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.000]  But right now we have store-wide free shipping and we have sold out now for two and a half years
[54:44.000 --> 54:48.000]  because we couldn't get the ingredients at the organic high standard we wanted.
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  It was a very popular item. It was like our fourth most popular item.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  We stopped selling ultimate bone broth.
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  And yes, it was concentrated.
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  Yes, it didn't have fillers.
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  Yes, it was very, very, very strong.
[54:59.000 --> 55:02.000]  And I wouldn't say they said horrible, but you know, some people didn't like it.
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  If you mix it in with, you know, milk and stuff and a little bit of chocolate,
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  I thought it tasted like ovaltine.
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  Well, we've reformulated it. It tastes a lot better and it's even stronger,
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.000]  more concentrated bone broth from chickens than ever with all of the immune system
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.000]  and bone boosting and cartilage boosting and chondroitin boosting,
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.000]  things it has in it. On top of it, it's got other anti-inflammatories in it,
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  like chocolate mushroom, a very strong high-quality turmeric,
[55:26.000 --> 55:32.000]  bee pollen and so much more made with cartilage bone broth, paleo ingredients,
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  the next generation of advanced paleo nutrition.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  Got a bunch of other stuff in it as well.
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  It's made out of organic, got organic cocoa.
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.000]  It's got organic minerals in it.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  I can't think of a stronger superfood.
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  And I've been taking a scoop every night before I go to bed
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  and I just drink it right down quickly with water.
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  I just, you know, don't even smell it. I just bang it back,
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  but I've tasted it and it tastes pretty good compared to the last formula.
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  And like I said, it's really amazing.
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.000]  We're very, very proud of it and it just is so good for you.
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  And it funds the M4 360 win.

[59:41.000 --> 59:44.000]  So thank you all for your support with supply chain breakdowns.
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  I recommend you get your Christmas shopping done now
[59:46.000 --> 59:50.000]  and have it done and support the InfoWare at infowarsstore.com.
[59:51.000 --> 59:56.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[59:56.000 --> 59:58.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  We're now into hour number two.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  I'm extremely excited that Steve Kersh is joining us.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  He is a philanthropist and executive director
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  of the Covenant 19 Early Treatment Fund,
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  also the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  I'll go over to Solbio when he joins us, trained,
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  and get an MIT.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  We're going to go over to all, start of the next segment,
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  and he's got a huge list of groundbreaking,
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Bob Schell, life-saving information.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  He's also got info.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  He's also got information.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  He's also got info on Governor Newsom from his sources.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  He's out in Silicon Valley, a lot of contacts.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  That's all coming up.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  The interview with Dr. Zalink yesterday was extremely powerful.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  The interview with Dr. McCullough was extremely powerful.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  Friday, both those are at Band-Aid video
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  and need to be shared desperately bad.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  I know our audience is awake.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  I know a lot of us, you know,
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  think we basically know all the information,
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  but there's constant new information coming out,
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  and the system just wants to overwhelm us psychologically
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  and just hopes that we all go away.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  Hopes that we basically submit to them
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  and just let them normalize living underneath this medical tyranny
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  that they are establishing and that they're setting up in this country.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  And so that interview with Dr. Zalinko
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  is posted on infowars.com as well.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  In fact, there was the title right there.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  A powerful interview.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  COVID jabs are premeditated first-degree murders,
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  as Dr. Zalinko, who, by the way, has terminal cancer
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  and said some really powerful things about the nature of reality
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  and consciousness on the broadcast yesterday.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  So I'm very excited about getting Stephen Kirsch on.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  He's one of the leading people out there organizing
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  the informed, educated resistance to what's going on.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  But some stations join us at the start of the second segment,
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  so I don't want to go to him quite yet,
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  but I do see that we have him now.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  So we're going to go to break here in just a moment
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  and come back with him.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  But first, I wanted to air a short video.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  The last time Dr. Zalinko was on with us,
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  and the title of that video was,
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  It Stops When You Say No.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  Here is that report also posted at Bandai Video.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  Listen, we need generals.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  We need people with platforms like Joe Rogan
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  and other people like that who are free-thinking spirits
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  who don't buy into the false narrative
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  and are able to kind of dig out the truth themselves.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  And they have to trust the people.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  So this is the key here. This is a narrative war.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  The enemies of humanity control the social media.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  They have a head start in social media and mainstream media.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  But we can catch up, and a little truth, a little light,
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  dispenses a lot of darkness.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  So I plead on people like Joe and Rogan
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  and other people with platforms
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  to wake up joy together as an army of truth speakers
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  and say no to these animals and these despots
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  and say as many people as we can with spreading the truth.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  The soul of humanity is at stake here.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  I had thousands, hundreds, probably thousands of sick patients
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  with no treatment.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  But what are you supposed to do? Let them die?
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  The whole, the government was telling us to send them home.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  The government is still telling us.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  NIH, as of today, tells you,
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  don't treat COVID, go home, then go to the hospital
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  and if the oxygen is less than 92, then you should be treated.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  That's a policy for government that wants you to die.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  Any policy that obstructs early pre-hospital treatment
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  is a policy of death.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  And I'm sorry to say this,
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  I have to be realistic and I have to protect humanity.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  I feel I have to let the world know
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  that we are being slaughtered
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  by a few sociopathic corrupt oligarchs
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  and corrupt governments and false promises.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  And we need to stop listening to these people saying no.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  I'm not going to let you kill me or my family
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  and the people I love.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  No.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  And come to my house and try to put a shot into my arm,
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  and listen to what happens to you.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  We'll get a different shot.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  The difference between us in Australia now
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  and the building who lives already
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  and then turning people into quarantine facilities
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  and putting ankle braces on people who don't want to take a shot
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  is that we have grown into a simulator.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  We'll be back.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  I am cutting this announcement on the...
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  It's now becoming accepted knowledge,
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  accepted fact that global government run by private corporations
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  is taking over the United States
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  and other formerly sovereign nations.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  They're being destroyed.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  All the checks and balances are being annihilated.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  Our borders are being destroyed.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  Our currency is being destroyed.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  And the American people have been listed as terrorists
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  by the rogue federal government.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  Info wars is going to continue to fight on
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  and there is a big awakening happening.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  We have a good chance of beating these people,
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  but we're not going to be able to stay on air
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  unless you support us and you've been doing it.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  So spread the word about the broadcast,
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  pray for the broadcast,
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  but also buy great products at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  If you're shopping with the big corporations
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  or the establishment, you're aiding the enemy.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  If you're funding us and getting great products,
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  you are helping lead the war effort.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  I cannot express to you how important it is
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  to buy your products and do your Christmas shopping
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  and do your Black Friday shopping at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  We've got store-wide free shipping right now
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  and double-patria points.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  Well, we had Dr. McCullough in studio with us last Friday
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  and he knocked it out of the park, a true leader,
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  and he said, listen, who I respect the most,
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  who really is on the ball like no other,
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  is Steve Kersh.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  And I said, absolutely, I've been trying to get him on.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  I guess I wasn't asking the right way.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  So he got us his contact info and he's here
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  and we're very, very thankful because
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  he's really been organizing the top minds out there
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  and has been fighting this incredible roll out of tyranny
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  that we've been witnessing.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  So I'm going to read his bio here.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  Steve Kersh is a philanthropist and executive director
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  and also the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  He is the inventor of the optical mouse
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  and one of the first internet search engines, InfoSeq.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  He has founded seven high-tech companies,
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  two with billion-dollar market caps.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  Steve is currently focused on safe and effective ways
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  in the pandemic.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  He received his BSMS in electrical engineering,
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  Peter Science from MIT in 1980.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  Steve has been featured in 60 Minutes for his work on funding,
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  phlemoxamine on the first repurposed drugs
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  to be shown in phase three clinical trials
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  to significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  and death from COVID.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  And he's at stevekersh.substack.com,
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  Twitter at STKersh,
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  and at GAB at STKersh as well, K-I-R-S-C-H.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  So I'm going to try to give him the floor
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  for the balance of the hour
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  because he's got quite the agenda to go over
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  and I hope we can get to every one of these key points
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  because I know he's a scientist
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  and you get from him is the real facts, the real research.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  Thank you so much for what you've done for humanity
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  and for my family and for my children personally, sir.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  Thank you.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  And I know you've also up front got some news on Gavin Newsom,
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  the 12th day he's missing.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  So thank you for joining us.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  Sure.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  I'm not quite sure where to start.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  Should we start with the Gavin
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  and then we'll dive into the details?
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  Yes, sir. Let's do that.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  All right.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  So Gavin's been out of sight for close to two weeks.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  The rumors are that he has facial paralysis
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  and so basically half of his face is paralyzed,
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  but typically that'll only last for a couple of days
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  and then it resolves.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  And so after two weeks, he can look completely normal.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  So he can go back and he's got a conference
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  that he's supposed to be on at 11.45,
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  which is in a couple hours from now.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  And so he could actually appear totally normal now
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  and he could just come up with some excuse to say,
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  well, you know, I was out of commission for some reason,
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  but you know that when you look at all of what's happened
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  in terms of you did your investigations,
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  I did my investigations and they were all consistent
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  with someone who was vaccine injured.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  And apparently from the looks of it,
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  it's Bell's policy because Bell's policy
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  tends to resolve fairly quickly.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  It's pretty common after a Moderna shot to have this
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  and then have it resolve quickly.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  It comes on within hours after getting the shot
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  and it would typically resolve within a couple of days.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  And so he may be able to escape this,
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  but you know, I think he's not being honest
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  if he's not telling people exactly what happened to him.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  And for those that don't know, I mean, Moderna,
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  in several European countries just this week,
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  they said the governments did.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  What in Sweden and in France and others
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  do not take it under the age of 30
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  because of a lot of problems happening there.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  And so they're admitting it's tied to microcarditis
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  but also, as you said, Bell's policy.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  Yeah, and well, you know, in fact,
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  I released today on my substack,
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  which you talked about earlier,
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  I released an article, it was an analysis
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  done by Albert Benavides
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  and Albert's also known as Welcome the Eagle 88 on Twitter.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  And he's been posting since January
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  about the problems with VAERS
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  and I asked him to do an analysis for me
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  where he would look at all,
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  he would run every single symptom
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  in the VAERS database
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  and then look for an elevated,
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  you know, which symptoms were elevated.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  And he found over 5,000 symptoms
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  that are elevated with this vaccine
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  versus all of the previous vaccines
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  over the last five years from 2015 to 2019
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  because he wanted to get it before COVID.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  And so when you look at the elevation
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  from baseline of 10X or more,
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  we're looking at 5,000 adverse events
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  that were reported and the most serious ones,
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  the ones at the top of the list, elevated by
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  close to 10,000 times,
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  these were all menstrual cycle related.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  And so this is really troubling
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  because this is what we had predicted.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  I was on a Dark Courts podcast
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  with Dr. Robert Malone and Brett Weinstein
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  and we sat back then that, you know,
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  the bio-distribution data shows that this thing
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  really targets the ovaries
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  and it also interferes with the male reproductive organs as well.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  And so we're actually seeing the results of this
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  in the numbers.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  So we're seeing, like, at the very top,
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  it was stunning, is menstrual issues, menstrual issues,
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  menstrual issues, menstrual issues, menstrual issues.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  I mean, it is really unbelievable.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  And for the CDC to ignore all of this stuff
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  is just mind-boggling because it's basically
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  neurologically, very serious neurologically events,
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  very serious cardiovascular events,
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  and of course, interference with the male and female
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  reproductive systems.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  So, you know, this is something that everybody
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  should take a look at this analysis.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  Please continue because I've got a lot of questions,
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  but the list you sent is all extremely important.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  Sure.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  You know, like cardiac arrest is very high on the list
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  and so this can basically cause people to drop dead
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  just, you know, instantly with no warning at all.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  And, you know, we've seen this on the,
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  we've seen players on the soccer fields, for example,
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  in plain sight.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  There was a study done and they looked at,
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  they found that in the last four months
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  we've had more on-field incidents than in the last 20 years.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  And so that's an elevated risk of, you know, 60 times.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  So, you know, a lot of people will look at VAERS
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  and say, oh, well, that's overreported.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  Well, no.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  When you're on the soccer field, that's not overreported.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  It's in everybody's plain sight.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  And we're seeing, there's a neurologist I know.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  She has 20,000 patients.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  She's got 2,000 cases that she needs to report
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  to VAERS this year.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  And in the past, she's been in practice for 11 years.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  In 11 years, she's never had to report a single case.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  And this year, it's 2,000 cases.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  So 10% of her client base needs to be reported
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  to VAERS this year.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  We're zero in all 11 years combined.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  So that's, you cannot explain that and just say,
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  oh, well, that's just overreported.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  But this vaccine is the most dangerous vaccine
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  in human history.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  It's 800 times more deadly than the previous record holder.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  And the previous record holder was a smallpox vaccine,
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  which would kill one person per million vaccinated.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  This kills over 800 people per million vaccinated.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  And so it ends up being over 150,000 deaths.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  And we have eight different ways that we go and look at that
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  to show that there are over 150,000 people
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  that have actually been killed by this vaccine.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  And I offered a million-dollar reward
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  for one of the analysis, one of the eight analysis
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  that was done by Matthew Crawford,
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  who's a brilliant statistician.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  And he did it on 35% of the world's population.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  So it's hardly cherry-picking.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  He had a criteria for what he included
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  and what he excluded.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  And it's not like you're some bum,
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  you're a very successful, wealthy inventor and scientist,
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  and you're offering a million bucks,
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  and no one's been able to take it or take the challenge,
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  because what you're saying is true.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  And that's what's crazy,
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  is they're now admitting these shots
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  don't really give you immunity.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  They're admitting it erases immunity.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  They're admitting it's connected to all these illnesses and death,
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  and they just are now going after our children.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  I mean, this just sounds like the establishment has a death wish.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  Well, I don't think it's a death wish.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  They're pretty clueless.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  And I think the CDC has done a good job of keeping people in the dark,
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  because the CDC has said nobody has died from these vaccines,
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  and that's just patently untrue.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  There's absolutely no way.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  I would bet $100 million on that one.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  If they really think it's untrue,
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  but nobody in the world will take my bet.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  I mean, I even upped the number to...
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  Do you think less than 500 people are killed by...
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  were killed by these vaccines in America?
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  I will bet you easily.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  $10 million, whatever, to, you know, let's have a bet.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  But look, nobody really thinks that's true,
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  because nobody's taking my bet.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  You know, you can raise money from friends, whatever.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  I'll do it for a million dollars.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  Absolutely.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  Steve Kerr, stay there.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  You've got so many important things to get to,
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  but this is an incredible time to be alive.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  And I want to try to get to the bottom of this on the other side.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  Is this on purpose,
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  or is this really the establishment being this stupid?
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  It comes at the end...
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  It's now becoming accepted knowledge,
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  accepted fact that global government run by private corporations
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  is taking over the United States
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  and other formerly sovereign nations.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  They're being destroyed.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  All the checks and balances are being annihilated.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  Our borders are being destroyed.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  Our currency is being destroyed.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  And the American people have been listed as terrorists
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  by the rogue federal government.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  Info Wars is going to continue to fight on.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  And there is a big awakening happening.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  We have a good chance of beating these people.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  But we're not going to be able to stay on air
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  unless you support us, and you've been doing it.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  So spread the word about the broadcast.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  Pray for the broadcast,
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  but also buy great products at infowarshow.com.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  If you're shopping with the big corporations
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  or the establishment, you're aiding the enemy.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  If you're funding us and getting great products,
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  you are helping lead the war effort.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  I cannot express to you how important it is
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  to buy your products and do your Christmas shopping
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  and do your Black Friday shopping at infowarshow.com.

[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  we put in Info Wars live products.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  And that's why for more than two years,
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  We've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  So out of all the bone broths out there,
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  I'm telling you this is next level.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  Cutting-edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  for better flavor and dissolvability.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom,
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  and a bunch of other amazing known berries
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  that turbocharge your body with antioxidants.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  like magnesium, potassium, and sodium added.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  And it just goes on and on.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  It is now back in stock, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus,
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  available at 20% off and free shipping out of the gates
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  After being unavailable for more than two years,
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  Ultimate Bone Broth is back at InfoWarsLife.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  Ultimate Bone Broth is now Ultimate Bone Broth Plus
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  because we've made it even stronger and reformulated it.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  And listen, it's not just concentrated chicken broth in there
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  that's so good for your joints, your bones, and your whole body.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  It's got really strong high-end turmeric root,
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry,
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  alfalfa herb powder, and a bunch of other stuff in it
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  like real organic cocoa, bean powder with natural chocolate flavor,
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  and a touch of sea salt, and just on and on and on.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  Magnesium, potassium's added.

[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  for your whole body.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  Grandma always gave you chicken soup when you were sick.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  Remember, that's a tiny amount of the same stuff
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  that's in there that is now in here in a very large amount.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  So again, get the power of Grandma's chicken soup
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  with the power of turmeric and everything else
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  with the new and improved Bone Broth at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  I am cutting this announcement on the afternoon of Thursday,

[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  So thank you all for your support with supply chain breakdowns.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  I recommend you get your Christmas shopping done now
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:20:15.000]  and have it done and support the InfoWare at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  Let's go right to our special guest, Steve Kersh,
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  who is a real successful scientist and researcher,
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  and one of the leading lights out there
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  exposing this disaster, this global medical disaster
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  that we see with this mRNA revolution
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  that Fauci and others have talked about.
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  So, Mr. Kersh, I want to go through all these great points
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  you've got to make here because there's so much to get to,
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  but you were saying that they're idiots
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  and they don't know what they're doing.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  I mean, I'm sure there are a lot of folks
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  who think this is good and are ignoring the facts of the science
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  and just moving forward, but big tech is suppressing
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  the illnesses and the problems.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  There's major censorship by big pharma,
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  and I know that they did studies on mRNA systems before
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  and it did have some of these similar problems.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  And so are you saying they're just idiots from the top down
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  or are you saying that there's certain compartmentalized groups
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  that don't know what's going on because I believe,
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  like Dr. Zelenko and others do,
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  this is a global forced depopulation plan.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  He really thinks it's a route at it.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  I know we're in an area of some speculation here,
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  but I mean, now this stuff's out in the open.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  If they didn't know before, they certainly know now.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  Yeah, I think it's wishful thinking.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  People want to believe, like Tony Fauci has said,
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  the vaccine is the only way out of this pandemic.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  There is no other solution.
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  Early treatment doesn't work. It's vaccine or die.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  So you're saying it's magical thinking?
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  Yeah, I mean, people want to believe that Tony Fauci is right
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  and they want to make sure that the vaccine works.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  So everybody's looking the other way, right?
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  They're either looking the other way
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  or they're forced to look the other way
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  because their livelihood is threatened.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  So it's very much this wishful thinking that's going on.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  So when the CDC basically says no one's died,
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  there are no side effects, it's safe and effective,
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  people aren't double checking it.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  You know, I talked to doctors and I said,
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  well, you should look at the various data.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  You should look at actually the data.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  And even looking at the Pfizer trial,
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  the six-month trial showed that for every 22,000 people we inject,
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  we're only going to save one COVID life.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  That means you inject 220 million people.
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  You're only going to save 10,000 lives.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  And that's from Pfizer's own data.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  But nobody's looking at that data
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  because that part wasn't in the abstract.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  So people aren't really looking for trouble here.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  They're just saying, let's believe the CDC.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  Let's presume they're telling the truth.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  The CDC hasn't found any causal relationships here.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  And so we should just say that it's safe and effective
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  and we're going to turn a blind eye
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  because this is the only way out.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  And even if we kill the 100,000 people,
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  that's better than killing 600,000 people.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  And so the cure is better than the disease.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  But in fact, it's the opposite.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  I mean, the Pfizer trial shows that we're going to save
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  like 10,000 people so far.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  But we've already killed over 150,000.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  So we've already killed 15 Americans
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  for every one that we might save.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  And that's really, really tragic.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  And people are saying, I talked to my friends
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  and they say, well, look at the people we're saving.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  Look at the hospitalization rates are down.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  Well, first of all, we don't have really good ways
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  to track that.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  The hospitals have terrible ways
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  of tracking vaccination status.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  And so they never reveal the data sources on that.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  And we think far fewer than 700,000 people
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  have died from COVID.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  It might be on the order of 100,000 or so.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  But we don't really know the true number
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  because the stats are corrupted
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  because it's people who die with COVID
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  instead of from COVID.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  Exactly.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  I mean, they don't even deny the fact of the 800,000
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  they claimed out or whatever that almost all of them
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  died of a comorbidity or something completely different.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  What about the fact that in Australia, New Zealand,
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  Canada, Europe, the UK and the US
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  where we take Pfizer and Moderna shots,
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  they're reporting mystery illnesses in hospitals
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  filled to record capacity with supercolds
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  that sounds, according to doctors,
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  I've interviewed a lot like ADE,
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  also a lot of microcarditis and things like that.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  Yeah, so we haven't really seen evidence of classical ADE.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  What we do see evidence of is vaccine-enhanced
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  replication and infectivity.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  And so that's different from classical ADE,
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  but it's on the same sort of thing.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  Please tell us what it is, Steve.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  Yeah, so what happens is that the vaccine
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  suppress your immune system,
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  so it's going to make you more likely to get COVID
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  and that suppression can last for weeks
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  or lasts for months or lasts for the rest of your life.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  We don't have really good statistics on that,
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  but in the UK, the numbers are that
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  if you're age 40, for example,
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  that after several months, I think it's like six months,
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  vaccine efficacy goes negative to like 104%,
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  which means that you're twice as likely to get COVID
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  if you've been vaccinated.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  And that's like the opposite of the story.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  And we hear a record skip right there.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  That's even admitted.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  Well, what you're saying for new listeners is not even debated.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  CNN even had a headline this morning explaining that.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  Their answer, though, is more shots,
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  so it gives you a negative immunity
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  compared to what they're saying the answer is more.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  Right, and that's, you know, look,
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  vaccination using a non-sterilizing vaccine
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  in the middle of a pandemic
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  is the absolutely the wrong strategy to take.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  And Gurt Vandenbosch has been correct on this
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  from the very beginning.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  He's predicted exactly what's happening.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  And nobody's listening to him.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  And he's saying like injecting our children with this
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  is absolutely insane.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  I mean, it can damage them
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  and damage their immune systems for life.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  It's something that we will never recover from.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  And we should just put a pause on this
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  because the risk-benefit analysis,
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  when you do it on the 5 to 11-year-olds,
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  is we're going to kill 117 kids
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  for every kid that we might save from COVID.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  And it's crazy.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  But, you know, the panels
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  aren't even showing the number needed to vaccinate.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  Right, it's 1.6 million.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  You have to vaccinate 1.6 million kids
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  in order to save one life theoretically.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  But when you're looking at killing,
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  you know, 10 or 20 in that age range
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  per million per vaccinated child,
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  you know, you're talking about hundreds of deaths
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  that are completely needless.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  And that's just counting deaths.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  I mean, we're not talking at all about disabilities.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  You know, the story of Maddie DeGerry,
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  you know, she was one of the 1,000 kids,
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  1,100 kids in the Pfizer 12 to 15 trial.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  After her second dose, less than 24 hours later,
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  she became paralyzed.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  She couldn't walk off the bus.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  Now, she's, it appears she's permanently paralyzed.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  She has to eat through a feeding tube.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  She can't walk on her own.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  She can't feel below her waist.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  I mean, and you know what?
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  The FDA promised to investigate.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  You know what they did?
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  They didn't investigate at all.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  They didn't even call her.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  The FDA didn't call her.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  The CDC didn't call her.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  Pfizer didn't call her.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  And it's just tragic.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  Well, what about the revolving door too of the Pfizer executives
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  being on the board of the FDA and the CDC?
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  I mean, I think that should be illegal.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  Yeah, there's, there's a lot of conflict of interest here.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  And, and I talked to, I was curious as to why this happens.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  And none of the people on the panel will talk to me directly.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  So I talked to a friend of one of the panel members.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  I won't say whether it's the FDA panel or the CDC panel.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  But what he said is that this panel member voted in favor of the 5-11 vaccine
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  because he thought that kids who had comorbidities
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  would benefit from the lower than one-third dose.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  And I'm pointing it out that, well, that makes no sense
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  because the doc, his doctor could prescribe it off-label
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  at a one-third of the dose and he would have access to it.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  And so the rationale doesn't even make any sense.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  Hold on.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  Explain as we come back.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  It's important.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:58.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:33:11.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  We'll be back with our special guest.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  All they've done is lied to us the whole time.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  So under his yardstick, he'll go to jail, too.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  Yeah, they've, you know, I asked, my congresswoman is Anna Eshoo.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  I asked Anna Eshoo, hey, would you send a letter to the NIH asking for Tony Fauci's unredacted emails?
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  Because any committee chairman in Congress can send a letter, all it takes is a letter, a letter to the NIH.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  And the NIH said that they would do what the letter requests, which is to give them the unredacted emails of Tony Fauci.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  Anna Eshoo's office stopped talking to me at that point.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  They do not answer me any more on the questions that I asked.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  All I'm asking for is, look, Biden couldn't figure out whether the virus was created by man or it was created naturally.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  Well, Tony Fauci's unredacted emails would reveal that.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  And all a member of Congress who's a committee chairman had to do was just simply write a letter and requested Tony Fauci's unredacted emails and we will have the evidence that we need.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  But they never did that because they know what would happen.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  Well, Steve, we need to get you on Joe Rogan.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  I guarantee you, and I think Joe's listening right now. We've been texting back and forth.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  We really need to get you on Joe Rogan's show.
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  I know you're already going on some giant Dark Horse podcast and others.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  There's some of his favorite scientists, but you're a great scientist.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  And now that you've been censored, you know, even more, this just shows they're scared of the research you're doing.
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  And in the 45 minutes to an hour we've had, we haven't scratched the surface.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  You're really a leading guy educating people about natural, but also off-label drugs out there that are good treatments for COVID and other things in the suppression of science.
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  Your work is so wide. I'd like to invite you back on soon to go over that because we only scratched the surface.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  In the few minutes we have left, again, I want to thank you for your work.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  I want to invite you to come on a commercial-free podcast with me that millions also watch that way you're not getting, you know, breaks here, but we have a lot of radio affiliates.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  So it's, you know, we're obviously happy to still do that.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  But what other areas would you like to direct people to get more informed?
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  Well, you can follow me on GAB. You know, that's the easiest thing to do, STKersh on GAB.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  I have a website, skersh.io. It's got a lot of information about vaccines and it also has information about treatments like fluvoxamine and other early treatments.
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  So fluvoxamine was recently shown in a phase three trial that it reduced your chance of death by more than 12 times.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  And yet nobody from the NIH or from the WHO is talking about this.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  I mean, that's preposterous. You know, it's all over the press, but the NIH is completely silent about this and the WHO is completely silent about it.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  And they've been briefed the whole time. They knew this was coming. They've been briefed.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  And when the paper finally got published in the Lancet, which I was skeptical it would ever happen, when it got published, they did nothing.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  They do not care if people die. This is what's really tragic is that I discovered that the system is gamed here.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  Drugs like Ivermectin work. We also know that hydroxychloroquine work. I was the one who funded David Bowler's trial.
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  And if you analyze the data correctly, you will find that it's statistically significant that hydroxychloroquine doesn't work.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  Steve, Steve, we got to go to break, but what you're saying is so important here.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  And how big a blow is the system that now the British Medical Journal and others are doing major studies and agreeing with you?
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  I mean, it seems like Germany just said, whoa, let's not give kids the shot today.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  I mean, it seems like the wheels are starting to come off this. So that's some good news.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  Yeah, the wheels are starting to come off the bus.
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  And, you know, like these FDA people that say, oh, I don't want to get, you know, a black mark on me for voting no against this.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  They're going to get a black mark on them as you, Genesis, violating the Nuremberg Code, violating the law and approving this stuff.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  I mean, that's what they ought to be worried about.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  Yeah. Well, you know, for that to happen, and I talked to people about that, you know, you're going to Congress has to allow the Nuremberg codes actually to happen.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  And so right now we have people in Congress who basically not like, I don't know if a single person in Congress, you know, short of a couple of senators, Ron Johnson and Rand Paul, who want to talk to me.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  Um, like I, I have relationships that go, you know, decades or more.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  And I cannot get five seconds to talk to people about vaccine safety.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  But it's more important is that I have a team that I work with of a 24 sign.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  Hold on. We got to go to break. If you knew five more minutes, this is a two minute break. If you've got to go.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  I understand Steve Kersh finding on gab at SD Kersh.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  Now, what's shown is find us at info wars.com news wars.com and band out video.

[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  And that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of ultimate bone broth and we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  And we have reformulated and not just use the same ingredients.
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  We've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:09.000]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.

[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  And it just goes on and on.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  It is now back in stock ultimate bone broth plus available at 20% off and free shipping out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[2:00:09.000 --> 2:00:11.000]  All right, Steve Kersh is amazing.
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  And I've only covered like the 30 talking points.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  He sent five of them.
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  So I'm going to ask him to come back on in the near future because this is this is just so incredible.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:21.000]  He got some good news though.
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  It looks like his Twitter account is not suspended for thought crime.
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  Tell us more about that.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  And then you were going to finish your comment about a Nuremberg code and how we need to get justice here and stop this nightmare.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  Yeah, so my Twitter account was not suspended.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  They sent me a verification email to verify your phone number and usually, you know, that's kind of a bad sign.
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  So I did that and got back in.
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  And so my Twitter account was not suspended.
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  So you can follow me on Twitter.
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  I don't know why you would think that that ever would happen.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  They're only censoring everybody else.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  Well, you know, I think of it as a badge of honor that I'm getting their attention.
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  And but yeah, they're definitely looking at you right now.
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  So so you only a few senators will talk to you.
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  You're saying others are sticking their head in the sand hoping this goes away.
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  It's not going away.
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  Biden and everybody's coming for our children.
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  I mean, Europe is saying don't give this to under 16s or under 30s, but he doesn't care.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  He says, dammit, I'm coming after your children.
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  Yeah, you know, look, what's tragic is that the American public is only hearing one side of the story.
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  You know, on CNN, you're only going to hear one side of the story.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  If you really want to hear the other side, you're going to have to go to alternate media.
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  You're going to have to go into into interwar wars.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  You're going to have to go to Fox News and even Fox News is only giving you a portion of what's out there.
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  So we don't really have fair and balanced here for for the vaccines.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  You're only hearing from one side of the story.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:59.000]  You're only hearing the CDC's point of view and the CDC has and the FDA and even Pfizer has refused to debate us.
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  Nobody will come on camera so we can have a scientific discussion.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  And it used to be, you know, in the old days, science wasn't suppressed.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  You know, and nowadays, Jessica Rose did a paper.
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  She wrote a paper with Peter McCullough and it was published in an Elsevier journal.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  And then the publisher Elsevier itself said, we're going to we're going to go and remove that article.
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  And they gave no reason for doing that.
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  And I heard that it was because it wasn't invited.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  But of course, the editor of the journal wanted the paper to be published.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  And, you know, so we're seeing suppression of the underlying science and we're not seeing anybody in the medical community complaining about fraud and clinical trials and phase three clinical trials.
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  You know, we're not seeing anyone in the medical community complaining that papers that expose the dangers of these vaccines are being suppressed by the medical journals.
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  Not by the editor, not by the peer reviewers, but by the publisher of the journal.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  You know, and so the medical community should be outraged at this, but they're not saying anything.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  And the medical community should be outraged that we're not giving people informed consent because we're not allowing people to hear from people like me who are giving out this stuff.
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  It's based on the evidence and the science and it's in front of people that can verify it themselves.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  Everything that I write is all based on government data, based on government methodologies.
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  And like the deaths told is calculated eight different ways only one of which uses various.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  So if you complain about my various analysis, fine, then show me the other how the other seven are wrong.
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  Well, I mean, what about the Pentagon's AI project they admitted last year?
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  And it shows an even higher death rates.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  Yeah, yeah, you know, the same thing.
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  And you know, Peter McCullough asked me to do a stratification by age to see, well, does the vaccine make sense for any age group?
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  And I found out that, well, even for 80 year olds, we're going to kill two 80 year olds to save one.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  And for if you're 20 years old, 20 to 30, it was we kill six people to save one.
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  And this is death.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  This is, you know, you don't even make it on death.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  You can't even justify this on death.
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  I mean, we're not even talking about the, the, the morbidities because, you know, people are disabled by this.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  More people are disabled than are killed by this.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  So we're looking at hundreds of thousands of people who are permanently disabled.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  You're right.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  Listen, Steve Kirsch, thank you so much for the time.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  Steve Kirsch on sub on sub stack and of course on gab and on Twitter.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  Amazing interview.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  Thank you so much for your time and your dedication to humanity.
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  We really appreciate you.
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  Yeah, my pleasure.

[2:04:57.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  I am cutting this announcement on the.

[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  We're now into hour number three.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  What an incredible last hour with Steve Kersh.
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  I did not plug last hour like most radio stations plug every segment and I because they need to stay on air.
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  Because most folks tune out during the commercials but I didn't do it one time last hour even though we need the money to operate because the information was so life saving so powerful.
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  And that's why I'm just asking listeners to realize that if you don't fund info wars we won't be on air.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:21.000]  We have the Democratic Party and a lot of other really evil organizations working around the clock try to shut us down and I've got strategies and I've got operations that won't just defeat that but will actually make our message when it comes to getting information out that much stronger.
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  But I need capital to do it and I make it very easy for you to support info wars because we have a lot of really amazing products available at info wars store.com.

[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  It's 40% off.

[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  We couldn't get it back in.
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  This is even new and improved even better.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  I can tell you this is the strongest best bone broth slash anti-inflammatory.
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  Condroitin type product out there.
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  It really, really is amazing and we only bring it the best and it's less cost than the leading competitor that's in the exact same type of container with just concentrated chicken broth because we get it from basically the same place, same developer manufacturer.
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  So we know this has the best brand out there according to experts of very actually tasty, good concentrated chicken broth.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  Whole chicken broth.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  It's all in there and so it's got the natural leucosamine, chondroitin and all that in there and it's chemically active because it's in the natural format.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  It's not been turned into some distillate out of it.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  It's not been burned and cooked until there's no value anymore.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  It's really a high end product.
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  We're very excited it's back.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  You need to try it out.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  If you haven't tried it or if you're an old fan favorite of this and you liked it, get it again.
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  It's just amazing what it does for your joints and your body and everything else.
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  That's AAA-253-3139.
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  And we have Ultra 12 back in stock at 60% off but it's going to sell out quick so that sales going to end soon.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  And people get it and they go, man, why does it taste so sweet but it doesn't say any sugar in it?
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  B12 when it's actually organic.
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  This is medical grade.
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  This is the highest end out there.
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  It's sweet naturally and you take it under the tongue.
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  And so just like an injection, it goes into your bloodstream.
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  All you do is run your tongue, let it sit there.
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  It infuses your mouth and it goes into the blood vessels and it's amazing.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  And all I want to do is stay in the fight against the globalist.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  So thank you for going to the site and getting the ball cap or some t-shirts or some books or some films or water filtration, air filtration, shortwave radios, a survival gear, all sorts of cool stuff at Infowarsstore.com.
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  Okay, let me do this.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  We spent 80% of the last two hours on the COVID world government police state rollout and it's incredibly important.
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  And we're going to have another medical doctor on at the bottom of the hour that the system is trying to take their medical license because they've been fighting the globalist exposing it.
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  And so we're going to have that special guest will tell you about when they join us at the bottom of the hour.
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  But if you want to pull back and see the big picture and see where the future is going, well, you've already gotten a good look at it.
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  And so let's talk about where they've taken us and what they've done to us.
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  Here's a headline out of the LA Times.
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  Faced with growing Ds and Fs, schools are ditching the old way of grading.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  Remember 20 years ago when we learned they were going to start having fuzzy math and fuzzy English and fuzzy science, people didn't believe it.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  Now it's official and many school districts in California and in Maryland and other areas have zero students passing, reading, writing and arithmetic.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  But that's okay.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  Now they're teaching you about critical race theory and about how you can be a girl if you're a boy or a boy of your girl, vice versa, and all this mental illness.
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  And then you can go to a hip hop concert and listen to auto tuned robots while portals to hell are open and you get stampeded to death.
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  Just like I talk about an in-game 2.0 with the government documents where they plan to re-institute superstition, human sacrifice.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  They want to destroy the ability to even read.
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:31.000]  They don't just get rid of the language itself in 1984.
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  The system they want in the real world is you can't even read or can't even grasp basic systems of understanding.
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  So even if someone wants to save you or educate you, you can't be saved.
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  And then you become a worthless member of society, so then those of us that are awake are forced to then join the globalists in removing the general population because you've been turned into something lower than animals.
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  There's the headline on Drudge Report.
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  I'll be talking about that next segment, the devil made him do it, blood sacrifice.
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  I wasn't sure about this some of the weekend, but now I saw the advertisements.
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  They ran front page of the Houston Chronicle and what was said, so I don't know if the artist Travis Scott or Drake were involved.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  Probably weren't, but the organizers certainly use classically satanic, portal to hell iconography and demonic invocations that are classic satanism.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  And then you add everything else to it.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  I'm going to give you my take on that, but look at this.
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  Faced with soaring, Ds and Fs, schools are ditching the old way of grading.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  Look at this.
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  It all ties together.
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  Infrastructure bill to require breathalyzer style systems in all cars.
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  It's now passed in his law.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  Little AI watching and tracking you at all times.
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  Don't believe me.
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  There it is.
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  Right out of Reuters and Newsmax.
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  Conversing to new car technology to stop drunken driving.
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  Oh my God.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  How about just a robot's on your shoulder with a gun to your head to make sure you're good too.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  Goal 13.
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  Take urgent action on climate to combat climate change and its impacts for the $150 trillion global budget.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  The UN said that 2019.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  Now it's what the Federal Reserve is publicly saying and that leads us to this poll.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  39% of 18, 24 year olds now identify as LGBTQ because they think it makes them more politically correct and cool.
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  Do I hate somebody just because they are attracted to the same sex?
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  No.
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  But people used to identify less than 1% is this.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  This is advertising.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  This is hype.
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  This is BS.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  And the same groups are now pushing pedophilia.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  This is destructive and it's designed to make you die alone.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  And then once the majority of people are not heterosexual or don't have relationships, then heterosexuals are hunted.
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  This already happens with the family courts across the country.
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  And our children are taken to be given to these people because they don't have children.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  It's a nightmare system for being hunted like the opening scene of Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston and he's running from the system.
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  Treasury Secretary Yellen admits net zero grand reset climate price tag will be $150 trillion more than the whole world GDP.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  So the UN says it two years ago and she clicks her heels and does it.
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  Welcome to the New World Order.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  And all the articles about for climate change don't have children.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  For climate change, be a homosexual so you don't have children.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  And then statistically more abusive relationships die alone.
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  And then we're told though, oh, the James Bond actor.
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  Oh, I only go to gay bars.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  I don't like heterosexuals.
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  They're mean and hurt women.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  What?
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:40.000]  That's all just a talking point out of an actor's mouth.
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  That's their plan.
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, but don't worry.
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  Buddha judge will respond to racist highway design and Kamala Harris is worried about racist trees and AOC is worried about racist cauliflower.
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  I'm not joking.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  Everything's racist.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:01.000]  It comes at the end of ultimate bone broth is back and better than ever.
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:10.000]  And 20% off plus free shipping and double Patriot points for a new sale after years of being off the shelves or bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas ever.
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  And it's now been reformulated as even stronger.
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  It's ultimate bone broth plus it's got concentrated high quality chicken broth protein.
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  Boomerick root that's so amazing chaga, mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:34.000]  It's got a real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  It even tastes better than last formula.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  And again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein, isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  You're going to love this and what it does for your joints, what it does for your body.
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  It does for your bones.
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:51.000]  It's simply amazing.
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  And it helps find the info war.
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  This is really the best bone broth out there.

[3:15:47.000 --> 3:16:15.000]  Thank you.
[3:16:15.000 --> 3:16:43.000]  Thank you.
[3:16:43.000 --> 3:17:11.000]  Thank you.
[3:17:11.000 --> 3:17:39.000]  Thank you.
[3:17:39.000 --> 3:18:07.000]  Thank you.
[3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:35.000]  Thank you.
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:19:03.000]  Thank you.
[3:19:03.000 --> 3:19:31.000]  Thank you.
[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:59.000]  Thank you.
[3:19:59.000 --> 3:20:15.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:31.000]  Live from the Summit Dot News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:59.000]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:59.000 --> 3:21:15.000]  In the United Kingdom for about a month when it happened back in 2012 because it was so rare for a professional football athlete at the top of his game, Pete physical fitness to just simply collapse on the pitch.
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:27.000]  So for a cardiac arrest and in that case nearly die. Thankfully he survived. But it was a news story for weeks. People were freaking out about it saying why did this happen? This is so rare.
[3:21:27.000 --> 3:21:43.000]  Now it's happening every week. It seems like even greater than every week as I talked about in the previous segment. This German newspaper has listed about I'd say 30 examples at least just over the past three months I guess from looking at this.
[3:21:43.000 --> 3:21:53.000]  I think they don't even include the Christian Eriksen example which happened in June last year, which is really the first example that we saw of this.
[3:21:53.000 --> 3:22:07.000]  So how does it go from being an incredibly rare happening for a professional football or peak physical condition to collapse and almost die on the field with cardiac issues to it happening all the time?
[3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:10.000]  Yeah, I wonder. I really wonder why that is.
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:24.000]  In the article they know that heart muscle inflammation myocarditis can already occur in the course of banal virus infections and lead to quote life threatening cardiac arrhythmias, but they don't question why.
[3:22:24.000 --> 3:22:41.000]  So many have happened over the past few weeks and few months despite the fact that the article is entitled puzzling heart diseases in football and they go on to cite quote an unusually large number of professional and amateur soccer players who have collapsed recently.
[3:22:41.000 --> 3:22:59.000]  They say it's puzzling, they say it's unusual, but then they don't explain why. I guess it just happened like a bolt from the blue. Just all these healthy fit young athletes just suddenly start developing heart problems out of the blue with no explanation whatsoever.
[3:22:59.000 --> 3:23:10.000]  Meanwhile, Information Liberation reports hospitals in America, Australia and Sweden are swamped with people sicker than ever and they don't have COVID.
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:23.000]  This was of course contained in an NPR article. We've covered it before. Some of those people are in hospital because of the delayed treatments that they weren't able to get because of lockdown and the disaster that that policy was.
[3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:29.000]  But not all of them. And again, they're saying we don't know why we have all these hospital patients. They're not COVID victims.
[3:23:29.000 --> 3:23:47.000]  Meanwhile, this is from daily skeptic.org and they have a very revealing graph in this article which is headlined awkward meltdown at the UK Health Security Agency over data showing infection rate higher in vaccinated than unvaccinated.
[3:23:47.000 --> 3:24:00.000]  So this is their own source data on vaccinated versus unvaccinated COVID case rates in the United Kingdom from the latest UK Health Security Agency vaccine surveillance report.
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:16.000]  These are the government's own numbers and what's funny about this and you'll see why is that these people within this agency have been writing letters freaking out trying to get this agency to either change how they present this data
[3:24:16.000 --> 3:24:24.000]  or to not even present it at all because it's proving to be very inconvenient in terms of what it says.
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:35.000]  And if you see this graph, you will see in every age group aside from below the age of 18 and slightly 18 to 29.
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:47.000]  As we know, those people show few symptoms and are very unlikely to get seriously ill from COVID. But in every other age group from the age of 30 onwards right up until 80 plus.
[3:24:47.000 --> 3:24:58.000]  Every single age group which has the highest case rate COVID infection case rate is fully vaccinated not unvaccinated.
[3:24:58.000 --> 3:25:04.000]  Every single age group aside from the lowest 18 and below and 18 to 29.
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:12.000]  So this blogger for this daily skeptic website wrote an article about quote the frantic attempts by the UK HSA.
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:22.000]  That's the official government body which releases this data to renounce its own data showing infection rates are higher in the vaccinated than they are in the unvaccinated.
[3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  And they link to the substack post. So this OSR director from this surveillance agency, I guess an affiliate agency that patrols what information is being put out,
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:48.000]  met with the UK HSA which is the group that produced that graph, the government agency, hours before they published it demanding they do something about these awkward graphs.
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:58.000]  He's not disputing that the information presented is accurate. He's just saying people are going to take this information and it's going to make us look bad.
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:07.000]  Again, we flash back to the Pfizer CEO saying people who post misinformation that makes people hesitant to get vaccine should be treated as criminals.
[3:26:07.000 --> 3:26:12.000]  What about people who post information directly from government websites?
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:24.000]  What about the person who made a Freedom of Information Act request to the UK government last year and asked how many people had died of COVID alone with no co-morbidities in UK hospitals.
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:31.000]  And they found that it was one tenth of the official COVID death toll based on the government's own numbers.
[3:26:31.000 --> 3:26:36.000]  And they had to publish that on the official Freedom of Information Act request UK government website.
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:45.000]  Again, that's another thing where it's the source material is coming directly from the government and they're panicking about it being public.
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:53.000]  So this observer wrote to the UK HSA government group saying that, yeah, these graphs may be correct.
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:56.000]  They may be statistically accurate, but they're awkward.
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:27:04.000]  And they responded by ditching the graphs altogether and calling every last number unadjusted.
[3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:13.000]  So they tried to claim that this wasn't as reliable as it could be because they didn't have time to adjust it to make it look better for their narrative.
[3:27:13.000 --> 3:27:15.000]  Says this failed to satisfy him.
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:19.000]  So in the days afterwards, he issued this unbelievable open letter.
[3:27:19.000 --> 3:27:33.000]  COVID-19 vaccine surveillance statistics says we focused on the risk that the risk that the data presented on rates of positive cases for those who are vaccinated and those who are unvaccinated have the potential to mislead.
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:37.000]  Even though it's direct source government data.
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:43.000]  And indeed, we know that these data have been used to argue that vaccines are, wait for it, ineffective.
[3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:53.000]  Because the fact that you're going to have to have a booster shot every six months until Kingdom come, surely doesn't suggest that the vaccines are ineffective, does it?
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:28:05.000]  The fact that the Israeli studies and others showed that natural immunity was 27 times more effective than the vaccine surely doesn't prove that the vaccines are ineffective, does it?
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:08.000]  Says we welcomed the changes that you've made.
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:10.000]  So they actually amended it.
[3:28:10.000 --> 3:28:16.000]  It's also very good you're working closely with my team and with the relevant teams in the Office for National Statistics.
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:43.000]  So they're absolutely prenging out and panicking over the fact that this group has published source vaccine data showing that in every instance in every age group, apart from 18 and below and 18 to 29, all the others 30 upwards until 80 plus shows that vaccinated people in every age group are more infected with COVID than unvaccinated.
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:28:52.000]  They're absolutely apoplectic that this information is being received by the public and now they're talking about just stopping the release of it all together.
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:54.000]  Very interesting, isn't it?
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:29:14.000]  So don't use, we'll be back.
[3:29:25.000 --> 3:29:33.000]  For electrolytes, it's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[3:29:33.000 --> 3:29:37.000]  It even tastes better than the last formula and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[3:29:37.000 --> 3:29:44.000]  And again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth, protein, isolate powder for better flavor and solvability.

[3:32:16.000 --> 3:32:21.000]  Our currency is being destroyed and the American people have been listed as terrorists by the rogue federal government.
[3:32:21.000 --> 3:32:25.000]  Info wars is going to continue to fight on and there is a big awakening happening.
[3:32:25.000 --> 3:32:27.000]  We have a good chance of beating these people,
[3:32:27.000 --> 3:32:30.000]  but we're not going to be able to stay on air unless you support us and you've been doing it.
[3:32:30.000 --> 3:32:33.000]  So spread the word about the broadcast, pray for the broadcast,
[3:32:33.000 --> 3:32:36.000]  but also buy great products at infowarstore.com.
[3:32:36.000 --> 3:32:40.000]  If you're shopping with the big corporations or the establishment, you're aiding the enemy.
[3:32:40.000 --> 3:32:44.000]  If you're funding us and getting great products, you are helping lead the war effort.
[3:32:44.000 --> 3:32:49.000]  I cannot express to you how important it is to buy your products and do your Christmas shopping
[3:32:49.000 --> 3:32:52.000]  and do your Black Friday shopping at infowarstore.com.
[3:32:52.000 --> 3:33:07.000]  We've got store-wide free shipping right now and double-patria points.
[3:33:23.000 --> 3:33:33.000]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom,
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:38.000]  it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:45.000]  The World Department within the UK doesn't account about their own vaccine virus-related statistics
[3:33:45.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  and beg for them to be amended, altered or not released at all
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:55.000]  in case the public get hold of them and weave inconvenient narratives based on their own source data.
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:34:01.000]  We still have the media lying about the current state of COVID infections in the United Kingdom.
[3:34:01.000 --> 3:34:04.000]  I've talked about it over the past few weeks.
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:08.000]  A few weeks ago, at the start of October, middle of October,
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:15.000]  they tried to create this propaganda drumbeat for a reintroduction of restrictions in the UK
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:20.000]  based on the expectation that COVID cases would rise into the winter.
[3:34:20.000 --> 3:34:26.000]  As I predicted at the time, we had a lot of COVID cases because the school kids, the university students
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:29.000]  who went back were being mass tested.
[3:34:29.000 --> 3:34:35.000]  Now they had their half-term break and indeed the evidence actually shows that the cases were falling before the half-term break.
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:42.000]  We have high natural immunity amongst young people who haven't had the vaccine yet in the vast majority of cases
[3:34:42.000 --> 3:34:47.000]  and that's why COVID cases in the UK were set to be on the decline once again
[3:34:47.000 --> 3:34:53.000]  and that's been proven precisely as I predicted it would in the past two, three weeks.
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:34:58.000]  Doesn't matter though because now they're just ignoring the case numbers altogether
[3:34:58.000 --> 3:35:03.000]  and in fact outright lying about the hospitalization numbers again to pressure to lobby the government
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:10.000]  into locking us down or at least reimposing masks and all that pointless crap once again.
[3:35:10.000 --> 3:35:17.000]  Headline media outlets report fake news that UK COVID hospitalizations are 14 times higher than last year.
[3:35:17.000 --> 3:35:22.000]  They were actually lower but don't stop the facts getting in the way of a good narrative.
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  UK media outlets report that COVID hospitalizations are 14 times higher than at this time last year
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:35.000]  which by the way, if that were the case, the NHS were supposed to be completely overwhelmed at this time last year
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:39.000]  which is why we had to have another lockdown and why they had to cancel Christmas.
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:46.000]  If it was 14 times higher now they'd be absolute bedlam by their own benchmark
[3:35:46.000 --> 3:35:52.000]  but it's demonstrably false. Both Sky News and ITV report the comments of NHS Chief Executive Amanda Pritchard
[3:35:52.000 --> 3:35:57.000]  who used the figure during a plea for people to take booster vaccines.
[3:35:57.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  Basically she used the completely wrong figure and then claimed that it was the latest figure that they had.
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:11.000]  It wasn't the latest figure that they had. They post the daily hospitalization figure on the NHS dashboard every single day.
[3:36:11.000 --> 3:36:19.000]  Anyone with an internet connection can go and look at it but apparently the much vaunted journalists at Sky News and ITN News
[3:36:19.000 --> 3:36:25.000]  couldn't be bothered to do that or deliberately just believed what they were fed by the official government source
[3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:31.000]  and blidely repeated it anyway and said that hospitalizations are 14 times higher.
[3:36:31.000 --> 3:36:37.000]  Surely now we need to lock down. It was completely fake news. Maybe they should be put in prison.
[3:36:37.000 --> 3:36:42.000]  The government wants to put people in prison for posting vaccine COVID misinformation
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:48.000]  and yet the mainstream media does it on a daily basis with no consequences whatsoever.
[3:36:48.000 --> 3:36:53.000]  Meanwhile, Scottish nightclubs bypass vaccine passport mandate by placing chairs on dance floor.
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:57.000]  This is absolutely incredible. Every nightclub should do this.
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:37:03.000]  Scottish nightclubs are bypassing the country's shambolic vaccine passport system by placing chairs on the dance floor
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:08.000]  and announcing that customers vaccine status won't be checked. Why are they doing that?
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  Because they're all going to go out of business otherwise. The profit margin is 15%.
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:20.000]  More than 15% of people in Scotland, young people haven't been vaccinated.
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:24.000]  They can't get into a nightclub. The nightclubs are going to go out of business.
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:30.000]  Bear in mind this vaccine passport system in Scotland was a complete disaster from its very outset.
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:35.000]  They had to delay its introduction for three weeks because the technology kept failing.
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:41.000]  And as we predicted, bouncers, nightclub people on the door were getting abused because they wouldn't let people in
[3:37:41.000 --> 3:37:46.000]  if they didn't have the vaccine. Shotcora, still a lot of young people don't have the vaccine.
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:52.000]  So now this nightclub in Edinburgh got around it by placing chairs on the dance floor
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  and then if you don't officially have a dance floor, it's a loophole and the rule doesn't apply to you
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:06.000]  because then you're basically a pub, a restaurant, which at the moment don't mandate vaccine passports for entry in Scotland.
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:12.000]  I know that as of a couple of hours ago, Wales, which passed that dodgy vaccine passport vote
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:17.000]  because the one member couldn't connect on a Zoom call, the government would have lost the vote otherwise,
[3:38:17.000 --> 3:38:25.000]  have now introduced vaccine passports for cinemas. So good luck to all the cinemas in Wales that are now going to go out of business.
[3:38:25.000 --> 3:38:31.000]  Of course, in Ireland, they introduced vaccine passports and masks for nightclubs,
[3:38:31.000 --> 3:38:37.000]  but they said that you didn't need to wear the mask when you were on the dance floor or when you were drinking.
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:41.000]  So basically, I guess if you just dance to the bar or the toilet,
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  Covid has some kind of artificial intelligence when it knows when people are dancing and doesn't infect them.
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:53.000]  And yes, that's a rule that's still in place as stupid as it is.
[3:38:53.000 --> 3:38:59.000]  Meanwhile, Dr Bant from Using Social Media Over Masks Do Nothing Claim takes case to High Court.
[3:38:59.000 --> 3:39:06.000]  A doctor who was banned by the General Medical Council from discussing Covid-19 on social media after claiming masks do nothing
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:11.000]  has taken his case to the High Court in London. This is Dr Samuel White,
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:18.000]  whose registration with the GMC was put under a threat after he posted a video to Instagram and Twitter in June
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  in which he said he could no longer stomach the lies surrounding the NHS and the government's response to the pandemic,
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:31.000]  which he said was so vast, while also asserting that, quote, masks do nothing.
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  Of course, this is an assertion that was made by Dr Anthony Fauci himself back at the start of the pandemic
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  when he admitted that masks were completely pointless. Typical store-bought face mask, he said, is, quote,
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:49.000]  not really effective in keeping out the virus, which is small enough to pass through the material.
[3:39:49.000 --> 3:39:53.000]  That's the quote from Dr Anthony Fauci.
[3:39:53.000 --> 3:39:59.000]  That was echoed by another sage government advisor, Dr Colin Axon, even more recently,
[3:39:59.000 --> 3:40:06.000]  who noted that the Covid-19 virus particle is up to 5,000 times smaller than the holes in the mask,
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  but keep wearing your masks from that 10-yard walk from the restaurant door to the dinner table,
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:19.000]  because it's absolutely vital Covid knows when you're walking from the restaurant door to a dinner table,
[3:40:19.000 --> 3:40:24.000]  just as it knows when you're dancing, and that's when it either chooses to leave you alone or infect you
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  based on your movements and personal behaviour. It's developed artificial intelligence at this point.
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:35.000]  Meanwhile, in Germany, Angela Merkel says, quote, we did it.
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:40.000]  Suggests 2015 influx of migrants into Germany was a huge success.
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:45.000]  This is during an interview with Deutsche Well, which occurred, by the way,
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:51.000]  about a day after a Syrian migrant stabbed four people on a high-speed train in Germany.
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:40:55.000]  It was a huge success. Obviously, that was importing all those Syrian migrants.
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:40:59.000]  She was asked about a 2015 press conference comment in which she said,
[3:40:59.000 --> 3:41:05.000]  Germany's ability to absorb large numbers of refugees was basically, yeah, we can do it.
[3:41:05.000 --> 3:41:11.000]  Now she's backed up that claim six years later and said, quote, yes, we did it.
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:16.000]  Despite some setbacks, there are many positive stories that emerged from the policy,
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:22.000]  according to Angela Merkel. What those positive stories were, I don't really know.
[3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:27.000]  Maybe it was the 1,000 German women who were raped and molested by North African migrants
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:33.000]  on New Year's Eve in Cologne. Maybe it was the rejected asylum seeker from Somalia
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:38.000]  who murdered three women in Würzburg with a knife just a few months ago.
[3:41:38.000 --> 3:41:43.000]  Maybe it was the case of Maria Landenberger, the daughter of an EU official
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:47.000]  who was raped, murdered, and dumped in a river by an Afghan migrant
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:54.000]  who entered Germany as a refugee after this policy that Merkel introduced in November 2015.
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  Maybe that was one of the positive stories that Merkel's talking about.
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:02.000]  Maybe another one was the 2016 Christmas truck attack,
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:07.000]  which was carried out by a failed Tunisian asylum seeker.
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:13.000]  Maybe it was the Afghan refugee, Abdel Dees, stabbed his 15-year-old German girlfriend to death
[3:42:13.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  because she broke up with him. Maybe it was the drastic increase in violent crime,
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:26.000]  as even reported by Reuters, which a study showed was more than 90% the fall of young male refugees.
[3:42:26.000 --> 3:42:33.000]  Again, a lot of positive, glowing examples of how Angela Merkel's 2015 policy
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:37.000]  of allowing up to a million migrants from North Africa and the Middle East
[3:42:37.000 --> 3:42:43.000]  proved such a sterling, shining success for Germany and continues to be.
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:48.000]  We're going to come back and go to this social engineering in TV commercials video,
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  really important video for men. I'll cover a couple of final news stories too.

[3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:11.000]  is taking over the United States and other formerly sovereign nations.
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:14.000]  They're being destroyed. All the checks and balances are being annihilated.
[3:45:14.000 --> 3:45:17.000]  Our borders are being destroyed. Our currency is being destroyed

[3:47:23.000 --> 3:47:28.000]  In America, every elected official in U.S. city of Hamtramuk is Muslim.
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:35.000]  This is the Michigan city of Hamtramuk with a Muslim population of over 50%
[3:47:35.000 --> 3:47:39.000]  who voted for themselves as an identity block.
[3:47:39.000 --> 3:47:44.000]  The Sixth Member City Council of Hamtramuk will consist of all Muslims starting in January,
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:48.000]  another historic first for the Metro Detroit city.
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:53.000]  The newly crowned mayor of this city, Amir Ghalib, is also Muslim,
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:57.000]  meaning that all of the city's elected officials will be Muslim.
[3:47:57.000 --> 3:47:59.000]  Nothing like a bit of diversity, right?
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:01.000]  Which apparently means no white people.
[3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:06.000]  Voters in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights also elected Muslim mayors for the first time,
[3:48:06.000 --> 3:48:10.000]  while the New City Councils will each have three members who are Muslim.
[3:48:10.000 --> 3:48:15.000]  So they're basically almost majority Muslim now too, in terms of their representation.
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:18.000]  No doubt leftists would celebrate the outcome as a victory for diversity,
[3:48:18.000 --> 3:48:21.000]  since that apparently now means no white people.
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:25.000]  But of course, if you talk about this in the suggestion that it may be harmful or negative
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:31.000]  in any way to Native American people, to black people, to white people,
[3:48:31.000 --> 3:48:36.000]  to not have that representation and not to have actual diversity.
[3:48:36.000 --> 3:48:40.000]  As Tucker Colton has done, if you talk about mass migration being used as a weapon
[3:48:40.000 --> 3:48:44.000]  to flood the country with loyalist voting blocks who vote Democrat,
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:49.000]  then of course you're engaging in dangerous, great replacement conspiracy theories,
[3:48:49.000 --> 3:48:55.000]  even as the same people who call you a dangerous conspiracy theorist openly pursue such policies.
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:48:58.000]  Well, they're talking about it in France, as we had with the poll last week,
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:03.000]  where 61% of French people believe that they're being replaced with migrants
[3:49:03.000 --> 3:49:06.000]  from the Middle East and North Africa.
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:09.000]  That's going to be a central issue in the French election,
[3:49:09.000 --> 3:49:13.000]  but in America, you can't even talk about it unless you say it's a good thing
[3:49:13.000 --> 3:49:16.000]  and suddenly can talk about it and it's all rosy and great.
[3:49:16.000 --> 3:49:27.000]  Meanwhile, 39% of 18 to 24 year olds in America now identify as LGBTQ.
[3:49:27.000 --> 3:49:30.000]  This is a poll by Arizona Christen University,
[3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:34.000]  and it found that 39% of them identify as LGBTQ.
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:40.000]  25% of Americans aged 25 to 37 also identified as LGBTQ.
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:46.000]  Do you think that's actually because they're transgender, bisexual, gay or whatever?
[3:49:46.000 --> 3:49:51.000]  Or do you think it's because of mass social and cultural engineering
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:57.000]  teaching them that this is how you display your uniqueness in the world as you're growing up,
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:50:01.000]  even as everybody else does it, so it's not even unique?
[3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:03.000]  Is that the real reason?
[3:50:03.000 --> 3:50:05.000]  Or are they born transgender?
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:13.000]  Are they born gay or 39% of 18 to 24 year olds born gay, bisexual or transgender?
[3:50:13.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  GI wonder?
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:16.000]  Or is it the media?
[3:50:16.000 --> 3:50:17.000]  Is it culture?
[3:50:17.000 --> 3:50:19.000]  Is it Hollywood?
[3:50:19.000 --> 3:50:20.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:23.000]  Of course, we had the previous Gallup poll,
[3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:27.000]  which Glenn Greenwald talked about and was called transphobic for doing so,
[3:50:27.000 --> 3:50:31.000]  which showed that the vast majority of people who claim to be bisexual
[3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:35.000]  are not involved, engaged in bisexual relationships,
[3:50:35.000 --> 3:50:37.000]  they're engaged in straight relationships,
[3:50:37.000 --> 3:50:39.000]  so they're just claiming to be bisexual,
[3:50:39.000 --> 3:50:42.000]  so they can claim that they're LGBT,
[3:50:42.000 --> 3:50:47.000]  so they can get all the special privileges and rights and victim status
[3:50:47.000 --> 3:50:52.000]  that's profit on them once they make that identification.
[3:50:52.000 --> 3:50:54.000]  I'm going to leave it there though because we got this video,
[3:50:54.000 --> 3:50:56.000]  we've got about six and a half minutes left.
[3:50:56.000 --> 3:50:58.000]  It's a long video, 15 minutes.
[3:50:58.000 --> 3:51:00.000]  You can watch the rest of it on summit.news,
[3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:02.000]  but we're going to play out with it.
[3:51:02.000 --> 3:51:08.000]  In terms of LGBTQ and in terms of these identity politics issues,
[3:51:08.000 --> 3:51:11.000]  why are people believing in them?
[3:51:11.000 --> 3:51:12.000]  Why are they embracing them?
[3:51:12.000 --> 3:51:14.000]  Is it a natural organic occurrence?
[3:51:14.000 --> 3:51:17.000]  Or is it because they're being brainwashed into embracing them?
[3:51:17.000 --> 3:51:20.000]  I think this video kind of answers that question,
[3:51:20.000 --> 3:51:22.000]  so we're going to play out the rest of the segment with this.
[3:51:22.000 --> 3:51:25.000]  War Room is coming up after, so be sure to stay tuned for that.
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:30.000]  But here is Social Engineering in TV commercials.
[3:51:34.000 --> 3:51:39.000]  Remember when TV commercials used to inform you about the product being sold?
[3:51:39.000 --> 3:51:41.000]  If you've got wood to stain and you want it to dry quickly,
[3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:43.000]  use one seal quick dry and wood stain.
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:45.000]  It does exactly what it says on the tin.
[3:51:45.000 --> 3:51:47.000]  Yeah, I'm old enough to remember that.
[3:51:47.000 --> 3:51:50.000]  Well now advertisers are getting a little more ambitious.
[3:51:50.000 --> 3:51:52.000]  Why waste time on the product being sold
[3:51:52.000 --> 3:51:55.000]  when the product being sold is you?
[3:51:55.000 --> 3:51:58.000]  Behold our newest ad campaign, Tasty.
[3:51:58.000 --> 3:52:01.000]  You're sure this will help us sell more burgers?
[3:52:01.000 --> 3:52:02.000]  Burgers?
[3:52:02.000 --> 3:52:05.000]  John Lewis recently released an ad for Home Insurance
[3:52:05.000 --> 3:52:09.000]  featuring a young boy wearing a dress, make-up and heels.
[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:19.000]  You're sure this will help us sell more home insurance?
[3:52:19.000 --> 3:52:20.000]  Home insurance?
[3:52:20.000 --> 3:52:22.000]  Within weeks, the ad was cancelled.
[3:52:22.000 --> 3:52:26.000]  Not because of its ethically dubious amplification of drag queen kids,
[3:52:26.000 --> 3:52:29.000]  but because it was deemed potentially misleading.
[3:52:29.000 --> 3:52:33.000]  Because you can't claim home insurance for allowing your kid to trash your home.
[3:52:33.000 --> 3:52:37.000]  Maybe if John Lewis had actually concentrated on the details of their service
[3:52:37.000 --> 3:52:40.000]  rather than their effusive zeal to portray a boy in lipstick,
[3:52:40.000 --> 3:52:42.000]  the ad wouldn't have been banned,
[3:52:42.000 --> 3:52:45.000]  but it's not really about the product anymore, is it?
[3:52:45.000 --> 3:52:48.000]  This year's Halloween ad for Twix Chocolate Bar features
[3:52:48.000 --> 3:52:52.000]  a boy facing discrimination for wearing a princess dress.
[3:52:52.000 --> 3:52:54.000]  The witch nanny then comes to the boy's aid
[3:52:54.000 --> 3:52:57.000]  after he's confronted by a bully.
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:52:59.000]  Hey, you!
[3:52:59.000 --> 3:53:01.000]  Princess!
[3:53:01.000 --> 3:53:03.000]  You look like a girl.
[3:53:03.000 --> 3:53:04.000]  Why are you wearing that?
[3:53:04.000 --> 3:53:08.000]  The witch nanny then conjures up a magic trick to disappear the bully.
[3:53:08.000 --> 3:53:10.000]  So parents leave a kid alone until the new nanny comes.
[3:53:10.000 --> 3:53:13.000]  She forces herself in, then murders a playground boy.
[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:15.000]  Oh, cos he said they look different.
[3:53:15.000 --> 3:53:18.000]  Are you sure this will help us sell more Twix?
[3:53:18.000 --> 3:53:19.000]  Twix?
[3:53:19.000 --> 3:53:21.000]  But hey, who am I to judge?
[3:53:21.000 --> 3:53:25.000]  Why shouldn't young children be exposed to the alphabet experience?
[3:53:25.000 --> 3:53:28.000]  After all, it's such a healthy lifestyle.
[3:53:28.000 --> 3:53:31.000]  When kids aren't being bombarded by gender-bending confusion,
[3:53:31.000 --> 3:53:34.000]  they're being blitzed with pandemic porn.
[3:53:34.000 --> 3:53:36.000]  Last year, the NHS terrified children
[3:53:36.000 --> 3:53:41.000]  by showing Santa being wheeled into the hospital on the verge of dying of Covid.
[3:53:41.000 --> 3:53:46.000]  Heineken, the beer company that proudly supports the total abolition of all borders,
[3:53:46.000 --> 3:53:50.000]  at least remains consistent by insisting that there shouldn't be any borders
[3:53:50.000 --> 3:53:52.000]  when it comes to public toilets.
[3:53:56.000 --> 3:53:59.000]  But only if you've had your shot and displayed your vaccine passport.
[3:54:02.000 --> 3:54:06.000]  In what has to be the most obtuse, left-field and awkward
[3:54:06.000 --> 3:54:10.000]  strong arming of social engineering into a crisp commercial ever seen,
[3:54:10.000 --> 3:54:15.000]  Grandad dies, goes to heaven, and comes back as a gay ghost.
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:44.000]  Are you sure this will help us sell more Doritos?
[3:54:44.000 --> 3:54:45.000]  Doritos?
[3:54:45.000 --> 3:55:11.000]  Look at this charmingly quaint snapshot of suburban British life.
[3:55:16.000 --> 3:55:20.000]  Bear in mind, this is an ad for Bingo, which has an age demographic
[3:55:20.000 --> 3:55:23.000]  not much lower than the Queen of England.
[3:55:23.000 --> 3:55:26.000]  Are you sure this will help us sell more Bingo?
[3:55:26.000 --> 3:55:27.000]  Bingo?
[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:29.000]  Just saw something incredibly rare the other day.
[3:55:29.000 --> 3:55:33.000]  A white heterosexual man in a TV commercial.
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:36.000]  And get this, he wasn't being humiliated.
[3:55:36.000 --> 3:55:37.000]  Incredible, I know.
[3:55:37.000 --> 3:55:38.000]  Barely believable.
[3:55:38.000 --> 3:55:42.000]  I mean, it was Chris Hemsworth, but still, makes a change, doesn't it?
[3:55:42.000 --> 3:55:44.000]  What do they want for Father's Day?
[3:55:44.000 --> 3:55:49.000]  What do they want for the media to stop portraying dads as buffoons?
[3:55:49.000 --> 3:55:50.000]  Doofus dads, right?
[3:55:50.000 --> 3:55:52.000]  I mean, that's all we ever see.
[3:55:52.000 --> 3:55:54.000]  It's just a burst of pipe.
[3:55:54.000 --> 3:55:55.000]  I can fix it.
[3:55:55.000 --> 3:55:57.000]  And my husband is a...
[3:56:00.000 --> 3:56:01.000]  You missed a spot.
[3:56:08.000 --> 3:56:09.000]  Seal.
[3:56:09.000 --> 3:56:14.000]  Shake and let Oven Pride do its thing so he can do more.
[3:56:14.000 --> 3:56:15.000]  Oven Pride.
[3:56:15.000 --> 3:56:17.000]  So easy, a man can do it.
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:18.000]  Okay, maybe it was my fault.
[3:56:18.000 --> 3:56:20.000]  She told me to kill the wheat.
[3:56:20.000 --> 3:56:22.000]  And you did, along with the grass.
[3:56:22.000 --> 3:56:23.000]  I used the wrong stuff.
[3:56:23.000 --> 3:56:25.000]  Oh, there were dead spots everywhere.
[3:56:25.000 --> 3:56:27.000]  Dad's making dinner.
[3:56:27.000 --> 3:56:29.000]  Oh, it'll be fine.
[3:56:29.000 --> 3:56:30.000]  Maybe.
[3:56:30.000 --> 3:56:35.000]  It used to be that TV ads made fun of men for being unable to care for babies,
[3:56:35.000 --> 3:56:38.000]  but that wasn't subversively anti-natal enough.
[3:56:38.000 --> 3:56:41.000]  Now, women can't be shown to be caring for babies
[3:56:41.000 --> 3:56:44.000]  because that would further gender stereotypes.
[3:56:44.000 --> 3:56:49.000]  The UK Advertising Standards Authority banned this Volkswagen commercial
[3:56:49.000 --> 3:57:01.000]  after just three people complained.
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:07.000]  Note how the only stereotypes they refuse to amplify are the ones that are positive and wholesome.
[3:57:07.000 --> 3:57:23.000]  An ad for Apple's iPad Pro encouraged women to erase men altogether.
[3:57:23.000 --> 3:57:28.000]  Another Apple commercial showed cloned white men jumping into the sea like lemmings.
[3:57:28.000 --> 3:57:33.000]  This PC specialist ad was banned in the UK for perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes
[3:57:33.000 --> 3:57:35.000]  because it didn't feature any women.
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:39.000]  Despite PC specialists' core market being 87.5% male,
[3:57:39.000 --> 3:57:44.000]  further and harmful negative stereotypes about men, however, is not only allowed,
[3:57:44.000 --> 3:58:13.000]  it's gleefully encouraged.
[3:58:14.000 --> 3:58:19.000]  In the UK, women can't be shown to be caring for babies,
[3:58:19.000 --> 3:58:29.000]  but women can't be shown to be caring for babies.
[3:58:29.000 --> 3:58:46.000]  In the UK, women can't be shown to be caring for babies.
[3:58:46.000 --> 3:59:01.000]  If a hurricane is smashing into the Gulf Coast and I make the prediction that it's going to cause flooding,
[3:59:01.000 --> 3:59:18.000]  when I said the UN order to lock down the world economy is going to cause supply chain problems for years and starve tens of millions to death.
[3:59:18.000 --> 3:59:32.000]  Listen, when the first world collapses, the third world dies, and now the first world's becoming the third world, so listen to me now.
[3:59:32.000 --> 3:59:36.000]  The prices are going up, we cannot suppress prices anymore.
[3:59:36.000 --> 3:59:43.000]  So protect yourself, get high-quality storeable food, so you're self-sufficient, and fund the InfoWare today at 361 at infowarstore.com.
[3:59:43.000 --> 3:59:47.000]  It's time to get your food.
[3:59:47.000 --> 3:59:56.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
