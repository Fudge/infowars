[00:00.000 --> 00:09.740]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.740 --> 00:11.240]  You want answers?
[00:11.240 --> 00:12.920]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.920 --> 00:33.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33.640 --> 00:39.920]  Hello ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us, it's April 15, 2009.
[00:39.920 --> 00:47.840]  This is the day that tens of millions of Americans go into their post offices and mail a check
[00:47.840 --> 00:52.920]  to the private run-for-profit collection agency for the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve
[00:52.920 --> 01:00.480]  banking scam, and of course, most Americans don't even realize this because withholding
[01:00.480 --> 01:06.720]  was set up by Milton Friedman back in the late 1940s, well, actually started during
[01:06.720 --> 01:07.720]  World War II.
[01:07.720 --> 01:12.120]  They figured out, hey, people aren't paying this new income tax, they're refusing to
[01:12.120 --> 01:13.680]  go along with it.
[01:13.680 --> 01:19.480]  What we'll do is we'll just take it out of their paycheck and make their employers be
[01:19.480 --> 01:26.040]  indentured servants for us, and we won't need to hire any feds to enforce it, we'll just
[01:26.040 --> 01:28.680]  arrest employers if they won't carry the sound.
[01:28.680 --> 01:33.800]  And of course, today they give waivers to the employers, basically ignore it, to where
[01:33.800 --> 01:37.680]  the illegal aliens don't have to pay the taxes, and then there's a waiver in the 700
[01:37.680 --> 01:44.480]  or $27 million stimulus package to where they can give stimulus package money to illegal
[01:44.480 --> 01:45.480]  aliens.
[01:45.480 --> 01:49.000]  It's just all a complete fraud and a joke.
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.520]  So that's what's going on right now.
[01:53.520 --> 02:01.240]  We have the private bankers not content to control this nation, to use this nation as
[02:01.240 --> 02:08.440]  their military arm, the United States, more than half the world's defense expenditures
[02:08.440 --> 02:14.520]  to enforce for the global cartel, known as the New World War, but they're not content
[02:14.520 --> 02:15.520]  with that.
[02:15.520 --> 02:19.040]  Now they want to go ahead and just butcher the nation financially completely, reduce
[02:19.040 --> 02:27.520]  it down to nothing so they can consolidate their power to an even greater level.
[02:27.520 --> 02:31.800]  Now we're going to do something different today, a note to stations out there.
[02:31.800 --> 02:37.280]  Tom Hartman is a syndicated radio host on many, quote, progressive and liberal stations
[02:37.280 --> 02:44.920]  around the country, and on the remnant of what is George Soros' Air America.
[02:44.920 --> 02:47.920]  And we're going to be simulcasting with him for an hour today.
[02:47.920 --> 02:52.560]  In fact, they wanted to do an hour, and then somehow somebody decided we'd only do 30 minutes
[02:52.560 --> 02:53.560]  with them.
[02:53.560 --> 02:56.960]  I want to be sure and make sure that directive I gave that I do want to go ahead and do the
[02:56.960 --> 03:01.840]  full hour with them if it's not too late today, so they think we're doing that if we called
[03:01.840 --> 03:02.840]  and confirmed that.
[03:02.840 --> 03:05.760]  Because last I checked, we told them no, we're only doing 30 minutes.
[03:05.760 --> 03:08.120]  Okay, so we're doing an hour with them.
[03:08.120 --> 03:13.360]  A note to stations, can I have that clock as soon as possible so I can tell stations
[03:13.360 --> 03:17.240]  on there about it?
[03:17.240 --> 03:21.720]  Local breaks, breaks that are belong to the local stations, those will be at the regular
[03:21.720 --> 03:34.880]  times, but the 5 after to 8 after, the 30 after to the 33 after, but they go to 35, she'll
[03:34.880 --> 03:37.920]  have an extra two minutes, enjoy yourselves.
[03:37.920 --> 03:41.120]  But the two floating network breaks, those are going to move, we're going to just kind
[03:41.120 --> 03:44.880]  of conform to Hartman's breaks.
[03:44.880 --> 03:48.200]  I just wanted to confirm because I forgot to ask you before, airtime, they'd want to
[03:48.200 --> 03:50.640]  do a full hour, and for some reason we told them we could only do 30, we're doing a full
[03:50.640 --> 03:51.840]  hour, right?
[03:51.840 --> 03:58.480]  Okay, great, and then you guys are going down to the Tea Party that's been hijacked by Glenn
[03:58.480 --> 04:02.440]  Beck, down in San Antonio, I suppose there'll be thousands, so we'll get a report from you
[04:02.440 --> 04:03.760]  at the end of the show.
[04:03.760 --> 04:05.800]  Thank you so much, sir.
[04:05.800 --> 04:13.400]  We're deploying some of the crew down there, Jason Bermas is going, Rob Dube, Aaron Dykes,
[04:13.400 --> 04:18.800]  and Rob Jacobson, and we're just going down there to show the grassroots people standing
[04:18.800 --> 04:20.880]  up to tyranny.
[04:20.880 --> 04:27.320]  And we're going to hand out some of the full reports, 50-something pages, they've printed
[04:27.320 --> 04:32.840]  up a whole bunch of them, looks like a print shop back there of civilian and made labor
[04:32.840 --> 04:39.560]  camp program, the already operating system of having U.S. citizens in camps.
[04:39.560 --> 04:47.280]  Walter Reddy, committees for safety.org, he's haunt showing the promise to not confiscate
[04:47.280 --> 04:54.320]  the guns, the oath keepers, that's coming up this weekend in Lexington, in Massachusetts.
[04:54.320 --> 05:01.000]  Big show today, kind of important news, tell you about it when we get back, stay with us.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.760]  Did you know that the new energy czar wants to control how much power your electrical
[05:05.760 --> 05:07.800]  company allows you to have?
[05:07.800 --> 05:14.440]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming,
[05:14.440 --> 05:15.920]  not if, but when.
[05:15.920 --> 05:20.680]  Hi Bill, I just wanted to call in and let you folks know that I got my solar backup generator
[05:20.680 --> 05:25.520]  hooked up and running, to tell you the truth, it's awesome, not only was it easy to install,
[05:25.520 --> 05:30.440]  but it's powering my fridge, lights, TV, and shortwave radio, I now know that I'm one
[05:30.440 --> 05:33.720]  step closer to getting off the grid, thanks for all your help.
[05:33.720 --> 05:38.320]  This generator is solar powered, complete with battery backup, has no moving parts to
[05:38.320 --> 05:43.440]  wear out or break, and requires no gas, don't wait for the energy czar to cut your power
[05:43.440 --> 05:49.960]  or raise your rates, produce your own electricity for free, go to mysolarbackup.com, that's
[05:49.960 --> 06:01.040]  mysolarbackup.com, or call 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[06:01.040 --> 06:07.160]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[06:07.160 --> 06:11.640]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[06:11.640 --> 06:12.960]  us would like to see.
[06:12.960 --> 06:18.120]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[06:18.120 --> 06:19.120]  of the American people.
[06:19.120 --> 06:23.880]  Well, Obama's already fudging, fudged since D1 in this election.
[06:23.880 --> 06:29.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[06:29.000 --> 06:37.120]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[06:37.120 --> 06:40.680]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[06:40.680 --> 06:47.600]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[06:47.600 --> 06:53.080]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in super
[06:53.080 --> 07:00.400]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv, the Obama deception, the people strike back.
[07:00.400 --> 07:05.040]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[07:05.040 --> 07:09.920]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[07:09.920 --> 07:11.520]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[07:11.520 --> 07:15.160]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[08:00.400 --> 08:06.300]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network probably presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[08:06.300 --> 08:08.080]  a war on for your mind.
[08:37.880 --> 08:46.440]  Well a lot of you out there, a lot of you out there are upset today, those of you that
[08:46.440 --> 08:53.680]  actually own your own businesses, as you mail probably 45-50% of what you earn because they've
[08:53.680 --> 08:58.880]  gotten rid of most of the exemptions, the way the turbo tax works, the way the CPAs
[08:58.880 --> 08:59.880]  operate.
[08:59.880 --> 09:04.380]  In the last couple years they passed federal laws where the CPAs are entirely indentured
[09:04.380 --> 09:08.040]  servants of the federal government that are there to actually make sure you don't get
[09:08.040 --> 09:09.040]  all the exemptions.
[09:09.040 --> 09:13.640]  So a lot of people are paying 50-60% in taxes, just the feds.
[09:13.640 --> 09:19.400]  It's not really a 35 or 40% tax bracket like they say, and if you think things are bad
[09:19.400 --> 09:26.720]  now in this economy, wait till next year when Barack Obama's massive tax increases,
[09:26.720 --> 09:32.640]  anybody making over $125,000 a piece, he played that accounting trick and said, well if you're
[09:32.640 --> 09:37.560]  making a quarter million dollars a year you're going to have a tax increase, but really that's
[09:37.560 --> 09:46.000]  people making over 125,000 and they're getting rid of the property tax exemption, they're
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.880]  getting rid of a bunch of other exemptions, so get ready, get ready because the private
[09:51.880 --> 09:59.160]  international banks that rule our planet and are openly setting up world government publicly
[09:59.160 --> 10:02.840]  are saying they want global tax rates raised and that's the whole point of the new world
[10:02.840 --> 10:09.080]  order is so that they, through IMF and World Bank loans, can get control of nations but
[10:09.080 --> 10:15.720]  also so they can tax the wealthy nations to fund their operation and then they go in with
[10:15.720 --> 10:19.680]  global regulators and in a third world country or the United States where anybody else doesn't
[10:19.680 --> 10:25.120]  follow orders, huge sanctions and trade blockades are put on them and if that doesn't work revolutions
[10:25.120 --> 10:29.440]  are financed inside the country to overthrow the nation and hand it over to the bankers
[10:29.440 --> 10:33.400]  and if that doesn't work they'll claim you got WMD's and come in and attack you like
[10:33.400 --> 10:39.120]  Serbia or Iraq or if you got opium they want, they'll stage terror attacks on their own
[10:39.120 --> 10:47.400]  countries and then claim that cavemen did it and take over Afghanistan to get the opium.
[10:47.400 --> 10:53.320]  So as bad as a lot of people think this is, this is nothing compared to the cashless society
[10:53.320 --> 11:00.600]  enslavement system that the Pentagon has designed openly and it's the body scanning systems
[11:00.600 --> 11:04.680]  at the airports and it's the face scanning cameras on street corners and it's your digital
[11:04.680 --> 11:10.240]  photo and your driver's license for the national and world ID agreements they've signed, your
[11:10.240 --> 11:17.120]  local driver's license is a world ID, that's public and they're just integrating a surveillance
[11:17.120 --> 11:23.920]  system and they're having fake conservative groups pushing national sales tax, a consumption
[11:23.920 --> 11:30.320]  tax and they're saying oh don't worry it'll be graduated if you're under $20,000 a year
[11:30.320 --> 11:35.520]  or $15,000 a year depending on the plans, you'll pay no tax but you've got to swipe
[11:35.520 --> 11:40.120]  your ID card at the time of purchase to make sure you're really in that bracket and then
[11:40.120 --> 11:44.800]  it marks up what you buy, where you buy it, how much money you spent to quote stop a black
[11:44.800 --> 11:51.920]  market and oh this shows you bought $30,000 worth of stuff but you claim you're in a $25,000
[11:51.920 --> 11:55.320]  sales tax bracket and then they're going to say they're getting rid of the income tax,
[11:55.320 --> 12:00.440]  they're going to rename it, I discovered this 12 years ago, they had big foundations
[12:00.440 --> 12:05.120]  funding it, that's why they have fake neocons on radio push it and then they're going to
[12:05.120 --> 12:10.320]  call it the social security tax and they're going to say oh everybody pays a flat social
[12:10.320 --> 12:17.680]  security tax of 10 or 12%. So no more confusing IRS, it's going to be great but you're going
[12:17.680 --> 12:21.880]  to have this sales tax and it's going to be a world sales tax, it's being introduced
[12:21.880 --> 12:26.480]  as a national sales tax but it's standardized everywhere and then they'll be added taxes
[12:26.480 --> 12:31.720]  if what you're buying isn't green friendly or if it has a big carbon footprint. This
[12:31.720 --> 12:42.560]  is all being introduced right now, advertised as conservative of course and so you think
[12:42.560 --> 12:49.720]  it's bad now, you haven't seen anything and as they bankrupt the entire world economy
[12:49.720 --> 12:54.120]  most people are now going to be on government jobs, that is even if you work for private
[12:54.120 --> 12:59.240]  corporation it's going to have government contracts and so you'll have to swipe that
[12:59.240 --> 13:03.320]  national ID card every day to clock in and clock out, that's all being proposed by Homeland
[13:03.320 --> 13:09.320]  Security and being standardized and being set up as well right now. Every internet company
[13:09.320 --> 13:14.360]  including small server companies will have NSA hubs in them, that's all publicly been
[13:14.360 --> 13:18.440]  announced, the head of cybersecurity a month ago resigned saying it was a total Pentagon
[13:18.440 --> 13:24.160]  takeover of every major internet or telecommunications business, it's an expansion of the Telecommunications
[13:24.160 --> 13:32.440]  Act of 96 that took over all the phone companies, so NSA has entire floors and all those facilities
[13:32.440 --> 13:39.200]  and so this grid of control where all your cars are to have satellite tracking by the
[13:39.200 --> 13:44.040]  mile and taxi, all cell phone already track you and control you and watch what you're
[13:44.040 --> 13:47.840]  doing and they can dial in through the emergency management centers regionally, they're even
[13:47.840 --> 13:52.480]  giving local cops this power now to dial in and listen to you physically on your cell
[13:52.480 --> 13:58.880]  phone audibly and also track everywhere you are down to three feet and this is all going
[13:58.880 --> 14:03.640]  to be a tax grid, New York's taxing 20% of your phone bill is tax, other states are
[14:03.640 --> 14:07.920]  now adopting, every state will implement at the state level but federally controlled
[14:07.920 --> 14:12.440]  and standardized they will tax you through that, that's openly being announced, I told
[14:12.440 --> 14:18.520]  you about it 10 years ago in federal documents, now it's mainstream news and it goes on and
[14:18.520 --> 14:27.360]  on and on and if you go out and protest it, some national syndicated radio shows, the
[14:27.360 --> 14:34.080]  Associated Press, Fox News, Washington Times, they all called Homeland Security, these stories
[14:34.080 --> 14:38.280]  are all up on infowars.com, prisonpunna.com, if you want to read them, I have time later
[14:38.280 --> 14:46.280]  I'm going to play some of the clubs when our guest is on the show where this Walter Reddy
[14:46.280 --> 14:53.280]  was involved with some of the Tea Parties and other things but it's just incredible
[14:53.280 --> 15:06.120]  the level of tyranny, it staggers the mind, it staggers me, dumbfounded anyways, they
[15:06.120 --> 15:09.840]  got Homeland Security on the radio and they got Homeland Security in the newspapers and
[15:09.840 --> 15:16.960]  they said, yeah basically we are spying on the Tea Parties and we're spying on liberal
[15:16.960 --> 15:22.000]  groups, anybody, churches that say they're going to have community sub-kitchens are spying
[15:22.000 --> 15:28.040]  on, that's been admitted, I mean, look, you don't do anything but watch television on
[15:28.040 --> 15:31.800]  your digital cable box, it's tracking everything you do, everything you watch, that goes right
[15:31.800 --> 15:37.280]  back to the feds immediately, so even if you're doing that, you're being watched, listen,
[15:37.280 --> 15:44.800]  if all you do is go to baseball games and football games and take Prozac and drink lots
[15:44.800 --> 15:54.520]  of fluoride water and pay all your taxes, you're being watched, okay, because they're
[15:54.520 --> 15:58.840]  gauging how to control you and how to get you to accept more tyranny and control and
[15:58.840 --> 16:04.280]  the UN, the club of Rome, the CFR, the Ministry of Defense in England, the Pentagon in the
[16:04.280 --> 16:10.640]  U.S., it's all on record in public stated documents, biological diversity assessments,
[16:10.640 --> 16:16.440]  Pentagon reports, we've published them all, republished and posted them, their goal is
[16:16.440 --> 16:20.400]  to get a total control grid in where you all live like prisoners and then they're going
[16:20.400 --> 16:27.400]  to kill us, now I'm sorry to have to report that to you but the best place that was ever
[16:27.400 --> 16:35.880]  laid out was Bill Joy, owner of Sun Microsystems in 1999, April issue, Why the Future Doesn't
[16:35.880 --> 16:40.920]  Need Us, Wired Magazine and he says, look, I went to a big top IT meeting of 200 top
[16:40.920 --> 16:46.200]  IT owners and scientists, Kurzweil was there, they were all there and he said they openly
[16:46.200 --> 16:53.560]  discussed how the public is going to be eliminated, now I mean I'm sorry that's scary and I don't
[16:53.560 --> 16:57.800]  blame you for wanting to live in denial and say, man this Alex guy is whacked out, no
[16:57.800 --> 17:03.040]  I'm not the whacked out one saying this, my film in game covers it, that's the big dirty
[17:03.040 --> 17:11.600]  secret and it isn't a secret, so I'm going to tell you, police, military, all of you,
[17:11.600 --> 17:16.240]  they already take the military every week and give the troops shots and they die and
[17:16.240 --> 17:21.400]  the military just says, oh they died of the flu, the ongoing chemical biological testing
[17:21.400 --> 17:27.800]  is ongoing and the police know this, it's why they refused, in mass, to a man almost,
[17:27.800 --> 17:34.200]  the LA Times reported 99.9%, they ordered 14 million first responders, nurses, doctors,
[17:34.200 --> 17:39.240]  city workers, county workers, police, firemen, on and on and on to take the smallpox shot
[17:39.240 --> 17:45.080]  in 2003 and 4,000 took it and a bunch of them died and that was in mainstream news, now
[17:45.080 --> 17:49.400]  the human services head wouldn't take it, so you know deep down I'm telling you the
[17:49.400 --> 18:00.680]  truth, so I'm sorry reality's scary, but an incremental slave grid is going into place
[18:00.680 --> 18:06.000]  and we're all deader than a hammer, if we continue to let them put the next phase in,
[18:06.000 --> 18:14.000]  the next phase after that, we are two phases away from drone aircraft flying over every
[18:14.000 --> 18:22.100]  U.S. city and nerve gas in every last one of us and they'll be on the news saying stand
[18:22.100 --> 18:26.000]  doors, put tape on your doors, put plastic up, they're already training you how to sit
[18:26.000 --> 18:32.720]  there and die, the government's trying to help you and then fires are going to break
[18:32.720 --> 18:37.720]  out, the cities are going to burn and look I'm not just saying this, I know the enemy's
[18:37.720 --> 18:46.560]  mind okay, and so you can sit there, you can attack me all day because I know the ball
[18:46.560 --> 18:52.440]  games are alluring, I know the topless bars are alluring, I know the sewing circles are
[18:52.440 --> 18:58.280]  alluring for women out there, you know the modern sewing circles going out to bars together
[18:58.280 --> 19:03.920]  getting your toenails painted, running around having fun, but because you've been running
[19:03.920 --> 19:08.800]  around having fun deciding 50 million dead babies was no big deal and deciding a million
[19:08.800 --> 19:13.040]  300,000 dead Iraqis was no big deal, you were all offered your own brand of evil and you
[19:13.040 --> 19:21.000]  bought into it and I'm going to tell you right now, I don't want to be vindicated when they
[19:21.000 --> 19:27.400]  have their control bio weapons releases, when they have those and it kills a few hundred
[19:27.400 --> 19:32.440]  thousand and then a few million and then a few years later, a hundred million, the public
[19:32.440 --> 19:36.200]  is going to most of them are going to grovel and bag and do whatever they're told, being
[19:36.200 --> 19:39.960]  promised they'll be safe, they'll line up and take every experimental shot and people
[19:39.960 --> 19:44.720]  will die in mass and the media will practice the process of putting it out there that people
[19:44.720 --> 19:51.280]  are dying like it's no big deal, like they're doing with MMR and HPV and all the other shots
[19:51.280 --> 19:57.560]  killing people that are in the hammer, this is all being tested and war gained, I'll cover
[19:57.560 --> 20:04.880]  big news and we'll get back, stay with us, the new world order beast is genetically modifying

[23:04.880 --> 23:09.040]  and food shortages, how to be prepared while preserving your sanity, your answer may be

[23:13.840 --> 23:18.280]  that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green
[23:18.280 --> 23:22.720]  earth, perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[23:22.720 --> 23:27.360]  The cost of learning is minimal, wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere,
[23:27.360 --> 23:30.880]  it's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[23:30.880 --> 23:35.000]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flash

[24:05.520 --> 24:09.240]  Every time I'm laying down to go to sleep at night, I wake up in the morning, I'm in
[24:09.240 --> 24:16.960]  the shower, I'm jogging, I'm holding one of my children in all my knee and I just think
[24:16.960 --> 24:19.920]  about the listeners out there and how great you are and how you've spread the word and
[24:19.920 --> 24:26.040]  all the good you've done and the amount of change we have affected for good, for transparency,
[24:26.040 --> 24:27.040]  for truth.
[24:27.040 --> 24:32.400]  But then I think about all the people that laugh and giggle, who think I'm making this
[24:32.400 --> 24:33.400]  stuff up.
[24:33.400 --> 24:36.280]  Folks, I'm not making this stuff up.
[24:36.280 --> 24:41.200]  A lot of people think I enjoy my success reaching millions of people.
[24:41.200 --> 24:50.880]  How do you enjoy having success doing a very dangerous job that's a dirty business?
[24:50.880 --> 24:57.440]  I mean, I do have the happiness and the enjoyment and the satisfaction of being somewhat effective,
[24:57.440 --> 25:02.360]  but frankly, things are so desperate that most of the time I am just burning with anger
[25:02.360 --> 25:10.520]  at myself that I can't even articulate the full picture, the full horror of what I know
[25:10.520 --> 25:11.520]  and the level of denial.
[25:11.520 --> 25:14.040]  I mean, how many things have we been right about?
[25:14.040 --> 25:16.800]  This weekend was on a few little message boards.
[25:16.800 --> 25:21.200]  We put it up on infowars.com, it's where it major league breaks.
[25:21.200 --> 25:26.320]  In the last two, three days, it becomes national news on Fox, CNN, you know, gun owners are
[25:26.320 --> 25:29.960]  number one terror threat to government and that's what the document says and I'm glad
[25:29.960 --> 25:35.360]  a lot of mainstream news articles have gotten the headline right because that's what it
[25:35.360 --> 25:37.440]  is.
[25:37.440 --> 25:42.160]  And there's still people on infowars.com, the original story written Sunday by Kurt
[25:42.160 --> 25:50.560]  Nemo and myself and they're in there right now denying it's real.
[25:50.560 --> 25:52.720]  Now those have got to be operatives.
[25:52.720 --> 25:56.760]  Three days after it's admitted to be real and Homeland Security's in the news saying
[25:56.760 --> 26:04.520]  it's their document, I called Homeland Security and they admitted it was theirs and there's
[26:04.520 --> 26:07.120]  people in there saying I'm a liar.
[26:07.120 --> 26:16.520]  That can't be Dumbo's or maybe it can, I just, I go on radio shows as a guest so they laugh
[26:16.520 --> 26:21.920]  at me and say there's no new world order even when they're openly announcing it on the news
[26:21.920 --> 26:24.680]  or they say, oh yeah, there's a new world order but that just means a change in global
[26:24.680 --> 26:25.680]  policies.
[26:25.680 --> 26:28.440]  Now the globalists have written hundreds of books and policy papers.
[26:28.440 --> 26:32.000]  They say a new world order means a bank of the world owned by private banks that controls
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.640]  currencies and taxes and interest rates and has an army and a court and our Supreme Court
[26:37.640 --> 26:40.440]  saying they follow the orders of the Hague now.
[26:40.440 --> 26:46.240]  That's USA Today bragging, they were saying isn't it good we follow the UN's orders now.
[26:46.240 --> 26:49.240]  This is happening.
[26:49.240 --> 26:51.560]  George Bush signed back on to UNESCO.
[26:51.560 --> 26:53.640]  You know what that means under the UN?
[26:53.640 --> 26:58.040]  All those treaty agreements that everything in our schools and colleges be designed by
[26:58.040 --> 27:03.160]  the UN and government and private corporations and the sensitivity training, the brainwashing
[27:03.160 --> 27:07.240]  to turn everybody against each other in the name of unity.
[27:07.240 --> 27:10.840]  They're making fifth graders in the US and England and Australia and Germany.
[27:10.840 --> 27:11.840]  It's all the same.
[27:11.840 --> 27:12.840]  It's global.
[27:12.840 --> 27:17.840]  Taddle on their parents and learn about homosexual sex.
[27:17.840 --> 27:20.040]  They should be learning about heterosexual or homosexual.
[27:20.040 --> 27:24.480]  They're innocent but in the name of teaching them about anti-suicide, suicide goes way
[27:24.480 --> 27:28.280]  up because they teach fourth graders how to hang themselves.
[27:28.280 --> 27:29.280]  Don't do this.
[27:29.280 --> 27:33.800]  Don't tie a tourniquet around your neck and tie it on to something high and jump off a
[27:33.800 --> 27:34.800]  chair.
[27:34.800 --> 27:38.440]  And then suddenly you got third graders having sex with each other.
[27:38.440 --> 27:42.400]  Suddenly you got fourth graders hanging themselves.
[27:42.400 --> 27:47.040]  The globalists know that actually causes them to have sex, causes them to commit suicide
[27:47.040 --> 27:51.040]  when you teach them about it.
[27:51.040 --> 27:54.520]  They're sick freaks, folks.
[27:54.520 --> 27:57.520]  I've got all these CPS documents and even mainstream reports.
[27:57.520 --> 28:01.160]  I can't believe they even admit it but it continues how they're paid federal bounties
[28:01.160 --> 28:03.040]  on every child they kidnap.
[28:03.040 --> 28:04.360]  That tears my guts out.
[28:04.360 --> 28:11.000]  That freaks me out.
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.520]  And so, you know, I got to be cool when I'm at home.
[28:13.520 --> 28:14.520]  I got to relax.
[28:14.520 --> 28:20.540]  I got to somehow try to get my mind off this a few hours a day and if there is some beautiful
[28:20.540 --> 28:27.120]  blue sky turning into evening and I see stars winking into view and the moon and little
[28:27.120 --> 28:31.760]  swallows nesting in the eaves of our house with their little gold bellies and beautiful
[28:31.760 --> 28:33.440]  blue feathers.
[28:33.440 --> 28:36.040]  And I just start thinking, oh, I want to go camping by a river.
[28:36.040 --> 28:37.680]  I want to go spend two weeks.
[28:37.680 --> 28:39.840]  I want to go do, you know, plant a garden.
[28:39.840 --> 28:42.760]  I want to walk around with my feet in the mud.
[28:42.760 --> 28:44.840]  I want to go to the beach.
[28:44.840 --> 28:50.440]  I want to forget about all this but I can't because I know it's real.
[28:50.440 --> 28:56.040]  Even if I go to the beach or I go camping, I would really love to take a cruise from
[28:56.040 --> 29:00.920]  New York City to England and back again, you know, things like that.
[29:00.920 --> 29:02.840]  I'll never get to do that.
[29:02.840 --> 29:08.160]  I'll never get to go to a baseball game and get some popcorn and a hot dog because I can't
[29:08.160 --> 29:13.640]  because I know that half the corn syrup products have high levels of mercury in them by design,
[29:13.640 --> 29:14.640]  Washington Post.
[29:14.640 --> 29:16.400]  I can't even sit there and drink a Coke.
[29:16.400 --> 29:17.560]  I can't eat a hot dog.
[29:17.560 --> 29:21.400]  I know it's got a bunch of prions in it.
[29:21.400 --> 29:26.880]  I know that tyranny's coming down on me a hundred miles an hour so I can't live in denial.
[29:26.880 --> 29:29.320]  I know why a lot of you want to live in denial.
[29:29.320 --> 29:38.200]  I know why a lot of you want to just ignore what's happening because you want to have
[29:38.200 --> 29:39.200]  a life.
[29:39.200 --> 29:43.280]  But I'm telling you, if you don't stand up now, we're going to lose everything.
[29:43.280 --> 29:47.800]  I'm going to come back, get the bird flu news, the economy news, the tea party news, the
[29:47.800 --> 29:51.360]  taxing news, and a lot more.
[29:51.360 --> 29:52.640]  We're on the march.
[29:52.640 --> 29:55.040]  The empire's on the run.
[29:55.040 --> 30:01.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.000 --> 30:04.440]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[30:04.440 --> 30:08.280]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the
[30:08.280 --> 30:09.280]  world.
[30:09.280 --> 30:14.840]  It's home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver who offers colloidal
[30:14.840 --> 30:19.560]  products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline
[30:19.560 --> 30:20.560]  solutions.
[30:20.560 --> 30:25.080]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized
[30:25.080 --> 30:29.760]  at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day
[30:29.760 --> 30:31.080]  antibiotics.
[30:31.080 --> 30:35.960]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver, gold, and copper
[30:35.960 --> 30:39.320]  with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[30:39.320 --> 30:43.600]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that
[30:43.600 --> 30:47.440]  would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[31:01.360 --> 31:07.440]  On the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[31:07.440 --> 31:11.960]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[31:11.960 --> 31:13.280]  us would like to see.
[31:13.280 --> 31:18.440]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[31:18.440 --> 31:19.840]  of the American people.
[31:19.840 --> 31:24.200]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[31:24.200 --> 31:29.320]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[31:29.320 --> 31:37.400]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[31:37.400 --> 31:40.960]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[31:40.960 --> 31:47.880]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[33:19.760 --> 33:39.440]  Welcome my friends, thank you for joining us.
[33:39.440 --> 33:46.520]  As we wage war on corruption as we crash into the lives of this information, Monday through
[33:46.520 --> 33:54.360]  Friday 11 a.m. at 3 p.m., right here on the GCN Radio Network, infowars.com, prismplanet.com.
[33:54.360 --> 34:02.280]  Okay, let me just run through some of the news headlines here.
[34:02.280 --> 34:06.720]  I just want people out there to understand that if you'll just investigate the claims
[34:06.720 --> 34:13.200]  we're making, no matter how insane they sound, it's true.
[34:13.200 --> 34:19.080]  Okay, here is some of the news I have.
[34:19.080 --> 34:25.320]  We are watching the bird flu situation very, very closely, and there is no doubt that bird
[34:25.320 --> 34:32.800]  flu is a weaponized, zoological bio weapon produced by Western intelligence, and even
[34:32.800 --> 34:36.880]  mainstream news in China has come out without analysis.
[34:36.880 --> 34:40.800]  Major medical institutions have looked at it and say it looks like it's been engineered.
[34:40.800 --> 34:46.320]  We know the Pentagon a decade ago went to the North Pole areas, Arctic areas, and dug
[34:46.320 --> 34:54.240]  up dead whalers and permafrost that had died of the Spanish flu, 1918 itself a bio weapon
[34:54.240 --> 35:00.400]  and started out on U.S. military bases, and I've gone back and gotten the old newsreels.
[35:00.400 --> 35:03.200]  That had been a manipulated bio weapon.
[35:03.200 --> 35:05.480]  Of course, the government still had it.
[35:05.480 --> 35:09.200]  They're just acting like they've resurrected it out of the permafrost.
[35:09.200 --> 35:16.200]  If you read the U.N. documents and other ones, they talk about using a worldwide super flu
[35:16.200 --> 35:18.640]  to wipe out the population.
[35:18.640 --> 35:23.400]  An airborne Ebola would kill 90% of those that came in contact, and airborne bird flu
[35:23.400 --> 35:29.080]  would kill roughly 90% of those that came in contact with it, and then we confirmed
[35:29.080 --> 35:36.160]  a month and a half ago that Baxter Pharmaceutical also involved in shipping live HIV and hepatitis
[35:36.160 --> 35:40.920]  in vaccines around the world, that's mainstream news, New York Times.
[35:40.920 --> 35:44.360]  Just Google Baxter HIV and you'll get New York Times.
[35:44.360 --> 35:49.720]  Again, they just put this out in plain view like it's no big deal.
[35:49.720 --> 35:55.240]  You'll find New York Times articles from 1999 as the first one, but it's the same companies,
[35:55.240 --> 36:02.120]  Baxter, Bayer, a few others over and over again, and they ship it out to 18 countries.
[36:02.120 --> 36:09.480]  They order it mixed in with regular flu vaccine, live flu.
[36:09.480 --> 36:16.120]  It's mixed up in big batches, and at one sub-lab in the Czech Republic, they test the flu vaccine
[36:16.120 --> 36:23.160]  because if it makes a ferret sick, then they didn't radiate it properly.
[36:23.160 --> 36:26.320]  Well, this has been un-radiated.
[36:26.320 --> 36:29.440]  They gave it to ferrets, and this has been in Bloomberg, you name it, they gave it to
[36:29.440 --> 36:33.400]  ferrets, and the ferrets died.
[36:33.400 --> 36:37.020]  And they said, whoa, we better test this, and they went, oh my gosh, the most deadly
[36:37.020 --> 36:43.800]  strain of bird flu that kills 90% of humans that get it has been mixed in with this, and
[36:43.800 --> 36:46.720]  it had been mixed in in 18 countries in multiple labs.
[36:46.720 --> 36:54.200]  Now, this is happening simultaneously, and I've got the London Telegraph AP Reuters,
[36:54.200 --> 36:57.240]  literally hundreds of mainstream news articles.
[36:57.240 --> 37:01.680]  You can Google, health workers arrested, health workers tried, homeless died from bird flu
[37:01.680 --> 37:02.680]  shot.
[37:02.680 --> 37:05.240]  You can read all the articles.
[37:05.240 --> 37:13.120]  For those that want to look at what we're talking about, and they state that the health
[37:13.120 --> 37:18.720]  workers were paid by unnamed pharmaceutical companies, and that they gave the homeless
[37:18.720 --> 37:24.240]  the shots, and at one homeless facility, 220 something were given, and 21 died, the others
[37:24.240 --> 37:26.800]  almost died.
[37:26.800 --> 37:32.280]  And that's, remember, the government whitewashing, now that's one homeless shelter.
[37:32.280 --> 37:39.800]  Now ladies and gentlemen, the news studiously will not say what company, why haven't the
[37:39.800 --> 37:41.800]  companies been indicted?
[37:41.800 --> 37:45.960]  Why are they just arresting the health workers who were on record saying, look, we were lied
[37:45.960 --> 37:50.680]  to by a big pharma, and told this was an experiment, but that it wasn't lethal and give it to the
[37:50.680 --> 37:51.680]  homeless.
[37:51.680 --> 37:54.080]  Now that's in the news articles.
[37:54.080 --> 38:01.320]  Now, we suddenly got bird flu popping up in Africa, popping up in the Philippines, popping
[38:01.320 --> 38:13.040]  up in Egypt, but also in central areas of Africa, not just up there in the northeast.
[38:13.040 --> 38:14.640]  We got all sorts of stuff going on.
[38:14.640 --> 38:19.080]  We got bird flu popping up all over the United States and Canada.
[38:19.080 --> 38:24.680]  Now, serious situation, this didn't just show up over here.
[38:24.680 --> 38:30.440]  Now, everybody's running around hyperventilating, we're about day five, into all the hyperventilating
[38:30.440 --> 38:35.600]  over an internet clip of a caller to a radio show, with no evidence claiming that truck
[38:35.600 --> 38:39.440]  drivers are going down missile silos with missiles loaded with bird flu, but then they
[38:39.440 --> 38:43.760]  don't know it's bird flu, then it's shipped around all this other malarkey, because you
[38:43.760 --> 38:47.560]  can listen to it and tell it's not how the feds operate, I know their MO.
[38:47.560 --> 38:51.320]  I read that federal document this weekend and I said, this is real, and Kurt said, are
[38:51.320 --> 38:52.320]  you sure?
[38:52.320 --> 38:53.320]  Nobody's confirmed it.
[38:53.320 --> 38:57.600]  And I said, I'll call Homeland Security and they admitted it was theirs.
[38:57.600 --> 39:01.240]  And then now the AP and everybody else is called and it's confirmed it's theirs.
[39:01.240 --> 39:02.480]  It's a real federal document.
[39:02.480 --> 39:11.560]  Look, when you do this 18 hours a day, you start getting very, very accurate, very cunning
[39:11.560 --> 39:17.440]  when it comes to knowing what's fake and what isn't, what's real, what's bonafide.
[39:17.440 --> 39:23.440]  And I'm telling you, it's in the cards for these murderers to release bird flu.
[39:23.440 --> 39:29.360]  And I'm sorry that I haven't done a good enough job to stop them.
[39:29.360 --> 39:34.320]  I'm sorry that you were weak-minded.
[39:34.320 --> 39:38.920]  A lot of you out there, I mean, there's a lot of people out there on government payroll,
[39:38.920 --> 39:40.680]  it's their job to attack us.
[39:40.680 --> 39:42.960]  And when you're sitting there with your family down around you and you're sitting there
[39:42.960 --> 39:46.520]  dying, at least get your heart right with God before you die.
[39:46.520 --> 39:47.520]  That's all I can say to you.
[39:47.520 --> 39:51.640]  I mean, at least, because I don't even hate you, I just feel sorry for you.
[39:51.640 --> 39:57.400]  Let me tell you the exact type of people that are going to die under this new world order.
[39:57.400 --> 40:02.040]  It's the type of people that call up death threat in my wife, type of people that call
[40:02.040 --> 40:05.320]  up serving evil.
[40:05.320 --> 40:07.080]  God help you.
[40:07.080 --> 40:10.760]  God help your soul.
[40:10.760 --> 40:17.760]  Now, I'm telling you what's in the cards, and it's kind of like Russian roulette where
[40:17.760 --> 40:25.280]  they got a bullet in all six of the chambers, and they're spinning the chamber, they're
[40:25.280 --> 40:38.360]  spinning them, the cylinder, and they're handing us the gun.
[40:38.360 --> 40:44.080]  In fact, they're not handing us the gun.
[40:44.080 --> 40:50.920]  They are putting the gun to our head.
[40:50.920 --> 40:54.080]  I know it's a gun, I know it's in the six chambers.
[40:54.080 --> 40:56.560]  I don't know what they're going to fire into our head.
[40:56.560 --> 41:00.000]  I don't know if they're going to fire one shots, two shots, three shots, four shots,
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.320]  all six of the shots.
[41:01.320 --> 41:06.480]  The way you stop each one of the bullets, the cartridges from being ignited, is you
[41:06.480 --> 41:08.520]  expose each agenda.
[41:08.520 --> 41:12.920]  They've already pulled the trigger on bringing in a world of depression, and then their solution
[41:12.920 --> 41:20.840]  to that, global bank, global government, global tax, that is the slug that's already
[41:20.840 --> 41:29.520]  had the cap busted, and the bullets already been firing down the rifle barrel.
[41:29.520 --> 41:35.120]  The question is, will we flinch and wake up and arrest the bankers and bring this all
[41:35.120 --> 41:36.120]  to an end?
[41:36.120 --> 41:39.680]  We're going to flinch at the last minute, grab the gun away from them, arrest the bankers,
[41:39.680 --> 41:41.320]  bring them to justice.
[41:41.320 --> 41:46.520]  Or will the bullet graze us, and will the bankers jump back and get in a prone position to
[41:46.520 --> 41:49.040]  fire more slugs into us?
[41:49.040 --> 41:54.720]  Or will we go ahead and let them keep the barrel up against our head as that bullet
[41:54.720 --> 41:58.520]  goes right through our skull into our collective brain?
[41:58.520 --> 42:00.640]  But that's one of the bullets.
[42:00.640 --> 42:05.720]  The others, bird flu or airborne Ebola, the globalists of course all have real vaccines
[42:05.720 --> 42:10.060]  and cures for whatever they release on us.
[42:10.060 --> 42:15.480]  Another one's nuking cities or other big stage terror attacks, more jets flying into buildings.
[42:15.480 --> 42:20.560]  Another slug is staging a new war, starting World War III with Iran, getting into a theater
[42:20.560 --> 42:21.560]  operation.
[42:21.560 --> 42:24.840]  They'll have a side deal with the Russians and the Chinese to only have ground wars
[42:24.840 --> 42:35.280]  and not use nukes, and it'll be like Korea, Vietnam, and everything wound into one.
[42:35.280 --> 42:41.200]  So that's just some of what could happen.
[42:41.200 --> 42:49.240]  So you've got the banking takeover, you've got the bio attack, you've got the nuke staged
[42:49.240 --> 42:54.040]  terror attack or other terror attack along those lines are smaller, could be bigger.
[42:54.040 --> 42:59.440]  You've got the World War III scenario, you've got the illegal alien rioting scenario, don't
[42:59.440 --> 43:02.880]  think they don't have community leaders in every barrio in the country where they can
[43:02.880 --> 43:09.920]  go out, have some of their operatives engage in an atrocity against inner city use, kill
[43:09.920 --> 43:16.800]  them, whatever, then have the police not prosecute the other cops and things will blow up.
[43:16.800 --> 43:19.920]  They can do that.
[43:19.920 --> 43:25.040]  They can try gun confiscation, that'll start World War III here in the U.S. and that's
[43:25.040 --> 43:27.200]  six different things they can do.
[43:27.200 --> 43:34.160]  There's a lot of other things they can do as well because they need crises.
[43:34.160 --> 43:39.200]  Down the road as the economy gets worse, there'll be more and more riots, more and more crime.
[43:39.200 --> 43:41.520]  That's kind of another slow burn option.
[43:41.520 --> 43:46.240]  The public begs the police and military into their streets, they go out, they restore order,
[43:46.240 --> 43:53.240]  they turn the economy back on for a spell.
[43:53.240 --> 43:58.160]  People accept troops on the streets and then they move into another phase, but it doesn't
[43:58.160 --> 44:04.120]  appear that they're going with the incremental operation anymore.
[44:04.120 --> 44:07.080]  The globalists are openly announcing, they're basically shutting down the Internet as we
[44:07.080 --> 44:11.640]  know it with cocktail different operations, ending that neutrality Internet taxation regulation
[44:11.640 --> 44:18.400]  control.
[44:18.400 --> 44:20.400]  That's some of the news we have.
[44:20.400 --> 44:25.240]  And then I've got all this bird flu news, I'm going to listen to this.
[44:25.240 --> 44:29.920]  Bird flu found on Kentucky poultry farm all over the world, countries are saying they're
[44:29.920 --> 44:33.320]  not going to take chickens from Kentucky and now they're saying it may spread to other
[44:33.320 --> 44:35.440]  states.
[44:35.440 --> 44:38.480]  State and federal authorities are investigating an outbreak of bird flu on a poultry farm
[44:38.480 --> 44:40.960]  in Western Kentucky.
[44:40.960 --> 44:46.200]  State veterinarian Robert C. Stout said the strain discovered is the non-pathogenic or
[44:46.200 --> 44:52.480]  low-pathogenic and poses a minimal risk to human health, Stout said it is not the high-pathogenic
[44:52.480 --> 44:56.200]  strain associated with human and poultry deaths in other countries.
[44:56.200 --> 45:01.760]  So this is just more of the fear mongering, getting you ready for all of this.
[45:01.760 --> 45:06.280]  Remember it was the British government who admittedly released foot and mouth back eight
[45:06.280 --> 45:11.240]  years ago and we said, look how bird, how foot and mouth popped up all over England in a
[45:11.240 --> 45:18.320]  two-day period from Scotland to Wales to Cornwall in just a few days.
[45:18.320 --> 45:25.000]  I said that's the government and then how the government identified it in all these
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.840]  locations in two days and sure enough it came out, the government released it, port and
[45:28.840 --> 45:30.360]  down by a weapons lab.
[45:30.360 --> 45:35.920]  That's mainstream news.
[45:35.920 --> 45:41.120]  You can just Google bird, not bird flu, foot and mouth came from port and down.
[45:41.120 --> 45:45.760]  You'll get London telegraph, VBC and they go, oh, somebody is an environmental terrorist
[45:45.760 --> 45:47.120]  that works for the government.
[45:47.120 --> 45:53.040]  They got into a level four zoological bioweapons lab and they snuck it past the up through
[45:53.040 --> 45:56.960]  three floors and out of the containment units and through the machine gun nest and then
[45:56.960 --> 46:02.520]  this one person went to over 50 locations and just magically gave it to all the cows
[46:02.520 --> 46:03.520]  and sheep.
[46:03.520 --> 46:05.720]  Yeah, sure.
[46:05.720 --> 46:14.880]  See, how dumb do they think we are, it's impossible for one person to travel in 24 hours to 50
[46:14.880 --> 46:21.800]  plus locations all over a country and then sneak on to farms and facilities and give
[46:21.800 --> 46:24.120]  animals foot and mouth.
[46:24.120 --> 46:29.600]  So I said it's a government and it was the stinking government and it wasn't one person
[46:29.600 --> 46:35.240]  just like the anthrax, the most weaponized anthrax ever seen, US weapons grade, the patent,
[46:35.240 --> 46:43.040]  he takes $100 plus million worth of equipment just to put the little sales, they put nanotech
[46:43.040 --> 46:50.240]  airplane sales, little wings on each miniaturized, that's another, they said 50 plus million
[46:50.240 --> 47:00.000]  dollar system, just to miniaturize and breed anthrax down to, it's like taking a bull mastiff
[47:00.000 --> 47:03.560]  and turning it into a toy chihuahua that weighs one pound basically.
[47:03.560 --> 47:09.800]  They take it and shrink it down about a thousand times and then they go in and nanotech wings
[47:09.800 --> 47:17.720]  on it so it's very aerosolized and they attack all of George Bush's enemies, including the
[47:17.720 --> 47:23.720]  publisher that showed his daughters falling down drunk on each other.
[47:23.720 --> 47:27.360]  That's why people tried to come to me in Austin with all these hard stories of the Bush daughters
[47:27.360 --> 47:29.520]  and I'm like, I don't want to hear it.
[47:29.520 --> 47:32.840]  That's the one way I'd have a hit team coming here and kill me dead in a hammer.
[47:32.840 --> 47:34.920]  It's all personal with these global Matthias.
[47:34.920 --> 47:38.120]  They almost enjoy me getting up here and telling you how your slaves now they're going to kill
[47:38.120 --> 47:39.120]  you.
[47:39.120 --> 47:41.320]  They don't mess with their little cockroach children.
[47:41.320 --> 47:46.040]  I'll tell you that right now until I was in a bar where they were falling down, I was
[47:46.040 --> 47:52.280]  in a restaurant, they were falling down drunk and Kevin boosts like, who's scared of camera
[47:52.280 --> 47:53.280]  in the car?
[47:53.280 --> 47:55.200]  And I said, buddy, you want to sign your death warrant?
[47:55.200 --> 47:56.200]  He says, I'm getting it.
[47:56.200 --> 48:01.560]  And I grabbed by the arm and I said, no, you don't buddy and not because I'm scared of
[48:01.560 --> 48:04.760]  dying, but I'm going to die for something like exposing the new world order.
[48:04.760 --> 48:07.400]  I'm not going to go up to the mobsters and punch them right in the nose.
[48:07.400 --> 48:10.840]  I'm going to go around, expose them as criminals and tell them get off my back.
[48:10.840 --> 48:13.000]  Anyway, side issue.
[48:13.000 --> 48:19.360]  New bird flu case suggests the danger of pandemic is rising.
[48:19.360 --> 48:26.640]  Infections in Egypt raises scientist fears that virus will be spread by humans.
[48:26.640 --> 48:30.240]  They're just getting ready to tell you it's airborne boys and girls.
[48:30.240 --> 48:35.520]  And top scientist all over Europe were in major newspapers, Poland, Czech Republic, Germany,
[48:35.520 --> 48:39.680]  in major papers that we linked to a month ago saying, we don't understand this.
[48:39.680 --> 48:45.120]  This is the perfect way to mix it with regular flu virus and then inject it to perfectly
[48:45.120 --> 48:47.720]  mutate into airborne human strain.
[48:47.720 --> 48:50.680]  This is the way we would spread it.
[48:50.680 --> 48:54.800]  And they did it through labs, through compartmentalization where they didn't tell them what they gave
[48:54.800 --> 48:55.800]  them to mix.
[48:55.800 --> 48:59.960]  They mislabeled as regular flu so that they could have plausible deniability.
[48:59.960 --> 49:05.880]  We caught them red-handed, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:05.880 --> 49:16.480]  And it's just so devastating what's happening.
[49:16.480 --> 49:21.560]  So bird flu case suggests the danger of pandemic is rising.
[49:21.560 --> 49:25.480]  So as bad as the IRS raping us to send all our money to the private Federal Reserve as
[49:25.480 --> 49:28.800]  Ronald Reagan's commission documented, all of it goes to painters on the banks.
[49:28.800 --> 49:33.720]  They set up the private Federal Reserve in 1913 in the same year they passed the unconstitutional
[49:33.720 --> 49:38.240]  amendment for the income tax and it was not ratified.
[49:38.240 --> 49:42.920]  That's on record.
[49:42.920 --> 49:46.800]  And as bad as that is in the casual society and the CPS grabbing everybody's kids and
[49:46.800 --> 49:51.840]  as bad as all that is and we got to fight it, I believe the New World Order is getting
[49:51.840 --> 49:55.960]  ready to start World War III, set off nukes, release bio weapons.
[49:55.960 --> 49:58.840]  Any one of those are a mix of them, start riots.
[49:58.840 --> 49:59.840]  They have done it before.
[49:59.840 --> 50:00.840]  They will do it again.
[50:00.840 --> 50:06.160]  I mean, they engineered World War II, funded Hitler, Stalin, the U.S., all sides.
[50:06.160 --> 50:07.360]  That's declassified.
[50:07.360 --> 50:11.280]  They funded Pol Pot, Mao, all of them now all declassified.
[50:11.280 --> 50:14.760]  All these former CIA section chiefs write books about it.
[50:14.760 --> 50:16.920]  Brzezinski wrote a book last year bragging about it.
[50:16.920 --> 50:22.000]  I mean, he's proud that he funded Pol Pot to kill 3 million.
[50:22.000 --> 50:27.200]  Oh, but they won't hurt us American people.
[50:27.200 --> 50:30.440]  They'll kill 3 million Cambodians and brag about it.
[50:30.440 --> 50:33.440]  They'll kill a million 300,000 Iraqis and brag about it.
[50:33.440 --> 50:36.440]  They'll kill tens of thousands of Serbs and radiate their whole country and brag about
[50:36.440 --> 50:37.440]  it.
[50:37.440 --> 50:41.920]  They'll go and have eight times increase in the poppy field productions after the liberation
[50:41.920 --> 50:46.080]  of Afghanistan seven years ago and brag about it.
[50:46.080 --> 50:48.720]  They'll do all of this, but they're not going to hurt us.
[50:48.720 --> 50:52.200]  Here's another one, bird flu found in Kentucky poultry farm.
[50:52.200 --> 50:57.080]  All right, I'm going to get us some financial news and a bunch of other police state news
[50:57.080 --> 50:58.080]  when we get back.
[50:58.080 --> 51:00.800]  Stay with us.
[51:00.800 --> 51:05.280]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor
[51:05.280 --> 51:08.120]  in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[51:08.120 --> 51:13.000]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of eight or higher.
[51:13.000 --> 51:18.280]  Alchovision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[51:18.280 --> 51:22.560]  Alkalizing plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you
[51:22.560 --> 51:25.920]  get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[51:25.920 --> 51:31.480]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[51:31.480 --> 51:35.920]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[51:35.920 --> 51:37.240]  of your body.
[51:37.240 --> 51:42.800]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[51:42.800 --> 51:48.840]  Here's your bottle of Alchovision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alchovision.com.
[51:48.840 --> 52:01.240]  That's alkavision.com or by calling 269-216-97767, 269-216-9767 today.
[52:01.240 --> 52:06.640]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[52:06.640 --> 52:12.520]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong.
[52:12.520 --> 52:14.640]  Just as well funded.
[52:14.640 --> 52:19.780]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[52:19.780 --> 52:21.280]  of the American people.
[52:21.280 --> 52:25.680]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[52:25.680 --> 52:30.800]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[52:30.800 --> 52:37.320]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[52:37.320 --> 52:40.880]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[52:40.880 --> 52:47.760]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[52:53.240 --> 52:55.960]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[52:55.960 --> 52:57.520]  The Obama deception.
[52:57.520 --> 53:02.240]  The people strike back.
[53:02.240 --> 53:03.680]  Recognize that sound?
[53:03.680 --> 53:07.520]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are
[53:07.520 --> 53:08.520]  ending up.
[53:08.520 --> 53:11.200]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[53:11.200 --> 53:16.280]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed, so
[53:16.280 --> 53:21.640]  for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[53:21.640 --> 53:25.280]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[53:25.280 --> 53:27.640]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.
[53:27.640 --> 53:33.040]  Introducing chews for health, a delicious tasting chewable containing 16 super fruits,
[53:33.040 --> 53:35.400]  seed vegetables, and antioxidants.
[53:35.400 --> 53:38.040]  Stop paying for nutrients your body doesn't use.
[53:38.040 --> 53:43.400]  Order chews for health today, 1-800-210-1922.
[53:43.400 --> 53:48.800]  The first 300 callers will receive a free copy of my best-selling CD, America's Unbalanced
[53:48.800 --> 53:49.800]  Diet.
[53:49.800 --> 53:56.680]  Isn't it time you stop flushing your vitamins down the toilet, 1-800-210-1922, or go to
[53:56.680 --> 54:19.760]  www.orderchews.com and you know, I'm sorry if some of you think this is all gloom and
[54:19.760 --> 54:20.760]  doom.
[54:20.760 --> 54:30.640]  We're not gonna turn this around unless we face the true magnitude of the evil that we're
[54:30.640 --> 54:38.320]  dealing with as these societies, these guilds of criminals who've been studying how to manipulate
[54:38.320 --> 54:46.160]  control populations for centuries, for thousands of years, and passing the data down, the knowledge
[54:46.160 --> 54:52.360]  down, if we don't wake up and get active and get truly informed, they are gonna win.
[54:52.360 --> 54:56.400]  Because now because of technology, because of systems, they've decided they don't need
[54:56.400 --> 55:03.560]  us anymore, and all the major western governments have this as policy, reducing our numbers by
[55:03.560 --> 55:05.000]  at least 80%.
[55:05.000 --> 55:11.760]  That's in the State Department of Random, 200, and others.
[55:11.760 --> 55:18.040]  So when I get up here and I tell you, they've been testing controlled bio-weapon releases.
[55:18.040 --> 55:19.720]  I mean it.
[55:19.720 --> 55:21.040]  What do you think Africa is?
[55:21.040 --> 55:25.520]  It's a testing ground for all this stuff.
[55:25.520 --> 55:33.880]  Now in other news, sales tax revenue falls at fastest pace in years, the Wall Street
[55:33.880 --> 55:39.360]  Journal reports, just what Lindsay Williams and others have been talking about, because
[55:39.360 --> 55:43.600]  you have a depression in the real economy.
[55:43.600 --> 55:49.720]  The real economy is imploding, is contracting, as you all are well aware, living in the real
[55:49.720 --> 55:50.880]  world.
[55:50.880 --> 55:56.960]  While the banking economy is consolidating and vertically integrating, and the entirety,
[55:56.960 --> 56:04.080]  literally 95%, the number's 30 to 1, so average that out.
[56:04.080 --> 56:12.280]  It's about 97% then. 97% of it is all going to them, and they say, oh, give us more money,
[56:12.280 --> 56:14.360]  we'll turn the economy back on.
[56:14.360 --> 56:18.160]  They have a built-in incentive to not want the economy to turn back on.
[56:18.160 --> 56:21.480]  They are vertically integrating.
[56:21.480 --> 56:26.240]  State and local sales tax revenue fell more sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008, because
[56:26.240 --> 56:30.800]  these numbers are always four or five months old, than any time in the past half century,
[56:30.800 --> 56:33.320]  and has continued to erode through the beginning of 2009.
[56:33.320 --> 56:38.360]  Yeah, housing starts are the lowest in U.S. history.
[56:38.360 --> 56:42.240]  All the numbers are coming in, that this is going to be worse than the Great Depression
[56:42.240 --> 56:44.240]  if it continues.
[56:44.240 --> 56:49.120]  They're breaking all the records, because they've turned the money supply off.
[56:49.120 --> 56:50.880]  We live in a fiat system.
[56:50.880 --> 56:55.840]  Fiat's fine, except it gives a private group of bankers total control, and they can't help,
[56:55.840 --> 57:00.960]  but use it to their advantage and abuse us, and it's real simple.
[57:00.960 --> 57:04.040]  Use somebody the keys of the city and say, do whatever you want, and you're the boss,
[57:04.040 --> 57:09.000]  and give them enforcers so they can militarily block you, taking their hands from around
[57:09.000 --> 57:10.000]  your neck.
[57:10.000 --> 57:11.720]  They're going to abuse you.
[57:11.720 --> 57:15.160]  That's why the world works, folks.
[57:15.160 --> 57:20.400]  You try to take them the nicest person, and giving them your business, and unlimited
[57:20.400 --> 57:26.720]  power to take your business over, and say, I'll be back in 10 years, put all the money
[57:26.720 --> 57:32.440]  I make, or I save over here in a pile, and you get to keep this reasonable sum.
[57:32.440 --> 57:37.760]  I would venture to say 98% of people, when you got back in 10 years, would tell, the
[57:37.760 --> 57:38.760]  locks would be changed.
[57:38.760 --> 57:43.000]  They'd say, I own this now, and they'd call the police on you.
[57:43.000 --> 57:48.160]  Now, what did the government do?
[57:48.160 --> 57:52.120]  It became completely illegitimate, and that's all that's happened.
[57:52.120 --> 57:53.120]  It's called tyranny.
[57:53.120 --> 57:57.200]  We're going to be simulcasting, coming up at the eight after, I'm going to come back
[57:57.200 --> 58:05.120]  and continue covering this news, then I'm going to be on Tom Hartman's show.
[58:05.120 --> 58:10.120]  One of the biggest progressive liberal shows out there, they want to simulcast, so we're
[58:10.120 --> 58:11.120]  doing it.
[58:11.120 --> 58:12.120]  That should be interesting.
[58:12.120 --> 58:20.680]  Four stations out there, the local breaks, your breaks will be on time, five after to
[58:20.680 --> 58:26.200]  eight after, hardy after to 33 after, and in the end of the hour, but we're going to
[58:26.200 --> 58:35.320]  be breaking at 12.15 to 12.19 at Genesis, and the network break, and we're going to
[58:35.320 --> 58:43.080]  be breaking at 44 after next hour.
[58:43.080 --> 58:45.480]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:45.480 --> 59:11.280]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[59:11.280 --> 59:29.840]  Thank you for listening to GCNLive, and don't forget to subscribe to GCNLive.com, and don't
[59:29.840 --> 59:58.920]  forget to subscribe to GCNLive.com.
[1:00:24.360 --> 1:00:29.120]  coming up in eight minutes, we're going to start simulcasting at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:30.120]  Let me just say this.
[1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:38.240]  There's going to be a surprise on air when I go live simulcasting with Tom Hartman.
[1:00:38.240 --> 1:00:41.560]  Everybody wants to get over to the new prisonplanet.tv.
[1:00:41.560 --> 1:00:44.480]  We launched that thing a week and a half ago, and I really have only plugged it like
[1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:46.120]  once.
[1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:52.600]  We hired a firm to give it the latest Web 2.0 look, but functionality, where the videos
[1:00:52.600 --> 1:00:56.840]  are all categorized much better, where the site's much quicker.
[1:00:56.840 --> 1:01:00.920]  We're really, really proud of the new prisonplanet.tv, and we want to thank all the members out
[1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:06.360]  there for making the show possible.
[1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:11.960]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, prisonplanet.tv, you get all 22 of my films, Jason Burmes's
[1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:18.040]  film, Fabled Enemies, you get, well, it's just they're all there.
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:23.640]  You get the Obama Deception, Super High Quality, DivEx.
[1:01:23.640 --> 1:01:30.760]  The DivEx copy is close to DVD quality, and it burns to regular CDs that play in most
[1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:33.200]  new DVD players.
[1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:34.640]  So you can vary inexpensively.
[1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:40.960]  I'm talking 10, 15 cents a piece, go in there and burn DivEx copies off of prisonplanet.tv.
[1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:41.960]  What an activist tool.
[1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:50.120]  And by the way, at these events all over the United States, where you have libertarians,
[1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:56.160]  conservatives, 9-11 truthers, a lot of neocon talk show hosts trying to co-opt the kind
[1:01:56.160 --> 1:02:01.280]  of grassroots movement that manifests itself through Ron Paul last year.
[1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:11.680]  But we're actually there recruiting into reality the neocon followers that are kind of falling
[1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:18.220]  prey to the right wing of this bird of prey that is the New World Order.
[1:02:18.220 --> 1:02:24.200]  So we got a big surprise coming up when we simulcast with Tom Hartman in the next segment.
[1:02:24.200 --> 1:02:29.560]  And again, I want to encourage all the listeners to go to prisonplanet.tv.
[1:02:29.560 --> 1:02:36.600]  It is 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month, and that finances so much of what we're doing here,
[1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:38.480]  and we just make the site better and better.
[1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:49.000]  This fifth anniversary was April 10th, five days ago, that is many, many years.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.080]  Five years, thousands and thousands of piece of media.
[1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:56.520]  We simulcast the TV show for at least two hours a day, but we're going to do two hours
[1:02:56.520 --> 1:02:57.520]  and 52 minutes today.
[1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:02.160]  We're going to start simulcasting at the gate after.
[1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:07.720]  So again, prisonplanet.tv, I'm laughing at what's about to happen here in studio when
[1:03:07.720 --> 1:03:09.280]  we come back live.
[1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:23.120]  This will be a first time because it is April 15th.
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:29.480]  So again, prisonplanet.tv, please, if you had a membership in the past, I mean, just
[1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:33.200]  two years ago, we still had two servers, and it would slow down at night and wasn't quick.
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:37.700]  Then two years ago, we got CDNs, it got lightning fast to download and stream all my films,
[1:03:37.700 --> 1:03:41.880]  and high quality, the TV show and everything else.
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:44.720]  And then now we've added a whole other level, and then we've got, that's only phase one,
[1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:48.440]  we've got phase two, three, and four, where it's just going to have so many other facets
[1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:50.920]  and things we're going to be adding in the next few months.
[1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:55.600]  Just waiting to see folks, prisonplanet.tv, and what really supports this is buying the
[1:03:55.600 --> 1:04:01.300]  hard copy, highest quality DVD with the extras at infowars.com, then you get a free pocket
[1:04:01.300 --> 1:04:08.560]  constitution, which is a dollar value, a couple of infowars.com, anti-tyranny bumper stickers,
[1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:12.360]  and some other little goodies we throw into every order when you go to a secure online
[1:04:12.360 --> 1:04:16.480]  video and bookstore, shopping cart at infowars.com.
[1:04:16.480 --> 1:04:25.040]  You can also call toll free to ask about the combos and specials we have 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:30.480]  All right, Tom Hartman of Air America, and he's on a bunch of other stations, he will
[1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:34.080]  be simulcasting with us for the rest of the hour.
[1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:38.440]  Again, for stations, we'll be back at 8 after and join them in progress, and then we're
[1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:49.800]  going to have an early break because we're going to do their clock from 2.15.51 to 12.15.51
[1:04:49.800 --> 1:04:50.800]  to 12.19.51.
[1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:54.960]  That'll be the next break coming up, and then we'll go up to the bottom of the hour.
[1:04:54.960 --> 1:04:59.480]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us, the simulcast, and surprise, is straight ahead
[1:04:59.480 --> 1:05:01.000]  at PresumPlanet.tv.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:05.520]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and
[1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:09.160]  what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:13.800]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:18.440]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[1:05:18.440 --> 1:05:20.040]  It's a documented fact.
[1:05:20.040 --> 1:05:26.000]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:27.320]  parasitic infection.
[1:05:27.320 --> 1:05:32.200]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and
[1:05:32.200 --> 1:05:38.520]  safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage
[1:05:38.520 --> 1:05:39.520]  once a day.
[1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:43.680]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:46.680]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[1:05:46.680 --> 1:05:50.680]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[1:05:50.680 --> 1:05:57.600]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[1:05:57.600 --> 1:06:01.400]  That's 888-949-3570.
[1:06:01.400 --> 1:06:06.760]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:06:06.760 --> 1:06:13.440]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:14.760]  just as well-funded.
[1:06:14.760 --> 1:06:19.920]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:06:19.920 --> 1:06:20.920]  of the American people.
[1:06:20.920 --> 1:06:25.840]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:30.920]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:06:30.920 --> 1:06:37.440]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:41.000]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:47.920]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:56.120]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[1:06:56.120 --> 1:07:00.680]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:04.680]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins
[1:07:04.680 --> 1:07:06.080]  or herbal supplements?
[1:07:06.080 --> 1:07:10.480]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos and toothpaste contain chemical additives
[1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:14.600]  such as sodium, laurel, sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:18.160]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:21.440]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[1:07:21.440 --> 1:07:24.000]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.080]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products.

[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:25.680]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on April 15th.
[1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:30.440]  This is when, for the last 94 years, you pay your income taxes, the private run-for-profit
[1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:36.040]  Federal Reserve, all on interest of the debt, now $12.8 trillion they've stolen the last
[1:08:36.040 --> 1:08:41.000]  six months in a bipartisan heist that's going on, they have us all confused with the false
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.400]  left-right paradigm, that's how they control us.
[1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:48.280]  We are trying to break the people out of this and get back to liberty versus tyranny.
[1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:54.440]  And we are simulcasting with one of the most popular, quote, progressive or liberal talk
[1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:58.760]  show hosts in the country, Tom Hartman, syndicated across the country.
[1:08:58.760 --> 1:09:00.400]  Mr. Hartman, it's good to have you with us.
[1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:02.600]  Hey, Alex Jones, how are you?
[1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:04.400]  I am good, you are very loud.
[1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:06.440]  I certainly heard that.
[1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:10.520]  Hey, listen, it's good to have you here, but why don't you go ahead and start the interview
[1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:11.520]  off here?
[1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:15.280]  Okay, well, it's not so much an interview as a simulcast, we're going to do our shows
[1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:16.960]  together here, right?
[1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:21.200]  Absolutely, but I'm going to let you have the opening salvo here, because I'm literally
[1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:27.360]  shirtless here after just writing a huge income tax check to the private bankers who are bringing
[1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:29.280]  in the world government and publicly announcing it.
[1:09:29.280 --> 1:09:34.360]  Yeah, well, I was just talking about my concern that Barack Obama is in his speech yesterday
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:39.360]  was talking about how if we give money to banks, every dollar to a bank produces $8
[1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:44.600]  to $10 in loans, whereas if we give a dollar to individuals, it's only a dollar.
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:49.680]  And I'm very concerned that he's under the sway of the Geithners and the Summers of the
[1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:52.000]  world, and he's going down the Bill Clinton Road.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:56.080]  But that's a separate thing, Alex Jones, you have a new DVD out, it's called the Obama
[1:09:56.080 --> 1:09:57.720]  Deception.
[1:09:57.720 --> 1:10:02.920]  And people can find it over at your website, infowars.com and prismplanet.com and what?
[1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:04.800]  AlexJones.com, which one do you want on it?
[1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:10.160]  No, it's just infowars.com or prismplanet.com and by the way, if you just Google the Obama
[1:10:10.160 --> 1:10:16.280]  Deception, there's a couple of cruddy Google versions, but go to YouTube, it'll say Obama
[1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:17.280]  Deception High Quality.
[1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:21.720]  It's like the third or fourth link, it's got about a million, 400,000 views or so.
[1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:24.120]  That's the best free copy I've seen on the web.
[1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:28.120]  So I would just tell your listeners, please don't believe me, I cut my teeth, you know,
[1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:33.080]  going after Clinton, I was called a right winger, then I went after Bush because he was violating
[1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:37.840]  the Constitution and I was called, you know, a communist.
[1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:42.560]  They said I secretly worked for Al Qaeda, I mean, literally I worked for George Soros,
[1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:47.640]  they said, and then we get Barack Obama in, they're now saying I'm a right wing fascist
[1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:49.240]  Nazi in league with Hitler.
[1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:53.640]  And so I want people to actually see the film because it's what you just brought up.
[1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:58.160]  We have Geithner, the head of the New York Fed in league with the head of Goldman Sachs,
[1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:04.120]  who was Treasury Secretary at the time, literally handing over unlimited power and control bipartisanly
[1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:09.840]  to these offshore banks and Obama has lied about hiring lobbyists, lied about the war,
[1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:14.720]  lied about warrantless wiretapping and secret arrest and rights for detainees and then he
[1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:20.440]  lied about saying that he was fighting against the bonuses when he signed the executive order
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:25.960]  and told Senator Dodd to pass the writer on the bill so that they could take the money.
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:31.200]  I mean, all I'm saying is Barack Obama is as phony as a $3 bill and Barack Obama is
[1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:33.040]  the new older's closer.
[1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:38.160]  The establishment was worried about the left waking up to what the corporate system was
[1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:39.160]  doing.
[1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:42.640]  There was a real revolution in this country, the left and the right were coming together
[1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:43.640]  as popular.
[1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:48.280]  Well, and here's what's happening, Alex Jones, is that while I'm reluctant to use the word
[1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:53.880]  lied because, well, it's just, it's a slap and frankly a lot of us worked really hard
[1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:57.400]  to get Barack Obama elected and think that at the core he's a decent guy, the guy was
[1:11:57.400 --> 1:12:02.800]  a constitutional scholar, I was shocked when a constitutional scholar voted for FISA.
[1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:08.680]  I was shocked when, you know, the list of things of what you described as lies is accurate
[1:12:08.680 --> 1:12:14.200]  to the best of my knowledge and now, you know, with Bagram and his administration is saying,
[1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:19.040]  oh, yeah, we can detain people forever with no habeas corpus, just not at Guantanamo,
[1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:22.960]  we just moved them to Bagram and I'm like, wait a minute, this isn't what I voted for.
[1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:28.400]  On the other hand, and I think that there's a number of areas where you and I probably
[1:12:28.400 --> 1:12:35.840]  have shared what folks outside of our respective circles might refer to as conspiracy theories.
[1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:44.160]  There are others where I'm sure we differ, but for example, you set up your movie with
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:50.400]  this thing about the Bilderberg group and yet, you're going on Fox News, which is, you know,
[1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:53.120]  you realize Rupert Murdoch has shown up at Bilderberg meetings.
[1:12:53.120 --> 1:13:04.040]  Sir, I mean, I go on your show, I go on Iranian TV and what I'm saying is that this isn't
[1:13:04.040 --> 1:13:06.320]  a secret conspiracy.
[1:13:06.320 --> 1:13:10.120]  The conspiracy is right out there for everyone to see.
[1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:12.600]  They're rubbing our faces in it.
[1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:18.040]  It doesn't require a bunch of people sitting in a closed room to plot the future of the
[1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:19.040]  world.
[1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:20.960]  They're doing it right out in front of us.
[1:13:20.960 --> 1:13:24.920]  My biggest concern, frankly, is the Federalist Society, this group of this right-wing group
[1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:29.040]  that has taken over our courts that believes that corporations should have the same rights
[1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:30.040]  as persons.
[1:13:30.040 --> 1:13:31.040]  Well, absolutely.
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:36.360]  Look, they've co-opted and controlled the right, as you know, and now they're trying
[1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:38.000]  to co-opt these Tea Parties.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:42.400]  These Tea Parties have been going on for a year, or longer, 9-11 Truth actually started
[1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:47.200]  the Tea Parties, and you had liberals, conservatives really fusing together as constitutionalists
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:50.160]  to people that wanted liberty, and then we see a clear operative.
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:53.040]  I mean, there's no doubt I've seen him going off-scripts.
[1:13:53.040 --> 1:13:59.480]  Mr. Becky, coming out now, trying to co-opt these, the local neocon host, who are totally
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:01.200]  discredited in every city.
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:05.320]  It came out that over a million Iraqis died, it came out they lied about WMDs, it came
[1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:09.760]  out that they were for the police state and even gun control, and so conservatives have
[1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:10.760]  been-
[1:14:10.760 --> 1:14:11.760]  The Bush administration.
[1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:12.760]  The Bush administration.
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:16.240]  So, they've all basically left the Republican Party, and so the Republican Party is trying
[1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:19.640]  to latch on, and that's what Fox News and others are doing.
[1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:22.120]  Right, so they're phony populists.
[1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:23.120]  They're phony populists.
[1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:27.680]  I mean, you've got Dick Armey out there, Dick Armey, who is a lobbyist, right, for the
[1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:30.200]  interests of the very wealthy and powerful in this country.
[1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:34.800]  He's a lobbyist for pharmaceutical companies, I went through the list earlier, I'm not sure
[1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:37.920]  where it is in my stack, my explosion of papers here all over the desk right now.
[1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:41.480]  Dick Armey is the consummate lobbyist, just like everybody else in Washington.
[1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:45.320]  And his Freedom Watch is one of the groups that is really, really pushing these Tea Parties,
[1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:50.400]  and it's like, you know, I don't get it how the average working person, and here you're
[1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:55.040]  approaching it arguably from the right, and I'm approaching it arguably from the left.
[1:14:55.040 --> 1:15:02.240]  And yet, I think that there are a variety of areas where Americans are being asked to
[1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:07.080]  say that they're right or left, being asked to define themselves as Republicans or Democrats,
[1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:11.360]  and neither party is addressing their interests in many real ways.
[1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:16.200]  Now I think that my solution to this, and I think in some ways may be very different
[1:15:16.200 --> 1:15:20.960]  from yours, Alex, I'd like to get your take on this, my solution to this is that we infiltrate
[1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:21.960]  the political parties.
[1:15:21.960 --> 1:15:26.200]  I mean, if you and I wanted to take over NBC, we'd have to have hundreds of billions of
[1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:27.200]  dollars.
[1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:28.200]  No way we could do it.
[1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:32.360]  But the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are both standing out there with enormous
[1:15:32.360 --> 1:15:36.200]  power and levers of power and millions of dollars, and they're standing out there saying,
[1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:38.560]  please show up and volunteer for the meetings.
[1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:45.320]  And in my book, Screwed, I document how in Colorado, in New Mexico, and in Oregon, activists
[1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:49.800]  showed up at the county level and took over the local Democratic Party.
[1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:51.640]  No, no, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:52.960]  We've been taking over the system.
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:53.960]  Jim Euclid, from Ida Sreese.
[1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:54.960]  He's still...
[1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:55.960]  It's 20 to...
[1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:58.960]  It's going to fire when you're ready.
[1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:14.280]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[1:16:14.280 --> 1:16:17.520]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:21.120]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published
[1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:25.800]  the long-term fiscal outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling
[1:16:25.800 --> 1:16:26.920]  out of control.
[1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:31.560]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to ensure bank
[1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:33.240]  deposits.
[1:16:33.240 --> 1:16:36.800]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S. dollar are inevitable pressures facing
[1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:37.960]  the economy.
[1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:42.320]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[1:16:42.320 --> 1:16:45.080]  The U.S. GAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[1:16:45.080 --> 1:16:47.720]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:52.840]  That's 800-686-2237.
[1:16:52.840 --> 1:16:58.960]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:03.440]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:04.760]  us would like to see.
[1:17:04.760 --> 1:17:09.920]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:17:09.920 --> 1:17:11.320]  of the American people.
[1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:15.680]  While Obama's already fudging, it's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:17:15.680 --> 1:17:20.800]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:28.920]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:17:28.920 --> 1:17:30.600]  It's not about left or right.
[1:17:30.600 --> 1:17:32.480]  It's about a one-world government.
[1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:39.400]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:17:57.680 --> 1:18:00.800]  Times are tough right now and people are unsure about our future.
[1:18:00.800 --> 1:18:05.240]  The economy is hurting even though there are powers that would make us believe differently.
[1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:08.160]  Banks are failing and the gold buyers are buying.
[1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:13.800]  Question, with all the chemicals being put into our air, how do you use gold when you
[1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:16.640]  are very sick or dead?
[1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:18.800]  Living in precious metals is smart.
[1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:21.120]  Investing in your health could be smarter.

[1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:00.960]  Have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief
[1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:01.960]  is?
[1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:04.160]  The answer you're looking for is the bailout group.

[1:19:52.240 --> 1:20:08.040]  Did you know that grapes are one of the most heavily sprayed of all agricultural products?
[1:20:08.040 --> 1:20:09.040]  That's fine.
[1:20:09.040 --> 1:20:10.040]  We're waiting for them.
[1:20:10.040 --> 1:20:13.840]  They went to break about 20 seconds late, we're following their clock.
[1:20:13.840 --> 1:20:17.760]  And that is exactly what we are inviting you to do today.
[1:20:17.760 --> 1:20:19.280]  Taste our wines.
[1:20:19.280 --> 1:20:20.760]  We select them personally.
[1:20:20.760 --> 1:20:23.680]  They come from small properties in the south of France.
[1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:28.640]  They are delicious, connoisseurs love them, and they are earth friendly.
[1:20:28.640 --> 1:20:29.720]  My name is Veronique.
[1:20:29.720 --> 1:20:34.560]  I founded the organic wine company in 1980 for people just like you.
[1:20:34.560 --> 1:20:38.240]  People who love wine and want to do well by our earth.
[1:20:38.240 --> 1:20:40.480]  Call us at 1-888-ECO-WINE.
[1:20:40.480 --> 1:20:41.840]  We'll answer all your questions.

[1:20:43.800 --> 1:21:10.800]  Call 1-888-ECO-WINE and that is E-C-O-W-I-N-E.
[1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:16.080]  Okay Mr. Hartman, are we back together here?
[1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:21.600]  Up in the water cooler wars, Tom Hartman here with you and we are doing a, sometimes it's
[1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:25.760]  hard to stitch together two radio shows, well sometimes it's always a challenge to stitch
[1:21:25.760 --> 1:21:27.760]  together two radio shows.
[1:21:27.760 --> 1:21:31.400]  And we're doing it today with Alex Jones and his show.
[1:21:31.400 --> 1:21:32.640]  And is Alex with us?
[1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:33.640]  Yes, I'm here.
[1:21:33.640 --> 1:21:34.640]  This is very exciting.
[1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:35.640]  I think we did it okay.
[1:21:35.640 --> 1:21:44.240]  I've got on the clock here that we're going to break next time at 26, after 26 minutes
[1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:45.240]  of 51.
[1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:46.240]  I just want to double check because...
[1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:51.360]  Yeah, I'm showing 27.50 is our break, but I'm, you know, Sean can, Sean can correctly
[1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:52.360]  but...
[1:21:52.360 --> 1:21:53.360]  Ah!
[1:21:53.360 --> 1:21:54.360]  These are the numbers we were given, so...
[1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:55.360]  Okay.
[1:21:55.360 --> 1:21:56.360]  No big deal.
[1:21:56.360 --> 1:21:57.360]  This is exciting.
[1:21:57.360 --> 1:21:58.360]  This is fun.
[1:21:58.360 --> 1:22:00.880]  Tom, look, regardless, they've stolen $12.8 trillion.
[1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:05.600]  They are taking over, they call it a conspiracy theory when a week and a half ago it was
[1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:09.640]  in the Tennessee newspapers, I had listeners calling going, the regular army is going to
[1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:11.740]  be running checkpoints on the highways.
[1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:15.000]  We call the governor's office, the governor comes out and says the army isn't allowed
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:18.480]  to run checkpoints, and then the weekend came and it was in the newspapers that they
[1:22:18.480 --> 1:22:23.240]  shut the highways down and had a regular army out with the police stopping the traffic
[1:22:23.240 --> 1:22:26.880]  it sent for miles on major roads, searching everywhere.
[1:22:26.880 --> 1:22:31.440]  This is a clear violation of Posse Comitatus and it blew my mind when I think it was the
[1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:35.280]  John Warner defense appropriation bill during the Bush administration that they blew up
[1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:36.280]  Posse Comitatus.
[1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:37.280]  Yes.
[1:22:37.280 --> 1:22:41.160]  Let me just, and again, this is something that I think people on the left and on the
[1:22:41.160 --> 1:22:45.720]  right should be equally furious about, is that our Constitution is being eviscerated
[1:22:45.720 --> 1:22:50.520]  and it's not, you know, your new DVD, The Obama Deception, I mean, you actually, I think
[1:22:50.520 --> 1:22:54.740]  in some ways I would challenge you as being somewhat disingenuous because you start out
[1:22:54.740 --> 1:23:01.200]  with crimes of the Bush administration, not the Obama administration, and there are your
[1:23:01.200 --> 1:23:05.520]  10-point thing at the end where you say that he's losing, using the global warming hoax
[1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:06.520]  to tax carbon.
[1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:11.200]  Global warming is not a hoax, I would argue, and we can debate that, although it will probably,
[1:23:11.200 --> 1:23:16.720]  you know, take hours and, but the thing about, you know, using troops here in the United
[1:23:16.720 --> 1:23:20.160]  States, I mean, they just created, this again, this was the Bush administration, they started
[1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:23.480]  the American, you know, U.S. Central Command.
[1:23:23.480 --> 1:23:24.480]  Yeah, Northcom.
[1:23:24.480 --> 1:23:25.480]  Northcom.
[1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:26.480]  Yeah, Northcom.
[1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:27.480]  That freaks out everybody.
[1:23:27.480 --> 1:23:28.480]  Tom, here's the issue.
[1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:29.480]  Yeah.
[1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:34.360]  This is continuing but expanded under Obama because people say, oh, Obama's a lot better
[1:23:34.360 --> 1:23:36.720]  because he's a better speaker and nicer guy.
[1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:41.240]  No, it's worse because under Bush, people knew he was disingenuous.
[1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:42.800]  He came off as demonic.
[1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:44.560]  He came off as a scam artist.
[1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:46.620]  He came off as dirty, as seedy.
[1:23:46.620 --> 1:23:48.800]  With Obama, he is very charismatic.
[1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:52.880]  He does perpetually twist what he's saying.
[1:23:52.880 --> 1:23:54.480]  He says one thing and does another.
[1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:59.440]  Well, let's, let's, you know, Alex, perpetually, I mean, you know, again, I, I, I, I, I, I,
[1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:03.480]  I find myself in this weird position because I'm, I'm increasingly concerned about the
[1:24:03.480 --> 1:24:06.800]  direction that Obama's going economically and with regard to human rights and civil
[1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:07.800]  rights.
[1:24:07.800 --> 1:24:12.240]  And at the same time, I, you know, I, I think that he's doing some broadly some other good
[1:24:12.240 --> 1:24:13.240]  things.
[1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:15.240]  And these are areas, again, where probably you and I disagree.
[1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:18.520]  You're in your, in your, in your movie, you say, you know, he's going to put into place
[1:24:18.520 --> 1:24:19.720]  draft a national service.
[1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:21.600]  And in fact, he's talked about that.
[1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:25.000]  Actually Rahmanual has talked about it more explicitly.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:26.760]  This is what Thomas Jefferson wanted.
[1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:30.520]  This is the basis of the second amendment that every able-bodied man in America from
[1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:34.920]  the ages 17 to 47, Jefferson was quite explicit about it, should have a gun in his closet
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:37.920]  and be a member of a militia and that we have no standing army.
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:39.880]  Those were local posses.
[1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:41.600]  Those were not controlled by the federal government.
[1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:45.160]  No, actually the, the local militias would be responsible to county authorities who
[1:24:45.160 --> 1:24:48.280]  would be responsible to state authorities who would be responsible to federal authorities.
[1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:49.800]  But it was still local.
[1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:52.440]  And so they've turned, so they've turned that idea on its head.
[1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:59.120]  They want the locals disarmed and then they want locals purely under federal command.
[1:24:59.120 --> 1:25:03.720]  So the model Obama wants is clearly closer to the Soviet or the world war two.
[1:25:03.720 --> 1:25:07.320]  But I haven't seen that, Alex, and neither one of us actually seen any of the details
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:08.320]  in the community.
[1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:09.320]  No, I have.
[1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:10.320]  I have.
[1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:11.320]  I have.
[1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:12.320]  Okay.
[1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:13.320]  And the community service that they're talking about, you know, 50 hours of community
[1:25:13.320 --> 1:25:14.320]  service a year.
[1:25:14.320 --> 1:25:15.320]  No, no, that's the start.
[1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:16.320]  That's the start.
[1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:17.320]  I've read Rahmanual's book.
[1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:20.800]  I, what, what they had up at change.gov till they pulled it down.
[1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:24.560]  I know what they've called for under AmeriCorps and SecureCorps.
[1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:31.840]  And it is 18 to 25, three months of military basic training with assault weapons, but to
[1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:33.680]  be a domestic force, Tom.
[1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:35.600]  I mean, that is a freedom.
[1:25:35.600 --> 1:25:39.480]  If everybody in America, I mean, I would, I would think that this would be the thing
[1:25:39.480 --> 1:25:44.560]  that the gun owners of America, my friend Larry Pratt and, and you know, would, would
[1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:50.240]  be going, yeah, you know, let's have as many people in America, you know, and trained as
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:51.240]  possible.
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:52.240]  Okay.
[1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:53.240]  Well, let's take.
[1:25:53.240 --> 1:25:54.240]  Why are you concerned about that?
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:57.680]  Let's take Bush and his faith based initiatives, you know, the left didn't like that and I
[1:25:57.680 --> 1:25:58.840]  didn't like it either.
[1:25:58.840 --> 1:26:02.640]  Now Obama's all for the faith based initiative and what this is, I don't, I don't like it
[1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:03.640]  either.
[1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:04.640]  It's a whole bunch of different programs.
[1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:09.160]  Uh, if, if you look at one, by the way, Alex, okay, if you look at what they're setting
[1:26:09.160 --> 1:26:14.600]  up with these brigades and I have the Philadelphia Daily News and others, it is tattletail squads.
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:16.080]  It is warrant service.
[1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:21.160]  This is going to be one group that's armed like in the Stasi in East Germany, then with
[1:26:21.160 --> 1:26:26.320]  the rest of the people disarmed and know what Ronald manual wants is not what Thomas Jefferson
[1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:27.320]  was calling for.
[1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:28.560]  Well, we'll, we'll see.
[1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:32.440]  I mean, it's, I, and I think that we need to be having these conversations and raising
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:33.440]  these issues.
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:36.240]  Uh, you're, you're concerned about national health care.
[1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:38.080]  I'd like to get into at some point too.
[1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:40.720]  Let's take calls from our listeners though and see what they have to say.
[1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:41.720]  Absolutely.
[1:26:41.720 --> 1:26:42.720]  Thank you.
[1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:44.840]  I want to thank you for having me on your show.
[1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:46.080]  I know you're very well respected.
[1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:48.480]  You've said kind things about 9 11 truth.
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:52.440]  We now have one of the heads of the 9 11 commission coming out and saying it was all a big lie
[1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:53.440]  with the Pentagon.
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:54.440]  I'm sure you saw that.
[1:26:54.440 --> 1:26:55.440]  Yeah, I did.
[1:26:55.440 --> 1:26:58.160]  And, and Alex, so thank you for participating with me on the show and you know, we, there's
[1:26:58.160 --> 1:26:59.480]  a lot of areas where we disagree.
[1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:00.800]  There's, there's a lot of areas where we agree.
[1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:03.960]  And I think that this kind of conversation needs to happen more often in America.
[1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:04.960]  We're going to a break.
[1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:09.200]  We'll come back after the break and, uh, which we'll resolve by the way, Alex, if my numbers
[1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:15.240]  are right at about 34 after and, uh, we'll be taking calls from my, my callers, you'll
[1:27:15.240 --> 1:27:16.520]  be taking calls from your callers.
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:18.720]  We'll alternate them and we'll, we'll see what comes out of it.
[1:27:18.720 --> 1:27:19.720]  Okay, Tom.
[1:27:19.720 --> 1:27:20.720]  Thank you.
[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:21.720]  An interesting time.
[1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:26.440]  The Alex Jones show, the Tom Hartman show, uh, prisonplanet.com, infowords.com, Tom Hartman
[1:27:26.440 --> 1:27:27.440]  dot com.
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:28.440]  However you spell it, we'll get you there.
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:29.440]  We'll be right back.
[1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:30.440]  Okay.
[1:27:30.440 --> 1:27:32.800]  Uh, we're going to, they have more breaks than we do.
[1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:36.160]  People grind about our breaks, but we actually have 14 minutes an hour.
[1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:39.160]  Every standard is about 20 an hour now.
[1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:43.640]  So for all you whining about that, uh, well, then buy some of the books and videos, we
[1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:44.800]  can fund this operation.
[1:27:44.800 --> 1:27:48.600]  We get rid of all the ads we had enough funding, except that it wouldn't be tailored for M&F
[1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:54.080]  and stations, uh, out there, a lot of exciting things happening with the show, you know,
[1:27:54.080 --> 1:27:59.480]  for years, Ted Anderson has tried to get us on XM and serious and it looks like that's
[1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:00.800]  going to be happening by next month.
[1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:03.160]  I'm just going to leave it at that for you.
[1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:09.360]  A lot of hurdles to jump on that issue and I'm sure you've heard, uh, my Obama deception
[1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:16.720]  ad airing on rush limbo and, uh, Ted Anderson is doing that as an investment.
[1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:17.720]  He told me the numbers.
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:20.520]  He's actually losing money doing it, but that's what Ted does.
[1:28:20.520 --> 1:28:24.600]  He spent a hundred and something grand flying airplanes around with Ron Paul banners on
[1:28:24.600 --> 1:28:25.600]  it.
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:30.000]  You got about 30 grand of donations and spent about a hundred above that on Ron Paul airplanes
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:33.360]  and people can say, Oh, well, it didn't affect change.
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:34.360]  He failed.
[1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:38.080]  No, people are waking up to Liberty and knowing there's an alternative to the control left
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:39.280]  or controlled right.
[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:44.280]  And so I'm basically selling the Obama deception to Ted at cost and he is running ads on rush
[1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:45.280]  limbo.
[1:28:45.280 --> 1:28:51.320]  Sean Anthony, all of them, uh, he got a very good deal because radio is in a lot of trouble
[1:28:51.320 --> 1:28:54.520]  right now because the rest of the economy is, uh, Ted looked into this about a year
[1:28:54.520 --> 1:28:57.320]  ago and the price is about half what it was then.
[1:28:57.320 --> 1:29:00.200]  And so people are calling me going, what's this, you're in legal rush limbo.
[1:29:00.200 --> 1:29:02.160]  Uh, no, no, it's what Tom Harper was saying.
[1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:04.040]  We are in fill trading.
[1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:10.120]  Can you imagine all of the, um, big line Republicans turn into rush limbo.
[1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:15.920]  They hear a film exposing Barack Obama and what they get is a film exposing Barack Obama
[1:29:15.920 --> 1:29:19.920]  and the big banks and the Republicans and the whole stinking system.
[1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:21.000]  So it's a beautiful thing.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:25.040]  And so that's what your support of, uh, Ted Anderson and the work he's doing is causing
[1:29:25.040 --> 1:29:26.040]  as well.
[1:29:26.040 --> 1:29:27.040]  Why is my shirt off?
[1:29:27.040 --> 1:29:32.880]  Well, because I'm literally almost shirtless right now, um, from the taxes I pay.
[1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:36.080]  I know it's a fraud to the federal reserve, but I'm not going to fight that battle.
[1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:39.560]  If I did that, they would come arrest me, put me in prison, selectively enforce on
[1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:40.560]  me.
[1:29:40.560 --> 1:29:44.440]  So I pay the mafia, the money, the private banks so I can stay on the air and expose
[1:29:44.440 --> 1:29:45.880]  these criminals for what they are.
[1:29:45.880 --> 1:29:47.360]  So I am shirtless.
[1:29:47.360 --> 1:29:48.680]  Somebody buy me a shirt.
[1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:49.680]  Help me.
[1:29:49.680 --> 1:29:50.680]  Come on.
[1:29:50.680 --> 1:29:51.680]  I'm in trouble.
[1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:52.760]  We're on the march.
[1:29:52.760 --> 1:29:55.200]  The empire's on the run.

[1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:06.840]  In the New World Order's war against humanity Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:31:06.840 --> 1:31:13.440]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful just as strong
[1:31:13.440 --> 1:31:15.000]  just as well funded.
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:20.160]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:31:20.160 --> 1:31:21.160]  of the American people.
[1:31:21.160 --> 1:31:25.640]  Well Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:31:25.640 --> 1:31:31.120]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:31:31.120 --> 1:31:37.640]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:31:37.640 --> 1:31:41.200]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[1:31:41.200 --> 1:31:48.120]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:31:56.320 --> 1:32:01.000]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:03.480]  Hi this is Peter Cronchnub with Midas Resources.
[1:32:03.480 --> 1:32:07.320]  As you know government spending is at an all time high and inflation is on the rise.
[1:32:07.320 --> 1:32:10.080]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[1:32:10.080 --> 1:32:14.160]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention
[1:32:14.160 --> 1:32:17.560]  more people will lose their jobs and worse their life savings.
[1:32:17.560 --> 1:32:21.280]  Using your hard earned money in banks, the stock market, or any other paper asset is
[1:32:21.280 --> 1:32:22.520]  a lose lose deal.
[1:32:22.520 --> 1:32:26.200]  You'll lose on your capital investment and you'll lose purchasing power as the dollar
[1:32:26.200 --> 1:32:27.640]  continues to devalue.
[1:32:27.640 --> 1:32:31.160]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no
[1:32:31.160 --> 1:32:33.840]  matter what happens your investment will never be worthless.
[1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:37.280]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals
[1:32:37.280 --> 1:32:38.280]  I can help.
[1:32:38.280 --> 1:32:45.160]  Call me today, Peter Cronchnub at 800-686-2237 extension 108 and I will take the time personally
[1:32:45.160 --> 1:32:48.920]  to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[1:32:48.920 --> 1:32:53.360]  Call Peter 800-686-2237 extension 108.
[1:32:53.360 --> 1:32:56.000]  You've worked hard your whole life and I want to work hard for you.
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:33:16.200]  Call 800-686-2237 extension 108.
[1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:54.120]  $12 plus trillion dollars for the bankers and then a few hundred billion for the people.
[1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:57.880]  And then with that hundred billion, 200 billion or so that go to the people, there's all these
[1:33:57.880 --> 1:34:01.960]  strings attached to it and all this expanding federal control.
[1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:02.960]  Here we go.
[1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:03.960]  Back with Tom Hartman.
[1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:11.280]  34 minutes past the hour, Tom Hartman here with you and we're simulcasting with Alex Jones.
[1:34:11.280 --> 1:34:13.020]  I am the notorious liberal.
[1:34:13.020 --> 1:34:14.520]  He is the paleo-conservative.
[1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:15.520]  Alex, you're here?
[1:34:15.520 --> 1:34:16.520]  Yes, I am.
[1:34:16.520 --> 1:34:17.920]  It's good to be here with you.
[1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:18.920]  Very exciting.
[1:34:18.920 --> 1:34:19.920]  Let's go to some of your phone calls.
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:20.920]  Okay.
[1:34:20.920 --> 1:34:21.920]  We'll pick up.
[1:34:21.920 --> 1:34:23.480]  We'll alternate them.
[1:34:23.480 --> 1:34:25.520]  By the way, your phone number for your callers?
[1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:27.920]  Oh, I hadn't thought to take calls while we're doing this.
[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:37.760]  Sure, it's 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231 and I will go ahead and punch up my call screen.
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:38.760]  Okay, great.
[1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:42.680]  And people will take some of my calls, we'll take some of your calls, we'll see what happens
[1:34:42.680 --> 1:34:43.680]  here.
[1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:47.320]  Yeah, Tom, this is really fun and I appreciate you plugging the Obama deception.
[1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:52.320]  I hope folks will get the DVD at infowars.com, they're authorized to make copies of it and
[1:34:52.320 --> 1:34:56.200]  give it to people because after the IRS check I just signed, because they've gotten rid
[1:34:56.200 --> 1:35:01.400]  of so many of the loopholes and things, even for business and the depreciation schedule,
[1:35:01.400 --> 1:35:04.920]  that I'm basically broke right now, so I hope folks will go to infowars.com.
[1:35:04.920 --> 1:35:08.200]  I'm sure you had fun just paying the private fellow reserve, plug some of your stuff.
[1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:09.200]  Plug your book.
[1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:10.200]  Yeah, Alex.
[1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:15.000]  Yeah, you know, I got nothing to plug here, I mean, I showed you, I got some books.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  I'm taking a shirt.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  My shirt.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  But let me just...
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  You want another one here?
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  Take my watch.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:26.320]  Alex, I am pleased to pay taxes and because I consider taxes to be the price of admission
[1:35:26.320 --> 1:35:30.520]  in a civil society, I want there to be police who are protecting my home, I want the fire
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:33.880]  department to show up, I think that we need to have a good public education system, I'd
[1:35:33.880 --> 1:35:37.720]  like to have a good national healthcare system, I'm sick and tired of seeing people like Bill
[1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:40.760]  McGuire take a billion dollar paycheck from the healthcare...
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:45.280]  Yeah, most of the money goes to corporate welfare, that's what the rights got wrong,
[1:35:45.280 --> 1:35:49.160]  they think corporations are perfect and have done no wrong, meanwhile it's all corporate
[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:53.000]  welfare, 30 to 1, and the 1%, I mean, cities are...
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:57.400]  Well, you're absolutely right, you're absolutely right, you're singing my song, but my point
[1:35:57.400 --> 1:35:59.600]  is that that's...
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:05.520]  The taxes aren't the issue, but let's pick up some phone calls here and see what Rita
[1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:08.240]  in Los Angeles is doing, K-Talk and L.A., hey Rita.
[1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:14.200]  Yes, I'm so encouraged at the primal cast because I've been saying for years that the
[1:36:14.200 --> 1:36:19.720]  right puts out the truth so the left won't touch it on certain listener-sponsor radio
[1:36:19.720 --> 1:36:26.440]  stations, and there's power numbers, and if there's a coalition like what you two are
[1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:31.800]  doing right now, I think the people's movement has a much better chance of bringing strength
[1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:37.320]  into effecting the decisions made in Washington, and I would like to request that the two of
[1:36:37.320 --> 1:36:42.400]  you do a regular simulcast if you could fit it into your schedules, just like Tom, you
[1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:43.400]  do brunch with Bernie.
[1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:45.760]  Yeah, okay, Rita, thank you very much.
[1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:47.120]  We have Senator Sanders on every week.
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:51.240]  Alex, let me just say, you said thank you for endorsing the Obama deception.
[1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:53.880]  I'm not endorsing the Obama deception, but I want to make it clear.
[1:36:53.880 --> 1:36:54.880]  No, I said thank you for plugging it.
[1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:55.880]  Thank you for plugging it.
[1:36:55.880 --> 1:36:56.880]  Oh, plugging it.
[1:36:56.880 --> 1:37:00.760]  Okay, because I think that there are some great things in there, and I do agree with
[1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:07.120]  you that people should watch it, although when you get to your conclusion, and I'm not
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:11.200]  going to go through them one by one, but there are a bunch of areas where I think that we
[1:37:11.200 --> 1:37:13.600]  could have a very interesting discussion about our disagreements.
[1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:16.160]  You have any calls there that you want to, you got a call or you want to toss up or shall
[1:37:16.160 --> 1:37:17.160]  I put them on here?
[1:37:17.160 --> 1:37:19.720]  We always have unlimited phone calls, but I'm down here in Texas.
[1:37:19.720 --> 1:37:24.320]  They're up in Minnesota, and I just, well, no, no, I just asked the guy for calls.
[1:37:24.320 --> 1:37:27.040]  I just opened it up, and so they're giving me calls right now.
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:28.040]  Go ahead and go to your next call.
[1:37:28.040 --> 1:37:29.040]  All righty.
[1:37:29.040 --> 1:37:30.040]  Anthony in Anaheim, California.
[1:37:30.040 --> 1:37:31.040]  Hey, Anthony.
[1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:32.040]  Hey, Tom.
[1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:33.040]  Hey, Alex.
[1:37:33.040 --> 1:37:38.800]  I don't have so much of a question as I wanted to, first of all, state my appreciation
[1:37:38.800 --> 1:37:44.360]  for you having us both of you, Tom, I listened to you for the past about four years, religiously
[1:37:44.360 --> 1:37:49.200]  every day, and Alex said I was part of the Tea Party, the movement, I was part of the
[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:52.520]  Money Bomb with Ron Paul, and I go to your website.
[1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:56.800]  Yes, really, Ron Paul who started this thing, the Tea Parties, in the modern incarnation.
[1:37:56.800 --> 1:38:01.080]  And then now, well, first it was started by 9-11 Truth, then Ron Paul picked up on it,
[1:38:01.080 --> 1:38:08.000]  and now Sean Hannity and Becky Poo and these corporate minions have hijacked it, but by
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:13.040]  the way, I've been at Willie Nelson's house while he's had you on in the, no, no, while
[1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:15.440]  he's had you on in the background listening to you.
[1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:18.200]  One time I showed up at Willie's house and he had you on in the background, I just want
[1:38:18.200 --> 1:38:19.200]  to say that.
[1:38:19.200 --> 1:38:20.200]  That's great.
[1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:21.200]  It's awesome.
[1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:22.200]  One of my heroes.
[1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:23.200]  I love Willie Nelson.
[1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:24.200]  He's amazing.
[1:38:24.200 --> 1:38:27.960]  Okay, Brian in North, in Fort Lauderdale, excuse me, Brian, you're on with Alex Jones
[1:38:27.960 --> 1:38:31.600]  and me, prismplanet.com, infowars.com, tomharpon.com.
[1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:35.200]  Tom, thank you so much for taking my phone call.
[1:38:35.200 --> 1:38:39.640]  Yeah, I think it's great that you guys are doing this simulcast.
[1:38:39.640 --> 1:38:43.520]  Yeah, it's a good team that neither one of us is ever going to get a national TV show.
[1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:44.520]  That's what it's about.
[1:38:44.520 --> 1:38:45.520]  That's true.
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:49.680]  Yeah, I listen to both of you on a regular basis.
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:54.640]  I wanted to say something to Alex, because I can never get into his show.
[1:38:54.640 --> 1:38:58.920]  See, Alex, I think your show is great.
[1:38:58.920 --> 1:39:01.120]  I really enjoyed listening to you.
[1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:08.160]  I agree with a lot that you talk about, but one problem that I have is that you use a
[1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:17.800]  lot of sensationalism and fear hype to, I don't know, kind of promote your show or yourself.
[1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:26.040]  I don't know what it is, but one example is your claim of how the New World Order is going
[1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:36.680]  to eliminate 80% of the world population, and you cite Bill Joyce's article on why the
[1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:38.240]  future doesn't need us.
[1:39:38.240 --> 1:39:46.160]  Well, I saw a bunch of articles, I've read that article numerous times, don't see any
[1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:47.680]  mention of anything like that.
[1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:52.520]  I just wish you would back some of your claims up better.
[1:39:52.520 --> 1:40:00.440]  Alex, you're suggesting that there's a plot to eliminate 80% of the world population?
[1:40:00.440 --> 1:40:01.920]  Yeah, let me comment on this.
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:06.560]  My film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslaviment, has all the quotes.
[1:40:06.560 --> 1:40:12.560]  He takes out of context one thing I mentioned as evidence of the elite saying that they're
[1:40:12.560 --> 1:40:16.680]  having discussions about should they go ahead and just get rid of all of us because they
[1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:20.320]  don't need us anymore because of robotics and systems like that.
[1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:22.120]  So that's what I was talking about there.
[1:40:22.120 --> 1:40:28.680]  Now, State Department Memorandum under Richard Nixon with Henry Kissinger says we'll use
[1:40:28.680 --> 1:40:33.160]  State Department Memorandum 200, we'll use IMF and World Bank money to make India and
[1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:36.960]  Peru and others sterilize half their women, or they don't get money.
[1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:37.960]  That's on record.
[1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:40.880]  Then the 1996 UN Biological Diversity Service...
[1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:44.640]  But hang on just a second, Alex, let's assume that all that's true.
[1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:46.200]  They're working against their own best interests.
[1:40:46.200 --> 1:40:48.440]  You know what happened after the Black Plague in Europe?
[1:40:48.440 --> 1:40:49.440]  Was the Renaissance?
[1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:50.440]  The Renaissance, yeah.
[1:40:50.440 --> 1:40:55.640]  It created a middle class because when you reduce the size of the labor force, you drive
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:40:56.640]  up the cost of labor.
[1:40:56.640 --> 1:41:00.280]  They didn't have robotics and robotic fleets and the whole military is converting over
[1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:02.040]  to robotic tanks and aircraft.
[1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:03.040]  They don't even need the soldiers.
[1:41:03.040 --> 1:41:04.040]  It's not enough.
[1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:09.520]  Let me toss out an alternative conspiracy theory and that is that the anti-birth control
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:16.440]  movement around the world is part of the keep us all enslaved by jerking up the population
[1:41:16.440 --> 1:41:17.440]  to the point where...
[1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:20.560]  Tom, you're absolutely right, but it's more sophisticated.
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:23.480]  And I understand with an audience here, we've got to not dumb it down, but simplify it for
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:24.480]  time.
[1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:25.480]  Okay?
[1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:26.480]  But, okay, yes, you're right.
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:33.920]  If you read the British Royal Commission on Population Commission, 1944 to 49, a five-year
[1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:37.040]  study commissioned by the British government, they say that.
[1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:43.800]  They say, we want to stop birth control in the third world so that they use up all their
[1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:47.560]  resources and don't industrialize to threaten us.
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:50.200]  And that was one school of thought that was done.
[1:41:50.200 --> 1:41:55.560]  Then you have another eugenicist school of thought which is hyper-dynamic and it's the
[1:41:55.560 --> 1:41:56.560]  most powerful.
[1:41:56.560 --> 1:41:57.560]  Maybe they'll cancel each other out.
[1:41:57.560 --> 1:42:01.840]  No, that's basically what's happening and it's causing needless destruction.
[1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:02.840]  But no, you're right.
[1:42:02.840 --> 1:42:04.720]  There is actually a conspiracy.
[1:42:04.720 --> 1:42:11.320]  We conspired to do this simulcast, so conspiring is just people talking and two people planning
[1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:12.320]  something.
[1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:18.400]  So, look, Dr. Eric Pionka, UT, says he wants 90% of us to die and the issue is he gets
[1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:19.400]  standing ovations.
[1:42:19.400 --> 1:42:24.000]  This has been on the news when he says he can't wait for 90% of us to die.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:31.200]  So my whole issue is that there is a dominant idea of eugenics that metastasize into crypto
[1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:37.160]  eugenics of World War II that is the dominant system in scientific thought in our society
[1:42:37.160 --> 1:42:41.000]  that humans are parasites and bad and we need to get rid of the humans and then that gives
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:46.600]  us the globalist that the head of the CFR wrote in 1991 for the club of Rome, Richard
[1:42:46.600 --> 1:42:47.600]  N. Haas.
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:51.920]  He said, we're going to use fake terrorism as one pincer to control the public and fake
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:53.440]  environmentalism as the other.
[1:42:53.440 --> 1:42:58.200]  Am I saying there isn't fish die-offs, the trees being cut down, toxic waste dumping,
[1:42:58.200 --> 1:42:59.200]  real environmental?
[1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:00.440]  I think you're pushing the edges here, Alex.
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:07.360]  I think you're pushing the edges, but like I said, on both sides, let's move along here.
[1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:11.080]  Scott, in Portland, you've got to say something to us.
[1:43:11.080 --> 1:43:12.080]  Yes, I do.
[1:43:12.080 --> 1:43:20.080]  As a matter of fact, taxes basically are a rent on our infrastructure.
[1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:23.080]  Without our infrastructure, none of those rich people would have made...
[1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:24.640]  You don't even listen to my point.
[1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:28.960]  My point is, is that it doesn't go to infrastructure because criminal elites like in the Soviet
[1:43:28.960 --> 1:43:34.320]  Union and in the United States always come in and get control of it and they're destroying
[1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:35.320]  our infrastructure.
[1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:38.720]  They're paying tax incentives to move offshore that both parties support.
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:41.920]  By the way, I've got loaded phones if you want me to go to some to go in.
[1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:42.920]  Sure, yeah.
[1:43:42.920 --> 1:43:46.960]  Well, let me just put a punctuation mark on that.
[1:43:46.960 --> 1:43:49.560]  That is that we have...
[1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:52.680]  This is why don't the rich pay their share.
[1:43:52.680 --> 1:44:01.200]  In 1955, the top 400 Americans in the U.S. paid three times as much income tax as they
[1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:02.720]  are today.
[1:44:02.720 --> 1:44:05.760]  If they were paying the same tax they paid in 1955, which by the way, was a period of
[1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:09.800]  great stability, we would have an additional $35.9 billion.
[1:44:09.800 --> 1:44:16.120]  If everybody who made over $2 million in the U.S., which was the 91% tax rate back then,
[1:44:16.120 --> 1:44:22.520]  if they were paying a comparable income tax rate, which would be 49% in 1955 actually
[1:44:22.520 --> 1:44:26.880]  after deductions, right now they're paying 23%, we would have collected an additional
[1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:28.040]  $200 billion.
[1:44:28.040 --> 1:44:30.040]  That seems like a good thing if our government is using it...
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:31.040]  Yeah, let me make that point.
[1:44:31.040 --> 1:44:34.600]  That's a bad thing if our government is using it to bail out bankrupt banks.
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:37.440]  Yeah, but I mean, exactly, here's my point.
[1:44:37.440 --> 1:44:41.120]  Is the big bankers come in, they lobby for higher taxes on the middle class and the working
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:45.200]  class, they then take our money and bail out for themselves and give themselves bonuses.
[1:44:45.200 --> 1:44:46.200]  That's how this works.
[1:44:46.200 --> 1:44:51.160]  And if you study it, as you know, if you make about $1 million a year or $200,000, $300,000
[1:44:51.160 --> 1:44:56.200]  a year, you're paying about 35%, 40% because the deductions, you can't count them now.
[1:44:56.200 --> 1:44:58.920]  But as soon as you start making $5,000,000, $10,000,000, $20,000,000 a year, you drop
[1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:02.320]  down to 20%, then you've got all these lawyers and firms.
[1:45:02.320 --> 1:45:03.320]  And what...
[1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:05.400]  I know, this is why I say, roll back the Reagan tax cuts.
[1:45:05.400 --> 1:45:07.000]  Well, I mean, what did Bush do?
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  As you know, he took almost all the FBI off the billionaires and put them on blue collar.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:19.560]  I know, it's nuts, and here we are, the Paleo-Conservative and the Paleo-Liberal, Alex Jones and Tom
[1:45:19.560 --> 1:45:26.240]  Harman, simulcasting, prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, tomharman.com, Alex, we've got to take a break.
[1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:29.640]  We'll be right back.
[1:45:29.640 --> 1:45:34.880]  Did you know that the new energy czar wants to control how much power your magical company
[1:45:34.880 --> 1:45:36.480]  allows you to have?
[1:45:36.480 --> 1:45:43.080]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:44.080]  Not if, but when.
[1:45:44.080 --> 1:45:49.400]  Hi Bill, I just wanted to call in and let you folks know that I got my solar backup generator
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:50.400]  hooked up and running.
[1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:52.400]  To tell you the truth, it's awesome.
[1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:57.240]  Not only was it easy to install, but it's powering my fridge, lights, TV and shortwave
[1:45:57.240 --> 1:45:58.240]  radio.
[1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:01.280]  I now know that I'm one step closer to getting off the grid.
[1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:02.400]  Thanks for all your help.
[1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:07.200]  This generator is solar powered, complete with battery backup, has no moving parts to wear
[1:46:07.200 --> 1:46:09.720]  out or break and requires no gas.
[1:46:09.720 --> 1:46:13.720]  Don't wait for the energy czar to cut your power or raise your rates.
[1:46:13.720 --> 1:46:16.160]  Produce your own electricity for free.
[1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:18.600]  Go to mysolarbackup.com.
[1:46:18.600 --> 1:46:21.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:30.320]  Or call 877-327-0365-877-327-0365.
[1:46:30.320 --> 1:46:36.400]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:40.920]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[1:46:40.920 --> 1:46:42.240]  us would like to see.
[1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:47.360]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:46:47.360 --> 1:46:48.760]  of the American people.
[1:46:48.760 --> 1:46:53.120]  Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:58.240]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:46:58.240 --> 1:47:06.360]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:47:06.360 --> 1:47:09.920]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[1:47:09.920 --> 1:47:16.840]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:25.040]  Find your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[1:47:25.040 --> 1:47:30.160]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:47:30.160 --> 1:47:32.000]  Are you embarrassed by your legs?
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:34.240]  Are your legs sore and irritated?
[1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:37.480]  Millions of women suffer from leg pain due to varicose veins.
[1:47:37.480 --> 1:47:41.400]  When varicose veins prevent you from living and enjoying your everyday life, you need
[1:47:41.400 --> 1:47:42.400]  vaniolux.

[1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:51.000]  OK, for our AM and FM affiliates, you need to know that we do these simulcasts, I've
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:58.240]  done it with press TV and British radio and TV and other radio shows, syndicated radio
[1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:02.840]  shows, it was Tom Hartman's idea to do this, I appreciate him having us on the show, we're
[1:49:02.840 --> 1:49:06.480]  going to be rejoining them here in about a minute.
[1:49:06.480 --> 1:49:14.600]  And then in the next hour, we're going to be talking about the oath keepers, police
[1:49:14.600 --> 1:49:17.920]  and military saying they won't confiscate guns, they won't violate the Bill of Rights
[1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:23.560]  and Constitution and that goes into the context of all these government databases and government
[1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:27.480]  reports demonizing gun owners saying we're the number one threat to the country and are
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:28.920]  basically terrorist.
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:32.880]  So that is coming up and then later in the last hour, our crew is down in San Antonio
[1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:36.800]  with a tea party that's going to be starting right as the show's ending so they'll be able
[1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:41.720]  to tell you what's happening down there with a report from that one that Glenn Beck is
[1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:42.920]  going to be at.
[1:49:42.920 --> 1:49:49.000]  I've got a bunch of other important news here as well that I'll be covering next hour and
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  I know we've got callers, Adrian in North Carolina, Dave, Helen, Jeremy, Danny and others.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:06.240]  So we're going to go ahead and welcome back to the Tom Hartman radio program and Simon
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:11.800]  Casting with the Alex Jones radio show and Alex Jones and I, Alex, your turn to pick
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:12.800]  a caller.
[1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:13.800]  Absolutely.
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:14.800]  Let's do it.
[1:50:14.800 --> 1:50:15.800]  Let's take a couple of them.
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:18.520]  Adrian in North Carolina, you're on the air with Tom Hartman.
[1:50:18.520 --> 1:50:19.520]  Go ahead.
[1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:20.520]  And Alex Jones.
[1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:21.520]  Hey, Alex.
[1:50:21.520 --> 1:50:22.520]  Hey, how you doing?
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:23.520]  I'm doing great.
[1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:29.040]  All I called in about was today is, of course, the tea party that a lot of us are having
[1:50:29.040 --> 1:50:30.040]  in our capitals.
[1:50:30.040 --> 1:50:31.040]  We live in Raleigh, North Carolina.
[1:50:31.040 --> 1:50:37.320]  So we'll be participating in our tea party here starting at 6.30 p.m. and we have copied
[1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:43.120]  off your copies, actually our copies of your film, The Obama Deception, as you said publicly
[1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:44.120]  we could do.
[1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:45.120]  Yes.
[1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:50.320]  We will be handing that out to as many people who would like to have it, we're also going
[1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:51.440]  to be videoing it.
[1:50:51.440 --> 1:50:54.160]  So, I just wanted to say thank you, and we are...
[1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:55.160]  Absolutely.
[1:50:55.160 --> 1:50:57.800]  And for Tom, I mean, just for Tom, real fast, I'll let you finish.
[1:50:57.800 --> 1:50:58.960]  I appreciate your calling.
[1:50:58.960 --> 1:51:03.000]  See, The Obama Deception, as you know, Tom, exposes the left and the right, tries to shatter
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  that paradigm.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  And so, we go...
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  I understand.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  I understand.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  Yeah, I know.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  I saw it.
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  In fact, I've been advocating.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  I've been for three days.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:13.960]  I've been telling my listeners, Alex, go to the tea parties.
[1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:18.860]  I've got a piece on Common Dreams today.org, for example, that says, you know, the original
[1:51:18.860 --> 1:51:21.960]  tea party was a revolt against the British East India Company.
[1:51:21.960 --> 1:51:27.400]  It was a revolt against the world's largest corporation, getting a massive tax break.
[1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:28.520]  Global corporate crime scenario.
[1:51:28.520 --> 1:51:29.520]  That's right.
[1:51:29.520 --> 1:51:30.520]  That's exactly what it was.
[1:51:30.520 --> 1:51:31.880]  The original tea party was against global...
[1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:35.520]  And so, I'm telling my listeners to go to these tea parties and hold up signs that
[1:51:35.520 --> 1:51:39.640]  say things like, get us out of the WTO, get us out of NAFTA.
[1:51:39.640 --> 1:51:41.160]  I mean, these are things that...
[1:51:41.160 --> 1:51:43.600]  Yeah, but what you're going to find, what you're going to find is...
[1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:44.600]  Tax the rich.
[1:51:44.600 --> 1:51:45.600]  Tax the rich.
[1:51:45.600 --> 1:51:46.600]  Tax the corporations.
[1:51:46.600 --> 1:51:49.680]  They're going to come, leftists are going to show up with these signs, and they're going
[1:51:49.680 --> 1:51:53.000]  to find they agree with, quote, Republicans about ending NAFTA and GATT.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:54.480]  Oh, that's my point.
[1:51:54.480 --> 1:51:55.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:51:55.480 --> 1:52:00.720]  I think that actually, as Americans, Alex, who believe in the Constitution and the Bill
[1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:03.760]  of Rights, there's more that unites us than divides us.
[1:52:03.760 --> 1:52:05.440]  I agree, and that's what Fox News wants.
[1:52:05.440 --> 1:52:09.880]  They want to make it a phony, neocon, mainline, right-wing movement.
[1:52:09.880 --> 1:52:13.960]  Just like in the 80s, they took over Christian conservatives, they've written that horse
[1:52:13.960 --> 1:52:14.960]  to death now.
[1:52:14.960 --> 1:52:15.960]  Well, it's not just Fox News.
[1:52:15.960 --> 1:52:18.520]  I think the corporate media right across the board is playing into this.
[1:52:18.520 --> 1:52:23.720]  Well, they're trying to jump on the Ron Paul, Alex Jones horse, and it's not going to work.
[1:52:23.720 --> 1:52:29.800]  And again, I will say this, at least the left, people like Oberman, are admitting that Obama
[1:52:29.800 --> 1:52:33.320]  is worse than Bush on many things like civil liberties, which I thought was impossible.
[1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:38.320]  Yeah, I absolutely honor Keith Oberman and Rachel Maddow, but both call him out of it.
[1:52:38.320 --> 1:52:39.320]  Yeah, but the Republicans wouldn't do that.
[1:52:39.320 --> 1:52:40.320]  The Republicans wouldn't do that.
[1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:41.320]  No, they would never do that with Bush.
[1:52:41.320 --> 1:52:42.320]  Oh, no, but Bush has done no...
[1:52:42.320 --> 1:52:43.320]  Not until after he's long gone.
[1:52:43.320 --> 1:52:45.120]  Oh, he's perfect.
[1:52:45.120 --> 1:52:47.400]  So we pick up another caller from my end or from your end, Alex?
[1:52:47.400 --> 1:52:49.320]  Let's take one from my end, because we've already taken some there.
[1:52:49.320 --> 1:52:50.320]  A real fast, though.
[1:52:50.320 --> 1:52:51.320]  Dave in California.
[1:52:51.320 --> 1:52:52.820]  Dave, you're on the air with Tom Hartman.
[1:52:52.820 --> 1:52:53.820]  Go ahead.
[1:52:53.820 --> 1:52:54.820]  Hi, Alex.
[1:52:54.820 --> 1:52:57.320]  You're the best guest on George Norris' show, by the way.
[1:52:57.320 --> 1:53:03.920]  I do want to say chemtrails are being ignored, and it's ridiculous to discuss global warming
[1:53:03.920 --> 1:53:06.160]  when you don't mention chemtrails.
[1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:07.160]  Thanks a lot.
[1:53:07.160 --> 1:53:08.160]  Oh, yeah, Tom.
[1:53:08.160 --> 1:53:10.760]  Did you know that we discovered thousands of declassified government documents?
[1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:15.080]  They call it testing, where they are adding to the jet fuel, barium salts, and other things
[1:53:15.080 --> 1:53:20.720]  – and aluminum dioxide – that is spraying the atmosphere, and now Obama's come out
[1:53:20.720 --> 1:53:24.680]  and said, you know what, we need to go ahead and think about doing this, and then he cites
[1:53:24.680 --> 1:53:29.280]  the Council on Foreign Relations playbook that calls for terraforming the planet to
[1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:33.840]  save us from global warming when this spraying actually shows it'll heat the earth.
[1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:39.000]  Yeah, I know that there have been some pretty crazy suggestions about how to, you know,
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:42.440]  that, and let's seed the oceans with iron and things like that, but...
[1:53:42.440 --> 1:53:43.440]  They tried that, yeah.
[1:53:43.440 --> 1:53:44.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:53:44.440 --> 1:53:45.440]  I'll take one of your calls.
[1:53:45.440 --> 1:53:46.440]  Okay.
[1:53:46.440 --> 1:53:47.440]  Kevin and Pittsburgh.
[1:53:47.440 --> 1:53:48.440]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[1:53:48.440 --> 1:53:49.440]  Yeah, hi.
[1:53:49.440 --> 1:53:50.440]  I had a couple questions for Alex.
[1:53:50.440 --> 1:53:53.440]  He talks about how the government wants to kill 80% of us.
[1:53:53.440 --> 1:53:54.440]  Oh, boy.
[1:53:54.440 --> 1:53:56.280]  They call it 9-11.
[1:53:56.280 --> 1:53:58.560]  They want to microchip us.
[1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:01.920]  If we go out and do anything, they're going to put us in FEMA camps.
[1:54:01.920 --> 1:54:04.160]  That's not what I'm saying.
[1:54:04.160 --> 1:54:08.640]  And then, but anytime someone calls up and asks, Alex, well, why do you even want small
[1:54:08.640 --> 1:54:09.640]  government?
[1:54:09.640 --> 1:54:11.320]  Why don't you push for no government?
[1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:16.360]  He's the first one to defend government and he'll tell us how much we still need government.
[1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:23.040]  So the funniest thing is after you hear Alex complain about government for months and months,
[1:54:23.040 --> 1:54:24.920]  you ask him, well, how about no government?
[1:54:24.920 --> 1:54:28.440]  He's the first one to defend it and tell us how great it is.
[1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:29.440]  Well, sir.
[1:54:29.440 --> 1:54:30.440]  I mean...
[1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:31.440]  Kevin, thank you.
[1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:32.440]  Wow.
[1:54:32.440 --> 1:54:37.200]  I mean, look, such a thing as pure anarchy doesn't exist in groups of bigger than...
[1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:39.440]  I mean, go with your buddies camping for a week.
[1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:40.440]  No.
[1:54:40.440 --> 1:54:41.440]  No.
[1:54:41.440 --> 1:54:46.440]  And communism doesn't work in groups smaller than 150 people and libertarianism has never
[1:54:46.440 --> 1:54:48.160]  succeeded anywhere in the world.
[1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:49.960]  So there's got to be some middle ground.
[1:54:49.960 --> 1:54:56.000]  I think we should move more towards smaller government, more liberty, but that make individuals
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:59.120]  have to be involved in their communities to have liberty.
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:00.120]  Yes.
[1:55:00.120 --> 1:55:01.520]  So I want people to be self-sufficient.
[1:55:01.520 --> 1:55:06.120]  I want people to have local control and I do want to reduce the size of government because
[1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:09.640]  corporations come in and use the big government to suck off of us.
[1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:10.640]  Well, here's the problem.
[1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:11.640]  How do we get the corporation...
[1:55:11.640 --> 1:55:16.080]  I take this back to a couple of Supreme Court rulings all the way back to 1886, Santa Clara
[1:55:16.080 --> 1:55:17.600]  County versus Southern Pacific Railroad.
[1:55:17.600 --> 1:55:21.080]  I wrote a whole book about that called Unequal Protection and it's in several of my other
[1:55:21.080 --> 1:55:24.320]  books, We the People and What Would Jefferson Do.
[1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:27.840]  And then there have been several...
[1:55:27.840 --> 1:55:32.880]  First Bank of Boston versus Bellotti and others that have said that free speeches, money,
[1:55:32.880 --> 1:55:34.640]  and corporations are the same as persons.
[1:55:34.640 --> 1:55:39.240]  I mean, we've got to change the definition of corporations in this country, Alex.
[1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:40.920]  And get them out of the political arena.
[1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:41.920]  Yeah.
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:43.080]  I mean, absolutely.
[1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:46.640]  These corporations come in all these crimes and then they're supposedly immune or the
[1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:49.200]  people that are standing behind the corporations are immune.
[1:55:49.200 --> 1:55:50.200]  We certainly...
[1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:53.600]  Or like Halliburton, they moved to the UAE or Dubai.
[1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:58.080]  Well Halliburton was involved helping giving weapons systems to Iran, but suddenly the
[1:55:58.080 --> 1:55:59.480]  fake conservatives don't care.
[1:55:59.480 --> 1:56:02.400]  In fact, where is Rush Limbaugh on the bailouts?
[1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:05.840]  He's actually for the bonuses calling that free market.
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:12.080]  It's not free market to have a bunch of pirates running your government, feeding the public
[1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:14.360]  trough down their gullets.
[1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:19.920]  Again, look at how Obama is in agreement with Rush Limbaugh when it comes to the bailouts
[1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:21.760]  and the bonuses and all of this.
[1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:23.040]  They're all on one team.
[1:56:23.040 --> 1:56:27.520]  Why did Obama get four times the corporate Wall Street things that McCain got?
[1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:29.960]  But let's just be honest about this, Alex.
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:31.560]  It's not just Obama.
[1:56:31.560 --> 1:56:35.720]  All your charges against Obama can just as easily be made against James Inhofe.
[1:56:35.720 --> 1:56:36.720]  I agree.
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:41.000]  That's what I'm saying is, let's get past the two puppets they've got in front of us
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:42.920]  and let's look at who's controlling the puppets.
[1:56:42.920 --> 1:56:44.680]  I want to talk about the New World Order.
[1:56:44.680 --> 1:56:48.360]  That's what infowars.com covers and plug your website, tomhartman.com.
[1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:49.360]  Yeah.
[1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:50.360]  Yeah.
[1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:51.880]  All my books are there and our show is there.
[1:56:51.880 --> 1:56:54.360]  We got about 15 seconds here by the way before we had the wrap up.
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:55.360]  Tom, thanks for having me on.
[1:56:55.360 --> 1:56:56.360]  It was great having you here.
[1:56:56.360 --> 1:57:02.960]  Alex, it's been fascinating and again, I find your Obama deception video, as I said,
[1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:06.080]  probably about a third of it are things that I strongly disagree with, but I think that
[1:57:06.080 --> 1:57:08.600]  it raises a lot of issues that we all need to be talking about.
[1:57:08.600 --> 1:57:09.600]  Well, it's free on the web.
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:12.920]  Google the Obama deception or go to infowars.com or tomhartman.com.
[1:57:12.920 --> 1:57:14.160]  You can link up to it, Tom.
[1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:15.160]  There you go.
[1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:16.160]  And we will with today's talk.
[1:57:16.160 --> 1:57:17.920]  Tom, let's do this a couple times a year.
[1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:18.920]  Take care, buddy.
[1:57:18.920 --> 1:57:19.920]  It would be a lot of fun, Alex.
[1:57:19.920 --> 1:57:20.920]  Good talking with you.
[1:57:20.920 --> 1:57:21.920]  Thanks for being on.
[1:57:21.920 --> 1:57:22.920]  Alex Jones.
[1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:23.920]  Alex Jones.
[1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:24.920]  infowars.com.
[1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:25.920]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[1:57:25.920 --> 1:57:26.920]  Tom Hartman.com.
[1:57:26.920 --> 1:57:27.920]  We're back with the FireSign Theater.
[1:57:27.920 --> 1:57:29.920]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:32.200]  We're going to go to break here in just a moment.
[1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:33.200]  That was crazy.
[1:57:33.200 --> 1:57:34.200]  Okay.
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:37.800]  I want to go to Jimmy, Danny, Helen, and Joshua.
[1:57:37.800 --> 1:57:38.800]  We're going to come back.
[1:57:38.800 --> 1:57:42.360]  We're going to do five minutes, take a few, two or three of your calls, and then I am
[1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:46.480]  going to go to our next guest in a bunch of news we haven't even gotten to yet, big new
[1:57:46.480 --> 1:57:47.800]  developments on that front.
[1:57:47.800 --> 1:57:51.480]  Right now, let's go to Jeremy.
[1:57:51.480 --> 1:57:52.480]  Or was it Helen?
[1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:53.480]  Who have I not gone to yet?
[1:57:53.480 --> 1:57:54.480]  Helen in New York.
[1:57:54.480 --> 1:57:55.480]  Helen, you're on the air.
[1:57:55.480 --> 1:57:56.480]  Thanks for holding.
[1:57:56.480 --> 1:58:00.280]  John, you going to bring her up?
[1:58:00.280 --> 1:58:01.280]  Helen dropped off.
[1:58:01.280 --> 1:58:02.280]  Okay.
[1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:03.280]  She just dropped off.
[1:58:03.280 --> 1:58:04.280]  Right as we went to her.
[1:58:04.280 --> 1:58:05.280]  Jeremy in Chicago.
[1:58:05.280 --> 1:58:06.280]  Go ahead, Jeremy.
[1:58:06.280 --> 1:58:07.280]  Hey, Alex.
[1:58:07.280 --> 1:58:08.280]  How's it going?
[1:58:08.280 --> 1:58:09.280]  Good, sir.
[1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:12.760]  Hey, I want to just say, and I really wanted to get on when you were on with Tom there,
[1:58:12.760 --> 1:58:17.800]  but I woke up to your program about, I don't know, eight months ago, and about a week ago
[1:58:17.800 --> 1:58:21.160]  or two, I picked up Unequal Protection by Tom.
[1:58:21.160 --> 1:58:27.120]  And I just thought listening to a lot of the discord there between you two and some
[1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:28.120]  of the callers.
[1:58:28.120 --> 1:58:34.960]  You know, I'm kind of unusual in the sense that I, you know, see both sides of it at
[1:58:34.960 --> 1:58:35.960]  this point.
[1:58:35.960 --> 1:58:36.960]  Stay there.
[1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:37.960]  Stay there.
[1:58:37.960 --> 1:58:38.960]  Stay there.
[1:58:38.960 --> 1:58:39.960]  We'll be back in 70 seconds with you, and we'll see if I lose my shirt again.
[1:58:39.960 --> 1:58:40.960]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:40.960 --> 1:58:41.960]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:41.960 --> 1:58:42.960]  Hello, friends.
[1:58:42.960 --> 1:58:43.960]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:58:43.960 --> 1:58:56.480]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[1:58:56.480 --> 1:58:57.480]  important than ever.
[1:58:57.480 --> 1:59:00.440]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[1:59:00.440 --> 1:59:03.200]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[1:59:03.200 --> 1:59:07.240]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[1:59:07.240 --> 1:59:11.200]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in
[1:59:11.200 --> 1:59:12.800]  the final equation between you.
[1:59:12.800 --> 1:59:17.200]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli,
[1:59:17.200 --> 1:59:20.840]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the
[1:59:20.840 --> 1:59:23.040]  cost of last year's grocery prices.
[1:59:23.040 --> 1:59:28.160]  For a 1-800-409-5633, or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:33.080]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the find list of high quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated
[1:59:33.080 --> 1:59:34.560]  foods they have to offer.
[1:59:34.560 --> 1:59:35.560]  Watch the free videos.
[1:59:35.560 --> 1:59:42.240]  Look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633, again, 800-409-5633,
[1:59:42.240 --> 1:59:45.920]  or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[1:59:45.920 --> 1:59:46.920]  Take action today.
[1:59:46.920 --> 1:59:53.920]  The first step is getting storable food.
[2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:44.440]  ideas, just like those at the Green Dragon Inn had ideas back in 1775.
[2:00:44.440 --> 2:00:49.600]  We need to take action against the New World Order every day in every way.
[2:00:49.600 --> 2:00:51.600]  Let's go ahead and go back to Jeremy in Chicago.
[2:00:51.600 --> 2:00:54.080]  Okay, you're saying you can see it from both sides.
[2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:55.080]  Go ahead.
[2:00:55.080 --> 2:01:00.840]  Yeah, well, see, I was a diet in the wolf, staunch Republican, finance manager at an
[2:01:00.840 --> 2:01:05.160]  automotive dealership, lost my job about a year ago, which used to not be a problem.
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:07.520]  I could always pick up another one, you know.
[2:01:07.520 --> 2:01:09.720]  Now, you know, it's been a year.
[2:01:09.720 --> 2:01:11.120]  I'm out of work.
[2:01:11.120 --> 2:01:15.840]  I pick up your stuff, and I totally become awake to that.
[2:01:15.840 --> 2:01:20.400]  Then I pick up Hartman, and I start reading Unequal Protection, you know, the rise of
[2:01:20.400 --> 2:01:23.120]  corporate dominance and the theft of human rights.
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:26.760]  And I can open my mind to his side, where it seems like a lot of people-
[2:01:26.760 --> 2:01:30.120]  Yeah, but the New World Order structure is a corporate structure.
[2:01:30.120 --> 2:01:31.680]  They're just misusing it.
[2:01:31.680 --> 2:01:35.480]  They need to be brought to justice, and you can pierce those corporate veils.
[2:01:35.480 --> 2:01:39.240]  So just saying get rid of corporations, that's not really the complete fix.
[2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:44.680]  You know, I have a corporation, and I've done that, you know, for liability protection,
[2:01:44.680 --> 2:01:46.160]  and also for tax issues.
[2:01:46.160 --> 2:01:52.360]  But certainly, the corporations coming in and getting laws passed where they get paid
[2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:56.880]  to move offshore, that's treason, and that isn't fair of free trade.
[2:01:56.880 --> 2:02:01.680]  You know, I mean, you heard Hartman calling for compulsory national service and trying
[2:02:01.680 --> 2:02:03.600]  to say that's what Thomas Jefferson wanted.
[2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:04.600]  No, it was the opposite.
[2:02:04.600 --> 2:02:09.480]  Thomas Jefferson wanted no federal control, and the state's armed, ready to fight the
[2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:10.480]  feds.
[2:02:10.480 --> 2:02:11.960]  He even says that stuff in his book.
[2:02:11.960 --> 2:02:13.120]  I don't know where he was coming from.
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:18.960]  I was kind of out of, let's say, left field, but anyway, what I'm trying to say is, it
[2:02:18.960 --> 2:02:24.480]  seems like the left is harder to wake up to the paradigm, because they're so entrenched.
[2:02:24.480 --> 2:02:25.480]  I don't know.
[2:02:25.480 --> 2:02:29.080]  I mean, I've found right-wingers that go, so what a million I racked up.
[2:02:29.080 --> 2:02:30.840]  So what have they taken our freedoms?
[2:02:30.840 --> 2:02:34.440]  You know, and I'm like, no, no, the whole Homeland Security thing is built for you.
[2:02:34.440 --> 2:02:35.440]  No conservatives.
[2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:37.800]  Shut up, conspiracy head.
[2:02:37.800 --> 2:02:40.480]  Now they're freaking out over all these federal documents and things.
[2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:42.880]  Now they're going, Alex, what am I going to do?
[2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:49.880]  And then meanwhile, all the neocons, Rick Perry, and Dick Armey, and all these hosts
[2:02:49.880 --> 2:02:53.800]  are like, yeah, and culture wants to fight the New World Order after saying it didn't
[2:02:53.800 --> 2:02:54.800]  exist.
[2:02:54.800 --> 2:02:56.840]  They're capitulating to us.
[2:02:56.840 --> 2:02:58.400]  They're admitting we're the majority.
[2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:00.160]  And by the way, we're waking the left up.
[2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:01.880]  Why do you think Tom Hartman had me on?
[2:03:01.880 --> 2:03:05.000]  You know, I mean, that's a good point.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:06.720]  We are winning, Baba.
[2:03:06.720 --> 2:03:07.720]  We're making history.
[2:03:07.720 --> 2:03:10.960]  And I know I'm glad to be part of it.
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:14.320]  I got a big old target written on my butt, and I just need everybody's support.
[2:03:14.320 --> 2:03:16.120]  I appreciate your call, Baba.
[2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:18.120]  All right.
[2:03:18.120 --> 2:03:19.120]  Just give us the gas.
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:20.120]  We spare your lives.
[2:03:20.120 --> 2:03:21.120]  All right.
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:22.120]  Let's go ahead.
[2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:23.620]  And are you going to trust that guy?
[2:03:23.620 --> 2:03:25.560]  You can trust the New World Order folks.
[2:03:25.560 --> 2:03:27.600]  Let's go ahead and talk to Danny in Brooklyn.
[2:03:27.600 --> 2:03:29.600]  Danny, Danny boy.
[2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:31.800]  Alex, how you doing?
[2:03:31.800 --> 2:03:32.800]  Very good, sir.
[2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:33.800]  Go ahead.
[2:03:33.800 --> 2:03:34.800]  How you doing, buddy?
[2:03:34.800 --> 2:03:35.800]  Good.
[2:03:35.800 --> 2:03:36.800]  All right.
[2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:41.680]  First, I wanted to say that that guy, Tom, in 2006, said that there should be a $10, a
[2:03:41.680 --> 2:03:44.240]  gallon of gas tax.
[2:03:44.240 --> 2:03:46.520]  Well, I disagree with that.
[2:03:46.520 --> 2:03:50.160]  Again, they think they have to admit now, though, that 90 plus percent of the money
[2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:51.720]  goes to offshore bankers.
[2:03:51.720 --> 2:03:54.920]  And so they're like, yes, but I'm still for big government to help people, help people
[2:03:54.920 --> 2:03:57.600]  pay inner city people to not have a man in the house.
[2:03:57.600 --> 2:04:00.720]  So the family breaks down and they can institutionalize their children.
[2:04:00.720 --> 2:04:03.600]  How is that helping black people or whites or anybody else?
[2:04:03.600 --> 2:04:08.840]  You've always got these, you've always got these well-meaning liberals going, oh, help
[2:04:08.840 --> 2:04:10.000]  me, help me.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:12.400]  But that's a projected false reality.
[2:04:12.400 --> 2:04:13.760]  The foundations give them.
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:15.600]  The foundations are cold-blooded Eugenesis.
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:16.600]  Go ahead.
[2:04:16.600 --> 2:04:17.600]  Yeah.
[2:04:17.600 --> 2:04:18.600]  I mean, I wanted to tell him this.
[2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:22.240]  I wanted to tell him that the carbon tax is garbage, you know, but I wasn't able to
[2:04:22.240 --> 2:04:23.800]  get onto the show by then.
[2:04:23.800 --> 2:04:24.800]  But I would have loved to.
[2:04:24.800 --> 2:04:28.840]  I'm a deception and all the truth patriots from around America appreciate everything
[2:04:28.840 --> 2:04:30.880]  that you're doing for this movement.
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:32.400]  Listen, the people are angry.
[2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:33.400]  Thank you, sir.
[2:04:33.400 --> 2:04:34.400]  The people are angry.
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:35.400]  They're waking up.
[2:04:35.400 --> 2:04:36.400]  They're getting involved.
[2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:39.120]  And they know that Ron Paul supporters, my supporters are out having tea parties and
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:40.320]  patriot meetings.
[2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:42.320]  And so they're going, oh, we're, we're for that.
[2:04:42.320 --> 2:04:45.320]  And they're coming in and taking over what is said and done at them.
[2:04:45.320 --> 2:04:46.320]  Well, that's okay.
[2:04:46.320 --> 2:04:48.160]  This is what a fight's all about.
[2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:54.000]  We go in with DVDs, films, books, and then we use the neocons who send their people
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  to the meetings.
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:05:02.160]  By and large, the neocon minions are good folks, we unlock their minds, we win.
[2:05:02.160 --> 2:05:05.900]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political
[2:05:05.900 --> 2:05:08.200]  problems facing the U.S. and the world.
[2:05:08.200 --> 2:05:12.120]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[2:05:12.120 --> 2:05:16.600]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated
[2:05:16.600 --> 2:05:18.600]  foods for almost 40 years.
[2:05:18.600 --> 2:05:20.560]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[2:05:20.560 --> 2:05:24.680]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality
[2:05:24.680 --> 2:05:28.840]  from start to finish with doubly-nammeled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[2:05:28.840 --> 2:05:32.960]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying Factory Direct at wholesale
[2:05:32.960 --> 2:05:33.960]  prices.
[2:05:33.960 --> 2:05:37.240]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve
[2:05:37.240 --> 2:05:39.360]  ships within five business days.
[2:05:39.360 --> 2:05:41.460]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.

[2:06:01.400 --> 2:06:07.440]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:06:07.440 --> 2:06:12.000]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:13.280]  us would like to see.
[2:06:13.280 --> 2:06:18.440]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:06:18.440 --> 2:06:19.840]  of the American people.
[2:06:19.840 --> 2:06:29.320]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:06:29.320 --> 2:06:37.440]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[2:06:37.440 --> 2:06:41.000]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:47.920]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[2:06:47.920 --> 2:06:56.120]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[2:06:56.120 --> 2:07:01.120]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[2:07:01.120 --> 2:07:05.680]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[2:07:05.680 --> 2:07:10.000]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:14.800]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[2:07:14.800 --> 2:07:18.480]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:07:18.480 --> 2:07:23.000]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:24.240]  across America.
[2:07:24.240 --> 2:07:27.960]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[2:07:27.960 --> 2:07:31.640]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[2:07:31.640 --> 2:07:32.640]  healthier I feel.
[2:07:32.640 --> 2:07:35.320]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:07:35.320 --> 2:07:40.520]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[2:07:40.520 --> 2:07:43.040]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[2:07:43.040 --> 2:07:51.280]  Here your two months supply today by calling 866-295-5305, that's 866-295-5305, or order
[2:07:51.280 --> 2:08:06.080]  online hbextract.com, heart and body extract 866-295-5305, or hbextract.com.
[2:08:06.080 --> 2:08:35.600]  Yeah, a lot of us are losing the shirt off our backs, and we don't, we don't, we don't
[2:08:35.600 --> 2:08:40.640]  pay the mafia, they'll come swat team us, make up lies, put us in their phony courts
[2:08:40.640 --> 2:08:41.640]  with no juries.
[2:08:41.640 --> 2:08:45.280]  If we do pay them, they usually come back with retroactive taxes and claim you didn't
[2:08:45.280 --> 2:08:48.960]  pay things properly, and turn a thousand dollars into a million dollars you owe them, and then
[2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:52.840]  you're destroyed forever, that's what government wants, is to control you, they're parasite
[2:08:52.840 --> 2:08:58.040]  control freaks, and they're not going to be happy until you're literally doing nothing
[2:08:58.040 --> 2:09:03.760]  but wearing a barrel shirtless.
[2:09:03.760 --> 2:09:07.600]  And then if you try to go out and live in a park or something, or in the woods somewhere
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:11.760]  on a railroad track, and no man's land, the police show up from Europe to Canada to the
[2:09:11.760 --> 2:09:14.880]  United States and say, you're not allowed to be homeless, we're going to arrest you
[2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:18.320]  and take you to a FEMA camp, like they're doing in California, and they take the taxpayer
[2:09:18.320 --> 2:09:21.560]  money, and they make the people pay for that.
[2:09:21.560 --> 2:09:31.280]  And remember, 30 to 1, 1% out of 30 of the money that you pay in taxes ever even comes
[2:09:31.280 --> 2:09:35.080]  back to you, it all goes to offshore banks, it's a total fraud, a total scam, and that's
[2:09:35.080 --> 2:09:37.760]  now admitted in public for everybody out there.
[2:09:37.760 --> 2:09:41.440]  We're going to go to Walter Reddy, he's an amazing individual, I've never interviewed
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:46.680]  before, so we're honored to have him coming on with Oath Keepers here in just a moment.
[2:09:46.680 --> 2:09:51.520]  But again, I'm doing the show today shirtless, just to illustrate how we're being robbed
[2:09:51.520 --> 2:09:56.220]  by highway bandits, literally they just come stick you up on the side of the highway and
[2:09:56.220 --> 2:09:58.520]  take everything you got.
[2:09:58.520 --> 2:10:02.400]  Before we go to Walter Reddy, how about the Oath Keeper situation and also his committees
[2:10:02.400 --> 2:10:05.760]  of safety that Evan Vieira has talked about so many times on the show, but Walter Reddy
[2:10:05.760 --> 2:10:07.260]  started it.
[2:10:07.260 --> 2:10:14.080]  We will go to him in just a moment, but first, Survival Seed Bank, survivalseedbank.com.
[2:10:14.080 --> 2:10:19.000]  In a really serious crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:21.880]  endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[2:10:21.880 --> 2:10:24.960]  There have been times in American history, pilgrims, for example, when seeds of the highest
[2:10:24.960 --> 2:10:29.280]  value of any barter item, even silver or gold, there was a war on against non-hybrid seeds
[2:10:29.280 --> 2:10:33.920]  waged by the global elite who wanted to control us by controlling the food supply.
[2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:37.080]  Governments are storing seeds, the U.N. is storing seeds, globalists of every stripe
[2:10:37.080 --> 2:10:41.160]  are storing seeds under the Arctic Circle, why do you think that is?
[2:10:41.160 --> 2:10:45.600]  You know why, control and power, that's why they say they're doing it.
[2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:49.600]  Solutions from science is trying to get seeds out of the globalist hands and into the hands
[2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:50.700]  of the people.
[2:10:50.700 --> 2:10:55.280]  One seed bank at a time, one family at a time, a Survival Seed Bank from Solutions from
[2:10:55.280 --> 2:11:00.560]  Science contains enough pollinated seeds to plant a full-acre crisis garden.
[2:11:00.560 --> 2:11:05.160]  Seeds in the Survival Seed Bank are hand-picked for exceptional germination rates.
[2:11:05.160 --> 2:11:14.000]  Order a couple seed banks today while you still can, Survivalseedbank.com, or 877-327-0365-877-327-0365.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:19.640]  We are now into hour number three, of course, and this is our second hour of simulcasting.
[2:11:19.640 --> 2:11:23.160]  We always simulcast in the third and fourth hour, but a lot of days we do the first, second,
[2:11:23.160 --> 2:11:26.760]  third, and fourth hour simulcast at PrismPlanet.tv.
[2:11:26.760 --> 2:11:31.040]  By the way, we just redesigned PrismPlanet.tv, so I want to encourage all the listeners to
[2:11:31.040 --> 2:11:35.400]  go check out the new PrismPlanet.tv and all the new functions and services that are there
[2:11:35.400 --> 2:11:37.720]  in the Info War.
[2:11:37.720 --> 2:11:40.680]  Now until about 45 after, we're going to have Walter ready on with us and I'm going to open
[2:11:40.680 --> 2:11:44.080]  the phones up for 20 minutes or so, then we have another guest coming on and then an update
[2:11:44.080 --> 2:11:47.440]  from a Tea Party going on with several thousand people being reported already starting to
[2:11:47.440 --> 2:11:51.640]  amass in San Antonio.
[2:11:51.640 --> 2:11:56.120]  The original committees of safety were composed of actual members of state legislatures, generally
[2:11:56.120 --> 2:12:01.920]  recognized activists and other leaders from the states who were appointed by the committees
[2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:07.360]  by the legislatures to serve as the legislature's agents and advisors, we need this again, and
[2:12:07.360 --> 2:12:10.840]  to carry on the legislature's work during recess.
[2:12:10.840 --> 2:12:15.760]  The committees, it was kind of like a legging or a spokesman, an agent.
[2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:20.120]  The committees were never independent of the legislatures and never carried out any plans
[2:12:20.120 --> 2:12:24.600]  that were not approved by the legislatures, just like senators until 1913 were voted on
[2:12:24.600 --> 2:12:28.240]  by the legislatures, meaning you popularly elect the legislatures, but the senators or
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:32.240]  creatures of the state in Washington, so that's the local control they're getting rid of.
[2:12:32.240 --> 2:12:36.480]  The chief concern of the committees was the safety of the public to put the territory
[2:12:36.480 --> 2:12:42.320]  under the supervision in a state of defense and maintenance there effectively, and he
[2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:48.400]  goes through the provincial committees of safety in the American Revolution, Cleveland,
[2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:52.280]  Ohio, and all the different historical records of that.
[2:12:52.280 --> 2:12:54.320]  But let's go ahead and go to Walter Reddy.
[2:12:54.320 --> 2:12:56.080]  Walter, you've done so much.
[2:12:56.080 --> 2:13:00.800]  You're instrumental in awakening people to the new older takeover in the early 90s and
[2:13:00.800 --> 2:13:05.920]  even before that, and getting people mobilized, true libertarians, conservatives, constitutionalists,
[2:13:05.920 --> 2:13:07.880]  classical liberals, paleo-conservatives.
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:11.640]  How would you describe yourself and just recap for folks that may not know who you are, the
[2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:12.640]  work you've done?
[2:13:12.640 --> 2:13:16.320]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:26.360]  I feel you've done an amazing job, too, and it's a real honor to be on here with you.
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:34.400]  I would kind of describe myself as a constitutional activist, and I'm so happy that we have more
[2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:39.200]  and more activists instead of just sitting back.
[2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:40.480]  That's exactly what we need.
[2:13:40.480 --> 2:13:49.560]  We need more people getting involved and taking action, and, well, I don't know where to start
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:50.560]  here.
[2:13:50.560 --> 2:13:52.200]  What would you...
[2:13:52.200 --> 2:13:58.160]  The original committees of safety, like you were saying, they were actually like a subcommittee
[2:13:58.160 --> 2:14:05.440]  of the original colonial assemblies, and when the royal governor was acting as the executive
[2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:10.360]  branch, we still had the colonial assemblies.
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:17.160]  The committees of safety functioned as their executive branch, and they appointed the local
[2:14:17.160 --> 2:14:24.680]  committees of safety, appointed the officers, militia officers, for their security and defense.
[2:14:24.680 --> 2:14:30.480]  And that's why they called state police public safety today, because they try to have its
[2:14:30.480 --> 2:14:35.440]  quote, roots of empowerment through the state legislatures and through their charters, but
[2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:37.160]  really they've just turned into federal minions.
[2:14:37.160 --> 2:14:43.120]  So you're trying to bring back the real committees of safety, and I'm sure you know you were demonized
[2:14:43.120 --> 2:14:46.280]  in the Virginia Anti-Terrorism Threat Assessment.
[2:14:46.280 --> 2:14:51.080]  You were demonized in previous Mayak reports, now reported on by the Kansas City Star.
[2:14:51.080 --> 2:14:56.720]  They are very upset about citizens actually working with their elected representatives
[2:14:56.720 --> 2:15:02.280]  because we have the executive branch of the feds trying to make not just the state legislatures
[2:15:02.280 --> 2:15:08.040]  invalid and ceremonial and vestigial, but also the federal Congress in PDD 51.
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:13.760]  So they are desperately trying to even render the legislatures gilded, and they're very
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:18.760]  afraid of the people tying in to their real power, the state governments constituted by
[2:15:18.760 --> 2:15:21.120]  the people, and so they're screaming bloody murder.
[2:15:21.120 --> 2:15:26.920]  The feds are, this is like Kryptonite to Bizarro.
[2:15:26.920 --> 2:15:35.560]  Exactly, you're absolutely right, Alex, and I think they know that, and this thing is
[2:15:35.560 --> 2:15:40.600]  so powerful, and you've done a great job on breaking that left-right paradigm.
[2:15:40.600 --> 2:15:47.120]  If we, if false left-right paradigm, I mean, they're so afraid, our adversaries, if we
[2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:55.000]  ever unite and get behind this common, what's for our common general welfare and safety,
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:16:00.400]  you know, the people, and bring that power back to the people.
[2:16:00.400 --> 2:16:02.280]  So that's what we're really about.
[2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:05.840]  The committees of safety differ in that sense.
[2:16:05.840 --> 2:16:10.000]  We're not part of the state legislatures, but we are working with them.
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:17.040]  We support our state legislators in performing their most vital constitutional duties.
[2:16:17.040 --> 2:16:23.400]  And Dr. Edwin Vieires, who happens to be the chairman of the IRB board, he pointed out
[2:16:23.400 --> 2:16:30.000]  pretty clearly these, we want to reclaim these two ancient powers, the power of the
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:35.320]  person, the power of the sword, and bring this back to the people, these two powers.
[2:16:35.320 --> 2:16:36.320]  Absolutely.
[2:16:36.320 --> 2:16:39.720]  Tell us about what's coming up this weekend, very historical.
[2:16:39.720 --> 2:16:44.040]  Oh, it's incredible.
[2:16:44.040 --> 2:16:48.260]  We were up there at Lexington for the past couple of months, I've been dealing with
[2:16:48.260 --> 2:16:55.920]  the Lexington selectments on the Lexington, Lexington, Lexington, and Lexington.
[2:16:55.920 --> 2:17:03.000]  They have five selectmen, and they have, well, I'd say like a gatekeeper, it was very difficult
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:04.840]  to get through.
[2:17:04.840 --> 2:17:10.640]  We ended up at the selectmen's meeting, and we needed three of the five votes of the selectmen
[2:17:10.640 --> 2:17:15.680]  to get this, we had major opposition for our group to get this.
[2:17:15.680 --> 2:17:21.200]  Yeah, to be able to assemble in America now is near impossible, but you did get through
[2:17:21.200 --> 2:17:23.800]  that unconstitutional loop.
[2:17:23.800 --> 2:17:31.360]  On the actual green where the battle of Lexington took place, we have the official, we got
[2:17:31.360 --> 2:17:38.680]  the permit, committed the safety, got the permit for the official staging area on the
[2:17:38.680 --> 2:17:46.440]  actual anniversary on the day of the anniversary, they're not having the official reenactment
[2:17:46.440 --> 2:17:53.560]  for the next day, so this is really amazing, and we've got, we've got the oathkeepers,
[2:17:53.560 --> 2:17:58.320]  like you mentioned, they'll be attending, they'll be, it's a great coalition that we're
[2:17:58.320 --> 2:17:59.320]  building.
[2:17:59.320 --> 2:18:03.000]  And by the way, there's all these big famous Navy SEAL captains and other people that lead
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:07.320]  movements of millions of people are going to be there, I mean, there are a lot of big
[2:18:07.320 --> 2:18:08.760]  heavy hitters that are going to be there.
[2:18:08.760 --> 2:18:11.600]  I'm very honored you guys have invited me, I'm tied down here.
[2:18:11.600 --> 2:18:17.160]  I hope you make it, Alex, we really need you there, and I'd love to talk to you all
[2:18:17.160 --> 2:18:19.440]  fair about what's going on there.
[2:18:19.440 --> 2:18:23.800]  Well, okay, we'll talk after the show, I apologize for calling you, I've just been
[2:18:23.800 --> 2:18:28.800]  so busy with interviews and everything else, because we're having such a huge harvest right
[2:18:28.800 --> 2:18:34.080]  now, Walter, as you know, so many people are waking up right now that I'm just tied down
[2:18:34.080 --> 2:18:39.880]  to in radio interviews talking to millions a day, but what's important here is that you
[2:18:39.880 --> 2:18:44.400]  and others that have been in this fight as long as I have her longer, you're out there
[2:18:44.400 --> 2:18:48.400]  as people wake up to the new world order and get upset, you're actually out there showing
[2:18:48.400 --> 2:18:52.160]  them what the real problem is, instead of letting them get co-opted by the controlled
[2:18:52.160 --> 2:18:54.080]  left or the controlled right.
[2:18:54.080 --> 2:18:57.400]  And so we need, this is the time for every able-bodied man and woman to come to the
[2:18:57.400 --> 2:19:00.240]  aid of their country and to fill in that vacuum.
[2:19:00.240 --> 2:19:03.480]  There's a power vacuum now because the new world order is so unpopular, we've got to
[2:19:03.480 --> 2:19:08.000]  come in there and fill it with the Constitution, with the Bill of Rights, with the spirit of
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  1776.
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:17.600]  I believe we have a simple plan here, and I think it will work, and it's very powerful,
[2:19:17.600 --> 2:19:23.320]  it's a simple plan, it's contained in this petition we have on our site, you can download
[2:19:23.320 --> 2:19:32.800]  it, and the petition is to, we support a constitutional system of security and defense
[2:19:32.800 --> 2:19:39.400]  for our free state, which includes a sound money system, monetary system, we're hoping
[2:19:39.400 --> 2:19:44.960]  to get millions of these petitions signed because with that, that will be our power,
[2:19:44.960 --> 2:19:51.560]  the power that we can get these state legislators to enact these statutes, to reclaim these
[2:19:51.560 --> 2:19:52.560]  powers.
[2:19:52.560 --> 2:19:55.480]  Walter, stay there, I want to hear about this when we get back, and by the way folks, you
[2:19:55.480 --> 2:20:00.600]  said we couldn't do it, 30 plus states are moving and some states are passing 10th Amendment
[2:20:00.600 --> 2:20:01.600]  resolutions.
[2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:05.560]  If you have over $10,000 in credit card debt, you need to hear this.
[2:20:05.560 --> 2:20:09.800]  Have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief

[2:21:01.240 --> 2:21:04.600]  With an economy that continues to plummet, many of us will have to make the difficult
[2:21:04.600 --> 2:21:07.160]  decision to cut back on our expenses.
[2:21:07.160 --> 2:21:10.280]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on though is our health.

[2:22:06.600 --> 2:22:13.280]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[2:22:13.280 --> 2:22:14.640]  just as well funded.
[2:22:14.640 --> 2:22:19.760]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:22:19.760 --> 2:22:21.280]  of the American people.
[2:22:21.280 --> 2:22:25.640]  Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:30.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:22:30.760 --> 2:22:37.280]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:22:37.280 --> 2:22:40.840]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[2:22:40.840 --> 2:22:47.760]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:24:07.200 --> 2:24:16.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, 1-800-259-9231 is the toll free number to join us on air.
[2:24:16.360 --> 2:24:22.200]  Walter Reddy is our guest, got a ton of news coming up I haven't even gotten to yet.
[2:24:22.200 --> 2:24:27.160]  Germany bans the cultivation of GM corn, and they've got all the studies there where it's
[2:24:27.160 --> 2:24:31.640]  killing the bees, folks, because the corn has a pesticide in it.
[2:24:31.640 --> 2:24:34.920]  It grows its own pesticide, so bugs won't eat it.
[2:24:34.920 --> 2:24:38.480]  But bees and birds don't know, and they eat it and die dead or to hammer.
[2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:42.800]  I told you years ago with German scientists, it was the corn, so this is a real environmental
[2:24:42.800 --> 2:24:47.960]  crisis, not all the fake ones they used to set up carbon taxes and things.
[2:24:47.960 --> 2:24:50.880]  I've got a bunch of other news here that we're going to be going over, but right now I'm
[2:24:50.880 --> 2:24:51.880]  going back to Walter Reddy.
[2:24:51.880 --> 2:24:58.440]  Walter, plug the Committees of Safety website, and then also you were getting into this petition
[2:24:58.440 --> 2:24:59.440]  that's taking place.
[2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:02.880]  I'm going to point out to the listeners, a couple of months ago we were really hammering
[2:25:02.880 --> 2:25:09.080]  the fact that we could have state rights, 10th Amendment declarations, and 9th Amendment
[2:25:09.080 --> 2:25:12.640]  declarations refiled just to educate the public and have the states draw a line in
[2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:13.640]  the sand.
[2:25:13.640 --> 2:25:17.160]  That all started in Oklahoma and New Hampshire.
[2:25:17.160 --> 2:25:20.960]  Well now it's 30 plus states, South Dakota's passed it, Texas is on the verge, other states
[2:25:20.960 --> 2:25:22.760]  are passing it.
[2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:26.120]  This is an example of the animating contest of liberty.
[2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:29.000]  The evil is animated because it wants to steal and control.
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:33.220]  We have to be animated because we want liberty and the animating contest.
[2:25:33.220 --> 2:25:40.480]  Get that competitive spirit out there to beat their attempt to take over, so please continue.
[2:25:40.480 --> 2:25:43.560]  Yes, you're right, Alex.
[2:25:43.560 --> 2:25:52.480]  A number of, we have a lot of allies within our state legislation legislators, and it's
[2:25:52.480 --> 2:25:58.800]  a great first step the way I see it, you know, the exerting of 10th Amendment, their sovereignty,
[2:25:58.800 --> 2:26:00.120]  and they're starting to wake up.
[2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:05.480]  A lot of these state legislators, like you know, are just starting to wake up too to
[2:26:05.480 --> 2:26:07.520]  where that real power resides.
[2:26:07.520 --> 2:26:13.360]  It resides with we the people in the states and the federal government's limited.
[2:26:13.360 --> 2:26:19.800]  So what we're doing, what these statutes, what these petitions that we're calling for,
[2:26:19.800 --> 2:26:26.020]  this will put teeth into those 10th Amendment resolutions.
[2:26:26.020 --> 2:26:33.480]  Just right now, without that revitalized state militia and the sound stable money system,
[2:26:33.480 --> 2:26:39.560]  I mean, it's just the federal government is still controlling the purse strings and we
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:43.880]  need to be able to get these powers back.
[2:26:43.880 --> 2:26:48.240]  Now Walter, already explain this to people, you've been studying the militia and promoting
[2:26:48.240 --> 2:26:49.760]  it for many years.
[2:26:49.760 --> 2:26:53.080]  I've studied the Federalist Papers, the Anti-Federalist Papers, I've interviewed all these constitutional
[2:26:53.080 --> 2:26:54.080]  law scholars.
[2:26:54.080 --> 2:26:59.040]  I've gotten a pretty clear picture but I want to get your take on it because there's confusion.
[2:26:59.040 --> 2:27:01.320]  There's really three militias.
[2:27:01.320 --> 2:27:07.320]  There's the liberal, fake, counterfeit Obama, tattle on your neighbor, do gun confiscation
[2:27:07.320 --> 2:27:10.800]  militia, which they've openly announced and detailed what it is.
[2:27:10.800 --> 2:27:14.920]  It's exactly what we said because we read their book, the Chief of Staff.
[2:27:14.920 --> 2:27:21.160]  There's the infiltrated FBI created fake racist militia where we caught the Viper militia
[2:27:21.160 --> 2:27:24.280]  and everybody else where the FBI becomes a militia leader.
[2:27:24.280 --> 2:27:28.760]  They recruit weak-minded people, they set them up and sting them to create the illusion
[2:27:28.760 --> 2:27:35.560]  of this big dangerous militia to demonize the third type, the real militia that is local,
[2:27:35.560 --> 2:27:40.320]  state controlled by the counties, the cities and legislatures, really civil defense for
[2:27:40.320 --> 2:27:43.880]  the state sovereignty against common criminals and the feds.
[2:27:43.880 --> 2:27:47.760]  And so people try to oversimplify and confuse the three militias.
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:51.600]  I had a big liberal talk show host ask me, well, if you're for militias, Alex, why aren't
[2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:53.280]  you for what Barack Obama wants?
[2:27:53.280 --> 2:27:59.520]  There's a difference between federal compulsory and late and local state militias.
[2:27:59.520 --> 2:28:01.000]  Absolutely.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:06.720]  And what the Department of Homeland Security, this top-down structure, pyramidal structure
[2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:11.080]  is what they're trying to impose on us.
[2:28:11.080 --> 2:28:12.600]  This is just the opposite.
[2:28:12.600 --> 2:28:17.720]  It's like a reversed pyramid where the way it was originally, the original principle
[2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:25.880]  of the colonial militia from the earliest days, 16, early 1600s till the late 1800s,
[2:28:25.880 --> 2:28:33.680]  we had, that was the, for over 250 years, that was the structure, the power was really
[2:28:33.680 --> 2:28:40.320]  with the people, the officers were elected within the town, the militia officers.
[2:28:40.320 --> 2:28:46.680]  And that's what we want to revitalize by statute and generally it was military veterans,
[2:28:46.680 --> 2:28:53.360]  it was police, it was firemen, it was people who wanted to be involved were in the militia.
[2:28:53.360 --> 2:28:56.400]  Basically all the men were, but it was, you know, who wanted to show up and be part of
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:28:57.400]  it.
[2:28:57.400 --> 2:29:00.560]  And the community was one group of people and everybody trusted each other instead of
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:04.400]  federalized local police that are taught not to trust us.
[2:29:04.400 --> 2:29:09.040]  Police, wouldn't you rather have the people be your friends and you be with the people?
[2:29:09.040 --> 2:29:10.040]  Yes.
[2:29:10.040 --> 2:29:18.960]  Well, we want to do, and during the, like say, the war of independence, we, the militia,
[2:29:18.960 --> 2:29:27.760]  the state militia, it complimented the continental army, the state militias worked, you know,
[2:29:27.760 --> 2:29:29.720]  they complimented one another.
[2:29:29.720 --> 2:29:38.400]  We had an invasion and the state, the state, the colonial militia was around much earlier,
[2:29:38.400 --> 2:29:41.840]  and they helped, and they helped win a lot of the battles.
[2:29:41.840 --> 2:29:44.560]  Stay there while I'm talking about this big meeting coming up this weekend, where you
[2:29:44.560 --> 2:29:50.080]  see this amazing a renaissance of liberty going and how we can be sure that the good
[2:29:50.080 --> 2:29:51.080]  guys win.
[2:29:51.080 --> 2:29:52.080]  Stay with us.
[2:29:52.080 --> 2:29:53.080]  We're on the march.
[2:29:53.080 --> 2:29:55.440]  The empire's on the run.
[2:29:55.440 --> 2:30:01.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[2:30:57.600 --> 2:31:08.080]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:31:08.080 --> 2:31:12.600]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[2:31:12.600 --> 2:31:13.920]  us would like to see.
[2:31:13.920 --> 2:31:19.080]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:31:19.080 --> 2:31:20.480]  of the American people.
[2:31:20.480 --> 2:31:26.040]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election, if you have a demagogue
[2:31:26.040 --> 2:31:31.160]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a
[2:31:31.160 --> 2:31:38.080]  group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:31:38.080 --> 2:31:41.640]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one world government.
[2:31:41.640 --> 2:31:48.560]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda.

[2:31:56.720 --> 2:32:01.000]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:05.600]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare
[2:32:05.600 --> 2:32:09.760]  with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds and oil of the hemp plant.
[2:32:09.760 --> 2:32:14.920]  At hempusa.org we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and
[2:32:14.920 --> 2:32:15.920]  Canada.
[2:32:15.920 --> 2:32:21.160]  At hempusa.org we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified

[2:33:19.880 --> 2:33:26.060]  They are your ancestors it is your heritage no matter where you come from in the world.
[2:33:26.060 --> 2:33:30.700]  Your ancestors struggled so you'd have a little bit of freedom you have today.
[2:33:30.700 --> 2:33:37.620]  Is your life just going to be this drunkenness of entertainment and sports and drugs and
[2:33:37.620 --> 2:33:39.620]  alcohol?
[2:33:39.620 --> 2:33:40.780]  Clear your mind.
[2:33:40.780 --> 2:33:45.340]  You know I've been thinking about this a lot lately.
[2:33:45.340 --> 2:33:47.060]  We all need to take off like a week.
[2:33:47.060 --> 2:33:52.420]  I'm not saying some set time but we should all take off for like a week, once a year
[2:33:52.420 --> 2:33:55.980]  and literally fast.
[2:33:55.980 --> 2:34:00.620]  Not eat a lot just drink water, get focused, think about the world, think about what's
[2:34:00.620 --> 2:34:04.900]  important because I'll get where I'm working so hard doing so much it's almost like I'm
[2:34:04.900 --> 2:34:05.900]  drunk on work.
[2:34:05.900 --> 2:34:10.260]  You know I'm staying so busy that every time I just pause for a day or two I get so much
[2:34:10.260 --> 2:34:13.180]  more discernment and understanding and focus.
[2:34:13.180 --> 2:34:16.500]  But can you imagine the average American working at 8-9 hours at work, fights traffic
[2:34:16.500 --> 2:34:20.940]  for an hour, their kids get home on the bus three hours before them, watch television,
[2:34:20.940 --> 2:34:24.300]  go on the Internet, see God knows what.
[2:34:24.300 --> 2:34:27.660]  Kids don't even talk to each other across school counters anymore at lunch, they just
[2:34:27.660 --> 2:34:28.860]  text each other.
[2:34:28.860 --> 2:34:30.500]  We're being sucked into the matrix.
[2:34:30.500 --> 2:34:35.220]  We're drunk on entertainment distractions, forgetting what's really going on in the world
[2:34:35.220 --> 2:34:37.540]  and what life's all about.
[2:34:37.540 --> 2:34:41.580]  Men are meant to stand up for their tribe, for humanity and to be involved in their
[2:34:41.580 --> 2:34:44.100]  communities and to push for justice.
[2:34:44.100 --> 2:34:47.820]  But people are like, oh, the government's doing bad things, but that's just what they
[2:34:47.820 --> 2:34:48.820]  do.
[2:34:48.820 --> 2:34:49.820]  That's called capitulation.
[2:34:49.820 --> 2:34:53.220]  And as soon as you capitulate to corruption, it goes straight downhill.
[2:34:53.220 --> 2:34:56.660]  You know, you don't just say, oh, things are kind of corrupt, I'm going to put up with
[2:34:56.660 --> 2:34:57.660]  it.
[2:34:57.660 --> 2:35:01.620]  The moment you do that, the level of tyranny you will live under is the level you put up
[2:35:01.620 --> 2:35:04.940]  with, as Thomas Jefferson said, paraphrasing.
[2:35:04.940 --> 2:35:12.140]  Going back to Walter Reddy, Walter, Committees of Safety, recap what's coming up this weekend,
[2:35:12.140 --> 2:35:14.940]  folks all over the country, what's going to be happening at this event, and then let's
[2:35:14.940 --> 2:35:19.220]  continue talking about what the real militia reborn would look like.
[2:35:19.220 --> 2:35:23.900]  Instead of the fake fed militia, where they let's hide behind the bushes and train and
[2:35:23.900 --> 2:35:26.700]  everybody's a fed and let's build pipe bombs.
[2:35:26.700 --> 2:35:30.620]  And then in every case, it was a fed who tricked a few good old boys to build a pipe bomb with
[2:35:30.620 --> 2:35:31.620]  him.
[2:35:31.620 --> 2:35:35.900]  And then they put on the news, incredible terrorist attack foiled, and they go out and create
[2:35:35.900 --> 2:35:40.260]  a fake viper militia out of a methamphetamine cooking biker gang.
[2:35:40.260 --> 2:35:44.740]  And the FBI created it, you know, the fake clan groups, all of it.
[2:35:44.740 --> 2:35:46.300]  How do we navigate that?
[2:35:46.300 --> 2:35:52.340]  I guess we'd be out in the open, have our manifesto of liberty?
[2:35:52.340 --> 2:35:53.340]  We are.
[2:35:53.340 --> 2:36:01.540]  We're doing the CommitteesofSafety.org, it's a First Amendment group, that's what we are.
[2:36:01.540 --> 2:36:07.020]  And we're working on these, we will be working on these statutes to revitalize it and give
[2:36:07.020 --> 2:36:09.380]  it legal authority.
[2:36:09.380 --> 2:36:13.980]  That's what the private militias right now do not, will, do not have.
[2:36:13.980 --> 2:36:20.380]  I mean, it always was for 250 years, it was through colonial militia statutes or state
[2:36:20.380 --> 2:36:21.380]  militia statutes.
[2:36:21.380 --> 2:36:26.020]  And law always goes back, law always goes back to the base.
[2:36:26.020 --> 2:36:31.260]  And so under the founding, under the clear letter of the law and the intent, we are
[2:36:31.260 --> 2:36:36.260]  to have these local militias under the county and the state, and we need them right now.
[2:36:36.260 --> 2:36:37.260]  Yes.
[2:36:37.260 --> 2:36:43.540]  So locally, in the officers elected by the people, the ones they trust within their community,
[2:36:43.540 --> 2:36:48.820]  not just top down, out of Washington, you know, all seeing Iowa Washington, you know,
[2:36:48.820 --> 2:36:52.540]  that pyramidal structure they have in place.
[2:36:52.540 --> 2:36:55.700]  So that's, that's what we're doing.
[2:36:55.700 --> 2:37:02.420]  We're going to be, anyone that's near in, can make it to Lexington, it's Sunday noon
[2:37:02.420 --> 2:37:10.700]  to 3 p.m. will be on, on the, the green at Lexington at the very spot where it all took
[2:37:10.700 --> 2:37:20.700]  place, the shot heard around the world, beginning, you know, um, what else?
[2:37:20.700 --> 2:37:25.620]  Well what you're doing is so important, Walter, and what, what oathkeepers is doing is so important
[2:37:25.620 --> 2:37:30.500]  because tyranny will always come to your door in a uniform.
[2:37:30.500 --> 2:37:34.260]  And the average military, the average police, look at, I keep saying this because it's the,
[2:37:34.260 --> 2:37:38.620]  it's a key point, Ron Paul got more political contributions than either one of the other
[2:37:38.620 --> 2:37:41.500]  political party candidates combined.
[2:37:41.500 --> 2:37:45.980]  Ron Paul got the military donations because they're good people on average, they're trying
[2:37:45.980 --> 2:37:50.460]  to hire gang bangers, illegal aliens and others to create the foreign force, and that's not
[2:37:50.460 --> 2:37:56.620]  going too well for them, so they got all these PR campaigns running, pushing it, but we have
[2:37:56.620 --> 2:38:00.940]  to reach out to the police and military, tell folks about the oathkeepers and because they're
[2:38:00.940 --> 2:38:03.140]  going to be there with you as well and some of the other speakers.
[2:38:03.140 --> 2:38:04.140]  Yes.
[2:38:04.140 --> 2:38:10.220]  Well, this, I'm really so pleased about this because it counters like that these Mayak
[2:38:10.220 --> 2:38:15.660]  reports and everything else that want to separate the people and the patriots in this country
[2:38:15.660 --> 2:38:23.260]  from our, our police and, and military, you know, so this is a great coalition.
[2:38:23.260 --> 2:38:32.180]  We want a number of oathkeepers, Stuart Rhodes has started up, founded, they have local and
[2:38:32.180 --> 2:38:39.820]  I mean, retired and current military and police that are reaffirming their oath to uphold
[2:38:39.820 --> 2:38:46.700]  the constitution will not disarm, we've got violate their constitutional oath and oppress
[2:38:46.700 --> 2:38:47.700]  the people.
[2:38:47.700 --> 2:38:50.100]  So this is, this is great.
[2:38:50.100 --> 2:38:56.540]  I mean, the original colonial militia, we had at that time, they supplemented the, at
[2:38:56.540 --> 2:39:01.260]  the time, it was the constables and the sheriffs, you know, they had their function, but we
[2:39:01.260 --> 2:39:07.180]  were all united under a common goal to, to protect our rights.
[2:39:07.180 --> 2:39:11.580]  Well, also they knew that you couldn't have a constable or sheriff's deputy everywhere
[2:39:11.580 --> 2:39:12.980]  at every time.
[2:39:12.980 --> 2:39:16.860]  That's why they said, man, it's your job to protect this area from criminals, from
[2:39:16.860 --> 2:39:21.180]  the natives, from, and then from corrupt government.
[2:39:21.180 --> 2:39:23.460]  And so that's what liberty is all about.
[2:39:23.460 --> 2:39:28.100]  And Switzerland has this system, a few other countries have it, and they are all the freest
[2:39:28.100 --> 2:39:29.100]  nations on earth.
[2:39:29.100 --> 2:39:30.100]  Yeah.
[2:39:30.100 --> 2:39:35.420]  So it'll probably, that's a good point, Alex, I mean, it'll probably, when we revitalize
[2:39:35.420 --> 2:39:41.820]  it by state statute, the constitutional state militia, it'll probably look a little bit
[2:39:41.820 --> 2:39:45.500]  more like something like the Swiss militia has today.
[2:39:45.500 --> 2:39:52.500]  You know, it won't look like it did 200 years ago, but it's the same principles.
[2:39:52.500 --> 2:39:58.460]  And our founders believed there was only one, the only time they used the word necessary
[2:39:58.460 --> 2:40:05.420]  in our constitution, in order to have a free state, there was one thing that was necessary.
[2:40:05.420 --> 2:40:10.940]  And it wasn't Congress, there wasn't even the president, it wasn't the Supreme Court,
[2:40:10.940 --> 2:40:16.820]  but this one thing was the state institution called a well-regulated militia.
[2:40:16.820 --> 2:40:21.100]  That means well-organized within the communities and within the states.
[2:40:21.100 --> 2:40:23.780]  That will provide for a free state.
[2:40:23.780 --> 2:40:28.900]  And without that, you have the opposite, like a police state.
[2:40:28.900 --> 2:40:34.260]  And we haven't had a fully functioning state militia anywhere in this country for over
[2:40:34.260 --> 2:40:37.100]  a hundred years.
[2:40:37.100 --> 2:40:41.180]  And that's what our goal is to revitalize it.
[2:40:41.180 --> 2:40:45.940]  Well, it's just beautiful, Walter.
[2:40:45.940 --> 2:40:46.940]  Are you buoyed?
[2:40:46.940 --> 2:40:47.940]  Are you excited?
[2:40:47.940 --> 2:40:55.140]  Does it harden you to know that there are states like South Dakota, Texas on the verge,
[2:40:55.140 --> 2:40:56.380]  Texas is big?
[2:40:56.380 --> 2:40:57.380]  Yes.
[2:40:57.380 --> 2:41:00.620]  In fact, coming out and saying, we, there is tyranny, we're not putting up with the
[2:41:00.620 --> 2:41:02.420]  tyranny of the feds.
[2:41:02.420 --> 2:41:03.620]  Absolutely.
[2:41:03.620 --> 2:41:09.820]  And Alex, I know you had a lot of the state legislators on that are starting to get this.
[2:41:09.820 --> 2:41:14.860]  And they're really, and I've spoke to a number of them, Dan Itza up in New Hampshire, friend
[2:41:14.860 --> 2:41:20.340]  of mine, and Charles Key down in Oklahoma, I've spoken to, and this is exactly what
[2:41:20.340 --> 2:41:21.340]  they need.
[2:41:21.340 --> 2:41:28.660]  Our allies in these state, these state legislators need this power behind it, and this is what
[2:41:28.660 --> 2:41:31.300]  the petition is all about.
[2:41:31.300 --> 2:41:36.340]  So they, so the state legislators know that the people are behind this.
[2:41:36.340 --> 2:41:42.460]  We'll be able to have the power behind it to get these statutes and past enacted.
[2:41:42.460 --> 2:41:43.460]  So.
[2:41:43.460 --> 2:41:48.980]  In fact, speaking of that, here's Rick Perry, Bilderberg Group member, New World Order, everything
[2:41:48.980 --> 2:41:55.860]  else, but because our movement's coming, so huge, getting so large that the people are
[2:41:55.860 --> 2:42:01.020]  ready for revolution everywhere and resistance to tyranny, the establishment is having to
[2:42:01.020 --> 2:42:03.460]  at least camouflage themselves like us.
[2:42:03.460 --> 2:42:08.420]  And that's fine because that only legitimizes what we're doing even more to block what the
[2:42:08.420 --> 2:42:10.660]  New World Order's doing through Barack Obama.
[2:42:10.660 --> 2:42:13.260]  Here he is in a press conference two days ago.
[2:42:13.260 --> 2:42:15.580]  It concerns all Texans.
[2:42:15.580 --> 2:42:18.060]  It concerns all Americans.
[2:42:18.060 --> 2:42:26.300]  Tenth Amendment was enacted by folks who remembered what it was like to have a very oppressive
[2:42:26.300 --> 2:42:32.060]  government, to be under the thumb of tyrants and an all-powerful government.
[2:42:32.060 --> 2:42:41.100]  Unfortunately, the protections, it guarantees, have melted away over the course of the years.
[2:42:41.100 --> 2:42:47.460]  You're probably familiar with that old adage about how to boil a frog.
[2:42:47.460 --> 2:42:50.980]  You know, you just get him to sit there in that pot and you turn up the heat a little
[2:42:50.980 --> 2:42:56.020]  bit by a little bit, and before you know it, the frog doesn't realize it, but he's
[2:42:56.020 --> 2:42:58.060]  done.
[2:42:58.060 --> 2:43:05.900]  And since the United States Constitution was ratified, the federal government's been
[2:43:05.900 --> 2:43:13.180]  slowly kind of turning up the heat on the states, if you will, and they've eroded the
[2:43:13.180 --> 2:43:16.460]  notion of states' rights.
[2:43:16.460 --> 2:43:25.100]  The founding fathers understood that a one-size-approach doesn't work with the states when it comes
[2:43:25.100 --> 2:43:34.580]  to governing, especially a country the size of the United States.
[2:43:34.580 --> 2:43:38.060]  And I promise you, it doesn't work for Texas.
[2:43:38.060 --> 2:43:45.780]  Our economic strength, compared to the federal budget mess and other problems that they've
[2:43:45.780 --> 2:43:53.060]  got up there, is a great example that Texans know best how to govern Texas.
[2:43:53.060 --> 2:43:54.060]  We're proof.
[2:43:54.060 --> 2:43:57.500]  Now, meanwhile, Perry's been going along with the land grabbing, the roads being handed
[2:43:57.500 --> 2:44:02.820]  over to foreign countries, all of this, but at least he's got to come out now and sound
[2:44:02.820 --> 2:44:04.220]  like us.
[2:44:04.220 --> 2:44:08.700]  And in the Mayak Report, in the Virginia Terrorism Threat Assessment, in the new Homeland Security
[2:44:08.700 --> 2:44:14.140]  Report we got, that's now national news, they specifically named the states' rights, and
[2:44:14.140 --> 2:44:19.060]  they try to claim we're calling for secession, and they always misframe what we're saying.
[2:44:19.060 --> 2:44:23.340]  We're saying the states created the federal government, we can uncreate it and recreate
[2:44:23.340 --> 2:44:24.340]  it.
[2:44:24.340 --> 2:44:30.020]  But at this phase, all we're saying is, we're not under your unconstitutional control, right,
[2:44:30.020 --> 2:44:31.020]  Mr. Ruddy?
[2:44:31.020 --> 2:44:32.020]  Ruddy?
[2:44:32.020 --> 2:44:33.020]  Absolutely.
[2:44:33.020 --> 2:44:34.020]  You're absolutely right.
[2:44:34.020 --> 2:44:43.540]  We just want to put a check on their constitutional, what we've delegated to the federal government.
[2:44:43.540 --> 2:44:49.420]  All other powers belong to the states and the people, basically the 10th Amendment there.
[2:44:49.420 --> 2:44:51.620]  But the feds are completely out of control and don't care.
[2:44:51.620 --> 2:44:57.220]  So we have this, we have this collision coming and the establishment knows it's coming.
[2:44:57.220 --> 2:44:59.620]  How do you see this playing out, Walter?
[2:44:59.620 --> 2:45:05.700]  Well, I'm really hopeful just to see like the majority of the states now, and at least
[2:45:05.700 --> 2:45:12.820]  introducing this 10th Amendment resolutions, that means that we have a lot of support within
[2:45:12.820 --> 2:45:15.820]  our state legislators.
[2:45:15.820 --> 2:45:23.380]  And with this petition, this is a powerful weapon, I mean, the ones that aren't with
[2:45:23.380 --> 2:45:32.060]  us, this will, I think they'll vote for it and sponsor it just out of fear, but that
[2:45:32.060 --> 2:45:33.060]  they'll...
[2:45:33.060 --> 2:45:34.060]  Exactly.
[2:45:34.060 --> 2:45:38.140]  It makes them pick a side and show us who they're with.
[2:45:38.140 --> 2:45:41.820]  Again, fire out the website for the big event coming up this weekend.
[2:45:41.820 --> 2:45:42.820]  Okay.
[2:45:42.820 --> 2:45:50.460]  So you can go to committeesofsafety.org, we have a flyer on there, and I'd like to encourage
[2:45:50.460 --> 2:45:59.660]  your listeners, Alex, please join us, volunteer, sign up with us, doesn't cost anything, and
[2:45:59.660 --> 2:46:03.460]  get in this battle with us.
[2:46:03.460 --> 2:46:07.540]  Yeah, because this is a prototype of what you're doing with the Oathkeepers and others.
[2:46:07.540 --> 2:46:11.860]  You've got very prominent people coming to this who represent millions, the Rolling Thunder
[2:46:11.860 --> 2:46:13.700]  folks and all of them, are going to be...
[2:46:13.700 --> 2:46:18.660]  You need to really promote this, listeners, because we're reaching out to the military
[2:46:18.660 --> 2:46:20.060]  and police and giving them a choice.
[2:46:20.060 --> 2:46:22.060]  A lot of them haven't thought they have a choice.
[2:46:22.060 --> 2:46:26.900]  Do you want to be with the Republic, the Founders, Liberty, Freedom, Free Market, Decency, Honor,
[2:46:26.900 --> 2:46:30.940]  or do you want to be with the New World Order and give them that choice?
[2:46:30.940 --> 2:46:32.260]  The choice was always there.
[2:46:32.260 --> 2:46:34.860]  A lot of them just didn't really consciously think about it.
[2:46:34.860 --> 2:46:38.340]  We are presenting them that choice, and this is historical.
[2:46:38.340 --> 2:46:39.340]  Walter, ready?
[2:46:39.340 --> 2:46:40.340]  Thanks for joining us.
[2:46:40.340 --> 2:46:41.340]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:46:41.340 --> 2:46:42.340]  Okay.
[2:46:42.340 --> 2:46:44.580]  And listen, we'll talk to you after the event coming up.
[2:46:44.580 --> 2:46:46.940]  Thank you so much for inviting me there as well.
[2:46:46.940 --> 2:46:51.140]  Okay, I want to take your calls when we come back to the next segment.
[2:46:51.140 --> 2:46:55.060]  I just want to say this.
[2:46:55.060 --> 2:47:01.660]  We are at a crossroads, and I keep repeating that, but we're at a real crossroads here.
[2:47:01.660 --> 2:47:06.980]  The forces of corruption, control, dominance, usurpation are upon us.
[2:47:06.980 --> 2:47:07.980]  That's human history.
[2:47:07.980 --> 2:47:10.300]  That's the norm.
[2:47:10.300 --> 2:47:11.700]  Do you want to live under bondage?
[2:47:11.700 --> 2:47:19.260]  You don't know how good something is until it's gone, and being a slave is not fun.
[2:47:19.260 --> 2:47:23.260]  And a lot of people now are figuring out, this is serious, this isn't a joker again,
[2:47:23.260 --> 2:47:28.180]  and so they're finally waking up, but they're waking up kind of like a baby wakes up to
[2:47:28.180 --> 2:47:29.340]  the wider world.
[2:47:29.340 --> 2:47:33.420]  They still don't know exactly what's going on, and there to greet them is the controlled
[2:47:33.420 --> 2:47:36.460]  left, and there to greet them is the controlled right.
[2:47:36.460 --> 2:47:42.380]  There to greet them is the Fox News and the Sean Hannity's and the Glenbecks, and on the
[2:47:42.380 --> 2:47:48.420]  left is the era on the Huffington's and that fake revolution.
[2:47:48.420 --> 2:47:54.620]  George Soros, Ford Foundation, who's attacking me in big publications right now.
[2:47:54.620 --> 2:47:58.140]  And so you've got the foundation control left, you've got the corporate control right, but
[2:47:58.140 --> 2:48:03.140]  they're all counterfeits of what would really be going on regardless.
[2:48:03.140 --> 2:48:13.540]  And so there had been 400 years of war, more than 400 years of war, going back to the 1100s
[2:48:13.540 --> 2:48:19.580]  and 1200s in England under some of the most incredible oppression humanity's ever seen.
[2:48:19.580 --> 2:48:23.220]  England was like North Korea for hundreds of years.
[2:48:23.220 --> 2:48:27.660]  I mean, the literal lords would have sex with your wives whenever they wanted to as a joke.
[2:48:27.660 --> 2:48:29.900]  They called it, you know, breeding into your stock.
[2:48:29.900 --> 2:48:34.380]  They would keep you on enough land just to survive and take most of what you had.
[2:48:34.380 --> 2:48:39.140]  And they wrote about how it was meant to make you starve and control you.
[2:48:39.140 --> 2:48:43.020]  And people fought and died in England for 400 plus years.
[2:48:43.020 --> 2:48:47.220]  I mean, they had wars, the people rose up, the commoners, they grabbed the king, cut
[2:48:47.220 --> 2:48:51.900]  his head off, you know, threatened to cut his head off in another event.
[2:48:51.900 --> 2:48:56.700]  I mean, it was endless war with the elite coming back time and time again, and they
[2:48:56.700 --> 2:49:02.620]  got the Magna Carta, they got the parliament, and those ideas became a lot of the world.
[2:49:02.620 --> 2:49:04.500]  Not saying they're perfect.
[2:49:04.500 --> 2:49:09.500]  And it was the British idea, the common law in slavery, but they all said to blame England
[2:49:09.500 --> 2:49:14.540]  and the U.S. when it ended worldwide, still going on in Middle East in some cases, North
[2:49:14.540 --> 2:49:19.020]  Africa, but the point is with the Magna Carta saying, well, they deserve rights as well.
[2:49:19.020 --> 2:49:24.820]  First it was the king as God, everybody else is a slave, then it was the king is no longer
[2:49:24.820 --> 2:49:30.060]  God, and the nobles represent the people, and then it was no the people there on top
[2:49:30.060 --> 2:49:32.060]  of the king and everybody else.
[2:49:32.060 --> 2:49:40.940]  So there's that idea, and it's always a struggle between freedom and slavery, tyranny and liberty.
[2:49:40.940 --> 2:49:45.260]  There's always that, you know, tyranny and liberty are at odds against each other.
[2:49:45.260 --> 2:49:50.980]  You've got tyranny, corruption, bondage, control, slavery on one end, you've got liberty and
[2:49:50.980 --> 2:49:55.300]  freedom and decency, and the only problem with freedom and liberty and decency is it
[2:49:55.300 --> 2:50:00.180]  creates so much wealth so fast when people trust each other and can work together and
[2:50:00.180 --> 2:50:05.980]  have a good attitude, and when honor and intelligence and courage is honored, then your society
[2:50:05.980 --> 2:50:07.980]  goes to the stars.
[2:50:07.980 --> 2:50:13.580]  Government societies, elite societies, it's a bunch of spoiled frat boy wannabes ruling
[2:50:13.580 --> 2:50:18.620]  over you, hating you doing well and enjoying controlling you.
[2:50:18.620 --> 2:50:26.620]  So this is the big choice that everybody has, and our Constitution, our Bill of Rights,
[2:50:26.620 --> 2:50:30.980]  our Declaration of Independence, the militia, liberty, freedom, that's what we should all
[2:50:30.980 --> 2:50:33.540]  be pushing for.
[2:50:33.540 --> 2:50:38.860]  More freedom, less tyranny, and it shouldn't be labeled right wing or left wing, it should
[2:50:38.860 --> 2:50:46.260]  be labeled liberty versus tyranny, and now is the time, revolution is on, the establishment
[2:50:46.260 --> 2:50:50.940]  wants to use the revolution of people upset to misdirect that into building the New World
[2:50:50.940 --> 2:50:51.940]  Order.
[2:50:51.940 --> 2:50:56.380]  We need to go in and use this power vacuum to get our country back and cut government
[2:50:56.380 --> 2:51:01.340]  down to size, stay with us, we'll come right back with your calls.

[2:51:10.260 --> 2:51:12.100]  it to your dinner table?

[2:52:00.660 --> 2:52:06.060]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:52:06.060 --> 2:52:12.060]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[2:52:12.060 --> 2:52:14.100]  just as well funded.
[2:52:14.100 --> 2:52:19.220]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:52:19.220 --> 2:52:20.700]  of the American people.
[2:52:20.700 --> 2:52:25.100]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[2:52:25.100 --> 2:52:30.220]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:52:30.220 --> 2:52:36.740]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:52:36.740 --> 2:52:40.300]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[2:52:40.300 --> 2:52:47.220]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:53:54.380 --> 2:54:01.380]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[2:54:49.940 --> 2:54:53.380]  I don't have any audio here, I don't know what's going on today.
[2:54:53.380 --> 2:54:58.580]  There's a big conspiracy theory on the internet, people pass these videos around and they say
[2:54:58.580 --> 2:55:03.780]  who is Alex talking to, he's doing some code, because I'm sitting there talking on air,
[2:55:03.780 --> 2:55:10.500]  and then suddenly I reach over here and hit a button.
[2:55:10.500 --> 2:55:15.420]  That's where they can hear me in the control room, but you can't hear me.
[2:55:15.420 --> 2:55:19.900]  Like a caller will be talking and I'll go, you hit the button, but you can't hear me
[2:55:19.900 --> 2:55:24.380]  and I'll say, hey, I'm having a coffin fit, we bring me a glass of water in because I
[2:55:24.380 --> 2:55:25.860]  can't get up.
[2:55:25.860 --> 2:55:30.180]  And then people find me sitting there hitting the button where you can't hear me talking
[2:55:30.180 --> 2:55:31.380]  and they think it's a conspiracy.
[2:55:31.380 --> 2:55:35.140]  Folks, the conspiracies are open, they're right out in the open, it didn't Alex Jones.
[2:55:35.140 --> 2:55:39.740]  Now, I wanted to do a joke bit when we came back from break with my shirt off today, I've
[2:55:39.740 --> 2:55:45.020]  done this joke a couple of times, because that's how I feel.
[2:55:45.020 --> 2:55:51.620]  I paid the income tax today and they've gotten rid of most of the ride-offs, even for equipment
[2:55:51.620 --> 2:55:54.340]  and things.
[2:55:54.340 --> 2:55:59.580]  And so it's just hardly have any money left over to even expand the office.
[2:55:59.580 --> 2:56:03.860]  I mean, I try to spend almost all my money just to run the operation, because that's
[2:56:03.860 --> 2:56:09.980]  what I'm doing this for, but also I have the pleasure of not paying that much taxes.
[2:56:09.980 --> 2:56:13.620]  But that's why most Americans, what is the 80 something percent, have it taken out as
[2:56:13.620 --> 2:56:18.460]  withholding, and they bragged they did that in the 40s, so you wouldn't notice what was
[2:56:18.460 --> 2:56:19.460]  happening.
[2:56:19.460 --> 2:56:24.860]  In fact, up on infowars.com guys, I have the Donald Duck cartoon, it's a five minute thing
[2:56:24.860 --> 2:56:30.540]  about kill Hitler, pay your taxes, income taxes, income taxes, it's to fight Hitler,
[2:56:30.540 --> 2:56:33.660]  but notice they kept it after the war.
[2:56:33.660 --> 2:56:38.580]  This is the type of propaganda they use, but I make the joke that people could see themselves
[2:56:38.580 --> 2:56:41.220]  having their literal shirt off their backs taken.
[2:56:41.220 --> 2:56:45.060]  But a lot of folks don't have enough money to pay for their houses and their cars, even
[2:56:45.060 --> 2:56:50.380]  live modestly, and now they're so broke, or they lost their job and then had spent all
[2:56:50.380 --> 2:56:53.700]  their extra money that they have no money to pay the tax man Reuters reported.
[2:56:53.700 --> 2:56:57.860]  The tax man says, sorry, you're going to pay it, so see if you're made off or any of these
[2:56:57.860 --> 2:56:59.380]  guys, you're okay.
[2:56:59.380 --> 2:57:02.300]  So our money's going to all these criminal bankers, and meanwhile a lot of folks can't
[2:57:02.300 --> 2:57:05.820]  even pay the tax to the private fellow reserve.
[2:57:05.820 --> 2:57:08.460]  Not one run sitting, your income tax goes around the country, it goes to pay interest
[2:57:08.460 --> 2:57:11.340]  on the debt to the private bankers.
[2:57:11.340 --> 2:57:14.460]  So yeah, look at the guys in there.
[2:57:14.460 --> 2:57:19.140]  They are shirtless as well.
[2:57:19.140 --> 2:57:21.780]  That's the office of Paul Hartman and Jared Neyhart.
[2:57:21.780 --> 2:57:26.740]  Guys, oh wait a minute, I see one of you still has a shirt, so I guess Big Brother didn't
[2:57:26.740 --> 2:57:27.740]  take it all.
[2:57:27.740 --> 2:57:31.540]  Oh my gosh, this is ridiculous.
[2:57:31.540 --> 2:57:32.540]  That's enough.
[2:57:32.540 --> 2:57:33.540]  That's enough.
[2:57:33.540 --> 2:57:39.140]  I've been, you know, thank you guys, anything to illustrate how ridiculous this is.
[2:57:39.140 --> 2:57:40.540]  What gets taken out of your paycheck?
[2:57:40.540 --> 2:57:41.540]  Probably what?
[2:57:41.540 --> 2:57:43.260]  30% of what you're made?
[2:57:43.260 --> 2:57:47.260]  I sign your paychecks around here, and then I got to match your social security, which
[2:57:47.260 --> 2:57:48.260]  you'll never see.
[2:57:48.260 --> 2:57:55.060]  You know, let's say after FICA and Medicare and Medicaid and what you supposedly pay for
[2:57:55.060 --> 2:58:00.100]  social security, that's about 10% on average.
[2:58:00.100 --> 2:58:02.140]  I got to match that.
[2:58:02.140 --> 2:58:06.020]  So let's say you get paid 13, 14 bucks an hour, okay?
[2:58:06.020 --> 2:58:12.500]  That's another, and then I got to pay a couple bucks of that extra on top of that just in
[2:58:12.500 --> 2:58:15.300]  the matching for the social security.
[2:58:15.300 --> 2:58:16.380]  And then it doesn't go to that.
[2:58:16.380 --> 2:58:17.780]  It goes right to the private bankers.
[2:58:17.780 --> 2:58:20.340]  You put it in their private bank accounts and then loan the money back to us.
[2:58:20.340 --> 2:58:24.220]  All right, I'm going to talk to Joshua, Mark, Daniel, Laura, Tim, Dave, and others.
[2:58:24.220 --> 2:58:32.100]  Your calls are coming up, and you know, I got a guest coming up dealing with secret
[2:58:32.100 --> 2:58:37.060]  mysteries, DVDs, but I may just cancel him, because this is Tax Day, and I know folks
[2:58:37.060 --> 2:58:38.060]  want to talk.
[2:58:38.060 --> 2:58:39.580]  We're just going to move that guest.
[2:58:39.580 --> 2:58:43.060]  Nobody's going to get mad, but say, lovey.
[2:58:43.060 --> 2:58:46.060]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:46.060 --> 2:58:51.380]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:51.380 --> 2:58:52.380]  Hello, friends.
[2:58:52.380 --> 2:58:53.380]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:58:53.380 --> 2:58:56.820]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[2:58:56.820 --> 2:58:57.820]  important than ever.
[2:58:57.820 --> 2:59:00.820]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[2:59:00.820 --> 2:59:03.620]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[2:59:03.620 --> 2:59:07.500]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[2:59:07.500 --> 2:59:09.900]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[2:59:09.900 --> 2:59:13.180]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation with you.
[2:59:13.180 --> 2:59:17.540]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli,
[2:59:17.540 --> 2:59:21.220]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the
[2:59:21.220 --> 2:59:23.420]  cost of last year's grocery prices.
[2:59:23.420 --> 2:59:28.780]  Call 1-800-409-5633, or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:59:28.780 --> 2:59:33.460]  At eFoodsDirect.com, look over the final list of high-quality, pre-stried, and dehydrated
[2:59:33.460 --> 2:59:34.780]  foods they have to offer.

[2:59:40.780 --> 2:59:46.300]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:59:46.300 --> 2:59:47.300]  Take action today.
[2:59:47.300 --> 2:59:54.220]  The first step is getting storable food.
[2:59:54.220 --> 2:59:56.420]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:59:56.420 --> 2:59:59.420]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:59:59.420 --> 3:00:07.860]  All right, it's already the final hour.
[3:00:07.860 --> 3:00:17.620]  I had Chris Pinto joining us today.
[3:00:17.620 --> 3:00:20.220]  Secret Mysteries revealed.
[3:00:20.220 --> 3:00:21.220]  Great three-part film.
[3:00:21.220 --> 3:00:26.060]  We have it at eFoodWars.com, and I apologize to him, but I've got our reporters coming up
[3:00:26.060 --> 3:00:29.660]  in about 30 minutes from on the ground in San Antonio, where the Tea Party's kicking
[3:00:29.660 --> 3:00:34.860]  off with Lord Beck, and I want to take your phone call, so we're going to move Mr. Pinto
[3:00:34.860 --> 3:00:35.860]  to next week.
[3:00:35.860 --> 3:00:38.700]  And then I'm going to play some more propaganda later.
[3:00:38.700 --> 3:00:43.820]  Donald Duck pressed into service to brainwash the public.
[3:00:43.820 --> 3:00:47.620]  So we'll be going over that until they use your tax money to finance this type of crap.
[3:00:47.620 --> 3:00:51.060]  That's why the public's so dumbed down.
[3:00:51.060 --> 3:00:58.020]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:00:58.020 --> 3:01:00.580]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joshua in California.
[3:01:00.580 --> 3:01:01.580]  You're on the air, sir.
[3:01:01.580 --> 3:01:02.580]  Hey, Alex.
[3:01:02.580 --> 3:01:03.580]  Wow.
[3:01:03.580 --> 3:01:06.700]  I just want to say what an honor it is to talk to you.
[3:01:06.700 --> 3:01:11.180]  I'm a prison planet member, and anyone else that's listening for not a member, you should
[3:01:11.180 --> 3:01:14.660]  totally support Alex.
[3:01:14.660 --> 3:01:19.780]  You've totally, you know, you talk about the moral compass, and you give us, you know,
[3:01:19.780 --> 3:01:20.780]  direction.
[3:01:20.780 --> 3:01:22.180]  You're putting things in perspective.
[3:01:22.180 --> 3:01:25.700]  You can see where you are in the world, and, you know, you really help my life a lot with
[3:01:25.700 --> 3:01:26.700]  that.
[3:01:26.700 --> 3:01:32.980]  I spoke to Burma a couple of weeks ago about my dad was best friends with Peter Grace, one
[3:01:32.980 --> 3:01:37.500]  of the founding members of the Bilderberg, and, you know, those, like all this stuff
[3:01:37.500 --> 3:01:41.900]  you, you know, you're illuminating people about, you know, about the occult and bird
[3:01:41.900 --> 3:01:47.460]  flu and, you know, and, you know, these elitists are trying to, like, steal our money with
[3:01:47.460 --> 3:01:54.180]  these taxes, all this stuff to fund, you know, like you said, our own, you know, their eugenic
[3:01:54.180 --> 3:01:55.180]  plans.
[3:01:55.180 --> 3:01:56.900]  It's just, it's crazy.
[3:01:56.900 --> 3:02:01.140]  And I'm going to be printing up flyers that I got of your broadcast.
[3:02:01.140 --> 3:02:02.140]  They have them online.
[3:02:02.140 --> 3:02:08.580]  Now it's shown to flyers and going to the tea party and passing them out and stuff, and
[3:02:08.580 --> 3:02:11.380]  I just want to say thank you so much.
[3:02:11.380 --> 3:02:16.060]  And one other thing, if I could, in California, they've passed the law already.
[3:02:16.060 --> 3:02:22.060]  A lot of people don't know about where they're even outlawing, um, uh, fireplaces, just wood-burning
[3:02:22.060 --> 3:02:23.060]  fireplaces.
[3:02:23.060 --> 3:02:24.660]  You can't, they're not being permitted anymore.
[3:02:24.660 --> 3:02:26.660]  If you want to build a house, you can't have a fireplace.
[3:02:26.660 --> 3:02:30.940]  No, Europe, Europe is saying they got to close them up in a bunch of countries, and they're
[3:02:30.940 --> 3:02:35.420]  about banning outdoor space eaters, saying it's the carbon footprint.
[3:02:35.420 --> 3:02:39.500]  That's what, uh, the Obama deception covers, is this is total serfdom.
[3:02:39.500 --> 3:02:40.500]  This is feudalism.
[3:02:40.500 --> 3:02:42.940]  When I say serfdom and feudalism, I don't just mean slavery.
[3:02:42.940 --> 3:02:47.140]  It was a system of keeping you under their full control.
[3:02:47.140 --> 3:02:54.460]  Like, it's completely true, I mean, like you're saying, they have this system in place for
[3:02:54.460 --> 3:03:00.220]  so many years, you know, that, um, that they're just trying to, you know, just control people
[3:03:00.220 --> 3:03:05.380]  and just, I mean, you read about the thickness that all that these, that these like monarchs
[3:03:05.380 --> 3:03:09.340]  and the Black nobility have, and, you know, everyone just thinks it just disappears, you
[3:03:09.340 --> 3:03:13.580]  know, like when they get, when they get their power in place, when they become more powerful,
[3:03:13.580 --> 3:03:16.700]  that they just all of a sudden become, become good guys, you know.
[3:03:16.700 --> 3:03:19.780]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, they tell the public that elites don't exist.
[3:03:19.780 --> 3:03:23.500]  They just say, oh, everything's happy, the government only loves you, there's no corruption,
[3:03:23.500 --> 3:03:26.860]  and then under this national security umbrella, they've been doing it whatever they want,
[3:03:26.860 --> 3:03:31.500]  since 47, and then now they're on the news saying, we've got upper strict guns in America
[3:03:31.500 --> 3:03:34.620]  because of Mexico, Mexico has a total gun ban.
[3:03:34.620 --> 3:03:37.580]  I mean, they need to decriminalize drugs right now.
[3:03:37.580 --> 3:03:42.540]  That's what's going to end all this, but, and then they know that they create the crises
[3:03:42.540 --> 3:03:47.580]  to offer the solution, and the globalists have made big moves the last century four
[3:03:47.580 --> 3:03:51.980]  or five times and killed 200 million people, and I've seen that attack profile.
[3:03:51.980 --> 3:03:56.620]  They're clearly trying that attack profile now to radically over, it's their revolution
[3:03:56.620 --> 3:04:00.900]  to overthrow Europe, overthrow the United States, fully enslave us.
[3:04:00.900 --> 3:04:02.420]  They want a hot revolution.
[3:04:02.420 --> 3:04:06.260]  They've been building up incrementally, but it's just like putting a piece of paper on
[3:04:06.260 --> 3:04:11.340]  top of flame, at first it browns and yellows, and then browns and cracks, and then boom,
[3:04:11.340 --> 3:04:13.340]  it flashes, flashpoint.
[3:04:13.340 --> 3:04:20.300]  And right now, the free world is like a brown piece of cooked wood or paper that's about
[3:04:20.300 --> 3:04:24.540]  to flash into flame, and we've seen other parts of the world flash into flame, and we
[3:04:24.540 --> 3:04:28.740]  know what this looks like, and I'm going, get ready, and coming, it's coming in, and
[3:04:28.740 --> 3:04:33.380]  people are like, yeah, it is bad, the tyranny's bad, just the lead vanguard of breakers in
[3:04:33.380 --> 3:04:37.820]  this wave, and I'm like, no, look out to sea, and they're like, my God, it's a 500-foot
[3:04:37.820 --> 3:04:43.780]  tsunami, and I'm like, absolutely, get ready, ladies and gentlemen, tyranny is upon us.
[3:04:43.780 --> 3:04:49.100]  And I tell the police and military, they're forming you up in blocks to march out against
[3:04:49.100 --> 3:04:50.100]  the people.
[3:04:50.100 --> 3:04:52.940]  This isn't the Soviet Union or Germany or China.
[3:04:52.940 --> 3:04:56.940]  You are going to be absolutely annihilated, and so are the people, it is going to be
[3:04:56.940 --> 3:04:59.380]  a bloodbath.
[3:04:59.380 --> 3:05:00.540]  How do we avert this?
[3:05:00.540 --> 3:05:02.100]  How do we stop it?
[3:05:02.100 --> 3:05:04.620]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[3:05:04.620 --> 3:05:09.420]  You might not be able to spell Constitution, but you sure know how important it is.
[3:05:09.420 --> 3:05:13.380]  You might not be missing any shirts from your closet, but you have given the shirt off your
[3:05:13.380 --> 3:05:15.580]  back hundreds of times.
[3:05:15.580 --> 3:05:19.820]  You might not understand the thousands of laws that exist, but you do live by the Ten
[3:05:19.820 --> 3:05:20.820]  Commandments.
[3:05:20.820 --> 3:05:24.900]  You might not know who the bad guys are, or what you should be complaining about, but
[3:05:24.900 --> 3:05:27.140]  you do know what to be thankful for.
[3:05:27.140 --> 3:05:30.980]  You might not be looking for a government handout, but you do know how to lend a helping
[3:05:30.980 --> 3:05:31.980]  hand.
[3:05:31.980 --> 3:05:37.260]  For eFoodsDirect.com, there might be a lot that you don't know, but you do know that

[3:06:02.060 --> 3:06:07.420]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:06:07.420 --> 3:06:13.460]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:06:13.460 --> 3:06:15.460]  just as well-funded.
[3:06:15.460 --> 3:06:20.620]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:06:20.620 --> 3:06:22.120]  of the American people.
[3:06:22.120 --> 3:06:26.500]  Now Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:06:26.500 --> 3:06:31.620]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:06:31.620 --> 3:06:38.140]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:06:38.140 --> 3:06:41.700]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:06:41.700 --> 3:06:48.620]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:06:56.780 --> 3:07:00.020]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:07:00.020 --> 3:07:05.460]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock, and what I'm about to tell you is true.

[3:07:55.220 --> 3:08:03.100]  That's 1-800-605-4229, again 1-800-605-4229.
[3:08:03.100 --> 3:08:09.660]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:08:09.660 --> 3:08:14.020]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:14.020 --> 3:08:16.780]  Why do they call it a spirit?
[3:08:16.780 --> 3:08:17.780]  I'm 1776.
[3:08:17.780 --> 3:08:29.620]  It's a attitude, a mindset, and yes, liberty, freedom, justice is a spirit.
[3:08:29.620 --> 3:08:35.060]  You can boil it down to science, almost like a wavelength that mammals put off for other
[3:08:35.060 --> 3:08:36.060]  creatures.
[3:08:36.060 --> 3:08:40.660]  How does a rat know when a tornado has come in two days before?
[3:08:40.660 --> 3:08:45.980]  It knows in its gut it has how the birds know how to fly thousands of miles that have hatched
[3:08:45.980 --> 3:08:50.220]  out a few months before out of eggs, and they know how to fly without their parents, you
[3:08:50.220 --> 3:08:54.820]  know, three or four thousand miles to another continent.
[3:08:54.820 --> 3:08:59.740]  Call it spirit, call it stuff about our brains we don't understand, things unknown, whatever.
[3:08:59.740 --> 3:09:01.580]  It's a spirit of liberty.
[3:09:01.580 --> 3:09:05.740]  That's why they have a spirit of darkness, 50 million abortions, corruption, police and
[3:09:05.740 --> 3:09:08.740]  black uniforms, everybody wearing skulls and death.
[3:09:08.740 --> 3:09:11.660]  All these trappings mean something.
[3:09:11.660 --> 3:09:17.420]  It's a spirit of bondage, a spirit of destruction, a spirit of death and fire.
[3:09:17.420 --> 3:09:23.900]  That's not the spirit I like, and I know the spirit of liberty and honor is much stronger,
[3:09:23.900 --> 3:09:27.980]  and the Satanists and the Luciferians go to the dark side believing, you know, it has
[3:09:27.980 --> 3:09:35.140]  all this power, and I guess in a way it does give them a petty power the moment they flip
[3:09:35.140 --> 3:09:36.140]  it on.
[3:09:36.140 --> 3:09:40.460]  The moment you flip the switch into evil, it's there.
[3:09:40.460 --> 3:09:43.580]  Goodness takes sacrifice, goodness takes commitment.
[3:09:43.580 --> 3:09:49.700]  Goodness means you have to go through tribulation, you have to go through fear, and it's a test,
[3:09:49.700 --> 3:09:57.300]  and you, like with all things, it progresses, and it gets better and better as you stand
[3:09:57.300 --> 3:10:00.700]  up for what's right, studying evil, which I've done.
[3:10:00.700 --> 3:10:06.420]  It's better up front and then gets worse, you understand how that works?
[3:10:06.420 --> 3:10:11.300]  Whereas goodness is really hard up front, but gets better as you get deeper into it
[3:10:11.300 --> 3:10:18.300]  and lay your life down, lay your name down, and that's why the establishment back in
[3:10:18.300 --> 3:10:24.300]  the 40s, they'd had the income tax since 1913, but nobody had, you know, maybe 1% tax rate
[3:10:24.300 --> 3:10:28.340]  for a small group of people just getting it set up and everybody trained, because people
[3:10:28.340 --> 3:10:32.700]  wouldn't pay it, they wouldn't put up with it, they tried, but they got them too in 1943,
[3:10:32.700 --> 3:10:38.060]  the Spirit of 43, and Milton Friedman said, we'll just do withholding from all their factory
[3:10:38.060 --> 3:10:39.060]  checks.
[3:10:39.060 --> 3:10:48.820]  We'll say it's treason if you don't pay, and if the companies don't take the money out,
[3:10:48.820 --> 3:10:51.340]  and they said it was to fight the war when the government could issue its own currency
[3:10:51.340 --> 3:10:57.180]  to begin with, and of course, it was a good war against Hitler, until you realize that
[3:10:57.180 --> 3:10:59.540]  Hitler was set up by British and U.S. intelligence.
[3:10:59.540 --> 3:11:01.660]  Now, does that mean you didn't have to be fought?
[3:11:01.660 --> 3:11:06.900]  They create these boogeymen that come after you, but they set him up just like they set
[3:11:06.900 --> 3:11:07.900]  up the Communist.
[3:11:07.900 --> 3:11:09.620]  That's now declassified on record.
[3:11:09.620 --> 3:11:10.620]  Let's go to the calls.
[3:11:10.620 --> 3:11:12.060]  Mark in Oregon, you're on the air.
[3:11:12.060 --> 3:11:13.060]  Go ahead.
[3:11:13.060 --> 3:11:14.060]  Hi, Alex.
[3:11:14.060 --> 3:11:17.060]  How are you doing today?
[3:11:17.060 --> 3:11:18.060]  Good, Mark.
[3:11:18.060 --> 3:11:24.940]  Alex, actually, I have two heartfelt suggestions here for you today and wanted to give them
[3:11:24.940 --> 3:11:29.100]  to you and be most interested to hear your comment about them.
[3:11:29.100 --> 3:11:32.380]  First one is that you have a money bomb.
[3:11:32.380 --> 3:11:36.700]  Last time I made that request a couple of months ago, you said that that was definitely
[3:11:36.700 --> 3:11:40.980]  on the front burner, but I understand there can be complications and such like that, but
[3:11:40.980 --> 3:11:43.660]  I don't really like asking.
[3:11:43.660 --> 3:11:50.740]  I'm trying to finish the projects I've got, and believe it or not, we've got 7,800 square
[3:11:50.740 --> 3:11:51.740]  foot office.
[3:11:51.740 --> 3:11:53.460]  I do know that.
[3:11:53.460 --> 3:11:55.460]  And we've already filled it up with equipment and stuff.
[3:11:55.460 --> 3:11:59.220]  I've got a little area for the TV studio, I'm trying to build it, but the space right
[3:11:59.220 --> 3:12:04.140]  next to us, we're in the cheapest stuff in Austin, out on the edge of town, industrial
[3:12:04.140 --> 3:12:08.220]  area, and they've rented out everything but the space right next to us, and they just
[3:12:08.220 --> 3:12:10.300]  offered us that at half price.
[3:12:10.300 --> 3:12:14.980]  I may have to do a money bomb just to ensure I had two, three years of rent for that and
[3:12:14.980 --> 3:12:18.620]  to put in the proper equipment, but then we can go to the whole next level if the money
[3:12:18.620 --> 3:12:22.420]  bomb brought in $200,000 or so, because then I'd spend it all to make sure we didn't have
[3:12:22.420 --> 3:12:27.860]  to spend, you know, pay taxes on it, but the way they make you amortize out equipment,
[3:12:27.860 --> 3:12:32.060]  I have to go ahead and pay tax on equipment I bought that first and second year and then
[3:12:32.060 --> 3:12:34.780]  down the road take it as a tax break, you know.
[3:12:34.780 --> 3:12:42.140]  So again, I buy a computer, a $5,000 computer and a $1,000 software, and I've got to amortize
[3:12:42.140 --> 3:12:46.540]  it out over two or three years, you know, schedule it out, but people say, oh, just
[3:12:46.540 --> 3:12:47.700]  don't pay them, Alex.
[3:12:47.700 --> 3:12:53.220]  Oh, like Dick Simcannon of Arrow Custom Plastics, everybody else, and I mean, there's people
[3:12:53.220 --> 3:12:57.820]  just speaking out against the IRS being arrested for it, you know, like Erwin Schiff, Peter
[3:12:57.820 --> 3:13:02.340]  Schiff's dad, and Joe Bannister and Sherry Jackson and all of them, and these people
[3:13:02.340 --> 3:13:06.660]  don't play games, so I'm picking my fight, you know, I mean, I'm picking the fights
[3:13:06.660 --> 3:13:11.300]  I'm going to have, I'm not picking a fight with the IRS, I'm following all their stupid
[3:13:11.300 --> 3:13:16.220]  phony regulations and laws, it's just that I haven't really wanted to do a money bomb,
[3:13:16.220 --> 3:13:20.660]  but we've decided to do a money bomb, and funny you called, I finally said yesterday,
[3:13:20.660 --> 3:13:24.260]  I keep procrastinating, launch the money bomb, and are we going to have that ready to launch
[3:13:24.260 --> 3:13:27.460]  by Friday of the date of the money bomb?
[3:13:27.460 --> 3:13:29.700]  I'm going to go ahead and announce it now, it's the only way to get things down around
[3:13:29.700 --> 3:13:32.860]  here, people will just keep procrastinating, because I want to just have a basic little
[3:13:32.860 --> 3:13:40.200]  widget and you think we've got all this technological skill here that just shows as people sign
[3:13:40.200 --> 3:13:49.180]  up, you know, that Billy Bob from Texas has pledged to give on the money bomb date, and
[3:13:49.180 --> 3:13:54.380]  so we need to do that, and so you know what, we're going to have the money bomb on the,
[3:13:54.380 --> 3:13:57.380]  what's the 20th of May?
[3:13:57.380 --> 3:13:58.380]  Isn't that a Wednesday?
[3:13:58.380 --> 3:14:02.540]  So, we'll go ahead and announce the money bomb, I've got to go ahead and announce there
[3:14:02.540 --> 3:14:07.340]  isn't going to happen, that's just how it works around here, but anything else, sir?
[3:14:07.340 --> 3:14:12.420]  Yes, Alex, thank God for that, and I know it'll be a great success because I believe
[3:14:12.420 --> 3:14:18.820]  you pulled in $250,000 last time, and the world's gotten a lot worse as far as the manifestation
[3:14:18.820 --> 3:14:24.820]  of evil between them and now, I think people are just like I said before, Alex, you know,
[3:14:24.820 --> 3:14:29.300]  just really happy to be behind our cause, because you're at the tip of the spear on
[3:14:29.300 --> 3:14:33.380]  the good side, and we're right behind you, and I think it'll happen all over again at
[3:14:33.380 --> 3:14:34.380]  least as much.
[3:14:34.380 --> 3:14:41.460]  I wanted to add in Alex, really my main point for calling today, and that is Mr. Reddy,
[3:14:41.460 --> 3:14:47.380]  you know, he said that they really need you at Lexington, and Alex, you should go because
[3:14:47.380 --> 3:14:53.700]  you're a leader, and you're an inspirational and unifying force, this is where the American
[3:14:53.700 --> 3:14:59.500]  Revolution was born, this place has a lot of power from the past and right into the
[3:14:59.500 --> 3:15:05.700]  present, and a one or two hour documentary could be made of a speech by you at the assembly
[3:15:05.700 --> 3:15:11.540]  there, please let me finish, as well as what the Info War already is planning to do in
[3:15:11.540 --> 3:15:16.900]  doing on-site coverage of the most important event, really, which is potentially a large
[3:15:16.900 --> 3:15:23.180]  and national first step in regaining our Constitutional Republic, Alex, this is a very important event,
[3:15:23.180 --> 3:15:27.660]  and it's more important than a few interviews, what you can get back to as soon as you get
[3:15:27.660 --> 3:15:31.740]  back, it'll only take a day or two out of your time, I'm begging you, please, to go
[3:15:31.740 --> 3:15:36.900]  Alex, Mr. this man, these people have set this up, they're getting out there, this
[3:15:36.900 --> 3:15:42.460]  is the event, Alex, please recognize it as such, please reconsider your decision on this
[3:15:42.460 --> 3:15:45.300]  and please pray about it, and God bless you, sir.
[3:15:45.300 --> 3:15:50.860]  Mark, God bless you, look, look, I had the health keepers on here, and they were already
[3:15:50.860 --> 3:15:56.260]  getting big, Jack McClam pointed about to me, we plugged them here, and Rhodes and others
[3:15:56.260 --> 3:15:59.260]  have told me it really exploded after that, but that's just because we've got great activist
[3:15:59.260 --> 3:16:04.140]  listeners, you made it explode, and we posted their videos and all that to try to promote
[3:16:04.140 --> 3:16:09.620]  them, and I'm having them on, promoting their event, and I know Lexington is important, if
[3:16:09.620 --> 3:16:16.260]  I'm going to release an Obama film by July 4th, if I'm going to continue on my program
[3:16:16.260 --> 3:16:22.100]  and my operation, I mean, I turned down going to England and Europe and Japan to speak to
[3:16:22.100 --> 3:16:27.380]  their parliament, I turned down, I was invited to speak to the Japanese parliament, I remember
[3:16:27.380 --> 3:16:31.500]  the parliament, I get invited everywhere, you don't think I don't want to see Japan,
[3:16:31.500 --> 3:16:36.340]  you don't think I don't want to, I mean, I would love it to walk away from this radio
[3:16:36.340 --> 3:16:40.940]  show, it's a ball and chain, really, four hours a day, and then I'm going to be on a
[3:16:40.940 --> 3:16:49.500]  couple shows tonight, Steve Quail and others, I mean, again, I would love to go to this
[3:16:49.500 --> 3:16:55.620]  event, I've been invited to go and speak, I'm sending two people, and that's where
[3:16:55.620 --> 3:17:01.500]  we need funds, it costs money to do all this, I'm sending two people so that we can put
[3:17:01.500 --> 3:17:10.340]  other, we need to make it about making other people leaders, like Scott Rhodes, Edwin Vieira,
[3:17:10.340 --> 3:17:15.060]  and others, I mean, I'm here to lift up people who I believe are good and decent and honorable,
[3:17:15.060 --> 3:17:19.540]  I've tried to lift up other people in the past, it turned out to be mentally ill, but
[3:17:19.540 --> 3:17:24.940]  I've got a little bit better discernment over the years, because for me, this isn't about
[3:17:24.940 --> 3:17:29.980]  Alex Jones being the leader, you know, I get invited to speak all the time too, and a few
[3:17:29.980 --> 3:17:34.460]  times I do show up, then there's always a little squabble with some of the organizers
[3:17:34.460 --> 3:17:38.220]  going, he's too radical, we don't want him, and a lot of times I'll just go, you know,
[3:17:38.220 --> 3:17:41.540]  my car's over there, I'm going to go ahead and go, and then they'll be at my car begging
[3:17:41.540 --> 3:17:45.820]  me to go speak, and I'm just like, I don't care about speaking to a crowd of people.
[3:17:45.820 --> 3:17:53.140]  See, people get this kind of mixed up, primitively, folks get really excited speaking to a big
[3:17:53.140 --> 3:17:57.500]  crowd of folks, I mean, I've seen people in front of a crowd of 1,000 people, I mean,
[3:17:57.500 --> 3:18:00.980]  it's like this primitive monkey-ism or something like, oh my God, I'm just because, you know,
[3:18:00.980 --> 3:18:06.860]  I'm like, I'm the tribal leader, oh my God, I consciously realized that talking on radio
[3:18:06.860 --> 3:18:12.260]  and TV, reaching millions, I mean, that's no hype folks that three weeks ago, well three
[3:18:12.260 --> 3:18:17.420]  weeks into the release a week ago of the Obama deception, I spent a couple hours counting
[3:18:17.420 --> 3:18:21.820]  up all the views on different video sites, it was over 15 million, that was 10 million
[3:18:21.820 --> 3:18:26.220]  a week before that, I haven't counted it up, it's impossible to now, I mean, a million
[3:18:26.220 --> 3:18:30.660]  here, 2 million there, a million and a half here, a million, 300,000 there, 400,000 here,
[3:18:30.660 --> 3:18:37.100]  200,000 there, 20,000 here, 80,000 there, 15 million people, I made a film shattering
[3:18:37.100 --> 3:18:45.820]  the left-right paradigm, and it's been seen for free by 15 million people, I mean, that's
[3:18:45.820 --> 3:18:51.340]  doing damage to the New World Order folks, that's doing damage to the New World Order,
[3:18:51.340 --> 3:18:57.300]  I mean, I am in there, reaching 15 million people, they're now awake to go be part of
[3:18:57.300 --> 3:19:04.020]  the Tea Parties or to go be part of Oathkeepers or to go be part of Civil Defense or the Minutemen
[3:19:04.020 --> 3:19:11.140]  or Second Amendment groups, and I say, okay, I got to make another film, it's kind of like
[3:19:11.140 --> 3:19:14.860]  I'm a boxer, and I'm going up against this really big opponent, and I'm hitting him,
[3:19:14.860 --> 3:19:18.340]  and hitting him, he's starting to get dizzy, it looks like I got him, I got about 30 seconds
[3:19:18.340 --> 3:19:21.860]  till that bell rings, and he may come out of that corner if I don't knock him out now
[3:19:21.860 --> 3:19:26.060]  and beat me in the next round, because I'm getting tired, and I can run off and try to
[3:19:26.060 --> 3:19:31.740]  fight some other opponent, no, I know what I'm doing, I'm just, I'm going to keep swinging
[3:19:31.740 --> 3:19:35.940]  and pounding with the radio interviews and the films, I'm just going to, boom, boom,
[3:19:35.940 --> 3:19:42.580]  I'm going to give everything I got, try to end this fight right now, not going to hesitate,
[3:19:42.580 --> 3:19:46.260]  I know there's all this lore and everything about Lexington, and that's good, that's for
[3:19:46.260 --> 3:19:51.860]  these men to be part of that, and to have those police and military there drinking deeply
[3:19:51.860 --> 3:19:56.340]  from the spirit of liberty, and affirming themselves on the path to victory against
[3:19:56.340 --> 3:20:02.220]  tyranny, that is their road, I go down another road, stay with us.

[3:21:27.420 --> 3:21:31.740]  States Government Accountability Office, the GAO has published the long term fiscal outlook
[3:21:31.740 --> 3:21:35.900]  document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control,
[3:21:35.900 --> 3:21:41.740]  this will directly affect programs like social security to FDIC's ability to ensure bank deposits,
[3:21:41.740 --> 3:21:46.940]  taxation and inflationary printing of the US dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.

[3:22:05.020 --> 3:22:10.460]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of
[3:22:10.460 --> 3:22:16.300]  a world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys
[3:22:16.300 --> 3:22:21.100]  the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's
[3:22:21.100 --> 3:22:26.780]  already fudging, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical
[3:22:26.780 --> 3:22:32.620]  mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[3:22:32.620 --> 3:22:40.220]  bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left to right, it's about a one
[3:22:40.220 --> 3:22:47.660]  world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:24:44.860 --> 3:24:49.900]  coming for you tyrants and you know it. Patriots just got to keep the eye of the tiger folks.
[3:24:49.900 --> 3:25:01.340]  Here it is for you.
[3:25:40.860 --> 3:25:41.660]  You know you love it.
[3:25:41.660 --> 3:25:53.020]  No, you trade your passion for glory. I tried folks. It was so easy for me not to sell out when I
[3:25:53.020 --> 3:25:57.660]  was offered millions of dollars years ago to be the big national host and be a neocon. I just said
[3:25:57.660 --> 3:26:03.020]  no. They couldn't believe I said no and I've said no repeatedly to deal after deal because it's who I
[3:26:03.020 --> 3:26:08.540]  am. It's what I stand for. That's what this is all about and that's what it should be about for you
[3:26:08.540 --> 3:26:13.260]  and that's when you're going to be fulfilled. All this crap of money. I mean what is this?
[3:26:13.900 --> 3:26:19.100]  What is money? It's just fiat stuff that they bought up our world with and they've got their
[3:26:19.100 --> 3:26:24.140]  old seeing eye. Their symbol on it. They didn't put on the money until 1913 when they took over.
[3:26:24.140 --> 3:26:27.260]  They said hey baby we're running things now and they put this on there.
[3:26:29.660 --> 3:26:35.100]  This is a bunch of crap. This is the system of bondage. People sell out their families.
[3:26:35.100 --> 3:26:43.100]  They'll do anything for this crud. That's all it is. It's crud. It's a fiat fraudulent system.
[3:26:43.100 --> 3:26:49.420]  These dirtbag scam artist bankers run our society through this because they get us to accept this
[3:26:50.220 --> 3:26:55.980]  and we give away our birthright and the engine of liberty and wealth for this fiat crap and now
[3:26:55.980 --> 3:27:00.620]  they're butchering us and stealing everything we've got in the final phase of world government.
[3:27:00.620 --> 3:27:04.540]  For the world government to be built the United States has to fall.
[3:27:05.900 --> 3:27:08.700]  We had a guest yesterday talking about that and he was absolutely right.
[3:27:10.300 --> 3:27:13.820]  Going through these phases you know first Europe had to be destroyed so they created Hitler
[3:27:14.460 --> 3:27:18.380]  and they brought him down. Then the Soviets they built them up for a bipolar system and they
[3:27:18.380 --> 3:27:22.700]  destroyed them and now globalism came and for globalism to turn into open world government
[3:27:22.700 --> 3:27:27.340]  the United States and Europe have to fall. The people have to fall to the elites. They have
[3:27:27.340 --> 3:27:31.500]  to pauperize us. They have to make us their slaves as a tool of control. Let's go back
[3:27:31.500 --> 3:27:36.380]  to the calls. Daniel in Alabama. Let me get to everybody. Then Laura, Tim, Dave, Alicia, David.
[3:27:36.380 --> 3:27:41.580]  Go ahead Daniel. Hey there sir. Good. I thank God for you. I just want to tell you you know
[3:27:41.580 --> 3:27:46.860]  he's talking about yesterday and again today about the 10th amendment. I got some news on
[3:27:46.860 --> 3:27:56.540]  that from here in the state of Alabama. The bill that was introduced by Mr. Kenfield.
[3:27:56.540 --> 3:28:05.740]  Yes. Has been shut down by our glorious majority house leader, King Gwynne. Apparently how Alabama's
[3:28:06.620 --> 3:28:14.220]  rules are set up. If it's vetoed and not scheduled, I mean that's just it. It just dies.
[3:28:14.220 --> 3:28:19.100]  Yeah they've unconstitutionally in a lot of states have this allowed the committee heads
[3:28:19.100 --> 3:28:23.740]  to control the legislative process and that's tyranny. Now how unpopular will it be in Alabama
[3:28:23.740 --> 3:28:27.900]  to say no states rights when this stuff's popular in New York and California?
[3:28:30.460 --> 3:28:34.620]  The people I've talked to are pretty upset about. Now I tried to call myself, tried to call
[3:28:36.060 --> 3:28:40.700]  Representative Gwynne and several times just in the past couple of days since I found the
[3:28:40.700 --> 3:28:46.860]  sale. I tried to call yesterday and couldn't get on but I tried to call and they wouldn't even talk
[3:28:46.860 --> 3:28:51.580]  to me. We'll see what's going to happen is they're going to get embarrassed by Texas passing it and
[3:28:51.580 --> 3:28:54.860]  that's a done deal now with peregrine behind it. That's why you got behind it because it's sure
[3:28:54.860 --> 3:28:59.100]  to pass. I've talked to the senator. It's got the votes in the House and Senate. South Dakota just
[3:28:59.100 --> 3:29:05.260]  passed. A bunch of other states are on the verge of passing. So again this is showing us who's who.
[3:29:06.460 --> 3:29:11.740]  Well what I would like, what I want you to do if you don't care, sir. There is another
[3:29:11.740 --> 3:29:20.380]  gentleman by the name of Scott Basin. He's a senator and since this has been shut down
[3:29:20.380 --> 3:29:26.140]  in the House here in the next few days or so from what I understand he's prepared to
[3:29:26.140 --> 3:29:32.620]  actually put it up in the Senate and I want everybody, all your listeners, everybody that
[3:29:32.620 --> 3:29:37.980]  can, I want them to call the State House and I mean just ring their chimes good
[3:29:38.860 --> 3:29:42.540]  and get this passed and another thing you've talked about. Do you have the number? Do you have
[3:29:42.540 --> 3:29:48.380]  the number of the State House in front of you? The number I have here is for the State House.
[3:29:48.380 --> 3:29:51.580]  We'll stay there. We'll give it out when we come back. Stay with us.

[3:31:05.180 --> 3:31:10.780]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force
[3:31:10.780 --> 3:31:17.980]  that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys
[3:31:17.980 --> 3:31:22.780]  the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's
[3:31:22.780 --> 3:31:28.540]  already fudging, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical
[3:31:28.540 --> 3:31:35.100]  mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers
[3:31:35.100 --> 3:31:41.500]  and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.

[3:31:56.700 --> 3:32:03.420]  The Obama deception. The people strike back. Hi this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the
[3:32:03.420 --> 3:32:08.220]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[3:32:08.220 --> 3:32:12.620]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or
[3:32:12.620 --> 3:32:17.340]  gold? It's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible
[3:32:17.340 --> 3:32:22.140]  that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect
[3:32:22.140 --> 3:32:28.540]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[3:32:28.540 --> 3:32:33.100]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not
[3:32:33.100 --> 3:32:37.980]  been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre
[3:32:37.980 --> 3:32:44.300]  crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com,
[3:32:44.300 --> 3:32:54.060]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember,
[3:32:54.060 --> 3:32:59.100]  in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for
[3:32:59.100 --> 3:33:07.100]  Survivalseedbank.com.
[3:33:12.220 --> 3:33:17.500]  All right, I got a Donald Duck brainwashing cartoon I want to play. You can see this propaganda
[3:33:17.500 --> 3:33:24.940]  60 years later and see how ridiculous it is. Taxes, taxes, bombs, bombs. More of your calls
[3:33:24.940 --> 3:33:29.740]  are going to get a report from the Tea Party down in San Antonio. And by the National Guard,
[3:33:30.300 --> 3:33:35.180]  regular army spying on people, that's admitted, that's confirmed, spies on us,
[3:33:35.180 --> 3:33:38.700]  and in the Fed protests, because the bankers don't like us protesting, and they're taking our tax
[3:33:38.700 --> 3:33:45.020]  money. And so they're acting like conservatives, mainly, are going to riot. That's why conservatives
[3:33:45.020 --> 3:33:48.460]  are going to end up rioting someday, is the cops are going to beat them up, they're going to push
[3:33:48.460 --> 3:33:53.980]  them around, they're going to try to take our guns, and then it's on. Just like with the red
[3:33:53.980 --> 3:34:01.260]  coats in 1776, 230 something years ago. So the establishment knows they're going to keep
[3:34:01.260 --> 3:34:05.340]  bankrupting and stealing everything. So they know these are going to turn more aggressive
[3:34:05.340 --> 3:34:09.980]  in the future. And so that's why they're, I mean, I go protest the Fed, the army spying on me.
[3:34:09.980 --> 3:34:14.460]  You can be 100 yards, 200 yards, a half mile away from the Fed, and they run up off jurisdiction,
[3:34:14.460 --> 3:34:19.100]  little federal security guards and say, leave or I'm arresting you. That's what it is to be a slave.
[3:34:19.820 --> 3:34:22.940]  Finishing up with, I got to hurry through these calls, Daniel in Alabama. Daniel,
[3:34:22.940 --> 3:34:32.700]  give the number out to the state house. The number I have for the state house is 334-2242-7674.
[3:34:36.140 --> 3:34:39.900]  And I just, I just want to thank you, Mr. Jones, because you're a focal point. I want
[3:34:39.900 --> 3:34:43.260]  everybody in Alabama to call down there and ring their chimes. And then the words of Howard
[3:34:43.260 --> 3:34:47.660]  Bill, I know we're mad as hell and we're not going to take it no more. God bless you. I appreciate
[3:34:47.660 --> 3:34:52.140]  that. Hey guys, print that off. I had it printed, but I can't find it my stack. Print me that National
[3:34:52.140 --> 3:34:57.100]  Guard, an alert for Tea Party protest before the conspiracy theory start. Punch me back up,
[3:34:57.100 --> 3:35:00.780]  because I keep getting emails about this. See, I'm on air, that guy's talking. I want him to put
[3:35:00.780 --> 3:35:04.540]  the National Guard thing back on screen. So I hit the button where they hear me in the control
[3:35:04.540 --> 3:35:10.220]  room. See, there's people in there. I hit this and then I say, with it on, I say, put that back on
[3:35:10.220 --> 3:35:16.300]  screen. And then you can't hear me till I come back. I just wanted to, every time I do that now,
[3:35:16.300 --> 3:35:23.980]  it's turned into I'm getting orders from the CIA or something in there. Soon I'm going to have this
[3:35:23.980 --> 3:35:26.780]  little earpiece though. That's going to be a lot better wearing these big headphones. Has that come
[3:35:26.780 --> 3:35:35.980]  in yet? Yeah. Okay, good. All right. Let me tell you about a few sponsors. Then I'm going to go
[3:35:35.980 --> 3:35:39.660]  right back to your phone calls. And then that caller was great, but we got to go quicker here.

[3:37:43.900 --> 3:37:50.940]  800-691-6043. Okay, I'm done with the plugs. Let me hit this new story, then I'll go back
[3:37:50.940 --> 3:37:59.260]  to your calls. National Guard on Alert for Tea Party Protest, PrisonPlanet.com. The Maryland
[3:37:59.260 --> 3:38:03.180]  National Guard has been put on alert anticipation today as a nationwide Tea Party protest with
[3:38:03.180 --> 3:38:06.620]  Homeland Security spokesman refusing to deny that protesters will be under surveillance
[3:38:06.620 --> 3:38:10.940]  from the Department of Homeland Security and he has links to all of that. The Maryland National
[3:38:10.940 --> 3:38:16.380]  Guard issued a force protection advisory, April 11th. They issued that on me when I was in Dallas
[3:38:16.380 --> 3:38:21.020]  for in the Fed called us terrorist. It actually says the terrorist. You've got to watch the terrorist
[3:38:21.020 --> 3:38:25.340]  and they may hurt you. I mean, you guys, who's hurting you as the foreign bank's stealing your
[3:38:25.340 --> 3:38:30.460]  whole future? But you'll find out, I know, just feel powerful. The Maryland National Guard issued
[3:38:30.460 --> 3:38:35.580]  a force protection advisory. The document warns the National Guard to be on alert during the
[3:38:35.580 --> 3:38:39.260]  Tea Party protest because guardsmen and guard facilities might become targets of opportunity.
[3:38:40.220 --> 3:38:44.780]  Oh, of the al-Qaeda, I guess. See, the whole fake al-Qaeda thing. I mean, we told you it was for
[3:38:44.780 --> 3:38:48.060]  the American people because their own documents said it. Now they're announcing it openly.
[3:38:49.020 --> 3:38:53.420]  See, Homeland Security's to make sure the bankers can steal everything you got without you ever
[3:38:53.420 --> 3:38:59.500]  stopping them. The contact point for the document listed as the Anti-Terrorism Program Coordinator.
[3:38:59.500 --> 3:39:04.780]  The Maryland Army National Guard, M-D-A-R-N-G force protection advisory is in response to a
[3:39:04.780 --> 3:39:10.380]  nationwide planning protest activity scheduled April 15th, although there is no known direct
[3:39:10.380 --> 3:39:14.940]  threat to the M-D-N-G facilities. That's what all these reports say. They may become a target of
[3:39:14.940 --> 3:39:19.260]  opportunity during protest activities throughout Maryland states the advisory. Yeah, I have the
[3:39:19.260 --> 3:39:25.420]  Army advisory on us that says we're terrorists and may attack. It continues, but it goes on to say,
[3:39:25.420 --> 3:39:29.980]  but we have no history of that, but still we might. Well, you might too, you bastards. I mean,
[3:39:29.980 --> 3:39:35.900]  your bosses may bomb Oklahoma City again and blame it on us. It continues, numerous entities
[3:39:35.900 --> 3:39:40.380]  have formed recently to express displeasure, anger over recent federal state actions,
[3:39:40.380 --> 3:39:44.780]  more taxes increased spending, higher deficits and a surge of borrowing to pay for it all,
[3:39:44.780 --> 3:39:50.220]  bailout of the financial institutions, et cetera. This movement can be identified by
[3:39:50.220 --> 3:39:57.420]  different variations of Tea Party, Tea Party. Past Tea Party events have been peaceful.
[3:39:57.420 --> 3:40:03.740]  There was a Tea Party event in Solomon's, Maryland on May, March 22nd. Tea stands for tax enough
[3:40:03.740 --> 3:40:09.500]  already. They don't want to dare mention it stands for the founding fathers. They got to act like,
[3:40:09.500 --> 3:40:15.100]  you know, that's what it stands for. The document then gives a full list of times and locations
[3:40:15.100 --> 3:40:18.940]  of the Tea Party protest in Maryland and advises National Guard personnel to contact local
[3:40:18.940 --> 3:40:23.900]  enforcement when they feel threatened by protesters or protesters trespassing. It just goes on and on.
[3:40:23.900 --> 3:40:30.700]  I mean, same thing that said for us in Dallas, commanders at all levels should establish
[3:40:30.700 --> 3:40:36.220]  relationship with local police in order to understand local threats. And by the way,
[3:40:36.220 --> 3:40:40.540]  raw story of all people got it right. They have a headline today. I never got to it.
[3:40:42.380 --> 3:40:48.460]  Where it says, let me find it. That's the Washington Times, Rowland Daily, AP.
[3:40:48.460 --> 3:40:57.020]  Oh, where is raw story? They actually got it right. And they admit here that the white supremacist
[3:40:57.020 --> 3:41:00.940]  cop killer was actually against me. They were actually nice in this article. I appreciate that.
[3:41:00.940 --> 3:41:05.980]  Conservatives outraged a DHS assessment warning of violent right-wing extremism.
[3:41:07.660 --> 3:41:10.860]  The report by the Department of Homeland Security is causing waves of indignation
[3:41:10.860 --> 3:41:13.660]  among conservatives for labeling right-wing extremism. This is a quote,
[3:41:13.660 --> 3:41:17.980]  quote, the most dangerous domestic terrorism threat in the United States. That's a quote.
[3:41:19.500 --> 3:41:23.500]  Right-wing is not wanting foreign bankers raping you. So there's that article.
[3:41:25.740 --> 3:41:30.220]  Okay, let's zoom through your calls here. Laura in Texas, go ahead.
[3:41:31.260 --> 3:41:38.380]  Hey, Alex. Hi. I'm going to be going to the Tea Party here in Texas at four o'clock.
[3:41:38.380 --> 3:41:44.780]  Which one had been Centonio, Dallas? Weatherford. Okay, they're all over the place. Good.
[3:41:45.500 --> 3:41:48.620]  Yes. And they actually announced it this morning on the news.
[3:41:51.740 --> 3:41:59.260]  But listen, we were just at UPS doing a certified deal with our taxes. They were handing out free
[3:41:59.260 --> 3:42:05.180]  teabags at the big UPS office here in Austin. Look, we're the majority. Okay, liberal. They
[3:42:05.180 --> 3:42:10.540]  were, that's what the media wants to make it. Liberals are going out to protest the Tea Parties.
[3:42:10.540 --> 3:42:14.780]  Then I actually talked to the liberals. They're actually going to join them. But see, the media,
[3:42:14.780 --> 3:42:19.740]  Fox News says liberals are coming to attack. They want to keep us in left-right groups to
[3:42:19.740 --> 3:42:25.900]  divide us. Then they divide us along race or religion. Again, everybody's sick of the bankers.
[3:42:25.900 --> 3:42:30.460]  And if we get that message out, the new order falls. Yep. And that's what we're doing, Alex.
[3:42:30.460 --> 3:42:37.580]  I got the poster board saying, in the Federal Reserve, that funds the international bankers,
[3:42:38.380 --> 3:42:46.300]  audit the Federal Reserve, HR 1207. We are not your slaves, which is one of them that you did.
[3:42:47.500 --> 3:42:53.180]  You know, say in Dallas, we are behind you 100 percent, Alex. We got Obama deception.
[3:42:53.900 --> 3:42:58.940]  We made tons and tons of those movies. We bought, we actually bought that movie from you.
[3:42:58.940 --> 3:43:05.100]  And we bought shirts. And we're out there defending our rights and our freedoms for our
[3:43:05.100 --> 3:43:10.220]  children, our constitutional rights. Absolutely. God bless you and good to hear from you.
[3:43:10.220 --> 3:43:14.060]  Yeah, go out to these Tea Parties and make sure the left-right paradigm is shattered.
[3:43:14.060 --> 3:43:18.540]  Hand out copies of the Obama deception. Yeah, we've got the best T-shirts out there. The answer
[3:43:18.540 --> 3:43:25.740]  to 1984, 1776, New World War Change, Obama. I mean, it'll all strike up conversations and
[3:43:25.740 --> 3:43:29.580]  meet light-minded people. You don't have to save the world by yourself. It's all of us doing a
[3:43:29.580 --> 3:43:35.500]  little something to explain what the new world order is. It's the enemy. It's the criminals.
[3:43:35.500 --> 3:43:39.580]  They're the ones that are bad. They're the ones that need to be arrested. And all of this nightmare
[3:43:39.580 --> 3:43:44.700]  can stop. We could set about fixing our country. It's the bankers that fund the foundations to get
[3:43:44.700 --> 3:43:52.060]  everybody fighting with each other on race. It's all them. They brag about it. Either they go or
[3:43:52.060 --> 3:43:58.060]  we become slaves. I mean, it's real simple. It's us or them. Let's, good job, Laura, in Texas.
[3:43:58.060 --> 3:44:02.780]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air. Hi, doing Alex. Good. It's really hard not to think about Aaron
[3:44:02.780 --> 3:44:07.900]  Russo today, isn't it? Aaron Russo was a great guy, but he will live on through American freedom
[3:44:07.900 --> 3:44:11.980]  to fascism and mad as hell and all the other great work he did. I'm fresh back from my
[3:44:11.980 --> 3:44:16.620]  back from my local tax office where I passed out 200 copies of Aaron's video today. Good.
[3:44:16.620 --> 3:44:22.940]  And I have an idea for you. A new cabinet post to address this like pre-soil and green condition
[3:44:22.940 --> 3:44:29.500]  we're in. How about a secretary of atrophy? Yeah. And I really want to talk to you about
[3:44:29.500 --> 3:44:34.460]  this textbook, a civics textbook that's being used in the public schools and everybody can get on
[3:44:34.460 --> 3:44:39.980]  board and call their local public school districts and get this book. It's called We the People,
[3:44:39.980 --> 3:44:46.940]  the Citizen, and the Constitution. Very briefly, in section five of this textbook,
[3:44:47.500 --> 3:44:54.060]  the Second Amendment, the Ninth Amendment, and the 10th Amendment is never mentioned. Now,
[3:44:54.060 --> 3:44:59.100]  how can we possibly discuss it? I've seen a bunch of textbooks. People brought me in Texas
[3:44:59.100 --> 3:45:02.540]  where it says the Second Amendment is popularly known as the right to keep their arms, but it
[3:45:02.540 --> 3:45:08.300]  isn't. Only the National Guard can have guns. Tell me the name of the civics book. Email me
[3:45:08.300 --> 3:45:14.060]  at robdianinfowars.com or Aaron's here right now. Rob's gone. Aaron with two As in Infowars will
[3:45:14.060 --> 3:45:18.940]  get it posted. But, hell, I've got textbooks that you have for the social workers saying the families
[3:45:18.940 --> 3:45:23.900]  of disease that must be eradicated. So, there's never any end to how evil these are. Tell me the
[3:45:23.900 --> 3:45:29.980]  name of the wicked textbook and the page number. It's called We the People, the Citizen and the
[3:45:29.980 --> 3:45:35.100]  Constitution. Oh, that's the civics. That's the civics book. I've seen that before. Okay. We the
[3:45:35.100 --> 3:45:42.140]  People, go ahead. The Citizen and the Constitution. Yet they seem to forget the most important
[3:45:42.140 --> 3:45:46.060]  amendment, the Second Amendment. Well, and again, they couldn't get away with that if people were
[3:45:46.060 --> 3:45:49.900]  involved and involved in the PTA and involved in the government training camps. Good to hear
[3:45:49.900 --> 3:45:53.980]  from you. You've got to jump. I'm going to my school board meeting Monday and I'm going to put
[3:45:53.980 --> 3:45:58.140]  this on a record. Good. I want you. Exactly. They always want to distract people with, you know,
[3:45:59.340 --> 3:46:03.820]  does the textbook have enough in there about Heather's 10 mommies or whatever?
[3:46:03.820 --> 3:46:07.500]  Instead, we should be talking about how the textbooks are, I mean, but a lot of times they
[3:46:07.500 --> 3:46:10.860]  tell the truth. They go, oh, we're spraying you with trails. That's in a bunch of government
[3:46:10.860 --> 3:46:14.940]  textbooks for kids. Oh, we're spraying the clouds. Those are chemtrails for your safety.
[3:46:14.940 --> 3:46:18.540]  But then they tell adults it doesn't exist, but the government textbooks say it does.
[3:46:19.660 --> 3:46:25.500]  Trying to figure out how crazy all this is, man. Thank you. Well, let's go to Rob Jacobson
[3:46:25.500 --> 3:46:31.820]  for a quick report and I'll go back to, back to all the callers, Dave, Alicia and David,
[3:46:31.820 --> 3:46:37.180]  all at least get to those three. Uh, quick report and Jason Bermas tonight, nine to midnight. If
[3:46:37.180 --> 3:46:41.580]  there's any big incidents with only playing video clubs at prisonplanet.tv, he'll cast the full
[3:46:41.580 --> 3:46:46.140]  three hours. And if something big happens, I'll be on the air with Bermie as well. Again, that's on
[3:46:46.140 --> 3:46:51.420]  the Genesis Network and at info wars.com and prisonplanet.tv. Members get to again see the
[3:46:51.420 --> 3:46:57.420]  video with their support at prisonplanet.tv. So this starts in about an hour, but they're already
[3:46:57.420 --> 3:47:02.220]  down there at the location in San Antonio for one of the biggest in Texas with Lord Glenn back.
[3:47:03.180 --> 3:47:08.860]  Go ahead. Tell us what's going on. Hey, Alex, just next up due. I had to walk away a little bit
[3:47:08.860 --> 3:47:13.820]  from Jason's doing an interview with some people right now. And uh, that needs to kick up a little
[3:47:13.820 --> 3:47:19.980]  bit, but there's a lot of people out here. Um, a lot of very anti government stuff going on with
[3:47:19.980 --> 3:47:24.460]  these people. Alex, I don't know. They might have to lock them all up. It's, uh, it's looking
[3:47:24.460 --> 3:47:31.020]  beautiful. I see, uh, term limits. I see Obama is a trader to the U S signs. I see no one is free
[3:47:31.020 --> 3:47:36.860]  under big debt. Stop subsidizing stupidity. These are just signs as I'm looking around right now
[3:47:36.860 --> 3:47:39.980]  that I'm seeing. There's thousands of people out here. I've seen, don't tread on me shirts.
[3:47:40.540 --> 3:47:45.420]  People are seriously concerned. Now when Glenn back heard we were coming, he got so scared.
[3:47:45.420 --> 3:47:49.260]  He said he would no longer give a speech, but I don't trust him. He's always implicit.
[3:47:49.260 --> 3:47:55.020]  Is when is Glenn back giving a speech? Right? Well, we haven't heard anything about that. We're, uh,
[3:47:55.020 --> 3:47:59.020]  we were pretty close up to the stage and then they kicked everybody out from that front section.
[3:47:59.020 --> 3:48:05.580]  And I guess to look back in after they filter their anti-American signs and t-shirts and stuff
[3:48:05.580 --> 3:48:09.420]  like that. So yeah, that's right. They're saying, they're saying you're not allowed to have anything
[3:48:09.420 --> 3:48:14.140]  criticizing Obama. Bex people are that's, that's confirmed by the organizers. And absolutely,
[3:48:14.140 --> 3:48:20.620]  they're going to let select minions up so he can come up and then poses the leader of what myself,
[3:48:20.620 --> 3:48:25.260]  Ron Paul and the listeners of this show have literally built against tyranny. But the good
[3:48:25.260 --> 3:48:30.940]  news is out there with the population of real activists, they're all learning the truth or
[3:48:30.940 --> 3:48:35.980]  already know the truth. Right. Exactly. A lot of people here are very educated. They know what's
[3:48:35.980 --> 3:48:40.140]  going on. Here's one that says no big government. I mean, there are signs everywhere and they're
[3:48:40.140 --> 3:48:44.540]  all homemade signs. People are mad and they're coming out here. Now, listen, it's been confirmed.
[3:48:44.540 --> 3:48:49.180]  The army is spying on everybody there all over the country, just like in Dallas they did last year
[3:48:49.180 --> 3:48:53.900]  at the end of Fed. It's also confirmed they've got state police out and playing close videotaping,
[3:48:53.900 --> 3:48:58.860]  but you can't miss them. Are you going to videotape some of those guys? Well, if we see them, we'll
[3:48:58.860 --> 3:49:03.180]  videotape. We're videotaping pretty much everything we see. We turn the cameras on when we got here
[3:49:03.180 --> 3:49:07.980]  just so we don't miss anything. Well, I mean, I mean, in California, uh, with, uh, Roger Hedgecock
[3:49:07.980 --> 3:49:12.140]  and others, they've caught them and it's made national news show. We need to show how they're
[3:49:12.140 --> 3:49:16.220]  not watching the borders. They're spying on patriots and have the army on standby. Oh my
[3:49:16.220 --> 3:49:22.380]  God. Americans are out protesting big government. That's an American. It's, it's pretty crazy out
[3:49:22.380 --> 3:49:25.740]  here, but right now it looks like, uh, it looks like they're done with some music and they're
[3:49:25.740 --> 3:49:30.940]  it looks like they're letting people back in up front to the stage. But, uh, it looks like it's
[3:49:30.940 --> 3:49:36.460]  all American flags right now. There's a couple of other interesting looking flags. Uh, I don't
[3:49:36.460 --> 3:49:39.100]  know. We're going to try to get up close and see what's going on. We're interviewing people
[3:49:39.100 --> 3:49:42.620]  right now. There's a lot of people out here, a lot of different groups passing out stuff. So
[3:49:42.620 --> 3:49:46.940]  it's good to see the people are taking act, not just sitting around. All right. Good job, Rob.
[3:49:46.940 --> 3:49:50.140]  Are you going to be able to sit in with a Burmese tonight since you were part of this on nine to
[3:49:50.140 --> 3:49:55.020]  midnight? Uh, most likely we'll be able, uh, I'll sit in or Jacobson will sit in one of us will.
[3:49:55.020 --> 3:49:58.780]  Yeah. You know, you do that. Maybe Rob, you got a few video clips. Okay. Thank you, Rob.
[3:49:59.820 --> 3:50:04.460]  All right. There he goes. Let's start the Donald Duck thing out to break. And, uh,
[3:50:04.460 --> 3:50:08.780]  for present planet dot TV members will kill the edge and keep playing the Donald Duck.
[3:50:08.780 --> 3:50:11.820]  But this is how it starts says, don't spend your money on yourself.
[3:50:11.820 --> 3:50:13.500]  Keep it all and give it to the government. Here it is.
[3:50:20.380 --> 3:50:25.340]  Yes, payday millions of dollars pouring into the hands of the American worker.
[3:50:26.060 --> 3:50:30.380]  Now, in the mind of the average worker live two separate personalities.
[3:50:30.380 --> 3:50:37.900]  One, the thrifty. Wait a bit, laddie. You're going to save a bit of that, aren't you?
[3:50:41.660 --> 3:50:46.540]  Oftentimes idle money burns a hole in your pocket, which brings out the other personality,
[3:50:46.540 --> 3:51:00.700]  the send thrift. Hi, big shot. Come on with me. I'll show you how to spend your dough.
[3:51:00.700 --> 3:51:02.060]  I got a couple of good dates.
[3:51:05.420 --> 3:51:12.540]  But, laddie, I've got some better dates. Important ones too. When every American should pay his
[3:51:12.540 --> 3:51:19.180]  or her income tax gladly and proudly. This year, thanks to Hitler and Hirohito,
[3:51:19.820 --> 3:51:25.100]  taxes are higher than ever before. Will you have enough money on hand to meet your payments when
[3:51:25.100 --> 3:51:29.980]  they fault you? Ah, we figured that later. Forget it, forget it.
[3:51:29.980 --> 3:51:32.620]  But you don't want to forget our fighting men, do you?
[3:51:34.940 --> 3:51:38.780]  Then you'll have to start saving right away to meet your tax payments.
[3:51:38.780 --> 3:51:44.220]  Well, listen, job. Spend it. It's your dough.
[3:51:46.700 --> 3:51:54.140]  Hi, laddie. It's your dough. But it's your war too. You must save for victory.
[3:51:54.140 --> 3:51:57.420]  What's money for? Spend it. Shoot the words.
[3:51:57.420 --> 3:52:16.940]  Nay, nay, you must save it. Spend. Save. Spend. Save. Well, now what are you going to do?
[3:52:16.940 --> 3:52:29.180]  Spend for the axis. Or save for taxes. Just remember, every dollar you spend for something
[3:52:29.180 --> 3:52:41.740]  you don't need is a dollar spent to help the axis. That's right. And every dollar you sock away for
[3:52:41.740 --> 3:52:52.060]  taxes is another dollar to sock the axis. For it is your taxes, my taxes, our taxes that run the
[3:52:52.060 --> 3:53:14.460]  factories, American factories, working day and night, factories making guns, machine guns,
[3:53:14.460 --> 3:53:29.180]  anti-tank guns, long-range guns, guns, guns, all kinds of guns, to blast the aggressors from the seas.
[3:53:29.180 --> 3:53:43.420]  Taxes for American factories, working full-blast, making planes,
[3:53:43.420 --> 3:54:02.140]  bombers, dive bombers, flying boaters, interceptors, stalk the birds of prey that fly by night.
[3:54:17.420 --> 3:54:20.780]  Taxes to bury the axis.
[3:54:20.780 --> 3:54:38.060]  Taxes. Taxes for ships, battleships, battlecruisers, destroyers, all kinds of battlewagons.
[3:54:38.060 --> 3:54:57.420]  Taxes. Just sink the axis. Taxes to keep them flying, taxes to keep them rolling,
[3:54:57.420 --> 3:55:08.940]  taxes to keep them coming, taxes to beat to earth the evil destroyer of freedom and peace.
[3:55:12.780 --> 3:55:24.540]  This is our fight, the fight for freedom, freedom of speech, of worship, freedom from want and fear.
[3:55:24.540 --> 3:55:30.460]  Taxes will keep democracy on the march.
[3:55:37.580 --> 3:55:41.260]  Donald Duck runs up and gives his whole paycheck to the IRS at the end of it.
[3:55:42.060 --> 3:55:47.420]  He literally does. It's disgusting. For those that couldn't hear it on the radio, it's pathetic.
[3:55:48.060 --> 3:55:52.700]  Meanwhile, they say taxes for liberty, taxes for free speech, taxes for religion,
[3:55:52.700 --> 3:55:56.060]  all of that's under attack now in the U.S. We're the big evil empire now.
[3:55:57.180 --> 3:56:02.460]  And Hitler ran identical stuff about pay your high taxes in Germany to fight the United States in
[3:56:02.460 --> 3:56:07.420]  England. And Hitler was certainly evil and bad, but the point is, is that the globalist
[3:56:07.420 --> 3:56:13.660]  created Hitler, and that's now on record. So they'd have a boogeyman. And they told him,
[3:56:13.660 --> 3:56:16.300]  oh, go ahead and take Europe. We're on your side. That's why Hitler gave speeches saying,
[3:56:16.300 --> 3:56:23.420]  you betrayed me. You said we had a deal and that's on record. So they set that monster up. And
[3:56:23.420 --> 3:56:28.540]  then they, that's how they gave us our income tax. I mean, they had it on the books since 1913,
[3:56:28.540 --> 3:56:31.580]  but they just brought it in there. Okay, let's jam in a few quick calls here.
[3:56:31.580 --> 3:56:34.060]  Dave on Long Island and Alicia and others. Go ahead, Dave.
[3:56:34.940 --> 3:56:38.780]  Yeah, let me be brief, Alex. We just got back from a rally. It was outstanding. We read the
[3:56:38.780 --> 3:56:43.100]  bill of rights. Here's me doing a ninth amendment. It's about a 30 second audio clip and just
[3:56:43.100 --> 3:56:48.940]  listened also to the response from the crowd. Here we go.
[3:57:18.700 --> 3:57:23.980]  Absolutely. So that response from the ninth amendment is arguably the most powerful.
[3:57:23.980 --> 3:57:27.660]  Exactly. So the neocons have tried to pile on and take over what we're doing.
[3:57:27.660 --> 3:57:31.580]  We simply go to all these rallies that are our people to begin with and further organize
[3:57:31.580 --> 3:57:35.580]  and say, now let's go set up second amendment groups. Let's set up national sovereignty groups.
[3:57:35.580 --> 3:57:40.380]  Let's set up jail, the banker movements. Let's go to the end the Fed protest and just energize
[3:57:40.380 --> 3:57:45.660]  and energize and we can arrest the new world order. That's why their police state is in place to try
[3:57:45.660 --> 3:57:51.660]  to stop us from ever bringing them to justice. Here is Hannity is looking for video for many
[3:57:51.660 --> 3:57:56.940]  rallies today. So anybody who has video, you know, Hannity wants to be contacted. I'm not going to
[3:57:56.940 --> 3:58:01.580]  contact him. Obviously, my hand, he wants to show what he wants to show. Listen, listen,
[3:58:02.860 --> 3:58:08.060]  uh, just get a copy, make copies of it, brother. Let's talk to Alicia. Take us out of here. Alicia
[3:58:08.060 --> 3:58:13.580]  California. Go ahead. Hi, Alex. Thank you so much. I'm so grateful to know about you and to have you
[3:58:13.580 --> 3:58:20.140]  on our side. Oh, I'm grateful to have you. Go ahead. Thank you. Thank you. I have a question.
[3:58:20.140 --> 3:58:25.500]  Kind of a weird, uh, situation that happened last night. Uh, two sheriffs just walked into
[3:58:25.500 --> 3:58:30.460]  my home through my front door. They did not. They didn't announce themselves. They just walked in.
[3:58:30.460 --> 3:58:38.700]  Go to info wars.com folks. If you want to hear this,
