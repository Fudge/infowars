[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]  I actually think that we're going to see a cyber attack or a cyber disruption that is so vast Alex
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:16.160]  that it's going to basically disrupt the entire internet and I mean to the point of where it's
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.040]  going to shut everything down and we have become so connected as a society. My whole world for
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.800]  three and a half decades in the military was to think like our enemy you know was going to
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.640]  potentially act okay so I had to think about and then provide scenarios to those that I was
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.840]  supporting the infantrymen or the armor or the aviators or or the you know the guy the operators
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.160]  who were going to go out and and do a mission to put their own lives on the line. So for many
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.920]  many years three and a half decades of my life I had to think about what was the enemy going to do
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.760]  so I studied the enemy I studied him relentlessly and what I learned one of the big lessons that
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.120]  I learned is what you just said that the enemy will typically telegraph what it is that
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.320]  they're going to do and if you if you learn enough about your enemy enough about them and
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.520]  you know you don't have to you don't have to know every single deep dark secret that's in
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.040]  their heart because that's hard to say but if you know that they're evil then you better
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.400]  understand you know how evil operates right we're in we're in the midst of this permanent coup
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.640]  so I think that Donald Trump needs to be very careful and I think those that are around him
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.040]  need to be very careful. Do you have hope that if Trump gets elected despite all the
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.880]  challenges he'll pardon you? Oh I know he'll pardon us I believe that was all my heart you know
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.880]  the thing is is hopefully getting him uh you know for him to be able to get into the position
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.720]  where he can at least be I think on the bow to run right because once you have one minute remaining
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:08.880]  info wars tomorrow's news today
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.600]  when castles towered over vast landscapes and knights championed honor and valor there came an
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.160]  unforeseen darkness amidst this impending doom stood a knight called Alex Jones a brave and
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.920]  outspoken herald known as the truth-sayer Sir Alex Jones was not alone in his most desperate
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.400]  hour in the battle against evil a radiant light descended from the heavens god in all his glory
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.480]  and his legion of angels stood by Alex's side the battle raged on but with every blow Alex
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.720]  Jones conviction grew stronger with every truth he proclaimed the demonic forces faltered
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.720]  when the enemy was vanquished Alex Jones swore a solemn oath that should the realm need him again
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.480]  he would return and now it's Alex Jones leading a full frontal assault on the satanic new world

[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.360]  is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.480]  thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it now this attack is thousands
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.640]  and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks this is a titrated dose

[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.160]  me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.640]  good is turned against us so they take what i've said being sincere build me into an

[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.880]  one of the leading minds of the fight against the globalists is joining us and then joe biggs
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:13.200]  is scheduled if he can get through from prison true political prisoner to be joining us as well
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.800]  after he was sentenced to 17 years in prison two days ago for committing absolutely no crime
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.640]  and then i will continue on after he leaves getting into the adl and the censorship combine

[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:35.280]  have a large stack they directly are working for the un we'll be laying that out but general
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.920]  flinn's a busy guy he's a hard guy to get on but i begged him a few days ago i said i really
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.760]  think they're going to pull a false flag of some type i see them pre-programming in the news
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.720]  i really need your expertise as the former head of the defense intelligence agency and trump's
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.960]  chief national security advisor because you really have over the horizon understanding unlike
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.560]  probably anybody else out there that's on our team the enemy knows what's going on because
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.840]  they're planning it please come on and give us your views on that on the lay of the land
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.240]  politically there is a big awakening people are figuring out this is a permanent coup happening
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.200]  our enemies are in deep trouble at every level the indictments have backfired
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.960]  that they launched against trump but i don't think we should be too confident and we should
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.400]  talk about tomorrow's news today so we can get ahead of it and a sterling example of this
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.080]  is 15 days ago i went on air and told you that i talked to a high-level tsa manager
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.920]  who said they were told on the 15th they would start rolling everything out of september
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.880]  a week later they began to roll it out just like we basically said
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.440]  here is the new york times new yorkers told to mask up for labor day as new cupid variance
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.440]  sparks fears they're going to have drones watching people in new york with the borders
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.080]  wide open all these universities and high schools have been saying you got to have shots to go
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.800]  there they've been closing for a week they're trying to bring the masking back so we got
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.880]  ahead of that though so there's massive political opposition by senators and
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.760]  governors and so many people we're not going to just accept their incremental rollouts so just
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:07.600]  like we got ahead of that we need to get ahead and do our best thinking on if you're a
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.800]  globalist what are you going to do you got to get in their mind and general flint is the
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.640]  expert to be able to give us an information i appreciate him coming on on short notice i'm
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.960]  going to try as much as i can to give him the floor i said i'm going to get your briefing
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.920]  sir what you think to the people he said i like to hear yours as well uh so after he's done
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.440]  you're talking for a while i'll kind of give a brief synopsis of what i think their next moves
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.560]  will probably be again because see the pre-programming generalflint.com he has an
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.840]  amazing new book how to fight ai find it all at generalflint.com he also has shared this on
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.600]  twitter and a bunch of other publications so everybody else watching you can force multiply this
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.440]  show that not just to say a half million people are tuned in right now conservatively
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.280]  and then this will be posted later as an archive demand a video a million or so we'll watch it
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.600]  i'll air it on the main show next week three or four million will see it but when listeners
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:05.040]  get excited like you did two weeks ago on the tsa lockdown 2.0 story we take full control of the
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.680]  narrative and the enemy can't have that because now they're having to counter us instead of
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:16.320]  incrementally rolling out their their brainwashing and weaponized mind control so general flint
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.440]  thank you for being gracious enough to spend some of your limited time with us see how busy
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.960]  you are and the prolific work you're doing so for myself and my family and the crew and
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:31.040]  the listeners and viewers thank you sir and god bless you for being here alex thanks so much
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.320]  for having me and this is a really important day and i you know and i love i love the way that
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.040]  you uh you come on in these on these weekend shows particularly and i know you run these during
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.640]  a course of the week but these weekend shows are really important because it gives people
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.040]  that don't that are working their tails off that don't have that kind of time to be able to
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.920]  to listen to the to the depth that they that they should be uh an ability to be able to hear some
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:59.840]  things on on these shows so this is super important and let me just lay out a few things and
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.480]  number one i'm going to just state the obvious enemies that we have and i'm going to go into
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.920]  those that are not so obvious but we've been talking about i've certainly been talking
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.840]  about it you've been talking about it for geez maybe a decade i certainly have been talking
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.640]  about it for the last few years four or five years but the obvious ones are and i'll start
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:25.200]  right off the top with china right china china has infiltrated into every single institution in
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.040]  the united states of america government u.s government institutions our entirety of our
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.240]  education system especially our our graduate and undergraduate programs i may have been
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.240]  they've been they've been coming into our colleges and universities for well over
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:48.240]  25 years to the tune of minimum of about a hundred thousand a year as high as five hundred thousand
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:54.160]  students a year and and they basically are attending some of the most elite universities
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.400]  that we have in this country they're also in the institution of hollywood right the movie
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:04.560]  making the culturalization community i call it the culturalization community of of america so
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.520]  the chinese have gotten deep deep into that and they've been in that for a long long time
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.160]  and then they're also in the institutions of the of the cartels right these that the
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:20.880]  and i would i would call them the uh the you know the the sort of on the street uh you know
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:27.120]  teamed together where the chinese have teamed together with the cartels and we know that that's
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:33.600]  a fact because they're they're already uh we already have over 100,000 killed in action by
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.480]  fentanyl in this country so that's china that's china all right now let's just and there's
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.960]  some other things and i'll and i'll talk to china because i'm gonna i'm gonna jump to cyber in a
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.920]  second because i think cyber is something that everybody needs to understand and they need
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.960]  to know what that means and how we are going to be affected by cyber you know because i the
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.120]  other part about china and i am going to talk about the health crisis that we already
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:03.360]  see being forced down our throats again the second one is russia right russia is is aligned
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:10.000]  with china as a communist ideology the other element here is this bricks uh this bricks
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:17.680]  alignment of countries right brazil russia uh india china and south africa they just finished
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.240]  their annual summit and actually that summit was the first one that they held since
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:29.040]  since pre uh since the pre-pandemic pre-covid so it's been a couple of years and i and we need
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:34.320]  to pay attention to what's happening after that summit but but russia and china there you go russia
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:42.720]  and china now have been cutting energy deals economic deals military deals for years for the
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:48.320]  last you know certainly the last 20 25 years but in the last five to six years i've seen them
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:55.600]  increase their their portfolio of arrangements economic to military and other arrangements
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:02.240]  uh for you know that are well well past anything the united states of america has been able to
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:08.560]  keep up with and these last couple of years it's really really uh it's catapulted into a new
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.280]  level yeah there you go and now there's and they're purchasing you know the sale of oil is
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.480]  now going to be done not in petro dollars meaning us dollars it's going to be done in in the
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.920]  currency of the uh of the countries that are purchasing it the third so russia russia and of
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:30.880]  course we we have russia right now in this war in eastern europe which is a total distraction we
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.440]  are we the american people are being distracted we're being ripped off uh we are being
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.160]  we're paying out out of the you know through our teeth over to something that we that we
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:45.200]  don't need to be part of and frankly it's a losing effort it's a big time loser yet the
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.240]  administration is going to continue to to distract us with this uh with this losing war
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:57.600]  in eastern europe so that's china russia the third one is iran and the iranian people uh you
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.560]  know i i know a lot of iranians and i i have a lot of friends but the iranian iranian government
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:08.160]  is still in coordination with the democrat party right i call it the democrat the marxist party
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.600]  of the left so they are still negotiating and they are still going to allow
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.720]  iran we we the united states of america are going to
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.440]  essentially build a nuclear weapon and this is insane because this is still the leading
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.880]  state sponsor of terrorism on the planet iran is still you know shouts from the from the
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.680]  from the tops of the buildings you know death to america death to the satanists death to israel
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:41.200]  so iran the fourth country is north korea north korea is clearly aligned with china
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:48.720]  there's no doubt about that they are a nuclear power they they will be used so the north will
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.560]  be used by china to sort of do the big head fake so if we start to see kim jong-un of north
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:01.600]  korea start to conduct things do things over there and you know in his in his uh sphere of
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:06.240]  the world that's what we call the near east if he starts to do things over in the near east
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.520]  where he starts to fire missiles test missiles again you know maybe maybe test a space launch
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.080]  which they have done in the past then we're going to start to see other movements and
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.000]  we're going to have to be very we're going to have to you know our country should be able
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.200]  to juggle more more balls at the same time multiple balls at the same time but
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:31.120]  under this administration we we are uh incapable of doing that right now but so iran is the is
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.800]  or north korea is the fourth country so china russia iran north korea and then you have
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:42.800]  these other crises right the border crisis the narcotics crisis that i mentioned about fentanyl
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:48.640]  the domestic crime the rise of domestic crime in this country venezuela i mentioned venezuela
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:55.600]  as you know in a way because what is happening as we've seen the chinese starting to come across
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.880]  the border and we recently saw usbeck's right a group of usbeck's and uh and usbeck's are
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:08.160]  a strong member of isis and a strong member of al-qaeda and so we just had a group of usbeck's
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.480]  cross the border down and down in the southern border and what's happening with venezuela is
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:18.000]  venezuela is being used as a conduit being used as a conduit for some of these other nations
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.760]  around the world that aren't in this hemisphere so you're going to see chinese where we have we
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.000]  have seen an awful lot of chinese to the tune of about a thousand a day coming up through
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.360]  that what's called the darien gap down in between columbia and panama and making their
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.920]  way up to the uh to the u.s border and thanks to michael yon and others i know you're working
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.480]  closely with and thinking about going down there both of us i mean he has the footage they built
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:48.720]  a giant u.n base down there's a gap and these are mainly military age men chinese i mean i
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.800]  mean i could tell by the look of them they look military to me most of them oh these are
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.280]  military age men of course they are and they're and you know china doesn't just and and the good
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.680]  good reporting by michael as an example when he starts to ask questions like where did they come
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:08.320]  from these guys are coming from china the chinese do not let refugees leave their country except on
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:14.320]  us for a specific purpose so we also have these other these other uh border along our border
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:22.000]  along u.s border these border um uh posts these military camps that have been built uh along our
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.080]  own border i've seen a couple i've been to one of them i've seen these these are huge huge camps
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:33.200]  and these aren't camps for for uh you know a couple of kids these are camps these are large
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:39.440]  large camps and and they are housing thousands and thousands primarily military age men and then
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.080]  and then you have to start to think about where they're going on so so venezuela i mentioned
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.640]  venezuela because venezuela has not only given up their prisoners and their psychopaths but
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:54.480]  they're also acting as a conduit to pass through iranians to pass through uzbek's to pass through
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.080]  chinese and get them on up into the central american isthmus there and head on up to
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.360]  the united states the other two areas that i wrote down here is financial and economic
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.720]  and i and i think that the uh this is where i want to you know go back up to like the
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:18.800]  60,000 foot level and really clearly identify the enemy right and and again i think it repeats
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.880]  pounding this right we have to pound this into our audience we've got to pound it into american
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:30.080]  psyche because the enemy is real when and when we talk about sort of an enemy headquarters
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.560]  it's davos switzerland and the name of the organization is the world economic forum and the
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:40.720]  name of the leader is here claus schwab and then they're like he says he says there's about
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.200]  you know there's about 600 of the smartest people in the world you know in his in his uh
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:51.200]  very very arrogant sort of way but they're actually there's a couple of thousand that
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.320]  are part of this organization and these thousand a couple of thousand are sprinkled all over
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.400]  the world in various governments some of them are running governments trudeau
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.960]  is one up in canada members of his cabinet members of his government
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.360]  same with france macron and there are other members of the world economic forum
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:16.240]  that are running not only governments and and are parts of the bureaucracies and and uh and
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:20.400]  systems of the of many of these governments around the world uh australia is another the
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.360]  united states is another but there's also uh corporations there's corporations that are
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.440]  members of the world economic forum so when we hear about all this corporate wokeness
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:38.560]  for the you know since 1972 essentially there has been this organizing effect to basically
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:44.480]  culturalize the world get the world ready to be globalized and these guys are no longer
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.280]  hiding it so now what we're seeing and this is going to happen financially it's going
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.760]  to happen in the economic system and we are going to we are going to see things yeah you
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:59.440]  go great reset we're going to see things like another health crisis discussion even
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.120]  though in this country you know like the you know we're going to start you know we'll start
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.240]  to hear more we will not comply right well i've got all that and we we should not comply
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:14.400]  with any of this nonsense but i'm starting to see things like malaria you know i i pay i pay
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.800]  very close attention to these indicators so in the health crisis in this country which is going
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.880]  to strain the financial and economic system and they're going to take advantage of it so this
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:28.400]  enemy force that i just laid out and they they have subordinate organizations underneath the
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:33.600]  world health organization the world bank the international monetary fund the world trade
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.400]  organization the united nations which you have always been highlighting and what they're up to and
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.040]  that's important that we understand where you went the u.n is at on a given day particularly
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:49.280]  in this country but we've seen cases small small anecdotal numbers right now of malaria in
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.120]  this country we have never seen malaria in the united states of america yet we've got a
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.680]  couple of cases down here in florida a couple of cases up in washington dc i think that i
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.320]  just read about one out in texas the other day i mean these are anecdotal but when malaria
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.120]  hits and you're not ready for it it can spread very quickly the other one that is also
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:12.800]  a mosquito-borne type disease and and uh it seems like uh this is the bill gates thing
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:19.200]  right the bill gates uh uh incursion of this footage is yesterday confirmed local news
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.440]  that is millions of mosquitoes being released by helicopter in florida
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.040]  yeah and so you say you know because the other one that's up there that we talk about
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.920]  is the west nile virus the west nile virus i mean these are deadly these are deadly things
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.760]  so when you see that what you're showing right there i mean this is these are not
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:43.120]  conspiracy theories this isn't the bullshit that yeah that's a literal black helicopter
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:49.200]  that bill gates funds spraying mosquitoes on floridians yeah i mean it's unbelievable and
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.840]  you know again i i do want to part of part of what i do want to talk about in some of
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.080]  the time that i have is the is the uh the you know the republican party where's the republican
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.040]  party well sir you've got the floor and but let me just interject here just because you're
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:07.920]  reading my mind i i want to before you have to go get into yeah i understand you're defining
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:13.440]  for americans the chai com power group the russians the globalists incessuously work with
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.760]  both but they're undermining america trying to demoralize us trying to bankrupt us destroying
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:23.680]  our cities what is their i mean obviously i believe you would agree the globalists are
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:28.880]  the most powerful block here's here's their ultimate goal here's their ultimate goal i'm
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.320]  sorry alex here's their ultimate no that's exactly what i was about to ask what is their
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.640]  what is their goal yeah i've said this i've said this you know very publicly that their
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:42.240]  that their original intent was eight years of obama right steal this country eight years
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.880]  of obama and then get hillary clinton in charge and have eight years of hillary clinton
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.360]  and we would be done you'd be done i'd be done we wouldn't be having this conversation so
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.480]  to your audience and to the american people that was their plan eight years of obama and if
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.240]  you weren't on on the obama you know if you didn't get on board with obama you didn't get
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:05.280]  on board with his team you were out you were out like i was out you know and and then the
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:11.360]  then the next step the next stage was a was was a controlled political person in the name
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:16.320]  of hillary clinton and and keep her in there for another eight years and we were we were
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:22.960]  blessed we were blessed that trump this warrior stood up and using his own resources and putting
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:28.480]  his own life on the line and then that helped derail their program for a while exactly so that
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.760]  2016 campaign was a hard-fought campaign we knew going in it was going to be hard i mean
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:38.720]  the the depth of infiltration though was not only in our government when i say our government
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.360]  is not only in the you know the bureaucracy in the deep state the intel community it was
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.720]  all the way into the white house it was all the way in and including inside of the
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:54.720]  and their first order of business was to get rid of you exactly there you go there's a guy there's
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.480]  the guy right there obama there's going to be some things coming out on him in the next couple
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:04.480]  of weeks on obama that uh his relationships uh that you know the type of person that he is
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:09.760]  well you said that six months ago and now it has come out uh you know the homosexuality the
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:15.360]  fact that he's blackmailed uh just you're saying so you obviously knew you're saying even more
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:20.000]  stuff's coming out yeah more stuff is going to come out and i think that what we're going to find
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.320]  is uh is that you know we've been lied to so so that's in the past and and and but we cannot
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:31.520]  forget that alex we cannot forget that we've been lied to we've been deceived this is how
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:37.200]  they do it they and they and they have this globalist structure above them and so the big
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:42.400]  issue is why why do they want the united states of america they want the united states of america
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:50.160]  for one thing that's resources right resources energy food and people that we have the innovation
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.480]  and the innovative people that we have i mean if they could china would turn the united states
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:59.360]  of america into a slave state the world economic forum would turn us into a slave state and we'd
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.080]  be run by so general what is the calculus to put their boot on our neck and cut off our
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:09.920]  resources just bankrupt americans drive them into submission yeah so here's what i think we're
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:15.680]  going to see and i and i and it's already been stated uh shrub has said some of this i think
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.440]  we're going to see something in the world of you know and i we've just finished with this
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.480]  book this artificial intelligence book but i actually think that we're going to see a cyber attack
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:32.640]  or a cyber disruption that is so vast that is so vast alex that it's going to it's going to
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:39.120]  basically disrupt the entire internet and i mean to the point of of where it's going to shut
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:45.120]  everything down and we are we have become so connected as a society and so if you
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.720]  i mean we were joking on the back uh you know prior about generators and you know you have a
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:55.200]  you have a hundred thousand dollar generator but you got a 50 cent piece that that's missing and
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.960]  so the whole thing goes to you know but i mean but we we have a government the united states
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:07.600]  government has great control over the internet great control over the internet great control and
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:15.360]  and has great uh and strong and powerful weapon systems in the world of cyber cyber weapons right
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:22.640]  lasers things like that uh space-based uh systems so i actually think that that we're going to see
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:29.520]  some type of cyber attack that's so vast it's going to potentially disrupt or disconnect
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.040]  the internet all right let's stop and slow down and i want you to start over this is
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:39.200]  so important and explain to me from your expert perspective why do the globalist telegraph like
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.880]  people ask how i'm able to predict stuff they telegraph what they're going to pull next
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.560]  a virus is going to hit it's going to disrupt trump a virus will defeat trump's
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:52.000]  basically what fauci and schwab said a year before and then it happens so i guess they
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.840]  want to brag to their minions to show off or they're they're they're pre-programming their
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.960]  people because if i was going to do something evil like that and of course i wouldn't but
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:04.400]  hypothetically i wouldn't telegraph it they're telegraphing that the cyber is the next big move
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.520]  it'll make uh it'll make covid you know look like nothing in schwab's words
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.360]  and i so so why are they telegraphing and then lay out how serious this is
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:20.560]  okay so for everybody right my whole world for three and a half decades in the military
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:28.400]  was to think like our enemy you know was going to potentially act okay so i had to think about
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:35.360]  and then provide scenarios to those that i was supporting the infantrymen or the armor or the
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:40.640]  aviators or or the you know the guy the operators who were going to go out and and do a mission
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:46.080]  to put their own lives on the line so for many many years three and a half decades of my
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.320]  life i had to think about what was the enemy going to do so i studied the enemy i studied him
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.200]  relentlessly and and what i learned one of the big lessons that i learned is
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.640]  what you just said that the enemy will typically telegraph what it is that they're going to do and
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:05.680]  if you if you learn enough about your enemy enough about them and you know you don't have to
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.120]  you don't have to know every single deep dark secret that's in their heart because that's hard
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.960]  to say but if you know that they're evil then you better understand you know how evil
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:19.680]  operates but what they typically do and what they've always done they've always told us what
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.200]  they were going to do and people used to say to me jesus flinn you know you're you're a madman
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.080]  there's some of the some of the things that you come up with that you say the enemy
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.080]  those that don't know you never toot your own horn you were the first major general
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:36.480]  uh major i mean major person in the staff to say china's gonna break and double crosses
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.040]  i mean you basically laid all this out a decade before it happened so why why do bad guys
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:46.000]  telegraph answer that for me and then get into what you think's next yeah they telegraph
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.720]  because they don't have all of the resources that they need at their at their beck and
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:59.840]  call they need to rely on on other aspects of the of the sort of the geography and the
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.320]  last like the average anti-flight isn't getting orders to burn things down they just know
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.840]  go out and burn stuff down exactly so they're calling on their militia basically
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.440]  exactly it's like i i've got to put that it's a dog whistle it's a bit of a dog whistle
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:19.360]  but they need to be able to rally because when they do these guys so from an enemy perspective
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.960]  that's why they do it they let it be known what they're going to do they get the word
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:28.400]  out and if we're good right guys like you especially guys like you and and and people like
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.720]  myself and others if we're good and we're paying attention and we're listening to what they're
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:38.640]  saying they're going to tell us exactly what they're going to do and you have to connect
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.040]  a few dots you've got to do some some some analytics and sometimes in some cases you got
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.960]  to do deep analysis and some link analysis as some of your listeners would definitely know what
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.520]  i'm talking about but and you've got to put the picture together it's like i say in on the
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:57.440]  battlefield in warfare you know you're not going to be handed a you know a thousand piece puzzle
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.840]  with all thousand pieces you're going to be handed a thousand piece puzzle box maybe or maybe not
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:07.760]  even the box top and you're only going to be handed maybe you know 750 pieces of the puzzle
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.040]  and you're not going to have the whole picture so what we have to do is we have to put the rest
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:16.160]  of it together and to me there is so much noise they will put no they'll have all this
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:23.200]  noise out there all this deflection all of this just irregular nests to their to their
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.920]  operations all while they're planning their big their big ticket thing like even going after
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:33.040]  trump all the all of these uh indictments i mean i i was reading a thing this morning i
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.760]  think it's we're up to like 74 75 felony indictments for you know 700 and something
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:43.360]  years it's insane if they had just given them if they had just given trump like one or two
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.920]  felony counts i'd be worried i'd be worried about that i ain't worried because they because
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.240]  they know that they have nothing exactly they went into overkill which shows they're not
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:57.200]  confident right so one of the other aspects of an enemy in this enemy that we are facing is
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:03.920]  arrogance their arrogance because they they just are so arrogant and you know this is this is how
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:11.760]  evil operates right the evil the the arrogance of evil is something that is so profound and it is
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:16.240]  something that we have to pay attention to well we know for the bible that's the big sin is
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:22.160]  pride that's the devil's makeup is right right right so you know we have to we just can't
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:26.640]  look at these people and go they're just a bunch of arrogant bastards these people their arrogance
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:33.200]  will will be one of the main telegraphing features of what it is that they are going to do
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:39.200]  so i go back to this this uh potential uh cyber because cyber is something that
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:46.320]  few people understand uh even fewer know what to do about it uh if you're if your phone shut
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.880]  down if the internet shut down you know if you have your own servers let's say you know if
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.960]  you're a media company you have your own servers you have your own ability to to project you
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:59.600]  have uh i mean little things so here's a little thing that people don't aren't paying attention to
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:06.800]  they're they're going to remove am radios am radios from cars right the big car manufacturers
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:11.920]  who are all woke corporations they're taking am radios out they're going to stop the the
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:18.240]  federal communications commission is going to start to to minimize or or limit the use of am
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:23.040]  radio am radio is one of the most powerful communications means in the world still other
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:28.240]  than maybe a ham radio and there's very there's fewer and fewer ham radio operators around the
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.640]  world so if you don't have your own server you know like you may have or i know some other
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.720]  small media outlets are bigger some of the other bigger ones have their own server farms
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.160]  where they're able to operate they have their own generators but then generators need to run
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:45.840]  off of electricity or or fuel and then you run out of fuel if you don't have those things
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.560]  then the u.s government is going to go to what they'll what they'll tell us is emergency
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:55.120]  broadcast system by the way they're doing a huge test i know where you're going with this exactly
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:02.480]  think about just 20 years ago am fm uhf ehf media didn't watch you now by phasing out
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.720]  all the old broadcast systems starting with am and shortwave and our military's moving even
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:11.920]  away from it everything now is on the web which makes it all targetable i'm not a military
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:17.120]  mastermind like you but common sense means our military should be always 100 years from now
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:22.240]  still back up shortwave still back up am still back up you know all those other secret systems
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:27.360]  that transmit the earth but instead they're moving away making us vulnerable is what you're saying
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:34.960]  putting us on one system entirety of our country is being put in such a vulnerable spot right now
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:39.760]  and and this is going to continue to you know from their perspective is going to continue to
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:46.480]  make progress to get to a place where we cannot control anything we will not be able to control
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:52.640]  our phones we will not be able to control hell the the the light switches is in our home i mean
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:56.480]  i want people to realize you know they're going to call me nuts about this stuff but i want
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:04.240]  people to realize that that this sobering reality is that evil exists and these people when when
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:09.760]  klaus Schwab says and writes about that you're gonna own nothing and be happy he's not joking
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:16.320]  this is not a joke this is a man that doesn't joke this is a man who has his hands on every
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:21.760]  single major nation state in this on this planet to include the united states of america
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:27.920]  he he his circle of leaders you know and these are remember general Petraeus 12 years ago said
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:33.280]  said soon your dishwasher will be watching you and listening to you well now that's been
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:38.880]  here a while right you know we have something called the internet of things right people
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.440]  understand the internet of things for those that know what i'm talking about so i i go back to
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:49.840]  you know what what are the potential things that could happen right and one of the ways and you
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:55.200]  know in in warfare you know some zoo used to say that the fact he wrote about it and and uh
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:02.160]  and we've i've studied it for ad nauseum but everything in war is deception i want people to
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:08.160]  understand what i just said everything in war is deception we are in a war right now there are
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:14.240]  some physical components out there clearly physical components over in the uh in europe there's
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.800]  clearly physical components still in afghanistan iraq you know around the world there's physical
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.840]  components in every single major city in this country and it's called you know things like
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:29.680]  defund the police the defund the police uh a phrase that goes back to the bolshevik revolution
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:35.440]  in the under the era of stalin so you know the the democrats are oh that's your state
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:41.440]  department memorandum 7277 from 1962 to disarm the police and then our military
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:49.440]  and only have a un force that's the official policy exactly so so i want people to understand
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:55.600]  that that the rise and fall of nation states is very real it's a fact of life i joked the
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:00.000]  other day with some friends that i was with i said when was the last time you met anybody from
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.080]  byzantine from the byzantine empire and they looked at me like i was cross-eyed and i said
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:08.800]  because they don't exist anymore so the american empire you know let's just we're at let's say
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:17.440]  250 years so where are we in that sort of rise and and decline of uh of of this nation
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:22.000]  this beautiful experiment in democracy called the constitutional republic where are we
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.200]  and i will tell you these people are going to work overtime and those are the ones that
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:31.200]  i just laid out to include those in our own government i mean you know there's no way in
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:35.040]  the world that joe biden is in charge of anything he could barely go to the bathroom i mean jesus
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:41.680]  this guy this guy can't walk up two stairs i mean without help so how do we how do we get
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:47.360]  here we got here because because we we have we've been complacent we've been lazy we've
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:54.160]  been apathetic about our political system we've allowed a culture of corruption to just be
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:00.720]  i mean just bleed into every single aspect of our of our country and this is where i want to
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.520]  jump a little bit and talk about the republican conservative party that's exactly where i want
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.680]  to go because because we have the incestuous globalists double dealing with the other power
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:15.600]  blocks but then they're trying to degrade and demoralize the united states i see a great awakening
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:21.920]  how would you describe just and then you get into your details in general the battle space
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:26.880]  where we're at right now and then obvious questions listeners want like i can look at the graph
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.680]  i can look at the trajectory tucker carlson's right i mean i think that they will try to
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.760]  kill trump i think that's a very reasonable statement i i think that they're trying to
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.840]  outlaw their political opposition they're trying to create a one-party state uh that you know even
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:44.240]  senator josh holly gets that so i see it positive that people realize how much trouble we're
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:52.560]  in but is it a dollar short and a day late or or what can we do yeah i i what you just said
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.960]  at the very last point i hope that that's not the dollar short and a day late i hope you know
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:02.480]  i pray that we're not there i think right now they're trying to kill trump by narrative
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:07.600]  right i mean the narrative is just constant constant narrative it's been going on for years
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.280]  and you know this latest these latest indictments are just part of the narrative
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:16.720]  assassination i would say because of who he is and what he represents which is a major major
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:23.360]  uh component of an op of the opposition to what it is that we are facing and this takeover this
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:28.240]  continued takeover you know as lee smith lee smith the great author wrote about the permanent coup
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.400]  right we're in we're in the midst of this permanent coup so i think that donald trump
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.200]  needs to be very careful and i think those that are around him need to be very careful i think
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:42.720]  the secret service that that's that protects his life need to ramp it up and and uh and they
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.440]  ought to actually be asking for more help they should be asking for more help as as
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:52.480]  as those of us that work that run in those same circles we we need to be doing the same thing
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:58.560]  because these people are they are not without uh they are not without you know that type of
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:06.480]  level of uh of uh of action of activity if they feel they are stay that they feel so
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.480]  threatened that what you're doing is going to stop their ability to be able to continue
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:15.280]  to take this country over because the rest of the world right now is waiting waiting on america and
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:20.240]  americans to stand up and and and step up and they really you know we just fought tooth and
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.800]  nail to get to get leadership back in the house at least the house of representatives
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:31.440]  and all i see out of them is more is more and more bull excuse me i mean more more talk
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.760]  they're still on freaking vacation come off vacation quit talking about impeachment
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.280]  and i want the audience to get a sense of urgency because i'm on a military trained
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:45.840]  tactician like you or combat veteran i'm just a veteran of 29 years fighting these people
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:52.160]  and i see a mixture of arrogance but that's hiding their desperation and the fact that
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:56.880]  they're all in and i don't think people realize i can feel it i can see it just what
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:01.440]  you just said general i have never had such a sense of urgency that's why i have you here
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:09.680]  what can we do yeah so and again i appreciate uh everything you've done for years um yeah
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.960]  there's a sense of urgency that we all need and and that like i say you know i
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.720]  the weakness of mine is anxiety i get i get anxious sometimes i wake up like i woke up this
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:23.680]  morning at about three o'clock in the morning and i started reading and and uh me too i woke
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:28.640]  up at 3 15 and was just because i don't have the anxiety during the day i wake up because my
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.800]  brain's working while i'm asleep i went to bed about 10 i woke up at three and i was like i've
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:40.400]  got to do something exactly and so i so to me i want people to you know i have a platform you
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:44.960]  have a platform i have a national platform and an international platform and i'm going to
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:50.240]  continue to use it i'm going to speak out i'm going to i'm going to move around this country
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.920]  i'm going to get in the faces of these people i'm going to let them know that we got your
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:59.040]  number i'm going to let americans know that that we're with you and you got to be with us you've
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:03.760]  got to stand behind us that you know that we there will be those of us that will be that
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:08.960]  pointy end of the spear but i need every american now i need every single person to
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:13.280]  to get into their communities and to get into the faces of their local politicians
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:19.760]  i mean that's why we've seen particularly women alex getting in the faces of these school boards
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.880]  around the country you know we haven't really talked about the the educational immersion that
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:30.480]  they're taking our children through and and this is actually part of the chinese plan too so you
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:36.800]  know people don't know that in 1949 when mao came to power he created a hundred year plan
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:42.560]  and by by 2049 china would be the dominant world power well when g came on board which
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:47.520]  g's only like the like the fifth or or sixth uh leader since now i think the fifth leader
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:53.520]  since now g came on board you could himself you know president for life and he is going to move at
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:57.920]  a at a pace that's much faster because he knows he's not going to be around in 2049
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.000]  so he's going to get it he's going to make it happen by 2029 and i think you hit the key
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:09.200]  here though people have to know who the enemies are and it does i i am seeing a a real
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:14.640]  acceleration in the learning curve i mean if i tried to list all the people now that sound quote
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:18.960]  radical like you and i but we're not radical we just are aware no that's got a really scary i
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:24.320]  mean even james wood sounds like general flinn now uh russell brand tucker carlson uh i mean the
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:31.040]  list goes on and on rfk jr i mean right rfk so rfk jr so you know and the other thing is
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:37.200]  don't listen to alex jones don't listen to mike flinn go and do your own damn critical research
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:41.200]  and you're going to find that we're not we're only scratching the surface exactly nothing that
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:45.360]  we've said is stuff that we're making up this is stuff that we're just scratching the surface of
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:50.640]  what these people are capable of doing so where's the republican party where's the leadership it's
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:57.840]  non-existent non-existent i mean where's the impeachment of biden where is it right well i know
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:03.360]  that one uh one congressman has has put in impeachment uh proceedings to initiate them but
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:10.480]  he did that like almost a month ago and yet uh mccarthy is still on vacation he's still got
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.160]  the entire house on vacation so mtg mtg i should have announced that is in studio tomorrow night
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:22.480]  and she says that it's going to be introduced the next two weeks she says she's got his i'm
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:27.520]  kind of breaking news here but let's hope that's the case yeah well so a guy by the name of
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:34.160]  greg stuby congressman stuby from florida he did introduce impeachment uh proceedings already
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:39.200]  and he did it about four weeks ago so now it's like i was like jumping through my skin when
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:44.000]  i heard that four weeks ago and i was like great let's get all these guys back guys and
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.880]  gals back to work and let's start the impeachment proceedings now you know you take a week take a
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:53.280]  week's break take a take a four days yeah we gotta go on offense and instead it's not work
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:59.280]  we've got to go yeah we've got to go on offense we can we have got to get off of our heels
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.840]  we have got to start you know the only way we're gonna score the only way we're gonna win
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:10.240]  is by being on offense by being by scoring right by getting over that line and and being i mean
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:14.480]  look at what uh what you know we know what nancy pelosi was able to do and really the first 30
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:20.800]  days of her previous time as speaker she had 500 indictments out 500 i mean it was 500
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:27.280]  subpoenas i'm sorry 500 subpoenas out to people for her january fake january 6th uh hearings i
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:32.800]  mean it's just unbelievable where where where are we this this speaker mccarthy as far as i'm
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:39.200]  concerned is a rhino establishment figurehead and uh and and he doesn't need he doesn't deserve to be
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.880]  called speaker no i totally agree and we should expand on that obviously they're scared of the
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:47.040]  justice department they're intimidated he should be removed he doesn't take action
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:52.480]  but but that's another great example we need to see the impeachment of merit garland they've
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:57.600]  caught him meeting secretly with jack smith uh meeting at the white house with jack smith
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.680]  they've they've caught him covering up the hunter biden stuff we have all the whistleblowers
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:07.520]  impeach the son of a bitch yeah so i just want to i want to take a minute to talk about robert
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:13.440]  f kennedy jr robert f kennedy jr number one i i uh they they won't provide him uh secret
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:18.000]  service which tells you everything that they plan on potentially doing to that that guy number
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:24.320]  one i i or number two the the uh kennedy every time i hear him i'm like jesus kennedy you're
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:30.080]  you sound like you're an america first guy you sound like a damn uh an american who you sound
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:35.760]  like either you're old school democrat and you're right there in the center of the country or you're
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.920]  you're uh you're on the conservative side because of because of the way you're speaking
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:45.920]  and i would say that even some of the things that he's written about so i you know i like him
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:52.800]  and and i know him and when i when i see guys like him i mean he gives me hope because the
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:58.880]  democrats the democrats now are are the marxist party right so the democrats are not going to do
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:05.040]  a debate with with robert f kennedy jr why because he represents something that they
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:10.240]  fear which is honesty and the truth why don't they want to have why don't why are they going
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:15.920]  after donald trump so hard because he represents honesty and he represents the truth and yeah
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:22.640]  you're showing some you're showing clips of i mean of not only his father being assassinated
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:28.160]  but but his uncle being assassinated never mind martin luther king jr never mind malcolm x
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:32.960]  i mean malcolm x in one of the one of the statements that malcolm x said is anybody
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:39.280]  that calls themselves a liberal liberal democrat he said be very careful he talks about liberals
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:43.120]  right he says be very careful about somebody who says they're liberal and then a couple of
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:49.280]  days later when he gave that speech he was dead he was assassinated so you know that at that
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:55.840]  time in our history physical assassinations were much easier to get away with and then
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.360]  of course you could hide everything in classified or it's under investigation
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.000]  now physical assassinations would be very very difficult to get away with because everybody's
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.000]  got a damn camera you know but that's why they assassinate you now with law fair and lies
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:16.960]  but i i really feel and see that's their desperation button is i see political assassination
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:22.480]  coming roaring back that's and my guts never wrong general yeah boy uh you know i mean this
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:27.520]  is the time and i hope it is because i i hate to think that uh but i will tell you that
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:36.320]  these people are not gonna wake up tomorrow morning alex audience and go you know what
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.960]  i'm talking about these people the world economic forum or the white house or the white house
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:45.120]  they're not going to wake up and go you know what we've screwed the american people so bad
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:50.240]  you know let's let's turn the energy spickets back on let's get rid of this cultural bullshit
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:55.520]  inside of our education system let's stop with the crt let's stop with the drag queen hour
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:00.480]  let's let's fund police let's go ahead and build a wall let's go ahead and stop this
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.320]  invasion let's let's get the fence yeah they could be in charge of a big win and
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:09.120]  have domination through american culture and be 10 times more powerful but they have they have
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:13.200]  a needle dick why do the globalists hate us so much why do they have it out for us
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:22.800]  they they hate us because they they hate just authentic honest people who they cannot control
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:29.040]  yep and i and i and i you know i mean yours truly here it's like when i in my when i was
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:34.800]  in the tail end of my military time you know one of the one of the and this is public you
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:40.240]  know one of the reasons why i was i was you know told to leave basically a year early from
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.720]  a job that normally would be three years was because i wouldn't tow the line for the talking
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:50.720]  points that that is was on the run that al-qaeda was on the run and and and no longer a threat
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.160]  i just wouldn't tell line because that wasn't the truth and you know when they when they
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:58.800]  offer you things you know they shine this light at the end of the hall and the light is a very
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:02.880]  easy light to grab hold of they don't worry about it you know you're going to get taken
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.080]  care of wait till you get out you're going to be put on this board that board you're going
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:10.400]  to be given all kinds of things and and you're going to you know you're going to be taken care
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:15.040]  of right and i just i'm like that's bullshit we're talking about people's lives here you know
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.040]  we're talking about of course you were vindicated right after you warned that oh al-qaeda
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:26.320]  through isis had a huge resurgence oh my god it was it was it was in 24 or 26 countries if i
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:32.320]  remember right at the time and they were they were exploding all over the you know all over
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.320]  africa all over the middle east and all over central asia as well as here in this country
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.000]  and that's one of the things that the obama administration didn't want to do so didn't
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.440]  want to talk about and didn't want to have to didn't want to have to admit to right so they
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:49.040]  they want this country and they're not going to wake up they're going to continue to triple
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.920]  down so that we're going to see more of this same stuff you know that we you know you
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:59.360]  showed the pictures of the of the mosquitoes you know the bill gates foundation spraying mosquitoes
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:04.960]  we're already talking about masking again we're going to see corporations going to start putting
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:10.080]  the six feet all this kind of madness again and the american people we need to we need to beg
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:15.600]  out of that we need to say nope we ain't going to do it and we need to to find other outlets
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:20.640]  for us to be able to to operate and and isn't there resistance to that an example of victory
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:25.920]  in the few minutes we have left any other key points you'd like to add my big concern is false
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:31.680]  flags in your research obviously a cyber attack can be blamed on somebody they're trying to say
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.440]  all the conservatives are white supremacists i'm worried they'll attack a black church or
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:41.600]  a college that you know they're really pushing that narrative what do you see in your
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.880]  false flag wheelhouse i don't want to get you back on soon so i'm going to read the book i
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:52.080]  read your last book how to fight ai tell us about that yeah so one thing on false flags
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:56.800]  it's very easy to train a militia of a bunch of white dudes up in the you know up in the
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:01.520]  boony somewhere in this country and then get them out there to do something and make sure that
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:05.920]  that you know that that they're all taken care of right it's easy to do that and make
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:11.760]  it appear as though it's some white you know christian national nazi group right and then they
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:16.240]  blame and they do something and again biden's telegramming he says the number one threat is
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:23.760]  terrorist with almost no it's almost non-existent yeah so you know we'll expand on that we got a few
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:29.520]  minutes expand on that well yeah i mean so these are easy things to do folks these are these are
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:36.080]  these false flags we call them these are easy things to create now if you have another element
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:42.480]  called a bunch of illegals so nobody's looking for them and you know hometown usa right now he's
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.560]  looking for their brother or their or their or their uncle it's just a bunch of illegals that
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:52.640]  are being trained and these are we have we have people coming into this coming into america from
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:59.120]  like 165 168 countries you remember remember just six months ago they had three illegal groups
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:03.920]  in texas commit mass shootings and they tried to say white supremacists did it but it didn't
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:08.000]  work so they shut it down is that what you're getting at yes that's exactly what i'm getting
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.120]  at and and so they're gonna try they'll they'll they'll test they'll test the waters and you're
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:17.760]  gonna see these false flags we have got to be able to analyze them quickly we've got to be
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:23.040]  able to if we still have access to the internet we have to be able to get the word out quickly
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:28.080]  we've got to use the influencers that we have to say hey you know don't fall into this
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:33.360]  trap that they want they want this trap of they want it to be to to where you know the
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:39.200]  american people start to become violent we have got to call for this is non-violence right this
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:45.920]  is we have got to be so smart about what they are going to try to lure americans into doing
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:52.800]  okay and this is part of this false flag now if they also do cyber attacks simultaneous
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:57.200]  right at the same time where they're shutting down and they can segment the internet they don't
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:01.440]  just have to shut down the entire internet they can segment they can only send this to their
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:05.280]  sites exactly they're going to hit with a cyber attack claim it's the russians they've already
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:09.440]  said the right wing trump's going to work with the russians to shut the web off they shut it down
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:13.520]  to shut us up and that's why they've been trying to get rid of every local talk show host that's
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:19.600]  on am and fm that's a patriot is because they're still worried about those systems and in the
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:25.840]  world of ai okay this is how to fight ai in this in this world which is really important
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:34.080]  they could use false uh uh videos of you of me of trump of of high profile people
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:40.640]  making statements right crazy statements or making statements that sound legitimate and it's
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:45.680]  and it looks just like this background i mean there so a truck mom goes off at a black college
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:50.320]  and it's alex jones or trump or general flinn saying good job blow more stuff up we never
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:56.880]  said that exactly exactly exactly and now what you have to do is you you're on you're on the defense
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:01.520]  and now you've got to go out there and fight some some media thing and you got you know abc
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:07.760]  nbc cbl you got all the big major networks the cable news networks that are going did you
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:11.600]  see what general flinn said did you see what alex jones said do you see what these people are
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:16.960]  talking about and it's not those it's it's none of that right it's none of that the whole
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:22.560]  thing is fake the whole thing is a poser right it's a poser well here's a microcosm i'm there
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:27.120]  on january 6 trying to get everybody over where trump stage was on the northeast side by
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:32.240]  the supreme court and i get up and say it got thousands to not go in wall street journal still
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:36.880]  ran headlines i said attack the capital now thank god we still had the internet i was banned
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:41.680]  but other people got the video out they had to retract but if we're not online they'll be able
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:46.880]  to do that they'll be able to do that and they will use and they will be given they will be
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:53.440]  given access to the emergency broadcast system by this administration i can guarantee that so if
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:59.520]  we see if we start to hear about the emergency broadcast system being tested and used and i i
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:04.560]  really think that we're we're the real potential exists and it's this is in klaus
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:12.800]  schwab's words right how the enemy telegraphs you know he says he used that a cyber attack so vast
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:20.240]  it disconnects the internet cause schwab's words so i actually when he said that it was like
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:27.520]  he said it and he doesn't say things just off the cuff no he says things that are so so
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:31.920]  prepared and when he said that and then he didn't talk about it again and nobody questioned
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:35.920]  him on it like what the hell is this guy talking about what is it i thought the world economic
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:39.360]  forum was you know had something to do with economics it had something to do with our
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:43.520]  financial system had something to do with you know there's nothing good about this no it's the
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:50.000]  corporate intelligence agency that's taken over every aspect general flint incredible 45 minutes
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.560]  with us generalflint.com everybody should get how to fight ai i'm going to read it i'm going to

[00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:57.860]  against this and and trust me this is not this is why they don't want us back in power this
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:02.180]  is why they're fighting tooth and nail to keep Trump out and and to keep guys like me from
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:07.300]  going back into government to help him because i know Trump will pardon people like Joe Biggs

[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:30.980]  terrorism terrorism sentencing for being there when
[00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:38.820]  Ray Epps broke through the fence this is this is insane Joe i love you brother
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:43.060]  and and and you know you're a political prisoner and we we appreciate you i know you only get
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:47.460]  15 minutes per call when you've got a call back at 15 again so we've got about 12 minutes
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:51.220]  leave before they hang up on you then we'll be waiting for you to come back on again in about
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:57.540]  30 minutes but Joe how are you holding up and you've got the floor i know it's all right you
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:01.860]  know my heart hurts you know this is ridiculous you know they said the shaking offense was
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:08.180]  tantamount to terrorism the judge told me that and they want to send a message to americans
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:13.779]  that if you go to these events if you are part of political groups they're going to throw
[00:59:13.779 --> 00:59:18.100]  you in prison for a long time they want you scared they don't want you to go out and vote
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:22.580]  they want people scared before it's time to vote and that's why all this heat's happening right now
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:27.300]  um you know this is ridiculous we went there that day with no plan with nothing we were
[00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:32.340]  there like every other american but it's because we're a political group you know uh
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:36.259]  we knew that there was going to be a head on it as soon as uh Joe Biden mentioned
[00:59:36.259 --> 00:59:40.900]  us in the first presidential debate i knew that there was something going on with this and
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:46.420]  sure enough even Enrique called it um they're going to put us in chains and sure enough they have
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:53.940]  um you know we went through a long drawn out trial five months and not once did the FBI
[00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:59.860]  ever have proof of a plan there was no intelligence of a plan not one of the rats that came forward
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:04.500]  um said that there was a plan everyone said that there was zero plan of anything happening
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:12.740]  that day by us and yet they got us for conspiracy um to plan this uh they said we had
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:19.060]  this meeting of the mind without ever actually saying anything and it happened on the fly at the
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:24.340]  first breach so apparently we all had this telekinesis power we all agreed that from there
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:28.580]  on out when this first you know fence went down and everyone walked forward that we were
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:33.779]  all going to stop the certification of the election and that's what they got the jury to
[01:00:33.779 --> 01:00:38.740]  say and the jury would have convicted us of sorcery and witchcraft and murder if that was up
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:44.900]  for the uh you know up to to vote on um well joe you're right this is the Salem witch trials
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:49.700]  10.0 and what do you make of ray epps he was there actually saying go in the capitol
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:54.500]  and picking up shines and ramming under police but he's the little darling that must be protected
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:01.540]  well they want see so this is the interesting thing about the trial they altered evidence they
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:06.500]  you know there was witness tampering there was witness intimidation by the FBI
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:11.540]  um they rigged this to a point where we had nothing that we could do they they only allowed
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:18.660]  in a video of a fence that goes down in front of me or in in my area um and there's no video of
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:22.900]  me breaking the fence there's a video of my hand on the fence then my hand comes off the
[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:27.380]  fence and then later on the fence breaks after other people have grabbed it and ripped it
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:31.540]  but they only showed that video the real video hey were they charged Owen
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:38.980]  what is up resentencing in two weeks one of your fellow reporters and friends and they said
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:43.220]  he should have known the fences have been knocked down so just because he walked onto the
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:49.140]  property they charged him sorry go ahead so the fence actually goes down in front of ray epps
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:54.260]  but the video that the government gets to be allowed in and the judge allows in
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:59.060]  shows a green glitch where the fence goes down first you can't see all the people rushing up
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:04.340]  on the stage and it only shows the fence breaking around the area that we're standing at me and my
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:08.819]  buddy so it glitches out the part where it's in front of ray epps where all the people are
[01:02:08.819 --> 01:02:12.260]  surging and then they go in front of the judge and go look see these guys are the first ones
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:17.300]  that broke it these guys are the ones that broke the fence and led the charge to the capital
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:22.900]  and that is not the truth that is not that is not what happened and videos will come out
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:28.180]  this is insane and they want to take me and put me in jail for the rest of my life
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:32.740]  you know i'm about to turn 40 17 years i mean like really what am i going to do when i get out
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:37.220]  you know this this is this is insane there's no way that this can stick this is a travesty
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:42.020]  to say that the shaking of a fence that my putting a hand on a fence is tantamount to
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:46.819]  terrorism they're they're they're putting me in the same category as osama bin laden
[01:02:46.819 --> 01:02:51.540]  and uh the you know every other character so obviously you're gonna appeal this but let's
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:56.180]  talk about how we support you and your daughter and your family free joe biggs.com and i'm told
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:03:00.100]  you only got 15 minutes till they cut you off are you gonna be able to call back in or how's that work
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:04.900]  yeah yeah i'm sitting right here guarding this phone like it's uh my life depends on it so no
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:08.340]  one's getting over here no one's gonna mess with me no one messes with joe biggs in this place
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:13.460]  anyways do do do people see uh are you saying people see through the fact that you're a
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:19.940]  political prisoner everywhere i go i can tell you this everywhere i go people are praying for
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:24.340]  me every officer i meet puts their head down and they go i can't believe this is happening to
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:29.140]  you son every u.s marshal has done that the only people who don't give a flying you know
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:33.380]  f about what's happening to me are the people that are in the fbi for the most part there are
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:37.220]  some good i'm not going to get you wrong but the fbi for the most part those the evil
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:41.940]  stinky you know conniving uh scoundrels that want to just see us thrown in jail for the
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:46.660]  rest of our life but the u.s marshals the air marshals the police the sheriff the the
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:50.580]  people at every jail i've been to everybody comes up to me and shakes my hand and goes this
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:54.580]  is crazy what's happening to you this isn't right we can't believe this the prisoners
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:58.580]  even come up to us with respect the black gang members they all come up to us and go man we can't
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:02.260]  believe this is happening and we hope trump wins we hope he pardons you because you don't
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:06.420]  deserve to be here you're not a criminal well it's the arrogance of the globalist that has
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:10.900]  done this and have you not seen your support supercharged i'm guessing since all the
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:16.819]  indictments against trump uh it's hard to see with the support in here you know like you
[01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:21.380]  know i'm limited on what it is i can and can't see but i hear about it you know i get messages
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:25.940]  and stuff like that i hear that that there is support but you know it's really hard you know
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:31.060]  they really constrict what what i'm able to see from uh inside where are you right now where
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:35.380]  are you going and and and obviously you need money for appeal people say we're always asking
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:38.740]  for money yeah we're in a war against the globalist folks how do people support you joe
[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:44.580]  well right now i'm at the dc jail uh what a lot of people call the dc gulag this is the
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:49.060]  one spot that had a uh you know uh retreating prisoners brad at one point
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:53.779]  ellen said when he was there that he would wake up and literally covered in roaches eating his
[01:04:53.779 --> 01:04:58.819]  skin yeah that's how it was in the in the building where they first originally had people
[01:04:58.819 --> 01:05:03.540]  now we're in what's called the ctf and it's a lot nicer um it's not as bad but the food
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:08.660]  is horrible like you can't eat the food here it is not edible in any kind of way so uh way
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:13.060]  whatsoever um you know to your second point if you really want to help out you know i need
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:17.220]  money to help support my daughter you know they have taken away my military retirement
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:22.100]  this is it says if i never even served in the military uh you know the prosecutor gets up and
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:25.300]  starts you know before sentencing goes i just want everybody to know that i don't want to take
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.819]  away from joe biggs the fact that he's an american hero and that he served our country
[01:05:28.819 --> 01:05:34.900]  but basically him touching that fence is tantamount to terrorism um his hand touching that fence
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:39.220]  was the same as an explosion going off and sending shrapnel through bodies and killing people
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:43.380]  um blah blah blah and the judge has now said that in the trump january 6 case
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:49.220]  she compared it to 9 11 in the boston bombing yeah so if you really want to help me out i
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:53.380]  need the help i got i mean the appeals case it takes years you know i'm not getting out
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:58.180]  anytime soon um i've already been in for three years almost you know i'm i'm about to come
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:02.420]  up with my three years of that three years i've been in solitary confinement for a year and a
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:07.940]  half um you know and i'm you know praise be to god that i haven't lost my mind from that
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:12.819]  everybody wonders how i can still keep um you know my sanity and how i'm still able to communicate
[01:06:12.819 --> 01:06:18.900]  with people well i saw the left make fun of you that you cried when they said 17 years but
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:25.700]  i mean obviously you're not 17 years and you've been given this evil tyranny and can't
[01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:31.460]  see your daughter i would cry too they are sick evil people well actually no the 17 years came
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:35.380]  after the fact that i cried i cried when i brought up my daughter but the tears that i had were
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:40.100]  from my daughter and my daughter alone not anything that the judge had to say the prosecution
[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:44.500]  um after i spoke and i had you know i i had gotten emotional about my daughter i sat down
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:48.900]  and that's when the judge read the 17 years oh so they even spun that that you cried after
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:53.540]  the senate you cried for your daughter yeah i cried for my daughter that was it there was no
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:57.540]  anybody in that courtroom i got letters today saying it was emotional to hear you talk about
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:01.460]  your daughter but it had nothing to do with the sentencing i sat there and took that like a man
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:04.740]  i looked at him and do whatever i had to do you know when i walked out of there with my
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:09.460]  head held high and i'm going to continue to show show they lie about everything don't they
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:15.300]  yeah of course i saw we saw an article on uh our little prison tablet they gave us last night
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:20.260]  it was on yahoo saying that proud boys cry at trial not one of us cried about anything like
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:24.260]  that it was only when we brought up the fact the guys of us who have kids which is most
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:28.340]  of us except for one of us i think um when we brought up our children or saw our children in
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:32.980]  the in the in the pews we got teary-eyed uh to think about that to know that our children
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:37.700]  our children aren't going to see us again for a long time um from here you know you know
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:43.380]  go to joe free joe biggs.com you know help out that that money goes either to my appeals
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:48.020]  or it goes to my mother and daughter to help out i don't get any of this personally in any
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:53.060]  kind of way um it's not going to help me you know we know that you don't need to
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:57.860]  put a proviso and i think i think your goal's too low because i mean it's going to take
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:01.779]  i know how these appeals work it's going to cost a million bucks over the next few years for
[01:08:01.779 --> 01:08:05.779]  your appeal alone and you're only asking for seventy five thousand dollars
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:12.500]  well yeah that's that that was when we first had it but yeah we're going to re-up that and
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:16.580]  change some stuff and like redo some of the wording on it and ask for more um that that
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:21.540]  was just from i've had this stuff for a little while um well you're a great guy brother i know
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:24.180]  they're about to hang up on you in a minute but just say as much as you want before they
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:30.900]  disconnect you well i i will say this um the next place i'm going to i put in for Coleman
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:35.780]  Low that's in florida that's the same spot they sent Martha uh Martha Stewart to obviously not
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:41.220]  the female wing um i'm sure that'd be a lot more fun um but they're sending me to the possibly
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:47.140]  the Coleman Low uh which is somewhere in florida north of orlando you can be in the female wing
[01:08:49.059 --> 01:08:52.580]  i think a few of us have tried that already they look at us like we're crazy i think
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:57.860]  you know i i think unless you have democrat on your voting card they they don't believe it
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:03.380]  they'll just think that you're playing around well it's good to hear you with so much humor
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:06.580]  uh and we just keep asking listeners for help because they're coming after everybody folks
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:10.180]  we're here on the front line we're in a war for everybody and we're not complaining at
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:13.940]  listeners but if you don't support freejoe biggs.com then uh you know then you're
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:19.540]  supporting your own destruction yeah i mean look first they came after me for shaking a fence
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:24.180]  what what next is it you know what's the next thing that's going to happen that they're
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:29.380]  going to say is tantamount to terrorism um you know they they blamed me for the very
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:35.220]  first breach the judge looked me in the eyes and said you have one minute remaining my fault
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:39.940]  i was using uh a bullhorn further back there was a guy in front of me close to the gate
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:44.260]  where ray epps was uh we call him black megaphone guy because we don't know his name but he was
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:49.059]  sitting there telling everybody the men come to the front get the women out of the front but we
[01:09:49.059 --> 01:09:52.660]  need to take the fence down we need to push forward we need to go after the cops we need to
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:56.260]  get through i've seen the videos the left showed up dressed up like trump supporters
[01:09:56.260 --> 01:10:01.140]  with the dc police and they did it all and it's incredible all right they're about to disconnect
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:06.420]  you joe freejoe biggs.com you're gonna call us back in 15 minutes yes i am i will be
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:11.620]  all right keep talking to the end just keep talking keep talking well i like i said i

[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:24.100]  it's it's interesting to to see how the government has spun this entire situation
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:30.020]  they have lied they lied to the american people the media helped it the media sat there day in
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:33.940]  and day out and refused to report on the facts that we brought up during our trial
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:37.220]  and only thank you for using global telling
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:47.700]  ruthless lawyers ruthless larry feint blackrock just ordering destruction of everything no borders
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:54.820]  human trafficking fentanyl pedophilia with children world government world war three with
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:11:02.580]  russia sell out to china political prisoners total surveillance censorship and they've got all
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:06.740]  these yes men and women
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:10.720]  that are
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:19.260]  just going along with their own destruction.
[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:21.580]  You know a lot of listeners have asked me,
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:24.620]  where is Stuart Rhodes?
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:28.900]  Been trying to get him for a year when he's been in jail.
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:31.860]  Where's Joe Biggs?
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:35.420]  I have the same lawyer as Joe Biggs
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:39.480]  and the calculus was it'll make the judge mad
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:42.160]  if you're on air attacking him and.
[01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:48.710]  That's why and then listeners are like why aren't you talking about it well I've been
[01:11:48.710 --> 01:11:54.830]  trying since he got sentenced get him on took us two days he's here and you just say well
[01:11:54.830 --> 01:12:00.030]  just don't listen to the lawyers I mean it's his lawyer Norm Pattison and I get Norm's
[01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:10.430]  point and so all I can do is comply with what people want because it's not my life
[01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:14.910]  it's Joe's life it's his lawyer it's what they decided to do so I'm Joe on all the
[01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:17.670]  time he's able to call in them I've been trying to get you know they're like well
[01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:21.830]  just we want to piss people off and maybe that's the wrong strategy I'm the
[01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:24.230]  type of guy that's gonna talk crap you saw me these judges in my show
[01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:30.030]  trials I say you're a crook you're a tyrant cuz they're liars the judges
[01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:33.670]  like he's got four hundred million dollars I'm like you're a liar she's
[01:12:33.670 --> 01:12:38.070]  like no jury he's a liar no you're a liar
[01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:50.310]  and so that's where we're at uh but now boom we're gonna get norm on too about this his lawyer
[01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:55.830]  who's also been my lawyer who's a famous criminal lawyer and a good guy people say oh your lawyer
[01:12:55.830 --> 01:13:01.269]  did a terrible job at standing trial they didn't let us talk they gave our lawyers a list of like
[01:13:01.269 --> 01:13:05.830]  five things you could talk about for a show trial i was already found guilty they just found
[01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:10.790]  Giuliani guilty a judge did people like well judges don't find you guilty
[01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:15.030]  folks we're not in Kansas anymore have you figured that out yet
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:45.240]  so during the five-month trial i'm like hey i really want them on i want joe on i want you on i want to support him and they're like listen we think there's some humanity in this judge and we've totally innocent so we don't want to antagonize them so we want to just try to you know see if they've got and they don't have humanity so now i can talk about it and you're like well you should have talked about it all i can do is honor people that are in jail and do what they want
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:14:15.240]  i'm not going to sit there and make your decisions for them and plus what does it do saying the judge is a crook they love it they'll be promoted they'll be out playing the probably the judge is probably playing golf today feels great has no sense of injustice ray epps can run around say attack the capitol go in the capitol i orchestrated it he said in his text messages he's ramming signs in the police joe biggs is like shaking shaking a fence 17 years bitch every three years in jail
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:45.240]  you're gonna have a solitary confinement i mean it's just like and you're around these people and you and you get but i'll tell you the unifying thing about them leftists and their minions are dishonorable cowardly nobodies and the world's waking up to them the thing is they're such crap that i don't even wish harm on them i just wanted to get out of my life leave me alone go away well they're not gonna go away and they're not gonna leave everybody alone but let's just use their heads
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:50.679]  it's not about me it's not about joe biggs it's about understanding things it probably was smart
[01:14:50.679 --> 01:15:09.480]  to not have joe biggs on my show a bunch while he was facing this kangaroo trial because i get you know i think norm's right i think if joe would talk crap and they'd all be on the show talking smack that judge hit him and what the feds asked for 45 years in prison
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:23.690]  because the left likes it they're like oh you don't like us putting you in jail cockroaches all over you well guess what you get 45 bitch
[01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:32.089]  but i just love the other patriots that are out there they're like armchair quarterback
[01:15:32.089 --> 01:15:37.690]  Wyatt and Alex Jones and it's on so many subject Wyatt and Alex Jones having them on why he
[01:15:37.690 --> 01:15:39.610]  doesn't care about those people
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:46.080]  One former talk show host that worked here who just kept saying I was censoring when
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.080]  I wasn't
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:50.440]  I was really upset that he was lying and saying I was censoring when I barely even
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.440]  watched his show
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.440]  I'm like, why are you saying that?
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:55.120]  Oh, he doesn't care about his crew he sent there
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.560]  I didn't send Joe Biggs there
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.800]  Joe Biggs hadn't worked here for years
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:02.420]  I didn't send anybody into the damn Capitol
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:05.600]  But Joe didn't do anything in the Capitol
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:13.040]  So the idea that I'm sending people and I'm doing this and I'm all this crap, it's ridiculous
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.400]  But I'm done talking about that
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:19.640]  Because it's not about me, it's not about any of this, it's about the big picture
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:24.620]  People sit back in their armchairs and they think they know how stuff works and they
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:25.620]  don't
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:30.640]  Now Joe's scheduled to call in about seven, eight minutes
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.640]  So let's do this
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:37.060]  Greg Reese's new report and some other little important promo pieces
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:40.600]  And then Joe should be able to get back in in about six, seven, eight minutes
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:44.560]  We'll go to him, I guess technically eight minutes from now I'll be able to call him
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:50.760]  And then I promise to do a deep dive on the ADL
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:55.280]  And I promise to hit some of this other news and so I'm gonna do that
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.960]  And I'm gonna do it more tomorrow night too
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:02.520]  4 to 6 p.m. MTG is gonna be in the studio and a lot more
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.520]  So look for that
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:07.520]  But I appreciate the crew coming in on Saturday and I appreciate General Flynn being here
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:12.560]  And I appreciate everybody else that's supporting the show and spreading the word
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:18.600]  Because we're in the situation we're in and the globalists aren't gonna go away without
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.600]  major opposition
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:28.280]  The bad news is they're not gonna stop because they have this weird inferiority complex
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:33.280]  That they've got to attack good people and dominate us and rape us physically, biologically,
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:36.240]  chemically, medically, spiritually
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:40.180]  But that's also the good news is that they'll get it in the end
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:42.040]  But we don't do it because of vengeance against them
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.740]  They're garbage who cares about them
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:45.000]  We do it for the children
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.760]  It's been said by many a leader throughout history
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.160]  No one knows who first said it
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:52.520]  It's just a cliched maxim because it's so true
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:56.680]  We don't fight for the enemy in front of us that we hate
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:58.200]  We fight for those behind us we love
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.200]  We'll be right back
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:12.660]  The recent fires in California, Australia, and now Hawaii are unlike anything we've ever
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:13.660]  seen before
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:18.420]  They are being called forest fires and wildfires
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:21.100]  But they are clearly something very different
[01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:25.940]  These fires are burning homes into a white powdery ash footprint
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:32.580]  While often leaving the surrounding green trees and shrubs practically untouched
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:38.780]  In extreme cases forest fires can reach temperatures up to 1500 degrees Fahrenheit
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:43.580]  And the melting point of aluminum is 1220 degrees Fahrenheit
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:48.380]  So it is possible for an extreme forest fire to melt aluminum
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:53.940]  But there are cars with puddles of melted aluminum that were clearly not in the wildfire
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:55.740]  area
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:19:01.620]  And melted glass which has a melting point around 2500 degrees Fahrenheit
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:04.320]  These are unexplained anomalies
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:11.020]  In the California fires of 2018, cars were randomly bursting into flames on the freeway
[01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:14.340]  With no surrounding fires
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:20.360]  We've seen these same anomalies in New York City on September 11th 2001
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:24.500]  Cars completely burned out with no explanation
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:30.080]  In Maui these unnatural fires spared the homes of the rich while burning the native
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.700]  homes of the working class
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:40.140]  With precision these fires destroyed the most envied high-valued areas of Maui
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:44.220]  For decades directed energy weapons have been classified
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:47.540]  But they have been on the public record for several years now
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:53.520]  Directed energy weapons known as DEWS have the ability to burn homes with this sort
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.620]  of precision
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:59.500]  But in order to be this precise the area would have to be mapped out
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:04.340]  In January of this year green lasers were seen over Hawaii
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:11.020]  Which could best be described as a geospatial array for mapping terrain
[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:16.140]  We have seen that among the ashy ruins there are blue colored objects that have
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:20.320]  somehow survived the devastation
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.500]  Blue cars
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.780]  Blue umbrellas
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:26.980]  A blue boat
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:28.660]  Blue planters
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:34.660]  Videos online are going viral that show how lasers can easily burn through certain colored
[01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:35.780]  objects
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:43.100]  But objects that are colored blue remain unharmed
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:49.020]  Directed energy weapons include lasers, millimeter wave and microwave
[01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:55.100]  They are all based on light frequencies and different wavelengths of light affect colors
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.460]  differently
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:03.140]  For example, in laser tattoo removal different wavelengths are used for removing different
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:04.140]  colors
[01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:07.660]  And this is because color is a quality of light
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:11.220]  Each color has its own frequency
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:18.100]  Interestingly enough the frequency of the color blue is 6.66
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.820]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees
[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:36.140]  It's just a mask
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:37.900]  It's just six feet
[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:40.500]  It's just non-essential businesses
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.900]  It's just non-essential workers
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:45.460]  It's just until we work it out
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:46.940]  It's just a bar
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:49.140]  It's just a restaurant
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:51.020]  It's just nursing homes
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:52.900]  It's just schools
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:56.180]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:58.740]  It's just until the cases go down
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.980]  It's just to flatten the curve
[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:03.820]  It's just to keep others feeling safe
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:06.300]  It's just for a few more weeks
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:10.860]  It's just gyms, salons, spas and sporting events
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:13.300]  It's just churches and mosques
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:14.980]  It's just singing
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:17.700]  It's just travel
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:20.180]  It's just until we get a vaccine
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:22.100]  It's just for the greater good
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:24.380]  It's just fact checking
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:25.980]  Not censorship
[01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:27.980]  It's just mandatory
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:29.900]  It isn't just at all
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:34.460]  Visit DefendJones.com to help fight back today
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:35.900]  Bodies is back
[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:40.220]  The ultimate turmeric product on the market has returned to InfowarsStore.com

[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:52.300]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year
[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:56.620]  on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:59.420]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:01.740]  Help boost and support flexibility

[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:19.500]  But our super powerful extract used in bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:23.020]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system

[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:52.140]  None of them could change my mind about not wanting the COVID charity protocol to come back
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:57.580]  Send me your non-binary quadruple bags
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:04.940]  Champion, tell me why we need their band-aids and their lockdowns and five masks
[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:09.420]  I didn't take a shot and I'm thankful for you
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:12.540]  that I didn't do that because you awaken me to a lot of things
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:13.820]  How are you doing?
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:16.060]  Good, how are you?
[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:19.420]  Tell us real quick, would you like to wear a mask together if I bring the mandates back?
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.220]  I do not want to wear a mask
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:21.340]  So you're not, well come tell us
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:22.380]  No, no, no
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:22.780]  You won't?
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:24.780]  Avani, you better speak up, they're coming to do it
[01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:27.020]  So I'd say what, five to one are against it?
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.780]  Four shots, four shots
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:29.660]  You want more shots?
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:30.540]  You need a hug
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:31.900]  God, you need more shots
[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.100]  I do, come give me a hug
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.580]  Please don't hurt the baby, please don't give the boys the shots
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:38.380]  Alex Jones turned out to be right
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:41.740]  And Bill Gates and Fauci and Paul Schwab
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:45.820]  They turned out to be wrong because they were lying on purpose
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:48.940]  And they need to go to prison for what they've done
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:50.700]  But the leftists, they don't like us
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:51.980]  They want us to shut up
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:53.340]  They want to shut you up
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:55.260]  We're not going to shut up because we're a mud club
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:59.820]  We have only begun to fight in the information war
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:02.700]  And we will never surrender
[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:06.940]  Never surrender
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:10.460]  Yes, you there in the black Ford truck
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:12.940]  Are you planning to take more shots?
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:23.260]  Here's Harari saying we're going to make aliens on Earth
[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:28.140]  We're going to merge the machines and be a new life form, a new ruling alien class on Earth
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:30.300]  See, they're building the aliens
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:33.180]  The biomedical AI merger with our flesh
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:34.780]  The raping of humanity
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:37.100]  It's the same story from Roswell in the late 40s
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:39.580]  With Colonel Corso, heavily promoted everywhere
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.980]  By the biggest publishers, by the biggest movie makers
[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:43.740]  That was system funded
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:47.740]  Because they don't want you to understand the full spectrum of interdimensional contact
[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:49.500]  And the fact that it's always been here
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.180]  These things actually aren't alien
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:53.740]  They're part of our existence and part of our story here
[01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:55.500]  If anything's the aliens, it's us
[01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:57.020]  But here on this planet by God
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:59.180]  And there's these things that were already basically here
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:01.500]  We've probably not been here as long as this thing's been here
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.260]  If you really read the ancient text of the Bible
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:06.620]  So they don't want you to know it's far more complex and they're not in control of it
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:09.420]  All they're doing is being demonically inspired
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:12.940]  By these creatures that will only give them hellraiser vision
[01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:15.980]  It will only give them how to have technology for evil
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:17.740]  Because it doesn't like us
[01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:22.060]  This is just a training camp where our father has put us here
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:24.700]  We think we're only living on one life
[01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:26.860]  So that we're in this super scared position
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:30.780]  But having all these spiritual and ancestral intergalactic interdimensional memories
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:35.020]  And it's all a giant three-dimensional real scenario war game
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:36.620]  And they don't want you to know that
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:39.100]  And they don't want you to understand they signed on to the wrong team
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:41.980]  They joined with the destructive force, the evil force
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:45.980]  So they can have power during this the third dimensional simulation
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:49.740]  It's a three-dimensional genetic universal simulation
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:50.860]  It's a real simulation
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:52.300]  It's just that it's forever war
[01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:53.980]  You don't die when you die
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:56.940]  You're an electrochemical multi-dimensional creature
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:59.980]  This is only one lowest manifestation of you
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:01.340]  You have glorified heavenly bodies
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:03.740]  There's this first heaven, the second heaven, the third heaven
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:06.540]  It's all right there for you to understand
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:07.740]  And again, what is the heaven?
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:08.700]  A dimension
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:12.060]  They are programming that aliens are these little stupid gray things
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.380]  And they want to kidnap us at night and take stuff from us
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:16.620]  And there is some evidence for some lower level creatures
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:18.780]  They're like a biological android
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:22.300]  This whole big UFO thing is a distraction that
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:24.780]  Oh, the aliens are harassing our ships
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:27.100]  The aliens are harassing our troops
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:30.060]  No, that's the globalist with their advanced technology playing games
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:35.580]  So they can brand contact with the angels and God as the devil
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:37.340]  When really we're here with the devil
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.540]  We're not locked in for the devil
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:39.740]  That was locked in with us
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:43.340]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:47.660]  shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government
[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:52.060]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:53.500]  And that's corporations
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:55.820]  The left have wised up to this
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.780]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.260]  Use companies to do it
[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:02.540]  The social media giants
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:03.340]  And they are
[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:06.540]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that
[01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:09.100]  If you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking
[01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:11.980]  So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:13.900]  Has been the radio show host Alex Jones
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:16.620]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:18.780]  And multinational corporations and big tech
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:21.660]  To silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:25.740]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook
[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:27.660]  And saying, can you ban this person?
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:30.780]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist
[01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:34.780]  But this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find
[01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:38.540]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:43.740]  But instead attack dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:44.620]  Working with big tech
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:46.620]  People know what's true
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:47.980]  They can smell it
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:53.340]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.740]  In a free country, everyone can be heard
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:59.100]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:04.460]  It's a Saturday, emergency broadcast
[01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:09.980]  General Flynn, myself, lay out the globalist next move and how to stop them
[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:10.460]  Joe Biggs
[01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:15.820]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:17.980]  Locked up in the DC gulag
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:22.060]  Can only get in 15 minutes at a time
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:24.780]  You heard him about 15 minutes ago get cut off
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:28.380]  We're waiting for his call again right now
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.660]  The day we got greenlit to get him on the show
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:37.100]  Because again, the political persecutors attack you when you defend yourself
[01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:40.780]  So now that he's sentenced, he's ready to come on the show
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:42.860]  We want to get Stuart Rhodes on
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:44.060]  All of them are political prisoners
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:47.420]  Remember a few months ago, oh, Rams is going to be indicted
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:49.580]  They said in a lawsuit against Fox, didn't happen
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:53.180]  They just create that illusion to get us to stop talking about it
[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:56.140]  Hey, all I know is he said he orchestrated his text messages
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:58.700]  And said go into the Capitol and help ram signs into people
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.020]  He says he'll sue you if you talk about it
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:03.260]  And I'm sure they'll probably sue and have me defaulted
[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:06.060]  And the judge says I'm guilty and $85 billion to him
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:07.180]  So what?
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:11.020]  He did it, he said it
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:13.980]  It's going on, I'm not going to shut up about any of it
[01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:18.060]  But I want to thank everybody that's gone to defendjones.com
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:20.300]  Info wars have stabilized
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:22.140]  The bankruptcy looks like it's going through
[01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:23.820]  Everything I told the court was true
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.260]  Everything that media said was a lie
[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:25.900]  You've seen all that
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:28.380]  We don't have $10 million versus $400 million
[01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:32.940]  And I've got a year of legal bills built up
[01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:36.300]  That I've gotten a really good crop of new lawyers last year
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:38.220]  They haven't been paid yet
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:41.500]  And that's because the judge got lied to and told that I had all this money
[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:42.860]  So the judge said well he can pay his legal bills
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:44.700]  And now the judge is like wait I didn't have any money
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:45.980]  But I still have the old bill
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:48.060]  That's about to all get fixed
[01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:51.020]  The judge has signaled where he now realizes he was lied to
[01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:53.420]  But for now I need to pay that million dollars
[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:54.940]  Like that's a lot of money
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:57.260]  Not really in today's numbers folks with inflation
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:31:00.300]  Trump has spent $67 million this year on lawyers
[01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:03.100]  With hundreds of lawsuits and all the rest of it
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:04.620]  And all the criminal charges
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:05.900]  Great Trump needs support
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:07.820]  Well I don't need $67 million
[01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:08.940]  I need a million dollars
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:11.500]  Or we go off the air
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.500]  Because if they shut me down I can't be here
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:16.460]  Infowarstore.com funds free speech systems
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:17.340]  Great products you need
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:22.700]  But defendjones.com is where you can make straight donations
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:24.380]  And I want to thank the listeners for their support
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:27.020]  I'm going to be thanking more of you tomorrow on the Sunday show
[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:29.100]  But you know who you are
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:31.180]  I think we've raised 60 something thousand dollars
[01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:33.900]  We can put defendjones.com on the screen
[01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:38.140]  And I know I come to you and ask for your support
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:40.220]  And my eyes aren't that good
[01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:41.340]  What's the number there?
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:42.700]  That's $65,000
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:44.460]  Sounds like a lot folks
[01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:47.100]  No that's just you know six percent
[01:31:47.300 --> 01:32:17.300]  of what we need but we're going to get there and I appreciate your support and here I am saying support Joe Biggs political prisoner I mean it takes money to fight these wars or you can just roll over and give up Joe Biggs got back through from the DC jail you've got now 13 minutes before they hang up on you again so Joe I'm just going to give you the floor because I was interrupting earlier because it's good to hear your voice a lot of questions but you've got the floor to talk about the trial what's coming next the state of the country just what you're witnessing
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:47.300]  wants to hear from Joe Biggs political prisoner Joe Biggs yeah the trial was a very interesting process to go through you know we had you know you're told that you're going to be in a you know pick a jury of your peers these aren't our peers the people of DC hate everything that we stand for anyone who's conservative anyone who's right-leaning in any kind of way you're an outcast you're a hated they think that you are the scum of the earth so to say that you're going to get a fair trial in DC is the most you know hilarious thing in the world
[01:32:47.300 --> 01:33:17.300]  people convicted us they won they said so they said that we were guilty from the get-go they didn't care what was shown to them they didn't care that we showed how many times the FBI lied how many times on video that we got the FBI we could see them coursing and changing the words of their own witnesses to fit the narrative that they wanted and still the jury goes I don't care still the judge goes I don't care
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:47.300]  it was the most disheartening thing to go through because you watch you know and we're sitting there we're bringing forth the truth but the truth is that you know the court is not a place for the truth obviously I mean this is a place for you know whatever they're allowed to put through and the judge allowed the government to get away with everything and push whatever they wanted to through and it was it it hurt to watch that you know you go you go in there with your head held high you go in there thinking that you know what we're just
[01:33:47.300 --> 01:34:17.300]  going to keep fighting you know we're going to keep going and this machine is so big they just don't care that's why people need to wake up people need to get off their butts people need to understand that there's a war going on in the sense that you know they're coming after our rights they are doing everything they can to throw us in jail oh oh and war let's talk about the word war apparently I say the word war too much and I know you guys say that it's a war for your mind you gotta watch out Alex the judge brought up the fact that
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:47.060]  I said the war so many times and they even brought it up the prosecution the amount of times I've said war before that's a no-no you can't say that word anymore because then that means you're waging war against the government and you're a terrorist you know the things that came out in this trial just I don't understand it you know you go in there with everything on your side all that's right all that's good and they still don't care the judge still sits there and the same
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:35:16.180]  video that they use they showed I remember when I first got locked up they showed the judge the government showed the judge of me shaking the fence or whatever and the judge his first response was I didn't see anything in there that shows Joe breaking the fence so I'm not going to deny him bell and then he comes back like two two days later and goes that's terrorism lock him up and throws me in jail like it was so weird his initial response he clearly got his he clearly got his orders later
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:38.100]  yeah you know I mean it was so weird it was night and day because he sits there and he looks at he's telling the government like I don't see this you know this doesn't make sense to me that's the same video that they played over and over in trial the same video that they used to get the terrorist enhancement the same stupid video that he goes I don't see it it's not there you know this doesn't really hold any water
[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:42.900]  we'll pull that video up I didn't think to do that but I've seen that video it's just you at the fence
[01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:47.540]  then we have ray epps picking the sign up helping ram it into people that's fine
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:57.780]  yeah I saw so much crazy stuff happening that day and we're the ones that are that are that have
[01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:02.820]  come out to be the worst of the worst they said they said that our actions were the ones that
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:06.900]  our actions were responsible for the well they said you let it they said you did it
[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:12.500]  yeah they said that my military experience is what was what gave me the ability to lead
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:16.340]  an army again but is there video you're saying we go into the capital
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:20.980]  or video of you saying you or text message you're saying you orchestrated it no that's ray epps
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:26.180]  yeah there's none of that whatsoever they have they have a video of me going oh my god I
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:31.060]  can't believe everybody just stormed the capital um there's even a video of me where I'm walking
[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:36.020]  and I'm filming it um and I'm going oh my god we've just walked over the barriers we've just walked
[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:40.020]  over the bears not we've just taken them down or we've just busted them we've just walked over
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:43.700]  because someone else had knocked them down we've just walked over the barriers oh my god
[01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:47.460]  I can't believe this people are storming the capital and there's a lady with a little like
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:52.100]  uh chihuahua going past me faster than I'm going and a guy in a wheelchair passing me but
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:55.860]  they said that I ran up and led the charge and I have people literally passing me as I'm
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:37:00.100]  walking and going oh my god I can't believe this is happening you know I'm saying oh my god
[01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:03.540]  I can't believe this is happening and that's my initial response what does that tell you
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:09.060]  there's not a plan I'm literally shocked by what's happening you know and they go well no no no no no
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:13.940]  he knew this was happening there was a meeting of the mind that happened somehow between them
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:18.180]  and they all agreed that this was going to happen even though there's no proof that there
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:21.940]  was ever on paper that it was said that there was no recording and not one person to ever
[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:26.820]  come forward and not one FBI uh employees ever come forward said that there was a plan
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:30.900]  if there was proof of a plan or anything like that no no no we just somehow had this meeting
[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:36.340]  of the mind that never happened but that's what caused this conspiracy and that's why
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:41.380]  we're now seditious terrorists somehow you know you know if that can happen
[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:43.940]  what else can happen in court what else can they get away with
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:49.300]  and again for some reason we can't find the footage of you just touching the fence
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:53.140]  we have ray apps they're ramming it over the police what's the name of that video
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:56.900]  joe so we can find it we'll add it in post we're live right now but that's something we really
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:38:01.700]  want to air i know they hide all the exculpatory footage but what this is ray apps there he is
[01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:05.220]  ramming it over the police and saying he orchestrated it and saying go into the capital
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:10.980]  but that's okay well the very first the very first the very first the very very first
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:15.620]  january 6th committee hearing was on donald trump and me the very first one if you remember
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:20.180]  the very first one they talked about donald trump for the first half and then joe biggs and
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:25.940]  the female cop that gets knocked over by ray uh ryan fancil goes joe biggs was in the crowd and he
[01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:31.460]  had his bullhorn he looked at me and said i don't like cops and cops are trash and everybody come
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:35.700]  and you know take out the cops or some crap like that and i'm like it i'm sitting here
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:40.740]  watching this from jail going are you serious that never happened and there's literally footage
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:46.100]  of another man with a bullhorn telling people to charge the fence that he needs the men at the
[01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:50.820]  front for the women to get out of the way to push that fence over and then she says that i
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:56.180]  lean into ryan fancil's ear and that he's the one who comes and takes out the fence no
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:01.860]  that's not me that's ray epps it's incredible it's incredible so we're showing the footage
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:05.060]  where you're standing at the fence doing nothing this is your terrace now because of
[01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:08.900]  this footage we're showing right now you standing against a fence so
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:14.660]  how are the other guys doing or do you see them or what's happening
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:19.780]  yeah yeah they're all sitting around you know um uh enrique is reading the paper in front of
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:23.620]  me right now but he can't talk because his trial i mean he's been in things not until
[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:28.020]  tuesday um but uh he would like to come on if you guys want to have enrique tarrio and next
[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:32.980]  week he said he'd be interested in coming on um you know well we want them all because i've
[01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:36.580]  been waiting to get you on but obviously we didn't want to start the court up so so when
[01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:40.180]  when can enrique come on enrique enrique
[01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:45.380]  when do you want to come on with alex? next week? afterwards?
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:54.120]  you want to come on with alex next week? okay like wednesday? okay wednesday he said he can do it
[01:39:54.839 --> 01:39:58.519]  we're literally talking to american political prisoners we got four minutes left before they
[01:39:58.519 --> 01:40:02.120]  cut you off you i'm gonna just anything else you want to add right now joe biggs?
[01:40:02.839 --> 01:40:09.799]  yes so you know it was amazing you know i walk out of the courtroom you know i'm sitting there
[01:40:09.799 --> 01:40:14.759]  i'm going through my mind after the sentencing i'm like it's hard to take it in you know 17
[01:40:14.759 --> 01:40:19.480]  years that's a big number you know and your life kind of flashes before your eyes you start to
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:24.839]  wonder like you know wow like is this it is this really it but then you have to pull yourself back
[01:40:24.839 --> 01:40:29.000]  up and you have to go no this isn't it this is only the beginning this is where god starts to do
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.679]  his miracles because when you're left with nothing and you're sitting there and your hands
[01:40:32.679 --> 01:40:37.400]  are tied behind your back and you're in jail and you're in solitary confinement that's when god
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:41.559]  really comes through and works miracles and i believe we're going to see miracles happen and i
[01:40:41.559 --> 01:40:45.320]  believe god's going to have something good come out of this because there's just been so much
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:50.839]  bad going on we're seeing this country in such a decline and i guarantee you soon we're going
[01:40:50.839 --> 01:40:55.240]  to start seeing some miracles happen and you know it was heartfelt you know i walked through
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:59.240]  the door of the uh into the prison and everybody ran up to me and gave me a hug
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:03.000]  and everybody sat there in line and they came up and shook my hand and you know you could see
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.679]  the hurt in their eyes to hear that you know i just got 17 years you know and it was an emotional
[01:41:08.679 --> 01:41:12.839]  thing you know to have all these men that have been here with you they've gone to the same thing
[01:41:12.839 --> 01:41:17.160]  and you see them just go oh my god i can't believe this happened to you like you didn't do
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:21.240]  anything everybody here knows that we didn't do anything these other people will even say look
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:26.920]  i did this i i screwed up i did something bad i was violent i did that but everyone agrees we
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:32.360]  didn't do a single thing worthy of this and yet we're the ones being hated on the most because
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:36.200]  we're the only ones that were willing to stand up to antifa we're the only ones who are willing
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:40.440]  to go out there and speak our minds and say what the government was doing wrong and they came
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:44.280]  after us and they want to shut us up and they want to scare the american public by what they're
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:48.120]  doing to us and what they're doing to us should piss you off it shouldn't scare you
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:53.400]  it should get you to want to go out and stand up for your wife's more to not sit there when
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.599]  it comes time to go vote and go well i think i just won't vote this time i think there's
[01:41:56.599 --> 01:41:59.879]  enough people who are going to go vote for donald trump this time no you've got to get
[01:41:59.879 --> 01:42:04.599]  off your butt and go do it because if not i'm staying in jail forever our lives depend on
[01:42:04.599 --> 01:42:08.519]  people getting off their butts and going out and doing the right thing and putting good
[01:42:08.519 --> 01:42:13.080]  people in office that will help bring sanity back to this country my life depends on it my
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:19.000]  daughter's future depends on the american people to stop sitting around and stop being lazy to
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.960]  pull your heads out of your butt and go to the battle boxes and do the right thing please
[01:42:24.679 --> 01:42:28.280]  well it sounds like you're buoyed by the fact that people know that you're innocent
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:34.839]  and that this is all a lie yes i mean it doesn't matter where we go people come up to us and go
[01:42:34.839 --> 01:42:39.960]  this this is a travesty you shouldn't be here i mean i have hardcore criminals on the bus ride
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:44.360]  back from the courthouse back here to the jail there's a guy sitting beside me he just
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:51.799]  got picked up for selling 13 illegal firearms in dc that should be five years for each weapon
[01:42:51.799 --> 01:42:57.400]  he got two-year deal he got a two-year plea deal he's laughing at me he goes oh my god
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:01.320]  another guy goes man i just got like so and so many years for murder he goes you could have
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:05.320]  killed someone got out quicker than me you know because they put you in a bus with a bunch of
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:08.839]  prisoners they bring you back to the jail and it's different people from different walks of life
[01:43:08.839 --> 01:43:12.360]  that are there for different crimes you know and everyone's like oh my god like i i can't
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:18.679]  believe that a guy who walked around who has no criminal record is now considered a terrorist
[01:43:18.679 --> 01:43:23.320]  oh people are pointing out that rapists that beat women up and torture him get two years
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:31.080]  and you get 17 years yeah i mean it's crazy when you see like hardened gang bangers guys who've been
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:35.960]  you know their whole lives you know doing stuff like this you know going out shooting at people
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:39.879]  beating people up beating them after death and they look at you and go man you don't deserve
[01:43:39.879 --> 01:43:44.759]  to be here you're not like me like i deserve to be in jail they'll say they go but you don't
[01:43:44.759 --> 01:43:48.200]  you should be at home right now with your daughter you deserve to be out there on the
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:57.719]  streets not us but you do and i guarantee myself ethan nor dean zachary real dominic basola or
[01:43:57.719 --> 01:44:01.799]  enrico tarrio will have similar stories from their experiences over the last three years
[01:44:01.799 --> 01:44:06.200]  at the jail they've been to no one thinks that we should be here no one believes that
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:12.759]  this is actually happening but it is and people need to understand that it's time to do something
[01:44:12.759 --> 01:44:18.040]  everything that's happening to trump it's happened to me already now it's happening to him
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:25.160]  and then guess what it's gonna happen to you do you have hope that if trump gets elected
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:30.599]  despite all the challenges he'll pardon you oh i know he'll pardon us i believe that with all
[01:44:30.599 --> 01:44:36.679]  my heart you know the thing is is hopefully getting him uh you know for him to be able
[01:44:36.679 --> 01:44:41.639]  to get into the position where he can at least be i think on the ballot to run right because
[01:44:41.639 --> 01:44:47.559]  once you have one minute remaining election interference right it's election interference if
[01:44:47.639 --> 01:44:52.759]  they start trying to go after him once he's on there i have to understand that the legalities
[01:44:52.759 --> 01:44:58.920]  of that but i do believe that donald j trump will pardon us and he should we didn't do anything
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:04.200]  you know we're we're his supporters we went there like yes and things went wrong that day
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:08.920]  and that's sad and that's well there's no doubt they set us all up they were all patsies
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:13.240]  that day joe you've got to come back on anytime you want on the broadcast

[01:46:02.759 --> 01:46:08.759]  here and again i was not having these guys on because their lawyers didn't want to get

[01:46:12.599 --> 01:46:16.839]  know the inside baseball now you do so you can all feel morally superior and do the things you

[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:27.320]  that the guys are ready to come on we'll have them all on and i think they're probably right
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:33.480]  i think i think the judges would have given them you know 40 years 45 years that the uh
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.200]  evil globalists they're not feds they're people that have hijacked our government
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:44.679]  were asking for if they would have done interviews so this is quite a moment to be alive but we've
[01:46:44.679 --> 01:46:50.360]  got to roll our sleeves up then admit the predicament we're in
[01:46:52.839 --> 01:46:55.160]  and do something about it because it's not going to get any better bowing down
[01:46:55.719 --> 01:46:59.559]  putting on the knee pads like kamala harris is going to get us out of this
[01:46:59.639 --> 01:47:00.280]  get us out of this

[01:47:29.559 --> 01:47:33.400]  i got a few things i'm gonna hit right now that's why i'm moving the adl thing again to tomorrow
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:38.120]  and i'm gonna hit it monday and tuesday because it is a it and i also now
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:43.639]  i already knew the inside baseball on musk whether he's good or not
[01:47:44.679 --> 01:47:50.679]  and he wasn't good before he wasn't totally bad but he's been a globalist darling
[01:47:50.679 --> 01:47:54.040]  but he got power he got to be the richest man in the world
[01:47:54.290 --> 01:48:24.290]  and they took his son and are getting ready to chop his peepee off. That'll wake anybody up. His firstborn son. They want that firstborn don't they? And another one of his children got killed it looks like by a vaccine with sudden infant death syndrome. And again, Musk lives here in Austin. I'm not going to get into any stuff here.
[01:48:24.290 --> 01:48:54.290]  I don't know what my sources are, but we have to be ready for Musk to come over to our side. And Vivek Ramaswami, sure he was a leftist before. He's joining us. The things he's saying are devastating them. And they're coming after him on every front. So I really want to caution everybody to not be Pharisees. Because you know what happened in Christ's day. There were these members of the Sanhedrin and the rabbis that said they were holier than thou. Not all of them, but some of them.
[01:48:54.290 --> 01:49:24.290]  They're always talking about how they were perfect and they were good and everybody else was bad. But Christ was talking to the tax collectors, the prostitutes and people that actually wanted to be reformed. Like when he was dying on the cross or about to die. And he got the thief, the murderer and one of them believes in God, the other doesn't. So he says you'll be with me today in paradise. So it doesn't mean I turn my back and don't watch Ramaswami or Musk. But I mean, look, it doesn't take a rocket science.
[01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:54.290]  And just to know, pun intended, that when you're, I mean, Musk came out today. In fact, I didn't see the article. I thought I sent it to you guys. It's an InfoWars.com article. It's a ZeroHedge article. He responded and tweeted today. In fact, print it for me because I didn't see it. You may have given it to me, but I missed it. And he said, he said, yeah, the head of my marketing has been meeting with them just like you meet in a mafia war with the other side that meetings with them. He said the ADL has done everything.
[01:49:54.290 --> 01:50:24.290]  They can. Here's the quote. ADL has tried very hard to strangle X Twitter. Elon Musk responds to hashtag ban the ADL. And he says, just because I'm meeting with the extortionist, you know, Don Corleone met with the guys that shot him in the Godfather. It's all based on true story, different names. Doesn't mean Musk is with him. No, they're getting ready to chop his firstborn son's penis off.
[01:50:24.290 --> 01:50:32.290]  The children, the evidence of one was killed by a vaccine. His brother almost died for one. And he's like, you know what? I'm not. Yeah, there's his son.
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:33.179]  Captured by the enemy. I don't care how rich and powerful you are. If you're not pure evil, having your son getting ready to have his balls cut off will get your attention real quick. Prison's bad, but having your son's balls cut off is bad. It's worse.
[01:50:54.250 --> 01:51:00.250]  That's where this is.
[01:51:00.370 --> 01:51:08.890]  No, I actually know people that know us very closely.
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:13.940]  It's too big a subject to talk about at this point, but...
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:41.610]  Their words are, is, Musk is crazy, because he's partying with people on our team completely. These are very prominent people. Musk is completely pissed and out of his mind at the New World Order. Because they're getting ready to chop his son's balls off. That might piss you off. Like RFK Jr. Blew his father way right in front of him, killed his uncle on national television.
[01:51:41.630 --> 01:52:08.110]  Do you think RFK Jr.'s for real? I don't know, somebody murders your daddy. Do you like him? Nah, come on. This thing's a lot more important than money and power. Like vengeance and vendettas. So, I mean, the stuff they've done to me makes me, I'll never give up. And they haven't killed my family. They might have tried.
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:29.660]  So no, there's not just evil in the world, folks, there's not just Larry Fink and the Rockefellers and Obama, that joke. They have the money and the power and the media, but they don't have much else. They don't have your soul. They don't have your mind. They don't have your will.
[01:52:29.670 --> 01:52:45.520]  No, Tucker Carlson's now awake, Joe Rogan's now awake, could talk for hours about all the people, the James Woods of the worlds and the Tulsi Gabbards and the
[01:52:45.540 --> 01:53:15.540]  Russell Brand, pretty much anybody popular is on our side because humans have a way about us when we finally get down and we know we're about to go down. We just say, you know what? How about we just have a fight? Because I said this a lot. I'll say it again. I don't know how all this is going to end. We didn't start this fight.
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:45.540]  I'm backing down. So I guess if you want to fight, you better believe you got one. That's what you're looking for. You came to the right place. The truth is God has a sixth sense of humor and I get God. I don't judge God. So many people look at God giving us free will and they see all the bad things that happen and they tell the persecution of pain. They say God's a sadist.
[01:53:45.540 --> 01:54:11.080]  No, if anything, God's lonely. God made billions of creatures with free will and an understanding of the universe and the ability to interface with infinity. And I'm just thankful for the power I've been given and the will I've been given and the freedom I've been given to make that choice. And I just say to the creator, beam me up, master.
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:41.100]  You are so perfect. You are so good. I understand you. At least I think I do. I don't plan to understand God, but you know I understand God. I got God fear. And I just appreciate this. I've been put on this gorgeous planet and all this wonderful universe and I can experience beauty and culture and everything and just be alive and have my family.
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:55:10.770]  And just do, this is amazing. Wow. Wow. What a ride. What an amusement park. What an incredible thing. And then yeah, I go do bad stuff and it's your fault. Somebody else does something. So it's your fault for making us know you gave us free will. Little G, not a God, little God. And some Christians don't like that. Fake Christians are like, God's blessed me to say we're God. I didn't say I was God.
[01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:15.790]  Genesis says we are made in the image of God.
[01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:19.990]  Figure that out yet.
[01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:25.030]  Yeah.
[01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:30.310]  So I do appreciate being made in the image of the creator.
[01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:33.750]  And I'm not prideful about it, I'm very humble about it, but I'm like, uh, I'm gonna do whatever
[01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:35.750]  you're gonna tell me to do.
[01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:38.470]  Baba, just please take me with you.
[01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:42.610]  I got, oh, I get it, oh, please.
[01:55:42.610 --> 01:55:43.610]  Let me do whatever.
[01:55:43.610 --> 01:55:45.610]  Oh, you don't like cowards?
[01:55:45.610 --> 01:55:48.670]  Well you just tell me whatever I gotta do to prove I'm not one of those.
[01:55:48.670 --> 01:55:50.190]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:50.190 --> 01:55:55.290]  You tell me jump, I say, how high I'm going to click my heels eight times.
[01:55:55.290 --> 01:55:56.290]  I'm going to do it.
[01:55:56.290 --> 01:55:58.690]  You want me to get fed into a wood chipper?
[01:55:58.690 --> 01:56:01.630]  You want me to spend a trillion years in a hell hole?
[01:56:01.630 --> 01:56:07.590]  I'll do it because I've already had a little taste of the next level.
[01:56:07.590 --> 01:56:13.770]  Total completion, total victory, total understanding, mastery of everything.
[01:56:13.770 --> 01:56:14.830]  It's called God.
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:18.600]  And I'm addicted.
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:25.560]  But nothing worth anything is free.
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:29.200]  Nothing that has value is easily gained.
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:30.520]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:56:31.570 --> 01:56:37.570]  So I want to play a disgusting clip, but first I want to take a piss.
[01:56:37.570 --> 01:56:44.570]  It's an era promo, and I'm going to come back with one of the most disgusting people I've ever met.
[01:56:44.570 --> 01:56:46.570]  And that's Sean Penn.
[01:56:46.570 --> 01:56:53.570]  I mean, you talk about an arrogant husk of a creature, a demon, who wants World War III.
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:57:04.520]  Who now just said the quiet part aloud.
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:11.640]  He says the lockdowns are a mandatory rehearsal for things to come.
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:17.720]  This sick creature wants to lock you up because it makes him feel powerful.
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:21.200]  Where have we heard of that before?
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:26.840]  And I'm going to tell you why, Sean Penn, you're so obsessed with locking us up, because
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:29.400]  you're about to get your ass locked up culturally, spiritually.
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:35.360]  You're not going to get locked up in some cell.
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:40.640]  You're about to get locked up with people like you, dimensionally.
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:42.640]  You're about to be cut off from the source.
[01:57:42.710 --> 01:57:52.470]  So that's why he spends all his time trying to claw us into his hell with him.
[01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:57.910]  Because the man is a retarded joke.
[01:57:57.910 --> 01:58:00.430]  I don't mean that meaning it's down syndrome and so on.
[01:58:00.430 --> 01:58:03.510]  I've had dinner with Sean Penn.
[01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:09.230]  The man 16 years 17, whenever it was, is a moron.
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:21.000]  But aren't the servants of the devil morons?
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:27.200]  He literally wants to starve you to death and make you eat bugs because it makes this
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:30.719]  goofus feel powerful.
[01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:45.110]  He's a retarded drug addict.
[01:58:45.110 --> 01:58:49.390]  But what does it say about us when we let retarded, pedophile drug addicts like Joe
[01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:51.710]  Biden run our lives?
[01:58:51.710 --> 01:58:54.410]  God doesn't like that.
[01:58:54.410 --> 01:59:01.250]  So you know who God hates more than cowards?
[01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:04.310]  People that don't take their destiny in their hands.
[01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:06.269]  People that don't love beauty.
[01:59:06.269 --> 01:59:07.269]  People that don't love strength.
[01:59:07.269 --> 01:59:08.050]  People that don't love...
[01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:15.360]  ...the animating contest of liberty.
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:20.000]  And I am just so thankful to God, and I don't think our demonic enemies have any imagination.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  In fact, I know they don't, because if they ever saw what I've seen, if they ever felt
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.599]  for one millisecond...
[01:59:30.750 --> 01:59:44.990]  ...the third heaven. It is heaven. That's why it's called that. It's not completion.
[01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:53.450]  It's not satisfaction. It's not ecstasy. It is timeless, total understanding and love
[01:59:53.450 --> 02:00:04.090]  and a feeling of contentment that is so transformative to just bathe in the consciousness of the creator.
[02:00:04.090 --> 02:00:10.310]  And it all makes sense. And I'm just blessed, because I unfortunately know this, most people
[02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:15.570]  have not been as blessed as I've been to experience, I know there's higher levels but
[02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:22.900]  what I've been given access to only five, six times.
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:27.460]  Is.
[02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:38.230]  So good that I would spend trillions of years in hell to have one moment of this and
[02:00:38.230 --> 02:00:39.110]  I've already been given it.
[02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:49.300]  Because I already experienced it when I was a very young child.
[02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:57.780]  Full space, interdimensional level, had a recurring dream, was the gate being opened.
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:04.180]  But it wasn't until I did the work and stood against the enemy that it interdimensionally
[02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:11.780]  created enough charge to then break the wall and go to the next level.
[02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:18.220]  And that's why God does this, is because we've got to be persecuted by evil so that we can
[02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:22.500]  recognize the opposite of it.
[02:01:22.500 --> 02:01:25.780]  Because if you're just given something, you don't appreciate it.
[02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:27.340]  Everybody knows that.
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:34.900]  You've got to be shown the other side before you can be shown infinity.
[02:01:34.970 --> 02:01:43.970]  All right, let's play this clip. I'll come back and get to Sean Penn.
[02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:47.970]  Go to hell, New World Order.
[02:01:55.970 --> 02:01:56.970]  What kept you?
[02:01:56.970 --> 02:01:58.970]  We ran into some old friends.
[02:01:58.970 --> 02:01:59.970]  Is she all right?
[02:01:59.970 --> 02:02:01.970]  Seems okay if we can get to it.
[02:02:04.970 --> 02:02:09.970]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine.
[02:02:19.970 --> 02:02:24.970]  Harrison, visit infowars.com forward slash show now.
[02:02:27.970 --> 02:02:29.970]  Oh, but that old man got the tractor beamed by the commissioner.
[02:02:29.970 --> 02:02:31.970]  This is going to be a real short trip, okay?
[02:02:31.970 --> 02:02:32.970]  Yes!
[02:02:32.970 --> 02:02:39.970]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:02:39.970 --> 02:02:43.970]  Visit infowars.com forward slash show today.

[02:03:07.970 --> 02:03:11.970]  And it's only here because of you, so I humbly appreciate you.
[02:03:11.970 --> 02:03:13.970]  I say that you should support the transmission.

[02:03:19.970 --> 02:03:28.970]  Free speech has got about 5% gas, which is high.
[02:03:28.970 --> 02:03:30.970]  That's the highest we've been in the black in a few years.
[02:03:30.970 --> 02:03:32.970]  So we're about 5% above the red.
[02:03:32.970 --> 02:03:35.970]  Infowars is somewhat halfway, barely stabilized.
[02:03:35.970 --> 02:03:37.970]  I have no money to pay my legal fees.
[02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:39.970]  The judge said I had to pay half of them.
[02:03:39.970 --> 02:03:40.970]  I don't have any money.
[02:03:40.970 --> 02:03:41.970]  They lied and said it.
[02:03:41.970 --> 02:03:45.970]  The judge said he's about to reverse that, or it looks like he is, but he signaled that.
[02:03:45.970 --> 02:03:47.970]  But you want me to fight somebody?
[02:03:47.970 --> 02:03:50.970]  I mean, I'm taking on the Democratic Party, the whole New World Order.
[02:03:50.970 --> 02:03:53.970]  Trump's already spent $67 million this year on lawyers.
[02:03:53.970 --> 02:03:56.970]  I've been, in the last year, a million dollars in the hole.
[02:03:56.970 --> 02:04:00.970]  I want to thank all of you that went to defendjones.com and made donations.

[02:04:46.970 --> 02:04:52.970]  I have to come here and ask for your help because the court is still not approved.
[02:04:52.970 --> 02:04:55.970]  My salary, I've not been paid when I was supposed to be.
[02:04:55.970 --> 02:04:56.970]  I can't pay my legal bills.
[02:04:56.970 --> 02:04:58.970]  And so I am in your hands.
[02:04:58.970 --> 02:05:01.970]  You're making the decision whether to keep us on air or not.
[02:05:01.970 --> 02:05:04.970]  We have amazing products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:04.970 --> 02:05:06.970]  And you are literally changing history.
[02:05:06.970 --> 02:05:08.970]  The globalists are so angry.
[02:05:08.970 --> 02:05:10.970]  These aren't just words, listen to me.
[02:05:10.970 --> 02:05:12.970]  They're so angry we're still on air.
[02:05:12.970 --> 02:05:18.970]  They're so upset that they haven't silenced us because they haven't broken your will.
[02:05:18.970 --> 02:05:20.970]  They haven't gotten you to give up.
[02:05:20.970 --> 02:05:22.970]  So spread the word, please.
[02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:24.970]  Share the article, share the video, share the clips.
[02:05:24.970 --> 02:05:26.970]  You're doing it, I see it, intensify it.
[02:05:26.970 --> 02:05:28.970]  Call and talk radio, plug the show, whatever you got to do.
[02:05:28.970 --> 02:05:30.970]  It's having a big effect.
[02:05:30.970 --> 02:05:32.970]  Infowars and Alex Jones was right.
[02:05:32.970 --> 02:05:34.970]  And I'm very humble about this because I'm not perfect.
[02:05:34.970 --> 02:05:37.970]  But it's a rallying point that people are saying, you want to destroy this guy?
[02:05:37.970 --> 02:05:38.970]  We got us back.
[02:05:38.970 --> 02:05:41.970]  Thank you for myself, the crew, my family.

[02:06:17.970 --> 02:06:18.970]  You are my champions.

[02:06:19.970 --> 02:06:20.970]  Thank you to the crew.

[02:06:24.970 --> 02:06:26.970]  4 p.m. Central.
[02:06:26.970 --> 02:06:28.970]  Marjorie Taylor Greene in studio.
[02:06:29.970 --> 02:06:31.970]  The ADL Deep Dive and more.
[02:06:31.970 --> 02:06:33.970]  4 p.m. Central, 5 p.m. Eastern.
[02:06:33.970 --> 02:06:35.970]  God bless and good luck.
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:07:05.840]  On March 20th, 2003,
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:12.840]  the United States invaded Iraq. Exactly one year before the invasion, Alex Jones predicted it.
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:19.840]  So now everybody's going, wow, it really was the Iraqis. That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq. What a beautiful setup.
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:34.840]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next. Visit infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:40.840]  I didn't realize this was back this week. I thought it was next week. I come in this morning. It's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:48.840]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula. And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys. Overhead shot, please.
[02:07:48.840 --> 02:08:01.840]  Look how full this bottle is. Right to the top, folks. Right to the top with these 95 percent curcumin oil.
[02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:12.840]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5 percent. Some are maybe 10. The other strongest brands are 75 percent. This is 95 percent.
[02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:20.840]  Super constant. It's like taking one pill. It's like taking 10 of the average pill. It's that powerful. Or more.
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:34.840]  So they're available at infowarsstore.com. Body's ultimate turmeric formula. Pulled out for almost eight months back in stock at infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:45.840]  It's just a mask. It's just six feet. It's just nonessential businesses. It's just nonessential workers. It's just until we work it out.
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:55.840]  It's just a bar. It's just a restaurant. It's just nursing homes. It's just schools. It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:09:03.840]  It's just until the cases go down. It's just to flatten the curve. It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:17.840]  It's just for a few more weeks. It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events. It's just churches and mosques. It's just singing. It's just travel.
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:27.840]  It's just until we get a vaccine. It's just for the greater good. It's just fact checking. Not censorship. It's just mandatory.
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:33.840]  It isn't just at all. Visit defendjones.com to help fight back today.
