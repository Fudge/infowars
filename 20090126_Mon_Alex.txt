[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:27.360]  Texas Alex Jones I am so excited and so focused on this Obama film the Obama
[00:27.360 --> 00:35.520]  deception there I've announced the official name that I'm torn I want to
[00:35.520 --> 00:40.440]  spend time with my family I know my family has no future if I don't stay up
[00:40.440 --> 00:47.040]  here and work hard we work till three in the morning on Saturday we work till
[00:47.040 --> 00:52.000]  midnight last night and here I am back live on the radio right now and I'm
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  I mean I'm even debating whether I should go home today for dinner to see my
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.160]  family and come back or if I should just stay here because I have set the
[01:00.160 --> 01:06.920]  deadline because time is of the essence to release the Obama deception at
[01:06.920 --> 01:21.680]  prisonplanet.tv and on DVD on the 15th of March 2009 or about what we're
[01:21.680 --> 01:29.120]  talking 28 days and then four days so we're talking 32 days with 15 on it so
[01:29.120 --> 01:35.960]  we're talking about less than 50 days to get this documentary done and for months
[01:35.960 --> 01:43.080]  we've been preparing the research the footage the clips and doing interviews
[01:43.080 --> 01:49.400]  man on the street we got to interview with a KRS-1 that'll definitely be in
[01:49.400 --> 01:56.640]  there Webster Tarpley economist other folks and I see these silly comments on
[01:56.640 --> 02:02.440]  infowars.com but I only address this to show the lack of reality the lack of
[02:02.440 --> 02:05.640]  being you know connected to reality people are like why didn't you release
[02:05.640 --> 02:12.120]  this film before he was elected well it I mean it takes even a big organization
[02:12.120 --> 02:15.320]  months and months and months to make a documentary we're a small organization
[02:15.320 --> 02:22.920]  and we I wear all these other dual hats plus we didn't know until about six
[02:22.920 --> 02:28.120]  months ago that seven months ago I figured out by Bilderberg 2008 that he
[02:28.120 --> 02:33.280]  was the heir apparent and still we have to let his agenda take shape you know
[02:33.280 --> 02:36.520]  if I would have been a Barack Obama film before the election people would have
[02:36.520 --> 02:40.560]  been well what's your proof he's gonna do all this no now he's in office now
[02:40.560 --> 02:47.000]  everything we said he was gonna do he's doing and so we have all the evidence
[02:47.000 --> 02:54.600]  all the material and and this is not gonna be a film about you know his real
[02:54.600 --> 02:59.040]  name or the fact that he's from Indonesia or the fact that he's may not be a
[02:59.040 --> 03:05.800]  proper you know full-blown US citizen eligible to be president we're not gonna
[03:05.800 --> 03:10.760]  get into all you know all the weathermen and terrorists and people we're gonna get
[03:10.760 --> 03:13.640]  into all the corrupt money launderers and scam artists they're in his
[03:13.640 --> 03:17.400]  administration we're gonna get into how they're a bunch of Chicago thugs that's
[03:17.400 --> 03:21.400]  a very small part of the film we come out in the film and attack George Bush
[03:21.400 --> 03:25.560]  this is meant to shatter left-right paradigms not put people tighter in
[03:25.560 --> 03:30.760]  their left-right labels the establishment you know plays limbaugh off
[03:30.760 --> 03:37.640]  against Obama Obama off against limbaugh to reaffirm the two wings of the same
[03:37.640 --> 03:43.640]  bird a prey that's feeding on us this carrion bird that seeks to create you
[03:43.640 --> 03:49.680]  know a devastation of rotten flesh in society so it can feed and feed and
[03:49.680 --> 03:56.200]  feed now we get into who his advisors are who out there globalist how he calls
[03:56.200 --> 03:58.920]  for new world order how they're all calling for world government what world
[03:58.920 --> 04:02.840]  government means the builder bird group setting up the banking implosion
[04:02.840 --> 04:06.600]  exactly what they're doing with the whole financial mess so really it's a
[04:06.600 --> 04:13.880]  barack obama slash financial implosion report and and how we're at the same
[04:13.880 --> 04:19.040]  crossroads we were in in 1913 when the private bankers took over the u.s. and
[04:19.040 --> 04:22.560]  created their income tax to pay themselves not one red set of the income
[04:22.560 --> 04:25.880]  tax goes around the country all goes to interest of the foreign banks how we're
[04:25.880 --> 04:30.000]  now at federal reserve 2.0 this is now the final world government we're
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.200]  openly the private banks will openly you'll pay your taxes to them your new
[04:33.200 --> 04:38.880]  carbon taxes and they're setting up that body right now and so we get into that
[04:38.880 --> 04:44.360]  we get into the youth brigades the gun confiscation how they plan to implode
[04:44.360 --> 04:49.840]  the economy so government can be the savior this is the film we need exposing
[04:49.840 --> 04:55.280]  Obama exposing the republicans working with him exposing the banker looting and
[04:55.280 --> 05:03.200]  and hijacking of our country the banker to the Obama deception with rising
[05:03.200 --> 05:07.320]  unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in

[08:28.080 --> 08:38.400]  chatter accelerate to attack speed lock your ex foils in position we're going in
[08:38.400 --> 08:44.520]  we're going in full throttle ladies and gentlemen we are going to take on Barack
[08:44.520 --> 08:50.840]  Obama at the peak of his power just like I took on George Bush at the peak of his
[08:50.840 --> 08:55.280]  power after they staged the 9-11 attacks before they launched the attacks I
[08:55.280 --> 08:59.400]  took them on on the attacks I said call the White House tell them don't stage
[08:59.400 --> 09:03.240]  the terror attack and we even named the World Trade Center as their probable
[09:03.240 --> 09:11.080]  target and Osama bin Laden as their fall guy as their patsy and I'm telling you
[09:11.080 --> 09:17.040]  now that it is even worse than Webster Tardley has said he was absolutely right
[09:17.040 --> 09:22.200]  about everything he laid out and I don't always see things coming I I did see
[09:22.200 --> 09:26.400]  that Obama was their heir apparent by Bilderberg last year but I just couldn't
[09:26.400 --> 09:32.840]  imagine a messianic type Hitler or Stalin of the 30s and 40s and 50s a
[09:32.840 --> 09:38.320]  mousy tongue of the 50s and 60s but they're actually doing it they're
[09:38.320 --> 09:43.280]  setting it up and we realize here in this office this is a very serious
[09:43.280 --> 09:47.320]  undertaking that's why we're so committed with the Obama deception and
[09:47.320 --> 09:51.680]  that's why I'm asking everybody in the alternative media to support this film
[09:51.680 --> 09:56.200]  I'm asking you the listeners to get the word out about this documentary because
[09:56.200 --> 10:02.600]  it will lay out the real agenda of Obama and why he's so dangerous and it
[10:02.600 --> 10:07.560]  will do it in the one way that will actually damage their new world order
[10:07.560 --> 10:10.560]  operation and that is shattering the left-right paradigm if you attack
[10:10.560 --> 10:16.600]  Obama from a right-wing position it only strengthens him because the right-wing
[10:16.600 --> 10:23.160]  attacks and positions are not based in reality predominantly and they continue
[10:23.160 --> 10:28.160]  to pose as if the Republican Party is the answer to Obama when both of those
[10:28.160 --> 10:32.320]  parties are working in tandem and most Americans in major polls understand
[10:32.320 --> 10:37.040]  that Congress still has a 9% approval rating the people are just being fooled
[10:37.040 --> 10:41.000]  at least a large portion of the public by Obama thinking he's an outsider not
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.960]  knowing his pedigree not knowing his policies not knowing who his real
[10:44.960 --> 10:48.440]  advisors are and they're being fooled by the little stunt of him saying they'll
[10:48.440 --> 10:53.000]  look at closing Guandamo sometime in a year when they're announcing that
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.120]  they're only going to have new camps and indefinite detention here in the
[10:56.120 --> 11:00.760]  United States and as you notice that right on time two former Gitmo detainees
[11:00.760 --> 11:06.000]  pop up in these highly produced little clips saying they're with Al Qaeda and
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.480]  they're going to get us right when they're talking about shutting down
[11:08.480 --> 11:12.000]  Guantanamo I mean that is completely stay people simple what's Guantanamo for
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.160]  they don't have real terrorists there it's there to get fake confessions and
[11:15.160 --> 11:21.120]  it's there to recruit operatives who will then go out and play the part of
[11:21.120 --> 11:25.840]  terrorists for the New World Order so I mean that is so easy to read but for a
[11:25.840 --> 11:29.680]  half-awake public that just kind of you know walks by the TV set while that's on
[11:29.680 --> 11:33.680]  they think oh look they let him out of Guantanamo and now they're top Al Qaeda
[11:33.680 --> 11:39.760]  commanders these two latest guys they dropped off in Saudi Arabia two years
[11:39.760 --> 11:46.520]  ago after three plus years in Gitmo and they just pop up as Al Qaeda operatives
[11:46.520 --> 11:50.720]  I mean give me a break ladies and gentlemen it's just like the supposed
[11:50.720 --> 11:54.480]  hijackers trained at US military bases and when they leave the country to go
[11:54.480 --> 12:00.240]  spy on real Muslim terror groups and the embassies won't let them back into the
[12:00.240 --> 12:05.400]  US they tell them look for CIA let them in but bottom line ladies and gentlemen
[12:05.400 --> 12:11.640]  the Obama deception trailer is up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com right
[12:11.640 --> 12:20.480]  now in hindsight I mean we show in the trailer that it's bipartisan that the
[12:20.480 --> 12:24.120]  Republicans and Democrats are working together but I don't think it's clear
[12:24.120 --> 12:28.840]  enough for some of the Obamanoid supporters because they're in the comment
[12:28.840 --> 12:34.440]  pages on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and I want to go over some of
[12:34.440 --> 12:40.760]  these comments later in the hour quote doing debunking and they're saying oh
[12:40.760 --> 12:46.360]  this is just more right-wing conspiracies you know like they did for
[12:46.360 --> 12:51.400]  eight years with Clinton you know Alex is just a racist they're saying the same
[12:51.400 --> 12:55.400]  thing in the YouTube comments it's the minority of people and folks are
[12:55.400 --> 12:59.720]  countering them saying look Alex Jones went after Bush he was right about that
[12:59.720 --> 13:05.320]  agenda and this is transcending the left-right paradigm but I wanted to go
[13:05.320 --> 13:09.280]  over one guy in there and we did check his IP addresses it's the same guy
[13:09.280 --> 13:14.480]  who's posting as multiple people having conversations with himself going yes I
[13:14.480 --> 13:19.560]  support the earlier poster he's right now I'm wise to Alex I was a fan but now
[13:19.560 --> 13:25.600]  I'm not and it's the same guy it's the same person in there being in engaging
[13:25.600 --> 13:31.720]  in deception so that's probably a government disinfo operative and being
[13:31.720 --> 13:36.600]  able to look at these IP addresses is very very helpful to we're just so busy
[13:36.600 --> 13:40.560]  we usually don't have time to track and trace and see what these people are doing
[13:40.560 --> 13:44.640]  half the time they're open military they put their public handle on you link to
[13:44.640 --> 13:47.640]  their handle on MySpace or Facebook and they're in the military they're in
[13:47.640 --> 13:51.400]  psyops and they're so proud of themselves that they admit their engaged in
[13:51.400 --> 13:57.200]  propaganda but this individual and individuals are saying Barack Obama
[13:57.200 --> 14:02.360]  was against the bailout he was against Paulson's bailout Alex is taking this
[14:02.360 --> 14:06.560]  out of context where he's endorsing the bailout which just isn't true but
[14:06.560 --> 14:11.000]  they're counting the public being dumb of course he was for it and oh Alex is
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.440]  lying you know martial law wasn't threatened he's just saying that or
[14:16.440 --> 14:21.800]  Dennis Kasinich wasn't really mad at Kashkari Alex is taking that out of
[14:21.800 --> 14:26.080]  context well you know we watched the entire five-hour hearing I played
[14:26.080 --> 14:34.400]  lengthy clips of it on the show two months ago and I mean both parties are
[14:34.400 --> 14:37.800]  there attacking Kashkari saying where is the money why is it secret
[14:37.800 --> 14:42.200]  representative Cummings from Maryland says I only voted for this because Obama
[14:42.200 --> 14:46.440]  told me to and said it was good but now it's a bait and switch and then this guy
[14:46.440 --> 14:51.800]  is on the on the comment section going Kasinich likes Kashkari he said thank
[14:51.800 --> 14:55.880]  you to him four times yeah he's real sarcastic he goes I just really want to
[14:55.880 --> 14:59.640]  thank you for being here I want you to know we're gonna be investigating you
[14:59.640 --> 15:05.800]  and watching you so thank you so much the guy's like oh look he's he's thankful
[15:05.800 --> 15:10.760]  you know this is out of context in the trailer and so seeing that there's a no
[15:10.760 --> 15:17.800]  way this person is in there really being reasonable really trying to counter and
[15:17.800 --> 15:23.240]  debunk and then sure enough you go check the IP he's then commenting under
[15:23.240 --> 15:28.080]  himself going I agree with the earlier commenter absolutely I used to like Alex
[15:28.080 --> 15:31.880]  but now I've caught him in the lie about Obama and then they go on to say
[15:31.880 --> 15:36.560]  there's no youth brigades that's not going on it's Peace Corps it's soup
[15:36.560 --> 15:44.880]  kitchens so see how that works as I told you in the last few weeks they come out
[15:44.880 --> 15:49.400]  and go we need national soup kitchens we need you to volunteer so now when we
[15:49.400 --> 15:54.920]  say we don't want 18 to 24 18 to 25 drama manual is said as change.gov is
[15:54.920 --> 15:58.960]  said as Obama has said on record on TV no their face is moving their mouse
[15:58.960 --> 16:04.440]  moving their counter will be what you're in soup kitchens just exactly as I said
[16:04.440 --> 16:08.600]  this is elementary psychological warfare we're like no we're not talking
[16:08.600 --> 16:13.880]  about the PR front of this we're talking about the reality of what's been
[16:13.880 --> 16:21.080]  proposed and it's just no there's no proposal for domestic military force
[16:21.080 --> 16:31.040]  that it's not true lies I've got you with no proof so man that only stokes me
[16:31.040 --> 16:37.640]  more because you guys in the government think and these PR firms think that you
[16:37.640 --> 16:42.760]  can fool our listeners and our readers you think you can fool them when all
[16:42.760 --> 16:49.160]  they do is study your tactics you think you can fool me you think you can create
[16:49.160 --> 16:53.520]  some buzz against my film before anybody's even seen it with lies and
[16:53.520 --> 17:01.360]  disinformation and and you and you think it is daunting to us can you imagine
[17:01.360 --> 17:04.800]  going on air two months before 9-11 and saying the White House is going to blow
[17:04.800 --> 17:08.200]  up the World Trade Center call the White House here's their number and tell them
[17:08.200 --> 17:13.800]  don't do it and having affiliate after affiliate turn me off and have Ted
[17:13.800 --> 17:16.440]  Anderson come in and go you know we never told you what to say or do but
[17:16.440 --> 17:20.480]  you've already lost half your affiliates this is by 9-11 do you want to lose the
[17:20.480 --> 17:22.880]  rest I'm just letting you know the stations are calling and I said yeah
[17:22.880 --> 17:28.640]  I'm gonna continue and they said okay we back you and I lost two-thirds or more

[19:33.480 --> 19:39.960]  government trusting the system and if they succeed they win and look it isn't

[24:20.680 --> 24:37.320]  the title is the Obama deception is there's so many lies so many things
[24:37.320 --> 24:43.840]  this puppets doing for the new world order so much globalism but we're
[24:43.840 --> 24:46.520]  mainly going after the banking angle because that's what's going to destroy
[24:46.520 --> 24:51.720]  everybody financially and all of his lies about the war all of his lies about
[24:51.720 --> 24:57.960]  warrantless wiretapping but but mainly it's hey in the end Obama is going to
[24:57.960 --> 25:01.640]  be destroyed by the new world order politically they're going to put the
[25:01.640 --> 25:05.360]  whole agenda on him and in the end when it quote doesn't work because it's not
[25:05.360 --> 25:09.160]  meant to work it's not meant to help the economy when they're done suckering the
[25:09.160 --> 25:11.960]  people it's all going to be blamed on Obama in the end just like the whole
[25:11.960 --> 25:17.120]  agenda for eight years was blamed on George W. Bush we have to stop looking
[25:17.120 --> 25:23.680]  like KRS-1 said at the Burger King manager and start talking about the
[25:23.680 --> 25:29.400]  Burger King franchise owners that's a great analogy very simple when your
[25:29.400 --> 25:33.280]  burgers cold or your fries are cold or aren't cooked right you come up you say
[25:33.280 --> 25:42.320]  I want to see the manager I want a hot burger I want good fries and Bush comes
[25:42.320 --> 25:45.600]  over for eight years you figure out he's not going to give you a good burger so
[25:45.600 --> 25:49.680]  now they say okay there's a new manager why don't we talk about the owners of
[25:49.680 --> 25:52.840]  the franchise that's all I'm saying let's get past Obama that's what the
[25:52.840 --> 25:55.480]  film is going to do it's going to show he's a puppet show he's a minion show
[25:55.480 --> 26:01.280]  he's a liar but say hey so was George Bush right out of the gates in this
[26:01.280 --> 26:05.760]  film and and so we can get past that and just objectively look at the real
[26:05.760 --> 26:10.280]  issues and say are you really for these policies that's like last week during
[26:10.280 --> 26:13.480]  the coronation Luke Radowski's on the ground National Guard trip surrounding
[26:13.480 --> 26:18.200]  and we live video on prisonplanet.tv from the ground and I said okay just walk
[26:18.200 --> 26:23.840]  up to the first person you see give her the phone nice middle-aged over the
[26:23.840 --> 26:28.960]  hill black lady looks she's about 55 60 and her the phone I said ma'am have you
[26:28.960 --> 26:32.720]  heard about the national compulsory service yes I'm against that have you
[26:32.720 --> 26:35.760]  heard about the warrantless wiretap and continue yes I'm against that have you
[26:35.760 --> 26:39.200]  heard about A, B, and C the banker bailout she goes yeah I'm against that
[26:39.200 --> 26:45.520]  so I said so what are you for well I know what she's for who couldn't be for it
[26:45.520 --> 26:48.840]  our first black president that would be a great thing if he is wasn't a new
[26:48.840 --> 26:53.280]  older stooge so it is amazing you know that's the only thing of substance here
[26:53.280 --> 27:01.560]  is that he is half-black and that's something that's so historical and so
[27:01.560 --> 27:04.920]  interesting that people are caught up in that that's the new order bait and
[27:04.920 --> 27:09.520]  switch here is the Obama deception trailer
[27:14.640 --> 27:22.080]  on March 15th a carefully crafted corporate fraud will be exposed and a
[27:22.080 --> 27:26.280]  vicious hoax will be revealed to the people of the world
[27:26.280 --> 27:31.720]  contrary to the rumors that you've heard I was not born in a manger
[27:31.720 --> 27:40.320]  I was actually born on crypto and sent here to save the planet Earth
[27:40.880 --> 27:46.880]  we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the
[27:46.880 --> 27:52.680]  national security objectives that we've set everybody somewhere between the ages of 1825
[27:52.680 --> 27:54.840]  will serve three months of basic training
[27:54.840 --> 27:59.800]  have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful just as strong
[27:59.800 --> 28:12.440]  yes we can Obama is a cruel hoax he works for Wall Street he's an agent of
[28:12.440 --> 28:16.840]  finance capital where did you come up with the number 700 billion dollars
[28:16.840 --> 28:21.200]  here's the treasury spokeswoman's quote it's not based on any particular data
[28:21.200 --> 28:24.960]  point we just really wanted to come up with a really big number to Democrats
[28:24.960 --> 28:31.120]  and Republicans who've opposed this plan I say step up to the plate a few
[28:31.120 --> 28:36.280]  members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted
[28:36.280 --> 28:42.200]  no secretary Henry Paulson is no George Washington I don't think anyone
[28:42.200 --> 28:51.480]  questions mr. kashkari that you're working hard our question is who you're
[28:51.480 --> 28:53.880]  working for
[28:55.080 --> 28:59.600]  Obama pledged that he would resume the security and prosperity partnership
[28:59.600 --> 29:04.280]  talks between Mexico and Canada that president Bush initiate your boss is
[29:04.280 --> 29:07.800]  starting to work a lot like the new boss Robert Gates is gonna remain on the job
[29:07.800 --> 29:12.360]  as defense secretary for at least a year plenty of sources knew about this
[29:12.360 --> 29:16.800]  meeting told us and others that it was at the Hillary Clinton's house but
[29:16.800 --> 29:23.520]  clearly it wasn't we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of the
[29:23.520 --> 29:27.960]  world order that I think all of us would like to see we see you causing
[29:27.960 --> 29:37.960]  depression so you can blow out the economy and consolidate it we know that your enemies of free humanity and we are here standing against your

[34:42.800 --> 34:46.680]  down so we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round we filled his head
[34:46.680 --> 34:50.200]  the cannon balls and powdered his behind and when we touched the powder off the
[34:50.200 --> 34:55.520]  Gator lost his mind where the British kept becoming there wasn't nice many as
[34:55.520 --> 35:00.120]  there was a while ago we fired once more and they began to run it on down to
[35:00.120 --> 35:04.120]  Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[35:04.120 --> 35:10.120]  yeah they ran through the friars and they ran through the brambles and they ran through the bushes where rabbit couldn't go
[35:10.120 --> 35:15.120]  they ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch them all down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[35:15.120 --> 35:19.080]  all you've got to have is the will to stand up against tyranny and realize we
[35:19.080 --> 35:23.760]  can win and that's easy because we don't have a choice we're being given no
[35:23.760 --> 35:30.840]  quarter by the New World Order lift right we are gonna have open phones today
[35:30.840 --> 35:35.040]  you know I could have had some guests on but I wanted today to have wide open
[35:35.040 --> 35:39.440]  phones to talk about the coronation to talk about the fact that Obama's one of
[35:39.440 --> 35:43.880]  his first acts was to kill a bunch of innocent people with predator drones in
[35:43.880 --> 35:49.520]  Pakistan and Afghanistan and to shift 20,000 US Marines talking about 10,000
[35:49.520 --> 35:54.920]  more for a total of 30,000 the entire Marine Corps force and the Marine Corps
[35:54.920 --> 35:58.800]  ahead of saying it is now time for us to leave Iraq yes they're leaving Iraq and
[35:58.800 --> 36:03.000]  going to Afghanistan as new army troops are sending to Iraq to replace them and
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.880]  Obama's saying we're looking now at 16 months in 16 months having a drawdown of
[36:08.880 --> 36:12.440]  the troops so they're looking now remember he was going to take them out
[36:12.440 --> 36:15.720]  within six months I promise when I get elected six months troops are gone now
[36:15.720 --> 36:20.800]  it's well we're gonna look at it in 16 months George Bush since two months
[36:20.800 --> 36:25.160]  after the invasion of Iraq has been saying we'll look at 16 months they've
[36:25.160 --> 36:31.480]  done that three four times here we are almost six years later yes in a month
[36:31.480 --> 36:37.560]  and a half in a month and a half mid-March we'll launch we'll mark the
[36:37.560 --> 36:46.240]  sixth anniversary six years ago six years ago Iraq was invaded in Bush they'll
[36:46.240 --> 36:52.960]  be home in time for Christmas they'll be home in less than a year and what
[36:52.960 --> 36:56.400]  happened well they're still there serving two three four in some cases
[36:56.400 --> 37:02.560]  starting their fifth tours and they'll they'll let them serve a year and then
[37:02.560 --> 37:07.560]  send them home for two three months and I'm right back over and over and over and
[37:07.560 --> 37:11.720]  over and then they spend it to say what you support the troops don't hear all
[37:11.720 --> 37:15.400]  these billboards and TV ads about support the troops support the war you
[37:15.400 --> 37:21.240]  support the troops by not putting them in a fraudulent war and even the Iraqi
[37:21.240 --> 37:29.960]  puppet government once the United States out Maliki saying get out we don't
[37:29.960 --> 37:35.600]  want you leave they're saying oh we'll look in 16 months and then see this is
[37:35.600 --> 37:41.160]  how these mind control paradigms work these basic frauds so that Obama looks
[37:41.160 --> 37:44.400]  like the liberal because that's the same Bush policy to keep saying 16 months
[37:44.400 --> 37:47.400]  then we'll look at it 18 months we'll look at it
[37:47.400 --> 37:50.800]  sometimes Bush would say 18s I'm 16 but Obama sings 16
[37:50.800 --> 37:56.440]  Secretary of Defense Gates comes out and says I don't know who Obama's held over
[37:56.440 --> 38:00.760]  I don't know I don't think we should look at 16 months and put a date on it so
[38:00.760 --> 38:05.160]  see that gives you the false choice if Gates didn't come out and say no I
[38:05.160 --> 38:09.600]  disagree they need to stay longer it would make it look like Obama was the
[38:09.600 --> 38:14.920]  same Bush policy but by Gates coming out and playing the the bad cop and said no
[38:14.920 --> 38:18.360]  no they need to stay longer than 16 months now the liberals will look at
[38:18.360 --> 38:23.680]  Obama and say see Obama standing up he's fighting with Gates see that's the
[38:23.680 --> 38:27.880]  control choice you see how that works now now the debate isn't why aren't they
[38:27.880 --> 38:35.520]  leaving now now the debate is shifted to is it 16 months or no date instead of
[38:35.520 --> 38:40.320]  hey how about we leave right now see how they play that little mind game with
[38:40.320 --> 38:46.960]  you we're gonna be covering that in the Obama deception film we ran out of time
[38:46.960 --> 38:50.120]  there going into the break didn't play the last five seconds of the trailer the
[38:50.120 --> 38:58.760]  tagline is the Obama deception on March 15th the people strike back so that
[38:58.760 --> 39:04.080]  trailer is up on info wars dot com and super high quality from our servers it's
[39:04.080 --> 39:08.000]  an example of medium quality not our high quality a lot of people don't even
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.120]  have connections to get in our highest quality that we have it at present
[39:10.120 --> 39:13.680]  planet TV I mean it's as good as DVD you can't even tell the difference and you
[39:13.680 --> 39:17.480]  can blow it up you can blow up prison planet dot TV high quality videos like
[39:17.480 --> 39:20.200]  end game we put up there in the highest quality and you can't tell it's on a
[39:20.200 --> 39:26.000]  DVD on your big screen TV but a lot of folks don't even have connections that
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.400]  can get that good so we have it in the medium quality example for members it's
[39:30.400 --> 39:34.240]  a members quality video for everybody up on info wars dot com and prison planet
[39:34.240 --> 39:38.840]  dot com right now and then we have the YouTube version and we want you to people
[39:38.840 --> 39:41.920]  say well why are you still on YouTube if they're censoring you and they erased
[39:41.920 --> 39:46.840]  one of our videos at over a million views last week of building seven BBC
[39:46.840 --> 39:52.040]  announcing it had fallen in its own footprint 25 minutes before it did
[39:52.040 --> 39:55.360]  because that's where things go viral that's where there's hundreds of
[39:55.360 --> 39:58.800]  millions of people a day on there that's where we have the biggest effect
[39:58.800 --> 40:02.440]  yes people should post our videos on a lot of the other lesser video services
[40:02.440 --> 40:06.920]  where millions come every day or some cases hundreds of thousands come a day
[40:06.920 --> 40:11.200]  we want to be where the actions that were the battles that were the fights it
[40:11.200 --> 40:14.920]  just because they censor us and black out our videos and erase them and play
[40:14.920 --> 40:18.360]  all sorts of games and reset hit counters and take away our new number one
[40:18.360 --> 40:21.720]  awards and things so we're not on the main pages so what that means we're
[40:21.720 --> 40:26.320]  having an effect there continue attacking that sector continue in the info war
[40:32.640 --> 40:37.400]  so I do hope you help us this is step one and getting the Obama deception we're
[40:37.400 --> 40:40.440]  taking the heat with the tip of the spear we're going in full throttle here we
[40:40.440 --> 40:50.040]  just need your support ladies and gentlemen and these will mail out March

[41:10.280 --> 41:18.440]  out to but it's not up on the info wars dot com shopping cart yet we'll be up
[41:18.440 --> 41:24.400]  there in the next few days okay I want to take phone calls and then we'll get
[41:24.400 --> 41:26.920]  into all the latest economic developments all the latest military
[41:26.920 --> 41:30.720]  developments and there are a lot of them but let's just start going to your
[41:30.720 --> 41:35.400]  calls now Aaron in Ohio oh actually Joe and Florida was first I missed that Joe
[41:35.400 --> 41:41.120]  and Florida then Aaron Joe you're on the air Alex how you doing good sir I'm just
[41:41.120 --> 41:43.480]  going to tell you I just started listening to you and I would like to
[41:43.480 --> 41:47.520]  commend you you do an excellent job of giving us the information I wanted to
[41:47.520 --> 41:51.400]  get into briefly just real fast is um I'm an education major I'm gonna be a
[41:51.400 --> 41:55.400]  teacher and I would just like to get your comment or your thought about this
[41:55.400 --> 42:00.840]  education should be the ability to freely come about and become aware but in
[42:00.840 --> 42:04.120]  the classroom one of the things I struggle with so hard is that they teach
[42:04.120 --> 42:08.440]  us that you have to be an authoritarian you have to be authoritative you cannot
[42:08.440 --> 42:11.520]  allow the student to have freedom in the classroom and you have to limit them
[42:11.520 --> 42:14.960]  with rules and it's a process that goes on throughout the whole education and
[42:14.960 --> 42:19.280]  then that makes them and then that makes them instead of being you know a
[42:19.280 --> 42:25.520]  someone who respects the teacher and who wants to please them and learn the
[42:25.520 --> 42:31.160]  joys of learning instead they begin rebelling and that's that that's in
[42:31.160 --> 42:34.720]  actually all the mind control pamphlets that the Department of Education puts
[42:34.720 --> 42:37.760]  out to the higher level folks they don't tell the teachers the teachers think man
[42:37.760 --> 42:40.520]  this stuff doesn't work these are a bunch of idiots in the Department of
[42:40.520 --> 42:44.600]  Education other not their psych warfare experts and they want and they want and
[42:44.600 --> 42:48.920]  they want look look they knew that when they introduced suicide education in
[42:48.920 --> 42:53.480]  1990 there's even been 20-20 specials on this that it would increase suicide you
[42:53.480 --> 42:56.880]  know 13 year old girls didn't think about suicide before suicide was
[42:56.880 --> 43:01.400]  incredibly rare in people you know under the age of 15 or so now suddenly
[43:01.400 --> 43:05.280]  there's suicides everywhere with the introduction of suicide education because
[43:05.280 --> 43:09.160]  they even teach you how to commit suicide how to put a bag over your head
[43:09.160 --> 43:13.720]  with free on how to hang yourself and then days after they have suicide
[43:13.720 --> 43:16.840]  education little girls go in the school bathrooms all over the country and they
[43:16.840 --> 43:20.320]  hang themselves or they or or they teach them don't go to the medicine
[43:20.320 --> 43:23.600]  cabinet and take two bottles of Tylenol you know when your boyfriend breaks up
[43:23.600 --> 43:27.160]  with you don't commit suicide you know go talk to the school counselor then they
[43:27.160 --> 43:30.640]  put them on Prozac which on the insert admittedly causes you to commit
[43:30.640 --> 43:34.760]  suicide then they go take it and then commit suicide this is all done by
[43:34.760 --> 43:39.080]  design by the way it's a culture of death we've heard Ted Turner and Prince
[43:39.080 --> 43:43.000]  Philip and all these world leaders come out and say there's too many people we've
[43:43.000 --> 43:47.960]  we've heard Al Gore say it now Pelosi saying that they want to massively
[43:47.960 --> 43:53.000]  increase Planned Parenthood abortion in the US saying babies are bad for our
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.880]  economy so see this is a culture of death like in-game says they want you dead
[43:57.880 --> 44:03.440]  okay they want you dead but go ahead sir I'm sorry I know you're going on and I
[44:03.440 --> 44:07.120]  was good point for me and the thing is I wanted to also say is that it's almost
[44:07.120 --> 44:10.920]  become like a chore to become educated like most people almost and that's what
[44:10.920 --> 44:14.520]  I want to get at you make very good claims about mind control and eugenics
[44:14.520 --> 44:19.160]  it's almost like like people are almost disinterested in becoming educated and
[44:19.160 --> 44:21.640]  learning and learning is one of the greatest things you can do that's why I
[44:21.640 --> 44:24.880]  mean life is so great you learn about things and people become all I'd rather
[44:24.880 --> 44:29.280]  play video games or you know the Greeks said you had to when they were very
[44:29.280 --> 44:33.880]  young teach them the joys of knowledge and discovery and so first you introduced
[44:33.880 --> 44:38.840]  them to you know really amazing concepts into the stars and you created a love
[44:38.840 --> 44:43.640]  affair with with knowledge and then you made sure they understood the basics and
[44:43.640 --> 44:48.520]  learn to read once that happened then the mind opened up to knowledge and then
[44:48.520 --> 44:53.320]  it's just it's just exponential but no the by design they make it to where it's
[44:53.320 --> 44:57.320]  by rote they make it to where it's boring they make it to where it's
[44:57.320 --> 45:01.560]  frustrating and with the whole eugenics thing I just want because I know you're
[45:01.560 --> 45:04.040]  busy and I'm sure you got so many calls and I just want to I just want to thank
[45:04.040 --> 45:06.760]  you for taking your time and just talking to me I think you're real good
[45:06.760 --> 45:10.080]  cool dude and I'm glad that we got somebody up there on the front line but
[45:10.080 --> 45:13.760]  with people like when people want to go there's no such thing as eugenics or
[45:13.760 --> 45:17.600]  like uh like control of the population what he and I hate to say it I'm not
[45:17.600 --> 45:20.480]  looking down on anybody for smoking cigarettes or alcohol or anything like
[45:20.480 --> 45:23.600]  that and moderation everything is awesome but look at the numbers we have
[45:23.600 --> 45:27.680]  for people dying from cigarettes or alcohol or just so many things that
[45:27.680 --> 45:30.880]  like what is the purpose of cigarettes again I understand that it's a good
[45:30.880 --> 45:35.000]  stress reliever and I understand that but no obviously it's bad but humans have
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.840]  always taken drugs and done done things to access its bad form just the
[45:38.840 --> 45:44.160]  globalist accentuate all that and push a culture of decadence and weakness where
[45:44.160 --> 45:48.120]  people don't don't stand up and say no good to hear from you Joe Aaron in Ohio
[45:48.120 --> 45:55.840]  you're on the air go ahead yes if there was a psychological attack on the
[45:55.840 --> 46:01.080]  people how do you detect something like that and then fight against it well I
[46:01.080 --> 46:06.440]  mean there's multifaceted systems of propaganda and psychological attack but
[46:06.440 --> 46:09.880]  I mean cynically having the bankers create the implosion of the economy by
[46:09.880 --> 46:14.440]  design then loot us for tens of trillions globally 8.5 at least here in the
[46:14.440 --> 46:17.960]  United States and then not tell the public where the money's going and
[46:17.960 --> 46:22.920]  there's no discussion of investigations of all these bankers who stole all this
[46:22.920 --> 46:26.760]  money or all these derivatives or all these Ponzi schemes the whole Wall Street
[46:26.760 --> 46:30.880]  thing is made off you know made off was the head of the Nasdaq the founder of it
[46:30.880 --> 46:35.280]  so so I mean just just look at that psych warfare the very people that
[46:35.280 --> 46:38.800]  engineered this collapse by design the very ones looting everything in a
[46:38.800 --> 46:43.320]  dictatorship a coup by Wall Street are the ones posing as saviors telling us
[46:43.320 --> 46:47.360]  that we have collective responsibility for this and as if the American people
[46:47.360 --> 46:51.320]  engineered this and that we're all going to roll up our sleeves and basically be
[46:51.320 --> 46:56.360]  slaves I mean it's sick I mean that's psychological warfare right there or
[46:56.360 --> 47:01.360]  lying about WMD's and then going and attacking two nations and killing over a
[47:01.360 --> 47:05.520]  million 300,000 people conservatively just in the last five and three-quarter
[47:05.520 --> 47:11.240]  years almost almost six years in March and then just kind of now that Bush has
[47:11.240 --> 47:15.120]  gone forgetting about that now the war is depoliticized and then Obama goes
[47:15.120 --> 47:18.440]  back on his promise and says well we'll look at the troops taking them out in
[47:18.440 --> 47:23.080]  16 months I mean it's it's I mean there's psych warfare right there and then
[47:23.080 --> 47:26.440]  saying you're not a good guy you're not a patriot you hate the troops if you
[47:26.440 --> 47:29.440]  don't want them to be in all these countries if you don't want the troops
[47:29.440 --> 47:33.040]  to attack Serbia and bomb them with DU and blow up all their infrastructure and
[47:33.040 --> 47:36.400]  lie about them in the media and say that they attacked the Muslims you know
[47:36.400 --> 47:40.440]  you're bad or you know if you're not for overthrowing Iran and putting a public
[47:40.440 --> 47:44.240]  dictatorship in you're you know you're bad or if you're not for the White
[47:44.240 --> 47:49.280]  House putting out a PDD ordering a known Wahhabist which is real al-Qaeda to
[47:49.280 --> 47:53.920]  attack Iran for five years and then go on the news and say Iran is al-Qaeda while
[47:53.920 --> 47:57.760]  criminals in the US government are funding real al-Qaeda to attack Iran I
[47:57.760 --> 48:04.880]  mean it's all just an outrageous fraud the I got a DVD in the mail called
[48:04.880 --> 48:09.800]  obsession and I wondered if you've ever heard anything about propaganda to
[48:09.800 --> 48:14.120]  demonize the Muslims and the very Muslim groups they show are the radical
[48:14.120 --> 48:18.280]  Muslim groups in the 50s that the Pentagon radicalized and paid for their
[48:18.280 --> 48:23.360]  madrasa books to teach them to hate the West to teach them to hate secular
[48:23.360 --> 48:27.440]  government so they would overthrow mainline governments that would have
[48:27.440 --> 48:32.160]  made the Middle East and Central Asia first world so yes that's the globalist
[48:32.160 --> 48:36.080]  pointing at the end and those radical Muslims were always there the West
[48:36.080 --> 48:41.200]  went and funded them and use them to overthrow mainline secular governments
[48:41.200 --> 48:46.520]  in the name of fighting communism which it wasn't so that so that they would and
[48:46.520 --> 48:50.400]  then now they use those same radical Muslims to attack Serbia then the US
[48:50.400 --> 48:54.320]  comes into their aid or or to attack the United States as a pretext to invade
[48:54.320 --> 48:58.520]  other countries the radical Muslims work for the globalist
[49:00.520 --> 49:04.280]  you understand that works a lot you understand that you understand that I
[49:04.280 --> 49:09.680]  just don't understand how someone's supposed to fight against something like
[49:09.680 --> 49:16.040]  that because they have all the doctors and you know all the technology and and
[49:16.040 --> 49:19.360]  they only give us a little bit like they give us cell phones that are tracking
[49:19.360 --> 49:24.080]  trace your move and I don't know how much but yeah they only go out a little
[49:24.080 --> 49:27.720]  bit and then all of it is to a press and control where the technologies could
[49:27.720 --> 49:32.280]  just be neutral they're designed for dehumanization here's the deal if you're
[49:32.280 --> 49:36.400]  aware of their program and you're aware of the technocracy it doesn't matter if
[49:36.400 --> 49:41.000]  the elite are 30 40 years advanced of us under the national security cloak in
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.560]  advanced technological grid above our technological system and that's what it
[49:45.560 --> 49:49.000]  is we're in the matrix and we're being inserted into physical matrix right now
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.040]  but there's already a true matrix grid if we are aware of that and then and then
[49:53.040 --> 49:56.440]  of course it's ridiculous that obama is going to change anything or bush is
[49:56.440 --> 50:00.720]  going to change anything we can go past the left right dummy fight they get us
[50:00.720 --> 50:06.320]  in and then see the global managers and then it won't matter how high-tech their
[50:06.320 --> 50:11.320]  technology is because they still need us to be fooled to the trick so that we go
[50:11.320 --> 50:15.880]  along with it being aware of it is the key
[50:15.880 --> 50:22.640]  okay well thank you very much I appreciate that you taken my call I

[56:07.080 --> 56:11.080]  anything like that like end game and tear storm war you know I did that with
[56:11.080 --> 56:17.280]  those two films and it was somewhat successful frankly I had just been so
[56:17.280 --> 56:22.680]  busy that we didn't do those deals with the last two films okay that's great to
[56:22.680 --> 56:30.520]  hear I'm getting back to Obama isn't it funny a lot of these anti-war lefties
[56:30.520 --> 56:34.760]  you know thought he was gonna end the war in Iraq and scale back things and
[56:34.760 --> 56:41.040]  wow he goes ahead and starts bombing Pakistan that's right and during all
[56:41.040 --> 56:45.840]  the euphoria they're kind of going well he's got to do it you know it's keeping
[56:45.840 --> 56:51.120]  us safe from al-Qaeda so a total bait and switch they they politicized it they
[56:51.120 --> 56:55.080]  made the war all about George Bush and then now that he's gone it's like I
[56:55.080 --> 57:00.680]  forget about the war that's a that's a forgotten thing we need to continue that
[57:00.680 --> 57:06.920]  yes siri all right here go ahead I was just gonna say what do you think the
[57:06.920 --> 57:13.600]  probability that he's gonna instigate war with Russia well I appreciate your
[57:13.600 --> 57:16.960]  call you can see the last six months of the Bush administration it was already
[57:16.960 --> 57:22.240]  kind of the Clinton East is in the old Bush senior guard so bush 41 Clinton
[57:22.240 --> 57:28.240]  42 president 42 is people in there and the in the new policy already started
[57:28.240 --> 57:31.680]  with the encirclement of Russia then and that had been going on unceasingly ever
[57:31.680 --> 57:35.720]  since the Cold War never really never really stopped there so absolutely
[57:35.720 --> 57:39.000]  they're probably gonna stage more terror attacks internationally even here
[57:39.000 --> 57:44.680]  domestically you know that could come at any time they're just continuing all
[57:44.680 --> 57:48.360]  the same rhetoric and we've got to fight al-Qaeda we've got a anybody hits us
[57:48.360 --> 57:52.480]  here in America we're gonna go after you it's just gonna be more of the same and
[57:52.480 --> 57:58.560]  Obama saying look we got hit we got to do all this because Obama is a puppet
[57:58.560 --> 58:04.440]  it's all a distraction the exact same agenda is going to continue just with a
[58:04.440 --> 58:11.120]  little bit softer rhetoric now and we're already we're already seeing them
[58:11.120 --> 58:14.520]  shift the propaganda right back to the basic things that Bush was saying we're
[58:14.520 --> 58:18.840]  gonna break and come back in 70 seconds and go to a Thomas in Illinois Gary

[1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:12.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.800 --> 1:00:27.520]  Alex Jones we are now into our number two of this live 26 day of January 2009
[1:00:27.520 --> 1:00:32.040]  edition wide open phones today I'm doing a pretty good job to get into your calls
[1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:35.640]  but I want to accelerate through them now you know at all different issues and
[1:00:35.640 --> 1:00:39.120]  later you know Iceland's the first government to fall from the bank or
[1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:42.720]  scam the problem is their real government's been taken over by offshore
[1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:47.280]  banks that's what has to be removed so we'll give some advice to the Icelanders
[1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:50.640]  who've gone from one of the richest nations in the world in literally two
[1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:54.360]  months to one of the poorest we will one of the poorest industrialized
[1:00:54.360 --> 1:00:59.200]  nations will also break down to the Pakistan strike by Lord Obama and the
[1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:02.640]  latest economic developments but right now let's go back to the calls Gary in
[1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:05.560]  Illinois you're on the air
[1:01:06.080 --> 1:01:12.800]  hi Alex three quick things I'll be brief Spanish subtitles I got a couple of
[1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:18.200]  discs that have Spanish subtitles and it's probably I get better reception
[1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:23.600]  when I hand those out than from other groups of people that they're very
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:28.160]  popular it'd be good if here's the deal to the cheapest places to do subtitles
[1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:33.040]  for a film you know it's 90 minutes long is like $5,000 I don't have that money
[1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:37.680]  and I don't and I can't wait the month or two to have the subtitles done to
[1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:42.080]  release the film it's key to get it out early but there are free copies of most
[1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:48.440]  my films in game road to tyranny terror storm on Google and places in
[1:01:48.440 --> 1:01:53.640]  Deutsch in Chinese in French in Spanish and so those are all there but so yes I
[1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:59.520]  want people on the web to do subtitle versions for folks this is a kick in for
[1:01:59.520 --> 1:02:03.280]  that yeah yeah I miss the team effort man yeah I mean I'm literally you could
[1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:06.600]  tell I'm in my main work mode right now because I have giant black circles around
[1:02:06.600 --> 1:02:09.560]  my eyes they're gonna get a lot worse than next month and a half finishing this
[1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:13.240]  film and getting it out so I'm not whining I'm just saying yes I know I
[1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:17.200]  could do a better job I know I could do more but you know I've got to have the
[1:02:17.200 --> 1:02:20.880]  capital to do that and I'm and then everything's going to hell in a hand
[1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:24.280]  basket so we're kind of a catch-22 we've got to grow to fight the globalist at
[1:02:24.280 --> 1:02:28.840]  the same time you know it's hard to get funds in that that's time for people
[1:02:28.840 --> 1:02:34.480]  volunteering kick in the other thing is in a way of active activism video rental
[1:02:34.480 --> 1:02:39.600]  stores they got the return slots those people are bored and they get something
[1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:42.800]  strange coming through their hands they'll be looking at it so I started
[1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:47.200]  hitting on those and the other thing is I'd like to know if oh yeah beauty
[1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:52.440]  parlors are good too because they like talking there another thing is a Warren
[1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:57.680]  Buffett Obama connection do you touch upon that in your new film yes I mean
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:05.040]  we've got list we've typed out probably 40 pages of stuff but I just wrote a
[1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:09.880]  note there to remember that Buffett and how Warren Buffett this global globalist
[1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:18.000]  is a tied into him yeah with Obama shortly after he made Illinois senator
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:22.600]  and he's like a kingmaker because he also met with Schwarzenegger as recall
[1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:27.040]  so I think that's kind of key there and then the Schwarzenegger met with the
[1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:34.120]  Rothschilds as well right yeah big time on that so keep up the good work and I'll
[1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:37.560]  be looking for those Spanish subtitles out there thanks sounds like you're taking
[1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:42.360]  action we love you okay who's up next year
[1:03:43.920 --> 1:03:49.600]  Thomas in Illinois you're on the air hey Alex how's it going man good good
[1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:53.600]  it's a pleasure to talk to you up probably I've been awoken or awakened
[1:03:53.600 --> 1:03:57.640]  about when you put the fourth hour on your show and ever since then it's part
[1:03:57.640 --> 1:04:01.880]  of my daily regiment I want to tell you I went to the inauguration I kind of
[1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:05.640]  supported Obama throughout the campaign but the Obama I supported and what we
[1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:09.640]  got now it's like he's been run through a scrubber a new a new world order car
[1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:14.200]  wash and it's not even when I was important that's one to say that I
[1:04:14.200 --> 1:04:19.120]  know what when we get March to the camp I know what's gonna look like Bush
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:23.960]  declared DC emergency state of emergency when we got there we got her to
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:28.360]  like cattle we got pushed around people talking down to us all the officials
[1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:32.160]  this is what it's gonna look like people wake up Alex do the great job I'll
[1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:37.720]  talk to you all right God bless you my friend yeah we have to approach Obama
[1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:41.040]  not from a left-right perspective I'm gonna talk about it when you get back
[1:04:41.040 --> 1:04:46.000]  and go to calls if we attack him from a right-wing perspective it's gonna

[1:08:07.320 --> 1:08:24.520]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:33.000]  you know I talk about left right paradigm but what does that mean you know in
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:38.640]  our country's history there have generally been two major parties or a new
[1:08:38.640 --> 1:08:43.000]  party will come in and replace one of the two or will grow into a new party
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:46.800]  and occasionally you have third parties like the bull moose party or you have
[1:08:46.800 --> 1:08:55.080]  something like Ross Perot did or Teddy Roosevelt and the elite wants the people
[1:08:55.080 --> 1:08:58.520]  to think that they've got a choice within the two parties and in the past
[1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:00.920]  there have been major differences throughout history but there have been
[1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:05.880]  times before 1913 where the elite not control of both parties and bad things
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:11.320]  always happen the robber barons and what they did in the 1870s and 1880s and
[1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:16.840]  90s and into 1900 when they control both parties they would send Pickerton
[1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:19.880]  security and other quote strike busters out they would just go to people's
[1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:24.080]  farms ranches mining camps that people owned and they would just kill
[1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:27.840]  everybody they were just machine gun everyone I mean just like wounded knee
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:32.160]  they'd kill men women and children and then people would rebel and riot and
[1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:35.880]  there'd be political action and there were a lot of independent newspapers to
[1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:38.600]  get the news out and then they would have political change so we're always
[1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:44.920]  struggling with elites but with Obama just one facet of the left-right
[1:09:44.920 --> 1:09:51.320]  paradigm limbaugh comes out and attacks Obama limbaugh comes out and attacks
[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:56.360]  Obama on predominantly issues that are aren't very significant or aren't
[1:09:56.360 --> 1:10:02.480]  substantive or he puts out arguments that are flawed or fall to your faults and
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:05.800]  some arguments that are legitimate but he mixes them all together and so you've
[1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:09.720]  got tens of millions of Americans that hate rush limbaugh that identify
[1:10:09.720 --> 1:10:13.560]  themselves as leftist or people who are moderates who just don't like him they
[1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:19.480]  know his history they know he puts out a lot of disinformation and so if rush
[1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:26.080]  limbaugh is attacking Obama he must be good and it's the same thing with other
[1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:29.760]  talk show hosts and other parties to where when somebody legitimately comes
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:33.840]  out and says hey you're against the war you claim but you're continuing it you
[1:10:33.840 --> 1:10:40.320]  went back on your promise oh shut up right wing racist well no limbaugh isn't
[1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:47.120]  attacking Obama for keeping the troops in Iraq he's attacking him on other
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:53.120]  issues that don't really matter and then some legitimate issues like the fact
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:55.840]  that we're already bankrupt how can there be more spending how can they
[1:10:55.840 --> 1:11:04.240]  increase the size of government so see the left out there won't support Obama
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:08.800]  if he was just sitting there continuing the war continuing the police state
[1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:14.440]  continuing all the corporate looting and he's gone back on his word with
[1:11:14.440 --> 1:11:20.720]  appointing lobbyists to the Pentagon positions and other key areas but see if
[1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:27.040]  the Democrats that are the grassroots see him being attacked by the
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:32.760]  establishment right wing isn't right wing at all they're just the other power
[1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:38.160]  group that's bidding for control the CEO job the manager job for this regional
[1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:41.120]  governorship known as the United States is already part of the North American
[1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:46.760]  Union and so it's a diversion and distraction to focus on Obama as if
[1:11:46.760 --> 1:11:49.880]  he's a leader as if he's running something because then they can just put
[1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:55.640]  the whole agenda on him later the public will end up blaming him this dream
[1:11:55.640 --> 1:11:58.360]  will turn into a nightmare and then they'll just put in a new puppet will
[1:11:58.360 --> 1:12:00.680]  be a Republican and then they'll take a few years to wake up with the fact that
[1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:04.520]  he's a scammer and they put a Democrat again so that's one issue but the other
[1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:10.920]  issue is by all these right wing attacks that then makes the left circle the
[1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:14.680]  wagons and support Obama no matter what he does and then they're not going to
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:17.640]  wake up and get angry about all his betrayals because they'll see an
[1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:22.120]  outside threat they've invested psychologically mentally financially in
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:26.360]  Obama they want things to get better they're most of them are well-meaning
[1:12:26.360 --> 1:12:31.000]  people even if they're misguided and so they will see anybody who criticizes
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:35.480]  Obama as people trying to hold up Obama fixing things and Obama will say see
[1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:38.960]  they've held me up that's what he said last Friday that he wanted to leak out
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:42.000]  to the press in a meeting with Republicans and Democrats from Congress he
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.760]  said look we're not gonna get anything done and fix this economy if people like
[1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:49.920]  Rush Limbaugh set the tone we've got to come together so people hear that they
[1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:53.600]  go yeah we got to come together oh my gosh right the right wing and Rush Limbaugh
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:57.280]  they're keeping Obama from saving us when Obama was never intending to save you
[1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:00.000]  and couldn't save you because he's a puppet and he's carrying out the exact
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:12.880]  same new order to agenda so we have to reach out to the left from the position
[1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:20.680]  of hey nothing's changing decade after decade President after President except
[1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:23.840]  some of the rhetoric under this left right system the special interest have
[1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:28.800]  bought them all off please look above the heads of these puppets don't be
[1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:34.360]  fooled don't be suckered and you can even approach the liberals and say look do
[1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:37.840]  you want to end the war do you not want to encircle Russia do you not want to
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:41.520]  start a new Cold War do you not want to have a bigger than a trillion dollar
[1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:45.200]  defense budget Obama says that's not big enough I mean it's gone from 400
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:50.480]  million when Bush got into 600 billion to 700 billion and now a trillion plus I
[1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:56.560]  mean on you know the main budget the fiscal 2009 is a trillion and then
[1:13:56.560 --> 1:14:00.040]  there's hundreds of billions of supplementals and and so instead of
[1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:05.240]  arguing Republican Democrat Rush Limbaugh Al Franken let's just stop here
[1:14:05.240 --> 1:14:11.000]  and say what are the policies do we like what Obama is doing in reality
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:15.960]  versus his rhetoric and and let's just get past Rush Limbaugh and get past
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:19.880]  Ariana Huffington and get past all these establishment pundits that keep us
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:22.920]  locked in the left-right paradigm and let's look at what's really happening
[1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:28.160]  and then approach it from a grassroots perspective of let's pressure Congress
[1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:32.760]  Republican and Democrat together instead of fighting with each other and I'm
[1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:36.440]  neither I'm a populist I'm a constitutionalist but but but let's
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:40.160]  say let's come together and agree on what we agree on I mean you've got almost
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:44.600]  80 percent in every major poll I see against the Iraq war you've got 90 plus
[1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:48.200]  percent of the Iraqis wanting the US out including the puppet they put in is
[1:14:48.200 --> 1:14:53.560]  saying get out of here the Pakistan operation is unpopular Afghanistan is
[1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:57.080]  even more unpopular the troops don't need to be there they need to leave but
[1:14:57.080 --> 1:15:01.240]  it's a huge black hole for the globalist to pump money into their no bid
[1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:07.240]  contracts and to get the opium that's up 800 percent since the takeover in 2002
[1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:13.960]  2000 in late 2001 2002 the invasion more troops dying there every day every week
[1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:19.120]  then are dying in Iraq currently and Obama is actually sending more troops
[1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:23.800]  to Iraq with a bait and switch while he moves the old troops into Afghanistan
[1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:28.800]  okay instead of talking about left right are you for that Democrats is that what
[1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:33.520]  you were for I mean when when I said in 2005 I said go ahead and vote for the
[1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:37.360]  Democrats we have to repudiate the Republicans but you're just gonna see
[1:15:37.360 --> 1:15:41.600]  the war in Iraq continue guaranteed people like no Alex you watch when
[1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:45.280]  Democrats get in they're gonna do something about this they're gonna
[1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:48.920]  turn this around you know you're just you're just a right-wing hater and I
[1:15:48.920 --> 1:15:53.840]  said no we have to repudiate the Republicans go ahead and vote for the
[1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:58.360]  Democrats but I'm saying when they betray you vote them out with a third
[1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:03.520]  party or or or Republican who says they're anti-war a libertarian a green
[1:16:03.520 --> 1:16:09.360]  party I mean let's be adults about the policies let's let's live in reality
[1:16:09.360 --> 1:16:14.520]  let's live in the real world instead of being led around by our nose and in four
[1:16:14.520 --> 1:16:20.600]  day years when they put a new Republican in I'll be here day one Lord willing I'm
[1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:24.200]  still alive and still on the air and not set up and put in prison or something
[1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:28.760]  I'll be here going now come on I cut my teeth going after Clinton because he was
[1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:32.320]  a new World Order frontman I went after George W. Bush for eight years I went
[1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:37.200]  after Obama for four years or eight years and and I'm telling you this is a
[1:16:37.200 --> 1:16:40.680]  puppet I mean I don't want to be here in the same spot and you know going back
[1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:43.240]  eight years ago going back ten years ago twelve years ago thirteen years ago
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:48.760]  most people were still in the left-right paradigm and this is the key
[1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:55.200]  depending on the off your election the presidential election the Republicans
[1:16:55.200 --> 1:17:01.560]  when they were in favor as the out party you know replacing the Democrats they
[1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:04.360]  would have a 55 percent approval rating on average the Democrats would have a
[1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:09.600]  45 and then people will wake up to the Republicans being a fraud so they'd
[1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:15.440]  put in the Democrats and it would flip 54% for the Republicans or for the
[1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:20.400]  Democrats and then 47% for the Republicans so so so people were still
[1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:26.440]  being fooled by the bait and switch after 2006 especially when Democrats saw
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:30.320]  big majorities in the House and Senate but the wars all continued and
[1:17:30.320 --> 1:17:37.080]  expanded Congress's approval rating fell to 9% is still there today Republican
[1:17:37.080 --> 1:17:41.400]  Democratic leaders all had very low approval ratings and still do because
[1:17:41.400 --> 1:17:44.280]  the public finally started getting it going wait a minute these people are all
[1:17:44.280 --> 1:17:47.600]  bought and paid for by the same people and I know you the audience really know
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:51.640]  this understand it you you've got to get the message out to the people because
[1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:55.920]  we don't want to be here in four to eight years doing the same thing in two
[1:17:55.920 --> 1:18:03.560]  years in Congress we want to see a huge anti-establishment anti-new-world order
[1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:08.240]  move into Congress that is saying okay enough is enough get all the troops out
[1:18:08.240 --> 1:18:13.160]  of Iraq and Afghanistan stop encircling Russia stop all the corporate looting
[1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:16.520]  abolish the Federal Reserve because by them will be in a total depression and
[1:18:16.520 --> 1:18:19.440]  the public will know who engineered it and who did it to him if we tell them
[1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:24.560]  the truth if we put the information out and counter the establishment so the
[1:18:24.560 --> 1:18:28.520]  public is desperate going into a depression they're hoping Obama who
[1:18:28.520 --> 1:18:31.600]  claimed he'd in the war and in the wiretapping and end all this keeps his
[1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:35.320]  promises and so they're giving him a shot but Obama says himself he's got a
[1:18:35.320 --> 1:18:39.240]  couple hundred days to ram his agenda through because then everybody's gonna
[1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:45.000]  wake up to him and he's going to stall and that's what Bush did remember Bush
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:48.740]  a couple hundred days into his presidency 200 and something they stage
[1:18:48.740 --> 1:18:54.880]  9-11 he comes in with a 55% approval rating it drops to 38% boom 9-11 it
[1:18:54.880 --> 1:18:59.520]  shoots up to 92 93% depending on the poll but he only had a few years and
[1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:02.360]  what do you do when he had that approval rating set up a bigger police state
[1:19:02.360 --> 1:19:06.920]  launch wars so I do believe you're gonna see stage terror attacks
[1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:10.680]  internationally and probably domestically and you're gonna see

[1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:36.400]  hey Alex thanks for taking my call and thanks for feeling the front lines for
[1:24:36.400 --> 1:24:41.240]  all these people calling in I know it's probably hard to sort through and switch
[1:24:41.240 --> 1:24:50.760]  subjects all the time as you do are you there yes sir okay my I guess my question
[1:24:50.760 --> 1:24:56.160]  first of all I think you're right about Obama and I've seen it come in as
[1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:00.480]  well and I've kind of been hit the things for for quite some time and it
[1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:06.160]  seems like things are just I I try to explain it as dominoes being set up as
[1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:12.600]  soon as you see the lineage you can see how it it's all connected and exactly
[1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:16.200]  interesting the more you study at the clear of the picture gets and then you
[1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:19.160]  read a globalist think tank document planning and all you go my god that's
[1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:24.160]  exactly how I saw it I mean they've they've set it up right yeah it's like
[1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:30.680]  marketing stances you know you you see different marketing ploys just for you
[1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:34.880]  know larger corporations and so then you can see exactly what they were thinking
[1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:41.320]  it's not not too complicated to see where you know the propaganda later exactly
[1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:45.480]  and they build program on top of program managers over each sector that's how
[1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:48.880]  people go it's too complex how do they run it well these are institutions that's
[1:25:48.880 --> 1:25:56.560]  what they do they run and control complex systems mm-hmm and I believe that
[1:25:56.560 --> 1:26:02.640]  you're I hope this could be wrong but I do believe that Obama's probably treading
[1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:09.240]  water until some sort of false flag attack and further in the agenda under a
[1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:16.760]  new guys of you know getting people actually involved in wanting to to
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:22.520]  participate in in ways that bush couldn't get people to do oh yeah they're
[1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:26.000]  going to have to stage stuff to keep the agenda going because when the public
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:29.600]  finds out that he's continuing the banking takeover that he was behind it
[1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:32.640]  you know as one of the big people pushing it when they find out this is a
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:35.840]  total betrayal I mean they really think he's gonna suddenly just snap his
[1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:39.720]  fingers and make the economy better when even if he was a good guy he couldn't do
[1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:43.560]  that because the offshore banks are in total control of this nation and are
[1:26:43.560 --> 1:26:48.600]  carrying this out by design right but I thought it was really interesting that
[1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:54.680]  he gained so much funding early on and set precedents for the amount of money
[1:26:54.680 --> 1:26:59.240]  that people gave and it was all Wall Street yeah I mean it was it was the
[1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:02.480]  big ones and they don't put all their eggs in one basket unless it's a sure
[1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:08.160]  thing it happened so fast so early on it was amazing
[1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:12.480]  well one thing that I really wanted to get to you I haven't heard you talk much
[1:27:12.480 --> 1:27:20.160]  about this and I catch a show when I can but I've never heard one thing that I
[1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:30.000]  have a problem with is exactly where the end of the end game is I can't I can
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:35.520]  make sense of a lot of things and I see it going on but I can't at the end of the
[1:27:35.520 --> 1:27:41.440]  day I'm not happy with just that some people want power and I wonder if
[1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:46.280]  there's more well these are you Genesis they believe it's a good thing to kill
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:49.640]  off most of humanity and the engineers they they're control freaks they're
[1:27:49.640 --> 1:27:52.640]  they're playing God they've stated why they're doing this gonna set up a world
[1:27:52.640 --> 1:27:57.600]  government have forced one-child policies huge taxes on you if you have
[1:27:57.600 --> 1:28:00.520]  more than one then we'll just become illegal just like China did the US paid
[1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:04.000]  him to do that the UN paid him to do it George Bush was the ambassador had him
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:09.640]  signed the deal in the mid-70s and they're just gonna then have controlled
[1:28:09.640 --> 1:28:14.600]  bioweapon releases and other things and after each event they'll hurt us into
[1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:19.360]  more compact cities they'll poses the saviors each time they attack us and now
[1:28:19.360 --> 1:28:22.800]  DARPA's announced they are putting up mine control towers it's mainstream news
[1:28:22.800 --> 1:28:27.360]  that will put out ultra low frequency to quote soothe the public as we can't have
[1:28:27.360 --> 1:28:32.200]  riots I mean it everything is so crazy that's happening and they'll just keep
[1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:35.680]  Kim trailing us and keep putting more and more of the children on Prozac and
[1:28:35.680 --> 1:28:38.760]  Ritalin now over a hundred million prescriptions for Prozac alone every year
[1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:46.040]  in the US just a THX 1138 overlay with a 1984 society as the priest of power as
[1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:52.040]  O'Brien says in 1984 a wage war against humanity well let me cut to the chase on
[1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:56.760]  on this main talking point because it's kind of a it's kind of a gear shift I
[1:28:56.760 --> 1:29:02.400]  was wondering what your take is on you know propaganda is a river that runs
[1:29:02.400 --> 1:29:09.960]  extremely deep as you know and I have my suspicions about the omissions from the
[1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:16.400]  Bible as being you know an early text to rein this in some of the secrets some of
[1:29:16.400 --> 1:29:20.880]  the cover-ups that have gone on and not to mention the New Testament on top of
[1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:28.440]  you know it's just a new way of putting things out I wonder what you know about
[1:29:28.440 --> 1:29:33.880]  the Samaritan text or what you think if there if there might be a lineage that
[1:29:33.880 --> 1:29:39.720]  goes back to that and that being said if the New World Order the people that are
[1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:44.840]  really bringing it in are have some sort of lineage to okay let me answer that
[1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:48.480]  question we get back thanks for the call I'll answer that and take a lot more
[1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:56.040]  calls straight ahead we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and

[1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:41.680]  give to select corporations by the way most of them not even us corporations
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:46.360]  about national security violation we pay for the research of taxpayers almost
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:49.480]  90% of all research going on at universities is for the federal
[1:34:49.480 --> 1:34:54.480]  government DARPA the military national complex it's undue influence over the
[1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:59.400]  colleges as president Dwight D Eisenhower said is farewell address in
[1:34:59.400 --> 1:35:10.640]  1960 but you know they wrote a story about how DARPA was working on putting
[1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:15.480]  up towers around us cities that would put out different waves to soothe people
[1:35:15.480 --> 1:35:20.240]  to stop riots just openly oh we're gonna put mine control towers up we're
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:24.280]  studying it and then a few weeks ago I saw mainstream tech magazine several of
[1:35:24.280 --> 1:35:27.600]  them we covered here on air saying oh yeah there's all these patents the
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:31.400]  government's looking at for ultrasound and ultra low frequency and all these
[1:35:31.400 --> 1:35:38.240]  different things that can soothe people and you know it can help you not have
[1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:41.340]  seizures or can help you not have Parkinson's or it can help you if you're
[1:35:41.340 --> 1:35:44.600]  depressed and oh they're talking about putting these up around the country to
[1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:49.480]  soothe the public I mean it's openly being announced and the callers like
[1:35:49.480 --> 1:35:54.040]  what does this do with Sumerian text this it's been in the San Francisco
[1:35:54.040 --> 1:35:56.840]  Chronicle the Houston Chronicle it's been all these papers they built all
[1:35:56.840 --> 1:36:03.720]  these FEMA camps and FEMA centers in the military civilian inmate labor camp
[1:36:03.720 --> 1:36:09.560]  program and the public still can't admit that they have trouble dealing with it
[1:36:09.560 --> 1:36:13.400]  or the army war college saying the military's main job will be suppressing
[1:36:13.400 --> 1:36:19.880]  American people during a collapse of the country and you know police come out
[1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:24.400]  and say and Phoenix we're ready to work with the military we're prepared to
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:27.640]  suppress the people and you know it's in hundreds of newspapers but still we're
[1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:31.840]  where it goes because we talked about a decade before not oh my gosh you were
[1:36:31.840 --> 1:36:37.800]  right tell me more now give me insights you study this is what you do or oh it's
[1:36:37.800 --> 1:36:41.760]  not that bad Alex no it is that bad it's happening we're slowly being acclimated
[1:36:41.760 --> 1:36:46.600]  and you know I get up on air and I talk about cross species human chimpanzee
[1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:58.400]  hybrids or I talk about glowing dogs that are part jellyfish and or potatoes
[1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:01.600]  that we're eating that kill the rats or sterilize the rats that eat them and
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:05.480]  and people go there's not there's not insect genes in the but you know in
[1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:11.640]  many strains of potato there's a lot of denial going on out there so we're here
[1:37:11.640 --> 1:37:16.200]  in the future we're here in 2009 this is Buck Rogers but the people running the
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:19.320]  system are using the Buck Rogers technologies to dumb us down to
[1:37:19.320 --> 1:37:23.720]  manipulate us to poison us and it's so crazy that people are kind of back in a
[1:37:23.720 --> 1:37:27.120]  1950s mode not believing this is happening we kind of live in this
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:32.240]  playland of work and malls and shops and our cars and waxing our cars or our
[1:37:32.240 --> 1:37:35.480]  jewelry or our neighbors are going out and having fun and we're in this
[1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:40.600]  suppressed technological system we're at least thirty deck three decades thirty
[1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:46.840]  years behind what the elites admit they really have and that they wall off from
[1:37:46.840 --> 1:37:51.160]  the public and their national security dictatorship that they're now expanding
[1:37:51.160 --> 1:38:00.720]  down into the stagnant technological playland that that we've all been locked
[1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:08.080]  in and you can use the analogy of the elite are above us in these technological
[1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:11.480]  spires or you can use the hg wells kind of like the elite that are cold-blooded
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:20.000]  and scientific and study us like a human might study amoebas in a petri dish you
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:24.640]  can use the analogy of their below us in the shadow government in the redoubts in
[1:38:24.640 --> 1:38:28.640]  the keeps in the shadow government like the more locks and we're the little
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:36.080]  Eloi up here on the surface like little idyllic animals sheep grazing lambs to
[1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:43.280]  the slaughter to the more locks by some twist of faith by some twist of fate we
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:49.440]  the Eloi and become slaves and the more locks are masters but nevertheless
[1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:56.760]  that's going on so I don't know about Egyptian and Sumerian text I don't know
[1:38:56.760 --> 1:39:04.280]  about Native American you know religious ideas and systems I mean I know
[1:39:04.280 --> 1:39:08.280]  about them but I don't cover all that here because we don't do a lot of
[1:39:08.280 --> 1:39:12.480]  speculating here we have trends we have globalist operations we read their
[1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:18.120]  published think tank documents until we're exhausted and we know we're in a
[1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:20.760]  scientific dictatorship we know they're bragging about it we know it's
[1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:24.120]  intensifying we know at the end of this things just get worse and worse and
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:27.240]  worse but they always promise give us more power it'll get better give us more
[1:39:27.240 --> 1:39:30.480]  power to get better and it gets worse and worse and worse and worse and I don't
[1:39:30.480 --> 1:39:34.960]  have all the answers all I could do is try to mobilize people but I don't try
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:38.600]  to weigh in and argue and fight with all the different thousands of Christian
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:42.960]  sex and denominations I don't try to get into this and argue about Muslims and
[1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:50.160]  Hindus and Buddhist and agnostics when I do cover religion I cover the elite and
[1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:54.560]  what their religion is and it is a guy a worship at the mid-level and the higher
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:57.880]  levels they are Luciferians they write books about it and they believe in
[1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:03.960]  killing the majority of the public and they're very sick satanic sadistic
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:10.100]  psychopathic sadist control freaks and and you know I just report that in a
[1:40:10.100 --> 1:40:15.320]  secular fashion I don't come at this through some preconceived cultural lens
[1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:18.680]  I mean we've all got that to a certain extent but I really try to knock that out
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:22.680]  and I try to really look at what's going on but has the Bible been used and
[1:40:22.680 --> 1:40:26.380]  twisted again to control people absolutely all religions all thought
[1:40:26.380 --> 1:40:34.000]  systems all philosophies can do that you know a really slick philosophy is what
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:37.800]  Obama's done because it's so simple it's just yes we can we're gonna make it
[1:40:37.800 --> 1:40:41.360]  better we're gonna work together brotherhood of men we're gonna feed the
[1:40:41.360 --> 1:40:45.400]  homeless we're gonna have a quality but that's all platitudes that's all the
[1:40:45.400 --> 1:40:49.960]  surface it's like the surface of an ice-cold coke bottle and inside is the
[1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:53.320]  ice-cold coke and you take a drink and it tastes good but there's cyanide in
[1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:59.640]  there and how do we know there's political silenide humanitarian cyanide
[1:40:59.640 --> 1:41:03.960]  social cyanide because we know who his masters are we know what his agenda are
[1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:09.480]  we know what his secretary of housing is gonna do what they said they're gonna
[1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:11.800]  do we know what their secretary of energy is gonna do we know what their
[1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:14.880]  drugs are gonna do we know what the secretary defense bill gates is gonna
[1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:24.400]  do Robert Gates always get his name mixed up with Bill Gates we know what
[1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:35.960]  their agenda is and so we're just here covering it we're just here dealing with
[1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:47.360]  it and trying our best to reach out to people trying our best to not even get
[1:41:47.360 --> 1:41:51.680]  folks to think like we're thinking but just to look outside the box just to
[1:41:51.680 --> 1:41:56.520]  think for themselves and to look at Robert Gates and Rahm Emanuel and
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:42:01.880]  Brazilian Brzezinski and Hillary Clinton and Timothy Gethner and just all
[1:42:01.880 --> 1:42:08.120]  of these people and who surrounds Obama we know what's in the package not what's
[1:42:08.120 --> 1:42:13.920]  on the packaging itself we know what's inside now I want to go back to your
[1:42:13.920 --> 1:42:18.320]  phone calls and blitz through them but I didn't play the entire Obama deception
[1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:22.000]  trailer the audio of it the videos up on info wars dot com and prison planet
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:26.720]  dot com we're asking you to tell your whole email list to post it on your
[1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:31.640]  MySpace to show your co-workers to really start the buzz on this film because
[1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:38.440]  it's a powerful film it's an informative film we've got probably 10 hours of
[1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:42.080]  already cut down footage and boiled on information the the great task we've
[1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:47.360]  worked on this for quietly for about four or five months this stuff takes time
[1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:50.080]  people are saying well why didn't you put this out during the election well we
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:52.880]  didn't have all the answers then we weren't sure he was going to betray now
[1:42:52.880 --> 1:42:56.920]  we are we were preparing we were doing interviews we were researching we knew he
[1:42:56.920 --> 1:42:59.880]  was going to do this but we had to let it flesh out plus it takes time to make
[1:42:59.880 --> 1:43:03.760]  a film I mean it takes people with hundreds of employees and big production
[1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:07.640]  companies years to make a documentary sometimes we're doing this in just a few
[1:43:07.640 --> 1:43:11.640]  months we've done all the research and I'm asking you to help us make this video
[1:43:11.640 --> 1:43:16.160]  that's on YouTube go absolutely viral we're also adding links to those pages
[1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:22.120]  to a members quality video free to the public from prison planet TV what a view
[1:43:22.120 --> 1:43:25.760]  of what our mid-grade we put out high mid and low and our low quality of course
[1:43:25.760 --> 1:43:30.400]  a lot better in YouTube for prison planet dot TV members so here is the
[1:43:30.400 --> 1:43:33.640]  Obama deception trailer
[1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:45.560]  on March 15th a carefully crafted corporate fraud will be exposed and a
[1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:51.000]  vicious hoax will be revealed to the people of the world contrary to the
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:57.400]  rumors that you've heard I was not born in a manger I was actually born on
[1:43:57.400 --> 1:44:03.800]  Krypton and sent here to save the planet Earth
[1:44:04.320 --> 1:44:10.360]  we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:15.100]  national security objectives that we set everybody somewhere between the
[1:44:15.100 --> 1:44:17.960]  ages of 1825 will serve three months of basic training
[1:44:17.960 --> 1:44:22.080]  we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful
[1:44:22.080 --> 1:44:35.160]  just as strong yes we care Obama is a cruel hoax he works for Wall Street he's
[1:44:35.160 --> 1:44:39.920]  an agent of finance capital where did you come up with the number 700 billion
[1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:43.920]  dollars here's the Treasury spokeswoman's quote it's not based on any
[1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:46.880]  particular data point we just really wanted to come up with a really big
[1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:53.160]  number to Democrats and Republicans who've opposed this plan I say step up
[1:44:53.160 --> 1:44:58.400]  to the plate a few members were even told that there would be martial law in
[1:44:58.400 --> 1:45:04.520]  America if we voted no secretary Henry Paulson is no George Washington I don't
[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:14.800]  think anyone questions mr. kashkari that you're working hard our question is who
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:21.880]  you're working for Obama pledged that he would resume the security and
[1:45:21.880 --> 1:45:26.080]  prosperity partnership talks between Mexico and Canada that president Bush
[1:45:26.080 --> 1:45:30.400]  initiated your boss start looking a lot like the new boss Robert Gates is gonna
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:34.240]  remain on the job as defense secretary for at least a year
[1:45:34.240 --> 1:45:39.040]  plenty of sources knew about this meeting told us and others that it was at
[1:45:39.040 --> 1:45:44.880]  the Hillary Clinton's house but clearly it wasn't we've got to give them a
[1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:49.120]  stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like
[1:45:49.120 --> 1:45:54.160]  to see we see you causing a depression so you could blow up the economy and
[1:45:54.160 --> 1:45:59.600]  consolidate it bankrupted we know that your enemies of free humanity and we
[1:45:59.600 --> 1:46:19.880]  are here the Obama deception on March 15 the people strike back and I'm on
[1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:25.160]  YouTube and I'm looking at the type of comments on these are the minority the
[1:46:25.160 --> 1:46:32.760]  comments but explosive 08 is the name of this person their comments at the top
[1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:37.440]  right now it says laugh out loud Republicans still crying your tears
[1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:50.360]  taste great go Obama kick some Republican ISS now the very next part of
[1:46:50.360 --> 1:46:54.440]  the film because this trailer is really the intro that's how I do it I'm so busy
[1:46:54.440 --> 1:46:58.600]  making the intro I never have to make a trailer so that the the I mean it's a
[1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:01.080]  little bit longer a little bit different but basically it's the same thing then
[1:47:01.080 --> 1:47:04.440]  it goes right into how Bush is evil Bush's new world order the people got
[1:47:04.440 --> 1:47:08.080]  mad at him and then how Obama's just a puppet and we go through the evidence
[1:47:08.080 --> 1:47:14.440]  and I thought about leaving that in there I thought it's just too long so but
[1:47:14.440 --> 1:47:17.440]  I mean clearly watching it you know it's bipartisan we're going after Henry
[1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:30.080]  Paulson we're going after all of these people we're going after Bush we're
[1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:36.600]  showing how Obama pushed through and supported the Banker bailout bill so
[1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:46.360]  does this person care does this person I mean I guarantee you if you talk to
[1:47:46.360 --> 1:47:52.360]  WTC 7 was pulled is a newcomer he says Alex Jones the first film to expose this
[1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:56.800]  con artist I really want to see it and then under him again as this explosive
[1:47:56.800 --> 1:48:01.920]  08 laugh out loud Republicans still crying your tears taste great go Obama
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:07.880]  kick some Republican hind in but I guarantee you if I talk to that person
[1:48:07.880 --> 1:48:11.040]  over a cup of coffee I'd say okay are you for the Banker bailout and the
[1:48:11.040 --> 1:48:14.200]  trillions missing and they won't say where it went are you for the Pentagon
[1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:18.240]  trillions missing as Obama supporting that with gates are you for the
[1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:24.000]  compulsory service are you for bombing Pakistan are you for moving Marines and
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:29.480]  army out of Iraq but keeping a bunch there and moving them into Afghanistan and
[1:48:29.480 --> 1:48:32.800]  instead of pulling down the troops they're sending the new recruits like
[1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:36.120]  Ted Anderson son who just joined the army to Afghanistan first so they're
[1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:41.280]  they're beefing it all up are you for that they'll go no no no no no no as long
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:46.000]  as you explain to these liberals hey I'm not a rush limbaugh fake conservative

[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:59.280]  affordable let's go ahead and go to the calls Tim in Ohio thanks for holding no
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:03.120]  problem Alex I had a few issues I wanted to discuss with you about the core
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:07.960]  nation especially dealing with these two preachers that they had briefly the
[1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:11.160]  the black preacher that came on I thought it was kind of racist because he
[1:56:11.160 --> 1:56:16.840]  came out he mentioned yellow black and red were were okay but white had to do
[1:56:16.840 --> 1:56:24.080]  right well they have to reapply the guilt not so that people actually live in
[1:56:24.080 --> 1:56:27.720]  harmony they have to remind everybody not to live in harmony and about
[1:56:27.720 --> 1:56:31.720]  supposed differences and then it's a cult of white guilt you know that there's a
[1:56:31.720 --> 1:56:37.040]  cult of guilt that matter of both my grandfather's fought for the US you know
[1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:41.680]  military against Hitler Americans in polls have guilt for the Holocaust like
[1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:48.040]  like we did it you know doesn't matter if if we fought against it you know it's
[1:56:48.040 --> 1:56:50.960]  the same thing with well Israel can kill all these people in Gaza because the
[1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:54.040]  Holocaust they can do a Holocaust themselves well it's the same thing with
[1:56:54.040 --> 1:56:57.520]  you know Americans are all white evil racist and we've got to have a big
[1:56:57.520 --> 1:57:00.600]  government to help the black people but what's the big government doing it's
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:04.240]  coming in with these abortions it's coming in with the birth control so
[1:57:04.240 --> 1:57:07.120]  there aren't black babies it's it's coming in to tell the woman don't have a
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:10.320]  man in the house to break up their family so they can then imprison their
[1:57:10.320 --> 1:57:15.240]  young men so so again they get us to go along with this guilt but then that's
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:19.240]  only to carry out a eugenics agenda against particularly the blacks so it's
[1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:22.320]  disgusting well yeah I'm not just thinking on him because the white
[1:57:22.320 --> 1:57:27.840]  preacher his prayer Alex it sounded more like a campaign speech and when he
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:31.760]  mentioned the daughter's names he started like he was doing a promo for some
[1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:35.800]  kind of pornographic movie where he said Sasha and I if you go back and listen
[1:57:35.800 --> 1:57:38.720]  to it I mean those are the things that that stood out to me and especially the
[1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:42.880]  part when he asked for forgiveness specifically said forgiveness for what
[1:57:42.880 --> 1:57:47.120]  we do to our fellow man and the environment and then during the Lord's
[1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:52.760]  Prayer the old was tight-lipped and stone-faced he did not pray and what's
[1:57:52.760 --> 1:57:55.880]  the deal with that second swearing-in ceremony behind closed doors at the
[1:57:55.880 --> 1:58:00.040]  White House yeah I mean it's one thing to screw up the oath and not redo it on
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:03.800]  the steps then days later do it in secret but then the press reported for
[1:58:03.800 --> 1:58:06.360]  the one-pull reporter that could be there in the White House photographer that
[1:58:06.360 --> 1:58:10.440]  there was no Bible see this all on purpose to let you know the old
[1:58:10.440 --> 1:58:14.200]  conventions are over things are changing thank you for the call appreciate it

[2:00:45.120 --> 2:00:50.640]  to say God bless you Jesse Ventura Willie Nelson Charlie Sheen Jason Burmese

[2:00:54.520 --> 2:00:59.440]  of inspiration with their in your face type reporting hey listen something
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:03.120]  interesting happened to me about two weeks ago I got a phone call from a
[2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:07.800]  telemarketer who started asking me my opinion of the Federal Reserve Board
[2:01:07.800 --> 2:01:13.080]  and once I figured out what they were trying to do I made sure that this woman
[2:01:13.080 --> 2:01:18.200]  understood that I thought it was an illegal organization that was not it's
[2:01:18.200 --> 2:01:23.680]  a private once you got let me tell you what you got it's called a push-pull and
[2:01:23.680 --> 2:01:28.040]  what they do is it isn't even about taking your poll it's a propaganda call
[2:01:28.040 --> 2:01:32.040]  hidden as a poll I mean this is mainline polling data this is not my opinion
[2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:36.120]  this is public information not widely known do you appreciate the Federal
[2:01:36.120 --> 2:01:41.840]  Reserve trying to save the economy and trying to get money to poor Americans you
[2:01:41.840 --> 2:01:44.920]  appreciate the Federal Reserve trying to do what it takes to get America back on
[2:01:44.920 --> 2:01:50.200]  the right track and then it's not really a poll it's to tell you about all the
[2:01:50.200 --> 2:01:54.080]  great stuff the Federal Reserve's doing that like both parties have push-pulls
[2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:58.080]  like one against say Obama do you appreciate the fact that he wants to
[2:01:58.080 --> 2:02:02.480]  confiscate guns do you like that and really it's and they'll even have your
[2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:05.520]  demographic and what I'm sorry have your phone number and know your pro-gun or
[2:02:05.520 --> 2:02:09.360]  know your Republican so they'll call or or vice versa you know if you're a
[2:02:09.360 --> 2:02:13.640]  Democrat pro-abortion do you appreciate the fact that Bush wants to ban you
[2:02:13.640 --> 2:02:17.240]  right to an abortion which wasn't true and so it's called a push-pull but let
[2:02:17.240 --> 2:02:19.640]  me guess they were telling you how great the Federal Reserve was in the
[2:02:19.640 --> 2:02:25.360]  questions actually no I think that they were asking me fairly neutral questions
[2:02:25.360 --> 2:02:28.760]  but I made sure that they understood my opinion was the Federal Reserve is an
[2:02:28.760 --> 2:02:33.760]  illegal organization and I support nothing of what they do and I tried to
[2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:37.040]  carefully answer the questions and make sure that that message got across and I
[2:02:37.040 --> 2:02:40.200]  did not feel like I was being manipulated into something else
[2:02:40.200 --> 2:02:44.000]  oh yeah well that was a separate deal that was a real that was a real poll by
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:47.200]  him but just people know the science of polling not that I'm an expert but I've
[2:02:47.200 --> 2:02:52.960]  studied it somewhat and I've paid for a few polls with Zogby what you do there
[2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:56.320]  is you see the Federal Reserve admits you'll see it in the news they've
[2:02:56.320 --> 2:03:00.040]  dispatched their agents their minions and they're calling in and paying large
[2:03:00.040 --> 2:03:05.120]  groups of high school and college academics to go out and propagandize
[2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:07.920]  for the Federal Reserve because they know they're the criminal group that's
[2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:11.080]  engineered the economy collapse so they've got to go out and put their
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:14.920]  spin out that they're actually fixing things but with you you were getting a
[2:03:14.920 --> 2:03:20.160]  poll to find out how their propaganda was working go ahead yeah exactly and I
[2:03:20.160 --> 2:03:24.680]  did tell the woman afterwards that she needed to research for her own personal
[2:03:24.680 --> 2:03:28.880]  information the other comment I want to make is about the 9-11 thing you know
[2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:32.080]  every time I talk to some of my friends I always tell them I'm very suspicious
[2:03:32.080 --> 2:03:37.200]  about what happened on 9-11 and the responses I get a real interesting and
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:43.360]  mostly people are afraid to see the truth because it rocks their world and
[2:03:43.360 --> 2:03:47.080]  their belief system and no one wants to lose their little piece of the pie that
[2:03:47.080 --> 2:03:53.040]  they have right now no I agree with you I mean it's scary to know that the people
[2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:58.120]  run the government are mass murders well the best thing we can do is get that
[2:03:58.120 --> 2:04:02.160]  information out there tell everyone we know to start asking questions I don't
[2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:06.840]  even ask people to believe me I just asked them to look at the facts and tell
[2:04:06.840 --> 2:04:11.160]  me where I'm wrong on what happened on 9-11 the last thing I want to say Alex
[2:04:11.160 --> 2:04:16.400]  is you know Obama came in as this flaming liberal all my conservative friends
[2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:20.040]  were worried about Obama I said don't worry about he's gonna be just like
[2:04:20.040 --> 2:04:25.080]  George Bush in six months and lo and behold here we are and their responses
[2:04:25.080 --> 2:04:30.440]  well Obama now sees the wisdom of the Bush approach and my answer is no
[2:04:30.440 --> 2:04:35.880]  exactly exactly exactly stay there I'm an old job this is important that is
[2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:40.480]  exactly what they're saying and doing in the cover of Newsweek is Obama learns
[2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:46.480]  the wisdom of Cheney so see that's the spin oh he was till he saw all the
[2:04:46.480 --> 2:04:51.960]  documents in the intelligence and now he's being reasonable and he goes on
[2:04:51.960 --> 2:04:57.160]  Stephanophilus's show and says oh that was all just campaign rhetoric yeah stay

[2:08:32.640 --> 2:08:35.400]  the economy in a moment get a Nancy Pelosi we're gonna continue with all
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:39.600]  your calls Gary in Chicago you were making a great point walk through that
[2:08:39.600 --> 2:08:43.760]  slowly for people because this is the psychology at work with Pat Roberts and
[2:08:43.760 --> 2:08:46.960]  all these Republican leaders limbaugh's gonna play the part of the opposition
[2:08:46.960 --> 2:08:50.320]  going hey he's pretty sensible I'm presently surprised hey he's gonna
[2:08:50.320 --> 2:08:54.320]  increase the wars hey he's gonna continue with Bush did the spin in Newsweek and
[2:08:54.320 --> 2:08:57.840]  Time when we go live at prison planet TV I'm gonna run back in the office and our
[2:08:57.840 --> 2:09:02.360]  research area and bring some of those covers up here on TV it says hey he's
[2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:06.400]  getting the wisdom of Cheney but see two weeks ago on Stephanopoulos that's
[2:09:06.400 --> 2:09:11.240]  what he said I agree with Cheney I need to keep these powers you know right
[2:09:11.240 --> 2:09:15.040]  before he got inaugurated a couple days before he's like yeah I I agree with
[2:09:15.040 --> 2:09:18.520]  Cheney I'm starting to see what he's saying is right I need to keep all these
[2:09:18.520 --> 2:09:23.640]  executive powers the signing statements all of it so the only thing he's done is
[2:09:23.640 --> 2:09:26.760]  pay lip service to Guantanamo and I remember two years ago they were talking
[2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:30.040]  about shutting down Guantanamo because it was just the public camp to sell
[2:09:30.040 --> 2:09:33.160]  everybody on this image that they're holding terrorist the real camps were
[2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:36.440]  overseas and now they're announcing they're gonna move them to Briggs here
[2:09:36.440 --> 2:09:39.640]  in the US and still have indefinite detention and Obama saying we don't know
[2:09:39.640 --> 2:09:42.400]  what we'll do with these terrorists and the news comes out look two people we
[2:09:42.400 --> 2:09:45.680]  released from Guantanamo are now all kind of commanders know their operatives
[2:09:45.680 --> 2:09:49.000]  putting out this info that's clear because that's what they're doing there
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:53.840]  is torturing people and interrogating people and offering people money to then
[2:09:53.840 --> 2:10:00.880]  go play the part just like Adam Gadan you know the son of the ADL head of the
[2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:04.920]  grandson of the ADL head who would go around a mosque beating Muslims up he
[2:10:04.920 --> 2:10:08.720]  had him so much and suddenly he's got a turbine on the Intel Center videos are
[2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:12.680]  being released directly from one of the former heads of Cyop at CIA under
[2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:17.720]  Rumsfeld and the Pentagon and going oh look Adam Gadan he's American al Qaeda
[2:10:17.720 --> 2:10:24.440]  he's going to get you I mean this is ridiculous go ahead Gary finish up well
[2:10:24.440 --> 2:10:29.280]  as I was saying Alex my conservative friends were all terribly afraid of
[2:10:29.280 --> 2:10:32.960]  seeing Obama's president and after listening to your program for civil
[2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:37.800]  years I said don't worry about Obama he's gonna end up being just like Bush and
[2:10:37.800 --> 2:10:42.240]  you're gonna be happy about it so now Obama goes in there and he approves the
[2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:47.400]  apparent bombing of Pakistan a few days ago and my friend was saying Obama
[2:10:47.400 --> 2:10:52.200]  sees the wisdom of George Bush's approach I said no that's not true I said
[2:10:52.200 --> 2:10:56.880]  what's happening is the sticking people are running Obama and Bush and that's
[2:10:56.880 --> 2:11:01.320]  why you're seeing the same policies keep happening Obama is a puppet and nobody
[2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:05.160]  wants to believe that yet but hold on hold on but but I mean hold on and
[2:11:05.160 --> 2:11:09.640]  finish your point but do your friends go yeah Gary I remember you six eight
[2:11:09.640 --> 2:11:14.000]  months ago warning me you're right gee tell me more they just offhandedly by
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:17.320]  the new propaganda we've never been at war with East Asia we've always been at
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:21.240]  war with East Asia up as down down as up black as white white as black I mean
[2:11:21.240 --> 2:11:25.880]  they're not saying yeah Gary you were right they're just no no they're not
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:29.800]  saying I was right and I have to keep reminding people I voted for George
[2:11:29.800 --> 2:11:34.720]  Bush in 2000 I'm sorry to say and today look at me you have to ask the
[2:11:34.720 --> 2:11:39.560]  question why did I change my point of view so radically in those intervening
[2:11:39.560 --> 2:11:44.120]  years what do I know what did I see that you apparently don't see no they're not
[2:11:44.120 --> 2:11:50.200]  agreeing Alex well you can learn you're not a sucker and again they'll think
[2:11:50.200 --> 2:11:54.680]  well who are you supposed to vote for in 2000 Al Gore no they control both but
[2:11:54.680 --> 2:11:58.960]  the people chose Gore and the establishment wanted to have Bush so he
[2:11:58.960 --> 2:12:02.600]  could play the part of a thug to then give us the savior this was all an
[2:12:02.600 --> 2:12:08.400]  elaborate setup good to hear from you great call okay Dino Joe Derek Lancher
[2:12:08.400 --> 2:12:12.440]  calls are coming up and then again Nancy Pelosi says birth controls the answer
[2:12:12.440 --> 2:12:16.040]  to fixing the economy I told you that be it when the economy imploded they'd roll
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:20.880]  out one-child policies they're saying hey we don't want tax incentives for having
[2:12:20.880 --> 2:12:25.400]  kids we want tax incentives to not have children when they admit that Japan and
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:28.440]  the US and others are having problems with the economy because we don't have
[2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:33.200]  enough people to fill the jobs by the baby boomers that start retiring what
[2:12:33.200 --> 2:12:39.080]  year what year the baby boomers start retiring this year and over the next
[2:12:39.080 --> 2:12:44.040]  decade the vast majority of the baby boomers will retire but right when you
[2:12:44.040 --> 2:12:47.640]  were supposed to get retirement money the pension funds are being rated the
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:51.720]  economy oh you're not getting your money I always told you you wouldn't get your
[2:12:51.720 --> 2:12:57.800]  money you'll get a small percentage of it with federal taxes on top of it but
[2:12:57.800 --> 2:13:01.360]  again I mean nobody respects us you know we're just always right we just know
[2:13:01.360 --> 2:13:05.000]  what we're talking about actually a lot of people do respect us and people say
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:09.480]  well suddenly conservatives like Obama and suddenly liberals like Obama absolutely
[2:13:09.480 --> 2:13:13.400]  because he's all things to all people he lies to them in these real simple
[2:13:13.400 --> 2:13:16.800]  platitudes where he doesn't get into any specifics but when you read the
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:21.640]  specifics of the real policy reports it is a nightmare and all these pundits from
[2:13:21.640 --> 2:13:27.000]  Gordon Brown to Henry Kissinger to Mr. Magnu Brzezinski running around saying
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:29.840]  this is the new world order Obama's gonna bring in the new world order and the
[2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:34.440]  public says there's no such thing as a new world order quit lying about it now
[2:13:34.440 --> 2:13:38.440]  gold I want to tell you a story about the economy here you go look this up gold
[2:13:38.440 --> 2:13:53.040]  was what 840 last week gold is now 905 dollars it is now 905 dollars and racing
[2:13:53.040 --> 2:14:00.480]  upwards to date I remember last week we got on air with gold the Ted bought when
[2:14:00.480 --> 2:14:09.200]  gold was at the 815 level two weeks ago passing on savings to you of 11%
[2:14:09.200 --> 2:14:14.560]  okay you can't find gold even at a premium most places are sold out Ted has
[2:14:14.560 --> 2:14:19.680]  it all and he has it at cheaper prices than it was weeks ago now he had to go
[2:14:19.680 --> 2:14:22.600]  up a little bit because he got a new position today a little bit from the
[2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:26.120]  deal we offered Friday and yesterday but again I'm only spend a few minutes with
[2:14:26.120 --> 2:14:31.640]  Ted here I hope you pay attention to what is happening with this economy how
[2:14:31.640 --> 2:14:34.160]  they're rating the bank accounts of the rating the pension funds how they're
[2:14:34.160 --> 2:14:39.000]  even rating the new vorice Swiss bank accounts they are going after everybody's
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:42.240]  money and if you think the banks are safe when they're openly saying we're
[2:14:42.240 --> 2:14:45.560]  now going into a depression when they're talking about Bank of America now
[2:14:45.560 --> 2:14:50.640]  defaulting when we've got major banks having to go into the FDIC money 40
[2:14:50.640 --> 2:14:56.880]  something billion bucks just last week it's insane to not take part of your
[2:14:56.880 --> 2:15:00.280]  401k part of your investments and put them in a gold and silver and to
[2:15:00.280 --> 2:15:04.600]  physically hold them it is insane Ted Anderson we're telling folks gold's
[2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:08.680]  only going up pricing and into the market what price are you going into this
[2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:12.840]  gold you got compared to what it now cost well when I went out when I was
[2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:17.560]  talking about it last week we're at 202 with Frank's and that was when gold was
[2:15:17.560 --> 2:15:23.720]  just up above 700 or $800 an ounce between 88 20 right in there I was
[2:15:23.720 --> 2:15:28.320]  buying positions at the 830 level too because I could see what's going on but
[2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:31.640]  I was able to do it at that price now that stuff was sold out one of the
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:36.360]  things about this Alex are the people that bought before midnight last night
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:40.080]  are now able to turn around and sell coins for more than they paid for them
[2:15:40.080 --> 2:15:44.360]  which is just a wonderful thing to be able to take on average you said you
[2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:49.880]  bought this gold at 815 level it's now 905 so that's what an almost a ninety
[2:15:49.880 --> 2:15:54.800]  dollar increase right now they can turn right back around Ted and then sell it
[2:15:54.800 --> 2:16:00.760]  back to you they can and and and a nice little tidy sum too so and gold has
[2:16:00.760 --> 2:16:05.280]  been as high as 916 today the market is definitely moving forward but what I
[2:16:05.280 --> 2:16:11.240]  have I do have a position of the Frank's at 214 now and they're currently right
[2:16:11.240 --> 2:16:17.600]  now in the marketplace pricing them for the market today of 905 there are 227
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:22.160]  and then I also have the British sovereign currently right now at 263 market
[2:16:22.160 --> 2:16:27.480]  price currently right now 277 so both of those coins are still priced at a
[2:16:27.480 --> 2:16:31.120]  really good buy I sold out of the walking Liberty halves I don't have any
[2:16:31.120 --> 2:16:36.160]  more of those not at that 840 level I do have some of the dimes left however and
[2:16:36.160 --> 2:16:41.880]  I have those at $1.59 per dime or per $100 face is usually what we sell them
[2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:48.400]  for in units and they're at 1590 per 100 face now somebody can't afford that if
[2:16:48.400 --> 2:16:52.120]  you want half of that that's fine it's just you know we just we try to put
[2:16:52.120 --> 2:16:57.720]  things together in packages plus also I have that Buffalo coin at 1036 Alex I
[2:16:57.720 --> 2:17:00.640]  don't know if you remember this or not that's the same price that I was
[2:17:00.640 --> 2:17:05.840]  offering that coin for back when gold was sitting down there in that 750 range
[2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:09.440]  so and there's not a lot of those but you're welcome to get those if you like
[2:17:09.440 --> 2:17:14.000]  them and they're certainly sitting at a very good buying range to do so just a
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:18.720]  really really amazing market I have to say a lot of people are moving into the
[2:17:18.720 --> 2:17:23.280]  gold and silver market I got to tell you it makes me smile not just because I'm
[2:17:23.280 --> 2:17:26.560]  in the business I just know what's going to happen to the dollar and I know
[2:17:26.560 --> 2:17:30.400]  what's going on I mean here we have here we have Barney Frank calling for the

[2:24:50.640 --> 2:24:59.280]  you I just wanted to talk about like basically the media how in Canada we
[2:24:59.280 --> 2:25:04.680]  we watch I mean there's more American news on our news than there is Canadian
[2:25:04.680 --> 2:25:13.920]  news and I mean when you watch the news American news all they seem to play is
[2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:19.760]  games of he said she said and you watch our news and it's so damn boring that
[2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:24.280]  you just want to change the channel no that's it yeah you've got more the
[2:25:24.280 --> 2:25:27.560]  British model of just the droning brainwashing and basic statistics that
[2:25:27.560 --> 2:25:31.640]  are all false or twisted and then here it's all left-right paradigm playing
[2:25:31.640 --> 2:25:36.120]  groups off against each other so we never look above at the elite above the
[2:25:36.120 --> 2:25:39.400]  little managers they've got down here they use as their front nominees or
[2:25:39.400 --> 2:25:43.400]  their shields and the elites behind the shield of Obama or Bush or the left
[2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:47.800]  right system and oh and limbaugh is attacking him oh my gosh I better get
[2:25:47.800 --> 2:25:51.680]  behind Obama because I'm not for limbaugh when meanwhile it's all the same
[2:25:51.680 --> 2:25:57.280]  agenda the government expands under Bush government expands under Obama I mean
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:02.000]  I I talked to my friend that I said look it's pretty bad when people know more
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:06.760]  about Paris Hilton's vagina than actual events you know it's it's kind of sad
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:11.440]  yeah it's all part of the distraction I appreciate your call Dina Joe in Texas
[2:26:11.440 --> 2:26:18.320]  you're on the air welcome hello Alex yes sir yes sir Alex someone to call
[2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:27.080]  about regarding Obama and Bush I'm a gunsmith here in Texas and regarding the
[2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:32.000]  second amendment that that how they're trying to make gunsmith get a
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:40.040]  manufacturers license spring of 2008 they had a career fair where ATF and the
[2:26:40.040 --> 2:26:47.600]  NRA were both there together and now they're wanting gunsmiths all over to
[2:26:47.600 --> 2:26:52.040]  having manufacturers license and again that I'm gonna hold you over this is
[2:26:52.040 --> 2:26:56.280]  important I saw that in the news yep through regulation that puts you under
[2:26:56.280 --> 2:27:02.200]  the control of a guild and then if just a citizen buys a gunsmithing book and
[2:27:02.200 --> 2:27:06.960]  learns how to clean their gun or fix it that's gonna be illegal quote modifying
[2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:11.760]  it and so again this is a way to further kill the gun culture explain it to
[2:27:11.760 --> 2:27:18.680]  people yes sir in the article which I can send you out there but in the
[2:27:18.680 --> 2:27:25.760]  article they're stating where quote unquote from the article November 2008
[2:27:25.760 --> 2:27:33.920]  they titled his date set for 2009 gunsmith career fair they make it a fun
[2:27:33.920 --> 2:27:38.000]  thing they make it a fun thing in the NRA is there they're pro-gun you can
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:41.300]  trust them come meet their friends at the Bureau of Alcohol tobacco and
[2:27:41.300 --> 2:27:45.240]  firearms conversation and they're gonna take good care of you yes or an area of
[2:27:45.240 --> 2:27:50.320]  an ATF and FBI is recruiting trying to recruit some of the gunsmith as a
[2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:54.720]  career fair it says quote unquote do you suppose possible ATF has been
[2:27:54.720 --> 2:27:59.160]  purposely vague about that finding gunsmithing versus manufacturing due to
[2:27:59.160 --> 2:28:04.080]  some form of top-to-bottom pressure applied by the revenuers good be since
[2:28:04.080 --> 2:28:09.800]  manufacturers must collect and pay excise taxes on their sole merchandise
[2:28:09.800 --> 2:28:16.920]  going down the man was asking me asking a question I'm still waiting this is a
[2:28:16.920 --> 2:28:21.640]  reporter I am still waiting for a black chopper to land on my lawn because I
[2:28:21.640 --> 2:28:26.480]  raised that question even though the ATF agent didn't have a very good answers
[2:28:26.480 --> 2:28:31.120]  to my questions I found a pretty good answer April May issue shop business
[2:28:31.120 --> 2:28:37.000]  going down it says if you the gunsmith perform work on a firearm that has been
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:42.600]  requested by a customer you are not manufacturing if you build a work on
[2:28:42.600 --> 2:28:47.480]  guns with the sole objective being to sell them later you're manufacturing and
[2:28:47.480 --> 2:28:52.840]  what I see in this Alex I want to hear your comments is that it's gonna affect
[2:28:52.840 --> 2:28:57.160]  the guys that reload ammunition more than that stop there I'm gonna hold you
[2:28:57.160 --> 2:29:00.000]  over this is so important because I've been reading about this and I haven't
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:02.760]  seen the article you're talking about in the industry publication email it to
[2:29:02.760 --> 2:29:07.200]  Aaron with two a's and info wars dot com will post a link to it right now he's
[2:29:07.200 --> 2:29:13.360]  in there updating I was curtain demo so we get that done every industry so with
[2:29:13.360 --> 2:29:17.840]  the animal ID the premises ID this new greenhouse gas emission they're gonna
[2:29:17.840 --> 2:29:21.680]  selectively make people go through regulations controls to shut them down
[2:29:21.680 --> 2:29:26.360]  to tax them to trace them and it's gonna be just like private sales if you work
[2:29:26.360 --> 2:29:30.960]  on a gun and then the guy goes and sells it they're gonna claim you did that for
[2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:34.880]  sales and they're gonna come raid you claiming you were illegally selling guns
[2:29:34.880 --> 2:29:39.440]  what they really want to do is kill the grassroots retooling and selling of
[2:29:39.440 --> 2:29:44.360]  private firearms and that's their big move so let's come back and talk about
[2:29:44.360 --> 2:29:51.680]  that when we get back the attack on the second amendment that is very real we're
[2:29:51.680 --> 2:30:00.080]  on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[2:33:02.480 --> 2:33:12.480]  strange days are here
[2:33:33.480 --> 2:33:41.420]  if they certainly have their way they will yes so a new age of big government
[2:33:41.420 --> 2:33:45.200]  regulation they didn't triple the size of the federal government and triple the
[2:33:45.200 --> 2:33:51.120]  size of the BATF and build the biggest federal building for any agency in the
[2:33:51.120 --> 2:33:58.320]  United States in DC a few years ago the four years to build it the new BATF
[2:33:58.320 --> 2:34:06.360]  command center the new BATFE they tried to change their name like on Santone
[2:34:06.360 --> 2:34:10.600]  everybody else does when they get exposed very very serious and they're
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:20.000]  coming after the gunsmiths now and the NRA was set up by the federal government
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:25.520]  as a mode of gun control after the Civil War and if you go study history we've
[2:34:25.520 --> 2:34:28.640]  had Larry Pratt Gunners of America on about this they supported the gun
[2:34:28.640 --> 2:34:34.080]  control act in 33 34 they supported the 68 gun control act they had Charlton
[2:34:34.080 --> 2:34:37.640]  Heston who I've interviewed God rest his soul got up on TV and said we're having
[2:34:37.640 --> 2:34:40.720]  these riots we've got to restrict the guns we've got to keep them out of felons
[2:34:40.720 --> 2:34:45.000]  hands and now they're going after the veterans and retired police trying to
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:48.360]  claim they've got post-traumatic stress again on guns and they may but you can't
[2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:51.960]  restrict people's rights because of that and then restrict mine the fact that
[2:34:51.960 --> 2:34:55.080]  there are a bunch of lunatics with guns there's more reason we need guns more
[2:34:55.080 --> 2:35:01.160]  guns less crimes to study show so continuing with Joe in Texas a gunsmith
[2:35:01.160 --> 2:35:06.480]  go ahead sir make your points yeah Alex only point I want to make was that in
[2:35:06.480 --> 2:35:13.440]  this article American Gunsmith Association in November 2008 and I'll
[2:35:13.440 --> 2:35:16.960]  finish up with this by Scott there was a Cree common ground upon which students
[2:35:16.960 --> 2:35:21.160]  graduates of residence schools as well as participating gunsmiths who were
[2:35:21.160 --> 2:35:25.280]  seeking employment could network with businesses and other organizations
[2:35:25.280 --> 2:35:30.640]  including some law enforcement agencies yeah that's the co-opting of the
[2:35:30.640 --> 2:35:36.240]  gunsmiths yes sir but and that's really about I had someone here you comment
[2:35:36.240 --> 2:35:41.080]  Alex and your blessing and voice in the wilderness sir well we're trying I
[2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:46.200]  appreciate your call well you've heard my comments on it I mean under the new
[2:35:46.200 --> 2:35:50.400]  green taxes they've got 80 plus in New York State I mean that they're just
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:54.320]  every facet of life while they squeeze the economy while they shut down Main
[2:35:54.320 --> 2:35:57.480]  Street they have to extract the tens of trillions of dollars they've already
[2:35:57.480 --> 2:36:01.400]  stolen when you write your income tax check it doesn't go to the IRS of the
[2:36:01.400 --> 2:36:06.920]  federal treasury it goes to the Federal Reserve but the Federal Reserve isn't
[2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:12.440]  federal it's private let's go ahead and talk to Derek in Detroit Derek you're on
[2:36:12.440 --> 2:36:18.960]  the year worldwide hey how you doing Alex good I'm calling about the Obama
[2:36:18.960 --> 2:36:24.840]  thing I live in Detroit and there's a huge black population here and you know
[2:36:24.840 --> 2:36:29.280]  I've been talking to a lot of people actually my my fiance she's black I've
[2:36:29.280 --> 2:36:34.120]  been talking to her family about it and as you were saying you know like the
[2:36:34.120 --> 2:36:41.640]  race issue over like shadows everything we had our city council actually
[2:36:41.640 --> 2:36:48.720]  endorsed him but through all the Kwame madness we had here it seems like our
[2:36:48.720 --> 2:36:55.240]  local media has totally forgotten the fact that one-third of our council
[2:36:55.240 --> 2:37:01.760]  members are being investigated by the FBI for taking payments from Senegro you
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:06.960]  know and it's like if you if you want to know what somebody is about you have to
[2:37:06.960 --> 2:37:12.360]  follow the money trail I mean that's just obvious and I mean to have these
[2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:17.800]  people who are so corrupt in our city called government backing someone such
[2:37:17.800 --> 2:37:23.360]  as Obama to the point where it's you know almost deifying and I mean it's no
[2:37:23.360 --> 2:37:27.800]  wonder you know everybody just seems to be blindsided what's happening what's
[2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:31.840]  happening is and it's shameful that you have to call it to say my my fiance's
[2:37:31.840 --> 2:37:35.640]  black I'm not racist but I mean that's how this whole thing's been dumbed down
[2:37:35.640 --> 2:37:41.640]  that's exactly what the KRS-1 said here on the air is that it's all about the
[2:37:41.640 --> 2:37:45.360]  rule we're putting on a black face the novelty of that distracting everybody
[2:37:45.360 --> 2:37:49.920]  from the point that he's a puppet anyways presidents don't run anything a be
[2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:54.520]  his agenda is New World Order and then see when all this thing implodes and
[2:37:54.520 --> 2:37:57.840]  falls in on itself it's going to be blamed on the black president and that's
[2:37:57.840 --> 2:38:01.240]  going to destroy race relations even that much more so we have to look down
[2:38:01.240 --> 2:38:07.280]  the line of where all of this is going and all these big cities Detroit Houston
[2:38:07.280 --> 2:38:12.720]  you know Dallas Los Angeles New York Chicago I mean it's all totally corrupt
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:15.960]  whether it's black leaders white leaders that's what the elite wants these
[2:38:15.960 --> 2:38:19.120]  people go up the chain of command they get the lobbyist money they get the
[2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:22.800]  media attention because they did take payoffs because they were corrupt and
[2:38:22.800 --> 2:38:27.440]  they'll work with the globalist I mean we had the big toll road companies come
[2:38:27.440 --> 2:38:31.560]  in here and spend hundreds of millions of dollars in lobbying to literally just
[2:38:31.560 --> 2:38:36.720]  have the entire interstate and in Texas highway system 8,000 miles of it plus
[2:38:36.720 --> 2:38:41.080]  handed over to them and it's come out it's total corruption payoffs all this
[2:38:41.080 --> 2:38:44.800]  one of the companies do they just buy up the newspapers to stop that reporting
[2:38:44.800 --> 2:38:48.320]  when it happens to seize the roads and put toll roads on them where they make a
[2:38:48.320 --> 2:38:51.600]  couple hundred million dollar investment over the decade and they get hundreds of
[2:38:51.600 --> 2:38:55.280]  millions of dollars in tolls in the next decade and they're about hundreds of
[2:38:55.280 --> 2:38:58.880]  millions just in Texas alone if they're able to do this hundreds of millions you
[2:38:58.880 --> 2:39:04.400]  know per toll road per year I mean this is just massive and so yes you have this
[2:39:04.400 --> 2:39:10.560]  big city Chicago machine creature Morocco Obama who is surrounded by
[2:39:10.560 --> 2:39:15.160]  criminals and cutthroats and thugs and Blagojevich who Rahm Emanuel handled he
[2:39:15.160 --> 2:39:21.720]  brought those two up together as his protege's but then you have Cheney and
[2:39:21.720 --> 2:39:25.840]  Halliburton being offshore and tens of billions of dollars in no bid contracts
[2:39:25.840 --> 2:39:29.680]  and all that corporate corruption it is just the new world order is private
[2:39:29.680 --> 2:39:34.640]  offshore banks and companies combining forces offshore robbing all the nations
[2:39:34.640 --> 2:39:38.680]  of the world and then buying off those nations politicians to sign treaties
[2:39:38.680 --> 2:39:41.920]  with the World Trade Organization and other private groups that then have
[2:39:41.920 --> 2:39:45.320]  more authority over the governments over what they do then the nations are
[2:39:45.320 --> 2:39:49.360]  totally bankrupt they have to sign IMF World Bank agreements to follow whatever
[2:39:49.360 --> 2:39:53.080]  these private banks say and now they're even skipping that and saying we're
[2:39:53.080 --> 2:39:56.720]  going to create a world bank that sets the currency sets the interest rates
[2:39:56.720 --> 2:40:00.960]  regulates private industry regulates local businesses where this private
[2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:04.560]  banking group that engineered all this openly runs everything it is so
[2:40:04.560 --> 2:40:10.400]  incredible it's happening now everything we said it's in newsweek and time and
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:14.720]  everywhere saying world government world government is here the bankers will save
[2:40:14.720 --> 2:40:19.160]  you with world government and it's just more of the same so I absolutely it's I
[2:40:19.160 --> 2:40:23.720]  mean that's who they want they want crooks they can work with I don't know
[2:40:23.720 --> 2:40:30.200]  if you actually know what Senegal is about they they're a waste management
[2:40:30.200 --> 2:40:34.480]  what they want to do is they want to convert our our waste management that is
[2:40:34.480 --> 2:40:39.640]  city ran you know it's employees Michigan Michigander's you know this is
[2:40:39.640 --> 2:40:43.800]  your sir sir all the corruption is about seizure of architecture make your
[2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:48.160]  point and then I'll elaborate oh well they were the whole plan is that they
[2:40:48.160 --> 2:40:54.200]  want to take human fecal pellet ties it and then sell it is is fertilizer for
[2:40:54.200 --> 2:40:59.640]  crops here in our state and I I mean I don't know sir that's always that's
[2:40:59.640 --> 2:41:03.480]  always the cover they want the water treatment they want the waste management
[2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:07.080]  they want the infrastructure of the city and then they'll say oh it's for wind
[2:41:07.080 --> 2:41:11.440]  power oh it's for fertilizer when that's only one small part that gives it a
[2:41:11.440 --> 2:41:15.840]  green sound to sell the public on that has been brainwashed let me comment on
[2:41:15.840 --> 2:41:20.200]  that you brought this up and what did I say I said they want corrupt politicians
[2:41:20.200 --> 2:41:25.800]  in who will hand over the roads before even got into the waste management who
[2:41:25.800 --> 2:41:30.680]  will who will hand over the city and state paid for gas lines the power
[2:41:30.680 --> 2:41:34.320]  plants the coal power plants the hydroelectric plants the new plants
[2:41:34.320 --> 2:41:38.720]  taxpayers pay for it private groups manage it still make the profit that
[2:41:38.720 --> 2:41:43.000]  isn't enough in the IMF World Bank plan I've been screaming about the 2002 they
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:46.880]  said in the West in England in Iceland in like we did in Argentina they said in
[2:41:46.880 --> 2:41:53.120]  the US in Canada in Australia in Europe we are going to bankrupt the economy
[2:41:53.120 --> 2:41:57.080]  and then the people have to come to the private banks the government's become the
[2:41:57.080 --> 2:42:00.960]  private banks to go into receivership in the IMF World Bank says we'll give you
[2:42:00.960 --> 2:42:05.960]  these loans we'll prop your currency up but to do that to be bailed out with
[2:42:05.960 --> 2:42:12.120]  your own money you have to do this hundred plus list and that's handover
[2:42:12.120 --> 2:42:16.120]  your all of your infrastructure and so that's why most of the US water
[2:42:16.120 --> 2:42:19.080]  districts and things are now owned by foreign offshore companies because
[2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:23.920]  that's the group and so they'll come in to a paid for water district and the
[2:42:23.920 --> 2:42:26.560]  federal even right regulations saying doesn't matter if you got a brand new
[2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:29.080]  water treatment you've got to upgrade it with this you know four hundred
[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:32.280]  million dollar package for some mid-sized city I mean I've seen it was in the
[2:42:32.280 --> 2:42:34.400]  front page of the paper the other day here in Austin all the corruption
[2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:37.880]  involved it even comes out that it's all corrupt and so they force them to
[2:42:37.880 --> 2:42:42.720]  quote be insolvent because they can't pay for it the city can't pay for it with
[2:42:42.720 --> 2:42:47.800]  the mandate they say don't worry we have this European banking subsidiary that
[2:42:47.800 --> 2:42:54.520]  owns a water district company a waste management the water management
[2:42:54.520 --> 2:43:00.680]  company they'll come in and you just basically sell your water district your
[2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:07.320]  pipes everything to them the wastewater cleaning facilities to us for nothing
[2:43:07.320 --> 2:43:12.080]  and we'll pay for the upgrade then they usually don't even do the upgrade so see
[2:43:12.080 --> 2:43:17.680]  how that works oh yeah and they are just taking everything over anything else
[2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:22.840]  oh no nothing but you know you're doing a great job and I enjoy listening to
[2:43:22.840 --> 2:43:27.080]  every day and you know keep up the good work man I appreciate everybody if
[2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:30.680]  everybody had the guts like you got to get out and say what's really going on
[2:43:30.680 --> 2:43:34.400]  maybe wouldn't be in this situation but you have a great one Alex thanks for
[2:43:34.400 --> 2:43:37.760]  the time in thank you yeah I'm just somebody who 13 years ago got in the
[2:43:37.760 --> 2:43:41.440]  fight well really 15 years ago going around in politics and things that 13
[2:43:41.440 --> 2:43:47.600]  years ago on air and so now we're in a position to have all people listening
[2:43:47.600 --> 2:43:52.600]  but we need to grow exponentially to get the word out to others I mean I can go
[2:43:52.600 --> 2:43:56.560]  into this even more but the roads the land I mean here's another example of
[2:43:56.560 --> 2:44:01.560]  seizing a seizing infrastructure all over the country whether it's New
[2:44:01.560 --> 2:44:06.000]  London Connecticut or whether it's Hoboken New Jersey or whether it's
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:10.920]  Austin Texas they will go on the news and they will say a salamander is dying
[2:44:10.920 --> 2:44:15.560]  it's very rare it's in this pool in the middle of the city the water is running
[2:44:15.560 --> 2:44:20.200]  off from construction and we'll kill it this is the case of Austin so they say
[2:44:20.200 --> 2:44:24.560]  all right we're gonna have a 15,000 acre land grab and a 5,000 acre land grab
[2:44:24.560 --> 2:44:27.800]  and a thousand acre land grab and you know 20 or 30 other little you know
[2:44:27.800 --> 2:44:30.440]  hundred acre land grabs here and there it's all these different pieces of land
[2:44:30.440 --> 2:44:35.400]  and they say we're gonna have a city bond proposal to buy this land but then
[2:44:35.400 --> 2:44:39.000]  they make the people that on the land sell it saying well because of the
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:42.560]  snail daughter or the Golden Sheik Warbler bird or the cave bug or the
[2:44:42.560 --> 2:44:46.400]  salamander you can't build and so their property value goes down they're just
[2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:49.840]  sitting there on it and they say it doesn't matter you can sell to us for
[2:44:49.840 --> 2:44:54.320]  five ten cents on the dollar then the city councils with the nature
[2:44:54.320 --> 2:44:58.240]  conservancy which is now the biggest landowner in the US they come in and two
[2:44:58.240 --> 2:45:01.000]  or three years later it's the same in every single when everybody's forgotten
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:06.280]  that oh that 15,000 acres was supposed to be a giant park and they'll take 200
[2:45:06.280 --> 2:45:10.520]  acres 300 acres of it I go to these parks of Hill Country off the road and
[2:45:10.520 --> 2:45:16.760]  then that will be a park that will be a park but then they build big roads in
[2:45:16.760 --> 2:45:21.720]  and build houses and condos and golf courses and resorts here in Austin and
[2:45:21.720 --> 2:45:27.640]  in huge hotel day spas and they just take the restrictions off they say you
[2:45:27.640 --> 2:45:30.680]  know what we're gonna go ahead and build on this we said we weren't see so they
[2:45:30.680 --> 2:45:35.360]  basically steal the land pay for it with our money and then openly former
[2:45:35.360 --> 2:45:40.680]  mayors open the banks hurt Watson just opens a bank and says I have the bank
[2:45:40.680 --> 2:45:45.200]  and I have the deals inside government he's now a state senator for only I am
[2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:50.200]  allowed to decide who can build on this and then literally I mean it's just
[2:45:50.200 --> 2:45:58.200]  that's one example it's everywhere it's everywhere in New London, Connecticut
[2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:03.480]  thousands and thousands of homes in a upper middle class to lower middle class
[2:46:03.480 --> 2:46:07.240]  area depending on which area there along the waterfront we're talking three
[2:46:07.240 --> 2:46:11.000]  story Victorian homes that were valued a million bucks six hundred thousand
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:14.040]  dollars I interviewed the families was in the news and they tell them a decade
[2:46:14.040 --> 2:46:17.640]  ago we're gonna force you to sell your houses and by the way we're not see the
[2:46:17.640 --> 2:46:24.880]  New London Connecticut Supreme Court ruling of three four years ago was it
[2:46:24.880 --> 2:46:30.280]  New London I've got the name of the even the case New London kilo New London
[2:46:30.280 --> 2:46:38.680]  kilo decision and they just say guess what we're not going to pay you market
[2:46:38.680 --> 2:46:43.120]  value for your house before they could come steal your land through adverse
[2:46:43.120 --> 2:46:48.640]  possession and through imminent domain and say we've got to pay you market
[2:46:48.640 --> 2:46:53.160]  value and then you could generally get what it was on the tax rolls no no no
[2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:58.280]  the new ruling and the media simplified it to people don't like you know having
[2:46:58.280 --> 2:47:02.720]  their houses taken for roads that wasn't it a big pharma company the city a few
[2:47:02.720 --> 2:47:05.600]  other companies wanted to build headquarters there so they set the
[2:47:05.600 --> 2:47:10.440]  precedent they said we are going to take your thousand plus homes and by the
[2:47:10.440 --> 2:47:13.160]  time the decision most of them given up only a few hundred homes were still
[2:47:13.160 --> 2:47:16.440]  there places where grandma lived upstairs and the kids are doing the
[2:47:16.440 --> 2:47:21.560]  family been there for hundreds of years family homes famous homes historical
[2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:29.240]  homes and they said in the decision not only can government if it wants to
[2:47:29.240 --> 2:47:32.840]  build a road or something take your land you don't have to be paid for
[2:47:32.840 --> 2:47:38.840]  fair market value and private interest can legally lobby to have your land
[2:47:38.840 --> 2:47:42.440]  taken and it's even legal for bribery to happen it says it they don't call it
[2:47:42.440 --> 2:47:47.760]  bribery that they say they can lobby and give campaign donations openly to
[2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:51.920]  politicians to take your land locally and then once they take your land
[2:47:51.920 --> 2:47:57.720]  locally they don't even have to pay you for it except what it would be for the
[2:47:57.720 --> 2:48:01.320]  piece of land itself under a condemnation then the families that fought
[2:48:01.320 --> 2:48:05.000]  were told years before the decision three years ago was it four years ago
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:11.280]  now time flies if you find us we will give you court fees and so not only
[2:48:11.280 --> 2:48:14.600]  where their houses taken without being paid they were then given the court
[2:48:14.600 --> 2:48:18.360]  fees for fighting it and the Supreme Court said that was okay so this is
[2:48:18.360 --> 2:48:21.720]  going back like a thousand years ago to ancient Europe or something or the
[2:48:21.720 --> 2:48:25.000]  Byzantines where they would just say we just are taking your land because the
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:32.400]  emperor says so now that's what was different it wasn't just imminent
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:37.840]  domain issue it was we can just take your property and all the major land
[2:48:37.840 --> 2:48:42.200]  owners in Texas have gotten these notices my dad owns a good sized piece of
[2:48:42.200 --> 2:48:46.880]  family property and he got notices a few years ago the Texas landowner and
[2:48:46.880 --> 2:48:50.400]  homeowners Bill of Rights sounds like you're getting it's like Patriot Act
[2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:55.240]  takes your rights away but is unpatriotic it's called Patriot Act and in the
[2:48:55.240 --> 2:49:00.440]  forums my dad showed me it said you're put on notice as a land owning a
[2:49:00.440 --> 2:49:06.360]  taxpayer that if you refuse a pipeline or you refuse drilling or you refuse a
[2:49:06.360 --> 2:49:09.880]  bridge or you refuse anything the government wants to do with your property
[2:49:09.880 --> 2:49:15.280]  you have six weeks to comply and take the first offer or you forfeit the offer
[2:49:15.280 --> 2:49:22.640]  and you get nothing it's an offer you can't refuse like Don Carleone having
[2:49:22.640 --> 2:49:28.480]  Luca Brasi put the gun to the band leader's head and say hey either your
[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:31.560]  signatures on that contract or your brains are gonna be on that contract
[2:49:31.560 --> 2:49:38.680]  it's the same thing you got six weeks you take the office or it's refused and
[2:49:38.680 --> 2:49:43.720]  only takes is it now I'm telling you that's rogue government because you've
[2:49:43.720 --> 2:49:48.840]  got these international bankers who have created more fiat currency than all the
[2:49:48.840 --> 2:49:54.040]  wealth in all the world they've created thousands of trillions it's all fiat
[2:49:54.040 --> 2:49:58.840]  it's all bull it isn't real but it has value to your local governments they
[2:49:58.840 --> 2:50:01.240]  will take it they will send police they will do whatever it takes to get that
[2:50:01.240 --> 2:50:05.840]  money and because people won't get give up their real assets for the fiat money
[2:50:05.840 --> 2:50:10.820]  the globalist need to force take over the economy and force take over the
[2:50:10.820 --> 2:50:14.400]  nouveau riche and old wealth that isn't part of the elite and so it's saying
[2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:18.920]  we're coming in forcibly taking your land and if we don't want to we won't
[2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:23.720]  even pay you this is property rights is the foundation of any free society it
[2:50:23.720 --> 2:50:27.440]  is the most basic slave scan on property and they watered that down with
[2:50:27.440 --> 2:50:31.840]  with us with a property tax you pay a daily rent on your land it isn't
[2:50:31.840 --> 2:50:36.800]  really your land people put up with that crap in the last hundred years now it's
[2:50:36.800 --> 2:50:40.520]  oh we're putting environmental restrictions on oh we're gonna force you
[2:50:40.520 --> 2:50:45.760]  to sell oh we're gonna again this is only part of it all right we're coming

[2:55:13.760 --> 2:55:20.320]  air hi Alex can you hear me loud and clear okay great yeah thanks for taking
[2:55:20.320 --> 2:55:24.800]  my call um look I'm not for one that thinks there's a demon behind every
[2:55:24.800 --> 2:55:29.600]  bush I'm objective but I saw something I haven't really heard a lot of
[2:55:29.600 --> 2:55:35.240]  comments on in regards to the inauguration or coronation whatever of
[2:55:35.240 --> 2:55:40.320]  Hussein Brock Hussein Obama last week and now I'm first of all I'm a I'm a
[2:55:40.320 --> 2:55:44.520]  single parent I've been that way for nine years I got four kids two of them have
[2:55:44.520 --> 2:55:52.520]  recently moved out anyways uh in regards to uh this inauguration I have a child
[2:55:52.520 --> 2:55:56.280]  that is in high school and another one in grade school they had them watch the
[2:55:56.280 --> 2:56:01.800]  inauguration and brainwash them exactly and and just not only that Alex I found
[2:56:01.800 --> 2:56:07.280]  out that happened to a lot of people and I wanted you to comment on it was this
[2:56:07.280 --> 2:56:11.720]  how wide was this done because it appeared to me from what I found out it
[2:56:11.720 --> 2:56:16.280]  was massively preplanned and my son even had a nice little packet on how
[2:56:16.280 --> 2:56:22.480]  wonderful Joe Biden in Barak is and it just really bothered me that was a real
[2:56:22.480 --> 2:56:26.600]  red flag for me as a parent because I I've never seen that done with any my
[2:56:26.600 --> 2:56:29.800]  other children I've never gone to see something like that it's never been
[2:56:29.800 --> 2:56:32.880]  done it's never been done in America it was only done with Hitler Stalin and
[2:56:32.880 --> 2:56:36.800]  Mao it is the opposite of a free society sir they are running with
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:40.440]  government money in production what's got to be a billion dollar program it's
[2:56:40.440 --> 2:56:47.680]  on every TV every radio newsprint join us a service dot org which is separate
[2:56:47.680 --> 2:56:52.160]  from government is a group under Barack Obama being advertised as join the
[2:56:52.160 --> 2:56:57.040]  government every major school district in the nation through federal curriculum
[2:56:57.040 --> 2:57:01.560]  and schools are saying they're adopting the Obama curriculum and that is
[2:57:01.560 --> 2:57:06.560]  literally the worship of Barack Obama and that he will save you and packets of
[2:57:06.560 --> 2:57:11.640]  info it was all over the news in fact I saw that last week never even got to it
[2:57:11.640 --> 2:57:15.960]  on air well actually I didn't mention it and show the article one of many where
[2:57:15.960 --> 2:57:19.480]  it said that they're all forced to watch it and then hear how great it is and
[2:57:19.480 --> 2:57:25.040]  hear how this is our new dear leader and again governments the presidents never
[2:57:25.040 --> 2:57:29.920]  had their own private army they've never had billboards as if you know
[2:57:29.920 --> 2:57:34.800]  announcing him I mean they have that in North Korea and so but America's have
[2:57:34.800 --> 2:57:37.840]  never lived under real hardcore tearing they live under corruption it's bad
[2:57:37.840 --> 2:57:41.120]  presidents but see we're going into receivership now so they need this
[2:57:41.120 --> 2:57:46.920]  messianic leader to get everybody in line and I haven't seen the packets I
[2:57:46.920 --> 2:57:49.720]  read that they were given information about the historic president and the
[2:57:49.720 --> 2:57:54.080]  feds printed it up notice how he changed the look of the website
[2:57:54.080 --> 2:57:59.000]  White House dot gov to match USA service and and and his other private sites
[2:57:59.000 --> 2:58:04.400]  if they're all unifying it in a unified front and they're going to now make the
[2:58:04.400 --> 2:58:09.680]  children federally serve us and this is on change dot gov till the news reported
[2:58:09.680 --> 2:58:12.720]  and they pulled it off but it's in a manuals book and Obama spoken about it
[2:58:12.720 --> 2:58:15.760]  and all people email me saying it isn't true when we have all the screenshots
[2:58:15.760 --> 2:58:20.600]  saying your children will be basically taken from you for hours every week to
[2:58:20.600 --> 2:58:25.280]  go serve under whatever Obama says they must serve in or they're going to be
[2:58:25.280 --> 2:58:27.920]  expelled it's like there's no law you've got to take vaccines but if you don't

[3:02:49.480 --> 3:02:53.600]  and what's happening is uh... i know that there's a lot of character assassination
[3:02:53.600 --> 3:02:56.600]  from the other side and instead of just
[3:02:56.600 --> 3:03:00.360]  confronting and discussing the facts of the art and i like to compare what's
[3:03:00.360 --> 3:03:01.680]  happening to
[3:03:01.680 --> 3:03:04.360]  uh... the general american public in general
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:08.120]  to the uh... you probably heard of the frog that uh... is placed in the pot of
[3:03:08.120 --> 3:03:09.200]  water
[3:03:09.200 --> 3:03:11.160]  and you turn on the uh...
[3:03:11.160 --> 3:03:16.560]  the uh... heat will slow you don't go fast but that that problem not jump out
[3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:20.480]  but it will boil to death as the heat is slowly turned up
[3:03:20.480 --> 3:03:21.960]  absolutely good to hear from you

[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:35.760]  uh... to sign up for this on economy where they can get a job flippin hamburgers
[3:03:35.760 --> 3:03:36.540]  right now
[3:03:36.540 --> 3:03:37.680]  i've seen reports where
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:40.520]  in one case in los vegas and there was another case i saw
[3:03:40.520 --> 3:03:45.400]  uh... in uh... solid city were of a thousand people show up at a mcdonald's
[3:03:45.400 --> 3:03:47.720]  for a seven dollar an hour job
[3:03:47.720 --> 3:03:49.880]  as if you can live on that look at this
[3:03:49.880 --> 3:03:53.040]  fill your life with endless possibilities army

[3:03:58.960 --> 3:04:00.600]  but see they're not going to allow that

[3:04:12.160 --> 3:04:13.400]  what's going on
[3:04:13.400 --> 3:04:16.600]  uh... by the way folks they shoot you up with enough vaccines to kill an elephant
[3:04:16.600 --> 3:04:17.920]  once you join the military
[3:04:17.920 --> 3:04:20.800]  just just that alone in the use experimental vaccines on you

[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:29.120]  uh... but they have a little waiver in there that's for you know

[3:08:27.480 --> 3:08:32.600]  right now let's go to jim in west virginia you're on the air jim welcome
[3:08:32.600 --> 3:08:36.280]  yeah here's more property seizure just about as bad don't worth anything else
[3:08:36.280 --> 3:08:39.480]  and you want to wake up your favorite yuppie do a program on the international
[3:08:39.480 --> 3:08:43.240]  property maintenance code it's actually the international property seizure code
[3:08:43.240 --> 3:08:46.840]  and that's under and that's why you think you got local government but
[3:08:46.840 --> 3:08:50.520]  internationally they set the code on how to steal property how to take over how
[3:08:50.520 --> 3:08:52.840]  to find and feed people for three inch grass
[3:08:52.840 --> 3:08:56.600]  the grass that's all internationally written up through zoning go ahead
[3:08:56.600 --> 3:08:59.880]  yes it's in black and white it's the second biggest financial scam in u.s
[3:08:59.880 --> 3:09:02.600]  history it's about five times bigger than the back of bailout it's hidden in
[3:09:02.600 --> 3:09:05.480]  plain sight for years international property
[3:09:05.480 --> 3:09:09.320]  maintenance code and that's all under that's all under agenda 21 the u.m
[3:09:09.320 --> 3:09:11.080]  people say they don't have any power so the quick
[3:09:11.080 --> 3:09:14.600]  i don't have any power well but what they do is they set
[3:09:14.600 --> 3:09:17.240]  global policy like when bush signed back on the unesco
[3:09:17.240 --> 3:09:20.600]  that put our schools publicly under u.n curriculum go ahead
[3:09:20.600 --> 3:09:23.720]  download it read it i can fast forward you on it i can leave my phone number
[3:09:23.720 --> 3:09:26.680]  up there and there's a deeper this is collateralization
[3:09:26.680 --> 3:09:30.440]  grabbing real estate and that domain but a pale besides the ip mc
[3:09:30.440 --> 3:09:34.680]  and that's because when they bankrupt the nation they forcibly take the land
[3:09:34.680 --> 3:09:38.200]  so they've got to assess it and bring in the predatory rules so under color of
[3:09:38.200 --> 3:09:40.680]  law they can do it tell folks briefly about it
[3:09:40.680 --> 3:09:44.840]  okay real quick like the code official is a sole interpreter the code
[3:09:44.840 --> 3:09:48.360]  anything the code official says is every every day that a fraction occurs a
[3:09:48.360 --> 3:09:51.880]  separate mandatory misdemeanor anything the code official says is not in good
[3:09:51.880 --> 3:09:55.160]  working order bam it's five hundred a thousand dollars a day and or a month in
[3:09:55.160 --> 3:09:58.440]  jail for every day this occurs anything the code official says it's not there
[3:09:58.440 --> 3:10:01.880]  they've passed these illegal criminal predatory rules now they're slowly getting
[3:10:01.880 --> 3:10:05.080]  you ready for it where you hear about cities where they do home inspections
[3:10:05.080 --> 3:10:08.680]  every month to make sure the inside of the house you supposedly own is in order
[3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:13.560]  or three inch grass two thousand dollar a day fines they're now phasing
[3:10:13.560 --> 3:10:18.360]  these in on everybody and again it's all done through maritime it's all done
[3:10:18.360 --> 3:10:22.520]  through administrative law it's done and there's no recourse
[3:10:22.520 --> 3:10:27.000]  it's just total fraud go ahead it it is not a law which is passed by legislators
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:31.240]  signed by a chief executive officer it is a code and this is the code that
[3:10:31.240 --> 3:10:34.920]  regional government will use to control people that's why they set up these
[3:10:34.920 --> 3:10:38.200]  regional governments where five six counties are together three four states
[3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:42.680]  are together in these FEMA regions they then instruct the cities what to do
[3:10:42.680 --> 3:10:46.520]  go ahead it is a code that is adopted by jurisdiction
[3:10:46.520 --> 3:10:49.240]  and you you're there you can prevent you from entering your house
[3:10:49.240 --> 3:10:52.760]  yeah also anything the code official says is an unsanitary conditioned dog
[3:10:52.760 --> 3:10:56.760]  dropping the puddles anything he says is a noxious weed defined noxious weed
[3:10:56.760 --> 3:11:00.120]  now did a show with um dairy brownfield got more reaction anything he done in
[3:11:00.120 --> 3:11:03.400]  twenty or thirty years about two and a half years ago what's your rate

[3:11:28.920 --> 3:11:31.880]  demolition costs and the mortgage payment
[3:11:31.880 --> 3:11:35.480]  i'll email i'll leave you my phone number i mean i was interrupting briefly
[3:11:35.480 --> 3:11:40.040]  explain what this is raw property seizure
[3:11:40.040 --> 3:11:43.640]  okay the code official soul interpreter forget judicial anything
[3:11:43.640 --> 3:11:47.080]  without action court action or notice they can prevent you from any or home

[3:12:57.320 --> 3:13:01.560]  after me over six bags of grass cuttings of dead gutter our house is not a dump
[3:13:01.560 --> 3:13:03.880]  there were 150 flowering species in our front yard
[3:13:03.880 --> 3:13:07.320]  my wife uses the the mulch the grass cuttings for mulch
[3:13:07.320 --> 3:13:10.440]  bags of grass cuttings i had a dented gutter they were going to put me in
[3:13:10.440 --> 3:13:12.600]  jail two months and or eleven hundred dollars of fines
[3:13:12.600 --> 3:13:15.160]  of six bags of grass cuttings and a dented gutter
[3:13:15.160 --> 3:13:18.520]  okay you've heard the reports about swatting people for tall grass
[3:13:18.520 --> 3:13:21.560]  you're well out that was a bit at one time they're threatening to frighten me
[3:13:21.560 --> 3:13:25.720]  for a shovel handle visible though the porch railing now i beat it
[3:13:25.720 --> 3:13:28.920]  only because i contacted 200 mainstream media outlets
[3:13:28.920 --> 3:13:32.600]  local newspaper had entered known since we were in high school together
[3:13:32.600 --> 3:13:35.800]  uh... everybody nobody helped me finally dairy brownfield helped me
[3:13:35.800 --> 3:13:39.400]  we did a show on july 14th 2006
[3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:42.120]  ed from michigan calls in they said yeah they got my you want to hear a horror
[3:13:42.120 --> 3:13:42.760]  story
[3:13:42.760 --> 3:13:46.200]  east and clear shores uh michigan i think he said they took my house down my
[3:13:46.200 --> 3:13:49.400]  son was in cuffs when i came home they wouldn't let us in a house they tore
[3:13:49.400 --> 3:13:53.880]  the house down our possessions in it and uh yeah so it's it's a horror story
[3:13:53.880 --> 3:13:57.960]  but it will wake up the yuppies but now i got lucky because i sat there after i
[3:13:57.960 --> 3:14:01.400]  got all this garbage going i promised dairy that i'd give out names addresses
[3:14:01.400 --> 3:14:05.720]  phone numbers depending on how they handle it well the city backed off
[3:14:05.720 --> 3:14:10.280]  now it's totally criminal and i knew it was in texas because
[3:14:10.280 --> 3:14:14.440]  i remember back in 95 96 i mean somebody would have grasped that tall
[3:14:14.440 --> 3:14:17.640]  but the city one of their land and they always pick old people after you've
[3:14:17.640 --> 3:14:19.720]  been in the hospital it's in the health department
[3:14:19.720 --> 3:14:22.840]  and they enter that you're sick and they know you've got colon cancer or whatever
[3:14:22.840 --> 3:14:26.840]  that's when they hit and uh... they try to give him $2,000 i mean this
[3:14:26.840 --> 3:14:30.600]  think about predatory that is is that they wait because i saw the case is
[3:14:30.600 --> 3:14:33.720]  it's always an old person at least it was in austin
[3:14:33.720 --> 3:14:36.120]  and then they put two thousand dollar-day fines
[3:14:36.120 --> 3:14:39.080]  by the time the person fights in a few weeks later they take them to court
[3:14:39.080 --> 3:14:42.600]  then they take the land the police come in throw them out on the street
[3:14:42.600 --> 3:14:46.040]  throw all their stuff out the city takes it and then bureaucrats
[3:14:46.040 --> 3:14:49.800]  move in a lot of times they sell it but it's the
[3:14:49.800 --> 3:14:52.680]  did you see me a week ago when i covered how they're throwing old people out of
[3:14:52.680 --> 3:14:54.760]  their houses and then the bureaucrats move into them
[3:14:54.760 --> 3:14:59.800]  i was listening i mean that's mainstream the criminals are in government
[3:14:59.800 --> 3:15:03.640]  criminals are running everything well i'll tell you what i've had
[3:15:03.640 --> 3:15:07.800]  the fbi out here i have had uh... a message from the governor within about
[3:15:07.800 --> 3:15:10.600]  a few hours at the time which i did the radio show and it doesn't air in west
[3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:14.360]  virginia on the shortwave um... i've i've had all kinds of interesting things
[3:15:14.360 --> 3:15:16.440]  happened to me ever since but this is a hot target
[3:15:16.440 --> 3:15:19.880]  but i'm not kidding you uh... it sounds so benign international property
[3:15:19.880 --> 3:15:22.920]  maintenance code if you want to know what your government is all about it's a
[3:15:22.920 --> 3:15:25.720]  yeah that's just one of our founding fathers said
[3:15:25.720 --> 3:15:29.960]  government is always about stealing property uh... people taking people from
[3:15:29.960 --> 3:15:33.400]  property in foreign wars and taking property from people to
[3:15:33.400 --> 3:15:36.360]  domestically well i can't remember any federalist papers or something
[3:15:36.360 --> 3:15:39.480]  but the bottom line is very simply if you want to know what your government is
[3:15:39.480 --> 3:15:41.720]  all about if you're still living in denial
[3:15:41.720 --> 3:15:45.320]  read the international property maintenance well if you're in denial
[3:15:45.320 --> 3:15:49.560]  read section 802 of the patriot act it says all misdemeanors are acts of
[3:15:49.560 --> 3:15:52.840]  terrorism and i hold the articles up where they're charging people for
[3:15:52.840 --> 3:15:57.800]  terrorism from marijuana absolutely so the bottom line is if you're in denial
[3:15:57.800 --> 3:16:01.960]  read it and we get a lawyer to read it i don't care it's very hard sir send me
[3:16:01.960 --> 3:16:05.320]  your name your info your background some news articles about it
[3:16:05.320 --> 3:16:07.800]  we always have to vet everybody but i'm aware of what you're talking about we'll
[3:16:07.800 --> 3:16:10.840]  have you on thank you um...
[3:16:10.840 --> 3:16:14.040]  you see that's why the supreme court ruled two weeks ago there's no more
[3:16:14.040 --> 3:16:17.320]  fourth amendment they have to get in line with the patriot act
[3:16:17.320 --> 3:16:20.680]  that's why they passed the patriot act to get in line with agenda 21
[3:16:20.680 --> 3:16:25.320]  and one part of it is this international agreement on the zoning
[3:16:25.320 --> 3:16:28.440]  sounds benign it's what he was just talking about international property
[3:16:28.440 --> 3:16:33.160]  management uh... system and uh... there's several that nexus together
[3:16:33.160 --> 3:16:35.560]  there's several that people and it's all you and created
[3:16:35.560 --> 3:16:39.240]  and it says you own nothing it's what stalin used to get people off their
[3:16:39.240 --> 3:16:42.120]  land uh... and then you read the new london
[3:16:42.120 --> 3:16:47.720]  uh... connecticut new london kilo decision and it says that now
[3:16:47.720 --> 3:16:51.720]  i want to go ahead and get into the uh... army right now
[3:16:51.720 --> 3:16:57.240]  now they have brought into all of the major public schools
[3:16:57.240 --> 3:17:01.800]  obama day obama uh... curriculum
[3:17:01.800 --> 3:17:06.120]  worshipping obama also having the military in the schools so i wanted to
[3:17:06.120 --> 3:17:09.720]  play this video clip from cbs we can analyze it it's far worse than this
[3:17:09.720 --> 3:17:13.560]  this is katie currick covering it where they didn't tell the children
[3:17:13.560 --> 3:17:17.480]  it's the law you've got to sign up with the military i'll have you arrested
[3:17:17.480 --> 3:17:21.080]  and then the guy that did this in one of the cases he was promoted to one of
[3:17:21.080 --> 3:17:25.560]  the national directors in winnow one of these reports so
[3:17:25.560 --> 3:17:29.160]  a year after their threat to arrest people it turns out that's the policy
[3:17:29.160 --> 3:17:33.160]  it's all color of law they promote the guys that get in trouble so here it is
[3:17:33.160 --> 3:17:37.560]  houston reveals some recruiters have resorted to bullying tactics in order
[3:17:37.560 --> 3:17:42.920]  to keep their numbers up david martin at the pentagon has the story
[3:17:42.920 --> 3:17:46.920]  from nascar to bull riding army recruiters are pulling out
[3:17:46.920 --> 3:17:51.160]  all the stops to meet their quotas but one recruiter was caught in a tape
[3:17:51.160 --> 3:17:55.880]  recorded phone call doing it with threats
[3:17:58.520 --> 3:18:02.680]  according to the report by cbs affiliate kho u in houston
[3:18:02.680 --> 3:18:05.800]  urban gonzalez signed a non-binding contract
[3:18:05.800 --> 3:18:09.640]  that left him free to change his mind about joining the army up to the moment
[3:18:09.640 --> 3:18:13.480]  he reported for basic training which is exactly what he did
[3:18:13.480 --> 3:18:17.160]  i'd rather just stay here go to college but listen to what his recruiter
[3:18:17.160 --> 3:18:21.240]  sergeant glenn marquette told him would happen as soon as you get pulled over for
[3:18:21.240 --> 3:18:24.600]  speeding ticket they're gonna feed it to a deserter
[3:18:24.600 --> 3:18:30.120]  then they're gonna apprehend you take you to jail so guess what all that loving
[3:18:30.120 --> 3:18:33.480]  jobby i want to go to college and all this guess what he is threw it out the
[3:18:33.480 --> 3:18:37.960]  window because he just screwed your life not only is none of that true it also
[3:18:37.960 --> 3:18:41.960]  violates regulations against threatening recruits 17-year-old
[3:18:41.960 --> 3:18:45.960]  eric martinez says he was told the same thing when he changed his mind
[3:18:45.960 --> 3:18:49.720]  you can go to jail put a warrant out for you and you spend your time
[3:18:49.720 --> 3:18:54.440]  in jail instead that's enough that's enough it's a hundred times worse
[3:18:54.440 --> 3:18:57.960]  and if you go track this case is a few years ago the work there's worse out of
[3:18:57.960 --> 3:19:01.800]  denver and other places they get them to sign the form
[3:19:01.800 --> 3:19:04.440]  in the principal's office when you get in trouble
[3:19:04.440 --> 3:19:07.480]  they call you in because they now have recruiting stations in the schools
[3:19:07.480 --> 3:19:09.640]  and they're on the playground with them and they're at the football games they
[3:19:09.640 --> 3:19:12.600]  go you got in that fist fight you're gonna go to jail for that there's a
[3:19:12.600 --> 3:19:16.360]  police officer out there to arrest you right now or you sign this form agree
[3:19:16.360 --> 3:19:20.840]  in to go to the army but because they can't have them sign a binding form
[3:19:20.840 --> 3:19:24.440]  till they're at age because they're a minor it's a trick form
[3:19:24.440 --> 3:19:28.120]  then once they sign the form agreeing tentatively to think about it
[3:19:28.120 --> 3:19:31.400]  then they say i'm gonna arrest you if you don't sign that and everybody i know
[3:19:31.400 --> 3:19:36.200]  has been told this now that's the stick they have the carrot
[3:19:36.200 --> 3:19:39.560]  forty thousand dollar signing bonus here's the deal
[3:19:39.560 --> 3:19:43.240]  they bait and switch and don't give you the money
[3:19:43.240 --> 3:19:47.960]  because it's a criminal group the government is criminal you can say
[3:19:47.960 --> 3:19:51.080]  some of the troops aren't criminal but the system itself is a
[3:19:51.080 --> 3:19:54.440]  look they lie and say you got to take vaccines and there's no law
[3:19:54.440 --> 3:19:58.440]  they're a pack of criminal scum the schools are there to take your children

[3:27:03.160 --> 3:27:06.520]  confront a gurgon but anyway this call concerns um
[3:27:06.520 --> 3:27:10.040]  last thursday when joe rogan was on i listened to your show
[3:27:10.040 --> 3:27:13.320]  and you guys were having an interchange about corruption and
[3:27:13.320 --> 3:27:16.200]  the usual stuff and then he said something like
[3:27:16.200 --> 3:27:20.920]  what if it was the anunnaki come to the earth or something weird like that so i
[3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:24.520]  stopped the rick you know i listen online i stopped it i googled anunnaki
[3:27:24.520 --> 3:27:28.280]  and i spent three days like pulling my hair out
[3:27:28.280 --> 3:27:31.800]  about this um bottom line is have you seen the 2012 preview
[3:27:31.800 --> 3:27:35.400]  uh the movie 2012 that's coming out by emric
[3:27:35.400 --> 3:27:38.680]  yeah or the worlds yeah or they are especially destroyed
[3:27:38.680 --> 3:27:42.120]  yeah by the tidal wave or whatever the preview is this really ominous thing this
[3:27:42.120 --> 3:27:45.640]  guy in the mountains it looks like the hemelea is a wave coming over the
[3:27:45.640 --> 3:27:49.480]  mountains but in any case i stumbled on to a couple sites that you know i got
[3:27:49.480 --> 3:27:53.160]  through all the alien crap um and i stumbled on to a couple sites that
[3:27:53.160 --> 3:27:58.120]  believe that the south pole telescope that was built last year was to track
[3:27:58.120 --> 3:28:02.200]  this um object that's going to come through our solar system
[3:28:02.200 --> 3:28:05.720]  and mess up earth gravity and the world governments know it and they make a
[3:28:05.720 --> 3:28:10.280]  pole shift yeah no no the well let me just let me just i appreciate it i want
[3:28:10.280 --> 3:28:13.320]  to hear your comment but go ahead all the movies since 83 and if you look at
[3:28:13.320 --> 3:28:16.360]  emric all the movies he's made or these doomsday sort of
[3:28:16.360 --> 3:28:21.320]  know of know his arc movies um like the day after tomorrow he made as well and
[3:28:21.320 --> 3:28:24.280]  it's to confuse the public this is their premise and i want to get your comment
[3:28:24.280 --> 3:28:27.400]  on it if you confuse the public so that when something like that happens
[3:28:27.400 --> 3:28:30.120]  you know they can stage an alien invasion they can stage all the stuff
[3:28:30.120 --> 3:28:33.320]  that we've been conditioned to be a project project bluebeam
[3:28:33.320 --> 3:28:35.720]  okay so so what do you think i mean what do you think about the south pole
[3:28:35.720 --> 3:28:39.320]  telescope have you looked at it apparently this there's some you
[3:28:39.320 --> 3:28:42.440]  there's a couple youtube videos of some pictures leaked
[3:28:42.440 --> 3:28:45.880]  and look i can't say whether it's true or not i'm just saying it now because
[3:28:45.880 --> 3:28:49.560]  so have you taken a look at that let me comment on it i appreciate your call
[3:28:49.560 --> 3:28:54.840]  thank you yeah you about yeah look um giant homeland security blimp publicly
[3:28:54.840 --> 3:29:00.120]  launched five years ago the new singing in larry king live abc they show him
[3:29:00.120 --> 3:29:02.360]  and say we don't know what it is the government won't say what it is it's
[3:29:02.360 --> 3:29:07.000]  probably aliens it's a blimp with the rudders with the fins with the pods
[3:29:07.000 --> 3:29:10.520]  surveilling the public it's a lot cheaper than satellites
[3:29:10.520 --> 3:29:13.640]  they could put them up there and have them sit at 100 000 feet above the jet
[3:29:13.640 --> 3:29:17.480]  streams off solar power and and scan you and and track you and everything you're
[3:29:17.480 --> 3:29:22.680]  doing you know what does it do with ananaki
[3:29:22.680 --> 3:29:25.480]  well the media knows those are blimps why are they hyping them up as ufo's
[3:29:25.480 --> 3:29:28.760]  because they want to hype this so certainly hollywood and the day after
[3:29:28.760 --> 3:29:32.680]  tomorrow and and uh... the day the earth stood still it's all
[3:29:32.680 --> 3:29:36.920]  about doomsday destruction aliens uh... coming
[3:29:36.920 --> 3:29:40.760]  and so when we come back i'll briefly finish up my comment about
[3:29:40.760 --> 3:29:44.520]  what's really behind that and uh...

[3:33:21.320 --> 3:33:24.520]  bush it's all torn up in pieces he's putting it back together we've seen
[3:33:24.520 --> 3:33:27.800]  that hundreds of times look at this the new global
[3:33:27.800 --> 3:33:32.280]  elite i showed this about two weeks ago special double issue of newsweek and i
[3:33:32.280 --> 3:33:36.840]  wanted to zoom in on this because we were analyzing this closer last night
[3:33:36.840 --> 3:33:41.080]  and everything is 666 they'll show three things by three things
[3:33:41.080 --> 3:33:45.800]  over and over and over again and he's got a crown on
[3:33:45.800 --> 3:33:50.200]  there's all this mind control illuminati symbolism on here
[3:33:50.200 --> 3:33:53.880]  down here again they'll repeat something three times and have it by three times
[3:33:53.880 --> 3:33:58.040]  they have it by three times and until it forms 666
[3:33:58.040 --> 3:34:02.280]  uh which is all this cabala stuff and and what this is
[3:34:02.280 --> 3:34:06.040]  is in cabala they will and it's a lot of other weird
[3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:10.440]  mysticism religions they will draw things they believe by showing it or
[3:34:10.440 --> 3:34:13.960]  showing the numbers or showing a drawing a picture and then it's like a
[3:34:13.960 --> 3:34:18.200]  prayer that it makes it happen and again we told you over a decade ago that
[3:34:18.200 --> 3:34:22.040]  madonna was doing cabala rituals in her concerts and now for about three years
[3:34:22.040 --> 3:34:25.240]  she's been admitting that for over a decade she's been doing that
[3:34:25.240 --> 3:34:29.320]  so you can laugh at this all day uh this is uh
[3:34:29.320 --> 3:34:32.840]  this is saying the world government the world elite it lists all these
[3:34:32.840 --> 3:34:36.200]  world elite around him are giving all their power under the beast and i'm not
[3:34:36.200 --> 3:34:39.960]  saying he's the antichrist i'm saying that's what they believe they're doing
[3:34:39.960 --> 3:34:42.600]  okay now answering the last guy's question i'm gonna go through some more
[3:34:42.600 --> 3:34:46.680]  of these obama magazine covers and then some other news than your calls
[3:34:46.680 --> 3:34:52.920]  to answer his question christians thought that hitler was the antichrist in
[3:34:52.920 --> 3:34:58.840]  europe so they stood down to him uh the seventh day ad venice the the jahovas
[3:34:58.840 --> 3:35:03.080]  witnesses even some of the baptist uh but they weren't so much into the hole
[3:35:03.080 --> 3:35:05.640]  this is the end of the world thing at that time those groups were
[3:35:05.640 --> 3:35:08.600]  they went all and i'm not bashing any of these groups the point is they went
[3:35:08.600 --> 3:35:11.560]  along with it and didn't fight back because they thought
[3:35:11.560 --> 3:35:14.920]  that it was the end of the world and so that's kind of a cop out in the new
[3:35:14.920 --> 3:35:18.360]  world order version of christianity to say well the rapture is going to happen
[3:35:18.360 --> 3:35:21.000]  nothing you know praise god they're calling for microchips and world
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:24.200]  government because that means we're about to be teleported out of here
[3:35:24.200 --> 3:35:27.320]  it's ridiculous it's not in the bible okay
[3:35:27.320 --> 3:35:30.840]  you know it says that uh the beast wages war on the saints overcomes them
[3:35:30.840 --> 3:35:34.040]  the saints go through the tribulation but if you don't believe in that you know
[3:35:34.040 --> 3:35:37.480]  that's your issue the point is that that that what they push isn't real
[3:35:37.480 --> 3:35:41.960]  christianity now it's the same thing with planet
[3:35:41.960 --> 3:35:45.560]  x i remember in 1999 everybody got mad at me i said planet x wasn't real
[3:35:45.560 --> 3:35:49.960]  it wasn't coming it wasn't going to kill us uh and and and then i predicted the
[3:35:49.960 --> 3:35:53.560]  guy right in the book about it he said it was coming in 2002
[3:35:53.560 --> 3:35:56.440]  i said watch he'll claim that the gregarian calendar was wrong and now
[3:35:56.440 --> 3:35:59.480]  it's a year later and exactly what i predicted he did
[3:35:59.480 --> 3:36:02.200]  and then they said oh it's still coming and then people ask me what about planet
[3:36:02.200 --> 3:36:04.760]  x what about the anunnaki it's coming through our solar system
[3:36:04.760 --> 3:36:08.280]  do planets come through do planets would come through do giant asteroids hit the
[3:36:08.280 --> 3:36:10.520]  earth does it cause massive calamities
[3:36:10.520 --> 3:36:13.880]  is this stuff you know yes but are they setting the date
[3:36:13.880 --> 3:36:16.520]  you know and and then you've got the mayans if you really study what they
[3:36:16.520 --> 3:36:20.360]  said when the Aztecs uh in that part of the mayan
[3:36:20.360 --> 3:36:24.680]  culture the who were in power this is a mayan culture which is different tribes
[3:36:24.680 --> 3:36:28.200]  um they just said that 2012 was the end of an age
[3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:33.400]  and the startup of a new one okay and uh that that's in their own text so this
[3:36:33.400 --> 3:36:36.840]  whole thing about the world ending but the globalists love that they love that
[3:36:36.840 --> 3:36:38.840]  idea because then people say all screw what's
[3:36:38.840 --> 3:36:41.720]  happening with the economy or the banks of the world order why should i fight
[3:36:41.720 --> 3:36:45.160]  back 2012 it all ends anyways
[3:36:45.160 --> 3:36:49.160]  now the i said i was gonna make a jfk film and work on it for three years
[3:36:49.160 --> 3:36:53.080]  it's suspended again for the obama film then it's suspended again for a 2012 film
[3:36:53.080 --> 3:36:57.400]  i'm making that's my next film i'm gonna rush it out at light speed after obama
[3:36:57.400 --> 3:37:01.240]  so that i can explain that 2012 is a fraud and a lie
[3:37:01.240 --> 3:37:05.080]  but that major crises are going to be happening up until that point
[3:37:05.080 --> 3:37:09.400]  and after okay so we're gonna make a 2012 film
[3:37:09.400 --> 3:37:12.680]  it's happening it's in the workspin the works for years
[3:37:12.680 --> 3:37:17.080]  um i kind of got off on this track last year if i want to be cinema verite
[3:37:17.080 --> 3:37:19.800]  i want to make a cinema verite film and i did and it's a great film it's the most
[3:37:19.800 --> 3:37:24.360]  quote entertaining good to watch like mainstream you know movie
[3:37:24.360 --> 3:37:27.880]  truth rising is excellent and it was kind of like oh as a filmmaker i want to
[3:37:27.880 --> 3:37:31.400]  do this i don't have time to do that the the jfk will be a
[3:37:31.400 --> 3:37:34.920]  cinema verite but and and it'll end up coming out
[3:37:34.920 --> 3:37:39.960]  um but um it's just more important to hit these issues
[3:37:39.960 --> 3:37:43.080]  right now by the way the trailer for uh the
[3:37:43.080 --> 3:37:47.800]  obama deception my new film comes out march 15th normally we make a film
[3:37:47.800 --> 3:37:50.360]  about six months seven months we're making this one in three months
[3:37:50.360 --> 3:37:54.120]  i'm working on it the last month and a half and doing some research before
[3:37:54.120 --> 3:37:57.800]  that but uh over the last four months but doing we're doing this in a
[3:37:57.800 --> 3:38:01.080]  accelerated program here on top of everything else we're doing because we
[3:38:01.080 --> 3:38:03.960]  know the time is short the enemy's moving against humanity
[3:38:03.960 --> 3:38:07.880]  the enemy knows the time is short and we're doing that but uh there's your
[3:38:07.880 --> 3:38:11.080]  answer i don't get into aliens and stuff like that
[3:38:11.080 --> 3:38:13.560]  is their government program to have a fake alien landing yeah that's the
[3:38:13.560 --> 3:38:16.760]  classified are they hyping it up in the culture clearly
[3:38:16.760 --> 3:38:20.360]  uh and i you know talk about that from time to time
[3:38:20.360 --> 3:38:26.440]  i cover what i can prove there is 666 all over this this is cabala
[3:38:26.440 --> 3:38:31.240]  he is wearing a crown it is saying global government with both
[3:38:31.240 --> 3:38:35.880]  hemispheres this is like church of the subgenius
[3:38:35.880 --> 3:38:39.240]  illuminati artwork yeah that's what this is
[3:38:39.240 --> 3:38:42.920]  and all this other stuff 44
[3:38:43.640 --> 3:38:49.480]  44 which is a big cabala number also in the german runes in the norse
[3:38:49.480 --> 3:38:53.160]  system that's one of the most powerful numbers that in 88 same thing with the
[3:38:53.160 --> 3:38:56.280]  chinese
[3:38:56.280 --> 3:39:00.520]  there's obama gonna save us hundreds of magazines saying this people are mailing
[3:39:00.520 --> 3:39:04.200]  us 2009 auguration special america's hope
[3:39:04.200 --> 3:39:07.640]  rock obama how he will change our world what he's
[3:39:07.640 --> 3:39:11.560]  gonna do for you if you turn over yourself and your
[3:39:11.560 --> 3:39:14.280]  soul and your mind your thinking process they're saying just do what he says
[3:39:14.280 --> 3:39:17.160]  he'll fix it don't worry about that look at this parade magazine

[3:39:30.600 --> 3:39:34.200]  we're part of his family and they didn't do stuff like this for
[3:39:34.200 --> 3:39:37.480]  bush the full b system the full new order system
[3:39:37.480 --> 3:39:41.080]  is putting their power behind him right now
[3:39:41.080 --> 3:39:44.680]  here's the gay magazine the advocate what will he do
[3:39:44.680 --> 3:39:47.880]  for you first
[3:39:47.880 --> 3:39:52.280]  what will he do for you first and i should have marked it we're putting
[3:39:52.280 --> 3:39:58.040]  this in the film um it it talks about uh
[3:39:58.040 --> 3:40:03.160]  austerity movement austerity chic and how not having
[3:40:03.160 --> 3:40:05.800]  money is going to be a great thing in the new obama thing and how we've all
[3:40:05.800 --> 3:40:09.400]  lived too good and it's been bad for the earth
[3:40:11.880 --> 3:40:14.760]  austerity
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:21.000]  chic and how it's chic it's stylish how novelist
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:26.280]  and performance artist mike albo gets by and lean times
[3:40:26.840 --> 3:40:30.200]  and then it just goes through that okay
[3:40:32.360 --> 3:40:36.440]  here is the clash of fascist colors and i've seen
[3:40:36.440 --> 3:40:40.280]  musolini posters hitler posters mal posters
[3:40:40.280 --> 3:40:46.680]  um marks posters fidel Castro posters the same coloration
[3:40:46.680 --> 3:40:52.600]  and even three weeks ago the
[3:40:52.600 --> 3:40:55.640]  washington post did an article admitting that they're using fascist and
[3:40:55.640 --> 3:40:58.040]  communist overtones and nomenclature but said it's
[3:40:58.040 --> 3:41:03.560]  it's for the good of america and earlier in the show i talked about how
[3:41:03.560 --> 3:41:06.120]  blacolor brought up the point that he told all those conservative friends
[3:41:06.120 --> 3:41:08.680]  don't worry don't worry about obama you're gonna like him he's acting like
[3:41:08.680 --> 3:41:11.560]  an ultra liberal the guy's going to increase the wars
[3:41:11.560 --> 3:41:15.480]  the police state all of it uh and then now he's come out
[3:41:15.480 --> 3:41:18.680]  on national television said well that was all campaign rhetoric i agree with
[3:41:18.680 --> 3:41:21.720]  cheney i need to do what he did i need the new
[3:41:21.720 --> 3:41:24.280]  presidential powers that they claimed they had
[3:41:24.280 --> 3:41:27.720]  that i had said was you know improper power or tyranny
[3:41:27.720 --> 3:41:30.520]  because we didn't i do need these powers to fix things
[3:41:30.520 --> 3:41:35.160]  and then here's newsweek what would dick do while obama may soon find virtue
[3:41:35.160 --> 3:41:42.040]  and cheney's vision of power and that's been the talking point by cheney and
[3:41:42.040 --> 3:41:43.080]  others and then it's obama you know he doesn't like cheney but
[3:41:43.080 --> 3:41:50.040]  he's realizing he's realizing here that he's got to do it oh he doesn't like it
[3:41:50.040 --> 3:41:56.280]  but there he is signing some order and realizing he's got to do it
[3:41:56.280 --> 3:42:02.520]  so classic propaganda there now
[3:42:02.520 --> 3:42:10.040]  i want to get to these articles and then your calls for everybody that's holding
[3:42:10.040 --> 3:42:14.680]  in japan where they have a 1.3 1.4 depending on which year it is
[3:42:14.680 --> 3:42:20.040]  population growth for every two people on average they have about 1.2 1.3
[3:42:20.040 --> 3:42:24.840]  1.4 it varies every year but dropping it leaves the same way germany england
[3:42:24.840 --> 3:42:27.640]  if it wasn't for the immigrant populations coming in they wouldn't even
[3:42:27.640 --> 3:42:32.040]  have the numbers to do the basic jobs and the immigrants come in to you know
[3:42:32.040 --> 3:42:35.000]  pay taxes and things to pay for the people that are retiring on their
[3:42:35.000 --> 3:42:37.640]  pensions same thing here with the baby boomers we're starting a retirement this
[3:42:37.640 --> 3:42:41.560]  year well they're talking about 70 80 million people in the next five years
[3:42:41.560 --> 3:42:46.360]  going you know on retirement workers urge to go home and multiply
[3:42:46.360 --> 3:42:51.320]  same things going on in russia they've got a 1.3 population growth in
[3:42:51.320 --> 3:42:54.120]  fact i want to get the exact numbers i haven't looked at them about a year
[3:42:54.120 --> 3:43:00.440]  pull up world population growth numbers and it'll pull up an
[3:43:00.440 --> 3:43:03.480]  encyclopedia online you can see the latest
[3:43:03.480 --> 3:43:06.280]  numbers we'll test this on air and see if my memory serves right i believe
[3:43:06.280 --> 3:43:12.440]  japan's 1.3 but it fluctuates workers urge go home and multiply
[3:43:12.440 --> 3:43:15.880]  even before one reaches the front door of cannons headquarters in tokyo one
[3:43:15.880 --> 3:43:19.400]  can sense the virtual stampede of employees pouring out of the building
[3:43:19.400 --> 3:43:23.000]  exactly 5 30 p.m and it goes on to say they're being told go home
[3:43:23.000 --> 3:43:27.400]  have babies you know they're going to get money they're going to get incentives
[3:43:27.400 --> 3:43:31.240]  oh here it is in the article as i mentioned this earlier they ran i haven't
[3:43:31.240 --> 3:43:34.760]  read this article yet that they ran into me says at 1.34
[3:43:34.760 --> 3:43:39.400]  so at 1.3 as i said it's there in the fifth paragraph
[3:43:39.400 --> 3:43:44.920]  at 1.34 so i said 1.3 a birth rate is well below 2.0 needed to maintain
[3:43:44.920 --> 3:43:46.760]  japan's population according to the country's ministry
[3:43:46.760 --> 3:43:50.760]  of health labor and welfare indigenous americas whether you're hispanic black
[3:43:50.760 --> 3:43:55.240]  white meaning your your grandparents were born here
[3:43:55.240 --> 3:43:59.480]  you're not immigrant families i believe the united states is 1.7
[3:43:59.480 --> 3:44:05.880]  now we're 2.2 uh if you count the 30 plus million
[3:44:05.880 --> 3:44:10.040]  illegal aliens brought in the last decade it's called the death of the west so
[3:44:10.040 --> 3:44:13.640]  there's that now now what is nancy polosi saying
[3:44:13.640 --> 3:44:18.920]  about the united states put that up on screen for folks
[3:44:18.920 --> 3:44:22.280]  speaker of the house nancy polosi boldly defended a move
[3:44:22.280 --> 3:44:25.800]  to add birth control funding to the new economic stimulus package claiming
[3:44:25.800 --> 3:44:29.160]  contraception will reduce cost to the states and the federal government what
[3:44:29.160 --> 3:44:33.560]  do you think the hpv shot is polosi the mother of five children and six grandchildren
[3:44:33.560 --> 3:44:36.840]  who once said nothing in my life will ever ever compare to being a mom and it
[3:44:36.840 --> 3:44:40.760]  doesn't mean appearance is magic seems to imply babies are somehow a burden
[3:44:40.760 --> 3:44:46.760]  to the treasury see america's done for folks we're slated for termination and
[3:44:46.760 --> 3:44:50.280]  and what do you hear ted turner and and all of them saying
[3:44:50.280 --> 3:44:53.720]  same thing fox news i have a clip of an end game saying babies are bad for the
[3:44:53.720 --> 3:44:56.760]  earth or carbon footprint we only have one baby we need a tax on people that
[3:44:56.760 --> 3:45:00.280]  have more than one baby the revelation came during an exchange
[3:45:00.280 --> 3:45:03.320]  sunday morning on abc's this week stefan operas hundreds of millions of
[3:45:03.320 --> 3:45:07.160]  dollars expand family planning services how is that stimulus
[3:45:07.160 --> 3:45:10.920]  that means abortion folks polosi what what did he sign for african china
[3:45:10.920 --> 3:45:15.000]  forced abortion in china that's the liberalism
[3:45:15.000 --> 3:45:18.280]  less black babies well the family planning services reduced cost they
[3:45:18.280 --> 3:45:21.560]  reduced cost the states are in terrible financial budget crisis and part of
[3:45:21.560 --> 3:45:23.880]  what we do for children's health is
[3:45:23.880 --> 3:45:27.160]  education some of those elements are to help the states meet their financial
[3:45:27.160 --> 3:45:30.280]  needs one of those on the initiatives you mentioned
[3:45:30.280 --> 3:45:33.560]  the uh... contraception will reduce cost of the states
[3:45:33.560 --> 3:45:36.760]  and the federal government stefan operas so no apologies for that policy no
[3:45:36.760 --> 3:45:39.720]  apologies no we have to deal with the consequences of the downturn in our
[3:45:39.720 --> 3:45:45.480]  economy development so abortion less baby she says less babies
[3:45:45.480 --> 3:45:49.240]  is good more babies bad abortion good as if we don't need new people on the
[3:45:49.240 --> 3:45:53.880]  workforce to pay for the baby boom after world war two
[3:45:53.880 --> 3:45:56.520]  and sixty to eighty million depending on how you look at the numbers in the next
[3:45:56.520 --> 3:45:59.160]  six to ten years leaving the workforce
[3:45:59.160 --> 3:46:02.760]  they're gonna replace those with third world populations they don't like
[3:46:02.760 --> 3:46:07.880]  america understand that they don't like whites blacks they don't like
[3:46:07.880 --> 3:46:12.680]  indigenous people by indigenous that have been here for hundreds of years
[3:46:12.680 --> 3:46:19.160]  so and it's just everywhere but in japan it's the opposite
[3:46:19.160 --> 3:46:22.680]  now under the communists they had these policies in russia
[3:46:22.680 --> 3:46:28.440]  did you guys find a national international list of
[3:46:28.440 --> 3:46:34.440]  world population growth rates that will find it and i was right it was one
[3:46:34.440 --> 3:46:39.080]  point three this year last year uh... but again i go off these numbers from my
[3:46:39.080 --> 3:46:41.240]  mind there aren't always a hundred percent
[3:46:41.240 --> 3:46:44.280]  that's why you gotta check them and that's why i play this little game on air
[3:46:44.280 --> 3:46:47.640]  where i check what i'm saying because it'd been a couple years since i'd seen
[3:46:47.640 --> 3:46:50.920]  population numbers and i was right that does not mean i'm always right oh you
[3:46:50.920 --> 3:46:55.240]  found them okay uh... let me see the regions
[3:46:55.240 --> 3:46:59.080]  world africa asia europe latin america caribbean north america
[3:46:59.080 --> 3:47:07.080]  oceania that's england and uh... ireland greenland and iceland
[3:47:07.080 --> 3:47:10.440]  this is broken down in different ways i want to see the uh...
[3:47:10.440 --> 3:47:15.880]  now this is population growths here's one
[3:47:15.880 --> 3:47:19.240]  right over here this graph shows europe the united states everybody going down
[3:47:19.240 --> 3:47:24.280]  this is a good one look at europe going way down
[3:47:24.280 --> 3:47:27.720]  uh... england going down and remember there's
[3:47:27.720 --> 3:47:30.280]  immigrants flooding these nations so these are cooked numbers
[3:47:30.280 --> 3:47:34.120]  would actually go way down you know like a rainbow or a hump
[3:47:34.120 --> 3:47:39.880]  asia going way down the world growth rate has gone
[3:47:39.880 --> 3:47:42.760]  the the speed of the growth has gone way down
[3:47:42.760 --> 3:47:45.240]  is going to play off about eight and a half billion all the different studies
[3:47:45.240 --> 3:47:49.880]  show um... i'm still trying to find one that just shows the basic
[3:47:49.880 --> 3:47:55.240]  maybe that's not the term to search what's the term they use it one point
[3:47:55.240 --> 3:48:02.760]  three well below the needed maintain japan's population
[3:48:02.760 --> 3:48:07.240]  that didn't matter you will find those you can pull those up yourself
[3:48:07.240 --> 3:48:10.600]  the point is is that the best places in europe at one point five
[3:48:10.600 --> 3:48:14.600]  some of them one point two one point three same thing in japan
[3:48:14.600 --> 3:48:18.760]  uh... and then people are boarding uh... most the girls in china so they
[3:48:18.760 --> 3:48:22.520]  have hundreds of millions more boys and they tell them in public service

[4:01:46.600 --> 4:01:49.800]  but we teach kids instead of getting strong and coming back or doing better
[4:01:49.800 --> 4:01:52.920]  or that had that was just a much better team

[4:02:46.040 --> 4:02:51.240]  is how criminal how disgusting all right let let's go ahead and talk to
[4:02:51.240 --> 4:02:54.360]  tom in new jersey you're on the air go ahead
[4:02:54.360 --> 4:02:59.720]  mr ellis hi pleasure to speak to you i just wanted to reiterate some of your
[4:02:59.720 --> 4:03:04.040]  points that you've been making um first off uh knowledge is power
[4:03:04.040 --> 4:03:09.560]  um i feel you know we were based on a uh foundation of a nation that was based
[4:03:09.560 --> 4:03:12.920]  on principle and they've turned the shambles into a
[4:03:12.920 --> 4:03:16.920]  a nation that is uh overwhelmed by interest um
[4:03:16.920 --> 4:03:20.600]  i always felt that it's not how much money
[4:03:20.600 --> 4:03:24.360]  that you do make it's how much money you don't have to spend
[4:03:24.360 --> 4:03:31.880]  um the i think the most important thing is the uh
[4:03:31.880 --> 4:03:34.920]  money isn't everything but the value of the money
[4:03:34.920 --> 4:03:41.080]  is very important do you agree well i mean having money is about being
[4:03:41.080 --> 4:03:45.000]  independent not having others control you so it's a good thing in a hierarchy of
[4:03:45.000 --> 4:03:48.200]  needs though uh you shouldn't put money on the
[4:03:48.200 --> 4:03:53.240]  top of your honor your name uh who you are what you build what you stand for
[4:03:53.240 --> 4:03:57.400]  it's way down the hierarchy of needs on top of the pyramid of the hierarchy of
[4:03:57.400 --> 4:04:00.280]  needs number one is being a good person being honorable and
[4:04:00.280 --> 4:04:04.760]  leaving this world and in a better you know situation than you came into it
[4:04:04.760 --> 4:04:10.760]  i definitely understood but my point is that the valuing of our money
[4:04:10.760 --> 4:04:14.120]  is where they're they're stealing our wealth well they're stealing it at every
[4:04:14.120 --> 4:04:17.880]  angle in this controlled parasitic economy but yes they're devaluing it
[4:04:17.880 --> 4:04:23.000]  which is a hidden inflation tax and yeah i mean and punishes people that save
[4:04:23.000 --> 4:04:27.560]  yes we've been under attack in this country in this country since 1930
[4:04:27.560 --> 4:04:33.320]  um and re-emphasized in 1933 when uh Roosevelt took us off the gold standard
[4:04:33.320 --> 4:04:37.560]  and then again in 1976 when Nixon took us off Silver
[4:04:37.560 --> 4:04:41.400]  and ever since then we've been losing most of our wealth
[4:04:41.400 --> 4:04:46.680]  um through the government inflation which actually they're very smart because
[4:04:46.680 --> 4:04:50.760]  the more money that they print the more money that sticks to their fingers
[4:04:50.760 --> 4:04:55.000]  because we have to pay more money back on taxes which i'd like to say
[4:04:55.000 --> 4:04:59.480]  that when you fill out an illegal uh tax return
[4:04:59.480 --> 4:05:03.960]  income tax return um you're filling it out to
[4:05:03.960 --> 4:05:08.280]  to justify how much profit or loss you've made in dollars
[4:05:08.280 --> 4:05:15.240]  um we are stupid enough to fill out um the tax income tax form
[4:05:15.240 --> 4:05:18.760]  but we are paying taxes on what we've
[4:05:18.760 --> 4:05:23.400]  profited or lost yeah we didn't have an income tax till 1913 as you know it's a
[4:05:23.400 --> 4:05:27.000]  fraud i appreciate your call so i'm good to hear from you craig in new york
[4:05:27.000 --> 4:05:31.160]  you're on the air go ahead hi alex uh i was just calling up because i'm a
[4:05:31.160 --> 4:05:34.040]  teacher and you're talking about uh the brainwashing
[4:05:34.040 --> 4:05:38.360]  obama stuff in school uh it's called social reconstructionism you
[4:05:38.360 --> 4:05:41.640]  can't get a teaching degree without learning about it reading
[4:05:41.640 --> 4:05:46.120]  georgia counts shall school build a new social order and nonsense like that and
[4:05:46.120 --> 4:05:49.400]  that's why i now in school kids don't actually learn anything important if
[4:05:49.400 --> 4:05:54.200]  it do group work and play they learn how to work together not stand up not be
[4:05:54.200 --> 4:05:58.280]  individuals be a board and work at the kids that are failing are given
[4:05:58.280 --> 4:06:02.280]  uh better grades they're supposed to it's i forget what the uh thing is called
[4:06:02.280 --> 4:06:05.000]  but you're supposed to give them better grades the kids that work hard
[4:06:05.000 --> 4:06:08.520]  so you're taking away motives and the whole reason why people want to work
[4:06:08.520 --> 4:06:13.160]  hard is for rewards i mean it's going on in the private schools
[4:06:13.160 --> 4:06:16.920]  just as bad as evidence by this people think the private schools in some cases
[4:06:16.920 --> 4:06:20.600]  they're even worse of course because they're going to colleges like teachers
[4:06:20.600 --> 4:06:24.440]  college club university stanford off teachers college and they teach all the
[4:06:24.440 --> 4:06:28.040]  same pedagogy mostly well-meaning people but they've been totally
[4:06:28.040 --> 4:06:30.840]  brainwashed by national uh educational standards
[4:06:30.840 --> 4:06:34.680]  and the educational philosophers have been writing about new world order john
[4:06:34.680 --> 4:06:39.400]  dewey uh... in the nineteen-tenth there was said to have a socialist america but
[4:06:39.400 --> 4:06:43.560]  again not for the people for the bankers to to knock out the middle class where
[4:06:43.560 --> 4:06:46.360]  nobody can ever resist them where everybody's poor but the elite or
[4:06:46.360 --> 4:06:50.120]  international above us where nobody can be individual nobody can do better than
[4:06:50.120 --> 4:06:54.120]  anybody else and then it just holds back everybody including the students
[4:06:54.120 --> 4:06:58.120]  that you know may not uh excel at at at calculus
[4:06:58.120 --> 4:07:02.120]  or an engineering you know that that are supposed to
[4:07:02.120 --> 4:07:06.520]  go out and and you know be an entrepreneur or uh play sports or
[4:07:06.520 --> 4:07:11.000]  you know do something else well they think that's progress they think they
[4:07:11.000 --> 4:07:13.960]  know what's better for people these are the same
[4:07:13.960 --> 4:07:17.400]  people that are behind social control years ago during the progressive era
[4:07:17.400 --> 4:07:20.760]  that we are dumb they should use euthanetics not eugenics euthanetics
[4:07:20.760 --> 4:07:23.320]  where you brainwash people to make them better and control what they do because
[4:07:23.320 --> 4:07:28.120]  they can't run their own lives thanks for the call
[4:07:28.120 --> 4:07:33.800]  um... let's go ahead and talk to nate in maynate you're on the air
[4:07:33.800 --> 4:07:37.880]  hi alex uh... i woke up this morning i heard i haven't got all the specifics on
[4:07:37.880 --> 4:07:41.240]  it yet but over here in uh... lewiston main
[4:07:41.240 --> 4:07:45.640]  uh... there was a scuffle between a young man and a cop
[4:07:45.640 --> 4:07:49.240]  and uh... from what i heard he was just running away uh... he didn't have any
[4:07:49.240 --> 4:07:53.000]  weapons it was just a hand-to-hand physical scuffle and he's running through
[4:07:53.000 --> 4:07:57.080]  the woods and he gets shot three times in the back
[4:07:57.080 --> 4:08:02.680]  and once in the head killed dead and uh... now they're talking about having a
[4:08:02.680 --> 4:08:07.240]  uh... a citizen watch to evaluate what happens when the
[4:08:07.240 --> 4:08:11.880]  police gets shot in main it's a it's a mess
[4:08:11.880 --> 4:08:15.000]  and then every time the citizens combine forces now to try to
[4:08:15.000 --> 4:08:18.600]  take back their government have justice the obama knowledge the
[4:08:18.600 --> 4:08:23.400]  the counterfeit of a true grassroot grassroot movement will will be employed
[4:08:23.400 --> 4:08:27.560]  yep and uh...
[4:08:27.560 --> 4:08:31.160]  i don't have uh... limited time so i just want to leave it that and say that to
[4:08:31.160 --> 4:08:33.720]  the new world order god bless you my friend
[4:08:33.720 --> 4:08:37.160]  one last caller nick in north carolina nick you're on the air
[4:08:37.160 --> 4:08:41.400]  hey i could talk to you again um... i was watching c-span late last night and i
[4:08:41.400 --> 4:08:45.240]  saw a guy on there that you might want to talk to although he could be a neocon
[4:08:45.240 --> 4:08:49.160]  uh... this guy peter wallison from the american enterprise enter to institute
[4:08:49.160 --> 4:08:52.920]  the conservative think tank um... was up there talking about the most
[4:08:52.920 --> 4:08:57.320]  pernicious uh... plot here going around which was to uh... have a regulator for
[4:08:57.320 --> 4:09:01.080]  will quote systematically significant uh... institutions
[4:09:01.080 --> 4:09:04.200]  and i he basically said that this was just a plot to uh... get regulation over
[4:09:04.200 --> 4:09:07.480]  as many banks and uh... companies as part of that that's what's happening
[4:09:07.480 --> 4:09:10.520]  the the the upper crust of the elite banks that control the issuance of
[4:09:10.520 --> 4:09:13.080]  currency they're not even banks their crime syndicates
[4:09:13.080 --> 4:09:16.440]  are taking over banks insurance companies uh... industry
[4:09:16.440 --> 4:09:19.320]  there uh... they're gonna have a world government run by the banks that
[4:09:19.320 --> 4:09:22.520]  regulates everything including our taxing system everything
[4:09:22.520 --> 4:09:25.480]  that's what the i'm at the world bank in the international bank of settlements
[4:09:25.480 --> 4:09:29.480]  due to third world countries they go in and bankrupt they take them over
[4:09:29.480 --> 4:09:32.440]  so that our government you put in it's the same policies
[4:09:32.440 --> 4:09:35.640]  same thing with iceland they've just kicked out their government after
[4:09:35.640 --> 4:09:39.800]  you know a month and a half of rioting overnight they went from one of the
[4:09:39.800 --> 4:09:43.160]  wealthiest nations in the world i mean they were either with switzerland
[4:09:43.160 --> 4:09:46.280]  this was hard to tell it was number one you know what was it iceland or was it
[4:09:46.280 --> 4:09:50.360]  switzerland and overnight because the banks came in and bought off their
[4:09:50.360 --> 4:09:52.840]  government and did these derivatives scams they're told your bank accounts
[4:09:52.840 --> 4:09:56.280]  are empty everything's you know done there's no credit to bring food into
[4:09:56.280 --> 4:09:58.920]  the country everything's bankrupt
[4:09:58.920 --> 4:10:02.760]  uh... and uh... so now they go and remove the government that happens in
[4:10:02.760 --> 4:10:05.560]  third world nations that's happened in argentina and brazil
[4:10:05.560 --> 4:10:08.920]  they'll just put president after prime minister after president after leader
[4:10:08.920 --> 4:10:12.760]  in these countries who signed corporate agreements that nobody's talking about
[4:10:12.760 --> 4:10:15.960]  with the offshore banks and then gordon brown a month ago
[4:10:15.960 --> 4:10:19.960]  when the icelanders were trying to go to england to to get their money out of
[4:10:19.960 --> 4:10:22.280]  british banks because the british really own iceland
[4:10:22.280 --> 4:10:25.800]  gordon brown used a terrorism law to block
[4:10:25.800 --> 4:10:28.920]  hundreds of thousands of icelanders you can pull this up financial times of
[4:10:28.920 --> 4:10:33.160]  london in fact google that uh... gordon brown uses terror law
[4:10:33.160 --> 4:10:39.080]  uh... against icelanders okay and then they use their british patriot act to
[4:10:39.080 --> 4:10:42.040]  say you can't have your money
[4:10:42.040 --> 4:10:45.880]  you understand that the the level of the heist we're talking about
[4:10:45.880 --> 4:10:49.000]  this whole anti-terrorism thing is for us
[4:10:49.000 --> 4:10:51.240]  all these stupid yuppies i think they're part of the system
[4:10:51.240 --> 4:10:54.440]  you didn't for all kind of boys it's for you
[4:10:54.440 --> 4:10:57.480]  go ahead you know you know where you said this uh... was all coming from you'll
[4:10:57.480 --> 4:10:58.120]  love this
[4:10:58.120 --> 4:11:01.560]  uh... said all all these plots are coming from the group of thirty
[4:11:01.560 --> 4:11:05.800]  surely no surprise to you so they had peter
[4:11:05.800 --> 4:11:10.840]  wallinson yeah w a l l i s o n
[4:11:10.840 --> 4:11:14.520]  and and he's with uh... american enterprise institute looks like they're
[4:11:14.520 --> 4:11:17.640]  all over the bush administration of the dubious but
[4:11:17.640 --> 4:11:20.600]  he was talking straight up it was there was no joke
[4:11:20.600 --> 4:11:24.440]  well so he's so they've even got neocons
[4:11:24.440 --> 4:11:28.760]  peter wallinson the american enterprise institute folks write that down i
[4:11:28.760 --> 4:11:32.840]  want to have uh... erin get him on and he was coming he was coming right out
[4:11:32.840 --> 4:11:36.040]  admitting he was against it he said he called it the most
[4:11:36.040 --> 4:11:38.680]  pernicious idea he heard going around said
[4:11:38.680 --> 4:11:43.240]  he said um... they wanted to regulate systematically significant institutions
[4:11:43.240 --> 4:11:46.440]  and that this was just used to basically regulate everything they said
[4:11:46.440 --> 4:11:49.640]  separate from him you know we hear everything screwed up we didn't have
[4:11:49.640 --> 4:11:51.880]  enough regulation when they had tons of regulations
[4:11:51.880 --> 4:11:54.920]  the very banks that engineered this are now saying
[4:11:54.920 --> 4:11:58.040]  they're going to control industry when you hear nationalization of ford or
[4:11:58.040 --> 4:11:58.680]  chevy
[4:11:58.680 --> 4:12:02.680]  no gm when you hear nationalization of your of your cities
[4:12:02.680 --> 4:12:05.880]  that just means under the imf world bank plan
[4:12:05.880 --> 4:12:10.040]  that they force the cities and states to sign on to a hundred plus part imf
[4:12:10.040 --> 4:12:11.160]  world bank plan
[4:12:11.160 --> 4:12:12.360]  this is in my book
[4:12:12.360 --> 4:12:16.680]  uh... uh... uh... the senate airing they have said they're going to force us in
[4:12:16.680 --> 4:12:19.400]  the next eight years to do this well here we are seven years
[4:12:19.400 --> 4:12:21.960]  yeah six years later

[4:12:51.000 --> 4:12:54.280]  intelligent men to bear witness that if this plan were consummated
[4:12:54.280 --> 4:12:57.720]  great employers and capitalists of the country would be under a more overpowering
[4:12:57.720 --> 4:12:59.000]  compassion than ever
[4:12:59.000 --> 4:13:00.960]  to take control of the government and keep it
[4:13:00.960 --> 4:13:02.520]  subservient to their purpose
[4:13:02.520 --> 4:13:05.880]  what a prize would be to capture how unassailable would be the majesty of the
[4:13:05.880 --> 4:13:07.320]  tyranny of monopoly
