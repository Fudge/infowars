[00:00.000 --> 00:12.960]  It's game time, Tuesday, October 6th, the year 2020, 27 days out, and Trump is taking
[00:12.960 --> 00:17.880]  on the COVID fear machine like never before, we salute him.
[00:17.880 --> 00:23.240]  But first, Joe Biden is drooling over little girls in public, can't wait until they're
[00:23.240 --> 00:24.240]  18.
[00:24.240 --> 00:45.680]  That ties into John Bowne's new report, how the files want to rule you.
[00:45.680 --> 01:00.640]  I've just been attacked by people claiming they're the Q leaders when I know I'm the
[01:00.640 --> 01:17.880]  Q leader.
[01:17.880 --> 01:25.880]  Look, the governor hasn't had a chance to talk, he's been up here ten minutes, and he hasn't had a chance to talk for about four minutes.
[01:31.880 --> 01:35.880]  Some of you don't like to hear it, ladies and gentlemen, but it's the truth.
[01:35.880 --> 01:47.880]  I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.
[02:06.880 --> 02:16.880]  Now it maintains that President Trump is leading a war against liberal elites who, according to QAnon, are running a global sex trafficking network, including some very famous people.
[02:16.880 --> 02:32.880]  Now there is zero evidence, zero, that any of this is true.
[02:46.880 --> 02:51.880]  She claimed that she had to report back with details relating to blackmail.
[02:51.880 --> 03:05.880]  Jifre also revealed how Epstein's Madame Ghislaine Maxwell pimped Jifre out to powerful names for erotic massages in sex, which included modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel and wealthy financer Glenn Dubin.
[03:05.880 --> 03:14.880]  Nine people have been arrested in Thailand, Australia and the US, and 50 children were rescued after an investigation into an international pedophile ring.
[03:14.880 --> 03:20.880]  Brazilian police claimed to have arrested more than 100 people who were accused of being part of a massive pedophile ring.
[03:20.880 --> 03:27.880]  The nationwide operation saw people held in 24 of the country's 26 states and in the capital, Brasilia.
[03:27.880 --> 03:31.880]  Elijah Woods' shocking allegations against the entertainment industry.
[03:31.880 --> 03:39.880]  In a new interview with The Sunday Times, the former child star alleges that pedophilia has been a real issue in Hollywood.
[03:39.880 --> 03:46.880]  He tells the publication, quote, there are a lot of vipers in this industry, people who only have their own interests in mind.
[03:46.880 --> 03:51.880]  What bums me about these situations is that the victims can't speak as loudly as the people in power.
[03:51.880 --> 03:58.880]  And the L.A. County Sheriff and other law enforcement leaders just revealing details of an operation carried out last week.
[03:58.880 --> 04:06.880]  It was a statewide, coordinated crackdown on human traffickers, the specific one-week operation resulting in more than 500 arrests.
[04:06.880 --> 04:12.880]  You've all heard money laundering, drug dealing, art is the secret currency of the elites, the magnets.
[04:12.880 --> 04:20.880]  But really what it is is sex trafficking and pedophilia because when somebody engages in that, the devil knows he's got them.
[04:20.880 --> 04:28.880]  And so that's why this just keeps popping up and popping up and popping up and popping up.
[04:28.880 --> 04:31.880]  That's all this is. What about raping babies, ladies and gentlemen?
[04:31.880 --> 04:41.880]  I have stacks of articles today of people busted, mothers, fathers, church deacons, you name it, Islamic groups are huge into it.
[04:41.880 --> 04:44.880]  Running sex rings of kidnapped little kids.
[04:44.880 --> 05:11.880]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci and I've been at the NIH at CDC for 45 years. I've overseen well, you know the AIDS pandemic and so many other things.
[05:11.880 --> 05:20.880]  And I take my orders from Bill Gates, Dr. Bill Gates. I mean, he's not a doctor, but he controls everything you do.
[05:20.880 --> 05:30.880]  And he now says you're going to take the shots. And of course in England they are now saying what I told you, you will not be allowed to travel.
[05:30.880 --> 05:49.880]  Leave your home until you take all the shots. Dr. Gates, I mean Bill Gates, your owner, your master says you will have to take four to five COVID shots a year for adult, two for baby, baby, much more manageable.
[05:49.880 --> 05:58.880]  Just like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine, I'm Dr. Fauci reminding you that we owe you.
[06:20.880 --> 06:26.880]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:26.880 --> 06:37.880]  27 days to the election, but that's just the start in the 79 days of insanity. 79 days of America fighting for its life.
[06:37.880 --> 06:45.880]  Welcome and thank you for joining us today. Let me tell you what we got coming up. We got Mark Dice, hard to get on air.
[06:45.880 --> 06:52.880]  He does a great job live on air. He doesn't think he does a great job, but he comes on this show. I think the only live show he goes on, he's on the Fox News and stuff.
[06:52.880 --> 07:02.880]  He's starting to do his own talk show. I'm really glad he's doing it. He's got a new book out that we're not going to announce until he is on air with us, that he's launching today.
[07:02.880 --> 07:11.880]  A lot of big things happening. We also have Jay Dyer coming on and we have a guy that broke a big story.
[07:11.880 --> 07:21.880]  David Knight. Yesterday afternoon, I was surfing around on YouTube and I saw like 100,000 views and David Knight in just a few hours and I said, what is that?
[07:21.880 --> 07:27.880]  And it's, wow, the Federal Reserve is going to get rid of cash? Someone watched the video and sure enough, it was true.
[07:27.880 --> 07:37.880]  Went back to find the video this morning on YouTube. It was gone, but you know what? I could go to band.video and I could find it. I could find it right there.
[07:37.880 --> 07:44.880]  But the Federal Reserve under COVID has begun the end of cash. You notice you can't get coins anymore either.
[07:44.880 --> 07:51.880]  So he's going to be in studio with us. We're tied all into the COVID madness and juxtapose all of this. Here's President Trump.
[07:51.880 --> 08:01.880]  When he got off Marine One, walked away and then took his mask off and saluted the helicopter. Go ahead and roll that footage.
[08:01.880 --> 08:14.880]  And he's being attacked for standing on a balcony with a mask off. Talk about a cult. Now, here's what Trump had to say about, don't fear the virus.
[08:14.880 --> 08:25.880]  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. And of course, that absolutely made the left incredibly upset because they want to use this as the straight jacket.
[08:25.880 --> 08:37.880]  They want to use this as the pretext for their social credit score tracking, the tracking apps, and all the rest of it. And now it's all official.
[08:37.880 --> 08:49.880]  Now it's all official that that is the model. Let's go ahead and play the club of Trump saying, don't be afraid of coronavirus leaving hospital or turning to the White House.
[08:49.880 --> 09:02.880]  I just left Walter Reed Medical Center, and it's really something very special. The doctors, the nurses, the first responders, and I learned so much about coronavirus.
[09:02.880 --> 09:12.880]  And one thing that's for certain, don't let it dominate you. Don't be afraid of it. You're going to beat it. We have the best medical equipment.
[09:12.880 --> 09:25.880]  We have the best medicines all developed recently. And you're going to beat it. I went. I didn't feel so good. And two days ago, I could have left two days ago, two days ago, I felt great, like better than I have in a long time.
[09:25.880 --> 09:35.880]  I said just recently, better than 20 years ago, don't let it dominate. Don't let it take over your lives. Don't let that happen. We have the greatest country in the world.
[09:35.880 --> 09:43.880]  We're going back. We're going back to work. We're going to be out front. As your leader, I had to do that. I knew there's danger to it, but I had to do it.
[09:43.880 --> 09:53.880]  I stood out front. I led. Nobody that's a leader would not do what I did. And I know there's a risk. There's a danger, but that's okay.
[09:53.880 --> 10:01.880]  And now I'm better, and maybe I'm immune. I don't know. But don't let it dominate your lives. Get out there. Be careful.
[10:01.880 --> 10:10.880]  We have the best medicines in the world, and it all happened very shortly, and they're all getting approved. And the vaccines are coming momentarily.
[10:10.880 --> 10:17.880]  Thank you very much. And Walter Reed, what a group of people. Thank you very much.
[10:17.880 --> 10:23.880]  They want to bring the vaccines in another year and a half and make you take them once all the contact tracing and tracker apps are there.
[10:23.880 --> 10:32.880]  Trump's preempting. I'm saying if you're old, if you want it, go ahead and get it knowing it takes the power away and kills their program of when they want to launch it.
[10:32.880 --> 10:46.880]  Just like Owen said on Friday evening on his show, he was hosting the war room. He said, if Trump leaves in two or three days and says we defeated the virus, you know he used this to destroy the whole Bill Gates
[10:46.880 --> 10:54.880]  Combine. If he stays in there and keeps milking it, we know he's fallen to the enemy. He did exactly what Owen predicted he'd do.
[10:54.880 --> 11:03.880]  Trump is so damn real. And he absolutely just judo moved them. Did he probably have a cold? He probably had a COVID virus? Absolutely.
[11:03.880 --> 11:17.880]  But now they're saying that we can't ever go outside even once we have vaccines without mask. This is a cult takeover. This is absolute domination.
[11:17.880 --> 11:23.880]  And the former head of Health and Human Services that Trump has got rid of is a total Bill Gates quack. He's been doing the rounds.
[11:23.880 --> 11:35.880]  I'll play a clip in a moment saying that it never ends. You never stop the lockdowns. You never take the mask off and you've got to take the vaccine. See this power grab. He said we must eradicate it with there is no virus on earth.
[11:35.880 --> 11:44.880]  It's that cold virus that they've monkey with so that all the tests show you have it when you don't because it tests positive for regular Corona.
[11:44.880 --> 11:53.880]  They'll never get rid of the common cold. It's part of everything. They know that they've made an impossible bar because they're never going to let us get out of this.
[11:53.880 --> 12:03.880]  And it's about fetishizing, creating hypochondria, creating neuroses, giving everyone agoraphobia to go in and never leave their houses and then robots bring us our food.
[12:03.880 --> 12:15.880]  But that's just one level. Once they've got us obsolete, once they've gotten us to opt in to being obsolete, the driverless cars and all the rest of it, the drones, they're going to wipe us out with real bio weapons.
[12:15.880 --> 12:30.880]  That's the stated UN globalist plan I made a film 13 years ago called in game blueprint for global enslavement where I see exactly what they do because we had documents then.
[12:30.880 --> 12:40.880]  Three years later, they put out operation lockstep saying we're going to set up an authoritarian planetary police state. These are quotes for your own good.
[12:40.880 --> 12:48.880]  And you'll have apps to leave your house on your smartphones. They even called it that and you'll have no freedom.
[12:48.880 --> 12:55.880]  And they go on to say humanity is obsolete.
[12:55.880 --> 13:00.880]  Think about that. Think about that long thing about that hard.
[13:00.880 --> 13:12.880]  So here is doctor price on Fox, even after coronavirus vaccine will need mask and lockdowns. I mean, it's a five minute club. I'm just going to play 30 seconds.
[13:12.880 --> 13:13.880]  But here it is.
[13:13.880 --> 13:23.880]  And but it's important to to again, this is going to continue to be the challenge that we have as a nation, even when we get a vaccine.
[13:23.880 --> 13:39.880]  We're going to have to continue to be cautious in the activities that we're doing, continue the mitigation efforts of so physically distancing and hand washing and mask wearing until the virus has moved through our society and has moved on or has gone away.
[13:39.880 --> 13:44.880]  And it will at some point, but it certainly isn't at this point.
[13:44.880 --> 13:53.880]  Okay, so I'll explain this again. This is a UN plan with the big pharma controlled by the big banks to have medical tyranny to put in your body what they want.
[13:53.880 --> 14:02.880]  Bill Gates has been positioned by the robber barons by IBM, by all of them that are behind him as mother was on the board to carry out the dreams of Thomas Watson and Adolf Hitler.
[14:02.880 --> 14:05.880]  You can't make this up. It's all mainstream news.
[14:05.880 --> 14:16.880]  It's just all hiding in plain view to be able to get in your body what they want when they want, including an M RNA vaccine that changes your DNA and makes you a GMO product.
[14:16.880 --> 14:25.880]  And now, if you go to Spain or you go to Australia, they have apps on everybody's phones. If you don't have the app, you're arrested.
[14:25.880 --> 14:38.880]  But a woman in Australia, she had her papers because she hadn't got an app yet. They arrested her for being outside without her papers swimming with her children at the beach, but they didn't have the papers.
[14:38.880 --> 14:45.880]  We're going to come back from break with David Knight and we're going to play this. Let's go ahead and start playing it now.
[14:45.880 --> 15:05.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we don't have to wait to be Australia. In Michigan, in California, in New Jersey, in New York, you're not allowed to leave the campus.
[15:05.880 --> 15:11.880]  Again, five square miles is always the rule. Even if the campus is smaller or bigger, that's the first app level.
[15:11.880 --> 15:17.880]  And then they just keep tightening it down. Oh, you can't go in your backyard now and people are fetishizing this.
[15:17.880 --> 15:24.880]  And now they're announcing cameras in the stores that shout orders if you take your mask off. They face scan you when you go in.
[15:24.880 --> 15:29.880]  And they said, oh, this will be for cashless society soon. Even after COVID, you'll have to be face scan to go in a store.
[15:29.880 --> 15:40.880]  This is the rollout of their whole plan. I'll never forget there was an event 20 plus years ago here in Austin and the guy that ran it was called Texas Best Seminars.
[15:40.880 --> 15:49.880]  I only went to it six or seven times. I go give speeches there. And he was like a lay preacher. He talked about this preacher he knew in Texas that had a vision.
[15:49.880 --> 15:56.880]  And I'll tell you what that vision was when we come back. Stay with us.
[15:56.880 --> 16:05.880]  The planets have aligned globally. They've aligned nationally. They've aligned financially, culturally, but most importantly, spiritually.
[16:05.880 --> 16:12.880]  We are living at a point in human development that will decide the entire future destiny of our species.
[16:12.880 --> 16:22.880]  And that's why big tech control with the very dark forces of the globalist is trying to dumb us down, isolate us, make us depressed, make us alone,
[16:22.880 --> 16:30.880]  and traffic control every aspect of our lives, literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they put forward because they do not want us to take our birthright,
[16:30.880 --> 16:36.880]  not just of Americana, but of true Christendom and the Renaissance and the Enlightened.
[16:36.880 --> 16:41.880]  They are trying to create the new dark age where they have all the high technology and life extension.
[16:41.880 --> 16:48.880]  And we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon credits and through a social credit score.
[16:48.880 --> 16:56.880]  This is their plan. We must come together and awaken out of our trance and say no, we must embrace God.
[16:56.880 --> 17:05.880]  The Bible talks about there being ten kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and who give their power unto the one world leader,
[17:05.880 --> 17:13.880]  the Antichrist, and that he has a beast system that no one can find or sell unless he has that mark in the forehead or in the palm of their hand.
[17:13.880 --> 17:21.880]  And we look back on all the warnings you were given and all just the common sense that you don't believe in God.
[17:21.880 --> 17:29.880]  We're prophecy, giving governments and corporations the power to control who can buy and who can sell to track everything we do.
[17:29.880 --> 17:33.880]  It's not just a recipe, it's a blueprint for total enslavement.
[17:33.880 --> 17:37.880]  And now you look at Bill Gates, you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say,
[17:37.880 --> 17:43.880]  we're technocrats, we should decide how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get, how much red meat you get.
[17:43.880 --> 17:48.880]  We're technocrats, we know best, and we're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control you.
[17:48.880 --> 17:55.880]  You snap your fingers, we're here. They're just rolling it out. And a lot of people are complying with it. It's insane.
[17:55.880 --> 18:02.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:16.880 --> 18:21.880]  I just left Walter Reed Medical Center, and it's really something very special.
[18:21.880 --> 18:28.880]  The doctors, the nurses, the first responders, and I learned so much about coronavirus.
[18:28.880 --> 18:35.880]  And one thing that's for certain, don't let it dominate you. Don't be afraid of it.
[18:35.880 --> 18:42.880]  You're going to beat it. We have the best medical equipment, we have the best medicines, all developed recently.
[18:42.880 --> 18:45.880]  And you're going to beat it. I went, I didn't feel so good.
[18:45.880 --> 18:51.880]  And two days ago, I could have left two days ago. Two days ago, I felt great, like better than I have in a long time.
[18:51.880 --> 18:58.880]  I said just recently, better than 20 years ago, don't let it dominate. Don't let it take over your lives.
[18:58.880 --> 19:04.880]  Don't let that happen. We have the greatest country in the world. We're going back. We're going back to work.
[19:04.880 --> 19:09.880]  We're going to be out front. As your leader, I had to do that. I knew there's danger to it, but I had to do it.
[19:09.880 --> 19:16.880]  I stood out front, I led. Nobody that's a leader would not do what I did.
[19:16.880 --> 19:23.880]  And I know there's a risk, there's a danger, but that's okay. And now I'm better, and maybe I'm immune. I don't know.
[19:23.880 --> 19:30.880]  But don't let it dominate your lives. Get out there, be careful. We have the best medicines in the world.
[19:30.880 --> 19:37.880]  And it all happened very shortly, and they're all getting approved. And the vaccines are coming momentarily.
[19:37.880 --> 19:45.880]  Thank you very much. And Walter Reed, what a group of people. Thank you very much.
[19:45.880 --> 19:53.880]  The answer to the fear-mongers is standing up and having courage. It's just that simple.
[19:53.880 --> 19:58.880]  What does Franklin Delano Roosevelt tell us? A classic American liberal?
[19:58.880 --> 20:06.880]  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. And instead of being scared of Hitler and Tojo, we kicked their ass.
[20:06.880 --> 20:12.880]  Hitler thought of heat-bombed England and civilian targets that the Brits would become anti-war.
[20:12.880 --> 20:22.880]  They've been anti-war already. But the polls flipped from 90% against war to 99% for war when Hitler thought fear would make them bow.
[20:22.880 --> 20:30.880]  But maybe the globalists are right. Maybe Americans in the West are cowards, and we want to buy into the permanent lockdown
[20:30.880 --> 20:38.880]  because the Democrats are calling for permanent mask, permanent shutdown, permanent forced inoculations, and still you can't travel without an app
[20:38.880 --> 20:43.880]  allowing you to. And now, first they're giving people papers. Now they're forcing apps in the UK and Australia.
[20:43.880 --> 20:48.880]  They're the model that's coming here. Universities in the US are doing this. Oh, you don't have your paperwork.
[20:48.880 --> 20:54.880]  You're outside the five miles you're allowed to travel now. What's to the beach in Australia?
[20:54.880 --> 20:57.880]  So they arrest her in front of her children. Here's the footage.
[20:57.880 --> 21:12.880]  The full, un-bleat videos at M4Words.com and News.com.
[21:12.880 --> 21:18.880]  They explain to her, you are not allowed to leave without an app or a piece of paper.
[21:18.880 --> 21:22.880]  Your piece of paper says you're outside your five kilometers. Excuse me, not miles.
[21:22.880 --> 21:29.880]  It's like five kilometers, three and a half miles. And the campuses here in the US also say the same thing.
[21:29.880 --> 21:33.880]  And they go and explain here in front of her children how they're doing it.
[21:33.880 --> 21:38.880]  David Knight, host of the David Knight Show weekday mornings, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. right before I come on.
[21:38.880 --> 21:42.880]  You've broken a big story that's one of the biggest developments shed in COVID.
[21:42.880 --> 21:46.880]  We'll get to that next segment. The Federal Reserve quietly announces the banks.
[21:46.880 --> 21:51.880]  I made some calls this morning and confirmed this. He has the documents exclusive thanks to Listers.
[21:51.880 --> 21:55.880]  You're telling them you're not able to get cash out this Christmas and no more cash.
[21:55.880 --> 22:00.880]  They're getting rid of the coin money as well. People noticed that. So it's on, folks.
[22:00.880 --> 22:03.880]  We're in a lot of trouble. President Trump needs to stop this as well.
[22:03.880 --> 22:11.880]  But David, we don't have to wait a few years for them to roll out the drones, face-carrying to go in grocery stores, contact tracers,
[22:11.880 --> 22:14.880]  kids being taken out of their homes. It's here.
[22:14.880 --> 22:19.880]  Yeah, you know, Alex, you just said, talking about FDR, you say we have nothing to fear but fear itself.
[22:19.880 --> 22:24.880]  You know, the famous slogan that people have turned into t-shirts and everything else is what Winston Churchill said,
[22:24.880 --> 22:28.880]  what they put up in terms of posters in the U.K. at that time.
[22:28.880 --> 22:32.880]  They said, keep calm and carry on. But they also put up another poster.
[22:32.880 --> 22:37.880]  And I talked about both of these back on March 17th as we were entering lockdown. We're now 240.
[22:37.880 --> 22:39.880]  That video was on Band-Aid video you reared it yesterday.
[22:39.880 --> 22:40.880]  Yeah.
[22:40.880 --> 22:43.880]  You said, what, 200 plus days ago, I warned you, and now it's come true.
[22:43.880 --> 22:47.880]  That's right. But I mean, in terms of keeping, you know, calm, right?
[22:47.880 --> 22:50.880]  They also said, they had that sign, keep calm and carry on.
[22:50.880 --> 22:55.880]  Then they said, freedom is in peril. Defend it with all of your might.
[22:55.880 --> 23:01.880]  Their response to being attacked by the Germans was not to go hide in their rooms.
[23:01.880 --> 23:04.880]  They confronted this, and we have to confront this.
[23:04.880 --> 23:09.880]  And I talked this morning to Pastor Tony Spell out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
[23:09.880 --> 23:12.880]  He hasn't stopped a single church service, Alex.
[23:12.880 --> 23:17.880]  1,500 people. He said, the average is about 900 a week through this period of time.
[23:17.880 --> 23:21.880]  And so they've arrested him. They put him under, they threw him in jail.
[23:21.880 --> 23:23.880]  Then they released him and put him under house arrest.
[23:23.880 --> 23:27.880]  They threw him out of the courthouse when his trial came up because he wouldn't wear a mask.
[23:27.880 --> 23:28.880]  They're coming after him.
[23:28.880 --> 23:31.880]  But let me guess, I bet his church is stronger and bigger than ever.
[23:31.880 --> 23:32.880]  Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
[23:32.880 --> 23:35.880]  Well, let's expand on that. I was talking to my wife about civil disobedience.
[23:35.880 --> 23:40.880]  And I said, they already put the facecanners in the grocery stores and in the shops.
[23:40.880 --> 23:42.880]  And you say, well, that's a private company.
[23:42.880 --> 23:44.880]  But then they're going to pass regulations that every store has to have it.
[23:44.880 --> 23:47.880]  Then your house has to have it. That's what the home assistants are about.
[23:47.880 --> 23:48.880]  They now admit this.
[23:48.880 --> 23:52.880]  So we have a responsibility when shops put these in to go smash this stuff.
[23:52.880 --> 23:54.880]  Because this isn't free market.
[23:54.880 --> 23:57.880]  These are organized cartels run by Communist China and Big Tech,
[23:57.880 --> 24:00.880]  literally putting a police state martial law grid in place.
[24:00.880 --> 24:02.880]  And they admit they're doing it.
[24:02.880 --> 24:04.880]  And so I've never been an offensive person.
[24:04.880 --> 24:07.880]  But now, coming with force inoculations, putting up robot control grids,
[24:07.880 --> 24:11.880]  no, it's time folks to fight hard in the info war.
[24:11.880 --> 24:13.880]  And to start thinking about nonviolent civil disobedience.
[24:13.880 --> 24:15.880]  And I'm talking about killing robots.
[24:15.880 --> 24:16.880]  Yeah.
[24:16.880 --> 24:24.880]  And, you know, this is a pattern, Alex, that really goes back to the banning of info wars and everybody on social media two years ago.
[24:24.880 --> 24:27.880]  I had seen this even before that, back in the early nineties,
[24:27.880 --> 24:29.880]  when we were trying to get into debates as third party,
[24:29.880 --> 24:31.880]  we would go through all these extra hoops to get on the ballot.
[24:31.880 --> 24:36.880]  And then they would say, well, you can't go to the debate because we've got a private organization that's going to determine who gets to go to the debate.
[24:36.880 --> 24:38.880]  That's the same thing that they pulled.
[24:38.880 --> 24:42.880]  And now Google buys up the town square and you don't have speech there because they own it. Exactly.
[24:42.880 --> 24:43.880]  Exactly.
[24:43.880 --> 24:45.880]  They are buying everything and then operating as governments.
[24:45.880 --> 24:52.880]  And when they, when they purged us two years ago, I said, first of all, I said, understand, this is not about the companies deciding this on their own.
[24:52.880 --> 24:59.880]  They're being used to the velvet glove of an iron fist of censorship that's really coming from the government itself.
[24:59.880 --> 25:00.880]  And David, I totally agree.
[25:00.880 --> 25:03.880]  And at the time you and I were concurred, we said, we're not worried.
[25:03.880 --> 25:08.880]  We've got to stay on air because we said within two to three years, it'll be ubiquitous.
[25:08.880 --> 25:09.880]  Everybody will get it.
[25:09.880 --> 25:16.880]  We've got to stay on air because we'll become more effective, more pertinent, more avant-garde as we're proven right.
[25:16.880 --> 25:17.880]  And that's not happened.
[25:17.880 --> 25:18.880]  That's right.
[25:18.880 --> 25:26.880]  And part of this plan was to give Google control over these cities, the cyberspace, the sidewalk labs that Google's got.
[25:26.880 --> 25:28.880]  With 5G controlling driverless vehicles.
[25:28.880 --> 25:29.880]  Exactly.
[25:29.880 --> 25:36.880]  And now part of this is to confine you right now to get you accustomed to this, what they're going to have in place.
[25:36.880 --> 25:39.880]  Their plan is to have this in place fully by 2030.
[25:39.880 --> 25:44.880]  So to get you accustomed to this, they're already putting you under these same regulations, confining you to your own.
[25:44.880 --> 25:45.880]  And they admit that.
[25:45.880 --> 25:46.880]  They go, oh, it's COVID.
[25:46.880 --> 25:50.880]  No, this is the fourth industrial revolution in their own words.
[25:50.880 --> 25:52.880]  And by the way, humans aren't in it.
[25:52.880 --> 25:53.880]  Yeah.
[25:53.880 --> 25:57.880]  And it's a post-human algorithm where they save the earth by getting rid of humans.
[25:57.880 --> 25:58.880]  That's Wall Street Journal.
[25:58.880 --> 25:59.880]  That's NBC News.
[25:59.880 --> 26:01.880]  This is really what the cult's doing.
[26:01.880 --> 26:02.880]  That's right.
[26:02.880 --> 26:04.880]  We need to reject everything they're pushing, not just piecemeal.
[26:04.880 --> 26:05.880]  Well, I'm a hero.
[26:05.880 --> 26:06.880]  I'm wearing a mask.
[26:06.880 --> 26:07.880]  No, you're not.
[26:07.880 --> 26:08.880]  You're helping kill the third world.
[26:08.880 --> 26:09.880]  It's not just the fourth industrial revolution.
[26:09.880 --> 26:11.880]  It's also the fourth turning.
[26:11.880 --> 26:14.880]  I've talked many times about the book, Strauss and Howe, the people who coined the terms millennial.
[26:14.880 --> 26:18.880]  They point out that about every 80 years, you have a major restructuring of society.
[26:18.880 --> 26:25.880]  In the past, the most recent fourth turning we've had, every four generations, about 20 years apart, you have a major restructuring of society.
[26:25.880 --> 26:29.880]  That's when we had Great Depression World War, part of that civil war, part of that American Revolution.
[26:29.880 --> 26:31.880]  This is going to be a super turning.
[26:31.880 --> 26:33.880]  This is going to be all three of those, I think.
[26:33.880 --> 26:35.880]  American Revolution, Civil War, and World War.
[26:35.880 --> 26:36.880]  I agree.
[26:36.880 --> 26:37.880]  Super turning.
[26:37.880 --> 26:41.880]  Strap yourselves in and get right with Jesus, baby, because the robot takeover is about to happen.
[26:41.880 --> 26:44.880]  And with Jesus Christ's spirit, we will defeat it.
[26:44.880 --> 26:48.880]  Humanity's greatest challenge and greatest victory is now.
[26:48.880 --> 26:55.880]  Spread the word if you're pro-human.
[26:55.880 --> 27:04.880]  Computer research scientists, engineers working with attorneys have conclusively proven and put out detailed reports at Tablet magazine,
[27:04.880 --> 27:09.880]  documenting what any trained eye could already see as plain as day.
[27:09.880 --> 27:24.880]  China's Chinese working in tandem with the United Nations and the Democratic Party of the United States, as well as the media, put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look like day of the dead into the world in China earlier this year.
[27:24.880 --> 27:30.880]  Then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down when China reopened within three months.
[27:30.880 --> 27:34.880]  This is the greatest strategic coup ever.
[27:34.880 --> 27:41.880]  China is 21st century warfare being carried out through psychological means or the ultimate style.
[27:41.880 --> 27:44.880]  Paul Joseph Watson has written about it at infowars.com.
[27:44.880 --> 27:47.880]  Myself, Alex Jones, David, I know and Troy are covering this heavily.
[27:47.880 --> 27:54.880]  This is the way to bring down the globalist is exposing how communist China and the UN were behind the hysteria.
[27:54.880 --> 28:06.880]  And perhaps, most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19 which are well beyond what they should be.
[28:06.880 --> 28:10.880]  It's estimated that 200 million people have died.
[28:10.880 --> 28:13.880]  200 million people have died.
[28:13.880 --> 28:16.880]  Probably by the time I finish this talk.
[28:16.880 --> 28:24.880]  Right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60% of America has died from COVID-19 when it's not even 200,000 reality,
[28:24.880 --> 28:28.880]  he would want to say 6 million have lung scarring and heart damage.
[28:28.880 --> 28:29.880]  It's all made up.
[28:29.880 --> 28:30.880]  But you know where he got it?
[28:30.880 --> 28:33.880]  The mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that.
[28:33.880 --> 28:38.880]  They said that 4% of America would be dead already.
[28:38.880 --> 28:43.880]  Of course, it's.000 and then add a number because the numbers vary.
[28:43.880 --> 28:48.880]  It's a real virus, just like people being struck by lightning is real.
[28:48.880 --> 28:54.880]  But to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind control.
[28:54.880 --> 28:57.880]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[28:57.880 --> 29:06.880]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset.
[29:06.880 --> 29:09.880]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[29:09.880 --> 29:12.880]  The world being built by the technocrats.
[29:12.880 --> 29:17.880]  And the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown.
[29:17.880 --> 29:26.880]  It is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization.
[29:26.880 --> 29:33.880]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[29:33.880 --> 29:36.880]  This is their stated goal.
[29:36.880 --> 29:42.880]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror.
[29:42.880 --> 29:45.880]  And not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[29:45.880 --> 29:46.880]  We turn this around.
[29:46.880 --> 29:48.880]  You must study their own writings.
[29:48.880 --> 29:50.880]  You must face the facts.
[29:50.880 --> 29:52.880]  And you must come to grips with it.
[29:52.880 --> 30:21.880]  We're all living in America, America. It's wonderful. We're all living in America, America, America.
[30:21.880 --> 30:28.880]  We're all living in America, America. It's wonderful.
[30:28.880 --> 30:32.880]  There is a planetary AI takeover taking place.
[30:32.880 --> 30:35.880]  Big techs on record. China is their model.
[30:35.880 --> 30:39.880]  I was on a big podcast, Drinking Bros podcast.
[30:39.880 --> 30:41.880]  Black Rifle Bobby Company.
[30:41.880 --> 30:48.880]  And they had some former military guys, really smart guys on there.
[30:48.880 --> 30:51.880]  And I was talking about, they got three million Uighurs in death camps.
[30:51.880 --> 30:56.880]  They got a million Christians, a million Buddhists at least, and they sell their organs and they advertise their fresh.
[30:56.880 --> 31:02.880]  And they drive them in mobile execution vans to the tarmac and they fly it into Japan where they do the surgeries.
[31:02.880 --> 31:05.880]  And they were search engine and there it was in London Independent.
[31:05.880 --> 31:06.880]  There it was mainstream news.
[31:06.880 --> 31:12.880]  But no one even criticizing Apple helping fund and run some of these death camps.
[31:12.880 --> 31:16.880]  And so remember when you hear Tim Cook up there funding Black Lives Matter?
[31:16.880 --> 31:18.880]  That's funding the end of the nuclear family.
[31:18.880 --> 31:20.880]  They're so evil.
[31:20.880 --> 31:22.880]  And they're aligned with China.
[31:22.880 --> 31:24.880]  But Tim Cook doesn't have kids. They didn't care.
[31:24.880 --> 31:26.880]  But what about Jeff Bezos? He's got a whole bunch of kids.
[31:26.880 --> 31:29.880]  But he thinks he's going to be separate from the rest of us.
[31:29.880 --> 31:31.880]  That's what this technocracy is.
[31:31.880 --> 31:35.880]  These digital gates and cages up everywhere with robots controlling us.
[31:35.880 --> 31:39.880]  And like any war, it's incremental, incremental until bam, it hits you.
[31:39.880 --> 31:41.880]  So I did have David Knight in here.
[31:41.880 --> 31:46.880]  He did a very important viral report as a listener sent him some documents.
[31:46.880 --> 31:47.880]  We checked it. He checked it.
[31:47.880 --> 31:48.880]  It's confirmed.
[31:48.880 --> 31:50.880]  I talked to multiple banks today.
[31:50.880 --> 31:54.880]  They said, yes, we've been told limited cash and the cash is going to be phased out.
[31:54.880 --> 31:56.880]  We have copies of the letters here.
[31:56.880 --> 31:58.880]  There's an article up on info wars.com.
[31:58.880 --> 31:59.880]  It just went live.
[31:59.880 --> 32:02.880]  Fed announces it will quit printing paper money.
[32:02.880 --> 32:03.880]  And it's got the documents.
[32:03.880 --> 32:04.880]  It's got the video.
[32:04.880 --> 32:06.880]  It's got the whole breakdown.
[32:06.880 --> 32:08.880]  And they said, oh, we need to get rid of cash for COVID.
[32:08.880 --> 32:10.880]  COVID is the excuse on every front.
[32:10.880 --> 32:16.880]  No medical doctor, no scientist, no virologist, not Cedar Sinai hospital,
[32:16.880 --> 32:24.880]  not the head of the Rockefeller hospital can come out and say, hey,
[32:24.880 --> 32:26.880]  we'll get herd immunity from this.
[32:26.880 --> 32:28.880]  Putting people in houses makes you sick.
[32:28.880 --> 32:29.880]  That's been proven correct.
[32:29.880 --> 32:30.880]  We proved it.
[32:30.880 --> 32:31.880]  Or, hey, hydroxychloroquine helps.
[32:31.880 --> 32:34.880]  They get banned because the UN didn't say it.
[32:34.880 --> 32:39.880]  Well, now, 27 days out from the election, we have big breaking news just now
[32:39.880 --> 32:42.880]  before we hit the Federal Reserve News here with David Knight.
[32:42.880 --> 32:44.880]  Donald Trump censored by Twitter.
[32:44.880 --> 32:45.880]  Flu season is coming up.
[32:45.880 --> 32:50.880]  Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, despite the vaccine die from the flu.
[32:50.880 --> 32:52.880]  Are we going to close down our country?
[32:52.880 --> 32:53.880]  No, we have learned to live with it.
[32:53.880 --> 32:55.880]  So they don't want this common sense message.
[32:55.880 --> 33:01.880]  Just like we are living, learning to live with COVID in most populations far less lethal.
[33:01.880 --> 33:04.880]  He stated something was true, but even it was a lie.
[33:04.880 --> 33:05.880]  We elected him.
[33:05.880 --> 33:06.880]  He's our president.
[33:06.880 --> 33:07.880]  He should have absolute speech.
[33:07.880 --> 33:08.880]  So should everybody else.
[33:08.880 --> 33:09.880]  This is just unprecedented.
[33:09.880 --> 33:13.880]  Well, you'd have already had judges come out and say that President Trump could not suspend
[33:13.880 --> 33:16.880]  anybody off his personal account, not even off the POTUS account.
[33:16.880 --> 33:18.880]  That's not what they're talking about.
[33:18.880 --> 33:21.880]  They were saying, you can't, if somebody is trolling you on your personal account that
[33:21.880 --> 33:23.880]  he had before he became president, real Donald Trump.
[33:23.880 --> 33:24.880]  That's free speech.
[33:24.880 --> 33:25.880]  Can't get that off.
[33:25.880 --> 33:30.880]  But then, you know, you can have, but they also said they reserve the right for Jack Dorsey,
[33:30.880 --> 33:34.880]  the CEO of Twitter, to kick Trump off completely.
[33:34.880 --> 33:38.880]  Now, how in the world can you contain, how can you explain both of those together?
[33:38.880 --> 33:42.880]  If that is something that has to be preserved because it's in the public's interest, then
[33:42.880 --> 33:48.880]  how can the CEO transcend all that and not only censor President Trump, but kick him
[33:48.880 --> 33:49.880]  off, ban him.
[33:49.880 --> 33:55.380]  I mean, they're giving more power to these technocrats, CEOs than they are to the president
[33:55.380 --> 33:56.380]  of the United States.
[33:56.380 --> 33:57.880]  And that's the real story behind all this.
[33:57.880 --> 33:59.880]  What he's saying here, Alex, is exactly right.
[33:59.880 --> 34:04.880]  I've been very critical about President Trump pushing the vaccine, not pulling back, you
[34:04.880 --> 34:08.880]  know, and now this week, you know, the statement that he made, and again, he had the, at the
[34:08.880 --> 34:11.880]  end of it, he said, well, we've got great new drugs and we've got a vaccine stuff.
[34:11.880 --> 34:14.880]  And it's like, all right, yeah, but still the basic message is that we should not be
[34:14.880 --> 34:15.880]  afraid.
[34:15.880 --> 34:16.880]  Don't be a coward.
[34:16.880 --> 34:17.880]  Don't be an idiot.
[34:17.880 --> 34:18.880]  It's beautiful.
[34:18.880 --> 34:19.880]  It's true.
[34:19.880 --> 34:20.880]  But David.
[34:20.880 --> 34:21.880]  But that's what he's saying here.
[34:21.880 --> 34:22.880]  He's talking about the flu season.
[34:22.880 --> 34:25.880]  That's how I knew that this was total BS from the very beginning, reported this year after
[34:25.880 --> 34:27.880]  year, how they inflate the flu number.
[34:27.880 --> 34:29.880]  And now they don't, it's like the flu numbers.
[34:29.880 --> 34:30.880]  They have the graphs.
[34:30.880 --> 34:32.880]  I even hired a high level statistician.
[34:32.880 --> 34:35.880]  Obviously we couldn't use his name because he lost his job.
[34:35.880 --> 34:39.880]  But we hired a guy that works for the state of Texas, major insurance companies, federal
[34:39.880 --> 34:40.880]  government.
[34:40.880 --> 34:41.880]  He looked at what we were already seeing.
[34:41.880 --> 34:43.880]  What others had said, he said, no, it's worse than that.
[34:43.880 --> 34:48.880]  We've published like five, six articles showing that your professional statistician data where
[34:48.880 --> 34:51.880]  it's overblown 90 plus times.
[34:51.880 --> 34:52.880]  Everything's a scam.
[34:52.880 --> 34:55.880]  They're, they're adding numbers of people with that of other things in there.
[34:55.880 --> 34:56.880]  It's all true.
[34:56.880 --> 35:00.880]  The rate in Texas is like, last time we checked was like point zero, zero, zero, zero, zero,
[35:00.880 --> 35:01.880]  zero, something.
[35:01.880 --> 35:02.880]  That's right.
[35:02.880 --> 35:03.880]  I mean, it's, remember it was going to be four percent.
[35:03.880 --> 35:04.880]  We're going to die.
[35:04.880 --> 35:05.880]  That's right.
[35:05.880 --> 35:06.880]  That's right.
[35:06.880 --> 35:07.880]  And now what they're doing, and they've been doing this for a while, as you point out,
[35:07.880 --> 35:12.880]  moving people who've died from cancer, from heart attack, but especially from flu, any
[35:12.880 --> 35:14.880]  respiratory illness, they've moved it over.
[35:14.880 --> 35:18.880]  We had the, at the very beginning of this, as I pointed out this morning, the testing,
[35:18.880 --> 35:21.880]  if you look at the testing, they were saying, we don't have any tests.
[35:21.880 --> 35:22.880]  That's a big problem.
[35:22.880 --> 35:23.880]  We got an emergency.
[35:23.880 --> 35:24.880]  So they bought a bunch of tests.
[35:24.880 --> 35:25.880]  They got some contaminated tests from China.
[35:25.880 --> 35:26.880]  It's all admitted.
[35:26.880 --> 35:27.880]  It's all admitted.
[35:27.880 --> 35:29.880]  And the new rapid action tests are even worse.
[35:29.880 --> 35:30.880]  But let's, let's hit this.
[35:30.880 --> 35:33.880]  I've learned Trump is, is a, is a counterpuncher.
[35:33.880 --> 35:34.880]  He understands metaphysically.
[35:34.880 --> 35:36.880]  He's almost like autistic.
[35:36.880 --> 35:40.880]  And I mean, like an idiot savant level, because people that don't say, he doesn't tell me
[35:40.880 --> 35:41.880]  what he's thinking and it makes us move.
[35:41.880 --> 35:42.880]  That really is like chess.
[35:42.880 --> 35:45.880]  Sometimes it seems really stupid to their logic.
[35:45.880 --> 35:49.880]  He knew they were going to come give him a false test as a stunt.
[35:49.880 --> 35:51.880]  They probably waited till he actually had a cold.
[35:51.880 --> 35:53.880]  He sounded like he had one lost a few pounds.
[35:53.880 --> 35:57.880]  If you have a regular cold or even a bacterial infection, that will show up as COVID.
[35:57.880 --> 35:59.880]  Most of the tests as they met.
[35:59.880 --> 36:01.880]  Well, I had COVID last year because I had pneumonia.
[36:01.880 --> 36:02.880]  So I'm presuming it's COVID.
[36:02.880 --> 36:03.880]  Exactly.
[36:03.880 --> 36:04.880]  So I got really sick in January.
[36:04.880 --> 36:06.880]  I've been having a fever in five years.
[36:06.880 --> 36:09.880]  I got, so, so, so that happened.
[36:09.880 --> 36:11.880]  It was really bad cough fever.
[36:11.880 --> 36:12.880]  We get rid of it.
[36:12.880 --> 36:13.880]  Who knows what it was.
[36:13.880 --> 36:16.880]  The point is, is that Trump went, okay, I'll go to your hospital.
[36:16.880 --> 36:17.880]  I'll play your games.
[36:17.880 --> 36:19.880]  But then he turned it around in judo.
[36:19.880 --> 36:20.880]  Boom.
[36:20.880 --> 36:23.880]  Two days later comes out and is really hitting on all cylinders.
[36:23.880 --> 36:25.880]  Now, this is really, really good news.
[36:25.880 --> 36:27.880]  But I've been told by the White House who rarely reaches out.
[36:27.880 --> 36:28.880]  They did on this.
[36:28.880 --> 36:30.880]  It was like they reached out on the second amendment.
[36:30.880 --> 36:33.880]  They said, look, Trump's going to tell them, okay, we'll, we'll support your gun control.
[36:33.880 --> 36:35.880]  Tell us what you want.
[36:35.880 --> 36:37.880]  Only so Pelosi, so narcissistic.
[36:37.880 --> 36:39.880]  That meeting she goes, we want to ban all guns.
[36:39.880 --> 36:41.880]  And then that totally defeated them.
[36:41.880 --> 36:44.880]  And so Trump literally, it's not even really 3D chess.
[36:44.880 --> 36:47.880]  He goes, okay, we'll do your vaccine now, not keep things.
[36:47.880 --> 36:48.880]  And then he takes control of it.
[36:48.880 --> 36:50.880]  Knowing then people won't be scared.
[36:50.880 --> 36:51.880]  It won't be a fair monger.
[36:51.880 --> 36:52.880]  They won't take the vaccine.
[36:52.880 --> 36:53.880]  It's a gamble.
[36:53.880 --> 36:55.880]  It's, I call it black magic.
[36:55.880 --> 36:58.880]  I mean, it is using deception, but that's what he's doing.
[36:58.880 --> 37:00.880]  Well, it's a very dangerous thing to push the vaccine.
[37:00.880 --> 37:03.880]  But what he said right here is exactly right.
[37:03.880 --> 37:08.880]  Comparing it to the flu, talking about how they inflate the flu statistics every year,
[37:08.880 --> 37:09.880]  how they put the flu vaccine out.
[37:09.880 --> 37:13.880]  As I pointed out today, they've never cured the flu with a flu vaccine.
[37:13.880 --> 37:14.880]  No, I agree.
[37:14.880 --> 37:15.880]  I agree.
[37:15.880 --> 37:18.880]  What do you think of the Machiavellian stuff Trump's pulling?
[37:18.880 --> 37:20.880]  Because he is pulling this stuff.
[37:20.880 --> 37:22.880]  Well, I like to have straight up leadership.
[37:22.880 --> 37:23.880]  Well, he does that.
[37:23.880 --> 37:24.880]  He does that on a lot of stuff.
[37:24.880 --> 37:26.880]  But with the left, he manipulates them because they deserve it.
[37:26.880 --> 37:27.880]  Yeah.
[37:27.880 --> 37:30.880]  I think what President Trump needs to do is what he's doing right here.
[37:30.880 --> 37:31.880]  Telling people the truth.
[37:31.880 --> 37:32.880]  Leveling.
[37:32.880 --> 37:33.880]  Don't be exactly.
[37:33.880 --> 37:36.880]  Don't play these games and say one thing to one group one day.
[37:36.880 --> 37:37.880]  So, so straight shoot.
[37:37.880 --> 37:39.880]  Don't play Machiavellian.
[37:39.880 --> 37:40.880]  Absolutely.
[37:40.880 --> 37:41.880]  Tell the truth.
[37:41.880 --> 37:42.880]  Be a straight shooter.
[37:42.880 --> 37:43.880]  Oppose this straight up.
[37:43.880 --> 37:45.880]  Because we try to finesse this thing.
[37:45.880 --> 37:48.880]  We're going to wind up getting this workforce and anything.
[37:48.880 --> 37:51.880]  The fact that our superpower, his superpower is straight shooting.
[37:51.880 --> 37:52.880]  That's right.
[37:52.880 --> 37:53.880]  Not playing games.
[37:53.880 --> 37:54.880]  So what?
[37:54.880 --> 37:55.880]  You can manipulate the left.
[37:55.880 --> 37:56.880]  They're all manipulating us.
[37:56.880 --> 37:57.880]  Let's not play their games.
[37:57.880 --> 37:58.880]  Yeah.
[37:58.880 --> 37:59.880]  The end does not justify the mean.
[37:59.880 --> 38:01.880]  That's why I don't like some of the Q stuff.
[38:01.880 --> 38:02.880]  I'm not fighting with the Q people.
[38:02.880 --> 38:04.880]  But the Q people are like, oh, we're lying to win.
[38:04.880 --> 38:05.880]  I don't like that.
[38:05.880 --> 38:06.880]  No, no, no.
[38:06.880 --> 38:08.880]  The end justifying the means.
[38:08.880 --> 38:09.880]  That's a communist tactic.
[38:09.880 --> 38:11.880]  Lying to people to get somewhere.
[38:11.880 --> 38:13.880]  That is not a tactic of leadership.
[38:13.880 --> 38:14.880]  He needs to be straight up.
[38:14.880 --> 38:15.880]  He needs to oppose this.
[38:15.880 --> 38:17.880]  And I don't care what he's done in the past.
[38:17.880 --> 38:18.880]  He can turn this around.
[38:18.880 --> 38:20.880]  Start doing the right thing.
[38:20.880 --> 38:23.880]  Start telling people the truth about this.
[38:23.880 --> 38:25.880]  Be straight up in his opposition to this.
[38:25.880 --> 38:26.880]  And that's a win.
[38:26.880 --> 38:27.880]  I agree.
[38:27.880 --> 38:30.880]  But he did play them when he's like, OK, what do you want?
[38:30.880 --> 38:31.880]  Well, we'll probably do it.
[38:31.880 --> 38:32.880]  Well, we want all the guns.
[38:32.880 --> 38:33.880]  Everybody's like, what?
[38:33.880 --> 38:34.880]  He wants gun control.
[38:34.880 --> 38:36.880]  No, he got them to say we want everything.
[38:36.880 --> 38:37.880]  I mean, that was very strategic.
[38:37.880 --> 38:40.880]  So I agree with you that I never pull stuff like that.
[38:40.880 --> 38:42.880]  But I don't even think like that.
[38:42.880 --> 38:43.880]  But Trump, I mean, Trump did that.
[38:43.880 --> 38:45.880]  Yeah, the problem is that when you say we take guns
[38:45.880 --> 38:47.880]  and do the due process later, you had a lot of Democrat
[38:47.880 --> 38:48.880]  governors who did that.
[38:48.880 --> 38:50.880]  And you're going to have a lot of Democrat governors.
[38:50.880 --> 38:53.880]  And if it's not Trump, it'll be the president after him,
[38:53.880 --> 38:55.880]  whether it's Biden or whether it's somebody else.
[38:55.880 --> 38:56.880]  No, I hear you.
[38:56.880 --> 38:58.880]  But he did use these vaccines and the mandatory vaccine
[38:58.880 --> 39:00.880]  issue and say, we got to do it for your safety.
[39:00.880 --> 39:01.880]  We've got to push back.
[39:01.880 --> 39:02.880]  I agree.
[39:02.880 --> 39:05.880]  This idea that the key role of government is to keep us safe.
[39:05.880 --> 39:07.880]  It's not the key role of government.
[39:07.880 --> 39:09.880]  The key role of government is to protect our individual liberties.
[39:09.880 --> 39:10.880]  That's what the-
[39:10.880 --> 39:11.880]  Well, it's not just a key role.
[39:11.880 --> 39:13.880]  They have no responsibility to it because they can't.
[39:13.880 --> 39:14.880]  Yeah.
[39:14.880 --> 39:15.880]  I mean, cops have no responsibility.
[39:15.880 --> 39:17.880]  They're responding for crimes committed.
[39:17.880 --> 39:18.880]  Do they try to protect you?
[39:18.880 --> 39:19.880]  Yes.
[39:19.880 --> 39:20.880]  But to sue them or blame them, they have no liability.
[39:20.880 --> 39:21.880]  It's up to us.
[39:21.880 --> 39:23.880]  But then they can't say, well, we want your guns
[39:23.880 --> 39:25.880]  because we're going to protect you.
[39:25.880 --> 39:26.880]  No.
[39:26.880 --> 39:28.880]  We have a monopoly of force as citizens.
[39:28.880 --> 39:29.880]  Yeah.
[39:29.880 --> 39:32.880]  And then we designate police and a constabulary to work for us.
[39:32.880 --> 39:33.880]  That's right.
[39:33.880 --> 39:34.880]  Well, you go back to the police analogy.
[39:34.880 --> 39:35.880]  I talked about this earlier.
[39:35.880 --> 39:37.880]  We're talking about censorship.
[39:37.880 --> 39:40.880]  Because, and what they're doing to President Trump right now,
[39:40.880 --> 39:44.880]  you know, the idea that the First Amendment only protects us
[39:44.880 --> 39:47.880]  from attacks on free speech by the government is totally wrong.
[39:47.880 --> 39:48.880]  That's right.
[39:48.880 --> 39:50.880]  Let's talk about that in the Federal Reserve News.
[39:50.880 --> 39:51.880]  It's usually come back.
[39:51.880 --> 39:52.880]  All right.
[39:52.880 --> 39:55.880]  Stand back and stand by.

[40:57.880 --> 40:58.880]  And I'm really bummed out about that.
[40:58.880 --> 41:00.880]  It started out as a sleeper product,
[41:00.880 --> 41:03.880]  but the people that did order it loved it and started reordering it.
[41:03.880 --> 41:06.880]  They spread the word and became one of our best sellers.
[41:06.880 --> 41:09.880]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown,
[41:09.880 --> 41:12.880]  and because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack,
[41:12.880 --> 41:15.880]  we are unable to secure it anymore.

[41:23.880 --> 41:24.880]  It's amazing.
[41:24.880 --> 41:26.880]  I don't have time to go into everything that's in it,
[41:26.880 --> 41:29.880]  but this gets people to remember to take it,
[41:29.880 --> 41:31.880]  and that's why it's having such a great effect,

[41:45.880 --> 41:48.880]  The last chance to get it, infowarstore.com.
[41:48.880 --> 41:51.880]  A-Pack Power Stack, 60% off and free shipping.
[41:55.880 --> 41:56.880]  For more than 100 years,
[41:56.880 --> 41:59.880]  the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish
[41:59.880 --> 42:02.880]  world government, abolish nation-states,
[42:02.880 --> 42:05.880]  dumb down the population by taking control of education,
[42:05.880 --> 42:08.880]  and most importantly, taking control of western medicine.
[42:08.880 --> 42:11.880]  Now, they had a bad name by the 1920s.
[42:11.880 --> 42:14.880]  They started converting over and funding other organizations
[42:14.880 --> 42:19.880]  and groups like IBM to continue on with their eugenics operations.
[42:19.880 --> 42:23.880]  Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM
[42:23.880 --> 42:27.880]  via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III,
[42:27.880 --> 42:30.880]  his father, of course, being the head of Planned Parenthood.
[42:30.880 --> 42:32.880]  And now, he's been able to position himself
[42:32.880 --> 42:35.880]  over almost every health department in the world,
[42:35.880 --> 42:38.880]  every national health system.
[42:38.880 --> 42:40.880]  Bill Gates is in control.
[42:40.880 --> 42:43.880]  They have spent 100 plus years getting positioned
[42:43.880 --> 42:46.880]  to be able to control what happens to your body
[42:46.880 --> 42:48.880]  and what goes in your body.
[42:48.880 --> 42:50.880]  This is the holy grail of their operations,
[42:50.880 --> 42:54.880]  and now they're normalizing, putting a new type of DNA in your body.
[42:54.880 --> 42:57.880]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996
[42:57.880 --> 43:01.880]  that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[43:01.880 --> 43:05.880]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me
[43:05.880 --> 43:07.880]  because that was un-American.
[43:07.880 --> 43:11.880]  Now, the media admits that almost every app and every company
[43:11.880 --> 43:14.880]  that are on Apple and Androids, don't just track your location,
[43:14.880 --> 43:18.880]  but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to,
[43:18.880 --> 43:22.880]  your relationships, and they all share the data with each other
[43:22.880 --> 43:24.880]  of what you're doing on the apps as well,
[43:24.880 --> 43:28.880]  including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying,
[43:28.880 --> 43:30.880]  just like Siri or Alexa do,
[43:30.880 --> 43:34.880]  and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say
[43:34.880 --> 43:36.880]  into those systems to be saved forever.
[43:36.880 --> 43:38.880]  Your phone is spying on you,
[43:38.880 --> 43:40.880]  and companies are generating secret surveillance scores
[43:40.880 --> 43:42.880]  based on information.
[43:42.880 --> 43:45.880]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[43:45.880 --> 43:49.880]  Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com
[43:49.880 --> 43:54.880]  and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks, infowarstore.com.
[43:54.880 --> 44:15.880]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[44:24.880 --> 44:27.880]  They really got to the point of not denying what they got planned for us.
[44:27.880 --> 44:30.880]  I always knew that day was coming. It's here now.
[44:30.880 --> 44:32.880]  David Nautilus, a little bit of the next hour, getting into that,
[44:32.880 --> 44:35.880]  and some of the things Trump just came out that are pretty alarming.
[44:35.880 --> 44:38.880]  He said some really good things and some really bad things
[44:38.880 --> 44:42.880]  about getting rid of even FDA guidelines about vaccine safety to accelerate.
[44:42.880 --> 44:45.880]  That's crazy. We'll talk about that briefly next hour.
[44:45.880 --> 44:50.880]  We have Mark Dice exclusively joining us with some big announcements
[44:50.880 --> 44:55.880]  and news today, and we also are going to have John Lorraine pop in
[44:55.880 --> 45:01.880]  to talk about what she expects to happen at the VP debate and more.
[45:01.880 --> 45:07.880]  But first off, APEC Power Stack is an American success story.
[45:07.880 --> 45:10.880]  We first put it out, wasn't very popular, people that got it,
[45:10.880 --> 45:13.880]  loved it, gave it great reviews, told friends and family about it,
[45:13.880 --> 45:16.880]  so it became one of our top five or six best sellers.
[45:16.880 --> 45:20.880]  This has 13 different pills in it with an AM and PM stack that does everything you need,
[45:20.880 --> 45:25.880]  game changing, life changing, and it's the highest quality.
[45:25.880 --> 45:27.880]  Well, with the supply chain's breaking down,
[45:27.880 --> 45:29.880]  we've already lost a lot of formulas that are single ingredient
[45:29.880 --> 45:31.880]  because the supply chain's broken down.
[45:31.880 --> 45:33.880]  Companies have gone on a business, you name it.
[45:33.880 --> 45:35.880]  This company's great, it's still there.
[45:35.880 --> 45:37.880]  One of the top companies in the U.S. makes this for us,
[45:37.880 --> 45:39.880]  but they can't get some of the ingredients,
[45:39.880 --> 45:41.880]  so we've got to either change the name or reformulate.
[45:41.880 --> 45:42.880]  That's how it works.
[45:42.880 --> 45:44.880]  When you reformulate or change something under law,
[45:44.880 --> 45:47.880]  you've got to change the name or call plus or whatever.
[45:47.880 --> 45:50.880]  So, this is the last chance you can get 8 Pack Power Stack
[45:50.880 --> 45:52.880]  at infowarstore.com and experience it.
[45:52.880 --> 45:54.880]  We're very, very close to selling out.
[45:54.880 --> 45:58.880]  And the big 40 hour broadcast we kick off tomorrow with David 9 at 8 AM,
[45:58.880 --> 46:01.880]  Central is going to be much of it commercial free
[46:01.880 --> 46:05.880]  and a bunch of special guests breaking news and live coverage of the VP debate.
[46:05.880 --> 46:10.880]  It's sponsored by 8 Pack Power Stack at infowarstore.com.
[46:10.880 --> 46:15.880]  And the info wars, emergency election sale, total blowout.
[46:15.880 --> 46:17.880]  I said, because of how crazy the world is,
[46:17.880 --> 46:20.880]  we're going to sell out of everything and just have the funds
[46:20.880 --> 46:22.880]  to hopefully go into next year and then see what we can do,
[46:22.880 --> 46:25.880]  depending on the future, because things are so perilous.
[46:25.880 --> 46:26.880]  That's not hype.
[46:26.880 --> 46:28.880]  We're selling out of Winter Sun Plus.
[46:28.880 --> 46:30.880]  That's so good to boost your overall body's defenses.
[46:30.880 --> 46:33.880]  Vitamin D3, the highest quality, and K that absorbs it.
[46:33.880 --> 46:35.880]  Bodies, ultimate tumor reformally.
[46:35.880 --> 46:38.880]  You talk about boosting your immune system, lowering inflammation
[46:38.880 --> 46:41.880]  that's so tied to problems.
[46:41.880 --> 46:43.880]  These are essential things.
[46:43.880 --> 46:45.880]  Turbo force, 10 hour clean energy.
[46:45.880 --> 46:46.880]  Again, discounted free shipping.
[46:46.880 --> 46:49.880]  Vaso Beach selling out 10% off and free shipping.
[46:49.880 --> 46:52.880]  DNA force plus discounted and free shipping.
[46:52.880 --> 46:53.880]  That's the number one thing I do.
[46:53.880 --> 46:56.880]  X2, X3, the clean iodine, also essential.
[46:56.880 --> 46:58.880]  Game changing.
[46:58.880 --> 46:59.880]  Heart and body combo.
[46:59.880 --> 47:01.880]  Vaso beats, extended wise.
[47:01.880 --> 47:03.880]  Still discounted even though it's selling out.
[47:03.880 --> 47:06.880]  Prostigar, the high dose of high quality zinc.
[47:06.880 --> 47:10.880]  I mean, we've got our, from Mustard Seed,
[47:10.880 --> 47:13.880]  selenium, that's the best you're going to find out there.
[47:13.880 --> 47:16.880]  All of these are essential, and they're amazing.
[47:16.880 --> 47:20.880]  infowarstore.com, and they fund the Info War, a true 360 win.
[47:20.880 --> 47:23.880]  Okay, David, this is why I got you here.
[47:23.880 --> 47:24.880]  So you've got the floor here.
[47:24.880 --> 47:26.880]  We were having a great banner back and forth.
[47:26.880 --> 47:27.880]  We're so excited because this is so real.
[47:27.880 --> 47:30.880]  The full report you did that's gone viral is at infowars.com.
[47:30.880 --> 47:33.880]  Fed announces it will quit printing, paper, money.
[47:33.880 --> 47:34.880]  You've got the actual document.
[47:34.880 --> 47:36.880]  They can document Kim while you talk about it.
[47:36.880 --> 47:38.880]  This is huge.
[47:38.880 --> 47:40.880]  First, you started reporting six months ago on coin shortages.
[47:40.880 --> 47:42.880]  They now admit they're phasing that out.
[47:42.880 --> 47:43.880]  That's right.
[47:43.880 --> 47:44.880]  Now it's the money.
[47:44.880 --> 47:45.880]  Same excuse.
[47:45.880 --> 47:46.880]  They're saying COVID.
[47:46.880 --> 47:48.880]  This is their Rosetta Stone, their skeleton key,
[47:48.880 --> 47:49.880]  their operating system.
[47:49.880 --> 47:52.880]  Tell us the exclusive you got that we've confirmed.
[47:52.880 --> 47:55.880]  Well, everybody's seen the notices several months ago
[47:55.880 --> 47:58.880]  where you had shortages of cash, of coin.
[47:58.880 --> 48:00.880]  And some people would say, well, you know,
[48:00.880 --> 48:01.880]  we don't have any coin.
[48:01.880 --> 48:03.880]  We'll give you extra services or goods
[48:03.880 --> 48:05.880]  if you give us some more coins.
[48:05.880 --> 48:08.880]  Or we're just not going to take cash at all.
[48:08.880 --> 48:11.880]  Or we'll round it up if you insist on paying cash.
[48:11.880 --> 48:13.880]  Now, after the Federal Reserve did that and said,
[48:13.880 --> 48:15.880]  well, we can't print coins anymore.
[48:15.880 --> 48:16.880]  And they were also putting out the idea,
[48:16.880 --> 48:18.880]  oh, your cash, the paper is dirty.
[48:18.880 --> 48:21.880]  You're going to catch COVID from handling the paper.
[48:21.880 --> 48:22.880]  So they don't want to handle paper anyway.
[48:22.880 --> 48:23.880]  Let's do it all cashless.
[48:23.880 --> 48:25.880]  And now you can't hand somebody a credit card.
[48:25.880 --> 48:26.880]  It's all going to be digital.
[48:26.880 --> 48:28.880]  And then now a robot's got to deliver it.
[48:28.880 --> 48:30.880]  You can stay admit this, how they're walking us in
[48:30.880 --> 48:32.880]  to the squeeze shoot, into this corral,
[48:32.880 --> 48:33.880]  into this news, into this prison.
[48:33.880 --> 48:34.880]  That's right.
[48:34.880 --> 48:36.880]  And so, you know, when you look at all this,
[48:36.880 --> 48:39.880]  they say due to COVID-19 at the bank of the credit union,
[48:39.880 --> 48:41.880]  we can't give you cash anymore.
[48:41.880 --> 48:43.880]  Well, I think they're using COVID in a number of ways.
[48:43.880 --> 48:45.880]  Number one, they're using this to push us in
[48:45.880 --> 48:46.880]  for the cashless society.
[48:46.880 --> 48:49.880]  But I think even bigger than that is the fact
[48:49.880 --> 48:54.880]  that they're using COVID as an excuse to deflect blame
[48:54.880 --> 48:56.880]  from them for what they've done with the Great Recession,
[48:56.880 --> 48:59.880]  when they started creating this massive bubble
[48:59.880 --> 49:00.880]  that was going to burst.
[49:00.880 --> 49:02.880]  They want this to burst on them.
[49:02.880 --> 49:04.880]  So now they can say it was not us, it was the virus.
[49:04.880 --> 49:05.880]  That's right.
[49:05.880 --> 49:06.880]  Well, that's what they said.
[49:06.880 --> 49:07.880]  The Great Reset from the beginning.
[49:07.880 --> 49:08.880]  The head of Davos said we're going to use this
[49:08.880 --> 49:10.880]  to implode the economy, put you in debt,
[49:10.880 --> 49:12.880]  lower your standard of living to have a lower carbon footprint,
[49:12.880 --> 49:14.880]  but they all live lavish lifestyles.
[49:14.880 --> 49:15.880]  That's right.
[49:15.880 --> 49:17.880]  Mezos wants you to live in a coffin apartment he owns.
[49:17.880 --> 49:18.880]  Oh, yeah.
[49:18.880 --> 49:21.880]  But he has giant yachts and huge 50,000 square foot homes.
[49:21.880 --> 49:22.880]  That's right.
[49:22.880 --> 49:23.880]  Let's get to the actual notice that was sent to me.
[49:23.880 --> 49:24.880]  This was sent by a listener.
[49:24.880 --> 49:26.880]  By the way, if you want to send me a tip,
[49:26.880 --> 49:32.880]  you can send that at davidnightshow, davidnightshowatprotonmail.com.
[49:32.880 --> 49:34.880]  And again, don't send to David Knight,
[49:34.880 --> 49:36.880]  because there is a David Knight at Proton Mail.
[49:36.880 --> 49:38.880]  He's getting a lot of my families not happy with that.
[49:38.880 --> 49:39.880]  So make sure it's David Knight Show.
[49:39.880 --> 49:43.880]  Anyway, this is what came from the Orange County Credit Union
[49:43.880 --> 49:44.880]  in California.
[49:44.880 --> 49:47.880]  Due to COVID-19, the Federal Reserve has suspended
[49:47.880 --> 49:49.880]  new currency ordering this holiday season.
[49:49.880 --> 49:52.880]  This is a proactive measure to enable reserve banks
[49:52.880 --> 49:55.880]  to continue to meet daily demand for currency and coin.
[49:55.880 --> 49:59.880]  Now, I ask you, who other than the Federal Reserve
[49:59.880 --> 50:01.880]  that doesn't care about supply and demand would say,
[50:01.880 --> 50:04.880]  well, in order to meet demand, we're going to stop making this thing.
[50:04.880 --> 50:06.880]  I mean, that's obviously not,
[50:06.880 --> 50:08.880]  but they don't pay attention to supply and demand.
[50:08.880 --> 50:10.880]  Kids need a lot of milk, so we're stopping production.
[50:10.880 --> 50:11.880]  That's right.
[50:11.880 --> 50:13.880]  We need shoes, so we're cutting production.
[50:13.880 --> 50:16.880]  The reason they're putting this out is because they said every year,
[50:16.880 --> 50:19.880]  people order brand new bills because they want to give them as...
[50:19.880 --> 50:21.880]  And they want to demystify cash.
[50:21.880 --> 50:22.880]  They want to get us off of it.
[50:22.880 --> 50:23.880]  That's right.
[50:23.880 --> 50:27.880]  I mean, I always, I'll be at the bank in like December 15th.
[50:27.880 --> 50:29.880]  They go, why are you getting $10,000?
[50:29.880 --> 50:31.880]  Well, I mean, I literally give like all these cousins
[50:31.880 --> 50:34.880]  and all these nieces and my children a couple hundred bucks.
[50:34.880 --> 50:35.880]  They love it.
[50:35.880 --> 50:36.880]  That's right.
[50:36.880 --> 50:37.880]  And what they're saying is a lot of people come in.
[50:37.880 --> 50:39.880]  If you want to give somebody a cash for Christmas,
[50:39.880 --> 50:41.880]  you want to do it with a nice clean bill instead of something that...
[50:41.880 --> 50:42.880]  Nice Christmas bill.
[50:42.880 --> 50:44.880] ...COVID all over it.
[50:44.880 --> 50:45.880]  And so they're saying,
[50:45.880 --> 50:47.880]  but we're not going to be able to do that this year.
[50:47.880 --> 50:49.880]  We still will be able to give you cash,
[50:49.880 --> 50:52.880]  but just lightly used cash.
[50:52.880 --> 50:53.880]  Maybe...
[50:53.880 --> 50:54.880]  And if you notice,
[50:54.880 --> 50:55.880]  they've also sort of making the money real flimsy
[50:55.880 --> 50:57.880]  where even new money falls apart real quick.
[50:57.880 --> 50:58.880]  They're facing it now.
[50:58.880 --> 50:59.880]  Explain to them why, David.
[50:59.880 --> 51:01.880]  Well, you know, they're saying they can give you digital
[51:01.880 --> 51:02.880]  or they can give you cashier's check.
[51:02.880 --> 51:06.880]  Look, the bottom line is cash is anonymous.
[51:06.880 --> 51:07.880]  They don't like that.
[51:07.880 --> 51:09.880]  It can't be tracked easily by these people.
[51:09.880 --> 51:10.880]  The AI grid hates cash.
[51:10.880 --> 51:11.880]  That's right.
[51:11.880 --> 51:12.880]  And they want to make sure...
[51:12.880 --> 51:13.880]  Cash kills AI.
[51:13.880 --> 51:14.880]  That's right.
[51:14.880 --> 51:19.880]  Everything that you do has to be channeled through their control grid
[51:19.880 --> 51:21.880]  so they can monitor and record...
[51:21.880 --> 51:23.880]  So they can censor you and shut you down.
[51:23.880 --> 51:24.880]  And that's why they're pushing us into this.
[51:24.880 --> 51:26.880]  And at the same time, you know,
[51:26.880 --> 51:29.880]  we've got the story up on InfoWars about John McAfee.
[51:29.880 --> 51:31.880]  They say, well, income tax, but you look at it,
[51:31.880 --> 51:33.880]  it's really about the cryptocurrency.
[51:33.880 --> 51:36.880]  It's really about shutting down other cryptocurrency.
[51:36.880 --> 51:38.880]  So they're pushing us into the cashless society.
[51:38.880 --> 51:40.880]  They want to make sure they've got a monopoly on that as well.
[51:40.880 --> 51:42.880]  But it's all about the tracking.
[51:42.880 --> 51:43.880]  Everything is about the tracking.
[51:43.880 --> 51:45.880]  The vaccine is about the tracking.
[51:45.880 --> 51:47.880]  The testing is about the tracking.
[51:47.880 --> 51:49.880]  It's all about global social credit score.
[51:49.880 --> 51:50.880]  Exactly.
[51:50.880 --> 51:52.880]  But I mean, this is a big exclusive.
[51:52.880 --> 51:53.880]  We made some calls. It's true.
[51:53.880 --> 51:55.880]  They're all being told, sorry, no cash for Christmas.
[51:55.880 --> 51:56.880]  Yeah.
[51:56.880 --> 51:57.880]  Think about that.
[51:57.880 --> 51:58.880]  The Federal Reserve has to send...
[51:58.880 --> 51:59.880]  And the funny thing is, last week,
[51:59.880 --> 52:00.880]  I already went and got more cash out.
[52:00.880 --> 52:01.880]  If I just knew this was coming.
[52:01.880 --> 52:02.880]  Yeah.
[52:02.880 --> 52:05.880]  Well, you know, I reported a month or two ago,
[52:05.880 --> 52:07.880]  the fact that there was an interview with Powell,
[52:07.880 --> 52:09.880]  the Federal Reserve, and some guys said,
[52:09.880 --> 52:12.880]  so you're just running the printing press on this stuff.
[52:12.880 --> 52:14.880]  It goes, well, actually, we're not running the printing press.
[52:14.880 --> 52:16.880]  We couldn't print that much money.
[52:16.880 --> 52:18.880]  They're doing $3 trillion.
[52:18.880 --> 52:20.880]  But again, it's not the Federal Reserve that's bad.
[52:20.880 --> 52:21.880]  It's anyone that hoards it.
[52:21.880 --> 52:22.880]  Oh.
[52:22.880 --> 52:23.880]  That's right.
[52:23.880 --> 52:26.880]  If you don't trust them, when they're taking the NRA's bank accounts,
[52:26.880 --> 52:28.880]  they've taken ours, soul story behind the scenes,
[52:28.880 --> 52:31.880]  they're harassing almost no gun shops in Austin.
[52:31.880 --> 52:34.880]  40-year-old gun shops in Austin have their banks dump them.
[52:34.880 --> 52:35.880]  That's right.
[52:35.880 --> 52:37.880]  I mean, of course, they're going to use this leverage.
[52:37.880 --> 52:38.880]  That's right.
[52:38.880 --> 52:39.880]  This is social control, folks.
[52:39.880 --> 52:40.880]  That's right.
[52:40.880 --> 52:42.880]  They're going to be handing out the money digitally.
[52:42.880 --> 52:44.880]  They want to give you digital cash.
[52:44.880 --> 52:46.880]  That was already proposed in the very beginning
[52:46.880 --> 52:49.880]  of the universal basic income, what we call the stimulus.
[52:49.880 --> 52:52.880]  And that's again, COVID is about making you go on the universal income.
[52:52.880 --> 52:53.880]  That's right.
[52:53.880 --> 52:54.880]  We ought to do a diagram.
[52:54.880 --> 52:55.880]  I know you've done it.
[52:55.880 --> 52:56.880]  I've done it.
[52:56.880 --> 52:57.880]  But show every checkbox it does.
[52:57.880 --> 52:58.880]  It's like hundreds of things.
[52:58.880 --> 52:59.880]  Oh, yeah.
[52:59.880 --> 53:00.880]  And it's all preplanned, organized.
[53:00.880 --> 53:01.880]  They admit it is.
[53:01.880 --> 53:02.880]  Yeah.
[53:02.880 --> 53:03.880]  It's so diabolical.
[53:03.880 --> 53:04.880]  Yeah.
[53:04.880 --> 53:06.880]  And so they can not only watch everything that you do,
[53:06.880 --> 53:07.880]  but if they don't like what you do,
[53:07.880 --> 53:09.880]  they can just pull all the cash out of your account just like that,
[53:09.880 --> 53:11.880]  which they couldn't do if you physically have it.
[53:11.880 --> 53:14.880]  And then no one will support you because they don't want to get banned.
[53:14.880 --> 53:15.880]  That's right.
[53:15.880 --> 53:17.880]  And then they can ban you individually as they want
[53:17.880 --> 53:19.880]  because we never organize and come together.
[53:19.880 --> 53:20.880]  That's the creative slaves.
[53:20.880 --> 53:22.880]  As we don't come together when there's a wrong,
[53:22.880 --> 53:24.880]  we wait and get individually picked off.
[53:24.880 --> 53:26.880]  It's already largely digital.
[53:26.880 --> 53:29.880]  Understand when they're doing a trillion dollars a month,
[53:29.880 --> 53:31.880]  it's basically digital.
[53:31.880 --> 53:32.880]  And that's what Powell was saying.
[53:32.880 --> 53:33.880]  And I even talked about it.
[53:33.880 --> 53:34.880]  I said, think about this.
[53:34.880 --> 53:36.880]  You know, if you go back and you're like,
[53:36.880 --> 53:38.880]  how high is a stack of trillion dollar bills?
[53:38.880 --> 53:40.880]  It's so high that, you know,
[53:40.880 --> 53:43.880]  three and a half trillion dollars a stack of one dollar bills
[53:43.880 --> 53:44.880]  would take you all the way to the moon.
[53:44.880 --> 53:46.880]  We've already spent 3.7 trillion.
[53:46.880 --> 53:50.880]  They don't have that much paper to print all those bills.
[53:50.880 --> 53:52.880]  And they're really worried about runs on banks.
[53:52.880 --> 53:53.880]  Exactly.
[53:53.880 --> 53:55.880]  And so that's why they're saying, I mean, just,
[53:55.880 --> 53:57.880]  I mean, literally this morning I told my accountant,
[53:57.880 --> 53:58.880]  I said, get me more cash.
[53:58.880 --> 53:59.880]  That's right.
[53:59.880 --> 54:00.880]  I don't have that much.
[54:00.880 --> 54:02.880]  I got like $15,000 or something, but it's locked up in a safe.
[54:02.880 --> 54:04.880]  But the point is, I mean, folks, that's nothing.
[54:04.880 --> 54:05.880]  It's all digital.
[54:05.880 --> 54:08.880]  And these criminals have created this giant overhang
[54:08.880 --> 54:10.880]  of thousands of trillions of dollars,
[54:10.880 --> 54:12.880]  mortgages sold hundreds of times a piece.
[54:12.880 --> 54:14.880]  And then they're trying to tell us we're the bad guys
[54:14.880 --> 54:15.880]  and they're getting ready to take over.
[54:15.880 --> 54:18.880]  Instead of doing a run, instead of you doing a run on the bank,
[54:18.880 --> 54:21.880]  they can do a run on your bank account.
[54:21.880 --> 54:22.880]  You just said it.
[54:22.880 --> 54:24.880]  The Federal Reserve announces the plan to do runs
[54:24.880 --> 54:25.880]  on your digital currency.
[54:25.880 --> 54:26.880]  That's right.
[54:26.880 --> 54:30.880]  And every time they get a power, they abuse it right away.
[54:30.880 --> 54:31.880]  That's right.
[54:31.880 --> 54:33.880]  The barber who was shut down by Whitmer said,
[54:33.880 --> 54:34.880]  I've been a barber for a long time.
[54:34.880 --> 54:35.880]  You know her big mistake?
[54:35.880 --> 54:36.880]  It's the mistake of barbers.
[54:36.880 --> 54:39.880]  It's not knowing when to stop cutting with a haircut.
[54:39.880 --> 54:41.880]  That's the difference between a good haircut and a bad haircut.
[54:41.880 --> 54:42.880]  Stay there.
[54:42.880 --> 55:11.880]  The Bible talks about there being 10 kings of the earth
[55:12.880 --> 55:16.880]  to control who can buy and who can sell to track everything we do.
[55:16.880 --> 55:17.880]  It's not just a recipe.
[55:17.880 --> 55:20.880]  It's a blueprint for a total enslavement.
[55:20.880 --> 55:21.880]  Now you look at Bill Gates.
[55:21.880 --> 55:24.880]  You look at Bloomberg and others who openly say,
[55:24.880 --> 55:25.880]  we're technocrats.
[55:25.880 --> 55:29.880]  We should decide how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get,
[55:29.880 --> 55:30.880]  how much red meat you get.
[55:30.880 --> 55:31.880]  We're technocrats.
[55:31.880 --> 55:32.880]  We know best.
[55:32.880 --> 55:35.880]  We're now going to set up the economy with a social score
[55:35.880 --> 55:36.880]  to totally control you.
[55:36.880 --> 55:37.880]  You snap your fingers.
[55:37.880 --> 55:38.880]  We're here.
[55:38.880 --> 55:40.880]  They're just rolling it out.
[55:40.880 --> 55:42.880]  And a lot of people are complying with it.
[55:42.880 --> 55:45.880]  It's insane.
[55:45.880 --> 55:48.880]  Remember the global lock-downs you're witnessing.
[55:48.880 --> 55:52.880]  The Black Lives Matter, antiferriots and racial attacks
[55:52.880 --> 55:58.880]  we're all seeing are publicly directed by a handful of top billionaires,
[55:58.880 --> 56:03.880]  led by people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, of course, Tim Cook and others.
[56:03.880 --> 56:07.880]  They set up there with their trillions of dollars
[56:07.880 --> 56:09.880]  they control in their companies.
[56:09.880 --> 56:14.880]  Trillions of billions of dollars individually leveraging that against us
[56:14.880 --> 56:19.880]  and trying to create an artificial revolution against local government and police.
[56:19.880 --> 56:22.880]  And the mayors are, again, they're playing their political game
[56:22.880 --> 56:26.880]  to try to trigger the complete breakdown of the United States and Western Europe
[56:26.880 --> 56:30.880]  to show these billionaires can come in and buy it all up for billions on the dollar.
[56:30.880 --> 56:34.880]  That's why I'm so angry at these globalists because when you're looking at them,
[56:34.880 --> 56:36.880]  they're the ones that sit in their councils
[56:36.880 --> 56:38.880]  and have decided to run these plans against us.
[56:38.880 --> 56:41.880]  They are enemies of humanity and must be dealt with.
[56:41.880 --> 57:10.880]  It's us or them, period.
[57:12.880 --> 57:16.880]  You know, I've known David Knight ten years now.
[57:16.880 --> 57:20.880]  Yeah, about a little over eight, a little over eight.
[57:20.880 --> 57:22.880]  But I knew you before from Contest for a while.
[57:22.880 --> 57:24.880]  I've been on a guestful show, something about nine years.
[57:24.880 --> 57:25.880]  Yeah.
[57:25.880 --> 57:27.880]  And you were always pretty relaxed.
[57:27.880 --> 57:31.880]  You're getting even as animated as I am now because, well, you're a father.
[57:31.880 --> 57:33.880]  I mean, you know, this is all confirmed.
[57:33.880 --> 57:36.880]  People think, how do we know what's going to happen next?
[57:36.880 --> 57:37.880]  It happens because it's predatory.
[57:37.880 --> 57:39.880]  We have the documents.
[57:39.880 --> 57:42.880]  And yes, it's crazy what they're doing, but they really have a battle plan.
[57:42.880 --> 57:44.880]  They're very arrogant about it.
[57:44.880 --> 57:47.880]  And we've got to stop this because this is a post human world.
[57:47.880 --> 57:48.880]  They're building their excuses.
[57:48.880 --> 57:49.880]  There's too many of us.
[57:49.880 --> 57:50.880]  We're eating all the food up.
[57:50.880 --> 57:54.880]  Even if that's true, you don't go around murdering everybody and let Bill Gates do it.
[57:54.880 --> 57:57.880]  I mean, people need to be leveled with David, don't they?
[57:57.880 --> 57:59.880]  About the overall programs.
[57:59.880 --> 58:03.880]  We can get down to my new show, the tester fake and the vaccine hurts you and all that.
[58:03.880 --> 58:06.880]  But the overall agenda is we got robots controlling you.
[58:06.880 --> 58:07.880]  You're obsolete.
[58:07.880 --> 58:09.880]  You're not essential. We're going to put something in your body.
[58:09.880 --> 58:10.880]  That's right.
[58:10.880 --> 58:13.880]  You are afraid not only of the pieces of paper.
[58:13.880 --> 58:18.880]  You're afraid of other humans to the extent that, oh, we want robots to deliver the food.
[58:18.880 --> 58:20.880]  We want robots to cook the food.
[58:20.880 --> 58:23.880]  If we ever go back to restaurants and so forth, this is what they've done.
[58:23.880 --> 58:31.880]  It is a version of a combination of hypochondria and OCD that they have inflicted on people.
[58:31.880 --> 58:32.880]  That's the fear.
[58:32.880 --> 58:34.880]  And I've said this for the longest time.
[58:34.880 --> 58:38.880]  I was glad to see President Trump with that tweet earlier to say, we've got to stop the fear.
[58:38.880 --> 58:39.880]  We have the flu every year.
[58:39.880 --> 58:40.880]  Let's put this in context.
[58:40.880 --> 58:43.880]  We had the fear mongering just a couple of weeks ago.
[58:43.880 --> 58:49.880]  Oh, look, this is like the number of COVID deaths, assuming that they are actually accurate.
[58:49.880 --> 58:55.880]  But the number of COVID deaths is like six, seven, 47 is going on, 37 is or whatever, crashing every day.
[58:55.880 --> 58:57.880]  And it's like, okay, we'll put that in perspective.
[58:57.880 --> 59:03.880]  Even if that number were true, we have 12 airplane crashes worth of people dying from heart attacks every day.
[59:03.880 --> 59:06.880]  We have 12 airplanes full of people.
[59:06.880 --> 59:11.880]  The point is the idea that you'll be protected by an anti-state is a lie.
[59:11.880 --> 59:12.880]  That's right.
[59:12.880 --> 59:18.880]  And Eisenhower in a famous speech at university, I forget which one, American University or something, maybe Columbia, he said,
[59:18.880 --> 59:20.880]  I can make you totally safe by putting you in a jail cell.
[59:20.880 --> 59:21.880]  That's right.
[59:21.880 --> 59:22.880]  But you're in a jail cell.
[59:22.880 --> 59:23.880]  That's right.
[59:23.880 --> 59:25.880]  So this idea, they don't want to keep you safe.
[59:25.880 --> 59:26.880]  They want to imprison you.
[59:26.880 --> 59:29.880]  And I've talked about this in terms of the war on drugs the longest time.
[59:29.880 --> 59:33.880]  I said, look, you got people who are dying of overdoses in jail.
[59:33.880 --> 59:38.880]  So if you can't stop the flow of drugs inside of a jail, then what does that mean you're going to do to society?
[59:38.880 --> 59:41.880]  All you can do is punish China's ship of the fentanyl in.
[59:41.880 --> 59:42.880]  Yeah.
[59:42.880 --> 59:43.880]  And they'll stop it.
[59:43.880 --> 59:48.880]  Well, you know, the deal is, is that I see this rolling out and I've been watching this for 204 days.
[59:48.880 --> 59:52.880]  This is why I'm upset, Alex, because no matter how many times I explain,
[59:52.880 --> 1:00:03.880]  and I told everybody that's talking about all the different aspects of UN 2030 that were rolling out with this universal basic income, robots taking your job and on and on the cashless society, complete surveillance.
[1:00:03.880 --> 1:00:04.880]  We've seen all of this.
[1:00:04.880 --> 1:00:07.880]  It was all being pushed under the Green New Deal.
[1:00:07.880 --> 1:00:11.880]  And it's all admitted out and they stick in a new excuse, a new MacGuffin, if you will.
[1:00:11.880 --> 1:00:13.880]  That's what they know.
[1:00:13.880 --> 1:00:14.880]  But here's the good news.
[1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:15.880]  Let's talk about this next segment.
[1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:17.880]  Yeah, let's talk about all the boxes.
[1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:18.880]  Let's have a brainstorm.
[1:00:18.880 --> 1:00:21.880]  Let's talk about all the agendas that this thing aids.
[1:00:21.880 --> 1:00:26.880]  And then the Rockefeller Foundation, the UN, Bill Gates, they admit, oh, the Davos Group.
[1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:27.880]  It's good for the earth.
[1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:29.880]  We're lowering carbon footprint.
[1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:30.880]  Thank you, COVID.
[1:00:30.880 --> 1:00:37.880]  So they even admit they're using it as to get the good out of COVID is to end human civilization.
[1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:41.880]  Well, then I say to them, stop buying $18 million houses on the beach, Obama.
[1:00:41.880 --> 1:00:42.880]  Stop your lies.
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:44.880]  You know, they go, oh, but just believe the science.
[1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:47.880]  By 2017, they said all the cities would be flooded by water.
[1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:48.880]  It's not even true.
[1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:49.880]  They just lie and lie.
[1:00:49.880 --> 1:00:56.880]  And as you said, the good news is they're big fraud of manmade global warming and we're bad and pay carbon taxes to the Rothschilds.
[1:00:56.880 --> 1:00:57.880]  That failed.
[1:00:57.880 --> 1:01:00.880]  So now they just went, oh, we got to lock everything down for this disease.
[1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:01.880]  That's right.
[1:01:01.880 --> 1:01:06.880]  All of it comes back to an ID, a global ID.
[1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:07.880]  That is a central thing.
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:08.880]  That they control.
[1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:09.880]  That they tax.
[1:01:09.880 --> 1:01:11.880]  I think 2020, that was Gates agenda.
[1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:12.880]  Of course, he's got another agenda.
[1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:13.880]  He's got a lot of agendas.
[1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:18.880]  He's got the immunization agenda 2030 where everyone, everywhere, every age vaccinated.
[1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:21.880]  And that's whatever he, that's hundreds that come out with a year.
[1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:22.880]  That's right.
[1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:23.880]  He says, that's why he says the new one.
[1:01:23.880 --> 1:01:25.880]  Oh, for adults, it's five COVID shots a year.
[1:01:25.880 --> 1:01:26.880]  That's right.
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:27.880]  But he wants a global idea.
[1:01:27.880 --> 1:01:29.880]  He's been pushing this very hard in India.
[1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:33.880]  They have the odd heart system there and you don't get anything from the government.
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:34.880]  Any welfare, any services.
[1:01:34.880 --> 1:01:40.880]  Let's explain why they're doing it, the agenda and what it's going to look like and how it's going to roll out with David Knight trade ahead.
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:42.880]  I'm Alan Jones back at 60 seconds.
[1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:46.880]  Your life depends on you listening to this and researching it and spread the link.
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:47.880]  Seriously, this is life and death.
[1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:48.880]  This is life and death.
[1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:49.880]  We are the resistance.
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:55.880]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[1:01:55.880 --> 1:01:57.880]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[1:01:57.880 --> 1:01:59.880]  Is your city too safe?
[1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:03.880]  Well, not anymore.
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:05.880]  Introducing Democrats.
[1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:09.880]  Politicians so incompetent they'll fill your neighborhood with liars.
[1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:14.880]  Blooting, rampant violence and even homelessness.
[1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:19.880]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity.
[1:02:19.880 --> 1:02:21.880]  No more pesky lawn order.
[1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:25.880]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:30.880]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:40.880]  But wait, vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes and more taxes.
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:44.880]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[1:03:06.880 --> 1:03:07.880]  Don't let it dominate.
[1:03:07.880 --> 1:03:09.880]  Don't let it take over your lives.
[1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:10.880]  Don't let that happen.
[1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:12.880]  We have the greatest country in the world.
[1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:13.880]  We're going back.
[1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:14.880]  We're going back to work.
[1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:16.880]  We're going to be out front as your leader.
[1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:17.880]  I had to do that.
[1:03:17.880 --> 1:03:20.880]  I knew there's danger to it, but I had to do it.
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:21.880]  I stood out front.
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:23.880]  I led.
[1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:27.880]  Nobody that's a leader would not do what I did.
[1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:28.880]  And I know there's a risk.
[1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:30.880]  There's a danger, but that's okay.
[1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:33.880]  And now I'm better and maybe I'm immune.
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:34.880]  I don't know.
[1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:36.880]  But don't let it dominate your lives.
[1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:37.880]  Get out there.
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:39.880]  Be careful.
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:41.880]  We have the best medicines in the world.
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:48.880]  And it all happened very shortly and they're all getting approved and the vaccines are coming momentarily.
[1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:49.880]  Thank you very much.
[1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:51.880]  And Walter Reed, what a group of people.
[1:03:51.880 --> 1:03:53.880]  Thank you very much.
[1:03:58.880 --> 1:04:00.880]  Well, you get that 90% good message.
[1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:01.880]  Don't live in fear.
[1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:02.880]  The only thing we have in fear is for itself.
[1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:06.880]  The vaccines are coming because he knows we're trying to kill the economy itself and then plunge everything.
[1:04:06.880 --> 1:04:08.880]  And then they're going to come with force and accolades to begin with.
[1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:11.880]  So he's doing a judo move to take control of what they're doing.
[1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:13.880]  It's still very dangerous, David Knight.
[1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:14.880]  Yeah.
[1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:22.880]  You know, when we look at where this is headed, Alex, it was another listener who sent me back on March the 16th.
[1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:25.880]  Remember that article we had showed the green wristband?
[1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:26.880]  Which is now confirmed.
[1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:27.880]  Exactly.
[1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:28.880]  He was saying they're going to test you.
[1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:30.880]  MIT, you could exclusively confirm that.
[1:04:30.880 --> 1:04:31.880]  That's right.
[1:04:31.880 --> 1:04:32.880]  And now it's, it's, it's...
[1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:35.880]  Well, and, and, you know, what he would say is they're going to test you every day.
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:43.880]  If you test negative, there'll be a fast test, which they've now just approved the Abbott Labs rapid test, the end of August.
[1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:47.880]  And it takes about 15 minutes to get a result from that.
[1:04:47.880 --> 1:04:48.880]  But they'll test you every day.
[1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:51.880]  Once you get that little wristband, that's going to be good for a day.
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:54.880]  Now, what they did in the real life, that was a model.
[1:04:54.880 --> 1:04:58.880]  And of course, he was somebody who worked in the computer industry.
[1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:00.880]  And we knew this was going to be computerized.
[1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:09.880]  What they've done now as part of the Abbott Labs test, they have combined that with a free app, which they said will act as your health passport.
[1:05:09.880 --> 1:05:11.880]  And so you will get that every day.
[1:05:11.880 --> 1:05:12.880]  It'll go on your app.
[1:05:12.880 --> 1:05:14.880]  It'll show when you were tested, where you were tested.
[1:05:14.880 --> 1:05:21.880]  And now the UK, Australia, you saw the woman arrested because she didn't have her papers that she's only allowed to go five kilometers.
[1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:22.880]  Oh, you're at the beach.
[1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:23.880]  You're arrested.
[1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:24.880]  Again, you're all prisoners, folks.
[1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:26.880]  This is, you're going into the big tech prison.
[1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:27.880]  That's right.
[1:05:27.880 --> 1:05:31.880]  I just played yesterday, Boris Johnson in the UK, the prime minister.
[1:05:31.880 --> 1:05:37.880]  And he said, I think we might have something here where we test people and it might take about 15 minutes.
[1:05:37.880 --> 1:05:38.880]  We just occurred to us, right?
[1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:40.880]  It's like, this has been the plan for the longest time.
[1:05:40.880 --> 1:05:46.880]  And just as we told people eight months ago, it's all rolling out exactly as we said, because it's a battle plan, because it's a fraud.
[1:05:46.880 --> 1:05:47.880]  You've got to warn people.
[1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:48.880]  You've got to stop complying.
[1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:50.880]  You're not heroes when you do this.
[1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:55.880]  You're helping bring in a high tech tyranny that's going to also starve the third world to death and then us later.
[1:05:55.880 --> 1:05:57.880]  Here's another part of the plan.
[1:05:57.880 --> 1:05:59.880]  Let me interject this, Alex.
[1:05:59.880 --> 1:06:04.880]  Going back to when Bloomberg was running for president, remember when he trash talked farmers?
[1:06:04.880 --> 1:06:07.880]  Well, everybody missed the context of what he was saying.
[1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:08.880]  He was saying you're obsolete.
[1:06:08.880 --> 1:06:10.880]  He was arrogant about farmers.
[1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:11.880]  He was arrogant about factory workers.
[1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:16.880]  But what he was talking about was the agricultural revolution and then the industrial revolution and so forth.
[1:06:16.880 --> 1:06:23.880]  And the end of that was he said, now, those of us like me who are smart, we're working on taking their jobs.
[1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:31.880]  And he says the task for us is to keep them happy so that they don't grab guillotines and come after us.
[1:06:31.880 --> 1:06:32.880]  Nobody talked about that.
[1:06:32.880 --> 1:06:34.880]  That's right, because he said guillotines.
[1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:35.880]  And Zuckerberg said the same thing.
[1:06:35.880 --> 1:06:42.880]  He said, we're going to hold the American people a hand like you do at hospice when we take over.
[1:06:42.880 --> 1:06:43.880]  These are quotes.
[1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:46.880]  He goes, my users that trust me are dumb dumb apps.
[1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:48.880]  Well, it's the Americans.
[1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:49.880]  I mean, these people are psychotics.
[1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:53.880]  They don't see the rest of us as a market with them.
[1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:54.880]  We live together with a great life.
[1:06:54.880 --> 1:06:57.880]  They think they're going to do all this evil and it's not going to affect them.
[1:06:57.880 --> 1:06:58.880]  Well, guess what?
[1:06:58.880 --> 1:07:01.880]  On Hawaii, in Kauai, everyone hates Zuckerberg.
[1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:08.880]  He tried to take thousands of acres of ancient tribal land, the most sacred, and just just buy the land around it and block it.
[1:07:08.880 --> 1:07:09.880]  And people all hating.
[1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:10.880]  We hate you.
[1:07:10.880 --> 1:07:11.880]  We know who you are.
[1:07:11.880 --> 1:07:12.880]  You soulless pig.
[1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:13.880]  You monster.
[1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:16.880]  We talk about the left running death camps in China.
[1:07:16.880 --> 1:07:18.880]  The left is Satan.
[1:07:18.880 --> 1:07:19.880]  We talk about tribal land.
[1:07:19.880 --> 1:07:23.880]  This is not even something that the UN is rolling this out.
[1:07:23.880 --> 1:07:25.880]  But we've already done this once in America.
[1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:27.880]  It's called the Indian Reservation System.
[1:07:27.880 --> 1:07:34.880]  And if you want to see what lockdown looks like in the Indian Reservation System, I've also had listeners send me what is happening on these reservations.
[1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:39.880]  It's a thing to run rough shot, take property, take people to jail, arrest them.
[1:07:39.880 --> 1:07:48.880]  In the 1870s, they basically took away their ability to live the way that they chose, shut them down from creating any new farming, any new businesses.
[1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:50.880]  And they've got a very corrupt bureaucracy that runs that.
[1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:54.880]  And now under lockdown, they're under even stricter rules than we are here.
[1:07:54.880 --> 1:07:55.880]  Much stricter rules.
[1:07:55.880 --> 1:07:59.880]  Again, it's every slave class is the beta test for everybody else.
[1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:01.880]  What you see happen to black folks is for white people.
[1:08:01.880 --> 1:08:05.880]  And I'm not calling black slaves the global to see them as a test class on record.
[1:08:05.880 --> 1:08:09.880]  Now, David, we've got you a few minutes left, you're kicking butt here.
[1:08:09.880 --> 1:08:11.880]  We've got the big 40 hour broadcast that starts tomorrow.
[1:08:11.880 --> 1:08:12.880]  You're going to be part of that.
[1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:13.880]  You're going to kick that off at 8 a.m. tomorrow.
[1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:14.880]  It's going to go for 40 hours straight.
[1:08:14.880 --> 1:08:21.880]  It's an M4's money bomb to get in funding for equipment and infrastructure and legal bills to stay on air and stay in attack formation.
[1:08:21.880 --> 1:08:25.880]  But you can get a lot of products right now at m4store.com that make that all possible.
[1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:28.880]  But let's talk about the check boxes.
[1:08:28.880 --> 1:08:32.880]  It brings in, COVID brings in the UN as the world authority.
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:38.880]  And then if anybody doesn't follow what the UN is saying, though it's all lies, then you get censored.
[1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:43.880]  So it puts big tech as the policeman with AI in real time on what you say in cyberspace.
[1:08:43.880 --> 1:08:45.880]  Then it puts drones in the air to watch you.
[1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:47.880]  It puts face scanners in stores to watch you.
[1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:49.880]  It rolls out the prison planet.
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:51.880]  It gets rid of cash.
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:54.880]  It then makes us scared of our neighbors, scared of our friends.
[1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:56.880]  It teaches us that we are non-essential.
[1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:59.880]  It lets the robots take over and start delivering things to us.
[1:08:59.880 --> 1:09:04.880]  It teaches us that interaction with each other is dirty and bad.
[1:09:04.880 --> 1:09:05.880]  We don't have children.
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:08.880]  It's all admitted to the population plan and now they admit that.
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:11.880]  But there are a lot of other facets to what this does.
[1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:12.880]  What others come to mind?
[1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:18.880]  Well, what you're talking about in terms of the global nature of this, think about how this is rapidly rolled out
[1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:21.880]  and we're seeing a unified approach around the world.
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:25.880]  And the central part of all this, in my opinion, is the ID.
[1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:26.880]  Isn't it interesting?
[1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:32.880]  Well, in your opinion, it's the global carbon tax tracker surveillance nexus point to control tax and trace you.
[1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:33.880]  Exactly.
[1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:36.880]  To treat you like inventory, to treat you like cattle.
[1:09:36.880 --> 1:09:40.880]  And then they always make you do more and more and more to prove you're essential.
[1:09:40.880 --> 1:09:41.880]  That's right.
[1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:42.880]  Sterilize yourself.
[1:09:42.880 --> 1:09:43.880]  Chop your son's balls off.
[1:09:43.880 --> 1:09:45.880]  These are the new sacraments.
[1:09:45.880 --> 1:09:47.880]  They eliminate the rule of law.
[1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:49.880]  They eliminate individual liberty.
[1:09:49.880 --> 1:09:53.880]  All of these things that are part of Western civilization, all that being swept away very quickly.
[1:09:53.880 --> 1:09:57.880]  Zuckerberg is setting up his own new councils that decide who can have a website.
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:02.880]  They said that Carl Rittenhouse is guilty so his lawyers can't be on Facebook and defending.
[1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:03.880]  That's right.
[1:10:03.880 --> 1:10:04.880]  Because this is, this is.
[1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:08.880]  And the Congress is still debating whether Antifa is organized or whether Big Tech's a threat.
[1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:13.880]  I mean, the Congress is a bunch of 80-year-old men and women who literally are idiots.
[1:10:13.880 --> 1:10:15.880]  I mean, they are the biggest chumps.
[1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:16.880]  They think they've got power.
[1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:18.880]  Everybody pulls their chair out.
[1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:22.880]  They give them their coffee, their jokes that are allowing this evil takeover.
[1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:23.880]  You're idiots.
[1:10:23.880 --> 1:10:24.880]  You're morons.
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:26.880]  Well, it's the centralization of control.
[1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:29.880]  It's the elimination of the individual.
[1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:31.880]  It's the identification and the tracking.
[1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:33.880]  It's the commodification of humans, as you said.
[1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:34.880]  Exactly.
[1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:35.880]  The Internet of Things.
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:40.880]  I mean, it's 5G is part of the key structure of this because they have to have that bandwidth.
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:42.880]  It pierces all devices.
[1:10:42.880 --> 1:10:43.880]  It tracks.
[1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:44.880]  It runs their robots.
[1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:45.880]  Yeah.
[1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:48.880]  Because when there's clouds or problems, they need to have it on the ground, total control.
[1:10:48.880 --> 1:10:49.880]  That's right.
[1:10:49.880 --> 1:10:50.880]  And so, you know, we look at.
[1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:51.880]  And it kills us while they're at it.
[1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:52.880]  That's right.
[1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:53.880]  Yeah.
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:54.880]  That's the other part of it.
[1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:55.880]  It's population control in both sense of the words.
[1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:59.880]  Eliminate the vast majority of people because we are the virus.
[1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:00.880]  And they say this under environmentalism.
[1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:02.880]  David, it's got to come from Satan.
[1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:03.880]  I mean, it's so alien.
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:04.880]  It's so sophisticated.
[1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:06.880]  It's like it's been done before.
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:09.880]  Like it frizes and sterilizes us while it controls us and makes us obsolete.
[1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:14.880]  Well, just think about the fact that in revelations, it's the mark of the beast, the mark of the
[1:11:14.880 --> 1:11:16.880]  government, which is a number.
[1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:20.880]  Whatever you think the number means, the fact is that it's coming down to that right now.
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:23.880]  That's the amazing thing to me about all of this is how this is.
[1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:25.880]  Did you feel the earnestness in your heart?
[1:11:25.880 --> 1:11:26.880]  You're sold.
[1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:27.880]  We got to do something now.
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:28.880]  Oh, yeah.
[1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:29.880]  I said this earlier.
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:30.880]  I never got to it.
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:31.880]  I forgot to get to it.
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:34.880]  But I was invited like Texas best seminars, like a lay preacher would put it on.
[1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:37.880]  A couple of people show up and one night I was at dinner with them after one of these events
[1:11:37.880 --> 1:11:39.880]  where you eat eggs at night almost or whatever.
[1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:40.880]  It's a little diner.
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:43.880]  I said, the market that these will be a chip in your skin.
[1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:44.880]  He goes, no, it's not.
[1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:49.880]  It's going to be a vaccine that that that that goes into your DNA and changes it and
[1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:50.880]  genetically modified creature.
[1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:53.880]  This is like 1997.
[1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:55.880]  And he really said it sophisticatedly.
[1:11:55.880 --> 1:11:56.880]  And I said, where'd you read that?
[1:11:56.880 --> 1:11:59.880]  And he goes, no, this pastor I know had a vision and he's Texas.
[1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:01.880]  And he said, they're going to be plagues.
[1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:04.880]  They release and you'll have to have these shots that change who you are.
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:06.880]  And then it'll actually sterilize you.
[1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:08.880]  But to live, you'll then have to have it.
[1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:13.880]  And I mean, this is a, this is a preacher in, in 1997.
[1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:15.880]  Obviously that was divinely given.
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:16.880]  Yeah.
[1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:17.880]  I mean, they didn't just make that.
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:18.880]  And then now it's here.
[1:12:18.880 --> 1:12:19.880]  Absolutely.
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:20.880]  I forget that guy's name.
[1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:21.880]  I wonder if he's still alive.
[1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:22.880]  I need to get that going.
[1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:26.880]  Well, you know, it's like the pastor I'm speaking to today, you know, you go back and you look
[1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:27.880]  at this.
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:28.880]  And I said this from the very beginning.
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:29.880]  I said, I don't know how this is going to turn out.
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:31.880]  I just know what my role in this is.
[1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:33.880]  You know, it's just like today there.
[1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:34.880]  Let's talk about your role.
[1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:35.880]  Yeah.
[1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:36.880]  And then y'all in the rain is coming in.
[1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:39.880]  I'm Alex Jones on this live Tuesday global transmission.
[1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:42.880]  The only reason we're on air is because of you and I salute you and I thank you.
[1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:45.880]  Thanks for keeping us in attack formation viewers and listeners.
[1:12:45.880 --> 1:12:50.880]  You are the tip of the spear and you are everything that we need to win this fight.
[1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:52.880]  The future isn't coming.
[1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:53.880]  It's here.
[1:12:53.880 --> 1:12:59.880]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very
[1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:02.880]  essence is going to be your most valuable asset.
[1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:05.880]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:11.880]  The world being built by the technocrats and the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and
[1:13:11.880 --> 1:13:18.880]  the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into
[1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:22.880]  total and complete dehumanization.
[1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:29.880]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:30.880]  2050.
[1:13:30.880 --> 1:13:32.880]  This is their stated goal.
[1:13:32.880 --> 1:13:38.880]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror
[1:13:38.880 --> 1:13:41.880]  and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:42.880]  We turn this around.
[1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:44.880]  You must study their own writings.
[1:13:44.880 --> 1:13:48.880]  You must face the facts and you must come to grips with it.
[1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:50.880]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:55.880]  We've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown and it's horrible and it's
[1:13:55.880 --> 1:13:57.880]  killing millions of people via starvation.
[1:13:57.880 --> 1:14:01.880]  But the good news is it's caused a planetary awakening as well.
[1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:05.880]  The general public all over the planet hate Bill Gates.
[1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:08.880]  He's the most unpopular person on earth.
[1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:10.880]  People know he's not a doctor.
[1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:12.880]  People know he's a eugenicist.
[1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:17.880]  The population knows that his vaccines that he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses,
[1:14:17.880 --> 1:14:19.880]  polio, steroids and more.
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:21.880]  It's even in the Associated Press.
[1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:26.880]  So now they're beginning to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate
[1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:32.880]  global government and the beast top tech billionaires sit in meetings and decide to pull the type
[1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:36.880]  of race war scams and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing.
[1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:42.880]  So remember that and let them know that we know who they are and what they've done and
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:45.880]  we hold them responsible for the collapse of civilization.
[1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:48.880]  They are the enemies of humanity.
[1:14:48.880 --> 1:15:08.880]  They want you dead.
[1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:18.880]  So there I am in some diner in north Austin in the late 1990s and there's this guy that puts on seminars.
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:19.880]  It's a Christian.
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:22.880]  It's a political seminar.
[1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:23.880]  I'm having dinner.
[1:15:23.880 --> 1:15:24.880]  West was there.
[1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:27.880]  That 90 had a Volkswagen back then.
[1:15:27.880 --> 1:15:32.880]  We're sitting at the counter and his fellow, his name, I'm trying to find this morning,
[1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:34.880]  looks at me and he says,
[1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:38.880]  the market, the beast didn't give me a microchip.
[1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:40.880]  It's going to be a vaccine that reprograms your DNA and takes your body over.
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:42.880]  It makes you part of the beast system.
[1:15:42.880 --> 1:15:43.880]  That's very sophisticated.
[1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:44.880]  Where'd you get those?
[1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:48.880]  Those preacher friend of mine basically had a vision and I was kind of like, okay.
[1:15:48.880 --> 1:15:52.880]  But now M RNA vaccines going in reprogramming.
[1:15:52.880 --> 1:15:54.880]  You were talking about growing up as a Christian, the church you were in.
[1:15:54.880 --> 1:15:58.880]  They thought it was more, more of an allegory and explain that because now we're here.
[1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:01.880]  This is definitely real and notice the churches aren't saying a word.
[1:16:01.880 --> 1:16:03.880]  So David, I talk about that.
[1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:06.880]  I talk about the big picture because you were saying it went to break.
[1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:10.880]  Your mission is just to get the truth out and let folks make their spiritual decision.
[1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:11.880]  I agree.
[1:16:11.880 --> 1:16:14.880]  I have trouble getting frustrated like I need to do more to stop this.
[1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:17.880]  But I guess it's going to end up being carried out.
[1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:18.880]  Well, you know, that's it.
[1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:23.880]  As I was saying, you know, when I grew up as a child, they looked at allegorical and they would say,
[1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:28.880]  well, you know, how's the entire world going to watch two witnesses get killed and so forth.
[1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:30.880]  But now you don't even think twice about that.
[1:16:30.880 --> 1:16:32.880]  We're watching things worldwide.
[1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:34.880]  It wasn't too long after that that we had satellite television.
[1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:36.880]  But I mean, that's nothing compared to the Internet now.
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:40.880]  And so I think I've heard a lot of people say over the years and said, you know,
[1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:45.880]  all the mistakes that I've made in terms of understanding the Bible were because I didn't take things literally enough.
[1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:48.880]  It is literally how we're seeing it literally happening here.
[1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:51.880]  And so what is our point of what we do here?
[1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:56.880]  You know, I was just talking to Tony Spell, who has been holding church, never stopped holding church.
[1:16:56.880 --> 1:16:57.880]  So they've arrested him.
[1:16:57.880 --> 1:17:00.880]  He's getting the full China treatment now.
[1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:03.880]  Under U.S. law, Congress has no jurisdiction.
[1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:05.880]  He had no jurisdiction over a church.
[1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:06.880]  Yeah.
[1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:12.880]  So, you know, it's a complete repudiation of all the founding principles of our country as well as western civilization.
[1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:16.880]  And he said, well, you know, I've got orders of what I'm supposed to do.
[1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:17.880]  We're going to have church.
[1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:18.880]  And, you know, that's what I've got.
[1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:19.880]  That's right.
[1:17:19.880 --> 1:17:21.880]  We've got to take God's orders and carry them out.
[1:17:21.880 --> 1:17:22.880]  That's it.
[1:17:22.880 --> 1:17:23.880]  Whatever happens.
[1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:24.880]  And I said this from the very beginning.
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:25.880]  That's it.
[1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:26.880]  We're going to execute God's orders, brother.
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:27.880]  That's right.
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:30.880]  I've got to learn because I get so frustrated that God's the general.
[1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:31.880]  I'm just a private.
[1:17:31.880 --> 1:17:33.880]  I've got to stop worrying about the big picture.
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:34.880]  Just do my job.
[1:17:34.880 --> 1:17:35.880]  Follow the orders.
[1:17:35.880 --> 1:17:36.880]  That's it.
[1:17:36.880 --> 1:17:40.880]  I said from the very beginning, I said, I don't know if this is a dangerous disease or not.
[1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:44.880]  I said, however, I'm going to do what I have to do.
[1:17:44.880 --> 1:17:46.880]  And that is show up here every day.
[1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:48.880]  And I'm just going to leave the consequences up to God.
[1:17:48.880 --> 1:17:50.880]  That's what Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego did.
[1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:53.880]  They said, well, you can throw us in the furnace and it's up to God.
[1:17:53.880 --> 1:17:54.880]  If we die, we die.
[1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:55.880]  Same thing in the lion's den.
[1:17:55.880 --> 1:17:56.880]  Exactly.
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:57.880]  That's what's going to happen.
[1:17:57.880 --> 1:18:00.880]  But, you know, that's the way people live their lives.
[1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:03.880]  That's what people did at the beginning of World War II in the UK.
[1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:04.880]  And they did it in America.
[1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:07.880]  They said, well, we don't know what the consequences are, but freedom is a peril.
[1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:09.880]  We're going to defend it with all of our life.
[1:18:09.880 --> 1:18:10.880]  We're not rolling over.
[1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:11.880]  Yes.
[1:18:11.880 --> 1:18:12.880]  But now we're rolling over to a virus.
[1:18:12.880 --> 1:18:16.880]  They admit it's a giant overblown fraud, a scam, a power grab.
[1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:24.880]  And they continue to add new control points and new control tactics, even as they're constantly
[1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:27.880]  shifting goalposts or show to be a fraud.
[1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:29.880]  You know, first it was all the deaths.
[1:18:29.880 --> 1:18:30.880]  Then it was other things.
[1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:32.880]  Now it's all about the test cases.
[1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:34.880]  And that is the central point right now.
[1:18:34.880 --> 1:18:35.880]  It's the test cases.
[1:18:35.880 --> 1:18:39.880]  And I think that is the thing that we have to focus on because we're rolling out hundreds
[1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:44.880]  of millions of these, perhaps tens of billions of them as part of the stimulus package.
[1:18:44.880 --> 1:18:46.880]  And it's all going to move very quickly.
[1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:48.880]  Lock us down and to track us as we go.
[1:18:48.880 --> 1:18:49.880]  And it's all admitted.
[1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:50.880]  Yeah.
[1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:52.880]  What's crazy is people say, don't you feel good being vindicated?
[1:18:52.880 --> 1:18:53.880]  No, I feel physically sick.
[1:18:53.880 --> 1:18:54.880]  Yeah.
[1:18:54.880 --> 1:18:56.880]  I mean, how do you feel being vindicated?
[1:18:56.880 --> 1:19:00.880]  Well, as you said before, it's like having a front row seat, you know, the end of the
[1:19:00.880 --> 1:19:04.880]  world here, you know, because you know, this authoritarian, we mean, yeah, Gates is like,
[1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:06.880]  oh, this is going to kill a bunch of people.
[1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:08.880]  Oh, 80% gets sick a bunch.
[1:19:08.880 --> 1:19:10.880]  And they're like, but you're going to take it.
[1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:12.880]  They can't hide it anymore, man.
[1:19:12.880 --> 1:19:13.880]  Yeah.
[1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:14.880]  Oh, it's absolutely insane when you look at this.
[1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:19.880]  And when they talk about a testing of the vaccines, they're going to do a lot of testing
[1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:20.880]  of us.
[1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:21.880]  And of course, it's going to be bogus.
[1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:23.880]  The testing of everybody they want to grab.
[1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:26.880]  They say you didn't test or you came up positive.
[1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:27.880]  You just disappeared.
[1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:28.880]  That's right.
[1:19:28.880 --> 1:19:29.880]  It's already being done everywhere.
[1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:30.880]  That's right.
[1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:31.880]  That's right.
[1:19:31.880 --> 1:19:34.880]  We look at the they're already talking in Australia about indefinite detention of people.
[1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:39.880]  Remember when we had the NDAA in 2012, they said, well, it's not that you might have COVID.
[1:19:39.880 --> 1:19:41.880]  It's that you criticize our measures.
[1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:42.880]  That's right.
[1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:43.880]  Wow.
[1:19:43.880 --> 1:19:44.880]  Yeah.
[1:19:44.880 --> 1:19:46.880]  And it's all UN directed mayors that signed deals with the UN.
[1:19:46.880 --> 1:19:47.880]  That's right.
[1:19:47.880 --> 1:19:48.880]  Unionization.
[1:19:48.880 --> 1:19:50.880]  That's why central governments have let the UN come in and take over.
[1:19:50.880 --> 1:19:54.880]  Well, when you look at indefinite detention by the military, I mean, that's already happening
[1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:55.880]  now in Australia.
[1:19:55.880 --> 1:20:00.880]  And all of this bad stuff that you're seeing in Australia is happening in one state.
[1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:05.920]  And that guy, Dan Andrews, has taken a trillion dollars from the Chinese for their Belt and
[1:20:05.920 --> 1:20:06.920]  Road Initiative.
[1:20:06.920 --> 1:20:09.880]  And what he is doing is he's creating a new infrastructure.
[1:20:09.880 --> 1:20:10.880]  All right.
[1:20:10.880 --> 1:20:12.880]  It's an infrastructure of control of the people.
[1:20:12.880 --> 1:20:16.880]  Let's say that again, the main mayor, they use all of the world as an example in Australia
[1:20:16.880 --> 1:20:19.880]  as the example, got a billion bucks from the chai comms.
[1:20:19.880 --> 1:20:20.880]  A trillion.
[1:20:20.880 --> 1:20:21.880]  Excuse me.
[1:20:21.880 --> 1:20:22.880]  For the T. Yeah.
[1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:23.880]  Yeah.
[1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:24.880]  This is one state.
[1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:25.880]  So you've got the state of Victoria in Australia.
[1:20:25.880 --> 1:20:26.880]  Wow.
[1:20:26.880 --> 1:20:27.880]  I knew it was billions and billions.
[1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:28.880]  A trillion?
[1:20:28.880 --> 1:20:29.880]  A trillion.
[1:20:29.880 --> 1:20:30.880]  A trillion dollars.
[1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:31.880]  Yeah.
[1:20:31.880 --> 1:20:32.880]  And so I knew the chai comms bought Australia.
[1:20:32.880 --> 1:20:33.880]  But my God.
[1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:34.880]  Yeah.
[1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:35.880]  Oh, yeah.
[1:20:35.880 --> 1:20:36.880]  Yeah.
[1:20:36.880 --> 1:20:37.880]  A trillion dollars, I said, you know, we can't come out of our houses.
[1:20:37.880 --> 1:20:39.880]  And because they can only come out, you know, like one hour a day.
[1:20:39.880 --> 1:20:41.880]  So we're hearing all this construction going on.
[1:20:41.880 --> 1:20:44.880]  We're not sure exactly what they're building now because of the way that they're acting.
[1:20:44.880 --> 1:20:46.880]  They've changed even their police uniforms.
[1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:49.880]  So that the uniforms have changed their building stuff.
[1:20:49.880 --> 1:20:50.880]  There's drones flying around.
[1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:51.880]  What the hell's going on?
[1:20:51.880 --> 1:20:52.880]  Yeah.
[1:20:52.880 --> 1:20:54.880]  I noticed a lot of the police too in those cities are Chinese.
[1:20:54.880 --> 1:20:55.880]  Yeah, I don't know.
[1:20:55.880 --> 1:20:56.880]  But the thing is.
[1:20:56.880 --> 1:20:57.880]  Oh, you watch the footage.
[1:20:57.880 --> 1:20:58.880]  Yeah.
[1:20:58.880 --> 1:21:00.880]  I can't tell because they've got these helmets on beating people.
[1:21:00.880 --> 1:21:02.880]  You know, that's what I typically say.
[1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:04.880]  A mob, you know, jumping on a woman.
[1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:08.880]  This is the smoke screen of the commie takeover.
[1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:13.880]  The thing is, is that again, it's only happening in the one state that took a trillion dollars
[1:21:13.880 --> 1:21:14.880]  from the Chinese.
[1:21:14.880 --> 1:21:19.880]  Even in PR, yeah, yeah, Australia and New Zealand and you go into it a trillion dollars
[1:21:19.880 --> 1:21:20.880]  in investment.
[1:21:20.880 --> 1:21:21.880]  Yeah.
[1:21:21.880 --> 1:21:22.880]  And of course in New Zealand, what did they do?
[1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:27.880]  The biggest city there, Auckland, New Zealand, they completely shut down after about 100
[1:21:27.880 --> 1:21:28.880]  days.
[1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:30.880]  They hadn't had a single, even positive test case.
[1:21:30.880 --> 1:21:33.880]  They found a family of three or four people who tested positive.
[1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:35.880]  They shut down and locked down the entire.
[1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:36.880]  So one person has it.
[1:21:36.880 --> 1:21:37.880]  You shut everything down.
[1:21:37.880 --> 1:21:39.880]  The idea is no one's allowed to have a cold.
[1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:41.880]  Now that's the perfect takeover plan.
[1:21:41.880 --> 1:21:42.880]  Yeah.
[1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:43.880]  All right.
[1:21:43.880 --> 1:21:46.880]  We've got the special broadcast tomorrow.
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:48.880]  40 hours kicking off at 8am with David Knight in the morning.
[1:21:48.880 --> 1:21:49.880]  It's a powerful show.
[1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:51.880]  And I know you know this listeners, but listen to me.
[1:21:51.880 --> 1:21:53.880]  Everything is about censorship.
[1:21:53.880 --> 1:21:57.880]  When you get upset, when you get active, when you share the links to the David Knight show
[1:21:57.880 --> 1:22:03.880]  from 2020ElectionCenter.com or the Alex Jones show or the War Room with Troyer or Election
[1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:05.880]  Countdown with John Lennon Rain and others weeknights.
[1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:08.880]  Harrison Smith, that's how you change the world.
[1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:10.880]  They can't get away with what they're doing.
[1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:11.880]  And if you're there.
[1:22:11.880 --> 1:22:16.880]  We built this infrastructure for you and for ourselves, for you to call in to have guests
[1:22:16.880 --> 1:22:19.880]  and to be able to put out this information and challenge them.
[1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:22.880]  They're censoring the president's tweets now saying, don't be afraid.
[1:22:22.880 --> 1:22:24.880]  We can come together, reopen America.
[1:22:24.880 --> 1:22:26.880]  This is a criminal takeover.
[1:22:26.880 --> 1:22:31.880]  So all of you tell folks about that local radio station you're listening to every day.
[1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:34.880]  Tell folks about the local TV station you're watching and tell folks about band.video.
[1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:37.880]  Now band.video is banned on Twitter to share the URL.
[1:22:37.880 --> 1:22:38.880]  So 2020ElectionCenter.com.
[1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:41.880]  Last time I checked that URL is not banned.
[1:22:41.880 --> 1:22:45.880]  Whatever you do, just to understand people are hungry.
[1:22:45.880 --> 1:22:47.880]  They're thirsty for the truth right now.
[1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:49.880]  And now is the time.
[1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:53.880]  People are asking me, what's up with the summit.news shirt?
[1:22:53.880 --> 1:22:56.880]  Well, I mean, in case they shut us down, I help Paul set up summit.news.
[1:22:56.880 --> 1:22:57.880]  It's his site.
[1:22:57.880 --> 1:22:59.880]  And I'm proud of it.
[1:22:59.880 --> 1:23:03.880]  And I get to the point where I don't want to even pay Paul because we don't have the money to do it.
[1:23:03.880 --> 1:23:05.880]  I tell Paul, go make some t-shirts.
[1:23:05.880 --> 1:23:06.880]  Paul's busy.
[1:23:06.880 --> 1:23:07.880]  Never really does it.
[1:23:07.880 --> 1:23:11.880]  I just sell t-shirts so that Paul can fund the finance summit.news.
[1:23:11.880 --> 1:23:14.880]  Get some more riders, some more people and pass the baton on.
[1:23:14.880 --> 1:23:19.880]  Not that I'm going away, but part of being 46 years old and doing this 26 years is,
[1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:23.880]  you got your elders like David Knight and my dad that work here up there and I'm in the middle.
[1:23:23.880 --> 1:23:24.880]  You bring in new people.
[1:23:24.880 --> 1:23:26.880]  That's what the civilization of humans does.
[1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:28.880]  So that's why we support summit.news.
[1:23:28.880 --> 1:23:30.880]  So buyer Navy Blue.
[1:23:30.880 --> 1:23:31.880]  Beautiful.
[1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:32.880]  I love it.
[1:23:32.880 --> 1:23:33.880]  Summit.news in the back.
[1:23:33.880 --> 1:23:35.880]  It's got the Union Jack there.
[1:23:35.880 --> 1:23:38.880]  We really support England standing up for sovereignty against the EU.
[1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:42.880]  And it's got summit.news in the front and summit.news on the back.
[1:23:42.880 --> 1:23:45.880]  And that helps fund Paul Joseph Watson into the future.
[1:23:45.880 --> 1:23:46.880]  David Knight, amazing job.
[1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:47.880]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[1:23:47.880 --> 1:23:48.880]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:49.880]  Thank you.
[1:23:49.880 --> 1:23:50.880]  Donald Reign coming up.
[1:23:50.880 --> 1:23:54.880]  The globalists are very, very honest about their planetary goals.
[1:23:54.880 --> 1:24:01.880]  They want private corporate governance above nation states, above religious institutions,
[1:24:01.880 --> 1:24:03.880]  above the family.
[1:24:03.880 --> 1:24:06.880]  They want total corporate power.
[1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:11.880]  There was a great film back in the early 1970s called Roller Ball with James Cahn.
[1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:15.880]  And it's based on a novel set in the year 2020.
[1:24:15.880 --> 1:24:19.880]  And in the book, you have megacorporates that control the planet.
[1:24:19.880 --> 1:24:22.880]  And there are no longer nation states.
[1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:27.880]  There are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations.
[1:24:27.880 --> 1:24:34.880]  You actually read what the Deimos group of the CFR and Dr. Lionel commission say in the year 2020, that is their end game.
[1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:35.880]  That is their goal.
[1:24:35.880 --> 1:24:43.880]  So we're talking about a hunger games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless people to see us as a shadow.
[1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:47.880]  They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy and communist China as their model.
[1:24:47.880 --> 1:24:49.880]  We must reject it now.
[1:24:49.880 --> 1:24:58.880]  The Renaissance, the great enlightenment, it's all being swept away and being replaced by scientific tyranny.
[1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:11.880]  That's establishing a form of planetary digital law where the technocrats are above the law and the public isn't even considered to be as valuable as a cow.
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:16.880]  In fact, humans are seen as garbage that's going to be taken out and removed.
[1:25:16.880 --> 1:25:19.880]  That is the post human extermination plan.
[1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:31.880]  That is the public ideology of the globalist and everything they've built with this high tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed.
[1:25:31.880 --> 1:25:40.880]  And any future generations that happen to straggle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans once were.
[1:25:40.880 --> 1:25:47.880]  This is the satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation, humanity.
[1:25:47.880 --> 1:25:49.880]  This is the essence of evil.
[1:25:49.880 --> 1:25:56.880]  If you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and control them to a man and to a woman,
[1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:02.880]  they believe there's too many people on the earth and they constantly whine about when they want to go to a mountain top or an actual park,
[1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:04.880]  they have to look at us, the common people.
[1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:07.880]  They have to look at the proletariat, they have to look at the scum.
[1:26:07.880 --> 1:26:10.880]  That's why they love the lockdown, putting muzzles on us.
[1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:14.880]  That gives them a big thrill, controlling where we can go, what we can do.
[1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:17.880]  Bankrupting Main Street, bankrupting small towns.
[1:26:17.880 --> 1:26:27.880]  All of it is a vertical integration, consolidation, so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender, which is taking sterile vaccines day one.
[1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:31.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, all the games are over, playtime's over.
[1:26:31.880 --> 1:26:36.880]  They used all the entertainment and garbage to put us into a trance and now the spiders moving in for the kill.
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:39.880]  You know this, I know this, it's all out in the open.
[1:26:39.880 --> 1:26:41.880]  The question is, what are we going to do about it?
[1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:43.880]  Well, the first thing is identify the enemy.
[1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:48.880]  Identify the enemy, identify the enemy, identify your enemy now.
[1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:55.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:11.880]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:18.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:28.880]  We're gonna go.
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:36.880]  You're listening to the future.
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:38.880]  All right, here's what I'm going to do.
[1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:40.880]  We've got some guests coming up.
[1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:42.880]  I've got so much to cover.
[1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:44.880]  I've seen the guests list and 40-hour broadcasts we're going to do.
[1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:48.800]  and when it's the David Knight show, my show or Olin's broadcast, those are tailored for
[1:27:48.800 --> 1:27:49.800]  radio and TV stations.
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:53.080]  So you have 14 minutes of ads an hour, which is a standard.
[1:27:53.080 --> 1:27:57.320]  But during all the rest of the 40 hour broadcast, we'll air some promos, some breaks for folks
[1:27:57.320 --> 1:27:59.280]  to go to the bathroom or for other hosts to come in.
[1:27:59.280 --> 1:28:02.240]  But it's going to be basically live, nonstop, commercial free.
[1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:07.760]  We'll have some promos and news reports and we've just got so many big guests joining
[1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:08.760]  us.
[1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:11.480]  So I'm very, very excited about tomorrow, really looking forward to it.
[1:28:11.480 --> 1:28:16.680]  And, you know, we haven't done in a couple of years a big fundraiser like this, a money
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:18.520]  bomb.
[1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:23.200]  But with all the Democrat funded lawsuits and all the deep state, the platforming and
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:29.480]  the rest of it, we need to raise money to be assured that we can operate into the middle
[1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:30.920]  of next year.
[1:28:30.920 --> 1:28:34.560]  And so you guys have kept us on there, you've done an incredible job.
[1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:37.880]  When I see how the information we put out gets picked up by the White House, other major
[1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:42.200]  governments, we're really a countervailing voice and we're very respected.
[1:28:42.200 --> 1:28:46.560]  We've gone from being serious with some people, but a joke to others to being seen as very,
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:47.560]  very serious.
[1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:48.560]  I screw around, have some fun.
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:52.560]  They always cherry picked that and put that out, try to hurt us, but God works in mysterious
[1:28:52.560 --> 1:28:53.560]  ways.
[1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:59.320]  And it seems like our satire and our occasional fun once a week gets picked up by the media.
[1:28:59.320 --> 1:29:02.320]  That ends up bringing us more people.
[1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:13.160]  And so it's been amazing and it's been incredible being here on air with all of you and going
[1:29:13.160 --> 1:29:14.920]  through all of this together.
[1:29:14.920 --> 1:29:15.920]  Like Mark Dice.
[1:29:15.920 --> 1:29:28.720]  I mean, my gosh, I've known Mark Dice since 2005, 2004.
[1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:33.760]  Now Trump's saying we need to repeal Section 230 that gives liability protection to big
[1:29:33.760 --> 1:29:35.320]  tech and allows them to do all this.
[1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:36.320]  Absolutely.
[1:29:36.320 --> 1:29:38.680]  And there's Mark Dice just got tweeted by Trump.
[1:29:38.680 --> 1:29:43.680]  We don't stop this, won't be much longer until people are banned from even owning a
[1:29:43.680 --> 1:29:48.320]  cell phone that big tech doesn't like, but they talk about and text without their friends.
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:52.880]  Man, Mark Dice is so smart, man, when you know him about the scenes, he's very humble.
[1:29:52.880 --> 1:29:55.200]  He's very hard to get on a live show.
[1:29:55.200 --> 1:30:00.400]  He finally is doing his own tape shows, but they're, they're like taped to air.
[1:30:00.400 --> 1:30:05.040]  I mean, they're basically live interviews them from his kitchen, which he was doing
[1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:06.720]  like 15 years ago or whatever now.
[1:30:06.720 --> 1:30:10.840]  Now finally the media has caught up to how cool it is to tape your kitchen.
[1:30:10.840 --> 1:30:12.240]  What's crazy is I've been in that kitchen.
[1:30:12.240 --> 1:30:14.760]  He's been in the same apartment forever in San Diego.
[1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:20.280]  So he's coming up next hour and we're really excited about that, but man, every globalist
[1:30:20.280 --> 1:30:23.800]  agenda there is, they are bringing it in with this.
[1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:27.320]  It's all been preplanned and then here's what's crazier.
[1:30:27.320 --> 1:30:28.320]  Obviously we see it's preplanned.
[1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:29.320]  We know it's preplanned.
[1:30:29.320 --> 1:30:35.640]  You know it's preplanned, but then they admit it's preplanned and it's like super uncool.
[1:30:35.640 --> 1:30:45.240]  But see to a Bezos or a Zuckerberg or a, or a Rockefeller, you know, all that's going
[1:30:45.240 --> 1:30:52.440]  down of all that's, wow, that's a big story is print that for me with all that unfolding.
[1:30:52.440 --> 1:30:57.200]  They can't have us on air when we've been proven so incredibly right.
[1:30:57.200 --> 1:30:59.480]  And so that's why it's such a stick in their eye.
[1:30:59.480 --> 1:31:02.360]  It's such a thumb in their eye.
[1:31:02.360 --> 1:31:04.040]  It's such a brick upside their head.
[1:31:04.040 --> 1:31:06.960]  It's such a punch in the nose to the new world order.
[1:31:06.960 --> 1:31:08.880]  Hell, let's get their kneecaps broken.
[1:31:08.880 --> 1:31:10.120]  Let's get their intestines torn out.
[1:31:10.120 --> 1:31:17.440]  I mean, the fact that, I mean, Bill Gates is universally the most hated man in the world.
[1:31:17.440 --> 1:31:27.480]  And all this PR can't buy him escape from that and who he is and what he wants to pull.
[1:31:27.480 --> 1:31:29.880]  And so, yeah, they're screwing us over.
[1:31:29.880 --> 1:31:32.200]  They're hurting us bad, but we're, we're fight back.
[1:31:32.200 --> 1:31:36.160]  So don't think in this fight, we're getting licked.
[1:31:36.160 --> 1:31:37.760]  We're giving way better than they're giving.
[1:31:37.760 --> 1:31:39.880]  And we're just getting started and the enemy scared.
[1:31:39.880 --> 1:31:42.640]  Let me tell you, I know the globalist.
[1:31:42.640 --> 1:31:43.640]  I know who they are.
[1:31:43.640 --> 1:31:44.640]  I know how they operate.
[1:31:44.640 --> 1:31:45.640]  And I see fear in their eyes.
[1:31:45.640 --> 1:31:46.640]  That's good.
[1:31:46.640 --> 1:31:47.640]  They're sold out at the devil.
[1:31:47.640 --> 1:31:48.640]  They're sellouts.
[1:31:48.640 --> 1:31:49.640]  They're weak.
[1:31:49.640 --> 1:31:50.640]  They're pathetic.
[1:31:50.640 --> 1:31:54.160]  Let's go to the special John Bown report.
[1:31:54.160 --> 1:31:57.720]  The COVID fiends demand sacrifice.
[1:31:57.720 --> 1:31:59.960]  We'll go to that in a little while.
[1:31:59.960 --> 1:32:03.440]  Then we're going to come back and we've got our special guests coming up.
[1:32:03.440 --> 1:32:04.440]  We've got Mark Dice.
[1:32:04.440 --> 1:32:07.920]  We've got so much more here today.
[1:32:07.920 --> 1:32:11.920]  Infowars.com, NewsWars.com, Band.video.
[1:32:11.920 --> 1:32:15.320]  2020ElectionCenter.com is just a clone of that.
[1:32:15.320 --> 1:32:20.800]  You're actually able to share and it doesn't get you flagged or whatever for now, 2020ElectionCenter.com.
[1:32:20.800 --> 1:32:26.560]  Here is the very important report to the John Bown section of Band.video, the COVID fiends
[1:32:26.560 --> 1:32:27.960]  demand sacrifice.
[1:32:27.960 --> 1:32:31.800]  I researched bio weapons and all sorts of stuff and masks.
[1:32:31.800 --> 1:32:36.000]  And I'm going to tell you, in my entire professional career, I've never heard anybody actually
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:41.040]  believe that these kind of, any kind of masks, short of an actual level four containment
[1:32:41.040 --> 1:32:43.840]  suit, made a difference to small particle viruses.
[1:32:43.840 --> 1:32:46.000]  And I told you this was all coming.
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:49.560]  And already the COVID shutdown is annihilating the worldwide economy.
[1:32:49.560 --> 1:32:54.200]  The coronavirus pandemic is about to bring on a wave of bankruptcies in 2020.
[1:32:54.200 --> 1:32:58.280]  Big apparel brands and department stores like J.Crew, Brooks Brothers, Neiman Marcus and
[1:32:58.280 --> 1:32:59.280]  J.C.
[1:32:59.280 --> 1:33:02.040]  Penny, all filed for bankruptcy to reorganize their businesses.
[1:33:02.040 --> 1:33:05.000]  But it's not just the retail sector that's suffering.
[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:07.520]  Bankruptcies now ripple through almost every industry.
[1:33:07.520 --> 1:33:08.520]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[1:33:08.520 --> 1:33:10.080]  I tell you the supply chain is breaking down.
[1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:14.580]  When I tell you, our big food supplier actually has the food and all the other places are
[1:33:14.580 --> 1:33:16.560]  sold out and they're trying to buy food months and months out.
[1:33:16.560 --> 1:33:18.740]  The price has already gone up 20, 30 percent.
[1:33:18.740 --> 1:33:23.040]  I mean, this is really going on and they're really coming in Australia.
[1:33:23.040 --> 1:33:24.040]  Hit back!
[1:33:24.040 --> 1:33:25.040]  Why are you arresting them?
[1:33:25.040 --> 1:33:26.520]  What's the matter with them?
[1:33:26.520 --> 1:33:27.520]  Hit back!
[1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:28.520]  Hit back!
[1:33:28.520 --> 1:33:29.520]  Hit back!
[1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:30.520]  Hit back!
[1:33:30.520 --> 1:33:31.520]  Hit back!
[1:33:31.520 --> 1:33:32.520]  Hit back!
[1:33:32.520 --> 1:33:33.520]  Hit back!
[1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:34.520]  Hit back!
[1:33:34.520 --> 1:33:35.520]  Hit back!
[1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:36.520]  Hit back!
[1:33:36.520 --> 1:33:37.520]  Hit back!
[1:33:37.520 --> 1:33:38.520]  Hit back!
[1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:39.520]  Hit back!
[1:33:39.520 --> 1:33:54.200]  There will literally be hundreds and hundreds, indeed the entire team is 1,000 strong door
[1:33:54.200 --> 1:34:00.520]  knockers out there talking to the community, inviting them to come and get a free test,
[1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:06.320]  whether they be symptomatic or asymptomatic, that will be done in lots of new ways.
[1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:09.520]  And if you don't, you can't leave your house and they're going to make it a waiting list
[1:34:09.520 --> 1:34:11.760]  to get it. And there's a lot of people bought into the fear.
[1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:17.480]  Ben in particular felt he had to live his life at a million miles an hour so that he
[1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:20.480]  didn't have to stop and let those demons come into his head.
[1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:32.160]  This is Chris Brown. Two months ago, his son Ben took his own life. He was 22, studying engineering
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:35.000]  and months away from starting with the army.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:40.360]  Lockdown, of course, gave him a lot of opportunities. I'm afraid to just sit on his bed, lie on
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:43.200]  his bed and let those demons play with his mind.
[1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:47.520]  There's been a significant spike in domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic and
[1:34:47.520 --> 1:34:52.400]  now United Nations report is warning that the number of cases could increase. The report
[1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:56.840]  says six months of stay at home measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 could lead to
[1:34:56.840 --> 1:35:00.680]  31 million more cases of domestic violence around the world.
[1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:08.040]  The United Nations officials official called it a growing crisis within the crisis.
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:12.880]  A knock at the door just past 6.30 Friday night, two men mass pull below their mouths
[1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:15.600]  outside Anna's home near Southwestern College.
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:16.840]  Can I help you?
[1:35:16.840 --> 1:35:23.040]  Anna's question through her ring doorbell gets an odd reply.
[1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:25.840]  Moments later, the man at the door makes his pitch.
[1:35:25.840 --> 1:35:30.840]  I was looking at it for the Queen of the Council. We're out doing COVID testing. Have you checked
[1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:31.840]  yet?
[1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:34.480]  Anna, an ICU social worker, sends something shady.
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:42.040]  What they're really after is your personal information. It ends up with someone divulging
[1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:48.880]  their credit card or debit card or under other information and then nothing ever arrived.
[1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:53.720]  It's all weird fetishizing that, oh, you're heroes because you were the master saving
[1:35:53.720 --> 1:35:57.680]  lives and it's like, oh, just wear the mask, oh, just take the inoculation, oh, just have
[1:35:57.680 --> 1:36:02.440]  the tracker chip, oh, just have the tracker app, oh, just be a hero.
[1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:05.640]  And then Pelosi comes out two months ago and goes, he will be fumigated out of the White
[1:36:05.640 --> 1:36:07.040]  House one way or other.
[1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:09.040]  And then they start saying, oh, the military needs to remove him.
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:10.040]  The military says, we won't do that.
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:11.520]  They go, oh, Trump wants the military.
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:14.800]  Then they're going to hold up the election with the ballots.
[1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:20.600]  And then on January 20th, if Trump hasn't won the election, clearly she will vote at
[1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:23.760]  the House of Representatives and install who she wants.
[1:36:23.760 --> 1:36:26.880]  And they've got it all fired up right now.
[1:36:26.880 --> 1:36:28.880]  No one gives you power yet to take it from them.
[1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:30.880]  That's what Pelosi famously said.
[1:36:30.880 --> 1:36:35.080]  All right, I'm going to lay something really heavy on you.
[1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:37.080]  You heard of magic?
[1:36:37.080 --> 1:36:39.560]  I'll tell you what real magic is when we come back.
[1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:40.560]  I'm going to tell you a big secret.
[1:36:40.560 --> 1:36:44.080]  I think now it's time to start unlocking the secret weapons.
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:45.080]  We'll be right back.
[1:36:45.080 --> 1:36:46.080]  Stay with us.
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:55.200]  The Bible talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the nation states
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:37:01.000]  and who give their power unto the one world leader, the Antichrist, and he has a beast
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:05.960]  system that no one can buy and or sell unless he has that marked in the forehead or in the
[1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:06.960]  palm of their hand.
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:12.960]  And we look back on all the warnings you were given and all just the common sense that
[1:37:12.960 --> 1:37:18.680]  you don't believe in God or prophecy, giving governments and corporations the power to
[1:37:18.680 --> 1:37:21.920]  control who can buy and who can sell to track everything we do.
[1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:23.440]  It's not just a recipe.
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:28.520]  It's a blueprint for total enslavement and now you look at Bill Gates, you look at Bloomberg
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:31.640]  and others who openly say we're technocrats.
[1:37:31.640 --> 1:37:35.840]  We should decide how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get, how much red meat you
[1:37:35.840 --> 1:37:36.840]  get.
[1:37:36.840 --> 1:37:37.840]  We're technocrats.
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:38.840]  We know best.
[1:37:38.840 --> 1:37:42.040]  We're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control you.
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:43.040]  You snap your fingers.
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:44.040]  We're here.
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:48.040]  They're just rolling it out and a lot of people are complying with it.
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:49.040]  It's insane.
[1:37:49.040 --> 1:38:04.040]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:38:04.040 --> 1:38:15.560]  The Info Wars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened.
[1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:20.320]  Because we are effective, the great awakening is here.
[1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:27.040]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:51.040]  The information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:56.360]  For more than 100 years, the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government,
[1:38:56.360 --> 1:39:01.680]  abolish nation states, dumb down the population by taking control of education and most importantly
[1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:04.600]  taking control of western medicine.
[1:39:04.600 --> 1:39:07.400]  Now they had a bad name by the 1920s.
[1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:12.480]  They started converting over and funding other organizations and groups like IBM to continue
[1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:15.960]  on with their eugenics operations.
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:21.880]  Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors
[1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:25.920]  to Bill Gates III, his father of course being ahead of Planned Parenthood.
[1:39:25.920 --> 1:39:30.920]  And now he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the
[1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:33.920]  world, every national health system.
[1:39:33.920 --> 1:39:35.920]  Bill Gates is in control.
[1:39:35.920 --> 1:39:41.520]  They have spent 100 plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your
[1:39:41.520 --> 1:39:43.920]  body and what goes in your body.
[1:39:43.920 --> 1:39:48.640]  This is the holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing, putting a new
[1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:50.960]  type of DNA in your body.
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:57.480]  The future isn't coming, it's here, and in the future, keeping your humanity, saving
[1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:02.640]  your soul, your integrity, your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset.
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:08.960]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset, the world being built by the technocrats and
[1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:14.360]  the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:22.920]  of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization.
[1:40:22.920 --> 1:40:28.880]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:29.880]  2050.
[1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:31.880]  This is their stated goal.
[1:40:31.880 --> 1:40:38.440]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror
[1:40:38.440 --> 1:40:42.440]  and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy when we turn this around.
[1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:47.440]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips
[1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:48.440]  with it.
[1:40:48.440 --> 1:40:53.440]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[1:40:53.440 --> 1:41:21.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:35.360]  Let me play this out, and let me explain why the enemy is so into the occult, so into what
[1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:39.720]  they call magic and the unseen, because ancients didn't understand all the electromagnetic
[1:41:39.720 --> 1:41:43.400]  wavelengths, the other dimensions, the dark matter, all of it, but they were trying to
[1:41:43.400 --> 1:41:44.400]  figure it out.
[1:41:44.400 --> 1:41:47.000]  They knew it was there because they saw it, they understood it.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:49.680]  They knew about the sixth sense, they understood it.
[1:41:49.680 --> 1:41:55.160]  I'll just go ahead and tell you some personal stories about this, but first off, you see
[1:41:55.160 --> 1:41:59.760]  a man dressed like a woman, calling himself a woman, stealing the identity of a woman,
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:06.240]  but he really looks like a vampire, and he's simulating cutting a baby out of his stomach
[1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:11.520]  and drinking his blood and reveling it, and the media proposes this is, oh, look at this
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:12.840]  great art.
[1:42:12.840 --> 1:42:16.000]  Their culture is the destruction of our children.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:17.960]  That is their ritual against God.
[1:42:17.960 --> 1:42:22.880]  It's not just a baby they're killing, it's the entire genetic memory of two different
[1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:27.960]  people that came together to form that with all those instincts and all those memories
[1:42:27.960 --> 1:42:37.960]  in a very deep form of Congress that is even beyond a new human being created.
[1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:44.880]  It's interdimensional, it is magic, it is truly powerful, it's God at work.
[1:42:44.880 --> 1:42:48.560]  So I didn't understand this when I was like five years old, and my dad's dad, who was
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:53.840]  a very nice, good person, but very masculine and very shawmatic type person, like everybody
[1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:55.960]  like, this is a leader right here.
[1:42:55.960 --> 1:42:58.880]  And when he was dying, a cancer, he called me in there, and he was dying, and he grabbed
[1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:02.120]  my hand, he did this to my dad and other people, and he said, basically, I'm going to be with
[1:43:02.120 --> 1:43:07.480]  you ever, I'm going with you, I'm transferring myself to you, and it wasn't like his ghost
[1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:11.120]  doing it, it was a interdimensional psychic.
[1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:15.000]  The best way to describe it, everything in Hollywood is a copy or a twisting of what's
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:17.600]  actually real, it's like a Vulcan mind-milk.
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:21.040]  And so that happened, and right after that happened, I was like, all of a sudden having
[1:43:21.040 --> 1:43:27.400]  like memories of an adult and all these things, and it was a major psychic imprint, of course
[1:43:27.400 --> 1:43:30.760]  the guys around, my grandfather and my grandmother were like, whoa, because they weren't your
[1:43:30.760 --> 1:43:32.920]  probably your average bear either.
[1:43:32.920 --> 1:43:39.120]  And so that went on, and then on my other side of the family, he died about six years
[1:43:39.120 --> 1:43:45.760]  ago, my mom's brother, when I was like 12 years old, one summer down there visiting
[1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:53.560]  him, and I'm in his garage, he said, they're working on a car, and I'm talking about politics
[1:43:53.560 --> 1:43:56.920]  and things, and he kind of got me, he said, let me tell you how it really is, but it wasn't
[1:43:56.920 --> 1:44:02.200]  what he said, it was at the time he like imprinted his will on, and I remember always
[1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:06.120]  thinking that, like what I did politically after that, the things, and a little five
[1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:10.200]  minute speech about the New World Order, but then about a year before he died, I told part
[1:44:10.200 --> 1:44:16.360]  of the story where we're driving around the ranch, he moved out to the countryside, and
[1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:20.240]  I'm sitting there driving, and he goes, listen, let me tell you something, there's a time
[1:44:20.240 --> 1:44:24.080]  when everybody decides which side they're going to be on, and you finally make that
[1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:29.560]  decision when it gets so bad, and he grabbed me and told me about the government and child
[1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:34.680]  trafficking and what he saw working secret operations for the army, and when he looked
[1:44:34.680 --> 1:44:38.440]  at me, he was really scary looking, it wasn't evil looking, it was just very, did not look
[1:44:38.440 --> 1:44:42.920]  like, it was like really scary looking, and it was because he said, you know, a long
[1:44:42.920 --> 1:44:48.760]  time ago, I, I, I, you understand this already, I like imprinted my will onto you, and he
[1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:52.320]  goes, and he basically said, there's stuff coming up, I don't know how long I'm going
[1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:56.920]  to be here, but I'm meeting with some people, because they were involved against Obama
[1:44:56.920 --> 1:45:00.240]  and stuff, I mean, I don't even know what was going on folks, and they probably killed
[1:45:00.240 --> 1:45:06.560]  him, but the point is, is that he literally said, you're going to carry the bishop out,
[1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:15.280]  now imagine the enemy hands down their stuff to their people too, but that's all like a
[1:45:15.280 --> 1:45:21.480]  psychic measuring, and that's why they want to put this crap into our DNA, it's why they
[1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:25.800]  want to block off our ancestral memories, because that just wasn't my grandfather, that
[1:45:25.800 --> 1:45:35.800]  wasn't my uncle, that was all those people wanting victory for our species, so they may
[1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:40.040]  have their 5G and their Satan worship, and they may have all their crap, and they're
[1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:44.520]  killing kids and all of it, and they're demons that work for them, but we got God, and there's
[1:45:44.520 --> 1:45:52.800]  a lot of stuff that isn't in your books, there's a lot of stuff that's, that's, that's not
[1:45:52.800 --> 1:46:00.160]  there, and I just want to say, all of us carry the strength of our ancestors, and there's
[1:46:00.160 --> 1:46:03.600]  people that understand that and are conscious of it, and that's what America's strength
[1:46:03.600 --> 1:46:08.520]  is all about, is that America is a group of people that believe in humanity, and actually
[1:46:08.520 --> 1:46:15.440]  believe in Christ, and are generationally committed, my grandmother before she died
[1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:21.560]  gave me the same damn speech, and I was like, you know, I've never read this stuff in books,
[1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:30.200]  I've never seen this stuff anywhere, I think people need to know about this, because they're
[1:46:30.200 --> 1:46:35.440]  alive inside of us, and they are passing on that power, that's, that's, that God gave
[1:46:35.440 --> 1:46:40.400]  them, and that gave all those people behind them, that baton, is that spirit, you think
[1:46:40.400 --> 1:46:44.400]  about a mother with a baby, and loving and taking care of it, and parents, and all the
[1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:49.680]  things they do, and every person before them, it's the same touch, all that love is transmitted
[1:46:49.680 --> 1:46:54.120]  forward through each family, so whether you had somebody a thousand years ago or ten thousand
[1:46:54.120 --> 1:46:59.280]  years ago that did something or saw something, all of that is literally like electricity
[1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:05.480]  going into the future connected to everything before it, intimately, you're just as related
[1:47:05.480 --> 1:47:08.600]  to your great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandmother as you are to your
[1:47:08.600 --> 1:47:16.080]  mama, more so, because everything she was has been filtered through now into the future,
[1:47:16.080 --> 1:47:20.840]  and arcing out with that knowledge to give you that vision, and so everything the enemy
[1:47:20.840 --> 1:47:29.960]  does is about breaking off that connection, and stopping that, and that's going to fail,
[1:47:29.960 --> 1:47:34.160]  the devil is going to make his play, and a lot of folks are going to die, but let me
[1:47:34.160 --> 1:47:39.920]  tell you, humanity is going to win, and so I just want Satan, and all of his minions,
[1:47:39.920 --> 1:47:44.600]  and all of his servants to know, you're a loser, you know you're a loser, your servants
[1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:51.560]  are losers, and you will, and have been defeated already, and so this is a speech to myself
[1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:55.360]  as much as any of you, because I get down watching all this, and knowing what's happening,
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:59.880]  and want to try to stop it, you know what, but David Knight said, made me decide to tell
[1:47:59.880 --> 1:48:06.360]  you this, big truth, when he said, he is his job is following God's orders, and there's
[1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:16.280]  a great surrender to that, stop worrying, you know God's right, do the right thing,
[1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:21.480]  and let God take control of it, because the enemy has, they're definitely under Satan's
[1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:26.560]  control, they turn themselves over to Satan completely, and you can see it out in the
[1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:35.840]  open now, but imagine turning yourself over to Christ, imagine really doing it, and I
[1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:39.840]  just wish I could have asked my uncle like, who taught you this, or my grandfather, two
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:48.320]  different sides of the family, same thing, but that's the spirit, the spirit knew on
[1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:53.200]  both sides of my family, or maybe they did well, I don't know, but they certainly said,
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:57.040]  I mean my mom's dad said, he was never like this to anybody, he was like, you're going
[1:48:57.040 --> 1:49:00.080]  to do great things, you're going to do these huge things, and I was like, what are you
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:04.560]  doing, this is really weird, but you're telling me, I just know I've prayed about it, and
[1:49:04.560 --> 1:49:11.920]  it's real folks, like what was the name of the guy, Wes, you're able to find it, Wes
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:17.920]  Curtis, another Wes, literally sat there 20 years ago, 23 years ago, in a diner at night
[1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:22.200]  and said, there'll be a world government with a force inoculation that rewrites your DNA
[1:49:22.200 --> 1:49:25.600]  and makes you a genetically modified creature, that's four months, sand, tail, and terminator
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:33.720]  genes were even news, and I said, how do you know this is my preacher, had a vision, and
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:38.720]  he was so sure it was the same type of feeling, wasn't like he was imprinting with his knowledge,
[1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:44.800]  he was just saying, this is how it is, and if you take the mark, it literally rewrites
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:52.080]  yourselves, where you can't even connect with God, the devil has this all figured out folks,
[1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:57.480]  but so does God, before the devil even existed, all we got to do is choose God, but God can
[1:49:57.480 --> 1:50:03.640]  do one thing, that's anything, and what's the one thing that a true omnipresent
[1:50:03.640 --> 1:50:08.160]  creature would have to deal with, creating new omnipresent creatures, but in a baby
[1:50:08.160 --> 1:50:12.480]  form, that have free will, and because you give them free will, they could be deceived
[1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:18.800]  and taken into evil, and that's really the great mystery answer to why God does this.
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:22.040]  All right, I'm done talking about that, we got Mark Dice come up with his new book, he'll
[1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:25.120]  announce the name of it, it's a big deal on the show, we're glad he's launching it here,

[1:53:43.440 --> 1:53:54.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:54.080 --> 1:53:58.800]  According to the former FBI director, Jim Comey, abuse of power by the top brass at
[1:53:58.800 --> 1:54:05.280]  the FBI is how doing it by the book is done at the top law enforcement agency in the world.
[1:54:05.280 --> 1:54:20.960]  Mr. Comey, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the top of the line, how would you rate
[1:54:20.960 --> 1:54:29.000]  the Crossfire Hurricane investigation in terms of being done thoroughly by the book and investigation
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:30.560]  the FBI should be proud of?
[1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:36.040]  I'm not sure I can apply a number scale, but I would say in the main it was done by the
[1:54:36.040 --> 1:54:39.880]  book, it was appropriate and it was essential that it be done.
[1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:46.120]  Did you know that Mr. Kleinsmith doctored the email support to read that there was no
[1:54:46.120 --> 1:54:52.480]  association between Page and the CIA, that he changed there was to there was not?
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:54.480]  How do you feel about that?
[1:54:54.480 --> 1:54:58.000]  I know nothing about Mr. Kleinsmith, other than what I've read in the public records.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:04.680]  How do you feel in general about an FBI lawyer doctoring information at Sculptory to somebody
[1:55:04.680 --> 1:55:07.480]  being surveilled?
[1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:10.000]  Any false statement in the course of an investigation is deep.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:12.720]  But you didn't know anything about that.
[1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:19.160]  The Crossfire Hurricane, Crossfire Razor investigations, I think it really shaken confidence in the
[1:55:19.160 --> 1:55:24.880]  system and my goal as chairman and this will go into the next Congress no matter who's
[1:55:24.880 --> 1:55:27.680]  in charge Senator Feinstein.
[1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:33.320]  Because if FISA needs to be reauthorized, but right now without substantial reform,
[1:55:33.320 --> 1:55:35.720]  I don't think we could get it reauthorized.
[1:55:35.720 --> 1:55:40.160]  It took four years to gather them, but all of the pieces have been found regarding the
[1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:42.680]  deep state corruption jigsaw puzzle.
[1:55:42.680 --> 1:55:48.680]  The Russian collusion hoax instigated by power mad demon Hillary Clinton has been completely
[1:55:48.680 --> 1:55:49.680]  unearthed.
[1:55:49.680 --> 1:55:56.120]  It is now known that the CIA asked the FBI in 2016 to investigate whether Hillary Clinton
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:56:02.160]  had approved a plot to distract former email crimes by, quote, stirring up a scandal claiming
[1:56:02.160 --> 1:56:08.440]  interference by Russian security services, end quote, according to newly declassified
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:09.440]  information.
[1:56:09.440 --> 1:56:14.360]  Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee
[1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:20.960]  explaining that the CIA's referral had been given to top FBI leadership, including former
[1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:26.760]  director James Comey and deputy assistant director of counterintelligence Peter Struck.
[1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:33.320]  And as Jamie White wrote, the CIA had ironically learned of the allegations from Russian intelligence
[1:56:33.320 --> 1:56:38.560]  claiming Clinton had approved a campaign plan to stir up a scandal against US presidential
[1:56:38.560 --> 1:56:43.560]  candidate Donald Trump by tying him to Putin and the Russians hacking of the Democratic
[1:56:43.560 --> 1:56:44.880]  National Committee.
[1:56:44.880 --> 1:56:49.240]  This is a scandal about what was a coup planned against the incoming administration at the
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:50.840]  highest levels.
[1:56:50.840 --> 1:56:55.920]  And I can report here tonight that these declassifications that have come out, those weren't easy to
[1:56:55.920 --> 1:56:59.600]  get out and there's in fact far more waiting to get out.
[1:56:59.600 --> 1:57:03.800]  Unfortunately, those releases and declassifications, according to multiple sources I've talked
[1:57:03.800 --> 1:57:10.800]  to, are being blocked by CIA director Gina Haspel, who herself was the main link between
[1:57:10.800 --> 1:57:16.080]  Washington and London as the London station chief for John Brennan's CIA during the 2016
[1:57:16.080 --> 1:57:17.080]  election.
[1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:20.240]  So London, where Christopher Steele was doing all this work.
[1:57:20.240 --> 1:57:25.600]  And I'm told that it is Gina Haspel personally who's blocking a continued declassification
[1:57:25.600 --> 1:57:29.600]  of these documents that will show the American people the truth of what actually happened.
[1:57:29.600 --> 1:57:35.360]  Of course, the Democrats continued their disconnected pattern of praying on the gullible, claiming
[1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:39.040]  that impending matters required more attention.
[1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:41.160]  But nothing could be further from the truth.
[1:57:41.160 --> 1:57:49.680]  You know, when we left July 31st of the August recess, they had us scheduled only to come
[1:57:49.680 --> 1:57:53.240]  back in for three out of the next 15 weeks.
[1:57:53.240 --> 1:57:58.840]  That is the best sign of any sign that she has no intention of Congress trying to be helpful
[1:57:58.840 --> 1:58:05.080]  to the country to navigate this pandemic and keep us in as good a position as possible.
[1:58:05.080 --> 1:58:06.960]  It's all about defeating Donald Trump.
[1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:12.440]  And the obstruction continues as Andrew McCabe's attorney said, is it banned on video?
[1:58:12.440 --> 1:58:14.360]  The Comey public show never ends.
[1:58:14.360 --> 1:58:17.120]  Very important report in the John Bown section.
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:18.120]  Go to band on video.
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:19.120]  Click the left hand corner.
[1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:20.120]  You'll see the John Bown channel.
[1:58:20.120 --> 1:58:21.120]  It's all right there.
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:23.120]  But you can't share a band on video on Twitter.
[1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:26.520]  You can only share 2020 election center dot com.
[1:58:26.520 --> 1:58:31.440]  So if we send that link to Mark Dice, hopefully he shares it because he's a king of Twitter
[1:58:31.440 --> 1:58:33.560]  and he's coming up right now with his new book.
[1:58:33.560 --> 1:58:35.120]  He's premiering here today.
[1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:36.120]  We're very honored.
[1:58:36.120 --> 1:58:37.120]  Mark Dice.
[1:58:37.120 --> 1:58:44.600]  So unfiltered live, Mark Dice straight ahead with only 27 days left till the election.
[1:58:44.600 --> 1:58:56.800]  And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications of COVID-19
[1:58:56.800 --> 1:59:04.080]  which are well beyond what they should be, it's estimated that 200 million people have
[1:59:04.080 --> 1:59:08.200]  died probably by the time I finish this talk.
[1:59:08.200 --> 1:59:10.720]  Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar.
[1:59:10.720 --> 1:59:17.680]  Part of the establishment for close to 50 years, but now, boy, as his brain degenerates,
[1:59:17.680 --> 1:59:24.560]  we are seeing walking public dementia on the biggest stage of the world, the 2020 election.
[1:59:24.560 --> 1:59:27.560]  There are 370 million people in the United States.
[1:59:27.560 --> 1:59:32.480]  If 200 million died from COVID, that'd be more than half of the population, but not
[1:59:32.480 --> 1:59:35.120]  even one tenth of one percent have actually died.
[1:59:35.120 --> 1:59:40.120]  But him putting these giant lies and these incredibly brain damaged statements out is
[1:59:40.120 --> 1:59:43.520]  emblematic of the general public being in a trance.
[1:59:43.520 --> 1:59:45.680]  How is anyone even putting up with this?
[1:59:45.680 --> 1:59:55.320]  It is beyond bizarre.
[1:59:55.320 --> 1:59:59.440]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[1:59:59.440 --> 2:00:06.440]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:00:06.440 --> 2:00:14.560]  I went out walking through streets paved with gold.
[2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:22.560]  Lifted some stones, saw the skin and bones of a city without a soul.
[2:00:22.560 --> 2:00:34.040]  I went out walking under an atomic sky where the ground won't turn and the rain, it burns
[2:00:34.040 --> 2:00:35.800]  like tears when I...
[2:00:35.800 --> 2:00:38.080]  And it's really something very special.
[2:00:38.080 --> 2:00:41.840]  The doctors, the nurses, the first responders.
[2:00:41.840 --> 2:00:45.280]  And I learned so much about coronavirus.
[2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:50.320]  And one thing that's for certain, don't let it dominate you.
[2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:52.200]  Don't be afraid of it.
[2:00:52.200 --> 2:00:53.200]  You're going to beat it.
[2:00:53.200 --> 2:00:59.240]  We have the best medical equipment, we have the best medicines, all developed recently.
[2:00:59.240 --> 2:01:00.240]  And you're going to beat it.
[2:01:00.240 --> 2:01:02.640]  I went, I didn't feel so good.
[2:01:02.640 --> 2:01:06.240]  And two days ago, I could have left two days ago, two days ago I felt great, like better
[2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:07.600]  than I have in a long time.
[2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:12.920]  I said just recently, better than 20 years ago, don't let it dominate.
[2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:15.120]  Don't let it take over your lives.
[2:01:15.120 --> 2:01:16.120]  Don't let that happen.
[2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:18.280]  We have the greatest country in the world.
[2:01:18.280 --> 2:01:19.280]  We're going back.
[2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:20.280]  We're going back to work.
[2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:23.080]  We're going to be out front, as your leader, I had to do that.
[2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:25.880]  I knew there's danger to it, but I had to do it.
[2:01:25.880 --> 2:01:29.120]  I stood out front, I led.
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:33.000]  Nobody that's a leader would not do what I did.
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:36.520]  And I know there's a risk, there's a danger, but that's okay.
[2:01:36.520 --> 2:01:38.600]  And now I'm better, and maybe I'm immune.
[2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:40.040]  I don't know.
[2:01:40.040 --> 2:01:41.920]  But don't let it dominate your lives.
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:44.240]  Get out there, be careful.
[2:01:44.240 --> 2:01:48.320]  We have the best medicines in the world, and it all happened very shortly, and they're
[2:01:48.320 --> 2:01:53.520]  all getting approved, and the vaccines are coming momentarily.
[2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:54.520]  Thank you very much.
[2:01:54.520 --> 2:01:56.920]  And Walter Reed, what a group of people.
[2:01:56.920 --> 2:01:57.920]  Thank you very much.
[2:01:57.920 --> 2:02:12.520]  Well, I'm really excited about Mark Dice, media analyst, social critic, political activist,
[2:02:12.520 --> 2:02:17.320]  and author, constantly making national news with his insightful analysis.
[2:02:17.320 --> 2:02:19.200]  He's the best-selling author.
[2:02:19.200 --> 2:02:20.200]  He's got a new book.
[2:02:20.200 --> 2:02:21.200]  I'm going to let him announce it.
[2:02:21.200 --> 2:02:24.560]  We're really honored that he's announcing it here on air with us today.
[2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:27.280]  We've got him for the next 50 minutes, the rest of the hour.
[2:02:27.280 --> 2:02:30.480]  Find him on YouTube for now at Mark Dice.
[2:02:30.480 --> 2:02:33.760]  And again, also on Twitter, Mark, great to have you here.
[2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:34.760]  Wow.
[2:02:34.760 --> 2:02:37.760]  What a crazy time, but 27 days out.
[2:02:37.760 --> 2:02:38.760]  Great to be with you, Alex.
[2:02:38.760 --> 2:02:43.920]  One of the few platforms in the country that's truly independent from the social media titans,
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:45.120]  from the big tech censors.
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:47.920]  We just saw President Trump got censored again today.
[2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:51.640]  It's incredible what you've been able to build, and I know that you're under attack.
[2:02:51.640 --> 2:02:56.640]  They're always inventing new and more devious ways to try to continue to further reduce
[2:02:56.640 --> 2:02:57.640]  your voice.
[2:02:57.640 --> 2:03:03.240]  So, great to be here where we can speak freely and not be concerned about getting deep-platformed,
[2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:06.320]  demonetized, censored, and suppressed.
[2:03:06.320 --> 2:03:12.040]  And the new book is Hollywood Propaganda, how television, movies, and music shape our
[2:03:12.040 --> 2:03:13.520]  culture.
[2:03:13.520 --> 2:03:18.000]  And everybody knows that Hollywood is liberal, that they push a liberal agenda, but people
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:22.880]  need to know how deep it goes and the mechanisms of power that are behind the scenes.
[2:03:22.880 --> 2:03:27.240]  Because just like in Washington, D.C., there are lobbyist groups that lobby members of
[2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:35.920]  Congress to pass laws, Hollywood has lobbying agencies that come and lobby the writers in
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:43.160]  the studios to insert specific messages into the shows and into their scripts to popularize
[2:03:43.160 --> 2:03:44.160]  ideas.
[2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:51.520]  You're absolutely right, and now it's very clear to the President, I saw you were commenting
[2:03:51.520 --> 2:03:57.040]  on his tweet, repeal section 230, you said if we don't stop this, it won't be much longer
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:01.920]  until people are banned from even owning a cell phone if Big Tech doesn't like what they
[2:04:01.920 --> 2:04:04.040]  talk about or text with their friends.
[2:04:04.040 --> 2:04:10.360]  They're even inside the WhatsApp of Facebook blocking Alex Jones, blocking Jordan Peterson,
[2:04:10.360 --> 2:04:12.000]  I've seen blocking you.
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:15.960]  So they're getting away with bloody murder here.
[2:04:15.960 --> 2:04:20.280]  It's terrible, and the tech has evolved far beyond what the laws are able to keep up with.
[2:04:20.280 --> 2:04:25.200]  And we've been complaining about section 230 needing amending for many years now, and it's
[2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:30.880]  not far-fetched to see that somewhere down the line, Windows or Apple could literally
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:36.400]  just deny you, for example, the right to have an iPhone, the right to use their software.
[2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:41.160]  You're creating content that's violating their terms of service that you agree to with the
[2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:46.280]  click-through menus that you supposedly agree to when you install the software.
[2:04:46.280 --> 2:04:50.600]  And it's getting so bad in my previous book, the liberal media industrial complex, I talked
[2:04:50.600 --> 2:04:51.600]  all about that.
[2:04:51.600 --> 2:04:55.800]  We're all familiar with how social media has evolved over the last few years, especially
[2:04:55.800 --> 2:05:02.120]  since the 2016 election to suppress and censor conservative voices to artificially amplify
[2:05:02.120 --> 2:05:07.720]  liberal trends, to insert things into the trending topic to create a false self-fulfilling
[2:05:07.720 --> 2:05:12.600]  prophecy to give the impression that something is popular, put it into the trending module,
[2:05:12.600 --> 2:05:15.640]  get people talking about it, they then start talking about it.
[2:05:15.640 --> 2:05:21.880]  But Hollywood is an incredible weapon, really, that's been used and weaponized more in the
[2:05:21.880 --> 2:05:27.320]  last few years with the anti-Trump agenda, the war on America, pushing socialism.
[2:05:27.320 --> 2:05:33.800]  We're having television shows now promote ICE, immigration and customs enforcement, as the
[2:05:33.800 --> 2:05:40.600]  new Boogeyman, and a lot of this has to deal with these social impact agencies, which are
[2:05:40.600 --> 2:05:46.280]  literally Hollywood lobbying groups that are used by Planned Parenthood, by LGBT groups,
[2:05:46.280 --> 2:05:52.800]  by the United Nations, the Obama administration used them, and they're the ones who whine
[2:05:52.800 --> 2:05:59.800]  and dine Hollywood producers, writers, and they get their literal ideas and characters
[2:05:59.800 --> 2:06:05.640]  inserted into the scripts of popular shows. So we're seeing ICE be the new Boogeyman.
[2:06:05.640 --> 2:06:10.920]  ICE are the bad guys. There was an episode of the Connors, the terrible spin-off of the
[2:06:10.920 --> 2:06:15.960]  Roseanne franchise, where one of the characters had a boyfriend who worked at a restaurant,
[2:06:15.960 --> 2:06:21.480]  he was an illegal alien, he got detained in a sweep, and it was a big heartbreaking moment
[2:06:21.480 --> 2:06:25.800]  about how terrible ICE is, and they're breaking up families because he just knocked her up,
[2:06:25.800 --> 2:06:30.360]  and immigration is the big enemy, and President Trump's behind the whole thing.
[2:06:30.360 --> 2:06:35.160]  It's just incredible because people who haven't tuned into the news or have tuned out are still
[2:06:35.160 --> 2:06:40.280]  being inundated with this propaganda through entertainment, and it's very sophisticated,
[2:06:40.280 --> 2:06:43.640]  very powerful. I totally agree. Let me just say this because I have a bunch of questions I want to
[2:06:43.640 --> 2:06:47.800]  ask you. I only got to read half the book. I got it two days ago. It's amazing. All your books are
[2:06:47.800 --> 2:06:52.840]  amazing. They're all groundbreaking, but I wouldn't call you a late bloomer because I knew you were
[2:06:52.840 --> 2:06:59.800]  on my show like 2004, 2005. I met you in 2006 in LA. You were always great on air. You always did a
[2:06:59.800 --> 2:07:03.960]  great job, but brother, I'm a big fan. So are all the listeners. I know the White House says,
[2:07:03.960 --> 2:07:08.120]  Trump's a big fan. You just get better and better. So, I mean, what's going on here,
[2:07:08.120 --> 2:07:13.320]  Mark? Because I kind of got better in ways, but worse than others. My trajectory is like this.
[2:07:13.320 --> 2:07:16.760]  Yours is like this. What's going on with Mark Dye? Is he going to like start getting a red
[2:07:16.760 --> 2:07:21.720]  cape and flying around here soon? Well, I think I found my voice. I found my passion,
[2:07:21.720 --> 2:07:27.080]  and with President Trump being a candidate that a lot of the disaffected voters could actually
[2:07:27.080 --> 2:07:33.000]  get behind to break the two-party system, to break the establishment, the DC swamp,
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:38.440]  it was a great cause to get behind. So Trump's energy and the fight has supercharged you?
[2:07:39.560 --> 2:07:44.120]  Absolutely. As your Churchill said, he said most great men are made by the great circumstances
[2:07:44.120 --> 2:07:50.840]  they're in. I started supporting Trump early 2015 when I started seeing the vicious attacks
[2:07:50.840 --> 2:07:54.120]  against him. And I'm like, well, that's not true what the media is saying about him. And I just
[2:07:54.120 --> 2:07:59.080]  kept debunking the lies and the smears and listening to him directly instead of just the
[2:07:59.080 --> 2:08:03.320]  sound bites that were fed through the filtered mainstream media became apparent that he was
[2:08:03.320 --> 2:08:08.680]  our guy. And how iconic is him taking that mask off and saying the only fear we have to fear is
[2:08:08.680 --> 2:08:12.440]  for itself? Because I didn't like a lot of what Roosevelt did, but he was a great leader, a great
[2:08:12.440 --> 2:08:17.160]  orator, the only Democrat in the last century was even half decent. I mean, Trump is now a
[2:08:17.160 --> 2:08:22.040]  Roosevelt level saying the only thing we have to fear is for itself. The mainstream media in this
[2:08:22.040 --> 2:08:28.760]  country is Nazi Germany level. It's Orwellian level. The fact that they're openly disappointed
[2:08:28.760 --> 2:08:34.200]  that the president is getting well, that they were glad that he was sick. In the last few days,
[2:08:34.200 --> 2:08:38.680]  they've reached a new low. They're literally disappointed that the president has made a
[2:08:38.680 --> 2:08:43.480]  rapid recovery, is making rapid recovery from the coronavirus. They were hoping that he was
[2:08:43.480 --> 2:08:48.920]  going to be on a ventilator. Let's face it, they really want him dead. They want their own recovery
[2:08:48.920 --> 2:08:54.040]  dead. What do the left think if they bankrupt America and no borders, no walls and collapse it?
[2:08:54.040 --> 2:08:59.480]  Why do they think they're going to get ahead? They're not. Because they want a voter base of
[2:08:59.480 --> 2:09:04.040]  people who want handouts. They want the universal basic income. They want to siphon off the wealth
[2:09:04.040 --> 2:09:10.920]  from those of us who work hard, who save our money, who dedicate our time and our education to trying
[2:09:10.920 --> 2:09:15.640]  to make a good life for ourselves and our families. They want to take the money from us through taxes
[2:09:15.640 --> 2:09:21.400]  and through inflation and then give it to those who want a handout in order to bait them and to
[2:09:21.400 --> 2:09:26.200]  continue supporting the Democrat Party. And that's why the Democrats are openly shifting
[2:09:26.200 --> 2:09:31.960]  so far to the left. It's becoming a Marxist movement. Well, again, we've got the late bloomer
[2:09:31.960 --> 2:09:38.200]  who was kicked ass 16, 17 years ago. It's now Tyrannosaurus Rex meets Godzilla level. We have
[2:09:38.200 --> 2:09:42.360]  Mark Dice with us. I'm Alex Jones. I had a list of questions for him and the new book,
[2:09:42.360 --> 2:09:45.960]  Hollywood propaganda available. We'll tell you, we'll push this to number one. We need to push this
[2:09:45.960 --> 2:09:52.600]  to number one. Introducing Info Wars Life, pure turmeric extract. This is taken under the tongue.
[2:09:53.400 --> 2:09:59.880]  It is pure turmeric. It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula
[2:09:59.880 --> 2:10:06.040]  that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines. This is absorbed
[2:10:06.040 --> 2:10:10.760]  under the tongue, into the bloodstream, and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[2:10:10.760 --> 2:10:15.560]  So it's more of an intense delivery system. The two formulas are different, but both are
[2:10:15.560 --> 2:10:19.640]  concentrated and our first product got rave reviews. We've now been testing this out for
[2:10:19.640 --> 2:10:24.600]  several months. Some of our staff like it more than bodies. Some like bodies better. For me,

[2:11:11.880 --> 2:11:17.880]  Proposal. Giving governments and corporations the power to control who can buy and who can sell
[2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:23.240]  to track everything we do. It's not just a recipe. It's a blueprint for total enslavement. And now
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:29.000]  you look at Bill Gates, you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats. We should
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:34.520]  decide how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get, how much red meat you get. We're technocrats
[2:11:34.520 --> 2:11:39.240]  we know best. We're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control you. You
[2:11:39.240 --> 2:11:44.920]  snap your fingers, we're here. They're just rolling it out. And a lot of people are complying with it.
[2:11:48.920 --> 2:11:55.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:55.480 --> 2:12:09.800]  The threat is real. A global alliance of communist Chinese, Hollywood, the left,
[2:12:10.840 --> 2:12:16.520]  radical Islam is trying to bring down the United States of America. We're joined by Mark Dice.
[2:12:18.120 --> 2:12:23.000]  All right, I got up to page 149. Only got this book two days ago.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:29.800]  And so I want to talk about this as we wait for on corruption. Some actors are real CIS. That's
[2:12:29.800 --> 2:12:33.000]  the part I got up to because we could talk about events. We could talk about things that are
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:36.760]  happening. People need to know the blueprint of how it operates. So, Mark, we can get into the
[2:12:36.760 --> 2:12:41.960]  war on Trump, the 25th Amendment, fan fiction, immigration, the war on white people, abortion,
[2:12:41.960 --> 2:12:48.200]  LBGT agenda, gender swaps and feminism. You got the floor. So just where do you want to go next?
[2:12:48.200 --> 2:12:54.120]  Your book, these points? I want to drive your book to number one. I know you're even launching it
[2:12:54.120 --> 2:12:57.880]  today. I'm so honored you're here. That's a big political statement. If we drive your book,
[2:12:57.880 --> 2:13:00.200]  Hollywood propaganda, number one on Amazon. How do we do that?
[2:13:01.080 --> 2:13:05.560]  I think we can. If everybody buys it right now. And last year, the liberal media industrial complex,
[2:13:05.560 --> 2:13:09.720]  my previous book, was number two, number two of all books the day that I announced it. So,
[2:13:09.720 --> 2:13:14.440]  if everybody goes to Amazon, orders Hollywood propaganda, how television movies and music
[2:13:14.440 --> 2:13:18.600]  shape our culture, there's a very, very good chance we can get it to number one.
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:23.560]  Brian Stelton will cry himself to sleep tonight. As usual, liberal media is going to totally freak
[2:13:23.560 --> 2:13:29.240]  out. But, you know, a lot of people say that they're not into politics, but pop culture is
[2:13:29.240 --> 2:13:35.000]  politics. It's woven into the fabric under the disguise of entertainment. And especially recently,
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:40.600]  because now even sports, which usually was one of the last places you could go to escape the
[2:13:40.600 --> 2:13:46.360]  pressures of politics, has been inundated with it. And of course, that's a very specific tactic
[2:13:46.360 --> 2:13:53.080]  that the Democrats are using in order to get their agenda to people who usually don't follow the news
[2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:58.280]  or maybe even if they do, to just bombard them with messages about how terrible Trump is. We
[2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:03.080]  got to just either not go and vote for him or get out and vote for Joe Biden to get him out.
[2:14:03.080 --> 2:14:08.280]  It's a very crafty method of propaganda and to illustrate how powerful entertainment is.
[2:14:08.280 --> 2:14:14.440]  This is declassified, by the way. The CIA actually created a record label in Cuba
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:23.320]  and hired rappers in order to foment dissent against Raul Castro trying to overthrow his regime
[2:14:23.320 --> 2:14:31.160]  because they wanted music that was against his regime. That was anti-communism. That was, you
[2:14:31.160 --> 2:14:36.840]  know, similar to the anti-establishment music that we had in the United States in the 1960s.
[2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:44.120]  And so the CIA obviously wanted Raul Castro's communism to collapse in Cuba. So they literally
[2:14:44.120 --> 2:14:52.040]  started a record label and hired rappers and fed them points and helped promote their careers
[2:14:52.040 --> 2:14:57.400]  in order to spread a message through the music. That's how powerful entertainment-
[2:14:57.400 --> 2:15:02.920]  But only because it wasn't Chai-Com, big corporate fascist communism. It was a branch of communism
[2:15:02.920 --> 2:15:08.600]  that I don't support. It was terrible, but something they didn't run. And that is how
[2:15:08.600 --> 2:15:13.560]  powerful entertainment is. And that's, think of the effects of rap music and people point to
[2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:19.400]  rap music and blame it for some of the violence or blame movies. And it's not accurate to say
[2:15:19.400 --> 2:15:24.920]  that it's a cause, but in many cases, it's definitely a catalyst. It prepares, it primes,
[2:15:26.040 --> 2:15:30.920]  people, it encourages, it guides people's thoughts. It's a powerful medium. And so
[2:15:30.920 --> 2:15:36.600]  so we have recently, these social impact agencies, which are Hollywood lobbyist groups,
[2:15:36.600 --> 2:15:43.080]  whining and dining, popular studios and writers to insert their leftist propaganda,
[2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:49.720]  pro-abortion messages, glorifying abortion. This is why same-sex marriage became so widely
[2:15:49.720 --> 2:15:55.240]  accepted is literally television shows like Ellen's. Let's talk about that. What's the
[2:15:55.240 --> 2:15:57.800]  agenda behind that? Because they're force-feeding that all day long.
[2:15:57.800 --> 2:16:03.560]  Well, at first they said, oh, they just want the right to get married, but now they must be
[2:16:03.560 --> 2:16:08.760]  celebrated. Now they're at every awards show. They're heroes. They're amazing. And their foot
[2:16:08.760 --> 2:16:14.840]  was in the door to now what we see here just a few years later, child drag queens, drag queen
[2:16:14.840 --> 2:16:23.400]  story hour, this complete debauchery of the human soul. And a few years ago, if there was a child
[2:16:23.400 --> 2:16:30.360]  drag queen being promoted on ABC's Good Morning America, which Desmond is amazing was by Michael
[2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:35.560]  Strahan and the co-host, there would have been a national outrage. People have completely lost
[2:16:35.560 --> 2:16:40.680]  their mind, but now Michael Strahan applauds. Yay, it's an 11-year-old dressed as in drag,
[2:16:41.480 --> 2:16:45.960]  you know, performing gay bars. On video with convicted murderers and drug dealers.
[2:16:47.080 --> 2:16:52.760]  Performing simulated strip teases at gay bars while men throw dollar bills. And I guess that's
[2:16:52.760 --> 2:16:58.120]  why, you know, one of your strikes on YouTube was because you said that, uh, that was an
[2:16:58.120 --> 2:17:01.800]  abomination and that's considered to be hate speech because you're not allowed to criticize
[2:17:01.800 --> 2:17:07.160]  this. And now we see finally, at least there was some outrage over Netflix's cuties, but there's
[2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:12.040]  another documentary subscribers, but that's the thing. The NFL loses a third of their viewers
[2:17:12.040 --> 2:17:17.400]  or more baseball, basketball, all that, but they don't care. They just keep, why do they push,
[2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:23.640]  even though it destroys their own operations? Well, it's ideology over income. And they're
[2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:27.080]  so desperate that they're doing everything that they can to try to inundate viewers
[2:17:27.880 --> 2:17:33.800]  at every angle with the leftist propaganda. The popular sports website, Deadspin, was told,
[2:17:33.800 --> 2:17:39.480]  the upper management, told the writers to stick to sports, which, you know, shouldn't be a surprise
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:44.360]  to anybody who works at a sports website. And one of the editors revolted, filled the web page
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:48.440]  with a bunch of pop culture news, bunch of political news. He was fired. He tweeted out
[2:17:48.440 --> 2:17:54.680]  unironically that he was fired for not sticking to sports after being told to. That's how crazy
[2:17:54.680 --> 2:17:58.840]  they are. They need to use every possible avenue. I agree. I would love to be able to go someplace
[2:17:58.840 --> 2:18:03.480]  to check out of this. I can't. It's everywhere. It's every movie, every show, every sporting event.
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:08.040]  I just, I can't walk down the street. It's just everywhere. But don't they get markets
[2:18:08.040 --> 2:18:13.160]  pissing us off. It's not making us accepted. It is having a big backlash. And I think that's
[2:18:13.160 --> 2:18:17.800]  an unintended consequence. Perhaps their arrogance is making them blind to that. A lot of people
[2:18:17.800 --> 2:18:23.240]  are being energized by this, pushing back on this. We started seeing it in 2015 with the
[2:18:23.240 --> 2:18:28.840]  crazy Halloween costumes being ridiculed or being, you know, banned for being offensive.
[2:18:28.840 --> 2:18:33.480]  And now people, conservatives, those of us who still have some intelligence in us,
[2:18:33.480 --> 2:18:40.280]  are openly mocking these people and pushing back. And people are rising up by simply criticizing
[2:18:40.280 --> 2:18:43.720]  and pushing back. So it is, as you, as you say, it's an info war.
[2:18:43.720 --> 2:18:46.440]  Well, I totally agree with you, Mark. And I want to go into your book when we come back,
[2:18:46.440 --> 2:18:51.560]  but let me ask you this. You never compromised. When I got the platform two and a half years
[2:18:51.560 --> 2:18:55.400]  ago, you were one of the only people other than like Tucker Carlson that said it was wrong and
[2:18:55.400 --> 2:18:59.080]  they were coming for everybody next, which people think, oh, you're going to get banned for that.
[2:19:00.040 --> 2:19:03.720]  You've been censored. You've been, you've been blocked some. You've been frozen here and there.
[2:19:03.720 --> 2:19:08.760]  But how have you maintained your integrity and still not been de-platformed on YouTube and
[2:19:08.760 --> 2:19:13.160]  Twitter? Well, what is it about you? Because most people that grovel get banned. You didn't.
[2:19:13.160 --> 2:19:17.800]  You're still there. They're shadow banning you, but you've still survived. Are they scared of you?
[2:19:17.800 --> 2:19:23.800]  Or what is it? Well, because I'm on a mission and my mission is the message. My mission is not
[2:19:23.800 --> 2:19:28.120]  about making money. My mission is not about getting famous. It's about the message. And I'm so
[2:19:29.320 --> 2:19:33.720]  tunnel vision focused on that, that I'm not going to give up. And there's some things on
[2:19:33.720 --> 2:19:38.600]  YouTube I kind of have to, you know, dance around or drop a little hints by and sort of shy away
[2:19:38.600 --> 2:19:42.440]  from, which is why the book is filled with a lot of information that you won't find on my YouTube
[2:19:42.440 --> 2:19:46.360]  videos. I think part of the reason why I survived and why I haven't gotten caught up at least yet
[2:19:46.360 --> 2:19:52.360]  in a major cycle of mainstream media attacks, this cycle around this election, is because I
[2:19:52.360 --> 2:19:56.040]  don't think they take me seriously because I kind of clown around. I like to have a good time. And
[2:19:56.040 --> 2:19:59.240]  so I appreciate you having me on. People can kind of see the serious side of me. And as you know,
[2:19:59.240 --> 2:20:06.840]  from reading the book, I have a very serious side. You're a YouTube institution. It's too obvious
[2:20:06.840 --> 2:20:11.800]  if they bad. Well, and now I'm getting retweeted by the president. I was invited to the White
[2:20:11.800 --> 2:20:17.720]  House and I don't say that the brag, but that's just a reflection of the success and of the mission
[2:20:17.720 --> 2:20:21.960]  being rewarded by the president himself. And I think since I have so many eyes on me now,
[2:20:22.520 --> 2:20:27.240]  that they might be a little bit more cautious. I agree. Because now the censorship is such a
[2:20:27.240 --> 2:20:31.480]  big deal. They don't want to get you. But I think of Biden wins. They're going to get you.
[2:20:31.480 --> 2:20:35.320]  I want to ask you, what's happens if Biden wins? God forbid, they're going to contest the election.
[2:20:35.320 --> 2:20:37.880]  What do you think about that? Mark Dye's got a bunch of questions here for you.
[2:20:38.600 --> 2:20:42.760]  Comedy is now political. The Department of Defense in Hollywood, propaganda, sports. What
[2:20:42.760 --> 2:20:49.880]  your book covers? The globalists are very, very honest about their planetary goals. They want
[2:20:49.880 --> 2:20:57.960]  private corporate governance above nation states, above religious institutions, above the family.
[2:20:57.960 --> 2:21:03.560]  They want total corporate power. There was a great film back in the early 1970s called
[2:21:03.560 --> 2:21:11.480]  Rollerball with James Cahn. It's based on a novel set in the year 2020. And in the book,
[2:21:11.480 --> 2:21:16.120]  you have mega corporations that control the planet. And there are no longer nation states.
[2:21:16.680 --> 2:21:22.840]  There are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations. Well, if you actually read what
[2:21:22.840 --> 2:21:28.280]  the Davos group and the CFR and the Lionel Commission say in the year 2020, that is their
[2:21:28.280 --> 2:21:34.200]  in game, that is their goal. So we're talking about a hunger games type scenario here run by
[2:21:34.200 --> 2:21:39.560]  very, very, very ruthless people to see us as a shadow. They're using COVID-19 as their takeover
[2:21:39.560 --> 2:21:45.960]  strategy, Communist China as their model. We must reject it now. For more than 100 years,
[2:21:45.960 --> 2:21:51.480]  the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government, abolish nation states,
[2:21:51.480 --> 2:21:55.880]  dumb down the population by taking control of education, and most importantly, taking control
[2:21:55.880 --> 2:22:02.200]  of Western medicine. Now, they had a bad name by the 1920s. They started converting over and
[2:22:02.200 --> 2:22:08.440]  funding other organizations and groups like IBM to continue on with their eugenics operations.
[2:22:09.080 --> 2:22:14.600]  Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors
[2:22:15.240 --> 2:22:19.960]  to Bill Gates III, his father, of course, being ahead of Planned Parenthood. And now
[2:22:19.960 --> 2:22:25.000]  he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world,
[2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:31.800]  every national health system. Bill Gates is in control. They have spent a hundred plus years
[2:22:31.800 --> 2:22:37.240]  getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body.
[2:22:37.240 --> 2:22:43.000]  This is the holy grail of their operations. And now they're normalizing, putting a new type of DNA
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:49.320]  in your body. The planets have aligned globally. They've aligned nationally. They've aligned
[2:22:49.320 --> 2:22:55.720]  financially, culturally, but most importantly, spiritually. We are living at a point in human
[2:22:55.720 --> 2:23:01.800]  development that will decide the entire future destiny of our species. So that's why big tech
[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:08.120]  control by the very dark forces of the globalist is trying to dumb us down, isolate us, make us
[2:23:08.120 --> 2:23:14.040]  depressed, make us alone, and traffic control every aspect of our lives, literally grainwashing us
[2:23:14.040 --> 2:23:18.680]  with the stimuli that they look forward, because they do not want us to take our birthright,
[2:23:18.680 --> 2:23:23.960]  not just of Americana, but of true Christendom and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[2:23:24.680 --> 2:23:28.920]  They are trying to create the new dark age, where they have all the high technology and
[2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:34.280]  life extension, and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon
[2:23:34.280 --> 2:23:40.680]  credits and through a social credit score. This is their plan. We must come together and awaken
[2:23:40.680 --> 2:23:50.200]  out of our trance and say, no, we mustn't race God. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:10.680 --> 2:24:25.480]  I get down sometimes and it's like six in the morning, I get up and get coffee and Mark
[2:24:25.480 --> 2:24:30.280]  Dyson must be up at 4am in California. And like boom, there's a new video because I subscribe
[2:24:30.280 --> 2:24:35.320]  to it. I'm like, it makes me feel good because he makes it fun. And you know, I want to be like
[2:24:35.320 --> 2:24:40.040]  that. I do that sometimes. I want to be able to like process this somehow and not get where I want
[2:24:40.040 --> 2:24:44.680]  to kill people. Because that's what this comes down to. The new book, Hollywood Propaganda,
[2:24:44.680 --> 2:24:50.120]  I've got an advanced copy right here. They're out today. And look, Mark could have sold out.
[2:24:50.120 --> 2:24:53.640]  He could have had a national TV show. I even know about the offer he got. This isn't about the money.
[2:24:53.640 --> 2:25:00.360]  It's about the victory of sending this to the top of Amazon. So people need to go to markdice.com.
[2:25:00.360 --> 2:25:04.680]  They need to go to amazon.com. They need to go, where do people go, Mark? Because I'm like asking
[2:25:04.680 --> 2:25:07.320]  you in the break, what do you want to talk about? I want to talk about this issue. I'm like,
[2:25:07.320 --> 2:25:11.560]  let's talk about your book. You can't mind about your book. Let's go to number one. It's all in
[2:25:11.560 --> 2:25:15.960]  the book. It's an amazing book. I've read about a third of it so far, maybe half, 40% or so.
[2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:20.520]  Why do people need to get the book? Where do they get the new Mark Dice book, Hollywood Propaganda?
[2:25:21.480 --> 2:25:25.880]  It's not in stores because I published it. So you have to get it from amazon.com in a paperback
[2:25:25.880 --> 2:25:31.000]  or you can download the ebook from any of the major ebook stores. And I published it because I
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:35.800]  wanted to say what I wanted to say. I don't want a publisher to come and have it reviewed. And
[2:25:35.800 --> 2:25:40.600]  oh, we want you to change this. They totally control everything. We won't publish it. If you
[2:25:40.600 --> 2:25:46.120]  say this, they would send back notes. I've done deals with big publishers and then they put out
[2:25:46.120 --> 2:25:53.160]  a book. I didn't say these things. That refused the book. So this is exactly what I want to say,
[2:25:53.160 --> 2:25:59.080]  completely uncensored. And Hollywood is an entertainment capital of the world, but it's
[2:25:59.080 --> 2:26:03.480]  the propaganda capital of the world. It's the political capital of the world in a sense, aside
[2:26:03.480 --> 2:26:09.160]  from DC, because they set the culture. As Andrew Breitbart said, which has been called the Breitbart
[2:26:09.160 --> 2:26:14.760]  doctrine, politics is downstream from culture. Hollywood shapes the culture, gets people to
[2:26:14.760 --> 2:26:22.920]  accept ideas that then are literally turned into laws. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez co-hosted or was
[2:26:22.920 --> 2:26:29.160]  a guest host rather on RuPaul's Drag Race. This is a competition reality show about who's the
[2:26:29.160 --> 2:26:33.400]  best drag drag I'm going to stop you. I really want your book to go number one because that is a big
[2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:38.920]  victory. Tell us how we get the book. How it goes. Number one, go to Amazon.com, search for
[2:26:38.920 --> 2:26:45.000]  Hollywood propaganda and click the link and order it right now. And if we order it now, right after
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:50.360]  this broadcast, we concentrate the sales and the algorithm will push it up to the top. And I'm
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:54.520]  confident that we can get it very close. Let me explain to listeners. If we all just buy 10,000
[2:26:54.520 --> 2:26:57.880]  copies a day and there's millions listening and we just do it, you get a great book, you can read
[2:26:57.880 --> 2:27:02.040]  it, get it for somebody and wake them up. That will push at the top because of the chain reaction,
[2:27:02.760 --> 2:27:07.240]  which then totally pisses the enemy off. It's a big victory. It's a big cannonball. We got the
[2:27:07.240 --> 2:27:13.240]  howitzer named at the enemy ship. Let's get the, let's, let's, let's take their ass. We got a bump.
[2:27:13.240 --> 2:27:17.640]  John Brennan is up near the top. We got to push him off the top. Ted Cruz is up near the top. We
[2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:23.720]  can, we can overtake him if everyone goes and orders Hollywood propaganda by Mark Dice right now.
[2:27:23.720 --> 2:27:29.320]  And, you know, as I was saying, just launched hours ago,
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:36.840]  AOC guest hosted the drag queen show and she told the drag queens that they are responsible
[2:27:36.840 --> 2:27:43.160]  for getting laws changed about LGBT, ABCDFG people because she knows she didn't call it
[2:27:43.160 --> 2:27:46.840]  the Breitbart doctrine, but that's what she was talking about. Change the culture. You're able
[2:27:46.840 --> 2:27:53.000]  to change the laws and that's what they've done. And so they are literally pulling the strings
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:58.920]  and putting up a false mirror to try to shape society into the directions that they want us
[2:27:58.920 --> 2:28:04.600]  to go in. And we're seeing the effects of this with everybody's apologizing to be white now,
[2:28:04.600 --> 2:28:11.000]  because it's you, you, you can't be proud. What about the war on white people? Your book covers
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:15.800]  that. Now we've been seeing that obviously with Black Lives Matter, all Hollywood people are
[2:28:15.800 --> 2:28:20.280]  involved in that. But in the award shows for the last few years, they've been complaining about too
[2:28:20.280 --> 2:28:25.320]  many white people are getting nominated. Too many white people are getting winning the awards.
[2:28:25.320 --> 2:28:34.040]  And so now we're seeing Hollywood is catering to this idea that white people need to be
[2:28:34.920 --> 2:28:40.920]  removed from and replaced in a sense in pop culture. Well, major universities now have
[2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:46.360]  segregation of whites away from blacks. And this is Hitlerian. Well, as you know,
[2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:51.080]  everything has to be diversity. It's too many white people in entertainment. And the latest
[2:28:51.080 --> 2:28:57.720]  thing what they like to do is take popular franchises and then replace the iconic character
[2:28:57.720 --> 2:29:03.000]  with a black character. Annie, the popular singer Annie with the red-haired, red-haired little Annie,
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:08.200]  they remade the movie. It's a black girl. The Wonder Years are coming back. The popular television
[2:29:08.200 --> 2:29:13.640]  show from the nineties. It's a black family. They're doing a live remand. The idea is Hollywood
[2:29:13.640 --> 2:29:18.920]  by making a character about you owns you. They don't. Hollywood literally funding Black Lives
[2:29:18.920 --> 2:29:25.240]  Matter wants to end families. They are open, Marxist. Anybody who's been studying the group
[2:29:25.240 --> 2:29:29.160]  knows this. Michelle Obama just put out a propaganda piece today saying only a small
[2:29:29.160 --> 2:29:34.440]  fraction of the protests are violent. Well, they've caused two billion dollars with the damage they've
[2:29:34.440 --> 2:29:39.480]  killed. I lost count over a dozen, perhaps two dozen people this summer, just innocent people
[2:29:39.480 --> 2:29:46.040]  in the riots and they're fomenting it. And now we see the politicization of comedy is a chapter
[2:29:46.040 --> 2:29:52.120]  in the book. And comedy used to be fairly neutral. Johnny Carson wouldn't reveal which political
[2:29:52.120 --> 2:29:56.760]  party he supported. Neither did Jay Leno. Even David Letterman, you couldn't really tell where
[2:29:56.760 --> 2:30:01.160]  he stood on political issues. They were pretty fair. They would hit both sides, but now shows
[2:30:01.160 --> 2:30:06.200]  like Stephen Colbert are an anti-Trump editorial. So where does Hollywood go now? It seems like
[2:30:06.200 --> 2:30:11.960]  just like sports destroying their audience, destroying their dominance. I think they're
[2:30:11.960 --> 2:30:16.040]  done. I mean, I think they know they're not done. They're not going to be done, but they're going
[2:30:16.040 --> 2:30:20.520]  to have niche audiences. They've whittled their audiences down. I mean, done. I mean, done being
[2:30:20.520 --> 2:30:24.760]  dominant. Yeah, exactly. What are they? Absolutely. Yeah, they're done being mainstream. The audience
[2:30:24.760 --> 2:30:29.880]  is too fractionalized. There's too many methods to get entertainment, too many shows, too many
[2:30:29.880 --> 2:30:34.600]  YouTube channels, too many streaming services. And so they're going to have niche audiences
[2:30:34.600 --> 2:30:39.480]  that they're going to cater to continuously. And that's why Stephen Colbert has just gone
[2:30:39.480 --> 2:30:45.240]  far off the left. His show has become an establishment must for Democrats that are
[2:30:45.240 --> 2:30:50.440]  running for office. Several of them literally announced their candidacy on his show, on a
[2:30:50.440 --> 2:30:55.800]  late night comedy show. Alex, that's how infused politics and entertainment is. But on other shows,
[2:30:55.800 --> 2:31:00.920]  they say that Chuck E. Schumer calls up and tells them what to say. Yes. Jimmy Kimmel was
[2:31:00.920 --> 2:31:07.160]  actually credited with causing the repeal of Obamacare to be derailed. And he was consulting
[2:31:07.160 --> 2:31:12.120]  with Chuck Schumer. He later admitted this. Chuck Schumer's office was feeding him talking points.
[2:31:12.120 --> 2:31:17.240]  You may recall that he came on air and cried about his son and his son's not going to be able to
[2:31:17.240 --> 2:31:22.680]  have a surgery if Obamacare gets repealed and wouldn't even be necessarily repealed to repeal
[2:31:22.680 --> 2:31:26.680]  any replacement. So people with pre-existing conditions aren't going to know. Yeah, we know
[2:31:26.680 --> 2:31:32.920]  that. Yeah. So Jimmy Kimmel, I mean, imagine a comedian, a late night comedian, a clown in a sense,
[2:31:32.920 --> 2:31:40.280]  a court gesture, was credited with derailing a major piece of legislation. That's how powerful
[2:31:40.280 --> 2:31:43.160]  entertainment is, John Oliver. We have the Department of Defense in Hollywood. We have the
[2:31:43.160 --> 2:31:49.560]  Department of Defense telling Trump, we're going to continue this critical race theory that whites
[2:31:49.560 --> 2:31:53.480]  are inherently bad people. Well, he should fire the Secretary of Defense. But so the troops are
[2:31:53.480 --> 2:31:57.320]  good on average. But it's the brass that Trump talked about that are horrible. Your book gets
[2:31:57.320 --> 2:32:02.360]  into the Department of Defense in Hollywood. Yeah, this shows how deep a swamp goes in DC
[2:32:02.360 --> 2:32:06.680]  and in Hollywood. Because traditionally, you would think that Hollywood actors are anti-war.
[2:32:06.680 --> 2:32:11.720]  They're a bunch of tree-hugging, loving liberals. They're against the war. But the reality is that
[2:32:11.720 --> 2:32:18.280]  Hollywood movies are some of the biggest pieces of pro-war propaganda in existence. And they work
[2:32:18.280 --> 2:32:23.480]  hand in hand with the Department of Defense to create those projects. Because most people don't
[2:32:23.480 --> 2:32:29.400]  think about it. But where do you think they're getting the jets and the tanks and the aircraft
[2:32:29.400 --> 2:32:33.800]  carriers for these big blockbuster movies? They're getting them from the Department of Defense.
[2:32:33.800 --> 2:32:39.320]  The Department of Defense is not going to just lend or rent those pieces of equipment to a
[2:32:39.320 --> 2:32:44.680]  Hollywood studio that's producing a movie that is anti-war, like Oliver Stone's Platoon,
[2:32:44.680 --> 2:32:51.000]  which shows a more realistic side of war, the downsides of war. And let's go further.
[2:32:51.000 --> 2:32:58.680]  Communist China owns four of the six studios now. They put out the new Top Gun movie and China can't
[2:32:58.680 --> 2:33:03.080]  be criticized in it. So the Department of Defense is still funding Hollywood, even though it's owned
[2:33:03.080 --> 2:33:09.160]  by China. There are limits. And Hollywood is catering to China as well, as you said, because
[2:33:09.160 --> 2:33:13.720]  the market is so huge over there that they don't want to offend the Chinese communist government
[2:33:13.720 --> 2:33:20.520]  and not get distribution. And so there's numerous cases of scripts being changed in order to not
[2:33:20.520 --> 2:33:25.720]  offend the Chinese government. For example, let's talk about Chapter 13, your book, Bowling to China.
[2:33:25.720 --> 2:33:31.880]  We come back and so much more and the war on Trump with Mark Dice, Mark Dice's new book.
[2:33:32.440 --> 2:33:35.720]  Everybody should get it. Folks, it's a culture war. You're going to read it. You're going to know

[2:34:47.800 --> 2:34:53.960]  attorneys have conclusively proven and put out detailed reports at Tablet magazine, documenting
[2:34:53.960 --> 2:35:00.280]  what any trained eye could already see as plain as day. The Communist Chinese working in tandem
[2:35:00.280 --> 2:35:05.000]  with the United Nations and the Democratic Party of the United States as well as the media
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:11.160]  put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look like day of the dead into the world in
[2:35:11.160 --> 2:35:16.120]  China earlier this year. Then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West
[2:35:16.120 --> 2:35:22.680]  locked down when China reopened within three months. This is the greatest strategic poo ever.
[2:35:22.680 --> 2:35:29.240]  This is 21st century warfare being carried out through psychological means for the ultimate
[2:35:29.240 --> 2:35:37.880]  style. Paul Joseph Watson has written about it at infowars.com. This is the way to bring down
[2:35:37.880 --> 2:36:03.160]  the globalist is exposing how communist China and the UN were behind the hysteria.
[2:36:08.680 --> 2:36:14.840]  You're going to take the shots and of course in England they are now saying when I told you
[2:36:14.840 --> 2:36:21.960]  you will not be allowed to travel leave your home until you take all the shots. Dr Gates, I mean
[2:36:21.960 --> 2:36:29.880]  Bill Gates your owner your master says you will have to take four to five covid shots a year
[2:36:29.880 --> 2:36:38.200]  for adult two for baby here baby me much more manageable just like Bill Gates give you polio
[2:36:38.200 --> 2:36:47.960]  and vaccine. I'm Dr Fauci reminding you that we owe you. The future isn't coming it's here and in
[2:36:47.960 --> 2:36:55.080]  the future keeping your humanity saving your soul your integrity your very essence is going to be
[2:36:55.080 --> 2:37:01.160]  your most valuable asset in fact it's going to be your only asset the world being built by the
[2:37:01.160 --> 2:37:08.040]  technocrats and the trap they've now sprung is covid 19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning
[2:37:08.040 --> 2:37:16.680]  of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization. Human
[2:37:16.680 --> 2:37:23.160]  life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[2:37:23.160 --> 2:37:29.240]  This is their stated goal I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you
[2:37:29.240 --> 2:37:35.960]  but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy we turn this around
[2:37:36.520 --> 2:37:41.880]  you must study their own writings you must face the facts and you must come to grips with it
[2:37:41.880 --> 2:37:43.640]  you're all being incrementally destroyed.
[2:37:43.640 --> 2:37:55.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:55.160 --> 2:38:15.560]  Author and researcher Dave Dyer takes over next hour Mark Dyer smart guy to get on
[2:38:16.280 --> 2:38:22.200]  good friend of mine busy guy hollywood propaganda the new book of TV movies and music shape our

[2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:37.160]  and other issues here what is it like and then we go okay we want to put a microchip in you okay
[2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:40.840]  we want world government okay robots are going to run your life okay we're going to face scan you
[2:38:40.840 --> 2:38:46.440]  to buy and sell everything you and I've been shopping around 26 years gosh buddy I think you
[2:38:46.440 --> 2:38:53.240]  were on my show first 2004 2005 remind me when we met in person in LA 2006 you've been around you
[2:38:53.240 --> 2:38:57.320]  published like I don't know how many books 10 20 I don't know I've read like seven or eight of them
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:03.880]  what is it like though to be in this weird thing where we were all ignored attack lied about now
[2:39:03.880 --> 2:39:10.920]  it all came through like we said how do you process that yeah we can see this coming on the horizon
[2:39:10.920 --> 2:39:15.480]  and you're right I think I've known you since 2005 for somewhere around that and yeah I've been
[2:39:15.480 --> 2:39:21.000]  writing books for 15 years and we could see we had the foresight to see what was coming on the
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:24.840]  horizon and it wasn't just speculation we could see what they were planning we could see the
[2:39:24.840 --> 2:39:30.200]  government documents we could see tanks pushing towards these kinds of things and so we started
[2:39:30.200 --> 2:39:35.080]  piecing things together trying to warn people about what was coming and now it is some of
[2:39:35.080 --> 2:39:42.440]  is actually here there are some more things to come down in 2005 I wrote about neural interfaces
[2:39:42.440 --> 2:39:48.440]  implanting computer chips into brains to control them and I was mocked I was laughed at people said
[2:39:48.440 --> 2:39:53.560]  I read too much science fiction and now we have Elon Musk one of the richest men in the world
[2:39:53.560 --> 2:40:00.120]  literally developing one of those things and openly merge with the ISO I was right you know
[2:40:00.120 --> 2:40:05.560]  try to stay kind of humble you know we have a pretty good track record Jeffrey Epstein we were
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:09.240]  warning about him for years and now it's all mainstream news and we know that they were
[2:40:09.240 --> 2:40:15.480]  covering it up because they they knew all about it as well and so I'm glad to have where you were
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:19.960]  right I was right but the truth is as you said you were going off core documents so was I I get
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:26.600]  it sounds crazy that atrazine makes frogs gay it does you know I know it sounds crazy they're
[2:40:26.600 --> 2:40:30.440]  running things in pedophile rings they are I know it sounds crazy they're worshiping an owl
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:34.600]  but they are you know it's like sorry we're just telling you what we found
[2:40:34.600 --> 2:40:40.440]  and getting back to the Department of Defense liaison offices and that's what they're called
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:45.880]  entertainment liaison offices and you can look it's on the CIA's website on any Department of
[2:40:45.880 --> 2:40:50.440]  Defense affiliates website where they have a specific department that works with Hollywood and
[2:40:50.440 --> 2:40:55.560]  they have such control over these scripts Alex that they'll make minor little changes that may not
[2:40:55.560 --> 2:41:00.840]  seem like much but it's in order to shape the audience's perception of the government or
[2:41:00.840 --> 2:41:07.240]  of specific issues for example in Hulk about the Incredible Hulk they consulted on that and offered
[2:41:07.240 --> 2:41:12.760]  some assistance the Dr. Banner David Banner who had had an accident at a lab and then you know
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:18.360]  becomes the Incredible Hulk in the original script for that movie it was a just a government lab but
[2:41:18.360 --> 2:41:21.880]  they said no it can't be a government lab because that that makes the government look incompetent
[2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:27.320]  that makes the government look bad let's just take that out and to show you how deep it goes
[2:41:27.320 --> 2:41:31.800]  oh here's an example my judge told me this on camera said like the Mike Judge interview
[2:41:31.800 --> 2:41:36.680]  we should upload it's probably banned but it has been banned but he said oh we were going to show
[2:41:36.680 --> 2:41:40.840]  one company running a whorehouse out of their coffee shop he said no show everyone running
[2:41:40.840 --> 2:41:45.640]  whorehouses out then we're fine with it because it was all by all of society is collapsed see how
[2:41:45.640 --> 2:41:51.080]  that works sorry and you know during the war on terror after 9 11 there was a lot of discussion
[2:41:51.080 --> 2:41:55.960]  about whether or not we should torture these you know suspected terrorists and a lot of people
[2:41:55.960 --> 2:42:01.000]  didn't want to go down that road for obvious reasons that's a very slippery slope it's it's
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:07.800]  doesn't produce reliable results in most cases and so hollywood was there to carry the water for
[2:42:07.800 --> 2:42:14.280]  the deep state to promote torture as you recall you covered this at the time shows like 24 where
[2:42:14.280 --> 2:42:19.160]  jack bower is torturing the suspects normalizing torture in front of millions of people week
[2:42:19.160 --> 2:42:25.240]  after week as a justification to you know get the bad guys in the war on terror and films like
[2:42:25.240 --> 2:42:33.000]  zero dark 30 the dramatization about supposedly how some bin Laden was found they inserted clearly
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:38.520]  obviously historical inaccurate information about there in that movie to try to create this
[2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:46.760]  false narrative that they should allow torture torture is good so we see that being used as a
[2:42:46.760 --> 2:42:52.760]  mechanism to brainwash and falsely educate and indoctrinate millions and millions of people
[2:42:52.760 --> 2:42:59.800]  into believing a false narrative regarding history and that's how powerful hollywood is
[2:42:59.800 --> 2:43:04.440]  one more example of the entertainment liaison office is katie perry has a music video where
[2:43:04.440 --> 2:43:09.320]  she got dumped by her boyfriend didn't know what to do sees a recruiting poster for the marines
[2:43:10.040 --> 2:43:16.200]  joins the marines her entire music video is literally a recruiting video for the marines
[2:43:16.200 --> 2:43:24.360]  now whether that's good or bad is irrelevant this is how telling women you're being feminist
[2:43:24.360 --> 2:43:28.920]  get rid of your husband do this at the point is it's propaganda people should know where it came
[2:43:28.920 --> 2:43:35.400]  from and that music video we're talking about a music video from you know on mtv that was recorded
[2:43:35.400 --> 2:43:44.200]  on camp petalton a marine base using marine aqua vehicles helicopters uniformed soldiers as extras
[2:43:44.200 --> 2:43:50.520]  in a pop culture music video that's supposed to be just entertainment but it serves also as a
[2:43:50.520 --> 2:43:56.440]  recruitment video and that's some of the things that i detail in hollywood propaganda because
[2:43:56.440 --> 2:44:00.040]  that's what it is and none of these stars are going to admit this when they're going around on the
[2:44:00.040 --> 2:44:04.840]  late night shows and talking about when tom cruise is like it's their opinion but when they want
[2:44:04.840 --> 2:44:09.880]  covid lockdowns when they hate america whatever the message is they're just they're getting a dollar
[2:44:09.880 --> 2:44:15.480]  are they're getting a yen or a young and we're seeing the coronavirus lockdown propaganda show
[2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:20.440]  up in hollywood as well and a lot of that isn't just from writers thinking that they need to do their
[2:44:20.440 --> 2:44:26.920]  part it's the social impact agencies influencing them plant parenthood has a division called the
[2:44:26.920 --> 2:44:31.880]  arts and entertainment engagement that was my question you're you've got a whole thing on abortion
[2:44:31.880 --> 2:44:39.160]  chapter six abortion has been normalized in the minds of millions of people largely because of
[2:44:39.160 --> 2:44:45.320]  hollywood and plant parenthood is at the forefront of that and they're not just out there using their
[2:44:45.320 --> 2:44:51.640]  democrat surrogates to try to demand you know women's health care they're literally behind the scenes
[2:44:51.640 --> 2:44:58.360]  engaging with the entertainment industry and their arts and entertainment office the head
[2:44:58.360 --> 2:45:05.480]  has been called plant parenthood's secret weapon and there are numerous instances of abortions being
[2:45:05.480 --> 2:45:13.960]  uh portrayed in movies in television shows as a great thing because of a direct connection from
[2:45:13.960 --> 2:45:19.960]  absolutely in parenthood literally whining and dining these writers and studios but nice the
[2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:23.800]  goodness is they're having to take market singers name on plant parenthood new york or having to
[2:45:23.800 --> 2:45:30.120]  stop the awards the real grassroots things your work and many others work is is is now coming out
[2:45:30.120 --> 2:45:34.840]  get the book hollywood propaganda uh out there right now on amazon.com we don't like to give
[2:45:34.840 --> 2:45:40.440]  them baseless money but it drives it right to the top and then it becomes a major cultural statement
[2:45:40.440 --> 2:45:45.720]  hollywood propaganda how tv's movies and music shape our culture kind of addition you also get a
[2:45:45.720 --> 2:45:50.200]  digital edition mark we really appreciate you got to come back more than once every six months or
[2:45:50.200 --> 2:45:55.320]  once a year in closing the election what do you think it's coming 27 days out democrats plan to
[2:45:55.320 --> 2:46:00.920]  block it that they plan to try to have states to see this is crazy what what are you seeing right
[2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:07.800]  now what's your advice to the president and others you know my hope is a my my feeling is that the
[2:46:07.800 --> 2:46:12.440]  silent majority is even larger and building up to 2016 there were a lot of people who were afraid
[2:46:12.440 --> 2:46:18.360]  to publicly support the president and when they went into the polls we know how they voted and
[2:46:18.360 --> 2:46:24.680]  since then supporting the president has gotten extremely difficult dangerous in many parts of
[2:46:24.680 --> 2:46:30.920]  the country and so i think that there is a gigantic silent majority of that is going to speak out
[2:46:31.640 --> 2:46:35.800]  through their vote in the polls but i don't know what's going to happen i don't want to make predictions
[2:46:35.800 --> 2:46:41.080]  other than no matter what happens the democrats are going to get completely unhinged if biden
[2:46:41.080 --> 2:46:46.600]  wins they're going to have institutional support for their marxist revolution the antifa and black
[2:46:46.600 --> 2:46:51.080]  lives matter foot soldiers are going to have the government backing the bully pulpit to support them
[2:46:51.080 --> 2:46:56.920]  and they're not going to go away frankenstein is going to turn on its master and i was about to say
[2:46:56.920 --> 2:47:03.320]  there's going to be a big fight over the party look what they did the cnn's headquarters they went
[2:47:03.320 --> 2:47:08.360]  and destroyed it tried to break in we're throwing explosives in their black lives matter and antifa
[2:47:08.360 --> 2:47:13.400]  doesn't have a better friend in the mainstream media than cnn and that's how they treated them
[2:47:13.400 --> 2:47:18.840]  when the george floyd riots first broke out back in late may early june and so they're
[2:47:18.840 --> 2:47:23.800]  going to start targeting democrat members of congress just like we saw with the mayor of
[2:47:23.800 --> 2:47:29.880]  seattle after he literally said no president trump i'm not going to support your troops we're not
[2:47:29.880 --> 2:47:34.520]  going to bring federal funds in here federal federal troops to tamp down the rising or was it in
[2:47:34.520 --> 2:47:39.400]  portland uh where literally the next day they tried to burn his condo down and he had to move now
[2:47:39.400 --> 2:47:46.440]  because he gave president trump the finger 24 48 hours later they ran him out of his own condo
[2:47:46.440 --> 2:47:51.240]  so it's going to be wild that if president trump wins uh it's going to be complete pandemonium
[2:47:51.240 --> 2:47:54.360]  they're going to get violent it's going to be a dangerous situation i think we're going into a
[2:47:54.360 --> 2:47:58.120]  very dangerous decade here it's not just going to be a few years no matter what happens i think
[2:47:58.120 --> 2:48:03.560]  this entire decade is going to be complete chaos very very dangerous i totally agree with you mark
[2:48:03.560 --> 2:48:07.880]  that's the smartest thing i've heard in about a month is that if the craziness just intensifies
[2:48:07.880 --> 2:48:12.680]  it's a period of revolution pro anti-communist candidate is leading ted wheeler in portland
[2:48:12.680 --> 2:48:18.440]  mayor race so even his groveling wasn't enough for him the book hollywood propaganda available

[2:48:35.080 --> 2:48:40.120]  there being ten kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and who give their
[2:48:40.120 --> 2:48:46.520]  power unto the one world leader the antichrist and he has a beast system that no one can buy and
[2:48:46.520 --> 2:48:52.040]  or sell unless he has that mark in the forehead or in the palm of their hand and we look back
[2:48:52.040 --> 2:48:57.800]  on all the warnings you were given and all just the common sense that you don't believe in god
[2:48:58.440 --> 2:49:04.360]  or prophecy giving governments and corporations the power to control who can buy and who can
[2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:09.720]  sell to track everything we do he's not just a recipe it's a blueprint for a total enslave but
[2:49:09.720 --> 2:49:15.400]  and now you look at bill gates you look at bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats
[2:49:15.400 --> 2:49:20.600]  we should decide how much salt you get how much alcohol you get how much red meat you get we're
[2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:24.680]  technocrats we know best and we're now going to set up the economy with a social score to

[2:52:14.680 --> 2:52:20.360]  sold out to the establishment i know who tried to get him to sell out he didn't so his book on

[2:53:07.400 --> 2:53:13.480]  into it because we're dead on and that's why they're panicking that's why
[2:53:15.800 --> 2:53:19.400]  they're doing what they're doing and i know for the average new listener you know it
[2:53:19.400 --> 2:53:26.200]  longtime listeners know all this better than i do i just cannot state to you enough how important
[2:53:26.200 --> 2:53:33.400]  it is you realize the historical point all of us are in right now and how they are betting against
[2:53:33.400 --> 2:53:38.120]  humanity they have bet against god they have bet against decency they have bet against your

[2:54:07.080 --> 2:54:12.520]  we're down to the last few minutes the last round of the fight and this is a big big deal for
[2:54:12.520 --> 2:54:19.480]  humanity and the whole future everything so now bigger than bond the products as big as praying

[2:54:48.280 --> 2:54:52.280]  and if all of us do something now we're going to be able to turn the tide if not it's going to get
[2:54:52.280 --> 2:54:56.520]  really bad you'll still stand up Churchill said there's a time he could stand up and
[2:54:56.520 --> 2:55:01.320]  have a great chance of winning the chance you can stand up later we have a bad chance sometimes
[2:55:01.320 --> 2:55:05.240]  you stand up because there's no chance but it's better to down your feet than live on your knees
[2:55:05.240 --> 2:55:11.560]  as a slave so Jay Dyer is a great researcher and author he's taken over on the other side of this
[2:55:11.560 --> 2:55:17.480]  quick break the Noah Troyer with the war room and then tonight I have another great edition
[2:55:17.480 --> 2:55:23.240]  with dianna Lorraine with the election countdown seven to nine p.m and again all the way that dog
[2:55:23.240 --> 2:55:27.320]  hunts as you tell folks about it you tell them hey here's the forbidden information
[2:55:27.320 --> 2:55:31.400]  you're not supposed to see I want to salute this great crew want to thank my family
[2:55:31.400 --> 2:55:35.320]  want to thank our sponsors and affiliates and stations for keeping us in attack formation
[2:55:35.960 --> 2:55:39.400]  I'm Alex Jones from 2020electionscenter.com thank you all
[2:55:42.120 --> 2:55:49.560]  and perhaps most cruelly of all if Donald Trump has his way the complications from COVID-19
[2:55:49.560 --> 2:55:58.200]  which are well beyond what they should be it's estimated that 200 million people have died
[2:55:58.920 --> 2:56:06.120]  200 million people have died probably by the time I finish this talk right after Joe Biden made
[2:56:06.120 --> 2:56:11.880]  that statement that more than 60% of America has died from COVID-19 when it's not even 200,000
[2:56:11.880 --> 2:56:17.480]  reality he would want to say 6 million have lung scarring and heart damage it's all made up but
[2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:21.400]  you know we got it the mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that
[2:56:21.400 --> 2:56:30.040]  they said that 4% of America would be dead already of course it's 0.0000 and then add a number
[2:56:30.040 --> 2:56:35.880]  because the numbers vary it's a real virus just like people being struck by lightning is real
[2:56:35.880 --> 2:56:51.800]  but to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind control
[2:56:58.280 --> 2:57:03.240]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on your fill in guest host this last hour
[2:57:03.240 --> 2:57:09.080]  my name is Jay Dyer of Jay's analysis I'm the author of esoteric Hollywood one and two
[2:57:10.680 --> 2:57:17.640]  where I cover film symbolism Hollywood mind control all of that in depth you heard Mark Dice
[2:57:18.200 --> 2:57:21.560]  earlier if you like Mark Dice you would definitely like my book as well
[2:57:22.440 --> 2:57:28.920]  today I want to talk about the breakdown of the whole Ukraine-Russia-Gate narrative it's all
[2:57:28.920 --> 2:57:34.920]  collapsed now we know it collapsed a long time ago in fact it's had maybe five or ten collapses in
[2:57:34.920 --> 2:57:40.920]  the last four years but in order to understand this we should look a little bit at history we
[2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:46.840]  should look at the history of the Ukraine this is a big piece of the puzzle as you've noticed
[2:57:46.840 --> 2:57:52.520]  this came up in the debate right if you remember Trump said to Biden we have you on tape I have
[2:57:52.520 --> 2:58:00.280]  you on tape right and this shook Biden right Biden was visibly shook by Trump's statements about
[2:58:01.240 --> 2:58:06.680]  the barisma deal and all of that and there's a bigger picture that we want to look at so let's
[2:58:06.680 --> 2:58:12.360]  zoom out a little bit and let's think about the great game this is the historic battle right
[2:58:12.360 --> 2:58:20.360]  between Russia and the West this is the context even for today even after the Cold War we're kind
[2:58:20.360 --> 2:58:26.360]  of seeing this replay of the great game and if we understand that it'll help us understand
[2:58:26.360 --> 2:58:32.840]  the big picture of what's going on with even the Trump election and why they concocted this whole
[2:58:32.840 --> 2:58:37.720]  Russia-Gate narrative and in fact if you've been paying attention to the news this week there was a
[2:58:37.720 --> 2:58:47.560]  huge reveal in terms of the memo from the DNI that dealt with what was actually going on with the CIA
[2:58:47.560 --> 2:58:53.160]  and the Russia-Gate hoax but we'll get into that here in a little bit if you think about the time
[2:58:53.160 --> 2:59:02.360]  of World War II there was a move even by Hitler to remove Ukraine from the influence of Russia
[2:59:02.360 --> 2:59:07.720]  Ukraine has typically historically been in the sphere of Russian influence going back many
[2:59:07.720 --> 2:59:14.200]  centuries and this move on the part of Hitler was seen as a tactical move for his future plans
[2:59:14.200 --> 2:59:19.800]  you know and coming in and battling with Russia which of course is where he didn't fare so well
[2:59:20.840 --> 2:59:26.440]  but if you think about it from the imperial perspective the West now being a kind of a
[2:59:26.440 --> 2:59:32.840]  empire Pax Americana it still has that same motivation and that was a big piece of the puzzle
[2:59:32.840 --> 2:59:39.720]  for why the US wanted to remove Russia from excuse me remove Ukraine from Russian influence
[2:59:39.720 --> 2:59:44.120]  and one of the things I want to direct your attention to in that regard is everybody
[2:59:44.120 --> 2:59:48.440]  hopefully if you've listened to this show for a long time to Alex then you know he's covered
[2:59:48.440 --> 2:59:54.840]  color revolutions for a long time you know he's talked about the influence of different NGOs
[2:59:55.560 --> 3:00:01.160]  the odd poor movement the different color revolutions like rose like orange revolution
[3:00:01.160 --> 3:00:06.440]  right this was the specific funding and methodology that went into the Ukraine
[3:00:06.440 --> 3:00:12.200]  many many years prior to what happened in 2013 when there was the Ukraine split
[3:00:13.240 --> 3:00:20.200]  this was done by a model of regime change coup revolution that follows a pattern of
[3:00:20.840 --> 3:00:26.360]  what is called non it's called democratic change right so this is like gene sharp different
[3:00:26.360 --> 3:00:33.720]  theorists who came up with this idea to remove existing power structures through quote nonviolent
[3:00:33.720 --> 3:00:39.800]  means but what this really means is decades of agitation so you go into these different
[3:00:39.800 --> 3:00:46.440]  countries and you set up these kind of humanitarian so-called human rights groups and then you agitate
[3:00:46.440 --> 3:00:51.720]  through universities through brainwashing for many centuries for many decades and then you get the
[3:00:51.720 --> 3:00:58.040]  breaking point where usually there's some sort of triggering event they'll have operatives in place to
[3:00:58.040 --> 3:01:04.600]  engage in an assassination of sniping you know try to provoke the existing government to react
[3:01:05.160 --> 3:01:11.320]  so that the media is then ready to broadcast to the whole world this you know sarin attack
[3:01:11.320 --> 3:01:16.840]  this gas attack chlorine attack whatever different kind of you know the brutality of the regime and
[3:01:16.840 --> 3:01:23.640]  this kind of stuff that's all pre-planned and coordinated with the NGO operation that's running
[3:01:23.640 --> 3:01:29.080]  the color revolution and it's very easy to look into these because they're all kind of color
[3:01:29.080 --> 3:01:35.320]  coded and branded so they make use of propaganda and branding things like the fist this was the
[3:01:35.320 --> 3:01:41.160]  original aught poor logo when the first color revolution happened back in the 80s and you've
[3:01:41.160 --> 3:01:46.920]  noticed that that first aught poor fist is the exact same fist that's used by black lives matter
[3:01:46.920 --> 3:01:52.200]  and this is why even Tucker Carlson uh he's done some really good reports lately on the fact that
[3:01:52.200 --> 3:01:57.400]  America seems to be undergoing a very similar type of color revolution now why would that be
[3:01:57.400 --> 3:02:02.520]  well the reason for that is because the same people who were running these color revolutions
[3:02:02.520 --> 3:02:09.640]  back in the 80s this sort of left-minded deep state intelligence operation are the same people doing
[3:02:09.640 --> 3:02:21.400]  the thing that were rules and there was no there was no freedom of choice they broke the rule i was
[3:02:21.400 --> 3:02:26.200]  there i was there like you were and they were distanced why did they break the rules together
[3:02:26.200 --> 3:02:30.040]  chris the way you're starting to harangue me now actually reminds me what you did to the president
[3:02:30.040 --> 3:02:34.920]  during that debate on tuesday night when he not just joined him no and then he had to he had to
[3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:39.960]  debate not just Joe Biden but you as well you are not a neutral moderator then i don't mind tough
[3:02:39.960 --> 3:02:43.720]  questions i welcome you know how much reasonable to talk questions but what i don't think is okay
[3:02:43.720 --> 3:02:48.280]  is for you to become the effective opposition to the president okay and those everyone there was
[3:02:48.280 --> 3:02:52.760]  tested in the crowd they were distanced from each other people can make reasonable decisions
[3:02:52.760 --> 3:02:58.440]  for themselves state no they actually they can't keep on praying for our president and our first
[3:02:58.440 --> 3:03:05.160]  lady america we aren't out of the woods yet i have to be back because we still have to make
[3:03:05.160 --> 3:03:11.720]  america great again we've done an awfully good job of that if you look at the therapeutics which i'm
[3:03:11.720 --> 3:03:17.800]  taking right now some of them and others are coming out soon that are looking like uh frankly
[3:03:17.800 --> 3:03:22.600]  they're miracles if you want to know the truth they're miracles people criticize me when i say that
[3:03:22.600 --> 3:03:26.920]  but we have things happening that look like they're miracles coming down from god
[3:03:26.920 --> 3:03:34.360]  god so i just want to tell you that i'm starting to feel good this is america this is the united
[3:03:34.360 --> 3:03:38.360]  states this is the greatest country in the world this is the most powerful country in the world i
[3:03:38.360 --> 3:03:46.120]  can't be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe and uh just say hey whatever happens happens
[3:03:46.120 --> 3:03:51.560]  i can't do that we have to confront problems as a leader you have to confront problems there's
[3:03:51.560 --> 3:03:58.360]  never been a great leader that would have done that i'm doing well i want to thank everybody
[3:03:58.360 --> 3:04:05.880]  our first lady is doing very well melania asked me to say something as to the respect that she
[3:04:05.880 --> 3:04:12.840]  has for our country the love that she has for our country and we're both doing well melania is uh
[3:04:13.720 --> 3:04:19.720]  really handling it very nicely president trump has been treated with the experimental
[3:04:19.720 --> 3:04:25.800]  antiviral remdesivir and a single eight gram dose of an antibody cocktail developed by
[3:04:25.800 --> 3:04:32.200]  regeneron pharmaceuticals which is a combination of mouse pus and human neutralizing synthetic
[3:04:32.200 --> 3:04:38.040]  antibodies against the virus a treatment that is still in clinical trials and the mixture of the
[3:04:38.040 --> 3:04:43.480]  two is anybody's guess depending on how the president reacts to it president trump is also
[3:04:43.480 --> 3:04:50.520]  taking zinc melatonin vitamin d aspirin and the heartburn brand pepsid which researchers are
[3:04:50.520 --> 3:04:57.080]  studying as a possible treatment for coronavirus so rather than allow the virus to take its course
[3:04:57.080 --> 3:05:02.840]  president trump has laid the gauntlet down in order to return back to the country that desperately
[3:05:02.840 --> 3:05:09.560]  needs his guidance and presence to steer us from a head-on collision into marx's fueled tyranny
[3:05:09.560 --> 3:05:13.800]  the photos the white house has been releasing the videos we have to show them because they're the
[3:05:13.800 --> 3:05:18.120]  only evidence we have of the president's condition but they are propagandistic that's
[3:05:18.120 --> 3:05:22.360]  unfortunately the situation we're in and out of the white house corresponds association is calling
[3:05:22.360 --> 3:05:26.840]  out the white house right now this is the press the press corps the press pool that is supposed
[3:05:26.840 --> 3:05:31.000]  to travel with the president at all times they were not informed about this photo op they were
[3:05:31.000 --> 3:05:36.360]  not with him when this happened that is a grievous breach of protocol and the association is saying
[3:05:36.360 --> 3:05:40.680]  quote it is outrageous for the president to have left the hospital even briefly amid a health
[3:05:40.680 --> 3:05:44.760]  crisis without a protective pool present to ensure the american people know where their
[3:05:44.760 --> 3:05:49.160]  president is and how he is doing now more than ever the american public deserves independent
[3:05:49.160 --> 3:05:54.360]  coverage of the president so they can be reliably informed about his health that is absolutely correct
[3:05:54.360 --> 3:05:59.320]  and by the way anna the president was feeling so well why didn't he walk outside in the fresh air
[3:05:59.320 --> 3:06:03.640]  rather than get cooped up in that car i mean that's not a comfortable place for anybody to be in
[3:06:03.640 --> 3:06:07.080]  when there's a covid positive patient he could have walked out on the lawn
[3:06:07.080 --> 3:06:15.480]  and waved to the public all men are created equal and we finally have a president who backs that up
[3:06:17.800 --> 3:06:24.840]  trump has been buying us pizzas all freaking day trump that is from trump he is brought over 250
[3:06:24.840 --> 3:06:31.080]  pizzas that keep coming in and you know it's from trump because this is gluten free all right
[3:06:31.080 --> 3:06:38.280]  this meat all this jumps in alpha that's why there's so much of it here's my dad and no cnn we're not
[3:06:38.280 --> 3:06:45.560]  getting paid it was in the telecommunications act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your
[3:06:45.560 --> 3:06:51.720]  gps location i read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was
[3:06:51.720 --> 3:06:58.760]  unamerican now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on apple and on droids
[3:06:58.760 --> 3:07:05.160]  don't just track your location but your surfing history where you go who you talk to your relationships
[3:07:05.160 --> 3:07:10.520]  and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well including
[3:07:10.520 --> 3:07:16.680]  having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just like siri or alexa do and then putting
[3:07:16.680 --> 3:07:22.760]  databases transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever your phone is
[3:07:22.760 --> 3:07:27.880]  spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information this is
[3:07:27.880 --> 3:07:33.480]  the global chinese communist social credit score get your protection privacy pockets at info war
[3:07:33.480 --> 3:07:40.920]  store dot com and cut big brother off dead in his filthy tracks info war store dot com we've now
[3:07:40.920 --> 3:07:45.640]  entered month number eight of the global lockdown and it's horrible and it's killing millions of
[3:07:45.640 --> 3:07:52.440]  people via starvation but the good news is it's caused a planetary awakening as well the general
[3:07:52.440 --> 3:07:59.240]  public all over the planet hate bill gates he's the most unpopular person on earth people know he's
[3:07:59.240 --> 3:08:05.240]  not a doctor people know he's a eugenicist the population knows that his vaccines that he pushes
[3:08:05.240 --> 3:08:10.680]  have been filled with cancer viruses polio sterilants and more it's even in the associated press
[3:08:11.400 --> 3:08:17.400]  so now they're beginning to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate global
[3:08:17.400 --> 3:08:22.760]  government and that these top tech billionaires sit in meetings and decide to pull the type of
[3:08:22.760 --> 3:08:28.680]  race war scams and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing so remember that and let them know
[3:08:28.680 --> 3:08:34.360]  that we know who they are and what they've done and we hold them responsible for the collapse of
[3:08:34.360 --> 3:08:39.640]  civilization they are the enemies of humanity they want you dead
[3:08:39.640 --> 3:08:46.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[3:09:22.520 --> 3:09:28.520]  at my youtube channel but one thing that quigley covers in the first 300 pages of the bug is the
[3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:34.280]  fact that the entire 20th century is basically an attempt by the angle american establishment to
[3:09:34.280 --> 3:09:41.160]  undermine any conceived of rival or threat in the geopolitical sphere so that was first the
[3:09:41.160 --> 3:09:47.240]  holy roman empire and then the russian empire that's why the great game is still relevant to today
[3:09:47.240 --> 3:09:53.800]  is that we want to understand how the deep state the military industrial complex a coup
[3:09:53.800 --> 3:10:01.160]  operation that's going on right now presently to undermine trump that all ties into this great game
[3:10:01.160 --> 3:10:06.280]  operation so i was closing the last segment before the power cut out what i was talking
[3:10:06.280 --> 3:10:12.280]  about the the technology of regime change coup change color revolutions there's a great book by a
[3:10:13.880 --> 3:10:19.240]  william effing doll effing doll about full spectrum dominance and he covers this history of
[3:10:19.960 --> 3:10:25.240]  regime change operations and gene sharp and these kinds of characters but what's amazing is that the
[3:10:25.240 --> 3:10:31.720]  same model that this deep state used for a long time against the soviet eastern block countries
[3:10:31.720 --> 3:10:38.040]  is now being turned upon america because the the scam was that all along this military intelligence
[3:10:38.760 --> 3:10:45.240]  m i c deep state operation was actually intent on creating this global government all along
[3:10:45.240 --> 3:10:51.880]  so they were never really interested in america's interest it was always about bringing this global
[3:10:51.880 --> 3:10:56.200]  technocratic government to the entire world and all the stuff that we are seeing play out
[3:10:56.200 --> 3:11:02.440]  in these little mini skirmishes and mini scandals is all ultimately directed towards that final
[3:11:02.440 --> 3:11:08.600]  end game as you know alex has that film in game and everything that alex put into in game is again
[3:11:08.600 --> 3:11:14.280]  the the telos the purpose the goal of where all of these historic operations are headed from the
[3:11:14.280 --> 3:11:21.000]  vantage point of the atlanticist elites that quigley's writing about now i bring all that
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:26.920]  because tucker did a great segment where he talks about how the color revolution has now come to
[3:11:26.920 --> 3:11:32.760]  america because the same people that were behind the russia gate and all that nonsense all that
[3:11:32.760 --> 3:11:39.400]  scam they're the same people funding and promoting all of this collapse and burn the city's narrative
[3:11:39.400 --> 3:11:46.440]  that's going on right now and even the calls for a future coup should trump a contest or should
[3:11:46.440 --> 3:11:53.640]  trump win so let's look at that uh talk or clip where he covers this so just watching all of this
[3:11:53.640 --> 3:11:57.880]  is darin betty he's a former speechwriter for president trump he works now with revolver news
[3:11:57.880 --> 3:12:03.400]  the website he says this is part of a familiar plan in a in a recent piece revolver argued that
[3:12:03.400 --> 3:12:08.680]  democratic operatives including some who testified during the impeachment proceedings are adopting
[3:12:08.680 --> 3:12:14.920]  the same tactics that us intel agencies use to start so-called color revolutions in places like
[3:12:14.920 --> 3:12:22.200]  ukraine darin betty joins us tonight to explain darin thanks so much for coming on so for our
[3:12:22.200 --> 3:12:28.200]  viewers who are not familiar with the color revolutions in eastern europe state as clearly
[3:12:28.200 --> 3:12:33.960]  as you can what you think is going on right now in this election what's the end game for democrats
[3:12:35.560 --> 3:12:42.440]  yes thank you for having me many have described the actions taken against trump as a coup and this
[3:12:42.440 --> 3:12:48.360]  is certainly correct but it's a little bit general and vague what's unfolding before our eyes
[3:12:49.080 --> 3:12:54.840]  is a very specific type of coup called the color revolution it's a regime change model
[3:12:54.840 --> 3:13:01.240]  favored by many in our national security apparatus particularly against eastern european countries
[3:13:01.240 --> 3:13:08.120]  to overthrow target regimes that they don't like one model which is not the color revolution model
[3:13:08.120 --> 3:13:14.360]  is purely sending a bunch of troops into a country and removing by military force a leader you don't
[3:13:14.360 --> 3:13:20.120]  like that's like the iraq model right the color revolution model is a little bit more delicate
[3:13:20.120 --> 3:13:27.000]  and subtle has several characteristics but the chief characteristics of it is a combination of an
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:34.920]  engineered contested elections scenario combined with massive mobilized protests which they call
[3:13:34.920 --> 3:13:42.200]  as a term of art peaceful protests and acts of civil disobedience if that sounds familiar it gets
[3:13:42.200 --> 3:13:50.680]  even better it's not only the same strategies and tactics used against trump that is used against
[3:13:50.680 --> 3:13:56.280]  eastern european dictators that our national security apparatus doesn't like it's literally
[3:13:56.280 --> 3:14:02.280]  the same people who are color revolution professionals who have a long history of using
[3:14:02.280 --> 3:14:07.560]  these same tactics against foreign leaders they don't like to use against democratically
[3:14:07.560 --> 3:14:15.640]  elected president donald trump it's the same people using the very same playbook now i'd like
[3:14:15.640 --> 3:14:21.240]  to talk about one of the key figures in this operation a nexus point not only between color
[3:14:21.240 --> 3:14:28.680]  revolutions overseas and the color revolution against trump but a nexus point between law fair
[3:14:28.680 --> 3:14:35.560]  and mass mobilization and so-called peaceful protests so there you go a talker basically
[3:14:35.560 --> 3:14:40.600]  laying out the the type of regime change coup operation that i've been talking about this ties
[3:14:40.600 --> 3:14:47.800]  into other models that washington uses like smart power soft power these are ways to agitate and
[3:14:47.800 --> 3:14:54.040]  kind of stir things up on a quote peaceful level through academia through again these kind of
[3:14:54.040 --> 3:14:58.760]  street protests this kind of stuff but then eventually there's a staged event or there's
[3:14:58.760 --> 3:15:03.320]  something that triggers it into something perhaps even violent uh we've seen in both
[3:15:03.320 --> 3:15:10.360]  ukraine and in syria situations where there were snipers staged and set up operatives there to
[3:15:10.360 --> 3:15:16.040]  kick off these kinds of events through large-scale trauma or disaster these kinds of things so
[3:15:16.040 --> 3:15:20.920]  sometimes it can and can switch over into that violent model and then you get the overthrow
[3:15:20.920 --> 3:15:27.640]  or the the the new regime coming to power now the same people right remember it was what five or six
[3:15:27.640 --> 3:15:32.760]  years ago when soros bragged that he had he had with the help of the state department put all of
[3:15:32.760 --> 3:15:40.680]  this money into the ukraine orange revolution that was all to do what they did in 2013 which was to
[3:15:40.680 --> 3:15:47.880]  have that annexation that division of the ukraine from russian influence and from the russian sphere
[3:15:47.880 --> 3:15:52.040]  the same thing now is happening in massedonia where they're trying to do another kind of
[3:15:52.040 --> 3:15:56.840]  color revolution and trying to have a split of the church there and this is another area that
[3:15:56.840 --> 3:16:02.440]  i want to talk about if you could uh if you have that uh ex-jesuit clip talking about the ukraine
[3:16:02.440 --> 3:16:06.120]  there uh that's worth looking at i don't know if you have that ready to pull up or not if not you
[3:16:06.120 --> 3:16:11.320]  can do it in the next segment but what he describes there is the role of these jesuits the role of
[3:16:11.320 --> 3:16:16.680]  these operatives in in terms of agitating in the religious sphere so remember these eastern block
[3:16:16.680 --> 3:16:21.480]  countries yeah you want to play the first uh maybe minute or so that clip and then we'll go to break
[3:16:47.160 --> 3:16:55.000]  did ukrainian nationalism and then such a russian phobia that everything that russian is
[3:16:55.000 --> 3:17:05.160]  is bad historically ukrainian means greco-catholics did not support the meaning of ukrainian nationalism at all
[3:17:05.160 --> 3:17:12.360]  were among them means that in the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century russophiles
[3:17:12.360 --> 3:17:17.880]  that existed means russian culture and before that they always supported
[3:17:17.880 --> 3:17:23.720]  means polish and some unions especially means belarusian but also in ukraine
[3:17:23.720 --> 3:17:30.840]  considered themselves Poles the management of the greco-catholic church this is the management
[3:17:30.840 --> 3:17:39.080]  this is the emigrant management and now what he's seeing at look see alex jones shown on jay dyer
[3:17:39.080 --> 3:17:45.880]  remember the global lockdowns you're witnessing the black lives matter antifa riots and racial
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:53.640]  attacks we're all seeing are publicly directed by a handful of top billionaires led by people like
[3:17:53.640 --> 3:18:02.200]  bill gates jeff bezos of course tim cook and others they set up there with their trillions of dollars
[3:18:02.200 --> 3:18:05.480]  they control their companies and they're hundreds of billions of dollars individually
[3:18:05.480 --> 3:18:11.560]  leveraging that against us and trying to create an artificial revolution against local government
[3:18:12.120 --> 3:18:17.560]  and police and the mayors are again they're playing their political game to try to trigger
[3:18:17.560 --> 3:18:22.440]  the complete breakdown of the united states in western europe show these billionaires can come
[3:18:22.440 --> 3:18:26.920]  in and buy it all up for billions on the dollar that's why i'm so angry that these globalists
[3:18:26.920 --> 3:18:31.160]  because when you're looking at them they're the ones that sit in their councils and have decided
[3:18:31.160 --> 3:18:37.480]  to run these plans against us they are enemies of humanity and must be dealt with it's us or them
[3:18:37.480 --> 3:18:45.080]  period for more than 100 years the rockefeller foundation has worked to establish world government
[3:18:45.080 --> 3:18:50.440]  abolish nation states dumb down the population by taking control of education and most importantly
[3:18:50.440 --> 3:18:56.920]  taking control of western medicine now they had a bad name by the 1920s they started converting
[3:18:56.920 --> 3:19:03.080]  over and funding other organizations and groups like ibm to continue on with their eugenics
[3:19:03.080 --> 3:19:09.480]  operations fast forward to the 1980s the baton is handed by ibm via his mother on the board of
[3:19:09.480 --> 3:19:15.320]  directors to bill gates the third his father of course being had a planned parenthood and now
[3:19:15.320 --> 3:19:21.320]  he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world every national
[3:19:21.320 --> 3:19:28.200]  health system bill gates is in control they have spent a hundred plus years getting positioned
[3:19:28.200 --> 3:19:33.960]  to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body this is the holy grail
[3:19:33.960 --> 3:19:40.280]  of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of dna in your body the future
[3:19:40.280 --> 3:19:48.040]  isn't coming it's here and in the future keeping your humanity saving your soul your integrity
[3:19:48.040 --> 3:19:54.200]  your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset in fact it's going to be your only asset
[3:19:54.920 --> 3:20:01.160]  the world being built by the technocrats and the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless
[3:20:01.160 --> 3:20:09.320]  lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete
[3:20:09.320 --> 3:20:17.320]  dehumanization human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the
[3:20:17.320 --> 3:20:24.280]  year 2050 this is their stated goal i'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you
[3:20:24.280 --> 3:20:31.000]  but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy we turn this around
[3:20:31.560 --> 3:20:37.000]  you must study their own writings you must face the facts and you must come to grips with it
[3:20:37.000 --> 3:20:48.440]  you're holding incrementally destroyed you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:21:07.320 --> 3:21:36.840]  so what the clip is explaining
[3:21:36.840 --> 3:21:40.240]  if you're listening on radio, it's a little hard to make out, but he's basically a person
[3:21:40.240 --> 3:21:46.480]  who's a former Jesuit who had come into Orthodoxy, and he's in the Ukraine talking about the
[3:21:46.480 --> 3:21:52.320]  way that Jesuits had helped foster through the Roman Catholic Church in the Ukraine
[3:21:52.320 --> 3:21:59.240]  this split between Russian Orthodoxy and a new State Department-controlled Orthodoxy.
[3:21:59.240 --> 3:22:04.160]  In other words, this is the cohesion in terms of religion in this region, which is the Orthodox
[3:22:04.160 --> 3:22:08.600]  Church, and the way that this was split was actually done very openly by the CIA.
[3:22:08.600 --> 3:22:13.760]  In fact, the former CIA director went to the Ukraine, met with the head of this new created
[3:22:13.760 --> 3:22:15.880]  State Department Church.
[3:22:15.880 --> 3:22:19.840]  The John McCain himself went over there and met with all of these people.
[3:22:19.840 --> 3:22:24.960]  So just as they did with the political sphere of the far right and even the neo-Nazi groups
[3:22:24.960 --> 3:22:30.600]  that they supported, and McCain's even been seen on stage with these people, right sector,
[3:22:30.600 --> 3:22:36.160]  as of these different people, they essentially create a new political sphere, a new political
[3:22:36.160 --> 3:22:40.920]  movement, and a new religion, a new church, a completely State-created church over there
[3:22:40.920 --> 3:22:43.400]  in the Ukraine, and that's just one model.
[3:22:43.400 --> 3:22:47.080]  So when you look at that model, that template, that pattern, then you notice and you can
[3:22:47.080 --> 3:22:49.280]  see how it's done everywhere else.
[3:22:49.280 --> 3:22:53.520]  And that's just a person who's just giving a testimony to the fact that as a former Jesuit,
[3:22:53.520 --> 3:22:57.440]  he knows about this, he knows how it's done, and he was in some sense is probably involved
[3:22:57.440 --> 3:22:59.680]  in that when he was working as a Jesuit.
[3:22:59.680 --> 3:23:06.160]  It's not an accident that John Brennan, for example, is a fellow of Fordham University.
[3:23:06.160 --> 3:23:10.920]  Fordham University is a Jesuit school directly connected to the CIA.
[3:23:10.920 --> 3:23:16.200]  And then if you notice the people who are involved in this deep state kind of liberal
[3:23:16.200 --> 3:23:18.720]  coup plot, they're all the same people.
[3:23:18.720 --> 3:23:20.920]  It's the same crew, right?
[3:23:20.920 --> 3:23:26.560]  Why do you think Gateway Pundit covered the fact a few years ago that it was Obama State
[3:23:26.560 --> 3:23:33.160]  Department that had assisted Soros in the overthrow of Ukraine?
[3:23:33.160 --> 3:23:34.160]  Why?
[3:23:34.160 --> 3:23:39.440]  To obtain oil, gas, industry, right, so it has more.
[3:23:39.440 --> 3:23:45.480]  But now you can see why it's such a big scandal with Burisma, Biden, and all these characters.
[3:23:45.480 --> 3:23:48.800]  If you remember back at the time of the, if I recall, I'm just going from memory many
[3:23:48.800 --> 3:23:54.560]  years ago, when there was the Bundy Ranch standoff, that whole land was part of a deal
[3:23:54.560 --> 3:24:00.000]  that, if I remember, it was Biden's son that Biden was trying to organize a land deal, right,
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:02.200]  with China, if I recall.
[3:24:02.200 --> 3:24:05.240]  So that was the real reason, I think, behind the Bundy standoff, at least that's what
[3:24:05.240 --> 3:24:06.240]  some people claim.
[3:24:06.240 --> 3:24:12.760]  And it's not out of the realm of belief or possibility because if you remember, Hillary
[3:24:12.760 --> 3:24:15.920]  Clinton wrote an essay, I think it was in Brookings Institute, she wrote a paper for
[3:24:15.920 --> 3:24:20.960]  the Brookings Institute, a little article there where she said that you've got to take
[3:24:20.960 --> 3:24:25.400]  care of Gaddafi on humanitarian grounds.
[3:24:25.400 --> 3:24:32.240]  And then she even says something to the effect of, if we do this, we can then kind of aid
[3:24:32.240 --> 3:24:37.080]  all of our allies, I forget her exact wording, but the assumption is, when we go and compare
[3:24:37.080 --> 3:24:41.640]  with what was in the WikiLeaks, her emails, she talks about the kickbacks.
[3:24:41.640 --> 3:24:46.480]  So it's basically a pay-for-play scheme, right, that's why these operations occur in
[3:24:46.480 --> 3:24:47.480]  these other countries.
[3:24:47.480 --> 3:24:50.200]  It has nothing to do with human rights, that's a cover.
[3:24:50.200 --> 3:24:54.560]  It's not about free markets, it's not about any of that stuff, it's about shaking up the
[3:24:54.560 --> 3:25:00.080]  existing order to move in and allocate the resources and give kickbacks to the people
[3:25:00.080 --> 3:25:03.880]  that in Hillary's case, if you remember, all these different foreign donors, right,
[3:25:03.880 --> 3:25:09.080]  they put basically putting money in to get a land deal, to get money, to get whatever
[3:25:09.080 --> 3:25:13.480]  it is, Gaddafi's gold even, I think comes up in the emails at one point, just all this
[3:25:13.480 --> 3:25:20.320]  wild stuff that's just completely, you know, like bond villain level machinations and plans,
[3:25:20.320 --> 3:25:23.120]  and you think that it's not real, no, it's very real.
[3:25:23.120 --> 3:25:29.360]  And in fact, that's the biggest revelation I think was this week with this document of
[3:25:29.360 --> 3:25:37.960]  the DNI that comes out about the CIA being hip to the fact that Russian intelligence
[3:25:37.960 --> 3:25:42.960]  had been hip to the fact that Hillary cooked up the whole thing.
[3:25:42.960 --> 3:25:46.360]  Hillary had cooked up this whole Russiagate story.
[3:25:46.360 --> 3:25:49.960]  It was known, the Russians appeared to have figured it out.
[3:25:49.960 --> 3:25:54.960]  The CIA found out that the Russians had figured it out, so they went and told Obama.
[3:25:54.960 --> 3:26:00.200]  And so in this letter, the Radcliffe letter that came out, this DNI letter, it actually
[3:26:00.200 --> 3:26:06.520]  reads that according to the handwritten notes, former CIA director Brennan subsequently briefed
[3:26:06.520 --> 3:26:12.760]  President Obama and other senior national security officials on the intelligence, including
[3:26:12.760 --> 3:26:18.200]  the alleged approval by Hillary Clinton on July 26, 2016 of a proposal from one of her
[3:26:18.200 --> 3:26:23.640]  foreign policy advisors to vilify Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference
[3:26:23.640 --> 3:26:26.440]  by Russian security services.
[3:26:26.440 --> 3:26:31.960]  It goes on to say that Hillary Clinton's approval of a plan concerning Trump and Russian hackers
[3:26:31.960 --> 3:26:38.960]  hampering in the elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private mail
[3:26:38.960 --> 3:26:40.560]  server.
[3:26:40.560 --> 3:26:43.520]  It's all in that DNI letter that just came out.
[3:26:43.520 --> 3:26:47.480]  I highly recommend going and reading that because what does this letter show?
[3:26:47.480 --> 3:26:53.800]  Well, it's pretty much proof of what, again, as I said, the 15, 16 times the Russiagate
[3:26:53.800 --> 3:26:54.800]  narrative collapsed.
[3:26:54.800 --> 3:26:59.360]  Well, here's yet another final nail in the coffin showing that we know that they were
[3:26:59.360 --> 3:27:02.440]  spying on the Trump campaign to cook up the scandal.
[3:27:02.440 --> 3:27:06.120]  Hillary was already implicated with deals in terms of Russia.
[3:27:06.120 --> 3:27:11.960]  We know this from the Uranium One New York Times story that came out.
[3:27:11.960 --> 3:27:15.560]  So I mean, if you think about it, I mean, if you were the Russians, like, who would
[3:27:15.560 --> 3:27:18.840]  you really try to co-opt?
[3:27:18.840 --> 3:27:20.040]  Would you really go for Trump?
[3:27:20.040 --> 3:27:22.560]  I mean, doesn't it make more sense to go with Hillary?
[3:27:22.560 --> 3:27:24.880]  She's already got deals in Russia, right?
[3:27:24.880 --> 3:27:29.320]  I mean, she's already kind of implicated in a lot of this stuff already.
[3:27:29.320 --> 3:27:34.840]  Trump's sounding this, you know, beacon call of America first doesn't really make sense
[3:27:34.840 --> 3:27:37.200]  to try to co-opt Trump.
[3:27:37.200 --> 3:27:41.200]  If anybody was going to be trying to co-opt it, it would seem to be somebody like Hillary.
[3:27:41.200 --> 3:27:46.920]  If you remember back to the Anna Chapman spy stuff, if I recall, again, going from memory
[3:27:46.920 --> 3:27:50.840]  here, Anna Chapman was already, I think, in Hillary circles, right?
[3:27:50.840 --> 3:27:54.640]  So that operation didn't work, that failed.
[3:27:54.640 --> 3:27:58.440]  But I think at that time, she was trying to get close to Obama and Obama's donors and
[3:27:58.440 --> 3:27:59.440]  people like that.
[3:27:59.440 --> 3:28:02.300]  But ironically, she was already in the circles of Hillary.
[3:28:02.300 --> 3:28:08.080]  So there's a lot more connection between so-called Russians and agents and Hillary than anything
[3:28:08.080 --> 3:28:12.600]  that you might try to come up with or cook up or try to tie to Trump.
[3:28:12.600 --> 3:28:15.800]  And amazingly, none of it stuck, right?
[3:28:15.800 --> 3:28:19.360]  All of these attempts to bribe people, all of these attempts to try to get people to
[3:28:19.360 --> 3:28:24.600]  come out and lie and make, none of it worked, it all failed, it all collapsed.
[3:28:24.600 --> 3:28:29.800]  There was not anything that could tie Trump to Russian intelligence or any of this stuff.
[3:28:29.800 --> 3:28:35.120]  And so the whole thing is now known to be a hoax and, and admittedly now, a distraction
[3:28:35.120 --> 3:28:37.000]  from the emails.
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:41.880]  And now we see why Trump, in fact, in the debates, my speculation, my guess is that
[3:28:41.880 --> 3:28:44.080]  this is what Trump was mentioning in the debates.
[3:28:44.080 --> 3:28:48.320]  Do you remember at that point in the debate where he says, we have you on tape, now I've
[3:28:48.320 --> 3:28:52.160]  got you, got Obama, you're all on tape, right?
[3:28:52.160 --> 3:28:58.720]  And that's, you know, you could tell a body was getting pretty shook by that.
[3:28:58.720 --> 3:29:00.520]  But this is the model you see.
[3:29:00.520 --> 3:29:08.160]  So the regime change is really just part of the foreign entanglement, coup, transfer
[3:29:08.160 --> 3:29:16.000]  of power, so that then the new Western CIA puppet state can just allocate and suck off
[3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:21.200]  of the existing power, the people and the resources, send all that back to the big Fortune
[3:29:21.200 --> 3:29:27.440]  100 that's coming in now to offer vaccinations and abortions and whatever else the Fortune
[3:29:27.440 --> 3:29:34.040]  100 wants when they move, you know, Hillary and company company into these different countries.
[3:29:34.040 --> 3:29:40.480]  That's really what's going on here is it's a model of, you could call it American imperialism,
[3:29:40.480 --> 3:29:43.440]  but remember, that was never the American idea, right?
[3:29:43.440 --> 3:29:46.480]  The American idea was always non-interventionism.
[3:29:46.480 --> 3:29:51.560]  And as we know from the Rockefeller's biography from David's memoirs, from the CFR archives,
[3:29:51.560 --> 3:29:57.480]  they talked about how they wanted to transition America out of a non-interventionist, non-foreign
[3:29:57.480 --> 3:30:05.680]  entanglement mindset and turn it into an engine, right, of what the Empire of Britain used
[3:30:05.680 --> 3:30:06.680]  to be, right?
[3:30:06.680 --> 3:30:11.400]  Pax Britannia, Commonwealth of God, now let's make it the American Empire so that we can
[3:30:11.400 --> 3:30:15.840]  try to set up ultimately, right, this technocracy.
[3:30:15.840 --> 3:30:19.600]  And they're using America as a cloak, right, to do this, right?
[3:30:19.600 --> 3:30:21.640]  That's not what America is supposed to be about.
[3:30:21.640 --> 3:30:22.640]  We're about independence.
[3:30:22.640 --> 3:30:27.240]  We're not about trying to set up a global technocratic empire, but they've subverted
[3:30:27.240 --> 3:30:30.920]  the country and its ideals to do this very thing.
[3:30:30.920 --> 3:30:32.080]  This is Jay Dyer.
[3:30:32.080 --> 3:30:35.240]  I am hosting the Alex Jones show in the fourth hour.
[3:30:35.240 --> 3:30:39.280]  We'll be back in just a moment.
[3:30:39.280 --> 3:30:44.400]  The Bible talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the nation states
[3:30:44.400 --> 3:30:50.160]  and who give their power unto the one world leader, the Antichrist, and he has a beast
[3:30:50.160 --> 3:30:55.120]  system that no one can buy and or sell unless he has that marked in the forehead or in the
[3:30:55.120 --> 3:30:56.120]  palm of their hand.
[3:30:56.120 --> 3:31:02.160]  And we look back on all the warnings that were given and all just the common sense that
[3:31:02.160 --> 3:31:07.760]  even if we believe in God, we're promising giving governments and corporations the power
[3:31:07.760 --> 3:31:11.240]  to control who can buy and who can sell and to track everything we do.
[3:31:11.240 --> 3:31:15.880]  It's not just a recipe, it's a blueprint for total enslavement and now you look at Bill
[3:31:15.880 --> 3:31:20.840]  Gates, you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats.
[3:31:20.840 --> 3:31:25.040]  We should decide how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get, how much red meat you
[3:31:25.040 --> 3:31:26.040]  get.
[3:31:26.040 --> 3:31:27.040]  We're technocrats.
[3:31:27.040 --> 3:31:28.040]  We know best.
[3:31:28.040 --> 3:31:31.240]  We're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control you.
[3:31:31.240 --> 3:31:32.680]  You snap your fingers.
[3:31:32.680 --> 3:31:33.680]  We're here.
[3:31:33.680 --> 3:31:37.080]  They're just rolling it out and a lot of people are complying with it.
[3:31:37.080 --> 3:31:39.080]  It's insane.
[3:31:39.080 --> 3:31:43.520]  The globalists are very, very honest about their planetary goals.
[3:31:43.520 --> 3:31:50.840]  They want private corporate governance above nation-states, above religious institutions,
[3:31:50.840 --> 3:31:52.240]  above the family.
[3:31:52.240 --> 3:31:54.240]  They want total corporate power.
[3:31:54.240 --> 3:32:00.240]  There was a great film back in the early 1970s called Rollerball with James Cahn and it's
[3:32:00.240 --> 3:32:04.400]  based on a novel set in the year 2020.
[3:32:04.400 --> 3:32:09.360]  And in the book, you have megacorporations that control the planet and there are no longer
[3:32:09.360 --> 3:32:10.360]  nation-states.
[3:32:10.360 --> 3:32:14.880]  There are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations.
[3:32:14.880 --> 3:32:20.360]  But if you actually read what the most group of the CFR and the Rural Commission say in
[3:32:20.360 --> 3:32:24.520]  the year 2020, that is their in-game, that is their goal.
[3:32:24.520 --> 3:32:29.560]  So we're talking about a Hunger Games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless
[3:32:29.560 --> 3:32:31.560]  people to see us as chattel.
[3:32:31.560 --> 3:32:36.320]  They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy and Communist China as their model.
[3:32:36.320 --> 3:32:39.320]  We must reject it now.
[3:32:39.320 --> 3:32:42.680]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[3:32:42.680 --> 3:32:44.680]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[3:32:44.680 --> 3:32:46.680]  Is your city too safe?
[3:32:46.680 --> 3:32:48.680]  Well, not anymore.
[3:32:48.680 --> 3:32:50.680]  Introducing Democrats.
[3:32:50.680 --> 3:32:57.480]  Politicians so incompetent, they'll fill your neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant
[3:32:57.480 --> 3:33:01.480]  violence, and even homelessness.
[3:33:01.480 --> 3:33:06.480]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity.
[3:33:06.480 --> 3:33:08.480]  No more pesky law and order.
[3:33:08.480 --> 3:33:12.480]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[3:33:12.480 --> 3:33:17.480]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[3:33:17.480 --> 3:33:18.480]  But wait.
[3:33:18.480 --> 3:33:25.480]  Vote for Democrats now and bail include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture,
[3:33:25.480 --> 3:33:28.480]  taxes, and more taxes.
[3:33:28.480 --> 3:33:32.480]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[3:33:32.480 --> 3:33:43.480]  If you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and control them,
[3:33:43.480 --> 3:33:48.480]  to a man and to a woman, they believe there's too many people on the earth and they constantly
[3:33:48.480 --> 3:33:52.480]  whine about when they want to go to a mountain top or a national park, they have to look
[3:33:52.480 --> 3:33:54.480]  at us, the common people.
[3:33:54.480 --> 3:33:57.480]  They have to look at the proletariat, they have to look at the scum.
[3:33:57.480 --> 3:34:00.480]  That's why they love the lockdown, putting muzzles on us.
[3:34:00.480 --> 3:34:04.480]  That gives them a big thrill, controlling where we can go, what we can do.
[3:34:04.480 --> 3:34:07.480]  Bankrupting Main Street, bankrupting small towns.
[3:34:07.480 --> 3:34:12.480]  All of it is a vertical integration, consolidation, so they can then dictate the terms of our
[3:34:12.480 --> 3:34:17.480]  total surrender, which is taking sterile vaccines day one.
[3:34:17.480 --> 3:34:19.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, all the games are over.
[3:34:19.480 --> 3:34:21.480]  Playtime's over.
[3:34:21.480 --> 3:34:25.480]  We used all the entertainment and garbage to put us into a trance, and now the spider's
[3:34:25.480 --> 3:34:26.480]  moving in for the kill.
[3:34:26.480 --> 3:34:29.480]  You know this, I know this, it's all out in the open.
[3:34:29.480 --> 3:34:31.480]  The question is, what are we going to do about it?
[3:34:31.480 --> 3:34:33.480]  Well, the first thing is identify the enemy.
[3:34:33.480 --> 3:34:38.480]  Identify the enemy, identify the enemy, identify your enemy now.
[3:34:38.480 --> 3:34:43.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:35:09.480 --> 3:35:14.480]  A lot of this stuff has come out in the last four years regarding these scandals of Weinstein,
[3:35:14.480 --> 3:35:15.480]  Epstein, all that kind of stuff.
[3:35:15.480 --> 3:35:20.480]  You can read my book, Esther Hollywood One and Two, where I covered that stuff years ago.
[3:35:20.480 --> 3:35:26.480]  I said, blogged for a long time about how Hollywood was corrupt and kind of destroying
[3:35:26.480 --> 3:35:32.480]  the culture through their toxic symbolism and their esoteric meanings that they put into
[3:35:32.480 --> 3:35:33.480]  their films.
[3:35:33.480 --> 3:35:38.480]  And you can, if you want a signed copy, you can go to Jay's analysis in the shop.
[3:35:38.480 --> 3:35:41.480]  As you can see, we've got hundreds of five-star ratings there.
[3:35:41.480 --> 3:35:45.480]  You can get the signed copies at my website as a little bit of an advantage over what
[3:35:45.480 --> 3:35:47.480]  you see there at Amazon.
[3:35:47.480 --> 3:35:54.480]  Now, there was a great article I was covering in the last segment about that DNI memo.
[3:35:54.480 --> 3:35:56.480]  And there's a great article that came out.
[3:35:56.480 --> 3:36:02.480]  I told you a long time ago, Hillary Clinton's team helped fabricate the Trump-Russia collusion
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:04.480]  by Larry C. Johnson.
[3:36:04.480 --> 3:36:08.480]  And I mentioned Larry's article because he has this memo here.
[3:36:08.480 --> 3:36:14.480]  And then he mentions the fact that thanks to this, to one of the WikiLeaks' emails,
[3:36:14.480 --> 3:36:18.480]  we have a copy of an exchange between Hillary's campaign manager, John Podesta,
[3:36:18.480 --> 3:36:24.480]  and longtime Democrat operative Brent Badowski, talking about how Hillary should take on the
[3:36:24.480 --> 3:36:25.480]  Donald.
[3:36:25.480 --> 3:36:30.480]  Badowski tells Podesta, the best approach is to slaughter Donald for his bromance with
[3:36:30.480 --> 3:36:34.480]  Putin, but do not go too far betting on Putin in Syria.
[3:36:34.480 --> 3:36:41.480]  So, here's another sort of attestation to what's in that memo that even in the emails,
[3:36:41.480 --> 3:36:47.480]  we know that that was one of their strategies was to cook up and go after him on this to,
[3:36:47.480 --> 3:36:50.480]  again, distract from these emails.
[3:36:50.480 --> 3:36:52.480]  Now, what is in these emails?
[3:36:52.480 --> 3:36:53.480]  Well, there's a lot of speculation.
[3:36:53.480 --> 3:36:58.480]  There's a lot of claims, a lot of probably dirt, blackmail, all that kinds of stuff,
[3:36:58.480 --> 3:37:02.480]  compromising, and probably all kinds of other stuff, right?
[3:37:02.480 --> 3:37:07.480]  Kickback stories about what the purpose of Gaddafi, all that kind of stuff.
[3:37:07.480 --> 3:37:14.480]  I'm sure there's no end probably to the onion rings and layers of all of these scams and
[3:37:14.480 --> 3:37:15.480]  scandals.
[3:37:15.480 --> 3:37:20.480]  And so, it's just amazing that this has all come out now.
[3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:24.480]  And it's almost like it's, again, a satire of a spy movie, right?
[3:37:24.480 --> 3:37:27.480]  I mean, you think about spy movies and you see, you know, Blofeld and the Bond villains
[3:37:27.480 --> 3:37:32.480]  and they're cooking up these wild, crazy machinations and schemes and you think,
[3:37:32.480 --> 3:37:34.480]  well, that's a Bond movie.
[3:37:34.480 --> 3:37:38.480]  No, no, when Ian Fleming wrote all that, he was talking about stuff that he had seen
[3:37:38.480 --> 3:37:43.480]  in terms of, you know, real world billionaire villains, these kinds of people.
[3:37:43.480 --> 3:37:44.480]  And that's what they do.
[3:37:44.480 --> 3:37:47.480]  We really do have billionaires cooking up this stuff.
[3:37:47.480 --> 3:37:53.480]  And when we understand this bigger narrative now from the great game and up into the modern
[3:37:53.480 --> 3:37:58.480]  post-Cold War era of the Color Revolutions, Brzezinski's Ark of Crisis is also another
[3:37:58.480 --> 3:38:00.480]  way to understand this stuff.
[3:38:00.480 --> 3:38:05.480]  When we have that in our mind, we can now understand a lot of these other little stories that pop
[3:38:05.480 --> 3:38:06.480]  up, right?
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:09.480]  Like the Novichok stories of these spies, right?
[3:38:09.480 --> 3:38:14.480]  The Skripal affair, this more recent poisoning of a defector.
[3:38:14.480 --> 3:38:16.480]  These are created stories.
[3:38:16.480 --> 3:38:22.480]  And even a French intelligence analyst came out and said that these stories of people
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:26.480]  defecting and being poisoned by Putin's agents, they're all made up.
[3:38:26.480 --> 3:38:28.480]  There's no evidence of Novichok.
[3:38:28.480 --> 3:38:33.480]  There's no evidence of Skripal and these people being poisoned and that Putin has all these
[3:38:33.480 --> 3:38:35.480]  cells everywhere that are doing all this stuff.
[3:38:35.480 --> 3:38:41.480]  It's just completely fabricated and created to prop up just the same kind of boogeyman
[3:38:41.480 --> 3:38:47.480]  narrative of Russia that was going on throughout this whole last four years.
[3:38:47.480 --> 3:38:51.480]  And it's interesting too that we hear all about Russia, but we're not hearing a whole
[3:38:51.480 --> 3:38:53.480]  lot about China.
[3:38:53.480 --> 3:38:56.480]  What about the Office of Personnel hack, right?
[3:38:56.480 --> 3:38:58.480]  What about that Alex always talks about?
[3:38:58.480 --> 3:39:06.480]  What about the many instances where Chinese students who have been excused from attending
[3:39:06.480 --> 3:39:08.480]  different universities in the US, right?
[3:39:08.480 --> 3:39:11.480]  Because some of those are intelligence operations, right?
[3:39:11.480 --> 3:39:14.480]  So there's the exchange students.
[3:39:14.480 --> 3:39:17.480]  Shocker is sometimes a cover for espionage.
[3:39:17.480 --> 3:39:23.480]  And if I recall, I think Trump a couple of years ago excused or sort of got rid of a
[3:39:23.480 --> 3:39:25.480]  lot of these exchange programs.
[3:39:25.480 --> 3:39:28.480]  Yeah, that's because it's involved in espionage, right?
[3:39:28.480 --> 3:39:36.480]  Remember, I think it was at the Feinstein or one of her staffers was a Chinese spy.
[3:39:36.480 --> 3:39:40.480]  We know that this ties into Wuhan and all that stuff, right?
[3:39:40.480 --> 3:39:46.480]  So there's really big level of games being played here and the global elites are aligned.
[3:39:46.480 --> 3:39:50.480]  It doesn't look to me like they're more so aligned with Russia, but they're using, I
[3:39:50.480 --> 3:39:54.480]  would say more so China to be the model of the future, right?
[3:39:54.480 --> 3:39:56.480]  Isn't it going to be the Chinese century, right?
[3:39:56.480 --> 3:39:58.480]  The Chinese era that we're going into.
[3:39:58.480 --> 3:40:00.480]  Now, I'm not saying that it makes China bad.
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:02.480]  It's not the people of China, right?
[3:40:02.480 --> 3:40:04.480]  That are bad guys or something like that.
[3:40:04.480 --> 3:40:09.480]  It's rather recalling the fact that David Rockefeller, the OSS, that's who went into
[3:40:09.480 --> 3:40:13.480]  China and set up the Maoist regime.
[3:40:13.480 --> 3:40:17.480]  So again, it's not America versus the people of America versus the people of China.
[3:40:17.480 --> 3:40:18.480]  No, no, no.
[3:40:18.480 --> 3:40:24.480]  There's a technocratic global elite that sits higher up above and views the world as a chess
[3:40:24.480 --> 3:40:25.480]  board.
[3:40:25.480 --> 3:40:29.480]  Remember, Brzezinski's book, The Grand Chess Board, that moves these pieces around to cause
[3:40:29.480 --> 3:40:34.480]  the friction at a lower level, that they're at a higher level engineering so that there
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:36.480]  can be a synthesis down the road.
[3:40:36.480 --> 3:40:38.480]  What is that synthesis, right?
[3:40:38.480 --> 3:40:43.480]  I've heard probably David Ike, other people talk about thesis, antithesis, synthesis,
[3:40:43.480 --> 3:40:44.480]  right?
[3:40:44.480 --> 3:40:45.480]  Problem reaction solution.
[3:40:45.480 --> 3:40:46.480]  That is the model.
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:47.480]  And that's a technique.
[3:40:47.480 --> 3:40:48.480]  It does come from Hegel.
[3:40:48.480 --> 3:40:50.480]  It does come from Marx.
[3:40:50.480 --> 3:40:56.480]  They utilize that philosophical notion of smashing things together to produce a new reality and
[3:40:56.480 --> 3:40:57.480]  new synthesis.
[3:40:57.480 --> 3:41:02.480]  That is the model of color revolutions, of regime change, of engineer revolutions, you
[3:41:02.480 --> 3:41:05.480]  see, to take things to a specific place down the road.
[3:41:05.480 --> 3:41:10.480]  And as we saw, the place down the road here is the technocracy.
[3:41:10.480 --> 3:41:13.480]  Now, why are they so mad at Trump right now?
[3:41:13.480 --> 3:41:16.480]  Well, obviously for a lot of reasons, calling out the media for so long.
[3:41:16.480 --> 3:41:20.480]  And it's actually the media that has fostered all of this revolutionary ethos in America
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:22.480]  that keeps propping up this narrative.
[3:41:22.480 --> 3:41:27.480]  There would be nothing to the Russiagate stuff if the media did not keep perpetuating it
[3:41:27.480 --> 3:41:30.480]  incessantly for the last four years, right?
[3:41:30.480 --> 3:41:35.480]  You've even taken us into this ridiculous impeachment story, which is all based on this nonsense,
[3:41:35.480 --> 3:41:36.480]  right?
[3:41:36.480 --> 3:41:37.480]  Now that's all fallen apart.
[3:41:37.480 --> 3:41:38.880]  And oh, don't worry about that.
[3:41:38.880 --> 3:41:41.480]  Now we're on to, you know, COVID and this kind of stuff.
[3:41:41.480 --> 3:41:42.480]  Forget about that stuff, right?
[3:41:42.480 --> 3:41:48.480]  It's time to move into the new drama of the week with all this COVID nonsense.
[3:41:48.480 --> 3:41:49.480]  But they're doing that.
[3:41:49.480 --> 3:41:53.240]  I'm saying the media is talking about all that because they do not and will not ever talk
[3:41:53.240 --> 3:41:56.480]  about what you see here in this clip with Kevin McCarthy.
[3:41:56.480 --> 3:41:58.480]  If you would roll that clip.
[3:41:58.480 --> 3:42:04.480]  When director Radcliffe released this, the leaders of Congress wanted to have a meeting
[3:42:04.480 --> 3:42:09.480]  because no one in Congress, the House or the Senate has ever seen this information,
[3:42:09.480 --> 3:42:12.480]  even though we have spent all these years investigating.
[3:42:12.480 --> 3:42:16.480]  Now let's walk through and remember, I must be careful here because some of this is still
[3:42:16.480 --> 3:42:17.480]  classified.
[3:42:17.480 --> 3:42:19.480]  But let's talk about what's in Radcliffe's letter.
[3:42:19.480 --> 3:42:25.480]  First we find out in July of 2016 that Russian intelligence had picked up that Hillary Clinton's
[3:42:25.480 --> 3:42:31.480]  campaign was going to create a false narrative of Trump and Russia colluding.
[3:42:31.480 --> 3:42:38.480]  We now find out in July 26th that the CIA director, in his own notes, briefs the president
[3:42:38.480 --> 3:42:42.480]  on this, Brennan, to President Obama.
[3:42:42.480 --> 3:42:47.480]  Then just this Wednesday, Comey gets asked a question about this referral that you just
[3:42:47.480 --> 3:42:49.480]  talked about for in September.
[3:42:49.480 --> 3:42:51.480]  He says it doesn't ring a bell.
[3:42:51.480 --> 3:42:55.480]  But I've seen the underlying proof, but inside Radcliffe's letter, this referral from the
[3:42:55.480 --> 3:43:00.480]  CIA was sent to the FBI, to Peter Struck and to Comey.
[3:43:00.480 --> 3:43:05.480]  Now remember Peter Struck, he was on Crossfire Hurricane and the Mueller report, and never
[3:43:05.480 --> 3:43:11.480]  once did this intelligence show up anywhere in any of those investigations or to Congress
[3:43:11.480 --> 3:43:12.480]  or to the Senate.
[3:43:12.480 --> 3:43:16.480]  So what we know with all of this, and I know everything that's going on this week, this
[3:43:16.480 --> 3:43:22.480]  is the biggest news that didn't get reported, that we find out that there was no collusion
[3:43:22.480 --> 3:43:28.480]  between Trump and Russia, that it was created by Hillary Clinton in a campaign in July of
[3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:34.480]  2016, that the CIA director, John Brennan, that the FBI director, Comey, and the president
[3:43:34.480 --> 3:43:40.480]  of the United States, Barack Obama, all knew about that and was never brought to Congress.
[3:43:40.480 --> 3:43:45.480]  And we have wasted two years in this Congress and all the time before wanting to get this
[3:43:45.480 --> 3:43:47.480]  information, asking the questions.
[3:43:47.480 --> 3:43:51.480]  So another question that comes up, who has withheld this information?
[3:43:51.480 --> 3:43:57.480]  Credit to director Radcliffe for that transparency of releasing it to the House and Senate.
[3:43:57.480 --> 3:44:01.480]  Every member of Congress should read the underlying information behind this.
[3:44:01.480 --> 3:44:06.480]  This is really a bombshell of what we have wasted so much time on, that it was created
[3:44:06.480 --> 3:44:11.480]  by Hillary Clinton, President Obama knew it, John Brennan knew it, and Comey knew it,
[3:44:11.480 --> 3:44:17.480]  and never gave the information to the American public, let known to Congress or the Senate.
[3:44:17.480 --> 3:44:19.480]  There you go, exactly.
[3:44:19.480 --> 3:44:24.480]  Summarizing what was in that memo and what is the purpose of all this?
[3:44:24.480 --> 3:44:26.480]  Why is there such a freak out?
[3:44:26.480 --> 3:44:27.480]  Why is all this going on?
[3:44:27.480 --> 3:44:32.480]  Again, what did Trump say a week or two ago when they were asking him about why he's so
[3:44:32.480 --> 3:44:33.480]  unliked?
[3:44:33.480 --> 3:44:37.480]  He said he's got a lot of people in the deep state, military industrial complex, they
[3:44:37.480 --> 3:44:41.480]  don't like him because he doesn't want us involved in all of these foreign entanglements
[3:44:41.480 --> 3:44:42.480]  and wars.
[3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:43.480]  That's the old idea of America.
[3:44:43.480 --> 3:44:44.480]  That's what's right.
[3:44:44.480 --> 3:44:46.480]  That's what we want to do, right?
[3:44:46.480 --> 3:44:48.480]  And that's why they're so mad at Trump, right?
[3:44:48.480 --> 3:44:52.480]  All of these people, these big pharma, the military industrial complex, they do not want
[3:44:52.480 --> 3:44:58.480]  to see any loss of this gigantic money-making scam that they have going, ruining all of
[3:44:58.480 --> 3:45:02.480]  these other countries, causing all this war and devastation, and that's why they're so
[3:45:02.480 --> 3:45:03.480]  mad at Trump.
[3:45:03.480 --> 3:45:07.480]  And that is that great line that he had a week or two ago, right?
[3:45:07.480 --> 3:45:12.480]  Is that he wants to keep America as what America should be and non-interventionist power.
[3:45:12.480 --> 3:45:14.480]  And that's why we're collapsing.
[3:45:14.480 --> 3:45:19.480]  We're an empire that's over-extended in all these other countries, and we don't have the
[3:45:19.480 --> 3:45:22.480]  virtue that we used to have, and that's what we need to get back to.
