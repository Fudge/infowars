[00:00.000 --> 00:22.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:22.000 --> 00:38.000]  It's Wednesday, the 7th day already of February 2018. We're going to be live here with my transmission for the next four hours.
[00:38.000 --> 00:41.000]  And there's more in Full Wars transmissions coming up after that.
[00:41.000 --> 00:47.000]  There's so much to cover today, but there's a new talking point that Trump is turning America into North Korea.
[00:47.000 --> 00:54.000]  ABC News, CBS CNN, MSNBC, and we're going to be breaking all that down today.
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  Pence says the U.S. to unveil the most aggressive North Korea sanctions ever.
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.000]  And now North Korea officially says they fear a preemptive bloody nose.
[01:03.000 --> 01:11.000]  So that is going to be broken down today. Bull or bear all eyes on the U.S. markets as they gyrate up and down wildly.
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.000]  That's coming up as well.
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.000]  But first, a report from John Bowne on the North Korea crisis.
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  He asked about what he was basing his claims on.
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  Wood also labeled North Korea's latest South Korean show of diplomacy as a charm offensive.
[01:51.000 --> 01:57.000]  The situation on the Korean Peninsula has not changed.
[01:57.000 --> 02:07.000]  The regime continues to work on its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  What I would call charm offensive, frankly, is fooling no one.
[02:11.000 --> 02:18.000]  The DPRK is frantically warning that a preemptive bloody nose attack by the United States is imminent.
[02:18.000 --> 02:25.000]  Al Jazeera reported young Chul said U.S. officials, including the defense secretary and the CIA director,
[02:25.000 --> 02:34.000]  repeatedly talked about a DPRK nuclear and missile threat to justify their argument for a military option and a new concept of a so-called bloody nose.
[02:34.000 --> 02:40.000]  Meanwhile, Guam sits under the most imminent threat of an attack by the DPRK.
[02:40.000 --> 02:51.000]  A couple of Guam are proud to host the continued bomber presence and one leg of the nuclear triad with the recent addition of the B-2 and B-52 bombers.
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  Considering the bomber presence and as the westernmost territory of the United States,
[02:57.000 --> 03:06.000]  Guam holds vital strategic bases and I'm happy to see the department place a THAAB system to aid in its defense.
[03:06.000 --> 03:13.000]  However, in your strategy, you call for investment on layered missile defense from North Korean threats.
[03:13.000 --> 03:20.000]  Considering our strategic importance, is Guam adequately defended from theater missile threats
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  and how do you intend to bolster these defense systems in the future?
[03:25.000 --> 03:31.000]  Well, we will continue bolstering them to keep pace with the threat out of North Korea.
[03:31.000 --> 03:43.000]  Besides the THAAB system, we also keep the ballistic missile defense US Navy warships in the waters out there and we can always reinforce that.
[03:43.000 --> 03:57.000]  We also have several of those ships in Japanese waters right now and they can move back and forth to include coverage of Guam in the mobile way that comes to our Navy.
[03:57.000 --> 04:06.000]  But we are looking at all the systems to include Aegis ashore as we look toward the future protection of our Pacific area.
[04:06.000 --> 04:18.000]  Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I think we've talked about this. Just keep Guam in a secure position and keep all the bombers and everything else you have there for a while anyway.
[04:18.000 --> 04:27.000]  And as the Winter Olympics create a veneer of diplomacy, a new US ambassador to South Korea has yet to be nominated after the previous nominee,
[04:27.000 --> 04:36.000]  Dr. Victor Chow will no longer be considered after he criticized the Trump administration's threats to back out of a bilateral trade agreement with Seoul.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  So how imminent is this threat?
[04:39.000 --> 04:51.000]  Well, the Hill reports last year the DPRK tested a ballistic missile that experts believe is capable of reaching the US mainland, though the country isn't believed to be able to mount a nuclear device on the missile.
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.000]  Experts say North Korea is close, however, to reaching that milestone.
[04:55.000 --> 05:10.000]  John Bown reporting for Infowars.com.
[05:26.000 --> 05:34.000]  We say a fungus is a scourge, molds a scourge, and you can't battle it with this in your sinus or other areas, but in your gut, the main area you can.

[06:22.000 --> 06:36.000]  We played the clip yesterday. I intend to play it again at the start of the next segment with the president addressing a large crowd through down the gauntlet.
[06:36.000 --> 06:54.000]  And he simply said the truth, that the Democratic Party are the enemies of an American recovery. They are treasonous, and they're out to get the American people.
[06:54.000 --> 07:19.000]  And I was thinking about that line and that song, Lynn Greenwald, I think is his name, where he talks about proud to be an American, and the flag still stands for freedom, and they can't take that away.
[07:19.000 --> 07:25.000]  And I remember growing up hearing that and thinking, I love America, but that's a little cheesy.
[07:25.000 --> 07:40.000]  But as you get older, you learn that's how criminals operate, is that once they get control, they want to take everything away from you, and modern liberals are just criminals.
[07:40.000 --> 08:03.000]  And studies show that, depending on the studies, six to nine times more likely, British, U.S. studies, Canadian studies, by liberal universities, by the psychology departments, that they're way meaner, give way less charity and steal.
[08:03.000 --> 08:20.000]  And it's because they're weak. And so, when they get in positions of power, they seek to divide everybody, to control everybody, to dumb everybody down, because they feel weak, and they want to manage them.
[08:20.000 --> 08:49.000]  So a leftist, modern leftist, which is really just a mentally ill criminal, with a psychology of crime, a twisted algorithm of sustaining themselves, they seek to play the victim at the low level to guilt those around them under their control.
[08:49.000 --> 09:02.000]  It's really a sign of immaturity as well. It's an arrested development. Everybody knows spoiled rotten children will try to guilt you into doing what they want.
[09:02.000 --> 09:30.000]  Everybody knows that spoiled rotten children, when studied in the main, are the same around the world, that they hatch little plots and devious manipulations. Instead of just going out and boldly leading and being successful, and on its face, you got a pretty good idea growing up in school, who's going to end up being steadfast, who's going to be successful, who's going to be stalwart, who's going to be inventive,
[09:30.000 --> 09:40.000]  and who's going to be corrupt, who's going to be evil. You can also tell who's going to fight, who the warriors are.
[09:40.000 --> 10:07.000]  And the system seeks to arrest the development of individuals, so they can control them throughout their lives, in like an endless junior high eddy pool or groundhog day of control. So before we get into all this news, I thought it critical, absolutely critical,
[10:07.000 --> 10:33.000]  to talk about the psychology of these people, and just that line, the flag still stands for freedom, and they can't take that away when I saw MSNBC and CNN and all of the different channels.
[10:33.000 --> 10:46.000]  Over and over and over again saying, you can't have a family, you can't have a church, and you can't like people that are in the military.
[10:46.000 --> 11:10.000]  So if I could see the old American instincts and not want to have troops on the streets and not want to be under martial law, I certainly understand that. But they're saying you can't even have it. You can't even respect anybody that's doing that because you see it shows what globalist outsiders they are and how they're committed to overthrowing the country.
[11:10.000 --> 11:30.000]  So we need the other side of that after 18 years, since 1991, we've not had a military parade in this country, and Trump says the Russians have them, the French have them, the British have them.
[11:30.000 --> 11:46.000]  But see, as a globalist, George Herbert Walker Bush wanted to use our military to break up the Middle East and take over areas and start the class of civilizations destabilization, but then he wanted to make it a UN operation and make our military itself shameful.
[11:46.000 --> 12:05.000]  So part of taking America back is having a wall, is having visas, is having sovereignty, and is supporting the men and women who served in our military and who serve in it now, not because you're in a cult of worshiping the military,
[12:05.000 --> 12:21.000]  but because you understand the globalist want to take that away from you and demoralize the nation so we can be controlled. And everything Trump's doing is to stop the demoralization.
[12:21.000 --> 12:37.000]  And he's been critical of the NSA spying, and he's talking to William Benning through the CIA director about a system that doesn't spy on everybody, that actually uses algorithms when somebody really travels here, really makes these statements,
[12:37.000 --> 12:46.000]  and then you have human intelligence and it's all integrated and it works a thousand times better than scanning everything, which is really just used for political control.
[12:46.000 --> 12:57.000]  So I know for a fact Trump's even moving us in the right direction that way, and not wanting to have a bunch of nation building.
[12:57.000 --> 13:11.000]  And Trump was critical of the bill, but as they said it was tied to all the spending and he said my hands are tied until we reform this system, because that's the system that is in place, hundreds of billions of dollars.
[13:11.000 --> 13:22.000]  And they've got my hands tied saying terrorists are going to kill us any minute. If we don't turn this thing off, well we're moving to put something in that actually works from the original guy that actually built what became this monstrosity,
[13:22.000 --> 13:34.000]  William Benning. He's the engineer of the big mastermind they admit, even his enemies that developed all this and they took it away and said we're going to use it to surveil everybody.
[13:34.000 --> 13:43.000]  And he started saying you're insane. Number one, that means you won't be able to track all the real threats when you look at everybody and everything constantly.
[13:43.000 --> 13:52.000]  All that is used for is total control.
[13:52.000 --> 14:08.000]  Trump has a long way to go in the surveillance and he knows he's been targeted with it as well. But the idea that we can't even have a military parade to celebrate whether you support all these wars or not, how long these people have served the longest serving
[14:08.000 --> 14:29.000]  military on average in world history, 20 tours, 30 tours. My cousin was in the army, he got extended 37 years and was deployed for over 25 years of it in combat zones all over the world.
[14:29.000 --> 14:40.000]  And of course volunteered and wishes they put him back in but his back's completely disintegrated from jumping out of helicopters and carrying all those packs.
[14:40.000 --> 14:50.000]  He's about six inches shorter than when I was a teenager. But it's just insane that you can't ever have that because the media said so.
[14:50.000 --> 15:00.000]  I've got stacks of articles where they're saying you can't say mother and father, you can't say family, you can't say he or she, that hurts someone else who isn't a he or she, that's pure biological warfare.
[15:00.000 --> 15:08.000]  The globalists admit it's to target the family, which they said on MSNBC last week and CNN you can't have and Trump shouldn't have talked about family.
[15:08.000 --> 15:26.000]  And Trudeau goes, we're people kind, not mankind. And that's just the beginning, you see, of how it starts. He's the prime minister putting out the soft pedal, but down at the school level, they're telling children in Canada, nationwide,
[15:26.000 --> 15:36.000]  they're doing it in spots here that you're purple penguins. There are no boys or girls. Talk about trying to whack job people. That's how you depopulate and that's even in the news.
[15:36.000 --> 15:47.000]  That's coming up. They admit, oh, transgenderism is great. There won't be any people. See, it's not about the transgenderism starts with men that want to be women or vice versa.
[15:47.000 --> 15:56.000]  And then it becomes transhumanism. That's how they set up the idea of you can't criticize giving up your humanity and identifying as a fire hydrant if you want.
[15:56.000 --> 16:08.000]  It's mainlining mental illness, fully cooked, ready to eat bacon. I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious. I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[16:08.000 --> 16:20.000]  Awesome. No refrigeration needed with a 10 year shelf life, NASA pack technology, bacon, fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon or warm and served.

[16:29.000 --> 16:39.000]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place. And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[18:09.000 --> 18:17.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[18:17.000 --> 18:22.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[19:00.000 --> 19:15.000]  Infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[19:15.000 --> 19:29.000]  This is pollen block. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like running nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[19:29.000 --> 19:48.000]  They began studying the effects in their published trials. Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[19:48.000 --> 20:00.000]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block. Available now at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[20:18.000 --> 20:22.000]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[20:22.000 --> 20:38.000]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind. There was something so pleasant about that place. Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[20:38.000 --> 21:06.000]  Coming up, there have been some really big developments with the ongoing drip drip drip of devastating information coming out, dealing with the whole situation that is unfolding around the Clinton criminal combo
[21:06.000 --> 21:17.000]  inside of the stay-behind networks put in place by the Clintons, the Obamas, and others in the FBI and the Justice Department.
[21:17.000 --> 21:29.000]  And we're going to be covering that coming up some in the next segment. We're going to get to the latest on North Korea, fearing a preemptive bloody nose and so much more.
[21:29.000 --> 21:47.000]  And I will today get to important news reports coming out of the UK where they are openly on television saying any criticism in public or online of transgenderism should be banned and outlawed.
[21:47.000 --> 21:59.000]  And then the reporter says back to the other reporter, but then that would ban you being able to be critical of me. They're like, oh no, we'll still be able to basically. So the lady is then speechless.
[21:59.000 --> 22:09.000]  It's an amazing video. It's up on infowars.com and that is going to be coming up as well also on newswars.com.
[22:09.000 --> 22:18.000]  Incredible. Professors' defense of free speech leaves regressive leftists literally speechless.
[22:18.000 --> 22:37.000]  Paul Joseph Watson article on infowars.com. And I'm going to totally decode today what the entire transgenderism situation is about.
[22:37.000 --> 22:49.000]  We're also going to have Tommy Robinson on from the UK where Muslims threatened to kill him and his family online, even say who they are and the police won't do anything.
[22:49.000 --> 22:56.000]  So he tracks them down and goes to their house and confronts them.
[22:56.000 --> 23:18.000]  And when you realize that 80% of the Muslims in the UK are on welfare and are like spoiled brats and self-propelled stomachs, it's just amazing to see people that come from third world hell holes getting so angry at the countries that have rolled out the red carpet to them.
[23:18.000 --> 23:31.000]  It makes the head spin. So that's going to be coming up today as well. And it ties in to the program to bring down the West.
[23:31.000 --> 23:41.000]  If something's destructive, if something's coercive, if something causes disunity, if something refuses to assimilate, then it is brought in.
[23:41.000 --> 23:50.000]  If it's constructive, it's blocked, it's sabotaged. That's the plan. It's the same thing with food. It's the same thing with the water.
[23:50.000 --> 24:08.000]  It's the same thing with everything. We are targeted by the uber mentions, by the globalists who believe that they are the supermen and because they're not supermen and they're not better than us, they have to mutate us and attack us and make us dumb so they can suddenly be super.
[24:08.000 --> 24:24.000]  Because if they're a bunch of hunchbacked, inbred, psychopathic, neurotic, paranoid, so-called elitist, alpha scum, alpha maggots, then they have to make us below them to raise themselves.
[24:24.000 --> 24:50.000]  True ugliness, true spiritual ugliness, true intent-hate to take everything that we are and put it in a meat grinder for their sick pleasure.
[24:50.000 --> 25:01.000]  And I know I harp on this, despite the fact I've got hundreds of articles, 20, 30 incredible video clips, I just have to keep explaining to everybody and I'll get to the clip next segment.
[25:01.000 --> 25:14.000]  I said I'd get to it this segment, but we're going to pull it up of Trump that I played yesterday, talking about how the Democrats are treasonous and how they're out to sabotage and out to hurt everybody.
[25:14.000 --> 25:41.000]  If you look at the sullen collection of scum on the Democratic side of the aisle, when they were refusing to stand for the veterans for anything, if you look at their attitudes during the entire State of the Union,
[25:41.000 --> 26:06.000]  there's mind blowing, the sullenness, the hate, the petulance, the immaturity mixed with a cryptkeeper, physiology, bodies, like reanimated corpses, zombies, they only light in their eyes that of a dull wish to drag us down with them.
[26:06.000 --> 26:14.000]  It's metaphorical. Why do the zombies want brains? Because they don't have it.
[26:14.000 --> 26:26.000]  A bunch of stuffed peacocks, self important manipulators who are total culture manipulators, and no they aren't.
[26:26.000 --> 26:46.000]  We're going to go to break and come back with all of that straight ahead. You know, we're rolling out new products every couple weeks here at M4s because there are hundreds and hundreds of staple high quality supplements out there that we can go to the biggest manufacturers,
[26:46.000 --> 26:58.000]  the highest quality, and then put it out and discount it direct to you, and then you can fund our operation, which then promotes freedom and true diversity and true security.
[26:58.000 --> 27:06.000]  The absolute definition of symbiotic relationship, non zero sum game, 360 win.
[27:06.000 --> 27:16.000]  And so we are now announcing the newest product, Ikaran, 30 day liver cleanse, and it's also a kidney cleanse.
[27:16.000 --> 27:25.000]  But on the front, it says liver cleanse, but it actually also helps the kidneys and it's documented 100%.
[27:25.000 --> 27:49.000]  To have amongst the strongest concentrated milk thistle extract, 600 milligrams per powdered large caplet, they're close to horse pill size, with the compound of milk thistle.
[27:49.000 --> 28:05.000]  And the in acetyl cysteine, the organic amylifruit, organic bublarium root, hard to pronounce these, organic licorice root, organic artichoke leaf, and many more.
[28:05.000 --> 28:20.000]  These are the known compounds in every culture and every society, and they've created drugs with the concentrates of these as well to flush the liver and flush the kidneys.
[28:20.000 --> 28:26.000]  And in this world where we're bombarded, if you don't do a regimen of this a couple times a year, I think you're crazy.
[28:26.000 --> 28:38.000]  And I did a few years ago a big milk thistle cleanse and I mean my urine was like, look like, look like antifreeze or something.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  And it's so important to do this show.
[28:40.000 --> 28:48.000]  Ikaran, 30 day liver and kidney cleanse is now available at m4warstore.com or m4warslife.com.
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.000]  It supports healthy liver function, promotes kidney function, helps detoxify your body and so much more.
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.000]  So make sure yourself to go read all it does at m4warslife.com.
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.000]  Get a bottle of 50% off out of the gates.

[33:21.000 --> 33:25.000]  All from Lines of the Information War.
[33:25.000 --> 33:32.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:32.000 --> 33:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Again, thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday edition.
[33:39.000 --> 33:51.000]  I want to write out of the gates here before I get into the latest situation with the deep state trying to kill the recovery and take Donald Trump out of office and then federalize the elections.
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  We'll never really have another free election again after that.
[33:53.000 --> 34:04.000]  Before I do that, I wanted to just play this clip again. I normally play clips two days in a row, but the president talking about the Democrats obstructing our recovery really ought to get us.
[34:04.000 --> 34:09.000]  And the fact that they are really engaged in treason because it's one thing to have your political views.
[34:09.000 --> 34:22.000]  It's another thing to try to overthrow the American system and have a revolution against it and bring in the failed system that all these other countries have had, but that helps the elites that crave total control.
[34:22.000 --> 34:28.000]  The people that want cults of power. So here is the president.
[34:28.000 --> 34:38.000]  I said you have the lowest black unemployment in the history of our country. It was like, it was a game. You know, they play games.
[34:38.000 --> 34:48.000]  They were told don't even make a facial movement. And I'm talking about you have the lowest Hispanic unemployment in the history of our country.
[34:48.000 --> 34:58.000]  This isn't me said this is the charts, the polls. We have the lowest in the history of our country, dead silence, not a smile.
[34:58.000 --> 35:04.000]  In fact, there was one guy when I said the lowest African American unemployment.
[35:04.000 --> 35:17.000]  He was sort of clapping like, who was that guy? He's a nice guy. I think he was a reverend and he was I wouldn't say it was exactly a rousing, but he he was putting his hands together.
[35:17.000 --> 35:27.000]  And I want to find out who he is. I'm going to send him a letter of thank you. And he was probably severely reprimanded. Don't you think Rob? I think so because he was the only one.
[35:27.000 --> 35:37.000]  So that means they would rather see Trump do badly. Okay, then our country do well. That's what it means. It's very selfish.
[35:37.000 --> 35:48.000]  And it got to a point where I really didn't even want to look too much during the speech over to that side because honestly, it was bad energy.
[35:48.000 --> 35:59.000]  No, it was bad energy. You're up there. You've got half the room going totally crazy wild. They loved everything. They want to do something great for our country.
[35:59.000 --> 36:13.000]  And you have the other side, even on positive news, really positive news like that. They were like death and un-American, un-American.
[36:13.000 --> 36:21.000]  Somebody said treasonous. I mean, yeah, I guess why not? Can we call that treason? Why not?
[36:21.000 --> 36:32.000]  I mean, they certainly didn't love our country very much, but you look at that and it's really very, very sad.
[36:32.000 --> 36:41.000]  So we have to keep it going because this country is turning and it's turning much faster. And I said I'm going to do it, but it's happening faster than I thought.
[36:41.000 --> 36:51.000]  And they are really, really angry and I can feel their anger that they don't have this country in a total stranglehold anymore.
[36:51.000 --> 36:59.000]  Speaking of stranglehold, before I get into the latest FBI fiasco, we'll get into the Dow Jones. It's up 200 points today.
[36:59.000 --> 37:12.000]  The Democrats are trying to force a vote on the Dreamers. They want total capitulation, completely wide open borders, the State Department under the control of the United Nations as it already was until Obama got out of office.
[37:12.000 --> 37:26.000]  They want that system set back up. They want to basically have the U.S. under the U.N.'s refugee control system where it was dictating the State Department who was let in and it was vetting who could be let in,
[37:26.000 --> 37:38.000]  including people on Interpol terror watch list. Because remember, in Sweden, in Germany, in France, in Belgium, in the Netherlands, but particularly in the United Kingdom, it's been back on the news this week,
[37:38.000 --> 37:58.000]  they are bringing in hundreds, it was 400, just last month, the British News was reporting, 400 plus former jihad fighters who'd invaded Syria and they're now coming back into England because they either previously lived there
[37:58.000 --> 38:08.000]  or are being allowed in, even though they are admitted ISIS members and they're bringing in free housing and welfare and all these goodies, Paul Watson covered this yesterday,
[38:08.000 --> 38:23.000]  and pensioners are being thrown out of their government housing and being told to move in with their children to make room and they are doing all sorts of other horrible things.
[38:23.000 --> 38:35.000]  And of course, that's a whole other report on 400 British ISIS jihadists returning. There's a whole other article about 400 plus just completely unvetted, many of which are ISIS fighters.
[38:35.000 --> 38:45.000]  That's a whole separate headline they found. Wow, just so many, I can't even keep track of it anymore. So it just shows the total commitment to destroy the West and make it unlivable.
[38:45.000 --> 38:55.000]  So speaking of tyranny and speaking of treason, aren't you glad you don't live under the unelected European Union that no one knows how it just appeared?
[38:55.000 --> 39:03.000]  Well, actually we do, but the general public doesn't in the UK or Europe, they're learning about it thanks to independence parties that are taking over.
[39:03.000 --> 39:15.000]  In 1947, they had the Treaty of London that agreed to steal concessions and for a treaty on basically rebuilding Europe's steel industry and that would have the governments work together.
[39:15.000 --> 39:26.000]  Off of that body, they began to transfer power to it so that when politicians left or lost office, they had been good traders to France or Germany or England.
[39:26.000 --> 39:34.000]  They would then get a position on those corporate boards that were paid for by the big robber barons.
[39:34.000 --> 39:46.000]  And so from 47 with the Treaty of London, then in 56, they had the Treaty of Rome that really created the European Union, the European Economic Community.
[39:46.000 --> 39:58.000]  And then in 2000, they just suddenly announced, we're the EU, yay, and fireworks and the countries, none of them voted to enter it.
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  And so they finally went, well, then let's vote to get out.
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  That was the Brexit and they're still trying to get the face sucker off.
[40:06.000 --> 40:16.000]  But isn't that illustrative of how did Junker, the grandson of the head Nazis, how his dad was a top Nazi?
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  How is Junker suddenly running everything?
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  Well, because he's a top Nazi and that's what they do.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  They run things just like Soros.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  They're like, man, you killed thousands of your fellow Jews.
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  You're a good guy.
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  We're going to hire you to help run the New World Order.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  He's like Hail Hydra.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  This is never about Hitler.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  It's all about power and pure evil.
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  Oh, yeah.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  Oh, yeah.
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  Bezos is the richest guy in the world.
[40:41.000 --> 40:45.000]  No, Junker and people like him, no one knows.
[40:45.000 --> 40:50.000]  Okay, but Junker owns Luxembourg, the richest country per capita in the world.
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  The most elite tax haven on the planet.
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.000]  Junker owns it.
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.000]  Why?
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  Because his grandfather had Baradriper jumping and taking over.
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.000]  So that's why he told Trump,
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.000]  we will defeat you a year ago.
[41:07.000 --> 41:08.000]  Well, guess what?
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  You got your ass handed to you, smiley face.
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.000]  That big old buzzard knows you got sticking in our business.
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  So here's a new article on newswars.com from them,
[41:17.000 --> 41:21.000]  that secret EU army we first reported on 10 years ago.
[41:21.000 --> 41:24.000]  They've made it public last year and now they're announcing,
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.000]  if you try to leave, we'll roll in.
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  EU threatens force against countries refusing migrants.
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.000]  That's right.
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  If you don't let the Muslim invaders come in,
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.000]  80 plus percent military aged men will use force.
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  They already are threatening a million to 100,000,
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  100,000 to a million euro fine.
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.000]  If you don't accept military aged men into your country,
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  who all seem to have their own Facebook accounts bragging about
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.000]  how many people they killed, sometimes posing with dead bodies
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.000]  or women they've captured, who they're selling into slavery.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  Oh, yeah, they let you sit in the news.
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.000]  Oh, you actually sold women to sex slavery and you're on tape
[42:06.000 --> 42:07.000]  executing people?
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.000]  Baby, we want you.
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  And what's the Green Party say?
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.000]  They came out and they told the women in Cologne,
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  a bunch of them got raped, the mayor who's the Green Party
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  ahead in that state, by the way, not just mayor,
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  she said, don't wear short dresses, sweetheart.
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  She said, don't wear short dresses and go around together in groups
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  or wear rape bracelets.
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  But more on the article, European globalists are preparing
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  to force central European nations to accept mandated migrant quotas
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  and open borders according to Hungarian prime minister.
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  And then it goes on from there that he has been notified
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  that they will just take control of his borders,
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  which they've been saying they'll do.
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  They've been threatening Italy.
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  If Italy stops the Zodiac boats that George Soros funds publicly,
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  bringing in thousands every few days into Italy,
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  they said, we'll stop your ships.
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.000]  Crooked Hillary is at it again, gaslighting the population.
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.000]  She says Trump is using the FISA memo as a scapegoat
[43:07.000 --> 43:08.000]  for the Russia probe.
[43:08.000 --> 43:11.000]  Speaking to students at Georgetown University,
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.000]  Clinton said her loss is attributed to misogyny and sexism,
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.000]  but another contributing factor was the outgrowth
[43:17.000 --> 43:20.000]  of all the anxiety and insecurity playing on some people
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  and leading them on a hunt for scapegoats.
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  But thanks to those damning text messages
[43:24.000 --> 43:27.000]  between two anti-Trump FBI investigators,
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  we know the Russia investigation was meant to be Clinton's
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  scapegoat for losing the 2016 election.
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.000]  Peter Struck and his mistress Lisa Page outlined
[43:36.000 --> 43:40.000]  an insurance policy to derail Trump should he win the election.
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.000]  FBI officials like Struck and former deputy director Andrew McCabe
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  were quarterbacking the investigation
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  into Clinton's illegal server.
[43:48.000 --> 43:52.000]  The FISA memo itself details evidence of the Clinton campaign,
[43:52.000 --> 43:55.000]  including with the FBI, DOJ, and the State Department.
[43:55.000 --> 43:58.000]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo, Infowars.com.
[44:01.000 --> 44:04.000]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.000]  in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation,
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.000]  let me speak for hours just on the files I have here,
[44:11.000 --> 44:14.000]  of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this,
[44:14.000 --> 44:19.000]  this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year,
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  anytime of the year, but immune wall is incredible and folks.
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.000]  Other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  It's a great deal at $39.
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.000]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf, and so much more.
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.000]  It is concentrated, you need to go read what is in here.
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  that just incredibly accelerate.
[44:41.000 --> 44:44.000]  A citrus peel blend, I mean, this is the next level.
[44:44.000 --> 44:47.000]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, immune wall.
[44:47.000 --> 44:50.000]  I think it's beyond seasonal, beta-glucan, olive leaf,
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.000]  and more, immune wall, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com,

[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:59.000]  Thank you.
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:21.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  Welcome back.
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  I have other sources that are in similar walks of life in other areas.
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  I have a question for you.
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:48:01.000]  It's very pragmatic as well.
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:30.000]  I have a question for you.
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:45.000]  You see the bigger globalist plan, it's just chaos for everybody.
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:49:12.000]  I have a question for you.
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  I have a question for you.

[02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:56.000]  I have a question for you.
[02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:25.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:54.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:01:23.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:51.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:44.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:03:10.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:39.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:04:07.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:34.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:04:34.000 --> 03:05:03.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:32.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:55.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:27.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:54.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:06:54.000 --> 03:07:21.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:48.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:07:48.000 --> 03:08:17.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:47.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:09:15.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:41.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:10:08.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:11:05.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:31.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:58.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:23.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:50.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:13:17.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:42.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:13:42.000 --> 03:14:09.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:36.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:14:36.000 --> 03:15:03.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:32.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:53.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:16:22.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:52.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:17:20.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:46.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:17:46.000 --> 03:18:15.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:44.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:18:44.000 --> 03:19:12.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:39.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:20:06.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:35.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:20:35.000 --> 03:21:02.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:21:02.000 --> 03:21:29.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:56.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:21:56.000 --> 03:22:23.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:51.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:22:51.000 --> 03:23:20.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:23:21.000 --> 03:23:50.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:23:51.000 --> 03:24:20.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:50.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:24:51.000 --> 03:25:20.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:48.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:25:48.000 --> 03:26:15.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:42.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:27:09.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:36.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:27:36.000 --> 03:28:03.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:32.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:28:33.000 --> 03:29:00.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:29:00.000 --> 03:29:23.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:52.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:29:53.000 --> 03:30:20.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:30:20.000 --> 03:30:48.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:30:48.000 --> 03:31:15.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:31:15.000 --> 03:31:42.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:31:42.000 --> 03:32:09.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:32:09.000 --> 03:32:36.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:32:36.000 --> 03:33:05.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:33:05.000 --> 03:33:33.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:33:33.000 --> 03:34:02.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:30.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:56.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:34:56.000 --> 03:35:25.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:35:26.000 --> 03:35:53.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:35:53.000 --> 03:36:21.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:50.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:36:50.000 --> 03:37:17.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:37:17.000 --> 03:37:43.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:37:43.000 --> 03:38:06.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:33.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:38:33.000 --> 03:39:02.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:39:02.000 --> 03:39:29.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:50.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:40:17.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:44.000]  I have a question for you.
[03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:49.000]  If you are trying to recruit the British Army, then where is the recruitment for us?
[03:40:49.000 --> 03:40:55.000]  Where is the recruitment for normal young men, full of testosterone, who want to go in the army to fight?
[03:40:55.000 --> 03:40:57.000]  They want to go in to be the best.
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:41:04.000]  The British Army are trying to get rid of the slogan, be the best, because it is too elicited.
[03:41:04.000 --> 03:41:05.000]  They want to get rid of it.
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:12.000]  If you compare this, I will ask any of you viewers to go on the Chinese Army recruitment video.
[03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:15.000]  Go on Russia's recruitment video.
[03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:23.000]  It is men with six pats, with face paint on them, shooting people in the head, firing rockets, driving tanks.
[03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:25.000]  It is adrenaline packed.
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:28.000]  It is young men who are going to go out and fight.
[03:41:28.000 --> 03:41:33.000]  These men are supposed to go out and get bullets fired at them and die.
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:35.000]  This is the Chinese one.
[03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:37.000]  These men are going to do.
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:39.000]  We want them to have a corner to cry in.
[03:41:39.000 --> 03:41:42.000]  We want them to have someone to talk to if they are gay.
[03:41:42.000 --> 03:41:44.000]  That is the reality of it.
[03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:46.000]  It is an embarrassment to our army.
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:49.000]  Then I ask the motives of why they are doing this.
[03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:53.000]  I am aware that the British Army, I believe, want to lose another 10,000 people.
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:58.000]  Through this campaign that they have launched, people are dropping out every day.
[03:41:58.000 --> 03:42:00.000]  Maybe that is why they have done it.
[03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:03.000]  It is a complete embarrassment to our British military.
[03:42:03.000 --> 03:42:08.000]  So many people serving for it are so angered and frustrated.
[03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:10.000]  This is, do I have to be a superhero?
[03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:13.000]  This is actually one that shows the man crying in a little while.
[03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:18.000]  When you compare it to what they want our military to be like in the future,
[03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:22.000]  they basically want transgender Muslims leading our military.
[03:42:22.000 --> 03:42:24.000]  It is an embarrassment.
[03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:26.000]  It is an embarrassment to our country.
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:30.000]  To be honest, the people who are going to join the army come from the same background I come from.
[03:42:30.000 --> 03:42:35.000]  They should be going into the poorest schools and the most underperforming schools in the UK
[03:42:35.000 --> 03:42:39.000]  and make men out of those children.
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:41.000]  Give them a real career and opportunity.
[03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:43.000]  Not focusing on gay people.
[03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:45.000]  Focus on all these minorities where they don't need to.
[03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:47.000]  Focus on everyone from every background.
[03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:55.000]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:42:55.000 --> 03:42:56.000]  Go ahead.
[03:42:56.000 --> 03:42:58.000]  I just have to say something, man.
[03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:01.000]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:43:01.000 --> 03:43:03.000]  It just gets old, man.
[03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:05.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:08.000]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:12.000]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:15.000]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:18.000]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:20.000]  What's it going to take us being shut down?
[03:43:20.000 --> 03:43:22.000]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:43:22.000 --> 03:43:23.000]  You know what?
[03:43:23.000 --> 03:43:24.000]  I'll put it on pause again.
[03:43:24.000 --> 03:43:29.000]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear?
[03:43:29.000 --> 03:43:30.000]  We're under attack.
[03:43:30.000 --> 03:43:31.000]  We need your help.
[03:43:31.000 --> 03:43:36.000]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:43:36.000 --> 03:43:39.000]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:43:39.000 --> 03:43:40.000]  Do you understand?
[03:43:40.000 --> 03:43:41.000]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:43.000]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:49.000]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the info.
[03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:50.000]  Do you understand?
[03:43:50.000 --> 03:43:51.000]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:53.000]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[03:43:53.000 --> 03:43:58.000]  You know, I've got some talking points here about caveman from infowarstlife.com.
[03:43:58.000 --> 03:44:01.000]  But instead of going with those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced
[03:44:01.000 --> 03:44:02.000]  personally.
[03:44:02.000 --> 03:44:06.000]  From all the wives, tales, and every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:44:06.000 --> 03:44:09.000]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:14.000]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:44:14.000 --> 03:44:20.000]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and
[03:44:20.000 --> 03:44:27.000]  the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and
[03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:36.000]  your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:44:36.000 --> 03:44:43.000]  is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:47.000]  What do you do for your family?

[03:46:53.000 --> 03:47:22.000]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:27.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:40.000]  Hi, my name is Tommy Robinson and I'm hosting The Alex Jones Show with Millie Weaver.
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:44.000]  I'm in Luton Town, which is a town in Great Britain.
[03:47:44.000 --> 03:47:48.000]  Whilst I was just talking about Muslims joining the British Army,
[03:47:48.000 --> 03:47:53.000]  I want to take this opportunity to tell you a story about a certain Muslim
[03:47:53.000 --> 03:47:59.000]  who was a captain in the British Armed Forces who went to Sandhurst Military School.
[03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:03.000]  He was put up on a pedestal in our country.
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:07.000]  He was friends with David Cameron at the time who was our Prime Minister.
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:12.000]  He was asked by David Cameron what seat he wants on the cabinet
[03:48:12.000 --> 03:48:16.000]  and he made an approach to me.
[03:48:16.000 --> 03:48:22.000]  When you all know of Sadiq Khan, who is our Muslim MP, who is our Muslim Mayor,
[03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:27.000]  and I have a problem trusting people who are getting in these positions.
[03:48:27.000 --> 03:48:31.000]  I have a problem because of what's happened in the past.
[03:48:31.000 --> 03:48:36.000]  Afsal Amin approached me when I was lead in the English Defence League.
[03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:39.000]  He approached me and offered me a financial agreement.
[03:48:39.000 --> 03:48:42.000]  He offered me cash. He offered me money.
[03:48:42.000 --> 03:48:45.000]  He offered me money that I would never have to worry about my finances again.
[03:48:45.000 --> 03:48:50.000]  I will explain in a minute what he wanted me to do.
[03:48:50.000 --> 03:48:58.000]  The reason he has done this is because Muslims and Islam have bought its way through my country.
[03:48:58.000 --> 03:49:02.000]  It has bought our politicians. It has bought our police leaders.
[03:49:02.000 --> 03:49:05.000]  It is trying to buy our people.
[03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:11.000]  When I led the movement, I said you may buy our politicians, you will never buy us.
[03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:17.000]  There is nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer and we love our country and we won't sell it out.
[03:49:17.000 --> 03:49:22.000]  Afsal Amin approached me and he asked me to do...
[03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:26.000]  He asked if he paid me if I would set up a demonstration in his constituency.
[03:49:26.000 --> 03:49:33.000]  If he steps in, if I would sit with him and cancel the demonstration because I respect him,
[03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:37.000]  because he served for 10 years as a captain in the British Army.
[03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:41.000]  If we have a video here, I will show you the news expose.
[03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:46.000]  This was the biggest news story in my country, weeks before the election.
[03:49:46.000 --> 03:49:50.000]  I never got thanked for this, but if you watch the news story,
[03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:54.000]  it will give you a brief minute of it which will explain what happened.
[03:49:54.000 --> 03:49:58.000]  He seemed to be the Conservative's dream candidate,
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:04.000]  a Muslim British Army officer for 11 years who had done tours of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:09.000]  This was Afsal Amin speaking out against extremism after the murder of Lee Rigby.
[03:50:09.000 --> 03:50:15.000]  We won't give in to this extremist narrative, whether it comes from one element or another.
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:21.000]  Contrast that to the man apparently filmed seemingly making Machiavellian deals
[03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:24.000]  with the far-right English Defence League.
[03:50:24.000 --> 03:50:28.000]  If you were to announce the second march, say early May, that you're going to come back,
[03:50:28.000 --> 03:50:31.000]  do another march about the mosque, about the planning commission's work.
[03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:34.000]  He wanted the EDL to fake a march,
[03:50:34.000 --> 03:50:38.000]  only for him to then pretend he had heroically negotiated its cancellation.
[03:50:38.000 --> 03:50:44.000]  In exchange, the EDL were offered the chance to mainstream their views once he's elected.
[03:50:44.000 --> 03:50:50.000]  If I win my election, in Parliament you've got a very strong, unshakeable ally.
[03:50:50.000 --> 03:50:53.000]  When I'm being offered this, it's not for sale.
[03:50:53.000 --> 03:50:56.000]  My integrity is not for sale. The English Defence League is not for sale.
[03:50:56.000 --> 03:51:00.000]  For a number of years, Dudley has been the site of bitter dispute and tension.
[03:51:00.000 --> 03:51:03.000]  I'll explain the rest.
[03:51:03.000 --> 03:51:06.000]  So, what happened after this?
[03:51:06.000 --> 03:51:09.000]  Once I exposed him, I wore hidden cameras.
[03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:15.000]  I went to a meeting with a man who told me in the meeting he's not looking at being an MP,
[03:51:15.000 --> 03:51:19.000]  he's not happy with that, he's looking at number 10.
[03:51:19.000 --> 03:51:22.000]  He was a captain in the British Army for 10 years.
[03:51:22.000 --> 03:51:26.000]  He had support coming from Qatar when he gets into the Dudley area.
[03:51:26.000 --> 03:51:30.000]  Qatar were going to pump tens of millions of pounds into that area
[03:51:30.000 --> 03:51:34.000]  to solve the jobless problems, to build the community.
[03:51:34.000 --> 03:51:38.000]  So, when he's looked upon again, he would have solved all of Dudley's problems
[03:51:38.000 --> 03:51:41.000]  with the help of Qatar, of course.
[03:51:41.000 --> 03:51:45.000]  And when I exposed him, I exposed him and I went to a meeting with him.
[03:51:45.000 --> 03:51:49.000]  When I went to a meeting with him, he turned up with his two financial backers.
[03:51:49.000 --> 03:51:52.000]  And they were both Muslim gangsters.
[03:51:52.000 --> 03:51:56.000]  They sat down, they talked about one of their friends was shot dead.
[03:51:56.000 --> 03:51:59.000]  And then when I said, who are you conservatives?
[03:51:59.000 --> 03:52:00.000]  Because it's the same.
[03:52:00.000 --> 03:52:03.000]  So, Afsal Amin was standing for the Republicans.
[03:52:03.000 --> 03:52:07.000]  And these two men, when I was sitting talking to them, they were followers of the Democrats.
[03:52:07.000 --> 03:52:08.000]  They were the opposite party.
[03:52:08.000 --> 03:52:14.000]  So, I said, if you support the Democrats, why are you funding him to get into the conservatives?
[03:52:14.000 --> 03:52:16.000]  To get into the conservatives.
[03:52:16.000 --> 03:52:19.000]  And they said, because once we have our man in Parliament,
[03:52:19.000 --> 03:52:23.000]  then if there's any problems, he can sort them out.
[03:52:23.000 --> 03:52:25.000]  Problems with the police.
[03:52:25.000 --> 03:52:27.000]  These men actually owned hotels.
[03:52:27.000 --> 03:52:32.000]  Their hotel's been targeted by the police because young girls being groomed and raped.
[03:52:32.000 --> 03:52:35.000]  This is when I started realizing just how dirty our politics are.
[03:52:35.000 --> 03:52:37.000]  It was these men that offered me money.
[03:52:37.000 --> 03:52:44.000]  And then when I exposed it, then the media went into overdrive, looking into Afsal Amin.
[03:52:44.000 --> 03:52:46.000]  What did they find?
[03:52:46.000 --> 03:52:51.000]  They found that a year before he joined the British army, before he become a captain,
[03:52:51.000 --> 03:52:57.000]  he had wrote leaflets and distributed them, saying that the Mujahideen, the Islamic fighters,
[03:52:57.000 --> 03:53:00.000]  will keep in their enclaves in Britain.
[03:53:00.000 --> 03:53:04.000]  And then when the war comes, they'll come out and they'll attack the kafar.
[03:53:04.000 --> 03:53:05.000]  This is his words.
[03:53:05.000 --> 03:53:08.000]  He was a radical extremist Muslim.
[03:53:08.000 --> 03:53:10.000]  And he infiltrated our army.
[03:53:10.000 --> 03:53:12.000]  He spent 10 years as a captain.
[03:53:12.000 --> 03:53:16.000]  And he nearly had a seat on our cabinet in our government.
[03:53:16.000 --> 03:53:19.000]  And maybe one day would have been the leader of our government.
[03:53:19.000 --> 03:53:21.000]  And no one battered and oiled it.
[03:53:21.000 --> 03:53:24.000]  They all wanted their picture taken with him.
[03:53:24.000 --> 03:53:28.000]  In fact, what Afsal Amin told me, which is all on tape recording,
[03:53:28.000 --> 03:53:33.000]  he told me that when David Cameron walked into the hall, everyone was trying to say hello to him.
[03:53:33.000 --> 03:53:36.000]  At that time, David Cameron was our prime minister.
[03:53:36.000 --> 03:53:38.000]  Everyone was trying to say hello to him.
[03:53:38.000 --> 03:53:43.000]  He ignored the moon and went straight up to Afsal and said, hello, Afsal,
[03:53:43.000 --> 03:53:45.000]  because Afsal is a Muslim.
[03:53:45.000 --> 03:53:50.000]  And he wanted that Muslim in his parliament, in his team, because they needed one.
[03:53:50.000 --> 03:53:55.000]  And at that time, then, there was no thank you to us
[03:53:55.000 --> 03:54:00.000]  for exposing an undercover operative for a foreign entity within our government.
[03:54:00.000 --> 03:54:05.000]  I'm fully aware of many people who have infiltrated the American government,
[03:54:05.000 --> 03:54:08.000]  especially the last Barack Obama's government.
[03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:13.000]  But we have currently the same situation as happened now in our capital city.
[03:54:13.000 --> 03:54:18.000]  We had it with the mayor of Tower Hamlets, who was a radical extremist,
[03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:22.000]  who got into a position where he was in charge of a billion pound of our budget,
[03:54:22.000 --> 03:54:23.000]  because he was voted in.
[03:54:23.000 --> 03:54:25.000]  This is how our politics is working.
[03:54:25.000 --> 03:54:28.000]  This is how your American politics will change.
[03:54:28.000 --> 03:54:29.000]  They become Muslim.
[03:54:29.000 --> 03:54:33.000]  The Islamic community becomes so powerful with their block voting,
[03:54:33.000 --> 03:54:36.000]  because they're all hardened in certain areas.
[03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:40.000]  We have another extremist group in the UK called MEND.
[03:54:40.000 --> 03:54:47.000]  Their leader of MEND is on record as saying we will use democracy only to implement Sharia.
[03:54:47.000 --> 03:54:53.000]  He's on record as saying that British military are legitimate targets.
[03:54:53.000 --> 03:54:56.000]  He's on record as saying many extremist things.
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:00.000]  Jeremy Corbyn, who is the leader of the opposition in the UK,
[03:55:00.000 --> 03:55:03.000]  shared a stage with this man a number of months ago.
[03:55:03.000 --> 03:55:07.000]  In the transcripts I got from a mosque in Greater Manchester,
[03:55:07.000 --> 03:55:11.000]  one of MEND's leading representatives told the congregation,
[03:55:11.000 --> 03:55:14.000]  all political groups will work with us.
[03:55:14.000 --> 03:55:19.000]  We can now sway 30 seats in politics, 30 seats.
[03:55:19.000 --> 03:55:21.000]  So it doesn't matter how extreme they are.
[03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:23.000]  It doesn't matter how radical they are.
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:25.000]  They will gain them power.
[03:55:25.000 --> 03:55:26.000]  That is what they did.
[03:55:26.000 --> 03:55:28.000]  We had an election.
[03:55:28.000 --> 03:55:31.000]  Jeremy Corbyn gained 30 seats.
[03:55:31.000 --> 03:55:37.000]  The Labour Party in the UK have become the most anti-semitic, anti-freedom party there is.
[03:55:37.000 --> 03:55:40.000]  And they side every time with the Islamic community.
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:43.000]  And for another example of why that is,
[03:55:43.000 --> 03:55:49.000]  in my hometown of Luton, the projected growth forecast by the year 2030,
[03:55:49.000 --> 03:55:53.000]  these are government statistics, they're not Tommy Robinson statistics,
[03:55:53.000 --> 03:55:58.000]  the Islamic community, the Bangladeshi and Pakistani community,
[03:55:58.000 --> 03:56:03.000]  are going to increase by 70% to 77%.
[03:56:03.000 --> 03:56:08.000]  The black and white community will increase by 1.2% to 1.4%.
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:10.000]  So Labour understands fully,
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:14.000]  due to the birth rate and the demographical change of this great nation,
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:16.000]  that Islam is the future.
[03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:19.000]  And that's why we're being sold out left, right and centre
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:21.000]  from one end of this country to the other.
[03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:25.000]  Americans really need to understand just how quickly that happens.
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:29.000]  I've watched in my hometown where one area you can be in
[03:56:29.000 --> 03:56:31.000]  and you look at it a few years later and you think,
[03:56:31.000 --> 03:56:32.000]  what has happened here?
[03:56:32.000 --> 03:56:34.000]  It's that quick.
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:39.000]  With a growth, with a birth rate of 5.6 children,
[03:56:39.000 --> 03:56:42.000]  that's on average in the UK, the Muslim community,
[03:56:42.000 --> 03:56:44.000]  1.3 children we have on average.
[03:56:44.000 --> 03:56:47.000]  I ask every year, mum and Muslim, I meet, how many children do you have?
[03:56:47.000 --> 03:56:51.000]  My local imam has 14 children with three wives.
[03:56:51.000 --> 03:56:54.000]  That's what's happening and it's happening like that.
[03:56:54.000 --> 03:56:56.000]  So as a warning to America, unless you address,
[03:56:56.000 --> 03:56:59.000]  there's things we can do to address this, but we don't.
[03:56:59.000 --> 03:57:03.000]  We could limit the benefit system to two children,
[03:57:03.000 --> 03:57:06.000]  because at the minute, we're paying for this, which is insane.
[03:57:06.000 --> 03:57:09.000]  We're all working very hard, paying lots of tax,
[03:57:09.000 --> 03:57:12.000]  so they can have lots of babies, so that they can change the culture
[03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:16.000]  and the way our country looks and the future of our nation.
[03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:19.000]  Run over, we're going into a commercial now,
[03:57:19.000 --> 03:57:22.000]  and we'll get back afterwards, on the fake mainstream media.
[03:57:22.000 --> 03:57:24.000]  Let's go.
[03:57:52.000 --> 03:57:55.000]  I'm out with the largest spectrum of high quality,
[03:57:55.000 --> 03:57:59.000]  known probiotics that have been proven
[03:57:59.000 --> 03:58:05.000]  to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
