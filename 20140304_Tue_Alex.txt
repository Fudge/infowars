[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:36.160]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well we've got some good news
[00:36.160 --> 00:43.440]  out of the gates right now Vladimir Putin has come out and said no immediate need to invade
[00:43.440 --> 00:50.400]  eastern Ukraine leaves threat dangling though they've taken over the Crimea and of course our
[00:50.400 --> 00:57.760]  media has already said for two days that Russia has completely invaded the Ukraine itself Reuters
[00:57.760 --> 01:03.760]  and AP ram of those headlines that we covered on the Sunday transmission David Knight did a great
[01:03.760 --> 01:11.360]  job covering the show yesterday I'm not really taking a spring break off with my family but I am
[01:11.360 --> 01:19.360]  going to be taking a few days off next week probably and or maybe Friday so you'll have live
[01:19.360 --> 01:23.360]  transmissions here though with David Knight and the rest of the crew if I do take some take some
[01:23.360 --> 01:28.080]  time off quite frankly end up taking a time off from radio just to get other things done with the
[01:28.080 --> 01:33.120]  operation the bunch of stuff we're getting ready to launch and then to try to spend a little more
[01:33.120 --> 01:39.200]  time with the family obviously and other family issues that have been going on outside of my
[01:39.200 --> 01:44.240]  immediate family so that's why I wasn't here yesterday but I am here today ladies and gentlemen
[01:45.040 --> 01:51.440]  in studio and we are going to be on air for the next three hours and I do intend to cover a
[01:51.440 --> 02:00.800]  smattering of the top stories obviously but we are also going to be taking a lot of your phone calls
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.760]  here on the broadcast as well and getting into just for the good the bad and the ugly of the news
[02:07.760 --> 02:14.160]  we've also got incredible stories out of San Antonio and other areas of the country where people
[02:14.160 --> 02:22.160]  filming the police at 100 200 yards away are being arrested for interfering with police and
[02:22.160 --> 02:26.880]  it's just an unprecedented attack on the first amendment we've got some of that video and audio
[02:27.760 --> 02:32.240]  coming up today and the interesting articles like this one scientists can now control flies
[02:32.240 --> 02:39.440]  brains with lasers flickering lights not just in insects but in mammals and higher order mammals
[02:39.440 --> 02:46.160]  like humans that's why you had pokemon 15 years ago causing seizures in the u.s in japan sometimes
[02:46.160 --> 02:50.720]  over 10 000 kids a pop when it would air a new episode would flop around on the ground that's
[02:50.720 --> 02:56.240]  an example of just what flickering lights can do low tech type technology
[02:56.240 --> 03:06.480]  so this is the type of issue that we're dealing with and i'm trying to get the public to think
[03:06.480 --> 03:11.280]  about because now they're going into data over power lines interfacing with regular
[03:12.720 --> 03:23.600]  light bulbs and then using a sub conscious detectable flicker rate to communicate with
[03:23.600 --> 03:28.640]  your computer so that's a way to jack into your house and control things the new computers are
[03:28.640 --> 03:32.720]  coming out to interface with these whether you like it or not but then the studies show it as a
[03:32.720 --> 03:38.880]  second trojan horse use of actually manipulating the human brain and i talk about this stuff and
[03:38.880 --> 03:46.080]  people laugh about it this is mainstream news this is not my opinion that that's what's so
[03:46.080 --> 03:52.320]  frustrating is that we are living in the buck roger age but the general public thinks we're in
[03:52.320 --> 04:00.640]  1950 and doesn't understand that they don't just remote control roaches and flies with lasers
[04:00.640 --> 04:06.400]  they can put microchips in their brains and use them like remote controls you can do that with
[04:06.400 --> 04:10.880]  a human as well and now we got threatened to be sued and we said go ahead and sue us they backed
[04:10.880 --> 04:17.920]  off three years ago when we ran a story about uh microchips to be in all the new controlled
[04:17.920 --> 04:24.800]  substance schedule drugs painkillers you name it now they're coming out with them and it's
[04:24.800 --> 04:29.280]  actually happening and it reports back to your doctor when you took it and what you did but
[04:29.280 --> 04:32.480]  they didn't want the public knowing about that at the time so they said we're going to sue you
[04:33.600 --> 04:37.600]  if you don't take your article down about this we said go ahead this is your admitting patent
[04:37.600 --> 04:42.320]  you're doing it but see they didn't want it known then to have a pre-debate they wanted to roll it
[04:42.320 --> 04:46.640]  out the way they wanted to sell the slaves on it and now they're doing that i mean it that's just
[04:46.640 --> 04:52.400]  one more example of thousands it's a total insane trojan horse takeover we're going to discuss it

[10:41.280 --> 10:49.680]  shaken by tea party influence across the nation blue blood republicans are being removed from
[10:49.680 --> 10:56.720]  office are being devastated despite the fact that they have massive massive funding sure somebody
[10:56.720 --> 11:02.400]  like john cornan can probably still stay in using their incumbent power but many others are falling
[11:02.960 --> 11:09.440]  texas went to the polls today in primary elections where top candidates for governor were expected

[11:21.840 --> 11:27.520]  opinion polls show attorney general greg abbott the leading republican candidate for governor
[11:27.520 --> 11:33.040]  and state senator wendy davis the top democratic party candidate were also expected to win by wide

[11:50.000 --> 11:54.880]  republicans dominate the state house and have not lost a statewide election since 94
[11:54.880 --> 11:58.960]  u.s senator ted cruz has emerged as one of the leaders of the texas republicans
[12:00.160 --> 12:05.360]  pushing politics in the already conservative state even further the right how about towards
[12:05.360 --> 12:09.920]  the constitution analyst said he's the favorite of the tea party movement which is considered
[12:09.920 --> 12:15.120]  both conservative libertarian and also populist and advocating for smaller government and tax cuts
[12:16.320 --> 12:20.880]  sounds like maryland than rose dimensions to me politically smaller government tax cuts
[12:21.440 --> 12:27.280]  spells massive growth in economy massive prosperity massive money in your bank account
[12:27.280 --> 12:32.800]  with you deciding how to spend it which equals freedom and voting with dollars and i just love
[12:32.800 --> 12:38.560]  it love it love it and spells an end to the cloward and piven bankrupt the country make us all dependent
[12:38.560 --> 12:45.280]  on government cheese no thank you i don't want it and it goes on in the article to admit that tea
[12:45.280 --> 12:51.440]  party people are winning many of the primary races are lined up to do that so that's very exciting
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.120]  news when you've got the republican elite and the democratic elite all lined up against the tea
[12:57.120 --> 13:04.240]  party you know where to go not saying they're panacea not saying it's perfect not saying that it's
[13:04.240 --> 13:08.640]  the answer to all our problems but it's the best thing there is out there and scares the system
[13:08.640 --> 13:14.400]  to its core because it's pro gun pro family pro sovereignty pro states rights and if the idea of
[13:14.400 --> 13:21.120]  private property and guns and making your own choices and running your own life ever infects in
[13:21.120 --> 13:26.960]  the democratic party mind the quote minorities that are really the majority in this country now
[13:26.960 --> 13:30.880]  it's game over for the new world order if we ever stop identifying on race
[13:31.600 --> 13:37.600]  like martin with the king said and start identifying on ideas it's game over ladies and
[13:37.600 --> 13:42.240]  gentlemen for the establishment now i'm going to get in to the huge developments of the stock
[13:42.240 --> 13:49.040]  market huge developments uh in russia some good developments in ukraine with putin at least for
[13:49.040 --> 13:58.000]  now this may be a fint though it may be uh i guess a juke as they call it he may be zinging to the
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.880]  left when he's really about to go to the right it may be a foil maybe a gambit but he's saying no
[14:04.880 --> 14:11.120]  immediate need to invade eastern ukraine leaves threat dangling just i'm not a rocket scientist
[14:11.120 --> 14:15.120]  folks but you know i told you two weeks ago or a week and a half ago whenever here's morgan on sunday
[14:15.120 --> 14:20.560]  it came out was going to be basically stepping down from his failed prime time larry king slotted
[14:20.560 --> 14:25.920]  for three years i said watch you'll do a monthly magazine show with top celebrities that wasn't
[14:25.920 --> 14:32.080]  out a few days ago i'm not bragging that's the standard deal they don't want to admit they failed
[14:32.080 --> 14:37.840]  trying to have a snot nose know it all elitist from a foreign country tell us how horrible we are
[14:37.840 --> 14:42.960]  that were read next come all day if we believe in any basic freedom that wasn't a hard prediction it
[14:42.960 --> 14:49.120]  happened and it wasn't a hard prediction that putin would take over the crummy with the gas pipelines
[14:49.120 --> 14:54.800]  in their only deep water port in that area where it's 70 plus percent russian and almost everybody
[14:54.800 --> 14:59.760]  else is pro russian in the area and it's been part of russian different parts of history and that
[14:59.760 --> 15:06.160]  then if the ukranians were stupid enough to attack the russians that they would then respond and take
[15:06.160 --> 15:14.880]  half the country up to the border of the river and the capital of ukraine kief that's standard
[15:14.880 --> 15:21.200]  military procedure and if they were dumb enough as i said sunday to respond to it as nato was talking
[15:21.200 --> 15:28.720]  about and front headlines of quote putin invades all of ukraine and is taking the country then he
[15:28.720 --> 15:33.600]  would have the moral high ground to try to roll in and take half the country and if they continue
[15:33.600 --> 15:40.960]  to try to have unrest and destabilize it putin will take half the country and i'm not again
[15:40.960 --> 15:49.200]  lionizing i'm not uh romanticizing vietnam or putin but they're not the ones with george soros
[15:49.760 --> 15:54.400]  quarterbacking the operation with the state department that started this whole faux revolution
[15:54.400 --> 15:59.440]  there's real beefs there there's real historical ethnic and religious differences and you know maybe
[15:59.440 --> 16:04.320]  ukraine needs to be broken into i i don't know the point is it's not like it's being broken into
[16:04.320 --> 16:09.200]  to create some new independent country that would be like switzerland i'd love it they got great land
[16:09.200 --> 16:14.000]  great culture a great history be like switzerland be independent you'll be switzerland in 50 years
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.680]  you're not going to do that you're going to be absorbed by something even worse than the russian
[16:19.680 --> 16:30.080]  confederation you're going to be absorbed now by the eu i mean talk about a bad situation talk about
[16:30.080 --> 16:35.920]  a bad deal talk about somewhere that we don't want to go
[16:40.720 --> 16:41.200]  anybody
[16:43.840 --> 16:48.320]  no one wants to be part of the eu and i say we don't want to go there england never got a vote
[16:48.320 --> 16:53.680]  and 80 some percent of their laws are made by the eu the us has now done treaties under bush and
[16:53.680 --> 16:58.800]  obama to let the eu decide a lot of stuff that's going on the transatlantic partnership it's called
[16:58.800 --> 17:03.760]  none of this want to be part of the eu it's like the thing it's just it's it's the core of the new
[17:03.760 --> 17:11.040]  world order the global takeover and it's just taking over metastasizing shooting out slimy acid-filled
[17:11.040 --> 17:19.520]  tentacles dragging us like so many husky slay dogs in to be absorbed if you haven't seen the thing
[17:19.520 --> 17:24.480]  you don't know what i'm talking about so that's all coming up but i wanted to get into the race
[17:24.480 --> 17:30.800]  banning first and i meant to do this a few days ago now i'm going to have john bound who's a great
[17:30.800 --> 17:36.000]  researcher do a video in the next few days and i'm gonna have paul watson is a great researcher
[17:36.720 --> 17:40.080]  do an article or any of my other writers who want to do an article because i know the history of it
[17:40.080 --> 17:44.400]  but i want to get all the mainstream government documents all the news articles all the photos
[17:44.400 --> 17:52.000]  all the videos all the debates and create i may do a cover story next magazine on the democratic
[17:52.000 --> 17:58.320]  party the the party of the kuklux klan in fact now i'm noticing an article i'm gonna do a whole
[17:58.320 --> 18:03.920]  magazine on this to show how they tried to block the civil rights act the voting rights act to
[18:03.920 --> 18:09.200]  have the votes in there to show how they then openly said in letters lbj and others we've
[18:09.200 --> 18:14.560]  got a flip because the republicans have already had the minority supporting them since the civil
[18:14.560 --> 18:18.240]  war they're going to give these people all their rights and the republican party is going to take
[18:18.240 --> 18:22.960]  over so we got to flip our stuff and just say the minorities will give you everything we'll give you
[18:22.960 --> 18:28.400]  free money and then break up their families and control them and they did that and they know that
[18:28.400 --> 18:34.800]  and that's why ed schultz attacked us on the msnbc i'm going to play this clip coming up that's why
[18:34.800 --> 18:40.240]  other white house front grips came out and attacked us over the weekend media matters you name it
[18:41.760 --> 18:47.360]  because this is really getting close to where they're at so they have to act like ha ha ha
[18:47.360 --> 18:53.280]  it's preposterous they say fish woman the ocean they say drones are in the skies of america they
[18:53.280 --> 18:58.160]  say the affordable care act was written by offshore insurance companies it's going to increase your
[18:58.160 --> 19:07.120]  prizes and has death panels i mean it does but you know these guys are all discredited so that's
[19:07.120 --> 19:12.000]  all the stuff that's going on and unfolding they are so scared of this that i just wanted to know
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.200]  hey schultz see baby we're going to do video reports every week the next few months obnoxiously
[19:17.840 --> 19:21.680]  we're going to get the congressional film footage we're going to show the grand dragons

[24:20.960 --> 24:32.640]  Alex Jones here back live on this Tuesday worldwide transmission all right continuing
[24:32.640 --> 24:38.000]  with this in key historical breakdown that we're going to put in a special video report that's
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.040]  going to air here on the radio show Friday and we're going to do special reports for the next
[24:43.040 --> 24:49.760]  eight weeks every week on the democratic party and its history of hardcore racism lynching
[24:49.760 --> 24:54.880]  murders uh an absolute total evil because you have to understand folks the democratic party
[24:54.880 --> 25:00.480]  was only a party in the deep south after reconstruction in the civil war civil war
[25:00.480 --> 25:06.960]  reconstruction it was the republicans that were the abolitionist party that means abolishing slavery
[25:08.240 --> 25:12.960]  and by the civil rights act the voting rights act that the republicans got through in the early
[25:12.960 --> 25:17.440]  sixties the democrats on record realized that we're going to only be a party of the south
[25:17.440 --> 25:24.640]  it's over for us we give out freebies to poor whites to vote for us we've got to shift this
[25:24.640 --> 25:30.000]  now and still be over poor whites but also minorities and have a great society will get
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.720]  to break up their families not let them have men in the house we'll put them in prison don't worry
[25:34.720 --> 25:38.800]  but we'll make them think that they're our friends that's the Rockefeller Foundation plan
[25:38.800 --> 25:43.120]  by the way of the 1920s and Margaret Sanger on record we're going to have all the quotes of
[25:43.120 --> 25:50.000]  in letters about going out and posing as liberals uh hiring all the black ministers to then sell their
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.240]  people into slavery and we're going to have all those quotes all those letters we're putting
[25:54.240 --> 26:00.880]  some on screen right now if you're a tv viewer of lbj saying quote these negroes they're getting
[26:00.880 --> 26:06.160]  pretty uppity these days and that's a problem for us since they've got something now they never had
[26:06.160 --> 26:12.560]  before the political pull to uh back up their uppityness now we've got to do something about
[26:12.560 --> 26:16.720]  this we've got to give them a little something just enough to quiet them down not enough to make a
[26:16.720 --> 26:22.080]  difference if we don't move all in their allies will line up against us and there'll be no way of
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.640]  stopping them and we'll lose the filibuster as democrats of that then and there'll be no way of
[26:26.640 --> 26:34.320]  putting a break on all sorts of wild legislation it'll be reconstruction all over again so when
[26:34.320 --> 26:40.080]  ed schultz and rachel madow get up there and go the republicans are the party of racism in the south
[26:40.080 --> 26:44.400]  and that's all they're going to be is a regional party now as we bring in 30 million illegals to
[26:44.400 --> 26:51.600]  take over the country they are actually doing what the republican party did in the 1860s and
[26:51.600 --> 27:02.160]  we're doing again in 1960 with eisenhower taking over and so they shifted like a judo move and
[27:02.160 --> 27:06.880]  through the republicans right through the wall and took all the minorities everybody by doubling
[27:06.880 --> 27:11.760]  down on race politics which they were the experts in this and that's why ed schultz and others are
[27:11.760 --> 27:16.160]  so scared of this they all know this that's why you tune in it's race this race that race race
[27:16.160 --> 27:20.960]  race race race race race race race race race race because they're trying to make the republicans
[27:20.960 --> 27:24.880]  what they always were and when they got all the minorities saying hell we'll give you unlimited
[27:24.880 --> 27:29.680]  free welfare the republicans just want to give you freedom to be an american we're going to give
[27:29.680 --> 27:37.520]  you free goods so they doubled down took over and now they've completely sold everybody out
[27:37.520 --> 27:42.960]  and now they're trying to fully extinct any opposition libertarian republican they don't care
[27:42.960 --> 27:49.600]  to consolidate their control and that's why they are so scared right now because if this fact comes
[27:49.600 --> 27:56.960]  out it's over for them it's over for them if everybody becomes a party of liberty and freedom
[27:56.960 --> 28:03.440]  and that's why you vote but not on your race then the establishment including republican leadership
[28:03.440 --> 28:08.400]  have got a big problem and when they made it racially based and the democrats did that republicans
[28:08.400 --> 28:13.200]  actually bought into it and did become kind of the party of white people because the democrats
[28:13.200 --> 28:17.440]  have been the party of white people the republicans have been the party of the republic and everybody
[28:17.440 --> 28:25.360]  has equal rights on record but they got so so judo moved by the democrats and the freebies and
[28:25.360 --> 28:30.000]  everything that they want okay all we do have now is the white people okay we'll kind of play
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.480]  along with that a little bit do you understand that we're going to go out to break with ed shaltz
[28:34.480 --> 28:39.680]  here and then come back and analyze it but but but listen to how desperate he is right now
[28:40.960 --> 28:48.720]  and in pretenders tonight the outrageous alex jones and tucker carlson carlson and jones say they've
[28:48.720 --> 28:55.440]  blown the hood off the democrats kkk movement part-time news host and 911 truth are joined forces to
[28:55.440 --> 29:01.760]  bemoan the white man's persecution we all have been conditioned as republicans or as libertarians
[29:01.760 --> 29:07.840]  or as white people to be oh my gosh we're loving you know we're not racist yes please you know do
[29:07.840 --> 29:12.240]  whatever i'm sorry i'm white and beat ourselves with whips on the head and then meanwhile the
[29:12.240 --> 29:15.840]  democrats have just recreated the kukla clan movement but they've done it with minorities
[29:15.840 --> 29:20.320]  there's a lot of truth in that i wish there weren't the federal government takes sides
[29:20.320 --> 29:27.760]  and hands out spoils based on your skin color really their contention is divided between racism
[29:27.760 --> 29:33.120]  and baseless comments americans of all colors receive government assistance jones and carlson
[29:33.120 --> 29:38.960]  would love to race bait away the data if these two talkers believe a kkk caper is the winning
[29:38.960 --> 29:43.200]  strategy they keep on protecting we're going to come back and break it down stay with us

[34:17.200 --> 34:25.360]  and balkanization in this country now when you look at the ed schultz news piece that we just
[34:25.360 --> 34:33.200]  played part of everything he says is formulae the part time news host a guy that has a show on the
[34:33.200 --> 34:42.560]  weekend on fox news that has more viewers than the top three msnbc shows combined
[34:42.560 --> 34:50.720]  and the guy who heads up a huge alternative real news site that has more viewers than msnbc.com
[34:50.720 --> 34:56.160]  does you can look it up daily caller has more visitors so do we by many times on alexa.com
[34:56.160 --> 35:03.680]  and other metrics he's just a part time news host and he teams up with a 911 truth or that's meant
[35:03.680 --> 35:10.000]  to say hey tucker carlson shouldn't be hanging around with this super hardcore liberal alex
[35:10.000 --> 35:15.600]  jones no i question the official story of 911 i question arming al qaeda to attack syria i know
[35:15.600 --> 35:19.520]  they're letting these groups attack us bare minimum to take our liberties and tucker carlson
[35:19.520 --> 35:23.840]  in an upcoming interview we haven't aired yet it'll air friday the in studio interview it's
[35:23.840 --> 35:27.440]  going to be a special production because i'm going to add clips to it backing up everything i say
[35:28.720 --> 35:34.000]  he said no they have used 911 to take our liberties and to enslave us no one can deny it
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.560]  that's what i'm saying don't let him use terror to take our liberties don't let him use the gulf
[35:38.560 --> 35:48.880]  atonkin back to lbj to get us in the vietnam war don't they let crises destroy our liberty regardless
[35:48.880 --> 35:54.080]  whether they're real manufactured provocaturd whether they opened the door did the whole thing
[35:54.080 --> 36:01.440]  regardless it was used and so every time they attack me on msnbc or raw story or media matters
[36:01.440 --> 36:05.680]  they say 911 truth or as if that's something to demonize and then they connected to the
[36:05.680 --> 36:11.360]  republican party when i'm not about the republican party i'm about opposition if the republican party
[36:11.360 --> 36:16.720]  was taking over and doing all this i would support any opposition to it i didn't like stuff bush was
[36:16.720 --> 36:22.800]  doing it was a giant critic the democratic party though is a nasty organization at the top they
[36:22.800 --> 36:27.120]  have a lot of nice people in it and folks that are democrats because their granddaddy was a democrat
[36:28.800 --> 36:35.120]  and a lot of the biggest redneck right wing people i know and quite frankly some of the
[36:35.120 --> 36:42.160]  few racist i know are democrats folks growing up and currently they're the kind of guys that'll
[36:42.160 --> 36:47.680]  make little comments and stuff the only people i've ever heard that are white that have made
[36:47.680 --> 36:53.840]  racial comments are democrats i can say that unequivocally and that's well known to anybody
[36:53.840 --> 37:00.640]  that actually studies politics and that is what is so frustrating about all this then they say oh
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.040]  you're racist republicans if you don't let 30 million more illegals be legal and bring their
[37:05.040 --> 37:11.120]  families in which signs our death warrant to the whole world just come here and then once you get
[37:11.120 --> 37:15.920]  here you get free welfare can have your babies for free that's the incentive to come here and go
[37:15.920 --> 37:19.760]  with the democrats and republican leadership that's for it as well because they work for the same
[37:19.760 --> 37:27.760]  globalist i mean that is suicide imagine if mexico said come here everything's free you would have
[37:27.760 --> 37:34.000]  hundreds of millions of people doing everything they could to buy a plane ticket to come to mexico

[38:22.800 --> 38:28.400]  to take our guns you name it but but but getting back getting back to tucker carlsson and the attack
[38:28.400 --> 38:33.920]  on he and i working together just in a friendly way i'm coming on air they want to dictate who
[38:33.920 --> 38:40.240]  can go on whose show most of the time when msnbc or media matters attacks it's like um a republican
[38:40.240 --> 38:46.880]  congressman come on alex jones's show oh ted cruz came on oh rand paul did oh ron paul did
[38:46.880 --> 38:53.200]  don't talk to that cook they don't want what they see the radicalization of a hardcore liberal like
[38:53.200 --> 39:00.880]  myself and thomas jefferson vane a real liberal hardcore liberal bleeding hard on fire with wanting
[39:00.880 --> 39:07.600]  to animate humanity and liberate humanity and have maximum individual freedom maximum diversity
[39:07.600 --> 39:14.320]  maximum choice maximum tolerance but that means you don't tell me how to live either maximum
[39:14.320 --> 39:23.760]  don't put me in a box i am a flaming liberal folks flaming flaming i love all the big liberal
[39:23.760 --> 39:28.400]  philosophers you read them they sound like hardcore libertarians or or constitutionalist that's
[39:28.400 --> 39:34.320]  because our founders were reading all of that folks in latin they were into all that they were the
[39:34.320 --> 39:39.280]  flower of the renaissance we need to rediscover our birthright that was never perfectly implemented
[39:39.280 --> 39:44.880]  but to that point was the greatest idea ever that led to so many other forms of liberation
[39:44.880 --> 39:51.120]  the problem is then it just gets co-opted when the whites stop using race politics to control things
[39:51.120 --> 39:56.880]  and then the groups that said oh we just want equality they start using it themselves because
[39:56.880 --> 40:01.360]  it's a good way to take over if you're not actually free market and about free association
[40:01.360 --> 40:06.160]  be about skin be about what religion you are be about what region you are be about your sexual
[40:06.160 --> 40:10.560]  preference because then it doesn't have to be about what you're producing what music what literature
[40:10.560 --> 40:16.240]  what art what you built the service you did who you were see oh no they want to be about race or
[40:16.240 --> 40:20.880]  i've got a handlebar mustache and tattoos and wear different color socks oh my gosh the women
[40:20.880 --> 40:26.400]  all want me because i'm a trendy and that's what you do to get women you don't actually stand for
[40:26.400 --> 40:31.120]  something you don't actually produce something you didn't write beautiful literature you didn't come
[40:31.120 --> 40:37.600]  up with great music i don't care if you're black or white i don't care if you're a great guitarist
[40:37.600 --> 40:44.320]  like uh you know jimmy page versus jimmy hindricks i can admire them both and they both speak to my
[40:44.320 --> 40:48.640]  soul i'm not thinking about what color they are when i'm listening to your music you see this is
[40:48.640 --> 40:55.600]  the fundamentalness of gang government click government mafia government monopoly government
[40:55.600 --> 41:04.080]  crony government command and control government in society gang government versus freedom government
[41:04.720 --> 41:10.080]  which comes from the inside as martin Luther king said the character of someone's deeds what
[41:10.080 --> 41:15.280]  they stand for what they produce somebody had the best restaurant in town and had the best
[41:16.240 --> 41:19.680]  dish that was your favorite would you go there if it was owned by a black person of your white
[41:19.680 --> 41:23.680]  oh yeah you'd go there if you were black and some white person on the restaurant that had food
[41:23.680 --> 41:28.800]  that was your favorite would you go there yeah you know you go there because what they got is good
[41:28.800 --> 41:35.280]  what they got you want what they produce what that tree if a tree had dark green leaves or light
[41:35.280 --> 41:41.200]  green leaves would you if you were a light green leaf would you still like the dark green tree give
[41:41.200 --> 41:46.800]  it produce great fruit of course you would they don't want to make it about what you stand for
[41:46.800 --> 41:51.280]  and what you do and what you produce they want to make it about what group you're part of and look i
[41:51.280 --> 41:56.000]  don't care if you got beards and handle bar bust ashes and tattoos all over you and different color
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.560]  socks i mean hell that's what gets you success why not you've learned to go along with it i don't
[42:00.560 --> 42:05.360]  care about your style i think it's fine everybody's got their own style i'm not knocking you i'm not
[42:05.360 --> 42:11.120]  judging you i know i know a lot of you are listeners i'm saying that's a that's a crew that's a gang
[42:11.120 --> 42:21.760]  folks there's a gang that wears sports jackets and ties and submarine watches and if you dress
[42:21.760 --> 42:26.720]  like that suddenly the establishment listens to you so i do it too i put on the monkey outfit
[42:27.920 --> 42:31.760]  because it just makes people listen to what i have to say more so i'm a big hypocrite
[42:31.760 --> 42:40.400]  well none of us are perfect but we can aspire to a higher level and a better level is what i'm saying
[42:42.400 --> 42:46.160]  you know the big fat is dressed up like your jz and you can go pick the women up
[42:46.160 --> 42:50.560]  because they've got a fantasy they're going to be with jz and so even if you're not jz
[42:50.560 --> 42:55.280]  but you go out and get a outie and act like you're jz you're going to get all this success
[42:55.280 --> 43:03.600]  because people are living a delusion now it won't last long term because it's fake and it's
[43:03.600 --> 43:08.480]  transitory you only get empty dumb people but that doesn't matter short term to you does it
[43:08.480 --> 43:14.800]  because you're not looking for a long haul real success you're looking for the image of success
[43:17.840 --> 43:25.040]  the veneer not the bonafide but it will be bonafide it will be real mccoy it will be certified
[43:25.040 --> 43:32.560]  great a real deal that will satisfy you in your life folks being real being truthful being honorable
[43:32.560 --> 43:39.120]  not being a coward the essence of being a man the very essence of success being a woman being
[43:39.120 --> 43:46.000]  beautiful virtuous true strong daring creative the essence of being a woman the essence of your
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.640]  life on this planet the essence of the great noble species that you're part of the essence
[43:50.640 --> 43:58.560]  and then you look at msnbc total balkanization total division scare the republicans off from
[43:58.560 --> 44:05.120]  alex jones oh my gosh if his talking points ever get picked up by them they will radicalize the
[44:05.120 --> 44:10.720]  population takeover and we'll have a new 1776 on our hands but this time nonviolent cultural
[44:10.720 --> 44:14.560]  i mean they say that in government white papers that are public we've covered on air they say in
[44:14.560 --> 44:19.360]  the news my god the republicans are passing laws off what alex jones talks about and they trace them
[44:19.360 --> 44:25.520]  directly back to me and drudge amplifying it they go alex put it out drudge amplified it it
[44:25.520 --> 44:32.560]  became law they had hearings on this and then what happens to your gun control push then what
[44:32.560 --> 44:37.200]  happens to your drones then what happens to your nsa because you know i'm telling the truth you know
[44:37.200 --> 44:41.600]  i've got you with your pants down you know i read all the history books you know ed shoals you're a
[44:41.600 --> 44:48.480]  big fat degenerate race baiting scumbag you punk you're a big city politician i could just see what
[44:48.480 --> 44:53.040]  you talk about when you're drinking drinking that scotch with your buddies at the old irish bar
[44:53.040 --> 44:59.520]  oh i can hear it coming out of your mouth listen punk i know who you are you probably have all
[44:59.520 --> 45:04.000]  the news his irish bar what do you think it's irish no i'm saying i know where you go drinking buddy
[45:04.720 --> 45:08.880]  i'm part irish the point is don't try your race baiter on that either i know how you pee brains
[45:08.880 --> 45:15.360]  operate because that's what works on the public is simple dumb down propaganda i was having a
[45:15.360 --> 45:21.600]  meeting last night with a top national psychologist i'll just leave it at that and some top lawyers
[45:21.600 --> 45:26.640]  they were talking about that they go how do you tell the truth that's complex the general masses
[45:26.640 --> 45:35.440]  can't interface with and fight people that just tell laws uh walls of of simplified lies and i
[45:35.440 --> 45:39.760]  just said you got to show people that the hat trick you got to show them how the scan works
[45:39.760 --> 45:43.840]  and if they ever get it once they don't go back because now they know the trick
[45:43.840 --> 45:49.680]  with the rabbit the rabbit's really in a secret door being put up through the floor into the
[45:49.680 --> 45:54.160]  container and then they just open it up on the table he's in and you know the hat has a
[45:54.160 --> 45:57.520]  trap door and he reached down into the box and pulled the rabbit up through the hat
[45:58.560 --> 46:02.080]  and you can't explain that to a two-year-old but by the time they're four years old you can
[46:02.080 --> 46:06.640]  explain to your son or daughter when you take them to a magic show you see that box that table
[46:06.640 --> 46:11.840]  there's a hidden compartment with a rabbit in it that he loaded in there and then he's gonna show
[46:11.840 --> 46:15.920]  you the hat fly it around put it down the table reach down through grab the rabbit and then pull
[46:15.920 --> 46:22.480]  it up out of the hat and then your four-year-old sees it and gets it that's the secret to this show
[46:22.480 --> 46:28.400]  is that we're simply showing people the hat tricks and explaining how the games work and what happened
[46:28.400 --> 46:32.640]  historically and that's the only way to beat tyrants it's the only way to be aware of how
[46:32.640 --> 46:39.120]  things operate it's the only way to change the paradigm is to get outside the propaganda they
[46:39.120 --> 46:47.760]  put out and the fake ra ra coke pepsi redskins cowboys uh forge heavy fake debate and pull back
[46:47.760 --> 46:53.280]  outside the box and outside the arena and see the whole thing for what it is historically the
[46:53.280 --> 46:58.080]  social engineering they're engaged in and then you'll laugh at yourself forever being part of it
[46:58.080 --> 47:03.680]  and i know most of you as an audience understand this and fully get this but i'm talking to new
[47:03.680 --> 47:08.320]  audiences out there they're tuning in that don't understand this it's a fact the democrats were
[47:08.320 --> 47:15.760]  the party of the kook lux plan it's a fact they were a party isolated only uh to the south it's
[47:15.760 --> 47:19.760]  a fact they figured out that wasn't working in the 20s and started the rockefeller foundation
[47:19.760 --> 47:24.480]  trying to infiltrate and take over the minorities but to get them domesticated on welfare to reduce
[47:24.480 --> 47:31.760]  their population then you expand out to the 50s and 60s the democrats openly say we've got to become
[47:31.760 --> 47:36.480]  the party of the minorities and race bait from every direction because of demographics because
[47:36.480 --> 47:40.080]  the republicans are totally annihilating us because they're the party of lincoln and they're
[47:40.080 --> 47:45.200]  actually unifying the country we can't have this and i read you president lbj saying that it'll be
[47:45.200 --> 47:49.520]  reconstruction all over again and these blacks are going to get real freedom under eisenhower
[47:50.640 --> 47:55.680]  and people like my grandfather who got out of world war two later ran for office as a republican
[47:55.680 --> 48:03.360]  and he's texas and supported desegregation so you got to understand folks that's the type of things
[48:03.360 --> 48:09.040]  that go on in this country and whether you're for segregation or not i know a lot of you old
[48:09.040 --> 48:13.360]  democrats your grand dragons and stuff you know you're slick enough to go out and act like you
[48:13.360 --> 48:17.600]  care about the minorities and you run their lives now and it's pretty funny to you i don't think it's
[48:17.600 --> 48:23.520]  funny living in a balkanized dumb down country i really want to try to empower everybody but people
[48:23.520 --> 48:31.920]  like schultz you know know exactly what they're doing whether he's down at the old german bar
[48:31.920 --> 48:36.240]  down at the old irish bar making jokes about the minorities i'm saying hypothetically is a joke
[48:36.240 --> 48:41.600]  you know that i'm teasing but just so many of the old democrats are you know their whole world is
[48:41.600 --> 48:45.200]  race baiting their experts on it they come from the big cities where everybody lives in their own
[48:45.200 --> 48:51.120]  neighborhood everything's racial politics and they're just deploying that now on a larger scale
[48:53.360 --> 48:56.640]  and they're arrogant and they're pushing our buttons and it needs to stop
[48:56.640 --> 49:03.600]  and it's the same thing they did a few days ago in raw story where they said tucker carlson
[49:03.600 --> 49:08.880]  and allex jones democratic party now kkk but with minorities in the short clip they played on raw
[49:08.880 --> 49:13.040]  story that they've been played on schultz they added out where i say they were the party of
[49:13.040 --> 49:17.440]  the kuklux klan demographically the president said that they had to shift to minorities because
[49:17.440 --> 49:21.840]  the republicans were beating them they cut all that out and just had me saying they're the kkk
[49:21.840 --> 49:28.320]  which sounds outlandish we're gonna skip this network break please which is outlandish
[49:28.960 --> 49:34.160]  to the average dumbed down democrat out there who doesn't even know that the earth orbits the sun
[49:34.160 --> 49:40.080]  literally and who will sign petitions in austin texas or in california to put gun owners in fema
[49:40.080 --> 49:46.000]  camps and execute us i mean we we have those man on the streets we've done and mark dice has done
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.200]  that's how dumb down and crazy these people are on their welfare check with their bag of marijuana
[49:51.200 --> 49:56.000]  they watch tv all day and and you know eat sugared cereal all day i don't care if they're black
[49:56.000 --> 50:01.360]  white hispanic they don't know what planet they're on and they will pull the lever to take our guns
[50:01.360 --> 50:06.560]  anything else as long as they get that welfare check and that's that's that's that's the demographic
[50:06.560 --> 50:13.440]  change of the slug like population out there and that's the game over of the clowered and
[50:13.440 --> 50:18.640]  piven welfare domestication program they don't care of it wrecks productivity and wrecks the
[50:18.640 --> 50:23.680]  country's future as long as they're in control and they're doing an incredible job and they're this
[50:23.680 --> 50:29.920]  close to winning if there isn't an epiphany and a giant awakening to the hat trick and the scam
[50:29.920 --> 50:33.600]  that they're running it's over folks you better pack it up and go to switzerland
[50:35.040 --> 50:41.040]  i wish there was some other quasi-free country out there this is a serious situation and i know
[50:41.040 --> 50:48.320]  you know that but but listen again to ed schultz with his tiny audience say that tucker carlson
[50:48.320 --> 50:52.880]  that's all over the weekday shows with commentary to three four five million people
[50:52.880 --> 50:58.800]  all over the weekend show with two three million viewers huge website reaching millions of people
[50:58.800 --> 51:05.280]  a day and he's a part-time nobody and notice what they said in raw story tucker carlson elix
[51:05.280 --> 51:11.760]  jones democratic party now kkk but with minorities fox host tucker carlson appear on right wing
[51:11.760 --> 51:18.400]  conspiracy theorist radio show friday wait a minute they changed this i want you guys
[51:19.680 --> 51:24.320]  to go into the stack of sunday's news it's over there and pull me the printout they took out of
[51:24.320 --> 51:31.680]  here where it said internet only oh my gosh because i ran it about this i was listing stations from
[51:31.680 --> 51:38.160]  austin the noxville from southern california to you know chicago from rochester to buffalo to
[51:39.840 --> 51:48.080]  tampa florida to i mean you just name it just over 160 stations and they were saying i was
[51:48.080 --> 51:52.400]  internet only it's always minimize lie lie lie lie lie and i was just reading this and they took
[51:52.400 --> 51:56.800]  it out because they just reprinted this for me so the point is this is what they do so now tucker
[51:56.800 --> 52:02.320]  carlson see that lie didn't work so tucker carlson he's a part-time guy he's a failure you know he
[52:02.320 --> 52:08.480]  went outside at his own website and is more successful than msnbc and cnbc's website combined
[52:08.480 --> 52:12.560]  he's a nobody and matt drudge by the way whose site's you know 50 times bigger than the daily caller
[52:13.360 --> 52:19.840]  he's not successful he's only on the internet okay so so if you did something completely on your own
[52:19.840 --> 52:25.920]  you're even more unsuccessful than some failed guy from talk radio like ed shultz with tiny just
[52:25.920 --> 52:32.000]  ridiculous audiences in failed network at your failed network lecturing us how we're nobody see
[52:32.000 --> 52:37.920]  it's all about projecting this reality that they're big and we're small and they're liberal and we're
[52:37.920 --> 52:46.960]  fascist and ha ha ha democrats and republicans uh you know being connected uh to uh you know to uh
[52:46.960 --> 52:51.440]  you know political manipulations and race baiting both parties do it just the democrats are the
[52:51.440 --> 53:00.320]  originals acting like abolition wasn't the party of link and the republicans acting like the republicans
[53:00.320 --> 53:04.720]  didn't pass this civil rights act against the democrats wishes acting like we don't have all
[53:04.720 --> 53:09.120]  these letters from democratic operatives and presidents about trying to keep the inwards down
[53:09.120 --> 53:17.440]  acting like all they can only do this because the general public is ignorant they're not dumb
[53:17.440 --> 53:22.880]  overall they know all about football all about acting cool all about the latest movies all about
[53:22.880 --> 53:28.400]  baseball cards all about cosmetics all about having mimosas with their girlfriends at sunday
[53:28.400 --> 53:36.080]  brunch all everybody knows about everything except how the world works and that's a recipe to be a
[53:36.080 --> 53:41.040]  bunch of slaves let's go ahead and go to the ed shultz clip here it is and in pretenders tonight
[53:41.040 --> 53:49.040]  the outrangers like jones and tucker carlson and jones say they've blown the hood off the democrats
[53:49.040 --> 53:56.000]  kkk movement part-time news host and 911 truth are joined forces to bemoan the white man's persecution
[53:57.040 --> 54:02.560]  we all have been conditioned as republicans or as libertarians or as white people to be oh my gosh
[54:02.560 --> 54:07.680]  we're loving you know we're not racist yes please you know do whatever i'm sorry i'm white
[54:07.680 --> 54:11.600]  that beat ourselves with whips on the head and then meanwhile the democrats have just
[54:11.600 --> 54:16.400]  recreated the kook lux clan movement but they've done it with minorities there's a lot of truth
[54:16.400 --> 54:21.600]  in that i wish there weren't the federal government takes sides and hands out spoils based on your
[54:21.600 --> 54:28.240]  skin color really their contention is divided between racism and baseless comments americans
[54:28.240 --> 54:34.160]  of all colors receive government assistance jones and carlson would love to race bait away the data
[54:34.160 --> 54:40.080]  if these two talkers believe a kkk caper is the winning strategy they keep on pretending all right
[54:40.080 --> 54:46.640]  folks so there you go and i was actually able to pull it up on the youtube channel where i showed
[54:46.640 --> 54:56.160]  screenshots of it the original article where they came out on sunday and said that i was an internet
[54:56.160 --> 55:03.120]  only radio show and now raw story didn't retract that they just took it out there and said i'm not
[55:03.120 --> 55:09.760]  internet only and again the reason that's so funny is that it shows how delusional they are it says
[55:09.760 --> 55:16.800]  fox news host tucker carlson appeared on right wing conspiracy enthuses alex jones internet only
[55:17.440 --> 55:23.040]  radio show friday now uh there it is on screen from the video sunday when i covered it on the tv
[55:23.040 --> 55:29.680]  show slash radio show here it is today just freshly printed fox news host tucker carlson appeared on
[55:29.680 --> 55:35.760]  right wing conspiracy enthuses alex jones radio show friday and the reason that's such a big deal

[1:08:27.920 --> 1:08:44.240]  all right folks here we are i want to open the phones up on
[1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:49.360]  the democratic party and the history of the fact that they were the party the kukluks clan
[1:08:49.920 --> 1:08:55.680]  and the republicans passed the voting rights act under eisenhower of the civil rights act
[1:08:55.680 --> 1:08:59.600]  and so that made them really angry and so they doubled back and became
[1:08:59.600 --> 1:09:05.200]  the party of the quote minorities but just teaching the minorities all the kukluks clan
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:13.600]  race-based mecha la raza that means the race mecha means something entirely similar but the point
[1:09:13.600 --> 1:09:20.480]  is is that la raza means the race and it's so frustrating to see all of this unfolding and
[1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:24.880]  the fact that they're using race-based politics to say turn your guns under your racist support
[1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:29.920]  obama carrier racist and whites have been so conditioned to be politically correct that
[1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:34.880]  they could say go jump off a cliff white person or your racist the average white person would
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:40.720]  probably jump off a cliff even with their newborn baby if ordered to do so by rachel maddow or ed
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:47.280]  schultz and that is literal cult-like control i think if i told the average democratic trendy
[1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:52.560]  stab your child with a butcher knife to prove that you love obama they would probably do it
[1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:58.960]  i'm not joking i mean let them double your health care for obama okay but believe the price was
[1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:04.000]  lowered at the same time two plus two equals five and they would say yes and i'm not being sarcastic
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:09.680]  here this is cult level control so i want to give the number out on that subject and others
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:19.840]  here is the toll free number to join us 800 259 92 31 800 25 at 99 231 as we get into the second
[1:10:19.840 --> 1:10:28.160]  hour here it's first time callers i want to add first time callers today 800 259 92 31 and while
[1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:34.400]  we're getting your phone calls coming in let me um go over some of the interesting news uh that we've
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:41.840]  got here in the stacks today that i've not yet launched into putin says no immediate need to
[1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:47.600]  invade ukraine leaves threat dangling bloomberg reports vatamir puti put his bush called him
[1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:52.480]  said he sees no immediate need to invade eastern ukraine as the obama administration prepares one
[1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:58.160]  billion in loan guarantees for the cash strapped nation so they're going into debt to the eu now
[1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:03.280]  isn't that a great deal and threatens sanctions against russia in his first public remark since
[1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:08.640]  russia uh forces took control of kramian peninsula where they have their bases in southern ukraine
[1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:14.160]  president putin reserved the right to use force to protect ethnic russians there's no such necessity
[1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:20.000]  close quote to do so at present he said secretary of state john skull and bones carry arrived in
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:25.360]  kieb to present a financial aid package to present a knife for them to slip their throat
[1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:30.960]  politically and financially to the interim government which needs as much as 15 billion
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:38.560]  in the coming years to stay afloat clearly putin would like to lower some of the rhetoric uh paul
[1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:45.040]  denoun who oversees 29 billion of emerging market dead in new york-based alliance burnstein holdings
[1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:51.040]  lp said today by phone but i think he's signaled a new direction in his intentions we still think
[1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:59.200]  there's risk of escalation uh yeah if the west keeps poking the russian bear continuing russia warns
[1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:05.680]  it could quote reduce to zero economic dependency on the us stop using the dollar and pull out of
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:10.480]  business deals with the quote united states the globalists don't care that'll just depress both russian
[1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:16.240]  and us markets which allows the globalist parasites to come in and further consolidate control that's
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:20.880]  why wall street said go ahead do it we'll just inflate our own systems of course that may be an
[1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:25.920]  empty threat because even though the stock markets rigged it went down a lot yesterday on concerns
[1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:30.320]  and so they kind of backed off a little bit as well putin calls using force in ukraine a last
[1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:36.720]  resort again orders troops to stop advancing that's new york post ukraine conflict global
[1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:42.880]  economic crisis brewing our local problem the christian science monitor asked that question i
[1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:49.200]  say it's as the potential for both putin blames coup for ukraine crisis says russian reserves
[1:12:49.200 --> 1:12:54.000]  the right to continue to use force well it is a coup a western backed system did overthrow an
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:59.920]  elected government whether that elected government was good or not the outside forces did that on
[1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:06.560]  russia's doorstep and our government run by george soros and soros groups literally that's who's
[1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:14.720]  behind obama to a great extent is trying to overthrow russia itself can you imagine if russia
[1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:20.000]  was trying to overthrow the u.s government what would happen i mean i mean this is incredible
[1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:25.760]  it's like come on be a nice sport russians and again people go what are you for the corrupt
[1:13:25.760 --> 1:13:30.400]  russian government hey man they're not over trying to take my guns they're not over here trying to
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:35.760]  run my life well come on let the government take your ride salads because you know al-qaeda
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:40.880]  oh that our government runs in syria and that they are now funding and that now they say the
[1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:45.760]  the main enemy of the government's the tea party you bait and switch that i called that 12 years ago
[1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:54.160]  i mean this is ridiculous so that's just some of the information uh the prime minister of cramia
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:59.680]  uh the autonomous ukrainian republic seized by russia military forces said today that a majority
[1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:04.240]  of ukraine military units of the peninsula had surrendered and pledged allegiance to pro russian
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:08.800]  government so russia is going to abandon the dollar a reserve currency good luck with that one
[1:14:08.800 --> 1:14:16.320]  that's the london telegraph uh making jokes uh on that subject obama shoved to the sidelines
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:26.240]  as russia ignores us threats of isolation so that's just some of the news uh on the ukraine front
[1:14:27.520 --> 1:14:35.920]  and that ties into this report out of cnbc us stocks rally is ukraine worries ease
[1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:43.520]  dal surges 200 plus points s and p up as well but the situation in ukraine while much improved
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:49.120]  was by no means resolved an investor sentiment can turn on the dime i agree with that statement
[1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:57.360]  get ready for the dow at 6 000 that would be a two-thirds reduction by 2016 says a pro the stock
[1:14:57.360 --> 1:15:02.800]  market is in a bubble that's that's that's just stating a fact that is setting up for a major
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:08.960]  crash with the dow jones industrial average likely to hit 17 000 level in the next few years
[1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:15.040]  before plummeting to 6 000 by 2016 author and market observer harry s dent junior he's very
[1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:21.200]  accurate let's get dent back on he's been before on before i think we see another correction crash
[1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:26.640]  that is larger than the last one said dent author of the demographic cliff you know that's the baby
[1:15:26.640 --> 1:15:32.080]  boomers retiring during an interview with closing bell i think this will be the most dangerous period
[1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:39.520]  in people's lives i agree with that statement i mean we are any way you look at at any angle
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:46.800]  any slice dice we are in whoa i mean like you're in a race car doing 250 right now folks you better
[1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:53.360]  be white knuckles folks and everything you're doing we are all collected we just i mean this is
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:16:01.200]  inches from the cliff on so many angles war economic collapse paramilitary operations
[1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:07.200]  terrorist groups radical groups radicalization with the globalist busy trying to demonize any
[1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:11.440]  traditionalist who just wants common sense that's worked in every civilization in history
[1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:17.440]  because we're the people in opposition to totally being overwritten by a synthetic corporate takeover
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:21.680]  that's butchering the biosphere the real environment while cheerleading that they
[1:16:21.680 --> 1:16:26.800]  run the environmental movement i mean it is on so many fronts right now
[1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:28.800]  now
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:36.320]  the west is dying with 1.3 percent child replacement and i'm not some racialist that's
[1:16:36.320 --> 1:16:42.560]  obsessed with race i like all cultures groups i like reading national geographic i'm a fan of
[1:16:42.560 --> 1:16:47.840]  humans but i mean white people are about six percent of the world population were true whites
[1:16:48.560 --> 1:16:54.240]  and demographically 100 years they'll be one percent white and all i see worldwide news is
[1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:57.680]  how evil white people are what are you gonna do when there's no white people to kick around anymore
[1:17:00.960 --> 1:17:05.840]  i mean there's just on so many fronts the world is crazy right now
[1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:14.400]  but people have the illusion you see people think we're overpopulated which some arguments we are
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:18.480]  some arguments we aren't certainly some of the technology is toxic and needs to be upgraded
[1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:21.920]  people need to be industrialized and they have less kids look at the west
[1:17:21.920 --> 1:17:24.960]  but if you look at what's happening
[1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:32.480]  it's like a coral reef you can be out in the caribbean and go 20 miles and not see any fish
[1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:36.960]  and then you come up on a coral reef and it's teeming that's what cities are everybody congregates
[1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:41.760]  for business and industry and jobs and then you go look there's so many people here well that's
[1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:46.400]  what allows you to have cars and go to movie theaters and have all the choices of the restaurants and
[1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:51.760]  do all that because you're in the coral reef and yeah in the coral reef there's a clown fish
[1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:57.680]  there's an eel there's a shark there's a dolphin there's an octopus there's a school of squid
[1:17:57.680 --> 1:18:02.480]  because you're in the coral reef but you turn your car out and drive 20 miles out in the middle
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:08.080]  of nowhere there's nothing and you drive further you might drive two hours till you see a gas station
[1:18:08.880 --> 1:18:14.880]  oh there's a starfish so again that's how they create this illusion that's the same thing where
[1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:20.720]  you sit around and you go yeah these white people we got to get rid of them look at all of them over
[1:18:20.720 --> 1:18:25.040]  there that's like being in a colony of a near extinct group of people
[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:32.880]  and then it adds to it the scarcity of it makes it even more of a fetish and an obsession
[1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:36.800]  with the so-called minority groups and it's just a disastrous situation
[1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:44.720]  you got 94 percent of the world that's not white and you've got this obsession by the whites about
[1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:50.080]  being white and by everybody else about whites and you just add all the ethnic problems to that
[1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:54.640]  that go with that and then you have globalist elitism not wanting to industrialize the third world
[1:18:54.640 --> 1:18:59.120]  so the third world can be controlled and the third world could be developed properly
[1:18:59.120 --> 1:19:05.440]  and could be lifted up and informed every metric study shows it but there is a diabolical plan
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:11.520]  to keep not just the third world in the quote minority 94 percent in the dark but they want to
[1:19:11.520 --> 1:19:18.480]  take the western culture regardless of skin color that idea of magna carta renaissance classical
[1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:25.440]  music space travel fission fusion quantum mechanics and destroy it because something intelligent
[1:19:26.080 --> 1:19:32.240]  and something powerful is threatening to the elites that came out of western culture
[1:19:32.880 --> 1:19:39.440]  that understand the powerful potential of western renaissance fully deployed in the civilization
[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:48.160]  that is the ultimate selfishness kill western civilization but use its technology to dominate
[1:19:48.160 --> 1:19:54.880]  and enslave the globe attack from every position to the globalist are playing everybody off against

[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:51.520]  yeah listening on ksco 1080 am thank you for calling in sir well hi alex i'm i'm glad you
[1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:56.640]  sound good today and i wanted to remind you of your victories right now that that you did
[1:24:56.640 --> 1:25:01.120]  help get rid of this pierce morgan it's our victory without this audience i'm nothing go ahead
[1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:09.360]  and i'm glad the man you had yesterday is his name david on the air that ran the show he
[1:25:09.360 --> 1:25:16.400]  he's talking about the fda and uh i'm trying to say that the uh the things aren't happening
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:22.720]  chronologically you know they're doing something wrong here the fda and you answer it or we answer it
[1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:28.080]  they're doing something over here and i think it's happening like uh connect the dots things
[1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:32.880]  aren't happening right it's asymmetrical and we think like their history's only actors
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:37.680]  they're the only people that have power no no we're doing things they're humans too
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:42.240]  that's why they tell us we have no power because we do have power and we're having all sorts of
[1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:47.440]  victories and we don't go back and look at our victories enough but look at the disconnect
[1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:52.480]  of cnn i could have told them and i did three years ago pierce morgan's going to be a disaster
[1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:56.880]  your ratings are going down because of your establishment builds and you have more competition
[1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:05.200]  and and and it just shows the disconnect of the establishment can i ask you a far out topic here
[1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:11.120]  that i haven't heard you talk about reincarnation now i think even the bible has some things about
[1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:16.720]  reincarnation they thought jesus was somebody else it's a i think what's happening a lot of liberals
[1:26:17.280 --> 1:26:21.920]  and this may be strange but hold on here man i think a lot of liberals because there really
[1:26:21.920 --> 1:26:30.000]  was slavery a lot of liberals actually were white slave owners or in the previous life
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:34.800]  and they're actually getting rid of their guilt and the you know and there's people that was an
[1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:38.480]  interesting theory you can make a movie out of that look listen i appreciate your call let me comment
[1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:48.240]  on that christ came to earth before as melchizedek not as a reincarnation but manifested and then they
[1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:56.000]  talk about he's of the line of david king david return it meant genetically it was the return
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:02.640]  of king david as prophesied not reincarnation i don't judge people that feel like they've been
[1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:09.680]  reincarnated because if you study the epigenetics and the science you that's how god operates it's
[1:27:09.680 --> 1:27:13.600]  so fabulous it's on multi levels and i don't want to get into religious debates because the average
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:18.640]  bap is the people out there you know who are going off you know 18th century stuff and science of that
[1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:24.000]  age they try to interpret the bible through ancient science and really turn a lot of people away
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:28.560]  from god and in sort of other big denominations because they're trying to play god as if they
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:36.000]  know god's plan the science keeps proving the creator not the other way around like you get
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:43.680]  judged in this life and you get judged in the next life okay and and and by that you do live
[1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:48.480]  again but it's a spiritual level and undoubtedly the science shows there's a sixth sense there's
[1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:53.680]  something else operating on top of this body that is like a computer interface for something else
[1:27:53.680 --> 1:27:59.360]  they show it with plants you name it there is a spirit in everything and ours is made in the
[1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:05.840]  image of the creator that's pretty heavy folks we're made in the image of god our spirit is
[1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:12.640]  we're gonna get a spirit body in the image of the entity the supreme being that made all this
[1:28:12.640 --> 1:28:17.440]  that's a science fiction movie i'm buying into and and and i've had experiences i'm not gonna get
[1:28:17.440 --> 1:28:23.680]  into folks i know it's real okay and i mean we're on a planet in each space i mean this is wild
[1:28:25.040 --> 1:28:29.600]  but it's all science-based and the modern science all lies to tell you you're an animal you're
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:33.120]  programmable because they don't want you to know your real power they eliter all into this stuff
[1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:36.880]  but from the dark side they know there's a spiritual force they bought into the dark side
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:43.040]  because it's easier quicker more seductive to quote yoda and when you look at this whole thing
[1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:52.960]  we now have memories that are from our ancestors racial memories are real arc types are real
[1:28:54.240 --> 1:28:59.440]  the dna is holding entire recordings i mean you think they could put the whole library of
[1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:03.600]  congress now on on one thumb drive with some of the new stuff coming out some of the new
[1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:09.280]  compression folks it's all in us already so we don't just have a spirit this earth suit
[1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:17.280]  it also literally is all of our ancestors dna all the mitochondrial dna viral rna and a bunch
[1:29:17.280 --> 1:29:23.360]  of other stuff they're finding all connected with the space winds actually electrochemically
[1:29:23.360 --> 1:29:28.800]  energizing us like you think a plant needs sun we don't just get sun folks we are energized by
[1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:34.640]  the deep space radiation so much other stuff we are literally antennas ladies and gentlemen
[1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:39.360]  and we are experiencing things on so many levels we can't even imagine it and that's what all the
[1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:45.040]  globalist fog electronic chemical biological is to block us from them they want to keep us in a
[1:29:45.040 --> 1:29:52.080]  small little box under their control stay with us more calls coming up we're on the march the empires
[1:29:52.080 --> 1:30:02.400]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network alex jones here to tell you about how you can

[1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:57.600]  captain america they say let's listen to the captain america show it's kind of a tongue in
[1:33:57.600 --> 1:34:02.080]  cheek joke but uh people ought to dig that up online you can find references that i think i'm
[1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:07.600]  joking but but i'm honored by something like that because i am trying to promote the defense of this
[1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:12.320]  republic and the real ideals of america that have never been fully realized but have been
[1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:18.640]  revolutionary for this planet many good ways but so much of human destiny stands and falls

[1:37:54.480 --> 1:38:00.800]  $50,000 settlement well now nsa homeland security withdraws their complaints against companies
[1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:14.480]  parodies but he's moving forward and and so now uh our guest has had a victory nsa homeland security
[1:38:14.480 --> 1:38:25.440]  settle lawsuit uh with the patriot the sock rapids man over satirical business and and and
[1:38:25.440 --> 1:38:30.400]  clearly he can show the nsa logo and change it and you know have the eagle listening to you and
[1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:34.400]  clearly it's a parody and clearly it's the most protected form of speech you know i say it's a
[1:38:34.400 --> 1:38:38.480]  beautiful day that's protective speech but if i say the government is run by a budget degenerate
[1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:42.880]  scum who are out of control need to be arrested that's the most protected form because it's a
[1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:48.560]  political speech go check the rulings and dan mccall joins us of liberty maniacs dot com
[1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:54.160]  and i bet by them coming after him and him suing them and all his attention let me just guess dan
[1:38:54.160 --> 1:38:59.760]  i bet you're selling 10 times the apparel you were previously hey alex great to be on your show
[1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:04.080]  thanks for having me on good to talk with you again uh yeah that's kind of the funny thing
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:09.280]  about this uh you know in a lot of ways knowing what i've heard of a lot of people wouldn't have
[1:39:09.280 --> 1:39:14.880]  heard of liberty maniacs or dan mccall or anything like that without this sort of stupid thing that
[1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:20.080]  happened with the government that the really uh silly choices that they made over the past year
[1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:24.720]  or actually longer than that uh but yeah so that's i i've learned about something called
[1:39:24.720 --> 1:39:31.440]  the barbers price and effect where uh evidently in in the internet uh she uh she's trying to take
[1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:36.160]  stuff down and she was trying to uh when when some stuff was drawn attention to her and she uh
[1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:41.520]  she ended up making a fuss about it and it and it caused a fuss that everyone noticed so it's one
[1:39:41.520 --> 1:39:46.560]  of those things where uh where yeah i i've i've been happy to uh to take the uh to take a little
[1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:51.840]  bit of the notoriety for it in this case because it's it's kind of uh it's highlighted some of
[1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:57.360]  the stupid choices that they're making and continue to make i love that poster you designed behind you
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:02.240]  it says look like you've had a little too much to think with the police officer coming over and
[1:40:02.240 --> 1:40:06.880]  you know nothing against uh the guy that did all the obey stuff but that was all coming from a leftist
[1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:11.680]  communist position and you know there's so much other libertarian or conservative or just common
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:17.440]  sense uh just pro-liberty stuff that really didn't even have a political bent that's so much more
[1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:22.400]  expressive you know it's like oh bush is a tyrant but obama is going to save us i like your stuff
[1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:27.360]  because it's across the board well appreciate it yeah i mean that's one of the things years ago
[1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:32.960]  it was over a decade when i went into this it was it was something where it's as simple as me
[1:40:32.960 --> 1:40:37.280]  looking around and not seeing the type of art and this sort of merchandise that i wanted to see
[1:40:37.280 --> 1:40:42.400]  necessarily uh so i decided to to kind of jump in and do it myself you know a lot of there's
[1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:47.040]  a lot of great out art out there um for people from all different perspectives the stuff that i
[1:40:47.040 --> 1:40:52.000]  try to focus on is stuff that you know number one i truly believe and number two stuff that i just
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:57.920]  don't see out there in the art world like uh like right now i've got at the docks uh docks museum of
[1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:03.440]  fine art in in uh in prog actually right now is a show that's running some of my stuff and and i was
[1:41:03.440 --> 1:41:07.520]  kind of going through the catalog of all these posters over the past hundred years it goes from
[1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:13.680]  1914 to 2014 and uh there's there's not a lot that kind of holds the same sort of ideological
[1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:18.480]  perspective as the ones that that i put out there so um i definitely think that there was you know
[1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:23.120]  along with you you have a ton of merchandise out there and stuff uh you know it was it was
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:28.320]  time to sort of uh bring another perspective to the you know that's it i mean what you're doing
[1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:32.240]  is what i've been trying to do uh you know even before you came along and we're doing it with
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:39.200]  some success now no one's just a pro liberty 1776 i want all my freedom now take your labels and
[1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:43.760]  cram them down the toilet right uh look at the police state around us look at everything the
[1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:50.000]  globalists are genius in making rebellion right wing or communist and people teaming up on a fake
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  ideology that's how they control you i definitely think so you know a lot of it is in this whole
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:01.440]  label thing that you bring up is true um it's it's so shallow so much of this stuff is shallow
[1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:05.840]  there's not much thinking behind it and one thing that i wanted to press forward is to sort of you
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:10.320]  know in terms of like this thing that i got in trouble with with the nsa you know simple truths
[1:42:10.320 --> 1:42:15.760]  people are pretty smart generally they they get uh they get some of these jokes they're they're
[1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:20.000]  they're fairly uh questionable when it questioning when it comes to authority and government and
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:25.920]  stuff like that and we tap into that uh with with the site but uh you know there's a lot of
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:30.000]  questions that we live in and remarkable times right now uh so much going on so many questions
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:34.640]  of liberty so many things that that we're dealing with as young people old people and people trying
[1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:40.800]  to uh to sort of fight for our rights and uh it's just a it's it's there's so much material out there
[1:42:40.800 --> 1:42:46.720]  that that people don't use it seems like that in art in in design so um i just try to kind of focus
[1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:51.360]  in my own little way i'm doing that and again you were already reaching a lot of people very
[1:42:51.360 --> 1:42:56.320]  successful they come after you it's all over the news i noticed it wasn't all over the news when
[1:42:56.320 --> 1:43:03.680]  you won your lawsuit tell us about that yeah it was uh you know it for a while i think when we
[1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:07.680]  when we started the case uh and when he started to have these problems and i found out about the
[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:12.400]  cease and desist orders uh people just were having a hard time believing it at the beginning they
[1:43:12.400 --> 1:43:17.120]  thought it was you know they were having a hard time even you know journalists and such uh looking
[1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:22.000]  at it going why is that is that true you know when we finally filed the suit in federal uh in
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:26.640]  federal court then it was you know it was apparent to everyone that that this actually had taken
[1:43:26.640 --> 1:43:32.000]  place and we were taking it seriously uh it's been a little bit different since i won uh i think
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:37.440]  it's one of these things where uh because it was in court and people were aware of it uh the
[1:43:37.440 --> 1:43:43.280]  the information came out and the support uh has been enormous so um yeah it's been interesting
[1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:49.520]  sense uh well no no no listen the media likes it whenever you look like you were in trouble
[1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:54.160]  and so they carried it oh yeah let's censor his speech let's have a chilling effect now that
[1:43:54.160 --> 1:43:58.480]  you beat them they don't want that to be known because that shows it was illegitimate but but
[1:43:58.480 --> 1:44:02.080]  you're also fighting cognitive dissonance that you mentioned people take a double take you mean
[1:44:02.720 --> 1:44:07.600]  the the government's trying to stop parodies of it no that this is america that's not going on
[1:44:07.600 --> 1:44:12.560]  that's why it's important that you resisted so that you then got the pushback and of course you
[1:44:12.560 --> 1:44:17.920]  weren't naive but the public got to see the tyrants were dealing with then you pushed back you want
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:23.840]  see it's a process folks you've got to push so they push back to show people that they're really
[1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:29.200]  tyrants then you can morally defeat them but if we all just go oh we're not in a tyranny
[1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:35.920]  they can then move forward and take over in in that vacuum nature abhors it we have to then take
[1:44:35.920 --> 1:44:40.320]  over the vacuum and they're going to fight us for the vacuum but we have the moral high ground we
[1:44:40.320 --> 1:44:46.640]  will beat them the only way we fail as history has shown is by not resisting the only way tyrants
[1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:53.760]  succeed is when good people do nothing i completely agree i completely agree in in this case it
[1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:58.640]  was one of those things when we finally got to the bottom of what was going on it became so apparent
[1:44:58.640 --> 1:45:04.160]  that uh it was just morally wrong um it was inconsistent with just just about everything
[1:45:04.160 --> 1:45:08.880]  you could possibly think to believe about what this society in this country is supposed to be
[1:45:08.880 --> 1:45:14.320]  about so it was really a kind of a simple choice to resist in this case but yeah i mean the interesting
[1:45:14.320 --> 1:45:18.640]  thing about it now i'm sure you're not surprised or your your listeners are not surprised but you
[1:45:18.640 --> 1:45:24.320]  know i've been emailed and spoken to by so many different people and artists and designers out
[1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:28.800]  there that have really sort of it was actually so much astonishing to me that how many people said
[1:45:28.800 --> 1:45:33.920]  boy man that's i could never do that or i you know boy i'm just gonna kind of wait and see what
[1:45:33.920 --> 1:45:38.400]  happens with with your case and this kind of stuff and i just really it was surprising to me
[1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:44.960]  because the cowardice was surprising well a little bit i guess you know i i i grew up in a way that
[1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:49.200]  this this sort of thing make a question like this and i'm not trying to be i'm not naive about the
[1:45:49.200 --> 1:45:53.920]  consequences that could have happened i guess i hear about that a lot but uh you know i was a
[1:45:53.920 --> 1:45:58.960]  little bit surprised that people were so reticent to sort of take a stand on this now that's contrasted
[1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:03.680]  of course by the amazing support of other people i mean the amount of people that purchased this
[1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:08.080]  shirt looking at the shirts and saying you know what i want to wear that as a as a piece of civil
[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:12.640]  disobedience uh people that sent great emails uh you know letters to the editor all this kind
[1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:17.280]  exactly but it's still shocking in the artist community that they're saying oh i'm worried
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:23.120]  about consequences they better be worried about the consequence of us all self-muscling ourselves
[1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:28.640]  that will ensure a nightmare takeover because there's always corrupt people that want to
[1:46:28.640 --> 1:46:34.080]  take over the vacuum if good people do nothing don't they understand that don't people understand
[1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:41.120]  that that if you give the field to whoever will take it if good people think that being good
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:48.080]  is submitting to the biggest bully what happens yeah it's startling it you know it's startling
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:54.080]  to think that many people do and it's you know it there that's where a little bit of my that
[1:46:54.080 --> 1:46:57.680]  were some of the toughest times when i started to get some of those emails and things from other
[1:46:57.680 --> 1:47:02.480]  designers artists because in a big way i think that's you know if you're taking your art seriously
[1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:06.240]  and things like that yeah you're you're really challenging sort of the world you're you're
[1:47:06.240 --> 1:47:12.080]  pressing upon the world uh your sort of views and things and mixing yourself with the world
[1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:16.720]  and and pushing back on things so you know you know art and design and all these things are
[1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:21.200]  all sort of a subjective thing but i think it's really important to sort of uh to to put your
[1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:26.400]  stamp on the world and and something like this absolutely and just like shepherd fairy has had
[1:47:26.400 --> 1:47:30.720]  so many people kind of be influenced by him the greatest form of flattery is imitation
[1:47:30.720 --> 1:47:37.760]  or augmentation i see artwork and your artwork uh and and and others being mirrored now and
[1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:43.440]  picked up by others and they're changing it and making it better or or or or different this is
[1:47:43.440 --> 1:47:48.880]  the essence of renaissance the essence of true influence and how do you defeat tyrants you make
[1:47:48.880 --> 1:47:54.560]  art yeah you make art you you know one of my favorite things which i can show you the poster
[1:47:54.560 --> 1:47:59.680]  you know it's it's by uh by mark twain it says the reverence is the champion of liberty and it's
[1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:04.960]  only defense and part of that a reverence part of that beauty in life is to create and to create and
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:09.120]  to challenge the world around you and to build the world around you and art is a huge part of that
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:13.200]  and i think it's uh it's an amazing part of there's so much going on in terms of the patriot
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:18.800]  movements and in terms of liberty and everything at that but i i love to see that art is starting
[1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:25.760]  to take its place uh in dealing with uh you know freedom and liberty so well damn michael i i've

[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:36.240]  people being on their system their search engines don't block you so we were trying and and we had
[1:49:36.240 --> 1:49:40.000]  a shopping cart as we're selling stuff we put it up there and they said this is racist because
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:43.120]  you criticize obama and and they took our shopping cart away and that was in the news
[1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:48.960]  and we've had other stuff taken from us and uh you know we we didn't get around to suing
[1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:54.400]  because we're so busy uh but this guy did more glad he sued one but he had his website a shopping
[1:49:54.400 --> 1:49:59.520]  cart taken down because the government threatened his shopping cart and he responded i mean that's
[1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:07.520]  why you had to sue and this is the embargoes nazi germany in 33 34 35 36 37 before they arrested

[1:55:29.920 --> 1:55:34.480]  mark you're on the air thanks for holding uh hi alec study hit me just fine yes sir
[1:55:35.840 --> 1:55:41.680]  okay well first of all i just said i am an american citizen and i do own a uh big scary assault weapon
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:48.080]  and it hasn't yet to kill anybody um well they just had 33 killed in china by guys with knives i mean
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:52.720]  shouldn't we ban knives because they come out of their their blocks at night and sneak out and hurt
[1:55:52.720 --> 1:56:00.560]  people uh well i think guns are scarier though i agree they i think i think guns just look scarier
[1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:04.800]  and so we we need to get rid of scary but not in the hands of men in black uniforms in the government
[1:56:05.680 --> 1:56:10.000]  that is not scary it's such a government who can you trust i agree
[1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:16.400]  man i like to make three points about gun control um you know first i want to say uh
[1:56:16.400 --> 1:56:20.960]  you know that the clearly the error with gun control uh second what we can do about it and
[1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:24.080]  third what i am going to do about it but i want to be clear there yeah i'm gonna let you say this
[1:56:24.080 --> 1:56:28.320]  but there is not an and i know it's an error for the general public but the establishment wants
[1:56:28.320 --> 1:56:34.080]  disarm slaves monopoly a force and they don't mince words in their own un unit air documents and
[1:56:34.080 --> 1:56:38.720]  things about that they want to be the only ones with guns for total control it's not they know
[1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:43.680]  more guns means less crime go ahead well so that's uh that's what happened in world war two whenever
[1:56:43.680 --> 1:56:48.720]  the japanese wanted to invade it i don't remember who said it uh was a japanese commander who said
[1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:52.800]  uh if you invade america there'd be a rifle behind uh every blade of grass yeah i think that was
[1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:57.280]  admiral yamamoto and that's what our own government is afraid of and they should be afraid they should
[1:56:57.280 --> 1:57:03.680]  be afraid of their people um now what uh what the first problem with uh gun control is that we can
[1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:07.840]  we can regulate that state by state if there's a federal law that regulates guns we can override
[1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:12.960]  or nullify that within our state i agree and that's why the feds get on the news and say
[1:57:12.960 --> 1:57:19.120]  there is no states rights states don't exist and obama care lowers your cost and alex is not on
[1:57:19.120 --> 1:57:26.320]  the radio and there's no drones and uh and will clinton have sex with that woman is because they
[1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:30.800]  know they're completely illegitimate what they're doing hey five years ago the supreme court said
[1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:36.880]  chicago dc and in new york had to let folks have guns hasn't happened because they're lawless
[1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:42.640]  crooks running those cities well uh there's plenty of states that are waking up and actually
[1:57:42.640 --> 1:57:48.160]  nullifying and overturning uh uh laws past present and future uh in texas of course they're
[1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:51.760]  going to nullify laws after a certain date in some states uh they're going to nullify all
[1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:57.200]  laws that violate that uh that right uh past president no i know liberty is rising it's a
[1:57:57.200 --> 1:58:01.760]  beautiful thing that's why all the kleptocrats and statists are running around like have you
[1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:05.120]  ever sprayed cockroaches and like i've done exterminating a little bit here in there
[1:58:05.120 --> 1:58:08.000]  and you go into some horrible house there's like all these cockroaches behind the wall
[1:58:08.560 --> 1:58:12.320]  and you spray them and they run around all wild as they dive with the poison that's what's happening
[1:58:13.760 --> 1:58:17.040]  right they're they're running around with their heads cut off um you know where they live though
[1:58:17.040 --> 1:58:24.000]  they all run to hillary and upper leg and then right into there that's where i think i mean i mean
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:29.920]  i mean under under her dress they live in her dress i'm sorry and then and then they roast in
[1:58:29.920 --> 1:58:36.560]  there and turn to new to nutella and it makes i'm sorry caller i gotta go good point just absolutely

[1:59:00.880 --> 1:59:05.040]  apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlington's willing to

[1:59:55.920 --> 2:00:10.720]  alex jones on the gcm radio network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want
[2:00:10.720 --> 2:00:21.280]  answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[2:00:21.280 --> 2:00:30.320]  jones you know i shouldn't get into kitty humor sometimes saying that uh he spray roaches with
[2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:35.360]  poisons and they all run around crazily they actually start breeding they start fornicating
[2:00:35.360 --> 2:00:39.040]  which is a good instinct to try to reproduce before they die i made the joke they actually all
[2:00:39.040 --> 2:00:45.200]  run up hillary skirt back home where they were born from but actually it's true and i want msnbc
[2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:50.480]  to pick this up i actually believe this because if rachel madow can say that i believe giant wasp
[2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:55.040]  or under the unbuilding running things i never really said that but if she said it she controls
[2:00:55.040 --> 2:01:00.880]  reality she's history's actor as carl robes said it's true so if this is an extreme i i can say
[2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:05.360]  this doesn't think about roaches so here it is that conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all
[2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:11.040]  conspiracy theories that can set seduce republicans it's an internet talk show called info wars
[2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:16.080]  yes this is the same guy who has been selling the idea that the massacre at sandy hook elementary
[2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:21.200]  school in the massacre at aurora colorado were actually fake they were faked as an excuse to
[2:01:21.200 --> 2:01:27.360]  take away our guns and enslave us for the giant wasps who hide beneath the unbuilding or whatever
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:35.440]  no no no no no no no no a i didn't say it was all staged it was clearly scripting the response to it
[2:01:35.440 --> 2:01:39.440]  undoubtedly something weird was going on there i didn't say the whole thing was fake other people
[2:01:39.440 --> 2:01:44.000]  said that because of all the green screening and stuff that they got caught in the actors and they
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:48.080]  did get caught staging it i don't know what they're covering up but there's something just something
[2:01:48.080 --> 2:01:54.320]  being staged i don't know what they're hiding but they're hiding stuff that's simple criminology
[2:01:54.320 --> 2:01:59.520]  hands down very suspicious they're covering something up you could get a warrant and they're
[2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:04.400]  blocking the release of everything and bulldoze the building and the names don't match up but let
[2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:08.480]  me get serious here for a minute folks it's not giant wasps that live under the unbuilding
[2:02:09.600 --> 2:02:15.520]  it's roaches and the thing about it is is that hillary clinton and this is serious high-level
[2:02:15.520 --> 2:02:24.400]  intel hillary clinton is actually the mother of all roaches and she secretes giant bubbling cysts
[2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:30.320]  that themselves are then mother roaches that go out under government facilities and then give birth
[2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:36.480]  through all other species of bedbugs roaches and government bureaucrats they were all born out of
[2:02:36.480 --> 2:02:44.320]  hillary's lower intestine and colon so i want to be serious here folks hillary clinton is actually
[2:02:44.320 --> 2:02:49.920]  a space alien from a distant starbase who has been here for 18 trillion years and who is a
[2:02:49.920 --> 2:02:58.080]  species of roach and all roaches yes it's true come from her colon so i i mean if rachel madhouse
[2:02:58.080 --> 2:03:03.680]  says i believe giant wasp are under the capital i mean come on folks we know that's not true okay
[2:03:05.200 --> 2:03:11.200]  exactly the the wasp aliens are actually good guys that were actually centered by me
[2:03:11.200 --> 2:03:18.160]  me and and and bill hicks and and and and we we and i'm actually kevin spacey really want to get
[2:03:18.160 --> 2:03:23.280]  down the truth is they keep saying i'm bill x i'm kevin spacey i'm the host of house of cards
[2:03:24.160 --> 2:03:28.880]  you understand that okay before msnbc and new york times grab that they know i'm joking that was
[2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:34.480]  all satire ladies and gentlemen and and if you're not an inside baseball person that follows all
[2:03:34.480 --> 2:03:39.360]  the crazy conspiracy theories you don't know what i'm talking about but people really believe i'm bill
[2:03:39.360 --> 2:03:43.840]  hicks and jeff ridges and so i don't like that i mean bill hicks was a funny guy but i didn't
[2:03:43.840 --> 2:03:47.840]  agree with all his politics and jeff ridges is okay but you know he was like a big actor before
[2:03:47.840 --> 2:03:51.760]  i was born and i don't like being people comparing me to an 80 year old person it's pretty uncool i'm
[2:03:51.760 --> 2:03:57.280]  not i don't look that old okay i'm 40 and i want to expand on that i am kevin spacey
[2:03:58.640 --> 2:04:01.840]  and i mean i when i'm really in good shape i look a little bit more like russel crow with
[2:04:01.840 --> 2:04:07.760]  facial hair so i'm russel crow too okay even though i'm not if you guys are going to say i'm
[2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:15.680]  really a fake actor can you get somebody cooler the truth is i'm a cross clone raised in hillary's
[2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:25.520]  colon uh with the roaches a clone of kevin spacey and of uh russel crow mixed in with
[2:04:25.520 --> 2:04:42.160]  stave puff marshmallow man and john wane uh john wane's grandson see what's funny is those are
[2:04:42.160 --> 2:04:48.480]  cooler conspiracy theories that will now be believed by the schizophrenics out there and
[2:04:48.480 --> 2:04:51.680]  they'll pick it up it's gonna be a whole new entertainment the truth is on my big screen
[2:04:51.680 --> 2:04:56.640]  tv i do actually watch that stuff and i'm wanting to kind of script what the schizophrenics do now

[2:09:29.440 --> 2:09:35.600]  let's go to your calls dewayne in arizona you're on the air go ahead thank you nice to talk to you
[2:09:35.600 --> 2:09:40.960]  alex uh i really appreciate your show you know uh my people perish for a lack of knowledge it's
[2:09:40.960 --> 2:09:46.000]  important to get this information out it's vitally important however uh what i'd like to say is this
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  you know uh they've been putting this thing together for quite some time you know bullying
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:55.760]  protesters buying up millions of bullets the famous camps all this now that's doing connecticut
[2:09:55.760 --> 2:10:00.000]  if we don't get to a point where we say we're not going to allow you to take our guns then
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:04.480]  they can then it's going to be over and someday they're going to say well the station's over too
[2:10:04.480 --> 2:10:08.000]  uh there's some point we're talking's not enough we just got to say no we're not going to let you
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:13.200]  happen stand up for our neighbors when they come to take them the other question i have for you is
[2:10:13.200 --> 2:10:18.560]  this i could be wrong but i remember quite some time ago when i read the constitution the second
[2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:23.200]  amendment it listed our right to keep and bear arms and it shall not be infringed that word
[2:10:23.200 --> 2:10:28.080]  and fringe is very important but it also i believe said that the uh these rights were
[2:10:28.080 --> 2:10:34.960]  regulated by the states well the last uh pocket constitutions and things of the other copies of
[2:10:34.960 --> 2:10:40.160]  it that i've got it's not it doesn't have that part where it says it's regulated by the states
[2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:47.360]  am i crazy or is this correct i'm going to have to look into that but they have now been ruling
[2:10:47.360 --> 2:10:54.160]  in federal courts that the states have tried to ban guns and so the feds have come in and said no
[2:10:54.160 --> 2:10:58.320]  you can't but then they don't enforce it when the state's still ban them but then now other states
[2:10:58.320 --> 2:11:02.320]  are trying to pass pro-gun laws and the feds are coming in trying to nullify those as well
[2:11:03.360 --> 2:11:08.800]  but you know that is a states right enshrined in the bill of rights via the federal government
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:13.440]  and should not be in friends either way but that's an interesting legal point look i told
[2:11:13.440 --> 2:11:18.960]  pierce morgan i said listen 1776 is going to start up again commence again if you try to
[2:11:18.960 --> 2:11:25.280]  take the guns it's going to happen so stop trying it and uh they are desperately trying to finally
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:29.360]  subdue this country and that's one of the final things they've got to do but time's running out
[2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:34.400]  for them that they're in control now but not in full control and the longer they're not in control
[2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:39.200]  the more they're going to get blamed for the economic downfall that every major economic
[2:11:39.200 --> 2:11:47.360]  expert i mean here's cnbc get ready for the dow it's 6000 by 2016 and that's a drop of two-thirds
[2:11:48.640 --> 2:11:54.640]  or almost two-thirds this is a big deal and there's mathematically no way to get out of it and they
[2:11:54.640 --> 2:12:00.640]  just hope we're all disarmed when it happens because then we'll be able to take our government back
[2:12:00.640 --> 2:12:05.440]  they want to be able to come out and oppress us and just keep the fraud rolling but we have the
[2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:14.960]  second amendment laid down as a literal eizen guardian or uh what do they call it in for the
[2:12:16.240 --> 2:12:22.400]  as guardian it's like an as guardian guardian guarding the republic that only activates
[2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:26.880]  you try to get rid of the first amendment the fourth the tenth the ninth the second amendment
[2:12:27.440 --> 2:12:32.400]  activates like the big guardian and starts blasting hot fire onto whoever's trying to
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:39.520]  steal the jewel of liberty and so it sits there like a frozen time bomb a sentry and all of us
[2:12:39.520 --> 2:12:45.440]  enable it and we don't want to use that we want to use the voting box the ballot box the grand jury
[2:12:45.440 --> 2:12:54.400]  box and the soap box the electronic soap box uh the civil disobedience box our voice box we need
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:59.360]  to use our computers everything to resist the tyranny to expose it to undermine it because
[2:12:59.360 --> 2:13:04.320]  it's illegitimate we are the immune system but i mean if they start trying to blow stuff
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:08.960]  blow stuff up and blame it on us and try purge we don't have a choice but to defend ourselves
[2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:14.240]  uh i just feel sorry for the military and police because the globalists intend for them to be wiped
[2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:18.560]  out coming after us and it's pointless even though it'll be self-defense to mow them down
[2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:24.080]  the globalists plan on us killing each other we've got to get the word out so somehow people
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:29.440]  know what's going on the general public the security services as they're called so that we don't
[2:13:29.440 --> 2:13:34.240]  play into this diabolical program it's like in one of the james bond movies it starts i forget
[2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:42.720]  which one i've been james bond movie with fighting fish with beta fish uh chinese fighting fish and
[2:13:42.720 --> 2:13:47.040]  that'll tell and they're on some yacht i think it's from russia with love or something i can't
[2:13:47.040 --> 2:13:52.560]  remember and they're sitting there showing the fish bowl the two compartments had three compartments
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:57.360]  but two of them they open one let the two fish almost kill each other and then one's all damaged
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:04.800]  and hurt then you open the other one and they let the big one come in and kill the uh one is from
[2:14:04.800 --> 2:14:09.120]  russia with love see if you can find i bet it's on youtube because i bet i'm getting the story
[2:14:09.120 --> 2:14:15.760]  wrong i've only seen it like 20 years ago uh from russia with love fish scene and i bet money that's
[2:14:15.760 --> 2:14:23.920]  on youtube and he says you see i have them kill each other and then we have to do nothing sasha and
[2:14:23.920 --> 2:14:29.280]  that's what's going on and we don't want to be part of that god bless you appreciate your call
[2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:38.880]  let's go ahead and talk to gabe in north carolina you're on the air greetings elix hey buddy um i
[2:14:38.880 --> 2:14:46.160]  just have to say the things that your analysis of what's going on in the ukraine is pretty spot on um i
[2:14:46.160 --> 2:14:53.680]  just can't get over the fact of how people like the tv pundits and uh the politicians and and
[2:14:53.680 --> 2:15:00.960]  nato like just how they speak about um you know how we have to have action against them and uh and
[2:15:00.960 --> 2:15:06.320]  pootin is uh you know acting rashly i'm like if we flipped around and we were in their shoes and
[2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:12.880]  this you know america or say canada was in uh was overthrown in america we would pop right in there
[2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:19.120]  and we'd be doing the same thing exactly and look it's it's it's not like american governments even
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:23.760]  doing this and trying to put a good government in that would still be illegitimate unless it was
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:31.600]  like north korea then you gotta have a responsibility to do something this is an elected government
[2:15:31.600 --> 2:15:35.920]  that's not even really oppressing people on a scale of one to ten like a two our government's
[2:15:35.920 --> 2:15:42.080]  about like a three or four trying to be a ten and then they're trying to overthrow the whole
[2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:47.360]  country and then russia just takes its military bases and protects its area on its border and the
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:56.400]  media acts like you know that we need a newt russia or something i mean uh you know obama drawing
[2:15:56.400 --> 2:16:02.240]  you know semi drawing his red line again i mean pootin knows that uh you know nato we know we're
[2:16:02.240 --> 2:16:09.520]  militarily exhausted he knows all those spirits are paper tiger i agree with you i agree with you i
[2:16:09.520 --> 2:16:14.480]  mean it and again it's not that america or nato are even bad it's that the criminals running it are
[2:16:14.480 --> 2:16:20.800]  bad the people that have hijacked our infrastructure are very very bad and no one can deny that they
[2:16:20.800 --> 2:16:26.960]  are prosecuting a war against due process liberty and the free market while claiming the moral high
[2:16:26.960 --> 2:16:34.000]  ground great points gave i'm gonna go to colin and captain america jason and johnny here uh in just
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:38.560]  a moment finally somebody called in about my subject of democrats race baiting wow about to
[2:16:38.560 --> 2:16:42.720]  have a heart attack kiss my hand i can't believe somebody actually called in on the subject i
[2:16:42.720 --> 2:16:48.880]  threw out wanted to get your take on thank you 800 2599231 first time callers but i think they
[2:16:48.880 --> 2:16:54.720]  did find the clip from russia to love where they describe how you have your two enemies kill or
[2:16:54.720 --> 2:16:59.200]  hurt each other and then you stroll in and take over and the globalists are above the countries
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:05.440]  playing us off against each other getting power out of the chaos and imposing as the savior
[2:17:05.440 --> 2:17:12.240]  it's elementary most war is not one side against the other one side's good the other side's bad
[2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:17.520]  usually both sides have issues but if you're on one side being attacked you've got to defend yourself
[2:17:19.040 --> 2:17:24.080]  it generally is whoever attacks first is the bad guy in jurist prudence common sense everybody
[2:17:24.080 --> 2:17:34.480]  knows that and it's beyond that now where they just go yeah here russia attacked ukraine for no
[2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:38.960]  reason yeah they invaded georgia and then it turned out in the case of georgia the west really
[2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:44.000]  didn't start that hands down we were in the wrong but it's not us the establishment had done that

[2:33:31.680 --> 2:33:37.440]  try to understand what's happening out there what's going on and the democratic party in this
[2:33:37.440 --> 2:33:43.120]  country is now the cutting edge of the societal takeover for the offshore corporations and banks
[2:33:43.120 --> 2:33:48.000]  to make the general public dependent and they're trying to censor free speech

[2:34:23.200 --> 2:34:30.800]  it equals whatever they say and in 1984 when o'brien is torturing winston the ministry of truth
[2:34:32.240 --> 2:34:36.320]  let me give you a newsflash they didn't tell the truth and he's there at the ministry of love
[2:34:36.320 --> 2:34:41.920]  where they torture you to death he says okay do you want me to see five fingers 10 20 and
[2:34:41.920 --> 2:34:47.760]  suddenly he just sees hundreds of fingers he can't even tell he goes now you're cured now you don't
[2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:53.280]  know anything you believe whatever i tell you and they stopped the torture get him healed
[2:34:54.080 --> 2:35:00.400]  take him to the chestnut cafe give him synthetic crap jen tell him it's real jen synthetic crud
[2:35:00.400 --> 2:35:08.960]  shavings off the floor you know cigarettes tell them it's cigarettes and he sits there on the
[2:35:08.960 --> 2:35:13.920]  telescreen watching even though he just written the propaganda a month before they tortured him
[2:35:14.800 --> 2:35:18.000]  that they'd never been at war with east asia but suddenly were at war with east asia and
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:22.320]  then they were in africa and being defeated but big brother had a genius plan and defeated them
[2:35:22.320 --> 2:35:28.240]  and winston sits there remembering that he'd even written it and he knew it was all a lie there was
[2:35:28.240 --> 2:35:33.520]  no war in africa but he didn't care it was all real he loved big brother and he cried and they took
[2:35:33.520 --> 2:35:36.800]  him out back and blew his head off threw him in an incinerator and pumped him out into the
[2:35:36.800 --> 2:35:43.360]  atmosphere he'll never existed it's beautiful he thanked them he wanted to die he loved big
[2:35:43.360 --> 2:35:50.080]  brother two plus two equaled whatever obama said two plus two equaled a trillion it equaled ten
[2:35:50.080 --> 2:35:53.840]  it equaled 500 it equaled four it equaled three it equaled two it equaled nothing
[2:35:53.840 --> 2:36:01.040]  didn't matter of obama care double triple prices didn't matter didn't matter they put cancer viruses
[2:36:01.040 --> 2:36:07.680]  in your vaccine didn't matter that matter of the democratic party was the kuklux klan is the kuklux
[2:36:07.680 --> 2:36:16.160]  klan yeah you got a big arrogant sociopath the narcissist schultz sits up there on tv and says
[2:36:16.160 --> 2:36:21.120]  they never were connected to it and i'm insane doesn't matter if i'm right doesn't matter what
[2:36:21.120 --> 2:36:27.440]  i'm telling you is an informed fact ed schultz controls reality of course the truth is he's
[2:36:27.440 --> 2:36:34.480]  got a couple hundred thousand viewers he doesn't control reality so what are you guys gonna do
[2:36:35.040 --> 2:36:39.600]  as the final domino falls that you don't control reality what you're gonna do about that
[2:36:44.880 --> 2:36:48.160]  well you better put your head down between your legs and kiss your fat butt goodbye
[2:36:48.160 --> 2:36:54.400]  politically which i don't take any pleasure out of if my dog craps on the rug
[2:36:55.040 --> 2:36:58.400]  do you think i take pleasure scooping the crap up and putting it in a trash bag
[2:36:59.520 --> 2:37:04.320]  no it's a dirty chore looking at you listening to your lies and how pathetic and weak and
[2:37:04.320 --> 2:37:12.800]  dishonorable you are i'm not your enemy you are literal dog crap to be cleaned off my shoes ed
[2:37:12.800 --> 2:37:23.920]  schultz racial madow you are a disease you are dishonorable you are degenerate politically
[2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:33.280]  and you prey on a poisoned psychotronic positronically brain damaged public that's in a dream state oh
[2:37:33.280 --> 2:37:44.000]  man you're really manly you are cancer
[2:37:48.080 --> 2:38:02.800]  bloated old big city politics worn dog-eared stained smelly playbook of the same
[2:38:02.800 --> 2:38:09.440]  hired mindless lies that you guys formulaically sit there and run over and over again giving
[2:38:09.440 --> 2:38:14.160]  yourselves high fives telling you the public wants the same baloney over and over again
[2:38:14.160 --> 2:38:17.440]  now the public is not the same baloney over and over again the public wants outside the
[2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:22.560]  box the public wants freedom the public wants the future the public wants renaissance
[2:38:22.560 --> 2:38:30.220]  the public wants enlightenment the public wants empowerment the public
[2:38:30.220 --> 2:38:38.760]  wants freedom the public wants to explore trailblaze invent and the public
[2:38:38.760 --> 2:38:44.880]  wants to fight and have war and to challenge and to see who really is the
[2:38:44.880 --> 2:38:50.920]  greatest and so you organize war for us don't you your fake sports games and
[2:38:50.920 --> 2:38:54.600]  your simulated war and your your war on little third-world countries and all
[2:38:54.600 --> 2:38:58.000]  the rest of us we have rituals of manhood only for a specialized class
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:05.800]  before the robots replace them you people are anti-human you people should walk
[2:39:05.800 --> 2:39:12.320]  the plank politically you people have just decided the whole future human
[2:39:12.320 --> 2:39:18.880]  course off some 170 year old 165 year old eugenics plan developed by a bunch
[2:39:18.880 --> 2:39:23.720]  of syphilitic British Royals and just because you're in control you think you
[2:39:23.720 --> 2:39:29.200]  must be geniuses no cancer can get control as I've said a thousand times of
[2:39:29.200 --> 2:39:34.360]  a body can run through it and take over but you kill the experience you end the
[2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:45.160]  game you end the host stupid stupid you are in a symbiotic organism that's what
[2:39:45.160 --> 2:39:49.320]  humanity is individuals that connect into a greater group you should know
[2:39:49.320 --> 2:39:52.400]  that you claim you're collectivist but you're not true collectivist you're a
[2:39:52.400 --> 2:39:57.080]  cancer eating the collective that's based on the individual vigor of the
[2:39:57.080 --> 2:40:04.800]  cells and you you are a cancer you want to have that little epiphany for yourself
[2:40:04.800 --> 2:40:08.480]  you think you're in there and you're in charge and people know who you are and
[2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:12.640]  we feel official and get to walk around your little TV screen everybody looks
[2:40:12.640 --> 2:40:16.040]  at you and you feel real big and you have these political enemies you're
[2:40:16.040 --> 2:40:21.760]  fighting with and when you and your family if this program goes through look
[2:40:21.760 --> 2:40:32.360]  at your grandkids Schultz look at your family Maddow look at them and kiss them
[2:40:32.360 --> 2:40:37.440]  goodbye kiss them goodbye when the system goes into place and you think well I
[2:40:37.440 --> 2:40:41.560]  don't a lot of that's true what he's saying but you know I need to go along
[2:40:41.560 --> 2:40:45.080]  with the system to protect my family because that's how I'll be safe no
[2:40:45.080 --> 2:40:48.800]  that's not how you're gonna be safe you're gonna be safe standing up not
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:52.560]  looking at all the angles not calculating what you think but saying the
[2:40:52.560 --> 2:40:57.320]  right thing to do is to pull double short swords and start attacking and
[2:40:57.320 --> 2:41:04.360]  stabbing the new world order that's the answer the answer to 1984 is 1776 the
[2:41:04.360 --> 2:41:08.920]  answer is to not think about the fight but to win the fight and decide you're
[2:41:08.920 --> 2:41:12.280]  gonna stomp the enemy into the ground politically the answer is to realize we
[2:41:12.280 --> 2:41:15.600]  have a bankrupt political system with the Republican and Democratic leadership
[2:41:15.600 --> 2:41:21.160]  hopeful that they can try to suppress the population that's not gonna work
[2:41:21.160 --> 2:41:31.440]  sitting on top of a giant tinderbox and hopelessly disconnected from reality
[2:41:31.440 --> 2:41:44.200]  that's what's going on hopelessly disconnected from reality I am not
[2:41:44.200 --> 2:41:47.600]  disconnected from reality ladies and gentlemen I'm just an average guy that's
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:50.600]  red-blooded wants to live me free I'm going to your calls and special reports
[2:41:50.600 --> 2:41:58.480]  in a moment but I know common sense and I know survival and I know how to be
[2:41:58.480 --> 2:42:02.200]  successful in life other people I know how to be successful in negotiations I
[2:42:02.200 --> 2:42:07.200]  know how to be successful with men with women with children I know how to be
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:10.800]  successful in a physical confrontation and have been I've been successful in
[2:42:10.800 --> 2:42:14.400]  art in literature and in changing culture I am a success
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:19.320]  organically I know how to fix things and by the way a plumber out there knows
[2:42:19.320 --> 2:42:22.280]  how to fix things and an auto mechanic knows how to fix things and a farmer
[2:42:22.280 --> 2:42:25.840]  knows how to fix things and a mother stay at home mom or stay at home dad they
[2:42:25.840 --> 2:42:30.000]  know how to fix things we are the people that make this country run we are
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:35.040]  good and we don't want to be programmed by you we want our hopes and dreams to
[2:42:35.040 --> 2:42:39.040]  float out into the great collective and to be judged by everyone else in free
[2:42:39.040 --> 2:42:44.040]  association and may the best rise to the top so that we build a stairway to
[2:42:44.040 --> 2:42:53.400]  heaven together not what you are building you're building an express
[2:42:53.400 --> 2:42:58.680]  elevator to hell by every historical metric we know where we're going no one
[2:42:58.680 --> 2:43:05.480]  can deny that it's incontrovertible I'm not speak to MSNBC I'm just speaking
[2:43:05.480 --> 2:43:09.840]  into the ether without as an example of the fake progressive liberal movement
[2:43:09.840 --> 2:43:18.040]  that is the vanguard metastasizing thing that is shown up in our polar
[2:43:18.040 --> 2:43:25.400]  base here that's eating everyone and I just I'm telling you you've got any
[2:43:25.400 --> 2:43:29.440]  humanity left I guess you were chosen because you're empty and vapid that you
[2:43:29.440 --> 2:43:35.920]  got to turn back and the same thing for the Fox News people CNN CNBC all of you
[2:43:35.920 --> 2:43:41.640]  we're on the road to ruin here and that that's not a great rocket scientist
[2:43:41.640 --> 2:43:46.520]  announcement that's known by every quarter there is the difference is your
[2:43:46.520 --> 2:43:51.640]  answer is to collectivize and to wreck everything because your instinct is to
[2:43:51.640 --> 2:43:55.040]  be greedy and dominate everyone so you've created this weird it's in a 21
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:44:00.720]  cosmology where it's some type of new economic system it's not new it's called
[2:44:00.720 --> 2:44:09.680]  feudalism jackass and your own elites at the club of Rome call it feudalism they
[2:44:09.680 --> 2:44:17.320]  call it new feudalism neo feudalism I call it neo feudalistic serfdom or
[2:44:17.320 --> 2:44:24.960]  neo feudalistic fascism by every metric it is it it is the thing not my opinion
[2:44:24.960 --> 2:44:33.040]  fact you're a disease you are poverty you are corruption you are the
[2:44:33.040 --> 2:44:37.760]  shuttering of competition you are the opposite of a Renaissance you are a
[2:44:37.760 --> 2:44:48.720]  disaster zone you are a dark age you are an unholy unworthy fraud of arrogant
[2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:54.280]  narcissists like the mayor of Austin Lee laughing well we've had scientists
[2:44:54.280 --> 2:44:57.760]  doctors Harvard scientists you name it with the reports the science the
[2:44:57.760 --> 2:45:03.040]  lowering IQs the bone cancer we're gonna go to his bounce report a moment and we
[2:45:03.040 --> 2:45:05.680]  go in there and they vote unanimously about millions of dollars of more
[2:45:05.680 --> 2:45:09.240]  hydrofluorosalic acid to put in the water we have insider whistleblowers one
[2:45:09.240 --> 2:45:14.080]  whiff of it you're dead the public's drinking it and laughing well you're
[2:45:14.080 --> 2:45:16.360]  after we go to the left side say laughing well they're taking it out in
[2:45:16.360 --> 2:45:19.520]  cities all over the US and Canada and Europe we're winning everywhere and let
[2:45:19.520 --> 2:45:23.240]  me tell you laughing well one day you will be defeated on this issue as well
[2:45:23.240 --> 2:45:27.920]  but this is an example to the world of their wall of hubris so people feel
[2:45:27.920 --> 2:45:32.480]  weak here is John bounds report on trying to get fluoride out of Austin just
[2:45:32.480 --> 2:45:37.920]  just for your information it is a criminal the offense to disrupt a public
[2:45:37.920 --> 2:45:42.840]  meeting if you persist in that kind of behavior you can potentially be charged
[2:45:42.840 --> 2:45:46.480]  with that criminal offense it'll let you I'm going to let you know love to shut
[2:45:46.480 --> 2:45:49.760]  free speech down we're going with our discussion there's a motion on the table
[2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:56.960]  I want to say following a council member Spelman's every we have listened to
[2:45:56.960 --> 2:46:01.120]  evidence on this subject for several years now to keep hearing it to punk
[2:46:01.120 --> 2:46:06.640]  several years five I'll accept five like like Reuters we have gone to the
[2:46:06.640 --> 2:46:11.720]  trouble like Harvard item to a council committee and received testimony from
[2:46:11.720 --> 2:46:14.920]  our health department here at the city which is totally federally run from
[2:46:14.920 --> 2:46:19.160]  other experts I even asked my dentist and the billion dollar lobbying was
[2:46:19.160 --> 2:46:23.520]  unequivocal yes fluoride in the water the American Dental Association says
[2:46:23.520 --> 2:46:26.600]  none for kids something that we should continue really my dad's a dentist he
[2:46:26.600 --> 2:46:30.240]  says don't do it heard no scientific evidence to the contrary I'll support
[2:46:30.240 --> 2:46:34.360]  the motion that's a lie once again City Council had no qualms about issuing
[2:46:34.360 --> 2:46:38.840]  another four-year round of toxic chemicals into the Austin Texas water
[2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:45.360]  supply hydrofluoresic acid has shown to have those symptoms arthritis I'm 23
[2:46:45.360 --> 2:46:49.440]  years old I shouldn't have signs of arthritis it's corrosive to the skin
[2:46:49.440 --> 2:46:55.400]  eyes and mucus in brains through direct contact inhalation or ingestion Dr.
[2:46:55.400 --> 2:47:00.520]  Philip grand gene at the Harvard School of Public Health and Dr. Philip Landrigan
[2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:05.720]  a pediatrician at the Mount Sinai Medical School in New York City commented
[2:47:05.720 --> 2:47:11.360]  the developing human brain is uniquely vulnerable to toxic chemical
[2:47:11.360 --> 2:47:16.320]  exposures and major windows of developmental vulnerability occur in
[2:47:16.320 --> 2:47:21.120]  utero and during infancy and early childhood chemical weapon is not well
[2:47:21.120 --> 2:47:25.520]  protected against industrial chemical chemical weapon placenta does not block
[2:47:25.520 --> 2:47:29.000]  the passage of environmental even time magazine just came out on the second floor
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:33.120]  right after me that field on screen and more than 200 one about brain damage from
[2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:37.880]  chemicals have been detected in umbilical cord blood they conclude
[2:47:37.880 --> 2:47:43.160]  disorders of neuro behavioral development affect 10 to 15 percent of
[2:47:43.160 --> 2:47:49.600]  all births and prevalence of autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit
[2:47:49.600 --> 2:47:52.960]  disorder that's Harvard's other way increasing worldwide we're telling you
[2:47:52.960 --> 2:47:57.000]  the truth it's not like the facts are made up it's like this is a toxic chemical
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:00.160]  it's not necessary in our water and we're spending two million dollars on
[2:48:00.160 --> 2:48:04.120]  this force medication water all the research I've done it's not good for us
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:09.160]  regardless of those voices that were cut in half by Mayor Lee Leffingwell in
[2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:16.160]  violation of articles 2527 and 2529 of the Austin City Code it's it's within
[2:48:16.160 --> 2:48:21.320]  our authority to limit testimony to any amount that we would choose so I'll
[2:48:21.320 --> 2:48:28.440]  entertain a suggestion a unanimous vote awarded Florida based mosaic LLC up to
[2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:32.840]  two million two hundred ninety thousand nine hundred of taxpayer dollars to
[2:48:32.840 --> 2:48:38.720]  essentially poison themselves listen control yeah I need to speak to somebody
[2:48:38.720 --> 2:48:44.880]  about fluoride should I be concerned about my child or myself swallowing this
[2:48:44.880 --> 2:48:49.960]  if they get more than a mouthful and you know I would want you to call us
[2:48:49.960 --> 2:48:53.400]  otherwise on control only we just recommend to have you know chew up
[2:48:53.400 --> 2:48:57.360]  sometimes or drink a glass of milk because that helps find up the fluoride
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:49:02.640]  okay well I also read that the Environmental Protection Agency the EPA
[2:49:02.640 --> 2:49:08.600]  allows this amount in a single glass of drinking water if my kid drinks more
[2:49:08.600 --> 2:49:13.840]  than one glass of water per day should I call you I wouldn't expect so no
[2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:18.960]  because I've been drinking it makes sense though yeah I know I understand your
[2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:23.440]  logic is perfectly yeah I mean it makes complete sense to me the council members
[2:49:23.440 --> 2:49:28.440]  are not ignorant of the consequences of water fluoridation back in 2011
[2:49:28.440 --> 2:49:34.800]  fluoridation expert dr. Paul Connit and dentist dr. E griffin Cole presented
[2:49:34.800 --> 2:49:40.400]  fact after indisputable fact to the council they cited a review in 1993 and
[2:49:40.400 --> 2:49:45.320]  as you've already seen their proposal that fluoridation was coming at tooth
[2:49:45.320 --> 2:49:47.920]  decay was coming down in the United States because the percentage of the
[2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:51.920]  population drinking fluoridated water was going up was either totally
[2:49:51.920 --> 2:49:55.200]  incompetent meaning they weren't aware of the World Health Organization data
[2:49:55.200 --> 2:49:59.640]  which showed that these declines were going on in nearly every country whether
[2:49:59.640 --> 2:50:04.360]  it was fluoridated or not but in the end the love affair with the aluminum and
[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:12.760]  phosphate mining industries won the day since 1945 69 years later fluoride a
[2:50:12.760 --> 2:50:17.960]  topical medication continues to be ingested by the majority of the United
[2:50:17.960 --> 2:50:22.760]  States of America to educate yourself and your family please visit prison

[2:56:43.040 --> 2:56:49.160]  hello sir I wanted to say something about done
[2:56:49.160 --> 2:56:57.080]  Donbass region and the situation there I think it is played down played down not
[2:56:57.080 --> 2:57:04.520]  only by Ukraine but in Russia also because the people in Donbass region
[2:57:04.520 --> 2:57:15.600]  have elected a new governor not not through election but they have gathered
[2:57:15.600 --> 2:57:22.920]  in a really big crowd and stormed government building and they they're
[2:57:22.920 --> 2:57:30.440]  now taking control of Donbass and the Pavel Gubarov this governor is not
[2:57:30.440 --> 2:57:41.120]  only against you key of nationalists but also against oligarchs that are taking
[2:57:41.120 --> 2:57:46.160]  control of the Eastern region so you're saying you're saying that you think it's
[2:57:46.160 --> 2:57:49.240]  legitimate I mean how do you know if a couple hundred thousand people hit the
[2:57:49.240 --> 2:57:53.240]  streets out of millions that that it then is allowed to overthrow an elective
[2:57:53.240 --> 2:58:03.960]  government well they there are I follow blogs on this mainly in live journal
[2:58:03.960 --> 2:58:14.600]  them the most popular and you can it can probably be checked no that's okay but
[2:58:14.600 --> 2:58:19.160]  you're saying as a Russian or I guess you're gonna you're in Moscow I'm
[2:58:19.160 --> 2:58:26.200]  guessing you're a Russian come at me if I'm wrong you think the new government's
[2:58:26.200 --> 2:58:30.320]  good I think so well I mean I know the Russian back group I've had a lot of
[2:58:30.320 --> 2:58:34.640]  corruption I'm not saying that I just tend to see George Soros climbing around
[2:58:34.640 --> 2:58:38.480]  you know it could be a beautiful cake but if George Soros or rotten possum was
[2:58:38.480 --> 2:58:42.120]  sitting in the middle of it it kind of ruins it you know but maybe possums

[3:08:11.920 --> 3:08:16.000]  info wars dot com right before the main show ended we're in overdrive now and I
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:21.520]  saw it on Salazar's oh my god Texas couple upholds oath the Constitution and
[3:08:21.520 --> 3:08:26.480]  above it Facebook considers new restrictions on gun conversations and I
[3:08:26.480 --> 3:08:29.720]  got a don here saying change the article it's actually hit Daniel's article
[3:08:29.720 --> 3:08:33.240]  I'm gonna go back to calls I was reading it and going over the Democratic
[3:08:33.240 --> 3:08:39.200]  Party type websites were mayors against illegal guns headed up by the
[3:08:39.200 --> 3:08:43.880]  anti-american Bloomberg and the mom's demand action all five of them because
[3:08:43.880 --> 3:08:46.600]  I've actually been out to the events where there's literally two moms and one
[3:08:46.600 --> 3:08:50.080]  dad they start a fight with me in San Antonio we had thousands out open
[3:08:50.080 --> 3:08:55.200]  carrying and so I wanted to get you guys in this is a good headline kit but this
[3:08:55.200 --> 3:09:00.880]  is so sensational it's what was the headline I came up with
[3:09:00.880 --> 3:09:07.320]  Facebook to restrict free speech that was it yeah yeah yeah Bloomberg working
[3:09:07.320 --> 3:09:11.920]  with Facebook Bloomberg Bloomberg moves the headline that we came up with
[3:09:11.920 --> 3:09:21.080]  Bloomberg asked Facebook to restrict pro-gun speech I think that's it or to
[3:09:21.080 --> 3:09:26.600]  restrict for pro-gun First Amendment and then basically social media giant
[3:09:26.600 --> 3:09:34.120]  working with gun grabbers yeah social media giant in talks with anti-gunners
[3:09:34.120 --> 3:09:38.960]  to censor support for Second Amendment that's it this is sensational and it
[3:09:38.960 --> 3:09:42.840]  shows how all these groups have been wanting to go up your free speech we're
[3:09:42.840 --> 3:09:45.680]  you know we're seeing Democrats say arrest people that criticize them all of
[3:09:45.680 --> 3:09:49.360]  this kid what do you make of this well like you mentioned I was with you in
[3:09:49.360 --> 3:09:54.640]  San Antonio during the we crashed that gun control rally which was like you said
[3:09:54.640 --> 3:09:59.040]  only five people and what well the big technical we had our own with 1500 or so
[3:09:59.040 --> 3:10:04.120]  we went down to cover it we're very polite it's on video and then the was it
[3:10:04.120 --> 3:10:07.600]  really five it was like two women and one man and then some guy with a beard
[3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:11.040]  who's thought it was tough I think I've been a little too nice by saying five I
[3:10:11.040 --> 3:10:14.560]  don't exaggerate I think it was three but go ahead but one thing they were
[3:10:14.560 --> 3:10:19.440]  getting international attention yes and one thing I'm with that what you
[3:10:19.440 --> 3:10:22.720]  mentioned with them getting international attention but combined with that what I
[3:10:22.720 --> 3:10:27.720]  noticed there was that these gun control groups they are top down they're not
[3:10:27.720 --> 3:10:33.360]  grassroots ma'am mom's man action marriage against illegal guns these are all
[3:10:33.360 --> 3:10:37.640]  top-down groups I mean these are absolutely none they're all fun of offshore
[3:10:37.640 --> 3:10:40.840]  banks that hijacks the country absolutely these are all this is literally
[3:10:40.840 --> 3:10:44.800]  enemy agents I mean I mean they'll have some useful idiot you know who had a
[3:10:44.800 --> 3:10:48.360]  family member killed by some bad person but instead of blaming the bad person
[3:10:48.360 --> 3:10:53.040]  what if they were in China and got stabbed a band knives want my knife now
[3:10:53.040 --> 3:10:57.400]  exactly don't grab that might get over there it's fine go ahead and just grab
[3:10:57.400 --> 3:11:00.880]  it just pick it up right like this and just talk to the people out there what's
[3:11:00.880 --> 3:11:06.240]  your take on this well it just goes to show that what we've been reporting on
[3:11:06.240 --> 3:11:11.760]  Bloomberg's mayors against illegal guns is actually going after Second
[3:11:11.760 --> 3:11:15.880]  Amendment free speech and the right to bear arms in general that's right the
[3:11:15.880 --> 3:11:19.680]  governor Cuomo said if you're pro gun just get out of the state right these
[3:11:19.680 --> 3:11:27.440]  are thug scumbags that's right will Americans put up with this unfortunately
[3:11:27.440 --> 3:11:31.200]  that seems to be the the case here I think people are putting up with it
[3:11:31.200 --> 3:11:35.440]  that's why they're allowed to go this far with Facebook and restrict what
[3:11:35.440 --> 3:11:39.880]  people post but as the worst that it gets I think more people are waking up to
[3:11:39.880 --> 3:11:46.120]  it I think you're we're seeing a rise of liberty and resistance absolutely well
[3:11:46.120 --> 3:11:50.200]  great job with this report and just I changed the headlining make it more
[3:11:50.200 --> 3:11:55.280]  hardcore because this is outrageous that they admit don't worry we're gonna
[3:11:55.280 --> 3:12:00.040]  shut down these pro guns sites that are they're beating us I mean this is
[3:12:00.040 --> 3:12:05.040]  outrageous yes it is listen it's illegal to try to stop my free speech that's a
[3:12:05.040 --> 3:12:09.640]  civil rights violation it's illegal to stop me from voting it's illegal what
[3:12:09.640 --> 3:12:15.960]  they're doing these people are seditious worms everybody should get up
[3:12:15.960 --> 3:12:21.040]  people like that Alex is really angry angry they want to gag me now they want
[3:12:21.040 --> 3:12:25.360]  to take my speech that is an assault that the only thing worse than that just
[3:12:25.360 --> 3:12:28.880]  unplugged my headset only worse than that is taken to your kids or something I
[3:12:28.880 --> 3:12:35.720]  mean these people are authoritarians anything else are done just you wrote
[3:12:35.720 --> 3:12:39.640]  the article I'm joking let's get Daniels go ahead now that everybody should be
[3:12:39.640 --> 3:12:42.920]  aware of the Marriott mayors against the legal guns is actually going after guns
[3:12:42.920 --> 3:12:46.480]  like we have reported last month came out in the documents all folks about that
[3:12:46.480 --> 3:12:52.920]  that's right let's see them there was published documents that mayors against
[3:12:52.920 --> 3:12:57.880]  the legal guns was going after guns what was that it was it was mayors went
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:02.120]  public said we're in closed-door meetings they do plan on trying to
[3:13:02.120 --> 3:13:05.720]  confiscate once they get the list which is what mayor protein Mike Martinez said
[3:13:05.720 --> 3:13:11.560]  here in Austin and then the New York Assemblyman last last year McLaughlin
[3:13:11.560 --> 3:13:17.440]  also said behind closed-door Democrats proposals and the Democrats said do not
[3:13:17.440 --> 3:13:23.880]  publish that paper you had right exactly yeah there it is mayors leave
[3:13:23.880 --> 3:13:27.640]  Bloomberg's gun confiscation organization in droves they kind of copied our
[3:13:27.640 --> 3:13:31.280]  article two weeks ago remember you guys wrote that mm-hmm I guess the day later
[3:13:31.280 --> 3:13:34.840]  yeah they did that that's good I'm glad to know all did that that's our job even
[3:13:34.840 --> 3:13:38.080]  we don't get credit is to get people to realize what's going on well great job
[3:13:38.080 --> 3:13:42.400]  gentlemen I want to go all out with this you know now Bloomberg wants to ban
[3:13:42.400 --> 3:13:47.920]  pro-gun speech that's probably the headline you know pressures Facebook to
[3:13:47.920 --> 3:13:52.600]  end First Amendment yeah I mean that's it that's it good job guys I want this
[3:13:52.600 --> 3:13:58.240]  top news tonight and I want to I want the reporters to go with this this is big
[3:13:58.240 --> 3:14:01.800]  I mean we need to ban free speech now that's the
[3:14:01.800 --> 3:14:06.680]  trendy thing to do good job man I tell you folks this is just absolutely got me
[3:14:06.680 --> 3:14:11.280]  boiling right now let's go ahead and go to some calls Jason in Florida thanks
[3:14:11.280 --> 3:14:17.920]  for holding what's your take on all this yes Alex can you hear me yes sir oh okay
[3:14:17.920 --> 3:14:23.680]  I've got a friend of family who their husband is working for FEMA and they
[3:14:23.680 --> 3:14:29.560]  were going around building houses in a devastated area then they were called
[3:14:29.560 --> 3:14:34.520]  off not to build houses anymore they were told to go ahead and start looking for
[3:14:34.520 --> 3:14:41.640]  quote-unquote common endangered ants and if they were to find them you were to
[3:14:41.640 --> 3:14:46.520]  and this is this is on you know new construction areas and this is in
[3:14:46.520 --> 3:14:50.720]  Colorado if they were to find these quote-unquote endangered ants they were
[3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:55.160]  to tell everybody to cease and desist of any kind of new building on the on these
[3:14:55.160 --> 3:14:59.720]  lands well so that is I'd like to see news articles so that's now like they
[3:14:59.720 --> 3:15:03.880]  called suckerfish that are not even indigenous that are invasive as a way
[3:15:03.880 --> 3:15:08.440]  to shut off lake water in areas of California and Southern Oregon that's
[3:15:08.440 --> 3:15:12.440]  amazing and so you're saying it's a jenna 21 now where FEMA is actually
[3:15:12.440 --> 3:15:16.760]  running around as in virus spies yeah that's basically what it sounds like to
[3:15:16.760 --> 3:15:21.440]  me I mean when I first heard it that was screaming a jenna 21 to me just
[3:15:21.440 --> 3:15:26.640]  basically reclaiming the land so um yeah I'm trying to get more information on
[3:15:26.640 --> 3:15:33.040]  it like I said it was it came it came straight from his wife's mouth and he
[3:15:33.040 --> 3:15:37.640]  stays out of the state for like you know months on end so and he's basically
[3:15:37.640 --> 3:15:41.520]  got more phone conversation with him that he just actual contact
[3:15:41.520 --> 3:15:45.680]  so yeah he gives her all kinds of information because he thinks that
[3:15:45.680 --> 3:15:50.600]  she's not going to tell anybody very interesting we'll get some
[3:15:50.600 --> 3:15:54.520]  documentation do an article for us or shoot a video or some everybody is a
[3:15:54.520 --> 3:15:59.200]  reporter we've got a document all this I've seen some stuff about FEMA and the
[3:15:59.200 --> 3:16:02.800]  Green Police so it's very interesting I'll have to look into it but more and
[3:16:02.800 --> 3:16:07.240]  more they'll go we think this sucker fish is important or this bird that's
[3:16:07.240 --> 3:16:11.600]  not even endangered now they don't even like the environmental protection
[3:16:11.600 --> 3:16:17.160]  agency is always getting caught and and different groups dumping out an
[3:16:17.160 --> 3:16:20.320]  endangered animal in an area they're not even in so they can then take something
[3:16:20.320 --> 3:16:23.960]  off use so that the land owned by Rockefeller or whatever next door is
[3:16:23.960 --> 3:16:27.520]  double pricing and and that's how they create artificial scarcity that's all
[3:16:27.520 --> 3:16:33.200]  it is Mike in California you're on the air thanks for holding Alex good
[3:16:33.200 --> 3:16:36.240]  afternoon thanks for having me brother thanks brother what's on your mind today
[3:16:36.240 --> 3:16:41.720]  you know I'm calling from California I just I wanted to touch on this junk gun
[3:16:41.720 --> 3:16:46.600]  legislation that they are ramping up you know I think you guys covered it last
[3:16:46.600 --> 3:16:52.600]  week basically California's being basically all sorts of semi-auto pistols
[3:16:52.600 --> 3:16:58.160]  as being not safe and manufacturers that have to pay in orbit in amounts of
[3:16:58.160 --> 3:17:03.320]  money to get the guns analyzed and then approved to be on the approved list
[3:17:03.320 --> 3:17:07.880]  that on top of the micro stamping legislation they're just trying to
[3:17:07.880 --> 3:17:12.600]  drive guns out California's a big state want to get your take on that now that's
[3:17:12.600 --> 3:17:17.080]  it there's a war on the manufacturers the owners the ammo the last lead ma
[3:17:17.080 --> 3:17:22.000]  smelting got shut down by them they're shutting everything down because then
[3:17:22.000 --> 3:17:25.440]  only their little corporations and businesses can still operate it is a
[3:17:25.440 --> 3:17:29.920]  mafia operation great points appreciate your call Mike I mean it's happening
[3:17:29.920 --> 3:17:33.720]  it's a criminal takeover I just keep saying red alert red alert mark in
[3:17:33.720 --> 3:17:37.080]  Indiana probably last caller we have time for sorry the others and we'll talk
[3:17:37.080 --> 3:17:39.400]  to Jay the whistleblower we get back another day or we'll see what happened
[3:17:39.400 --> 3:17:59.640]  they don't get to Jay mark go ahead yes Alex says I was in a little town in Indiana and I had a running light out on my car so the police pulled me over and I had one of your bumper stickers on there you know give me
[3:17:59.640 --> 3:18:07.560]  living or give me death oh my gosh and they can't wouldn't even come up to the window you
[3:18:07.560 --> 3:18:19.840]  may be open the door and hand my driver's license and like my permit or license so
[3:18:19.840 --> 3:18:30.480]  how did it end what he thanked me for again in my carry concealed carry
[3:18:30.480 --> 3:18:39.520]  license so how did it end he leave you alone my experience most police are
[3:18:39.520 --> 3:18:43.400]  actually pro-liberty I mean I'm not I know there's bad ones out there I'm we
[3:18:43.400 --> 3:18:47.280]  criticize them but in my experience on average they're more awake than the
[3:18:47.280 --> 3:18:50.520]  public that's why it's hard to criticize them even though I do when bad ones do
[3:18:50.520 --> 3:18:53.960]  stuff I keep finding the police are more awake than most people but interesting
[3:18:53.960 --> 3:18:58.560]  appreciate your call mark Jay you get to do you got 60 seconds what are you a
[3:18:58.560 --> 3:19:04.960]  whistleblower on okay okay Alex I'm a long-time listener you show watch all

[3:24:15.640 --> 3:24:33.560]  ladies and gentlemen going back to the whistleblower jay and I guess I don't
[3:24:33.560 --> 3:24:37.600]  know what his job is as a consultant or as a reporter is sort of corporate
[3:24:37.600 --> 3:24:42.160]  intelligence out there a lot of jobs are folks listen to conferences or spy on
[3:24:42.160 --> 3:24:46.600]  the competition but he's listening to a big pharma conference I guess watching
[3:24:46.600 --> 3:24:49.440]  on a web camera maybe he was there and he's saying they were talking about how
[3:24:49.440 --> 3:24:53.480]  horrible all their drugs are for people will turn on these ads in like 10
[3:24:53.480 --> 3:24:57.320]  seconds it's so wonderful and great though it'll kill you the problem is you
[3:24:57.320 --> 3:25:01.480]  go into the reps and they will lie you go into the nurse and go it's a flu shot
[3:25:01.480 --> 3:25:07.680]  hurt me oh no side effects sir you get the insert as I can kill you and here's
[3:25:07.680 --> 3:25:11.920]  an article on that subject out of CBS news pro vaccine efforts debunking
[3:25:11.920 --> 3:25:18.440]  autism myths maybe scaring wary parents from shots translated it's a big study
[3:25:18.440 --> 3:25:22.920]  out the media is so untrusted that when they say take shots they're safe no one
[3:25:22.920 --> 3:25:33.160]  will take them oh man that is absolutely hilarious that is absolutely
[3:25:33.160 --> 3:25:38.880]  redonkulous that things like this are going on I mean it's just you people
[3:25:38.880 --> 3:25:45.400]  really are a joke let's go ahead and go back to Jay Jay encapsulate my friend
[3:25:45.400 --> 3:25:49.000]  what you heard them say go ahead and say the name of the conference I don't care
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:52.120]  tell us why you do it it's not a whistleblower people think a whistleblowing
[3:25:52.120 --> 3:25:56.040]  whistleblowing is releasing classified stuff because you're exposing a crime
[3:25:56.040 --> 3:25:59.720]  and they don't even supposed to go after that but just talking about what you saw
[3:25:59.720 --> 3:26:05.880]  in your daily life is not whistleblowing tell us what happened okay well at the
[3:26:05.880 --> 3:26:09.720]  end of this conference all they talked about was the rental deep generation and
[3:26:09.720 --> 3:26:14.440]  if you want to get somebody if you want to get somebody to be dependent on
[3:26:14.440 --> 3:26:17.520]  this government and on health on this new health care system that they're
[3:26:17.520 --> 3:26:23.720]  trying to impose the main way to do it was to make people sick or to make
[3:26:23.720 --> 3:26:27.440]  people blind because either way either one would make them completely
[3:26:27.440 --> 3:26:34.040]  dependent on this on this so-called Obamacare but the big applause I guess
[3:26:34.040 --> 3:26:37.360]  and the people listening to this conference were funders of this
[3:26:37.360 --> 3:26:43.760]  organization and they didn't care about the deficit it was a huge deficit huge
[3:26:43.760 --> 3:26:50.400]  spending and this is tax payers money and all they cared about was the
[3:26:50.400 --> 3:26:55.960]  rental degeneration the negative effects of their whatever they were
[3:26:55.960 --> 3:26:59.760]  doing and they were talking about how to get it to a larger population they
[3:26:59.760 --> 3:27:05.480]  were talking about pipeline they were talking about a large large amount of
[3:27:05.480 --> 3:27:08.800]  things basically I will they call it a pipeline that's the new freedom initiative
[3:27:08.800 --> 3:27:13.640]  of how to get to the kids with it but yeah these companies bear all of them on
[3:27:13.640 --> 3:27:17.240]  record their mission is to kill people and it doesn't mean there aren't good
[3:27:17.240 --> 3:27:20.520]  drug companies even good drugs put up with some of these bad companies it's
[3:27:20.520 --> 3:27:25.600]  that a lot of times covertly like with Dalcon shield it isn't really an
[3:27:25.600 --> 3:27:29.960]  IED that helps woman out of a baby it ends up sterilizing you and and that's
[3:27:29.960 --> 3:27:33.640]  the whole issue is like they say something does one thing and it does but
[3:27:33.640 --> 3:27:41.000]  it also does BCD EFG and it does a whole other grouping of things and it's very
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:44.000]  very frustrating well what else was going on I mean I wish you'd give us a
[3:27:44.000 --> 3:27:47.960]  better idea of what farm that was what the drug was what they were talking
[3:27:47.960 --> 3:27:57.280]  about what's your job why do you do this I'm just curious what what's the
[3:27:57.280 --> 3:28:03.120]  reason it's basically I don't want to be called a telemarketer or but what I do
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:06.960]  is like you know what your screen is do they basically pick up calls place the
[3:28:06.960 --> 3:28:11.800]  person in the radio show basically I would pay people into the into a conflict
[3:28:11.800 --> 3:28:17.120]  into a you're someone that's guiding people into the big pharma conference
[3:28:17.120 --> 3:28:21.760]  and so you're getting to hear the vampires meet and you know hop around
[3:28:21.760 --> 3:28:24.560]  and do their normal behavior all right good job good to hear that information
